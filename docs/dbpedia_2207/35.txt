SUMMARY

In Rio de Janeiro, nightclub singer Lola Dean accepts the proposal of Clark Denton, then insists on hosting a party for their acquaintances Ken and Joan Reynolds, Grace Ellis, and Bill Kellogg. Clark agrees and Lola performs her act, which is watched by Charlie Chan, his number two son, Jimmy, and Captain Souto of the Rio de Janeiro police, who are there to arrest Lola for the murder of Manuel Cardosa a year and a half earlier in Honolulu. To avoid a scandal, Chan decides to arrest Lola quietly at her home later that night.

Leaving the club with Clark, Lola follows the advice of her secretary, Helen Ashby, and visits Alfredo Marana, a noted psychic. Marana, conducting with his clients what he calls “psychognosis,” drugs them with an herbal ingredient added to the tobacco of a cigarette that is stimulated by the caffeine in a small cup of coffee. After Lola is drugged, Marana asks her a series of questions and records her confessing to the killing of Manuel Cardosa because she was in love with him but he would not leave his wife for her. Snapping Lola out of her trance-like state, Marana tells her what she said while under the influence of the truth-inducing drug, adding that he will keep the information confidential. On her way home, fearing that her dark secret will be revealed, Lola persuades Clark to agree to elope with her that same night and take a plane to the United States.

Back home, Lola immediately begins to pack. Guests have already begun to arrive for the party, and while Helen tells them about the impending elopement, Chan, Jimmy, and Souto arrive to arrest Lola, and soon, the singer is found stabbed to death in her bedroom. Next to her body lies a broken brooch, a crushed corsage, and a smashed wristwatch, which, Chan notes, was deliberately set to the wrong time by the killer, as the watch stem had been not pushed back in.

Helen tells Chan about Lola’s visit to Marana and about the persistent attentions of a man named Paul Wagner. The two men are brought to the house, where Wagner admits that Lola was his ex-wife and that he had come earlier in an attempt to win her back. However, upon hearing of her plans to elope with Clark, Wagner left the house. Marana then plays the recording of Lola’s session and then demonstrates his trance-inducing methods on a doubting Jimmy.

Later, Chan notes that the pin belonging to the broken brooch in Lola’s room is missing and deduces that it is possibly embedded in the killer’s shoe. While Chan and Souto investigate, Jimmy catches Rice, the butler, with jewelry belonging to Lola. After a struggle, Jimmy and the police hold Rice, who admits to having stolen the jewelry, while maintaining his innocence regarding Lola Dean’s murder. Before Rice can name the murderer, the lights suddenly go out, and he is shot dead.

Later, with all suspects seated at the table in the same locations where they were sitting earlier that evening, Chan reveals that Helen is in the position where, earlier, scratches were noted by the detective and Souto on the wood floor. Inspecting her shoes, Chan finds the small piece of brooch pin. He suggests that Marana place Helen in a trance in order to discover the truth. After Helen smokes the cigarette given to her by Marana and drinks the coffee, she slips into a trance, but she still maintains her innocence.

CONCLUSION:

Chan then states that he would like to be tested as well, declining the cigarette offered to him by Marana in favor of that which Helen had inhaled. The detective first drinks the coffee, but, as he puffs away on the cigarette, nothing else happens, showing that Marana had purposely given Helen a non-drugged cigarette in order to protect her.

“I killed Lola Dean!” says an emphatic Marana, whose real name, reveals Chan, is Alfredo Cardosa, the brother of Manuel, claiming that he had done so to avenge his murdered brother. However, Helen confesses that she committed the murders of Lola Dean and Rice because she is actually Barbara Cardosa, the widow of the murdered Manuel. Helen continues that she had wanted to take the recording of Lola to the police the next day, but when she learned of her plans to elope and leave the country, she feared that Lola would once again escape. Since Rice had seen her with Lola’s body, Helen had killed him to silence him.

Throughout the film, Jimmy exhibited a growing interest in Lili Wong, Lola’s personal maid. With the case resolved, Jimmy asks his Pop for permission to bring Lili back home with them to Honolulu. Chan says no, showing Jimmy his notification of having been drafted into the United States Army.

NOTES: Although Ted North’s character is called “Carlos Dantas” in the film’s onscreen credits and in reviews, in the picture he is called “Clark Denton.” According to Hollywood Review news items, Virgil Miller was originally assigned as the photographer on this film but was replaced by Joseph P. MacDonald, who was promoted after serving as an operative cameraman with Twentieth Century-Fox for eight years. An April 30, 1941 Hollywood Reporter news item noted that Jeanne Kelly had been loaned by Universal to appear in the next Charlie Chan film, and, while it was presumably this picture, her participation has not been confirmed. Charlie Chan in Rio bears a striking resemblance to The Black Camel, directed ten years earlier by Hamilton MacFadden, who appears in the cast of Rio. It is perhaps of interest to note that MacFadden also appeared briefly in The Black Camel, and he also had a minor role in Charlie Chan in Reno (1939).

CHARLIE CHAN’S APHORISMS

Interesting problem in chemistry: sweet wine often turn nice woman sour.

Biggest mistakes in history made by people who didn’t think.

Pretty girl, like lap dog, sometimes go mad.

Long experience teach, until murderer found, suspect everybody.

Good policy to have murderer consider detective dope.

Slippery man sometimes slip in own oil.

Experience teach, unless eyewitness present, every murder case is long shot.

Must have patience.

Prefer not to walk across before coming to bridge.

In these troubled times, best to be economical.

To one who kill, life can suddenly become most precious.

Fruits of labor sometimes very bitter.

OTHER WORTHY STATEMENTS:

Number two son behave about hot music like corn over hot fire – pops. (to Sr. Souto)

As number two son would say, “Case in bag, it’s cinch.” (to Sr. Souto)

(Grace Ellis: “Remember, Mr. Chan, I’m an American citizen.”) Am proud to say, so am I.

Looks like long shot begin to turn into short shot. (to Sr. Souto)

REVIEW

Variety, August 27, 1941

‘Charlie Chan in Rio’ is marked by mediocre acting and direction. It looks as if the series on the Honolulu detective is coming to the end of its rope, with this one speeding that process along. This chapter is not going to make any new friends for Charlie Chan and will probably lose many old ones.

Aside from Sidney Toler and his screen son, Sen Yung, the acting borders on the terrible. And to make matters worse, many of the players suffer from the camera or makeup artist, or both, notably Cobina Wright, Jr., and Jacqueline Dalya, playing the nitery singer who murders and is murdered in turn. Furthermore, Miss Wright appears badly in need of a dramatic coach. Miss Dalya sings one song, but neither the voice nor tune is standout.

Samuel G. Engel and Lester Ziffren contributed the screen play, childish in plot and dialog. Harry Lachman’s direction perhaps suffered from all the handicaps, and maybe the fact that that it looks so bad is not all his own fault. However, he certainly should check his script girl for the numerous obvious boners that crept into this film.

So with humble gratitude for the contribution of Caulos from Rio, it is hoped that the following information will add to your viewing pleasure.

1 – The famous Sugarloaf Mountain (Pão de Açúcar) which overlooks Baia de Guanabara (Guanabara Bay) in beaitiful Rio de Janeiro. Its peak rises about 1,300 feet above sea level.

2 – Baia de Guanabara (Guanabara Bay). This bay is the entrance to the port of Rio de Janeiro.

3 – Gloria Beach.

4 – Avenida Beira-Mar.

5 – Just through the “C” in Chan, we catch a glimpse of the Hotel Gloria. As the opening credits appear on-screen, the hotel can be seen more clearly.

SONG LYRICS

They Met in Rio (A Midnight Serenade) as sung by Lola Dean at the Carioca Casino

This song of love begins the night they met down in Rio,

In a café by the bay they romanced to a midnight serenade;

She told him to forget the night they met down in Rio,

And there were tears in her eyes as they danced to a midnight serenade.

He whispered, “You must be mine forevermore,”

And then she showed him someone else’s picture in the tiny little locket she wore.

And so he rode away but left his heart down in Rio,

All that remains of their love are the strains of a midnight serenade.

I, Yi, Yi, Yi (Like You Very Much) as heard on the record by Lola Dean played by Alfredo Marana

I, yi, yi, yi, yi, I like you very much,

I, yi, yi, yi, yi, I think you’re grand;

Why, why, why is it that when I feel your touch,

My heart starts to beat, to beat the band?

I, yi, yi, yi, yi like you to hold me tight,

You are too, too, too, too, too divine;

If you want to be in someone’s arms tonight,

Just be sure the arms you’re in are mine.

Oh, I like your lips

And I like your eyes;

Would you like my hips

To hipsnotize you?

Si, si, si, si, si, si, see the moon above,

Way, way, way, way, way up in the blue;

Si, si, si, señor, I think I fall in love.

And when I fall, I think I fall for you.

I, yi, yi, yi,

Si, si, si, si,

I, yi, yi, yi

Can see, see, see

That you’re for me.
