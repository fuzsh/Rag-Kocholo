On September 22, 1955 a consent decree was entered against Pictorial Films, Inc., and Films, Inc., distributors.\n\nInvolved in the case is the legality of the distributing methods of the defendants as they relate to the 16mm films.\n\nBefore outlining in greater detail the pleadings and issues in the case, we give the following accepted definitions of the trade terms used.\n\n\"Sixteen millimeter films\" are motion picture films 16mm in width, in contrast with \"standard films\" which are 35mm in width. \"Feature films\" are motion pictures four or more reels in length other than those of strictly educational, religious or commercial character. \"Theatres\" are motion picture houses in which feature films are exhibited to the public for profit. \"Theatrical exhibition\" is any showing of a motion picture for the profit of an exhibitor. \"Exhibitor\" includes all persons, firms, corporations and public agencies engaged in the exhibition of motion pictures. \"Clearance\" is protection granted to an exhibitor or exhibitors by limiting the terms on which motion pictures may be exhibited by other exhibitors. \"Merchants' free shows\" are exhibitions of motion picture films sponsored by merchants to enhance their good will and to obtain publicity. They are open to the public, no admission being charged. \"Roadshow men\" *81 are itinerant exhibitors who make a profit from showing motion pictures to the public for admission charges. \"Coin-operated machine\" is a mechanical device containing a 16mm film, automatically projecting it upon insertion of a coin and arranged so as to make the projection viewable by one person at a time. Other terms will be defined as the discussion progresses.\n\nI\n\nThe Pleadings and Issues\n\nThe corporate defendants are incorporated either under the laws of Delaware or New York. All except one, Republic Productions, Inc., have their principal place of business in New York City, New York, but each of them transacts business and is found in the Southern District of California.\n\nThe producing companies named as defendants remaining in the case are: Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation (to be referred to hereinafter as Fox); Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. (to be referred to hereinafter as Warner); RKO Radio Pictures Inc. (to be referred to hereinafter as RKO); Columbia Pictures Corporation (to be referred to hereinafter as Columbia); and Universal Pictures Company, Inc. (to be referred to hereinafter as Universal).\n\nRKO, in addition to producing motion pictures, also distributes them, including motion pictures in 16mm width. Warner, Columbia, and Universal each has a wholly-owned subsidiary engaged in the distribution of motion pictures, including 16mm pictures. These subsidiaries, named as defendants, are, respectively; Warner Bros. Pictures Distribution Corporation, Screen Gems, Inc., and United World Films, Inc. The two other distributing companies named as defendants are: Films, Inc., (to be referred to hereinafter as Films) and Pictorial Films, Inc. (to be referred to hereinafter as Pictorial). Both defendants Films and Pictorial are engaged primarily in the distribution of 16mm motion picture films. Films distributes the 16mm product of, among others, the defendants Fox and Warner.\n\nSix exhibitor associations and an organization representing all phases of the industry (Council of Motion Pictures Organizations, Inc., to be referred to hereinafter as COMPO) are named as co-conspirators in this action. Of the six exhibitor associations, two, Theatre Owners of America, Inc. (to be referred to hereinafter as TOA) and Allied States Association of Motion Picture Exhibitors (to be referred to hereinafter as Allied) are national trade associations composed primarily of local, regional or state associations of theatre owners. The other four exhibitor organizations, Independent Theatre Owners Association, Inc., Metropolitan Motion Picture Theatres Association, Inc., Southern California Theatre Owners Association and Pacific Coast Conference of Independent Theatre Owners, are regional exhibitor associations.\n\nThe complaint charges that beginning some years prior to 1945, the exact date being unknown, and continuously since 1945, the defendants have been and are now engaged in an unlawful conspiracy in restraint in interstate trade and commerce in 16mm feature films. More specifically, it is charged:\n\n\"29. During the period of time covered by this complaint, and for the purpose of effectuating the aforesaid combination and conspiracy, the defendants did the things alleged in paragraph 28 hereof and entered into written and oral agreements containing restrictions hereinafter set forth, limiting the purposes for, locations at, times when and conditions under which sixteen millimeter films may be exhibited.\n\n\"30. The aforesaid restrictions on sixteen millimeter feature film exhibitions consist of the following:\n\n\"(a) Refusing to license any one to telecast sixteen millimeter feature films;\n\n\"(b) Refusing to license others to exhibit sixteen millimeter feature *82 films in locations which are open to the public within a zone, usually ten miles in radius, around any established 35 millimeter theatre;\n\n\"(c) Restricting licenses for exhibition of sixteen millimeter feature films in churches, schools, clubs, hotels, and drive-in theatres by limitations upon admission prices, advertising, categories of persons to be admitted, or hours of showing.\n\n\"(d) Imposing arbitrary and excessive clearances between the first release of a feature motion picture of 35 millimeter width and its exhibition on sixteen millimeter films;\n\n\"(e) Refusing to license others to exhibit sixteen millimeter feature films at free merchants' shows, taverns, or in coin-operated machines and refusing to license roadshow men;\n\n\"(f) Reserving for each of the defendants severally, or for some of them jointly, the right to approve or disapprove each location for the exhibition of sixteen millimeter feature films produced or distributed by such defendant or defendants, before or after the licensing of such location by distributors or dealers, coupled with the right to arbitrarily abrogate any license granted pursuant to a given location approval; and\n\n\"(g) Granting or withholding licenses to exhibit sixteen millimeter feature films in conformity with lists of locations `approved' or `disapproved' by the defendants or some of them.\n\n\"31. The defendants have maintained an intricate system to police and enforce, and with the assistance of Theatre Owners of America, Inc., have policed and enforced, the license restrictions imposed upon exhibitors of sixteen millimeter feature films, and have blacklisted or boycotted exhibitors who disregard such restrictions.\"\n\nThe effects claimed for the alleged illegal actions of the conspirators are stated, generally, to be: (a) suppression of telecasting of the better feature films to television audiences; (b) unreasonable restraint of competition in the interstate distribution of feature films; (c) foreclosing actual and potential exhibitors of 16mm feature films from significant parts of the United States market, and (d) denying to persons living in theatreless towns or in institutions (both governmental and other) which prohibit their inhabitants to leave their premises the opportunity to see anything but outmoded feature films.\n\nIn their separate answers the defendants denied these allegations. Their proof in the record was directed to showing that whatever restrictive practices existed as to the exploitation of 16mm feature films were the result not of concerted action between the producers or the producers and distributors, and/or unindicted co-conspirators, but were dictated by the particular exigencies and needs of the market of each producing company, and that they were \"reasonable\" in the circumstances.\n\nII\n\nThe Concept of Reasonableness\n\nThe object of the Sherman Act was stated in one of the older cases to be\n\n\"to preserve the right of freedom to trade.\"[3] Later cases have stressed this object.[4] However, the Sherman Act *83 condemns only \"unreasonable\" restraints.[5] The Supreme Court has read the concept of \"reasonableness\" as it existed at common law into the Act.[6] This concept applies to all practices which were not at common law, and which the courts do not now consider illegal per se.[7] This phase of the problem is of primary *84 importance in this case. The Government's complaint alleges that by the practices charged in the complaint,\n\n\"competition in the interstate distribution and exhibition of feature films has been unreasonably restrained.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\nHowever, the Government's testimony was directed to proof of (a) the existence of the restrictions and (b) that they were the result of a conspiracy on the part of the defendants and others. No direct proof was offered by the Government to show that the restraints were unreasonable, the Government contending that unreasonableness could be inferred from the nature of the practices. The reasonableness of the restraints is a cardinal fact in a case of this character. The most benign agreement concerning trade, the ordinary manner in which an industry selects its custom, and makes its decision to deal or not to deal with others, restrains, to some extent, whether this be the result of the individual action of one or the concerted action of many.\n\nAs stated by the Supreme Court in one of the older cases:\n\n\"Every agreement concerning trade, every regulation of trade, restrains. To bind, to restrain, is of their very essence. The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant facts. This is not because a good intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but because knowledge of intent may help the court to interpret facts and to predict consequences.\"[8] (Emphasis added.)\n\nIn a more recent case the badges, the criteria, by which reasonableness is determined are spelled out:\n\n\"In determining what constitutes unreasonable restraint, we do not think the dollar volume is in itself of compelling significance; we look rather to the percentage of business controlled, the strength of the remaining competition, whether the action springs from business requirements or purpose to monopolize, the probable development of the industry, consumer demands, and other characteristics of the market.\"[9] (Emphasis added.)\n\nThese cases recognize that if actions spring from \"business requirements\" or \"consumer demands\", they will be upheld although they may result in restraint.[10] These criteria apply with greater force to a business of the character here involved.\n\nMotion pictures cannot be marketed like other products. The system of clearances whereby protection is granted to exhibitors against competition by restricting *85 the area and period in which motion pictures may be exhibited by subsequent exhibitors is legitimate.[11] The Supreme Court has said that clearance\n\n\"is in part designed to protect the value of the license which is granted.\"[12]\n\nThese general considerations are of utmost significance in the case before us. For it cannot be contended that the mere fact that the showing of 16mm films was restricted to certain groups and areas where they did not impinge upon the patronage of the regular theatres was per se a violation.\n\nTelevision stations which telecast motion pictures are both customers and competitors of the producers and exhibitors. For it is shown in the record that some of them are engaged in producing motion pictures for telecasting, thus competing not only with the motion picture exhibitors, but with the motion picture producers for the patronage of the public from whom the viewers of this type of entertainment are recruited. So the problem before us is to determine whether the practice as to either group is reasonable.\n\nIII\n\nInferences from Similarity of Action\n\nBefore doing this, we consider the question to which most of the Government's evidence was directed: Were the practices the result of a conspiracy between the defendants? The courts have laid down rather liberal rules of proof. Express agreement is not necessary. Any conformance to an agreed or contemplated pattern of conduct will warrant the inference of conspiracy.[13]\n\nConscious parallelism of action may be the basis of an inference of pre-existing agreement.[14] However, where positive evidence is offered to show the origin of a policy and the business considerations which motivated its establishment, parallelism, conscious or unconscious, ceases to be the determinant. To such a situation the language of the Supreme Court in one of the latest cases applies:\n\n\"* * * To be sure, business behavior is admissible circumstantial evidence from which the fact finder may infer agreement. * * * But this Court has never held that proof of parallel business behavior conclusively establishes agreement or, phrased differently, that such behavior itself constitutes a Sherman Act offense. Circumstantial evidence of consciously parallel behavior may have made heavy inroads into the traditional judicial attitude toward conspiracy; but `conscious parallelism' has not yet read conspiracy out of the Sherman Act entirely.\"[15]\n\n*86 IV\n\nThe Alleged Conspiracy\n\nTwo problems are before us: (a) the existence of a conspiracy as to, and (b) the legality of, certain restrictive practices of the producers as to the exhibition of 16mm films under § 1 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.[16]\n\nA. The Quantum of Proof.\n\nEven a motion to dismiss made at the conclusion of the plaintiff's case on the ground \"that upon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief\", may now be turned into a decision on the merits.[17] In acting upon it, the Judge is\n\n\"bound to take an unbiased view of all the evidence\"[18]\n\nthen before him and to accord to it the weight to which he believes it is entitled.\n\nIn rendering judgment after full trial, we have greater freedom to choose between conflicting versions as to facts and between divergent inferences from controverted or even undisputed facts. In making the choice, we are not concerned with theoretical concepts as to burden of proof but are governed only by the preponderance rule. In approaching the matter we consider the nature of the product involved.\n\nB. The Nature of 16mm Films.\n\nThe standard gauge for motion picture films is 35mm. The 16mm films were not originally intended for commercial exploitation. Their use began in 1935, and arose out of demands for home showings and showings before \"non-theatrical\" audiences. During World War II the major producers, including the defendants, released 16mm versions of their feature films for showing by the Armed Forces, Veterans' Hospitals, the American Red Cross, and the United Services Organization, Inc. (USO), furnishing them free to the Armed Forces. The demand from military and auxiliary organizations diminished at the end of the war, but increased from the civilian market. A majority of all 16mm feature films exhibited in the United States are produced and distributed by the defendants. However, it should be borne in mind that the standard 35mm versions of feature motion pictures are, as one of the former officers of RKO put it, \"the life blood\" of the motion picture business. By contrast, 16mm films constitute, at most, a minimal percentage of this business.\n\nThe actual or potential market for 16 mm feature films includes the following, among others: (a) Armed Forces of the United States, Veterans' Hospitals and various other Government agencies, American Red Cross, and United Service Organizations, Inc. (USO); (b) theatreless towns, hotels, clubs, camps, roadshow men, drive-in theatres, merchants' free shows, coin-operated machines, and private homes; (c) schools, churches, and charitable organizations; (d) hospitals, *87 sanatoria, homes of the aged or disabled, and convents; (e) ships, trains and planes.\n\nThere is testimony in the record that, on the whole, 16mm films are not so suitable for theatrical exhibition as the 35mm films. This for the reason that the larger the gauge of the film, the better the opportunity to achieve clarity in projection. In contrast, when the optical image is reduced from 35mm to 16mm and is blown up on a big screen, there is loss of clarity. Because of this deficiency, no substantial number of theatres exhibiting 16mm motion pictures commercially has ever existed or exists today in the United States. And, at best, commercial distribution of 16mm films is and always has been marginal. There is, however, increasing demand for 16mm feature films for television programming, since a majority of telecasting stations in this country are quipped with facilities for the telecasting of 16mm and not of 35mm films. The following statistical data are illuminating.\n\nThe number of stations having 16mm projection equipment only increased from 67 in 1952 to 372 in 1955 (August 5). According to statistical data compiled by a Government economist, and placed into the record, the number of television stations having both 35mm and 16mm equipment actually decreased from 22 in 1952, to 19 in 1955. The percentage distribution for the same period was 20.3 in 1952 for 35mm and 16mm, 62.1 for 16mm, 4.6 in 1955 for 35mm and 16 mm and 95.1 for 16mm.\n\nWhile this increase in the possibilities for televising 16mm versions of feature motion pictures was taking place, the major producers were experimenting with diverse methods for the enlargement of the vista beyond that provided by the standard 35mm film. To attain this object, a larger gauge was and is being developed ranging from 55mm to 70mm. Reduction from standard to the smaller gauge in order to achieve a wider exploitation of 16mm feature films would be a reversal of this trend in the production of motion pictures.\n\nAgainst this changing technological and market background, what were the actions of the producers after the war demands ceased?\n\nC. Independent Action or Concert.\n\nIn seeking to satisfy the needs of the market just outlined, the producers were compelled to take into consideration the individual demands and distinct needs of the various exhibition outlets already enumerated. These outlets which we have designated as (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) can be reclassified into two general groups. The first group ((a), (c) and (d)) consists of establishments to which the general public is not admitted and where no admission fee is charged. To those in this category, 16mm films were made easy of access, the postwar policy being to allow exhibition at low rentals a few months after the release of the standard versions, the lowest period being six months.\n\nTo certain persons and institutions in the second group ((b) and (e)) some of the producers, at one time or another, denied access to 16mm films altogether. When they were offered to them, the availability period ranged from twelve to eighteen months. Comparative tables and data as to this will be given further on in the discussion. For the present we confine ourselves to a brief summary of the bases for the policy of denial or total exclusion.\n\nIn the establishments included in the first group motion pictures are exhibited to build morale. The viewers are persons who would not patronize commercial motion pictures, because they could not, at the time, leave the institutions. For this reason practically no territorial restrictions are applied.\n\nIn the establishments in the second category were persons who sought diversion and could patronize commercial theatres. Because of this, territorial limitations were applied which differed in various areas depending on the assumed habits *88 of theatre-goers, longer in the Western states where, presumably, persons will travel farther for entertainment. These factors applied also to certain theatrical locations where motion pictures in substandard size were exhibited to the general public for a small admission fee. This included theatreless towns, in which a person would seek permission to exhibit a film at intervals in a private residence, or, as has been testified, on the side of a farmer's barn. As to these, several considerations determined availability: (a) price; (b) the character and responsibility of the person to be entrusted with the film; and (c) proximity of 35mm theatre. In these instances, all other considerations being equal, 16mm films were made available within eighteen months, more or less.\n\nDistance was important in accepting and rejecting locations. But there was no uniformity of policy as to it between the defendants. Several charts indicating the action of other companies on certain rejected locations are reproduced here:\n\nRKO Radio Pictures, Inc. ------------------------- Action of Other Companies Prior to July 22, 1952 on 2,107 Locations Rejected by RKO Radio Pictures, Inc. from 1946 to July 22, 1952 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Twentieth Century-Fox Universal Film Pictures Warner Bros.

So while there is similarity in the pattern, there is enough variation to dispel the idea of concert as the source of the policy. This is especially true when we consider the emphatic testimony of the officers of the producers at the trial that there was no understanding, tacit or other, as to the policy. The same officers testified that the failure to release feature motion pictures in the vault to television was the result of their individual determination considering the market, the price, the effect of release on the reissue value of the motion pictures, the effect of television on the personality of the actors, and similar considerations. These were all of the type which are determinative of distribution policy in the case of any commercial product.\n\nIn short, the testimony in the record warrants the conclusion that whatever similarity exists in the restrictions adopted as to the exhibition of 16mm films was due to the similarity of the problem with which the producers were confronted. Each of the companies had also to consider the effect of the release of 16mm pictures on the custom of their regular customers, the 35mm theatre exhibitors. For each of the 35mm theatre owners in the field was either a customer *90 or a prospective customer of each of the producing companies. So the effect of the release upon them had to be borne in mind. If in so doing the producing companies, so far as television is concerned, bided their time, the attitude was commanded by the effect which an unrestricted policy would have upon theatre viewers of motion pictures.[19] In the last analysis, therefore, similarity of problem engendered similarity of action, a phenomenon recognized by lawyers and economists alike, which will be treated further on in the discussion.\n\nD. The Role of TOA and other exhibitor groups in Television Policy.\n\nThe Theatre Owners of America (TOA) is not only named as one of the co-conspirators, but is treated by the Government as the bête noire in the case. It has been pictured as the chief instrument for making effective the restrictive policy. While some of the officers of the producing and distributing companies have been in correspondence with the organization, and others may have even kept informed of, or spoken at, some of its meetings, the evidence in the record shows that the organization, instead of being a means for carrying out the producers' policies, as is often the case,[20] was constantly complaining that the producers and distributors had failed to adopt a definitive policy of exclusion as to 16mm films. Indeed, in the exhibits offered to show the activities of TOA, both at regional and national level, its relation to the producers seems to be not that of a co-conspirator helping effectuate policies mutually agreed upon, but rather as a gadfly, constantly urging the producers to adopt a definitive policy.\n\nOne of the Government's exhibits is a letter dated October 7, 1948 sent to all the producers, in which the President of TOA informed them of the resolution adopted at their convention and which stated:\n\n\"We would very much appreciate it, if you will, at your earliest convenience, reply to this request from our members and advise us of the position of your Company in this matter.\"\n\nThis letter does not read like the peremptory urging or command of a co-conspirator, saying in effect:\n\n\"This is the policy adopted to which you must conform.\"\n\nRather, does it sound like a humble petition to some one whose actions it cannot control that the supplicant be informed of the position the producing company would take. And the producers so understood it. For in answer to the letter the President of Universal stated:\n\n\"* * * We will, of course, give due consideration to it in any future decisions by this Company.\n\n\"As you know, television is still in its formative stage. We are watching it very carefully, as I am sure everyone in the motion picture industry is doing, and it appears as though it will be some time before any of the companies will be in position to make any determination with respect thereto.\"\n\nOn January 29, 1949 TOA's television committee made a report which had *91 among its recommendations the following:\n\n\"a) We recommend that this association go on record as commending heartily those industry leaders in production and distribution who, in the protection of their own business and the business of their exhibitor customers have adopted a sound and long range point of view and have declined to make available to Television, those films which were created for and paid for by the motion picture theatres.\n\n\"b) We further recommend that all producing and distributing companies be counselled by this association in the strongest terms that a grave danger and injustice would be presented should Television be provided with motion picture film designed and created for exhibition in motion picture theatres. This recommendation is not made to repress or hamper a new art. It is based on the truth that any such practice would cripple the theatres and diminish the power of the theatres of the country to continue to support the fine productions that the theatre industry has made possible. We feel that the `giving away' of the industry product on television is economically indefensible from the point of view of the theatres. We believe it to be equally unsound from the point of view of the producers and distributors who would soon find that they have jeopardized their own income as would be evidenced by the diminishing returns at the box office.\"\n\nOne of the most active regional exhibitor groups is Allied Theatres of Illinois, Inc. Its correspondence, through its very vocal President, Jack Kirsch, appears in the record. In a letter addressed to him on May 14, 1951, by Herbert J. Yates, President of the Republic Pictures Corp., as to which a Consent Decree has been entered in this case, it was stated that\n\n\"Republic's sole television activity has been to consider the sale of some of our old pictures produced approximately ten or more years ago and which are obsolete for Motion Picture theatres.\"\n\nMr. Kirsch's answer showed very emphatically his disapproval which extended not only to an actual inauguration of a policy of distribution but even to its consideration:\n\n\"In spite of all you say in your letter, we can't see the moral justification of any producing-distributing company even considering making their films available to television regardless of their age. Those pictures which you refer to as being `obsolete for Motion Picture theatres' were made specifically for theatre consumption and the film rentals from exhibitors which went towards making the production of these pictures possible are now going to be diverted to a use that is absolutely detrimental to those same exhibitors' interests.\n\n\"Our organization has consistently taken the position against any company making their film available to television, because by doing so they are breaking faith with their theatre customers. We have restated this position on each occasion when such a move was contemplated or consummated by any distributor. If we did otherwise we would be derelict in our duty and responsibilities to the hundreds of independent theatre owners whom we represent and who rely on us for guidance and assistance.\n\n\"We must therefore take the same position in voicing our serious objections to your considering the sale to television of pictures regardless of their age or quality. If the sale to television of pictures ten years old went unchallenged there would be no end to this practice.\n\n\"I am sorry, Mr. Yates, that we must of necessity disagree with the reasons which you set forth as motivating your decisions, but we shall continue to cling to the hope that on *92 reflection and in the best interests of the future welfare of our great industry you will reconsider your action.\"\n\nIn forwarding the correspondence to the General Counsel of Allied States Association of Motion Picture Exhibitors (Allied) one of the exhibitor associations named as co-conspirators in this action, Mr. Kirsch made this notation:\n\n\"To my mind we shouldn't relax our objections to any distributor who might be thinking along similar lines. First it will be pictures 10 years old, then 5 and the next thing we know they'll be selling TV right out of the can.\"\n\nOn February 25, 1952 a progress report of TOA, signed by all three of its national chairmen, still considered the policy unsettled so far as the major producers were concerned. It stated:\n\n\"Sale of Films to Television \"Wants Issue Settled\n\n\"Walter Reade, Jr., urged that President Mitchell Wolfson be authorized to name a committee, representing the West Coast, Chicago, and New York areas, to call upon the heads of each company to settle once and for all the position of that company with regard to the sale of films to television.\n\n\"Committee Appointed\n\n\"Wolfson appointed the following exhibitor-leaders to serve as a committee to approach producers and let them know that `we are fully opposed to their selling film to television:'\n\n\"Walter Reade, Jr., Eastern Chairman. \"Sherrill Corwin, Western Chairman. \"Eddie Silverman, Chicago Chairman.\"\n\nOn March 6, 1952, at a meeting of the Independent Theatres Association, its President, Harry Brandt, according to a Government exhibit, spoke:\n\n\"in some detail about the exhibition of theatrical films on commercial television stations and castigated the practice as detrimental to the industry.\"\n\nThese instances show that: (a) there was no uniform policy as to television; (b) the theatre owners' associations, although alleged to be co-conspirators, had evidently not been instrumental in securing the adoption of such uniform policy; (c) some of the producers were considering the sale of or actually selling feature pictures for television; and (d) that in so doing they were not consulting other producers or the theatre group, which was constantly clamoring for, but evidently not receiving, the assurance of a uniform practice. So the activities of these trade associations, expressive as they may be of the wishes of the exhibitors, fail to show transmutation into action or even promise of action by the producers.\n\nOn the whole, we are led to the conclusion that while the restrictive practices of which the Government complains were, in the main, actually practiced by the defendants, they were determined upon individually by the producer-defendants and were not the result of concert or conspiracy between the producer-defendants and/or any of the other co-conspirators named or unnamed.\n\nIn what precedes we have outlined with brevity the basis for this conclusion. Additional facts will be adverted to as we discuss the problem of reasonableness. For as I insisted throughout the trial, two problems are before the Court: (a) the existence of a conspiracy to restrain commerce through certain restrictive practices; and (b) the reasonableness of the practices. The two problems are interrelated. Of necessity the facts relating to them overlap. And an attempt, in an opinion, to separate too rigidly the facts as they relate to one or the other of the problems would result in unnecessary length and repetitive treatment.\n\nV\n\nThe Problem of Reasonableness\n\nThe reasonableness of the restrictive practices shown to exist is a cardinal issue in this case and was adverted to *93 in what precedes. Some of the principles, such as uniformity of conditions for which only one remedy exists, were also alluded to. However, they and others require a greater elaboration.\n\nA. Identity of Problem and Remedy.\n\nCourts and writers have for a long time taken cognizance of the fact that in our modern economy the units which compose a particular activity, no matter how independent they may be, are, to a great extent, interrelated. The problems which arise are of a character which affect all, and when this is the case uniformity in the solution of the problem may result\n\n\"from active, free and unrestrained competition.\"[21]\n\nEconomists have noted the occurrence of this fact in cases where the number of sellers of the product is small and the group of buyers is large. In these instances, especially if the product has become standardized,\n\n\"all buyers and sellers are in full communication with each other, so as to constitute really one market.\"[22]\n\nThe act of each, no matter how independently taken, may have a striking similarity, for the very obvious reason that the measures taken are the only ones which commend themselves in the circumstances. As the same writer has put it:\n\n\"Each is forced by the situation itself to take into account the policy of his rival in determining his own, and this cannot be construed as a `tacit agreement' between the two.\n\n\"This is true, no matter how complex the manner in which his competitor's policies figure in the determination of his own. A certain move, say a price cut, may be advantageous to one seller in view of his rival's present policy, i. e., assuming it not to change. But if his rival is certain to make a counter move, there is no reason to assume that he will not; and for the first seller to recognize the fact that his rival's policy is not a datum, but is determined in part by his own, cannot be construed as a negation of independence. It is simple to consider the indirect consequences of his own acts the effect on himself of his own policy, mediated by that of his competitor. Of course, he may or may not take them into account, but he is equally independent in either case.\"[23] (Emphasis added.)\n\nSo when we are dealing with free entertainment, whether by permitting distribution of 16mm films to non-paying, non-theatrical audiences or theatreless towns, or with television, which is essentially an advertising method, in which entertainment is used as a channel for selling a product, the problem confronting the producers of motion pictures is that of retaining the customers who come from a common audience.\n\nJust as in the case of clearances and runs, the problem is to make such territorial and time restrictions upon the availability of the product as will protect the value of the license granted to the exhibitor.[24] In both instances the factors *94 which bear on reasonableness are numerous and involve the accommodation of a variety of apparently conflicting economic interests.[25]\n\nNo refusal to sell a product to customers similarly situated is involved. At most, there is restriction in the sale of competitive 16mm films which may reduce the custom of theatres for which motion pictures in standard size are primarily made. For as non-theatrical groups and television audiences may draw from the common pool of diversion-seekers, the restrictions protect the producers' main source of income. This protection may produce some assymetry, but this is inevitable in any classification.\n\nB. Some Business Consideration.\n\nCertain fundamental facts require assertion. The Producer-defendants cannot be compelled by decree of court to make 16mm versions of any of their productions. Two of the major producing companies, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Paramount, were not made parties to this action because they do not produce films of that dimension. We assume that as the backlog of old pictures and the copyrights to them are the private property of the producers, they could, if they so desired, entirely destroy the master negatives after a film has had its run. If this were done, no subsequent exploitation would be possible. And a Government which has sanctioned and compensated for curtailment or even destruction of food products could not complain of the use of similar methods for preventing a possible \"glutting\" of the film market.\n\nThe accessibility of 16mm films to distribution could not be absolute or unrestricted. At the argument, the Government conceded that a minimum time for full exploitation of motion pictures in 35mm films would have to be allowed before the 16mm versions were ordered marketed. The Government is, likewise, powerless to fix the prices for the exhibition of 16mm films. However, a court could decree (as was done in the consent decree here) that they should be obtainable at a reasonable price, because this is a norm valid in law, flexible and capable of exact ascertainment.[26]\n\nSo the problem, in the last analysis, is one of degree. The evidence shows that the policy of each of the producer-defendants as to 16mm films has not been static. On the contrary, it has been and still is fluid. This is especially true as to their attitude towards releasing 16mm feature films for telecasting. Granted that at the inception of television there may have been a policy of opposition to the use of 16mm films, there has been a gradual deviation from this rigid attitude. *95 The record in the case discloses the willingness of each of the producing defendants to consider proposals for use of feature films in television if the terms, including price, are reasonable and acceptable. Specific facts will appear further on in the discussion.\n\nA Government witness, General David Sarnoff, Chairman of the Board of Radio Corporation of America, which owns the National Broadcasting Company, very frankly summed up the difficulties engendered by the development of television and the need for material for its programs in a deposition offered by the Government. After referring to discussions had over the years with some motion picture producers about releasing pictures for general use in television, General Sarnoff stated:\n\n\"I had not supposed that a major motion picture company, making a feature film for distribution to theatres, could be expected to make that film available to a television station because of the economics of the situation in television to pay for a new feature film which might cost millions of dollars.\n\n\"I had a different feeling with respect to feature films already in the vaults and which were not being distributed to theatres.\n\n\"I want to make that distinction because I don't want to leave a false impression that I am publicly complaining against the motion picture industry for not making their new feature film available to television. I am making no such complaint. I am not complaining as to their pictures in their vaults, either. I am merely suggesting that I thought they were missing a good bet in their refusal to make those pictures available, and I thought that television was missing the opportunity to make those pictures available to the viewing public.\n\n\"I have understood and appreciated the fact that the motion picture producers have theaters to serve; they are their large and major customers, and that these motion picture theaters looked askance upon the motion picture producers making any of their pictures, old or new, available to this new arrival, television.\n\n\"So, when you take these factors into consideration in toto and strike a balance, I am not prepared to say that so far as the motion picture producers are concerned that their decision or their practice, or their wish, not to make the product of their vaults available to television, was necessarily false economics from their standpoint.\n\n\"They know their business better than I do, and therefore, if they felt that they shouldn't make them available on economic grounds, that was their business.\n\n\"Now, television has survived and it is thriving despite that, and as you know, in recent months, there has been a perceptible change of attitude on the part of some motion picture producers, and pictures are, in some instances, now being made available to television stations and networks. Not feature pictures, but shorter pictures, and pictures that these producers are making specifically for television.\n\n\"In fact, there is a rush to get on the wagon right now.\"\n\nThis witness, representing a competitor of both the producers and the exhibitors in the field of entertainment, while critical of the attitude of the motion picture producers, nevertheless saw a business justification for their practice. One fact is significant in his deposition. He saw, as did the various witnesses of the producers who testified in the case, the problem of price. And while he applied it only to current features, the testimony of others makes it evident that the problem exists so far as the so-called \"vault\" is concerned, that is, feature pictures which are on the shelves of the producers.\n\n*96 There is ample testimony in the record that the prices offered were minimal to start with but have been on the rise constantly. The time element is important, both from the standpoint of the price that may be secured, its effect on the general demand for motion pictures for theatrical purposes, and the possibility of reissue or remaking.\n\nIt may well be, as General Sarnoff said, that in some instances, the value of the backlog may diminish and that if colored television becomes the rule, black and white features may not be in great demand. But, in the last analysis, these facts must be borne in mind: Television is a new medium. Motion pictures antedated it by many decades. The motion pictures are produced primarily for theatrical exhibition. The theatre-goers are and have been the main source of the motion picture industry's custom. The motion picture or the public at large could not anticipate the rapid development which television has achieved. Reduction in price in less than a decade has brought television sets of excellent performance within the reach of everyone. Granted that the motion picture industry must anticipate and supply demand and that the practice of some restriction towards new demands may contravene the antitrust laws, the fact remains that in the matter of distribution, with which we are concerned here, to warrant the condemnation of restrictions as detrimental to the free flow of commerce which the antitrust laws are intended to protect, the situations to which the practices relate must be comparable. This is the test by which the legality of classification is judged generally and which has been applied to motion pictures.[27]\n\nAll cases justify the staggering of releases and reasonable differentiation as to runs between theatres depending on location, customers, price and the competitive position towards one another.\n\nAvailability is, in a sense, a form of \"staggered\" distribution. Clearances and runs stagger distribution by agreement with distributors; availability is a unilateral policy established by the producers through which films are made available generally after a certain definite period, which, in the case of RKO, was six months, and in the case of Fox and Warner, one year. Universal had no definite time policy. It evolved a pragmatic system in which the time element for availability conformed to no specific formula. It merely expressed the practice evolved by the men in charge of their 16mm distribution.\n\nAfter 1951 Warner distributed 16mm films through Films, Inc. While the time limitations were similar to those of other companies, they were not identical in all respects. And the evidence in the record shows that they were determined by the similarity of the problems involved. At times the longer periods were dictated by the factor of cost, despite the fact that they related to nontheatrical showings such as schools. The charge for showing was so insignificant that it was decided to use over and over again a small number of prints rather than print additional ones. In all, the injurious effect of the showing on the income to the producers from theatres was one of the considerations. Its validity as an economic reality cannot be impaired by calling it, as some of the agents of the producers did in correspondence, \"a protection\" from unfair competition. For, as already appears (II and V-A), such aim does not violate the antitrust laws. But while in the case of theatres the effect of other showings on revenues is only one of the elements to be considered, this element becomes all important when we are dealing with a medium like television which competes not only with a particular theatre, but with the whole *97 field. For any exhibition of 16mm films anywhere competes with the theatre.\n\nThe rapid development of television competition was not anticipated; and an industry is not expected to have prescience. More, it is not required to sacrifice its established custom in order to supply a late-comer in the field who is also a competitor. This is especially true when its production has been geared to the old customer, the motion picture theatre, for whom the production has been historically made, and distribution through whom is and has always been the main means for reimbursement of the cost of the product.\n\nC. Reissues.\n\nOne of the considerations governing the restrictive policy as to television is the loss of the value of motion picture reissues. An increasing practice in the industry in recent years has been to take a picture which had been in the vault for some time after a complete run and reissue it for the benefit of those who had not seen it. Witnesses for the defendants have testified that aside from the question of price, a rapid distribution of old pictures through television, even at an acceptable price, would destroy their value for reissuing and remaking purposes. Indicative of the revenue which lies in reissue is the fact that from June 1947 to early in 1955 Realart, which distributed reissues for Universal received as film rentals for feature films the sum of $20,835,218.17. Of this amount, Universal received as its net proceeds the sum of $6,816,429.84. A chart introduced on behalf of the defendant RKO indicates that the revenue from reissues is not only substantial, but that in some instances, it exceeds the income from the original. The following data culled from one of the exhibits show the income of RKO from reissues as contrasted with the income from the original distribution and the very minimal income from 16mm distribution:\n\nU.

Warner, in charge of production for Warner, to state that it is really impossible to fix a definite time beyond which a motion picture has no reissue value. The appeal of some of the pictures is perennial. Each new generation of children would wish to see Snow White, Bambi, Dumbo, Pinocchio, Wizard of Oz, Cinderella and others, just as different generations of adults may wish to see the jungle adventures of Tarzan and other adventure and action pictures.\n\nPictures with Indian and frontier background and the typical \"western\" depicting the hardships of the pioneer have a constant appeal to both young and old, because the western pioneering spirit has played so important a part in the development of our country.\n\nThe motion picture as a popular art is especially adapted to help the masses, in these days of \"mass culture\", identify themselves with the characters of the pictures, give them a sense of belonging and to aid them to relive vicariously a past which disappeared long ago.\n\nThe experience with reissues stands as proof of this fact. However, the destruction of the reissue value would entail other losses. It would affect adversely the value of the pictures for remaking purposes and would also force the motion picture producers to acquire other stories to replace the stories used in the old feature films. Remade films constitute a substantial percentage of the production of the five producing defendants, as is indicated by the following chart:\n\n*99 Comparison of Original and Remade Feature Film Productions to Total Feature Film Issues Five Companies 1946-1954 Issues Remade Features Remade Features Company Produced Produced Total as Percent as Percent Year Original Remade Total by Others Issues of Production of Issues 1946 142 18 160 22 182 11.3 9.9 1947 120 9 129 25 154 7.0 5.8 1948 117 6 123 52 175 4.9 3.4 1949 138 8 146 31 173 5.5 4.6 1950 146 6 152 33 185 3.9 3.2 1951 162 10 172 31 203 5.8 4.9 1952 145 6 151 31 182 4.0 3.3 1953 116 16 132 23 155 12.1 10.3 1954 101 8 109 35 144 7.3 5.6\n\n*100 The money value of the reissues is an important factor, as appears from the substantial income derived from the contract already referred to between Universal and Realart, relating to the reissue of a group of old pictures produced between 1933 and 1946. On a recent remake of \"Magnificent Obsession\" which, when originally issued in 1934, gave only a fair return, Universal has grossed over $5,000,000 to date from domestic distribution alone. The phenomenal success of a recent picture dealing with juvenile delinquency, \"Blackboard Jungle\", by one of the producer-defendants led to a revival by Universal of an old picture, \"City Across The River\", dealing with the same subject which is meeting with greater success than the original exploitation. Teamed with another picture on the same subject it has grossed in excess of $150,000 in ten or twelve weeks of exhibition in theatres.\n\nThe value of the stories from which the pictures are made was stressed in the testimony of Jack L. Warner, Vice-President of Warner, in charge of the production of films, and others, who stated that in the light of present market conditions some of the stories from which old pictures were made and to which the producers have absolute right have a value as high as $500,000. This would be an important item of cost saved should the company decide to remake a picture or to produce a musical version of it as was done successfully by Warner and others with similar properties.\n\nThe release of the old version of the picture to television would result in the loss to the producer of this residual value also. In the light of this it can be well understood why producers like Warner and others are of the view that no arbitrary time limit can be established at which the residual value becomes minimal or has been wholly dissipated. Nor is it possible to choose between pictures with any accuracy. To the question \"Is it possible for you now to tell which of your older films have remake values and which do not?\" Warner answered:\n\n\"Well, I could most everyone of them have, according to the time, the tenor of the public, the susceptibility of the people. It is a showmanship feeling whether you can or cannot remake a story.\n\n\"For example, I will give you the name of a story, Saratoga Trunk by Edna Ferber. We made that into a film that was highly successful. We have the right to make that picture as a musical version. That has been done time and time again where you use a book or a play and you make it first as a dramatic or comedy film, and then one, two, three, four, five years, ten years, sometimes 15 years later you may make it as a musical version, which is a common practice in the theatre, as well as in film. Therefore, you have a ready property in a manuscript form which would probably sometimes cost you two, three, four hundred thousand dollars, in the market of today as high as a million, to buy the proper story or a play. And, again, there is a big percentage that they receive today now. In addition, a man with a good book or play, there isn't any limit to what he can get. We have just been through it with pictures like Mr. Roberts, and many, many more, I won't go into them now, where we give tremendous percentages to the authors and the producers of the stage plays and the novels.\n\n\"If we would get rid of this film at a very early date, we would find that we couldn't use that again, because the complete value would be lost. I feel I am speaking from experience and the tenor of the public.\"\n\nSignificant also are his answers to two succeeding questions:\n\n\"Q. Do you feel that the showing of a film of that kind on television would make it unsuitable for remake? A. It wouldn't make it unsuitable, but it would lose its complete commercial value, or a great degree of it, which wouldn't make it worthwhile for us to remake it, I don't think.\n\n*101 \"Q. What about re-issues? A. About the same problem, the same thing. There isn't any reason for us, if we did sell a feature of some kind, whether important or not to important, to television you can imagine if you had to remake that again and advertise to the public it is coming back to X theatre, I don't think you would get very much of an audience.\"\n\nSo while the range of prices now being paid by television for feature pictures may be approaching the average income for reissues, the loss of the stories for remaking purposes, and the need for their replacement by new stories to be acted in by the same or other actors, are not compensable by the income from the televising of features. Statistical data in the record confirm this. On the whole, the reissue value is, as one witness stated, \"unpredictable\".\n\nSome of the data bearing on the subject were compiled only recently. However, the oral testimony referred to and that of others in the record indicates that while each of the producing companies may not have had the benefit of the computation as to the others, and, in some instances, the benefit of its own exact computation, they were fully cognizant of the facts as they affected the industry, such as (a) the value of reissues, (b) the destruction of the stories and of the motion picture personalities, and others, and that the problems which they created were constantly before them. The more exact statistical data lend strength to their reaction to the business and economic factors which the distribution of 16mm pictures entailed. And, in all cases of this character, justification may be found in economic facts if they were apprehended by the industry, even though not reduced to mathematical or statistical form.\n\nAnother compelling consideration is the fact that writers, actors and musicians, either personally or through their unions, are making demands for additional payments from revenues derived from television exhibition of motion pictures. As early as March 16, 1948, Screen Actors' Guild gave notice to all the motion picture producers that no motion picture produced after that date could be exhibited on television without additional compensation to the actors. The notice stated:\n\n\"Screen Actors' Guild, Inc., takes the position that no producer has the legal right to sell or use for television any motion picture film made for theatre exhibition.\n\n\"In our continuing negotiations this will be an important subject. We feel it only fair that you should know that the Guild will take the position in such negotiations that film made for motion picture theatre exhibition may not be used for television without compensation to the actors, to be agreed upon between us as part of a collective bargaining agreement.\"\n\nThe Screen Writers' and Screen Directors' Guilds have taken a similar attitude. Provisions recognizing the right to seek additional compensation have been inserted into subsequent contracts.\n\nThe Musicians' Union sought recognition of their right to compensation retroactively for all television showings of any motion pictures regardless of age. There was testimony that the defendants considered the demands onerous. Each has tried to deal with the problem in its own way. Columbia decided to remake some pictures for television with other artists. RKO considered and finally made a sale in bulk in which a definite sum could be agreed upon as compensation to guild members for television purposes.[28] As to others, the problem is *102 still open, to be determined finally whenever their feature films are released to television.\n\nD. Decline in Number of Theatres and Attendance.\n\nThe matters just adverted to and their impact upon the thinking of the producers must be equated with another factor which appears in the record, i. e., the actual decline, both in the number of motion picture theatres and the attendance in them.\n\nThere was testimony on the part of the defendants that thousands of motion picture theatres closed in the postwar years, from 1945 to 1954, and that many of the remaining were operating part time only. A Government exhibit confirming this fact was introduced in evidence on rebuttal and is here reproduced:\n\nNumber of Motion Picture Theaters in the United States as of the End of Each Year 1945 Through 1954 Four Wall Total Year Theaters Drive-Ins Theaters 1954 15,039 4,062 19,101 1953 14,174 3,791 17,965 1952 15,347 3,276 18,623 1951 16,150 2,830 18,980 1950 16,904 2,202 19,106 1949 17,367 1,203 18,570 1948 17,575 820 18,395 1947 18,059 548 18,607 1946 18,719 300 19,019 1945 20,355 102 20,457\n\nThere was also placed in the record a compilation showing the decline in motion picture admissions as contrasted with the comparative increase of television sets in use from 1946 to 1954:\n\nComparison of Changes in Weekly Motion Picture Attendance and Number of Television Sets-in-Use by Two Year Intervals, 1946 Through 1954 (all data are in millions) Weekly Motion Years Picture Admissions[1] Sets-in-Use[2] 1946-1948 - 12.5 + 0.2 XXXX-XXXX - 6.2 + 3.8 1950-1952 - 6.1 +11.8 1952-1954 - 6.1 +12.0\n\nOn the basis of these tables it was argued that the mortality in what are denominated \"four-wall\" theatres was compensated by the increase in drive-in theatres during the period. In view of the known increase in the population of *103 the United States during the period the rise in the number of drive-in theatres cannot be treated as compensatory. Even if the number of new drive-ins equaled the theatres closed, and the admitted fact that some of the theatres were operating part of the time only, were disregarded, we would still have a case of stagnation instead of growth. Of course, the number of theatres might remain constant although the theatre attendance might increase. But the table just reproduced discloses that there has been a decline in theatre attendance during the same period. This decline was at its height in the years 1946-1948. It reached -6.2 millions in 1948-1950 and has continued at about that rate to the present time. By contrast, increase in television sets was greatest during the years of stabilization of the decline in attendance.\n\nIt cannot be disputed that the decline which reached its apex in 1946-1948 has continued at a lower pattern to the present time, and is substantial. The producers and others who testified for them have related it to the rise of television. Giving full scope to the views of the Government witness who compiled and testified to the charts relating to the decline, the most favorable inference that can be drawn is that the highest decline having taken place before the full development of television and having decreased during the years of television's greatest growth, other causes than television may be responsible for the distress of the motion picture theatres and the fall in attendance. The significant fact, however, is not so much the curve of the decline but that (a) it existed and still exists, (b) that it is substantial, (c) that it affected the income of the producers, and (d) that the producers believed that it intensified the problems created by television.\n\nIn the circumstances, whether television was or was not the sole or even the primary cause for the condition is not our main concern. At the least it aggravated a non-desirable business situation. As such it was a factor of the type which, as already appears (V-A), the courts have recognized as warranting restrictive practices to protect income.\n\nVI\n\nWatchful Waiting\n\nIn what precedes we have stated the various business requirements, economic considerations, characteristics of the market and other factors which motivated the individual defendants in establishing the restrictions on the distribution of 16mm films.\n\nA. Hesitation to Deal.\n\nThe time and territorial limitations on distribution of 16mm films to theatrical and non-theatrical distributors were warranted by the economic realities of the situation involved. As said by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit:\n\n\"The regulation of distribution was required by the nature of the product and by the economic and social forces prevailing in the particular area.\"[29]\n\nAs to television the policy of the producer-defendants was one of \"watchful waiting\". Representatives of several television concerns testified that feature films were not generally obtainable. Much of this testimony was based on hearsay impressions as to the producers' policy. One Government witness admitted that he had not tried to obtain films from any of the major companies \"because the general impression in the entire field is that it would be a useless thing to do.\"\n\nIn contrast, there is testimony on behalf of the producers (to be detailed further *104 on in the discussion) that no offer at what they considered a \"reasonably acceptable\" price was ever made and refused. Even Government witnesses admitted that some negotiations broke down because of disagreement as to price. One engaged in a private business may decline to offer to trade or to trade altogether.[30]\n\nThe Clayton Act recognizes the right to select one's \"own customers in bona fide transactions\".[31] The defendants exercised such choice as to 16mm customers, in order to protect their income from established customers. As said by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit:\n\n\"It seems to this Court quite natural that the distributors would not be prone to substitute an unknown customer for a proven one. This Court cannot see how the preference of one exhibitor over another is, per se, a combination in restraint of trade. Indeed, every `exclusive' contract has that effect.\"[32]\n\nUp to the date of the filing of the complaint in this case, July 22, 1952, and since, the producer-defendants have taken the view that the promulgation of the definitive policy should await the fuller development of television and the rise in prices being paid for feature pictures, as contrasted with those paid for theatrical exhibitions.\n\nOn June 27, 1950 the sales manager of Columbia wrote to its President:\n\n\"Harry, in closing, my thinking in this matter is that if we decide we want to release film for television such film on which we have the rights to release we can do it much better for a much better price at a later date than we can now. More television stations are being continuously built, and the more television stations that are built the bigger your market becomes for any given picture or pictures, that is obvious.\n\n\"Commander McDonald claims there will never be enough film to fill the needs of television. He goes even further and claims that the television need for the future will be greater for film than the need of theatres. Of course, that is his thinking, but I can understand when one realizes all the hours that these stations are on the air how much film they can actually use up.\n\n\"I would think, and I believe it is the general thinking of all of us here, that our inventory becomes more valuable as far as television is concerned instead of less valuable, but I repeat that it all bears watching and continuous thinking as to when and how, and at the same time give reasonable protection to the theatres which are the main source of our income and I believe will be for many years.\"\n\nThe same letter stresses the reissue value:\n\n\"As far as serials are concerned, Harry, in my opinion it would be foolish for us to release serials for television purposes because we have just reissued a serial to the theatres, Wild Bill Hicock, which will gross for us in the United States something between $250/300,000, and that is much more money than we can get at this time for five or six serials being sold for direct use on television.\"\n\nIn a letter dated July 18, 1950 occasioned by the sale of a group of serials by Universal, the same writer, Abe Montague, stated:\n\n\"We believe if we can get $12,500 for the negative and film of serials *105 for which our rights have expired, that at a later date when there are more television stations operating and more television sets in the homes in America we should be able to get a much better price. I feel you will agree that this seems logical and unless the Government puts on certain restrictions on material that is used in the development of television, there must be a greater number of television stations operating in the near future and, of course, a vast number of more homes that will have television sets.\"\n\nOn August 7 and 8, 1951, at a meeting in Chicago of the officers and officials of Columbia, the impact of television on the motion picture industry was made one of the chief topics of discussion. The conclusion finally reached was that (a) the low price then obtainable for televising motion pictures, (b) the demands of the craft organizations, the Actors' Guild, The Directors' Guild, the American Federation of Musicians and IATSE and other unions, for additional compensation, and (c) the company's direct production and exhibition of motion pictures for television, required the continuance of the policy of \"watchful waiting\" as to the backlog. This meant, as one of the witnesses put it, that it was deemed to be the best business policy to reserve the library for future use, because of the conviction that the greater earning potential lay in the future. Subsequent events confirmed the correctness of the view, as the data already given as to profits from reissues indicate clearly (V-C). At the time (1951) others shared the view that production for theatres was the sole profitable exploitation in sight. B. B. Kahane, a Columbia executive, reported to the meeting just referred to:\n\n\"Despite the fact that TV has seriously affected our business and as it grows and develops may affect us more and more, it would seem that for the present and the unforeseeable future, making pictures for theatres and not for TV offers the only opportunity for profit. * * *\n\n\"Every possible avenue and means must be explored and we must move as rapidly as we can but always bearing in mind that for the present our business is producing and selling pictures for the theatres.\"\n\nA resume of the proceedings at the meeting indicates that these and other considerations resulted in the determination to leave the problem of distribution to television of the diminutive versions fluid, as it had been in the past:\n\n\"2. Release of Columbia productions to television Mr. Cohn and Mr. Silverberg read memoranda from Samuels and Tatum on this subject which was supplemented by a report by Abe Montague and some additional information by myself. In addition, an analysis of the potential television value of Columbia product made by Mr. B. B. Kahane was also read, the sum total of which was that the value of this product in the television market might be as much as $65,000,000. This estimate was slightly higher than some of our own and the pros and cons of releasing pictures to television were discussed. Point was made that with regard to the better Columbia product, the residual value in this product was worth more today from the theatre market than the television market, and that by reissuing these pictures to theatres we ran into no danger of destroying exhibition.\n\n\"With regard to some of the cheap, old pictures, particularly the westerns, it was stated that here too the reissue value of these pictures was considerable and that as soon as Columbia stopped making series westerns, we could live for a long time on the reissue values of the old pictures. However, the Television Department reported on the progress of its experimental editing of two old westerns and stated that within *106 a very short time prints of these two experiments would be available for consideration by managements. It may be that we will decide to release some of the very old pictures in this form.\n\n\"It was also pointed out that the various forms of subscription television such as phonovision, skiatron and telemeter might very well materially increase the value of all old product on television, and that if we release our pictures now to free television we would lose any possibility of this much greater revenue in the future. The whole question of releasing old product to television was resolved in the following manner:\n\n\"The Television Dept. and the Sales Dept. will continue to watch the progress in this field and will report from time to time of any significant changes. If it ever becomes feasible on the basis of this information and the activities of other major companies, we will consider the question.\"\n\nThese expressions are typical. Their value stems from the fact that they are contemporary memorials made for the use of the company and placed in their file without an eye to any possible future litigation. Indeed, the Government at the final argument, stressed the importance of such statements in this case which it denominated a \"documentary case\". The documents referred to and similar ones relating to other defendants show that the producers were watching the market and the action of one another with the view of determining the proper time for the adoption of a definitive policy as to release of feature films for television.\n\nThe situation was summed up at the trial by Columbia's sales manager, Abe Montague, whose contemporaneous statements have already been referred to, in these words:\n\n\"This business is a very highly competitive business. We are in competition with our competitors continuously. We are often forced to change our policies, because they do not work out as well as we had hoped for, because our competitor has established something that is better and has been able to promote it. So we have a constant watching in this business, particularly, of what your competitor is doing, and weighing it in every way.\"\n\nB. Sales and Production for Television.\n\nAt the same time some of the companies were releasing for television feature motion pictures which they had produced or in which they had an interest. Columbia, in 1954, released to television 16 westerns, 100 to 150 cartoons and some English pictures. In 1955 the company released 72 additional westerns. It has continued to offer to television a limited number of other pictures. The attached table shows the pictures made available to television in which Fox had an interest and the profits derived from such release:\n\n*107 Television Statistics Period Gross Expenses Distribution Net to Licensed of Release from Stations Deductible Fee Producers 12/17/52 18 Wurtzels 28 months $587,809.32 $30,632.70 $137,494.16 $209,841.23 Average per picture to 4/30/55 32,656.07 1,701.82 7,638.56 11,657.85 4/22/53 21 Charlie Chans 23 months 408,283.99 33,353.96 91,732.51 141,598.76 Average per picture to 7/31/55 19,442.09 1,588.28 4,368.21 6,742.80 4/22/53 23 English (Major) 23 months 154,919.19 17,228.22 33,822.74 51,934.11 Average per picture to 7/31/55 6,735.62 749.05 1,470.55 2,258.00 2/5/53 28 English (Gail) 28 months 367,189.40 28,552.43 91,797.37 123,419.74 Average per picture to 8/31/55 13,113.91 1,019.73 3,278.48 4,407.85 4/22/53 1 English 24 months 20,341.38 1,880.83 4,615.14 13,845.41 Uncensored to 8/31/55 Note In all situations shown above, except English Uncensored, the net to producer is one-half of the proceeds after deduction of expenses and distribution fee. For Uncensored, the producer receives all income after deduction of expenses and distribution fee. Advances have been made as follows: Wurtzel - $250,000.00 Charlie Chans - 180,000.00 English (Major) - 100,000.00 English (Gail) - 120,000.00 English Uncensored - -0- The above figures represent accumulations from first release to the specific dates in 1955 shown in the \"Period Of Release\" column.\n\n*108 Another defendant, RKO, began negotiations in 1951 with two national television networks, Columbia Broadcasting System and National Broadcasting Company, for the sale of its entire library of pictures on a bulk basis or for joint exploitation on a profit sharing basis. No satisfactory agreement could be reached although these negotiations covered long periods of time and continued up to July 1955 when control of the company and of its assets, including its library, was sold to persons interested primarily in the distribution of motion pictures for television. At the present time, Universal is negotiating for release to television of old westerns and other pictures.\n\nIn the meantime, some of the defendants have begun to produce and distribute directly motion pictures for television. The program as to the defendant Columbia, which began experimentally as far back as 1947, has reached a stage where, through Screen Gems, its wholly owned subsidiary, some 600 or 750 motion picture feature programs have been made for and exhibited on television in addition to short news and other programs. These pictures are produced in one of the studios on the Columbia lot and their distribution is direct, by means of \"national sales\" and \"syndication sales\" through eight special sales offices.\n\nIn 1952 the Board of Directors of Universal approved the establishment of a unit for the production by the company of pictures direct for television. This called for the production by the end of the calendar year of five complete series each consisting of thirteen units, at an aggregate cost of $1,287,000, or an average cost of approximately $20,000 for each unit. The first series was produced at a cost of $300,000. The venture proved disastrous. The series was sold for $15,000 and the project was never completed. Warner is also producing and distributing its own feature programs for television. Although some of their officers who testified in the case expressed doubt as to the future of the venture, this recent development indicates that the producers are still trying to meet the problems which free television has posed. It tends to justify their \"wait and see\" policy. For, in view of its possibilities, the potential value and the residual value of the backlog have been enhanced. And the most ardent advocates of pure competition have not gone to the romantic length of asserting that the owner of a copyright-protected product who may desire to market it himself must make it available to competitive distributors rather than hold the product in reserve for distribution by himself in its original or modified form. No principle of law would sanction such an attitude. Were it so it might, with equal cogency, be contended that a book publisher could be compelled by court decree to place at the disposal of the cutrate book trade for sale as \"remainders\", at reduced prices, the books on his shelves for which sales by regular book sellers at regular prices are stagnating.\n\nC. The Testimony of Spyros Skouras.\n\nIt would unduly extend this opinion if we were to outline the testimony offered as to each of the defendants as to the origin of the restrictive policies of which the Government complains. The summaries already given indicate the attitude of the producers towards the problem and the considerations which led to its formulation. However, because of his position in the industry, his lifelong association with both motion picture production and theatre ownership and the thoroughness with which he analyzed the problem, the testimony of Mr. Spyros Skouras given at the trial best expresses the business motivations for the policy. It is, therefore, given in outline.\n\nMr. Skouras has been connected with the motion picture industry since 1914. He and his brothers began as owners of a single theatre in St. Louis, Mo., which later developed into a national chain. They still operate motion picture theatres in New York. Since 1942 Mr. Skouras has been the President of Fox. He *109 summed up the general policy of his company with respect to licensing feature films for television in this manner:\n\n\"We have been opposing, because we felt it will create an injury to our economic structure, because we could not receive the price that will compensate for the loss that we will sustain from our regular customers, the theatres.\n\n\"Frankly, to this day I was never approached by any important officer of any of the networks to negotiate seriously a proposition that could be given consideration. Always have in mind the necessity of an inventory of 55 to sixty million dollars annually, the live inventory, and we had to be as cautious as possible to protect the main source of our income, and they are the theatres in the United States and Canada and in the entire world.\"\n\nAfter referring to the fact that when a picture is released it takes sixty-five weeks to be completely amortized he gave the essential facts which motivated his company's attitude towards television in these words:\n\n\"The television offers its product gratis. Our customers charge admission, and the market prices that they were offering to us, they were so inconsequential that the reissues quite often will gross, oh, eight to ten times the certain prices they were offering to us. * * *\n\n\"In our setup from time to time we have independent producers, and some of our independent producers, they insisted that there are films to be sold to television after their circulation was completed in the theatres. These films, and a number of films that we brought from Great Britain, that we made in the United Kingdom to meet the market requirements, and only a few of those films were exhibited in the United States.\n\n\"Now, together, the independent films and the Charlie Chan films, which belonged to us exclusively, and these British made films by us, there were about 100 films, they brought less income than one single reissue. For instance, since 1946 the income from reissues and from films that quite often circulate after they are four years old, in nine and a half years brought almost $20,000,000 income. \"Now, no one ever approached me to offer me anything like that sum of money. * * *\n\n\"At no time the networks approached, at least, Twentieth Century-Fox to offer us sufficient money on a prime time. The impression we received from the inquiry from insignificant sources, not from the important people of the industry, they offered us off time, and not the prime time.\n\n\"Otherwise they wanted to use an important industry, who is rendering great services, beyond that of the common man point of view, also from an information point of view, on the worst scale, as a makeshift to build up an industry, and to sell through advertisements, to see other products, so the motion picture industry would become an instrument of merchandising other people's products.\"\n\nHe concluded by stating that at the prices offered the sale of the motion picture features to television would amount to \"dissipating\" the assets of his company, and \"that the prices offered by television would not offset the loss in theatre revenues.\" To the question \"Of what importance to you are the theatre revenues?\" he answered:\n\n\"That is our existence. The theatres are our main outlets. And in order to give you an idea, whether you take films of 10 years ago or presently, a picture like The Robe has already grossed in the United States over $16,000,000, and in the overseas market $7,000,000, and only about 25 per cent of the overseas market is affected. Now, if you give *110 that production gratis, it loses its value.\n\n\"Now, let me take a lesser film, Three Coins in a Fountain. Three Coins in a Fountain ultimately will gross in the United States over $6,000,000.\n\n\"We just released a film with Clark Gable, The Tall Men. It will gross in the United States over $5,000,000.\n\n\"Our smallest pictures, their income since Cinemascope exceeds over a million dollars. I think out of 44 pictures, six pictures will be less than a million and a half, the balance will be over a million and a half, in the United States and Canada. \"As I said before, the reissue of some of these films supply us an income of two million dollars a year average from 1946 to date.\n\n\"Also another important factor, before last night I saw a wonderful production, The Rains of Ranchipur, which was a remake of The Rains Came of Louis Bromfield's famous bestseller. If you sell that to television, you dissipate the value of that wonderful property.\n\n\"We would gladly pay at the present value of the market, for a property of that type, as high as half a million dollars.\n\n\"We are making three to four films a year of old subjects. As a whole, television it is inconceivable that tomorrow if the jet planes develop, that the automobile industry should be devoted for the exclusive promotion of the jet planes to the detriment of the automobile industry. The motion picture industry and the television industry, they are two distinct and separate instrumentalities. They both serve the community equally as well, but they serve it upon their own resources. They complement each other, they cooperate with each other, we need each other, but we should not sacrifice each other for the development of the other. And that is what we would have done if we would have made our films available at very insignificant prices, and to exhibit it to the world gratis.\n\n\"The impact of television was so violent that the box office declined to such an extent that almost 6500 theatres closed their doors within three years' time.\n\n\"During this period I received letters from the Middle West, from many old friends who lost their theatres. People that owned two and three theatres. Their families and their children, that was their life, that was their career, and their theatres closed. Now, that was a tremendous impact of television on the motion picture industry.\n\n\"The Court: Having given us that background, will you please answer directly the question? With that as a history, can you tell us what in your opinion would happen to a small exhibitor generally, not in a particular instance, if you adopted a general policy of quick distribution of motion pictures to television, omitting the value of re-makes and re-issues, of which you have already told us.\n\n\"The Witness: Definitely the majority of the small theatres of America would close their doors. At least eight to ten thousand.\n\n\"Q. By Mr. Mitchell: What is the margin of profit of the small theatre? A. Presently?\n\n\"Q. Yes. A. It is very small, Mr. Mitchell. Since television the theatre profits in the small theatres is a struggling industry. If it was not for the government to reduce the admission tax many more theatres would have been closed.\n\n\"Also the development of the wide screen, such as Cinemascope of the Twentieth Century-Fox people, plays such a great part. It revived interest of the people to go to the movies. It helps somewhat, but not *111 sufficient that we can say that the small theatres of America can be saved if the entertainment that they sell with admission later on is offered to the public gratis.\n\n\"Q. How would the closing of these small theatres affect your revenues? A. Very substantially, to the point that we would be in the red.\n\n\"Q. This policy of Twentieth Century-Fox with respect to licensing feature films to television, was that either adopted or carried out because of any request or pressure from exhibitor organizations, or exhibitors? A. The exhibitors and exhibitor organizations, yes, they tried their utmost to influence, but I did not permit to be influenced by high pressure. We used our best judgment. For instance, when some of our independent producers needed the income from the television, we sold them. And when we, ourselves, before the introduction of Cinemascope, needed some income to improve our profit and loss statement, we sold some of our pictures ourselves, and we so announced it.\"\n\nD. Additional Corroborative Facts.\n\nThe testimony just given exemplifies the attitude and the prudent and pragmatic business motivations of each of the producer-defendants. The summaries preceding it relate chiefly to defendants RKO, Fox and Columbia. However, there is similar evidence in the record as to the other two defendants, Warner and Universal. Some of it has already been given in outline.\n\nNo useful purposes would be served by any additional or more extensive summation of this cumulative evidence here. However, certain comparative charts prepared by the defendants are good summations of the actions of each of the companies as to the matters with which we are concerned in this case. While to some extent repetitious, they are reproduced here because they place in succinct juxtaposition the policies of the producer-defendants. The first of these is a comparison of the negotiations and sales of feature films to television.\n\n*112 Comparison of Defendants' Negotiations and Sales of Feature Films to Television Company 1948-1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 RKO Various attempts Negotiations Negotiations Various Negotiations Sale of to with CBS with attempts with RKO to sell groups for entire Fox & to sell Baird, General of features backlog Hyman Stanley Teleradio Warner, Paramount, National Theatres, General Teleradio & NBC Columbia Attempted to Licensed Licensed 72 sell 2 recut, 16 features features; experimental Negotiations features with NBC Twentieth Licensed Licensed Century 18 Wurtzel 21 Fox features Charlie Chan's & 52 English features Warner Negotiated Bros. for sale of older features Universal 1948: Negotiations Weintraub with CBS to deal for 97 sell 72 features features; 1949: Negotiations Negotiations with with NBC to Hyman for sell 70 Rank 8 features films Republic Released Released Released over 100 104 features more features features\n\n*113 Another compares the defendants' 16mm programs and the methods of their distribution as of 1952:\n\nComparison of Defendants' 16mm Programs as of 1952 Year Commenced 16mm Method by Which Company Distribution Film Distributed Locations Served RKO 1938 RKO 35mm exchanges Schools, shut-ins, churches, camps, and theaterless towns and theatrical locations not in competition with any 35mm theaters.

Shut-ins, schools Bros. and theaterless towns not in competition with any 35mm theaters. No churches. Universal 1927 United World All Locations, including (Universal subsidiary) homes, not in competition with 35mm theaters.\n\n*114 A third chart complements the one just given by illustrating graphically what already appears from the preceding discussion (V-A and B), namely, that, despite some similarity, there was no identity in the time or territorial limitations as to the various locations or as to the approval and rejection methods practiced:\n\nComparison of Defendants' 16mm Programs as of 1952 Location Approval[*] Non- Availability Company Theatrical Theatrical Shut-Ins Schools Others RKO Prior approval Prior approval 6 months 18 months 18 months by branch by branch manager. manager and RKO Home Office.

Twentieth Prior approval by Twentieth 9 months 18 months 12 months Century Century Fox. Fox Warner Prior approvals by Warner 9 months 18 months 12 months Bros. Bros. Universal No prior approval. Prior approval 6 months 18 months 18 months by Universal.\n\nAnd finally, a chart shows the lack of uniformity even in the practice as to drive-in theatres, roadshow men and merchants' free shows:\n\nComparison of Defendants' 16mm Policies on Drive-Ins, Roadshowmen, and Merchant Free Shows Merchant Company Drive-Ins Roadshowmen Free Shows RKO Yes No No Columbia Yes Yes Yes Twentieth Century Fox No No No Warner Bros. Yes Yes No Universal Pre-1950 Yes Yes No Post-1950 Sometimes\n\n*115 These additional data confirm the fact already apparent from the preceding exposition, that whatever similarity existed in the underlying policy was caused by the identity in the conditions to which it was applied (V-A). Which brings us back to the main problem, release of 16mm feature motion picture films to television.\n\nThe Government has characterized the entire policy of the producers as to 16mm distribution as \"a boycott\" against certain types of exhibition. I cannot agree. Nor can I agree with the Government's contention that it is the duty of the motion picture producers to supply television with the entertainment material which it needs. It is not the function of a private industry to supply its product to a newly-arisen customer who is also a competitor and jeopard its interest in the continued existence of its old customers for whom the standard product is primarily made. After all, television is a new field, the phenomenal rise of which could not be anticipated. It was designed for a distinct and different form of entertainment which still supplies its main programs.\n\nBecause original entertainment material is costly and consumed and destroyed rapidly, television desires to supplement it by using motion pictures. But it does not offer to do so on terms commensurate or comparable with those which established theatres pay for the standard product. Instead of competing for the product, it demands special terms. For valid business reasons and because the entire 16mm business is a marginal by-product, motion picture producers have been unable to agree to television's terms, except in some specific instances. It would be inequitable to force agreement, especially when reluctance, or even refusal to deal (assuming that there was refusal), was not only the result of separate determination by each company, but was temporary, was dictated by the sound economics of the situation, the wish to make the most desirable arrangements consistent with a fair protection of their interests and the refusal of the lately-arrived customer, the television industry,to commit itself to definite guarantees. Both sides seem to have been playing for position. To some extent, they still are. If, for this reason, interstate trade lags temporarily, the fact is proof of the vigor of the competitive spirit, even within an oligopolistic field.[33]\n\nIn my view, the actions of the defendants do not exceed the limits of choice of, or preference in, dealing allowed by law to one engaged in a private enterprise for profit. And the fact that the resulting act was the same as to all defendants does not spell concerted action or conspiracy. As said by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit:\n\n\"This action * * * does not prove or tend to prove that it was done by agreement * * * any more than proof that a hound is chasing a fox is evidence that the chase is by agreement with the fox.\"[34] (Emphasis added.)\n\nIt should be added that the entire policy of the producers as to 16mm films ante-dated any action, agitation or \"pressure\" (as the Government calls it), on the part of the trade organizations, TOA, Allied, or others named as co-conspirators. And, as fully appears from the preceding discussion,it has been conducted at times in defiance of their opposition (IV-B and D). The occasional approval, after their occurrence, of phases of this policy, by some of the *116 named organizations cannot turn the independent, and, at times, dissimilar acts of the producers into an agreement or conspiracy with them.\n\nVII\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\n\"* * * But the legality of an agreement or regulation cannot be determined by so simple a test, as whether it restrains competition. Every agreement concernning trade, every regulation of trade, restrains. To bind, to restrain, is of their very essence. The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant facts. This is not because a good intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but because knowledge of intent may help the court to interpret facts and to predict consequences.\"[35] (Emphasis added.) \"* * * Certainly even in those areas of economic activity where the play of private forces has been subjected only to the negative prohibitions of the Sherman Law, 15 U.S.C.A. § 1 et seq., this Court has not held that competition is an absolute. See Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 38 S. Ct. 242, 62 L. Ed. 683.\"[36]\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\nWhat has gone before foreshadows the conclusion reached. However, in an opinion of this length, it is well to give in summary the ul"
