        "text": "originally serialised in the Saturday Evening Post, the fictional Hawaiian detective Charlie Chan has appeared in a variety of media, including books, films, radio programs, comics, and television shows. Both the character and the resulting franchise have also generated a steady wave of critical analysis. From Eugene Franklin Wong’s (1978) landmark study of Asian stereotypes in American media to Jessica Hagedorn’s (1993) literary anthology that infamously declared Chan Is Dead, to Yunte Huang’s (2010) biographical investigation of the real Honolulu detective behind the character, academic debate about the representation of Chan’s Chinese heritage on page and on screen has remained both abundant and animated. It has also repeatedly fallen victim to two traps. First, limiting an analysis of Chan’s representation to just the page and screen ignores the full scope of the character’s transmedia reach. For example, as Jonathan Gray argues, merchandising not only diversifies a franchise’s ...\n\nIn this dissertation, I analyzed how East Asian (American) and Southeast Asian characters were characterized in the 2018 Hollywood film, Crazy Rich Asians (CRA), and argued, that the film was covertly racist towards Asians in its representations. I have done this with the help of Said’s (1978) theories of Orientalism and the notion of intertextuality as well as Hall’s (2013; 1995) theories of representation, discourse and ideological sustainment in media. In the literature review, I demonstrated that anti-Asiatic racism has existed in various cultural and academic productions throughout the history of Asian immigration to the West and the history of Western intervention and invasion in Asia. In doing so, I showed (1) that the anti-Asiatic racism embedded in socio-political sphere could influence the representations of Asians even when the government does not approve it, and (2) that the racist representations of Asians were transformed from \"coolie\" to \"model minority\" due to the gradual but significant changes in socio-political climate. Through my analysis and discussion of CRA, I argued that implicit racism was implemented through “Orientalist/Assimilationist paradigm” (McAlister, 1992 cited by Yin, 2005), a narrative pattern also used for a previous Hollywood film, The Joy Luck Club (1993). In addition, I illustrated how \"good Chinese\" and \"bad Chinese\" characters in CRA were associated with \"good Euro-American\" and \"bad Asian\" values, thereby implicitly creating \"racial\" and cultural hierarchy.\n\nIn America’s polyglot melting pot, that ethnically mixed dreamland of diversity soured by the realities of white supremacy, gems of crystallized culture dot the nation’s major cities, in the form of Little Italies, barrios, and Chinatowns. For immigrant families and their progeny, these spaces act as communal refuges; for naturalized residents (in essence, white people), they act as a space of transaction between the familiarities of home and the exotic oddities of the unknown. These districts are marked by traces of the segregated ghettoes of post-Ellis Island New York; a world not necessarily intended for Western infiltration yet surrounded by its inevitable contact, vis-a-vis local and international tourism. This makes Chinatown an ideal cinematic fishbowl for matters of representation, dual identity, citizenship, immigration and assimilation, constructing a palpable “predicament of boundary”. These themes are at the heart of both Cheng’s and Feng’s writings on these films, and at the heart of Asian American theory. Exemplary usage of this backdrop is found in the Chinatown settings of Flower Drum Song (1961) and Chan Is Missing (1982), both of which make a strong, multigenerational political statement that contributes to the legacy of Asian American cinema and the politics of identity onscreen."
