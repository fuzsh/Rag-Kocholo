        "text": "Caftan Woman's Choice: One for November on TCM\n\nDirector Anthony Mann had the noir touch. It was evident in his early films such as Strangers in the Night, Two O'Clock Courage and The Great Flamarion, blossoming in the late 40s with T-Men, He Walked by Night and Side Street and highlighting his exemplary 50s westerns such as Winchester '73 and Devil's Doorway.\n\nBorder Incident, released by MGM in 1949, fits in with the cycle of procedural crime dramas popular at the time. Quickly the premise of exposing the murder and exploitation of illegal migrant farm labourers (Braceros) from Mexico is established with a daring under cover operation involving both Mexican and American agencies. Ricardo Montalban as Pablo Rodriguez will pose as a man desperate to enter the States. George Murphy (Bataan, Tom Dick and Harry) as Jack Bearns will be tracking and baiting the greedy men behind the organized crime.\n\nRicardo Montalban\n\n1920 - 2009\n\nTCM is presenting Border Incident as part of a birthday salute to Ricardo Montalban on the occasion of his late November birthdate. Born in Mexico, Montalban moved to Los Angeles to live with an older brother while in his teens and began a stage career as he entered his 20s. Returning to Mexico he found work in films there which brought him to the attention of MGM who touted him as a \"latin lover\" with his debut in the Technicolor Fiesta in 1947. Somewhat pigeon-holed in roles by the studio, he also had roles which gave him the opportunity to display his versatility in films such as Battleground, Across the Wide Missouri, Sayonara and Mystery Street. Away from the studio, Mr. Montalban enjoyed a strong stage career which included a Tony nomination for Jamaica in 1957 along with assisting in the founding of Nosotros a theatre company with the goal of encouraging the talents of Latin performers and artists. In his 70 year career, Ricardo Montalban enjoyed the affection of generations of fans. My daughter first discovered him as \"the cool guy\" doing the voice of Senor Senior Sr. in Kim Possible and then she met Khan in Star Trek! Mr. Montalban's only acting award was a 1978 Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Single Performance by a Supporting Actor in a Comedy or Drama Series as Satangkai in How the West Was Won. His 1970 Gunsmoke episode Chato was introduced by James Arness on a DVD release as \"his all-time favourite episode\". Off screen, Ricardo Montalban's 63 year marriage to Georgiana Young is inspirational.\n\nArnold Moss, Arthur Hunnicutt\n\nAlong with our exemplary leads, Border Incident is chock full of outstanding characterizations. In Mexico we have James Mitchell (Stars in My Crown, TVs All My Children) as a sympathetic bracero and Alfonso Bedoya (The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The Big Country) as a mean-spirited thug. Sig Ruman (Stalag 17, Ninotchka) is the ruthless leader of the pipline of human misery. Stealing every scene he is given is Arnold Moss (Reign of Terror, Gambit) as an ambitious criminal too smart for his own good.\n\nNorth of the border Howard Da Silva (They Live by Night, 1776) is the pretentious and avaricious gang boss. He has no trouble keeping underlings Arthur Hunnicutt (El Dorado) and Jack Lambert (Bend of the River) in tow. Can the same be said for second-in-command Charles McGraw (The Narrow Margin, Armored Car Robbery)?\n\nWhile most of the film plays without music, Andre Previn's insistent, pulsating score at the opening prepares the audience for the non-stop action to commence. The dirge-like finale increases the tension of the events. The jazzy score is an interesting contrast to Previn's other 1949 releases, Challenge to Lassie and The Secret Garden.\n\nGeorge Murphy, Charles McGraw, Howard Da Silva\n\nAnthony Mann's vision and cinematographer John Alton's artistry combined on six motion pictures, T-Men, Raw Deal, He Walked by Night, Reign of Terror, Devil's Doorway and Border Incident. In Border Incident most of the action occurs clandestinely at night. The beauty of the images in glorious black and white give the people and the surroundings of the heinous actions a poetic quality that highlights both the humanity and depravity on display.\n\nMGM was entering an era under Dore Schary where films had something to say about the world, as well as entertain. Border Incident fits that profile as well as providing an opportunity for some of the studio's brightest lights to shine.\n\nTCM is screening Border Incident on Monday, November 25th at 12:00 pm.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nWhat a Character! blogathon: Joyce Grenfell\n\nJoyce Grenfell\n\n(1910 - 1979)\n\nLooking back on the days when I trod the boards of community theatre, those occasions where I got the part or at the very least got a callback where the times when I used one of Joyce Grenfell's monologues as an audition piece. Shaky though my accent gene may be or however much I may have lacked in the area of finesse, it was the solid material that impressed artistic staff. In the case of open auditions, other actresses would chase me down asking excitedly where I found that wonderful piece. Joyce combined her observant nature, understanding and talent for mimicry to create real characters that came to life. She used delicate brush strokes and pinpoint precision to skewer pretensions and elevate the mundane, finding humour in all. The effect is rather like singing a Cole Porter song, immediately you are one hundred percent smarter and witter than in reality.\n\nJoyce Grenfell would have been the dream guest on one of those popular programs that probe a celebrity's family tree. Her family included British peers and eccentric, wealthy Americans with ties to well-remembered names of the 19th and 20th century. Her mother was Nora Langhorne, whose father made a fortune in the railway business and whose sister Nancy became the first female British Member of Parliament, Lady Nancy Astor. Their sister Irene married the artist Charles Dana Gibson and the elegant sisters were the inspiration for his famous Gibson Girls. If the name Langhorne sounds familiar, it is because the family was related to Samuel Langhorne Clemens.\n\nBorn in London on February 10, 1910, Joyce grew up an observant and thoughtful youngster with a sense of humour, nurtured and shaped by her intermittently devoted mother and dependable, stolid father. Not an overly committed student, Joyce could be called the class clown who delighted in spot-on impersonations of staff and creating games with her lifelong friend Virginia Graham. Joyce loved the idea of being on stage and took the idea as far as completing one term at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. There, she balked at the training, but made another lifelong friend in Celia Johnson (Brief Encounter, The Holly and the Ivy). At 20, Joyce married Reggie Grenfell and the union would last 50 years until her passing. The couple were not blessed with children, but with deep affection and support for each other.\n\nThe young married lady was drawn into the political activism of her aunt Lady Nancy Astor, as well as caring for her own husband and home, and cultivating her friendships. The creative longing was deeply seeded. Her younger brother Tommy would eventually become a writer in Hollywood contributing to screenplays such as A Yank at Eton and several television dramas. Joyce's first forays into publication were light verses for Punch. Eventually, this led to radio criticism for The Observer and she is credited with helping to form that branch of professional journalism. Joyce unsuccessfully auditioned as a singer and actress for the BBC Radio. Through her radio and journalistic contacts, Joyce's amusing take-offs on different character types began to garner notice and she was asked to write for Herbert Farjeon's popular Light and Shade revue. Joyce was only too happy to do so, but demurred when first asked to appear on stage. The producer felt that no one could do justice to Joyce's work like the author herself. The professional cast of the revue rebelled at the thought of an untried amateur in the ranks. The lure of the spotlight and the application of a strong work ethic marked Joyce's stage debut. The 1939 opening night reviews were glowing in their praise of Joyce Grenfell. One remarked \"These monlogues are the best thing of their kind since Miss Ruth Draper, the difference being that Miss Draper's are too long and Miss Grenfell's are too short.\" The revered American monologist Ruth Draper was a cousin by marriage to Joyce's Reggie. The mind boggles at these coincidences.\n\nDuring the turbulent years of WW2 Joyce Grenfell toured the Middle East, India and North Africa entertaining troops. This also was in her family blood as a youngster during WW1 she had witnessed first-hand the medical care, and the entertainment provided for troops at the Astor's estate which had been turned into a convalescent home. Joyce's popularity as a stage performer and as a radio personality convinced movie producers that there might be something there for them and in the 40s Joyce made the first of her 25 motion picture appearances, with bits leading to progressively larger roles. Let's look at a few of them.\n\nA Run for Your Money (1949)\n\nThis gentle Ealing comedy is a particular favourite of mine. Donald Houston and Meredith Edwards play Welsh brothers who have won a prize trip to London. Alec Guinness is the newspaper reporter detailed to chaperone the two fish out of water who have a myriad of adventures in the big town. Joyce is a very posh boutique manager anxious to make a sale.\n\nStage Fright (1950)\n\nIn Alfred Hitchcock's backstage murder mystery, Joyce is a volunteer carnival barker at a fund raiser who exhorts one and all to \"Come and shoot the lovely ducks\". She is ever so sincere and ever so helpful, and ever so detrimental to Alastair Sim's obvious haste.\n\nAnother great favourite. Joyce is gawky games mistress Miss Gossage, employed by a girl's school that is forced to reside with a boy's school due to bureaucratic ineptitude. Margaret Rutherford and Alastair Sim as the respective school heads have too much to deal with, including poor, over-worked, never-does-anything-right Miss Gossage.\n\nThe Pickwick Papers (1952)\n\nIn this perfectly cast adaption of Dickens classic comedy, Joyce is Mrs. Leo Hunter, the pretentious hostess and authoress of Ode to an Expiring Frog. Surely Joyce was just as author Dickens and illustrator \"Phiz\" envisioned.\n\nGenevieve (1953)\n\nJoyce's hotel proprietress is nothing if not the perfect embodiment of \"the customer is always right\". She tried to explain the deficits of the only room for let to the couple with the poorest showing in the vintage car rally. Is it her fault they didn't listen?\n\nThe Belles of St. Trinian's (1954)\n\nIn the first of five films based on cartoonist Ronald Searle's fevered imagination Joyce is Sgt. Ruby Gates. Sgt. Ruby Gates is placed undercover as a teacher to investigate the possibly illegal activities at St. Trinian's girl's school. The headmistress' (Alastair Sim) brother (also Alastair Sim) is a sharp bookie who has found more than willing accomplices in the wild students of St. Trinian's. They are the original \"girls gone wild\". Imhotep (1932s The Mummy) thinks he suffered for Ankh-es-en-amon! No one ever suffered for love like Ruby Gates, trying to bust this case for her beloved Supt. Bird, who is seemingly oblivious to her torment. Joyce played Sgt. Gates again in Blue Murder at St. Trinian's (1957) and The Pure Hell of St. Trinian's (1960).\n\nThe Americanization of Emily (1964)\n\nThe classic, biting, thoughtful screenplay by Paddy Chayefsky provides many opportunities for the cast to shine, especially Joyce Grenfell as Emily's (Julie Andrews) mother, Mrs. Barham. Joyce's touching performance of a not-so-dotty woman coping with life and death is one for the ages. Surely it was worthy of an Academy Award nomination and, just as surely, the Academy missed the boat. Pictured above with James Garner.\n\nIn 1955 and 1958 Joyce appeared on Broadway in presentations of her One Woman Show. During those times she appeared eight times on The Ed Sullivan Show. She continued with stage programs, including two successful tours in Australia throughout the 60s. Joyce also continued to be a popular radio and television guest and panelist. Surrounded by family and friends, Joyce Grenfell, a staunch Christian Scientist, passed from cancer in November of 1979.\n\nFirst Flight is one of Joyce's excellent character studies, full of life, humour and understanding. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RZ8xHAKwI\n\nJoyce Grenfell's monologues, poems and songs have been collected in several volumes including Stately as a Galleon, George Don't Do That and Hats Off. Recordings of her delightful songs, written in collaboration with the celebrated Richard Addinsell, are still available for our enjoyment. A candid and enthusiastic letter writer, you can learn about Joyce through her own words in the collections Darling Ma (Letters to Her Mother 1932-1944) and Joyce and Ginnie (The Letters of Joyce Grenfell and Virginia Graham), edited by Janie Hampton, family friend and author of the biography Joyce Grenfell. Joyce wrote two volumes of autobiography Joyce Grenfell Requests the Pleasure and In Pleasant Places. Also of interest is The Time of My Life: Entertaining the Troops - Her Wartime Journal. In the 1990s actress/comedienne Maureen Lipman performed Joyce's monologues in Re-Joyce! A Celebration Of the Work Of Joyce Grenfell. Her deft impersonation can also be found on YouTube. The world cannot have enough Joyce Grenfell.\n\nThe What a Character! blogathon hosted by Kellee (Outspoken and Freckled), Aurora (Once Upon a Screen) and Paula (Paula's Cinema Club) is a chance to find out about some of the screen's greats and the bloggers who love them. It runs on November 9, 10 and 11.\n\n↧\n\nThe Baker's Song\n\nFry's Cocoa smells like Christmas\n\nStir together flour, baking power, and salt in small bowl.\n\nVince Guaraldi on the stereo\n\nMelt butter in a large saucepan.

It's not the most expensive candy touted in flashy ad campaigns, but familiar, satisfactory and gussied up for Christmas with a bow. TCM has such a box of treats waiting for us under their tree on Christmas Eve.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox's 1941 release Sun Valley Serenade is directed by H. Bruce Humberstone with a script by Helen Logan and Robert Ellis, the team that brought us, among others, Charlie Chan at the Olympics, Charlie Chan at the Race Track, Three Little Girls in Blue, and Hello, Frisco Hello.\n\nSonja Henie, John Payne, Lynn Bari\n\nThe smooth milk chocolate coating of this romantic comedy follows the mixed-up love life of Ted Scott played by John Payne (Miracle on 34th Street, 99 River Street). He's a musician with Phil Corey and his Dartmouth Troubadours, actually the popular Glenn Miller Orchestra in their film debut. Ted has a thing for name singer Vivian Dawn played by Lynn Bari (Sleepers West, Margie) and as luck and scriptwriters would have it the band finds themselves backing Miss Dawn at an upcoming engagement in Sun Valley. Ted flashes Vivian a winning smile. Vivian gives Ted the once over during a love ballad. Bam, instant couple! Well, after all Ted is played by John Payne and he's the perfect romantic comedy leading man with his handsome face, athletic build and light baritone. In time Payne becomes the perfect film-noir protagonist as his handsomeness grew more rugged and the eyes more soulful. As producer and star of TVs The Restless Gun, Payne also showed his grit as a western actor. Why Lynn Bari never became a top-flight A level star is a mystery to me. She's one of the most likeable of actresses to watch from this era, especially when she plays one of those high-handed gals. Lynn was one of the movie actresses my late father had a thing for, but don't let on. We wouldn't want to make my mom, Barbara Hale or Susan Hayward jealous. Things are going well for our once struggling musicians, but before they head to Sun Valley they must follow through on a publicity stunt dreamed up by their quipster manager, \"Nifty\", played by Milton Berle. He has signed Ted up to sponsor a European refugee. After all, kids make great copy. Only this Norwegian refugee is no kid. No. 36 at the Port Authority is Karen Benson played by three-time Olympic Gold Medalist Sonja Henie, star of a dozen movies for Fox in a twelve year Hollywood career. Karen's plans for a new life in a new world are to find a man to care for and marry. She gazes upon the perfection that is Ted. Bam, instant triangle!\n\nThe Glen Miller Orchestra\n\nThe delicious nugat filling of this treat is the music of \"The World Famous Glenn Miller Orchestra\" as the organization is currently billed. Yes, there is still a place in the world for the tunes and arrangements that were so popular in the 1930s and 40s. Glenn Miller was at the height of his fame and popularity when he signed with Fox and made two films prior to volunteering to \"modernize the Army band\". Tragically, he would be lost during the conflict flying over the English Channel in 1944. But in 1941 we have Glenn and his guys on screen playing their hits In the Mood and Moonlight Serenade. They would also play four songs byHarry Warren and Mack Gordon, Chatanooga Choo Choo, I Know Why and So Do You, The Kiss Polka and It Happened in Sun Valley. Bam, instant standards!\n\nHarold Nicholas, Dorothy Dandridge, Fayard Nicholas\n\nChatanooga Choo Choo was a top seller for Glenn Miller organization and to commemorate the selling of over a million copies, RCA awarded the band the first Gold Record. In the film the tune is presented with a specialty dance number featuring the mind boggling virtuosity of the Nicholas Brothers and the simmering star wattage of 19-year-old Dorothy Dandridge.\n\nLocation filming at the Sun Valley resort must have done wonders for its business. Never has snow looked more inviting. On one hand I would have liked to have seen the movie in Technicolor, but I imagine black & white works better for the process shots of actors skiing. Have no fear, the black and white cinematography turns out to be one of the great strengths of the film. Cinematographer Edward Cronjager received the second of his six Academy Award nominations for the film. His other nods were for 1931s Cimarron, 1943s To the Shores of Tripoli (colour) and The Pied Piper (black and white), 1944s Heaven Can Wait, 1945s Home in Indiana and 1954s Beneath the 12-Mile Reef. Travis Banton was the costume designer for the film and nobody made ladies look more elegant yet at ease in their fashion. Lynn Bari wears a checked coat with a hood that makes me salivate.\n\nThe cinematography is used to particularly fine effect in the skating sequence finale. After all, you don't have an Olympic champion and keep her on the bench. The stark and lovely set with skaters reflected in black ice is like the most wonderful Christmas window display you could ever imagine. Sonja Henie and her signature spins is like the beautiful ballerina in a music box brought to life. The music used for the dance, which was staged by the great Hermes Pan (Swing Time, Top Hat), is a musical reprise of I Know Why and So Do You combined with the lovely melody of At Last. At Last had been filmed by Lynn Bari dubbed by Pat Friday, but was cut from the film. The song would officially debut in 1942s release Orchestra Wives with the Bari/Friday combination.\n\nTCM is giving us Sun Valley Serenade at 10:00 pm on Christmas Eve. It may not be the fanciest present under the tree, at least it doesn't proclaim itself as such, but it's one you will enjoy and recall with much fondness.\n\n↧\n\nCMBA Film Passion 101 Blogathon: Shane (1953)\n\nAward winning filmmaker and American Film Institute founder George Stevens Jr. was a teenager working for his father as a reader when he brought him Jack Schaefer's novel Shane as a film prospect. It was journalist Schaefer's first novel and it's a dandy. A western tale with the well-worn premise of cattleman vs. homesteaders, but filled with epic emotion. Western novelist A.R. Guthrie Jr. adapted the novel for the screen, his first screenplay. Director George Stevens took his company to Wyoming for location filming. Original casting included Montgomery Clift as Shane and William Holden as Joe Starrett, but when they turned down the roles or were unavailable Stevens selected Alan Ladd, Van Heflin and, in what would be her final film role, Jean Arthur. George Stevens had previously directed Miss Arthur in The More the Merrier and The Talk of the Town.\n\nShane was placed on the National Film Registry in 1993. In 1954 it received six Academy Award nominations with its sole win for Loyal Griggs colour cinematography. In all other categories, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor (Brandon de Wilde and Jack Palance), Shane lost to the Oscar juggernaut that was From Here to Eternity.\n\nIn Schaefer's novel, Bob Starrett recalls the time in his youth when the mysterious and dangerous stranger Shane came to their valley, changing everything forever and becoming a part of his family. A story of memory we see all the incidents through Bob's innocent eyes and his adult understanding. In the film Bob becomes young Joey Starrett played by 10-year-old Brandon de Wilde, already a veteran performer from Broadway's Member of the Wedding.\n\nJoe and Marian Starrett (Heflin, Arthur) are creating a life for their family in the valley. Joe is a natural leader and the other farmers in the area rely on him when dealing old-time rancher Rufus Ryker (Emile Meyer). Ryker is not a man eager to change with the times. He wants to run his cattle on open range and the homesteaders are in his way. Joe Starrett, and others like him, see Ryker's time as passed with his inefficient use of the land and feudal attitude. Starrett has the courage to stand up to Ryker, but will it be enough.\n\nAlan Ladd as Shane\n\nOne day Shane rides into the valley. He's a loner from somewhere heading to nowhere. With the Starretts Shane finds acceptance and a peace that has been missing in his life. Shane's quiet confidence confuses some in the valley who underestimate his power. In the novel much is made of Shane's slight stature and especially of his powerful voice. In that regard, Alan Ladd should have been the first choice and it is a gift from the movie gods that he took on the role. Ladd had close to 100 movie roles, with 10 years of bits and uncredited walk-ons prior to his break out role of the killer, Raven in This Gun for Hire. He had plenty of time to hone the craft of screen acting. Like Shane, Ladd is deceptive. You think you know him up there on the screen, but you know only what he lets you know and that voice is an amazing instrument. Listen to his radio program Box 13 or just close your eyes and listen the next time you watch an Alan Ladd movie.\n\nBrandon de Wilde, Jean Arthur, Van Heflin, Alan Ladd\n\nShane's presence shakes up not only the valley and burgeoning settlement, it causes complications in the Starrett household with an unspoken attraction develops between Shane and Marian Starrett. Life is complicated for Joey as he struggles to find a way to love and respect both his father and the stranger. Also unspoken is the life of a gunfighter that Shane has left behind, but cannot run away from when Ryker brings a gunman, Wilson (Jack Palance) to the valley.\n\nI saw Shane\"at the movies\" in the mid-60s when I must have been around 10 or 11. I now assume it was in theatrical re-release, but that didn't occur to me at the time. It was a movie and that was enough. If the movie was on television in black and white with strange cars and fashions that was fine. If the movie was at the theatre on Saturday afternoon that was fine as well. Movies had no release date and no expiration date in my mind.\n\nIt started with the music, with Victor Young's score. I remember physically sitting up straighter in my seat. The music had such a power and a melancholy and the screen was filled with such beautiful scenery that it pulled me into the story. Years later when I read Shane I realized that I lived the movie the way the character of the young boy lived those weeks - observing, sensing, understanding. I felt Shane's loneliness, Joe's ambitions, Marian's conflict, Joey's hero worship. I felt Ryker's frustration, Wilson's swagger and Torrey's bravado. I had laughed and cried at movies before, but never had the emotions felt so crystallized.\n\nStrangely, the experience of Shane wasn't purely an emotional response. One part of my brain was buzzing with the revelation that movies didn't just happen. Movies had a how and a why to them. I reasoned that those \"hows and whys\" must be the choice of the director. Directors names always seemed to have a place of honour in the credits. Aha! That must be why my dad always made us read credits. It was as if a switch was flipped and it made the whole movie experience more alive than ever. I understood why the music moved me, why Shane was often framed away from the other characters, and why Joe was fenced off from Shane and Marian during the dance at the party. What else? What had I missed? When would I see it? It was all too thrilling.\n\nI remember the approving murmur of the patrons after the film and being surprised that the outside world looked the same as when we'd entered the theatre. Did everybody else already know about these \"hows and whys\"? How sad if they didn't know, but how exciting when they found out. Every movie was better after Shane, but it still stands alone as the movie that made me truly love movies.\n\nThe Classic Movie Blog Association (CMBA) blogathon Film Passion 101 runs from December 2 - 6 and provides wonderful insights into movies and the people who love them.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nA New Christmas Memory\n\nArtistic Director Heather Dick formed the Sirius Theatrical Company in 1989 and, based in the Toronto neighbourhood of Mimico, the company produces plays and trains young and old to participate in the theatre. Last year I participated in a play writing workshop with the company in conjunction with the project Forgotten Voices: Beyond the Conflict of the War of 1812. It was a pleasure to confer, converse and otherwise hob-nob with my fellow writers in the flesh. It was an even greater kick to hear my words spoken by genuine actors who were involved in the concurrently running acting workshop.\n\nRecently, Sirius celebrated their third annual reading of Charles Dickens'A Christmas Carol as a fund raiser for the company and an opportunity to collect food for the outreach program of a local church. At loose ends this holiday season, I mulled over the opportunity of attending the performance when I saw a Facebook notice for auditions for readers. Hey, I can read! In fact, in my younger years I used to read Dickens'Mr. Pickwick's Christmas to my younger sisters until someone got the bright idea of hiding the book.\n\nChris Kelk, Fran Raymond, director Heather Dick, Alex Strauss\n\nPatricia Nolan-Hall, Caitlin Robson, David Cairns\n\nCarolers: Kathleen Molto, Margaret Kurek, Glen Molto, Jaime Redford\n\nChrista Weber (hostess, clarinet), Jane Ubertino (cello)\n\nMy red sweater has been in the closet for years waiting for a night out\n\nIt was my happy privilege to be one of six presenters of this most popular of Christmas stories this past Saturday, December 7th. Please, no jokes about a date that will live in infamy. A small and talented group of musicians and singers provided lovely carols and the story was related so thrillingly by the assembled actors that, even as a participant, I felt as if I were hearing the story of Ebenezer Scrooge for the very first time.\n\nNiece Lenny, with the hoisting help of my daughter Janet, meets the cast\n\nThe evening was an opportunity for all of the Nolan girls, even those offspring whose names are Hall and Clayton + my hubby to get together and enjoy some holiday cheer. Brother-in-law Jim Clayton had an out-of-town gig. One thing must be distinctly understood about the Nolan girls + the hubby; they are snobs. They are great big theatre snobs, and they showed up because I was there and the location was convenient. Well, those great big theatre snobs had the time of their lives.\n\nWhile there is much to admire in the diverse aspects of stagecraft Sirius Theatrical Company's A Christmas Carol was a reminder that to create effective and entertaining theatre all that is required is a compelling story and committed storytellers. We have a beautiful new Christmas memory.\n\n↧\n\nWho's watching \"It's a Wonderful Life\"?\n\nChristmas traditions include stories. It starts with the Gospel of Luke and the first Christmas story. From 1843 we have Dickens' immortal tale of redemption and charity in A Christmas Carol. Over the years many movies have added to our emotional connection to the holiday and none more so than 1946s It's a Wonderful Life.\n\nThe first post-War project for director Frank Capra and star James Stewart had great meaning for them. After the harrowing years of WW2 where Capra's Army work included the documentary series Why We Fight, and Stewart's honoured years with the Air Force, it was in the spirit of both men to create something that would celebrate hope and optimism without ignoring the sombre realities of life. It's a Wonderful Life would also be the first film from Liberty Films which Frank Capra formed with producer Samuel Briskin and William Wyler and George Stevens in an effort to break free of the creative control of the major studios. Upon its release the film received five Oscar nominations and was a top ten film from the National Board of Review. The movie was placed on the National Film Registry in 1990.\n\nFor many people It's a Wonderful Life, through its annual television showings throughout the 70s, has become as natural a part of Christmas as decorating a tree. Set at Christmastime, a time when many of us take stock and learn to deal with our regrets and count our blessings, It's a Wonderful Life tells the story of one George Bailey accepting that although he is not living the life he dreamed, it does not mean that his life isn't truly wonderful. It is a simple truth that one life touches so many others.\n\nI have heard some people proclaim that It's a Wonderful Life is the only \"black and white\" or \"old\" movie that they watch. Of course, how they could watch the magic of Capra's directing, the involving Hackett & Goodrich screenplay and the emotionally truthful performances and not want to watch more \"old\" movies is beyond me, but at least they have It's a Wonderful Life. Or do they?\n\n\"And here's the jewel of my collection, purchased for a king's ransom\n\nfrom a one-eyed man in Istanbul. ... I give you Zuzu's petals.\"\n\nWhen I worked in offices I was that girl who decorated her desk in wrapping paper and obnoxiously sang Jingle Bells at the photocopier. Part of my decorating included placing the above Gary Larson tribute to It's a Wonderful Life from The Far Side in a prominent place on any handy bulletin board. There was one particular boss who was a woman who required delicate handling, if at all. It was best to avoid her if possible and most tried their best to stick to that plan. She was the sort of woman that when she finally parted ways with the company Security was asked to deny her access to the building. She stared at the Larson panel, shaking her head in disapproval of my sense of humour.\n\n\"I don't get this,\" she said. \"Is it supposed to be funny?\"\n\nI was shocked that she didn't get the reference, so helpfully began an explanation. \"There's a Frank Capra movie from 1946 called It's a Wonderful Life...\"\n\n\"I know It's a Wonderful Life\", she snapped. \"I watch it every year.\"\n\nWhere do you go from there? I think I waved my hand around and mumbled \"Zuzu's petals\" ineffectually as she sighed heavily and stomped off to her office, slamming the door. The other employees smiled sheepishly at each other. We shrugged our shoulders in silence and tiptoed to our desks and offices. Sensing that discretion was indeed the better part of valour I removed the offending Far Side and it was never mentioned again.\n\nH.B. Warner\n\n1875 - 1958\n\nThe Royal Alexandra Theatre in Toronto has been operating as a legitimate theatre for 106 years and is truly a gem of a venue. The theatre's hallways and stairwells are filled to overflowing with head shots of the notables who have appeared on its stage for over a century. It is my greatest joy during intermissions to stroll among the stars of bygone eras. On this particular evening a friend and I were attending a production of Neil Simon's Brighton Beach Memoirs. My friend is not a theatre buff and was getting a little bored so I searched for someone on the wall that she might know and spotted the kindly, sympathetic face of H.B. Warner. I first ascertained that my friend did indeed watch It's a Wonderful Life every year with her family. They wouldn't miss it.\n\n\"This gentleman\", I said, \"is H.B. Warner. He played Mr. Gower.\"\n\n\"Who?\" she asked.\n\n\"Mr. Gower, the druggest,\" I replied. My friend still looked puzzled so I continued, \"Mr. Gower, the druggest. George's first boss. The man who got drunk when his son died and almost sent the wrong medicine and slapped George.\" Still no recognition from my friend. \"In Pottersville he was the rummy that got thrown out of Nick's place.\"\n\nMy friend offered that I must be getting confused with one of the other old movies that I watch because she didn't remember anything like that in It's a Wonderful Life. She then returned to our seats. A solicitous usher had observed the exchange and the two of us spent the rest of the intermission in search of Cornelia Otis Skinner. Her picture. Her ghost. We were prepared for anything under the watchful gaze of the kindly, sympathetic face of H.B. Warner.\n\nWhen your friends, co-workers, neighbours or the chatty lady in line at the supermarket talk about how much they look forward to It's a Wonderful Life every year, simply smile in agreement. Do not mention Zuzu's petals or Mr. Gower or Uncle Billy's late wife's name or Sam Wainwright's catchphrase. Do not start to sing Buffalo Gal and expect them to join in. It might crush your soul.\n\n↧\n\nChristmas Movie Blogathon: Beyond Tomorrow (1940)\n\nFamily Friendly Reviews is presenting theChristmas Movie Blogathon from December 20 - 22nd. A time to catch up with your favourites of the holiday season.\n\nAcclaimed cinematographer Lee Garmes (Shanghai Express, Nightmare Alley, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty) varied his Oscar winning career with producing and directing credits. In 1940 he co-produced with Oscar-nominated (Three Smart Girls, Christmas in Connecticut) writer Adele Comandini, a screenplay adapted from her original story called Beyond Tomorrow. It is a lovely little film that has found its share of fans through television screenings during the Christmas holiday season. The film was colorized in the early part of this century and released by Twentieth Century Fox as Beyond Christmas, perhaps in an effort to heighten its appeal. I don't know if this has been successful because I have noticed that there seems to be a proliferation of made-for-TV romantic comedies with \"Christmas\" in the title and this old-fashioned charmer might be getting lost in the shuffle.\n\nHarry Carey, Maria Ouspanskaya, Charles Winninger, C. Aubrey Smith,\n\nRichard Carlson, Jean Parker\n\nThe stars of Beyond Tomorrow are all familiar and favourite actors to film buffs. We are introduced to three wealthy and successful engineers who are partners in a business and roommates in a rambling New York City mansion. Michael O'Brien is the heart of the group as played by Charles Winninger (Show Boat, State Fair, Destry Rides Again). Allan Chadwick is a lonely widower played by C. Aubrey Smith (And Then There Were None, Five Came Back, Another Thin Man). George Melton is the cynic of the group, a man acquitted of a crime that the audience can only guess about, and he is played by Harry Carey (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Angel and the Badman, So Dear to My Heart). Their housekeeper is a former Russian Countess, Madame Tanya played by Maria Ouspenskaya (Love Affair, The Wolf Man, Kings Row). The words may be unspoken, but through their actions we see that this is a household of affection and kindness.\n\nJean Parker, Richard Carlson\n\nWhen Christmas Eve guests beg off at the last moment, warm-hearted Michael comes up with a plan to fill their lives with new and interesting people. The three gentlemen toss wallets containing $10 and a business card into the snow and see what the bait returns. Pessimist George scoffs at the idea. His is the first wallet found by a sophisticated entertainer who gives the money to a taxi driver and tosses the wallet away. Her companion notes that she is very generous with other people's money. Michael's wallet brings their first guest of the evening. James Houston is a cowboy who came to the city months ago to appear in a rodeo and is now down on his luck. Honest enough to return the wallet and money, the group takes a liking to him and convinces him to share a holiday meal. Richard Carlson (The Little Foxes, All I Desire, Creature from the Black Lagoon) plays Houston. The stage trained actor and writer made an appealing film debut in 1938s The Young in Heart, and after service in WW2 would find work in television and the sci-fi craze of the 1950s. Allan's wallet is returned by Jean Lawrence, a social worker played by pretty Jean Parker (Little Women, The Ghost Goes West, Black Tuesday). The artistic Ms. Parker, who painted and designed fashions, had a very interesting film career in the 1930s and a permanent place in Caftan Woman's Hall of Fame for 1939 when she played the object of Oliver Hardy's unrequited love in The Flying Deuces and his lovesick daughter in the same year's Zenobia. James and Jean form a strong mutual attraction and together with their three newfound friends an odd yet strong family is formed.\n\nCharles Winninger, C. Aubrey Smith, Harry Carey\n\nI believe that the soul of man is immortal and will be treated with justice in another life, respecting its conduct in this.\n\n- Benjamin Franklin\n\nThe above quote appears after the opening credits of the film and if the audience has forgotten it as the story unfolds, its meaning becomes clear with the death of the three kind gentlemen in a plane crash. Their spirits return to the NYC abode where they observe the life they have left and wonder about what is to come. Madame Tanya alone senses their presence. \"I know you are here. I cannot see you or touch you, but I know you have come home.\"\n\nThe human interest story surrounding the deaths of the high profile businessmen and the young couple makes for great copy. James appealing personality and singing ability thrust him into the spotlight, a very bright spotlight. I can find no evidence that Carlson's voice was dubbed so assume that he did his own singing in the story and it's a very nice voice. Michael is thrilled that James has a chance to do something with his talent, making people happy and providing a good future for himself and Jean. George remains cynical, even in the afterlife. \"A chance to get mixed up with a lot of cheap people. They'll turn his head and make a fool of him. He'll drink too much and he'll laugh too much. He'll lose his way.\"\n\nGeorge's prophecy comes true as James falls under the spell of singing star Arlene Terry played by Helen Vinson (Torrid Zone, The Kennel Murder Case, The Power and the Glory). She's the gal who discarded George's wallet. Arlene is a dishonest narcissist who comes between James and Jean for the fun of it. If I have one complaint with Richard Carlson as James it is that in his scenes with Arlene/Ms. Vinson his lack of guile makes him seem almost too dumb for words. Nonetheless, he is not the first man to fall for her line. Arlene's distraught and drunken ex-husband played by James Bush (You Can't Cheat an Honest Man, Internes Can't Take Money) is out for blood. By this time, two of our three spirits have been called to their destiny. Michael remains fighting Heaven and endangering his immortal soul in a bid to intercede and help his young friends survive the tragedy he sees coming their way. \"Sometimes you have to go through the darkness alone before you can see the light.\"\n\nThe fantasy aspects of Beyond Tomorrow are written and played with a gentle sincerity that fits in perfectly with a Christmas theme. Christmas, despite its festive trappings, is not a season of unremitting joy. It is also a time of sweet and sad memories of our good times and bad, and of those no longer with us. This sensitive drama affirms the connection of souls across the borders of time and space in an unpretentious and satisfyingly sentimental manner.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Michael (Charles Winninger) insists on imbibing and sharing a \"Tom and Jerry\" with all and sundry. The celebratory punch dates back to the 19th century and every year I promise myself I will try it, but haven't gotten around to it yet. It sounds warming and sweet, two things of which I highly approve.\n\nThis recipe makes 24 servings of the eggnog-like concoction. It should be fairly easy to amend to suit a smaller party.\n\n12 eggs\n\n1-1/4 cups confectioner's sugar\n\n20 ounces of brandy\n\n24 cups of milk\n\n1 pinch of ground nutmeg\n\nSeparate the eggs and beat the whites until frothy. Whisk in 3/4 cup of confectioner's sugar to form stiff peaks. Beat the yolks with the remaining sugar adding 4 or 5 tablespoons of brandy. Fold the egg whites into the mixture and refrigerate.\n\nHeat the milk until hot, but not boiling. Reduce heat to simmer.\n\nPlace 2 tablespoons of brandy plus 1 tablespoon of the egg mixture in a mug then fill with the steaming milk, topping with more egg mixture and a dash of the nutmeg. Declaim an appropriate seasonal toast.\n\n↧\n\nCaftan Woman's Choice: One for January on TCM\n\nIt is starting out to be quite the chilly January. Perfect weather for a nice, cozy little murder mystery. Perhaps a backstage murder. Something in comforting black & white. Something with one of those great leading ladies from the Golden Age. Something with an amusing and endearing detective. Lots of atmosphere with the familiar faces of favourite character actors popping up in scene after scene. I've got it! Let's watch The Velvet Touch.\n\nThe Velvet Touch was the first of five films produced by Frederick Brisson starring his wife Rosalind Russell. Following this 1948 film, their collaborations would include 1953s Never Wave at a WAC, 1955s The Girl Rush, 1962s Five Finger Exercise and 1971s Mrs. Pollifax - Spy from Dorothy Gilman's popular book series.\n\nRosalind Russell as Valerie Stanton\n\nA spirited and resolute New England gal, Rosalind Russell studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and trained with a repertory group at The Copley Theatre run by E.E. Clive (The Invisible Man, Libeled Lady, the Bulldog Drummond series) before heading to Hollywood where she was signed by MGM in 1934 as a back-up leading lady to keep Myrna Loy in line. Roz's screen career is a testament to her vitality and versatility. The light of intelligence was a part of her make-up, but Ms. Russell could be exceedingly glamorous and dramatic or as gawky as all get-out in striving for our laughs. Her dramatic skills were used to great effect in 1936s Craig's Wife and 1937s Night Must Fall. Her comedic talents started to garner notice in 1939 with the comedy-mystery Fast and Loose. In that fabled year she was cast as Sylvia Fowler in the screen version of The Women, a role that had been played on Broadway by Ilka Chase. The overbearing and hysterically funny Sylvia is just one of the many roles that would become ever associated with Rosalind Russell. In 1940 Hildy Johnson of The Front Page was reborn as a female for His Girl Friday. The trenchant and still timely Hecht/MacArthur play worked beautifully with estranged couple Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell battling corruption and each other in pursuit of headlines. A lot of big name actresses including Ginger Rogers and Barbara Stanwyck had turned down the role before Rosalind Russell snapped up the part and made it all hers.\n\nThe first of Roz's four Oscar nominations was as Ruth Sherwood in 1942s My Sister Eileen. Shirley Booth had played the role on Broadway. Roz was nominated for the Oscar and the winner that year was Greer Garson in Mrs. Miniver. In 1953 Roz would revive \"Ruth\" in the Bernstein/Comden & Green Broadway musical version Wonderful Town and was awarded a Tony. In 1947 the Academy nominated Rosalind Russell for her role as real-life nurse and polio treatment pioneer Sister Kenny. The winner was Olivia de Havilland in To Each His Own. Rosalind was considered a lock for the award in 1948 for Mourning Becomes Electra, but the award instead went to Loretta Young in The Farmer's Daughter. In 1957 Rosalind Russell won another Tony Award for portraying the open-hearted eccentric Mame Dennis in Auntie Mame. Thankfully, she recreated the role for the screen in 1958 insisting that her stage co-star Jan Handzlik join her as young Patrick. It is a performance for the ages captured for us all. Auntie Mame would give Roz her final Oscar nomination with the award going to Susan Hayward in I Want to Live!. In 1973 Rosalind Russell was presented with the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award from the Academy. From the desperate Rosemary Sydney in Picnic to the down-to-earth real life heroine Louise Pierson in Roughly Speaking and all those ladies in between, Rosalind Russell gave us women to inspire, to understand and to make us laugh.\n\nRosalind Russell as Valerie Stanton\n\nLeon Ames as Gordon Dunning\n\nIn The Velvet Touch Rosalind Russell plays stage star Valerie Stanton. One fateful night her complicated professional and personal relationship with her producer Gordon Dunning played by Leon Ames (Charlie Chan on Broadway, Meet Me in St. Louis, Testament) comes to an end, as does his life. Valerie Stanton had wanted to take her theatrical career away from comedy and her affections away from Dunning to Michael Morrell played by dreamy-eyed Leo Genn (Quo Vadis, The Snake Pit, Moby Dick). Enter Captain Danbury of Homicide played by Sydney Greenstreet (The Mask of Dimitrios, Christmas in Connecticut, The Maltese Falcon). In an appealing Columbo-like manner the Captain insinuates himself into the theatrical world to determine the truths hidden therein.\n\nRosalind Russell as Valerie Stanton\n\nSydney Greenstreet as Captain Danbury\n\nAs the story unfolds we are treated to the inestimable Claire Trevor (Stagecoach, Dead End, Key Largo) as Marian Webster, a dear friend of the deceased Mr. Dunning. Welcome turns are provided by Frank McHugh (Going My Way, The Roaring Twenties), Walter Kingsford (the Dr. Kildare series), Dan Tobin (Woman of the Year, TVs Perry Mason), Theresa Harris (Baby Face, I Walked With a Zombie) and Caftan Woman Hall of Famer Esther Howard (Born to Kill, Sullivan's Travels). In one of her first credited roles you will spot 24-year-old Martha Hyer (Some Came Running, The Sons of Katie Elder).\n\nRosalind Russell as Valerie Stanton\n\nLeo Genn as Michael Morrell\n\nThe screenplay for The Velvet Touch is by Leo Rosten (All Through the Night, Captain Newman MD). Four time Oscar nominee and frequent Frank Capra collaborator Joseph Walker (It Happened One Night, Only Angels Have Wings, Theodora Goes Wild) was the cinematographer. The Velvet Touch was the eighth of ten films Walker shot starring Rosalind Russell. Helping Roz to look every inch the glamourous stage star in a series of eye-popping and jealousy inducing black and white outfits was Travis Banton (Raffles, Tin Pan Alley, Moon Over Miami). This was the seventh film in which he dressed Ms. Russell.\n\nTCM is screening The Velvet Touch on Monday, January 27th at 3:15 pm.

The Yalta Conference. The Battle of Iwo Jima. Nineteen-year-old Princess Elizabeth joins the Women's Auxililary Service as a mechanic. Franklin D. Roosevelt dies and Harry S. Truman becomes President of the United States. Mussolini is executed. Hitler kills himself. Canadian and British troops liberate the Netherlands. MacKenzie King is elected Prime Minister of Canada for the third time. The United Nations Charter is signed. Hiroshima bombed. Nagasaki bombed. Japan surrenders.\n\n1945 was the year the world had been striving toward, the year that would mark the end of World War 2, the global conflict which focused so much of humanity's energy, spirit, flesh and blood. Europe, Africa, the Pacific and Asia would be freed and enslaved. Political expediency and political gain would change the map of the world in the rush for a return to a normalcy that didn't exist. Science would forever place the burden of annihilation on mankind's shoulders.\n\nThe tumult that was the war years also heightened the creativity of those who dealt with entertainment. People can only be bowed down by troubles for so long before they bounce back. The sun still shines every day and music must be played, jokes must be laughed at and we must reach out to each other through our stories.\n\nNumber one on The New York Times Best Selling Novels of 1945 list was Earth and High Heaven by Gwethalyn Graham, the first by a Canadian author to reach that coveted spot. Readers were talking about George Orwell's Animal Farm. Reverand W. Awdry published The Railway Series featuring the adventures of Thomas the Tank Engine.\n\nByron Nelson was the PGA's top money earner. Jackie Robinson signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers farm team, the Montreal Royals of the International League. The Detroit Tigers beat the Chicago Cubs in the World Series. Toronto Maple Leafs beat the Detroit Red Wings for the Stanley Cup.\n\nBing Crosby was the top male vocalist among fans of popular music with hit songs You Belong to My Heart from The Three Caballeros, It's Been a Long, Long Time and I Can't Begin to Tell You from The Dolly Sisters. Perry Como sang Dig You Later, Temptation and Did You Ever Get That Feeling. Frank Sinatra wowed 'em with Oh! What it Seemed to Be and If I Loved You from Carousel. Woody Herman, Benny Goodman, Stan Kenton and Harry James kept toes tapping and Les Brown's girl singer Doris Day let the world know she was here with Sentimental Journey. Songs from Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein's Broadway show Carousel and movie State Fair were popular on record and in sheet music sales. The Academy Award for Best Song at the 1945 ceremony went to Swinging on a Star from Going My Way.\n\nRadio programs included variety programs such as the Kraft Music Hall with Bing Crosby and shows featuring singer Kate Smith, bandleader Benny Goodman, and the Boston Symphony. Popular comedies included The Jack Benny Program, The Abbott and Costello Show and The Edgar Bergen/Charlie McCarthy Show. Death Valley Days and The Lone Ranger vied with Lux Radio Theater and Eleanor Roosevelt for audiences. The Academy Awards presentations were broadcast for the first time with awards going to Going My Way for Best Picture, Bing Crosby for Going My Way and Ingrid Bergman for Gaslight.\n\nThe Hollywood machine was working overtime in the 1940s. In addition to propaganda and morale boosting films, there was money to be made from the cathartic laugh or tear and the Technicolor fantasy. There was a market for every type of story and every type of filmmaker to provide it in that improbable land where creativity and commerce flourished.\n\nGary Cooper produced and starred in Along Came Jones, spoofing his laconic image. Upon completion of Lady on a Train, beloved star Deanna Durbin married that film's director Charles David and retired from the screen. Billy Wilder took his cameras to NYC to film an unflinching look at alcoholism in The Lost Weekend. The beauty of leading lady Gene Tierney was matched by the sets and locations of the crime melodrama Leave Her to Heaven. The inspired Val Lewton unit at RKO gave Boris Karloff one of his greatest screen roles as John Gray, The Body Snatcher. Double the Danny Kaye enlivened Wonder Man. Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce starred in three Sherlock Holmes movies for the fans, The House of Fear, The Woman in Green and Pursuit to Algiers. Roberto Rossellini's neorealistic Rome, Open City won the Grand Prize prize at Cannes.\n\nLet's take a closer look at some of the output of 1945 that found their contemporary audience and are worth the viewer's time and affection to this day.\n\nTHE BATTLEFIELD\n\nThe Story of G.I. Joe\n\nRobert Mitchum, Burgess Meredith\n\nWhen director William Wellman was approached by independent producer Lester Cowan about the possibility of taking on a project based on Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Ernie Pyle's Here Is Your War, \"Wild Bill\" declined the honour in no uncertain terms. A flyer in WW1, Wellman wanted no part in glorifying the infantry. It was after spending time with Pyle that the director relented and created a film that he was immensely proud of and that he could never watch. As related in his 1974 autobiography A Short Time for Insanity, Wellman's goal was to make The Story of G.I. Joe\"... the goddamndest most honest picture that has ever been made about the doughfoot.\" He wanted to show everyday bravery from everyday kids; the horror and the tedium. Kids, \"old kids\" from the 18th infantry, back from Europe, about to be deployed in the Pacific were in the film. None of them came home, and that's why Wellman could never watch the picture. Burgess Meredith played Ernie Pyle and Robert Mitchum received his only Academy Award nomination in the supporting role of Walker.\n\nNaval Reserve officer John Ford directed Navy veteran Robert Montgomery, along with Donna Reed and John Wayne, in They Were Expendable. The story of a PT boat squadron in the Philippines in the early days of the war with Japan. Montgomery's Lt. John Brickley is the counterpoint of Medal of Honor holder Vice Admiral John Bulkeley. A story of perseverance in the face of overwhelming opposition, the film is beautifully photographed by Joseph August, Oscar nominee for Portrait of Jennie and Gunga Din.\n\nA Walk in the Sun is directed by Lewis Milestone, who won an Oscar as director of All Quiet on the Western Front. A fine ensemble cast including Dana Andrews, Richard Conte, Norman Lloyd, Lloyd Bridges, John Ireland, Sterling Holloway, Herbert Rudley and Steve Brodie. During landing in Italy a platoon's leader is killed, leaving Sgt. Tyne (Andrews) in charge of the men and their objective. Artistic touches include the inner thoughts of these characters as they deal with the tension of the situation, and a narrative ballad performed by bass baritone Kenneth Spencer. A thoroughly involving and moving film.\n\nHEART AND HOME\n\nIt has been four years since audiences spent time with Nick and Nora Charles. In Shadow of the Thin Man the couple was mixed up with race track types. Now it was time to relax, to get back to basics we never could have imagined upon first meeting the couple. Had we ever really given a thought to Nick Charles' parents? Here they were in the forms of Harry Davenport and Lucile Watson in The Thin Man Goes Home. Sycamore Springs is a smallish, idyllic city were old Doc Charles learns to over come his disapproval of Nick's lifestyle. As per usual, no one in town believes Nick is there to relax. He must be on a case. A case and long held secrets come to light. There's some very good work from MGMs stable of character actors, Ann Revere, Leon Ames, Donald Meek, Lloyd Corrigan and young Gloria de Haven. Nick wrestling with a collapsible lawn chair is a treat, and wait until you see jitterbug Nora.\n\nThe 20th Century Fox release of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn from Betty Smith's best seller was the first feature film for director Elia Kazan. The sensitively told tale of a family's struggles at the turn of the twentieth century highlights the director's way with actors as pitch perfect performances come from young Peggy Ann Garner as Francie Nolan and Ted Donaldson as Neely. Joan Blondell steals our hearts as Aunt Cissy and Dorothy McGuire gives us Katie's battered soul. James Dunn was an Oscar winner in the supporting category as the character who means so much to so many, especially to his imaginative daughter.\n\nA series of vignettes through the changing seasons in a Wisconsin farming community form the basis of Our Vines Have Tender Grapes directed by Roy Rowland from a script by Dalton Trumbo. Selma Jacobsen played by Margaret O'Brien is a bright and curious seven-year-old beloved by her parents, Edward G. Robinson and Agnes Moorehead. Young Selma and her cousin Arnold, played by Butch Jenkins, observe life in their town and the adults that surround them. The life they observe is not always kind, not always easy to understand. It is the bonds of family in which strength is found. Favourite quote: \"When you are asking for tolerance how much are you willing to give?\"\n\nHANDS ACROSS THE SEA\n\nThe Brits always know how to tell a story. The Archers, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, gave us the love story of Joan Webster and Torquil MacNeil. Joan, played by the incomparable Wendy Hiller, is an unapologetic golddigger who has snagged her millionaire. She is on her way to a remote Scottish Island to marry the bank account of her dreams. On leave from the Service is Torquil, played by the altogether intriguing Roger Livesey. Call it Fate or Kismet or chemistry, Joan is discovering she has a heart and it doesn't belong to a multinational corporation. It's not that easy to turn your back on a lifetime's aspiration. It's not that easy to turn your back on Torquil MacNeil. Location filming in Scotland, the grand faces of locals, the music of ages and a script as sharp as a tack culminating with the greatest punchline of all time make I Know Where I'm Going! a movie that inspires and feels like a living breathing thing.\n\nVacation from Marriage sometimes known as Perfect Strangers is from Alexander Korda's London Films. Deborah Kerr and Robert Donat star as Catherine and Robert Wilson, a rather dull and unassuming London couple whose lives are turned upside down and inside out by wartime duty. Away from each other and forced to take what life throws at them, both Catherine and Robert become different people. They are brighter, happier, more confident individuals, but what will that do to them as a couple? The story is an always timely one of relationships and the performances are timeless.\n\nNoel Coward's play Still Life is directed by David Lean as Brief Encounter. It is a quiet and desperate story of love, longing, loss and renewal anchored by the beautiful performance of Celia Johnson as Laura Jesson, an everyday housewife whose emotional life is enlivened and confused by her attraction to a married doctor, Alec Harvey played by Trevor Howard. That her feelings are ardently returned makes this brief encounter achingly bittersweet.\n\nSHADOWLAND\n\nScarlet Street\n\nTom Dillon, Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett\n\nIn the 1940s crime dramas became moodier and darker in tone and in look in a style that has become known as film noir. One great exponent of the approach was German born Fritz Lang (M, The Big Heat, House by the River). In Scarlet Street we are involved in the life of one of life's losers, Christopher Cross played by Edward G. Robinson. The unhappily married wage slave finds his only outlet in painting. A series of circumstances bring Chris into the orbit of Kitty March played by Joan Bennett. Kitty and her snake of a boyfriend Johnny, played by Dan Duryea, know how to use people. They find a way to use Chris and his art. It's a recipe for murder. The body and the soul are destroyed in different ways, as you will find when you walk down Scarlet Street.\n\nIt is always impressive to see what can be done with nothing. Some people can look in an almost empty pantry and make a gourmet meal. Director Edgar G. Ulmer's pantry was Producer's Releasing Corporation and the pickings were lean on \"Poverty Row\". Yet Ulmer managed to create a dour and compelling little noir in Detour that has reached the pantheon of cult status. Former MGM contractee Tom Neal is Al Roberts, a musician who plans to hitchhike cross country to join his gal Sue, played by Claudia Drake, in Hollywood. The noir gods place in Al's way a dead bookie and the femme fatale to end all femme fatales. Ann Savage plays Vera, as tough a broad who ever stepped out of the shadows and from there on, in less than 67 miniutes, Al's life is a nightmare.\n\nOne of the great noir directors is Anthony Mann and in 1945 he was beginning his string of great crime pictures (T-Men, Raw Deal, Border Incident). The Great Flamarion is a showman, an expert marksman played by Eric Von Stroheim. The egotistic Flamarion is at the top of his game and the top of his world, but he's about to topple from his throne because of a woman. His assistant Connie played by Mary Beth Hughes would just as soon be rid of her drunken hubby Al, played by Dan Duryea. Life would be peachy and creamy for Flamarion and Connie if only Al were out of the way. Flamarion loses it all when Connie throws him over for another man. Flamarion thought he was so great. He was just another schnook.\n\nLAUGHTER AND SONG\n\nState Fair\n\nDana Andrews, Jeanne Crain\n\nComposer Richard Rodgers and lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II reinvented Broadway in 1943 with Oklahoma! and the 1945 release State Fair was their first musical written originally for the screen. An adaption of Phil Strong's popular 1932 novel which was first filmed in 1933 starring Will Rogers, State Fair is the story of the Frake family of Iowa and their life changing visit to the State Fair. Directed by Walter Lang (The Little Princess, Desk Set, Moon Over Miami), the movie is gloriously filmed in Technicolor by cinematographer Leon Shamroy (Leave Her to Heaven, The Black Swan, The King and I). Charles Winninger and Fay Bainter are delightful as the parents, as excited by their young adult children at the prospect of the trip to the fair. Jeanne Crain glows as girl-next-door Margy. Crowd pleasing vocalist Dick Haymes is her brother Wayne. Both youngsters are eager for romance. They will find it in newspaper man Pat Gilbert played by Dana Andrews and singer Emily Edwards played by Vivian Blaine. Highlights of the heartwarming and enjoyable film include the songs It's a Grand Night for Singing, It Might As Well Be Spring, Isn't It Kind of Fun, That's For Me, and a priceless turn by Donald Meek as the judge of the mince meat competition.\n\nThe most popular comedy team of the era was Bud Abbot and Lou Costello, starting with their movie debut in 1940s One Night in the Tropics through to their 1950s run-ins with Universals acclaimed monsters. In The Naughty Nineties we go back to a time before either world war, a time of show boats and vaudeville turns, and songs everyone used to know such as My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean and Take Me Out to the Ballgame. Speaking of ballgames, in this picture Bud and Lou give perhaps the finest performance of their classic routine Who's On First?. Plenty of laughs and the show boat is saved from nefarious nasties. What's not to like?\n\nMGM had themselves a Best Picture nominee in Anchors Aweigh, a splashy Technicolor musical that follows two sailors on leave in a backlot Los Angeles. Gene Kelly was given free reign to display his considerable talents, young Frank Sinatra to sing his way into willing hearts and Kathryn Grayson to look lovely and sing the same. This is the movie where Gene first combined his dancing ability with the world of animation, performing in tandem with Jerry, the mouse of Tom and Jerry fame. Pamela Britton, later of TVs My Favorite Martian, is a doll as the gal waiting for Sinatra when Grayson ends up in Kelly's arms. Dean Stockwell charms as Grayson's kid brother. The movie engenders a lot of good will through the exuberant talent and likability of the cast. It's only detriments being a rather meandering script and a running time of 143 minutes.\n\nGOTTA HAVE MY TOONS\n\nOne of the delights of attending the movies in an earlier era must have been the fun of watching classic cartoon shorts before they became classic. Disney Studio's Duck Pimples is a personal favourite of mine. Donald Duck was put through many surreal adventures in the feature release of The Three Caballeros and the Oscar nominated Donald's Crime, but they pale in comparison to Duck Pimples. It is a dark and stormy night when spooky radio programs plus a lurid mystery novel put The Duck's nerves on edge. A visit from a door-to-door salesman sends him into a frenzy of imaginative adventures populated by off-the-wall characters. A must-see.\n\nSpike is a \"noivous wreck\" in MGMs Oscar winning Tom and Jerry short Quiet Please!. If he doesn't get his beauty sleep Spike threatens Tom with a thorough pulverization. Jerry sees to it that no matter how much effort Tom puts into silence, noise will be the order of the day. From the Golden Age of Hanna-Barbera's Tom and Jerry series with the resources of MGM behind their vision and the glorious musical highlights from Scott Bradley.\n\nFrom Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies comes another Oscar nominee, Life With Feathers. A love-lorn parakeet tries to commit suicide by Sylvester in that cat's film debut. Unlike many of our well-known toons, Sylvester in his debut is pretty much Sylvester as we have always known him. He's sneaky, one step behind the rest of the world, slightly on the cowardly side and very funny.\n\nIn 1945 the public seemed to have an insatiable appetite for the movies. What would the post-war years bring?\n\n↧\n\nFavourite movies: Charlie Chan at the Olympics (1937)\n\nEarl Derr Biggers popular fictional detective Inspector Charlie Chan of the Honolulu Police Department sprang from the writer's Hawaii vacation and the newsworthy career of local policeman Chang Apana. Six Chan novels were published between 1925 and 1932. So popular were the novels that the first, The House Without a Key was filmed in 1926 with Japanese actor George Kuwa playing the detective. The Chinese Parrot was filmed the following year with Kuwa in the cast as a different character while Sojin Kamiyama played Chan. E.L. Park was Chan in the first sound adaptation of one of the novels, Behind That Curtain which is a bit of a snorer, of interest only out of curiosity.\n\nWarner Oland\n\n1879 - 1938\n\nCharlie Chan Carries On was directed by Hamilton MacFadden in 1931 and Fox Films fortuitously cast Warner Oland (The Jazz Singer, The Vagabond King, The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu) as Charlie Chan. Sadly, the film was lost to us in a studio fire although the plot was recycled as 1940s Charlie Chan's Murder Cruise. Other lost films from the Oland series are Charlie Chan's Chance, Charlie Chan's Greatest Case and Charlie Chan's Courage based on The Chinese Parrot. 1931s The Black Camel directed by Hamilton MacFadden on location in Hawaii is the earliest sound Chan available to fans.\n\nIn 1934 with Charlie Chan in London the movie mystery series really hits its stride as the Inspector's world class reputation took him to exotic locales matching wits with a variety of international criminals. 1935s Charlie Chan in Paris took another leap forward with the introduction of Keye Luke (The Good Earth, the Dr. Gillespie series, Gremlins, TVs Kung Fu) as number one son, Lee Chan. Talented and good looking, Luke also had great chemistry and a strong bond with his co-star Warner Oland and their interactions heightened the audience affection for the series.\n\nWarner Oland, Lane Tom Jr., Keye Luke\n\nOn set for Charlie Chan at the Olympics\n\nThe 1936 Summer Olympic Games were held in Berlin, Germany from August 1st - 16th. Adolf Hitler used the Games as a chance to promote his government's ideology of racial supremacy on the world stage. The world of sports and politics clashed, not for the first or the last time, over the issue of participation in an event hosted by such a divisive nation. Countries which boycotted the Games included Spain and the Soviet Union. Arguments included those with blinders who felt politics and sports shouldn't and didn't mix. The American Jewish Congress saw boycotting as the only viable form of protest. Many in the African-American press saw participation and winning in the Games Some as a potential triumph over the Nazi party. Ultimately, the Games were attended by the largest number of delegates since the inception of the modern movement in 1892.\n\nIn May of 1937 Twentieth Century Fox released Charlie Chan at the Olympics directed by H. Bruce Humberstone (I Wake Up Screaming, Sun Valley Serenade, Charlie Chan at the Opera).\n\nWarner Oland, Katherine DeMille\n\nCharlie Chan at the Olympics\n\nHonolulu is the testing site for an aerial guidance system that has drawn the attention of various worldwide political factions, friendly and otherwise. Precautions to preserve security are useless when bribery, blackmail and murder are available tools. The guidance system is stolen, misdirected blame is placed and murder discovered. Nine-year-old Layne Tom Jr. makes his first appearance of three in the series as a younger Chan son. They never did settle on a consistent name for the youngster and here he is referred to as Charlie Jr. The boisterous kid pops up everywhere in the first part of the movie in the time-honoured series tradition of both pestering and assisting his beloved \"Pop\".\n\nCharlie Jr.'s favourite suspect in the international caper is Yvonne Roland, the \"lady with the fox fur coat\", played by Katherine DeMille (The Black Room, Unconquered, Banjo on My Knee), adopted daughter of Cecil B. DeMille. The attractive Ms. DeMille, who would marry Anthony Quinn in 1937, makes an elegant and obvious woman of intrigue. Despite Charlie Jr.'s steadfast conviction, there are other suspects in the case. Chief among them is C. Henry Gordon (The Charge of the Light Brigade, Kongo, Charlie Chan in City in Darkness) as Arthur Hughes, a freelance procurer of contraband.\n\nJonathan Hale (Inspector Fernak in the Saint series, Mr. Dithers in the Blondie series) is Mr. Hopkins, president of the company backing the aerial guidance system. Hughes is his top suspect and he doesn't trust the police methods. John Eldredge (Meet Corliss Archer) is Cartwright, the inventor behind the system, an easy-going sort who backs up his employer. With no evidence to hold the suspects on the island, Charlie Chan is once again on the road following his leads all the way to Berlin, site of the Olympic games.\n\nHawaii's Olympian, Duke Kahanamoku\n\n1890-1968\n\nWhere, you are probably asking, is our pal Lee during all of this excitement? Following in the footsteps of five time Olympian swimmer Duke Kahanamoku, holder of gold and silver medals in 1912 at Stockholm, two gold in 1920 at Antwerp, one silver in 1924 in Paris, and member of the water polo team 1932 at Los Angeles, Lee Chan is on the Olympic team as a swimmer.\n\nKeye Luke, Pauline Moore\n\nCharlie Chan at the Olympics\n\nThe American Olympic team is on an ocean liner headed to Europe and other passengers include the fashionable Yvonne Roland and the mysterious Arthur Hughes. Lee's teammates include track and field athletes Betty Adams played by Pauline Moore (Charlie Chan at Treasure Island, Young Mr. Lincoln) and Richard Masters played by Allan Lane aka Allan \"Rocky\" Lane (Red Ryder series, voice of TVs Mr. Ed). Betty and Richard provide the romantic subplot for the picture and are worthy pals for Lee.\n\nMaking up for the suspect's head start, Chan, Hopkins and Cartwright make their way to Europe aboard the ill-fated dirigible the Hindenburg whose fiery destruction in New Jersey occurred a mere two weeks prior to the film's release.\n\nIn Berlin the athletes find themselves the victims of thefts and under suspicion by the police, represented by Frederick Vogeding (Murder on the Blackboard, Mysterious Mr. Moto, Below the Sea) as Captain Strasser. Only slightly bull-headed, but largely sympathetic and co-operative, Strasser walks a fine line of deferring to Inspector Chan and upholding the dignity of his office.\n\nInspector Chan faces one of the most cool and diabolical opponents of his career in diplomat the Honourable Charles Zaraka played by Morgan Wallace (Orphans of the Storm, It's a Gift), a man who stops at nothing to get what he wants. Zaraka stops at nothing short of kidnapping beloved Lee Chan to stop the Inspector's interfering with his plans. The torment of this plot turn for our cherished Chans ramps up the emotional connection to this stellar entry in the series.\n\nBerlin's Olympic Stadium, 1936\n\nAlong with being a top-notch entry in the series, Charlie Chan at the Olympics also holds our interest for its historical value. Film of the Hindenburg, airbrushed clean of its swastikas, gives us a glimpse into a way of travel long vanished. Incorporated into the movie are scenes of ceremony and background at the Berlin games and the triumph of America's gold medal winning athlete Jesse Owens. Charlie Chan at the Olympics is set amidst a background of political turmoil, contentious ideology and threats of violence at a sporting event that sees itself in a bubble apart from those things surrounding it. Perhaps that is the celebration that the Games should be, but can never be. The movie is an entertaining visit to the past with an uncomfortable connection to our present.\n\n↧\n\nCaftan Woman's Choice: One for February on TCM\n\n\"Words with a K in it are funny. Alka-Seltzer is funny. Chicken is funny. Pickle is funny. All with a K. Ls are not funny. Ms are not funny.\" - Willy Clark, The Sunshine Boys\n\nTheatrical agent Ben Clark has been hearing theories on comedy his whole life from his Uncle Willy. Willy Clark of the famed duo Lewis and Clark aka \"The Sunshine Boys\" is a veteran of over 40 years in show business, so if he says words with Ks are funny then you can take it as gospel. Ben is the world's best nephew. He visits his uncle weekly and continues to look for work for the cantankerous senior despite Willy's practically pathological irritability which does not endear him to potential employers. In fact, Willy - to quote Ben - is a \"Crazy freakin' old man!\"\n\nGeorge Burns as Al Lewis\n\nWhen Neil Simon's The Sunshine Boys opened in 1972 it was the 11th Broadway hit for the Emmy, Tony and Pulitzer Prize Award winning playwright. It was inevitable that the play would make the transition to the big screen and just as inevitable, in the ways of Hollywood, that the original cast of Jack Albertson as Willy Clark and Sam Levene as Al Lewis would not be used in the movie. The inspired first choice for The Sunshine Boys were the consummate funny men Red Skelton and Jack Benny.\n\nRed Skelton declined the offer as he was doing better financially on the road than the film prospect could offer. Tragically, Jack Benny would be diagnosed with the pancreatic cancer which would take his life. Jack, bless his soul, recommended his lifelong friend George Burns as his replacement. George had not appeared in a movie since 1939s Honolulu and his narration of 1956s The Solid Gold Cadillac, but this \"gift from Jack\" as he called it, revived his career in a big way. George Burns won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor of the year and became a recording artist, best selling author and a movie star!\n\nRichard Benjamin as Ben and Walter Matthau as Willy\n\nOscar winner for a supporting role for The Fortune Cookie, Walter Matthau was cast as Willy Clark and would receive an Oscar nomination for Best Actor for the role.\n\nA good 20 years younger than the character of Willy Clark, Matthau is a total hoot as the grumpy golden-ager. Willy becomes apoplectic upon taking his first breath in the morning and nothing that occurs during the day lessens his attitude. On the other hand, Al is so easy-going that he might be comatose. Their long association makes each fellow the key to the others exasperation.\n\nRichard Benjamin gives a note perfect performance as the harried nephew, Ben. The lengths to which Ben Clark goes to take care of his uncle surpasses human understanding, as is the length of aggravation Willy heaps on Ben with a mix of glee and insensitivity. It seems Richard Benjamin's Oscar nomination was lost in the mail. However, Benjamin did receive a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture, while that organization gave both Matthau and Burns statues for Best Motion Picture Actor - Musical/Comedy. I doubt anyone complained about the disparity in the category designations. After all, recognition is recognition.\n\nAl Lewis and Willy Clark - The Sunshine Boys\n\nGeorge Burns and Walter Matthau\n\nIn The Sunshine Boys Ben Clark has found a fire-sure job for his Uncle Willy. The ABC network is planning an all-star program on the history of comedy and naturally there is spot for Lewis and Clark. Surely the two men can put aside the differences that ended their partnership for this opportunity. The laughs abound in Ben's efforts to bring the two former partners together and the results. A favourite scene is set in Willy's apartment as the two set up to rehearse a sketch. Priceless!\n\nThe Sunshine Boys marks the first of five movies based on Neil Simon's work that would be directed by Herbert Ross. Oscar winners The Goodbye Girl and California Suite would quickly follow. Simon said of Ross, \"I think Herb Ross is the best director I've worked with in films. The others just don't understand my material as well.\"\n\nSupporting players in the film include Lee Meredith (The Producers) from the original Broadway cast as the nurse in the famous \"Doctor\" sketch and Rosetta LeNoire (TVs Family Matters) as Willy's beleaguered nurse. Look for Tony winner Ron Rifkin as the TV special's director, Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham as a mechanic, Howard Hesseman (TVs WKRP in Cincinnati) as a commercial director, and Fritz Feld (Bringing Up Baby) as an actor.\n\nThe Sunshine Boys is a very funny movie. The nostalgic and knowing script has a clear-eyed affection for its characters. The play is a popular one for professional and amateur companies. Tony Randall and Jack Klugman appeared in a Broadway revival in 1997 that ran for over 200 performances. Peter Falk and Woody Allen made a TV movie in 1996 that updated the duo from vaudevillians to early TV stars. In 2011 Dick Van Dyke and Jerry Van Dyke appeared in a limited run fund-raising production for the Malibu Stage Company. In 2012 Danny DeVito and the late Richard Griffiths starred in a well-received production in London. Judd Hirsch took over for Griffiths when the production moved to the States. I shouldn't be surprised if a local company near you has plans for a staging.\n\nTCM is screening The Sunshine Boys on Friday, February 21 at 6:00 pm during its yearly 31 Days of Oscar festival. Don't miss it!\n\n↧\n\nBlogathon announcement: Diamonds and Gold\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, please join my friend and yours Rich Watson of Wide Screen World as we host the Diamonds and Gold Blogathon this coming April 12th and 13th.\n\nFifty is the new thirty!\n\nPolish off that rose-amber spot and turn it on your favourite actors and actresses who ignored the siren call of social security and continued to work their magic on screen in memorable performances into their 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s and beyond.

A time of promotion for the motion picture industry. A time of excitement and anxiety for the nominees. And no less a time of interest and opinions on the part of film fans. Classic fans enjoy 31 Days of Oscar on TCM and the second annual 31 Days of Oscar Blogathon hosted by the intrepid trio of Once Upon a Screen, Outspoken and Freckled and Paula's Cinema Club.\n\nMy contribution to the blogathon is a revisit and a revamp of an article first posted on this blog in 2011 which looks at an amazing Oscar record.\n\nDuring the course of his movie career Bing Crosby introduced fourteen original songs that were nominated for the Best Song by the Motion Picture Academy and four of these songs garnered statues for their composers.\n\nClick on the song title links for YouTube performances from the films where available.\n\nBing Crosby, Miriam Hopkins, Edward Nugent\n\n1934: She Loves Me Not\n\nThe first of these songs was a tune we associate with another performer. Jack Benny's theme Love in Bloom by Ralph Rainger and Leo Robin was first sung by Bing and Kitty Carlisle in She Loves Me Not. Miriam Hopkins stars as a nightclub singer on the lam from crooks being hidden by Bing and fellow student Edward Nugent at Princeton. The comedy was remade as How to Be Very, Very Popular in 1955 starring Betty Grable, Sheree North and Robert Cummings.\n\nThree songs were nominated in this first year of the category, along with Love in Bloom was Eliscu and Kahn's Carioci from Flying Down to Rio and the winner, Conrad and Magdison's The Continental from The Gay Divorcee.\n\nDonald Meek, Madge Evans, Bing Crosby, Edith Fellows\n\n1936: Pennies from Heaven\n\nThe nomination for Arthur Johnston and Johnny Burke's title song Pennies from Heaven must have been especially gratifying for Bing as he was co-producer as well as star of this Columbia Studios release. Bing plays Larry Poole, an ex-con who sees himself as a modern day troubadour, footloose and fancy free. His life becomes entangled with an orphan played by the extraordinary child actress Edith Fellows (Five Little Peppers), her doughty grandfather Donald Meek (Stagecoach) and an uptight social worker Madge Evans (Dinner at Eight). Prominent in the cast was Bing's good friend Louis Armstrong in the first of four films together, plus many TV appearances and a 1960 album, Bing and Satchmo. This Oscar year is truly a case where being nominated is honour enough as the winner for Best Song was Kern and Fields The Way You Look Tonight from Swingtime.\n\n1937: Waikiki Wedding (winner)\n\nOne of the top box office pictures of the year, Waikiki Wedding starring Bing, Shirley Ross, Martha Raye and Bob Burns is filled with breezy good humour and hypnotically sumptuous cinematography by Karl \"Sunrise\" Struss. The lovely Blue Hawaii by Ralph Robin and Leo Rainger was introduced in this film, but surprisingly was not nominated in the Best Song category. The honour went to bandleader and composer Harry Owen's Sweet Leilani. The song's inclusion in the film was at Bing's insistence and he set up a trust fund for the royalties to go to Harry's daughter Leilani for whom the song was written.\n\nSweet Leilani won over competition that included the Gershwin's They Can't Take That Away from Me from Shall We Dance and Fain and Brown's That Old Feeling from Vogues of 1938. While I think it's a lovely little lullaby, surely Sweet Leilani's win over the Gershwin tune is worthy of debate usually reserved for Best Picture or the acting categories.\n\nBing Crosby, Mary Martin, Oscar Levant\n\n1940: Rhythm on the River\n\nThis very funny film directed by Victor Schertzinger stars Basil Rathbone as a famous composer who has lost his stuff and \"collaborates\" with a lyricist played by Mary Martin and a composer played by Bing. Eventually the two dupes discover the truth and set out on their own. Throw in Oscar Levant for the wisecracks and Wingy Manone on trumpet and you have a winner.\n\nRhythm on the River features my all-time favourite Bing Crosby title track from a movie, but that peppy number didn't find favour with the Academy. It was James Monaco and Johnny Burke's destined-to-become-a-standardOnly Foreverthat was nominated. In another case of losing to a classic, the winner was Leigh Harline and Ned Washington's When You Wish Upon a Star from Pinocchio.\n\nBing Crosby, Marjorie Reynolds, Fred Astaire, Virginia Dale\n\n1942: Holiday Inn (winner)\n\nBing as Jim Hardy and Marjorie Reynolds as \"I'm Linda Mason\" (dubbed by Martha Mears) introduced Irving Berlin'sWhite Christmas to the world in Holiday Inn. The song is such a part of our lives that I often forget that it also received the honour of an Oscar.\n\nThere were quite a few goodies among the nominees that year: Jules Style and Sammy Cahn's It Seems to Me I've Heard That Song Before from Youth on Parade, Harry Warren and Mack Gordon's I've Got a Gal in Kalamazoo from Orchestra Wives, Frank Churchill and Larry Morey's Love is a Song from Bambi, Burton Lane and Ralph Freed's How About You? from Babes on Broadway, Jerome Kern and Johnny Mercer's Dearly Beloved from You Were Never Lovelier and Ernesto Lucuono and Kim Gannon's title theme from Always in My Heart.\n\nIrving Berlin called White Christmas one of his \"round\" songs. A tune which seemed to compose itself, it came to him so effortlessly. His enthusiasm for the song never wavered. It seems that way as well with the public who has placed it at the number one of the Billboard charts three times since its motion picture debut.\n\nBing Crosby, Barry Fitzgerald\n\n1944: Going My Way (winner)\n\nLeo McCarey's heartwarming episodic feature following the exploits of progressive Father O'Malley and the set-in-his-ways Father Fitzgibbon was an Oscar juggernaut winning 7 out of 10 nominations. In the win column Best Picture, Leading Actor Bing Crosby, Supporting Actor Barry Fitzgerald, Director Leo McCarey, Original Story Leo McCarey, Screenplay Frank Butler and Frank Cavett and Best Original Song for Jimmy Van Heusen and Johnny Burke's Swinging on a Star performed by Bing as Father O'Malley with the Mitchell Boys Choir.\n\nThe perennial favourite won over such superb ballads as Jimmy McHugh and Harold Adamson's I Couldn't Sleep a Wink Last Night introduced by Frank Sinatra in Higher and Higher, and Styne and Cahn's I'll Walk Alone from Follow the Boys.\n\nBetty Hutton, Bing Crosby\n\n1944: Here Come the Waves\n\nHere Come the Waves stars Bing as a Sinatra-type balladeer and Betty Hutton as twins, one of whom is crazy about the crooner, so guess which one the star falls for? Perhaps due to a the films late in the year release (I can find no other reason), the Harold Arlen and Johnny Mercer song Accentuate the Positive, was nominated for Best Song for the 1945 awards presented in March of 1946. The song in the film is presented in a rousing production number and sung by Bing and Sonny Tufts in blackface. The Oscar that year was awarded to the lovely ballad It Might As Well Be Spring from Rodgers and Hammerstein's State Fair.\n\nRuth Donnelly, Ingrid Bergman, Bing Crosby\n\n1945: The Bells of St. Mary's\n\nFather O'Malley is at it again in the charming Going My Way sequel The Bells of St. Mary's co-starring Ingrid Bergman. When a student at St. Mary's, Patsy played by gifted Joan Carrol (Meet Me in St. Louis, Primrose Path) is in need of a confidence boost O'Malley sings another Jimmy Van Heusen and Johnny Burke hit Aren't You Glad You're You into the Best Song category. The winner that year, as previously mentioned, was Rodgers and Hammerstein's It Might As Well Be Spring.\n\n1946: Blue Skies\n\nHoliday Inn co-stars Bing, Fred Astaire and composer Irving Berlin reunited for Blue Skies, a Technicolor musical chronicling the career and romantic entanglements of a couple of song and dance men. The pretty leading lady was Joan Caulfield and comedy support came from Olga San Juan and Billy De Wolfe. Among the perennial Berlin favourites was a new song You Keep Coming Back Like a Song which received an Oscar nomination. The winner that year was Harry Warren and Johnny Mercer's On the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe from The Harvey Girls.\n\nClick here to listen to the lovely ballad as sung by the great Ella Fitzgerald on her Grammy award winning album Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Irving Berlin Songbook.\n\nCharles Lane, Bing Crosby, Jane Wyman\n\nBeverly Washburn, Jacques Gencel\n\n1951: Here Comes the Groom (winner)\n\nFrank Capra's Here Comes the Groom stars Bing as a foreign correspondent who surprises his stateside fiance with a couple of war orphans. A top-flight cast including Alexis Smith and Franchot Tone seem to be having great fun in this picture. Bing and leading lady Jane Wyman duet on Hoagy Carmichael and Johnny Mercer's In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening which was recorded live on set instead of using playback. A winning combination for the audience and a winner at the Oscars. The last of Bing's four Oscar winning songs.\n\nBing Crosby, JaneWyman\n\n1952: Just for You\n\nIt's Bing and Jane again in the story of a widowed Broadway producer coping, not very well, with his children played by Natalie Wood and Robert Arthur, and finding romance with a musical comedy star. Oscar nominated Zing a Little Zong by Harry Warren and Leo Robin tries to capture some of the joy of the previous year's In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening and comes pretty darn close. The song would lose to one of the most famous movie songs of all-time, Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington's theme to High Noon.\n\nBing Crosby, Rosemary Clooney, Danny Kaye, Vera Ellen\n\n1954: White Christmas\n\nMichael Curtiz directed Christmas perennial White Christmas starring Bing and Danny Kaye as successful producer/entertainers falling for singing sisters Rosemary Clooney and Vera Ellen. Along the way the quartet help a retired General played by Dean Jagger and give us some favourite familiar Irving Berlin songs. A new tune gets an Oscar nomination as Rosie and Bing sing Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep. The Academy voters awarded Styne and Cahn's popular theme to Three Coins in a Fountain, overlooking not only Irving, but Arlen and Gershwin's The Man That Got Away from A Star is Born. Did the Academy members not get just who Ira Gershwin was?\n\nBing Crosby, Grace Kelly, Frank Sinatra\n\n1957: High Society\n\nIt was big news when Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra were paired in this musical update of The Philadelphia Story opposite Grace Kelly in her final film before becoming Princess Grace of Monaco. The songs, by Cole Porter no less, included the Oscar nominated True Love presented as a charming duet by Bing and Grace. Mr. Porter would have to content himself with the thought of the untold number of couples who have taken his gentle ballad to their hearts. In the Academy's eyes the Best Song of the Year was Livingston and Evans'Que Sera Sera from The Man Who Knew Too Much.\n\n1960: High Time\n\nBlake Edwards' comedy stars Bing as a retired millionaire taking the time to get a college degree and experience a life he had missed as a younger working man. Fabian, Tuesday Weld and Richard Beymer are fellow students in this okay-Sunday-matinee type of movie. Bing falls for a lovely French teacher played by Nicole Maurey and introduces the Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn Oscar nominated The Second Time Around. Other tunes in the Best Song category were The GreenLeaves of Summer from The Alamo, Faraway Part of Town from Pepe and the title song from TheFacts of Life. The winner was the very popular title track from Never on Sunday.\n\nThe nature of film and of the music business being what they are in the 21st century, I feel safe in predicting that Bing Crosby's record of introducing 14 Oscar nominated and 4winning songs will never be equaled.\n\nImpressive though the line-up of songs may be, if I were in charge there would be even more nominees. For your consideration:\n\n1935: Mississippi, Rodgers and Hart's It's Easy to Remember (And So Hard to Forget)\n\n1936: Rhythm on the Range, Johnny Mercer's I'm an Old Cowhand (From the Rio Grande)\n\n1942: Road to Morocco, Van Heusen and Burke's Moonlight Becomes You\n\n1947: Road to Rio, Van Heusen and Burke'sBut Beautiful\n\n↧\n\nCaftan Woman's Choice: One for March on TCM\n\nIt's been a long winter. March is coming in like a lion. Who wants to leave the comforts of home and hearth for an adventure? You don't have to give up the coziness. You can share the vicarious adventures of Captain Geoffrey Thorpe as he gives his all for Queen and country. Let's hit the high seas with one of films' greatest screen teams, Errol Flynn and Alan Hale.\n\nDashing screen star Flynn's many skills as an actor were seen to great advantage in the epic adventure films produced by Warner Brothers in the 1930s and 40s, mostly directed by Michael Curtiz. Reportedly, the actor and director had a thorny relationship, but the product on the screen was the best of its kind and timeless entertainment. An excellent appreciation of Errol Flynn can be found in this article by Rebecca Barnes aka Classic Becky. Singer and actor Alan Hale had been in pictures since the age of 20 in 1912. Fond as I am of the output of the silent era, there are some actors that are meant to be heard and that rich baritone of Hale's is a gift. Fourteen times Flynn and Hale shared the screen in films made between 1937s The Prince and the Pauper and 1948s Adventures of Don Juan. Their audience appeal was at its height in pictures like The Adventures of Robin Hood, Dodge City and The Sea Hawk where Hale's blustery and loyal sidekick was the perfect companion to Flynn's committed and sometimes foolhardy heroes.\n\nAlan Hale and Errol Flynn\n\nDavid Bruce in background\n\nThe Sea Hawk, released in 1940, is said to be a remake of the 1924 film based on Rafael Sabatini's 1915 novel, but I can find no similarities beyond that of the title. The script for the 1940 film is by Howard Koch (Three Strangers, Letter from an Unknown Woman) and Seton Miller (Kid Galahad, Two Years Before the Mast). The thrilling score is from the glorious pen of Erich Wolfgang Korngold (Kings Row, The Adventures of Robin Hood) and it is the well from which springs all the heart and emotion of this epic adventure.\n\nThe Sea Hawk is the story of two empire builders, Philip of Spain and Elizabeth of England. Philip is amassing his Armada and Elizabeth, apparently a fiscal conservative at this time, is wary of her minister's advice to increase her naval strength. Spying and skullduggery is rampant at court. On the high seas a group of privateers known as the Sea Hawks plunder the plunderers to fill the coffers of England. Chief among them is Flynn's Geoffrey Thorpe, a favourite of Her Majesty.\n\nFlora Robson and Errol Flynn\n\nFlora Robson, who first portrayed Elizabeth I in 1937s Fire Over England for Alexander Korda, once again takes on the role and of all the actresses who have given their all to the task Ms. Robson (Black Narcissus, 7 Women) is my favourite. Her Elizabeth is shrewd, imperious, slyly humourous, quick to temper yet nobody's fool. In short, she is a joy to watch.\n\nHenry Daniell plays Lord Wolfingham, a man with loyalties only to himself and if spying for Philip will advance his personal cause, he has no qualms. Daniell is such fun to watch in the villainous or unlikeable roles. His unbending nature and mellifluous voice, like a charming snake, adds so much to his characterizations in films as diverse as Camille, Holiday, The Body Snatcher and The Philadelphia Story.\n\nDonald Crisp (How Green Was My Valley, Lassie Come Home ) as the trusted minister Sir John Burleson gives an air of trustworthiness that is a comfort in the palace. Comfort is needed when the ambassador from Spain, Claude Rains as Don Jose Alvarez de Cordoba makes his presence felt. Here Rains (Casablanca, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington) pulls out his patented \"he's saying all the right things, but I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him\" character. Don Jose's only human side is evident in his relationship with his niece Dona Maria played by Brenda Marshall (Footsteps in the Dark, Captains of the Clouds ).\n\nBrenda Marshall and Errol Flynn\n\nMaria, our love interest in the picture, is established as worthy in her first few scenes. On the journey to England's court, their ship is captured by Thorpe despite the diplomatic flag they carry. We first see Maria as playful in a deck top tennis match with her maid Miss Latham played by Una O'Connor (Cavalcade, Witness for the Prosecution). Confronted with her captor she is a haughty aristocrat. When she sees the released British galley slaves there is pity and shame on her face. Maria as played by Ms. Marshall is a keeper.\n\nErrol Flynn and a beautiful leading lady, you would think that's all you would need, wouldn't you? But, no. Thorpe is notoriously tongue-tied around the ladies, as his crew duly notes.\n\n\"I hear the Queen is the only woman he can speak to without buckling his knees.\"\n\n\"Man to man I calls it!\"\n\nGeneral hilarity.\n\nThe crew is a great part of what makes The Sea Hawk work. Beyond Alan Hale we have J.M. Kerrigan (The Long Voyage Home) as a loyal and headstrong sailor. David Bruce (Lady on a Train) makes an impression as someone who seems more than meets the eye. William Lundigan (I'd Climb the Highest Mountain) swings into action with his heart-melting smile. Uncredited in one of his first half dozen film bits is 36-year-old Edgar Buchanan (TVs Petticoat Junction) who had just turned over his thriving dental practice to his wife in order to pursue acting. As his role here shows, Mr. Buchanan was quickly on his way to becoming the greatest scene stealer of all time.\n\nThe Spanish military is ably represented by Captain Lopez played by a courtly Gilbert Roland (The Lady and the Bullfighter), Captain Mendoza played by Pedro de Cordoba (Sabotage), Ian Keith (Nightmare Alley) as cagey Peralta and Jack La Rue (Road to Utopia) as over-confident Lt. Ortega. Keep your eyes peeled for the likes of Whit Bissell, Jay Silverheels, Gerald Mohr and John Sutton. There may be a drinking game.\n\nErrol Flynn\n\nThe action set pieces in The Sea Hawk are every bit the exciting, escapist fare they are meant to be yet still have their poignancy and high stakes investment. Political tensions are at their height and Thorpe takes on a covert operation to steal plunder meant for Spain's coffers at its source in Panama. Naturally, the Queen must disavow any knowledge of his actions. Despite all efforts at secrecy, the spy network of Lord Wolfingham does its job and Thorpe and gallant crew sail off into a trap and tragedy. The segment of the film which takes place in Panama replaces the sumptuous black and white photography we have been enjoying with a sepia tone denoting the exotic and steamy locale. A bold and successful move by three time Oscar nominated (Captains of the Clouds, Sergeant York, The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex) cinematographer Sol Polito.\n\nHenry Daniell and Errol Flynn\n\nAll of the intrigue, ro"
