        "text": "Despite what we all may say about Fox’s current run of films, their history has been more than impressive.\n\nThis very history is set to be brought back to the public, in honor of the film staple’s 75th anniversary, in one hell of a box set.\n\nAccording to Home Media Magazine, the company will be releasing a new box set, in three volumes, on December 7, for the relatively steep price of $499.98.\n\nIncluded in the set are films ranging from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid all the way to something like Avatar, or even Wall Street. The set is going to be massive, clocking in at, you guessed it, 75 films, and will also feature a hard-cover book that will look at the impressive collection of films that Fox has played home to.\n\nEach volume will look at a different 25 year span of the company’s history, and even though the set’s expensive, a 75-film set could cost much more. I’d imagine that these films singularly would be about $10-20 a piece, so this is definitely a cost effective little box set, if you want to have the full history of 20th Century Fox at your disposal.\n\nSource: Home Media Magazine\n\nCELEBRATE THE RICH HISTORY OF ONE OF HOLLYWOOD’S MOST LEGENDARY STUDIOS\n\nTWENTIETH CENTURY FOX 75TH ANNIVERSARY GIFT SET\n\nThree-Volume Set Includes A Total Of 75 Award-Winning And Landmark Films Along With An Exclusive Companion Book, Arriving On DVD December 7\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA.
