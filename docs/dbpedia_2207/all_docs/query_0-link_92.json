        "text": "Mary Pickford Theater\n\n2005 Archive of Screened Films\n\nTuesday, January 4 (7:00pm)\n\nGerman Shepherds\n\nTracked by the Police (Warner Bros., 1927). Dir Ray Enright. With Rin-Tin-Tin, Jason Robards, Virginia Browne Faire. (61 min, 35mm) Wolfheart�s Revenge (Charles R. Seeling Productions, 1925). With Wolfheart (The Dog Wonder), Guinn Williams, Helen Walton, Larry Fischer. (43 min, 35mm)\n\nAs the most famous German shepherd ever to appear on film, Rin-Tin-Tin almost single-pawedly kept the Warner Brothers studio afloat. Film historian William Everson called Tracked by the Police one of \"Rinty ’s\" best. The busy canine rescues his socialite owner from a kidnapper, rescues her love interest from a rockslide and rebellious workers, and prevents the sabotage of a dam. Wolfheart was one of many German shepherds who followed in the wake of Rin-Tin-Tin’s success in the 1920s. In Wolfheart’s Revenge, he teams with western star \"Big Boy\" Williams to battle a conniving ranch foreman and his murderous hunger for land.\n\nThursday, January 6 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nSons and Lovers (20th Century-Fox, 1960). Dir Jack Cardiff. With Trevor Howard, Dean Stockwell, Wendy Hiller. (103 min, 35mm)\n\nJack Cardiff, the celebrated cinematographer noted for The Red Shoes, Black Narcissus, and The African Queen, turned 90 on Sept. 18. Sons and Lovers, his third feature, is a brave try at conveying D.H. Lawrence's passionate intensity. There are fine performances by Trevor Howard, Wendy Hiller, and Mary Ure. Freddie Francis received an Oscar for his great camera work.\n\nFriday, January 7 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nThe Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (Warner Bros., 1953). Dir Eug�ne Louri�. With Paul Christian, Paula Raymond, Cecil Kellaway. (80 min, 35mm)\n\nSpawned from King Kong and giving birth to the genre of the radioactive behemoth, The Beast is a Cold War nightmare realized. A nuclear test blast in the Arctic frees the carnivorous Rhedosaurus from its long entrapment in the ice. It makes underwater tracks down the Eastern Seaboard, chomping on the occasional boat or lighthouse, heading for its breeding grounds in the Hudson Submarine Canyons. A marvelous rampage through NYC ends with a stunning showdown at the Coney Island roller coaster. The innovations of Ray Harryhausen hatch this toothy villain. Did I mention the deadly virus that sprouts from its blood? Loosely based on Ray Bradbury’s story “The Foghorn.”\n\nTuesday, January 11 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nThe 13th Letter (20th Century-Fox, 1951). Dir Otto Preminger. With Linda Darnell, Charles Boyer, Michael Rennie. (85 min, 35mm)\n\nWith the exception of Laura, Otto Preminger's films made at 20th Century-Fox have been forgotten or ignored, a situation encouraged by the director's selective amnesia. Preminger's remake of Henri Georges Clouzot's Le Corbeau (1943) was his twelfth Fox production. Set in a French-Canadian village, the story centers on lives disrupted by a series of poison-pen letters.\n\nThursday, January 13 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nTargets (Saticoy/Paramount, 1968). Dir Peter Bogdanovich. With Boris Karloff, Tim O�Kelly, Nancy Hsueh. (90 min, 35mm)\n\nThere are two narrative threads to this chilling low budget suspense masterpiece. In one of his finest performances, Boris Karloff portrays the aging horror film star of yesteryear - essentially this film is a tribute to him. He feels that the newspaper headlines provide terror far more convincingly than his own movies, and in anachronistic despair he reluctantly makes a final appearance to promote his last film. Bobby Thompson is the wholesome-looking middle class young man who is the real monster. He is loosely based on Charles Whitman, the University of Texas Tower sniper. The two stories merge in a stunning climax at the drive-in. The film brings into play questions of destiny and inevitability wrought cleverly owing to the constraints of the budget. It is a potent message that is relevant today.\n\nFriday, January 14 (7:00pm)\n\nGerman Shepherds\n\nClash of the Wolves (Warner Bros., 1925). Dir. Noel Mason Smith. With Rin-Tin-Tin, Charles Farrell, June Marlowe, Heinie Conklin. (69 min, 35mm)\n\nThe Adventures of Rin-Tin-Tin : The General's Daughter (Screen Gems/ABC, 1958). Dir Robert C. Walker. With Lee Aaker, Jim L. Brown, Morris Aukrum. (28 min, 16mm)\n\nThe original Rin-Tin-Tin was an abandoned German war dog found in Paris by an American serviceman who brought him to the U.S. In Clash of the Wolves, preserved by the Library of Congress Motion Picture Laboratory, Rin-Tin-Tin plays Lobo --half dog and half wolf --who has a price put on his head by ranchers. He is saved and befriended by a kind prospector, and in return Lobo rescues him from the film’s villain. After the original Rin-Tin-Tin died in 1932, his progeny and other unrelated German shepherds carried on the franchise in movies and television. In the television show The Adventures of Rin-Tin-Tin, \"Rinty\" lives at Fort Apache in the old West with his master, Rusty, who was orphaned in an Indian raid. In this episode, he aids in the capture of renegade Apaches who attack a stagecoach carrying a general and his daughter.\n\nTuesday, January 18 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nThe Asphalt Jungle (MGM, 1950). Dir John Huston. With Sterling Hayden, Jean Hagen, James Whitmore, Marilyn Monroe. (112 min, 35mm)\n\nThe quintessential naturalistic film noir and definitive heist film. It convincingly portrays the motivations and details the personal idiosyncracies of its criminal gang. Great character actors and a superb ensemble cast flesh out the brain, the bookie financier, the safecracker, the driver, the thug, and the fence. Not to mention the hard luck moll and the mistress. “Crime is only a left-handed form of human endeavor.” Alienating and claustrophobic, this hard-boiled tale was adapted by John Huston and Ben Maddow from W. R. Burnett’s novel of the same name. This film inspired several remakes and notably influenced Jules Dassin and Jean-Pierre Melville\n\nFriday, January 21 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nPete Kelly's Blues (Warner Bros., 1955). Dir Jack Webb. With Jack Webb, Janet Leigh, Edmond O�Brien, Peggy Lee. (95 min, 35mm)\n\nJazz enthusiast Jack Webb assembled eight exemplary musicians whose roots go back to bands led by Ben Pollack, Bob Crosby, and Benny Goodman. Former band vocalists Ella Fitzgerald and Peggy Lee perform the standard songs \"Hard Hearted Hannah\" and \"Sugar.\" Miss Lee also is very moving as a gangster's moll. And Janet Leigh's flapper is reason enough for Jack to toot his cornet. Ray Heindorf's musical direction deserves special mention.\n\nTuesday, January 25 (7:00pm)\n\nImages of Native Americans\n\nYoung Deer's Bravery (Bison/New York Motion Picture Co., 1909). (10 min, 35mm)\n\nSmoke Signals (Shadowcatcher/Miramax, 1998). Dir Chris Eyre. With Adam Beach, Evan Adams, Irene Bedard. (88 min, 35mm)\n\nBased on stories by Sherman Alexie, Smoke Signals was the first feature film written, directed, and acted by Native Americans. Thomas and Victor are reluctant friends. Twenty years ago Victor’s father Arnold saved Thomas from a burning building; but to Victor, his father was an abusive drunk. When word comes of Arnold’s death, Thomas offers to help Victor make the trip to collect the remains. A touching and dryly funny buddy flicke. Shown with Young Deer’s Bravery, an early silent Bison drama. Young Deer is caught cheating the tribal Chief’s son at cards, and is sentenced to death. A pretty cowgirl rescues him from this fate, only to be captured herself. In a strangely multi-layered transference, Young Deer joins the cowboy camp and rescues his rescuer. When our hero finds himself in battle with his own tribe, who will win?\n\nThursday, January 27 (7:00pm)\n\nGerman Shepherds\n\nThe Sign of the Claw (Gotham/Lumas, 1926). Dir B. Reeves Eason. With Peter the Great, Edward Hearn, Ethel Shannon. (45 min, 35mm)\n\nThe Phantom of the Forest (Gotham/Lumas, 1926). Dir Henry McCarthy. With Thunder, Betty Francisco, Eddie Phillips. (44 min, 35mm)\n\nThe Screen Almanac : Every Dog Has His Day (Selznick, 1924). With Strongheart. (12 min, 35mm)\n\nOriginally trained to kill as a police dog in Germany, Strongheart was the first German shepherd to star in a feature film in 1921, and his success created a trend for more German shepherds onscreen. In the newsreel The Screen Almanac, Strongheart is shown relaxing with his mate in a luxurious hotel suite. Peter the Great was also brought over from Germany and had great success for a couple of years until he was tragically killed while protecting his master. In The Sign of the Claw, Peter the Great helps his master, a patrolman, foil bank robbers. In The Phantom of the Forest, Thunder, also known as \"the Dog Marvel,\" aids a woman whose land is under attack by oil speculators.\n\nFriday, January 28 (7:00pm)\n\nImages of Native Americans\n\nRedskin (Paramount, 1929). Dir Victor Schertzinger. With Richard Dix, Gladys Belmont, Tully Marshall. (83 min, 35mm)\n\nA Navaho boy and a Pueblo Girl leave their tribes to be educated by the white man. Intertribal marriage is forbidden; naturally, Navajo and Pueblo fall in love with each other. After graduating from college, they return to their respective villages only to be shunned by their families. A plea for assimilation, the threat of arranged marriage, and the discovery of oil mark the path to an eventual reconciliation between the tribes.\n\nTuesday, February 1 (7:00pm)\n\nBlaxploitation\n\nBlack Caesar (Larco/AIP, 1973). Dir Larry Cohen. With Fred Williamson, Art Lund, Julius W. Harris, Gloria Hendry. (95 min, 35mm)\n\nA deep look into the Library's archive to get a second glimpse at forgotten or rarely seen films from the era of Blaxploitation. The talents of the genre's early stars; the sights and sounds of 1970's street culture; and wonderful music soundtracks made these films so popular among film audiences at the time.\n\nHail Caesar, Godfather of Harlem...The Cat with the .45-Caliber Claws! Fred Williamson fights to win back his Harlem turf from the mob in a style that can only be described as explosive! Larry Cohen shoots up the story and action and James Brown, the godfather of soul, provides the funky soundtrack.\n\nThursday, February 3 (7:00pm)\n\nOther Worlds ...\n\nBetween Two Worlds (Warner Bros., 1944). Dir Edward A. Blatt. With John Garfield, Eleanor Parker, Paul Henreid, Sydney Greenstreet. (112 min, 35mm)\n\nBased on the 1925 stage play \"Outward Bound\" by Sutton Vane and the 1930 film of the same title, Between Two Worlds \"is class entertainment on the allegorical side.” It is evident that a mystery ship and its passengers are bound for High Olympus and judgement day. On reaching their destination, Sydney Greenstreet enters the scene as the \"examiner,” taking his new arrivals one by one. In 1944, Variety said that \"Greenstreet’s performance is exceptionally outstanding.\" \"A productional, directional and acting triumph ...[and] in a technical way, notably the photography, Between Two Worlds represents a superior achievement.”\n\nFriday, February 4 (7:00pm)\n\nSet in DC\n\nGabriel Over the White House (Cosmopolitan/MGM, 1933). Dir Gregory La Cava. With Walter Huston, Karen Morley, Franchot Tone. (87 min, 35mm)\n\nImagine this scenario: a charismatic, devil-may-care U.S. President suffers a horrific accident. When he miraculously recovers, he has a completely different personality and initiates a radical agenda in order to fight the nation’s gravest problems. Could it be that a divine hand is guiding the leader of the free world? This one-of-a-kind exercise in political whimsy was the brainchild of Cosmopolitan Productions, William Randolph Hearst’s film company.\n\nTuesday, February 8 (7:00pm)\n\nOther Worlds ...\n\nPortrait of Jennie (Vanguard/Selznick, 1949). Dir William Dieterle. With Jennifer Jones, Joseph Cotton, Ethel Barrymore, Lillian Gish. (87 min, 16mm)\n\nThis film, which cost $4,250,000 including special effects -- an astronomical sum for the time -- failed when released by Selznick in 1948. The prohibitive cost caused him to liquidate Selznick International Studios and try his luck in Europe. \"Subtlety and understatement characterize Portrait of Jennie from start to finish, and the production, a failure thirty years ago, seems to have found its place in the hearts of dedicated film goers.” The original 35mm film was made in black and white with sepia and Technicolor sequences. We will be showing a 16mm black and white print.\n\nThursday, February 10 (6:30pm)\n\nSet in DC\n\nAdvise and Consent (Alpha-Alpina/Columbia, 1962). Dir Otto Preminger. With Henry Fonda, Charles Laughton, Don Murray, Walter Pidgeon. (140 min, 35mm)\n\nThe workings of the U.S. Senate become engrossing high drama in an adaptation of Allen Drury’s novel. A star-studded cast enacts various breeds of political animals against a background of alliances, intrigue, and the threat of scandal. The literate screenplay, which depicts Washington denizens as master rhetoricians, has sting and vitality; the widescreen black and white cinematography is its ideal visual complement.\n\nFriday, February 11 (7:00pm)\n\nModern Revivals of Classical-era Detectives\n\nDeadlier Than the Male (Universal, 1967). Dir Ralph Thomas. Based on the character Bulldog Drummond, created by Sapper. With Richard Johnson, Elke Sommer, Sylva Koscina, Nigel Green. (98 min, 35mm)\n\nAdventures of the Falcon : Tangier�s Finale (Federal Telefilms, 1954). Based on the character created by Michael Arlen. With Charles McGraw. (30 min, 16mm)\n\nTwo staples of classical Hollywood cinema during the 1920s-1940s were detectives Hugh “Bulldog” Drummond, an Englishman, and the American “the Falcon.” Both were subsequently revived in short-lived series, Drummond in a modern setting in two films starring Richard Johnson, and the Falcon in an early filmed television series.\n\nTuesday, February 15 (7:00)\n\nThe Female Detective\n\nThe Gracie Allen Murder Case (Paramount, 1939). Dir Alfred E. Green. Based on the character Philo Vance, created by S.S. Van Dine. With Warren William, Ellen Drew. (72 min, 16mm)\n\nNancy Drew Mysteries: The Mystery of Pirate�s Cove (Universal-TV, 1977). Dir E.W. Swackhamer. Based on the character created by Carolyn Keene. With Pamela Sue Martin. (60 min, 16mm)\n\nIn the 1930s, the idea of a woman detective was still considered a subject largely for humor, as demonstrated by Gracie’s encounter with Philo Vance. Even when Nancy Drew was brought to the screen during these same years, it was primarily for laughs, but the young adult literary hero finally achieved proper screen incarnation forty years later.\n\nThursday, February 17 (6:30pm)\n\nEast Meets West & West Meets East\n\nKhyber Patrol (UA-World Films, 1954). Dir Seymour Friedman. With Richard Egan, Dawn Addams, Patric Knowles, Raymond Burr. (71 min, 35mm)\n\nKung Fu [Pilot] (Warner Bros.-TV, 1972). Dir Jerry Thorpe. With David Carradine, Keye Luke, Richard Loo, Philip Ahn. (75 min, 16mm)\n\nOf the several early 1950s Hollywood treatments of the 19th century rebellions against English occupation of India, Khyber Patrol is the least seen. This typical story of Western colonial domination is paired with its opposite, the pilot film for the Kung Fu television series, in which Chinese and their traditions come to the American West.\n\nFriday, February 18 (7:00pm)\n\nBlaxploitation\n\nCool Breeze (MGM, 1972). Dir Barry Pollack. With Thalmus Rasulala, Judy Pace, Jim Watkins. (103 min, 35mm)\n\nHe hit the Man for $3 million. Right where it hurts. In the diamonds. And baby, that's cold. Thalmus Rasulala hits the man to start a bank of his own. This blaxploitation version of Robin Hood features early roles for Pam Grier and Paula Kelly. The story is loosely based on \"The Asphalt Jungle\". Music by Solomon Burke.\n\nTuesday, February 22 (7:00pm)\n\nSet in DC\n\nBeing There (Northstar International/UA, 1979). Dir Hal Ashby. With Peter Sellers, Shirley MacLaine, Jack Warner, Melvyn Douglas. (130 min, 35mm)\n\nPeter Sellers gives his loveliest, most understated performance as Chance, a simple-minded gardener who has spent his life watching TV. A gentle soul, Chance dazzles the Washington, D.C. elite with his wise pronouncements, which come straight from the idiot box. Released twenty-five years ago, this delicate yet corrosive critique of television culture is as relevant as ever\n\nThursday, February 24 (7:00pm)\n\nBlaxploitation\n\nTrouble Man (JDF-B Productions/20th Century-Fox, 1972). Dir Ivan Dixon. With Robert Hooks, Paul Winfield, Ralph Waite. (99 min, 35mm)\n\nMr. T is cold hard steel! He'll give you peace of mind...piece by piece. Robert Hooks shows why he's the man. Here is a gambler, loan shark, ladies man, and private eye who can give Shaft a run for his money anytime! Paula Kelly is lovely again with a music soundtrack from mister smooth himself, Marvin Gaye and jazz great, J.J. Johnson.\n\nFriday, February 25 (7:00pm)\n\nOther Worlds ...\n\nAngel on My Shoulder (Premier/UA, 1946). Dir Archie Mayo. With Paul Muni, Anne Baxter, Claude Rains. (100 min, 16mm)\n\nA murdered hood makes a deal with Lucifer to do the Devil’s bidding if allowed to return to earth. Paul Muni plays the murdered gangster, turning in a performance that measures up to his past credits. Claude Rains shines as a puckish Devil. Archie Mayo was a solid director of the time; though he never directed a superpower production in his thirty-year career, his work was always able and profitable. Mayo's contract was with RKO Pictures, and would come to an end in 1946. Angel on My Shoulder would have a dual significance, it was both the last picture that Mayo ever directed, and also it began a pseudo-retirement for its leading man.\n\nTuesday, March 1 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nPlay It As It Lays (FP Films/Universal, 1972). Dir Frank Perry. With Tuesday Weld, Anthony Perkins, Tammy Grimes. (99 min, 35mm)\n\nTuesday Weld is Maria, a B-movie actress from Silver Wells, Nevada (\"pop. then 28 now 0\"). Perkins, in one of his favorite performances, is B.Z., her producer. Together they share friendship and nihilism in the moral emptiness of 1970's Los Angeles. Profound ennui? Or alienation chic? Based on Joan Didion's novel, which \"defined a generation,\" and with visual effects by Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein. See Perkins and Weld’s first teaming, Pretty Poison, on March 18th.\n\nThursday, March 3 (6:30pm)\n\nMarion Davies\n\nGetting Mary Married (Marion Davies Film Co., 1919). Dir Allan Dwan. With Marion Davies, Norman Kerry, Matt Moore. (52 min, 16mm)\n\nBeauty's Worth (Cosmopolitan/Paramount, 1922). Dir Robert G. Vignola. With Marion Davies, Forrest Stanley, June Elvidge. (75 min, 35mm)\n\nFor Women’s History month we highlight the work of film actress and producer Marion Davies whose skillful comedic performances make her one of the most beloved stars of her generation. Tonight we screen two features from the silent era. Scripted by legendary screenwriters Anita Loos and John Emerson, Getting Mary Married makes comedy from the complications that arise when boy meets rich girl. In Beauty’s Worth, Davies is transformed from a “demure Quakeress” to a bathing beauty queen in this Cinderella-styled melodrama that Variety’s reviewer called “a first-class Marion Davies program release.”\n\nFriday, March 4 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nThe Buttercup Chain (Columbia British, 1971). Dir Robert Ellis Miller. With Hywel Bennett, Leigh Taylor-Young, Jane Asher, Sven-Bertil Taube. (103 min, 35mm)\n\nFrom the director of The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, a story of an intense friendship among four people that has tragic consequences. Jane Asher (Deep End) and Hywel Bennett are two English cousins who envelop a free-floating American (Taylor-Young) and a Swedish student (Taube) into their globe-trotting fun and games. Based on Janice Elliot’s novel, Buttercup Chain is a long-lost time capsule that was a rediscovered favorite at the 2002 and 2003 L.A. Mods & Rockers Fest.\n\nTuesday, March 8 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nBeyond the Valley of the Dolls (20th Century-Fox, 1970). Dir Russ Meyer. With Dolly Read, Cynthia Myers, Marcia McBroom, John LaZar. (109 min, 35mm)\n\nRuss Meyer (1922-2004) honed his craft as a combat photographer in WWII (some of his footage appears in Patton), which taught him to be efficient and resourceful. His \"drive-in Steinbeck\" period (Faster Pussycat, Kill Kill) showed a knack for beautiful films made in desolate locales on a g-string budget. Beyond the Valley of the Dolls is not one of those films. With major studio backing and a budget to match, BVD is a dizzy smorgasbord of baroque camera angles, rapid-fire editing, and technicolor characters. Meyer directed his actors to read melodramatic lines (courtesy of screenwriter Roger Ebert, long a champion of Meyer’s) with total seriousness - or with as much seriousness as can be got from, “Come into my den, said the spider, etcetera.” The result is psychedelic satire at its finest. Join us for three girls who sing rock and roll as they walk the Los Angeles gauntlet of side-burned record moguls, Greek gods, Nazi war criminals, and the Strawberry Alarm Clock.\n\nThursday, March 10 (6:30pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nThe Day Mars Invaded Earth (Associated Producers/20th Century-Fox, 1963). Dir Maury Dexter. With Kent Taylor, Marie Windsor, William Mims. (70 min, 35mm)\n\nUnearthly Stranger (Independent Artists/AIP, 1963). Dir John Krish. With John Neville, Gabriella Licudi, Philip Stone, Patrick Newell. (75 min, 16mm)\n\nA rare screening of two Cold War-era alien invasion thrillers. Such low-budget sci-fi noirs eschewed makeup and special effects so that anyone could be a space-alien. In the eerie Day Mars Invaded Earth, a scientist sends a probe to Mars. After the probe is mysteriously destroyed, the scientist retreats to an L.A. mansion to spend some needed quality time with his family. Unbeknownst to him, Martians, in retaliation for the probe, have sent doppelgangers to his mansion, wrecking more than just his home life. In the paranoid world of Unearthly Stranger, men are from Earth and women are from somewhere Out There. Brilliantly directed by documentary filmmaker Krish, this \"lost\" film is less about the Cold War than it is about the deep anxieties that surrounded the changing role of women in 60's Britain. Scientist John Neville (The X Files) is just nuts about his gorgeous young wife, who’s great in the kitchen and all other departments. But why, he wonders, does she always sleep with her eyes open?\n\nFriday, March 11 (7:00pm)\n\nMarion Davies\n\nIt's A Wise Child (MGM, 1931). Dir Robert Z. Leonard. With Marion Davies, James Gleason, Sidney Blackmer. (83 min, 35mm)\n\nA racy comedy based on David Belasco Broadway production of the same title. Marion Davies plays a young woman who becomes the subject of local gossip when she is mistakenly believed to be single and pregnant. The film, according to the Variety review, should not be screened “in houses playing to children or young people.” The frank language, references to pre-marital sex and the use of alcohol, shocked critics who found it wasn’t “fathomable” how the picture made it past the then lenient enforcement of the Hays Office. Silent screen beauty Marie Prevost also stars in this wild precode talkie.\n\nMonday, March 14 (7:00pm)\n\nEnvironmental Film Festival\n\nNavajo (Bartlett-Foster Productions, 1952). Dir Norman Foster. (71 min, 35mm)\n\nCruise of the Zaca (Vitaphone, 1952) Dir & Narrator Errol Flynn. (20 min, 35mm)\n\nNorman Foster is best remembered today for his collaborations with Orson Welles and Walt Disney (including the original Davy Crockett), and a number of the Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto films. Foster was also one of the generation of studio era directors who successfully made the transition to television, and whose work spanned A and B films and a number of independent efforts. Among these was Navajo, shot for $50,000 on the Indian reservation, with non-professional actors who had never seen a movie before, telling of a boy adjusting to a life of tradition and modernity. Navajo received an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary Feature and numerous other prizes. Foster returned to similar themes in a number of later films, including a version of the children's classic Brighty of the Grand Canyon (March 15). Another of Hollywood's elite to have an interest in nature was none other than star Errol Flynn, who filmed a 16mm feature detailing a 1946 voyage down the coast of Mexico on his 118 foot schooner. Aboard were his father, a scientist, and then-wife Nora Eddington, whose subsequent lawsuit caused the long delay in release from Warner Bros., which had bought the footage.\n\nTuesday, March 15 (7:00pm)\n\nEnvironmental Film Festival\n\nBrighty of the Grand Canyon (Stephen F. Booth Productions, 1966). Dir Norman Foster. With Joseph Cotten, Dick Foran, Karl Swenson. (89 min, 35mm)\n\nThursday, March 17 (6:30pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nThe Woman from Monte Carlo (First National, 1932). Dir Michael Curtiz. With Lil Dagover, Walter Huston, Warren William. (65 min, 35mm)\n\nThe Congress Dances (UFA, 1931). Dir Erik Charell. With Lil Dagover, Conrad Veidt, Lilian Harvey. (86 min, 16mm, English subtitles)\n\nA double-feature starring German movie star Lil Dagover. We begin with her first American film, a Michael Curtiz directed melodrama about a former playgirl from Vienna who finds herself torn between her husband (Huston) and an old lover (William) during WWI. Followed by The Congress Dances, a German operetta set in 1814 during the Congress of Vienna where romance and intrigue take precedent over politics and policy.\n\nFriday, March 18 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nPretty Poison (Turman-Molino/20th Century-Fox, 1968). Dir Noel Black. With Anthony Perkins, Tuesday Weld, Beverly Garland. (89 min, 35mm)\n\nThe roles that Tuesday Weld turned down read like a best-films list from the 1960's: Lolita, Rosemary’s Baby, Bonnie and Clyde. On her rejection of Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice, Weld said simply: “It reeked of success.” She worked instead on films like Pretty Poison, which did not smell so sweet. All is not apple pie behind the white picket fence. Ex-con Perkins charms drum majorette Weld with fantastic and untrue tales of intrigue. Will she fall prey to his pathology? Or is this a chance for her to release her own pathogens? Championed by Pauline Kael and written by a script consultant for the Batman television series, this black comedy anticipates the middle-American irony of David Lynch.\n\nTuesday, March 22 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nDie! Die! My Darling! aka Fanatic (Hammer/Columbia, 1965). Dir Silvio Narizzano. With Tallulah Bankhead, Stefanie Powers, Donald Sutherland. (97 min, 35mm)\n\nPreceded by: Amelia (from Trilogy of Terror) (ABC, 1975). Dir Dan Curtis. With Karen Black. (27 min, 35mm)\n\nScripted by Richard Matheson (The Incredible Shrinking Man), Die! Die! features Tallulah Bankhead’s last film role, for which she gave her all. Bride-to-be Stephanie Powers visits her late ex-boyfriend’s mother, Bankhead, who has become a religious fanatic. Big mistake.Shown with Amelia, (rescheduled from Oct. 28), the infamous final chapter of a trio of stories by Matheson. It caused a sensation when it aired on ABC in 1975, terrifying even network executives. In a tour de force, Karen Black portrays a woman battling a demonic Zuni fetish doll.\n\nThursday, March 24 (7:00pm)\n\nMusical Remakes\n\nMen in Black (Columbia, 1934). Dir Raymond McCarey. With Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard. (20 min)\n\nMy Sister Eileen (Columbia, 1942). Dir Alexander Hall. With Rosalind Russell, Janet Blair. (97 min, 35mm)\n\nThis series is dedicated to the memory of William “Bill” Barry (1956-2001), a Library of Congress moving image reference assistant. In this screen adaption of the Broadway comedy (also see the musical adaptation on March 29), two sisters move from a small town in Ohio to the Greenwich Village area of New York City. Russell (post-His Girl Friday) plays the older sister who becomes a writer while Blair is the prettier sister who turns to acting. Not much of a plot here but many colorful characters chip in to create uproarious situations throughout the flick. The last scene is not to be missed - it’s simply hilarious. Prior to the feature, the Men in Black to be shown is not the first of the Will Smith/Tommy Lee Jones franchise but rather the beginning of an earlier and greater franchise: the Three Stooges, in their first short.\n\nFriday, March 25 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nWitchcraft '70 (PAC/Caravel/Trans American, 1969). Dir Luigi Scattini. Narrator Edmund Purdom. (82 min, 35mm)\n\nBewitched Bunny (Warner Bros., 1954). Dir Chuck Jones. (7 min, 35mm)\n\nDoctor Ha-Ha (Terrytoons/20th Century-Fox, 1966). Dir Ralph Bakshi. (6 min, 16mm)\n\nErotic prayers to the Goddess of the cloven hoof; human sacrifice on the bloodstained altar of Baal; weird demonic rites of the Cult of Kali; the sensual ecstasies of hippie families; these are just some of the subjects documented in this unjustly forgotten piece of Mondo cinema. Shown with Bewitched Bunny, in which Bugs is walking through the woods one day and stumbles upon Hansel and Gretel. Our heroic rabbit rescues the greedy pair from a hungry witch - but no good deed goes unpunished. Also shown with Doctor Ha-Ha, a rarely seen short by master animator Ralph Bakshi (Heavy Traffic). Ha-Ha is the first of a series of James Hound cartoons Bakshi made for Terrytoons, a studio that also produced Mighty Mouse, Deputy Dawg, and Bakshi's breakout hit Spiderman.\n\nTuesday, March 29 (7:00pm)\n\nMusical Remakes\n\nMy Sister Eileen (Columbia, 1955). Dir Richard Quine. With Betty Garrett, Janet Leigh, Jack Lemmon, Bob Fosse. (112 min, 35mm)\n\nThis is not the Leonard Bernstein/Betty Comden/Adolph Green musical adaptation as you would guess - this is not Wonderful Town (also see the original screen adaption on March 24th). But rather this musical remake boasts a score by Jule Styne (music) and Leo Robin (lyrics) and a screenplay by Blake Edwards (pre-TV drama Peter Gunn) and Richard Quine. The cast includes the lovely and recently departed Leigh (pre-Psycho) as Eileen, Garrett as Ruth, Lemmon (in a musical? - he’s great!), and Fosse (pre-Damn Yankees) - he acts, choreographs, and dances here. Watch for Dick York (pre-Bewitched) as a roughneck football throwing next door neighbor.\n\nThursday, March 31 (7:00pm)\n\nMusical Remakes\n\nThe Matchmaker (Paramount, 1958). Dir Joseph Anthony. With Shirley Booth, Anthony Perkins, Paul Ford, Shirley MacLaine. (100 min, 35mm)\n\nThe film adaptation of Thornton Wilder’s period comedy (also see the musical adaption Hello, Dolly! on April 8) has many charming qualities. Booth, showing her comic timing (pre-TV sitcom Hazel), plays Dolly Levi as a middle aged matchmaker striving to turn Ford (pre-Mayor Shinn in The Music Man), her older middle aged shopowner client into her next husband. In the midst of her schemes, the younger characters: Tony Perkins (pre-Psycho), Shirley MacLaine, Robert Morse (pre-How to Succeed in Business...), and Perry Wilson (the film director’s wife) take the plot to many farce-filled turns.\n\nFriday, April 1 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nWelcome to Arrow Beach (Brut/Warner Bros., 1974). Dir Laurence Harvey. With Laurence Harvey, Joanna Pettet, Stuart Whitman, John Ireland. (99 min, 35mm)\n\nAlice Cans the Cannibals (Winkler, 1925). Dir Walt Disney. (9 min, 35mm)\n\nJason (director-star Harvey) is a Korean war vet. He survived in the jungle by eating human flesh, but now has trouble adapting to civilian life. His sister Grace (Joanna Pettet), shares his apetite -- and his bed. They befriend a hitchhiker (Meg Foster) - will she be his next victim? The great Lou Rawls sings the haunting theme. Harvey was so dedicated to Arrow Beach, his last film, that it is rumored he helped edit it from his deathbed - by telephone. A twisted horror film that has been rarely seen since its release.\n\nTuesday, April 5 (7:00pm)\n\nJohn Carpenter�The Beginnings\n\nDark Star (Jack H. Harris Enterprises, 1974). Dir John Carpenter. With Brian Narelle, Cal Kuniholm, Dre Pahich, Dan O�Bannon. (83 min, 35mm)\n\nJohn Carpenter began working on this loose parody of 2001: A Space Odyssey while still a film student at USC. His directorial debut tells the story of four astronauts trapped in space on a very dull mission, and their futile attempts at amusing themselves. With the help of special effects supervisor Dan O’Bannon, Carpenter managed to achieve surprisingly impressive visual effects despite his low budget. O’Bannon, who later penned the screenplay for Alien, also served as editor, co-writer, production designer, and starred in the film, as Pinback. In addition to composing the well-known theme for his signature work Halloween (shown on April 22nd), Carpenter also wrote the original music for Dark Star and Assault on Precinct 13 (April 14th).\n\nThursday, April 7 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nLucky Luciano (Vides/Films La Boetie/Avco Embassy, 1973). Dir. Francesco Rosi. With Gian Maria Volonte, Rod Steiger, Edmond O�Brien. (112 min, 35mm)\n\nBugs and Thugs (Warner Bros., 1954). Dir I. Freleng. (7 min, 35mm)\n\nDirector Francesco Rosi (Salvatore Giuliano) explores the loveless marriage of crime and politics in this meditation on the infamous New York gangster. The brilliant Gian Maria Volonte (Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion) is Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano; Charles Siragusa plays himself, the narc who in real life helped bring down an empire. Shown with Bugs and Thugs, in which our favorite rabbit hitches a ride with a pair of mismatched bank robbers. This technicolor classic is the first appearance of Mugsy (\"Shut up shuttin' up\").\n\nFriday, April 8 (6:30pm)\n\nMusical Remakes\n\nHello, Dolly! (20th Century-Fox, 1969). Dir Gene Kelly. With Barbra Streisand, Walter Matthau, Michael Crawford, Tommy Tune, Louis Armstrong. (144 min, 35mm)\n\nWho cares if Fox almost went bankrupt with this and two other musicals (Star! and Dr. Doolittle) ? One can’t please everyone - the majority of the critics didn’t care for the author’s middle aged Dolly Levi being portrayed by a 25 year old Barbra Streisand (also see the first screen adaption on March 31). Regrettably, Streisand and Walter Matthau didn’t get along on the set, and the Library’s film copy is a faded color print. Nevertheless, such and other flaws pale into insignificance when set beside the well over two hours of great songs written by Jerry Herman, impressive choreography under the direction of Michael Kidd, along with many enormous and beautiful sets. It’s a treat viewing Crawford (pre-Phantom of the Opera), catching Satchmo Armstrong sing a duet with this younger Dolly, and in a small role watching Tommy Tune dance during his heyday.\n\nTuesday, April 12 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nThe Postman Always Rings Twice (MGM, 1946). Dir Tay Garnett. With Lana Turner, John Garfield, Cecil Kellaway, Hume Cronyn. (113 min, 35mm)\n\nIn one of the best Hollywood film noirs of the 1940's, Garfield and Turner sizzle as lovers caught up in a web of murder, deception, and treachery. Originally published in 1934, James M. Cain's fatalistic view of the American Dream gone awry was previously filmed in France (1939) and Italy (1942). MGM purchased the rights to the story in the mid-1930's, but dropped the project when the Production Code Administration labeled the novel \"unwholesome and thoroughly objectionable.\"\n\nThursday, April 14 (7:00pm)\n\nJohn Carpenter�The Beginnings\n\nAssault on Precinct 13 (CKK Productions, 1976). Dir John Carpenter. With Austin Stoker, Darwin Joston, Laurie Zimmer, Martin West. (91 min, 35mm)\n\nIn John Carpenter’s second feature, inspired by Howard Hawks’ Rio Bravo (Carpenter edited the film under the name John T. Chance, John Wayne’s character in Rio Bravo), a street gang wages war on a police station that is on the verge of closing. A small staff awaiting the moving vans, along with two death row inmates, must defend themselves against the assault. Due to an unplanned programming coincidence, the John Carpenter - The Beginnings series coincides with the release of the Assault on Precinct 13 remake (January 2005), providing an opportunity for theatrical comparison of Hollywood’s big budget of today with Carpenter’s meager $200,000 budget in 1976.\n\nFriday, April 15 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nWhere�s Charley? (Warner Bros., 1952). Dir David Butler. With Ray Bolger, Allyn McLerie, Robert Shackleton. (97 min, 35mm)\n\nWhat a drag! This adaptation of the Frank Loesser Broadway musical has been rarely screened since its original release and has never been available in any home format. According to theatre columnist Peter Filichia, the wife of the late composer, Jo Loesser, \"neither likes [the film] nor wants anyone to see it.\" So take advantage of this rare opportunity to see Ray Bolger recreate his famous stage performance.\n\nTuesday, April 19 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nA Million Bid (Warner Bros., 1927). Dir Michael Curtiz. With Dolores Costello, Warner Oland, Malcolm McGregor. (65 min, 35mm)\n\nA melodrama of shipwrecks and amnesia, this Michael Curtiz film was considered lost until a few years ago when a tinted nitrate print of the Italian release version surfaced in Bologna (Italy). Preserved for the Library of Congress by L'Immagine Ritrovata, one of the world's top film restoration facilities, the new print was screened at last year's Bologna Film Festival and tonight will have its American premiere. Preceded by two Vitaphone shorts of the same vintage.\n\nThursday, April 21 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nCall Me Madam (20th Century-Fox, 1953). Dir Walter Lang. With Ethel Merman, Donald O�Connor, Vera-Ellen, George Sanders. (118 min, 35mm)\n\nGeorge Sanders sings Irving Berlin! (Or does he?!) Well, not much anyway. But fortunately there always the Musical Diva herself, Ethel Merman, in a star turn. Needless to say, Merman + Musical = Must See.\n\nFriday, April 22 (7:00pm)\n\nJohn Carpenter�The Beginnings\n\nHalloween (Falcon International, 1978). Dir John Carpenter. With Donald Pleasence, Jamie Lee Curtis, Nancy Loomis. (86 min, 35mm)\n\nJohn Carpenter’s first commercially successful film not only became his most famous work, it also ushered in the dawn of the slasher film. It is Halloween night, and Michael Myers - the first of many big screen human-but-invincible homicidal maniacs - has escaped from his mental institution and is hunting teenagers in his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois. Those with more libido than brains had better be careful! Jamie Lee Curtis was introduced to moviegoers as the heroine, Laurie (audiences may remember that Curtis was known as a “scream queen” early in her career, starring in only horror and thriller films through the early 1980s). Even after years of imitation and genre elements that are now considered cliché, Carpenter’ s style - point-of-view shots, tense editing, and that piano score - has helped to keep Halloween uniquely artistic and frightening.\n\nTuesday, April 26 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nCompulsion (Darryl F. Zanuck/20th Century-Fox, 1959). Dir. Richard Fleischer. With Orson Welles, Diane Varsi, Dean Stockwell, Bradford Dillman. (103 min, 35mm)\n\nIntense and yet economical adaptation of Meyer Levin's 1956 novel about two wealthy teenagers who kidnap and murder a young boy in 1920's Chicago. The novel was a fictionalized account of the Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb case, which has inspired several stage and screen productions, including Alfred Hitchcock's celebrated film Rope. Stockwell and Dillman are outstanding as the young psychopaths, while Welles revels in the role based on defense lawyer Clarence Darrow, whose moving summation of his twelve-hour long plea to save his clients' lives still stands as one of the most eloquent attacks on the death penalty ever delivered in an American courtroom (as Variety pointed out, Welles in turn provided \"one of the longest monologues ever filmed\"). The trio shared the Best Actor award at the 1959 Cannes film festival.\n\nWednesday, April 27 (7:00pm) re-scheduled from 2/24/2005\n\nBlaxploitation\n\nTrouble Man (JDF-B Productions/20th Century-Fox, 1972). Dir Ivan Dixon. With Robert Hooks, Paul Winfield, Ralph Waite. (99 min, 35mm)\n\nMr. T is cold hard steel! He'll give you peace of mind...piece by piece. Robert Hooks shows why he's the man. Here is a gambler, loan shark, ladies man, and private eye who can give Shaft a run for his money anytime! Paula Kelly is lovely again with a music soundtrack from mister smooth himself, Marvin Gaye and jazz great, J.J. Johnson.\n\nThursday, April 28 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nThe Lusty Men (RKO, 1952). Dir Nicholas Ray. With Robert Mitchum, Arthur Kennedy, Susan Hayward. (113 min, 35mm)\n\nNicholas Ray has been cinematic father to a host of directors, but none quite so profoundly as Wim Wenders. Wenders is now better known for music documentaries like Buena Vista Social Club, but as an exemplar of the New German Cinema in the 70s and 80s, he turned out a remarkable series of features that secured his reputation as peer to his fellow directors R.W. Fassbinder and Werner Herzog. But for Wenders, all roads lead back to Nicholas Ray, whose failing health and eventual death Wenders chronicled in his 1980 film Lightning Over Water. Tonight and tomorrow we pair spiritual father and son with two of their finest works: Ray's The Lusty Men and Wenders' Paris, Texas.\n\nNicholas Ray was the archetypal film nomad, wandering in and out of the studio system before rejecting Hollywood altogether in the 1960s. Similarly, we see this theme of rootlessness, a search for home and grounding, repeatedly in his films. In The Lusty Men, Robert Mitchum is a retired rodeo rider whose mentoring of a younger man (Arthur Kennedy) and his wife (Susan Hayward), completely upends their domestic yearnings. Mitchum's acting is brilliantly understated, but although his character is in no way as psychopathic as those he played in Night of the Hunter or Cape Fear (to name but two examples), his presence generates the same sense of threat and disruption, this time to the young couple's dreams and desires. The Lusty Men is rarely mentioned in the same breath with Ray's more well-known works, but it certainly stands with them.\n\nFriday, April 29 (6:30pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nParis, Texas (20th Century-Fox, 1984). Dir Wim Wenders. With Harry Dean Stanton, Dean Stockwell, Nastassja Kinski. (145 min, 35mm)\n\nParis, Texas is more directly descended from John Ford's The Searchers, but there's more than a touch of Nicholas Ray present. After years of wandering in the physical and psychological wilderness, Harry Dean Stanton returns to his brother's (Dean Stockwell) home, where he slowly reconnects with the family including wife Nastassja Kinski he abandoned. Like The Lusty Men, Paris, Texas is a film of disconnect, where the domestic sphere is seen as something unreachable and idealized, like the picture of a vacant lot that Stanton carries with him as a talisman. Co-written with Sam Shepard, Paris, Texas is Wender's most fully realized narrative film, its brilliant images of desert and city enhanced by Ry Cooder's mesmerizing score.\n\nCurrent Film Schedule: May - September 2005\n\nThursday, April 28 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nThe Lusty Men (RKO, 1952).

Dir Lowell Sherman. With Katharine Hepburn, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Adolphe Menjou. (73 min, 16mm)\n\nSpitfire (RKO, 1934). Dir John Cromwell. With Katharine Hepburn, Robert Young, Ralph Bellamy. (88 min, 35mm)\n\nA double dose of Hepburn from her great RKO period. Morning Glory won her the first Oscar of her career for the portrayal of a stage struck ingenue trying to crack the jaded New York theater world. Here Hepburn, the original androgen, is in her element, crafting an ingenious disguise of feminine delicacy upon her natural boyish disposition. In Spitfire she attempts the character of Trigger Hicks, a backwoods Ozark tomboy, a role considerably less suited to her erudite Bryn Mawr deportment. For better or worse, the intensity of Hepburn's own personality always explodes the confines of the melodramas she is forced to inhabit.\n\nWednesday, May 11 (7:00pm)\n\nHeart of Darkness: The Vietnam Experience\n\nHamburger Hill (RKO Pictures/Paramount, 1987). Dir John Irvin. With Anthony Barrile, Michael Patrick Boatman, Don Cheadle, Dylan McDermott, Courtney B. Vance. (110 min, 35mm)\n\nIn May 1969, the 3rd Battalion, 187th Infantry of the U.S. Army fought a fierce, ten-day battle for a small rise known to the Vietnamese as Dong Ap Bia, designated by the U.S. military as Hill 937, and nicknamed by cynical GIs Hamburger Hill. Director John Irvin (The Dogs of War), working from a script by Vietnam vet James Carabatsos, fashioned a gritty account of that battle, in which the North Vietnamese Army uncharacteristically stood and fought the Americans straight up. Although air support pounded NVA positions with over 500 tons of bombs and 70 tons of napalm, the hill wasn't taken until ground forces succeeded in a series of hand-to-hand battles fought on muddy, monsoon-soaked terrain. Once the hill was secured, it was policed for a few days and then abandoned, leading some to wonder what the point of the battle was. (\"Don't mean nothin'\" is the refrain muttered by the GIs portrayed here.) The film's ensemble cast, full of no-names (at the time), features recent Oscar nominee Don Cheadle in his third screen appearance, as Private Washburn. Presented by the Veterans History Project, of the Library's American Folklife Center.\n\nThursday, May 12 (6:30pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nLost Horizon (Ross Hunter/Columbia, 1973). Dir Charles Jarrott. With Peter Finch, Liv Ullmann, Sally Kellerman, George Kennedy, Michael York. (160 min, 35mm)\n\nColonialist travelers crash in the Himalayas and discover the paradise Shangri-La. Yet there’s a fine line between Utopia and dystopia. This musical remake of Frank Capra's 1937 classic (adapted from the novel by James Hilton) is regarded as one of the great follies of 1970's American cinema. Songwriter Burt Bacharach and choreographer Hermes Pan (who got somewhat better results in his work with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers) fail to raise this up on eagles' wings. Come to the Pickford Theater and wallow in a singular American mediocrity.\n\nFriday, May 13 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nThe Petrified Forest (Warner Bros., 1936). Dir Archie Mayo. With Leslie Howard, Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart. (83 min, 35mm)\n\nPull My Daisy (G-String Enterprises, 1959). Dir Robert Frank, Alfred Leslie. With Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, Larry Rivers. (30 min, 35mm)\n\nA poetic drifter, a culture hungry dreamer, and a gangster willing to wax philosophical meet up under strained circumstances at a lonely desert roadhouse. The elements whip into a frenzy as the tension mounts and it all adds up to a fascinating character study that presages Key Largo. The motifs of loss and sacrifice are handled with stellar acting and rich dialogue. This was the cinematic breakthrough for Bogart and he was so grateful to Howard for landing him the role that he named his first daughter Leslie. The screenplay was adapted by Delmer Daves and Charles Kenyon from Pulitzer Prize winner Robert Sherwood's hit Broadway play. Shown with Pull My Daisy, the 1959 short film that encapsulates the Beat Generation. It is loosely based on Kerouac's unpublished play, The Beat Generation, taken from an event in Neal and Carolyn Cassady's life. Kerouac improvises the narration with his usual jazzy diction\n\nTuesday, May 17 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nUrgh! A Music War (Lorimar, 1981). Dir Derek Burbidge. With The Police, UB 40, Oingo Boingo, Echo and the Bunnymen, Klaus Nomi, Dead Kennedys. (124 min, 35mm)\n\nThis compilation of rock 'n' roll bands filmed in concert is a raucous, liberating look at the new wave/punk scene circa 1980. In the era when music video became the dominant visual medium for pop music performers, Urgh! captured these exciting, innovative, and sometimes bizarre artists live and at their energizing best. A genuine time machine of a movie that will take you back to a turbulent period in popular culture.\n\nWednesday, May 18 (6:30pm)\n\nHeart of Darkness: The Vietnam Experience\n\nThe Anderson Platoon = La Patrouille Anderson (ORTF/Pathe, 1967). Dir Pierre Schoendoerffer. (65 min, 35mm)\n\nMeet the Press. Civil Rights Special (NBC, Aug. 21, 1966). With Martin Luther King, Jr., Roy Wilkins, Whitney Young, Jr., James Meredith, Stokely Carmichael, and Floyd B. McKissick. (90 min, Digital Betacam video)\n\nAfter Pierre Schoendoerffer served with the French Army in Vietnam in the 1950s, he became a filmmaker. His fourth film was a dramatic feature about his service experiences, La Secion 317e (The 317th Platoon), released in 1965. French National Television then commissioned him to spend six weeks in the fall of 1966 following an American platoon for this documentary. The title refers to Lt. Joseph Anderson, a black West Point graduate who commanded an interracial unit of blacks, Hispanics, and whites. It's an observant portrait of the daily life of the soldier which won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. Shown with a 1966 broadcast of Meet the Press, which expanded its format to 90 minutes for this discussion with some of the leading lights of the Civil Rights Movement on the negative impact of the Vietnam War on American blacks.\n\nPresented by the Veterans History Project, of the Library's American Folklife Center.\n\nThursday, May 19 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nMonte Cristo (Selig, 1908). Dir Francis Boggs. (ca. 10 min, 35mm)\n\nThe Count of Monte Cristo (Reliance/UA, 1934). Dir Rowland V. Lee. With Robert Donat, Elissa Landi, Louis Calhern, Sidney Blackmer (113 min, 35mm)\n\nProducer Edward Small delayed production on this picture while he protested Universal's use of the title The Countess of Monte Cristo for a comedy starring Fay Wray. Small warned the Hays Office that Countess would take \"all of the edge off his Count\" and confuse the movie-going public. Universal nevertheless released Countess, and Rowland Lee's Count was still named one of the ten best pictures of 1934. Robert Donat makes his American screen debut in a well-received performance. Shown with a 1908 short preserved by the AFI at the LOC Motion Picture Conservation Center. Selig cinematographer Tom Persons recalled shooting the film: \"Our great scene was to show Edmond emerging from the sea, shaking his white whiskers, and saying ‘The world is mine!’ [We] found the right man at last -- a hypnotist in a dime museum -- and after we had seen him work we knew he had nerve enough for anything.\"\n\nFriday, May 20 (7:00pm)\n\nFirst Nations/First Features (in person: Randy Redroad)\n\nThe Doe Boy (Doe Boy Productions, 2001). Dir Randy Redroad. With James Duval, Kevin Anderson, Gordon Tootoosis, Andrew J. Ferchland. (83 min, 35mm)\n\nSet in the heart of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, The Doe Boy tells the story of Hunter, a young man of mixed parentage, who is never quite at home in the complicated circumstances of his life - including his hemophilia. Eventually he must find a way to be his own man, facing love, death, and the perils of his illness. The Doe Boy is an official selection of the First Nations/First Features, a showcase of world indigenous cinema screening in Washington, D.C. on May 18-22, 2005. This project has been produced by the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian, the Museum of Modern Art and New York University in cooperation with the National Museum of Natural History, National Gallery or Art, Freer Gallery of Art / Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, Embassy of Canada, National Museum of Women in the Arts, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden and the Library of Congress.

Dir Peter Ustinov. With Terence Stamp, Peter Ustinov, Robert Ryan, Melvyn Douglas. (123 min, 35mm)\n\nThe late, great Ustinov produced, directed, wrote and acted in this adaptation of Melville's allegorical classic. Everyone on board a British Man O' War (circa 1797) loves angelic Billy (Terence Stamp in his screen debut), with the fateful exception of the sadistic master at arms Claggart (Robert Ryan). Emotions inevitably come to a head, leading to a wrenching climax for all concerned.\n\nWednesday, May 25 (7:00pm)\n\nHeart of Darkness: The Vietnam Experience\n\nIn the Year of the Pig (Monday Film Production Co./New Yorker Films, 1968). Dir Emile de Antonio. (97 min, 16mm)\n\nMeet the Press [Nov. 3, 1968] (NBC). Dir Max Schindler. With Richard M. Nixon (guest), Lawrence E. Spivak (moderator), Vermont Royster, Robert Novak, Haynes Johnson, and Herbert Kaplow (panelists). (30 min, 16mm)\n\nLike Michael Moore, Emile de Antonio (1920-1989) was a rumpled and frankly left-leaning partisan nonfiction filmmaker. Unlike Moore, de Antonio was less interested in on-camera confrontations than in combing footage archives for telling clips. His debut film was compiled from kinescopes of TV coverage of the Army-McCarthy hearings; Point of Order! remains the definitive film portrait of Senator Joseph McCarthy's self-immolation. This documentary, reportedly financed by New York society matron whose husband was a prominent attorney specializing in human rights cases, was released in 1969, when the anti-war movement was in full flower. For de Antonio, Pig represented an opportunity to create a document that would discredit the policies and philosophies that enmeshed America in its increasingly futile crusade in Southeast Asia. While In The Year of the Pig features thoughtful and passionate critiques of the war from David Halberstam, Harrison Salisbury, and Daniel Berrigan, it also offers generous footage of what de Antonio would call the war's apologists: politicians (Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon), bureaucrats (John Foster Dulles, Dean Rusk, Henry Cabot Lodge), and generals (Curtis LeMay, William Westmoreland), who were to a man dead certain that history would judge that they and the U.S. were making the world safe for democracy. It's hardly fair and balanced filmmaking, as a reviewer on the Internet Movie Data Base web site discovered, calling In the Year of the Pig \"100% Red propaganda\" and claiming its lies about the war literally made him sick to his stomach. In the Meet the Press broadcast of November 3, 1968, on the eve of the Presidential election, Republican candidate Richard Nixon discusses President Johnson's temporary halt to bombing in Vietnam. (Nixon was the subject of de Antonio's 1971 documentary, Millhouse: A White Comedy.) Presented by the Veterans History Project, of the Library's American Folklife Center.\n\nThursday, May 26 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nFriday Foster (AIP, 1975). Dir Arthur Marks. With Pam Grier, Yaphet Kotto, Godfrey Cambridge, Eartha Kitt, Scatman Crothers. (88 min, 35mm)\n\nPam Grier is Friday Foster, an ex-model turned magazine photographer who witnesses a deadly shootout at Los Angeles International Airport. Suspicious connections indicate she has gotten herself in a world of trouble and is in deep with the ongoing investigation. Location shots in Washington, DC, include the Library of Congress, with many flights of fancy in this jet set adventure. A big budget film by blaxploitation standards. Music by Luchi De Jesus.\n\nFriday, May 27 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nHappy As the Day Is Long: Music by Harold Arlen. Recorded sound presentation with two film excerpts.\n\nThe Pickford Theater celebrates composer Harold Arlen's centennial with a recorded sound presentation of his music from the years 1930 to 1954. Film excerpts from The Songs of Harold Arlen, broadcast on CBS in 1964, and Judy Garland's performance of \"The Man That Got Away\" from A Star Is Born (1954) will conclude the program, hosted by M/B/RS staffer David Novack.\n\nFellow composer Alec Wilder wrote of Arlen: \"When I discussed song writing with him, Arlen never spoke of hits; he talked only of good songs. My feeling was that he didn't simply equate quality with sales. And it may be that the early songs of his I heard sounded more like those of a man who loved to write and who loved the creative act for its excitement and fulfillment, rather than one who was simply in the song writing business.\"\n\nTuesday, May 31 (7:00pm)\n\nRural America (in person: Laura Kissel)\n\nCabin Field (2004). Dir Laura Kissel. (30 min, video) copy will be provided by filmmaker\n\nCabin in the Cotton (First National, 1932). Dir Michael Curtiz. With Richard Barthelmess, Dorothy Jordan, Bette Davis, Hardie Albright. (77 min, 35mm)\n\nThe depiction of rural America on film has frequently resided at the extremes. Sometimes it's a cultural and socioeconomic backwater, but other times a bucolic vista of common sense values and homespun virtues. This week we present three programs that touch on these themes, although with more depth than is typical for Hollywood fare. Tonight's feature is Cabin in the Cotton, which comes straight out of the Warner Bros. early 1930s \"social consciousness\" playbook, tackling the scourge of tenant farming. There's more than a hint of Southern Gothic in the tale, especially the blazing performance of a young Bette Davis in her breakthrough role as the vixen Madge Norwood (\"Ah'd let yuh kiss me, but I jes' washed mah hair\"). But it's the surprisingly rich portrayal of the tenant \"peckerwoods\" that's the draw here; there's a sort of honesty dignity to these people that overcomes the condescending pieties with which Hollywood typically imbued these sorts of characters.\n\nSouth Carolina filmmaker Laura Kissel will join us to screen her award-winning documentary Cabin Field, which traces the history of a mile long agricultural field in south Georgia. What emerges is a portrait of more than just a plot of land, but rather a complex tapestry of social changes and mechanization that forever changed the world portrayed in Cabin in the Cotton.\n\nWednesday, June 1 (6:30pm)\n\nHeart of Darkness: The Vietnam Experience\n\n84 Charlie MoPic (Charlie Mopic Co., 1989). Dir Patrick Sheane Duncan. With Jonathan Emerson, Nicholas Cascone, Jason Tomlins, Christopher Burgard. (95 min, 35mm)\n\nCBS Reports. The Selling of the Pentagon (CBS, Feb. 23, 1971). Writer/Producer Peter Davis, Reporter Roger Mudd. (60 min, 16mm)\n\nMoPic is slang for Army Motion Picture Unit, and that is the moniker for the central character in this little-seen docudrama. He's a cameraman (Byron Thames) assigned to cover the activities of a unit slogging through the Vietnamese countryside. The film's stylistic conceit is that almost everything we see is through the lens of MoPic's camera. At the center of this drama is the usual war film dynamic between the untested officer (Jonathan Emerson) in charge and the seen-it-all sergeant (Richard Brooks). Writer-director Deane was a Vietnam vet, and the film reflects an authenticity that many bigger-budgeted films about the war lacked. Roger Ebert wrote of 84 Charlie MoPic, \"I've never seen a combat movie that seemed this close to actual experience, to the kinds of hard lessons that soldiers are taught by their enemies.\" CBS's The Selling of the Pentagon, a hard-hitting examination of the Department of Defense's public relations efforts, created a political firestorm after it aired. Supporters found appalling its revelations that taxpayers were financing efforts to \"sell\" America on bigger and more expensive weapons systems; critics of the show said the Pentagon was only doing its job and that the show's producers were feeding off the negative view of the military fostered by the anti-Vietnam War movement. Producer Peter Davis went on to direct Hearts and Minds (June 8). Presented by the Veterans History Project, of the Library's American Folklife Center.\n\nThursday, June 2 (7:00pm)\n\nRural America\n\nHallelujah (MGM, 1929). Dir King Vidor. With Daniel L. Haynes, Nina Mae McKinney, William E. Fountaine, Harry Gray, Fannie Belle De Night. (109 min, 35mm)\n\nThe semi-musical Hallelujah, with its all-black cast and Tennessee and Arkansas locations, was an unusual gamble for the generally high-gloss, studio-bound MGM. What lessened the odds was director King Vidor's offer to defer his salary, alongside a brief vogue for all-black \"Southerns\" — on Broadway, Rouben Mamoulian had a hit with Porgy; in Hollywood, Fox had put Hearts in Dixie into production. MGM's reluctance to admit that sound films were here to stay forced Vidor to shoot silent location footage in 1928 of the river baptism and swamp murder, and then painstakingly synchronize dialogue. Around intermeshing themes of religion, sensuality, and family stability, he molded a tale of a cotton sharecropper who begins to lose everything — his year's earning, his brother's life, his freedom — by giving into the temptations of a dancehall girl. The passionate conviction of the melodrama, vibrant Irving Berlin music, and resourceful technical experiments made Hallelujah the first indisputable masterpiece of the sound era.\n\nFriday, June 3 (7:00pm)\n\nRural America\n\nTender Mercies (Antron Media/Universal, 1982). Dir Bruce Beresford. With Robert Duvall, Tess Harper, Ellen Barkin, Betty Buckley. (100 min, 35mm)\n\nRobert Duvall plays a broken, alcoholic country singer redeemed by grace in Tender Mercies, written by Texas bard Horton Foote and capably directed by Aussie Bruce Beresford. The film opens with Duvall literally at the bottom, but his unlikely romance with widow Tess Harper begins his slow rise to redemption. Tender Merciesis one of Foote's more austere works — Duvall's character is a man of precious few words, more comfortable hiding behind a song (all written, incidentally, by Duvall) than expressing himself directly — but his evocation of this dusty patch of east Texas is heartfelt and moving, without even a scintilla of false sentimentality.\n\nTuesday, June 7 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nWho Was That Lady? (Ansark-Sidney/Columbia, 1960). Dir George Sidney. With Tony Curtis, Dean Martin, Janet Leigh, James Whitmore. (115 min, 35mm)\n\nWhen Ann Wilson (Leigh) catches her chemistry professor husband David (Curtis) kissing one of his students, his best friend, former TV writer Michael Haney (Martin), devises a cover-up - David's really an FBI agent, and he was kissing the girl as part of his mission: she's a Russian spy! The fake ID Haney has made at CBS gets the FBI, the CIA and the Russians involved. Ann is only too eager to support her husband's patriotism, gamely hiding under tables to protect him from \"the reds.\" A hilariously outrageous script and a convincing cast (Janet Leigh steals the show as the naive but heroic wife) make this one a must-see!\n\nWednesday, June 8 (7:00pm)\n\nHeart of Darkness: The Vietnam Experience\n\nHearts and Minds (Rainbow Pictures/Warner Bros., 1974). Dir Peter Davis. (108 min, 35mm)\n\nReleased five years after Emile de Antonio's more scabrous In the Year of the Pig, Peter Davis's documentary was hardly less partisan, but with an important difference. Like de Antonio, Davis combined news and historical footage with contemporary interviews, but he made a point of interviewing only subjects who had at some point in their lives had been in favor of the war. So, while we get footage of an imperious Walt Rostow lecturing on the history of the Cold War and William Westmoreland making a devastatingly casual observation about the value Orientals place on life, what hit home for many viewers was watching Vietnam vets Daniel Elsberg, Randy Weaver, and Bobby Muller describe the way their hearts and minds changed about the war and their role in it. Davis stacks the deck with familiar news footage: the summary execution of a Vietcong suspect, a little girl stripped naked by napalm running down a road. But he's also sensitive to the divisions the war drove deep into America, when his camera catches a confrontation between a New York City parade of pro-war demonstrators and a fringe crowd of veterans and their sympathizers protesting the government's not making good on promises for benefits. When some of the pro-war types break ranks and attack the protesters, a bewildered and shaken protester asks, \"I fought in Vietnam-why are these people so angry with me?\" Presented by the Veterans History Project, of the Library's American Folklife Center.\n\nThursday, June 9 (7:00pm)\n\nFeline Flicks: Cartoon Cats\n\nGay Purr-ee (UPA/Warner Bros., 1962).

(7min, 35mm)\n\nWizard of Oz composer Harold Arlen reunites with Judy Garland in Gay Purr-ee, an animated musical about Mewsette, a beautiful French cat who gets into trouble when she trades the quiet countryside for the excitement of Paris. Writer Chuck Jones mixes contemporary animation with impressionism to recreate the setting of early 20th century Paris, a place where a visit to the Mewlon Rouge affords the opportunity for a glimpse of Toulouse-Lautrec and the famous Cat-Cat Dancers. The feature will be preceded by four Chuck Jones shorts starring Marc Anthony and Pussyfoot.\n\nFriday, June 10 (7:00pm)\n\nFeline Flicks: Cartoon Cats\n\nThe Aristocats (Disney, 1970).

His plans to permanently remove his kitty competition are foiled by O'Malley, a friendly alley cat who assists the cats on their journey back to Paris. Along the road, the group is joined by an array of animal characters that sing musical numbers and provide laughs. Three cartoon shorts will precede the feature.\n\nTuesday, June 14 (6:30pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nPorgy and Bess (Goldwyn/Columbia, 1959). Dir Otto Preminger. Music by George Gershwin. Lyrics by Ira Gershwin & DuBose Heyward. With Sidney Poitier, Dorothy Dandridge, Sammy Davis, Jr., Pearl Bailey, Diahann Carroll. (138 min, 35mm)\n\nSamuel Goldwyn's last produced film, this four time Oscar winning adaptation of the Gershwin/Heyward folk opera is finally being shown on the silver screen after decades on the shelf. Hallelujah! to seeing and hearing again Sidney Poitier (Robert McFerrin), Dorothy Dandridge (Adele Addison), Diahann Carroll (Louise Jean Norman), Ruth Attaway (Inez Matthews), along with actors who supplied their own singing: Sammy Davis, Jr., Pearl Bailey, and Brock Peters. The setting is Catfish Row, a black ghetto in Charleston, South Carolina, at the turn of the century. The characters sing their hearts out as they live their lives with feelings of love, searching for dreams and finding hard times, including a friendly dice game which ends with a murder, heroin addiction and distribution, a life threatening hurricane, and white supremacist police. But out of all this turmoil comes a beautiful and magnificent score, with standards like \"Summertime\", \"I Got Plenty O' Nuttin\", \"Bess, You is My Woman Now\" and \"It Ain't Necessarily So.”\n\nThursday, June 16 (7:00pm)\n\nFeline Flicks: Conjuring Cats\n\nBell, Book and Candle (Phoenix/Columbia, 1958). Dir Richard Quine. With James Stewart, Kim Novak, Jack Lemmon, Ernie Kovacs, Elsa Lanchester. (104 min, 35mm)\n\nKrazy Kat. Potions of Love (King Features Syndicate, 1963). Dir Geoff Pike. (6 min, 16mm)\n\nFresh from their success in Vertigo, James Stewart and Kim Novak star in this adaptation of John Van Druten's bewitching stage comedy. This is a playful story of urban witches residing in Greenwich Village, relishing the beatnik atmosphere of the Zodiac Club. That is, all except Gillian (Novak), who is rather bored with the whole scene. Instead, she casts a spell on an unwitting book publisher she's taken a fancy to. Her bongo-playing brother is not keen on the idea, knowing that a witch loses her powers if she falls in love. Much mischief ensues with wacky antics from Hermione Gingold, Jack Lemmon, Elsa Lanchester and Ernie Kovacs. Pyewacket is the mesmerizing Siamese cat whose blue eyes pop out of the screen in lush Technicolor. The sets are full of dreamy 50's modern decor and fabulous outfits, the film was nominated for Academy Awards in Art Direction and Costume Design. Shown with Potions of Love, from a late series of Krazy Kat cartoons based on George Herriman's classic comic strip.\n\nFriday, June 17 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nThe Crimson Pirate (Norma/Warner Bros., 1952). Dir Robert Siodmak. With Burt Lancaster, Nick Cravat, Eva Bartok, Torin Thatcher. (104 min, 35mm)\n\nA sly send-up of the swashbuckler that has been dazzling movie fans for over half a century. This homage to the classic seaworthy action picture explodes onscreen with Fairbanksian vigor and acrobatics. A career high point for superstar Burt Lancaster, who is tanned, toothsome, and completely irresistible in the leading role. The lustrous Technicolor cinematography is by Otto Heller.\n\nTuesday, June 21 (6:30pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nThe Music Man (Warner Bros., 1962). Dir Morton Da Costa. Music & Lyrics by Meredith Willson. With Robert Preston, Shirley Jones, Buddy Hackett, Hermione Gingold, Ronny Howard. (150 min, 35mm)\n\nWarner Bros. mogul Jack Warner knew what he was doing when he chose Morton DaCosta to direct the film version of his hit Broadway production. Frank Sinatra and Cary Grant were among those who refused the leading role, leaving Robert Preston, who played it on Broadway, to take up the part he was born to star in. Meredith Willson (The Unsinkable Molly Brown) wrote the book, music and lyrics of this all-American classic. Where else can you in one evening, see a traincar full of traveling salesmen rapping about their wares and woes; hear the Buffalo Bills, one of the best barbershop quartets in the country; watch an enormous colorful claymation of a military band performing during the film's opening credits; be preached to about the sin of playing pool; watch a crowd of love swooning high school students dancing (choreography by Onna White) and singing in a public library; and learn how to play Beethoven's \"Minuet in G\" on a band instrument of your choice using the \"Think System\" without having a single bit of musical talent? With the Library's widescreen (Technorama), Technicolor print, this musical is not to be missed this summer or any other time.\n\nThursday, June 23 (7:00pm)\n\nFeline Flicks: Extraterrestrial Cats\n\nThe Cat From Outer Space (Disney, 1978).

(7 min, 35mm)\n\nWhen her beloved owner is murdered, a pet cat takes revenge on the rich woman's greedy relatives. British director John Gilling, the man behind Hammer Films cult classics The Plague of the Zombies (1966) and The Mummy's Shroud (1967), brings us this tale of pet turned vigilante. Gilling also penned Trog (1970), Joan Crawford's famous last film. Preceded by two shorts, a National Geographic documentary on - you guessed it - cats, and a Tom & Jerry cartoon classic.\n\nTuesday, June 28 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nThe Pirates of Penzance (Universal, 1983). Dir Wilford Leach. With Kevin Kline, Linda Ronstadt, Rex Smith, Angela Lansbury. A Gilbert & Sullivan operetta based on the Joseph Papp New York Shakespeare Festival Broadway stage productions. (112 min, 35mm)\n\nInstead of hiring operatic performers, American producer Joseph Papp cast contemporary rock/pop singers (Ronstadt, Smith) and young actors (Klein, Azito) in this Gilbert and Sullivan operetta. Papp's colorful and campy Broadway production lends itself well to the widescreen (Panavision). George Rose, as Major-General Stanley (seen at D.C.'s National Theater during the show's traveling tour), does a death defying version of the patter song \"I am the very model of a modern Major-General\" which has to be seen to be believed. Be sure to watch for Smith's imitation of Elvis Presley during one of his arias, and a salute to the Broadway musical A chorus line in the film's final minutes.\n\nThursday, June 30 (7:00pm)\n\nFeline Flicks: Scaredy Cats\n\nEye of the Cat (Universal, 1969).

The current heirs, a menagerie of housecats, have other plans. San Francisco provides a beautiful and scenic backdrop to this seedy story of fear, betrayal, revenge, incest and death. Three shorts, two early silents and a Sylvester cartoon, will precede tonight's feature.\n\nFriday, July 1 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nA Girl Named Tamiko (Hal Wallis/Paramount, 1962). Dir John Sturges. With Laurence Harvey, France Nuyen, Martha Hyer, Gary Merrill. (110 min, 35mm)\n\nLaurence Harvey plays a disillusioned Eurasian hoping to come to America, attracted to two women who represent his hopes for the future and mixed heritage: American embassy official Martha Hyer and high born France Nuyen (in the title role). Filmed in Japan, the role of society, tradition, and modernity is examined in this seldom-seen film.\n\nTuesday, July 5 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nChristmas Holiday (Universal, 1944). Dir Robert Siodmak. With Deanna Durbin, Gene Kelly, Gale Sondergaard, Gladys George. (92 min, 35mm)\n\nAn American film noir with Richard Wagner on the soundtrack, Christmas Holiday is a melodramatic misfire containing enough cinematic flourishes to compensate any film enthusiast. Told mainly in flashbacks (the script is by Herman J. Mankiewicz, who wrote Citizen Kane), the story concerns a \"hostess\" in a \"roadhouse\" who is suffering from guilty feelings imposed upon her by her mother-in-law from hell, a familiar movie device. We go to a movie like this one to enjoy the spectacular camera movement that concludes with Ms. Durbin singing Frank Loesser's \"Spring Will Be a Little Late This Year.\" A thorough explication of this movie can be found in James Harvey's book Movie Love in the Fifties.\n\nThursday, July 7 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nJohn Paul Jones (John Paul Jones Productions/Warner Bros., 1959). Dir John Farrow. With Robert Stack, Marisa Pavan, Erin O’Brien. (128 min, 35mm)\n\nFilmed in Spain in Technicolor, this biopic of the famous naval hero begins with the Revolutionary War and closes with Jones’s death in France in 1792. Produced by historical epic specialist Samuel Bronston (El Cid, The Fall of the Roman Empire), the film features wonderful cameos by Charles Coburn (as Benjamin Franklin), Bette Davis (as Empress Catherine of Russia), and Jean-Pierre Aumont (as King Louis XVI).\n\nFriday, July 8 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nHappy Anniversary (Fields/UA, 1959).

With Dick Van Dyke, Mary Tyler Moore, Rose Marie, Larry Matthews. (25 min, 3/4\" video)\n\nAttorney David Niven has gone to great lengths to protect his family from the dangerous influence of the \"boob tube.\" Niven's efforts, along with his well-ordered life, go out the window when his father in law buys the family a TV console. This hilarious farce was somewhat controversial in its day because of references to \"pre-marital relations.\" Shown with an episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show in which Rob alienates his friends when he wonders which of his party guests stole his new watch.\n\nTuesday, July 12 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray (MGM, 1945). Dir Albert Lewin. With George Sanders, Hurd Hatfield, Donna Reed, Angela Lansbury. (112 min, 16mm)\n\nEerie adaption of Oscar Wilde's novel about a young man who wishes away his soul to retain his youth and beauty. His debauched behavior, nefarious deeds and age become marked upon his portrait instead. Beautifully shot in black and white, it is interspersed with four shocking images of Ivan Albright's lurid painting. Subtle directing leaves the suggested horrors and depravities to work upon the audience's imagination. The exaggerated Victorian mannerisms, costumes and sets are offset by a curious and affecting detachment by the actors. However, Angela Lansbury is very fetching and she sings \"Little Yellow Bird\" ever so sweetly. Dorian Gray earned Two Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Lansbury) and B&W Art Direction, and an Academy Award for Best B&W Cinematography.\n\nThursday, July 14 (6:30pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nAlice Chops the Suey (Winkler, 1925).

(100 min, 16mm)\n\nA succession of films reflecting the changing screen treatment of Asian images over a half-century, beginning with casual Chinatown tomfoolery in a cartoon, a half-hour series television episode guest starring Victor Sen Yung, and a two hour anthology drama on the impact of Asian immigration in the old West on both ethnic traditions and the dominant Anglo culture. In China Girl, Rosalind Chao stars as a woman who is raped aboard her immigrant ship and finds her father determined to kill the resulting child.\n\nFriday, July 15 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nLonesome Cowboys (Warhol/Sherpix, 1968). Dir Andy Warhol. With Joe Dallesandro, Julian Burroughs, Taylor Mead, Viva, Francis Francine. (109 min, 16mm)\n\nImagine for a moment the New York underground circa the late 60's presented as a western shot in Arizona and you start to comprehend this film. The film makes an attempt to deconstruct westerns, mainly Nicholas Ray's Johnny Guitar. Here, a roving gang of cowboys, supposedly brothers, ride into a seemingly deserted town and meet Viva (who is a symbol of both the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene). Viva would like to save their souls through a series of punishments, but they treat her with nothing but contempt. Meanwhile, the law of the town attempts to get the gang to leave but is generally dismissed because they are discovered to be \"corruptible cross-dressers\". Edited by Warhol while he was recuperating from the gunshot wounds inflicted by Valerie Solanas on June 3, 1968, Lonesome Cowboys went on to win Best Film at the San Francisco Film Festival. Because of the filming, Andy Warhol was placed under surveillance by the FBI on February 23, 1968, in response to a complaint by the public. In August, 1969, Cowboys was seized by the authorities during its third week at a cinema in Atlanta, Georgia, and the manager of the cinema was arrested. A rare screening of a rare film.\n\nTuesday, July 19 (6:30pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nLet Us Live (Columbia, 1939). Dir John Brahm.

Coleman, Jr. With Bruce Cabot, Rita Hayworth, Marc Lawrence, Richard Fiske. (59 min, 35mm)\n\nThis seldom shown melodrama is an indictment of the criminal-justice system. Playing a cab driver who is falsely accused of murder, Henry Fonda (1905-1982) adds another doomed member of the proletariat to his portrayals of an ex-con in You Only Live Once (1937) and Tom Joad in The Grapes of Wrath (1940). The stunning cinematography is by Lucien Ballard, best known for his camera work in The Wild Bunch (1969). Shown with Homicide Bureau, an action-filled programmer with the reliable support of Marc Lawrence, a movie menace with one of the longest rap sheets in film history. Bruce Cabot, who reached his pinnacle in King Kong (1933) tries, in vain, to avert his eyes from the miscast movie starlet who later on put the blame on Mame - the peerless Rita.\n\nThursday, July 21 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nRhapsody of the Rails (Fox, 1933).

(68 min, 16mm)\n\nJohn Lane was at the throttle of The Phantom Express when it crashed head-on into a westbound train. He has been distraught ever since. Jack Warren, the substitute engineer on a small railroad, falls in love with Lane's daughter Nora and takes over as engineer on the express. Meanwhile, Tom Hardy, one of Nora's rejected suitors, pursues her and then storms off when she rejects him for Warren. Will this love triangle lead to another tragic wreck? Preserved by the American Film Institute. Shown with Rhapsody of the Rails, an early sound documentary from the Magic Carpet of Movietone series.\n\nFriday, July 22 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nRemember My Name (Lion's Gate/Columbia, 1978). Dir Alan Rudolph. With Geraldine Chaplin, Anthony Perkins, Moses Gunn, Jeff Goldblum. (94 min, 35mm)\n\nTuesday, July 26 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry Charlie\n\nChan Carries On [trailer] (Fox, 1931) With Warner Oland. (3 min, 35mm)\n\nCharlie Chan in Honolulu [trailer] (20th Century-Fox, 19371) With Sidney Toler. (2 min., 35mm)\n\nMr. Moto Takes a Chance [trailer] (20th Century-Fox, 1938) With Peter Lorre. (4 min., 35mm)\n\nJudge Dee in The Monastery Murders (ABC Circle Films, 1974). Dir Jeremy Paul Kagan. With Khigh Dhiegh, Mako, Soon-Teck Oh, Irene Tsu, James Hong, Keye Luke. (97 min, 35mm)\n\nBased on the novel The Haunted Monastery, one of the 16 Judge Dee books by Robert Van Gulick, centering on the investigations of a district magistrate in T'ang Dynasty China. Judge Dee in The Monastery Murders was a TV movie of the week and pilot for an unproduced series. It was adapted for the screen by writer-director Nicholas Meyer as one of his first film projects. As befits the story, the cast is entirely Asian, the first such Hollywood television film. This contrasts with the only other version of the Gulick books, a 1969 British mini-series with English actors playing the roles in \"yellow face.\" To provide historical context, the evening begins with several trailers from the 1930s Hollywood Asian detective series, including the Pickford premier of the Library's restoration of the trailer of Charlie Chan Carries On, the first of the series to star Warner Oland. The trailer is all that survives of this now-lost Chan film, which marked Oland's switch from starring in a series on the villainous Fu Manchu to the sagacious, just Chinese immigrant detective of the Hawaiian police.\n\nTuesday, August 2 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nThe Mask of Dimitrios (Warner Bros., 1944). Dir Jean Negulesco. With Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Zachary Scott, Faye Emerson. (95 min, 35mm)\n\nWhen a corpse is washed ashore in Istanbul and identified as the body of a notorious criminal, a series of dizzying plot twists is set into motion, taking the international set of characters from Turkey to Athens, then Bulgaria, and finally Paris. Another delightful pairing of Greenstreet and Lorre (their fifth after The Maltese Falcon), The Mask of Dimitrios is a first-rate noir thriller based on Eric Ambler's 1939 novel of the same name. The film also marked Zachary Scott's motion picture debut.\n\nThursday, August 4 (7:00pm)\n\nAlain Delon in Hollywood\n\nOnce a Thief (CIPRA/MGM, 1964). Dir Ralph Nelson. With Alain Delon, Ann-Margret, Van Heflin, Jack Palance. (106 min, 35mm)\n\nKnown mostly for his European films, Delon's attempts to achieve Hollywood success go largely overlooked. To commemorate his 70th birthday in 2005, we're giving some of those films a reappraisal. In Once a Thief, Delon portrays an ex-con who tries to go straight, but has a cop bent on revenge trailing him and a brother that wants him to do one more crime job. Upset that his wife, played by Ann-Margaret, has to work in a strip club to support them, Delon thinks another heist may be his only choice.\n\nFriday, August 5 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nEasy Living (Paramount, 1937). Dir Mitchell Leisen. With Jean Arthur, Edward Arnold, Ray Milland, Luis Alberni. (87 min, 35mm)\n\nYoung Ironsides (Roach/MGM, 1932). Dir James Parrott. With Charley Chase, Muriel Evans, Clarence Wilson. (20 min, 35mm)\n\nWith her native intelligence and reserve, Jean Arthur hardly seems to fit the madcap profile required of Hollywood's funny ladies. Yet she was a definitive screwball heroine, as she so triumphantly proves in this elegantly wild comedy scripted by Preston Sturges. Besieged by airborne fur coats, a hostile Automat, and apoplectic New Yorkers, Arthur charms us with her commonsensical aplomb and delivers plenty of belly laughs. Preceding the feature, Charley Chase, titan of the two-reeler, crashes a beauty contest and invents a new kind of beachwear in Young Ironsides.\n\nTuesday, August 9 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nFrench Connection II (20th Century-Fox, 1975). Dir John Frankenheimer. With Gene Hackman, Fernando Rey, Bernard Fresson, Jean Pierre Castaldi. (119 min, 35mm)\n\nThe triumphant return of the gritty and visceral Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman) as he follows his lead into Europe (one may wonder how the NYPD can afford this) to track Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey), the smuggler in the largest heroin bust in American history. Not a critical success when released, it remains a classic of the good cop-bad cop genre. Music by Don Ellis.\n\nThursday, August 11 (7:00pm)\n\nAlain Delon in Hollywood\n\nLost Command (Red Lion/Columbia, 1966). Dir Mark Robson. With Anthony Quinn, Alain Delon, George Segal, Michele Morgan. (126 min., 35mm)\n\nA group of paratroopers in the French army are followed from their capture in Viet Nam to their struggles against guerrillas in Algeria. Anthony Quinn plays a peasant who has worked his way up the military ladder, while Delon plays his cultured assistant who becomes disgusted with the realities of war and torture. This is one of the few Hollywood films to tackle the situation of a colonial power trying to retain its colony against massive insurgency.\n\nFriday, August 12 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nFour Flies on Grey Velvet (Seda/Paramount, 1971). Dir Dario Argento. With Mimsy Farmer, Michael Brandon, Bud Spencer, Jean-Pierre Marielle. (104 min, 35mm)\n\nWhen the flies start to crawl, so will your flesh... By checking the retina of a victim's eye, they can sometimes discover a retained image of the very last thing that the victim saw. In this case, it's an image of... four flies! This is of much worry to hippie drummer Roberto Tobias (Michael Brandon), who is confused as to whether he has accidentally murdered someone. This and a mysterious blackmailer who wears a very creepy doll's facemask and soon becomes homicidal, soon drives Roberto to a near breakdown. His young wife, played by Mimsy Farmer (More), tries to put the pieces together to this mystery. This picture has become the holy grail for fans of Dario Argento (Suspiria) and has never been available on VHS, DVD or 16mm home movie market.\n\nTuesday, August 16 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nBaby Face Nelson (Fryman-ZS/UA, 1957). Dir Don Siegel. With Mickey Rooney, Carolyn Jones, Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Leo Gordon. (85 min, 35mm)\n\nThis superior example of the late 1950s cycle of gangster biopics is also one of director Don Siegel's best studies of psychotic individuals prior to his seminal 1971 film Dirty Harry. The bleak and violent drama is well served by Rooney's terrific portrayal of hoodlum Lester Gillis, who ends up taking over the Dillinger gang after its leader is shot by the police.\n\nThursday, August 18 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nMiddle of the Night (Sudan/Columbia, 1959). Dir Delbert Mann. With Kim Novak, Fredric March, Glenda Farrell, Albert Dekker, Martin Balsam, Lee Grant. (118 min, 35mm)\n\nOriginally this piece was a one-hour 1954 TV drama, also directed by Mann, starring Eva Marie Saint and E. G. Marshall. Following that it was a long running 1956 play with Edward G. Robinson and Gena Rowlands. Middle of the Night was the official 1959 United States entry at the Cannes Film Festival. Great N.Y.C. locations circa 1958.\n\nFriday, August 19 (7:00pm)\n\nAlain Delon in Hollywood\n\nScorpio (Scimitar/UA, 1972). Dir Michael Winner. With Burt Lancaster, Alain Delon, Paul Scofield, Gayle Hunnicutt. (114 min, 35mm)\n\nWhen Scorpio wants you...there is no place to hide! Burt Lancaster plays a CIA agent, Cross, who is targeted for death by his superiors, supposedly for leaking secrets to the Soviets. Delon plays Scorpio, the professional assassin who must kill Cross, but doubts his guilt. The two play a deadly cat-and-mouse game in this Cold War thriller.\n\nTuesday, August 23 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nMe and the Colonel (Court/Goetz/Columbia, 1958). Dir Peter Glenville. With Danny Kaye, Curt Jurgens, Nicole Maurey, Francoise Rosay, Akim Tamiroff. (109 min, 35mm)\n\nIt’s 1940. Two Poles, a Jewish refugee (Kaye) and an anti-Semitic Colonel (Jurgens), must leave Paris as German forces approach. Here begins an unlikely, tragicomic pairing. Adapted from Franz Werfel’s play Jacobowksy and the Colonel.\n\nThursday, August 25 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nThe Ipcress File (Steven/Lowndes/Universal, 1965). Dir Sidney J. Furie. With Michael Caine, Nigel Green, Guy Doleman, Sue Lloyd. (107 min, 35mm)\n\nAs Len Deighton's \"anti-James Bond\" spy Harry Palmer, Michael Caine is the essence of 60's cool. In this first and best of three films, near-sighted agent Palmer is assigned to rescue a kidnapped scientist, and uncovers a murderous double-agent in the process. Made with many of the Bond production team, Ipcress File (along with Alfie) is the Cold War classic that shot Caine to superstardom.\n\nFriday, August 26 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nHellzapoppin' (Mayfair/Universal, 1941). Dir H.C. Potter. With Ole Olsen, Chic Johnson, Martha Raye, Hugh Herbert, Mischa Auer, Shemp Howard. (83 min, 35mm)\n\n\"Any similarity between Hellzapoppin' and a motion picture is purely coincidental.\" (Olsen & Johnson). The great and undeservedly neglected team of Olsen and Johnson come to Hollywood to make a film of their hit Broadway show, “Hellzapoppin',” and all you-know-what breaks loose as the boys feud with the director, writer and even the projectionist to get their brand of comic anarchy on the screen. In the middle of it all, Slim and Slam, joined by Rex Stewart, start a jam and out pops living legend Frankie Manning to lead Whitey's Lindy Hoppers in the greatest swing dance routine ever committed to film.\n\nTuesday, August 30 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nChimes at Midnight = Falstaff (IFE/Alpine/Peppercorn-Wormser, 1966). Dir Orson Welles. With Orson Welles, Jeanne Moreau, Margaret Rutherford, John Gielgud. (115 min, 35mm)\n\nThursday, September 1 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nThe Last Angry Man (Kohlmar/Columbia, 1959). Dir Daniel Mann. With Paul Muni, David Wayne, Betsy Palmer, Luther Adler, Joby Baker. (109 min, 35mm)\n\nDr. Sam Abelman (Muni) is an aging doctor whose life of service inspires his journalist nephew to produce a television documentary about him. A touching drama, and an intriguing look at the film industry’s ambivalence with the new medium of television. The argument is clearly won by James Wong Howe’s b&w photography, a must-see on the big screen. Paul Muni was nominated for Best Actor for his performance as Dr. Sam Abelman.\n\nFriday, September 2 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nCruising (Lorimar/UA, 1980). Dir William Friedkin. With Al Pacino, Joe Spinell, Paul Sorvino, Karen Allen, Powers Booth. (106 min, 35mm)\n\nBurning down theaters and rampant protests occurred when this film was initially shown. Al Pacino stars as a newly permed rookie cop (at 40 years old), Steve Burns. After a serial killer brutally slays and dismembers several gay men in New York's S&M and leather districts, Steve is sent deep undercover onto the streets as decoy for the murderer. Working almost completely isolated from his department, he has to learn and practice the complex rules and signals of this society. He barely sees his girlfriend Nancy, and he starts to question himself and his sexuality.\n\nCurrent Film Schedule: September - December 2005\n\nThursday, September 1 (7:00pm)\n\nNational Film Registry\n\nThe Last Angry Man (Kohlmar/Columbia, 1959).

Dir Wim Wenders. Wrt Ross Thomas, Dennis O�Flaherty, Thomas Pope, based on the novel by Joe Gores. With Frederic Forrest, Peter Boyle, Marilu Henner, Roy Kinnear. (98 min, 35mm)\n\nJoJo in the Stars (Studio AKA, 2003). Dir Marc Craste. (13 min, DVD)\n\nIn Kings of the Road and The American Friend, Wim Wenders, one of the bright lights of the German new wave, expressed his love of American cinema from a respectful distance. The buddy/road movie and film noir became fresh seen through an outsider's eyes. For his first American feature, Wenders tried a more conventional Hollywood narrative, with decidedly mixed results. Based on a novel by Joe Gores, Hammett imagines how detective-turned crime writer Dashiell Hammett (Frederic Forrest) was driven to invent the modern hard-boiled detective story. This ill-fated production bled money for years, forcing Francis Ford Coppola to give up Zoetrope Studios, a production facility that once housed Hollywood General Studios (former workplace of Mary Pickford, Mae West, and Gary Cooper among others), and which was Coppola�s dream of reviv"
