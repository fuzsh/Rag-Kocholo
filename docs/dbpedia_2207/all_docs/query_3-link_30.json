        "text": "1951-1962\n\nZanuck loathes Marilyn Monroe (\"He thought I ?was a freak,\" Monroe once ?said) and nearly tears ?up her first contract ?after her nude Playboy cover comes out. But ?by 1953, Monroe has three of the studio's biggest hits — Niagara, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How ?to Marry a Millionaire — and rene­gotiates a new contract paying $100,000 ?a picture and giving her creative approval. Her first film under the new deal is 1956's Bus Stop, co-starring Don Murray. \"I'd never ?done a feature before,\" says the actor, now 88, \"so I didn't know what to expect. From what others on the ?set told me, Marilyn was ?on her best behavior. She'd ?just been to the Actors Studio, and she really wanted to concentrate on her acting. But even so, she was late every day. She'd get to the studio on time, but then she'd spend hours dawdl­ing in her trailer, getting the nerve up to act. She was trying hard — she would sometimes do 30 takes in ?a scene — but she was very anxious about her acting. She would actually break out in a rash before the ?cameras would start filming. The cameras gave her ?a rash.\"\n\n***\n\nFOX IN THE '50s: \"IT WAS A FAMILY\"\n\nBy: Mitzi Gaynor\n\n\"The theater was going to pay me $250 a week, and Fox was going to pay me $1,000 a week. What would you do? Go with the money! Everybody was scared to death of Mr. Zanuck. I wasn't because I didn't know him – and I thought he was a Hungarian, which I am. It was a family. I love family. I got paid. I went to work. It was fun. One time I was doing three pictures at once – I was the happiest girl in the world! I never said, 'They can't make me!' Make me? 'Gee, I'm gonna be in that one too?!' Everybody was good to me and sweet to me and kind and fun. Listen, I had Betty Grable's makeup man, so what can I tell you?\"\n\n1980\n\n“I remember the day I started at Fox,” Lansing tells THR of her hiring as Hollywood’s first female president of production. “I drove to the gate of the studio, but the guard didn’t recognize me — I guess he hadn’t been reading the trades — and he wouldn’t let me in. I told him I was the new head of the studio, but he didn’t believe me. So I drove through the gate anyway. And then all these police started following after me. Finally, I got to the executive building, and the police were all around me and thank goodness [Fox chairman] Alan Hirschfield was there. He told them not to arrest me. He said, ‘Stop! She’s the head of the studio!’ ” Lansing goes on to oversee production on such films as The Verdict and King of Comedy, among others, before moving on to become Hollywood’s first female studio chief, at Paramount Pictures in 1992."
