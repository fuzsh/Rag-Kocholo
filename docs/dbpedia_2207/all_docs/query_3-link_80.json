        "text": "Background\n\nThe Fox Film Corporation was an independent film production company that was formed on February 1, 1915 by the theater \"chain\" pioneer William Fox by merging two companies he had established in 1913: Greater New York Film Rental, a distribution firm which was part of the independents, and Box Office Attractions Company, a production company. After the Wall Street crash of 1929, Fox lost control of the company in 1930, during a hostile takeover. Under new president Sidney Kent, the new owners merged the company with Twentieth Century Pictures, Inc. to form 20th Century-Fox in 1935.\n\n1st Logo (September 13, 1915-November 28, 1935)\n\nVisuals: The in-credit text of Fox Films. It would just say:\n\nFOX FILM\n\nPRESENTS\n\nIn other cases, it mentioned the name of William Fox:\n\nWILLIAM FOX\n\nPRESENTS\n\nTechnique: A still, printed card.\n\nAudio: None, or the film's opening music.\n\nAvailability: About 75% of Fox Film's pre-1930 feature film output was completely lost in the 1937 Fox vault fire. What is known about its availability is that it can be seen on Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927) and other films of the era, but most just contain a \"Fox Films\" notice in the credits sequences. It occasionally appears on films shown on TCM's Silent Sunday Nights or on Fox Movie Channel (now FXM), but showings on the latter have been scarce to none. The logo premiered on Regeneration (the second logo) and made its final appearance on In Old Kentucky.\n\n2nd Logo (September 13, 1915-September 3, 1922)\n\nVisuals: Over a black background is the word \"COPYRIGHT\" in a slightly curly serif font with two shapes on either side to make it look like a ribbon or banner. Below that is \"WILLIAM FOX\" in the same font but larger letters. Below that is an abstract \"T\" like shape with a diamond and the letters \"WF\" in a diamond shape.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn Regeneration and Monte Cristo, there is a widened, small rectangle-like shape with a ribbon or banner with a diamond and the letters \"WF\" in a diamond shape at the top of the screen. There is the word \"FOX\" above it.\n\nAnother variant exists, where there are four white boxes around the title of the film and a more info. Inside the top white horizontal box is the serif text \"WILLIAM FOX PRESENTS\". Inside the left and right vertical boxes are the ornate plant motifs. Inside the bottom horizontal box is the text \"FOX FILM CORPORATION\". Between the horizontal and vertical boxes are the print logos with drawings of the rocks on each sides respectively.\n\nTechnique: A still, printed card.\n\nAudio: The closing theme of the film.\n\nAudio Variant: Sometimes, the film's opening music is used.\n\nAvailability: About 75% of Fox Film's pre-1930 feature film output was completely lost in the 1937 Fox vault fire. It was seen on Regeneration, East Lynne, A Tale of Two Cities, and Monte Cristo.\n\n3rd Logo (1929-1935)\n\nVisuals: Over a black background, there is a long \"F\" wiping in. Then, \"OX\" appears letter by letter. At this point, the background fades into a black screen. Another long \"F\" wipes in, and \"ILM\" appears letter by letter. A trail appears behind the letters. The entire text is in an Art Deco font.\n\nVariant:\n\nA superimposed still version exists.\n\nThere's also a variant where the logo is in a different font.\n\nA French \"Presents\" version exists. See Fox Film Sté Ame Française for more detail.\n\nAnother \"Presents\" screen is spotted, where \"Presents\" replaced \"Releasing\".\n\nOn some films, the logo appears as an in-credit notice where it is positioned on the top of the title card has \"presents\" below it.\n\nTechnique: Cel animation. Live-action for the \"Presents\" variant.\n\nAudio: None or the closing theme of the film.\n\nAvailability:\n\nIt was seen on their films from the late 1920s to early 1930s.\n\nThe superimposed version can be found on Hoopla.\n\nFox Film Corporation filmography on IMDB"
