        "text": "One of the original leading men, Kirk Douglas came along in the final days of the major studio system, and he was one of the first box office stars to take charge of his own destiny by becoming involved in the production and marketing of the films in which he appeared.\n\nHe was a vital force in such classics as Out of the Past (1947), Champion (1949), Detective Story (1951), Ace in the Hole (1951), The Bad and the Beautiful (1952), and Lust for Life (1956). He formed his own company, Bryna, and made such major films as Paths of Glory (1957), Spartacus (1960), Lonely Are the Brave (1962), and Seven Days in May (1964).\n\nAlong the way, he distinguished himself in a number of westerns, including The Big Sky (1952), Man without a Star (1955), Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957), and The War Wagon (1967), while also tackling several action roles in historical period pictures like 20,000 Leagues under the Sea (1954), Ulysses (1955), and The Vikings (1958).\n\nRenowned for his support of liberal causes, Douglas is often credited with helping break down the dreaded Hollywood anti-Communist “blacklist” by hiring blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo (who also celebrates a birthday today!) to write the screenplay for Spartacus.\n\nIn a conversation with Douglas in conjunction with Draw!, a 1984 HBO TV western, Ronald Miller asked the iconic actor about his work with other leading actors and actresses, antiheroes, and working within the studio system. You can find a full transcript of their conversation in Conversations with Classic Film Stars—a perfect gift for the film buff this holiday season.\n\nIn the excerpt below, Miller and Douglas discuss the unique art of filmmaking, and its pitfalls, as well as Douglas’s involvement in the Oscar-winning, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.\n\nExcerpted from Conversations with Classic Film Stars:\n\nMiller: You’ve worked with every kind of movie director and you don’t have a reputation for getting into disputes with them, but you are known for demanding a collaborative atmosphere on the set. Explain that.\n\nDouglas: I’ve worked with [Joseph] Mankiewicz, [Howard] Hawks, [Elia] Kazan, [William] Wyler, [Billy] Wilder. I’ve been very fortunate. All of them work differently. I’ve even directed a couple of pictures, so I have respect for the work. But no matter what anyone says, it’s a collaborative art form. No matter how much one person is a binding force, it’s still a collaboration.\n\nI think the problem today is that we’ve been contaminated by the European concept of the auteur system. I’ve had movies where I bought the book, developed the script, and cast the whole picture, but then the director walks in and says, “It must be a John Smith film!” I think sometimes we emphasize that too much.\n\nMiller: Though you’ve avoided big hassles with your directors, you’ve had a few disputes with studio managements, haven’t you?\n\nDouglas: Let me give you an example of that: Lonely Are the Brave. You need the proper selling of a picture like that. I thought Universal just threw it away. They didn’t give it a chance. They took it out of circulation. Then there were all those great reviews and people said, “Where’s the picture?” Their ego prevented them from making a different campaign for the picture. The longer I’m in this business, the more amazed I am that a movie can be made, good or bad.\n\nMiller: You’ve taken lots of chances in your career, but I imagine one of your greatest frustrations was not being able to play McMurphy on the big screen in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest after acquiring the rights to the book from Ken Kesey and playing the part on the stage in New York.\n\nDouglas: It was way ahead of its time. When I took it to Broadway, the critics didn’t know what to make of it. The audience loved it, but it didn’t do very well. I tried for nearly twelve years to make it as a movie. I took it to every studio. But they wouldn’t do it, even with a limited budget. Finally, I went into partnership with my son, Michael, and we were able to find somebody outside of the industry to put up the money and we made a little picture that I never predicted would be a hit. So it did over $200 million! Nobody knows what will really be successful.\n\nMiller: What do you think of Michael as a producer?\n\nDouglas: I told him, “Michael, you’re the kind of producer I’d like to work with because you give everything to the other person even when you’re in the movie.” He did that in Romancing the Stone [1984]. He focused all the attention on the girl [Kathleen Turner]. I haven’t been that generous. I’ve been a producer, but I find a product like Spartacus or The Vikings or Seven Days in May or Paths of Glory and somehow there always seems to be a good part for me.\n\nArguably one of the greatest and most memorable of the silent movie child stars, Jackie Coogan (October 26, 1914 – March 1, 1984) had a life that could rival any Hollywood movie. As a child, he was already performing on stage when discovered by Charlie Chaplin at the Orpheum Theater in Los Angeles. Chaplin noticed the kid was a natural born mimic and cast him — at age five — in a small part in A Day’s Pleasure (1919). The boy glowed on camera, so Chaplin put him into his 1921 feature film The Kid and Jackie became an overnight sensation in one of Chaplin’s biggest hits.\n\nCoogan became the first child star to get the full product marketing treatment. Dolls, figurines, whistles, recordings and even a brand of peanut butter bore his image, usually wearing a large cap and a sad-eyed expression. The marketing boom for Shirley Temple a decade later was modeled on the Coogan experience.\n\nHe also revolutionized legal treatment of the earnings of child stars. After Coogan discovered his mother and stepfather had usurped most of his earnings — an estimated $4 million, worth about $50 million in today‘s dollars — the then 24-year-old Coogan successfully sued them. The court case led to passage of the California Child Actors Bill, now commonly known as “the Coogan act,” which requires that a child actor’s employer must set aside 15 percent of his or her earnings in a trust account, and also set standards for work hour limitations and schooling for child actors.\n\nOnce he grew out of the juvenile phase of his career, he enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1941 before the attack on Pearl Harbor. After the war, Coogan resumed his acting career, this time mostly in the new world of television. He appeared in a number of other TV roles, but is best remembered by baby boomers as Uncle Fester, the ghoulishly funny character in ABC’s The Addams Family from 1964-66. He appeared in many small roles in movies, including Elvis Presley’s Girl Happy (1965) and John Wayne’s Cahill, U.S. Marshal (1973). His final screen appearance in a movie was in 1984’s The Prey.\n\nIn honor of the star’s birthday, we’re sharing an excerpt from Ron Miller’s interview from the release Conversations with Classic Film Stars:\n\nSetting the Scene\n\nMy chat with Jackie Coogan took place in April of 1968 while he was playing the role of Boss Finley in a production of Tennessee Williams’ Sweet Bird of Youth in the round at Circle Star Theater in San Carlos, CA. I joined him in his dressing room and we talked between his turns on stage with co-star Shelley Winters. Our time was limited because he was doing his own makeup, which he did quietly and expertly while we talked,.\n\nCoogan was then a little heavy, had a receding hairline and was dressed in a bathrobe over a pair of polka dot shorts. He had a good many furrows and creases, but his face still retained the look of that sad-eyed little boy adopted by Chaplin’s Little Tramp in The Kid. He was warm and friendly and often seemed to speak of the famous movie child as if he had been someone else that he just happened to know.\n\nIn the middle of our chat, Shelley Winters came into his dressing room, heavily made up for her role as a dissipated former movie star, and remarked to me, “So, you’re interviewing him? Well, that’s good. He’s a hell of an actor!”\n\nComing from the two-time Academy Award winning actress, I thought it was a pretty good testament to Coogan’s enduring star quality.\n\nThe Interview\n\nMILLER: The author Irvin S. Cobb once described you as “the blithest spirit that ever gave unending joy to countless millions.” How did it feel to be adored by “countless millions”?\n\nCOOGAN: (Chuckling) Maybe that’s why Lloyds of London insured me for $250,000 whenever I went on a trip. Stars were different then. There was no television, no radio. When a star showed up, the people turned out to see him — by the thousands.\n\nMILLER: When you became a star, movies were silent, so there was no language barrier and people all over the world could see and appreciate what you did on screen. As a little boy, did you realize you were world famous?\n\nCOOGAN: When I was around nine, I was taken on a trip to Europe. It wasn’t like a normal kid’s trip to Europe. I met heads of state. I was “received” by royalty. I exchanged photos with Benito Mussolini. I kissed the Pope’s ring. Everywhere I went, I was mobbed by fans. I can remember being in a car in Paris when the mob nearly killed me. They picked up the whole car with us in it and paraded us down the street on their shoulders.\n\nMILLER: What about back home in America? Could you go out and do things in public that a regular kid could do?\n\nCOOGAN: Once I made the mistake of going shopping with my mother. People recognized me and right away there was a huge group of people all over us. We finally had to be rescued by the police.\n\nMILLER: How did this all begin? How young were you when you made your show business debut?\n\nCOOGAN: My parents were in show business and I made my movie debut at 18 months of age in an unbilled part in a picture called Skinner’s Baby. I was still an infant. My dad (John Henry “Jack” Coogan) was a dancer and I’d gone on stage with him many times.\n\nMILLER: The legend is that you were dancing The Shimmy on stage at the Orpheum in L.A. when Charlie Chaplin, who was in the audience, saw you and thought he detected a special appeal in you. In fact, in his autobiography, Chaplin said your mugging to the audience might have been obnoxious in another child, but that you were “charming and the audience thoroughly enjoyed it.” I guess that was your lucky day because his decision to build The Kid around you made you a star overnight. How do you remember him?\n\nCOOGAN: Chaplin was very nice to me. He would just sit down with me and say what he wanted me to do and I’d do it. If Chaplin didn’t feel right about filming, he just wouldn’t film and I’d go play ball.\n\nMILLER: After The Kid, you did a lot of famous juvenile parts in films like Peck’s Bad Boy and Oliver Twist, but you also did a lot of popular pictures that are forgotten today.\n\nCOOGAN: They made some crazy stuff. When I got my first haircut, it made headlines –and MGM made a movie about it — Johnny Get Your Hair Cut (1927).\n\nMILLER: When the talkies arrived, you were older, but were still appearing in some classic kid stories, like Tom Sawyer (1930) and Huckleberry Finn (1931). Then the roles stopped coming so regularly. How did you feel when you realized you weren’t as “hot” as you’d been as a little boy?\n\nCOOGAN: There was nothing to be sorry about. I had as complete a life as any boy could have had. I was never bitter about it.\n\nMILLER: I know you had a terrible ordeal in 1935 with the auto crash.\n\nCOOGAN: My father, my best friend and two of my dad’s friends were returning from a dove hunt in Mexico when our car was forced over a cliff by another car near San Diego. I was the only survivor.\n\nMILLER: As if that weren’t enough, you then turned 21 and learned that your mother and her new husband had used up almost all the money you had made in the movies.\n\nCOOGAN: They even cut off my $6.25 a week allowance. I sued and finally collected what was left. It gave me a serious distrust of “jurisprudence and politics.”\n\nMILLER: How are things for you today?\n\nCOOGAN: I have four children from my four marriages and a horde of good memories. I’m financially stable and my wife and I live permanently in Palm Springs. I’ve got damned little hair left, but I’ve been letting what’s left of it grow out for this role. I’ve put on some weight, so some people might mistake me for an out of work Sumo wrestler.\n\nMILLER: I think you’re well-regarded as a very good character actor these days.\n\nCOOGAN: I’m probably only known by people old enough to remember The Kid or all those kids who watched The Addams Family. That’s all right. I’m happy doing these character parts. I won’t say I can do anything that comes my way, but I could never quit this business. When I lay off, I get way too jumpy.\n\nAfterword\n\nJackie Coogan was married four times — first to Betty Grable (1937-39) before she became a major star. His fourth marriage — to Dorothea “Dodie” Hanson — was the lasting one, from 1953 until Coogan’s death from a heart attack in 1984. The greatest child star of the silent era is honored with a star on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame on Vine Street near Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nHollywood’s “Golden Age” was never a very hospitable time for Asian American actors, who were seldom called upon to play the lead in any movie—not even those featuring Asian characters.\n\nBut Keye Luke, born on June 18, 1904 in China, came to America as a child and went on to have a long run of success in film and TV. Best known as detective Charlie Chan’s “No. 1 son” in the popular Chan series of the 1930s, Luke also had a running role as the assistant to Dr. Gillespie (Lionel Barrymore) in the follow-up to the Dr. Kildare series of movies at MGM. Then, in the TV series Kung Fu (1972-75), Luke was the memorable Master Po, mentor to David Carradine’s Kwai Chong Caine.\n\nTo celebrate Luke’s long, influential career, we’re sharing excerpts from his interviews with James Bawden and Ron Miller from their recent release Conversations with Classic Film Stars:\n\nThe Interview\n\nBAWDEN: How did you get to Hollywood?\n\nLUKE: I was born in 1904 in Guangzhou, China, near Canton and my dad owned an art shop. Growing up I was always painting away, but we moved to Seattle when I was very young. I started out as a local Seattle artist, specializing in murals. I helped on some of the original murals in Grauman’s Chinese theater, working on faux Chinese murals. And I had a gig drawing the art for the King Kong press book in 1933.\n\nMILLER: While you were working in the publicity department at RKO in the early 1930s, I understand you almost had a chance to play a romantic lead in a big new musical. True or false?\n\nLUKE: True. The producers of Flying Down to Rio (1933) wanted to follow it up with a new musical teaming Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers to be set in Shanghai. Anna May Wong was set as the second female lead, but they couldn’t find a Chinese leading man for her. Then they remembered this guy who was working in the publicity department: Me. They called me to their office and told me I would be co-starring with Anna May Wong. It was like a bolt out of the blue. I was planning to go to New York to study at the Art Students League, then go to Paris and complete my art education. I knew nothing about being an actor.\n\nMILLER: So what happened?\n\nLUKE: The film was cancelled when the producer was fired. But I was given a consolation prize: I made my “acting” debut in a Leon Errol comedy short subject. I played his Japanese gardener in a scene where I mowed his rug with a lawn mower. I considered it a silly whim and returned to my art work without any regrets.\n\nMILLER: Why did you move from RKO to MGM right after that?\n\nLUKE: Frank Whitbeck, my former boss at Fox, had moved to MGM as advertising director and he asked me to come in for a job interview. That’s when I learned MGM wasn’t interested in my portfolio. They had heard about my near miss at RKO and asked me to test for a role at MGM. Fortunately, it turned out all right. I got the part — and I started right out at the top.\n\nBAWDEN: So you wound up making your feature film debut in The Painted Veil with the legendary Greta Garbo in 1934.\n\nLUKE: I had the small part of Shay Key Fong (a young Chinese doctor who assisted Herbert Marshall, playing a doctor battling a cholera epidemic.) But I didn’t get billing.\n\nMILLER: Was your test so good that you beat out the real professional actors who were trying for the part?\n\nLUKE: There were very few Chinese actors in Hollywood in those days, so I was practically a pioneer. I don’t think I had any competition for the part.\n\nBAWDEN: What was Garbo like?\n\nLUKE: As if I really met her! She was a true beauty from the neck up. But her body was stocky, her feet long. We rehearsed our dialogue scene (together). She was very kind to me and just moved on. The camera was her best friend. In close ups, she was exquisite. George Brent (one of the two male leads) was after her from the beginning.\n\nBAWDEN: Describe L.A. in 1934.\n\nLUKE: I never went into the big department stores. L.A. was segregated, but not formally. One never saw blacks on Wilshire Boulevard. Parts of the city I avoided–all white areas like Beverly Hills. Even after working with somebody like a big Caucasian actor, I’d be ignored if we met on the street. Asians were invisible, you see. We knew our place: One step back. That’s why the Charlie Chan films were so important. They deflated a lot of the current racial myths. But even the Chan films had rules. Charlie never touched a white woman except as a handshake. I’d never have a white girl friend, not that I wanted one in pictures. Whenever a young, personable “Chinaman” was needed, I’d get the job. But in films like The Casino Murder Case (1935), Oil For the Lamps of China (1935), King of Burlesque (1935), I’m very much in the background and often not listed in credits.\n\nBAWDEN: How did you get into the Charlie Chan movies?\n\nLUKE: The Fox casting director saw my work in The Painted Veil and was looking for a non-threatening Asian actor. At first they wanted to hire a Caucasian, but nobody knew how to act the part, which was of a callow teenager trying to learn the detective business from his dad. I did a test with Warner Oland (who had acted with Luke in The Painted Veil) and he said “hire the kid” and I eventually did a slew of them. In 1935, I did Charlie Chan in Paris and Charlie Chan in Shanghai. In 1936 I was in Charlie Chan At The Circus, Charlie Chan At the Race Track and Charlie Chan at The Opera. which I think the best one of them all. In 1937, I did Charlie Chan at The Olympics, Charlie Chan On Broadway and Charlie Chan at Monte Carlo.\n\n[. . .]\n\nBAWDEN: You also played Kato in two Green Hornet serials?\n\nLUKE: I was the chauffeur and they asked me to adopt a Filipino accent, which I obliged, but it was awful. The (first) serial was made super quickly and Universal decided on a second, which was equally popular. But they only had rights to these two stories. Gordon Jones had the lead, a nice guy who wound up in Abbott and Costello stuff.\n\nBAWDEN: In 1940’s Phantom Of Chinatown, you were the first Asian actor to play an Asian detective in a Hollywood film.\n\nLUKE: Boris Karloff’s career really took off and he didn’t want to do any more Monogram Wongs. So they called me in, not as a replacement, but as a bustling new character, Jimmy Lee Wong, a generation younger than Boris’s character. Grant Withers was still the detective and he was mad as a hornet that they didn’t make his character the new lead. The girl was the wonderfully named Lotus Long, who acted under several names. She played Tokyo Rose in that Bogey movie (Tokyo Joe) and suffered from that. She was part Hawaiian and Chinese. The story we had was written by George Waggner, who later directed the first Wolf Man film, but the production values were lower than low and the series was discontinued.\n\n[. . .]\n\nMILLER: Correct me if I’m wrong, but I seem to remember you and some other Chinese-American actors playing Japanese characters during World War II.\n\nLUKE: That’s true. The best for me was the part of a Japanese spy in Across the Pacific with Humphrey Bogart. Of course, he found me out, we had a fight and he threw me overboard!\n\nBAWDEN: But after the war, I guess parts were scarce and you did what you had to do to survive.\n\nLUKE: That meant TV. I was in multiple episodes of Terry and the Pirates (1953) and The New Adventures of China Smith (1953), not as a regular, but different characters. I even played a Japanese in South Sea Woman (1953)—had to, needed that paycheck, which was $100. I’m uncredited. I was uncredited in Love Is A Many Splendored Thing (1955). The Chinese acting community in L.A. was still tiny. I’m also unbilled in Around the World in 80 Days (1956). I’m an older man at the Yokohama Travel Office. I was a waiter on December Bride (1954) and a professor on Meet Mr. McNutley (1954). Gale Storm remembered me from a day job on My Little Margie and got me on The Gale Storm Show (1957) several times. I was on several times as a suspect on Perry Mason and several times as the same character on Kentucky Jones (1964). With a little help from my friends, I kept going.\n\n[. . .]\n\nBAWDEN: You finally hit Broadway with Flower Drum Song. which you played for almost two years in New York and two years on the road.\n\nLUKE: I remember being in Toronto in the road show of that one. Oscar Hammerstein, who was very nice, auditioned and picked me. Dick Rodgers was not quite so nice. I didn’t get the role in the movie. [Producer] Ross Hunter picked Benson Fong! In a way I felt relieved. There was now a growing community of Chinese actors. We started competing with each other. Previously Philip Ahn and I had divided up the work.\n\nBAWDEN: How do you do it? You’re in Anna and the King and also doing two other series: Kung Fu and the cartoon series The Amazing Chan and the Chan-Klan.\n\nLUKE: Well, I finally got to play Charlie, so how could I turn that down? I’m only voicing the cartoon, so I do that on weekends. Then I split my time between Anna and Kung Fu. I don’t have big parts. On Anna, I’m Siamese, but what the heck! It’s a good paying job. My only concern is we have no music rights so Yul Brynner will not burst into song. The first day he bellowed, “That’s not my throne!” And he was right. They sold his golden throne during the great movie auction. They really had to rummage and they discovered Rex Harrison’s throne from the 1946 movie and Yul has to do with that.\n\nOn Kung Fu, I’m in scenes with David Carradine. Knew his dad (John Carradine) at Fox. I think the son eccentric, but has great possibilities as an actor. So I think I’ll continue a little longer at the game.\n\nMILLER: (Years later) You’ve had some juicy roles lately, like the old shopkeeper who sells\n\nthe “mogwai” in Joe Dante’s Gremlins (1984) and a Chinese crime boss on TV’s Miami Vice. And I’m happy to discover you still have one of the most imposing voices in Hollywood. How do you maintain that quality?\n\nLUKE: I practice opera to keep my voice in shape—and I’m currently memorizing all the great Shakespearean roles as a mental exercise.\n\nMILLER: You have such a rich history in Hollywood, do you often look back on those years as almost a fantasy life?\n\nLUKE: I don’t live in the past, but I glory in the past. I think it’s beautiful and the memories are golden and fragrant. But I’m more interested in life today. I find it’s still miraculous and full of wonders.\n\nAfterword\n\nKeye Luke continued to work busily in both television and films until the end of his life. Among the TV shows: Quincy, Hunter, Vega$, How the West Was Won and such flicks as Won Ton Ton, Just You and Me, Kid and his final, Woody Allen’s Alice (1990). He died January 12, 1991, aged eighty-six, at his daughter’s home in Whittier, CA.\n\nIf you’re looking for more astounding behind-the-scenes stories from the greatest stars of Hollywood’s Golden Age, look no further than Conversations with Classic Film Stars by James Bawden and Ron Miller.\n\nJune 4 marks the birthday of one of golden age Hollywood’s most recognizable leading ladies, Rosalind Russell. To celebrate, we’re sharing an excerpt from James Bawden’s interview with him from our recent release Conversations with Classic Film Stars. Here, the acclaimed actress shares fascinating stories from her long career:\n\nSetting the Scene\n\nTall, sophisticated Rosalind Russell started out in movies as a serious dramatic actress, but her gift for wisecracking comic characters soon flowered, and she is today best remembered for those roles in His Girl Friday (1940), the original My Sister Eileen (1942), Auntie Mame (1958), and the musical Gypsy (1962). Oscar nominated for dramatic roles in Sister Kenny and Mourning Becomes Electra in the 1940s, she won the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award at the 1972 Oscar ceremony for her charity work.\n\nThe Interview\n\nBAWDEN: What was your upbringing like?\n\nRUSSELL: I had a mother and father who cared. I was the middle child in a big batch of seven children. I don’t think Mother wanted me to be a stay-at-home mom as she had so proudly been. My father was an affluent lawyer, but his will made news and is still listed in the law books. He wanted his children to take care of themselves, but he’d support us in any educational endeavor as long as we wanted. Then, for at least three years—nothing! We had to try to make it in the world on our own abilities. I thought I’d try acting. It had always intrigued me, which meant a lot of studying at first because that’s exactly the way Dad would have wanted it.\n\n[ . . . ]\n\nBAWDEN: How did you snag the choice role of Sylvia in The Women [1939]?\n\nRUSSELL: Well, nobody else wanted it. She was a real gargoyle. I barged into [director] George Cukor’s office and he said, “Roz, you are a lady!” He wanted his Broadway buddy Ilka Chase, who had done the original play. I auditioned and tested for producer Hunt Stromberg, who figured he could save money by casting an MGM contractee. Hunt produced Night Must Fall. He knew me inside out. At first I tried to inject some malice, but George said to go for the broadest comedy. I dressed Sylvia horridly for show with more than a little help from [chief fashion designer] Adrien. We first glimpse her at Mary’s house, and I wore an awful blouse with a great big bulging Picasso-like face staring back. Norma [Shearer] took one look and protested to George, “She’s not going to wear that, is she?” In my mind Sylvia was ungainly. In the department store confrontation, I fall back into a garbage bin. I also had a wonderful wrestling match with Paulette Goddard that we rehearsed a whole day. Her character stole my husband. I really got going and at the end I grab her leg and bite it. Paulette wisecracked that she was going to get hydrophobia and the line stayed in.\n\nThere was some backstage tension with Norma. She was also brawling with Joan Crawford. I was told I’d get under-the-title billing, so when enough of my part was in the can, I started phoning in sick. MGM’s Benny Thau knew exactly what I was doing and eventually phoned and said I’d get star billing under Shearer and Crawford, but in smaller letters.\n\nBAWDEN: You immediately jumped into His Girl Friday, the remake of The Front Page.\n\nRUSSELL: The Women premiered in September 1939 to huge crowds. I naturally expected MGM would now be buying properties specifically for me. Nothing happened. They did not even try promoting me for an Oscar nomination. The next month Harry Cohn, who’d seen The Women, arranged a loan-out for His Girl Friday. [Director] Howard Hawks had gone through [Irene] Dunne, [Ginger] Rogers, [Jean] Arthur—all of whom had turned down [the role of] Hildy. I went over to see him and my hair was still wet from the shower. That’s how much effort I put into that audition. Howard told me he had this idea of changing Hildy’s sex at a party and read the play with a script girl. The Front Page, he said, was, after all, a great love story. I left his office all enthusiastic and it remains one of my favorite parts.\n\nThere are all these wonderful character actors: Porter Hall, Ernest Truex, Gene Lockhart, John Qualen. They’d try stealing scenes like crazy. Don’t forget Cary Grant, who is a smash. He just enjoyed himself so much. Howard very correctly resisted attempts to open it up, and it plays like a photographed stage play. It’s true I hired a gag writer to give me some lines because Cary was ad-libbing like crazy. Most of it was so good Howard let him keep the lines in.\n\n[ . . . ]\n\nBAWDEN: You decided to change the course of your career.\n\nRUSSELL: With Sister Kenny [1946], I took a story most studios had turned down as too depressing. I had to practically break down the door of RKO head Charlie Koerner to get it done. It took two years to get the script right and only after scriptwriter Dudley Nichols came on board. He turned our characters back into real people and got so hooked he said he had to direct it. We all knew it wasn’t going to be a huge box office hit but it was my most challenging part. It did make a moderate profit and Charlie still talked to me.\n\nBAWDEN: Then came Mourning Becomes Electra [1947].\n\nRUSSELL: I was stunned when Dudley offered it to me. I thought I could get by as the mother, but he said, “Oh, no. You must play the daughter, Lavinia.” Couldn’t understand her or that family. We filmed and filmed and after the third time when the carriages come up to the door, I asked Dudley if that were necessary. He snapped, “How else are people going to get to the front door?” I started hating it, although I did as told. Katina Paxinou as Christine seemed to be braying all the time. Michael Redgrave was always in a snit. Ray Massey really got it right. I think I was just awful.\n\nI was very surprised to get an Oscar nomination. [On] Oscar night the idea that I was standing up before Loretta Young’s name was called is ridiculous. In fact my mother was sick and I was trying to get her home. That accomplished, I turned around and went to Loretta’s victory party to congratulate her.\n\n[ . . . ]\n\nBAWDEN: In 1955 came Picnic.\n\nRUSSELL: I was floored when [the playwright] Bill Inge phoned me up and said, “Roz, you must be Rosemary.” I’d seen and loved the play but I was concerned she might be relegated to secondary status. Both Bill and Harry Cohn assured me there were five main characters and all would have equal treatment. But on location in Kansas it was evident director Josh Logan was giving Kim Novak special privileges. Hers was a dazzling beauty, but she couldn’t act a bit. That kind of attention tipped the balance and then Harry suggested I take a secondary [Supporting Actor] nomination. He had just cut my big scene and I was in no mood for compromises. I refused because it would have been unfair to Rosemary.\n\nBAWDEN: There was nothing secondary about your part in Auntie Mame!\n\nRUSSELL: She just flew into everybody’s hearts. It was the Eisenhower fifties. People were desperately looking for color in their lives. She was this beautiful dame overstuffed with emotions. And yes, Morton Da Costa and I did a bit of rewriting of the script. You see, it was necessary to get Mame off the stage for a large chunk of act 2 or audiences would have become exhausted with her.\n\nI grew so fond of little Jan Handzlik, who played my nephew. When his mother was in the hospital I went to see her with him and I ordered Warners to hire him for the movie although he was growing up fast. Then he moved to Seattle and I lost touch with my dear little boy.\n\nFor the movie I worked on getting Mame’s dimensions lowered for film. I didn’t want to wind up stagy and overbearing. But I now see I should have done even more. I really like the play better than the movie. Jack Warner immediately asked me to do a sequel titled Around the World with Auntie Mame. I refused. Bad decision. I think I should have done it, but I didn’t want to repeat myself in any way.\n\nAfterword\n\nRussell battled cancer before succumbing on November 28, 1976. She was seventy-one. Her legacy as a much-respected actress seems secure, especially after Premiere magazine\n\nnamed her Hildy Johnson one of the top one hundred movie portrayals of the twentieth century.\n\nIf you’re looking for more astounding behind-the-scenes stories from the greatest stars of Hollywood’s Golden Age, look no further than Conversations with Classic Film Stars by James Bawden and Ron Miller.\n\nBob Hope, one of Hollywood’s greatest and most beloved entertainers, could do it all—sing, act and dance—but what he loved most was comedy, and he went on to make an entire nation laugh for generations.\n\nOne of his greatest fans was author Ron Miller who, during his 22 years as a TV columnist, had many opportunities to chat with the star of stage and screen. In our recent release, Conversations with Classic Film Stars: Interviews from Hollywood’s Golden Era, Miller includes an illuminating compilation of his various talks with the acclaimed entertainer.\n\nTo commemorate what would have been Bob Hope’s 113th birthday, we’re sharing an excerpt from his interview:\n\nSetting the Scene\n\nBorn Leslie Townes Hope on May 29, 1903, Bob Hope immigrated to the U.S. from London as a child. He began his show business career in vaudeville which helped develop his skills as a joke teller and master of ceremonies. He appeared on Broadway and in movie shorts as a comic actor. In 1938 he became the star of his own radio show, The Pepsodent Show, and the rapid delivery of his comic lines garnered popularity and made him an overnight sensation. That same year he was signed to Paramount Pictures and made his feature film debut in The Big Broadcast of 1938 with W.C. Fields.\n\nHe went on to star in a number of films, most notably The Road to Singapore (1940) with Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour, which launched a series of “road” movies. He hosted the Academy Awards ceremonies 18 times, and became one of the most popular USO entertainers with a number of overseas tours to combat zones during WWII and the Korean and Vietnam Wars.\n\nThe Interview\n\nMILLER: You’re such an iconic symbol of America around the world that it’s often hard to believe you came here as an immigrant from England. Tell me about it.\n\nHOPE: My uncle, Frank Hope, came over first. Then we all got on the boat–in steerage–and took off. I was four years old. They wanted to vaccinate me at Ellis Island, but I wouldn’t let them. I ran all over the place. I think I was a little mischievous.\n\nMILLER: Your dad was a stonemason. Was he a good one?\n\nHOPE: There’s a bridge in Cleveland with a sign saying “Built by Harry Hope.” It connects the east side with the west side. It’s still standing, so I guess he was good enough.\n\nMILLER: I’ve read a good deal about how tough it was at first for you becoming a success in show business. What was the turning point for you?\n\nHOPE: I always go back to 1928 when I was standing in front of the Woods Theater building in Chicago. I couldn’t book a date. I was getting $10 a show in those days and stood there looking over at Henrisi’s Restaurant, which had an open window. I could see them eating in there and I’m starving. And I was thinking, “I’ve got to go back to Cleveland, get my laundry done and get a fresh start.” That’s when a guy I knew, Charlie Cooley, says, “Hey, what’re you doing?”\n\nHe took me upstairs to a booker who got me one day at the West Inglewood Theater for $25, which was more money than I’d ever made. From that booking, I got a booking at the Stratford, where they were using a permanent M.C. for shows and pictures. I stayed there six months. When I came out of there, I could do anything.\n\n[. . .]\n\nMILLER: Your biggest break up to then came when you were signed to play one of the leading roles in the Broadway show Roberta by Jerome Kern. I imagine you were doing pretty well with the ladies by that time, too.\n\nHOPE: I felt like I had every girl in New York. I was running around with every girl in the chorus, all these beautiful dames. But one night, my pal George Murphy, talked me into catching the act of what he called “a real good-looking singer” over at the Vogue Club. Her name was Dolores Reade. It was love at first sight. I just kept going back again and again to see her act.\n\nMILLER: So you started going out?\n\nHOPE: Pretty soon I was just sitting in the car with her in front of her hotel and talking. That was fatal. One night she finally had time off and attended a performance of Roberta. I was shocked to see her walk right by my dressing room after the show, completely ignoring me. She wouldn’t even stop and talk to me.\n\nMILLER: What was that about?\n\nHOPE: She was so embarrassed because she didn’t know I was one of the stars of the show. She thought I was just a chorus boy.\n\nMILLER: I guess she got over it.\n\nHOPE: Well, we were married soon afterward.\n\nMILLER: Between 1934 and 1938, you made eight movie short subjects, but things didn’t really boom for you until you were signed by Paramount. Your first feature was The Big Broadcast of 1938 and it gave you your signature song, Thanks For the Memory, which won the Best Song Oscar. Tell me about that.\n\nHOPE: The whole thing was an accident. Paramount wanted Jack Benny for the part in the movie, but he was 43 and thought he was too old to play the juvenile lead in a picture. And I don’t think he wanted to be second-billed to W.C. Fields. So, he turned down the part and Paramount had to find somebody else.\n\nI was then working on Broadway in The Ziegfeld Follies. In that show, I introduced the song I Can’t Get Started. Everybody thinks it was Bunny Berrigan’s song because he cut the record. But I introduced it, singing it to a beautiful redhead who turned out to be Eve Arden. Anyway, the movie director Mitch Leisen saw me in the show and was impressed that I could sing as well as do light comedy.\n\nMILLER: Are you telling me Jack Benny might have wound up singing Thanks For the Memory instead of you?\n\nHOPE: I don’t think they intended him to sing anything because Jack didn’t sing much. I think Leisen probably decided to add the song for the two juvenile leads to sing once they signed Shirley Ross and me.\n\nMILLER: When did you learn you were going to sing it?\n\nHOPE: When I arrived at Paramount on September 7, 1937, I went over to the music department and they asked if I wanted to hear the new song I was going to sing. I said, “Sure,” and they played me Thanks for the Memory. I loved it right away, but I took it home and played it for Dolores and she said, “I don’t think that’s much!” I think she was a little hasty.\n\nMILLER: When the song won the Oscar, it went to the composers, Ralph Rainger and Leo Robin, but it became your theme song. How did that come about?\n\nHOPE: I began my radio show for Pepsodent (toothpaste) in September of 1938 and I needed a theme song. It hadn’t won the Oscar yet, but it was the automatic choice for me.\n\nMILLER: You’ve told me before that you’ve sung it on every radio show since, every TV show, in just about every live performance and even in another movie (Thanks for the Memory, 1938). But you’ve almost always changed the lyrics to suit the times. How did the composers react to that?\n\nHOPE: They loved it. After all, they got royalties every time it was played — and still do.\n\n[. . .]\n\nMILLER: One of the primary reasons why you’re so widely loved today must be the tremendous time you put in entertaining the troops. But you did take some flak for doing it during the really unpopular war in Vietnam and defending our being there.\n\nHOPE: If I hadn’t gone over there, I’d have felt pretty awful. Those kids needed shows more than anyone else because they were just sitting around wondering what the hell was going on. It was a miserable, miserable situation. There was nothing different about Vietnam when it came to entertaining troops. I was doing the same thing there I was doing in other places. I wasn’t running for office or anything.\n\nMILLER: Lots of people thought the Academy Awards would have to shut down once you stopped hosting the ceremony. Do you miss that job?\n\nHOPE: No, not really. I did it for so long.\n\n[. . .]\n\nMILLER: Of all the pictures you’ve made, which is your favorite?\n\nHOPE: If The Paleface is on, I’ll take a look at it. And I really like The Seven Little Foys.\n\n[. . .]\n\nMILLER: At this stage of your life, it must be very rewarding to feel the genuine love the public has for you.\n\nHOPE: I sure do appreciate that. I feel that from people I meet. I imagine it comes from the things we did like entertaining the troops all those years. Most people had relatives or knew someone who was over there. I’ve had some wonderful things happen that make me feel good about my life. Like the time when I had this bad eye problem and it looked as if I might have to lose an eye. And this young Marine said, “I’ll give him one of my eyes.”\n\nMILLER: If you had it to do all over again, would you do anything differently?\n\nHOPE: No. I couldn’t be that lucky all over again.\n\nAfterwo rd\n\nBob Hope had a lot of projects on the burner in his final years, including a final “Road” movie with Bing Crosby which was canceled once Crosby died. His final starring role in a feature film was in 1972’s Cancel My Reservation, but he did star in a final made-for-TV movie, 1986’s A Masterpiece of Murder, playing an over-the-hill private eye. Hope had wanted to live to be one hundred — and he did. He died in his sleep at his home in Toluca Lake on July 27, 2003. He was one hundred years old.\n\nMay 15 marks the birthday of one of golden age Hollywood’s most versatile and beloved leading men, Joseph Cotten. To celebrate, we’re sharing an excerpt from James Bawden’s interview with him from our recent release Conversations with Classic Film Stars. Here, the acclaimed actor shares fascinating stories from his long career:\n\nSetting the Scene\n\nJoseph Cotten made a very auspicious screen debut in 1941 in the film most often acclaimed as the greatest-ever American movie: Orson Welles’s Citizen Kane. The talented stage and radio actor went on to become a leading man in scores of important films, including a number of renowned classics, among them Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Gaslight (1944), Since You Went Away (1944), Duel in the Sun (1946), The Farmer’s Daughter (1947), and The Third Man (1949).\n\nThe Interview\n\nBAWDEN: Did you always think of a life in movies?\n\nCOTTEN: Never! My parents were well-to-do southerners. I grew up in Petersburg, Virginia. I was born there in 1905, the oldest of three brothers. But I always wanted to act—of course, onstage and not in the flickers. I studied acting at the School of Expression in Washington, but no offers came. So I moved to Miami and was the freelance drama critic for the Washington Herald from 1926 to 1928. I had other side jobs to keep me going while I acted in amateur stock. By 1930, I’d made my Broadway debut, but right then the Depression killed off Broadway as a viable option, so I tried to get as many radio gigs as possible. I’d married in 1931 and I felt any experience was all right.\n\nBAWDEN: Don’t you think it strange you made your movie debut in probably the best American movie of all time . . . Citizen Kane [1941]?\n\nCOTTEN: But I didn’t. It was my second movie.\n\nBAWDEN: So what was your first then?\n\nCOTTEN: The Philadelphia Story. I can see your eyebrows lifting. I’m not in the MGM movie that was released. But I’m in the first one MGM made. Let me explain. Metro bought the rights [to the play] from Katharine Hepburn and decided to film it several times right through and edit that into a movie version. So they rented out our Broadway theater for two performances, had an invited audience, and the cameras rolled. That way they could get an understanding of how the story flowed. And it made for a better final movie with Hepburn, [Cary] Grant, and [James] Stewart because much of the dialogue was cut down by Don Stewart and he also completely eliminated the role of Tracy’s brother. I was C. K. Dexter Haven, replaced by a guy named Cary Grant. And Van Heflin was the reporter replaced by Jimmy Stewart. The photographer, Liz Imbrie, was Shirley Booth, replaced by Ruth Hussey. MGM told me my version is still somewhere in the vaults, but legally cannot be shown.\n\nBAWDEN: How did you meet Orson Welles?\n\nCOTTEN: It was about time. I was “only” thirty-five! I’d originally met Orson Welles in the mid-thirties when CBS had a producer on Madison Avenue, Knowles Entrekin, and I was in his office with Orson, and Orson dumped his pipe into the wastepaper basket and set it on fire. Now that’s one way of getting known. He was a boy of twenty-one or twenty-two. I had started going to auditions for radio shows in New York and met him while he was also auditioning. Days later we were rehearsing a play for School of the Air and the line “barrels and barrels of pith” caused me, Orson, and fellow actor Ray Collins to continually double up in laughter, And Knowles became very red-faced with anger and almost, but not quite, fired us.\n\nBut when Orson founded the Mercury Theater in 1937, he asked for me to come on board. His first production was a modern-dress version of Julius Caesar, mounted for $5,000. I’d been in such flops as Jezebel with Miriam Hopkins and The Postman Always Rings Twice with Dick Barthelmess Orson saw me in both, told me I’d never be a good actor, but with my curly hair I’d have to get by as a star.\n\nBAWDEN: Did you get to play in Citizen Kane through your connection with Welles then?\n\nCOTTEN: No, I was brought out to Hollywood by my agent, Leland Hayward, and trotted around to the studios, all of whom turned me down. I was at RKO, so I dropped in to say hi to Orson and he hired me on the spot as Jededia Leland. The name was a combination of Jed Harris and Leland Hayward. Ray Collins, Everett Sloane, Paul Stewart, and George Coulouris had already been set. The script was still being written by Orson and Herman Mankiewicz out at the Mankiewicz home. Orson said he’d already wasted six months on a script for Heart of Darkness that RKO turned down.\n\nBAWDEN: But when did shooting begin?\n\nCOTTEN: In August 1940. I just hung around for weeks, not even getting paid, listening to the fantastic stories Orson and Herman were dreaming up. I was in a wheelchair in my first scene as an old man. I hadn’t seen a finished script until one was presented to me at 7 p.m. I was told to report to make up at 4 a.m. for a rubber mask to be applied. I’d already had an assortment of wigs made for me. At 9 a.m., the buzzers sounded and Orson was in a wheelchair, too, after spraining an ankle at tennis. We went out to a sanitarium; I’m an old senile coot reminiscing about the glory days. Citizen Kane had begun! Gregg Toland [the cinematographer] said to start the cameras and that was that.\n\nBAWDEN: Did anybody know they were doing a film that would be hailed as the best ever made in America?\n\nCOTTEN: Nope. Certainly not me. That first day we shot until 6:30 the next morning. Then it was all junked because my wig wasn’t right. Orson would say, “This is what I want to achieve here,” and Gregg would nod and go off and make magic or Herman would trot to a corner to cook up a rewrite. It cost well under $1 million, less than budget. Completely on time. What Orson hadn’t reckoned on was the enormous power of the Hearst press, which refused all ads for the picture. [The film’s main character is a thinly disguised portrait of newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst.] So people across the country did not know it was ever on.\n\nRKO told me it would open at the Radio City Music Hall. It didn’t. Hearst phoned the Rockefellers, who owned the theater, and the offer was withdrawn. For years after, any movie I was in, the Hearst papers would “forget” to mention me in the reviews. We got nine nominations, but on Oscar night the audience booed mere mention of the title. It got one award—for best original screenplay. Citizen Kane ended up losing money for RKO. It broke Orson’s spirit. But in an odd way it made me, and I just kept on going even when Orson couldn’t take it anymore.\n\n[ . . . ]\n\nBAWDEN: And what do you think of Since You Went Away?\n\nCOTTEN: A Herculean achievement. After Gone with the Wind, David [O. Selznick] could never make just a good little movie. It had to be gargantuan. I’d been warned about Claudette Colbert—how she wanted all the sets to be constructed to show off her left side. When I asked her, she giggled and assured me her right side wasn’t the dark side of the moon. A tiny person, so methodical. She left me amazed at her understanding of the film process. John Cromwell was the nominal director, but David was always lurking in the background. We shot and shot. Claudette’s two daughters were played by Jennifer Jones and Shirley Temple, in a comeback part at the ripe old age of fifteen. We had a lot of fun on the set because filming never seemed to stop. Or should I say some of us had fun. Jenny’s marriage to Robert Walker was falling apart even as they had to film romantic scenes where they were supposed to be falling in love. I’m a naval officer who comes and goes. There was a slight whiff of romance but nothing more. Today the characters would all be heaving away in bed. We thought we were finished several times and then David would recall everyone for additional scenes. Prints were about to be delivered when he ordered Claudette back again to shoot new scenes with Nazimova [the great Russian actress Alla Nazimova, who played a Polish immigrant in the film]. She told me since she was hired on a week-to-week basis that she made a fortune for it. And it was a big hit, a three-hour black-and-white saga of a family on the home front.\n\nBAWDEN: Around this time you got to kick Hollywood gossip columnist Hedda Hopper in the butt.\n\nCOTTEN: Well, somebody had to do it. I was then making a Deanna Durbin picture at Universal, a little something called Hers to Hold [1943]. And my wife and I were in San Francisco for the weekend. When we got back to L.A. it was after midnight, and since I had a 7 a.m. call I decided to proceed to the studio and sleep a few hours there in my dressing room. What I didn’t know was Deanna had decided on doing the same thing in her gargantuan dressing room on the other side of the lot. I never knew she was there until I read an item in Hedda Hopper’s column blasting me and hinting we were having a clandestine affair. Obviously, a security guard had sold Hedda the item. But it angered me, got my wife upset, and later at a party I saw Hedda bending over to pick something up and I let her have it. She toppled and I walked away singing. Well, a lot later Hedda comes up to me at another party and says, “Joseph, I had that coming to me,” and she just walks away, but with her head turned just in case I try for a repeat.\n\n[ . . . ]\n\nBAWDEN: People say your fifties movies were not as good as the forties ones.\n\nCOTTEN [snappish]: I know that! September Affair [1950] is pretty good. Joan Fontaine and I survive a plane crash and decide we’ll desert our families and live together. Very romantic. It should have been in color but the cameras were too bulky to be transported around Italy. The Man with a Cloak [1951] has me as Edgar Allan Poe investigating a possible murder in 1850s New York City. Silly stuff. My only film with Barbara Stanwyck. I was embarrassed I got first billing because MGM was trying to punish her for some transgression. Little Leslie Caron was the ingenue and she cried throughout the shooting. I mean, to go from An American in Paris to this! Blah!\n\nBAWDEN: But you were Marilyn Monroe’s husband in Niagara [1953].\n\nCOTTEN: Another murderous ex-soldier type. I never met a girl as introverted as Marilyn. The whole fame explosion had just set in and whenever we filmed on location at Niagara Falls, great crowds gathered to see her. She couldn’t cope, retreated into her shell.\n\nDirector Henry Hathaway was a tough taskmaster at the best of times. He got so exasperated with Marilyn and her Russian [acting] coach he finally banned the woman from the set. I tried to keep her distracted. At night there’d always be a party in my hotel suite, but she’d look in, say hi, and then go off with her instructress. We’d wait for hours for her to show up. Hathaway started shooting the rehearsals as backup and found she was less mannered there and actually used some of the footage.\n\nI asked her about the nude photograph and she said, dead serious, “But I had the radio on.” I’m glad I knew her before the troubles enveloped her and destroyed her. I want to remember that superb girlish laughter when I told her an off-color joke. One day Hathaway shouts at her and she yelled back, “After paying for my own wardrobe, my coach, my assistant, and God knows who else I barely have enough left over to pay my shrink!” And the crowd watching applauded her!\n\nAfterword\n\n1981 was Cotten’s last year as a working actor. He suffered a stroke in the shower and spent several years in rehabilitation before he could speak again. He wrote a funny memoir, Vanity Will Get You Somewhere (1987). He died of cancer in Westwood, California, on February 6, 1994, aged eighty-eight.\n\nIf you’re looking for more astounding behind-the-scenes stories from the greatest stars of Hollywood’s Golden Age, look no further than Conversations with Classic Film Stars by James Bawden and Ron Miller."
