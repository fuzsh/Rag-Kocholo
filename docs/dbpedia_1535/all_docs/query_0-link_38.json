        "text": "The Private View launch party was a brilliant success. We spoke with Laurence Stevens, the original graphics designer for all the Eurythmics albums and co-organiser of the photographic exhibition. We also got a chance to see a finished copy of BOXED, the 8-CD box set of all the reissue albums. The box is gorgeous. There’s writing on all four sides of the box. Amazing! It’s a work of art, and not just your ordinary box. Laurence has designed a stunning box to house the eight studio albums. It’s so stunning, I am sure Laurence will win a packaging design award for it.\n\nOn Monday October 31st, 2005, Eurythmics appeared at the Private View for the Eurythmics Ultimate Collection Photographic Exhibition. For the first 30 minutes Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart posed as sculptures with their eyes shut. As people gathered in the gallery to view the photos, when they got to the end of the gallery they could view Annie and Dave as pieces of art in their own right. It was a delightful sight to behold, and many guests took photos of the pair sitting in front of TV monitors that transmitted archive footage of Eurythmics from over the past 20 years.\n\nAlso spotted at the Private View was Dennis Morris, the famous photographer for the Sex Pistols and Bob Marley, Darren Hayes from Savage Garden, and Eurythmics webmaster, Tony Wong (the latter flew all the way from Australia for the event).\n\nMeanwhile, the groovy new single “I’ve Got A Life” is released this week in the UK and is flying off the shelves. We paid a brief visit to HMV in Piccadilly Circus just before the Private View last night. Dozens of people were frantically buying copies of the 12″ inch version of the single, as well as the CD1 and CD2 singles. Eurythmics fever is escalating. The new single is a welcome return and a shot in the arm to the UK singles chart. A stunning return to form. If you haven’t seen the video for the new single, be sure to go to www.eurythmics.com and view it to your heart’s content.\n\n(c) 2005 Peter Noble"
