Each year, pairs of students spend one hour a week in Hartford elementary and middle schools teaching about topics such as nutrition, exercise, bullying, mental health/identity, substance use, puberty/hygiene, healthy relationships, and sexual health. The program is one of the few health education resources available to these children, and it depends on the commitment of UConn medical and dental students to teach these once-a-week lessons. This is a great opportunity for anyone interested in mentoring, teaching, urban health education, or who just loves working with kids.\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nDr. Stacey Brown\n\nStudent Contact:\n\nHelen Bian, bian@uchc.edu\n\nHumanity First Student Organization (HFSO)\n\nThe primary purpose and intention of the HFSO at UConn School of Medicine is to advocate for human life by means of undertaking disaster relief efforts, as well as human development projects for socially disadvantaged communities in collaboration with Humanity First USA (HF-USA). Any HF-USA programs that HFSO at UConn School of Medicine members would like to partake in such as Water for Life, Our Kids Our Future, and others will have to be approved by HF-USA. Particularly, HFSO at UConn School of Medicine focuses on three major aims: Education Project, annual medical service trips to disadvantaged communities, and community outreach.\n\nThe Education Project provides UConn School of Medicine first and second year medical and dental students with the opportunity to act as tutors in one-on-one settings for disadvantaged students around America in subjects such as mathematics, sciences, and English. Humanity First USA has annual service trips internationally in which students are given the opportunity to shadow physicians, take vitals, scribe, and experience international medical systems. Lastly, the HFSO at UConn School of Medicine will emphasize community outreach. Specifically, we want to expand the Education Project opportunity to local communities such as Hartford school districts as well as to other regions that would be interested in educational opportunities. In addition, the HFSO will run used glasses drives, work with local food pantries, and look to provide further community outreach volunteer opportunities for UConn School of Medicine members.\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nDr. Dharamainder Choudhary\n\nStudent Contacts:\n\nAnthony Zhang, anzhang@uchc.edu\n\nJimin Shin, jishin@uchc.edu\n\nCesar Rubio-Ramos, rubioramos@uchc.edu\n\nParam Patel, parapatel@uchc.edu\n\nInfectious Diseases Interest Group (IDIG)\n\nIt was not long ago when the majority of people could expect to die from infections. The development of antibiotics, vaccination, and public sanitation revolutionized medicine, giving more of us the opportunity to succumb to heart disease and cancers. But a surge of issues makes infectious diseases and microbiology perhaps the most pressing medical challenge of our time. Widespread antimicrobial resistant “superbugs,” vaccine-hesitant populations, climate change bringing tropical diseases and strange new fungi to more polar latitudes, and a myriad of other challenges are anticipated to make infectious diseases the number one cause of mortality in the Global North and South alike by 2050.\n\nBut not all is lost, and not all microbes are bad. We are at the beginning of a renaissance of microbial-based therapeutics: phage and bacteriophore treatments for infections, engineered probiotics for a vast range of pursuits, viral and bacterial vectors for oncolytic therapies. We are seeing a new age of “interventional” microbiology.\n\nMore than any other field, whether you are a physician, a researcher, or a public health worker, when dealing with infectious diseases you need to be up to date on the relevant clinical medicine, basic science, and public health. That’s why the IDIG encompasses students from the medical school, dental school, school of public health, and anyone else who is interested. We host career panels, expert speakers, journal clubs, and outreach events. No matter your field, microbiology and infectious diseases will play a role, so come learn and rise to the challenge of the century.\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nDr. David Banach\n\nStudent Contacts:\n\nEmma Carlson, emcarlson@uchc.edu\n\nAjshe Zulfi, zulfi@uchc.edu\n\nInternal Medicine Scholars/Internal Medicine Interest Group\n\nThe Internal Medicine Scholars/Internal Medicine Interest Group meets on the second Wednesday of every month at the homes of various faculty members.

The premise of narrative medicine is that how a patient speaks about his or her illness or complaint is analogous to how literature offers an interconnected series of events with characters and is filled with metaphors, and that becoming conversant with the elements of literature facilitates understanding the stories that patients bring. At its core, narrative medicine is medicine practiced with narrative competence, which is the learned ability to listen, absorb, and really be moved to action and advocacy by stories of illness. Put simply, narrative medicine is clinical practice fortified by the knowledge of what to do with stories.\n\nPut another way, narrative medicine is an alternative medical approach to patient encounters that utilizes patients' narratives in clinical practice and education to promote healing. Beyond attempts to reach accurate diagnoses, it aims to address the relational and psychological dimensions that occur in tandem with physical illness. Narrative medicine aims not only to validate the experience of the patient, but it also encourages creativity and self-reflection in the physician. The ideal result is a physician well-versed in both evidence-based medicine and narrative medicine, meaning they are both scientifically and narratively competent, who henceforth is able to listen to a patient’s story and understand the significance of the patient’s suffering.\n\nThe Narrative Medicine Interest Group will promote the acquisition of narrative competence with lessons on how to apply it in clinical practice. We will host a series of workshops, with the initial focus being discussion of select pieces of literature (prose and poetry), visual art, and music in an effort to develop narrative competence. Subsequent workshops will focus on stories of illness and disability. At every workshop, students will write to prompts as a means to engage their sensibilities. Together, participants will decide how best to weave narrative medicine teaching into the curriculum.\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nDr. Adam Perrin, perrin@uchc.edu\n\nStudent Contact:\n\nNicolette (Niki) Meka, meka@uchc.edu\n\nOB/GYN Scholars Interest Group\n\nOB/GYN Scholars is a student organization whose goal is to further students’ interest and knowledge in the field of obstetrics and gynecology.

One of the reasons the American Academy of Oral Medicine (AAOM) petitioned for specialty recognition was to increase patient and provider awareness of the expertise held by oral medicine specialists. Referral of patients to appropriate specialists is an important factor in improving patient outcomes. Currently, oral medicine is specifically addressed in the ODCM course, which takes place during second year.\n\nA highlight of the MDelta curriculum is the focus on interprofessional education. Oral medicine is a career built on interprofessional care and provides a bridge between medicine and dentistry. The interest group would be open to both dental and medical students.

The clinic was opened in October, 1987 by a group of medical students at the UConn School of Medicine. For the past 20 years, the clinic has served over 750 patients per year, providing primary care, counseling and information for the community of the South Park Inn Shelter, in Hartford's south end. The general medical clinic is open weekly and is staffed by hundreds of student volunteers and supervised by community physicians who donate their time. Every Tuesday and Thursday evening, clinic volunteers see 10 to 15 shelter residents ranging in age from 1 to 80 years old, with medical problems, concerns about safety, and hygiene. The primary goal of the clinic is to provide much-needed medical attention to the residents of the South Park Inn, while providing an opportunity for medical students to become familiar with the special needs of a homeless population. The clinic is equipped to diagnose and treat minor medical and psychiatric problems and refer patients to area hospitals and support services when required. In addition to the general medical clinic, specialty clinics include a women’s clinic which meets the second Wednesday of each month, and a dermatology clinic which meets the first Thursday of each month. Also, at South Park Inn once a month there is education provided by medical students to the residents about a general health topic pertinent to that patient population and once a month there is education for the women to address issues such as contraception.\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nDr. Bruce Gould\n\nStudent Contacts:\n\nMakayla Portley, portley@uchc.edu\n\nNicole Gomez, nicgomez@uchc.edu\n\nAbhishek Gupta, abhgupta@uchc.edu\n\nSouth Park Inn Medical/Dental Clinic 5K Road Race\n\nSince 1998 annual benefit road race held in September on the UConn Health campus.
