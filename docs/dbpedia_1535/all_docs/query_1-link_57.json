        "text": "In questo contributo viene indagato il contesto nel quale sono stati pubblicati gli Offertoria e le Communiones totius anni di Mikołaj Zieleński. Attraverso un’analisi della produzione editoriale veneziana (oggi conservata e non) apparsa intorno al 1611, viene proposta una riflessione sulle strategie perseguite dalle diverse officine veneziane impegnate nel settore musicale, sulla tipologia del repertorio musicale pubblicato e sulla presenza di compositori foresti come Zieleński. L’obiettivo è quello di mettere a fuoco le peculiarità di un’operazione editoriale senz’altro fuori dal comune. This paper investigates the context in which Mikołaj Zieleński’s Offertoria and Communiones totius anni was published. Through an analysis of Venetian music editions produced around 1611 (today preserved or lost), it intends to reflect on the strategies pursued by the Venetian music publishers, on the typology of published music repertoire, and on the presence of foreign composers such as Zieleński. The purpose is to focus on the characteristics of an editorial project, which undoubtedly are out of the ordinary. Published in: Tomasz Jeż, Barbara Przybyszewska-Jarmińska, Marina Toffetti (eds), Italian Music in Central-Eastern Europe. Around Mikołaj Zieleński’s Offertoria and Communiones (1611), (Conference proceedings: Warsaw, 12–15 October 2011). Venice: Fondazione Levi, 2015, pp. 151-170.\n\nAndrea Garavaglia and Nicola Usula, curators for the conference \"Collecting Music in Europe in the Second Half of the Seventeenth Century,\" Faculté des Lettres, Université de Fribourg, October 20-21 2023, SNSF project \"L’opera italiana oltre le Alpi: la collezione di partiture e libretti di Leopoldo I a Vienna (1640-1705)\" (2021-2023, n. 100016_197560) The Department of Musicology at the University of Fribourg is pleased to present the two-day international conference \"Collecting Music in Europe in the Second Half of the Seventeenth Century\" on October 20 and 21, 2023. Different practices of 17th-century European music collecting are at the core of this international conference, funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) as an outcome of the research project launched in 2021 in the Department of Musicology at the University of Fribourg: \"L'opera italiana oltre le Alpi: la collezione di partiture e libretti di Leopoldo I a Vienna (1640-1705).\" In their papers fifteen speakers address various aspects of music collecting in the seventeenth century, in Italy, France, Scandinavia and the Holy Roman Empire, focusing on this phenomenon as a symptom (and trigger) of a wide process of dissemination, exchange and hybridisation of different European musical traditions. At the link is the two-day program and booklet with abstracts.\n\nA manuscript kept in the Chapter Archives in Hvar (Dalmatia, region of Southern Croatia) contains a list of books and music material owned by the Chapter of the Hvar Cathedral in 1646/47. Although now lost, the recorded music titles bear witness to the quantity and quality of music in the town of Hvar (and generally in Dalmatia) during the 1st half of the 17th century. This (music) inventory testifies not only to the presence of contemporary Italian (mostly Venetian early-Baroque) music literature on the island; it also reveals two titles of Tomaso Cecchini’s to date unknown opuses, added here to the revised list of Cecchini’s works. Considering the importance of this source in the context of Croatian music historiography and (early) Baroque culture, a focal point of this article is an overview of the inventory’s musical content. It is pre sented here by way of a table containing transcribed titles and additional details on the authors and printed editions, which were formerly a part of the Cathedral Chapter’s music collection.\n\nThe impulse for this article was the emergence of the 1736 inventory of the archdeanery church of St James the Greater in Sokolov (Falkenau) with the previously unnoticed specification of \"Musicalien und Instrumenten\" in three places: in the collection of church inventories of the Prague Archbishopric, in the parish chronicle, and finally in the parish archives with significant additions and within the whole series of church inventories (1707, 1731, 1736, 1769, 1781, 1798, 1815, 1827). The article follows both the scope of the local music collection, which is lost today, and the evolution of music items in the inventories judging their changing information value. It comprises the edition preserving the dynamic character of the sources. Their contents indicate that in the first decades of the 18th century, printed music still formed the core of the music collection. It was also possible to outline the position of the church choir within the presumed streams of music circulation and trace the links with the music centres of Prague (especially with the music collection of the Knights of the Cross with the Red Star) and Dresden (Cozzi, Ristori, Vivaldi, Zelenka). The inventorying method often consisted in the copying of the previous inventory and the later lists obviously strive more to keep the continuity with the preceding lists rather than reflect the real situation."
