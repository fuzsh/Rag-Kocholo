The log-domain lossless differentiator was realized by using seven BJTs and one grounded capacitor, the lossy integrator using five BJTs and one grounded capacitor, and the lossless integrator using seven BJTs and one grounded capacitor. The simplified signal flow graph (SFG) of the elliptic ladder LPF consisted of two lossy integrators, one lossless integrator, and one lossless differentiator, while that of the elliptic ladder BPF contained two lossy integrators, five lossless integrators, and one lossless differentiator. Log-domain cells were directly incorporated into the simplified SFGs. Simulations were carried out using PSpice with transistor array HFA3127. The proposed filters are operable in a low-voltage environment and are suitable for mobile equipment and further integration. The log-domain principle enables the frequency responses of the filters to be electronically tunable between 10k Hz–10 MHz. The proposed filters are applicable for low-frequency biosensors by reconfiguring certain capacitors. The filters can efficiently remove low-frequency noise and random noise in the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal.

Pixelated silicon sensors facilitate the direct detection of low-energy X-ray radiation. In this study, we developed junction field effect transistors (JFETs) that can be integrated into a pixelated silicon sensor to effectively handle many signal readout channels due to the pixelated structure without any change in the sensor resolution; this capability of the integrated system arises from the pixelated structure of the sensor. We focused on optimizing the JFET’s switching function, and simulated JFETs with different fabrication parameters. Furthermore, prototype JFET switches were designed and fabricated on the basis of the simulated results. It is important not only to keep the low leakage currents in the JFET but also reduce the current flow as much as possible by providing a high resistance when the JFET switch is off. We determined the optimal fabrication conditions for the effective switching of the JFETs. In this paper, we present the results of the measurement of the switching capability of the fabricated JFETs for various design variables and fabrication conditions.

In the case of pesticide residues, reference procedures typically find less than 1% of tested samples being contaminated, thus indicating the necessity for new tools able to support smart and affordable prescreening. Here, we introduce a hybrid paper–lab-on-a-chip platform, which integrates on-demand injectors to perform multiple step protocols in a single disposable device. Simultaneous detection of enzymatic color response in sample and reference cells, using a regular smartphone, enabled semiquantitative detection of carbofuran, a neurotoxic and EU-banned carbamate pesticide, in a wide concentration range. The resulting evaluation procedure is generic and allows the rejection of spurious measurements based on their dynamic responses, and was effectively applied for the binary detection of carbofuran in apple extracts.

The proper estimation of GNSS PW can be affected by the GNSS processing strategy as well as the local geographical properties of GNSS sites. To better understand the impact of these factors, we compare PW estimates from two nearby permanent GPS stations (THTI and FAA1) in the tropical Tahiti Island, a basalt shield volcano located in the South Pacific, with a mean slope of 8% and a diameter of 30 km. The altitude difference between the two stations is 86.14 m, and their horizontal distance difference is 2.56 km. In this paper, Bernese GNSS Software Version 5.2 with precise point positioning (PPP) and Vienna mapping function 1 (VMF1) was applied to estimate the zenith tropospheric delay (ZTD), which was compared with the International GNSS Service (IGS) Final products. The meteorological parameters sourced from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the local weighted mean temperature ( T m ) model were used to estimate the GPS PW for three years (May 2016 to April 2019). The results show that the differences of PW between two nearby GPS stations is nearly a constant with value 1.73 mm. In our case, this difference is mainly driven by insolation differences, the difference in altitude and the wind being only second factors.

However, the visual observation of VIO is more susceptible to the environment, and the error of observation affects the final positioning accuracy. To address this issue, we analyzed the causes of visual observation error that occur under different scenarios and their impact on positioning accuracy. We propose a new method of using the short-time reliability of pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) to aid in visual integrity monitoring and to reduce positioning error. The proposed method selects optimized positioning by automatically switching between outputs from VIO and PDR. Experiments were carried out to test and evaluate the proposed PDR-assisted visual integrity monitoring. The sensor suite of experiments consisted of a stereo camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Results were analyzed in detailed and indicated that the proposed system performs better for indoor positioning within an environment that contains low illumination, little background texture information, or few moving objects.

Biosensor responses are based on the detection of H2O2, generated in the enzymatic reaction, at 0.4 V. A simple and fast method, consisting of direct adsorption of the bioconjugate, formed by mixing lactate oxidase, glucose oxidase, or uricase with CNDs, is employed to develop the nanostructured biosensors. Peripherical amide groups enriched CNDs are prepared from ethyleneglycol bis-(2-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, and used as precursors. The bioconjugate formed between lactate oxidase and CNDs was chosen as a case study to determine the analytical parameters of the resulting L-lactate biosensor. A linear concentration range of 3.0 to 500 µM, a sensitivity of 4.98 × 10−3 µA·µM−1, and a detection limit of 0.9 µM were obtained for the L-lactate biosensing platform. The reproducibility of the biosensor was found to be 8.6%. The biosensor was applied to the L-lactate quantification in a commercial human serum sample. The standard addition method was employed. L-lactate concentration in the serum extract of 0.9 ± 0.3 mM (n = 3) was calculated. The result agrees well with the one obtained in 0.9 ± 0.2 mM, using a commercial spectrophotometric enzymatic kit.

Given the bandwidth and power constraints of the radar system, MIMO radar can improve its performance by optimize design transmit waveforms and receive filters, so as to achieve better performance in suppressing clutter and noise. In this paper, we cyclicly optimize the transmit waveform and receive filters, so as to maximize the output signal interference and noise ratio (SINR). From fixed pulse-to-pulse waveform to pulse-to-pulse waveform variations, we discuss the joint optimization under energy constraint, then extend it to optimizations under constant-envelope constraint and similarity constraint. Compared to optimization with fixed pulse-to-pulse waveform, the generalized optimization achieves higher output SINR and lower minimum detectable velocity (MDV), further improve the suppressing performance.

However, the specific configurations of SAR sensors (e.g., band frequency, polarization mode) used to identify land-use types remains underexplored. This study investigates the contribution of C/L-Band frequency, dual/quad polarization and the density of image time-series to winter land-use identification in an agricultural area of approximately 130 km² located in northwestern France. First, SAR parameters were derived from RADARSAT-2, Sentinel-1 and Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) time-series, and one quad-pol and six dual-pol datasets with different spatial resolutions and densities were calculated. Then, land use was classified using the Random Forest algorithm with each of these seven SAR datasets to determine the most suitable SAR configuration for identifying winter land-use. Results highlighted that (i) the C-Band (F1-score 0.70) outperformed the L-Band (F1-score 0.57), (ii) quad polarization (F1-score 0.69) outperformed dual polarization (F1-score 0.59) and (iii) a dense Sentinel-1 time-series (F1-score 0.70) outperformed RADARSAT-2 and ALOS-2 time-series (F1-score 0.69 and 0.29, respectively). In addition, Shannon Entropy and SPAN were the SAR parameters most important for discriminating winter land-use. Thus, the results of this study emphasize the interest of using Sentinel-1 time-series data for identifying winter land-use.

They consist of a large number of static sensors and also a few other smart devices, such as different types of robots. Sensor nodes have responsibility for sensing and sending information towards an actor node any time there is an event that needs immediate intervention such as natural disasters or malicious attacks in the network. The actor node is responsible for processing and taking prompt action accordingly. But in order to select an appropriate actor to do one task, we need to consider different parameters, which make the problem NP-hard. For this reason, we consider Fuzzy Logic and propose two Fuzzy Based Simulation Systems (FBSS). FBSS1 has three input parameters such as Number of Sensors per Actor (NSA), Remaining Energy (RE) and Distance to Event (DE).

The pixel was capable of a high conversion gain readout with 160 μV/e− for low light signals while a large full-well capacity of 120 ke− was obtained for high light signals. The combination of LOFIC and the BSI technology allowed for high optical performance without degradation caused by extra devices for the LOFIC structure. The sensor realized a 70% peak quantum efficiency with a normal (no anti-reflection coating) cover glass and a 91% angular response at ±20° incident light. This 2.8-μm pixel is potentially capable of higher than 100 dB dynamic range imaging in a pure single exposure operation.

We investigated whether and how wearable inertial sensors can describe the gait kinematic features among ataxic patients. Methods. We enrolled 17 patients and 16 matched control subjects. We acquired data by means of an inertial sensor attached to an ergonomic belt around pelvis, which was connected to a portable computer via Bluetooth. Recordings of all the patients were obtained during overground walking. From the accelerometric data, we obtained the harmonic ratio (HR), i.e., a measure of the acceleration patterns, smoothness and rhythm, and the step length coefficient of variation (CV), which evaluates the variability of the gait cycle. Results. Compared to controls, patients had a lower HR, meaning a less harmonic and rhythmic acceleration pattern of the trunk, and a higher step length CV, indicating a more variable step length. Both HR and step length CV showed a high effect size in distinguishing patients and controls (p < 0.001 and p = 0.011, respectively). A positive correlation was found between the step length CV and both the number of falls (R = 0.672; p = 0.003) and the clinical severity (ICARS: R = 0.494; p = 0.044; SARA: R = 0.680; p = 0.003). Conclusion. These findings demonstrate that the use of inertial sensors is effective in evaluating gait and balance impairment among ataxic patients.

The system could acquire signals from 8 PPG probes and 10 ECG leads. Each PPG probe was constituted of a light-emitting diode (LED) source at a wavelength of 940 nm and a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) detector, located in a back-reflection recording configuration. In order to ensure proper optode-to-skin coupling, the probe was equipped with insufflating cuffs. The high number of PPG probes allowed us to simultaneously acquire signals from multiple body locations. The ECG provided a reference for single-pulse PPG evaluation and averaging, allowing the extraction of indices of cardiovascular status with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Firstly, the system was characterized on optical phantoms. Furthermore, in vivo validation was performed by estimating the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), a metric associated with cardiovascular status. The validation was performed on healthy volunteers to assess the baPWV intra- and extra-operator repeatability and its association with age. Finally, the baPWV, evaluated via the developed instrumentation, was compared to that estimated with a commercial system used in clinical practice (Enverdis Vascular Explorer). The validation demonstrated the system’s reliability and its effectiveness in assessing the cardiovascular status in arterial ageing.

The purpose of the present work was to investigate the advantages of utilizing a multi-bioradar system in the accuracy of remote fall detection. The proposed concept combined usage of wavelet transform and deep learning to detect fall episodes. The continuous wavelet transform was used to get a time-frequency representation of the bio-radar signal and use it as input data for a pre-trained convolutional neural network AlexNet adapted to solve the problem of detecting falls. Processing of the experimental results showed that the designed multi-bioradar system can be used as a simple and view-independent approach implementing a non-contact fall detection method with an accuracy and F1-score of 99%.

Firstly, the dynamic property of the actuator is analyzed by an example. Then, a basic control law is derived to achieve the finite-time stability using the double fast terminal sliding mode manifold. When there is no prior knowledge of time matrix of the actuator, an adaptive law is proposed to estimate the unknown information. An adaptive control law is derived to guarantee the finite-time convergence of the attitude, and a Lyapunov-based analysis is provided. Finally, simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control law to the attitude stabilization with the actuator dynamics. The results show that the high-precision attitude control performance can be achieved by the proposed scheme.

Since the latter situation is rarely studied in the field of underwater image enhancement, we propose a new model to include it in the analysis of underwater image degradation. Based on the theoretical study of the new model, a comprehensive method for enhancing underwater images under different illumination conditions is proposed in this paper. The proposed method is composed of two modules: color-tone correction and fusion-based descattering. In the first module, the regional or full-extent color deviation caused by different types of incident light is corrected via frequency-based color-tone estimation. And in the second module, the residual low contrast and pixel-wise color shift problems are handled by combining the descattering results under the assumption of different states of the image. The proposed method is experimented on laboratory and open-water images of different depths and illumination states. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms many other methods in enhancing the quality of different types of underwater images, and is especially effective in improving the color accuracy and information content in badly-illuminated regions of underwater images with non-uniform illumination, such as deep-sea images.

However, the SPEI calculated based on the TH model is overestimated globally, whereas the more accurate ET derived from the Penman–Monteith (PM) model recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is unavailable due to the lack of a large amount of meteorological data at most places. Therefore, how to improve the accuracy of ET calculated by the TH model becomes the focus of this study. Here, a revised TH (RTH) model is proposed using the temperature (T) and precipitable water vapor (PWV) data. The T and PWV data are derived from the reanalysis data and the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) observation, respectively. The initial value of ET for the RTH model is calculated based on the TH model, and the time series of ET residual between the TH and PM models is then obtained. Analyzed results reveal that ET residual is highly correlated with PWV and T, and the correlate coefficient between PWV and ET is −0.66, while that between T and ET for cases of T larger or less than 0 °C are −0.54 and 0.59, respectively. Therefore, a linear model between ET residual and PWV/T is established, and the ET value of the RTH model can be obtained by combining the TH-derived ET and estimated ET residual. Finally, the SPEI calculated based on the RTH model can be obtained and compared with that derived using PM and TH models. Result in the Loess Plateau (LP) region reveals the good performance of the RTH-based SPEI when compared with the TH-based SPEI over the period of 1979–2016. A case analysis in April 2013 over the LP region also indicates the superiority of the RTH-based SPEI at 88 meteorological and 31 GNSS stations when the PM-based SPEI is considered as the reference.

The variability of the environment (temperature, humidity) can lead to a drift of the QTF resonance. In most applications, regular QTF calibration is absolutely essential. Because the requirements vary greatly depending on the field of application, different characterization methods can be found in the literature. We present a review of these methods and compare them in terms of accuracy. Then, we further detail one technique, called Beat Frequency analysis, based on the transient response followed by heterodyning. This method proved to be fast and accurate. Further, we demonstrate the resonance tracking of the QTF while changing the temperature and the humidity. Finally, we integrate this characterization method in our Resonance Tracking (RT) QEPAS sensor and show the significant reduction of the signal drift compared to a conventional QEPAS sensor.

However, it is troublesome to handle slots with few or no shorelines, or slots covered by clouds. Geometric correction by frequency matching has been proposed to handle these slots. In this paper, we further extend previous research on frequency matching by comparing the performance of three frequency domain matching methods: phase correlation, gradient correlation, and orientation correlation. We compared the performance of each matching technique in terms of match success rate and geometric accuracy. We concluded that the three frequency domain matching method with peak search range limits was comparable to geometric correction performance with shoreline matching. The proposed method handles translation only, and assumes that rotation has been corrected. We need to do further work on how to handle rotation by frequency matching.

This paper proposes a Kalman filter-based quad-constellation global navigation satellite system (GNSS) navigation algorithm with colored noise mitigation. In this algorithm, the observation colored noise and state colored noise models are established by utilizing their residuals in the past epochs, and then the colored noise is predicted using the models for mitigation in the current epoch in the integrated Global Positioning System (GPS)/GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS)/BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS)/Galileo navigation. Kinematic single point positioning (SPP) experiments under different satellite visibility conditions and road patterns are conducted to evaluate the effect of colored noise on the positioning accuracy for the quad-constellation combined navigation. Experiment results show that the colored noise model can fit the colored noise more effectively in the case of good satellite visibility. As a result, the positioning accuracy improvement is more significant after handling the colored noise. The three-dimensional positioning accuracy can be improved by 25.1%. Different satellite elevation cut-off angles of 10º, 20º and 30º are set to simulate different satellite visibility situations. Results indicate that the colored noise is decreased with the increment of the elevation cut-off angle. Consequently, the improvement of the SPP accuracy after handling the colored noise is gradually reduced from 27.3% to 16.6%. In the cases of straight and curved roads, the quad-constellation GNSS-SPP accuracy can be improved by 22.1% and 25.7% after taking the colored noise into account. The colored noise can be well-modeled and mitigated in both the straight and curved road conditions.

Since the components of such a sensor, like antennas and energy harvesting, also require space on the surface, the actual, effective sensing area is usually much smaller than the total surface of the device. Consequently, with an array of such sensors, it is not possible to monitor the entire surface of an object without gaps, even if the sensors are mounted directly adjacent to each other. Furthermore, the excessive size may also prevent the application of a single sensor in space constraint situations as they occur, e.g., on aircrafts. This article investigates a sensor concept in which the electrodes of the sensors are used for both radio data transmission and energy harvesting at the same time. Thus, the wireless data transmission in the 2.45 GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band is combined with the sensor electrodes and also with a photovoltaic cell for energy harvesting. The combination of sensor technology, communication, and harvesting enables a compact system and thus reduces blind spots to a minimum.

The objective of this study was to propose an automatic method for extracting rice thickness. This method was based on the principle of binocular stereovision but avoiding the problem that it was difficult to directly match the corresponding points for 3D reconstruction due to the lack of texture of rice. Firstly, the shape features of edge, instead of texture, was used to match the corresponding points of the rice edge. Secondly, the height of the rice edge was obtained by way of space intersection. Finally, the thickness of rice was extracted based on the assumption that the average height of the edges of multiple rice is half of the thickness of rice. According to the results of the experiments on six kinds of rice or grain, errors of thickness extraction were no more than the upper limit of 0.1 mm specified in the national industry standard. The results proved that edge features could be used to extract rice thickness and validated the effectiveness of the thickness extraction algorithm we proposed, which provided technical support for the extraction of phenotyping parameters for crop researchers.

A self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate) (DTSP) was used to modify the electrode array for antibody immobilization. The SAM functionalized electrode array was characterized morphologically by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The nature of gold-sulfur interactions on SAM-treated electrode array was probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The covalent linking of anti-CRP-antibodies onto the SAM modified electrode array was characterized morphologically through AFM, and electrochemically through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The application of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and human serum (HS) samples containing different concentrations of CRP in the electrode array caused changes in the electrode interfacial capacitance upon CRP binding. CRP concentrations in PBS and HS were determined quantitatively by measuring the change in capacitance (ΔC) through EIS. The electrode immobilized with anti-CRP-antibodies showed an increase in ΔC with the addition of CRP concentrations over a range of 0.01–10,000 ng mL−1. The electrode showed detection limits of 0.025 ng mL−1 and 0.23 ng mL−1 (S/N = 3) in PBS and HS, respectively. The biosensor showed a good reproducibility (relative standard deviation (RSD), 1.70%), repeatability (RSD, 1.95%), and adequate selectivity in presence of interferents towards CRP detection.

Therefore, a tree segmentation method based on monocular machine vision technology and a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm are proposed in this paper to segment citrus trees precisely under different brightness and weed coverage conditions. To reduce the sensitivity to environmental brightness, a selective illumination histogram equalization method was developed to compensate for the illumination, thereby improving the brightness contrast for the foreground without changing its hue and saturation. To accurately differentiate fruit trees from different weed coverage backgrounds, a chromatic aberration segmentation algorithm and the Otsu threshold method were combined to extract potential fruit tree regions. Then, 14 color features, five statistical texture features, and local binary pattern features of those regions were calculated to establish an SVM segmentation model.

However, acoustic signals lack propagation speed as compared to radio or optical waves. In addition, the UWSNs also pose various intrinsic challenges, i.e., frequent node mobility with water currents, high error rate, low bandwidth, long delays, and energy scarcity. Various UWSN routing protocols have been proposed to overcome the above-mentioned challenges. Vector-based routing protocols confine the communication within a virtual pipeline for the sake of directionality and define a fixed pipeline radius between the source node and the centerline station. Energy-Scaled and Expanded Vector-Based Forwarding (ESEVBF) protocol limits the number of duplicate packets by expanding the holding time according to the propagation delay, and thus reduces the energy consumption via the remaining energy of Potential Forwarding Nodes (PFNs) at the first hop. The holding time mechanism of ESEVBF is restricted only to the first-hop PFNs of the source node. The protocol fails when there is a void or energy hole at the second hop, affecting the reliability of the system. Our proposed protocol, Extended Energy-Scaled and Expanded Vector-Based Forwarding Protocol (EESEVBF), exploits the holding time mechanism to suppress duplicate packets. Moreover, the proposed protocol tackles the hidden terminal problem due to which a reasonable reduction in duplicate packets initiated by the reproducing nodes occurs. The holding time is calculated based on the following four parameters: (i) the distance from the boundary of the transmission area relative to the PFNs’ inverse energy at the 1st and 2nd hop, (ii) distance from the virtual pipeline, (iii) distance from the source to the PFN at the second hop, and (iv) distance from the first-hop PFN to its destination. Therefore, the proposed protocol stretches the holding time difference based on two hops, resulting in lower energy consumption, decreased end-to-end delay, and increased packet delivery ratio. The simulation results demonstrate that compared to ESEVBF, our proposed protocol EESEVBF experiences 20.2 % lesser delay, approximately 6.66 % more energy efficiency, and a further 11.26 % reduction in generating redundant packets.

Lactams are an essential family of commodity chemicals widely used in the nylon industry with annual production of millions of tons. The bio-production of lactams can substantially benefit from high-throughput lactam sensing strategies for lactam producer screening. We present here a robust and living lactam biosensor that is directly compatible with high-throughput analytical means. The biosensor is a hydrogel microparticle encapsulating living microcolonies of engineered lactam-responsive Escherichia coli. The microparticles feature facile and ultra-high throughput manufacturing of up to 10,000,000 per hour through droplet microfluidics. We show that the biosensors can specifically detect major lactam species in a dose-dependent manner, which can be quantified using flow cytometry. The biosensor could potentially be used for high-throughput metabolic engineering of lactam biosynthesis.

In this paper, a novel algorithm based on least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) is proposed to classify measurement points for adjacent targets. Extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm is firstly adopted to compute the predicted classification line for each sampling period, which will be used to classify sampling points and calculate observed centers of closely moving targets. Then LS-SVM algorithm is utilized to train the classified points and get the best classification line, which will then be the reference classification line for the next sampling period. Finally, the locations of the targets will be precisely estimated by using observed centers based on EKF. A series of simulations validate the feasibility and accuracy of the new algorithm, while the experimental results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposal.

While, the human can clearly detect the existence of errors, which is manifested in the central nervous activity characteristics. To date, the majority of studies on falling-risk detection have focused primarily on computer vision and physical signals. There are no reports of falling-risk detection methods based on neural activity. In this study, we propose a novel method to monitor multi erroneous motion events using electroencephalogram (EEG) features. There were 15 subjects who participated in this study, who kept standing with an upper limb supported posture and received an unpredictable postural perturbation. EEG signal analysis revealed a high negative peak with a maximum averaged amplitude of −14.75 ± 5.99 μV, occurring at 62 ms after postural perturbation. The xDAWN algorithm was used to reduce the high-dimension of EEG signal features. And, Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) was used to train a classifier. The detection rate of the falling-risk onset is 98.67%. And the detection latency is 334ms, when we set detection rate beyond 90% as the standard of dangerous event onset. Further analysis showed that the falling-risk detection method based on postural perturbation evoked potential features has a good generalization ability. The model based on typical event data achieved 94.2% detection rate for unlearned atypical perturbation events. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using neural response to detect dangerous fall events.

Though people regularly recognize many distinct emotions, for the most part, research studies have been limited to six basic categories: happiness, surprise, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust. Like normal expressions (i.e., macro-expressions), most current research into micro-expression recognition focuses on these six basic emotions. This paper describes an important group of micro-expressions, which we call compound emotion categories. Compound micro-expressions are constructed by combining two basic micro-expressions but reflect more complex mental states and more abundant human facial emotions. In this study, we firstly synthesized a Compound Micro-expression Database (CMED) based on existing spontaneous micro-expression datasets. These subtle feature of micro-expression makes it difficult to observe its motion track and characteristics. Consequently, there are many challenges and limitations to synthetic compound micro-expression images. The proposed method firstly implemented Eulerian Video Magnification (EVM) method to enhance facial motion features of basic micro-expressions for generating compound images. The consistent and differential facial muscle articulations (typically referred to as action units) associated with each emotion category have been labeled to become the foundation of generating compound micro-expression. Secondly, we extracted the apex frames of CMED by 3D Fast Fourier Transform (3D-FFT). Moreover, the proposed method calculated the optical flow information between the onset frame and apex frame to produce an optical flow feature map. Finally, we designed a shallow network to extract high-level features of these optical flow maps. In this study, we synthesized four existing databases of spontaneous micro-expressions (CASME I, CASME II, CAS(ME)2, SAMM) to generate the CMED and test the validity of our network. Therefore, the deep network framework designed in this study can well recognize the emotional information of basic micro-expressions and compound micro-expressions.
