This is an exciting and fast-paced event where teams can create together. New and experienced students participated in this free event.\n\nResearch Park Tours\n\nGuests were invited to join us for tours of the Research Park, including visits with startup companies in the EnterpriseWorks incubator and corporations throughout the Research Park.\n\nChampaign-Urbana AgTech Week\n\nChampaign-Urbana has long been a hub for technology as well as agriculture. In the past decade, those two paths have converged, paving the way for the community to become an “epicenter for AgTech.” In addition to the AgTech Summit, there are several events during AgTech Week from March 4-8.\n\nAgTech Student Career Panel\n\nStudents were invited to join us to hear from their peers working in agtech within the Research Park. Thanks for joining us in the ACES Library Tuesday, February 20.\n\nAgTech Award\n\nEdwin Moore Family Agriculture Award\n\nThe Edwin Moore Family Agriculture award was established in 2016 with a generous gift to EnterpriseWorks. The goal of this award is to help startup companies engaged in the development of new innovative technologies that may lead to increased productivity and/or efficiency in farming or to create new agricultural opportunities, including new processes, new crops, and new food production systems.\n\nThe award honors the legacy of Edwin E. Moore (1924), who graduated from the University of Illinois College of Agriculture and began farming in Will County. Throughout his agricultural career, he and his wife, Iva, used innovative farming practices for both crop production and livestock management. Two of their four children also became farmers, Edwin and Thomas (1953, College of Agriculture), and continued use of innovative farm practices. Subsequent generations of Edwin Moore’s family have continued to pursue farming and ag-related careers capturing the same innovative spirit.\n\nThe previous winners include:\n\nHypercell Technologies (2024)\n\nFarmers Risk (2023)\n\nFrostDefense(2022)\n\nEpivara(2021)\n\nAspiringUniverse(2020)\n\nTellTail(2019)\n\nEarthSense(2018)\n\nSoil Diagnostics(2017)\n\nGlen “GB” Brandt Prize for Ag Entrepreneurism Award\n\nThe Glen “GB” Brandt Prize for Ag Entrepreneurism was established in 2021 in honor of Glen “GB” Brandt, a legendary figure in the field of Illinois agriculture, who passed away in late 2020. The BRANDT Foundation partnered with the University of Illinois to provide the winner a $10,000 prize.\n\nThe BRANDT Foundation was established in 2012 as a philanthropic extension of BRANDT, Inc. The Brandt family has always stood with their communities and as their company grew, so did the opportunities to give back. The BRANDT Foundation offers donations, grants, and support to the charities, organizations, and communities that reside in the same area of the company; geographically and industry-related.\n\nThe BRANDT Foundation seeks to honor the legacy of founder Glen “GB” Brandt by recognizing an Illinois farmer for their role in advancing innovation and entrepreneurship in the ag sector. A $10,000 cash prize will be awarded to the nominee who exemplifies an entrepreneurial spirit and advances innovation through their business practices. The recipient may use this prize on their farm how they wish. The winner will be announced at the AgTech Summit.\n\nThe previous winners include:\n\nAndrew and Karlie Bowman (2024)\n\nEric Miller (2023)\n\nMatt Riggs(2022)\n\nWill Glazik(2021)\n\nAgTech Summit History\n\nCheck out these highlights from our AgTech Innovation Summits of past years.\n\n2023\n\n2023 Videos\n\n2023 Photo Gallery\n\n2022\n\n2022 Videos\n\n2022 Photo Gallery\n\nMarch 9, WCIA: AgTech Innovation Summit\n\nMarch 9, Brownfield: Vertical Integration has farmer/brewer less concerned about inflation\n\nFebruary 23, Speaker RFD Profit Watch\n\n2021\n\n2021 AgTech Innovation Summit Recap Video\n\n2021 AgTech Innovation Summit Photos\n\nAgTech Summit 2021 in the Media\n\nMarch 20, The News-Gazette: Rural Paxton farmer’s spirit recognized\n\nMarch 12, AgDaily: Illinois Farmer Receives Ag Entrepreneurial Award\n\nMarch 4, WCIA: We’re thinking spring in Champaign County\n\nFebruary 10, Smile Politely: The 2021 AgTech Innovation Summit is Happening on March 10th\n\n2020\n\n2020 AgTech Summit Photos\n\n2019\n\n2019 AgTech Summit Photos\n\n2018\n\n2018 AgTech Summit Photos\n\n2017\n\n2017 AgTech Summit Photos\n\n2016\n\n2016 AgTech Summit Photos"
