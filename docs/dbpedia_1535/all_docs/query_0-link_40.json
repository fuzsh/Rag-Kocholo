        "text": "Research\n\nMy program of research focuses on brainwave entrainment for the management of hyper-arousal related health conditions such as insomnia and hypertension. I am currently conducting research to evaluate the effectiveness of the slow brainwave light-sound stimulation for sleep promotion in people with chronic pain. My general research interest is in the area of non-pharmacological approaches that empower self-regulation for health promotion.\n\nTeaching: I have taught in both undergraduate and graduate programs. My main teaching role is in the psychiatry and mental health track. I believe in educating the whole person, with an emphasis on developing life-long learners and socially responsible health professionals.\n\nPractice, Service, Community Involvement: Clinically, I am an Adult Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner. My practice philosophy embraces interdisciplinary collaboration model. I believe the patient-provider partnership is the core for the optimal care outcome.\n\nEducation\n\nBSN, University of Dubuque\n\nMS, University of Washington\n\nPhD, University of Washington\n\nPostdoctoral Fellowship, University of Pennsylvania\n\nAwards and accolades\n\n2020 Excellence in Promoting Diversity through Teaching Award\n\n2018 Sandy Eyres Appreciation Award, School of Nursing, University of Washington\n\n2015 Invited participant to the 8th Annual Bedside to Bench Conference “Sleep, Circadian Rhythms, and Aging: New Avenues for Improving Brain Health, Physical Health and Functioning”, sponsored by the National Institute on Aging and the American Geriatrics Society (AGS).\n\n2014 National Institute of Aging, Butler-Williams Scholars Program\n\n2011‐2013 John A.
