        "text": "Début Juried High School Art Exhibition features select student artwork from regional high schools with cash awards issued for excellence.\n\nThis year, to celebrate 45 years of this prestigious exhibition The Holland Area Arts Council will expand to display student art in all three galleries. This exhibit is supported by the Dennis Foley Memorial Sponsorship and Holland Friends of Art along with The National Endowment for the Arts and the Michigan Arts and Cultural Council. The exhibit is open from April 13-May 27.\n\nArmstrong Gallery\n\nThis collection represents approximately ten years of fun, whimsy and discovery. Using exclusively man-made objects found hither and yon in daily life and others bestowed by family members and friends, The materials are diverse and the methods of joining them are too. When at all possible the objects are used as they were found with few or no alterations. Basically it's my goal to obscure their use and change their meaning.\n\nArmstrong Gallery\n\nThis collection represents approximately ten years of fun, whimsy and discovery.

This monumental exhibition is a retrospective of the Glen, Michigan couple’s artistic creativity. In the gallery we present large scale 2-D watermedia works as well as sculpture. Linda and Lou Rizzolo have also been instructors, hosting a renowned annual workshop for artists. The Rizzolo exhibition is paired with a showing of the works of past workshop participants in the exhibit “Lights of inspiration” showing simultaneously in the Armstrong Gallery.\n\n“Linda and Lou’s highly individualistic art relationship, as husband and wife, is centered on inspiration and equality. The subtitle says it all, “dance of life ....fun of play”! Inspired by the mysteries of Lake Michigan, their unique personal aesthetics flourish through the love of God and energized by a loving, supportive, non-competitive relationship. The exhibition reflects artwork that is qualitatively rendered to achieve the most beautiful of form”, Linda and Lou.\n\nLievense Gallery\n\nReception: August 29th 6:00-7:00 pm\n\n“All the Feels” is an exhibit of the recent artwork from our Art for All program.\n\nArt for All, a unique art program for adults with mental and/or physical disabilities, began in 1985 as an opportunity for individuals in the community to experience the arts.\n\nToday the Art for All program is a year-round class taught once a week for an hour and a half. The present supervising instructor is Sandie Coffman. Student attendance varies from 13 to 20 each week. The cost is $20 per month, and scholarships are available from community sponsors. Art for All students are exposed to various art media including printmaking, weaving, clay sculpture, painting, and wood construction, as well as dance and movement 6-8:00 pm Mondays."
