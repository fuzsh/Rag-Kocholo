        "text": "Transcription is the first step in gene expression, and it begins with the stepwise assembly of general transcription factors (GTFs) and RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) to form the pre-initiation complex (PIC) at the promoters of genes (Matsui et al., 1980; Reinberg et al., 1987; Buratowski et al., 1989). First, the GTF TFIID, composed of the TATA-box binding protein (TBP) and 13–14 evolutionarily conserved TBP-associated factors (TAFs), binds onto gene promoters (Reinberg et al., 1987; Buratowski et al., 1989; Dynlacht et al., 1991; Cormack and Struhl, 1992; Tanese et al., 1991), which triggers the recruitment of TFIIA and TFIIB (Reinberg et al., 1987; Buratowski et al., 1989). Pol II is then loaded onto the promoter along with TFIIF (Reinberg et al., 1987; Buratowski et al., 1989; Buratowski et al., 1991). The binding of TFIIE and TFIIH completes the PIC, upon which the enzymatic activity of TFIIH unwinds DNA to form a transcription bubble, allowing for Pol II elongation and the incorporation of nucleotides into the nascent RNA (Reinberg et al., 1987; Buratowski et al., 1989; Rimel and Taatjes, 2018).\n\nDecades of research have revealed a central role for TBP in the transcription initiation process. TBP was first discovered to recognize and bind to the TATA-box (TATAAA consensus sequence) in gene promoters in vitro (Nakajima et al., 1988; Hoey et al., 1990; Buratowski et al., 1988), though subsequent studies show that TBP binds to active gene promoters in vivo regardless of the presence of a TATA sequence (Kim and Iyer, 2004; Pugh and Venters, 2016). Early studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing TBP mutations show that the loss of functional TBP led to decreased GTF and Pol II recruitment and transcription in vivo (Klages and Strubin, 1995; Kim et al., 1994). More recently, acute TBP depletion in yeast cells via the anchor-away system led to a rapid, genome-wide loss of Pol II and GTF occupancy (Petrenko et al., 2017; Petrenko et al., 2019). In addition to facilitating Pol II transcription, TBP is also involved in at least two other RNA polymerases found in eukaryotes, and conditional inactivation of TBP in yeast led to a global decrease in both RNA Pol I and III transcriptional activity (Cormack and Struhl, 1992; Kwon and Green, 1994; Schröder et al., 2003; Shen et al., 1998; White et al., 1992). In vitro experiments using purified proteins from yeast and human cells also confirm the role of TBP in the three main RNA polymerases (Goodrich and Tjian, 1994; Burley and Roeder, 1996). However, mouse embryos harboring a homozygous TBP knock-out, which were viable up to ~40 cell stage of embryogenesis, still displayed normal levels of Pol II transcription (Martianov et al., 2002). Furthermore, acute depletion of TBP in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) showed that global transcription levels remained unaffected (Teves et al., 2018), raising the question of how Pol II transcription occurs in the absence of TBP in these cases.\n\nSeveral potential mechanisms may facilitate TBP-free Pol II transcription. One, TBP may be required only for the initial round of activation, but ongoing transcription may no longer needed for TBP. The impairment of the reactivation of genes following mitosis when TBP is depleted (Teves et al., 2018) would support this mechanism. Two, metazoan-specific TBP paralogs could functionally replace TBP. In some species, TBP paralogs have been found to bind onto genomic loci distinct from TBP and regulate cell type-specific genes (Akhtar and Veenstra, 2009; Kedmi et al., 2014). Furthermore, TBP-related factors TRF1 and TRF2, first discovered in Drosophila, are also able to substitute for TBP in TATA transcriptional systems (Crowley et al., 1993; Hansen et al., 1997; Rabenstein et al., 1999; Holmes and Tjian, 2000). A third vertebrate-specific paralog, TRF3, mediates transcription of oocyte-specific genes through a non-canonical complex with TFIIA/TFIIB (Yu et al., 2020). Three, a TAF-containing complex could facilitate Pol II transcription without TBP. Indeed, several TAF complexes have been identified, including the TBP-free TAF-containing complex (TFTC) isolated from human cells that can support in vitro Pol II transcription without TBP or TFIID (Wieczorek et al., 1998). TFTC was subsequently shown to correspond to the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) complex, a conserved eukaryotic co-activator with histone acetyltransferase activity (Cheon et al., 2020), which has been shown to act somewhat redundantly with TFIID in yeast (Donczew et al., 2020).\n\nIn this study, we examined the role of TBP in transcription initiation in mESCs using an acute depletion system. We report that, inconsistent with a requirement for TBP in Pol II-dependent transcription, rapid depletion of TBP has no global effect on nascent RNA levels and Pol II chromatin occupancy. In contrast, tRNA transcription and Pol III chromatin occupancy are severely impaired upon depletion of TBP. We found that gene induction via the heat shock (HS) response and retinoic acid (RA)-mediated differentiation occurs normally upon TBP depletion. We also report that although the TBP paralog TRF2 binds to active gene promoters, it does not functionally replace TBP in Pol II transcription. Lastly, we show that the TFIID complex can form when TBP is depleted, although subunits have altered DNA occupancy. We find that TFIIA also has reduced binding when TBP is depleted. Taken together, these results point to a TBP-independent mechanism for Pol II transcription.\n\nIn this study, we took advantage of a drug-inducible degradation system to deplete TBP rapidly and examined the mechanistic role of TBP in Pol II transcription in mESCs. We found that TBP is largely not required for ongoing Pol II transcription. TBP is, however, required for transcription of tRNA genes by Pol III. We tested several possible mechanisms for TBP-independent Pol II transcription, and found that TBP is not required for gene induction, and that the TBP paralog TRF2 does not functionally replace TBP for Pol II transcription when TBP is depleted. Additionally, the TFIID complex still forms even when TBP is acutely depleted, but that its association with TFIIA is significantly decreased. Although TAF1 binding was unaffected, TAF4 and TFIIA occupancy levels decreased upon TBP depletion. Despite these changes, Pol II activity remains unaffected, suggesting a robustness in the Pol II machinery that compensates for TBP depletion.\n\nPrevious studies have examined the role of individual subunits of the TFIID complex in mammalian systems. For instance, knockdown of the TAF5 subunit in human ESCs led to reduced expression of the pluripotency genes (Pijnappel et al., 2013), and in mESCs, acute degradation of TAF12 led to a global decrease in gene expression (Sun et al., 2021). These studies are consistent with a more prominent role for TFIID. However, a major limitation inherent to the mAID system is the incomplete degradation of the protein, resulting in ~10–20% remaining TBP protein. A previous study has quantified the absolute number of TBP molecules in mESCs to 99,111±29,125 molecules (Cattoglio et al., 2019), suggesting ~10,000–20,000 remaining TBP molecules after depletion. From the Pol II CUT&Tag and NET-seq data, ~70% of Refseq TSSs have detectable signals, which results in ~27,185 active genes (from 38,837 total). Based on these numbers, even the highest estimated end of remaining TBP is insufficient to account for one molecule per active TSS. These numbers do not consider Pol II expression that occurs at enhancers or the ribosomal genes transcribed by Pol I. Furthermore, the TBP requirement for Pol III activity in mESCs provides confirmation that the acute TBP depletion system in mESCs has the expected consequences, and emphasizes the lack of effect on Pol II transcription when TBP is depleted. However, these results do not provide information on the functional role of TBP when recruited to Pol II promoters. One possibility is that Pol II transcription has evolved to have multiple redundancies such that removal of one factor (TBP) may not fully disrupt the whole system. Another possibility is that the transient nature of the embryonic cell state, with its unique chromatin landscape, enables Pol II transcription without TBP. Regardless, at the level of TBP depletion that we observe, we conclude that in mESCs Pol II transcription can occur independently of TBP.\n\nWe initially hypothesized that the TBP paralog TRF2 could functionally replace TBP in our depletion system. TRF2 is a more distant TBP paralog compared to the other paralogs, sharing only ~40% amino acid identity with the core domain of TBP (Dantonel et al., 1999). In Drosophila, TRF2 fails to bind to DNA that contains the canonical TATA box. Instead, TRF2 from various species such as Drosophila, worms, frogs, fish, and flies has been proposed to activate transcription for TATA-less promoters (Akhtar and Veenstra, 2011; Isogai et al., 2007). Previous studies have also shown that mouse TRF2 binds to active promoters in haploid testis cells along with TBP and TAF7l (Martianov et al., 2016), but the germline may have unique regulatory mechanisms. Our CUT&Tag results show that TRF2 binds to all active promoters in mESCs, and its level of binding correlates strongly to both TBP and Pol II (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C–D). One possible explanation for species-specific differences in TRF2 functions is the variability in the TRF2 core domain across species. Unlike TBP, whose core domain is over 80% conserved across species, the core domain of TRF2 only shares 40–45% amino acid conservation between metazoans (Akhtar and Veenstra, 2011; Dantonel et al., 2000). Although TRF2 has been historically seen to govern specific subsets of genes distinct from TBP, our results show that TRF2 in mESCs may have the potential to substitute for TBP during transcription initiation for mESCs Pol II-transcribed genes. It was thus surprising that depletion of TBP in the TRF2 knock-out mESCs had no global effect on Pol II transcription (Figure 4E, Figure 4—figure supplement 1E), suggesting that Pol II transcription in mESCs may not only be TBP-independent, but TBP family-independent.\n\nWe have shown that the full TFIID complex can form upon TBP depletion and that TFIID does not dissociate into smaller subcomplexes when TBP is depleted, suggesting a resiliency in the TFIID complex. Several studies point to a modular assembly for the full complex, which may allow for such resiliency. For instance, human TAF8 and TAF10 form as a heterodimer in the cytosol (Kamenova et al., 2019), with TAF2 joining the subcomplex to promote the nuclear import and incorporation into human TFIID (Kamenova et al., 2019; Soutoglou et al., 2005; Trowitzsch et al., 2015). Similarly, human TAF5, TAF6, and TAF9 have also been shown to form in the cytosol as a subcomplex to promote the incorporation of TAF9 into TFIID (Antonova et al., 2018). It is possible that the modular nature of the assembly of TFIID allows for a robust structure even when TBP molecules are severely limiting. Furthermore, TAF7 has been shown to dissociate from the rest of TFIID after transcription initiation and acts as a regulator of RNA translation by binding onto RNAs and delivering them to polysomes for translation in the cytosol (Gegonne et al., 2006; Cheng et al., 2021). This finding suggests a more dynamic TFIID complex with subunits associating and dissociating in flux, which may allow for built-in redundancy and robustness when a subunit is missing. Such a dynamic TFIID complex would also be consistent with the different effect on TAF1 and TAF4 DNA-binding profiles when TBP is depleted, especially if the absence of TBP leads to changes in TAF-DNA residence times. In contrast, TBP in Pol III initiation forms the TFIIIB complex with only two other factors: Brf2 and Bdp1 (Gouge et al., 2017). It is intriguing to speculate that the greater number of TAFs in TFIID (13 or more) might allow for more redundancy than the two other subunits of TFIIIB, providing a potential mechanism to the observed requirement for TBP in Pol III but not for Pol II transcription.\n\nPrevious studies have identified the presence of other non-canonical initiation complexes, suggesting a high level of robustness in the machinery to accommodate Pol II transcription. For example, TAF paralogs are often expressed and used in a cell type-specific manner (Freiman, 2009), including TAF4b in oocytes and TAF9b in motor neuron differentiation (Herrera et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2011; Freiman et al., 2001; Pointud et al., 2003). In Xenopus embryos, knockdown of TBP and the two paralogs showed recruitment of Pol II to the promoter and active transcription for a subset of genes (Gazdag et al., 2016). In yeast, transcription activation can occur in the absence of TFIIA, and in vitro TFIIA was shown not to be needed for basal transcription (Chou et al., 1999; Sayre et al., 1992). Additionally, gel mobility-shift analysis and fractionated cross-substitution experiments using Drosophila and HeLa systems showed that TFIIA was not required for complexes to be transcriptionally competent (Tyree et al., 1993; Wampler et al., 1990). Our results provide additional evidence on the robustness of the Pol II machinery. Despite the changes in DNA binding of TAF4 and TFIIA when TBP is depleted, Pol II transcription remains unaffected. Perhaps in the same way that TFIID could behave as a dynamic complex, the entire PIC may also function as a dynamic hub instead of acting as a monolithic complex. Previous studies using single molecule imaging and tracking provide support for this concept. For example, the average residence time of TBP is on the order of minutes whereas TFIIB is on the order of seconds (Teves et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2016). Such a dynamic system may provide sufficient robustness to facilitate Pol II transcription when TBP is depleted."
