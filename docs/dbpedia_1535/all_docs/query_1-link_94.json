        "text": "About the Journal\n\nArchive of Mechanical Engineering is an international journal publishing works of wide significance, originality and relevance in most branches of mechanical engineering. The journal is peer-reviewed and is published both in electronic and printed form. Archive of Mechanical Engineering publishes original papers which have not been previously published in other journal, and are not being prepared for publication elsewhere. The publisher will not be held legally responsible should there be any claims for compensation. The journal accepts papers in English.\n\nArchive of Mechanical Engineering is an Open Access journal. The journal does not have article processing charges (APCs) nor article submission charges.\n\nOutline of procedures\n\nTo ensure that high scientific standards are met, the editorial office of Archive of Mechanical Engineering implements anti-ghost writing and guest authorship policy. Ghostwriting and guest authorship are indication of scientific dishonesty and all cases will be exposed: editorial office will inform adequate institutions (employers, scientific societies, scientific editors associations, etc.).\n\nTo maintain high quality of published papers, the editorial office of Archive of Mechanical Engineering applies reviewing procedure. Each manuscript undergoes crosscheck plagiarism screening. Each manuscript is reviewed by at least two independent reviewers.\n\nBefore publication of the paper, authors are obliged to send scanned copies of the signed originals of the declaration concerning ghostwriting, guest authorship and authors contribution and of the Open Access license.\n\nSubmission of manuscripts\n\nThe manuscripts must be written in one of the following formats:\n\nTeX, LaTeX, AMSTeX, AMSLaTeX (recommended),\n\nMS Word, either as standard DOCUMENT (.doc, .docx) or RICH TEXT FORMAT (.rtf).\n\nAll submissions to the AME should be made electronically via Editorial System – an online submission and peer review system at https://www.editorialsystem.com/ame. First-time users must create an Author’s account to obtain a user ID and password required to enter the system. All manuscripts receive individual identification codes that should be used in any correspondence with regard to the publication process. For the authors already registered in Editorial System it is enough to enter their username and password to log in as an author. The corresponding author should be identified while submitting a paper – personal e-mail address and postal address of the corresponding author are required. Please note that the manuscript should be prepared using our LaTeX or Word template and uploaded as a PDF file.\n\nIf you experience difficulties with the manuscript submission website, please contact the Assistant to the Editor of the AME (ame.eo@meil.pw.edu.pl).\n\nAll authors of the manuscript are responsible for its content; they must have agreed to its publication and have given the corresponding author the authority to act on their behalf in all matters pertaining to publication. The corresponding author is responsible for informing the co-authors of the manuscript status throughout the submission, review, and production process.\n\nLength and arrangement\n\nPapers (including tables and figures) should not exceed in length 25 pages of size 12.6 cm x 19.5 cm (printing area) with a font size of 11 pt. For manuscript preparation, the Authors should use the templates for Word or LaTeX available at the journal webpage. Please notice that the final layout of the article will be prepared by the journal's technical staff in LaTeX. Articles should be organized into the following sections:\n\nList of keywords (separated by commas),\n\nFull Name(s) of Author(s), Affiliation(s), Corresponding Author e-mail address,\n\nTitle,\n\nAbstract,\n\nMain text,\n\nAppendix,\n\nAcknowledgments (if applicable),\n\nReferences.\n\nAffiliations should include department, university, city and country. ORCID identifiers of all Authors should be added.\n\nWe suggest the title should be as short as possible but still informative.\n\nAn abstract should accompany every article. It should be a brief summary of significant results of the paper and give concise information about the content of the core idea of the paper. It should be informative and not only present the general scope of the paper, but also indicate the main results and conclusions. An abstract should not exceed 200 words.\n\nPlease follow the general rules for writing the main text of the paper:\n\nuse simple and declarative sentences, avoid long sentences, in which the meaning may be lost by complicated construction,\n\ndivide the main text into sections and subsections (if needed the subsections may be divided into paragraphs),\n\nbe concise, avoid idle words,\n\nmake your argumentation complete; use commonly understood terms; define all nonstandard symbols and abbreviations when you introduce them;\n\nexplain all acronyms and abbreviations when they first appear in the text;\n\nuse all units consistently throughout the article;\n\nbe self-critical as you review your drafts.\n\nThe authors are advised to use the SI system of units.\n\nArtwork/Equations/Tables\n\nYou may use line diagrams and photographs to illustrate theses from your text. The figures should be clear, easy to read and of good quality (300 dpi). The figures are preferred in a vector format (bitmap formats are acceptable, but not recommended). The size of the figures should be adequate to their contents. Use 8-9pt font size of the text within the figures.\n\nYou should use tables only to improve conciseness or where the information cannot be given satisfactorily in other ways. Tables should be numbered consecutively and referred to within the text by numbers. Each table should have an explanatory caption which should be as concise as possible. The figures and tables should be inserted in the text file, where they are mentioned.\n\nDisplayed equations should be numbered consecutively using Arabic numbers in parentheses. They should be centered, leaving a small space above and below to separate it from the surrounding text.\n\nFootnotes/Endnotes/Acknowledgements\n\nWe encourage authors to restrict the use of footnotes. Information concerning research grant support should appear in a separate Acknowledgements section at the end of the paper. Acknowledgements of the assistance of colleagues or similar notes of appreciation should also appear in the Acknowledgements section.\n\nReferences\n\nReferences should be numbered and listed in the order that they appear in the text. References indicated by numerals in square brackets should complete the paper in the following style:\n\nBooks:\n\n[1] R.O. Author. Title of the Book in Italics. Publisher, City, 2018.\n\nArticles in Journals:\n\n[2] D.F. Author, B.D. Second Author, and P.C. Third Author. Title of the article. Full Name of the Journal in Italics, 52(4):89–96, 2017. doi: 1234565/3554. (where means: 52 – volume; 4 – number or issue; 89–96 – pages, and 1234565/3554 – doi number (if exists).)\n\nTheses:\n\n[3] W. Author. Title of the thesis. Ph.D. Thesis, University, City, Country, 2010.\n\nConference Proceedings:\n\n[4] H. Author. Title of the paper. In Proc. Conference Name in Italics, pages 001–005, Conference Place, 10-15 Jan. 2015. doi: 98765432/7654vd.\n\nEnglish language\n\nArchive of Mechanical Engineering is published in English. Make sure that your manuscript is clearly and grammatically written. The content should be understandable and should not cause any confusion to the readers, including the reviewers. After accepting the manuscript for a publication in the AME, we offer a free language check service, for correcting small language mistakes.\n\nSubmission of Revised Articles\n\nWhen revision of a manuscript is requested, authors are expected to deliver the revised version of the manuscript as soon as possible. The manuscript should be uploaded directly to the Editorial System as an answer to the Editor's decision, and not as a new manuscript. If it is the 1st revision, the authors are expected to return revised manuscript within 60 days; if it is the 2nd revision, the authors are expected to return revised manuscript within 14 days. Additional time for resubmission must be requested in advance. If the above mentioned deadlines are not met, the manuscript may be treated as a new submission.\n\nOutline of the Production Process\n\nOnce an article has been accepted for publication, the manuscript is transferred into our production system to be language-edited and formatted. Language/technical editors reserve the privilege of editing manuscripts to conform with the stylistic conventions of the journal. Once the article has been typeset, PDF proofs are generated so that authors can approve all editing and layout.\n\nProofreading\n\nProofreading should be carried out once a final draft has been produced. Since the proofreading stage is the last opportunity to correct the article to be published, the authors are requested to make every effort to check for errors in their proofs before the paper is posted online. Authors may be asked to address remarks and queries from the language and/or technical editors. Queries are written only to request necessary information or clarification of an unclear passage. Please note that language/technical editors do not query at every instance where a change has been made. It is the author's responsibility to read the entire text, tables, and figure legends, not just items queried. Major alterations made will always be submitted to the authors for approval. The corresponding author receives e-mail notification when a PDF is available and should return the comments within 3 days of receipt. Comments must be uploaded to Editorial System."
