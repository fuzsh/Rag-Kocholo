        "text": "Wedding photography can be one of the more daunting genres. For many people, their wedding day is one of the most important days of their lives. As photographers, it's crucial to capture these moments carefully and as best we can. This is especially important when it comes to the bride.\n\nWedding photography and bridal photography present a number of unique challenges. Although there is a need to take candid shots of the couple and guests, taking the time to properly pose and stage some of the photos can sometimes make all of the difference. As with most things, preparation is key and having a plan is crucial.\n\nIn a recent video, Katelyn James discusses some of the things to be aware of while photographing a bride on the wedding day. In the video linked above, James offers a detailed explanation of how to photograph the bride getting into her wedding dress. One of the key points James covers is how to take a full-length portrait of the bride in her wedding dress. Lighting is, of course, one of the key factors to consider before taking the shot.\n\nInterestingly, James recommends natural lighting more so than using flash in these specific scenarios. The main benefit of using natural light when photographing the bride is that you can work faster and not be weighed down with lots of gear. The alternative would be to set up a number of lights; however, in many cases, this is simply not convenient.\n\nJames continues with other points, including the type of gear that can be really helpful while photographing the bride on her wedding day. Check out the full video linked above to see these tips along with detailed examples."
