        "text": "Computerized Tomography-Guided Paracentesis: An Effective Alternative to Bedside Paracentesis?\n\nPubMed\n\nGaduputi, Vinaya; Tariq, Hassan; Chandrala, Chaitanya; Sakam, Sailaja; Abbas, Naeem; Chilimuri, Sridhar\n\n2017-02-01\n\nAscites remains the most common cause of hospitalization among patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Paracentesis is a relatively safe procedure with low complication rates. Computerized tomography (CT)-guided therapeutic paracentesis could be a safe and effective alternative to unaided or aided (ultrasonogram-guided) bedside paracentesis. In this retrospective study, we aimed to compare the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of CT-guided paracentesis with bedside paracentesis. The period of study was from 2002 to 2012. All patients with cirrhosis who underwent therapeutic paracentesis were included in the study. These patients were divided into two groups. Group I consisted of patients who underwent CT-guided pigtail catheter insertion with ascitic fluid drainage. Group II consisted of patients who underwent beside therapeutic paracentesis after localization of fluid either by physical examination or sonographic localization. We measured the efficacy of CT-guided paracentesis and bedside paracentesis in terms of volume of fluid removed, length of stay, discharge doses of diuretics (spironolactone and furosemide) and number of days to readmission for symptomatic ascites. We also computed the cost-effectiveness of CT-guided therapeutic paracentesis when compared to a bedside procedure. Fischer exact test was used to analyze the distribution of categorical data and unpaired t -test was used for comparison of means. There were a total of 546 unique patients with diagnosed cirrhosis who were admitted to the hospital with symptomatic ascites and underwent therapeutic paracentesis. Two hundred and forty-seven patients underwent CT-guided paracentesis, while 272 patients underwent bedside paracentesis. There was significant inverse correlation between the amount of ascitic fluid removed and total length of stay in the hospital. We found that the volume of fluid removed via a CT-guided pigtail insertion and drainage (2.72 Â± 2.02 L) is significantly higher when\n\nAbdominal paracentesis and thoracocentesis.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Ser Yee; Pormento, James G; Koong, Heng Nung\n\n2009-04-01\n\nAbdominal paracentesis and thoracocentesis are common bedside procedures with diagnostic, therapeutic and palliative roles. We describe a useful and familiar a useful and familiar technique with the use of a multiple lumen catheter commonly used for central venous line insertion for drainage of ascites or moderate to large pleural effusions. The use of a multiple lumen catheter allows easier and more rapid aspiration of fluid with a smaller probability of the side holes being blocked as compared to the standard needle or single catheter methods. This is particularly useful in situations where the dedicated commercial kits for thoracocentesis and abdominal paracentesis are not readily available.\n\nPocket ultrasound device as a complement to physical examination for ascites evaluation and guided paracentesis.\n\nPubMed\n\nKeil-RÃ­os, Daniel; Terrazas-SolÃ­s, Hiram; GonzÃ¡lez-Garay, Alejandro; SÃ¡nchez-Ãvila, Juan Francisco; GarcÃ­a-JuÃ¡rez, Ignacio\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe pocket ultrasound device (PUD) is a new tool that may be of use in the early detection of ascites. Abdominal ultrasound-guided paracentesis has been reported to decrease the rate of complications due to the procedure, but must be performed in a healthcare setting; this new tool may be a useful on an ambulatory basis. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic usefulness of the PUD in the diagnosis of ascites and the safety of guided paracentesis. We conducted a retrospective study that included adult patients suspected of having ascites and in whom an evaluation was performed with the PUD to identify it. Concordance with abdominal ultrasound (AUS) was determined with the Kappa coefficient. Sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp) and likelihood ratios (LR) were determined and compared with physical examination, AUS, computed tomography and procurement of fluid by paracentesis. Complications resulting from the guided paracentesis were analyzed. 89 participants were included and 40 underwent a paracentesis. The PUD for ascites detection had 95.8 % Se, 81.8 % Sp, 5.27 +LR and 0.05 -LR. It had a concordance with AUS of 0.781 (p < 0.001). Technical problems during the guided paracentesis were present in only two participants (5 %) and three patients (7.5 %) developed minor complications that required no further intervention. There were no severe complications or deaths. This study suggests that the PUD is a reliable tool for ascites detection as a complement to physical examination and appears to be a safe method to perform guided paracentesis.\n\nColloids Versus Albumin in Large Volume Paracentesis to Prevent Circulatory Dysfunction: Evidence-based Case Report.\n\nPubMed\n\nWidjaja, Felix F; Khairan, Paramita; Kamelia, Telly; Hasan, Irsan\n\n2016-04-01\n\nLarge volume paracentesis may cause paracentesis induced circulatory dysfunction (PICD). Albumin is recommended to prevent this abnormality. Meanwhile, the price of albumin is too expensive and there should be another alternative that may prevent PICD. This report aimed to compare albumin to colloids in preventing PICD. Search strategy was done using PubMed, Scopus, Proquest, dan Academic Health Complete from EBSCO with keywords of \"ascites\", \"albumin\", \"colloid\", \"dextran\", \"hydroxyethyl starch\", \"gelatin\", and \"paracentesis induced circulatory dysfunction\". Articles was limited to randomized clinical trial and meta-analysis with clinical question of \"In hepatic cirrhotic patient undergone large volume paracentesis, whether colloids were similar to albumin to prevent PICD\". We found one meta-analysis and four randomized clinical trials (RCT). A meta analysis showed that albumin was still superior of which odds ratio 0.34 (0.23-0.51). Three RCTs showed the same results and one RCT showed albumin was not superior than colloids. We conclude that colloids could not constitute albumin to prevent PICD, but colloids still have a role in patient who undergone paracentesis less than five liters.\n\nEvaluation of hospital complications and costs associated with using ultrasound guidance during abdominal paracentesis procedures.\n\nPubMed\n\nPatel, Pankaj A; Ernst, Frank R; Gunnarsson, Candace L\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAbdominal paracentesis is commonly performed for diagnostic, therapeutic, and palliative indications, but the use of ultrasound guidance for these procedures is relatively recent, variable, and not well documented. A retrospective database analysis of abdominal paracentesis procedures was performed to determine whether ultrasound guidance was associated with differences in adverse events (AEs) or hospital costs, compared to procedures without ultrasound guidance. The hospital database maintained by Premier was used to identify patients with abdominal paracentesis International Classification of Diseases - 9th Revision - Clinical Modification (ICD-9 code 54.9, Common Procedural Terminology CPT-4 codes 49080, 49081) in 2008. Use of ultrasound guidance was determined via patient billing data. The incidence of selected AEs and patients' hospitalization costs were calculated for two groups: procedures with ultrasound guidance and those without. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to evaluate differences between groups. This study identified 1297 abdominal paracentesis procedures, 723 (56%) with ultrasound and 574 (44%) without. The indications for paracentesis were similar between the two groups. The incidence of AEs was lower in ultrasound-guided procedures: all AEs (1.4% vs 4.7%, pâ=â0.01), post-paracentesis infection (0.41% vs 2.44%, pâ=â0.01), hematoma (0.0% vs 0.87%, pâ=â0.01), and seroma (0.14% vs 1.05%, pâ=â0.03). Analyses adjusted for patient and hospital covariates revealed significant reductions in AEs (ORâ=â0.349, 95% CIâ=â0.165, 0.739, pâ=â0.0059) and hospitalization costs ($8761âÂ±â$5956 vs $9848âÂ±â$6581, pâ<â0.001) for procedures with ultrasound guidance vs those without. There are several limitations to using claims data for clinical analyses; causality cannot be determined, the possibility of miscoded or missing data, and the inability to control for elements not captured in claims data that may\n\nAnterior chamber paracentesis to improve diagnosis and treatment of infectious uveitis in South Africa.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchaftenaar, Erik; Lecuona, Karin; Baarsma, Seerp; Meenken, Christina; Verjans, Georges; McIntyre, James; Peters, Remco\n\n2015-09-22\n\nInfectious uveitis is a significant cause of blindness in South Africa, especially among HIV-infected individuals. The visual outcome of uveitis depends on early clinical and laboratory diagnosis to guide therapeutic intervention. Analyses of aqueous humor, obtained by anterior chamber paracentesis, directs the differential diagnosis in infectious uveitis. However, although safe and potentially cost-effective, diagnostic anterior chamber paracentesis is not common practice in ophthalmic care across Africa. We seek to draw attention to this important procedure that could improve the diagnosis and prognosis of infectious uveitis.\n\nUmbilical paracentesis for incarcerated umbilical hernia in patients with end-stage liver disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlonso, S; Donat, M; Carrion, L; Rodriguez, J M; Diego, L; Acin, D; Serrano, A; Perez, E; Pereira, F\n\n2016-08-01\n\nPatients withÂ cirrhosis and ascites are prone to abdominal wall complications largely predominate by umbilical hernia. Elective surgery is indicated in select patients but a high morbidity and mortality rate occurs if it is performed in emergency conditions. We present a clinical case of a patient with advanced alcoholic liver disease who came to the emergency room for an acutely incarcerated umbilical hernia. Due to the high surgical risk, we had to discuss other treatment options. The use of umbilical paracentesis for incarcerated hernia reduction in cirrhotic patients with tense ascites is a safe and reproducible technique. Umbilical paracentesis could be considered as an alternative to emergency surgery in these high-risk patients.\n\nFetal stomach paracentesis in combined duodenal and esophageal atresia.\n\nPubMed\n\nKadohira, Ikuko; Miyakoshi, Kei; Shimojima, Naoki; Matsumoto, Tadashi; Minegishi, Kazuhiro; Tanaka, Mamoru; Kuroda, Tatsuo; Yoshimura, Yasunori\n\n2014-07-01\n\nFetuses with concomitant duodenal atresia (DA) and esophageal atresia (EA) might develop in utero gastric rupture as well as neonatal respiratory complication due to dilated stomach and duodenum. Our patient with the typical \"double bubble\" appearance was highly suspected to have DA in the second trimester. Follow-up examinations revealed a massively dilated stomach and duodenum with a dilated distal esophagus, indicating concomitant DA and EA. With advancing pregnancy, the fetal abdomen progressively increased in size by retention of fluid in the closed loop of DA and EA. To avoid gastric perforation, prenatal stomach paracentesis using an ultrasound-guided needle was performed three times until delivery. A male neonate born at 37Â weeks gestation showed no respiratory complication. Perinatal clinical features and operative findings revealed combined DA and EA (gross type A). He was successfully managed with duodenoduodenostomy, followed by esophago-esophagostomy. On fetal sonography, the marked \"double bubble\" appearance and the cystic structure presenting peristalsis-like movement above the diaphragm were indicative of concomitant DA and EA. Fetal stomach paracentesis could contribute to the improvement of perinatal outcomes in fetuses with this pathological condition.\n\nAlbumin reduces paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction and reduces death and renal impairment among patients with cirrhosis and infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nKwok, Chun Shing; Krupa, Lukasz; Mahtani, Ash; Kaye, Duncan; Rushbrook, Simon M; Phillips, Martin G; Gelson, William\n\n2013-01-01\n\nStudies have suggested that albumin has a value in cirrhotic patients undergoing paracentesis but its value in infection and sepsis is less clear. We planned to perform a meta-analysis of the risk of adverse outcomes in cirrhotic patients with and without albumin use. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE in January 2013 for randomized studies of cirrhotic patients that reported the risk of adverse events and mortality with albumin and no albumin exposure. We performed random effects meta-analysis and assessed heterogeneity using the IÂ² statistic. Our review included 16 studies covering 1,518 patients. The use of albumin in paracentesis was associated with significantly reduced risk of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (OR 0.26 95%, CI 0.08-0.93) and there was a nonsignificant difference in death, encephalopathy, hyponatraemia, readmission, and renal impairment. Compared to the other volume expanders, albumin use showed no difference in clinical outcomes. In cirrhotic patients with any infection, there was a significant reduction in mortality (OR 0.46 95%, CI 0.25-0.86) and renal impairment (OR 0.34 95%, CI 0.15-0.75) when albumin was used. The use of albumin in cirrhotic patients is valuable in patients with any infection and it reduces the risk of circulatory dysfunction among patients undergoing paracentesis.\n\nHarlequin color change after abdominal paracentesis in a newborn with neonatal hemochromatosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nCizmeci, Mehmet N; Alagoz, Demet; Avsar, Mehmet I; Alis, Gulten; Tutanc, Murat\n\n2014-01-01\n\nHarlequin color change is a distinctive cutaneous phenomenon presenting as a well-demarcated color change, with half of the body displaying erythema and the other half pallor. Only a few cases have been reported, possibly because of under-recognition. Recognition of this benign, self-limited condition may enable physicians to avoid unnecessary interventions. Herein we describe a neonate with nonimmune hydrops fetalis due to neonatal hemochromatosis who developed Harlequin color change after abdominal paracentesis.

Both patients became symptomatic within 48 hours after the LVP. Although being rare, given the significantly higher mortality rate of cirrhotic patients undergoing emergent herniorrhaphy, this complication of LVP is potentially serious. Therefore, it is recommended that patients be examined closely for the presence of umbilical hernias before removal of ascitic fluid and an attempt should be made for external reduction of easily reducible hernias, if a hernia is present.\n\nIncarceration of umbilical hernia: a rare complication of large volume paracentesis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKhodarahmi, Iman; Shahid, Muhammad Usman; Contractor, Sohail\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe present two cases of umbilical hernia incarceration following large volume paracentesis (LVP) in patients with cirrhotic ascites.

Physiopathological mechanisms of ascites formation are complex and have yet to be fully elucidated. In most cases, ascites is due to peritoneal carcinomatosis in which vascular permeability is enhanced by VEGF production while lymphatic drainage decreases. Ascites can also be secondary to portal hypertension, for example in case of multiple liver metastases, or due to lymphatic obstruction. While paracentesis and diuretics are commonly used, their efficiency has never been compared in a randomized controlled study. Paracentesis brings immediate but temporary relief in over 90% of cases, and implies multiple hospitalizations. Literature reports ascites control by aldosterone alone or in association with furosemide. But, available data is controversial, and there is no predictive factor to identify patients that respond to diuretic treatment. The indication of diuretic treatment is left to the appreciation of physicians. Existing recommendations are old, and practices influenced by results obtained in non-neoplastic ascites. Additional evidences are required before guidelines can be established for the palliative management of malignant ascites. Copyright Â© 2015 SociÃ©tÃ© FranÃ§aise du Cancer.

Studies have suggested that albumin has a value in cirrhotic patients undergoing paracentesis but its value in infection and sepsis is less clear. We planned to perform a meta-analysis of the risk of adverse outcomes in cirrhotic patients with and without albumin use. Methods. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE in January 2013 for randomized studies of cirrhotic patients that reported the risk of adverse events and mortality with albumin and no albumin exposure. We performed random effects meta-analysis and assessed heterogeneity using the I2 statistic. Results. Our review included 16 studies covering 1,518 patients. The use of albumin in paracentesis was associated with significantly reduced risk of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (OR 0.26 95%, CI 0.08â0.93) and there was a nonsignificant difference in death, encephalopathy, hyponatraemia, readmission, and renal impairment. Compared to the other volume expanders, albumin use showed no difference in clinical outcomes. In cirrhotic patients with any infection, there was a significant reduction in mortality (OR 0.46 95%, CI 0.25â0.86) and renal impairment (OR 0.34 95%, CI 0.15â0.75) when albumin was used.

Recurrent large-volume paracentesis is the current standard of care; however, it results in circulatory dysfunction and renal dysfunction, and hospitalization is commonly required. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement is not an option in a substantial number of patients because of contraindications. The placement of a tunneled peritoneal drainage catheter has been shown to be effective in patients with malignant ascites. However, data in patients with nonmalignant refractory ascites are rare. We followed 24 consecutive patients in whom tunneled peritoneal drainage catheters were placed in the Endoscopy Unit at Hannover Medical School between June 2013 and December 2014. Catheters were placed in 24 patients with refractory ascites in end-stage liver disease and with a contraindication to transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement. Placement was technically successful in all patients. The dosage of diuretics could be reduced significantly. The number of paracentesis decreased from 2.2Â±1 to 0 per week, although the volume of daily ascites removal remained stable (2âl). Despite frequent drainage of ascites, kidney function, serum sodium, and serum albumin remained stable. Seven adverse events occurred in six (25%) patients. Five patients listed for liver transplantation underwent successful transplantation without a negative impact. The tunneled peritoneal drainage catheter placement is a viable and effective treatment alternative in patients with refractory ascites because of end-stage liver disease, reducing diuretic intake and the need for paracentesis. The procedure avoids hyponatremia, worsening kidney function, and albumin infusions without an increased risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.\n\nPreservation of nutritional-status in patients with refractory ascites due to hepatic cirrhosis who are undergoing repeated paracentesis.\n\nPubMed\n\nSorrentino, Paolo; Castaldo, Giuseppe; Tarantino, Luciano; Bracigliano, Alessandra; Perrella, Alessandro; Perrella, Oreste; Fiorentino, Francesco; Vecchione, Raffaela; D' Angelo, Salvatore\n\n2012-04-01\n\nRefractory ascites in liver-cirrhosis is associated with a poor prognosis. We performed a prospective study to investigate whether aggressive nutritional-support could improve outcomes in cirrhotic patients. Cirrhotic patients undergoing serial large-volume paracentesis for refractory-ascites were enrolled and randomized into three groups. Group A received post-paracentesis intravenous nutritional-support in addition to a balanced oral diet and a late-evening protein snack, group B received the same oral nutritional-protocol as the first group but without parenteral support, and group C (the control group) received a low-sodium or sodium-free diet. Clinical, anthropometric and laboratory nutritional parameters and biochemical tests of liver and renal function were reported for 12 months of follow-up. We enrolled 120 patients, who were randomized into three groups of equal size. Patients on the nutritional-protocol showed better preservation of clinical, anthropometric and laboratory nutritional parameters that were associated with decreased deterioration of liver function compared with patients on the low-sodium or sodium-free diet (group C). Groups A and B had lower morbidity and mortality rates than the control group (C). Mortality rates were significantly better in patients who were treated with parenteral-nutritional-support than for the other two groups. In patients who were on the nutritional-protocol, there was a reduction in the requirement of taps for the treatment of refractory ascites. Post-paracentesis parenteral-nutritional-support with a balanced oral diet and an evening protein snack appears to be the best care protocol for patients with liver-cirrhosis that has been complicated by refractory-ascites.

Air was injected into the donor corneas from the endothelial side and pattern was noted. Four different scenarios were created, namely (a) air injection into the deep stroma (n=11), (b) air injection into the superficial stroma (n=3), (c) air injection into the deep stroma after making a peripheral incision internal to the trabecular meshwork region that simulated an anteriorly placed paracentesis incision, with the site of air injection within a clock hour of the peripheral incision (n=7) and (d) air injection into the deep stroma after making a peripheral incision, the site of air injection being 180Â° away from the peripheral incision site (n=3). Air injection at deep posterior stroma resulted in the formation of type-1 and type-2 bubbles, type 2 began from the periphery and followed the type-1 bubble pattern in majority of the donor corneas. The type-1 pattern was noted as a bubble in the central part of the donor disc that did not reach the peripheral extent of the cornea. The type-2 pattern was a bubble that started at the peripheral cornea and expanded but was limited by the limbus circumferentially. With a full-thickness peripheral incision and air injection in the same clock hour of the incision, only a type-1 bubble pattern was noted with air leakage from the site of the incision. The results of the study corroborate with the clinical observations made during deep lamellar keratoplasty (DLK). The placement of the paracentesis has a bearing on the pattern of the air bubble and can be used to an advantage during DLK surgery. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

After inspecting the current evidence behind this recommendation, we decided to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to address the effect of albumin on mortality and morbidity in the context of large volume paracentesis. We performed a comprehensive search of large databases and abstract books of conference proceedings up to March 15th 2016 for randomized controlled trials, testing the infusion of human albumin against alternatives (vs no treatment, vs plasma expanders; vs vasoconstrictors) in HCC-free patients suffering from cirrhosis. We analyzed these trials with regard to mortality, changes in plasma renin activity (PRA), hyponatremia, renal impairment, recurrence of ascites with consequential re-admission into hospital and additional complications. We employed trial sequential analysis in order to calculate the number of patients required in controlled trials to be able to determine a statistically significant advantage of the administration of one agent over another with regard to mortality. We were able to include 21 trials totaling 1277 patients. While the administration of albumin prevents a rise in PRA as well as hyponatremia, no improvement in strong clinical endpoints such as mortality could be demonstrated. Trial sequential analysis showed that at least 1550 additional patients need to be recruited into RCTs and analyzed with regard to this question in order to detect or disprove a 25% mortality effect. There is insufficient evidence that the infusion of albumin after LVP significantly lowers mortality in HCC-free patients with advanced liver disease.

Treatment alternatives to albumin, such as artificial colloids and vasoconstrictors, have been widely investigated. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine whether morbidity and mortality differ between patients receiving albumin versus alternative treatments. The meta-analysis included randomized trials evaluating albumin infusion in patients with tense ascites. Primary endpoints were postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction, hyponatremia, and mortality. Eligible trials were sought by multiple methods, including computer searches of bibliographic and abstract databases and the Cochrane Library. Results were quantitatively combined under a fixed-effects model. Seventeen trials with 1,225 total patients were included. There was no evidence of heterogeneity or publication bias. Compared with alternative treatments, albumin reduced the incidence of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction (odds ratio [OR], 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27-0.55). Significant reductions in that complication by albumin were also shown in subgroup analyses versus each of the other volume expanders tested (e.g., dextran, gelatin, hydroxyethyl starch, and hypertonic saline). The occurrence of hyponatremia was also decreased by albumin, compared with alternative treatments (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39-0.87). In addition, mortality was lower in patients receiving albumin than alternative treatments (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.41-0.98). This meta-analysis provides evidence that albumin reduces morbidity and mortality among patients with tense ascites undergoing large-volume paracentesis, as compared with alternative treatments investigated thus far.

METHODS: The EUS database and electronic medical records at Fukushima Medical University Hospital were searched from January 2001 to April 2011. Patients with a history of cancer and who underwent EUS-P using an automated spring-loaded needle device with a 22-gauge puncture needle were included. The needle was passed through the instrument channel and advanced through the gastrointestinal wall under EUS guidance into the echo-free space in the abdominal cavity and ascitic fluid was collected. The confirmed diagnosis of malignant ascites included positive cytology and results from careful clinical observation for at least 6 mo in patients with negative cytology. The technical success rate, cytology results and complications were evaluated. RESULTS: We found 11 patients who underwent EUS-P with an automated spring-loaded needle device. In 4 cases, ascites was revealed only with EUS but not in other imaging modalities. EUS-P was done in 7 other cases because there was minimal ascitic fluid and no safe window for percutaneous abdominal aspiration. Ascitic fluid was obtained in all cases by EUS-P. The average amount aspirated was 14.1 mL (range 0.5-38 mL) and that was sent for cytological exam. The etiology of ascitic fluid was benign in 5 patients and malignant in 6. In all cases, ascitic fluid was obtained with the first needle pass. No procedure-related adverse effects occurred. CONCLUSION: EUS-P with an automated spring-loaded needle device is a feasible and safe method for ascites evaluation.

Wall suction has been adopted as the preferred method of drainage at many centers, though the safety and benefits of this technique have not been formally evaluated. The primary objective of this study was to define the cost and time savings of wall suction over the traditional glass vacuum bottle method for ascites drainage. The secondary objective was to compare the safety profile and patient satisfaction using these two techniques. We conducted a randomized, controlled pilot study of the wall suction versus vacuum bottle methods for LVP in hospitalized patients. All LVPs were performed under ultrasound guidance by a single proceduralist. Patients with at least 4 liters removed received 25% intravenous albumin, 8 g/liter fluid removed. Demographic, clinical characteristics, and procedure details were recorded. Laboratory and hemodynamic data were recorded for 24 h prior to and 24-48 h post LVP. An electronic chart review was conducted to evaluate procedure-related complications. Data were compared using Fisher's exact test, t test, or Mann-Whitney U test. Thirty-four patients were randomized to wall suction at 200 mmHg (n = 17) or glass vacuum bottle drainage (n = 17). Wall suction was significantly faster and less costly than vacuum bottle drainage (7 versus 15 min, p = 0.002; $4.59 versus $12.73, p < 0.001). There were no differences in outcomes at 24 and 48 h post LVP, or at 60-day follow up. Performing LVP using wall suction resulted in significantly shorter procedure time and supply cost savings. There were no differences in outcomes between the groups, suggesting equivalent safety, though larger studies powered to detect small differences are needed. Given its efficiency, convenience, and cost effectiveness, wall suction may be a superior method of ascites drainage for LVP.\n\nPredictors of Percutaneous Catheter Drainage (PCD) after Abdominal Paracentesis Drainage (APD) in Patients with Moderately Severe or Severe Acute Pancreatitis along with Fluid Collections\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLiu, Wei-hui; Wang, Tao; Yan, Hong-tao; Chen, Tao; Xu, Chuan; Ye, Ping; Zhang, Ning; Liu, Zheng-cai; Tang, Li-jun\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAims Although we previously demonstrated abdominal paracentesis drainage (APD) preceding percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) as the central step for treating patients with moderately severe (MSAP) or severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), the predictors leading to PCD after APD have not been studied. Methods Consecutive patients with MSAP or SAP were recruited between June 2011 and June 2013. As a step-up approach, all patients initially received medical management, later underwent ultrasound-guided APD before PCD, if necessary, followed by endoscopic necrosectomy through the path formed by PCD. APD primarily targeted fluid in the abdominal or pelvic cavities, whereas PCD aimed at (peri)pancreatic fluid. Results Of the 92 enrolled patients, 40 were managed with APD alone and 52 received PCD after APD (14 required necrosectomy after initial PCD). The overall mortality was 6.5%. Univariate analysis showed that among the 20 selected parameters, 13 factors significantly affected PCD intervention after APD. Multivariate analysis revealed that infected (peri)pancreatic collections (P = -0.001), maximum extent of necrosis of more than 30% of the pancreas (P = -0.024), size of the largest necrotic peri(pancreatic) collection (P = -0.007), and reduction of (peri)pancreatic fluid collections by <50% after APD (P = -0.008) were all independent predictors of PCD. Conclusions Infected (peri)pancreatic collections, a largest necrotic peri(pancreatic) collection of more than 100 ml, and reduction of (peri)pancreatic fluid collections by <50% after APD could effectively predict the need for PCD in the early course of the disease.

TPP is assessed by measurement of esophageal pressure EP, largely influenced by pleural and intraabdominal pressure IAP. Consecutively, TPP-guided ventilation might be particularly useful in patients with high IAP. This study investigates the impact of large volume paracentesis LVP on TPP, EP, IAP as well as on hemodynamic and respiratory function in patients with liver cirrhosis and tense ascites. Material and methods We analysed 23 LVP-procedures in 11 cirrhotic patients ventilated with the AVEA Viasys respirator (CareFusion, USA) which is capable to measure EP via an esophageal tube. Results LVP of a mean volume of 4826Â±1276 mL of ascites resulted in marked increases in inspiratory (17.9Â±8.9 vs. 5.4Â±13.3 cmH2O; p<0.001) as well as expiratory TPP (-3.0Â±4.7 vs. -15.9Â±10.9 cmH2O; p<0.001; primary endpoint). In parallel, the inspiratory (2.4Â±8.7 vs. 14.1Â±14.5 cmH2O; p<0.001) and expiratory EP (12.4Â±6.0 vs. 24.9Â±11.3 cmH2O; p<0.001) significantly decreased. The effects were most pronounced for the release of the first 500 mL of ascites. LVP evoked substantial decreases in IAP and central venous pressure CVP. By contrast, mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, global end-diastolic volume index, extravascular lung water index and systemic vascular resistance index did not change. Among the respiratory parameters we observed an increase in paO2/FiO2 (247.7Â±60.9 vs. 208.3Â±46.8 mmHg; p<0.001) and a decrease in Oxygenation Index OI (4.8Â±2.0 vs. 5.8Â±3.1 cmH2O/mmHg; p = 0.002). Tidal volume (510Â±100 vs. 452Â±113 mL; p = 0.008) and dynamic respiratory system compliance Cdyn (46.8Â±15.9 vs. 35.1Â±14.6 mL/cmH20; p<0.001) increased, whereas paCO2 (47.3Â±10.7 vs. 51.2Â±12.3mmHg; p = 0.046) and the respiratory rate decreased (17.1Â±7.3 vs. 19.6Â±7.8 min-1; p = 0.010). Conclusions In mechanically ventilated patients with decompensated\n\nParenteral nutrition combined with rice soup can be a safe and effective intervention for congenital chylous ascites.\n\nPubMed\n\nCao, Yi; Yan, Weihui; Lu, Lina; Tao, Yijing; Lu, Wei; Chen, Yingwei; Tang, Qingya; Cai, Wei\n\n2016-01-01\n\nCongenital chylous ascites in the neonatal period is a rare entity. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN), medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-based diet, octreotide and repeated paracentesis are regarded as appropriate medical treatment for congenital chylous ascites, and surgery is recommended when conservative therapy has failed. We present two cases in which ascites were confirmed via an abdominal sonogram and diagnostic paracentesis. In our clinical experience, rice soup combined with PN can be a safe and effective intervention.\n\nA phase II trial of triamcinolone hexacetanide for symptomatic recurrent malignant ascites.\n\nPubMed\n\nMackey, J R; Wood, L; Nabholtz, J; Jensen, J; Venner, P\n\n2000-03-01\n\nAscites is a common complication of advanced cancer and frequently requires paracentesis to reduce symptoms of pain, anorexia, and dyspnea. For many patients repeat paracenteses are required at short intervals. We prospectively studied 15 patients with recurrent ascites of malignancy to determine if intraperitoneal triamcinolone hexacetonide, a slowly metabolized corticosteroid, produced objective and symptomatic responses. After biochemical, radiological, and symptom assessment and the establishment of the interval between paracenteses, patients underwent large-volume paracentesis followed by intraperitoneal triamcinolone hexacetonide 10 mg/kg. Patients were followed after treatment for assessment of symptoms and physical signs of ascites. Repeat paracentesis was performed when symptomatic ascites recurred. Symptomatic ascites recurred in 13 of 15 patients, but the interval between paracenteses was extended from 9.5 +/- 1.6 days to 17.5 days (P = 0.0086). Symptom questionnaire scores assessing well-being, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspnea, appetite, appearance, and change in abdominal size on a scale from 0 to 6 averaged 3.2 +/- 0.3 at entry and 2.5 +/- 0.2 at the 2-week assessment (P = 0.026). Self-assessed symptoms, feeling of well-being, abdominal distention, and physical appearance improved significantly. The mean serum cortisol decreased from baseline, suggesting that some systemic corticosteroid absorption occurred. Thirteen of 15 patients have died, with a median survival of 42 days. Potential adverse effects included 1 episode each of transient abdominal pain, bacterial peritonitis, and localized herpes zoster infection. In patients with ascites of malignancy, intraperitoneal triamcinolone hexacetonide appears to postpone the requirement for repeat paracentesis and improve symptoms of malignant ascites.\n\nAbdominal tap\n\nMedlinePlus\n\nPeritoneal tap; Paracentesis; Ascites - abdominal tap; Cirrhosis - abdominal tap; Malignant ascites - abdominal tap ... abdominal cavity ( most often cancer of the ovaries ) Cirrhosis of the liver Damaged bowel Heart disease Infection ...\n\nAbdominal stab wound protocol: prospective study documents applicability for widespread use.\n\nPubMed\n\nRosemurgy, A S; Albrink, M H; Olson, S M; Sherman, H; Albertini, J; Kramer, R; Camps, M; Reiss, A\n\n1995-02-01\n\nTraditionally, stab wounds violating the abdominal wall fascia led to exploratory celiotomy that was often nontherapeutic. In an attempt to limit the number of nontherapeutic celiotomies (NTC), we devised a protocol to prospectively study stab wounds violating the anterior abdominal wall fascia. Through protocol, abdominal stab wounds were explored in stable adults. If the anterior fascia was violated, paracentesis and, if necessary, peritoneal lavage was undertaken in the absence of previous abdominal surgery. If evisceration was noted, it was reduced and the patient lavaged. Fascial penetration was noted in 72 patients. 46 patients underwent celiotomy: because of shock/peritonitis in 8 (2 NTC), fascial penetration with a history of previous celiotomy in 7 (5 NTC), positive paracentesis in 20 (5 NTC), or positive lavage in 10 (4 NTC). One patient underwent late celiotomy without ill-effect after a negative lavage because she subsequently developed fever and localized peritonitis (ice pick injury to cecum). Eleven patients had evisceration; nine underwent celiotomy. Patients with abdominal stab wounds can be selectively managed safely. More than one-third with fascial penetration, some with evisceration, avoided exploration. Only one patient underwent delayed celiotomy and did so without detriment. Nontherapeutic celiotomy rates were highest in patients with previous abdominal surgery who, thereby, could not undergo paracentesis/lavage; excluding these patients, the nontherapeutic celiotomy rate was 17% (11/65) for those with fascial penetration.\n\nOcular penetration of intravenously administered enrofloxacin in the horse.\n\nPubMed\n\nDivers, T J; Irby, N L; Mohammed, H O; Schwark, W S\n\n2008-03-01\n\nInformation on antibiotic concentrations in the equine eye following systemic therapy is limited. Reports that Leptospira spp. are frequently present in the eyes of horses with recurrent uveitis, emphasises a need for studies on ocular concentrations of specific antibiotics. 1) Enrofloxacin, administered i.v. at 7.5 mg/kg bwt q. 24 h, results in aqueous humour concentrations greater than the reported minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for Leptospira pomona. 2) Aqueous humour paracentesis sufficiently disrupts the blood-aqueous humour barrier (BAB) to cause an increase in aqueous humour protein and enrofloxacin concentrations. Aqueous humour enrofloxacin and total protein concentrations were determined in 6 healthy, mature horses after i.v. administration of enrofloxacin. Paracentesis was performed on the left eye on Days 3 and 4, 1 h following enrofloxacin administration, to determine enrofloxacin concentrations in healthy eyes and in eyes with mechanical disruption of the BAB. Paracentesis was also performed on the right eye 23 h after enrofloxacin administration. Blood samples were collected from the horses at identical times to determine enrofloxacin aqueous humour:plasma ratios. Mean +/- s.d. enrofloxacin concentration in the aqueous humour 1 h post administration on Day 3 was 0.32 +/- 0.10 mg/l (range 0.18-0.47); and aqueous humour enrofloxacin, total protein and aqueous humour:plasma enrofloxacin ratios were higher on Day 4 than Day 3. Following disruption of the BAB, enrofloxacin concentrations were above the reported MIC for Leptospira pomona.\n\nReversal of retinal and optic disc ischemia in a patient with sickle cell trait and glaucoma secondary to traumatic hyphema.\n\nPubMed\n\nWax, M B; Ridley, M E; Magargal, L E\n\n1982-07-01\n\nA 14-year-old black boy with sickle cell trait, who sustained a traumatic hyphema, developed moderately elevated intraocular pressure that failed to respond to carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and osmotic agents. On the tenth postinjury day, a sudden increased cupping of the optic disc and partial central retinal artery obstruction caused painless loss of vision. Reversal of the cupping, the retinal ischemia, and the intraocular pressure was documented following anterior chamber paracentesis, and visual acuity returned to 6/6. Pathophysiology of the posterior ischemia is discussed. This case documents the potentially debilitating course of traumatic hyphema in \"benign\" sickle cell trait and its avoidance with proper management. The authors endorse recent suggestions for careful observation of any sickle cell patient with traumatic hyphema, and recommend anterior chamber paracentesis, supplemental oxygen, and avoidance of osmotic agents, if secondary glaucoma develops following the initial trauma.\n\nClinical impression and ascites appearance do not rule out bacterial peritonitis.\n\nPubMed\n\nChinnock, Brian; Hendey, Gregory W; Minnigan, Hal; Butler, Jack; Afarian, Hagop\n\n2013-05-01\n\nPrevious research has demonstrated that physician clinical suspicion, determined without assessing fluid appearance, is not adequate to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) without fluid testing. To determine the sensitivity of physician clinical suspicion, including a bedside assessment of fluid appearance, in the detection of SBP in Emergency Department (ED) patients undergoing paracentesis. We conducted a prospective, observational study of ED patients with ascites undergoing paracentesis at three academic facilities. The enrolling physician recorded the clinical suspicion of SBP (\"none,\" \"low,\" \"moderate,\" or \"high\"), and ascites appearance (\"clear,\" \"hazy,\" \"cloudy,\" or \"bloody\"). SBP was defined as an absolute neutrophil count â¥ 250 cells/mm(3), or culture pathogen growth. We defined \"clear\" ascites fluid as negative for SBP, and \"hazy,\" \"cloudy,\" or \"bloody\" as positive. A physician clinical suspicion of \"none\" or \"low\" was considered negative for SBP, and an assessment of \"moderate\" or \"high\" was considered positive. The primary outcome measure was sensitivity of physician clinical impression and ascites appearance for SBP. There were 348 cases enrolled, with SBP diagnosed in 43 (12%). Physician clinical suspicion had a sensitivity of 42% (95% confidence interval [CI] 29-55%) for the detection of SBP. Fluid appearance had a sensitivity of 72% (95% CI 58-83%). Physician clinical impression, which included an assessment of fluid appearance, had poor sensitivity for the detection of SBP and cannot be used to exclude the diagnosis. Routine laboratory fluid analysis is indicated after ED paracentesis, even in patients considered to have a low degree of suspicion for SBP. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

After ascertaining that the intracameral bubble is either too large and/or has rendered IOP too high, a bead of ophthalmic viscoelastic is applied to the ocular surface over a paracentesis incision, which is then depressed in the usual fashion to burp gas from the anterior chamber. The weight and viscosity of the viscoelastic create a tamponade that slows the egress of gas from the anterior chamber, thereby making it more controllable. If the bubble size or IOP needs to be reduced at the conclusion of the Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty procedure, application of ophthalmic viscoelastic over the paracentesis can enhance the surgeon's control over the volume of gas burped from the anterior chamber, thereby reducing the tendency to swing between a bubble that is too large or too small.\n\n'Blue bubble' technique: an ab interno approach for Descemet separation in deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty using trypan blue stained viscoelastic device.\n\nPubMed\n\nLivny, Eitan; Bahar, Irit; Hammel, Naama; Nahum, Yoav\n\n2018-04-01\n\nIn this study, we examined a novel variant of 'big-bubble' deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty using trypan-blue-stained viscoelastic device for the creation of a pre-descemetic bubble. Ten corneoscleral rims were mounted on an artificial anterior chamber (AC). The AC was filled with air through a limbal paracentesis. A Melles' triangulated spatula was inserted through the paracentesis, with its tip penetrating the AC, was then slightly retracted and pushed into the deep stroma above the roof of the paracentesis. A mixture of trypan blue and viscoelastic device (Healon, Abbott Medical Optics, Abbott Park, Illinois) was injected into this intra-stromal pocket using a 27-G cannula to create a pre-descemetic separation bubble. Bubble type and visualization of dyed viscoelastic device were noted. The method was later employed in three cases. In all 10 corneoscleral rims, the technique successfully created a visible pre-descemetic (type 1) bubble that could be expanded up to the predicted diameter of trephination. Subsequent trephination and the removal of corneal stroma were uneventful. In two out of four clinical cases, a type 1 bubble was created, while in two others, visco-dissection failed and dyed viscoelastic was seen in the AC. The presented technique holds promise of being a relatively easy to perform, predictable and well-controlled alternative for achieving a type 1 bubble during deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty surgery. The trypan-blue-stained viscoelastic device facilitates proper visualization and control of the separation bubble and assists in identifying the penetrance to the separation bubble prior to removal of the stromal cap.

This study assessed widely available educational videos for point-of-care US-guided procedures relevant to internal medicine: central venous catheterization, thoracentesis, and paracentesis. We searched Ovid MEDLINE, YouTube, and Google to identify videos for point-of-care US-guided paracentesis, thoracentesis, and central venous catheterization. Videos were evaluated with a 5-point scale assessing the global educational value and a checklist based on consensus guidelines for competencies in point-of-care US-guided procedures. For point-of-care US-guided central venous catheterization, 12 videos were found, with an average global educational value scoreâÂ±âSD of 4.5âÂ±â0.7. Indications to abort the procedure were discussed in only 3 videos. Five videos described the indications and contraindications for performing central venous catheterization. For point-of-care US-guided thoracentesis, 8 videos were identified, with an average global educational value score of 4.0âÂ±â0.9. Only one video discussed indications to abort the procedure, and 3 videos discussed sterile technique. For point-of-care US-guided paracentesis, 7 videos were included, with an average global educational value score of 4.1âÂ±â0.9. Only 1 video discussed indications to abort the procedure, and 2 described the location of the inferior epigastric artery. The 27 videos reviewed contained good-quality general instruction. However, we noted a lack of safety-related information in most of the available videos. Further development of resources is required to teach internal medicine trainees skills that focus on the safety of point-of-care US guidance.

The effects of topical BOL-303242-X and DEX on intraocular pressure (IOP) and body weight changes were also evaluated. Dry eye was induced by atropine sulfate administration and was treated with saline, BOL-303242-X (0.1%-1.0%), DEX (0.1%), Restasis 0.05% (Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA), or Refresh Endura (Allergan, Inc.) three times per day for 7 to 8 days. For paracentesis studies, vehicle, BOL-303242-X (0.1%, 0.5%, and 1.0%), or DEX (0.1%) were repeatedly administered topically 3 hours before paracentesis and continued for 90 minutes afterward. For IOP and body weight measurements, right eyes of rabbits were topically treated with vehicle, BOL-303242-X (1.0% or 0.1%), or DEX (0.1%) four times per day for 6 weeks. In the dry eye model, BOL-303242-X and DEX were fully efficacious, maintaining tear volume and tear breakup time (TBUT) at baseline levels. Although Restasis improved tear volume compared with vehicle, no changes were observed in TBUT. In the paracentesis study, BOL-303242-X and DEX improved ocular inflammation. BOL-303242-X reduced protein and PGE(2) levels. Finally, BOL-303242-X showed no effects on integrated IOP or body weight, whereas DEX significantly increased integrated IOP and prevented the increase of body weight observed in the vehicle-treated animals. BOL-303242-X shows full anti-inflammatory efficacy (similar to DEX) in experimental models of dry eye and postoperative inflammation while demonstrating reduced effects in IOP and body weight. These data indicate that mapracorat, a SEGRA, shows efficacy similar to that of traditional steroids while exhibiting an improved side effect profile in IOP and muscle wasting.\n\nPost Anesthesia Care Unit Patient Classification System: The Direct Care Nursing Time Component\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1991-07-18\n\nRemoval 1304 Enema - Cleansing 1305 Enema - Retention 1306 Colostomy - Irrigation 1307 Colostomy - Dressing Change 1308 Lavage 1309 Paracentesis 1310...Curettage 1910 Vaginal /Pelvic Ex,.iiination 1911 Urinary Bladder Training 1912 Condom Catheter Application 1913 Peritoneal Dialysis - Initiation 1914...Hypothermia/Hyperthermia Treatment 2101 Oral Medication 2102 Intramuscular Medication 2103 Subcutaneous Medication 2104 Suppository, Rectal/ Vaginal\n\nAISF-SIMTI position paper: the appropriate use of albumin in patients with liver cirrhosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nCaraceni, Paolo; Angeli, Paolo; Prati, Daniele; Bernardi, Mauro; Liumbruno, Giancarlo M; Bennardello, Francesco; Piccoli, Pierluigi; Velati, Claudio\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe use of human albumin is common in hepatology since international scientific societies support its administration to treat or prevent severe complications of cirrhosis, such as the prevention of post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction after large-volume paracentesis and renal failure induced by spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome in association with vasoconstrictors. However, these indications are often disregarded, mainly because the high cost of human albumin leads health authorities and hospital administrations to restrict its use.

DBS leads were implanted in G1, G2 and G3, targeting left nucleus ventralis posterior thalami. Paracentesis was performed in G4. 24Â h after MRI scan, all animals were killed for examining pathological alternation (at different distance from lead) via transmission electron microscopy. Our results suggest that the severity of tissue injury correlates with the distance to electrode instead of field strength of MRI.

The following parameters were compared prospectively between outpatients and inpatients: spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prevalence, age, gender, cause of cirrhosis, symptoms, score and grade according to Child-Pugh classification, cirrhosis complications, antibiotics treatment, serum creatinine, platelet count and ascitic protein concentration. SBP was observed in 91 patients. In the whole population the SBP prevalence was 8.7% (95%CI: 7.2-10.6) it was 11.7% (95%CI: 9.5-14.3) in inpatients and 3.1% (95%CI: 1.7-5.5) in outpatients (P < 0.00001). SBP prevalence was 8.3% (95%CI: 4.3-15.6) in symptomatic outpatients vs 1.2% (95%CI: 0.4-3.4) in asymptomatic outpatients (P < 0.002). Patients undergoing outpatient AP were significantly different from those undergoing inpatient AP; they were older (61.1 Â± 11.1 years vs 59.4 Â± 11.7 years; P = 0.028), cause of cirrhosis was less often alcohol (83 .7 vs 88.2%; P < 0.001), Child-Pugh score was lower (8.9 vs 10.1; P < 0.001) and more often B than C (63.7% vs 38%; P < 0.001). In addition, in outpatients the platelet count was higher (161 Â± 93 Giga/L vs 143 Â± 89 Giga/L; P = 0.003), serum total bilirubin concentration was lower (38.2 Â± 60.7 Î¼mol/L vs 96.3 Â± 143.3 Î¼mol/L; P < 0.0001), and ascitic protein concentration higher (17.9 Â± 10.7 g/L vs 14.5 Â± 10.9 g/L; P < 0.001) than in inpatients. In asymptomatic cirrhotic outpatients, the incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is low thus exploratory paracentesis could be avoided in these patients without significant risk.\n\nDesign of a novel system for spectroscopy measurements of the aqueous humor\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMiller, Joe; Uttamchandani, Deepak G.\n\n2001-06-01\n\nThe authors report on the design of a system which will enable real time measurements of (therapeutic) drug concentrations in the anterior chamber of the eye. Currently the concentration of therapeutic drugs in the anterior chamber is determined by analyzing samples which have been removed from the aqueous humor of laboratory animal eyes. This sampling via paracentesis can be painful and does not provide a continuous measurement. Our system will be far less invasive, removing the need for sampling via paracentesis, and also providing a continuous measurement, enabling a more complete understanding of the kinetics of ophthalmic drugs. A key component in our novel system is a specially constructed contact lens. We report on the design, optimization and manufacture of such a contact lens system capable of directing UV/VIS light in, across and out of the anterior chamber of the eye, thereby enabling absorption spectroscopy measurements of the aqueous humor to be undertaken. Design of the one piece contact lens/mirror system was achieved using the Zemax optical design software package and the lens was fabricated from synthetic fused silica. Results from modeling of the lens and experimental measurements on light propagation across the anterior chamber of animal eyes assisted by the lens will be reported.\n\nSpontaneous puerperal extraperitoneal bladder wall rupture in young woman with diagnostic dilemma\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSabat, Debabrat Kumar; Panigrahi, Pradeep Kumar; Sahoo, Ranjan Kumar; Acharya, Mousumi; Sahu, Mahesh Ch\n\n2015-01-01\n\nA young female presented with an acute abdominal pain and oliguria for 1 week following normal vaginal delivery. No history of hematuria was present. Patient was having lochia rubra. Sealed uterine rupture was suspected clinically. Initial ultrasound of the patient showed distended urinary bladder containing Foley catheter ballon with clamping of Foley catheter and particulate ascites. Abdominal paracentesis revealed hemorrhagic fluid. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of abdomen revealed ascites, distended urinary bladder and no extraluminal contrast extravasation in delayed scan. As patient condition deteriorated, repeat ultrasound guided abdominal paracentesis was done which revealed transudative peritoneal collection with distended bladder. Cystoscopy revealed urinary bladder ruptures with exudate sealing the rupture site. Exploratory laparotomy was done and a diagnosis of extraperitoneal bladder rupture was confirmed. The rent was repaired in layers. She was put on continuous bladder drainage for 3 weeks followed by bladder training. It presented in a unique way as there was hemorrhagic peritoneal tap, no macroscopic hematuria and urinary bladder was distended in spite of urinary bladder wall rupture which delayed the diagnosis and treatment. Complete emptying of urinary bladder before second stage of labor and during postpartum period with perineal repair is mandatory to prevent urinary bladder rupture.

Many malignant entities such as non-Hodgkin's lymphomas may masquerade as uveitis. We report a case of an HIV-positive patient with masquerade syndrome presenting unilateral uveitis. 45-year-old Caucasian man with a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The patient was diagnosed by a biopsy of an abdominal mass which showed fragments of gastric mucosa with diffuse growth of neoplastic cells. At diagnosis, the patient suffered from unilateral blurring of vision and a sudden decrease of left-eye visual acuity. A slit-lamp examination of the left eye revealed a diagnosis of anterior uveitis. The patient exhibited no signs of posterior uveitis. An anterior-chamber paracentesis was performed and analyzed by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC), showing cells CD45, CD19, CD20, CD22, and CD38 positives, and moderate expression of CD10 with kappa light chain restriction, showing a monoclonal B-cell population. The patient received CHOP-R with intrathecal methotrexate followed by consolidation high dose methotrexate obtaining a complete response which is ongoing. Differential diagnosis between chronic uveitis and ocular lymphoma may be challenging. We advocate anterior-chamber paracentesis in cases of refractory uveitis in patients with hematologic malignancies. Â© 2016 International Clinical Cytometry Society.

Human ascitic fluid was obtained from 6 cirrhotic patients by paracentesis. The interaction effect was evaluated by the checkerboard technique. Our results indicate the ability of human ascitic fluid to reduce minimum inhibitory concentrations of moxifloxacin against Gram-negative bacteria, but not against Gram-positives.\n\nAscites Index - a novel technique to evaluate ascites in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: a concept-proof study.\n\nPubMed\n\nSzkodziak, Piotr Robert; Czuczwar, Piotr; Wrona, Wojciech; Paszkowski, Tomasz; Szkodziak, Filip; WoÅºniak, SÅawomir\n\n2018-01-01\n\nControlled ovarian hyperstimulation is an important step in infertility treatment. In some cases, however, ovar-ian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) can occur. In its severe forms, ascites is likely to develop, associated with dyspnea. The aim of this study was to explore the usefulness of Ascites Index (AsI), a new tool for quantitative determination of ascites in patients with OHSS, to obtain data for planning further trials. Twelve patients with OHSS and ascites were included in the study. All patients were admitted to the hospital because of abdominal pain and dyspnea due to increasing ascites. Ultrasound measurements of ascites extent were performed in four external quadrants of the abdomen. Pockets of free fluid were measured. The obtained values were totaled, forming the Ascites Index (AsI), similarly to the amniotic fluid index. Because of dyspnea, paracentesis was performed in all cases. Median AsI at which patients reported dyspnea was 29.0 cm (range 21.6-38.6 cm). At AsI values less than 21.6 cm, no dyspnea was observed in any of the 12 studied patients. To avoid complications, 2000 mL of ascitic fluid was collected in each patient. After paracentesis, range of AsI decreased to 12.1-14.5 cm. The proposed AsI seems to be a promising tool for estimating and monitoring the ascites extent in OHSS. It can be estimated using basic ultrasound equipment. AsI requires further studies for standardization and transferability to other causes of ascites.\n\nCatumaxomab: malignant ascites: unjustified marketing authorisation.\n\nPubMed\n\n2010-10-01\n\nThe only treatment for malignant ascites in patients with refractory cancer is paracentesis, a procedure to relieve symptoms. Catumaxomab, a monoclonal antibody, is now authorised in the European Union for intraperitoneal administration to patients with epithelial cancers that overexpress epithelial cellular adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and provoke ascites unresponsive to chemotherapy. Clinical evaluation of catumaxomab in this setting is based on a comparative, randomised but unblinded trial including 258 patients. Patients in the catumaxomab group had four paracenteses over a 10-day period, followed by a 6-hour intraperitoneal catumaxomab infusion, while patients in the control group had a single paracentesis. Catumaxomab did not extend median survival time, which was about two months. Methodological biases rule out any conclusions as to whether catumaxomab reduced the number of paracenteses needed during this short survival period. In this trial, 80% of patients treated with catumaxomab experienced serious adverse events, versus 29% of controls, resulting in hospitalisation in respectively about 29% versus 16% of patients. Two-thirds of patients had reactions linked to intraperitoneal catumaxomab infusion. Gastrointestinal disorders were frequent, and included abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Catumaxomab is hepatotoxic. In addition, most patients develop anti-catumaxomab antibodies, although the clinical consequences are unclear. Catumaxomab therapy is inconvenient: it lasts 10 days and requires 4 intraperitoneal infusions that last 6 hours each and require 24-hour monitoring. In practice, catumaxomab has more harms than benefits. It is better to focus on individually tailored palliative care for these terminally ill patients.\n\nChylous ascites following abdominal aortic surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nPanieri, E; Kussman, B D; Michell, W L; Tunnicliffe, J A; Immelman, E J\n\n1995-03-01\n\nChylous ascites is an extremely rare complication of abdominal aortic surgery. A case with a successful outcome is presented, followed by a review of the 17 published cases. Chylous ascites can result in nutritional imbalance, immunological deficit and respiratory dysfunction. Paracentesis confirms the diagnosis and provides symptomatic relief. Conservative management, beginning with a low-fat diet and medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) supplementation, is recommended, changing to total parenteral nutrition if unsuccessful. Failure of non-operative treatment may necessitate the need for laparotomy and ligation of leaking lymphatics or peritoneovenous shunting.\n\nChylous ascites: a sequel of pelvic radiation therapy\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSipes, S.L.; Newton, M.; Lurain, J.R.\n\n1985-12-01\n\nChylous ascites is an unusual condition with many causes. Two cases are presented in which it appeared to be related to whole pelvis irradiation in one patient for carcinoma of the vagina and in another for carcinoma of the vulva. The diagnosis is made by paracentesis and analysis of the fluid. The underlying disease usually requires identification by exploratory laparotomy. Although a malignant process is the most common cause, the only findings in the authors' cases were widespread radiation changes in the intestine. After diagnosis treatment by low-fat diet with medium-chain triglyceride supplements resulted in disappearance of chylous ascites.\n\nFriend Leukemogenic Virus-neutralizing Antibody from Mouse Ascitic Fluid\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMarch, R. W.; Chirigos, M. A.; Hook, W. A.; Burka, B. L.\n\n1967-01-01\n\nAscitic fluid antibody produced in C57/B1 mice immunized with Friend leukemogenic virus exhibited potent neutralizing activity. In vitro neutralization tests revealed that a mean neutralization index of 3.0 was achieved, and it was shown by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation that this antibody resembled the 7S type. A mean yield of 6.7 ml of fluid per mouse per weekly paracentesis was obtained over an 8-week period. The ascitic fluid antibody to Friend virus was also active in vivo. Mice given antibody 3, 5, 7, and 9 days after infection with Friend virus did not develop the splenomegaly characteristic of Friend disease.

Samples were collected from ascites fluid and from pleural drains or during paracentesis and thoracentesis, respectively. Anidulafungin levels in ascites fluid (0.12 to 0.99 Î¼g/ml) and in pleural effusion (0.32 to 2.02 Î¼g/ml) were below the simultaneous levels in plasma (1.04 to 7.70 and 2.48 to 13.36 Î¼g/ml, respectively) and below the MIC values for several pathogenic Candida strains.

Although there is no evidence to support the use of albumin rather than crystalloid in acute volume resuscitation, many clinicians continue to use albumin because it has other important physiologic effects besides the oncotic function. In keeping with the improved understanding of albumin physiology and pathophysiology of many acute and chronic diseases, use of albumin for medical applications has increased in recent years. This, along with increased costs of manufacturing and lower production volume of medical-grade albumin, has lead to an ongoing shortage and rapid increase in albumin prices. This review is based on the analysis of major publications, related to albumin chemistry, physiology, and medical uses including guidelines developed by professional and governmental organizations. Results reflect current knowledge about the role of albumin in health and disease and relevance of albumin therapy in specific clinical settings. Albumin therapy is currently recommended in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis with ascites, refractory ascites not responsive to diuretics, large-volume paracentesis, post-paracentesis syndrome, and the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome as an adjunct to vasoconstrictors. New indications for albumin therapy are linked to the antioxidant activity of albumin and its effects on capillary integrity. In recent years, large-pore hemofiltration and albumin exchange have emerged as promising liver support therapies for liver failure and other toxic syndromes. They are designed to remove a broad range of blood-borne toxins and to restore normal functions of the circulating albumin by replacing defective forms of albumin and albumin molecules saturated with toxins with normal albumin. In view of the ongoing worldwide shortage and high cost of human albumin (native and recombinant), new usage criteria, protocols, and guidelines for appropriate utilization\n\n[Otitis media with effusion: a study of 346 cases in an outpatient clinic].\n\nPubMed\n\nOgawa, Hiroshi\n\n2002-08-01\n\nWe treated 346 patients with otitis media with effusion (OME) and 30 (127 episodes) with recurrent acute suppurative otitis media at our outpatient clinic in the 6 years from October 1994 to September 2000. Of these, children under 15 years old numbered 185, mostly boys at a ratio of 1.4: 1.0, while patients aged 15 years or older numbered 161, mostly females at a ratio of 1.3: 1.0. In children, 24 were excluded due to a lack of diagnostic follow-up, 65 (40%) patients improved in conservative management of medication with and without repeated tubal inflation, 79 (49%) improved by paracentesis, and 18 (11%) recovered with the use of pressure equalization tubes (grommets). Of cases aged 15 years or older, follow-up was not possible in 28. Three (2%) were free of OME by conservative treatment, 116 (87%) improved by paracentesis, and 9 (7%) by using tubes. The mean durations of tube insertion was 11.3 months in children and 7.2 months in adults, but 5 adults (4%) continue being treated of this writing. Bilateral cases were 30% of children and 8% of adults with 73% of children affected bilaterally having persistence or recurrence. Acute purulent otitis media progressed to OME in 22% of children but only in 3% of patients aged 15 or older. In 36% of children and 26% of patients aged 15 or older, acute upper respiratory tract infection coincided with or predisposed to OME. Rhinosinusitis was seen in 19% of children and 14% of adults. Coincident allergic rhinitis was seen in 14% of children and 12% of adults with OME. Nasopharyngeal infection and allergy are likely related to OME development. The peak incidence of OME was similar to that of recurrent suppurative otitis media in children, so a seminal precipitating factor appears to result in these 2 conditions.\n\nFluid Extravasation in Hip Arthroscopy: A Systematic Review.\n\nPubMed\n\nEkhtiari, Seper; Haldane, Chloe E; de Sa, Darren; Simunovic, Nicole; Ayeni, Olufemi R\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe purpose of this systematic review was to (1) characterize cases of fluid extravasation during hip arthroscopy and explore common factors among them and (2) describe management strategies and outcomes of this complication. The databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed were searched and screened in duplicate. Data regarding patient demographics, fluid management, presentation, management, and outcomes were collected. Study quality was assessed in duplicate using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies Criteria. Fourteen studies (1,286 patients) were included. Twenty-two occurrences of symptomatic fluid extravasation were reported in 21 patients (1.6% of total patients; one patient had fluid extravasation during 2 separate hip arthroscopies). Two studies of normal fluid extravasation in asymptomatic patients reported 1.13 to 3.06Â L of extravasated fluid observed on computed tomography. Nine case studies were included, which provided detailed patient and surgical information. Of these 9 patients (10 cases) with a mean age of 38.2Â years old (range, 15 to 55Â years), 6 were female. Signs of fluid extravasation included abdominal distension (89%), hypothermia (56%), hypotension. and metabolic acidosis (33% each). Four patients required surgical intervention, while 3 underwent paracentesis. Two patients were managed conservatively. All patients stabilized and were discharged, with one patient reporting abdominal complaints at latest follow-up (length of follow-up unspecified). Fluid extravasation is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of hip arthroscopy. It is important for surgeons and anaesthesiologists to be aware of its existence in order to recognize and manage it promptly. Most patients require interventional management by surgery or paracentesis, but some stabilize with conservative management. Level IV, systematic review of Level IV studies.

After usual preparation of a superficial and a deep scleral flap with externalization of the Schlemm's canal and peeling the juxtacanalicular trabecular meshwork, the goniosynechia is transected by a spatula introduced to the anterior chamber through a paracentesis. A Descemet's window provides full visual control at the peripheral cornea at the basis of the superficial scleral flap. With this surgical technique, selective treatment of goniosynechiae is possible exactly at the area where creation of low outflow resistance is intended by the surgeon during nonpenetrating glaucoma surgery. This technique enables the surgeon to perform nonpenetrating glaucoma surgery even in the presence of peripheral anterior synechiae.\n\nTrocar anterior chamber maintainer: Improvised infusion technique.\n\nPubMed\n\nAgarwal, Amar; Narang, Priya; Kumar, Dhivya A; Agarwal, Ashvin\n\n2016-02-01\n\nWe present an improvised technique of infusion that uses a trocar cannula as an anterior chamber maintainer (ACM). Although routinely used in posterior segment surgery, the trocar cannula has been infrequently used in complex anterior segment procedures. The trocar ACM creates a transconjunctival biplanar wound of appropriate size that is self-sealing and overcomes the shortcomings of an ACM, such as spontaneous extrusion and forced introduction into the eye from variability in the size of the corneal paracentesis incision. Constant infusion inflow through the trocar ACM is used to maintain positive intraocular pressure through a self-sealing sclerotomy incision at the limbus.

Clinically it produces malabsorption, protein-losing enteropathy, hypogammaglobulin in blood, and several degrees of malnutrition. Its treatment is not easy and includes dietetic-therapy and drugs. A 35-year-old-woman case report is exposed. She has recurrent chylosa ascites, requiring several admissions and evacuatory paracentesis. After food-fat was replaced by medium-chain triacyl-glicerol-enriched diet, a clinical, analytical and anthropometric improvement was demonstrated. The major way of treatment in intestinal lymphangiectasia in this case is the employement of specific-diet and adaptaded-basic-food. It's difficult and high collaboration of the patient is required, being necessary medical revisions during the whole life, due to the not well known evolution of this long-standing disease.\n\nTransjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt for Treatment of Cirrhosis-related Chylothorax and Chylous Ascites: Single-institution Retrospective Experience\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKikolski, Steven G., E-mail: skikolski@ucsd.edu; Aryafar, Hamed, E-mail: haryafar@ucsd.edu; Rose, Steven C., E-mail: scrose@ucsd.edu\n\n2013-08-01\n\nPurposeTo investigate the efficacy and safety of the use of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation to treat cirrhosis-related chylous collections (chylothorax and chylous ascites).MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed data from four patients treated for refractory cirrhosis-related chylous collections with TIPS at our institution over an 8 year period.ResultsOne patient had chylothorax, and three patients had concomitant chylothorax and chylous ascites.

Phase II: to evaluate the effect of carprofen on PGE(2) , NO(x) , and TNF-Î± in canine aqueous humor following ACP. Four beagles in phase I and 8 beagles in phase II. Phase I: ACP was performed at time (T) 0, 4 and 8 h. Phase II: A randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over design with four dogs per group where carprofen was given 4.4 mg/kg/day on day (D) 1, 2 and 3. ACP was performed at T0 and T1.5 on D3. Statistical analysis was performed with repeated measures anova and post hoc Tukey-Kramer multiple-comparison procedure. In phase II, TNF-Î± level was analyzed with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Phase I: PGE(2) significantly increased (P < 0.0001) to plateau at T4. NO(X) was decreased at T4 (P < 0.06), but increased at T8 (P < 0.0001). COX-2 showed detectable expression only at T8. TNF-Î±, NOS-2, MMP-3 and -9 were undetectable at all time points. Phase II: At T1.5, PGE(2) was significantly elevated in both groups but was lower in the carprofen group (P = 0.037). NO(x) and TNF-Î± did not statistically increase in either group. Following ACP, significant increases in PGE(2) levels confirmed inflammation characterized by a rise of COX-2. The NO(x) pathway took longer to induce as compared with PGE(2) . Carprofen decreased PGE(2) levels and could help control intraocular inflammation.

Cultures from the capsular bag yielded P. acnes in all three. With topical anesthesia and through an anterior chamber paracentesis, culture specimens were taken from and clindamycin irrigated into the capsular bag. Filtered 100% oxygen was introduced into the anterior chamber in two; the third also received an injection of gentamicin and dexamethasone into the capsular bag. After treatment, two patients received oral antibiotics; one received hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Visual acuity was improved and inflammation reduced in all three. However, after treatment, ocular toxic effects due to clindamycin were suspected in one. This approach offers several clear advantages, including topical anesthesia, outpatient management, elimination of the need for vitrectomy, and retention of the intraocular lens (IOL).\n\nCase report: liver abscess pyogenic after peritonitis appendix perforation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDamanik, E.

It is usually caused by Klebsiella pneumonia and Escherichia coli. Historically, PLA is usually caused by acute appendicitis, but with developed of surgical practice and microbiology, the number of events has decreased. Here we present a case of a39-year-old woman that developed a PLA after she had an appendectomy about six months ago. An ultrasonogram and abdominal scan showed an abscess in the right lobe. We performed paracentesis, and the result from the pus culturewas positive for Escherichia coli with Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) (+) that showed the same as the culture from lesion taken from her appendix. This report emphasizes the fact that, nowadays we still found Pyogenic liver abscess after peritonitis appendix perforation.\n\nCase report : tuberculosis liver abscess in male alcoholism patient\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSiahaan, W. P.; Ginting, F.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nA liver abscess often occurs in low-middle income countries such as Indonesia. Two most common liver abscesses are amoebic and pyogenic liver abscess. Data that reported tuberculosis liver abscess (TLA) is extremely rare. A diagnostic criterion for tuberculosis liver abscess is rare and remains unclear. A 52-year-old man developed a TLA which was not associated with any pulmonary or gastrointestinal tract foci of tuberculosis. An ultrasonogram and abdominal scan showed an abscess in the right lobe. We performed paracentesis, and the pus from the lesion was positive tubercular bacilli on acid-fast bacilli staining. The patient was started on systemic antitubercular therapy to which he responded favorably. This report emphasizes the fact that, although a TLA is a very rare entity, it should be included in the differential diagnosis of liver abscess especially in Indonesia where the prevalence of tuberculosis is extremely high.\n\nAbdominal compartment syndrome--the prevention and treatment of possible lethal complications following hip arthroscopy: a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nCiemniewska-Gorzela, Kinga; Piontek, Tomasz; Szulc, Andrzej\n\n2014-11-14\n\nIntra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome have been increasingly recognized as a hip arthroscopy complication over the past decade. In the absence of consensus definitions and treatment guidelines, the diagnosis and management of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome remains variable from institution to institution. We report the occurrence of the extravasation of fluid into the abdomen during arthroscopic treatment of femoroacetabular impingement combined with resection of trochanteric bursa and our management of the condition in a 55-year old Caucasian woman. We present an algorithm of treatment of abdominal compartment syndrome, as a hip arthroscopy complication, according to the consensus definitions and recommendations of the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome. In the algorithm options, we have included paracentesis and percutaneous catheter decompression as the main point of treatment. Our algorithm will have a broader clinical impact on orthopedic surgery, anesthesiology and emergency medicine.\n\n[Viral retinitis following intravitreal triamcinolone injection].\n\nPubMed\n\nZghal, I; Malek, I; Amel, C; Soumaya, O; Bouguila, H; Nacef, L\n\n2013-09-01\n\nNecrotizing viral retinitis is associated with infection by the Herpes family of viruses, especially herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV) and occasionally cytomegalovirus (CMV). When the diagnosis is suspected clinically, antiviral therapy must be instituted immediately. We report the case of a patient presenting with necrotizing viral retinitis 3 months following intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide for diabetic macular edema. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated a superior temporal occlusive vasculitis. A diagnostic anterior chamber paracentesis was performed to obtain deoxyribo-nucleic acid (DNA) for a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for viral retinitis. PCR was positive for CMV. The patient was placed on intravenous ganciclovir. CMV retinitis is exceedingly rare in immunocompetent patients; however, it remains the most common cause of posterior uveitis in immunocompromised patients. The incidence of this entity remains unknown. Local immunosuppression, the dose and the frequency of injections may explain the occurrence of this severe retinitis. Copyright Â© 2013.

A total of 171 medical students at seven medical schools were surveyed regarding frequency of performance, self-confidence, and perceived importance of 21 procedural and interpretive skills. Of the 122 responding students (71% response rate), a majority had never performed lumbar puncture, thoracentesis, paracentesis, or blood culture, and students reported lowest self-confidence in these skills. At least one-quarter of students had never performed phlebotomy, peripheral intravenous catheter insertion, or arterial blood sampling. Students perceived all 21 skills as important to learn and perform during medical school. Through the third year of medical school, a majority of students had never performed important procedures, and a substantial minority had not performed basic procedures. Students had low self-confidence in s"
