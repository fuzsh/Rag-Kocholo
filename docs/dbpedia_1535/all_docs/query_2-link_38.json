        "text": "Music for All venues will follow a universal clear bag policy in 2023.\n\nThis applies to any person using spectator gates at an event (including students and staff before and after performances), including situations in which the band re-entry gate is the same as the spectator gate. This policy does not apply to performance flow entry and exit gates.\n\nOnly still photography is allowed, and only from general admission seats. Tripods should not be used and the viewing experience of other spectators may not be disrupted.\n\nStill photography is not allowed at field level.\n\nVideo and audio recording of any kind is not allowed, no exceptions.\n\nPreliminary performance times are scheduled based on a random draw. Applications received and paid for on or before January 31, 2023 were eligible for the initial draw, after which performance times are based on postmark of application, with earlier postmarks receiving the later performance times. The previous year’s Regional Champion has the option to choose its Prelims performance time. Finals performances are scheduled by a random draw on site.\n\nBy nature, appreciation of arts requires subjective reactions. We do not announce or publish band classifications, before or during events. Our intention is to not draw attention to classification, so as to eliminate expectations of a band’s performance based on class, including those of the judges.\n\nREGIONALS:\n\nThe top 12 scoring bands, regardless of class, are invited to compete in the evening’s Regional Finals.\n\nSUPER REGIONALS:\n\nSuper Regional Championships accept 14 bands into Finals. The 14 bands are chosen according to the following procedure: the five highest scoring bands in each of the two Prelims judging panels, regardless of class, plus the next four highest scoring bands from both of the two Prelims, regardless of class, will advance to Finals. If a Class Champion is not among the highest scoring bands advancing to Finals, they will be invited to perform at Finals in exhibition."
