        "text": "Why Choose Catholic Health for Pediatric Care?\n\nWhen you have children, you want the best for their health. Catholic Health pediatricians care for children up to the age 21.\n\nOur expert doctors will see your child on a regular basis and when they get sick. Your pediatric will:\n\nEvaluate your child’s growth and development\n\nTeach you about child safety\n\nProvide immunizations and prescriptions for medications\n\nDiagnose common illnesses\n\nWhen necessary, your pediatrician will also refer to you specialty doctors to ensure your child receives the best care.\n\nChoosing Your Child’s Doctor\n\nMany parents begin searching for a pediatrician during mom’s second trimester.\n\nIt is important to choose your pediatrician before your baby is born, so that the doctor can examine your baby after you deliver.\n\nIf your pediatrician does not have privileges at the hospital, or if you have not chosen a pediatrician, your baby may be seen by one of our in-house doctors. In-house pediatricians accept all insurance carriers."
