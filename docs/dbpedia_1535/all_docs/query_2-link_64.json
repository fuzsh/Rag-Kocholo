        "text": "AT a meeting of the Biofeedback Research Society in New Orleans last November, an eminent Detroit physiologist let it be known that a patient in his clinic had conquered the symptoms of hypertension through mental processes—without drugs. The man was not young. His treatment had been a form of education in blood‐pressure control, along with behavior therapy. Though one case does not make a medical revolution, there was a crackle of excitement as the doctor spoke, for the announcement may have marked the beginning of a new treatment for a wide variety of diseases, from psychiatric complaints to stress ailments him colitis and gastric ulcers, that will rely for its efficacy on the education of the nervous system.\n\nThe technique is known as biofeedback. It is an offshoot of laboratory research in which electronic instruments are used to amplify changes in the body (such as occur in blood pressure, heart rate, muscle contractions). The changes instantly trigger signals in the external instruments, such as a sound or a light, which on repetition can allow a person to identify the cues of internal changes— the first step in learning to control them.\n\nFOR thousands of years Eastern mystics and yogis have demonstrated remarkable control over mind and body, while we Westerners have tended to dismiss them as charlatans when they were buried alive for hours, dropped their pulse to the vanishing point or demonstrated that they could listen during their sleep. However, today in the West a number of prestigious laboratory clinics are training people to control their heart rate, lower blood pressure, change skin temperature, relax cartaro muscles, or produce certain brain waves — and thus to control without drugs cardiac arrhythmias, symptoms of insomnia, migraine and tension headaches.\n\nThis does not mean feedback is a panacea for organic disease. Even in the course of psychosomatic illnesses there seems to be a point at which organic damage may not be reversible. But although doctors in the field are rightly cautious, biofeedback promises to return us to a more holistic kind of medicine in which the patient will acquire more responsibility for, and power over, his own health, no longer finding himself treated as a defective organ, but as a person in a context, with a life style and habits that affect his own body. Biofeedback puts the emphasis back on training, rather than the “miracle pill” or surgery, and indicates that the mind itself can be trained to do most of the things that mind‐changing drugs are used for.\n\nThe principle is simple. You learn to throw a ball by visual and neuromuscular feedback. You feel your arm move, see where the ball went and correct your arm next time. In a similar way, an instrument can detect minuscule internal changes in such processes as blood flow or brain‐wave patterns, of which you may not be consciously aware. By instantly showing you these changes, it can help you recognize the cues and learn control.\n\nAlthough it is similar to conditioning, most feedback does not offer an explicit and extraneous reward for a correct response. It merely indicates to the learner when he has entered the desired state. After much practice he will be able to feel and attain this state without machines. We accept this kind of sensorimotor learning throughout life, for it is the way we learn to walk, talk and control our muscles—but the exact internal mechanisms for learning are not understood.\n\nUntil very recently, we assumed we were at the mercy of our involuntary nervous system. This notion helps to shape the self‐concept most of us have, and it has been encouraged by medicine and psychology. Physiologists a decade ago believed that we were regulated by two distinct nervous systems: one was the great outer brain that gives us voluntary control of muscles through tentacles of nerves that travel down the center of the spinal column. The other, lower brain, is called “autonomic” or “vegetative.” Its nerve fibers travel down the sides of the spinal cord and regulate survival functions, in the viscera, the heart, through emotional responses. These functions were held to be involuntary throughout the West—until the advent of biofeedback.\n\nMost people think they know how to control the voluntary muscles of their faces, arms and legs; but feedback instruments promise to greatly expand their powers. A dramatic innovation may come from the use of muscle feedback to train people to relax. Whenever muscle fibers contract, very small bioelectric potentials can be picked up by a metal‐disc electrode placed on the skin over the muscle. These infinitesimal potentials (around a millionth of a volt) are fed into an amplifier known as an electromyograph—or EMG machine. This fancy bit of hardware, which can be condensed to the size of a cookie box, incorporates circuitry that filters out irrelevant signals, amplifies the muscle potentials by about a million times and activates the signal —whenever fibers contract. The relaxing person can then “hear” the most insignificant changes in his muscle tension.\n\nIN the early nineteen‐sixties at the University of Colorado Medical School, two young psychologists, Thomas Budzynski and Johann Stoyva, began exploring the possibility of EMG feedback for headache sufferers and insomniacs. They began by testing healthy students. During each of 16 sessions the volunteer would lie on a comfortable bed, wearing earphones, with three electrodes strapped to his forehead. These were attached to the amplifier—EMG. Every time the forehead muscle contracted slightly, the person heard a tone in the earphones—the more he contracted the muscle, the higher the pitch; the more he relaxed, the lower the pitch. “Keep the tone down,” the volunteers were told. Within 20 minutes they approximately halved their original muscle tension. What did they do? They lay and listened. If they tried too hard to relax, they usually found they were tensing and heard the high‐pitched tone again. As they said later, they simply “let go.”\n\nDeep relaxation can be a profound experience. Some people have felt as if their relaxed arms were floating away from them, or as if their bodies had become as heavy as a bag of sand. Others have been surprised by reveries and distant memories. One research subject studied by Erik Peper was a young man with severe facial tics that were not helped by psychiatry or other therapies. He volunteered to try EMG feedback, anticipating, as most people do, that the relaxation would be pleasant, but not expecting an emotional experience. Using a portable machine (designed by Budzynski), he lay on a bed in a quiet room, wearing earphones which made a clicking sound for each contraction of his forehead muscle. About his first session, he said:\n\n“It started with my constant concentration on my back. I kept saying to myself relax back, relax back. Then I concentrated on the clicks. At that moment a whole new world was brought before me. I felt a deep warmth. I felt a very heavy feeling of sinking into the bed. I, for once, controlled my body movements, they did not control me.... I cried for happiness because I never felt I could conquer my bodily movements. I told myself, ‘Don't tic’ — and I didn't. I felt a completely calm feeling. The warmth of my body overwhelmed me.”\n\nALTHOUGH EMG feedback can be used for any muscle, the forehead muscle is particularly crucial. If a person can relax the frontalis, he will usually relax his scalp, neck and upper body. Budzynski and Stoyva had picked this muscle for their studies because it usually contracts when people are agitated or tense, although most people are not aware of it. More over, chronic tension in the scalp and neck muscles is responsible for severe tension headaches.\n\nIn 1969, an ad in the Denver papers brought a number of headache sufferers to the laboratory for training sessions twice a week. The volunteers had severe tension headaches every day or two, and were happy to practice daily relaxation at home. As they got into EMG feedback, they began to experience profound changes that often accompany deep relaxation. After about 14 sessions, most of them said they were free of headaches for the first time in years and no longer needed drugs. The others had learned to sense a headache coming on and would abort or dilute it by relaxing. The volunteers initially learned to sustain relaxation by means of the instrument, but then were able to detect the signs of tension in their daily lives and to counteract them. One former grammar‐school teacher, who had been forced to give up teaching because the kids gave her headaches, was able to resume her profession.\n\nThe pervasive effects of deep relaxation have been used by psychiatrists since the turn of the century. For instance, phobias are often treated by a procedure known as systematic desensitization, which first requires the patient to enter a deep relaxation state. In this procedure, which takes time and is thus costly, psychiatrists led patients in relaxation exercises, then gradually and systematically confronted them with the object of fear.\n\nRecently Dr. Budzynski and a number of other therapists have begun using EMG feedback to induce relaxation relatively rapidly. With his process, Budzynski reports that he has liberated a 22‐year‐old girl from an unbelievable list of phobias, including panic attacks, fear of heights, fear of crowds, fear of riding in cars, and claustrophobia. When systematically confronted with the feared images in a relaxed state, she gradually lost her intense feelings about them. It is almost impossible to remain highly anxious when deeply relaxed. Sometimes the feedback was used more specifically. For instance, one of Dr. Budzynski's patients was a young man from an Alpine ski team who froze at the starting gate but learned to relax his leg muscles by EMG feedback.\n\nInsomniacs have also come to the laboratory in Denver for lessons in falling asleep. First they learned to relax by using EMG feedback. Then they were wired to an electroencephalograph machine (EEG) and given feedback until they could generate the slow brain waves observed in the onset of sleep. With this training people who had taken four hours to fall asleep were dropping into slumber twice in a 20‐minute lab session. “I think doctors are going to lend patients an EMG machine instead of handing out sleeping pills in the future,” says Budzynski. Not only will miniaturized feedback instruments be used in clinics, but Budzynski foresees a time when frenetic corporations, law firms and television studios will have a cot and an EMG machine to permit quick naps and preventive medicine for harassed workers during the day.\n\nIN Seattle, Dr. George B. Whatmore employs EMG feedback to treat patients with serious psychosomatic illnesses, some of them so ill that they had been hospitalized. He theorizes that symptoms as different as colitis, backache, depression, circulatory illness and skin eruptions may all originate in sustained tension among groups of voluntary muscles.\n\nMost of us have some characteristic way of tensing up during stress, a tension so habitual that we generally are not aware of it. Whatmore has called this kind of tension “disponesis,” meaning an inappropriate expenditure of nervous and muscular energy. Much to the surprise of his patients, he locates this muscle tension during diagnosis, measuring the energy output from muscle contractions. Whatmore places a sensor on the skin over muscle groups, and informs the patient whenever he is tense. He has given prolonged feedback training to patients, sometimes lasting more than a year or two, and has made follow‐up studies of some of his patients for as long as 15 years.\n\nAlthough his theory is controversial, it may help people to understand how body habits may bring on psychosomatic illness. For example, a person who is mildly angry may brace his body as if ready for a fight; yet the movements are so small that he does not realize he is tensed for action. Anyone who typically holds his body rigid, on guard, is enhancing his own agitation, altering his chemistry, and disturbing such functions as digestion—perhaps preparing himself for ulcers. Middle‐aged patients who have come to Whatmore for help may have maintained habitual tensions for a lifetime. It is not surprising that they need protracted training to undo these habits.\n\nScientists are only beginning to plumb the possibilities of muscle feedback. A Denver hospital is trying the method to relax asthmatic patients and help them deflect their strangling attacks. At the University of California in Berkeley, psychologist Curtiss Hardyck reports success in liberating more than 100 exceedingly slow readers from their main hangup — subvocalization, or silent mouthing of words. Seated in a comfortable chair in an informal laboratory, with an electrode over the Adam's apple, the person would simply read a book for an hour. However, whenever he mouthed a word silently, his larynx would tense and a noise would switch on. He would try to keep the noise off. The rasping irritation of the noise was so unpleasant that slow‐reading children and adults would learn to abandon their habitual subvocalizing in about 45 minutes.\n\nNOT only do people learn muscle relaxation, but they are beginning to learn to control constriction and dilation of blood vessels with EMG feedback. The throbbing pain of a migraine is thought to come from the pressure in enlarged blood vessels in the head, which transmit each pulse of blood from the heart. By mentally altering the temperature (and blood flow) in their foreheads and hands, patients who have come to the Menninger Foundation in Topeka, Kan., seem to have learned to prevent headaches.\n\nTEMPERATURE control is only one of the many experimental feedback programs of Dr. Elmer Green and his wife, Alyce, of the Menninger Foundation. Recently, their colleague, Dr. Joseph Sargent, tried their method on 28 migraine. sufferers. Patients came to the quiet basement laboratory room, where they sat in an easy chair with one temperature‐sensitive electrode taped to a finger and another taped to the forehead. Before them on a table, was a meter that registered the difference between hand and forehead temperature. They were told to move the needle to the right, and were given some helping suggestions: “Your hand will feel very heavy. It will tingle. It feels warm.” In order to move the needle to the right the person had to raise hand temperature, which would mean dilating the blood vessels, which in turn required relaxation. Once the patients developed a kind of “feel” for raising hand temperature, they began finding that they could “abort” headaches by doing the same thing — wherever they were. At this writing, only 20 patients have completed their training, and 12 are distinct successes (5 were quick dropouts and 3 could not do it.)\n\nEven though it seems plausible that headaches and insomnia can be overcome by “mental” training, most people are taken aback to hear that they can similarly learn to control their heart rate and blood pressure. But there are reports of people who are doing it. The current clinical programs are limited and experimental. Still patients with serious cardiac disease are learning through feedback to control their symptoms.\n\nIn Baltimore City Hospital, Dr. Bernard Engel, a psychologist, has been collaborating with cardiac specialists in training patients who suffer from a dangerous irregularity of heart beat—PVC, premature contraction of the left ventricle, the main pumping chamber of the heart. It is an arrhythmia that often follows a major heart attack.\n\nThe first eight patients each spent 30 sessions in the hospital laboratory. They lay in a soundproofed room with two electrodes taped to their chest that fed the electrical signal generated by each heart beat into a cardiotachometer, which would put out an electric signal proportionate to the heart rate. This, in turn, would trigger a light at the foot of the bed. The patient first spent 10 minutes or so lying quietly, while his base‐line heart rate was recorded. Then a device would be preset so that if he slowed (or, in some sessions, accelerated) his pulse beyond this base line, he would see a yellow light at the foot of the bed, a sign that he was doing the “right thing.” Two other lights guided him, telling him whether he was supposed to slow or accelerate his heart rate. A green light meant he should speed up his heart rate, while the red light meant slow down.\n\nThe training was not rapid. The patient spent 10 sessions of about 80 minutes each speeding up his heart rate, and then the same amount of time slowing it down. Then he had to learn to alternate between fast and slow heart rate, and finally to change his heart rate on command but without feedback — as he would do at home. The entire procedure had been worked out by Dr. Engel and his associates in previous research with normal people, and he was pleased to report that four of his first eight arrhythmic patients were able to control their symptoms at home.\n\nJust what they thought or felt in order to recognize their own premature contractions and change the rate is something of a mystery. When Dr. Engel asked them how they accelerated heart rate, one woman replied that she imagined a swing, while another thought about arguments with her children and running down a dark street; yet another woman said she relaxed, and a man imagined pushing his heart to the left. Their mental imagery was conflicting and confusing, but the fact remained—they were preventing their arrhythmias at home.\n\nFeedback training may be fundamentally tedious, and may require a long time, but unlike drugs it gives the patient a sense of mastery over his own body. One of the women in Dr. Engel's group was elated when she could report that she no longer had dizzy spells or thumping in her chest because of her own ability to cope with the symptoms.\n\nABOUT 25 million people in the United States today suffer from hypertension, a form of high blood pressure that often leads to strokes and heart attacks. The cause is mostly unknown, but psychological factors seem to be important. Recently, at Johns Hopkins University, baboons have been placed in a situation so stressful that they developed irreversible high blood pressure after two weeks. Because high blood pressure can damage arteries and blood vessels, one of the main aims of drug treatment is to keep pressure down. Now it appears that a person can learn to lower his own blood pressure mentally. Feedback has been used to train hypertensive patients at Rockefeller University in New York, Lafayette Clinic in Detroit and the Harvard University Medical School. At Harvard, Dr. Herbert Benson is exploring a method of feedback that has already enabled five of his seven patients to lower their blood pressure considerably in the laboratory. Dr. Benson's patients came to the lab daily for two to three weeks. The feedback instrument and methods had been worked out by an ingenious psychologistphysiologist team, Dr. David Shapiro and Bernard Tursky, in another laboratory of the\n\nBefore their method was extended to hypertensive patients, they had found through exhaustive studies that normal people could attain superb control over both heart rate and blood pressure, independently of one another. Sitting in a comfortable chair, in an experimental booth wired to the feedback equipment, some volunteers mentally boosted their blood pressure alarmingly high, as if they had just run the 100yard dash. It was plain that a person might do himself considerable damage just by thinking. They could also do the opposite, and perhaps undo destructive habits—as Benson found with his patients. The tedious two or three weeks of laboratory training was making inroads on self‐destructive emotional reactions. The patients even began to remark that they felt more relaxed when they lowered their blood pressure. Nevertheless, as Dr. Benson notes, to generalize this training—and keep blood pressure down at home and at the office—may require some revision of behavior and even re‐evaluation of life style, as well as some professional behavior therapy.\n\nIN hope of reconciling themselves to a chaotic and nerveracking environment, many apparently healthy young stulents have turned to feedback of a different variety. Seekers of internal peace, of head trips, inner happiness, kids in need of serenity and in search of salvation have trooped to the laboratories that do research in “EEG feedback.” The EEG machine, an electroencephalograph, is an amplifier system that receives very small shifts in electric potential that occur within the brain and are detected by electrodes on the surface of the head. The changing patterns of the brain waves are not understood, but seem to represent continuous shifts within brain cells from positive to negative charge. The bioelectric shifts, mightily amplified, drive a row of inked pens on old‐fashioned laboratory machines. Each pen, moved by a signal from a part of the brain, swings up when the charge is negative and down whe'n it is positive. As a continuous sheet of graph paper slides beneath the oscillating pens, the upand‐down pen movements are traced out as brain waves. Thus brain waves are an artifact of the way we record brain activity—a convenience, not of nature.\n\nFor convenience, the common brain‐wave patterns observed in normal people during waking and sleep have been divided into categories, according to the speed of change (frequency) and the amount of voltage in the change (amplitude). When a person is awake, the voltage is very low, and waves are typically irregular and changing fast — high frequency. However, as a person relaxes, perhaps unfocusing his eyes and drifting for a moment, the irregular scrawl on the EEG paper will show a burst of regular waves somewhere between 8 and 13 cycles per second, of high voltage (maybe 60 microvolts). This rhythm, which is observed occasionally in sleep, and during yoga and Zen meditation, is known as the alpha rhythm. Because it has been recorded in people while they were experiencing pleasurable relaxation or meditation states — and because industry is exploiting the fad — a cult has been growing up around the “alpha state.”\n\nEEG feedback began in the nineteen‐sixties in a number of laboratories—for different purposes. The man who is primarily associated with alpha feedback is the observant and pensive Joe Kamiya, a psychologist at the Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute in San Francisco. Kamiya became something of a pop hero to kids who hoped to groove their way into an instant satori.\n\nWhile trying to extract dream memories from inarticulate laboratory subjects at the University of Chicago, Kamiya began to ask himself how people ever learned to describe their inner experience in language. Taking a long shot, he decided he would find out what people described when they produced a particular brain‐wave pattern. The alpha rhythm was particularly convenient, and Kamiya's first task was to teach his volunteers how to recognize alpha and sustain it. He pasted electrodes on their heads, connected, them with the EEG machine, on which he had set a filter for the person's particular alpha frequency, so that their alpha would automatically ring a soft bell. Although his first subjects were not meditators, or hip people, he found that they could quickly learn to keep the bell on by sustaining their alpha. Or, on instruction, they could turn it off. Some people learned to slow down their alpha waves to make a tone lower its pitch, and some could make the rhythms faster. Similarly, a few people could produce higher voltage alpha, as well as reduce the voltage.\n\nIt may sound easy, but many adults find EEG feedback exasperating at first. After considerable anticipation, volunteers in the typical experiment are finally seated in a soundproof chamber with electrodes pasted around their scalps, and their only task in the quiet is to keep a tone on. The harder they try, the less they hear the tone. It is the typical Zen paradox. What does one do? One person whose quest for alpha was successful reported: “I try to forget I'm trying and let myself drift, and the moment formulate what is happening, in order to remember, to tell it to the experimenter—that moment my experience fragments and the tone ceases.”\n\nWhat was the alpha experience of Kamiya's volunteers? Briefly, it was a vast range of mildly pleasurable and usually innocuous reveries and feelings that are often described as a “passive alertness.” Laboratories around the country subsequently offered an array of descriptions. Tranquillity was common, but not universal. In the silence and darkness of an experimental chamber at the Bedford (Mass.) Veterans Administration Hospital, a few people felt themselves floating in space, beyond all the usual dimensions of time. On Long Island, in the laboratory of Lester Fehmi at Stony Brook, artist:: and musicians reported they could enter states of intense creativity by sustaining alpha.\n\nALPHA, beta, theta and delta waves roughly indicate a range of brain states from rest to high alertness. In trying to pin down the state represented by alpha, researchers’ lives are complicated by the fact that alpha rhythms do not signify the same state if they are taken from electrodes at the back of the head rather than the front or side of the head. To make matters worse, brain waves from the right and left hemispheres are not always identical. Indeed, there is considerable evidence that the two hemispheres have different functions, the left hemisphere being verbal, rational and analytic, while the right is predominant in nonverbal, subjective and emotional matters.\n\nIn more than a decade of research, Dr. Kamiya found that most of his volunteers were delighted and rested by their stint of alpha feedback. But he and other scientists have found that while some subjects groove, others merely fall asleep. The problem of mapping internal states and of developing a language to describe them has exasperated most psychologists because the commonalities are so hard to find.\n\nOnly a clever experiment done by Dr. Barbara Brovin at the Sepulveda Veterans Administration Hospital near Los Angeles definitely shows that different EEG states must have subconscious associations. Dr. Brown arranged her apparatus so that her subjects’ alpha waves would trigger a colored light while the EEG's of the usual alert waking state, usually known as beta waves, triggered a different color. After the feedback session she asked subjects to sort a deck of descriptive words of each color. Those who saw blue during alpha associated the word with “calm,” “peaceful,” “pleasant.” Most people associated “red” with “angry,” “irritated,” “impatient.”\n\nBut when alpha triggered the red light, the color red began to be associated with calm. This reversal of our usual color bias suggests that we do indeed experience certain feelings in alpha states, and other feelings accompany beta and other EEG states.\n\nDr. Thomas Mulholland. a psychologist at the V.A. hospital in Bedford who has experimented with EEG feedback since 1961, does not see alpha feedback as a gateway to expanded consciousness but as a potential diagnostic tool. Mulholland has used feedback to evaluate visual attention, a technique that may be useful in diagnosing brain‐damaged veterans and children with perceptual problems. He has been interested in the fact that a person can watch pictures projected be fore him or keep his eyes on a light while maintaining alpha rhythms, but that the moment he focuses his attention and his eyes on something, alpha vanishes. Thus disappearance of the alpha rhythm could be a means of knowing when a person was paying visual attention.\n\nErik Peper, who did most of his own feedback studies in the Bedford laboratory, has run a study with a similar format in which the volunteer's alpha waves automatically triggered a slide projector, which would show a picture of either a nude or a flower. Most men paid attention, focused, and thus stopped emitting any alpha the moment the nude came on the screen (cessation of alpha automatically caused the nude to disappear). But there was one man who continued to show alpha despite the nude on the screen, and who showed attention when the flower appeared. Peper thought his experiment had failed until he talked to the volunteer. He turned out to be a satiated newlywed who saw enough nudity at night and paid no attention to it. He was also a horticulturist and was intrigued by the flower because it was unfamiliar to him. So he kept peering at the slide in an attempt to identify it whenever It flashed the\n\nIn Mulholland's laboratory, and wherever EEG feedback is studied, unpaid, uninvited volunteers go to great lengths for the opportunity to tune into alpha. Erik Peper was once awakened at 2 A.M. by a student from California offering to be a research subject. Around New York University one occasionally sees a student striding through Wash ington Square wearing a headset with earphones—listening to a tone signifying alpha. Compact, portable, batteryrun instruments are abundant. Unlike the costly lab instrument, a home model may sell for $129.\n\nThere is a lot of quackery in this field. Advertisements for the gullible even use feedback terminology without feedback instruments, like this one for a weight‐reduction system: “With alpha control you receive perfect balance and your excess weight drops off.” The better instruments are usually byproducts of research, and some are costly. Purchasers usually fail to realize several important facts: First, feedback, like exercise and dieting, becomes effective only when experienced for a prolonged period. Moreover, inexpensive instruments are a technical compromise, and a person may be getting feedback for eyeball movements, blinks, or some brain‐wave pattern when he thinks his feedback is for alpha. Despite such drawbacks, the devices are hot sellers among an introspective generation.\n\nOF course, the skilled yogis who were mastering their autonomic nervous systems some 200 years ago in India had no need of electronic devices. As reported by British colonists, some yogis could reduce their metabolism while buried alive for days; or reduce pulse volume so that their hearts seemed to have stopped; or walk on fire without blistering; or lie comfortably on nail points, or pierce their flesh with swords, bloodlessly, and with no signs of pain.\n\nElmer and Alyce Green have taken a unique and imaginative approach to understanding some of these phenomena with biofeedback. The Greens, who have done yoga exercises for many years, are sensitive to the subtle relationships of body and mind. In 1970 they and their associates worked with the virtuoso yogi, Swami Rama, formerly an associate Shankaracharya (a rank somewhat analogous among Hindus to Pope). The swami, an engaging man in his mid‐40's from southern India who had been training in yoga since the age of 4, offered to stop his heart from pumping blood In the laboratory for three minutes. The Greens assured him that 10 seconds would be more than enough. The swami concentrated, and for 17 seconds his EKG (electrocardiogram) showed 300 beats a minute; these rapid contractions, known as atrial fibrillation, mean that the heart can no longer pump the necessary volume of blood—a critical state, which, if not reversed, will be fatal.\n\nFalse yogis slow down their hearts not by mental powers but with a chest lock that prevents normal blood flow to the heart. How do Swami Rama and other yogis alter heart rate and blood flow without compressing their chests?\n\nRoughly speaking, yoga has many aspects, one of which consists of exercises that slowly build a person's ability to concentrate, control respiration and musculature, aiming toward a healthful and sensitive balance in the nervous system. Exercises are directed toward toning the nervous system at levels or centers known as chakras. But the key to greater skill and autonomic control may He in the progressively quiet stages of meditation. People in biofeedback experiments have sometimes noticed, in the quiet, that they have heard the booming of their own hearts or were acutely aware of their respiration. Some of those in isolation experiments have sometimes been frightened by the bubbling commotion within them. They had never felt it before. Perhaps meditation can silence a person enough so that he begins to feel his internal processes, as he could not feel them during the activity of ordinary life.\n\nFor a number of years psychologists attempted to train animals in autonomic control. One of the most articulate advocates of this research approach was Dr. Neal Miller, a physiological psychologist at Rockefeller University. Until recently, however, all these attempts failed. Then Leo DiCara (now at the University of Michigan) immobilized animals with curare. The experiments with this paralyzing drug were a fortunate strategy that allowed Miller and DiCara to condition rats to alter blood flow and heart rate. Perhaps because they were stilled by the curare—and thus able to feel subtle processes going on within them — the rats learned to control intestinal contractions or blood pressure. Some learned to change the thickness of their stomach walls, while others were conditioned to dilate some and constrict other blood vessels, so that they could turn one ear bright pink and the other white simultaneously.\n\nTHE culmination of these years of team research seems to be that if you learn to alter such a function as your heart rate you are also biasing your subsequent ability to adapt to stress and changing your chemistry. Drs. Leo DiCara and Jay Weiss found that the animals trained to accelerate heart rate could not subsequently learn a shock‐avoidance task efficiently. The animals became hyperexcitable and leaped into the air squealing pathetically when shocked on the tail. By contrast animals that were conditioned to slow their pulse rate learned an avoidance task far more efficiently and reacted more normally to shock. DiCara, a brilliant research strategist, may be on the way to showing us how our habitual emotional responses train habits of body that could influence behavior in a vicious circle—accentuating the anxieties that create the diseases that eventually kill us. Life might be altogether different for middle‐aged people, were we taught autonomic control in kindergarten, for the habits of tension that may evolve into disease might be caught early and prevented.\n\nThe Greens’ studies of Swami Rama indicate the potential extent of control over our physiology and nervous systems. They used EEG feedback, giving the swami a signal when he entered a state that they wanted to explore, for there was no way of describing in words the brainwave states they wanted him to demonstrate. Wearing electrodes and hooked to the EEG, he went through his repertoire and came to the pattern (four to seven cycles per second) known as theta. When asked to produce more theta and sustain it, he did so with no difficulty. He described it as a “noisy” state in which memory fragments from his deep unconscious came bubbling to the surface. Theta is sometimes observed during dreaming, but it is supposedly seen only in the EEG's of children who are awake, and almost never in an adult who is awake, unless he is pathological. Using biofeedback, the Greens subsequently trained other normal adults, volunteers in the laboratory, to produce and sustain theta —thus shattering another myth about normal EEG patterns and what they signify. Our idea of a “normal” EEG record is based upon the particular, limited, habitual use that a person makes of his brain. Swami Rama's agile and controlled transitions from one state of consciousness to another would, no doubt, be considered abnormal.\n\nBy the convention of sleep researchers, our deepest, most oblivious slumber is characterized by EEG patterns known as delta waves—very slow, high amplitude waves (about 300 microvolts, at a frequency of about one wave per second). It is very hard to arouse a person from this stage of sleep, and usually people seem a little disoriented if awakened rapidly. Swami Rama, who called this state “yogi sleep,” could enter it at will. He did so in the laboratory, producing an EEG record much like deepest sleep with 40 per cent delta waves.\n\nWhile he was in this sleep and snoring gently, Alyce Green softly repeated a number of phrases, such as, “It is raining today, but tomorrow the sun will shine.” When he awakened, Swami Rama recited 85 per cent of the phrases verbatim and paraphrased the rest. Most people remember nothing that is said in the room while they are deeply asleep. Yet Swami llama's ability to be aware during deep sleep—and recall later—reopens the possibility that sleep learning could be effective.\n\nWhat we call normal waking consciousness is a limited state. Because we cannot remember what happened in other states, we may be losing a sizable fraction of significant experience, which may in fact influence us whether we remember it consciously or not. Anesthesiologists are now aware that patients in deep barbiturate anesthesia have sometimes been able to repeat later on what was said by surgeons in the operating theater. Could biofeedback help us to learn how to retrieve the meaningful events that infiltrated our unconscious while we were anesthetized or asleep?\n\nOur bad habits are built over the years, however, and selfmastery, unlike pill popping, takes time—even with feedback equipment. The first people to take full advantage of feedback technology will have to have some small spirit of persistence. They may use EMG feedback as an aid to sleep, or to introspection, or to creative tasks. People with cold feet from poor circulation may use temperature feedback, which has worked for at least one case of Reynaud's disease. Some people will use instruments that will awaken them during nightly dreams, giving them access to the mirrored hallways of their own usually forgotten nighttime fantasies. “In five years,” predicts Dr. Barbara Brown, “there will be biofeedback centers all over the country, in which people can learn all manner of mind and body functions.”"
