He had a heart of gold and was loved by all that knew him. We will be getting together to celebrate his life 2:00 PM Sunday, August 17, 2008 at the Eagles Club on 3 rd Ave in Wausau . All family, friends and people who knew him are welcome.\n\nHe was a biological father to one and a fill in father to many. He is survived by his son, Jordan; and by his siblings, June (Nick) Vangalis, David, Rita (Myron) Wisnewski, Gary, Lori (Bill) Gillingham, Linda K, Jimmy Z, Shawny, Terry, Rachel and many treasured and devoted friends.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his mother, Nancy (Kelch); father, Lloyd; and numerous nieces and nephews.\n\nTom, even in death, will go on helping others as an organ donor. His family and friends would like to thank the wonderful caretakers at Aspirus for their help. In lieu of flowers, a memorial fund has been set up in Tomâ€™s name at M&I Bank.\n\nWe all love and will miss you Tom!!"
