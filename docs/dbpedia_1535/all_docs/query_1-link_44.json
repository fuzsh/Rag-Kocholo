C.\n\n1972-01-01\n\nAbsolute cross sections were measured for the excitation of the N I(1134, 1164, 1168, 1200, 1243, and 1743 A) multiplets by electron impact on atomic nitrogen. The presence of vibrationally excited molecular nitrogen in the discharged gas was confirmed, and its effect on the measurements is discussed. The ratio of the oscillator strengths of the 1200 and 1134 A resonance transitions is presented, as well as the branching ratio for the N I(1311/1164 A) multiplets. Striking differences in the distribution of intensity between the spectra of atomic nitrogen and molecular nitrogen excited by energetic electrons suggest an optical method for measuring the density of atomic nitrogen in the upper atmosphere.\n\nThe Kinetics of Nitrogen Atom Recombination\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBrown, G.

The noble gas bombardment generates nanoscale texture surfaces and stress in the material. The atomic attrition increases nitrogen diffusion at lower temperatures than the ones normally used in standard processes. The stress causes binding energy shifts of the Xe 3d{sub 5/2} electron core level. The heavy ion bombardment control of the texture and stress of the material surfaces may be applied to several plasma processes where diffusing species are involved.\n\nNitrogen termination of single crystal (100) diamond surface by radio frequency N{sub 2} plasma process: An in-situ x-ray photoemission spectroscopy and secondary electron emission studies\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nChandran, Maneesh, E-mail: maneesh@tx.technion.ac.il, E-mail: choffman@tx.technion.ac.il; Shasha, Michal; Michaelson, Shaul\n\n2015-09-14\n\nIn this letter, we report the electronic and chemical properties of nitrogen terminated (N-terminated) single crystal (100) diamond surface, which is a promising candidate for shallow NV{sup â} centers. N-termination is realized by an indirect RF nitrogen plasma process without inducing a large density of surface defects. Thermal stability and electronic property of N-terminated diamond surface are systematically investigated under well-controlled conditions by in-situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and secondary electron emission. An increase in the low energy cut-off of the secondary electron energy distribution curve (EDC), with respect to a bare diamond surface, indicates a positive electron affinity of themoreÂ Â» N-terminated diamond. Exposure to atomic hydrogen results in reorganization of N-terminated diamond to H-terminated diamond, which exhibited a negative electron affinity surface. The change in intensity and spectral features of the secondary electron EDC of the N-terminated diamond is discussed.Â«Â less\n\nReactivity of amino acid anions with nitrogen and oxygen atoms.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Zhe-Chen; Li, Ya-Ke; He, Sheng-Gui; Bierbaum, Veronica M\n\n2018-02-14\n\nFor many decades, astronomers have searched for biological molecules, including amino acids, in the interstellar medium; this endeavor is important for investigating the hypothesis of the origin of life from space. The space environment is complex and atomic species, such as nitrogen and oxygen atoms, are widely distributed. In this work, the reactions of eight typical deprotonated amino acids (glycine, alanine, cysteine, proline, aspartic acid, histidine, tyrosine, and tryptophan) with ground state nitrogen and oxygen atoms are studied by experiment and theory. These amino acid anions do not react with nitrogen atoms. However, the reactions of these ions with oxygen atoms show an intriguing variety of ionic products and the reaction rate constants are of the order of 10 -10 cm 3 s -1 . Density functional calculations provide detailed mechanisms of the reactions, and demonstrate that spin conversion is essential for some processes. Our study provides important data and insights for understanding the kinetic and dynamic behavior of amino acids in space environments.\n\nAtomic Oxygen (AO) and Nitrogen (AN) In-situ Flux Sensor\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2016-03-10\n\nAFRL-AFOSR-VA-TR-2016-0126 DURIP 09) AN ATOMIC OXYGEN FLUX MONITOR FOR USE IN THE SEARCH FOR NEW AND BETT Malcolm Beasley LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR UNIV...Grant # FA9550-01-1-0433 M.

The conformational inversion (ring-flip) and nitrogen-atom inversion (N-inversion) energetics were studied by variable-temperature NMR spectroscopy and computations. The steric bulk of the nitrogen-atom substituent was found to affect both the conformation of the azepine ring and the geometry around the nitrogen atom. Also affected were the Gibbs free energy barriers for the ring-flip and the N-inversion. When the nitrogen-atom substituent was alkyl, as in 2a-c, the geometry of the nitrogen atom was nearly planar and the azepine ring was highly puckered; the result was a relatively high-energy barrier to ring-flip and a low barrier to N-inversion. Conversely, when the nitrogen-atom substituent was a hydrogen atom, as in 2d, 4, and 6, the nitrogen atom was significantly pyramidalized and the azepine ring was less puckered; the result here was a relatively high energy barrier to N-inversion and a low barrier to ring-flip. In these N-unsubstituted compounds, it was found computationally that the lowest-energy stereodynamic process was ring-flip coupled with N-inversion, as N-inversion alone had a much higher energy barrier.\n\nAtomic cobalt on nitrogen-doped graphene for hydrogen generation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFei, Huilong; Dong, Juncai; Arellano-JimÃ©nez, M.

Here we report an electrocatalyst for hydrogen generation based on very small amounts of cobalt dispersed as individual atoms on nitrogen-doped graphene. This catalyst is robust and highly active in aqueous media with very low overpotentials (30âmV). A variety of analytical techniques and electrochemical measurements suggest that the catalytically active sites are associated with the metal centres coordinated to nitrogen. This unusual atomic constitution of supported metals is suggestive of a new approach to preparing extremely efficient single-atom catalysts.

Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy indicate that the well-defined nanoribbons tend to align with the neighbors side-by-side with a band gap of 1.02âeV, which is in good agreement with the density functional theory calculation result. The influence of the high precursor coverage on the quality of the nanoribbons is also studied. We find that graphene nanoribbons with sufficient aspect ratios can only be fabricated at sub-monolayer precursor coverage. This work provides a way to construct atomically precisemoreÂ Â» nitrogen-doped graphene nanoribbons.Â«Â less\n\nElectronic structure of graphene nanoribbons doped with nitrogen atoms: a theoretical insight.\n\nPubMed\n\nTorres, A E; Fomine, S\n\n2015-04-28\n\nThe electronic structure of graphene nanoribbons doped with a graphitic type of nitrogen atoms has been studied using B3LYP, B2PLYP and CAS methods. In all but one case the restricted B3LYP solutions were unstable and the CAS calculations provided evidence for the multiconfigurational nature of the ground state with contributions from two dominant configurations. The relative stability of the doped nanoribbons depends mostly on the mutual position of the dopant atoms and notably less on the position of nitrogen atoms within the nanoribbon. N-graphitic doping affects cationic states much more than anionic ones due the participation of the nitrogen atoms in the stabilization of the positive charge, resulting in a drop in ionization energies (IPs) for N-graphitic doped systems. Nitrogen atoms do not participate in the negative charge stabilization of anionic species and, therefore, the doping does not affect the electron affinities (EAs). The unrestricted B3LYP method is the method of choice for the calculation of IPs and EAs. Restricted B3LYP and B2PLYP produces unreliable results for both IPs and EAs while CAS strongly underestimates the electron affinities. This is also true for the reorganization energies where restricted B3LYP produces qualitatively incorrect results. Doping changes the reorganization energy of the nanoribbons; the hole reorganization energy is generally higher than the corresponding electron reorganization energy due to the participation of nitrogen atoms in the stabilization of the positive charge.\n\nCollisional-radiative nonequilibrium in partially ionized atomic nitrogen\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKunc, J.

Populations of 14 atomic levels and line intensities are calculated in plasma with T(e) = 8000-15,000 K and N(t) = 10 to the 12th - 10 to the 18th/cu cm. Transport of radiation is included by coupling the rate equations of production of the electrons and excited atoms with the radiation escape factors, which are not constant but depend on plasma conditions.\n\nProduction mechanism of atomic nitrogen in atmospheric pressure pulsed corona discharge measured using two-photon absorption laser-induced fluorescence\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nTeramoto, Yoshiyuki; Ono, Ryo; Oda, Tetsuji\n\nTo study the production mechanism of atomic nitrogen, the temporal profile and spatial distribution of atomic nitrogen are measured in atmospheric pressure pulsed positive corona discharge using two-photon absorption laser-induced fluorescence. The absolute atomic nitrogen density in the streamer filaments is estimated from decay rate of atomic nitrogen in N{sub 2} discharge. The results indicate that the absolute atomic nitrogen density is approximately constant against discharge energy. When the discharge voltage is 21.5 kV, production yield of atomic nitrogen produced by an N{sub 2} discharge pulse is estimated to be 2.9 - 9.8 Multiplication-Sign 10{sup 13} atoms and the energymoreÂ Â» efficiency of atomic nitrogen production is estimated to be about 1.8 - 6.1 Multiplication-Sign 10{sup 16} atoms/J. The energy efficiency of atomic nitrogen production in N{sub 2} discharge is constant against the discharge energy, while that in N{sub 2}/O{sub 2} discharge increases with discharge energy. In the N{sub 2}/O{sub 2} discharge, two-step process of N{sub 2} dissociation plays significant role for atomic nitrogen production.Â«Â less\n\nElectrochemical CO 2 Reduction with Atomic Iron-Dispersed on Nitrogen-Doped Graphene\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nZhang, Chenhao; Yang, Shize; Wu, Jingjie; ...\n\n2018-03-25\n\nElectrochemical reduction of CO 2 provides an opportunity to reach a carbon-neutral energy recycling regime, in which CO 2 emissions from fuel use are collected and converted back to fuels. The reduction of CO 2 to CO is the first step toward the synthesis of more complex carbon-based fuels and chemicals. Therefore, understanding this step is crucial for the development of high-performance electrocatalyst for CO 2 conversion to higher order products such as hydrocarbons. In this paper, atomic iron dispersed on nitrogen-doped graphene (Fe/NG) is synthesized as an efficient electrocatalyst for CO 2 reduction to CO. Fe/NG has a lowmoreÂ Â» reduction overpotential with high Faradic efficiency up to 80%. The existence of nitrogen-confined atomic Fe moieties on the nitrogen-doped graphene layer is confirmed by aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure analysis.

Finally, the CO 2 reduction reaction mechanism on atomic Fe surrounded by four N atoms (FeâN 4) embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene is further investigated through density functional theory calculations, revealing a possible promotional effect of nitrogen doping on graphene.Â«Â less\n\nElectrochemical CO 2 Reduction with Atomic Iron-Dispersed on Nitrogen-Doped Graphene\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nZhang, Chenhao; Yang, Shize; Wu, Jingjie\n\nElectrochemical reduction of CO 2 provides an opportunity to reach a carbon-neutral energy recycling regime, in which CO 2 emissions from fuel use are collected and converted back to fuels.

Most nitrogen is expected to be partitioned among atomic nitrogen (N I), molecular nitrogen (N_2), and icy N-bearing molecules, such as NH_3 and N_2. N I is not directly observable in the cold gas. In this paper, we propose an indirect way to constrain the amount of N I in the cold gas of star-forming clouds, via deuteration in ammonia ice, the [ND2H/NH2D]/[NH2D/NH3] ratio. Using gas-ice astrochemical simulations, we show that if atomic nitrogen remains as the primary reservoir of nitrogen during cold ice formation stages, the [ND2H/NH2D]/[NH2D/NH3] ratio is close to the statistical value of 1/3 and lower than unity, whereas if atomic nitrogen is largely converted into N-bearing molecules, the ratio should be larger than unity. Observability of ammonia isotopologues in the inner hot regions around low-mass protostars, where ammonia ice has sublimated, is also discussed. We conclude that the [ND2H/NH2D]/[NH2D/NH3] ratio can be quantified using a combination of Very Large Array and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations with reasonable integration times, at least towards IRAS 16293-2422, where high molecular column densities are expected.\n\nAuNx stabilization with interstitial nitrogen atoms: A Density Functional Theory Study\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nQuintero, J. H.; Gonzalez-Hernandez, R.; Ospina, R.; MariÃ±o, A.\n\n2017-06-01\n\nResearchers have been studying 4d and 5d Series Transition Metal Nitrides lately as a result of the experimental production of AuN, PtN, CuN. In this paper, we used the Density Functional Theory (DFT) implementing a pseudopotential plane-wave method to study the incorporation of nitrogen atoms in the face-centered cube (fcc) lattice of gold (Au). First, we took the fcc structure of gold, and gradually located the nitrogen atoms in tetrahedral (TH) and octahedral (OH) interstitial sites. AuN stabilized in: 2OH (30%), 4OH and 4TH (50%), 4OH - 2TH (close to the wurtzite structure) and 6TH (60%). This leads us to think that AuN behaves like a Transition Metal Nitride since the nitrogen atoms look for tetrahedral sites.\n\nEnergetic Metastable Oxygen and Nitrogen Atoms in the Terrestrial Atmosphere\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKharchenko, Vasili; Dalgarno, A.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThis report summarizes our research performed under NASA Grant NAG5-11857. The three-year grant have been supported by the Geospace Sciences SR&T program. We have investigated the energetic metastable oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the terrestrial stratosphere, mesosphere and thermosphere. Hot atoms in the atmosphere are produced by solar radiation, the solar wind and various ionic reactions. Nascent hot atoms arise in ground and excited electronic states, and their translational energies are larger by two - three orders of magnitude than the thermal energies of the ambient gas. The relaxation kinetics of hot atoms determines the rate of atmospheric heating, the intensities of aeronomic reactions, and the rate of atom escape from the planet. Modeling of the non-Maxwellian energy distributions of metastable oxygen and nitrogen atoms have been focused on the determination of their impact on the energetics and chemistry of the terrestrial atmosphere between 25 and 250 km . At this altitudes, we have calculated the energy distribution functions of metastable O and N atoms and computed non-equilibrium rates of important aeronomic reactions, such as destruction of the water molecules by O(1D) atoms and production of highly excited nitric oxide molecules. In the upper atmosphere, the metastable O(lD) and N(2D) play important role in formation of the upward atomic fluxes. We have computed the upward fluxes of the metastable and ground state oxygen atoms in the upper atmosphere above 250 km. The accurate distributions of the metastable atoms have been evaluated for the day and night-time conditions.\n\nStrategy for designing stable and powerful nitrogen-rich high-energy materials by introducing boron atoms.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, Wen-Jie; Chi, Wei-Jie; Li, Quan-Song; Li, Ze-Sheng\n\n2017-06-01\n\nOne of the most important aims in the development of high-energy materials is to improve their stability and thus ensure that they are safe to manufacture and transport. In this work, we theoretically investigated open-chain N 4 B 2 isomers using density functional theory in order to find the best way of stabilizing nitrogen-rich molecules. The results show that the boron atoms in these isomers are aligned linearly with their neighboring atoms, which facilitates close packing in the crystals of these materials. Upon comparing the energies of nine N 4 B 2 isomers, we found that the structure with alternating N and B atoms had the lowest energy. Structures with more than one nitrogen atom between two boron atoms had higher energies. The energy of N 4 B 2 increases by about 50Â kcal/mol each time it is rearranged to include an extra nitrogen atom between the two boron atoms. More importantly, our results also show that boron atoms stabilize nitrogen-rich molecules more efficiently than carbon atoms do. Also, the combustion of any isomer of N 4 B 2 releases more heat than the corresponding isomer of N 4 C 2 does under well-oxygenated conditions. Our study suggests that the three most stable N 4 B 2 isomers (BN13, BN24, and BN34) are good candidates for high-energy molecules, and it outlines a new strategy for designing stable boron-containing high-energy materials. Graphical abstract The structural characteristics, thermodynamic stabilities, and exothermic properties of nitrogen-rich N 4 B 2 isomers were investigated by means of density functional theory.\n\nEmpirical model of atomic nitrogen in the upper thermosphere\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nEngebretson, M.

O.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nAtomic nitrogen number densities in the upper thermosphere measured by the open source neutral mass spectrometer (OSS) on Atmosphere Explorer-C during 1974 and part of 1975 have been used to construct a global empirical model at an altitude of 375 km based on a spherical harmonic expansion. The most evident features of the model are large diurnal and seasonal variations of atomic nitrogen and only a moderate and latitude-dependent density increase during periods of geomagnetic activity. Maximum and minimum N number densities at 375 km for periods of low solar activity are 3.6 x 10 to the 6th/cu cm at 1500 LST (local solar time) and low latitude in the summer hemisphere and 1.5 x 10 to the 5th/cu cm at 0200 LST at mid-latitudes in the winter hemisphere.\n\nSingle- and double-photoionization cross sections of atomic nitrogen from threshold to 31 A\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSamson, James A.

The results have been made absolute by normalization to one-half of the molecular nitrogen cross section at short wavelengths. The smoothed atomic nitrogen cross sections sigma can be accurately represented, at short wavelengths, by the equation sigma(Mb) = 36,700 x (E exp-2.3) as a function of the photon energy E (eV), thereby allowing the cross sections to be extrapolated to the nitrogen K edge at 31 A.\n\nTheoretical realization of cluster-assembled hydrogen storage materials based on terminated carbon atomic chains.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Chun-Sheng; An, Hui; Guo, Ling-Ju; Zeng, Zhi; Ju, Xin\n\n2011-01-14\n\nThe capacity of carbon atomic chains with different terminations for hydrogen storage is studied using first-principles density functional theory calculations. Unlike the physisorption of H(2) on the H-terminated chain, we show that two Li (Na) atoms each capping one end of the odd- or even-numbered carbon chain can hold ten H(2) molecules with optimal binding energies for room temperature storage. The hybridization of the Li 2p states with the H(2)Ï orbitals contributes to the H(2) adsorption. However, the binding mechanism of the H(2) molecules on Na arises only from the polarization interaction between the charged Na atom and the H(2). Interestingly, additional H(2) molecules can be bound to the carbon atoms at the chain ends due to the charge transfer between Li 2s2p (Na 3s) and C 2p states. More importantly, dimerization of these isolated metal-capped chains does not affect the hydrogen binding energy significantly. In addition, a single chain can be stabilized effectively by the C(60) fullerenes termination. With a hydrogen uptake of â¼10 wt.% on Li-coated C(60)-C(n)-C(60) (n = 5, 8), the Li(12)C(60)-C(n)-Li(12)C(60) complex, keeping the number of adsorbed H(2) molecules per Li and stabilizing the dispersion of individual Li atoms, can serve as better building blocks of polymers than the (Li(12)C(60))(2) dimer. These findings suggest a new route to design cluster-assembled hydrogen storage materials based on terminated sp carbon chains.\n\nPhotoionization research on atomic radiation. 3: The ionization cross section of atomic nitrogen\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nComes, F.

Tests were conducted primarily in the acceleration-wave regime for liquid jet atomization, where it was found that the loss of droplets due to vaporization had a marked effect on drop size measurements. In addition, four identically designed two-fluid atomizers were fabricated and tested for similarity of spray profiles. A scattered-light scanner was used to measure a characteristic drop diameter, which was correlated with nitrogen gas flowrate. The exponent of 1.33 for nitrogen gas flowrate is identical to that predicted by atomization theory for liquid jet breakup in the acceleration-wave regime. This is higher than the value of 1.2 which was previously obtained at a sampling distance of 4.4 cm downstream of the atomizer. The difference is attributed to the fact that drop-size measurements obtained at a 2.2 cm sampling distance are less effected by vaporization and dispersion of small droplets and therefore should give better agreement with atomization theory. Profiles of characteristic drop diameters were also obtained by making at least five line-of-sight measurements across the spray at several horizontal positions above and below the center line of the spray.\n\nAgreement between experimental and theoretical effects of nitrogen gas flowrate on liquid jet atomization\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nIngebo, Robert D.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nTwo-phase flows were investigated by using high velocity nitrogen gas streams to atomize small-diameter liquid jets.

The resulting shock front generates a high temperature reactive plasma around the meteor or vehicle (with temperatures greater than 10,000 K). This intense heat is transferred to the entering object by radiative and convective processes. Modeling the processes a meteor undergoes as it passes through the atmosphere and designing vehicles to withstand these conditions requires an accurate understanding of the underlying non-equilibrium high temperature chemistry. Nitrogen chemistry is particularly important given the abundance of nitrogen in Earth's atmosphere. Line emission by atomic nitrogen is a major source of radiative heating during atomspheric entry. Our ability to accurately calculate this heating is hindered by uncertainties in the electron-impact ionization (EII) rate coefficient for atomic nitrogen.Here we present new EII calculations for atomic nitrogen. The atom is treated as a 69 level system, incorporating Rydberg values up to n=20. Level-specific cross sections are from published B-Spline R-Matrix-with-Pseudostates results for the first three levels and binary-encounter Bethe (BEB) calculations that we have carried out for the remaining 59 levels. These cross section data have been convolved into level-specific rate coefficients and fit with the commonly-used Arrhenius-Kooij formula for ease of use in hypersonic chemical models. The rate coefficient data can be readily scaled by the relevant atomic nitrogen partition function which varies in time and space around the meteor or reentry vehicle. Providing data up to n=20 also enables modelers to account for the density-dependent lowering of the continuum.\n\nPrecise control of atomic nitrogen production in an electron cyclotron resonance plasma using N2/noble gas mixtures\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFan, Z. Y.; Newman, N.\n\n1998-07-01\n\nThe atomic nitrogen flux and impacting ion kinetic energy are two important parameters which influence the quality of deposited nitride films using reactive growth. In this letter, a method is described to control the flux and kinetic energy of atomic and molecular nitrogen ions using an electron cyclotron resonance plasma with N2/Ar and N2/Ne gas mixtures. The results clearly show that the addition of neon to nitrogen plasma can remarkably enhance the production rate of atomic nitrogen due to Penning ionization involving the metastable state of Ne. In contrast, the addition of argon significantly decreases the rate.\n\nThe role of terminations and coordination atoms on the pseudocapacitance of titanium carbonitride monolayers.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Wenqiang; Cheng, Chuan; Fang, Peilin; Tang, Bin; Zhang, Jindou; Huang, Guoming; Cong, Xin; Zhang, Bao; Ji, Xiao; Miao, Ling\n\n2016-02-14\n\nNowadays, MXenes have received extensive concern as a prominent electrode material of electrochemical capacitors. As two important factors to the capacitance, the influence of the intrinsical terminations (F, O and OH) and coordination atoms (C and N) is investigated using first-principles calculations. According to the density of states aligned with the standard hydrogen electrode, it turns out that a Ti3CNO2 monolayer is proven to show an obvious pseudocapacitive behavior, while the bare, F and OH terminated Ti3CN monolayers may only present electrochemical double layer characters in an aqueous electrolyte. Moreover, the illustration of molecular orbitals over the Fermi level are mainly contributed by the d-orbitals of Ti atoms coordinated with O and N atoms, indicating that the redox pseudocapacitance of the Ti3CNO2 monolayer is promoted by the coordination N atoms. Then the superiority of N bonded Ti atoms in accepting charges can be visualized through the charge population. Further, the larger ratio of C/N in the coordination environment of Ti atoms indicates that more electrons can be stored. Our investigation can give an instructional advice in the MXenes-electrode production.\n\nDeviation from Normal Boltzmann Distribution of High-lying Energy Levels of Iron Atom Excited by Okamoto-cavity Microwave-induced Plasmas Using Pure Nitrogen and Nitrogen-Oxygen Gases.\n\nPubMed\n\nWagatsuma, Kazuaki\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis paper describes several interesting excitation phenomena occurring in a microwave-induced plasma (MIP) excited with Okamoto-cavity, especially when a small amount of oxygen was mixed with nitrogen matrix in the composition of the plasma gas. An ion-to-atom ratio of iron, which was estimated from the intensity ratio of ion to atomic lines having almost the same excitation energy, was reduced by adding oxygen gas to the nitrogen MIP, eventually contributing to an enhancement in the emission intensities of the atomic lines. Furthermore, Boltzmann plots for iron atomic lines were observed in a wide range of the excitation energy from 3.4 to 6.9 eV, indicating that plots of the atomic lines having lower excitation energies (3.4 to 4.8 eV) were well fitted on a straight line while those having more than 5.5 eV deviated upwards from the linear relationship. This overpopulation would result from any other excitation process in addition to the thermal excitation that principally determines the Boltzmann distribution. A Penning-type collision with excited species of nitrogen molecules probably explains this additional excitation mechanism, in which the resulting iron ions recombine with captured electrons, followed by cascade de-excitations between closely-spaced excited levels just below the ionization limit. As a result, these high-lying levels might be more populated than the low-lying levels of iron atom. The ionization of iron would be caused less actively in the nitrogen-oxygen plasma than in a pure nitrogen plasma, because excited species of nitrogen molecule, which can provide the ionization energy in a collision with iron atom, are consumed through collisions with oxygen molecules to cause their dissociation. It was also observed that the overpopulation occurred to a lesser extent when oxygen gas was added to the nitrogen plasma. The reason for this was also attributed to decreased number density of the excited nitrogen species due to collisions with oxygen\n\nQuantum oscillations of nitrogen atoms in uranium nitride\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAczel, A.

M.; Stone, E. J.; Kley, D.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nA technique is given for calibrating an atomic nitrogen resonance lamp for use in determining column densities of atoms in specific states. A discharge lamp emitting the NI multiplets at 1200 A and 1493 A is studied by obtaining absorption by atoms in a magnetic field (0-2.5 T). This magnetic scanning technique enables the determination of the absorbing atom column density, and an empirical curve of growth is obtained because the atomic f-value is known. Thus, the calibrated lamp can be used in the determination of atomic column densities.\n\nNitrogen Isotope Evidence for a Shift in Eastern Beringian Nitrogen Cycle after the Terminal Pleistocene\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTahmasebi, F.; Longstaffe, F. J.; Zazula, G.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe loess deposits of eastern Beringia, a region in North America between 60Â° and 70Â°N latitude and bounded by Chukchi Sea to the west and the Mackenzie River to the east, are a magnificent repository of Late Pleistocene megafauna fossils. The stable carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions of these fossils are measured to determine the paleodiet of these animals, and hence the paleoenvironment of this ecosystem during the Quaternary. For this approach to be most successful, however, requires consideration of possible changes in nutrient cycling and hence the carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of vegetation in this ecosystem. To test for such a shift following the terminal Pleistocene, we analyzed the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions of modern plants and bone collagen of Arctic ground squirrels from Yukon Territory, and fossil plants and bones recovered from Late Pleistocene fossil Arctic ground squirrel nests. The data for modern samples provided a measure of the isotopic fractionation between ground squirrel bone collagen and their diet. The over-wintering isotopic effect of decay on typical forage grasses was also measured to evaluate its role in determining fossil plant isotopic compositions. The grasses showed only a minor change ( 0-1 â°) in carbon isotope composition, but a major change ( 2-10 â°) in nitrogen isotope composition over the 317-day experiment. Based on the modern carbon isotope fractionation between ground squirrel bone collagen and their diet, the modern vegetation carbon isotopic baseline provides a suitable proxy for the Late Pleistocene of eastern Beringia, after accounting for the Suess effect. However, the predicted nitrogen isotope composition of vegetation comprising the diet of fossil ground squirrels remains 2.5 â° higher than modern grasslands in this area, even after accounting for possible N-15 enrichment during decay. This result suggests a change in N cycling in this region since the Late Pleistocene.\n\nTwo-photon absorption laser-induced fluorescence measurements of atomic nitrogen in a radio-frequency atmospheric-pressure plasma jet\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWagenaars, E.; Gans, T.; O'Connell, D.; Niemi, K.\n\n2012-08-01\n\nThe first direct measurements of atomic nitrogen species in a radio-frequency atmospheric-pressure plasma jet (APPJ) are presented. Atomic nitrogen radicals play a key role in new plasma medicine applications of APPJs. The measurements were performed with a two-photon absorption laser-induced fluorescence diagnostic, using 206.65 nm laser photons for the excitation of ground-state N atoms and observing fluorescence light around 744 nm. The APPJ was run with a helium gas flow of 1 slm and varying small admixtures of molecular nitrogen of 0-0.7 vol%. A maximum in the measured N concentration was observed for an admixture of 0.25 vol% N2.\n\nTitan's atomic nitrogen torus - Inferred properties and consequences for the Saturnian aurora\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBarbosa, D. D.\n\n1987-10-01\n\nThis paper follows up the lead suggested by Barbosa and Eviatar (1986) that Titanogenic nitrogen ions are a key component of the magnetospheric particle populations and can account for the energetics of the Saturnian aurora without undue assumptions. Nitrogen atoms resulting from electron impact dissociations of N2 (Strobel and Shemansky 1982) escape from Titan and form a large doughnut-shaped ring around the satellite's orbit that is cospatial with the McDonough-Brice (1973) hydrogen cloud. Processes attendant to the ionization and pickup of nitrogen ions include the production of a warm kiloelectronvolt electron population and the excitation of the UV aurora by particle precipitation from the outer magnetosphere.\n\nOn pulse duration of self-terminating lasers\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBokhan, P A\n\n2011-02-28\n\nThe problem of the maximum pulse duration {tau}{sub max} of self-terminating lasers is considered. It is shown that the duration depends on the transition probability in the laser channel, on the decay rate of the resonant state in all other channels, and on the excitation rate of the metastable state. As a result, {tau}{sub max} is found to be significantly shorter than previously estimated. The criteria for converting the 'self-terminating' lasing to quasi-cw lasing are determined. It is shown that in the case of nonselective depopulation of the metastable state, for example in capillary lasers or in a fast flowmoreÂ Â» of the active medium gas, it is impossible to obtain continuous lasing. Some concrete examples are considered. It is established that in several studies of barium vapour lasers ({lambda} = 1.5 {mu}m) and nitrogen lasers ({lambda} = 337 nm), collisional lasing is obtained by increasing the relaxation rate of the metastable state in collisions with working particles (barium atoms and nitrogen molecules).

H.; Pamidi, S.; Ordonez, J. C.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nLow heat capacity of helium makes the helium gas cooled high temperature superconducting (HTS) power devices susceptible to large temperature rises during unexpected heat loads such as electrical faults or cryogenic system failures. Cryogenic thermal storage in the form of solid nitrogen designed in the terminations is explored as a means to increase the thermal stability and operational time of HTS power cables in the event of unexpected heat loads. An external tank containing activated charcoal is used as an adsorption buffer tank for nitrogen gas. The use of activated charcoal minimizes the volume of the buffer tank and prevents pressure rises during melting and boiling of the solid nitrogen. Calculations of the cryogenic thermal storage needed and a description of the experimental setup used to understand the design constraints are discussed.\n\nBias in bonding behavior among boron, carbon, and nitrogen atoms in ion implanted a-BN, a-BC, and diamond like carbon films\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGenisel, Mustafa Fatih; Uddin, Md. Nizam; Say, Zafer\n\n2011-10-01\n\nIn this study, we implanted N{sup +} and N{sub 2}{sup +} ions into sputter deposited amorphous boron carbide (a-BC) and diamond like carbon (DLC) thin films in an effort to understand the chemical bonding involved and investigate possible phase separation routes in boron carbon nitride (BCN) films. In addition, we investigated the effect of implanted C{sup +} ions in sputter deposited amorphous boron nitride (a-BN) films. Implanted ion energies for all ion species were set at 40 KeV. Implanted films were then analyzed using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The changes in the chemical composition and bonding chemistry due to ion-implantationmoreÂ Â» were examined at different depths of the films using sequential ion-beam etching and high resolution XPS analysis cycles. A comparative analysis has been made with the results from sputter deposited BCN films suggesting that implanted nitrogen and carbon atoms behaved very similar to nitrogen and carbon atoms in sputter deposited BCN films. We found that implanted nitrogen atoms would prefer bonding to carbon atoms in the films only if there is no boron atom in the vicinity or after all available boron atoms have been saturated with nitrogen. Implanted carbon atoms also preferred to either bond with available boron atoms or, more likely bonded with other implanted carbon atoms. These results were also supported by ab-initio density functional theory calculations which indicated that carbon-carbon bonds were energetically preferable to carbon-boron and carbon-nitrogen bonds.Â«Â less\n\nAdsorption Energies of Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen Atoms on the Low-temperature Amorphous Water Ice: A Systematic Estimation from Quantum Chemistry Calculations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShimonishi, Takashi; Nakatani, Naoki; Furuya, Kenji; Hama, Tetsuya\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe propose a new simple computational model to estimate the adsorption energies of atoms and molecules to low-temperature amorphous water ice, and we present the adsorption energies of carbon (3 P), nitrogen (4 S), and oxygen (3 P) atoms based on quantum chemistry calculations. The adsorption energies were estimated to be 14,100 Â± 420 K for carbon, 400 Â± 30 K for nitrogen, and 1440 Â± 160 K for oxygen. The adsorption energy of oxygen is consistent with experimentally reported values. We found that the binding of a nitrogen atom is purely physisorption, while that of a carbon atom is chemisorption, in which a chemical bond to an O atom of a water molecule is formed. That of an oxygen atom has a dual character, with both physisorption and chemisorption. The chemisorption of atomic carbon also implies the possibility of further chemical reactions to produce molecules bearing a CâO bond, though this may hinder the formation of methane on water ice via sequential hydrogenation of carbon atoms. These properties would have a large impact on the chemical evolution of carbon species in interstellar environments. We also investigated the effects of newly calculated adsorption energies on the chemical compositions of cold dense molecular clouds with the aid of gas-ice astrochemical simulations. We found that abundances of major nitrogen-bearing molecules, such as N2 and NH3, are significantly altered by applying the calculated adsorption energy, because nitrogen atoms can thermally diffuse on surfaces, even at 10 K.\n\nReactions of Ground State Nitrogen Atoms N(4S) with Astrochemically-Relevant Molecules on Interstellar Dusts\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKrim, Lahouari; Nourry, Sendres\n\n2015-06-01\n\nIn the last few years, ambitious programs were launched to probe the interstellar medium always more accurately. One of the major challenges of these missions remains the detection of prebiotic compounds and the understanding of reaction pathways leading to their formation. These complex heterogeneous reactions mainly occur on icy dust grains, and their studies require the coupling of laboratory experiments mimicking the extreme conditions of extreme cold and dilute media. For that purpose, we have developed an original experimental approach that combine the study of heterogeneous reactions (by exposing neutral molecules adsorbed on ice to non-energetic radicals H, OH, N...) and a neon matrix isolation study at very low temperatures, which is of paramount importance to isolate and characterize highly reactive reaction intermediates. Such experimental approach has already provided answers to many questions raised about some astrochemically-relevant reactions occurring in the ground state on the surface of dust grain ices in dense molecular clouds. The aim of this new present work is to show the implication of ground state atomic nitrogen on hydrogen atom abstraction reactions from some astrochemically-relevant species, at very low temperatures (3K-20K), without providing any external energy. Under cryogenic temperatures and with high barrier heights, such reactions involving N(4S) nitrogen atoms should not occur spontaneously and require an initiating energy. However, the detection of some radicals species as byproducts, in our solid samples left in the dark for hours at 10K, proves that hydrogen abstraction reactions involving ground state N(4S) nitrogen atoms may occur in solid phase at cryogenic temperatures. Our results show the efficiency of radical species formation stemming from non-energetic N-atoms and astrochemically-relevant molecules. We will then discuss how such reactions, involving nitrogen atoms in their ground states, might be the first key step\n\nA large atomic chlorine source inferred from mid-continental reactive nitrogen chemistry.\n\nPubMed\n\nThornton, Joel A; Kercher, James P; Riedel, Theran P; Wagner, Nicholas L; Cozic, Julie; Holloway, John S; DubÃ©, William P; Wolfe, Glenn M; Quinn, Patricia K; Middlebrook, Ann M; Alexander, Becky; Brown, Steven S\n\n2010-03-11\n\nHalogen atoms and oxides are highly reactive and can profoundly affect atmospheric composition. Chlorine atoms can decrease the lifetimes of gaseous elemental mercury and hydrocarbons such as the greenhouse gas methane. Chlorine atoms also influence cycles that catalytically destroy or produce tropospheric ozone, a greenhouse gas potentially toxic to plant and animal life. Conversion of inorganic chloride into gaseous chlorine atom precursors within the troposphere is generally considered a coastal or marine air phenomenon. Here we report mid-continental observations of the chlorine atom precursor nitryl chloride at a distance of 1,400 km from the nearest coastline. We observe persistent and significant nitryl chloride production relative to the consumption of its nitrogen oxide precursors. Comparison of these findings to model predictions based on aerosol and precipitation composition data from long-term monitoring networks suggests nitryl chloride production in the contiguous USA alone is at a level similar to previous global estimates for coastal and marine regions. We also suggest that a significant fraction of tropospheric chlorine atoms may arise directly from anthropogenic pollutants.\n\nAngular distribution of photoelectrons from atomic oxygen, nitrogen and carbon.

Both Hartree-Fock and Hartree-Slater (Herman-Skillman) wave functions are used for oxygen, and the agreement is excellent; thus only Hartree-Slater functions are used for carbon and nitrogen. The pitch-angle distribution of photoelectrons is discussed, and it is shown that previous approximations of energy-independent isotropic or sin squared theta distributions are at odds with the authors' results, which vary with energy. This variation with energy is discussed, as is the reliability of these calculations.\n\nUltra-low voltage and ultra-low power consumption nonvolatile operation of a three-terminal atomic switch.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Qi; Itoh, Yaomi; Tsuruoka, Tohru; Aono, Masakazu; Hasegawa, Tsuyoshi\n\n2015-10-21\n\nNonvolatile three-terminal operation, with a very small range of bias sweeping (-80 to 250 mV), a high on/off ratio of up to six orders of magnitude, and a very small gate leakage current (<1 pA), is demonstrated using an Ag (gate)/Ta2 O5 (ionic transfer layer)/Pt (source), Pt (drain) three-terminal atomic switch structure.

An approach has been developed for promoting oxo atom participation in a range of non-covalent interactions, through judicious choice of electron donating equatorial ligands and appropriately polarizable halogen-donor atoms. As such, a family of uranyl hybrid materials was generated based on a combination of 2,5-dihalobenzoic acid and aromatic, chelating N-donor ligands. Delineation of criteria for oxo participation in halogen bonding interactions has been achieved by preparing materials containing 2,5-dichloro- (25diClBA) and 2,5-dibromobenzoic acid (25diBrBA) coupled with 2,2'-bipyridine (bipy) (1 and 2), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) (3-5), 2,2':6',2''-terpyridine (terpy) (6-8), or 4'-chloro-2,2':6',2''-terpyridine (Cl-terpy) (9-10), which have been characterized through single crystal X-ray diffraction, Raman, Infrared (IR), and luminescence spectroscopy, as well as through density functional calculations of electrostatic potentials. Looking comprehensively, these results are compared with recently published analogues featuring 2,5-diiodobenzoic acid which indicate that although inclusion of a capping ligand in the uranyl first coordination sphere is important, it is the polarizability of the selected halogen atom that ultimately drives halogen bonding interactions with the uranyl oxo atoms.

Using Low Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS) it has been possible to study the chemical composition of the first atomic layer of treated NGO single crystal samples. NGO has been analyzed both as-received and after a specific thermal treatment at 1000 Â°C under different gas fluxes (argon, nitrogen, static air, synthetic air, nitrogen plus 5% hydrogen and wet synthetic air respectively). Thermal annealing of perovskite single crystals, as already reported in the literature, is used to obtain a fully A-cation surface termination. Nevertheless the effect of the gas-atmosphere on this process has not been previously reported. By the use of sequential low energy Ar(+) sputtering combined with the primary ion LEIS analysis, the reconstruction of the outermost atomic layers has allowed the clarification of the mechanism of NGO neodymium surface enrichment. It is proposed that the gallium at the surface is submitted to a reduction/evaporation mechanism caused by low oxygen partial pressure and/or high water pressure in the vector gas. Below the first surface atomic layers of an as-received NGO single-crystal a gallium-rich phase has also been observed.\n\nPreferential incorporation of substitutional nitrogen near the atomic step edges in diluted nitride alloys\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCornet, C.; Nguyen Thanh, T.; Almosni, S.\n\nWe have investigated the influence of the surface roughness on nitrogen incorporation during the molecular beam epitaxy of diluted nitrides, independently of the other growth parameters. GaPN/GaP layers grown simultaneously on surfaces displaying different roughnesses reveal a large difference in nitrogen incorporation despite the same growth temperature and growth rate. The same difference is found on quasi-lattice-matched GaAsPN demonstrating that the phenomenon is not related to any strain-induced mechanisms. The tendency is clearly confirmed when varying the growth conditions. As a direct consequence, the incorporation of substitutional nitrogen near the atomic step edges is found to be 6.7 times moremoreÂ Â» probable than the in-plane nitrogen incorporation. The formation of N-N{sub i} clusters and their stability on the surface is discussed.Â«Â less\n\nDoes the position of the electron-donating nitrogen atom in the ring system influence the efficiency of a dye-sensitized solar cell? A computational study.\n\nPubMed\n\nBiswas, Abul Kalam; Barik, Sunirmal; Das, Amitava; Ganguly, Bishwajit\n\n2016-06-01\n\nWe have reported a number of new metal-free organic dyes (2-6) that have cyclic asymmetric benzotripyrrole derivatives as donor groups with peripheral nitrogen atoms in the ring, fluorine and thiophene groups as Ï-spacers, and a cyanoacrylic acid acceptor group. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations were employed to examine the influence of the position of the donor nitrogen atom and Ï-conjugation on solar cell performance. The calculated electron-injection driving force (ÎG inject), electron-regeneration driving force (ÎG regen), light-harvesting efficiency (LHE), dipole moment (Î¼ normal), and number of electrons transferred (âq) indicate that dyes 3, 4, and 6 have significantly higher efficiencies than reference dye 1, which exhibits high efficiency. We also extended our comparison to some other reported dyes, 7-9, which have a donor nitrogen atom in the middle of the ring system. The computed results suggest that dye 6 possesses a higher incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) than reported dyes 7-9. Thus, the use of donor groups with peripheral nitrogen atoms appears to lead to more efficient dyes than those in which the nitrogen atom is present in the middle of the donor ring system. Graphical Abstract The locations of the nitrogen atoms in the donor groups in the designed dye molecules have an important influence on DSSC efficiency.\n\nThe production and escape of nitrogen atoms on Mars\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFox, J. L.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe lack of agreement between our previously computed values and those measured by Viking of the N-15:N-14 isotope enhancement ratio has led us to reevaluate our model of the Martian ionosphere. In previous models, we were unable to reproduce the ion profiles measured by the RPA on Viking using electron temperatures that were higher that the ion temperatures. When we increased the electron temperatures to 2500-3000 K and with a zero flux upper boundary condition, the ion densities at high altitudes exceeded the measured values by a large factor. We found that we can better fit the observed profiles if we impose a loss process at the upper boundary of our model. If the horizontal fluxes of ions do not constitute a net loss of ions, then the escape of N due to dissociative recombination is also inhibited and better agreement with the measured isotope ratio is found. The production of escaping nitrogen atoms is closely related to the production of thermospheric odd nitrogen; therefore, the densities of NO measured by Viking provide a convenient check on our nitrogen escape model. Our standard model NO densities are less that the measured values by a factor of 2-3, as are those of previous models. We find that reasonable agreement can be obtained by assuming that the rate coefficient for loss of odd nitrogen in the reaction of N with NO is smaller at temperatures that prevail in the lower Martian thermosphere than the standard value, which applies to temperatures of 200-400 K. Other aspects of this investigation are presented.\n\nTunable electronic properties of graphene through controlling bonding configurations of doped nitrogen atoms.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Jia; Zhao, Chao; Liu, Na; Zhang, Huanxi; Liu, Jingjing; Fu, Yong Qing; Guo, Bin; Wang, Zhenlong; Lei, Shengbin; Hu, PingAn\n\n2016-06-21\n\nSingle-layer and mono-component doped graphene is a crucial platform for a better understanding of the relationship between its intrinsic electronic properties and atomic bonding configurations.

The termination consists of a splice between the HTS power (inner) and shield (outer) conductors and concentric copper pipes which are the conductors in the termination. There is also a transition from the dielectric tape insulator used in the HTS cable to the insulators used between and around the copper pipe conductors in the termination. At the warm end of the termination the copper pipes are connected via copper braided straps to the conventional warm external bushings which have low thermal stresses. This termination allows for a natural temperature gradient in the copper pipe conductors inside the termination which enables the controlled flashing of the pressurized liquid coolant (nitrogen) to the gaseous state. Thus the entire termination is near the coolant supply pressure and the high voltage and shield cold bushings, a highly stressed component used in most HTS cables, are eliminated. A sliding seal allows for cable contraction as it is cooled from room temperature to Ë72-82 K.

The NCD films used in this study were grown on silicon substrates by microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition and grafted by hydrogen atoms (H-termination) or oxygen atoms (O-termination). Human osteoblast-like Saos-2 cells were used for biological studies on H-terminated and O-terminated NCD films. The adhesion, growth, and subsequent differentiation of the osteoblasts on NCD films were examined, and the extracellular matrix production and composition were quantified. The osteoblasts that had been cultivated on the O-terminated NCD films exhibited a higher growth rate than those grown on the H-terminated NCD films. The mature collagen fibers were detected in Saos-2 cells on both the H-terminated and O-terminated NCD films; however, the quantity of total collagen in the extracellular matrix was higher on the O-terminated NCD films, as were the amounts of calcium deposition and alkaline phosphatase activity. Nevertheless, the expression of genes for osteogenic markers â type I collagen, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin â was either comparable on the H-terminated and O-terminated films or even lower on the O-terminated films. In conclusion, the higher wettability of the O-terminated NCD films is promising for adhesion and growth of osteoblasts. In addition, the O-terminated surface also seems to support the deposition of extracellular matrix proteins and extracellular matrix mineralization, and this is promising for better osteoconductivity of potential bone implant coatings.

L.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nUpdated rate coefficients and a revised ionosphere-thermosphere model are used to compute the production rates and densities of odd nitrogen species in the Martian atmosphere. Computed density profiles for N(4S), N(2D), N(2P), and NO are presented. The model NO densities are found to be about a factor of 2-3 less than those measured by the Viking 1 mass spectrometer. Revised values for the escape rates of N atoms from dissociative recombination and ionospheric reactions are also computed. Dissociative recombination is found to be comparable in importance to photodissociation at low solar activity, but it is still the most important escape mechanism for N-14 at high solar activity.\n\nN2 Dissociation In The Mesosphere Due To Secondary Electrons During A Solar Proton Event: The Effect On Atomic Nitrogen and Nitric Oxide\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVerronen, P. T.; Shematovich, V. I.; Bisikalo, D. V.; Turunen, E.; Ulich, Th.\n\nSolar proton events have an effect on the middle atmospheric odd nitrogen chem- istry. During a solar proton event high energy protons enter Earth's middle atmosphere where they ionize ambient gas. Ionization leads to production of atomic nitrogen, and further to production of nitric oxide, through ion chemistry. In addition, ionization processes produce secondary electrons that, if possessing 9.76 eV or more energy, dissociate N2 providing an additional source of atomic nitrogen. We have calculated mesospheric N2 dissociation rate due to secondary electrons dur- ing a solar proton event. Further, we have studied the effect on atomic nitrogen and nitric oxide at altitudes between 50 and 90 km. It was found that N2 is efficiently dis- sociated in the lower mesosphere by secondary electrons, with rates up to 103 cm-3 s-1 at 50 km. Thus, secondary electrons significantly add to odd nitrogen produc- tion. As a result of N2 dissociation, atomic nitrogen is greatly enhanced in both N(4S) and N(2D) states by 259% and 1220% maximum increases at 50 km, respectively. This further leads to a maximum increase of 16.5% in NO concentration at 61 km via chemical reactions. In our study a Monte Carlo model was used to calculate the total ionization rate and secondary electrons flux due to precipitating protons. These where then used as input to a detailed ion and neutral chemistry model and a steady-state solution was calcu- lated for two cases: With and without N2 dissociation due to secondary electrons.\n\nArc Jet Flow Properties Determined from Laser-Induced Fluorescence of Atomic Nitrogen\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFletcher, Douglas; Wercinski, Paul F. (Technical Monitor)\n\n1998-01-01\n\nAn laser-spectroscopic investigation of the thermocheMical state of arcjet flows is currently being conducted in the Aerodynamic Heating Facility (AHF) Circlet at NASA Ames Research Center. Downstream of the nozzle exit, but upstream of the test article, Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) of atomic nitrogen is used to assess the nonequilibriuM distribution of flow enthalpy in the free stream. The two-photon LIF technique provides simultaneous measurements of free stream velocity, translational temperature, and nitrogen number density on the flow centerline. Along with information from facility instrumentation, these measurements allow a determination of the free stream total enthalpy, and its apportionment in to thermal, kinetic, and chemical mode contributions. Experimental results are presented and discussed for two different niti-ogen/argon test gas flow runs during which the current is varied while the pressure remains constant .\n\nNitrogen spark denoxer\n\nDOEpatents\n\nNg, Henry K.; Novick, Vincent J.; Sekar, Ramanujam R.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nA NO.sub.X control system for an internal combustion engine includes an oxygen enrichment device that produces oxygen and nitrogen enriched air. The nitrogen enriched air contains molecular nitrogen that is provided to a spark plug that is mounted in an exhaust outlet of an internal combustion engine. As the nitrogen enriched air is expelled at the spark gap of the spark plug, the nitrogen enriched air is exposed to a pulsating spark that is generated across the spark gap of the spark plug. The spark gap is elongated so that a sufficient amount of atomic nitrogen is produced and is injected into the exhaust of the internal combustion engine. The injection of the atomic nitrogen into the exhaust of the internal combustion engine causes the oxides of nitrogen to be reduced into nitrogen and oxygen such that the emissions from the engine will have acceptable levels of NO.sub.X. The oxygen enrichment device that produces both the oxygen and nitrogen enriched air can include a selectively permeable membrane.\n\nElectron ionization of metastable nitrogen and oxygen atoms in relation to the auroral emissions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPandya, Siddharth; Joshipura, K. N.\n\nAtomic and molecular excited metastable states (EMS) are exotic systems due to their special properties like long radiative life-time, large size (average radius) and large polarizability along with relatively smaller first ionization energy compared to their respective ground states (GS). The present work includes our theoretical calculations on electron impact ionization of metastable atomic states N( (2) P), N( (2) D) of nitrogen and O( (1) S), O( (1) D) of oxygen. The targets of our present interest, are found to be present in our Earth's ionosphere and they play an important role in auroral emissions observed in Earthâs auroral regions [1] as also in the emissions observed from cometary coma [2, 3] and airglow emissions. In particular, atomic oxygen in EMS can radiate, the visible O( (1) D -> (3) P) doublet 6300 - 6364 Ã red doublet, the O( (1) S -> (1) D) 5577 Ã green line, and the ultraviolet O( (1) S -> (3) P) 2972 Ã line. For metastable atomic nitrogen one observes the similar emissions, in different wavelengths, from (2) D and (2) P states. At the Earth's auroral altitudes, from where these emissions take place in the ionosphere, energetic electrons are also present. In particular, if the metastable N as well as O atoms are ionized by the impact of electrons then these species are no longer available for emissions. This is a possible loss mechanism, and hence it is necessary to analyze the importance of electron ionization of the EMS of atomic O and N, by calculating the relevant cross sections. In the present paper we investigate electron ionization of the said metastable species by calculating relevant total cross sections. Our quantum mechanical calculations are based on projected approximate ionization contribution in the total inelastic cross sections [4]. Detailed results and discussion along with the significance of these calculations will be presented during the COSPAR-2014. References [1] A.Bhardwaj, and G. R. Gladstone, Rev.

A.; Martin-Gondre, L.; Bocan, G. A.; DÃ­ez MuiÃ±o, R.\n\n2016-09-01\n\nWe present Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the investigation of the structural relaxation of Fe(1 1 1), as well as for the study of the interaction of nitrogen atoms and molecules with this surface. We perform spin polarized DFT calculations using VASP (Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package) code. We use the supercell approach and up to 19 slab layers for the relaxation of the Fe(1 1 1) surface. We find a contraction of the first two interlayer distances with a relative value of Î12 = - 7.8 % and Î23 = - 21.7 % with respect to the bulk reference. The third interlayer distance is however expanded with a relative change of Î34 = 9.7 % . Early experimental studies of the surface relaxation using Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) and Medium Energy Ion Scattering (MEIS) showed contradictory results, even on the relaxation general trend. Our current theoretical results support the LEED conclusions and are consistent qualitatively with other recent theoretical calculations. In addition, we study the interaction energy of nitrogen atoms and molecules on the Fe(1 1 1) surface. The nitrogen atoms are adsorbed in the hollow site of the unit cell, with an adsorption energy consistent with the one found in previous studies. In addition, we find the three molecularly adsorbed states that are observed experimentally. Two of them correspond to the adsorbed molecule oriented normal to the surface and a third one corresponds to the molecule adsorbed parallel to the surface. We conclude that our results are accurate enough to be used to build a full six-dimensional potential energy surface for the N2 system.\n\nStorm-time variations of atomic nitrogen 149.3 nm emission\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Y.; Paxton, L. J.; Morrison, D.; Schaefer, B.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nNet radiances of atomic nitrogen emission line (N-149.3 nm) from the thermosphere are extracted from the FUV spectra observed by TIMED/GUVI on dayside at sunlit latitudes. During geomagnetic storms, the N-149.3 nm intensity is clearly enhanced in the locations where O/N2 depletion and nitric oxide (NO) enhancement are observed. The N-149.3 nm intensity is linearly and tightly correlated with N2 LBHS (140-150 nm) radiance with a fixed LBHS/149.3 nm ratio of â¼4.5, suggesting that dissociation of N2 is the dominant source of the N-149.3 nm emission. In the regions without storm disturbances, the N-149.3 nm intensities are closely correlated with solar EUV flux.\n\nThe impact of gas-surface reactions on mass spectrometric measurements of atomic nitrogen. [determination of atmosphere ion sources\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nEngebretson, M. J.; Mauersberger, K.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nThe paper presents a simplified model of the ion source chemistry, explains several details of the data reduction method used in obtaining atomic-nitrogen (N) densities from OSS data, and discusses implications of gas-surface reactions for the design of future satellite-borne mass spectrometers. Because of various surface reactions, N appears in three different forms in the ion source, as N, NO, and NO2. Considering the rather small spin modulation of NO and NO2 in the semi-open ionization chamber used in the OSS instrument, it is not surprising that these reaction products have not been previously identified in closed source instruments as a measure of the presence of atomic nitrogen. Warmup and/or outgassing of the ion source are shown to drastically reduce the NO2 concentration, thereby making possible reliable measurement of ambient N densities.\n\nCurare-Like Activity of Mono-Quaternary Salts Containing Adamantyl Residue at the Nitrogen Atom\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\nAs shown in previous works, mono-quaternary salts of alkamine esters of benzoic and cinnamic acids types and exhibit a pronounced curare like action...A series of methiodides of alkamine esters of benzoic and cinnamic acids were synthesized, containing at the quaternary nitrogen atom a 1-adamantyl...adamantyl causes a change of the substance’s mechanism of action, this applying both to the benzoic acid derivatives and to the cinnamic acid derivatives\n\nScandium Terminal Imido Chemistry.\n\nPubMed\n\nLu, Erli; Chu, Jiaxiang; Chen, Yaofeng\n\n2018-02-20\n\nof two p-d Ï bonds between the scandium ion and the nitrogen atom of the imido ligand and showed that the dianionic [NR] 2- imido ligand acts as a 2Ï,4Ï electron donor. Subsequent studies of the scandium terminal imides revealed highly versatile and intriguing reactivity of the ScâN bond. This included cycloaddition toward various unsaturated bonds, C-H/Si-H/B-H bond activations and catalytic hydrosilylation, dehydrofluorination of fluoro-substituted benzenes/alkanes, CO 2 and H 2 activations, activation of elemental selenium, coordination with other transition metal halides, etc. Since our initial success in 2010, and with contributions from us and across the community, this young, vibrant research field has rapidly flourished into one of the most active frontiers of rare-earth metal chemistry. The prospect of extending LnâN chemistry to other rare-earth metals and/or different metal oxidation states, as well as exploiting their stoichiometric and catalytic reactivities, continues to attract research effort. Herein we present an account of our investigations into scandium terminal imido chemistry as a timely summary, in the hope that our studies will be of interest to this readership.\n\nEffect of Surface Preparation and Gas Flow on Nitrogen Atom Surface Recombination\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nProk, George M.\n\n1961-01-01\n\nThe effects of surface preparation and gas flow on the recombination of nitrogen atoms at copper and platinum surfaces were determined. Atoms were generated by an electrodeless 2450-megacycle-per-second discharge, and their concentration was measured by gas-phase titration with nitric oxide. Test surfaces were either vacuum-evaporated films or spheres machined from bulk metal and cemented around small glass-bead thermistors. Heat released by recombination was measured as the difference in electrical energy required to maintain a given thermistor temperature with and without a catalytic surface exposed. Recombination coefficients measured at flow velocities of 1120, 1790, 2250, and 3460 centimeters per second and at pressures of 0.42 and 0.59 millimeter of mercury showed that flow conditions had no effect. The results were also independent of atom concentration. A rough indication of the temperature dependence was obtained; it was greater for copper than for platinum. Platinum films deposited on platinum or on glass had the same activity - about 3 percent of the atoms impinging recombined. With copper, however, the glass substrate greatly reduced the percent of atoms recombining over that of a bulk copper substrate where 4 percent of the impinging atoms recombined. This effect could be overcome by depositing a second film on top of the first. Bulk metal samples were subjected to various surface treatments including polishing, degreasing with a chlorinated hydrocarbon, washing with nitric acid, and rinsing with water. Polished, degreased platinum had low activity compared to an evaporated film, but nitric acid treatment made it equivalent. Polished, degreased copper was only slightly less active than a copper film; nitric acid etching decreased the activity still further, probably by preferentially exposing facets of low catalytic efficiency.\n\nFormation of the nitrogen aggregates in annealed diamond by neutron irradiation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMita, Y.; Nisida, Y.; Okada, M.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nNeutron heavy irradiation was performed on synthetic diamonds contain nitrogen atoms in isolated substitutional form (called \"type Ib diamond\") and they were annealed under a pressure of 6 GPa. A large number of nitrogen B-aggregate which consists of four substitutional nitrogen atoms symmetrically surrounding a vacancy was formed within 30 m from single nitrogen atoms. Furthermore it is observed that, in these diamonds, single nitrogen atoms coexist with the B-aggregates, which is unexplainable by the simple nitrogen aggregation model.\n\nProbabilistic models and uncertainty quantification for the ionization reaction rate of atomic Nitrogen\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMiki, K.; Panesi, M.; Prudencio, E. E.; Prudhomme, S.\n\n2012-05-01\n\nThe objective in this paper is to analyze some stochastic models for estimating the ionization reaction rate constant of atomic Nitrogen (N + e- â N+ + 2e-). Parameters of the models are identified by means of Bayesian inference using spatially resolved absolute radiance data obtained from the Electric Arc Shock Tube (EAST) wind-tunnel. The proposed methodology accounts for uncertainties in the model parameters as well as physical model inadequacies, providing estimates of the rate constant that reflect both types of uncertainties. We present four different probabilistic models by varying the error structure (either additive or multiplicative) and by choosing different descriptions of the statistical correlation among data points. In order to assess the validity of our methodology, we first present some calibration results obtained with manufactured data and then proceed by using experimental data collected at EAST experimental facility. In order to simulate the radiative signature emitted in the shock-heated air plasma, we use a one-dimensional flow solver with Park's two-temperature model that simulates non-equilibrium effects. We also discuss the implications of the choice of the stochastic model on the estimation of the reaction rate and its uncertainties. Our analysis shows that the stochastic models based on correlated multiplicative errors are the most plausible models among the four models proposed in this study. The rate of the atomic Nitrogen ionization is found to be (6.2 Â± 3.3) Ã 1011 cm3 mol-1 s-1 at 10,000 K.\n\nIsomerization and fragmentation of acetonitrile upon interaction with N(4S) atoms: the chemistry of nitrogen in dense molecular clouds\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMencos, Alejandro; Krim, Lahouari\n\n2016-08-01\n\nWe experimentally show that the reaction between ground state nitrogen atoms N(4S) and acetonitrile CH3CN can lead to two distinct chemical pathways that are both thermally activated at very low temperatures. First is CH3CN isomerization which produces CH3NC and H2CCNH. Second is CH3CN decomposition which produces HNC and CH3CNH+CN- fragments, with the possible release of H2. Our results reveal that the mobility of N(4S)-atoms is stimulated in the 3-11 K temperature range, and that its subsequent encounter with one acetonitrile molecule is sufficient for the aforementioned reactions to occur without the need for additional energy to be supplied to the CH3CN + N(4S) system. These findings shed more light on the nitrogen chemistry that can possibly take place in dense molecular clouds, which until now was thought to only involve high-energy processes and therefore be unlikely to occur in such cold and dark interstellar regions. The reaction pathways we propose in this study have very important astrochemical implications, as it was shown recently that the atomic nitrogen might be more abundant, in many interstellar icy grain mantles, than previously thought. Also, these reaction pathways can now be considered within dense molecular clouds, and possibly affect the branching ratios for N-bearing molecules computed in astrochemical modelling.\n\nCobalt and iron segregation and nitride formation from nitrogen plasma treatment of CoFeB surfaces\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMattson, E. C.; Michalak, D. J.; Veyan, J. F.; Chabal, Y. J.\n\n2017-02-01\n\nCobalt-iron-boron (CoFeB) thin films are the industry standard for ferromagnetic layers in magnetic tunnel junction devices and are closely related to the relevant surfaces of CoFe-based catalysts. Identifying and understanding the composition of their surfaces under relevant processing conditions is therefore critical. Here we report fundamental studies on the interaction of nitrogen plasma with CoFeB surfaces using infrared spectroscopy, x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, and low energy ion scattering. We find that, upon exposure to nitrogen plasma, clean CoFeB surfaces spontaneously reorganize to form an overlayer comprised of Fe2N3 and BN, with the Co atoms moved well below the surface through a chemically driven process. Subsequent annealing to 400 Â°C removes nitrogen, resulting in a Fe-rich termination of the surface region.\n\nOdd nitrogen production by meteoroids\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPark, C.; Menees, G. P.\n\n1978-01-01\n\nThe process by which odd nitrogen species (atomic nitrogen and nitric oxide) are formed during atmospheric entry of meteoroids is analyzed theoretically. An ablating meteoroid is assumed to be a point source of mass with a continuum regime evolving in its wake. The amounts of odd nitrogen species, produced by high-temperature reactions of air in the continuum wake, are calculated by numerical integration of chemical rate equations. Flow properties are assumed to be uniform across the wake, and 29 reactions involving five neutral species and five singly ionized species are considered, as well as vibrational and electron temperature nonequilibrium phenomena. The results, when they are summed over the observed mass, velocity, and entry-angle distribution of meteoroids, provide odd-nitrogen-species annual global production rates as functions of altitude. The peak production of nitric oxide is found to occur at an altitude of about 85 km; atomic nitrogen production peaks at about 95 km. The total annual rate for nitric oxide is 40 million kg; for atomic nitrogen it is 170 million kg.\n\nSynthesis of pyrido[1,2-a]benzimidazoles and other fused imidazole derivatives with a bridgehead nitrogen atom\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBegunov, Roman S.; Ryzvanovich, Galina A.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nMain methods for the synthesis of fused imidazole derivatives with a bridgehead nitrogen atom are systematically considered and summarized. The reaction mechanisms that underlie the methods for the synthesis of pyrido[1,2-a]benzimidazoles and related compounds are described. Biological properties and mechanisms of the biological activity of fused azaheterocycles are discussed.

Although wrought A690 exhibits extensive grain growth during solution annealing heat treatments, only limited grain growth was observed in P/M690N{sub 2}. The presence of the nitrogen in the P/M690N{sub 2} resulted in the formation of a fine dispersion of Ti(C,N) which limited grain growth during elevated temperature exposures. The yield and ultimate tensile strength of the P/M690N{sub 2} was significantly greater than wrought A690 and elevated temperature exposures did not greatly affect the properties of the P/M690N{sub 2}. Although the P/M690N{sub 2} didmoreÂ Â» exhibit appreciably higher strengths than wrought A690, the ductility was not adversely affected. In general, the resulting microstructure and, hence, mechanical properties of the P/M690N{sub 2} were very stable, uniform, and reproducible, even after long-term elevated temperature exposures of up to 24 hours at 1100{degree}C. 14 refs., 5 figs., 1 tab.Â«Â less\n\nHigh-Bandwidth Atomic Force Microscopy Reveals A Mechanical spike Accompanying the Action Potential in mammalian Nerve Terminals\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSalzberg, Brian M.\n\n2008-03-01\n\nInformation transfer from neuron to neuron within nervous systems occurs when the action potential arrives at a nerve terminal and initiates the release of a chemical messenger (neurotransmitter). In the mammalian neurohypophysis (posterior pituitary), large and rapid changes in light scattering accompany secretion of transmitter-like neuropeptides. In the mouse, these intrinsic optical signals are intimately related to the arrival of the action potential (E-wave) and the release of arginine vasopressin and oxytocin (S-wave). We have used a high bandwidth (20 kHz) atomic force microscope (AFM) to demonstrate that these light scattering signals are associated with changes in nerve terminal volume, detected as nanometer-scale movements of a cantilever positioned on top of the neurohypophysis. The most rapid mechanical response, the ``spike'', has duration comparable to that of the action potential (Ë2 ms) and probably reflects an increase in terminal volume due to H2O movement associated with Na^+-influx. Elementary calculations suggest that two H2O molecules accompanying each Na^+-ion could account for the Ë0.5-1.0 Ã¥ increase in the diameter of each terminal during the action potential. Distinguishable from the mechanical ``spike'', a slower mechanical event, the ``dip'', represents a decrease in nerve terminal volume, depends upon Ca^2+-entry, as well as on intra-terminal Ca^2+-transients, and appears to monitor events associated with secretion. A simple hypothesis is that this ``dip'' reflects the extrusion of the dense core granule that comprises the secretory products. These dynamic high bandwidth AFM recordings are the first to monitor mechanical events in nervous systems and may provide novel insights into the mechanism(s) by which excitation is coupled to secretion at nerve terminals.\n\nAtomic switch: atom/ion movement controlled devices for beyond von-neumann computers.\n\nPubMed\n\nHasegawa, Tsuyoshi; Terabe, Kazuya; Tsuruoka, Tohru; Aono, Masakazu\n\n2012-01-10\n\nAn atomic switch is a nanoionic device that controls the diffusion of metal ions/atoms and their reduction/oxidation processes in the switching operation to form/annihilate a conductive path. Since metal atoms can provide a highly conductive channel even if their cluster size is in the nanometer scale, atomic switches may enable downscaling to smaller than the 11 nm technology node, which is a great challenge for semiconductor devices. Atomic switches also possess novel characteristics, such as high on/off ratios, very low power consumption and non-volatility. The unique operating mechanisms of these devices have enabled the development of various types of atomic switch, such as gap-type and gapless-type two-terminal atomic switches and three-terminal atomic switches. Novel functions, such as selective volatile/nonvolatile, synaptic, memristive, and photo-assisted operations have been demonstrated. Such atomic switch characteristics can not only improve the performance of present-day electronic systems, but also enable development of new types of electronic systems, such as beyond von- Neumann computers.

CIAAW recognized that some users of atomic weight data only need representative values for these 12 elements, such as for trade and commerce. For this purpose, CIAAW provided conventional atomic weight values, such as 14.007 for nitrogen, and these values can serve in education when a single representative value is needed, such as for molecular weight calculations. Because atomic weight values abridged to four figures are preferred by many educational users and are no longer provided by CIAAW as of 2015, we provide a table containing both standard atomic weight values and conventional atomic weight values abridged to four figures for the chemical elements. A retrospective review of changes in four-digit atomic weights since 1961 indicates that changes in these values are due to more accurate measurements over time or to the recognition of the impact of natural isotopic fractionation in normal terrestrial materials upon atomic weight values of many elements. Use of the unit âuâ (unified atomic mass unit on the carbon mass scale) with atomic weight is incorrect because the quantity atomic weight is dimensionless, and the unit âamuâ (atomic mass unit on the oxygen scale) is an obsolete term: Both should be avoided.\n\nUltraviolet electroluminescence from nitrogen-doped ZnO-based heterojuntion light-emitting diodes prepared by remote plasma in situ atomic layer-doping technique.\n\nPubMed\n\nChien, Jui-Fen; Liao, Hua-Yang; Yu, Sheng-Fu; Lin, Ray-Ming; Shiojiri, Makoto; Shyue, Jing-Jong; Chen, Miin-Jang\n\n2013-01-23\n\nRemote plasma in situ atomic layer doping technique was applied to prepare an n-type nitrogen-doped ZnO (n-ZnO:N) layer upon p-type magnesium-doped GaN (p-GaN:Mg) to fabricate the n-ZnO:N/p-GaN:Mg heterojuntion light-emitting diodes. The room-temperature electroluminescence exhibits a dominant ultraviolet peak at Î» â 370 nm from ZnO band-edge emission and suppressed luminescence from GaN, as a result of the decrease in electron concentration in ZnO and reduced electron injection from n-ZnO:N to p-GaN:Mg because of the nitrogen incorporation. The result indicates that the in situ atomic layer doping technique is an effective approach to tailoring the electrical properties of materials in device applications.\n\nAtomic switches: atomic-movement-controlled nanodevices for new types of computing\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHino, Takami; Hasegawa, Tsuyoshi; Terabe, Kazuya; Tsuruoka, Tohru; Nayak, Alpana; Ohno, Takeo; Aono, Masakazu\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAtomic switches are nanoionic devices that control the diffusion of metal cations and their reduction/oxidation processes in the switching operation to form/annihilate a metal atomic bridge, which is a conductive path between two electrodes in the on-state. In contrast to conventional semiconductor devices, atomic switches can provide a highly conductive channel even if their size is of nanometer order. In addition to their small size and low on-resistance, their nonvolatility has enabled the development of new types of programmable devices, which may achieve all the required functions on a single chip. Three-terminal atomic switches have also been developed, in which the formation and annihilation of a metal atomic bridge between a source electrode and a drain electrode are controlled by a third (gate) electrode. Three-terminal atomic switches are expected to enhance the development of new types of logic circuits, such as nonvolatile logic. The recent development of atomic switches that use a metal oxide as the ionic conductive material has enabled the integration of atomic switches with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices, which will facilitate the commercialization of atomic switches. The novel characteristics of atomic switches, such as their learning and photosensing abilities, are also introduced in the latter part of this review.

Nitrogen termination of both the polar (0001Â¯) top face and the nonpolar (101Â¯0) side faces of the nanowires is essential for long-term stability and high efficiency. Such a distinct atomic configuration ensures not only stability against (photo) oxidation in air and in water/electrolyte but, as importantly, also provides the necessary overall reverse crystal polarization needed for efficient hole extraction in p-GaN.
