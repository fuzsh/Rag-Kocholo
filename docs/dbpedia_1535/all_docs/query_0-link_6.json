        "text": "Since 2008 I am a member of Polish Art Photographers Association. Definitely... I do prefer to talk using pictures. My photos are my language, which convey what I feel , what is inside me , who I am and how I do perceive what surrounds me. It happens, that sometimes it is the only way to convey a specific thought or climate of some moment in time or an event. The vast majority of the my photos are based on previous thoughts. Some of the works are projects as a set of carefully planned images which I realize in a number of days, weeks, months or even years. Some of the projects I realize as single images presenting just one closed thought, with no need to dedicate more pictures to this. Sometimes it happens, that something is pulling me in some direction, and I capture images as if there was no special purpose - and just after some time I discover what 'meant' my subconscious. In my work I am still impressed and inspired by very many artists - among them strongly by Marcel Duchamp, Andre Breton, Salvador Dali, Andy Warhol, Witkin, Spencer Tunick, Gilbert Garcin, Jindri Streit, Paweł Żak, Stanisław Woś, Ewa Rubinstein and very deeply by literature of Bruno Shulz and films of Quay Brothers."
