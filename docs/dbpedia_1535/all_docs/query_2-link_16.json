        "text": "DOES GOOD GOVERNANCE MEAN CONSENSUS? We live in a world of nuance but our (ideological) conversations are increasingly binary. It's easy to think this trend is restricted to politics or social media. But it‚Äôs not. The boardroom is not immune. From listed companies to non-profits, all boards can suffer the challenge of them v us, belief v belief, left v right and so on. This might shock you, but good governance doesn't mean consensus decision-making. You want a contest of ideas and perspectives - lacking in the homogeneous, autocratic or psychologically unsafe boardroom. However, you also don‚Äôt want to fall back into simple majority versus minority decision-making. Why? Because the minority view might still be valid and if left at that, you find people potentially resisting decisions, either covertly or overtly...sometimes very publicly. To have a robust decision, with little or no internal resistance, and a positive culture you need to engage in decision-making techniques that create psychological safety, lift collective intelligence, whilst uncovering all relevant views and ideas. Then, create an agreement that even the minority viewpoint can support - but not necessarily fully agree with. How is this possible? Either you have an amazing board culture or you employ a technique like Deep Democracy. When I first came across this method I was blown away at its simplicity and effectiveness. Since then, I've used it successfully with teams, companies and boards to help them get unstuck, become more inclusive, and make better decisions. I even use it in my personal life :) Without going into the details, the DD method was developed with the understanding that humans are emotional and illogical, especially when deeply held beliefs are involved or tested. What you need is a controlled way to allow everyone the time and space to play their own Devil's Advocate. First-timers can find it challenging and contrived yet fun, enlightening, safe and ultimately, it leads to better and more engaged decision-making. Which we could all do with more of these days. Future Directors #boardofdirectors #goodgovernance #corporategovernance #decisionmaking\n\nüîî In collaboration with our Strategic Legal Partner - GESSEL Attorneys at law, Strong Women in IT presents another special webinar from the \"Legal Insights for Modern Leaders\" series. This time the main topic of discussion will be \"Women on Management Boards ‚Äì The Journey.‚Äù üëâ What was your path to becoming a management board member? üëâ Are the responsibilities of a management board member different depending on the character and size of the company? üëâ What challenges did you face in this role and how did you manage them? üëâ What do you know now, as a management board member, that you did not know before assuming this position? The above questions will be answered by experienced board members: üîπ Beata Stelmach - currently i.a. Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board of the Polish Association of Listed Companies, üîπ Olga Malinkiewicz, PhD - Co-founder, Member of the Management Board, and CTO of Saule Technologies Inc.. üîπ The discussion will be moderated by Anna Ziewalicz - Advocate, Managing Associate at GESSEL Attorneys at law. üìÖ Save the date and join us on Tuesday, June 18 at 5 p.m. (CEST). ‚úçÔ∏è Sign up here: https://lnkd.in/dkBgyDVm This webinar is an incredibly useful compendium of practical knowledge, combining both legal issues and personal experiences of women related to their participation in management boards.
