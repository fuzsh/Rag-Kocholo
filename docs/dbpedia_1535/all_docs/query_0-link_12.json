        "meta_description": "Rimbaud by Budzyński/Jacaszek/Trzaska, released 05 January 2016\n\n1. Armata\n2. Potop\n3. Matinee D’ivresse\n4. Fetes De La Faim\n5. Enfance\n6. Phrases\n7. Jesteście Fałszywymi Murzynami\n8. Ja To Ktoś Inny\n\nRIMBAUD is the outcome of an unexpected meeting of three outstanding personalities in the Polish music scene: saxophonist Mikołaj Trzaska, composer and producer Michał Jacaszek and the punk-rock legend Tomasz Budzyński. The music on the record is a captivating mix of free-jazz, electronica and punk. These three personalities – three vectors – create three distinct dynamics, each element following its own trajectory. However, with all their various means of expression and styles they manage to create a structure full of trance and surprise. And this combination of improvisation, electronica and vocal experiment may prove to be the greatest artistic sensation on the Polish music scene in 2015.\r\nRIMBAUD is a musical response to the visionary works of the French poet. Intense, rapid and colourful images of Arthur Rimbaud have provoked the artists to search for sonic equivalents of the endless spaces, intimate whispers, obsessive repetitions, and the destructive force of sea waves. A tap of your finger on the drum looses all sounds and begins the fresh harmony. (Rimbaud, Illuminations)",
