        "text": "As we look forward to the 4th of July holiday, fireworks, swimming, and grilling offer plenty of fun summer activities for families across Georgia. However, it's important to be cautious with fireworks, which can quickly turn your Independence Day celebrations sour. While public fireworks displays have safety measures to protect us, fireworks at home may be less safe, especially for kids!\n\nAccording to the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, over 10,000 individuals were treated in ERs for fireworks-related injuries in 2022, 38% of which were burns.\n\nWith summer camps in full gear and celebrations right around the corner, Wellstar sat down with Dr. Danny Branstetter, the chief medical officer of Wellstar Kennestone Regional Medical Center, and Dr. Joanna Dolgoff, a Wellstar pediatrician and representative for the American Academy of Pediatrics, to learn their safety tips for staying safe while we celebrate this holiday.\n\nAccording to Dr. Dolgoff, \"The most common injury from fireworks is a hand burn. But it can be worse, such as a hand fracture, cuts, or gashes, or even the loss of a finger,\" Dr. Dolgoff continued. \"Facial injuries, including burns and eye injuries, are also common. If you're going to handle fireworks, please be very careful.\"\n\nWe can be so caught up in the excitement of summer that we don't realize there are other seasonal injuries we should be careful to avoid. Dr. Branstetter reminds us that we see more water injuries like drownings and near drownings, water ski and boating accidents, and even head, neck and spine injuries from diving in shallow water.\n\nHe went on to share that with extreme heat, we should plan ahead to avoid heat-related exhaustion, stroke, and sunburns. And to be careful to prevent burns from items that can get hot from the summer sun, like playgrounds and seat belts.\n\nAnd let's not forget those pesky summer critters, \"insect and plant illnesses – from mosquito bites and allergic reactions to poison ivy, bee stings and snake bites.\"\n\nAs a pediatrician, Dr. Dolgoff often works with new parents who wonder if sparklers are safe. She stresses that parents should \"not underestimate the danger of sparklers. Sparklers burn at about 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, which is hot enough to melt some metals. They account for a high percentage of injuries, emergency room visits, and fires every year. The sparks can cause burns and eye injuries.\" And she added, remember to soak all sparklers in a bucket of water before throwing them away!\n\nIf your family plans to participate in holiday activities, remember the word FIRE with these essential safety tips!\n\nFamilies: Always avoid holding a lighted firework in your hand, and never point or throw it at another person. Children should never handle fireworks, including sparklers\n\nInjury: Fireworks should only be lit outdoors, away from people, houses, and other flammable materials. We recommend wearing protective eyewear to avoid eye injuries\n\nRun Off: Once you have lit a firework, move away quickly, do not light more than one firework at a time, and don't try to re-light fireworks that don't go off\n\nExtinguish: Keep a bucket of water nearby to extinguish fireworks that do not go off or spark a fiery mishap. Soak both used and unused fireworks in water for a few hours before discarding them\n\nDr. Angello Lin, the new transplant surgery section chief at Wellstar MCG Health Medical Center, had a light bulb moment when he took three years off during his 23-year tenure as a surgeon at the Medical University of South Carolina.\n\nHe took a break to spend time in Savannah with his father, who had turned 90 and was having health issues. During that time, Dr. Lin had time to think and realized that although he had become a transplant surgeon because the work seemed dynamic, his work had not been very dynamic lately. He had been solely focused on performing the transplantations and taking care of patients for 14 years.\n\n“I started to wonder if I could add some dynamism back by finding different and better ways to do a transplant,” he said.\n\nThe break served him well as Dr. Lin went on to become the first surgeon to successfully connect a pancreas and a kidney before putting it into the patient’s body, rather than putting them in separately. Implanting them as one organ with one arterial inflow and one venous outflow reduced the patient’s time in the operating room from four to six hours to two to three hours, making the procedure safer and giving patients the potential for a quicker recovery.\n\nDr. Lin, who graduated from Emory School of Medicine, found a renewed sense of purpose in innovation in surgery and decided he wanted to work at a hospital that would encourage his innovation. That led him to Wellstar MCG Health’s transplant center, which has received grants from the Mason Trust Foundation to enhance transplant research, education and patient care. The transplant center also performed a record 105 kidney transplants last year. “The surgery department here is very supportive of me trying new ways of doing things, and I was drawn to that,” he said.\n\nDr. Lin joined the hospital in February and is already working on a pilot project that infuses therapeutics that will hopefully reduce injuries to kidneys after transplantation from ischemia repercussion. He will also help the transplant center restart its pancreas transplant program.\n\nDr. Lin spends his time outside the hospital with his wife and three daughters: Jasmine, 24, who plans to go to medical school; Camille, 21, who is studying to become a pilot; and Abigail, 13, who is in eighth grade.\n\nBorn in Taiwan, Dr. Lin moved to Tybee Island as a teen and later graduated from Emory with a bachelor’s in chemistry. He first became interested in transplant surgery during his general surgery rotations as a fourth-year resident when he saw the difference transplantation made in patients’ lives. One story that stands out to him was when he was taking care of a retired chemistry professor, a liver transplant recipient who was near death. Although the patient was depressed, he told Dr. Lin about himself, including his favorite movie—\"Dead Poets Society”—and about his dream to travel the world. The next day, Dr. Lin came into the patient’s room, stood on a chair and recited the famous poem from the film to encourage the patient.\n\n“O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells,” he said. “Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills.”\n\nThe patient went on to recover and sent Dr. Lin postcards from his travels around the world.\n\n“After a successful kidney transplant, patients are so grateful and will say, ‘I can go to the bathroom again!’” he said. “They are excited to be able to do the everyday things our bodies do that we take for granted. It’s very touching.”\n\nFollowing residency, Dr. Lin became the first trainee to complete Emory’s transplant fellowship in 2000.\n\nNow Dr. Lin estimates he’s performed over 1,500 transplant surgeries. The most difficult part of the job remains working around the nationwide organ shortage. He has to be ready to drop everything when an organ is ready to be donated and, sadly, he also has to tell patients that they are at the mercy of the waitlist.\n\n“They look to us to be the miracle workers, and some days we come close,” he said.\n\nGeorgia’s oldest comprehensive stroke center at Wellstar MCG Health Medical Center was approved by The Joint Commission to renew its best-in-class certification.\n\nThe healthcare accrediting body has four advanced stroke certifications. Wellstar MCG Health has once again earned its most demanding certification—the Comprehensive Stroke Center (CSC) certification—which was designed for hospitals that can treat complex stroke cases.\n\nWellstar MCG Health’s stroke center, which provides care to a thousand patients annually, was the first hospital in Georgia to get the CSC certification when it was first offered in 2013.\n\nEvery two years, the program must get recertified, a process that requires surveyors from The Joint Commission to visit the center to observe practices and collect data, such as complication rates.\n\nThis year, two surveyors spent two days in April doing a comprehensive review of the stroke center.\n\nDr. Scott Rahimi, neurosurgical director of the stroke center, said this year’s review was the best they’ve had since becoming a CSC in 2013.\n\n“This year we took care of more stroke patients than any other facility in the CSRA,” he said.\n\nEight hospitals in Georgia have the CSC certification, including Wellstar Kennestone, Wellstar MCG Health and Wellstar North Fulton Medical Centers, but Wellstar MCG Health is the only in the region with the advanced certification, said Stroke Program Manager Amanda Howard.\n\n“This particular survey was very rewarding and made it worth all the hard work we do taking care of patients,” she said."
