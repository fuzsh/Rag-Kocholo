        "text": "Obraz Bernarda Bellotto (Canaletta) przedstawiający ruiny Colosseum w Rzymie ok połowy XVIII wieku. Na Zamku Królewskim w Warszawie znajduje się 25 olejów tego malarza, wyrwane z bolszewickiego gardła po wygranej wojnie w 1920 roku. Wielu malarzy podejmowało oczywiście temat Colosseum, włączając w to polskich (np. Świeszewski: https://polishartcorner.com/2016/09/17/aleksander-swieszewski-1839-1895-6/), lecz pędzel Bellotta oddaje toczące się wokół życie a nie tylko martwotę architektury. To Colossem to dla mnie przedsmak późniejszych widoków Warszawy tego malarza, pełnych toczącego się wówczas życia za panowania Stanisława Augusta Poniatowskiego.\n\nLot 17. Bernardo Bellotto Venice 1722–1780 Warsaw. Rome, a view of the Colosseum and the Arch of Constantine, oil on canvas unframed: 61 x 98.1 cm.; 24 x 38⅝ in. framed: 86 x 123 cm.; 33⅞ x 48⅜ in. Condition Report: The following condition report is provided by Hamish Dewar who is an external specialist and not an employee of Sotheby’s: Structural condition: The canvas has been lined onto a keyed wooden stretcher with one horizontal and one vertical cross-baton. The turnover edges are covered with brown paper tape. The canvas is taut and even and the overall structural condition would appear to be very good and secure. The lining has secured the pattern of fine lines of drying craquelure which are entirely stable and are not visually distracting. Paint surface: The paint surface has an even varnish layer. Inspection under ultraviolet light shows extensive retouchings, particularly in the sky. There is a thick band of retouching running across the sky above the Colosseum, and extensive retouchings in the sky on the right of the composition. There are also retouchings throughout the landscape, architecture and foreground. There may be further retouchings that I could not identify under ultraviolet. Summary: The painting would therefore appear to be in stable condition and the extent of retouchings applied in the past should be noted. Provenance: Private collection, New England; R.

Wonder and Light, Milan 2017, p. 268 (colour ill.)\n\nThe painting is part of a series of four well-known equestrian or horse portraits by Bernardo Bellotto and was created for the Polish King Stanislaus II August Poniatowski (1732-1798). In 1773, Bellotto noted in his records of works delivered for the court: “quattro picolli quadri di invenzione con cavalli presi dalla natura e Figure…”, for which he had received the sum of 200 ducats in total (Kozakiewicz, 1972, p. 388).\n\nWhile two of these paintings, “Colonel Königsfels teaching Prince Joseph Poniatowski how to ride” (fig. 1) and “Stable boy leading a horse” (fig. 2), are now in the National Museum in Warsaw, the “Equestrian Portrait of a Hussar Officer” (fig. 3) is in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (cf. Kozakiewicz, 1972, pp. 387-91, nos. 431-433). The whereabouts of the present work were unknown for a long time. Around 1910/11 it was documented through exhibitions and a black-and-white illustration in the Kent Collection, Florence, until it finally reappeared at an auction in Monaco in 1991, coming from a French private collection. In 2017, it was then illustrated in colour (probably for the first time) in a scientific publication by Bozena Anna Kowalczyk (Kowalczyk 2017, p. 268).\n\nThe almost square series of four – created for the Polish king – consists of two slightly horizontal formats and two slightly vertical formats. Presumably due to a lack of documentation, however, the literature gives the same dimensions for this painting as for the work in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, while the illustration in the exhibition catalogue of 1910 corresponds to today’s image. A comparable Capricci series by Bellotto with different formats, two horizontal and two vertical formats, can be found in the Galleria Nazionale in Parma (cf. Kowalczyk 2017, pp. 268 and 148).\n\nThe two Warsaw paintings depict horses and figures against the background of an imaginative, monumental Baroque architecture with palace wings, porticos, and an arcade; while the two vertical works show the proud horsemen riding out in a southern, equally imaginary landscape, which contains Capricci-like structures in the background. All four works are connected by the brilliant white horses that dominate them. The uniforms, glowing in red and green, also run through the paintings as a unifying element.\n\nIn contrast to the poses of the other works, the “Page Gintowt” and his white horse are depicted almost frontally. Both look up at the viewer and seem almost to be riding towards them. Alberto Rizzi describes this emotional expressive unity of horse and rider as follows: “This rider, seated in the saddle with Anglo-Saxon confidence, is somewhat reminiscent of those servants who adopt the manner of their masters, caricaturing them in the process… The young man’s upper body, as well as the head of his no less elegant horse, stand out against the sky, an effect that lends the depiction a majestic character.” (cf. Rizzi 1991, p. 133).\n\nThe subject is clearly identified by the original title “Le page Gintowt à cheval, suivi d’un palfrenier à livrée du Roi”, listed in the 1795 catalogue of the gallery of King Stanislaus II August Poniatowski (Mankowski 1932). Stefan Kozakiewicz devoted a separate essay to this group of horse paintings in 1967 and notes that the rider is wearing the Polish officer’s uniform, in contrast to the title (“Nobleman in Saxon Costume”) that was incorrectly transmitted in earlier exhibitions. It is possibly Celestino Dziewialtowski Gintowt, later Major of the Royal Army and Adjutant General to the King (“È probabilmente Celestino Dziewialtowski Gintowt, figlio di Antonio, nel 1779 maggiore dell’esercito della Corona, nel 1780 aiutante di campo generale del re”, cf. Kozakiewicz 1967, p. 42, footnote 21).\n\nEven though the roots of such depictions of horses in the context of portraits of rulers or illustrations of riding schools go back to the 16th century, this series is unique in Bellotto’s oeuvre. They are the artist’s first genre paintings. “Although scenes from real life played a major role in his vedute, they were never before the main subject of representation. The fact that they became such in the Warsaw period corresponds to the greater importance that the staffage generally assumed in the views from that period. Even if they were not given a leading position in the vedute, they were still in full harmony with the real surroundings; here, however, where they are the main subject, the artist places them in an unreal setting”. Whereas until now horses had only been staffage elements in Bellotto’s vedute, here they become the protagonists. Both the figures depicted are certain people close to the court and the horses were presumably studied directly by Bellotto in the royal stables – “presi dalla natura”, as the artist himself notes. “The artist probably received the inspiration for these paintings from the king while working on the large “View of Warsaw from the Terrace of the Royal Castle” (fig. 4), painted in the same year 1773: it had familiarised Bellotto with the subjects and persons of his first genre paintings.” (cf. Kozakiewicz 1972, vol. 1, pp. 165 + 174ff.).\n\nIn addition to the preferences of his royal patron, the artist’s own interest in horses probably also played a major role in the creation of these late works – Bellotto died in Warsaw in 1780 as a result of a stroke. Trained in the workshop of his famous uncle Antonio Canal (1697-1768), whose nickname “Canaletto” he subsequently adopted, Bernardo Bellotto specialised primarily in vedute: first, following the tradition, of his native Venice, then later the cities of his respective clients, such as Dresden, Munich, Vienna and finally Warsaw. In “Capricci with the Capitol” (Galleria Nazionale, Parma), painted in 1746, Bellotto used a horse as a striking figure element for the first time. From then on, horses, riders and carriages increasingly played a role as staffage in his capricci and vedute. In addition to his own studies, the depictions of contemporary artist colleagues, such as the famous English horse painter George Stubbs (1724-1806), presumably also served as inspiration (cf. Kowalczyk 2017, pp. 268 and 148).\n\nLot 15. BERNARDO BELLOTTO (VENICE 1721-1780 WARSAW). Venice, the Grand Canal with the Rialto Bridge seen from the South, oil on canvas, 24 x 36 in.
