Tell us a little bit about how Sophie Muller was involved with this video. Could this have been what led Eurythmics and Annie to work her later on in their career?

Sophie worked helping out on the lighting and she edited the film at the Royal College of Art in a 16mm Steenbeck. After she left the film school she started working for a company called the Oil Factory which Dave’s brother started up. She once told me that she bumped into Dave at the Oil Factory offices. Dave remembered her from the The Walk shoot and asked her to work with them on a new video. Sophie could fill you in better but that’s how I think it went.

What eventually happened to the video? Why was it never shown or

released?

No idea about that one. The original print of the film got lost but by that point I wasn’t in contact with anyone involved in the production so I didn’t know whether it had been on television or not.

Is there anything that we haven’t covered so far?

I had no idea that the video was so rare and I’m glad that so many people appreciate it after such a long time.

Special thanks for Marek for taking the time to answer these questions.
