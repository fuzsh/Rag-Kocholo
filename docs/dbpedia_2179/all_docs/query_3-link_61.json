        "text": "AFTER rocking their way to success in 2021's Eurovision Song Contest, Italian band Måneskin have become unstoppable.\n\nTheir unique style and sound ensures they are unforgettable - and has earned them an army of dedicated fans around the world.\n\nWho are Italian rock band Måneskin?\n\nMåneskin is an Italian rock band who got together in 2016, made up of vocalist Damiano David, bassist Victoria De Angelis, guitarist Thomas Raggi, and drummer Ethan Torchio.\n\nThey shot to fame after finishing as runners-up on the Italian X Factor in 2017.\n\nThe group then gained international stardom after being crowned winners of the 2021 Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nBut their win was tainted by claims lead singer Damiano snorted cocaine on live TV - although he later took a voluntary drugs test to prove his innocence and Eurovision confirmed he had passed.\n\nDespite the controversy, Måneskin have continued to climb the ranks and are conquering the US.\n\nAlongside performances at the American Music Awards, MTV EMAs and The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon, they have shared the stage with some of music's elite.\n\nThey sang alongside Ed Sheeran and Elton John at the Paris leg of Global Citizen Live in September 2021.\n\nThe band then supported the Rolling Stones the following month in Las Vegas, which frontman Mick Jagger dubbed \"a great night\".\n\nMåneskin are now set to perform at 2022's Coachella festival in April after making their debut on Saturday Night Live on January 22.\n\nTickets sold out in 15 minutes for their entire 16-date Loud Kids tour which is due to kick off in February.\n\nWhy is the band called Måneskin?\n\nMåneskin are loud and proud about their uniqueness, so it's no surprise they even incorporated this into the band's name.\n\nTheir quirky title means Moonshine in Danish.\n\nThey decided to adopt the name as they loved how it sounded and in a special nod to Victoria De Angelis' Danish heritage.\n\nWhat are Måneskin's best songs?\n\nMåneskin's most successful song has been their cover of Frankie Valli's classic Beggin, which they first recorded in 2017 after performing it on X Factor.\n\nIt soared the charts after their Eurovision win, while going viral on TikTok - seeing it reach number one in 9 countries and the top five in 19 others.\n\nIn the US, the song topped both the rock and alternative charts, while peaking at No. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe track also has an impressive number of streams, with over 750 million plays on Spotify - as well as earning them three million sales internationally.\n\nThe eccentric musicians have also been applauded for their breakout song, 'Zitti E Buoni’ which they sang a Eurovision.\n\nThe song - which means \"shut up and good\" in English - reached the top 10 of the Billboard Global 200 chart.\n\nIt went 5 times Platinum in their homeland Italy, after selling around 350,000 copies.\n\nMåneskin's have released two studio albums, entitled 'Il ballo della vita' in 2018 and 'Teatro d'ira: Vol. I' in 2021, with a number of acclaimed singles.\n\nOther notable songs include I Wanna Be Your Slave, which they later remixed with rock icon Iggy Pop, and Coraline."
