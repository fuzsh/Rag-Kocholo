First used by 17th-century Italian composers, the terminology has since spread to the rest of the world.\n\n1. Tempo\n\nList of tempo markings.

In modern music, a metronome mark indicating the number of BPM (such as ♩= 120) may supplement or replace the tempo marking.\n\nTerm Meaning BPM adagietto rather slow, slightly faster than adagio 72-76 adagio slow 66-76 allegretto moderately fast, slightly slower than allegro 112-120 allegrissimo very fast, faster than allegro 172-176 allegro fast 120-168 allegro moderato moderately fast, slightly slower than allegro 116-120 andante walking pace 76-108 andante moderato moderate walking pace, faster than andante 92-112 andantino moderate tempo, slightly faster than andante 80-108 grave very slow 25-45 larghetto rather slow and broad, slightly faster than largo 60-66 larghissimo extremely slow, slower than largo 25 and below largo very slow and broad 40-60 lento slow 45-60 moderato moderately 108-120 prestissimo extremely fast, faster than presto 200 and above presto very fast 168-200 vivace fast and lively 140-176 vivacissimo very fast and lively, faster than vivace 172-176\n\nTempo changes\n\nList of tempo changes.
