Their second son, Matteo, was born on 8 October 1997. Both sons are musical; Amos has played piano alongside his father in various TV appearances, while Matteo has released a number of duets with him, including the hit ‘Fall on Me’ which appeared in Disney’s The Nutcracker and The Four Realms.\n\nSpeaking to Billboard about the difference between his and Matteo’s voices, Andrea said: “Technically they are very different, but there is one thing that makes them most similar: the attitude.”\n\nBocelli’s youngest, Virginia, turned 10 years old in 2022. She is also musical, singing ‘Hallelujah’ and ‘Ich Liebe Dich’ in videos with her father that have proved very popular with fans.\n\nAndrea & Matteo Bocelli- Fall On Me\n\nWhere does Andrea Bocelli live?\n\nBocelli lives in a former hotel in the charming town of Forte dei Marmi in Tuscany, with his wife and daughter.\n\nRead more: Where does Andrea Bocelli live? Behind the scenes in his Italian family home\n\nHow did Andrea Bocelli become famous?\n\nDespite the setback with his sight, the young Andrea showed huge potential as a singer, winning his first competition aged just 14 with a rendition of the Neapolitan song ‘O Sole Mio’. However, it didn’t seem that music was quite the right career choice for Bocelli – he went to the University of Pisa to study law, but kept singing in bars for extra money.\n\nThen, Bocelli’s luck changed when a demo tape of him singing found its way into the hands of Luciano Pavarotti, via the Italian rock star Zucchero. Bocelli was invited on tour with Zucchero, where the two performed the song ‘Miserere’ together. Pavarotti remained supportive of Bocelli in the early days of his career, inviting him to perform at his annual charity gala concert in Modena, Pavarotti & Friends.\n\nWhat is Andrea Bocelli’s most famous song?\n\nAndrea’s massive-selling duet with Sarah Brightman, ‘Time To Say Goodbye’, was originally intended as a farewell song to boxer Henry Maske (who was friends with Brightman), and was first performed at his final fight in 1996.\n\nIt has become one of the most successful singles in history, breaking records across the world and becoming Bocelli’s signature song, as both a solo and duet.\n\n‘The Prayer’, a duet Bocelli recorded with Celine Dion in 1999, and Puccini’s glorious tenor aria ‘Nessun dorma’, have also become melodies closely associated with Bocelli. The tenor most recently sang the aria at The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee concert.\n\nRead more: Andrea Bocelli’s greatest ever songs\n\nAndrea Bocelli sings ‘Time To Say Goodbye’ (live at The Global Awards 2018)\n\nWho are Andrea Bocelli’s parents?\n\nAndrea Bocelli was born the son of Alessandro and Edi Bocelli. His family lived on a farm, selling farm machinery and making wine for a living.\n\nAlong with his brother, Alberto, Andrea now has his very own brand of wine. Made from grapes grown on his family farm, the ‘Bocelli Family’ label has already wowed wine critics and earned the Bocellis the respect of the wine-making world.\n\nWhat is Andrea Bocelli’s vocal range?\n\nAndrea Bocelli is a tenor, whose range is estimated to span from around C sharp 2, up to D5.\n\nHis stylistic range spans from crossover pop hits, to complete operas. In 1998, Bocelli took to the dramatic stage for the first time when he played the role of Rodolfo in Puccini’s La bohème, at the Teatro Comunale in Cagliari. He has also sung Puccini’s Madam Butterfly and Tosca, and Verdi’s Requiem, live.\n\nAndrea Bocelli and Joseph Calleja duet in Malta\n\nAndrea Bocelli’s albums: what was his debut, and his latest, album?\n\nBocelli’s debut album, Il mare calmo della sera (1994) was a classical crossover album which included Puccini’s great aria ‘E lucevan le stelle’.\n\nThe star tenor has released 17 albums in total, most recently Believe, which came out in November 2020. It features a duet with Alison Krauss and a previously unheard track by the late film great, Ennio Morricone.\n\nIn October 2022, the tenor released a Christmas album with his son Matteo, and daughter Virginia. A Family Christmas features trio arrangements of traditional carols and new compositions specially written for the family.\n\nWatch as Andrea Bocelli sings in Milan's empty Duomo cathedral"
