        "text": "I’m Italian so I’m very happy to know that we were pioneer in the field of Electroacoustic music in the late '60.\n\nThis website is great to know a little bit more about the history of Electronic Music\n\nThis is fantastic thank you\n\nSiel, Farfisa, Elka, Eko… Moroder, Gigi Masin, Alexander Robotnick to name but a few… the whole Italian Disco thing… Italy has a great heritage in electronic music from that era and beyond!\n\nDaniele Davoli, Joe T Vanelli, Gianfranco Bortolotti, Alex Neri, Pierre Feroldi and Stefano Secchi deserve adding to that list to name but a few. Also labels like X Energy, Media, Palmares, GGM etc.\n\nCan’t understate the importance of the Dance Floor Corporation\n\nNot a specific artist but perhaps worth researching a bit more:\n\nI see that your original post references this\n\nGiorgio Sancristoforo’s (a contemporary experimental musician in his on right) ‘Berna3’ software draws inspiration from the above:\n\nGrazie per il link @emadb!\n\nA name that I’d like to share Is Paolo Tofani: guitarist of the italian experimental jazz-rock band Area.\n\nHe was a friend and collaborator of Peter Zinovieff of EMS; One of the very earliest use of a “synth-guitar” was made indeed from Paolo’s experimentations: he connected his Gibson doublecut to a synthi AKS via some special pickups (later evolved in a dedicated synth prototype IIRC).\n\nYou can hear that on the main riff of Luglio, Agosto, Settembre (Nero), starting at 01:05.\n\nI don’t remember if I read It in a interview or was just an old rumor but it seems that Paolo was contacted by a young Brian Eno to play whit his newborn band Roxy Music; But he decided to leave London and came back to Italy to form his own project, Area.\n\nAnd then there was the infamous leader of the Italian electronic mafia, Don Buchla\n\nAnyway the website is full of interesting content about electronic music: Music, Makers & Machines — Google Arts & Culture\n\n…and there is also the WDR Studio in Cologne (even before the Italians): Sounds of Cologne — Google Arts & Culture\n\nSo many good Italian artists, not least the whole Italo disco scene which pretty much got global acclaim at least in the better clubs, but even sometimes in the mainstream. Molto bene!\n\nYeah I’ve got a few bits on DFC. RA-RE, Mighty Quinn and of course Discomagic (and all their sub labels) and Italian Style. So many good labels and memorable tunes came out of Italy during that period\n\nHere’s an older thread with some choice posts https://www.elektronauts.com/t/your-italo-favs/\n\nNice!! Reviving that thread for real…\n\nDon’t forget about Battiato\n\nGet those Spaniards outta here! (j/k, love EG)\n\nCan’t find a streamable version but this rocks: Marino Zuccheri\n\nTeresa Rampazzi as well:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MptucQxC2x8\n\nthis one is also very good (and not streamable!) https://www.discogs.com/release/8567979-Teresa-Rampazzi-Immagini-Per-Diana-Baylon\n\nThey’re from Spain.\n\nKoto (Anfrando Maiola and Stefano Cundari) was very fresh at the time.\n\ngnaaaaa i am always bad in remembering where someone comes from, i just remember if i like the music …\n\nJust the tip of the iceberg of the early 1970’s Italian Library music artists who were\n\nproducing some great sounds and rhythms.\n\nNeed a small fortune if you want to collect the originals"
