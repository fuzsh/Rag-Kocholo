        "text": "When I booked my first trip to Afghanistan in 2024, I decided to try learning some Dari language in the 15 weeks before my trip. To learn Dari, I’ve found, you need some tools. Frankly, there’s not a lot of information on how to learn Dari out there on the internet. It’s a pretty tough language without many resources.\n\nAs far as I can tell, you can’t walk into a library or bookstore and find Dari language books, unlike bigger languages like Spanish, French, or Arabic.\n\nSo I knew I’d need some tools on my journey. I was already casually learning Spanish (no real time set aside for it), so I was familiar with the popular apps for language learning, like Duolingo. Unfortunately, Duolingo does not offer Dari courses. Which is surprising, with some of the languages they do offer.\n\nAnyway, Duolingo is great, but it has its flaws. For me, with my 300+ day Spanish streak, I find myself breezing through lessons and treating them as a chore. Yes, I’m learning a bit. But Duolingo serves as a fun reminder to practice Spanish, not my primary source of education.\n\nSo I wasn’t too bummed that Dari isn’t available on Duolingo.\n\nThe Languages of Afghanistan\n\nAfghanistan is home to people who speak many different languages. There are multiple prominent ethnicities there, too. Tajiks, Hazaras, Pashtuns, and Uzbeks are names I’ve come across while reading books about Afghanistan (I read some great books to prepare for my unfortunately cancelled trip).\n\nA quick Google search tells me there are over 40 languages in Afghanistan, but two are primary: Dari Persian (or Farsi) and Pashto. When I decided to learn the language of this mountainous land, I wasn’t sure which language was most appropriate.\n\nAsking around (to my tutor and Against the Compass guides), here’s what I learned about Afghanistan’s major languages…\n\nDari vs. Farsi\n\nDari and Farsi are two names for the same Persian language, which is prominent in Iran and Afghanistan. In fact, the Farsi (or Dari as many Afghans call it) spoken in the two separate countries is the same, only accents and some vocabulary are different. I’m no expert, but perhaps it’s something similar to British English and American English. I found in some of the books about Afghanistan I’ve read, the term Farsi was used often, and many Afghans continue to call their official language this historically Persian word.\n\nThe writing systems of Farsi and Dari are much closer together than the spoken languages, so reading and writing sees almost no difference. Writing is based on a more formal, literary representation of the language, while spoken Dari and Farsi (and their many dialects) tend to take on nuances unique to different cultures and regions.\n\nConfirmed! Dari vs Farsi\n\nAccording to my Dari tutor, the differences between Dari and Farsi are similar to American English versus British English. He’s a native Dari speaker who lives in Kandahar, Afghanistan. For me, this is reassuring. There are many more resources online for learning Farsi, and when I’m looking for something in Dari, I usually find more Farsi resources.\n\nThis article from 2017 paints a picture of some of the tensions and historical complexities around the different names for Dari/Farsi.\n\nIn my favorite language-learning app, italki, both Dari and Persian (Farsi) are offered. Clicking either one, you’ll see some of the same teachers. As far as I can tell, they’re mostly interchangeable. Always look for a tutor who is familiar with the place you’re traveling to!\n\nPashto\n\nWell, what about Pashto? Pashto is another prominent language of Afghanistan spoken by ethnic Pashtuns, who (as far as I can tell) mostly dwell in the southern and eastern regions of the country. When I was planning my trip, I was told (by my Afghan italki tutor and my ATC tour guide) that Dari was the safer language to learn. Pashto is an entirely different language than Dari or Farsi. I’d be in the northern areas of Afghanistan, and many Pashtun people also speak Dari, since it’s the official language of the country.\n\nMaybe next time, Pashto.\n\nGreater Khorasan\n\nIf you’re traveling to Greater Khorasan (a quick Google search can show you this region), you’ll be in Farsi-speaking territory. Depending on where you are, you might come across Persian Farsi (Iran), Dari (Afghanistan), Hazaragi, Tajik, and more! These are all dialects of the same language.\n\nPashto speakers will live south of this region, in Afghanistan. Though Dari is widely spoken in larger cities, like Kandahar.\n\nShould I learn Dari or Farsi?\n\nDari and Farsi are two dialects of the same language, so which one you learn will depend on your travel plans and cultural interests. It’s the difference in learning British English or American English. They’re mutually intelligible, meaning someone who speaks Afghan Dari can hold a conversation very well with another person speaking Persian Farsi.\n\nI chose to learn Dari because of my interests in Afghanistan: the mountains, the history, and the culture. Herat, a city in western Afghanistan, was once known for it’s arts, poetry, and literature (though I imagine they speak a Farsi closer to Persian). If Iran is more fascinating to you, find a Persian Farsi tutor (on italki there’re plenty).\n\nEven these two beautiful languages have internal dialects that differ. Across Afghanistan, even just from Herat to Kabul, you’ll hear many dialects of Dari, according to my Kandahar-based Dari teacher.\n\nAs you progress in whichever dialect you choose, you’ll find yourself learning more about the other dialects, too, especially if you have a good tutor.\n\nA Bamyan sunset, by Farid Ershad\n\nThe Best Advice I’ve Received\n\nWhen I started studying with a Mexican Spanish teacher on italki, he told me a very worthwhile piece of advice: when you begin learning a language, you are like a baby. Babies learn languages by listening, speaking sounds, and lots more listening. He told me not to write, not to read. These slow you down, confuse you, and (most importantly), they do not give you an ear for the language.\n\nWhat happens when you don’t have an ear for the language?\n\nYou can’t follow conversations. Or listen and respond. You can’t communicate when you don’t begin like a baby.\n\nI’m a big reader, and I love writing. Writing helps me memorize things. I’ve spend lots of time in my journey to learn Dari writing English phonetics (Dari words spelled in English letters) of Dari words.\n\nBut the most important thing you can do when learning a new language isn’t to read and write. “Don’t read at all!” he told me.\n\nHis guidance is backed up by this Language Learning Roadmap by Dreaming in Spanish (a very useful document for determining where you’re starting with a language). This professional, trusted guide in the language-learning world doesn’t recommend reading until you have over 600 hours of language practice under your belt.\n\nIn short, listen to Dari as you’re learning it. Nay, listen to Dari to learn it.\n\nTo learn Dari and eventually progress to reading it, I won’t be focusing on its beautiful alphabet at all.\n\nThat’s a bit of relief, isn’t it?\n\nShrinks the language down to just the sounds and the meanings.\n\nThat’s how I’m being taught to learn Dari.\n\nI’m going to break it down for you…\n\nFree Resources to Learn Dari\n\nSomeone people like to keep things free. I get that. Don’t skip the rest of this article (because I think you’ll want to try italki, but use these great free resources, too. There aren’t tons of Dari YouTube videos, and not a lot of free listening content. That’s a problem. But if you pair some active listening (which you may need to pay for) with these free resources, you’ll be in good shape.\n\nGeorgetown University Dari Textbooks: now, the textbooks themselves aren’t free, but the listening lessons that accompany them are. Click here to check out the two levels (Elementary and Intermediate). Just click the “multimedia” links, select your chapter, and start listening. My Dari teacher uses these textbooks, I believe.\n\nDefense Language Institute Course: I’ll mention this one down below again, but my goodness this is a complete, free course. Click here to see all the associated resources.\n\nPersian Grammar Sketch: yes, it’s Persian, not Dari, but it’s got ~80 pages of grammar concepts and explanations for anyone who’s been studying for a little while. Make sure you do plenty of listening, don’t get bogged down reading. Click here to check it out, or shoot me an email and I can send you the PDF.\n\nConversational Dari by Eugene H. Glassman: a 400 page book written in 1971 with 25 intensive lessons. Check it out here.\n\nThe Best Apps to Learn Dari\n\nI’m using the word “apps” because it’s most appropriate, but this list is comprised of resources I’m using to learn Dari. If needed, I’ll update them throughout my journey–and hopefully it’s a long journey! I guess it all depends on how much I enjoy visiting Afghanistan (update: my trip was cancelled–but I’m still learning Dari!). If I never ever ever want to go back, I may move on from Dari and perhaps focus on the Persian dialect (because of the deep literature and poetry in Persian culture). But Afghanistan is full of mountains, and I love mountains, so I think Dari and I are beginning a long walk together. We’ll see.\n\nHere is my Dari language stack, AKA everything I’m using to learn Dari…\n\n1. italki\n\nitalki is a language learning site and app that boasts this tagline: Become fluent in any language.\n\nAnd so far, I believe it.\n\nitalki is full of rock star tutors who want to help people learn languages. There must be hundreds of highly rated, professional tutors on this app & website! They have introduction videos, a bio & qualifications, and open inboxes where you can ask questions. You can even take some trial lessons with tutors, risk free.\n\nI’ve already spent hours on italki with my Dari tutor, Ahmad. He’s a teacher by trade and tutors students around the world in Dari, Pashto, Farsi, and English.\n\nitalki is easy to use and navigate, I really enjoy just browsing the app for new language teachers.\n\nLearning Dari with italki\n\nThere are two huge benefits to using italki to learn Dari: affordability and accessibility. The app has a very clean user interface and performs very well. I’d say it’s the perfect tutoring app, and I wish I’d found it sooner. I’m quite sure I’ll use it for more languages, too, not just Dari. Exploring the app is like walking through a brightly lit store of knowledge and treasures!\n\nAffordability\n\nBecause Dari is a language that is spoken in Afghanistan, it doesn’t cost much money to learn it. The cost of living in Afghanistan is very low, so a little goes a long way. You’ll notice on italki that Spanish and French teachers with similar credentials and experience (and reviews) charge much more than Dari teachers. My 60 minute Dari lessons are $10 per lesson, so $10 per hour. My sister’s French tutor, on the other hand, charges $33 per hour. If you spend 1,000 hours studying these languages, you’ll spend $10,000 on Dari and $33,000 on French. Yikes!\n\nAccessibility\n\nDari is a language without many online resources. If you’re a native English speaker, or European, Dari is likely an incredibly strange (and beautiful) language to you. It’s musical, it uses an Perso-Arabic alphabet script, and much of the translations are not obvious. There are many underlying religious themes to basic phrases (like Salaam Alaykum and khoda hafez, or hello and goodbye). Indeed, many of the early phrases I’ve learned in Dari for greeting are not as simple as hello and how are you?\n\nI’m convinced you need a teacher to learn Dari (or Farsi). With italki, you’ll find many teachers with thousands of ratings and reviews. Their profiles even list how many students they’ve worked with.\n\nFinally, italki knows how to find you the perfect tutor or teacher. When finding a teacher, you can select preferences for your teacher’s…\n\nNative language\n\nWhere they’re from (amazing if you’re traveling somewhere specific)\n\nOther languages spoken\n\nPrice range\n\nSo if you’re traveling to Afghanistan, you’d look for Dari tutors from Afghanistan! Perhaps you’d also want them to speak Pashto, or Arabic. You’re able to make those preferences. With their photos and introduction videos displayed, you’re also able to sort of interview teachers before messaging them. Oh! Yes, you can also message them to introduce yourself and ask questions. I message a few teachers before selecting one, no matter which language I’m exploring.\n\nI’m a big italki fan.\n\nMy Favorite Feature\n\nMy favorite italki feature is choosing where you’re teacher is from. When I started taking Spanish more seriously, I found an instructor from my wife’s home state of Guanajuato in Mexico, where we’d traveled to. Plus, I got the authentic Mexican Spanish her family speaks.\n\n2. Pimsleur\n\nPimsleur is an app that rejects memorization (no note-taking), instead focusing on pronunciation, repetition, and internalization. In other words, Pimsleur focuses on listening and speaking.\n\nWell, don’t they all?\n\nNot really.\n\nPimsleur teaches in 30 minute lessons. Each lesson is just listening to a short conversation, and responding aloud. Throughout the lessons, the native speakers teach you the sounds and nuances of the words (through their beginner-level conversation), while the narrator teaches you the meanings.\n\nI have friends who use Pimsleur, and I do too, and it’s been recommended by my language teachers.\n\nIf you’ve used an app like Duolingo (which does not offer Dari), you’ll be pleasantly surprised at just how intentional another language learning app can be. No offense, Duolingo.\n\nIt’s pretty amazing that Pimsleur offers Dari amongst its 50+ languages. And while the Dari course isn’t as extensive as some others (looking at you, Spanish and Japanese), it’s been an amazing addition to my Dari language learning stack. I’ve used it from the beginning, and it has walked very well alongside my https://pinetreepoet.com/italki-review/italki lessons.\n\nWhen you’re learning with Pimsleur, go slow. Pause the lesson when necessary to think and respond. Don’t race the native speakers to respond, go slow and think, then respond, then listen. You get a lot out of the app this way. And don’t be afraid to repeat lessons, if necessary, as recommended by the app.\n\nFor anyone who wants to learn Dari, purchase a Pimsleur subscription. It’s well worth the cost for access to so much language learning potential, and such intentional direction, backed up by research.\n\nIf face-to-face tutoring with italki isn’t your cup of chai, Pimsleur is the next best thing. When you pair them together, you’ll be amazing how fast you progress in learning Dari.\n\n3. Podcasts to help learn Dari\n\nBeyond italki and Pimsleur, I had to do some digging for more resources. After I was told to listen, listen often, and listen more when learning languages, I decided to try and find some resources to listen to. Frankly, there isn’t much out there for Dari. YouTube really only has this video, which isn’t very practical. It just shows you 200 phrases and how to pronounce them. I wouldn’t try to learn a language like that…\n\nAfghan News\n\nI listen to Afghan news to practice listening to the language. After only 10 hours of studying Dari, I was able to catch some familiar words! This is passive learning. I’m not sweating over every phrase, pausing and rewinding, and taking notes. None of those. On the advice of my italki Spanish tutor, I am just experiencing and hearing the language, like a baby!\n\nI use a free news network (VOA Dari) to listen to native Dari speakers. You can check it out on Apple Podcasts here or YouTube here.\n\nVoices of America (VOA Dari) is American government funded project to broadcast news in 45+ languages to over 350 million people around the world. Talk about propaganda! Only kidding, it seems to be a reliably neutral news network serving many different cultures.\n\nI highly recommend this resource for listening to smooth, native Dari. Even though I can’t understand much of it, I get excited when I recognize a verb, number, or adjective!\n\nBased on teachers I’ve talked to, and my own experience, you really ought to listen to some native Dari, and this seems to be one good option out there. It’s slim pickings, though.\n\nChai and Conversation\n\nChai and Conversation is actually a Persian Farsi educational podcast and website (with a neat language course), not Dari. While I don’t pay for their premium website course, I like the podcast because I like learning about the culture of Persia, and it gives me some exposure to words used in Dari and Farsi. Plus, they talk a lot about poetry. Maybe that’s the reason I listen!.\n\nAgain, Chai and Conversation is not a Dari learning platform necessarily, but I enjoy the content and exposure to new words. I can always run the words by my italki Dari teacher if I have questions.\n\nListening to Chai and Conversation vocabulary lessons, I recognized most of the words from learning Dari. So it’s a good resource for expanding your vocab, and learning a thing or two.\n\n4. Defense Language Institute Course\n\nWhoa! That sounds serious, huh? Well, it’s a serious Dari course. For free, you can access the U.S. Defense Language Institute’s Dari course which, you can imagine, was used to train government employees and military members for their time in Afghanistan during America’s occupation.\n\nI do not recommend too much time in this document. You can get really bogged down with the alphabet, and it’s not always relevant. However, I like to skim it here and there and see if I can pick up some new words.\n\nRemember, listening is key! Don’t get stuck reading things slowly in your head with improper pronunciations.\n\nBut if you want to check out this comprehensive Dari language course, check out all the material right here.\n\n5. Conversational Dari: An Introductory Course in Dari by Eugene H. Glassman\n\nAlright, we’re reaching a bit here. This is a book published in 1971, and while physical copies are expensive, you can access a PDF file of it right here. The book is almost 400 pages (consisting of 25 intensive lessons), including vocabulary, pronunciation guides, and everything else you need to know about conversational Dari.\n\nIs the book relevant?\n\nAs far as I can tell, it’s an excellent resource for learning Dari, though it doesn’t shy away from recommending certain exercises only be done with a teacher.\n\nWhile the PDF of the book looks pretty outdated, it’s fun to look through and see things explained on paper. Sometimes, when working with Pimsleur and an italki tutor, you’ll hear things and forget them. By browsing resources like Conversational Dari, you might recall and practice with things you’ve heard.\n\nI would definitely check out Glassman’s Dari course. If you’d like me to send you the PDF (I’ve downloaded it), leave a comment at the bottom of this post. But you can access it easily with the link above.\n\n6. An Introduction to Colloquial Kabul Persian\n\nEven older than Glassman’s book, DLI published this guide in 1966 to teach conversational Dari, before it was even called Dari. But even the author recommends that “the best way to study these materials is with an Afghan informant from Kabul.” I like this book (and Glassman’s) because it provides context, common mistakes, and pronunciation guides based on American English. That’s helpful. Just like the two previous resources I listed, I recommend using this one sparingly and for fun.\n\nKeep your attention on listening rather than traditional textbook or written material.\n\nNader Khan Hill, Kabul, by Qasim Mirzaie\n\nDari Language Stack\n\nAlright, so how do we pile these apps and resources up to learn Dari? Well, to start, you should practice Dari every single day, just like if you were learning any other language. I practice Dari 5 days per week, with some combination of the following resources and tools. Nearly all of my daily practice is listening.\n\nI built my routine based on the advice of my experienced italki tutors. Here’s my daily, weekly, monthly goals with learning Dari…\n\nPassive vs Active Practice\n\nPracticing a new language is of course an active practice, but there are lots of passive ways to learn, too. Active practice is intently listening, responding, and internalizing the new language. Here are some examples of active language practice with Dari…\n\nitalki tutoring\n\nPimsleur practice\n\nRehearsal by yourself, or with a friend\n\nHomework assigned by your teacher (Ahmad, my teacher, gives me assignments after each class. They only take about 20 minutes.)\n\nPassive language practice doesn’t require much work, just some time and curiosity. It’s listening! It could be podcasts or Netflix without subtitles. There’s no note-taking, rehearsal, or memorization. Passive learning is all about learning like a baby: just listening and absorbing.\n\nI was told passive exercises water the flower of language learning. Without listening (and listening often), your flower will whither and die. Not my words, but an italki tutor. So far, my only passive exercise to learn Dari is the VOA Dari podcast, mentioned above. There just aren’t tons of Dari resources out there.\n\n1. Daily Dari Practice\n\nTo start, I listen to 30-60 minutes of VOA Dari (the news podcast I mentioned above), 4-5 days per week. The newscasts are all exactly 30 minutes, so one or two of these each day is perfect. I listen to this newscast whether I have other lessons planned or not. While walking, commuting to work, riding a bike, or exercising you can make great strides in Dari without much mental energy expended. After just a few weeks of studying Dari, I recognized quite a few words on the podcast!\n\nSecondly, I take Dari lessons on italki. Right now, I’m doing four tutoring sessions per week in addition to my VOA Dari podcast. italki tutoring has been huge for me. Speaking to someone from Afghanistan for an hour each day helps with pronunciation, the idioms and peculiarities of Dari, and understanding grammar. My tutor practices speaking and listening with me, gives me simple homework assignments that build over time, and offers consistent feedback.\n\nitalki tutoring is indispensable for learning a new language, especially one as unique as Dari or Farsi.\n\nFinally, I use Pimsleur each day (or ~4 days per week, my “study days”). Pimsleur offers 30 minute intense language study sessions, all based on real, native conversation. I was surprised to find Dari on Pimsleur, so certainly take advantage of this resource.\n\nFinally, I do some writing practice. Often this is assigned homework by my teacher, Ahmad. I internalize things very well when I write them, especially when I challenge myself with new vocab and grammar. So if your italki tutor gives homework, do it and do it well! We’re not learning the Dari alphabet yet, so this homework is written with the English alphabet–it’s a little strange to write words like khanom-e ma maqool ast, but remember you’ve got to do plenty of listening to learn a language, not get bogged down with writing things you may not understand.\n\nIn summary, 4-5 days per week I listen to 1 or 2 episodes of VOA Dari, take a 60 minute italki lesson, do one Pimsleur unit, and complete my homework, or some casual sentence-writing to practice and internalize what I’ve learned.\n\nHere and there, too, I check out Farsi content (like the Chai and Conversation podcast) or one of the older, educational books I listed above.\n\n2. Weekly Dari Practice\n\nMy goal for actively learning Dari is 8 hours per week. That’s 4 italki sessions (60 minutes each) and 4 Pimsleur units with practice exercises (30 minutes each), plus some time for homework and some writing practice. Additionally, I might browse the Defense Language Institute’s extensive Dari course.\n\nBut that’s all active learning.\n\nOn top of those 8 hours, I aim to get 3-7 hours of passive listening on VOA Dari. This isn’t much more than me getting excited when I recognize one in every hundred words.\n\nPro Tip\n\nIf you’re ever trying to figure out a word in Dari, but can’t, look up the Farsi word. There are way more Farsi/Persian resources online than Dari. Usually, the word will be correct, but you can always ask your tutor. Or ask me below in the comments and I’ll find out for you during my next session!\n\n3. Monthly Dari Practice (Goals)\n\nEdit: after 3 months of learning Dari, I adjusted my goals to fit my schedule better. Tap here or scroll to Month 3 to see my more realistic language learning targets.\n\nSo how do these daily and weekly exercises stack up into monthly goals? Well, here’s about how much I want to practice Dari over the course of a month. Please note, I’ve organized these from what I see as most essential to least essential.\n\n16 hours of tutoring with a native speaker\n\n8 hours of Pimsleur Dari units\n\n15-30 hours of news in Dari via VOA Dari\n\n6 hours of practicing, writing (in our alphabet, not Dari’s), and internalizing what I’ve learned on italki and Pimsleur. Much of this is speaking aloud.\n\nsome casual research online, YouTube, and DFI’s Dari course. As curiosity strikes me.\n\n1 hour of Chai and Conversation podcast, mostly just because I like it\n\nThose are my monthly Dari goals! I’m about 15 weeks from my visit to Afghanistan (edit: it was cancelled 😭–so I adjusted my learning goals after month 3), so I’m taking it pretty intensely. With all these added up, I expect to get about 30 hours per month of active Dari practice and lots of passive practice, which I don’t keep very close track of. That’s about 450 hours of solid practice before I leave!\n\nMy Progress Reports\n\nI like documenting things, maybe that’s why I have a blog. So I’m laying out my progress below, for you and for me. If you want to learn Dari, I’d give at least five hours per week. Let’s see how I stack up compared to the goals I’ve listed above…\n\nMonth 1 Learning Dari\n\nTuesday April 23rd through May 22nd, 2024\n\nActive Practice: 16.5 hours italki (+30 minutes), 3 hours Pimselur (-5 hours), 7.75 hours practice & homework (+1 hour 45 minutes)\n\nPassive Practice: 70 minutes Chai and Conversation (+10 minutes), 3 hours VOA Dari newscast (-12 hours)\n\nTotals: 27 hours 15 minutes active learning (-2 hours 45 minutes) & 4 hours 10 minutes passive learning (-13 hours 50 minutes). That’s 56 minutes per day of active learning and 8 minutes 37 seconds per day of passive learning.\n\nHow did I do? Not bad! There’s room to increase my volume, for sure. Or perhaps I’ll aim a bit lower. For italki and self-study, I hot my goals of 16 hours and 6-8 hours. While I need to increase my passive listening, I didn’t add the VOA Dari newscast until May 13th, after I learned how important these passive listening tools can be. Pimsleur I’d like to double my output in the coming months, aiming for 5-8 hours. It’s one of my favorite tools, after all.\n\nNext month, I’ll be visiting St. John in the USVI. I’d like to think I’ll keep up my studies as intensely, but it’s likely it’ll lag a bit.\n\nMonth 2 Learning Dari\n\nTuesday May 23rd through June 22nd, 2024\n\nActive Practice: 4 hours italki (-12 hours), 3 hours 30 minutes Pimselur (-4 hours 30 minutes), 4 hours practice & homework (-2 hours)\n\nPassive Practice: 12 minutes Chai and Conversation (-48 minutes), 3 hours 50 minutes VOA Dari newscast (-11 hours 10 minutes)\n\nTotals: 11 hours 30 minutes active learning (-18 hours 30 minutes hours) & 4 hours 2 minutes passive learning. That’s 23 minutes per day of active learning and 8 minutes 3 seconds of passive learning.\n\nMy Afghan tutor and I both had week-long trips this month at separate times, so volume was super low on italki, which carried over into my other areas of study, too. He went to Bamyan and I visited St. John.\n\nI think the cancelled Afghanistan trip slowed me down a bit, too, but I still planning on learning Dari Persian. Afghanistan and its Persian-speaking silk road neighbors and regions are still on my travel bucket list, for sure. Even my wife wants to visit Iran!\n\nAnyway, took it pretty easy with language learning in general in this stretch, but I’ll be back on it for month three of learning Dari.\n\nMy biggest takeaway from month 2 is that I enjoy learning Dari and meeting with Ahmad. While I’m still figuring out the scheduling of language learning (and this is my first serious foray into learning a new language), I’m enjoying the process and think I’ll be a lifelong student of language.\n\nMonth 3 Learning Dari\n\nSunday June 23rd through Monday July 22nd, 2024\n\nActive Practice: 9 hours italki (-5 hours), 90 minutes Pimselur (-6 hours 30 minutes), 4 hours 5 minutes practice & homework (-1 hour 55 minutes)\n\nPassive Practice: 0 minutes Chai and Conversation (-60 minutes), 4 hours VOA Dari newscast (-11 hours)\n\nTotals: 14 hours 35 minutes active learning (-15 hours 25 minutes hours) & 4 hours passive learning. That’s 30 minutes per day of active learning and 8 minutes of passive learning.\n\nIn three months (90 days) I’ve spent 29 hours 30 minutes studying with a native Afghan tutor on italki, 8 hours learning on Pimselur, 15 hours 50 minutes practicing on my own. I’ve also listened to 10 hours 50 minutes of news in Dari and 82 minutes of Chai and Conversation.\n\nThat’s an average of 35 minutes per day practicing and 8 minutes per day listening, or 65.5 hours in total.\n\nI’ve learned that with work and travel, this is an appropriate pace for me to learn Dari, so I’m adjusting my goals to resemble these numbers more. I was a bit ambitious in the beginning!\n\nHere are my new monthly goals for learning Dari…\n\n10 hours per month on italki\n\n5 hours per month with Pimsleur (I definitely could’ve done more Pimsleur in the last 3 months)\n\n6 hours per month practicing on my own\n\n6 hours per month listening to VOA Dari\n\nAfter 3 months of learning, these numbers make a lot more sense. According to this guide, it takes about 1,000 hours to feel comfortable in conversation with a native speaker. So after 3 months, I’m about 6.5% of the way to conversing in Dari!\n\nAsk a Question About Dari Persian\n\nLearning a new, strange language like Dari is a lot of fun, and you’ll find lots of phrases and ideas that don’t translate perfectly to English. Or maybe you’re just using Pimsleur to learn Dari and want to expand your vocabulary. Cool! Ask me a question below (in the comments) and if I don’t know it, I’ll shoot my friend Ahmad from Afghanistan a message and find out."
