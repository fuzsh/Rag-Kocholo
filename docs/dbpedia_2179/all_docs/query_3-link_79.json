        "text": "Negramaro is an Italian band formed in 1999 in Lecce, in the Apulia region, in Southern Italy. The band, composed of six members, chose the name “Negramaro” to underline the connection to their native land: the stunning Salento, a specific zone of the Apulia region.\n\nThe name comes from the Negroamaro wine produced in the Salento region of Puglia, Italy. This choice reflects their connection to their roots and culture. Negramaro gained popularity in Italy with their distinctive sound and heartfelt lyrics, often inspired by personal experiences and social issues.\n\nOne of Negramaro's most popular songs is “Estate“, which translates to “Summer” in English. Released in 2005, “Estate” is a nostalgic and melodic track that captures the essence of summer with its evocative lyrics and captivating rhythm. The song resonated with audiences for its emotional depth and relatable themes.\n\nThe song tells about the feeling of nostalgia that comes with summer, especially when it ends and takes away all the wonderful memories and the carefree summer days. The music video once again represents the bond of the band to their homeland, as it was filmed in Porto Cesareo, in the province of Lecce. A paradise place that, if you don't know, we recommend you to discover!\n\nListen to the song and let yourself be carried away by the singer's unmistakable voice! And then keep reading… we have a special linguistic tip to share with you!\n\nSo… how did you like this song? We hope you loved it as much as we do!\n\nFor all the language enthusiasts among you, we take this opportunity to show you a very cool Italian expression used in this song!\n\nIn the first verse, the lyrics go:”E resto qui sul filo di un rasoio“.\n\nWhich roughly translated to: “And I'm staying here on a razor's edge“.\n\nBut what does it mean? In Italian, “essere sul filo di un rasoio” describes a situation where someone is in a very delicate or risky position, constantly tense in order to avoid falling down! It's very similar to the English expression “to walk on eggshells“.\n\nAnd you… where would you rather (not) walk? On a razor's edge, or on eggshells?"
