        "text": "The phonology of Afghan Persian\n\nIt must be pointed out that, in reality, we can hardly speak of ‘one’ Afghan Persian. Although the linguistic and ethnic diversity of Afghanistan is as great as, if not more than, that of Iran, the standardisation of spoken Persian in Afghanistan is less than that in Iran. This is partly due to the decades of political unrest in Afghanistan, partly due to the lack of a centralised political and cultural space in the country, and partly due to the interethnic power dynamics in the relatively young nation-state.\n\nPreservation of the long ē and ō of Classical Persian\n\nIn this respect, Afghan Persian is identical with Central Asian Persian (Tajik). This is to say that, in Afghan Persian, for example, there is also a difference between شیر meaning ‘milk’ and شیر meaning ‘lion’, the former pronounced as shīr and the latter as shēr, and the word for ‘day’, روز, is pronounced as rōz rather than rūz, and آرزو ‘wish’ as ār(e)zō rather than ārezū. The progressive aspect prefix می is pronounced as mē or even mey; the first person plural ending ایم and second person plural ending اید (colloquially این) are pronounced as ēm and ēd (colloquially ēn) respectively. Unfortunately, there is no way to tell when a ی is pronounced as ē instead of ī and when a و is pronounced as ō rather than ū, unless one has been extensively exposed to Afghan Persian, or has substantial knowledge of Persian historical linguistics, or knowledge of other Iranian languages or Urdu or Turkic languages heavily influenced by Classical Persian. The best thing to do for learners interested in Afghan Persian is to watch out for these characteristics and commit them to memory. Many Afghans, however, under the influence of Iranian Persian, may consciously or subconsciously pronounce ē as ī and ō as ūin some daily high-frequency or formal/literary words.\n\nPreservation of the diphthongs aw, ay of Classical Persian\n\nLike Tajik Persian, the classical aw and ay have stayed in the phonology, whilst they have largely become ow and ey in Iranian Persian. Thus, نو ‘new’ is pronounced as naw, and نی ‘flute’ as nay. In Arabic loanwords, this means the preservation of the original Arabic pronunciation: موضوع is therefore mawzū (or even mawzō, with the و reinterpreted as the Persian long ō) instead of mowzū, and حیوان is haywān rather than heyvān. Again, this is not a hard and fast rule, as some speakers may pronounce the diphthongs in the Iranian way. The word برو, ‘Go!’, however, is not the expected birawas it would have been based on historical phonology, but boro like in Iranian.\n\nPreservation of the short a of Classical Persian\n\nThat is, in certain contexts where the short a has become a short e in Iranian Persian (perhaps under Turkic influence), the most prominent examples being the two verbs رسیدن ‘to arrive, to reach’, pronounced as rasīdan (Ir. resīdan) and کشیدن ‘to pull, to drag’, pronounced as kashīdan (Ir. keshīdan). The numeral یک ‘one’ is pronounced as yak (Ir. yek). The present stem of the verb نوشتن ‘to write’, نویس, is pronounced as nawēs in Afghan Persian rather than neves – here, the Iranian pronunciation is closer to Middle Persian, where the vowel after n was a short i.\n\nThe overwhelming presence of w\n\nIn Afghan Persian, the letter و as a consonant is overwhelmingly pronounced as w (as in the w in English, not in German and Polish etc.) rather than v in all positions in a word. If you have read my introduction to Tajik Persian, you may recall that this sound in Tajik is almost always pronounced as v, like in Iranian Persian, at the start of a word, and tends to be realised either as a v or as a w in the middle of the word depending on the speaker. In Afghan Persian, however, we have a nearly across-the-board realisation of و as w, except perhaps in Herat, where many speakers say v, due to the city’s proximity to Iran. Thus, we have و wa ‘and’, پیوند paywand ‘connection’, پروانه parwāna ‘moth’, گاو gāw ‘cow’, etc.\n\nThe word for ‘water’, آب, is consistently pronounced in colloquial Afghan Persian as āw.\n\nDeletion of h\n\nThe sound h is routinely omitted in Afghan pronunciation, and this is more clearly felt when h is at the start of the word. Therefore, هفت ‘seven’ becomes aft, هشت ‘eight’ becomes asht.\n\nThe deletion of h in speech can also mean that many speakers do not ‘realise’ that there is an h in the first place, thus resulting in pronunciations such as mēkhāyom for میخواهم ‘I want’ (Ir. mīkhāham or mīkhām for short). I will explain the ending –om later.\n\nDeletion of word-final n\n\nThis only occurs in some words, namely من ‘I’, which becomes ma, and همین ‘this very’, which becomes amī (remember that the initial h is also omitted). این ‘this’, as you may have guessed, is pronounced as ī. The second person singular imperative of the verb کردن in colloquial Afghan Persian is کو ko, rather than کن kon, without the final n.\n\nThe treatment of the object marker را\n\nIn colloquial Afghan Persian, the object marker را rā is shortened to ره ra after a vowel and reduced to a short a after a consonant (compare with the Iranian situation where it becomes رو ro after a vowel and و o after a consonant). Therefore, مرا دیدی ‘you saw me’ is pronounced مره دیدی mara dīdī (compare with the colloquial Iranian منو دیدی mano dīdī), تورا دیدم ‘I saw you’ is تره دیدم tura dīdom (compare with the colloquial Iranian تورو دیدم toro dīdam), and من سیب را خوردم ‘I ate the apple’ is مه سیبه خوردم ma sēba khōrdom (compare with the colloquial Iranian من سیبو خوردم man sībo khordam).\n\n‘Here’, ‘there’\n\nIn colloquial Afghan Persian, اینجا ‘here’ is pronounced as اینجه īnja, which a short a in the end rather than a long ā, and the stress is on ī rather than a. The Iranian pronunciation, both formal and colloquial, places the stress on the unchanged ā. Similarly, the Afghan pronunciation for the colloquial اونجا ‘there’ is اونجه ūnja, with the stress on ū and the a cut short.\n\nThe negative stem, نیست, is pronounced as nēst in the majority of Afghan dialects.\n\nThe shortened form of the third person singular present, in particular, is not e like in Iranian Persian, but as: او دوستم است‘he is my friend’ in colloquial Afghan Persian is او دوستم اس ū dōstam as, whereas it is او(ن) دوستمه ū(n) dūstame in colloquial Iranian Persian (or perhaps more idiomatically in Iranian, او(ن) رفیقمه ū(n) rafighame, with the Arabic word رفیق). The contraction of است to –s after a vowel occurs in both colloquial Afghan and colloquial Iranian Persian: او در خانه است ‘he is at home’ becomes او ده خانه‌س ū da khānas in Afghan and او(ن) تو خونه‌س ū(n) tū khūnas in Iranian.\n\nThose familiar with Tehrani Persian know that in colloquial Tehrani Persian, the third person singular present for هستن/بودن‘to exist, to be’, i.e. هست hast, often has a little element esh attached to it, resulting in هستش hastesh. The exactly meaning and grammatical function of this merits an entire volume, and I shall not delve into that in this post. The equivalent of this in colloquial Afghan Persian is استه asta, i.e. ast (or hast with the initial h dropped) plus an extra element a. I have also heard one Afghan friend consistently pronouncing this as استگ astag, which is of great linguistic interest, as –ag is the full Middle Persian form of the suffix –a; but just how widespread astag is (it is not, in my experience, and I would like to hear another person who also uses astag instead of asta) awaits further investigation.\n\nLogically, the Iranian نیستش nīstesh is the Afghan نیسته nēsta.\n\nThe historical و after خ\n\nIn some varieties of Afghan Persian, thew sound after kh in certain words, which was historically pronounced, has been preserved. Thus, خوار ‘abject, lowly’ is pronounced as khwār. The word for ‘sister’, خواهر, can be pronounced as khwāhar by some speakers, although this is rare; the more common pronunciation of خواهر is khār, identical with the Iranian pronunciation with the exception of the dropped h and subsequently the merging of ā and a. Some speakers will even pronounce خواستن ‘to want’ as khwāstan, although this is also uncommon. خویش, the formal, literary word for ‘self’, however, is pronounced as khēsh, without the historical w, and it also seems that few people pronounce خواندن ‘to read’ as khwāndan and virtually no one says dastarkhwān for دسترخوان ‘tablecloth’. Nevertheless, Afghan Persian remains the only living variety of Persian to have retained the pronunciation of the historical w after kh, even if it is only in some instances.\n\nThe first person singular ending –om\n\nAnother prominent feature of Afghan Persian is the consistent pronunciation of the first person singular ending as –om, in contrast with the Iranian –am. We have seen a few examples of this above. Thus: رفتم is raftom, دیدم ‘I saw’ is dīdom, میرم ‘I go (colloquial)’ is mērom, میشوم ‘I become’ is mēshawom, میکنم ‘I do’ is mēkonom, etc.\n\nNo palatalisation of k and g before e and a\n\nThose familiar with Iranian Persian must have noticed that when Iranians pronounce the sounds k and g before e, and a, they say them as if there was a little y sound attached to it: kyardan ‘to do’, kyerm ‘worm’, agyar ‘if’, gyerd ‘circle’, etc. This is further exaggerated in Azerbaijan, where کردن sounds almost like چردن. In linguistics, this is called ‘palatalisation’ – the tongue is too close to the upper palate when pronouncing ک and گ, therefore producing a ی like quality or even making the ک sound like چ and گ sound like ج.\n\nThe short e and o\n\nThe short e and o in Iranian Persian evolved from the short i and u of Classical Persian respectively (I have mentioned this in my post about Tajik Persian). Whereas in Iranian Persian they are consistently pronounced as e and o, in Afghan Persian their realisation fluctuates and shows a great variety of inconsistencies. Some speakers will say e and o in some words but the historical i and u in others, and it is difficult to pinpoint when exactly to expect the historical pronunciation. The general observation, however, is that the Afghan short e and o are ‘more like’ their historical forms, i.e. the e is pronounced more like an i and o more like an u, both ‘narrower’ than their Iranian equivalents.\n\nThe ā does not become ū\n\nSimilar to Tajik Persian, the Iranian (or more precisely, Tehrani) phenomenon of the long ā becoming the long ū before a nasal (n and m) does not exist in Afghan Persian. Thus, مهمان ‘guest’ is always mehmān (never mehmūn), نان ‘bread’ is always nān (never nūn), آسمان ‘sky, heaven’ is always ās(e)mān (never āsemūn). The shortened version of میتوانم ‘I can’ is mētānom in Afghan Persian (never mītūnam); similarly, میخوانم ‘I read’ is mēkhānom (never mīkhūnam). خانه‌مان ‘our house’ is khānamān (never khūnemūn), and میدانم ‘I know’ is mēdānom (never mīdūnam; in fact, for ‘I know’, the more idiomatic Afghan expression is میفهمم mēfāmom, of which the phonology is mentioned in point 6).\n\nTo conclude this week’s post, I would like to invite you to train your ears by listening to a TV interview with a famous Afghan filmmaker, صحرا کریمی Sahraa Karimi, on the Afghan TV programme قاب گفتگو Qāb-e Goftogō. Karimi grew up in Iran and her Persian pronunciation is rather mixed. Note how she sounds more Afghan when talking about informal topics but more Iranian when speaking on more formal subjects. Also pay attention to the differences between her accent and the hosts’ accents. Try to identify the points addressed in this post:"
