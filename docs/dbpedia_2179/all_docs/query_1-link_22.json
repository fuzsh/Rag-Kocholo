        "text": "The pagan folk band Daridel takes you on a journey through the centuries of darkness and light of pagan Europe. Ancient instruments and tribal music intertwine with medieval sounds and sweet melodies.\n\nDifferent instruments come together to create new sounds. Flutes and harps sing the song of fairies and elves. Aggressive bagpipes play alongside the haunting hurdy-gurdy. Huge drums make the spirits dance. Bones rattle, wood rasps and horns bellow in a frenzy of natural sounds. A journey through mysterious, forgotten sounds and ancient instruments. A journey through the centuries of darkness and light of a pagan Europe. It is a never-ending cycle of death and rebirth, of sweet melodies and aggressive hymns that come together in a macabre song of life.\n\nThe band from Northern Italy formed at the end of 2018 and was brought together by their passion for folk music and the traditions of ancient Europe. Theyâ€™ve played more than 300 shows between Italy, Europe, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates."
