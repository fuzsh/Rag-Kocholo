        "text": "His arms spin in all directions, his buzz cut bobs along and his voice galvanizes everything: Gianfranco Bruno is Italy's most enthusiastic warm-up artist. Three years ago, he reached his professional holy grail, watching over the clap-o-meter of the song festival that takes place every winter at Sanremo, a seaside resort on the Ligurian coast. Since it began in 1951, the competition – broadcast by RAI, the heavyweight of Italy's audiovisual world – has attracted huge audiences. Unlike at other music events, here, the artists only perform previously unreleased compositions. In other words, Bruno plays a crucial role. He is the first one to feel the crowd's excitement, to direct the buzz and channel their favor.\n\nWhen he took over in 2021, the atmosphere-maker didn't have to try hard when an Italian rock band called Måneskin – which means \"moonlight\" in Danish – burst onto the stage. \"The audience's enthusiasm was immediate, among the young people of course, but also among the older ones,\" said the 34-year-old from Naples. \"You could feel that they were set to go far – when they came in first place, it didn't surprise anyone.\"\n\nSince that triumph, Bruno has seen the quartet – who sing in both English and Italian – return to the next two editions of Sanremo with growing magnetism. On February 1, 2022, the group received a standing ovation, basking in the glory of its victory nine months earlier at Eurovision. It was the same story on February 9, 2023, when the artists performed a medley of their greatest hits, mostly from their third album Rush!, which topped the international sales charts the week of its release in late January.\n\nIn just two years, Måneskin has gone global. Their 2021 cover of \"Beggin',\" popularized in 1967 by the American band The Four Seasons, was a hit on TikTok, the teen social media app of choice. Across all platforms, their songs have now racked up 6.5 billion streams. It's an impressive figure for a group whose first album was released in 2018. The 2023 tour, which has already sold out, will pass through the biggest European venues. Promotion work for the new album has taken place almost exclusively from Rome, where the quartet grew up before meeting in high school. Filtering communication as much as possible, the band did not give a single interview in Sanremo.\n\nUndeniably efficiency\n\nTo talk to them, you have to make do with a Zoom call. Dressed in very chic 1970s ochre-colored suits and sitting on a large sofa, the young artists offered answers and polite smiles. On the screen were Damiano David, the singer with the hoarse voice and crowd pleaser on social media; Thomas Raggi, the guitarist; Victoria De Angelis, the Italian-Danish bassist, who gave the group its name; and Ethan Torchio, the drummer."
