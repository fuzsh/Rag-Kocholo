        "text": "Alla Boara celebrates the deep history of human music-making by cultivating fresh sounds from the ancient roots of regional Italian folk songs. Amanda Powell’s impassioned vocals burst with the drama and humor of Italian life propelled by drummer and ensemble founder Anthony Taddeo. The storytelling behind this daring ensemble is intoxicating and has the dazzling soloing of a veteran jazz ensemble to Taddeo’s imaginative re-composition of these ancient songs, many of which have disappeared in a tide of modernity. Becca Stevens, GRAMMY-nominated singer/songwriter praised Alla Boara for \"breathing new possibilities into timeless stories while weaving in limitless and unexpected musical flavors, and the ensemble’s debut recording “Le Tre Sorelle” was praised by Cleveland Magazine for its “top-notch musicianship.” The band has received critical acclaim from NPR’s “Shuffle,” SWR2 in Germany, All About Jazz, Jazz Weekly, and Cleveland Magazine. From the specific dialects, stories and songs of Italy’s pre-industrial past spring Alla Boara’s dynamic and touching performances that inspire listeners of any heritage to treasure their ancestral roots and to revel in our shared humanity, which is as surprising, playful, mournful and tender as the songs themselves.\n\nOur New Music Videos\n\nHere are the first two singles from our new album “Work & Song”! This album was recorded in front of a live audience at the prestigious Bop Stop in Cleveland, OH. The full album drops everywhere on Jan. 26th!\n\nYou can also stream the new singles on any of these streaming services!"
