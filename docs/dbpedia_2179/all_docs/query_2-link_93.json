        "text": "Yes, he is a manager (probably of a place), but what does Sahib mean?\n\nAs @sound shift has said, it is a polite form to address a male (in Urdu) and is equivalent to Mr. You will know its origins are in Arabic.\n\nI am not sure if it is used in the same sense as in Urdu.\n\nI believe you are right, nevertheless I thought it worth pointing out particularly as in the transliteration you cannot tell which s and which h you have and the fact that it isn't used in quite the same sense might make one suspicious that the fact it sounds like صاحب is a coincidence\n\nIt depends upon the language. Persophones would better be able to explain to you the extent to which مدیر I.e. mudeer is used in Persian but in Turkish the usage of müdür is quite expansive extending from a principal to a manager or a Director. In Arabic the usage is also quite varied and can be used for any bigshot akin to how in english we use the term boss or in Spanish Jefe. In Urdu however, from experience I've only ever heard the term be used for editors. I may be wrong but such has been my personal experience. The female equivalent would be Mudeerah.\n\nAs for SaaHib I have not yet heard it be used in Persian in the manner that you have indicated above. Are you certain that the book isn't just the work of an orientalist who likes missing terminology as many of them do?\n\nI am not sure if it is used in Persian in the same sense as in Urdu.\n\nThanks a lot. Since the text is about an incident that took place in Afghanistan, I found that in Pashto, Sahib means Mr. and Mudeer means director, so it is Mr. Director. I hope that if there is anyone here who knows Pashto to confirm this meaning to me.\n\nThanks a lot. Since the text is about an incident that took place in Afghanistan, I found that in Pashto, Sahib means Mr. and Mudeer means director, so it is Mr. Director. I hope that if there is anyone here who knows Pashto to confirm this meaning to me.\n\nI would suggest to you that \"SaaHib\" would be used in Pashto in the same sense as it is used in Urdu."
