        "text": "Silvano Ancellotti, guitarist from the Italian Celtic Punk-Rock band, Uncle Bard & the Dirty Bastards, joins Douglas McLean in this rip roaring edition of Backstage on the Sound Café Magazine.\n\nYou can listen to the entire interview and musicHERE\n\nThe band is proud and excited to have released its new album, The Story So Far, worldwide on Angel Air Records.\n\nThe band is a brand-new signing to Angel Air Records, which plans to give the them a huge global push. The Story So Far is a compilation album of the band’s most popular songs, which are culled from their previous four critically acclaimed albums including The Cellar Tapes, Get the Folk Out!, Handmade! and The Men Behind the Glass, all of which have been released independently by the band. The album also includes one new, previously unreleased track entitled Molly Maguire's\n\nSimply put, the album rocks like mad in the finest of the Celtic Punk-Rock tradition. In the same vein as bands like The Pogues, Flogging Molly and Dropkick Murphys, to name a few, the band’s musical stew is a hot blend of original music that combines rock, punk, folk, and traditional Irish music.\n\nThe current lineup features Lorenzo Testa on banjo/mandolin, Silvano Ancellotti on lead guitar, Roberto Orlando on bass, Luca Telizzi on drums, Guido Domingo on lead vocals and Luca Crespi on tin whistle, Irish flute, and Uilleann Pipes.\n\nYes, the band members are all Italian, but, their love for Ireland and its Celtic music is real. They’ve spent a lot of time in the Emerald Isle over the years, soaking up the Irish culture and Irish music scene (along with a few pints of Guinness), honing their Celtic music style to a tee. Their respect and knowledge of Irish society, culture and its music is real…so much so that Ireland has adopted them as native music sons.\n\nThe band’s live shows are joyous, exhilarating, memorable experiences, where their energy and passion for their music is unending and their connection to their audience is palpable and, of course, where the Guinness never ceases to flow.\n\nThey were the first Italian band to perform at the Dublin Irish Festival in Dublin, Ohio, USA, which is the most important Irish music festival in the U.S., and they have toured countless times throughout the U.K. and Europe since forming in 2007.\n\nFEATURED SONGS:\n\nBlack Sheep\n\nThe Flat Above My Pub\n\nWish\n\nAnger\n\nYou can listen to the entire interview and musicHERE\n\nWebsite: www.ubdirtybastards.com\n\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/UBDirtyBastards"
