        "text": "Italian Progressive Rock\n\n7 Italian Bands Born In The Mystical 1970-1980 Era\n\nToday I'm going to wear my born-and-raised-in-Italy hat because I want to tell you about a magical period that happened here in my country.\n\nYou should know that in the seventies the God of Music threw a spell on Italy that inspired many musicians to give birth to a bunch of awesome bands.\n\nSadly nowadays the musical scene is dominated by trappers and other unskilled individuals, but I digress... let's get back to 1970\n\nIt is commonly believed that the origins of progressive rock can be traced back to England with the release of King Crimson's In the Court of the Crimson King album in 1969.\n\nItaly was swept up in the so-called \"British invasion\", and many local bands adopted the musical stylings of British symphonic rock, such as long and structured songs, concept albums, and complex rhythms and chords.\n\nBut why did these English bands achieve immense popularity in Italy, despite their obscurity in their home country?\n\nSome have suggested that the Italian public was drawn to progressive rock because of their cultural heritage of great works of art, such as melodrama and Antonio Vivaldi's baroque compositions.\n\nIt is as if the Italian public of the early 70s was familiar with romantic melodies, classical music influences, and symphonic pieces of prog rock.\n\nThe main influences of Italian progressive rock include bands such as Genesis, King Crimson, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, The Nice, Gentle Giant, Yes, Van der Graaf Generator, Jethro Tull, Quatermass, Colosseum, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Soft Machine, Gong, and Caravan.\n\nAnyway, the Italian band we're going to discover introduced in their songs unique nuances typical of Italian Progressive rock.\n\nSo here are some of the best Italian progressive rock bands!\n\n1) New Trolls\n\nThe New Trolls was an Italian progressive rock band active since 1966.\n\nThe band played an important role in the Italian music scene of the 70s, combining elements of rock, classical and folk music to create a unique and distinctive sound.\n\nThe New Trolls were also among the first bands in Italy to perform live concerts with a symphony orchestra.\n\nTheir most famous album is \"Concerto grosso per i New Trolls\" from 1972.\n\nRecommended album\n\nConcerto Grosso per i New Trolls\n\n2) Area\n\nThe band Area was one of the main representatives of the Italian progressive scene of the 70s and 80s, with a sound that combined elements of rock, jazz, electronica and world music.\n\nThe band has had a strong influence on the Italian music scene and has collaborated with many important artists.\n\nTheir singer, Demetrio Stratos, in his research, explored the human voice as a musical instrument.\n\nStratos was known for his skill in percussive vocal technique and for his ability to produce extremely high and deep sounds.\n\nRecommended album:\n\nArbeit macht frei\n\n3) Premiata Forneria Marconi\n\nPremiata Forneria Marconi, also known as PFM was one of the first to be recognized as one of the main representatives of Italian progressive rock and had great success both in Italy and abroad.\n\nPFM combined elements of rock, classical and folk music to create a unique and distinctive sound, and their debut album,\"Storia di un minuto\", is considered a classic of the genre.\n\nThe band is still active and continues to perform live and release new albums.\n\nPFM has been influential not only in Italy, but also internationally, inspiring many progressive bands and making the history of Italian progressive rock.\n\nRecommended album:\n\nPer un amico\n\n4) Quella Vecchia Locanda\n\nThe band Quella Vecchia Locanda has been known for its skill in using traditional instruments such as flute and violin alongside rock instruments such as guitar and bass.\n\nQuella Vecchia Locanda was one of the few Italian progressive bands to explore the theme of mythology and spirituality in their music.\n\nMany of their songs are inspired by Greek and Norse mythological figures, and some of their lyrics address philosophical and spiritual themes.\n\nThe band also incorporated elements of Italian folk music and other musical traditions into many of their songs, creating a distinctive and unique sound\n\nRecommended album:\n\nIl tempo della gioia\n\n5) Le Orme\n\nLe Orme are one of the most important Italian progressive bands, founded in Venice in 1966.\n\nTheir unique sound combines elements of rock, jazz, classical and folk, creating a blend of distinctive and innovative sounds.\n\nTheir first album, \"Ad Gloriam\", in 1969, established their reputation as one of the most important progressive bands in Italy.\n\nFurthermore, the band has also collaborated with other prominent artists in the Italian music scene, such as singer-songwriter Lucio Battisti.\n\nTheir influence continues to be felt around the world and they are considered one of the most important bands on the Italian music scene.\n\nRecommended album:\n\nFelona e Sorona\n\n6) Biglietto per l’Inferno\n\nBiglietto per l'Inferno was a cult band, not so famous because they never reached commercial success.\n\nTheir singer, Claudio Canali, eventually become a Benedictine monk, after a brief period as a Hare Krishna.\n\nThe lyrics of Biglietto per L'Inferno songs were all about the relationship between religion and society, with a hint against sanctimonious moralism.\n\nRecommended album:\n\nBiglietto per l'inferno\n\n7) Locanda delle Fate\n\nThis is probably my favorite progressive band. The original lineup of Locanda delle Fate recorded one only album, \"Forse le lucciole non si amano più\".\n\nDespite being one of the most accomplished examples of romantic progressive made in Italy, that album was not commercially successful.\n\nAnd this is a shame, because, as you will hear, this album is an excellent blend of musical finesse and dreamy lyrics.\n\nRecommended album:\n\nForse le lucciole non si amano più\n\nItalian Progressive Rock: Conclusions\n\nOf course, the bands listed here are just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nIn that golden age, creativity and fantasy were at their best, and a plethora of groups composed really great music.\n\nThen, at the end of the seventies, other genres such as disc music, punk, and songwriters took the scene, and progressive rock went back into the background as a niche phenomenon, as it still is today.\n\nBut for music lovers, especially guitar players, this expression of Italian rock art is a real goldmine!"
