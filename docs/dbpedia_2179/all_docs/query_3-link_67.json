        "text": "There are three types of certificates: Instructional, Educational Services and Administrative.\n\nInstructional certificates allow the holder to be a classroom teacher.\n\nCareer and Technical Education (CTE) certificates allow the holder to teach approved career and technical education programs in grades nine through 12 in all public schools.\n\nEducational Services certificates allow the holder to provide educational support such as counseling, speech language pathology and school nursing services.\n\nAdministrative certificates allow the holder to provide supervisory and managerial services in the school district such as those provided by the building principal or school administrator.\n\nUnder each type of certificate, there are endorsements. The endorsement identifies the specific type of service that the holder is allowed to provide. A candidate who holds an instructional certificate with an endorsement to teach mathematics is allowed to teach mathematics alone. If the candidate also holds an instructional certificate with an endorsement to teach biological science, the candidate is allowed to teach both mathematics and biological science.\n\nApply for certification on the New Jersey educator certification system (NJEdCert), which has replaced the Teacher Certification Information System (TCIS)."
