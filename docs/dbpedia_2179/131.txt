Facts about Dari[edit | edit source]

Dari, is a political term used for the various dialects of the Persian language spoken in Afghanistan. Dari is the term officially recognised and promoted since 1964 by the Afghan government for the Persian language, hence it is known as Afghan Persian or Eastern Persian in many Western sources. Persian in Afghanistan is generally called Fārsi (فارسی) by Persian-speakers and Pārsi (پارسی) by ethnic Pashtuns.
