Dari is a member of the Raven Clan. He is Thull's and Luta's son, and Oslak is his uncle. In Spirit Walker, Dari plays with a pine-cone auroch that his uncle made for him in the river when Oslak, driven mad with sickness, coaxes Dari towards the dangerous rapids. In Outcast, Thull pulls Dari away from Torak.
