His achievements at IBM were no less significant and enduring than those in external standards and professional societies. This paper will highlight some of the accomplishments and activities of Bill Lang as an IBM noise control engineer, the creator of the IBM Acoustics Lab in Poughkeepsie, the founder of the global Acoustics program at IBM, and his many other IBM leadership roles. Bill was also a long-serving IBM manager, with the full set of personnel issues to deal with, so his people-management skills were often called into play. Bill ended his long and fruitful IBM career at a high point. In 1988, he took an original idea of his to the top of IBM executive management, which led directly to the formation of the IBM Academy of Technology, today the preeminent body of IBM top technical leaders from around the world.\n\nSummary inside IBM's historic turnaround\n\nCERN Document Server\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis work offers a summary of the book \"WHO SAYS ELEPHANTS CAN'T DANCE? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround\" by Louis Gerstner.In nine years as the chairman and CEO of International Business Machine Corporation (IBM), Louis Gerstner brought about a dramatic change in the company's fortunes. When he took charge, IBM was on the verge of extinction as the victim of rapid changes in the computer industry.

Consequently, BCM professionals also face the challenge of re-evaluating traditional concepts and introducing new strategies and industry best practices. This paper points to why traditional BCM is no longer sufficient in terms of enabling businesses to survive in today's high-risk environment. It also looks into some of the misconceptions about BCM and other stumbling blocks to establishing effective BCM today. Most importantly, however, this paper provides tips based on the Business Continuity Institute's (BCI) Good Practices Guideline (GPG) and the latest international BCM standard ISO 22301 on how to overcome the issues and challenges presented.\n\nFlexible input, dazzling output with IBM i\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nVictÃ³ria-Pereira, Rafael\n\n2014-01-01\n\nLink your IBM i system to the modern business server world!

Pake Prize Lecture: Physical Sciences Research at IBM: Still at the Cutting Edge\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTheis, Thomas\n\n2015-03-01\n\nThe information technology revolution is in its ``build out'' phase. The foundational scientific insights and hardware inventions are now many decades old. The microelectronics industry is maturing. An increasing fraction of the total research investment is in software and services, as applications of information technology transform every business and every sector of the public and private economy. Yet IBM Research continues to make substantial investments in hardware technology and the underlying physical sciences. While some of this investment is aimed at extending the established transistor technology, an increasing fraction is aimed at longer-term and possibly disruptive research - new devices for computing, such as tunneling field-effect transistors and nanophotonic circuits, and new architectures, such as neurosynaptic systems and quantum computing. This research investment is a bet that the old foundations of information technology are ripe for reinvention. After all, today's information technology devices and systems operate far from any fundamental limits on speed and energy efficiency. But how can IBM make risky long-term research investments in an era of global competition, with financial markets focused on the short term? One important answer is partnerships. Since its early days, IBM Research has pursued innovation in information technology and innovation in the ways it conducts the business of research. By continuously evolving new models for research and development partnerships, it has extended its global reach, increased its impact on IBM's customers, and expanded the breadth and depth of its research project portfolio. Research in the physical sciences has often led the way. Currently on assignment to the Semiconductor Research Corporation.\n\nIBM announces global Grid computing solutions for banking, financial markets\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2003-01-01\n\n\"IBM has announced a series of Grid projects around the world as part of its Grid computing program.

There were 183 patients in the building at that time in this 367-bed Medical Center. The preparation and response were superbly done and resulted in many lives saved. This report is focused on the reconstitution phase of this disaster response, which includes how to restore business continuity. As 95 percent of our medical capacity resides in the private sector in the United States, we must have a proper plan for how to restore business continuity or face the reality of the medical business failing and not providing critical medical services to the community. A tornado in 2007 destroyed a medical center in Sumter County, GA, and it took more than 365 days to restore business continuity at a cost of $18M. The plan executed by the Mercy Medical System after the disaster in Joplin restored business continuity in 88 days and cost a total of $6.6M, with all assets being reusable. The recommendation from these lessons learned is that every county, state, and Federal Emergency Management Agency region has a plan on the shelf to restore business continuity and the means to be able to do so. The hard work that the State of Missouri and the Mercy Medical System did after this disaster can serve as a model for the nation in how to quickly recover from any loss of medical capability.\n\nBusiness continuity management in international organisations.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAdamou, Christel\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn the area of business continuity management, a preliminary review of the literature reveals extensive knowledge, expertise and experience concerning organisations in the private and public sectors. It is interesting to note, however, that there is little literature about business continuity management in international organisations, although these entities are complex and particularly prone to threats. This apparent absence of literature suggests that business continuity management has not yet hit the agenda of international organisations. In recent years, member states have encouraged senior management to design and implement business continuity strategies to minimise the mishandling of an internal crisis and build organisational resilience, but very few of them have actually been able to design and implement comprehensive business continuity programmes. Based on actual experience working in international organisations, this paper outlines some of the challenges faced by international organisations in developing and implementing business continuity activities and attempts to make suggestions for further improvement.\n\nTrends in development of innovative business models\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKrstiÄ Milan\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The companies doing business in global markets are now compelled to do it in conditions of permanent and turbulent changes.

It complements Actor Network...... Theory by Karl E. Weickâs sensemaking and studies innovation processes through narratives. This approach supplements the literatureâs institutional focus and provides more focus on the technologyâs use and limitations on innovations. In the mid-1940s, IBM was reluctant to engage in computer innovation......, because its sales organization and top-management saw little computer business. They subscribed to the established corporate innovation narrative of incremental improvements of the companyâs many single punched-card machines, which contrasted the challenges of the revolutionary shift to computers. However...\n\nFROM THE LEWIS AND CLARK EXPEDITION TO IBM, DELL, AND SOUTHWEST AIRLINES: TEACHING HISTORY AND LEADERSHIP TO BUSINESS STUDENTS\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJeffrey J.

Continuity programmes for large, complex international organisations, unlike those for compact national companies, are more difficult to design, build, implement and maintain. Programmes for international organisations require attention to structural design, support across organisational leadership and hierarchy, seamless integration with the organisation's culture, measured success and demonstrated value. This paper details practical, but sometimes overlooked considerations for building successful global business continuity programmes.\n\nIntegrating Closed-loop Supply Chains and Spare Parts Management at IBM\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nM.

In this study is shown how cognitive computing systems can be useful for NASA when computers are trained in the same way as humans are to gain knowledge over time. Increasing knowledge through senses, learning and a summation of events is how the applications created by the firm IBM empower the artificial intelligence in a cognitive computing system. NASA has explored and applied for the last decades the artificial intelligence approach specifically with cognitive computing in few projects adopting similar models proposed by IBM Watson. However, the usage of semantic technologies by the dedicated business unit developed by IBM leads these cognitive computing applications to outperform the functionality of the inner tools and present outstanding analysis to facilitate the decision making for managers and leads in a management information system.\n\nIBM 3705 Communications Controller\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n1972-01-01\n\nThe IBM 3705 Communications Controller is a simple computer which attaches to an IBM System/360 or System/370.

Business continuity is fast evolving to become a critical and strategic decision for any organisation. Transportation in general, and airlines in particular, is a unique sector with a specialised set of requirements, challenges and opportunities. Business continuity in the airline sector is a concept that is generally overlooked by the airline managements.

Despite this, there is almost no measurement of whether this expense offers value for money, or whether it is targeted in the right areas. This paper will explain some methods of measuring components of a business continuity programme. The important outputs from this measurement activity are to demonstrate that an organisation's continuity capability is improving over time, and to identify areas of weakness that should be targeted during future work.\n\nThe true value and return on investment of business continuity.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPhelps, Regina\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe phrase return on investment (ROI) is commonly heard when groups or organisations attempt to demonstrate the value of a particular activity. 'Is it good for us?', 'Is it worth the investment?' and 'Should we continue to fund the endeavour?' are all valid and important questions. The challenge for business continuity professionals is to address the question, 'What is the ROI of business continuity?' in ways that will be meaningful to the person wielding the budget stick. In the 'olden days', colleagues would point to their business impact analysis, with pie charts and bar graphs showing the cost of business downtime if an event occurred. They would sit back and say, 'See? We provide ROI because we addressed The Bad Thing!'. But is that really the best that continuity professionals can do? This paper peels back the question of ROI and addresses the value proposition of business continuity. The goal is to broaden the conversation, by instead of talking about how much money business continuity efforts will save the company, and instead to focus on the value that business continuity provides every day.\n\nResiliency scoring for business continuity plans.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nOlson, Anna; Anderson, Jamie\n\nThrough this paper readers will learn of a scoring methodology, referred to as resiliency scoring, which enables the evaluation of business continuity plans based upon analysis of their alignment with a predefined set of criteria that can be customised and are adaptable to the needs of any organisation. This patent pending tool has been successful in driving engagement and is a powerful resource to improve reporting capabilities, identify risks and gauge organisational resilience. The role of business continuity professionals is to aid their organisations in planning and preparedness activities aimed at mitigating the impacts of potential disruptions and ensuring critical business functions can continue in the event of unforeseen circumstances. This may seem like a daunting task for what can typically be a small team of individuals. For this reason, it is important to be able to leverage industry standards, documented best practices and effective tools to streamline and support your continuity programme. The resiliency scoring methodology developed and implemented at Target has proven to be a valuable tool in taking the organisation's continuity programme to the next level. This paper will detail how the tool was developed and provide guidance on how it can be customised to fit your organisation's unique needs.\n\nThe strategic skills of business continuity managers: putting business continuity management into corporate long-term planning.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWong, Wei Ning Zechariah\n\n2009-11-01\n\nDespite its rapid development in the last two decades, business continuity management (BCM) as a discipline and a profession is still regarded by many as an operational entity of management. Two main issues are discussed in this paper: the role of BCM in strategic management and the strategic skills of business continuity managers. These issues are crucial as they represent the role of BCM in high-level corporate management. The paper discusses the importance of BCM in the long-term planning of organisational success and the preservation of future competitiveness. Finally, salient points that underpin the importance of its role in sustaining organisational performance are addressed.\n\n27 CFR 478.60 - Certain continuances of business.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-04-01\n\n... 27 Alcohol, Tobacco Products and Firearms 3 2010-04-01 2010-04-01 false Certain continuances of business. 478.60 Section 478.60 Alcohol, Tobacco Products, and Firearms BUREAU OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO...

The PC came equipped with 16 kilobytes of memory, expandable to 256k. The PC came with one or two 160k floppy disk drives and an optional color monitor. The price tag started at $1,565, which would be nearly $4,000 (about â¬3,400) today.\n\nCreating meaningful business continuity management programme metrics.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nStrong, Brian\n\n2010-11-01\n\nThe popular axiom, 'what gets measured gets done', is often applied in the quality management and continuous improvement disciplines. This truism is also useful to business continuity practitioners as they continually strive to prove the value of their organisation's investment in a business continuity management (BCM) programme. BCM practitioners must also remain relevant to their organisations as executives focus on the bottom line and maintaining stakeholder confidence. It seems that executives always find a way, whether in a hallway or elevator, to ask BCM professionals about the company's level of readiness. When asked, they must be ready with an informed response. The establishment of a process to measure business continuity programme performance and organisational readiness has emerged as a key component of US Department of Homeland Security 'Voluntary Private Sector Preparedness (PS-Prep) Program' standards where the overarching goal is to improve private sector preparedness for disasters and emergencies. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: to introduce continuity professionals to best practices that should be considered when developing a BCM metrics programme as well as providing a case study of how a large health insurance company researched, developed and implemented a process to measure BCM programme performance and company readiness.\n\nLetter from Hong Kong: A Report on Chinese Food, Fake Apples, and IBM's Asian Strategy.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nImmel, A.

Overlooking or under planning for Business Continuity requires time, understanding and careful planning. Business Continuity Management is far more than producing a document and declaring business continuity success. What is the recipe for businesses to achieve continuity management success? Application Impact Analysis is a method for understanding the unique Business Attributes. This AIA Cycle involves a risk based approach to understanding the business priority and considering business aspects such as Financial, Operational, Service Structure, Contractual Legal, and Brand. The output of this analysis provides a construct for viewing data, evaluating impact, and delivering results, for an approved valuation of Recovery Time Objectives (RTO).\n\nEnhancing infrastructure resilience through business continuity planning.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFisher, Ronald; Norman, Michael; Klett, Mary\n\n2017-01-01\n\nCritical infrastructure is crucial to the functionality and wellbeing of the world around us. It is a complex network that works together to create an efficient society. The core components of critical infrastructure are dependent on one another to function at their full potential. Organisations face unprecedented environmental risks such as increased reliance on information technology and telecommunications, increased infrastructure interdependencies and globalisation. Successful organisations should integrate the components of cyber-physical and infrastructure interdependencies into a holistic risk framework. Physical security plans, cyber security plans and business continuity plans can help mitigate environmental risks. Cyber security plans are becoming the most crucial to have, yet are the least commonly found in organisations. As the reliance on cyber continues to grow, it is imperative that organisations update their business continuity and emergency preparedness activities to include this.\n\nDisaster Recovery Planning as part of Business Continuity Management\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nPinta, Jan\n\n2011-01-01\n\nNowadays, a well functioning ICT infrastructure belongs to the most critical factors of companies across all branches of business. An importance of ensuring the continued operation of information systems, or the rapid recovery of the systems in the case of emergency, has increased. These needs require creating business continuity management plan and disaster recovery planning.

This timeless classic was a hit. IBM came out with several varients of the model M. They had the space saver 104 key which is the one most seen today and many international versions of that as well. The second type, and rarest is the 122 key model M which has 24 extra keys at the very top, dubbed the âprogrammers keyboardâ. IBM manufactured these keyboards until 1991. The model M features âcapsâ over the actual keys that can be taken off separately one at a time for cleaning or to replace them with colored keys or keys of another language, that was a very cost effective way of shipping out internationally the keyboards.\n\nA Survey of Business Alumni: Evidence of the Continuing Need for Law Courses in Business Curricula\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTanner, John; Keaty, Anne; Major, Christopher\n\n2004-01-01\n\nFor decades, faculty in colleges of business who teach various legal courses to business students (hereinafter referred to as legal studies faculty) have been advocates of the need for such law courses in the curricula of their business students.

It was designed by an IBM team as an inexpensive way to load data into the IBM System / 370. Plus it was a read-only bare disk containing 80 KB of data. The first read-write version was introduced in 1972 by Memorex and could contain 175 KB on 50 tracks (with 8 sectors per track). Other improvements have led to various coatings and increased capacities. Finally, it was surpassed by the mini diskette of 5.25 inches introduced in 1976.\n\nBusiness continuity and pandemic preparedness: US health care versus non-health care agencies.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRebmann, Terri; Wang, Jing; Swick, Zachary; Reddick, David; delRosario, John Leon\n\n2013-04-01\n\nOnly limited data are available on US business continuity activities related to biologic events. A questionnaire was administered to human resource professionals during May-July 2011 to assess business continuity related to biologic events, incentives businesses are providing to maximize worker surge capacity, and seasonal influenza vaccination policy. Linear regressions were used to describe factors associated with higher business continuity and pandemic preparedness scores. The Ï(2) and Fisher exact tests compared health care versus non-health care businesses on preparedness indicators. Possible business continuity and pandemic preparedness scores ranged from 0.5 to 27 and 0 to 15, with average resulting scores among participants at 13.2 and 7.3, respectively. Determinants of business continuity and pandemic preparedness were (1) business size (larger businesses were more prepared), (2) type of business (health care more prepared), (3) having human resource professional as company disaster planning committee member, and (4) risk perception of a pandemic in the next year. Most businesses (63.3%, n = 298) encourage staff influenza vaccination; 2.1% (n = 10) mandate it. Only 10% of businesses (11.0%, n = 52) provide employee incentives, and fewer than half (41.0%, n = 193) stockpile personal protective equipment. Despite the recent H1N1 pandemic, many US businesses lack adequate pandemic plans. It is critical that businesses of all sizes and types become better prepared for a biologic event.

Lake Toba Area has potentials in providing chances for doing businesses. On the other hand, the growth of market size is rather slow and demographically still dominated by BoP. This is a case study which seeks to investigate to what extent the Inclusive Business Model (IBM) is adopted in the strategic planning and applied in the operational management of companies that operate in Lake Toba Area. The study was conducted in qualitative basis. The observation was conducted by gathering data and information through a series of interviews with the top management and desk study of the business plan in a tapioca starch industry in Toba Samosir Regency. The collected data and information were then analyzed qualitatively by comparing them with criteria and parameters of IBM suggested in a vast body of literature. The reference by which the IBM is referred in this study is a series of criteria which is synthesized from a literature review on a vast body of literature about IBM. From data analysis, it is evident that IBM has been incorporated in the strategic plan and applied in the operational activities of the object of this study. However, we also found some rooms for improvement such as expanding the involvement of BoP in their value chain as consumers, by which some innovation in the product diversification is required.\n\nConsiderations and benefits of implementing an online database tool for business continuity.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMackinnon, Susanne; Pinette, Jennifer\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIn today's challenging climate of ongoing fiscal restraints, limited resources and complex organisational structures there is an acute need to investigate opportunities to facilitate enhanced delivery of business continuity programmes while maintaining or increasing acceptable levels of service delivery. In 2013, Health Emergency Management British Columbia (HEMBC), responsible for emergency management and business continuity activities across British Columbia's health sector, transitioned its business continuity programme from a manual to automated process with the development of a customised online database, known as the Health Emergency Management Assessment Tool (HEMAT). Key benefits to date include a more efficient business continuity input process, immediate situational awareness for use in emergency response and/or advanced planning and streamlined analyses for generation of reports.\n\nIBM PC based real time photon correlator [Paper No.:D2\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKumaravadivelu, C.; Nageswaran, A.; Weling, S. A.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThe design aspects and development of IBM PC based real time photon correlator is presented. This system computes 64 auto-correlation functions in real time. Sample data is 4-bit wide. Correlation functions are computed in hard wired logic using discrete components. A combination of parallel and pipelined architecture is adopted to compute the correlation in realtime. A high speed controller generates the required control signals for the computing hardware and also provides handshake signals to IBM PC to access the computed results. IBM PC bus is extended and interfaced to correlation computing hardware. IBM PC collects the experimental parameters through user friendly menu and initiates the correlation hardware and continues to collect the correlation build ups and displays them on the screen. Extensive test and maintenance features are incorporated into the system. This system is developed for Material Science Division in Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR) to study static and dynamic properties of macro molecules and colloidal particles in dispersion using light scattering technique. It can also be used to study the flow characteristics of sodium in nuclear reactors. It can be used in dynamic neutron scattering experiments.

Bill created the facilities in Poughkeepsie, developed the local program, and was the leader in having other IBM locations with development and manufacturing responsibilities construct facilities and hire staff under the Interdivisional Liaison Program. He also directed IBMs acoustics technology program. In the mid-1960s, he led an IEEE standards group in Audio and Electroacoustics, and, with the help of James Cooley, Peter Welch, and others, introduced the fast Fourier transform to the acoustics community. He was the convenor of ISO TC 43 SC1 WG6 that began writing the 3740 series of standards in the 1970s. It was his suggestion to promote professionalism in noise control engineering, and, through meetings with Leo Beranek and others, led the founding of INCE/USA in 1971. He was also a leader of the team that founded International INCE in 1974, and he served as president from 1988 until 1999.\n\nBusiness Continuity Planning for Nursing Schools: Preparation for Potential Disasters.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZerwic, Julie J; Rosen, Denise\n\n2016-01-01\n\nNursing schools are vulnerable to disasters, ranging from pandemics to weather emergencies, fires, and acts of terrorism. To ensure minimal disruptions to teaching, provision of care, research, and other critical missions, nursing faculty and administrative leaders should develop a business continuity plan.

One of the results of this explosion is the need for newer and more efficient data analytics procedures. Traditionally, data analytics required a substantial background in statistics and computer science. In 2015, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) released the IBM Watson Analytics (IBMWA) software that delivered advanced statistical procedures based on the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). The latest entry of Watson Analytics into the field of analytical software products provides users with enhanced functions that are not available in many existing programs. For example, Watson Analytics automatically analyzes datasets, examines data quality, and determines the optimal statistical approach. Users can request exploratory, predictive, and visual analytics. Using natural language processing (NLP), users are able to submit additional questions for analyses in a quick response format. This analytical package is available free to academic institutions (faculty and students) that plan to use the tools for noncommercial purposes. To report the features of IBMWA and discuss how this software subjectively and objectively compares to other data mining programs. The salient features of the IBMWA program were examined and compared with other common analytical platforms, using validated health datasets. Using a validated dataset, IBMWA delivered similar predictions compared with several commercial and open source data mining software applications. The visual analytics generated by IBMWA were similar to results from programs such as Microsoft Excel and Tableau Software. In addition, assistance with data preprocessing and data exploration was an inherent component of the IBMWA application. Sensitivity and specificity were not included in the IBMWA predictive analytics results, nor were odds ratios, confidence intervals, or a confusion matrix\n\nIBM SPSS statistics 19 made simple\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nGray, Colin D\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis new edition of one of the most widely read textbooks in its field introduces the reader to data analysis with the most powerful and versatile statistical package on the market: IBM SPSS Statistics 19.

IBM2 distinguishes between two kinds of bosons. However, the IBM2 algebra does not include the operators TÂ± and consequently the states in the model have no good isospin, generally. IBM3 includes the isospin in the algebra and therefore the construction of states with any number of bosons and good isospin presents no problem. In this work, IBM3 is compared with the shell model. IBFM3 is also studied, which describes an odd nucleus as a system of N bosons plus a single nucleon that is a neutron with some probability and a proton with the complementary probability. The spectra obtained in the shell model, IBFM3 and IBFM2 for 45 Ti and 45 Sc are compared.

Previous attempts to implement a `traditional' form of BCP had been ineffective, but following the events, the firm began to look at BCP in a new light. This paper deals with three main themes: creating a culture of resiliency, leveraging technology, and building flexible plans. Distributing accountability for BCP to business line managers, integrating BCP change management into the normal course of business, and providing every employee with personalised BCP information breeds a culture of resiliency where people are empowered to react to events without burdensome, hierarchical response and recovery procedures. Building a strong relationship with one's application development community can result in novel, customised BCP solutions; existing systems and data structures can be used to enhance an existing BCP. Even the best plans are often challenged by events; understanding that flexibility is essential to effective incident response is a critical element in the development of a proper business continuity plan.\n\nLimitations and challenges towards an effective business continuity management in Nuklear Malaysia\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHamid, A. H. A.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nOne of Nuklear Malaysiaâs top concerns is radiological and nuclear safety as well as security preparedness of its operational facility management, which was bonded by Act 304, Directive 20 and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) guidelines. In 2012, the Malaysian government initialised the Business Continuity Management System under the supervision of Malaysian Administrative Modernization and Management Planning Unit (MAMPU), referring to MAMPU.BPICT.700-4/2/11 (3), ISO 22301:2012 and Business Continuity Good Practice Guidelines 2013 documentation. These standards are integral to the implementation of a resilient management program that indicates an organisationâs capability to prevent any accident from occurring and spreading its impact, which includes sufficient recovery action to post-accident situation towards a normal operational and managerial state. Unfortunately, there is a lack of certified Business Continuity Management standard among the public sector agencies compared to local private sectors. Subsequently, Nuklear Malaysia has been selected by MAMPU and CyberSecurity Malaysia as one of the pioneering agencies to be certified accordingly. This paper significantly recognized Nuklear Malaysiaâs effort to plan, analyse, design, implement, review and validate the establishment of this standard currently. The project was implemented using a case study approach to complete the required certification activities. As a result, this paper proposed benchmarking the selected literature reviews against the Nuklear Malaysia experience to determine best practices in implementing and managing Business Continuity effectively. It concluded that a resilient Business Continuity Management program needs to be incorporated into Nuclear Malaysiaâs capabilities in ensuring its mitigation capacities to survive any unexpected event and subsequently overcome future challenges.\n\nBank Solutions Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity: A Case Study for Business Students\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCamara, Steve; Crossler, Robert; Midha, Vishal; Wallace, Linda\n\n2011-01-01\n\nDisaster Recovery and Business Continuity (DR/BC) planning is an issue that students will likely come in contact with as they enter industry.

It also reviews the problems faced, how they were overcome and the lessons learned. When implementing a BCM programme in a large organisation, it is very important to follow the methodology described by BCM standard ISO 22301, otherwise the business continuity plan is unlikely to work efficiently or comply with the business recovery requirements, as well as with the requirements of other interested parties, such as customers, regulatory authorities, vendors, service providers, critical associates, etc.\n\nA queueing theory based model for business continuity in hospitals.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMiniati, R; Cecconi, G; Dori, F; Frosini, F; Iadanza, E; Biffi Gentili, G; Niccolini, F; Gusinu, R\n\n2013-01-01\n\nClinical activities can be seen as results of precise and defined events' succession where every single phase is characterized by a waiting time which includes working duration and possible delay. Technology makes part of this process. For a proper business continuity management, planning the minimum number of devices according to the working load only is not enough. A risk analysis on the whole process should be carried out in order to define which interventions and extra purchase have to be made. Markov models and reliability engineering approaches can be used for evaluating the possible interventions and to protect the whole system from technology failures. The following paper reports a case study on the application of the proposed integrated model, including risk analysis approach and queuing theory model, for defining the proper number of device which are essential to guarantee medical activity and comply the business continuity management requirements in hospitals.\n\nH1N1 pandemic preparedness and business continuity plan\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nNONE\n\n2009-10-15\n\nSaskPower's H1N1 pandemic preparedness and business continuity plan was designed to prepare SaskPower employees for elevated levels of absenteeism during a potential pandemic. Emergency management and business continuity will be facilitated if critical duties and essential services are maintained without interruption. A layered approach was used to develop a range of response measures designed to meet a range of possible pandemic threats. The plan identified essential activities, tasks and functions and outlined methods of mitigating supply disruptions and possible shortages. Methods of minimizing illness in employees were discussed, as well as methods of maintaining a safe and secure work environment. The measures were developed in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) 6 phases of pandemic alert. The plan was also designed to be read by SaskPower's key suppliers in order to ensure their pandemic readiness. 5 tabs.\n\nAPPLICATION OF BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM INTO THE CRISIS MANAGEMENT FIELD\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHana MALACHOVÃ\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Establishing business continuity management (BCM creates the basis of every organizationâs strategy. BCM includes complex procedures that help solving unexpected situations of natural and anthropogenic nature (e.g. fire or flood. Planning of the BCM is a process that helps organizations identify critical processes and implement plans for securing and restoring key processes. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the application of a systemic approach to BCM known as Business Continuity Management System (BCMS into the military field. This article describes the life cycle of the BCMS, which is based on PDCA cycle. Subsequently it is applied to the activities carried out by the University of Defence during activation of forces and means in the frame of the Integrated Rescue System (IRS in case of emergency â an accident in a nuclear power plant in the Czech Republic. Activities in various stages of deployment of allocated forces and means are managed and evaluated using the Military Continuity Management System (MCMS application.\n\nThe Conceptual Framework for Business Process Innovation\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nMÃ¸ller, Charles\n\nThis paper proposes a research program on Business Process Innovation: Towards Global Supply Chain Intelligence. Few words are more ubiquitous in business or society today than \"innovation\". This reflects that businesses are striving for ways to survive and thrive in an increasingly complex...... and connected world (IBM 2006). Most industrial supply chains today are globally scattered and nearly all organizations rely on their Enterprise Information Systems (ES) for integration and coordination of their activities. In this context innovation inevitably is driven by advanced information technology....... Organizations today are required not only to operate effective business processes but they also need to accommodate to changing business conditions at an increasing rate. Consequently the ability to develop and implement new processes driven by the Enterprise Information Systems is a central competence in most...\n\nOn IBM's Millennial Puzzle\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences (India)\n\nHome; Journals; Resonance â Journal of Science Education; Volume 5; Issue 10.

Occupational and environmental health (OEH) suffers from the absence of a level playing field on which science can thrive. Industry pays for a substantial portion of OEH research. Studies done by private consulting firms or academic institutions may be published if the results suit the sponsoring companies, or they may be censored. OEH journals often reflect the dominance of industry influence on research in the papers they publish, sometimes withdrawing or modifying papers in line with industry and advertising agendas. Although such practices are widely recognized, no fundamental change is supported by government and industry or by professional organizations.\n\nAnalysing the external supply chain risk driver competitiveness: a risk mitigation framework and business continuity plan.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBlos, Mauricio F; Wee, Hui-Ming; Yang, Joshua\n\n2010-11-01\n\nInnovation challenges for handling supply chain risks have become one of the most important drivers in business competitiveness and differentiation. This study analyses competitiveness at the external supply chain level as a driver of risks and provides a framework for mitigating these risks. The mitigation framework, also called the supply chain continuity framework, provides insight into six stages of the business continuity planning (BCP) process life cycle (risk mitigation management, business impact analysis, supply continuity strategy development, supply continuity plan development, supply continuity plan testing and supply continuity plan maintenance), together with the operational constructs: customer service, inventory management, flexibility, time to market, ordering cycle time and quality. The purpose of the BCP process life cycle and operational constructs working together is to emphasise the way in which a supply chain can deal with disruption risks and, consequently, bring competitive advantage. Future research will consider the new risk scenarios and analyse the consequences to promote the improvement of supply chain resilience.\n\nCollective states of even Xe isotopes in IBM+MQRPA\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEfimov A.

Knowledge sharing at a multinational business solutions corporation\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nC. Stafford\n\n2009-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Amid widespread resistance to online social networking tools, their effectiveness in promoting knowledge sharing in a knowledge-driven organisation was demonstrated in the study. Usage patterns, user attitudes and perceptions regarding online social networking technologies as a professional application for knowledge sharing within the workplace were investigated. Self-administered questionnaires were administered to a sample of IBM Global Business Services employees in South Africa. Upon completion of the questionnaire analysis an interview was conducted with the knowledge manager for verification and clarification purposes. The results revealed the respondents' positive attitudes regarding the use of social networking tools for knowledge sharing. The culture of knowledge sharing at IBM and the contribution that social networking tools makes within the company were uncovered. Findings disclosed that the online social networking tools were effective and that management at IBM encourages employees to make more and more use of the tools for knowledge sharing and knowledge creation. The results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of online social networking tools and serve as encouragement to hesitant organisations to adopt social networking in their business practices.\n\nA manager's guide to ISO22301 a practical guide to developing and implementing a business continuity management system\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nDrewitt, Tony\n\n2013-01-01\n\nA concise and practical guide to the ISO22301 benchmark for business continuity management.

Plate tectonics of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) arc using subducted slab constraints\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWu, J. E.; Suppe, J.; Renqi, L.; Kanda, R. V. S.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nPublished plate reconstructions typically show the Izu-Bonin Marianas arc (IBM) forming as a result of long-lived ~50 Ma Pacific subduction beneath the Philippine Sea. These reconstructions rely on the critical assumption that the Philippine Sea was continuously coupled to the Pacific during the lifetime of the IBM arc. Because of this assumption, significant (up to 1500 km) Pacific trench retreat is required to accommodate the 2000 km of Philippine Sea/IBM northward motion since the Eocene that is constrained by paleomagnetic data. In this study, we have mapped subducted slabs of mantle lithosphere from MITP08 global seismic tomography (Li et al., 2008) and restored them to a model Earth surface to constrain plate tectonic reconstructions. Here we present two subducted slab constraints that call into question current IBM arc reconstructions: 1) The northern and central Marianas slabs form a sub-vertical 'slab wall' down to maximum 1500 km depths in the lower mantle. This slab geometry is best explained by a near-stationary Marianas trench that has remained +/- 250 km E-W of its present-day position since ~45 Ma, and does not support any significant Pacific slab retreat. 2) A vanished ocean is revealed by an extensive swath of sub-horizontal slabs at 700 to 1000 km depths in the lower mantle below present-day Philippine Sea to Papua New Guinea. We call this vanished ocean the 'East Asian Sea'. When placed in an Eocene plate reconstruction, the East Asian Sea fits west of the reconstructed Marianas Pacific trench position and north of the Philippine Sea plate. This implies that the Philippine Sea and Pacific were not adjacent at IBM initiation, but were in fact separated by a lost ocean. Here we propose a new IBM arc reconstruction constrained by subducted slabs mapped under East Asia. At ~50 Ma, the present-day IBM arc initiated at equatorial latitudes from East Asian Sea subduction below the Philippine Sea. A separate arc was formed from Pacific subduction below\n\nIBM KELOMPOK USAHA SOUVENIR SABLON DIGITAL\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaria krisnawati\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Kegiatan IbM dilaksanakan pada kelompok souvenir sablon digital diÂ Desa Sidodadi dan Karanglo Kecamatan Tawangnangu Kabupaten Karanganyar.Â Kegiatan ini bertujuan untuk: 1 meningkatkan motivasi wirausaha mitra; 2Â meningkatkan pemahaman mitra tentang perencanaan bisnis dan manajemenÂ usaha; 3 meningkatkan kemampuan SDM dalam teknik produksi dan pemasaran;Â serta 4 mengembangkan jejaring kewirausahaan pemuda untuk menopangÂ pengembangan ekonomi kreatif.

(Technical Monitor)\n\n1994-01-01\n\nOn July 5, 1994, an IBM Scalable POWER parallel System (IBM SP2) with 64 nodes, was installed at the Numerical Aerodynamic Simulation (NAS) Facility Each node of NAS IBM SP2 is a \"wide node\" consisting of a RISC 6000/590 workstation module with a clock of 66.5 MHz which can perform four floating point operations per clock with a peak performance of 266 Mflop/s. By the end of 1994, 64 nodes of IBM SP2 will be upgraded to 160 nodes with a peak performance of 42.5 Gflop/s. An overview of the IBM SP2 hardware is presented. The basic understanding of architectural details of RS 6000/590 will help application scientists the porting, optimizing, and tuning of codes from other machines such as the CRAY C90 and the Paragon to the NAS SP2. Optimization techniques such as quad-word loading, effective utilization of two floating point units, and data cache optimization of RS 6000/590 is illustrated, with examples giving performance gains at each optimization step. The conversion of codes using Intel's message passing library NX to codes using native Message Passing Library (MPL) and the Message Passing Interface (NMI) library available on the IBM SP2 is illustrated. In particular, we will present the performance of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) kernel from NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB) under MPL and MPI. We have also optimized some of Fortran BLAS 2 and BLAS 3 routines, e.g., the optimized Fortran DAXPY runs at 175 Mflop/s and optimized Fortran DGEMM runs at 230 Mflop/s per node. The performance of the NPB (Class B) on the IBM SP2 is compared with the CRAY C90, Intel Paragon, TMC CM-5E, and the CRAY T3D.\n\nCyber crime: can a standard risk analysis help in the challenges facing business continuity managers?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVande Putte, Danny; Verhelst, Marc\n\nRisk management has never been easy.
