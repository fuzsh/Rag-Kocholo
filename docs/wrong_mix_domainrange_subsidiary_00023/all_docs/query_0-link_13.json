        "text": "The Engineering and Technology History Wiki aims to build the premier oral history collection of engineers and technologists in the world. An \"oral history\" differs from an \"interview\" in that interview is a finished product that you might see in the newspaper, on TV, or in some other medium. It is meant to convey particular information.\n\nAn oral history, on the other hand, is considered by historians to be a \"primary source,\" raw data from which they will, in combination with other primary and secondary sources, create historical narratives. Although a historian might also use a magazine interview or a videotaped speech as a primary source, an oral history is a document created by themselves or another historian through the informal recording of a dialogue between interviewer and interviewee. Although edited by the interviewer to conform with the IEEE Social Media Operations and Best Practices Guide, flow, style and consistency, and by the interviewee to confirm that his or her words have been appropriately captured, an oral history transcript is relatively unedited when compared to other forms of interview.\n\nThe ETHW is determined to preserve as source material for the future historians of technology the personal memories of pioneers in the electrical, electronics, and computer fields, the technologists who transformed the world in the 20th and 21st centuries. We also preserve the personal memories of those who have played major roles in the various engineering associations.\n\nThe ETHW oral history collection is made up of oral histories conducted and owned by the ETHW partner societies, which include: AIAA, AIChE, AIME, ASHRAE, ASCE, ASME, IEEE, SPE and SWE. The conducting society of the oral history is noted at the end of the description in the abstract.\n\nThe following oral histories represent the views of the interviewee and they do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the ETHW partner societies. Interviews should be viewed as a part of the historical record and as a window into the environment many of our members and colleagues have faced during their careers.\n\nFor more information on IEEE's Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct please visit the IEEE Code of Ethics\n\nOral History Collections\n\nThe oral histories on the ETHW can be broken down into several collections:\n\nAIME and Its Member Societies: AIST, SME, SPE, and TMS\n\nAIME and Its Member Societies: AIST, SME, SPE, and TMS - complete list of AIME interviews\n\nAssociation for Iron and Steel Technology\n\nSociety for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration\n\nSociety of Petroleum Engineers\n\nThe Minerals, Metals, and Materials Society\n\nASME\n\nASME Presidents\n\nIEEE\n\nIEEE Oral History Collection - complete list of IEEE interviews\n\nDistinguished Female Leaders: Inspiring the Next Generation in STEM\n\nGlobal Positioning System\n\nFrederick E.
