        "text": "So Magnetica is finished and ready for release. Is the album about bringing the focus back to an electronic approach to production?\n\nYes, I think so. I’ve always continued to be involved with electronic music and spinning electronic music as a DJ, but I just stepped away from making it. I guess by saying “club sound” you always come off as if you’re making big room dance anthems, which isn’t the case, but I think it’s about getting back to an electronic approach with a certain amount of musicality and groove that I’ve learnt with the live stuff.\n\nIt very much sounds like a Quantic record in terms of having lots of live instrumentation. Would you agree that the electronic elements are quite subtle in the album?\n\nI think more and more there’s an ability to make electronic things sound natural and there’s a way of making natural acoustic elements sound electronic. I can easily transfer something, play it on a live instrument and then make that more synthetic and vice versa. Making beats can be quite awkward and you have to massage it a little bit until it sounds fluid.\n\nHow did you approach song-writing for the album?\n\nTo give you an example, “Spark It” has got drums in it which are sampled from a record and cut up and spliced using a Drum Rack. Then I have this Univox drum machine which has got this old school, ‘70s, rudimentary sort of sound, and then there’s some synths in there like the PolySix plugin from Korg. Then I recorded some skanks in from my guitar, and I recorded piano skanks from an acoustic piano and then the vocal element I recorded in Los Angeles on Ableton with Shinehead, and the sax was recorded in Bogota. Then I did several mixes. I had a little console with an external Space Echo and a Fairchild, a Moog and a bunch of other stuff, and then I paired the two mixes I most liked left and right in mono and then we cut that to vinyl and recorded it back in with a Shure V-15 stylus at The Carvery, my friend’s cutting spot. So that’s the journey of one song and it has lots of different mediums, instruments and sources as well.\n\nWere you working on each track one at a time?\n\nI’ve had all the songs open throughout the time so there’s no one song I fully committed to. I was slowly, slowly chipping away at them so where one song ended I’d start another and then when I’d learnt something or I felt there was something missing from the previous song I’d go back and have another attempt, and that could be a blessing and a curse because there’s just endless revisions.\n\nThere is an impressive array of performers who contributed to the album. Was it a case of recording these snippets or sessions whenever you were in a particular place with a view to working them into your music at a later stage?\n\nYes and no. There’s one track on the record with Thalma De Freitas, a song called “Águas De Sorongo”, which I had as an idea from this recorded guitar loop to which I added some beats on Ableton. I met this really cool percussionist called Duane in Rio, so we got together in a studio and recorded the percussion. I had already sent the idea to Thalma and was going back and forth with her about having her sing on the song and we ended up recording the song in her living room. I was travelling with this little AKG microphone, and wrapped some muslin gauze around it as a little pop shield element. Then I went back to Bogota, worked more on the beats and then ended up sending the track to Miguel Atwood-Ferguson in Los Angeles for him to record a string arrangement. I can’t just turn up with the singer and go, “can you sing something and then I’ll work on the song afterwards?” but often I have a harmonic starting point, record the singer or record some horns, and then just take the carpet away from under it and replace it with something completely different.\n\nIs Latin America is still very much a focal point as far as influences and inspiration goes for you?\n\nI always saw Latin America as having a very disciplined rhythmic catalogue, so to speak. For somebody interested in rhythm it’s a really amazing place because every country and community has a rhythmic discipline. In Columbia alone there are so many rhythms and so many different styles. I like the way the rhythm precedes the song somewhat, rumba rhythms, cumbia rhythms, tambora, these are all musical styles but the rhythm is what precedes it.\n\nSome of the traditional percussion on a track such as “Duvido” is very off grid compared to the electronic beats. Is that quite purposeful, to juxtapose the rigidity of the programmed drums against the looser organic material?\n\nThere’s a lot more 6/8 on this record. With those rhythms there’s a lot more things that sit on the passing of the bar, which gives it this rolling effect. I really like that idea that nothing really sits on the one, because there’s a tendency with Ableton that everything is on the one and that’s something I really don’t like.\n\nHow much do the traditional instruments end up informing the electronic elements? Do the tunings of certain drums dictate the tuning for the rest of a track?\n\nYou do have to adapt to the instruments. On “Duvido” I was starting off with a backing idea that I took to the marimba player and I know that his marimbas are in C major so I had to prepare for that. Often that also happens with singers, and I think for “La Plata” on the record Nidia was struggling at first just because it was just a little bit out of her range, so we had to bring it down a little bit. You have to find the sweet spot with a singer. A singer’s range I think is very important.\n\nTo use Alice Russell as an example, because you two have worked together for many years now, do you feel you know her vocal range intuitively in terms of the music that you make together?\n\nAlice’s range is probably the best range of a singer I’ve ever worked with. She’s never once asked me to change the pitch of the song. That’s why it’s so great to work with her because she can sing so high and she can sing really in key and she’s got a tremendous range on the top of her voice and then she’s also got a great range on the bottom. Sometimes working with more traditional instruments, you have a lot more micro-tones as well. Not everything is exactly in tune so if I’m tuning an instrument in a session I’ll just do it by ear to a keyboard or something rather than just tuning it exactly with a tuner. I think it pays for everything to be slightly out of tune with each other."
