        "text": "Exhibit 99.1\n\nSaba Announces Fourth Quarter and Record Fiscal Year 2011 Results\n\nRedwood Shores, Calif., July 20, 2011  Saba (NASDAQ: SABA), the premier People Cloud provider, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2011.\n\nWe grew our SaaS bookings 276% and SaaS revenue 59% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. We now have one of the fastest growing SaaS businesses among public companies, said Bobby Yazdani, Chairman and CEO of Saba. We signed four of the five largest transactions in our history during the fiscal year, with all four customers selecting Saba People Cloud Applications. The transformation of our business to SaaS from license is well ahead of plan. I want to take this opportunity to thank the Saba team for all their hard work and dedication, and congratulate them on their success in enabling Saba to become a world-class SaaS company.\n\nSaaS revenue steadily increased during fiscal year 2011, growing 8% in the first quarter, 19% in the second quarter, 42% in the third quarter, and 59% in the fourth quarter over the respective year-ago periods. Nine of our 12 largest deals in the fourth quarter were for SaaS offerings. The number of new SaaS transactions over $50,000 increased almost three-fold in fiscal year 2011 over fiscal year 2010.\n\nResults for the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2011\n\nRevenues: Total GAAP revenues were $29.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, up 1% from $29.6 million in the same quarter last year. Total Non-GAAP revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 were $30.0 million, up 1%, compared to $29.6 million in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP revenues reflect the exclusion of the fair value adjustments to deferred revenue due to acquisitions.\n\nFor fiscal year 2011, total GAAP revenues increased to $116.7 million from $109.6 million in the year ago period. Total Non-GAAP revenues for fiscal year 2011 increased 7% to $116.7 million from $109.6 million in the year ago period.\n\nDeferred Revenue: Total deferred revenue increased to a record $45.8 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, growing 24% year-over-year and 8% sequentially.\n\nThe following information was filed by Saba Software Inc (SABA) on Wednesday, July 20, 2011 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is an earnings press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.
