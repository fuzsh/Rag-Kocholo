        "text": "WHT on dividends\n\nDividends from Dutch resident corporations are generally subject to a 15% Dutch dividend WHT. In general, this does not apply to the Dutch cooperative (i.e. ‘co-op’) in a business-driven structure, a widely used vehicle for holding and financing activities, although anti-abuse rules are applicable. Additionally, dividends may be exempted under Dutch tax law, subject to anti-abuse rules, if:\n\nthe recipient of the dividends distributed by the Dutch entity is a resident of the European Union, European Economic Area, or another state with which the Netherlands has concluded a tax treaty that includes a dividend article (provided that the company is not regarded as tax resident of another country based on a tax treaty between the state mentioned above and another country), and\n\nthe recipient of the dividends would have been able to apply the Dutch participation exemption or the participation credit to the dividends if it would have been a resident of the Netherlands.\n\nFor more detail on anti-abuse rules applicable to Dutch WHTs, please see Anti-abuse provisions in the Tax administration section.\n\nConditional WHT on interest, royalty, and dividend payments\n\nThe Netherlands applies a conditional withholding tax (WHT) on dividend, interest, and royalty payments (the Conditional Source Taxation Act). This tax is only levied on interest, royalty and dividend payments to affiliated companies in designated low-tax jurisdictions and in certain (tax abuse) situations. In principle, the tax is withheld from the company that makes the payment, but levied from the recipient. However, if the withholding tax has not been applied correctly, the tax inspector may also issue an additional tax assessment to the recipient of the payment or even the director of the paying company. The withholding tax applies to payments made to companies in designated low-tax jurisdictions (i.e. jurisdictions with a statutory CIT rate of less than 9 per cent) or are on the EU list for non-cooperative jurisdictions. A Dutch list of low-taxed and non-cooperative jurisdictions is updated annually on the 1st of October, and becomes applicable the following year. Currently Listed Countries (both Dutch and EU and applicable as of 2024) are American Samoa, Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahama’s, Bahrein, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Fiji, Guam, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, Palau, Panama, Russia, Samoa, Seychelles, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkmenistan, Turks and Caicos Islands, US Virgin Islands, Vanuatu.\n\nThe conditional WHT will only be levied on payments between affiliated companies. For purposes of this conditional WHT, an affiliated company is one that can directly or indirectly exercise a decision-making influence, in any event, if the shareholder has more than 50% of the voting rights. Apart from direct payments made to affiliated companies in Listed Countries, the WHT may also apply to abusive situations (situations where artificial structures are put in place with the main purpose or one of the main purposes to avoid the Dutch WHT).\n\nThe WHT tax is levied at a rate equal to the highest rate of Dutch CIT in the current tax year. For 2023, this rate is 25.8%. The WHT rate may, however, be reduced by a tax treaty. The table below sets out the rates of WHT applicable to the most common payments of dividends under Dutch domestic law where such a liability arises and the reduced rates that may be available under an applicable tax treaty. For interest and royalty payments, we included the levies under the relevant treaty, but keep in mind that the tax is conditional and may not be applicable in your specific situation.\n\nMultilateral Instrument (MLI)\n\nThe MLI may have effect on Dutch tax treaties from 1 January 2020 onwards. The MLI allows countries to quickly and efficiently amend their tax treaties to combat tax avoidance, without the need for renegotiation, and has a fundamental impact on how taxpayers access any tax treaty that both contracting states have opted to be covered by the MLI, subject to the options and reservations both have made in relation to a range of matters (including the date on which it will take effect for particular taxes).\n\nTo prevent treaty abuse, countries can choose to apply the Limitations On Benefits (LOB) provision or the Principal Purpose Test (PPT). The Netherlands has opted to apply the PPT (art. 7 paragraph 1 of the MLI). This means that the benefits of a covered tax treaty will not be attributed for a component of income if obtaining that treaty benefit was one of the principal reasons for an arrangement or transaction that resulted in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit is consistent with the object and purpose of the relevant treaty provision.\n\nOverview of WHT rates for domestic corporations\n\nThe table below provides an overview of the taxes that domestic corporations are required to withhold. The effect of the MLI has been included for the tax treaties of which synthesised texts have been published (Australia, Bosnia Herzegovina, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Georgia, Iceland, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, Serbia, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom) In these texts, the concrete consequences of the MLI are presented in a legible manner in the continuous text of the treaty.\n\nPlease be aware the potential impact of the MLI can change. Always refer to specific treaties to ensure the values are up-to-date, and check the potential impact of the MLI.\n\nDomestic corporations are required to withhold taxes as follows:\n\nWHT (%) Recipient Dividends Interest Royalties Resident corporations 0/15 (1) 0/25 0/25 Resident individuals 15 - - Non-resident corporations and individuals: Non-treaty situations 15 0/25 0/25 Treaty*: Albania 0/5/15 (30) 5/10 (55) 10 (90) Algeria 5/15 (5, 48) 0/8 (56, 57, 58) 5/15 (91) Argentina 10/15 (2) 0/12 (56, 57, 59, 60) 3/5/10/15 (90, 92, 93, 94) Armenia 0/5/15 (3) 0/5 (58, 61, 62) 5 (90) Aruba 5/7.5/8.3/15 (5, 21, 40) 10 (5, 40) 0 (5, 40) Australia 15 10 10 Austria 0 (6) or 5/15 (7) 0 (63) 0/10 (63, 106) Azerbaijan 5/10 (38) 0/10 (57, 58) 5/10 (84, 90) Bahrain 0/10 (5, 8) 0 (5) 0 (5, 90) Bangladesh 10/15 (8) 0/10 (57, 58) 10 (90) Barbados 0/15 (5, 42) 0/5 (5, 57) 5 (5, 90) Belarus 0 (9) / 5 (2) / 15 0/5 (57, 58) 3/5/10 (84, 96, 97) Belgium 0 (6) or 5/15 (5, 8) 0/10 (5, 63) 0 (5, 90) Bermuda 15 25 25 Bosnia Herzegovina 5/15 (2, 4) 0 (4) 10 (4) Brazil 15 (5) 0/10/15 (5, 57, 64) 15/25 (5, 98) Bulgaria 0/15 (6, 8) 0/5 (57, 58) 0/5 Canada 5/10 (10) 0/10 (57, 65) 0/10 (85) Caribbean Netherlands (Bonaire, Saint Eustatius, and Saba) 0/15 (41, 49) 25 25 Chile 5/15 (7) 4/10 (95) 2/10 (107) China, People's Republic of 5/10 (2, 11) 0/10 (66) 10/25 (99) Colombia (5) Croatia 0/15 (6, 8) 0 0 (90) Curaçao 0/15 (5, 46) 0 (5, 88) 0 (5, 88) Cyprus 0 (6) or 0/15 (37) 0 0 (90) Czech Republic 0 (6) or 0/10 (2, 50) 0 0/5 (63) Denmark 0 (6) or 0/15 (8) 0 0 Egypt 0/15 (2) 0/12 (57) 12 (90) Estonia 0 (6) or 5/15 (2) 0/10 (57, 58) 0/5/10 (63, 100) Ethiopia 5/15 (45) 0/10 (57) 5 (90) Finland 0 (6) or 0/15 (37) 0 0 (90) France 0 (6) or 5/15 (2) 0/10 (56, 58, 63) 0 Georgia 0/5/15 (31) 0 0 (90) Germany 0 (6) or 5/15 (5, 12) 0 (5) 0 (5, 90) Ghana 5/10 (8) 0/8 (57) 8 Greece 0 (6) or 5/15 (2) 0/8/10 (63, 68) 0/5/7 (63, 84) Hong Kong 0/10 (42) 0 3 (90) Hungary 0 (6) or 5/15 (2) 0 0 (90) Iceland 0/15 (8) 0 0 (90) India 10/15 (32) 0/10/15 (57, 70) 20 (90) Indonesia 5/10/15 (2, 51) 0/10 (57) 10 (90) Iraq 0/15 (5, 52, 54) 0/5 (5, 56, 57) 7.5 (5, 90) Ireland, Republic of 0 (6) or 0/15 (13, 47) 0 0 (90) Israel 5/10/15 (2) 10/15 (71) 5/10 (69) Italy 0 (6) or 5/10/15 (14) 0/10 (57, 63) 0/5 (63, 90) Japan 0/5/10 (15) 0/10 (56, 57, 73) 0 (90) Jordan 5/15 (8) 0/5 (57) 10 (90) Kazakhstan 0/5/15 (17) 0/10 (57) 10 (90) Korea, Republic of 10/15 (2, 24) 0/10/15 (24, 57, 74) 10/15 (24, 93, 94) Kosovo 15 (5, 54) 0/10 (5, 57, 58, 73) 0 (5, 90) Kuwait 0/10 (8) 0 5 (90) Kyrgyzstan (5) Latvia 0 (6) or 5/15 (2) 0/10 (57, 58, 63, 75) 0/5/10 (63, 100) Liechtenstein 0/15 0 0 (90) Lithuania 0 (6) or 5/15 (2) 0/10 (57, 58, 63) 0/5/10 (63, 100) Luxembourg 0 (6, 18) or 2.5/15 (2, 18) 0 0 Malawi 0/5/15 (5, 19) 0/10 (5, 73) 5 (5, 90) Malaysia 0/15 (7) 0/10 (57) 8 (90) Malta 0 (6) or 5/15 (2) 0/10 (57, 63) 10 (94) Mexico 5/15 (16) 0/5/10 (57, 73) 10 (90) Moldavia 0/5/15 (5, 20) 0/5 (5, 57) 2 (5, 90) Montenegro 5/15 (2, 4) 0 (4) 10 (4) Morocco 10/15 (2, 5) 10/25 (5, 77) 10 (5) New Zealand 15 0/10 (57) 10 (90) Nigeria 12.5/15 (8) 0/12.5 (57) 12.5 (90) North Macedonia 0/15 (8) 0 0 (90) Norway 0/15 (8, 52) 0 0 (90) Oman 0/10 (8) 0 8 (90) Pakistan 10/15 (2) 0/10/15/20 (57, 78) 5/15 (93, 96, 97) Panama 0/15 (42) 0/5 (57, 58, 73) 5 (90) Philippines 10/15 (8) 0/10/15 (57, 79) 15 (102) Poland 0 (6) or 5/15 (8) 0/5 (57, 58, 63) 0/5 (63, 90) Portugal 0 (6) or 10 (5) 0/10 (5, 57, 63) 0/10 (5, 63, 90) Qatar 0/10 (39) 0 5 (90) Romania 0 (6) or 0/5/15 (5, 22) 0/3 (5, 57, 58, 60, 63) 0/3 (5, 63, 90) Rwanda (5) Saudi Arabia 5/10 (8) 0/5 (57) 7 (90) Serbia 5/15 (2, 4) 0 (4) 10 (4) Singapore 0/15 (7) 0/10 (80) 0 (87) Sint Maarten (NL) 0/15 (5, 46, 89) 0 (5, 89) 0 (5, 89) Slovak Republic 0 (6) or 0/10 (2, 50) 0 0/5 (63) Slovenia 0 (6) or 5/15 (8) 0/5 (57, 62, 63) 0/5 (63, 90) South Africa 5/10 (16, 24) 0 (24) 0 (24) Spain 0 (6) or 5/15 (5, 25) 0/10 (5, 63) 6 (5) Sri Lanka 10/15 (2, 5) 0/10 (5, 57) 10 (5, 90) Surinam 7.5/15 (2, 5) 0/5/10 (5, 57, 81) 5/10 (5, 69) Switzerland 0/15 (36, 43) 0 0 (90) Taiwan 10 0/10 (57) 10 (90) Thailand 5/15 (5, 34) 10/25 (5, 57, 82) 5/15 (5, 84) Tunisia 0/15 (8) 0/10 (57) 11 (90) Turkey 5/15 (2) 0/10/15 (57, 83) 10 (90) Ukraine 5/15 (26) 0/5 (57) 5/10 (103) United Kingdom 0 (6) or 0/10/15 (33) 0 0 (90) United States 0/5/15 (27) 0 0 (90, 104) Uzbekistan 0/5/15 (28) 10 10 (90) Venezuela 0/10 (2) 0/5 (57) 5/7/10 (84) Vietnam 5/7/15 (29) 0/10 (57) 5/10/15 (105) Zambia 5/15 (48) 0/10 (57) 7.5 (90) Zimbabwe 10/15 (2) 0/10 (57) 10 (90)\n\n* MLI is applicable, based on the overview provided by the Ministry of Finance.
