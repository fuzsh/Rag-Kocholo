The aim of this systematic review was to assess the health effects of \"hard\" Kung Fu styles by performing electronic and manual searches of the literature. The aspects of health and the Kung Fu style examined varied between most studies; in some cases, the martial art group consisted of practitioners of other martial art styles also. Of 2103 references identified, only nine papers were eligible and reviewed. All were observational studies, observing a range of health aspects possibly related to Kung Fu training or performance. Our findings suggest that there is no evidence that Kung Fu practice is associated with the prevention or treatment of any health condition. However, as a moderate- to high-intensity form of aerobic exercise, it may confer benefits similar to those attributed to other aerobic training modalities. However, this hypothesis remains to be tested in clinical trials. Physiological benefits (e.g., aerobic capacity and bone density) may be associated with long-term Kung Fu practice. Future research in this area should adopt experimental designs, clearly identifying eligibility criteria, testing and training protocols, and include health-related outcomes and documentation of adverse events, to advance knowledge in this field.\n\nAnnual report on JEN-1 and JEN-2 Reactors; Informe periodico de Reactores JEN-1 y JEN-2 correpondiente al ano 1972\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nMontes Ponce de Leon, J.\n\n1974-07-01\n\nIn the annual report on the JEN-1 and JEN-2 reactors the main fractures of the reactor operations and maintenance are described.

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB were found at counts of more than 7 log CFU g-1 in all samples and the total viable counts were about 5-8 log CFU g-1 . Bacillus cereus and yeasts were detected at around 2 log CFU g-1 and 5-6log CFU g-1, respectively. For DGGE analysis, LAB and coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS bacteria dominated over other microorganisms. The sequencing of the DNA bands from DGGE gels corresponding to kung-som samples showed the presence of LAB as the major microflora in the products, namely: Lactobacillus farciminis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus garvieae, Tetragenococcus halophilus and Weissella thailandensis. In addition, Staphylococcus carnosus was detected in kung-som as minor microflora. These dominant strains would allow the development of defined starter cultures for improving the quality of kung-som.\n\nAnnual report on JEN-1 and JEN-2 Reactors\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMontes Ponce de Leon, J.\n\n1974-01-01\n\nIn the annual report on the JEN-1 and JEN-2 reactors the main fractures of the reactor operations and maintenance are described.

Comparative experimental study. University laboratory research. Three groups of 11-13-year-old boys (12 practicing Kung-Fu, 12 practicing swimming and 12 controls). Center of pressure (CoP) excursions were registered in upright bipedal and unipedal stances on a stabilometric force platform in eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) conditions. Kung-fu practitioners control their balance (P Kung-fu training improved (P kung-fu practitioners. Both of these physical activities could be recommended for young adolescents as recreational or rehabilitation programs as they develop specific balance abilities that could be important for improving and maintaining optimal health.

Age-related changes in steroid secretion have been suggested to be an underlying mechanism leading to frailty, depression, and sexual dysfunction. However, Tai chi qigong and similar forms of exercise have been shown to improve a great variety of health-related parameters in older individuals. We examined 56 self-reporting healthy men actively practicing Tai chi qigong and/or self-defense Kung-fu and 55 age-matched self-reporting healthy controls. Saliva samples were obtained in a standardized procedure for subsequent quantification of circulating testosterone and cortisol levels. In addition, depressive symptoms, life satisfaction, and sexual health were assessesd via self-report questionnaires. Age was negatively associated with testosterone, while no association emerged for cortisol. Tai chi qigong and/or self-defense Kung-fu training was neither associated with testosterone nor cortisol. More weekly Tai chi qigong and/or self-defense Kung-fu training (4 or more times per week) was instead associated with a lower CT-ratio, less depressive symptoms, and higher life satisfaction compared to individuals, who trained only one to three times per week. More years of Tai chi qigong and/or self-defense Kung-fu training were associated with less depressive symptoms and higher life satisfaction but not with the CT-ratio. No significant associations emerged for Tai chi qigong and/or self-defense Kung-fu training and sexual health. When compared to the age-matched controls, there is a significant effect of Tai chi, qigong and/or self-defense Kung-fu on the CT-ratio. Contrast analyses revealed a significantly lower CT-ratio for the high training load group in contrast to the low training load group. Further, in contrast to the control group, the low training load group exhibits a significantly higher CT-ratio. For depression, contrast analyses revealed a significantly lower level of depression in the\n\nFactor Analytic Validation of the Ford, Wolvin, and Chung Listening Competence Scale\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMickelson, William T.; Welch, S.

Ivor Jennings (1903â1965) was one of Britain's most prominent constitutional law scholars of the twentieth century. He is mostly famed for his work in the 1930s on English Public Law. In 1941, Jennings, however, moved to Sri Lanka, progressively becoming involved in both an academic and professional capacity with constitutional processes across the decolonizing world in the early stages of the Cold War.

In the visuospatial task the results showed that athletes were faster than the control participants when stimuli were presented at the periphery of the visual field at a middle and high presentation speed with short interstimulus intervals. Athletes were also significantly faster than nonathlete participants when performing motor actions such as hand-tapping with their dominant hand but groups did not differ with the nondominant hand. These results support the view that athletes perform some speeded visuospatial and motor tasks faster than nonathletes under certain conditions. The findings suggest that, after several years of practice, kung fu athletes develop certain skills that allow them to perform motor speed maneuvers under time pressure conditions.\n\nAn In-Depth Analysis of the Chung-Lu Model\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nWinlaw, M. [Lawrence Livermore National Lab. (LLNL), Livermore, CA (United States); DeSterck, H. [Lawrence Livermore National Lab. (LLNL), Livermore, CA (United States); Sanders, G. [Lawrence Livermore National Lab. (LLNL), Livermore, CA (United States)\n\n2015-10-28\n\nIn the classic Erd}os R enyi random graph model [5] each edge is chosen with uniform probability and the degree distribution is binomial, limiting the number of graphs that can be modeled using the Erd}os R enyi framework [10]. The Chung-Lu model [1, 2, 3] is an extension of the Erd}os R enyi model that allows for more general degree distributions. The probability of each edge is no longer uniform and is a function of a user-supplied degree sequence, which by design is the expected degree sequence of the model. This property makes it an easy model to work with theoretically and since the Chung-Lu model is a special case of a random graph model with a given degree sequence, many of its properties are well known and have been studied extensively [2, 3, 13, 8, 9]. It is also an attractive null model for many real-world networks, particularly those with power-law degree distributions and it is sometimes used as a benchmark for comparison with other graph generators despite some of its limitations [12, 11]. We know for example, that the average clustering coe cient is too low relative to most real world networks. As well, measures of a nity are also too low relative to most real-world networks of interest. However, despite these limitations or perhaps because of them, the Chung-Lu model provides a basis for comparing new graph models.\n\nWavelet transform analysis of electromyography kung fu strikes data.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNeto, Osmar Pinto; Marzullo, Ana Carolina de Miranda\n\n2009-11-01\n\nIn martial arts and contact sports strikes are performed at near maximum speeds. For that reason, electromyography (EMG) analysis of such movements is non-trivial. This paper has three main goals: firstly, to investigate the differences in the EMG activity of muscles during strikes performed with and without impacts; secondly, to assess the advantages of using Sum of Significant Power (SSP) values instead of root mean square (rms) values when analyzing EMG data; and lastly to introduce a new method of calculating median frequency values using wavelet transforms (WMDF). EMG data of the deltoid anterior (DA), triceps brachii (TB) and brachioradialis (BR) muscles were collected from eight Kung Fu practitioners during strikes performed with and without impacts. SSP results indicated significant higher muscle activity (p = 0.023) for the strikes with impact. WMDF results, on the other hand, indicated significant lower values (p = 0. 007) for the strikes with impact. SSP results presented higher sensitivity than rms to quantify important signal differences and, at the same time, presented lower inter-subject coefficient of variations. The result of increase in SSP values and decrease in WMDF may suggest better synchronization of motor units for the strikes with impact performed by the experienced Kung Fu practitioners. Key PointsThe results show higher muscle activity and lower electromyography median frequencies for strikes with impact compared to strikes without.SSP results presented higher sensitivity and lower inter-subject coefficient of variations than rms results.Kung Fu palm strikes with impact may present better motor units' synchronization than strikes without.\n\nThe cardiovascular responses of male subjects to kung fu techniques. Expert/novice paradigm.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJones, M A; Unnithan, V B\n\n1998-12-01\n\nThe primary aim was to assess cardiovascular responses of expert and novice subjects to kung fu techniques. It was hypothesised that experienced subjects would demonstrate improved economy of movement during the techniques, evidenced by reduced exercise intensity. a comparative design was established utilising two groups; experienced (group E), and novice (group N). the experimentation took place under laboratory conditions, but was designed to maximise external validity. the only preselection variables were regular attendance at training and experience. Nine experienced males (group E, exp 9.5 +/- 5.2 yrs) and nine novice males (group N, exp 1.2 +/- 0.1 yrs) participated. The only exclusion guidelines were contraindications to participate within a maximal test, no subjects were excluded upon this basis. N/A. each subject participated in three kung fu protocols (forms, kicking and punching). Each protocol, randomly allocated, consisted of ten work (30 sec) and ten rest periods (30 sec). MEASURES taken during the protocols were heart rate (HR) and oxygen consumption (VO2). These were expressed as a percentage of maximal values to reflect exercise intensity. During both the form protocol and punching protocol group E were found to be working at a significantly (p kung fu techniques differ depending upon experience level. It is difficult to directly relate this to improved economy since work output could not be accurately quantified. It was also found that kung fu protocols elicited exercise intensity into the cardiovascular training zone.\n\nThe process of dissemination of kung fu in west â between sense of loss and inevitability loss of sense\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFernando Dandoro Castilho Ferreira\n\n2017-07-01\n\nFull Text Available In this paper, we discuss aspects of the development process of Kung Fu in China and its subsequent spread to the West in the light of sociological theory of Norbert Elias. To meet this goal, we have structured the text into three parts. In the first, we present some elements of theory of Elias that are useful to study Kung Fu. In the second part of the article, in turn, bring some evidence about the Kung Fu diffusion process to the West, taking as a reading aid work âShaolin Monasteryâ of Meir Shahar. The third and final part of the text, we suggest that the reception of Kung Fu in the West engenders a social process that combines elements of Chinese tradition and capitalist modernity, giving the practice a hybrid and ambiguous character.\n\nTai Chi and Kung-Fu practice maintains physical performance but not vascular health in young versus old participants.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMcAnulty, Steven; McAnulty, Lisa; Collier, Scott; Souza-Junior, Tacito P; McBride, Jeffrey\n\n2016-01-01\n\nKung-Fu and Tai Chi along with other martial arts are gaining popularity but studies examining the benefits of martial arts on physical fitness, vascular health, nutrition, and psychological wellness are limited. Aging is associated with declines in these health components. The objectives of this study were to examine whether Tai Chi and Kung-Fu training would maintain physical fitness, vascular health, and psychological wellness components on older versus younger practitioners. Seventeen subjects were recruited and divided into Young (age Kung-Fu maintains physical fitness in older compared to younger practitioners. However, age associated changes in cardiovascular stiffness, systolic blood pressure, and pain were not prevented.\n\nEstudo do centro de massa e estabilidade de quatro posturas bÃ¡sicas do Kung-fu Pak Hok\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nMiranda,Pedro Jeferson; Brinatti,AndrÃ© MaurÃ­cio; Silva,Silvio Luiz Rutz da; Godoy,Marino Luiz Michelin\n\n2016-01-01\n\nEste trabalho trata da anÃ¡lise dos centros de massa e do cÃ¡lculo da estabilidade das quatro posturas bÃ¡sicas do Kung Fu Pak Hok.

Only the men, three advanced and seven intermediate, were considered for comparisons between levels. Reaction time values were obtained using two high speed cameras that recorded each strike at 2500 Hz. Force of impact was measured by a load cell. For comparisons of groups, force data were normalized by participant's body mass and height. Precision of the strikes was determined by a high speed pressure sensor. The results show that palm strikes were stronger than punches. Women in the study presented, on average, lower values of reaction time and force but higher values of precision than men. Advanced participants presented higher forces than intermediate participants. Significant negative correlations between the values of force and precision and the values of force and reaction time were also found.\n\nPREFACE: Festschrift to mark the sixtieth birthday of Professor Jens Lothe\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJÃ¸ssang, Torstein; Barnett, David M.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe collection of papers in this Festschrift represents the proceedings of a symposium held at the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters on November 25-26, 1991, marking the occasion of the sixtieth birthday of Professor Jens Lothe. The symposium organizers attempted to invite contributors, either written, oral, or both, from a group of international scientists who have either collaborated with Jens in the past or whose work has had a significant impact in one of three areas in which Jens has focussed his own research interests, namely, statistical physics, elasticity and elastic waves, and the theory of dislocations in crystalline solids. The extent to which we have succeeded in obtaining a proper spectrum of contributors and contributions must be judged by the readers of this volume. It is rather rare in modern times to encounter a physicist such as Jens who has made seminal contributions in fields as diverse as the three included in this Festschrift. For this reason it is both historically interesting and instructive to follow the path that Jens Lothe's research career has taken him, since doing so clearly points out the international nature of the scientific endeavor and the fact that the search for scientific truth transcends national borders and governmental ideologies. Jens' postdoctoral studies at the University of Bristol in the late 1950s brought him in contact with an American postdoctoral student, John Hirth, who had worked on nucleation theory and condensation under the late Professor G M Pound at Carnegie-Mellon University. (Alex Maradudin, one of the contributors to the surface wave session of this symposium was also a postdoctoral fellow at Bristol at this time.) Both Lothe and Hirth had come to Bristol to acquaint themselves with dislocation theory; their first joint paper on double-kink nucleation theory was followed by numerous joint efforts, including their now-classic book Theory of Dislocations. Clearly, their interaction jelled.

The whole process is modeled here using an integrated approach, which we call EpiJen. EpiJen is based on quantitative matrices, derived by the additive method, and applied successively to select epitopes. EpiJen is available free online. Results To identify epitopes, a source protein is passed through four steps: proteasome cleavage, TAP transport, MHC binding and epitope selection. At each stage, different proportions of non-epitopes are eliminated. The final set of peptides represents no more than 5% of the whole protein sequence and will contain 85% of the true epitopes, as indicated by external validation. Compared to other integrated methods (NetCTL, WAPP and SMM, EpiJen performs best, predicting 61 of the 99 HIV epitopes used in this study. Conclusion EpiJen is a reliable multi-step algorithm for T cell epitope prediction, which belongs to the next generation of in silico T cell epitope identification methods. These methods aim to reduce subsequent experimental work by improving the success rate of epitope prediction.\n\nThe Shock and Vibration Digest.

All subjects were asked to strike a basketball. Hand and ball speed (sbf) were determined by high-speed video analysis. The value for me was determined by an equation that does not depend upon postimpact measurement of the hand speed. The results show that kung fu athletes had greater shi (6.67 [SD 1.42] m/s), p = 0.042), higher me (2.62 [SD 0.33] kg, p = 0.004), and greater sbf (9.00 [SD 1.89] m/s), p = 0.004) than the nonpractitioners (5.04 [SD 0.57] m/s, 1.33 [SD 0.19] kg, and 5.72 [SD 0.44] m/s, respectively). Comparing the average values obtained for me and hand and forearm mass (m), it was found that for the control group me is statistically equal to m (p = 0.917), whereas for the kung fu group me is significant greater than m (p = 0.003). It is suggested that for impacts against heavier objects, the effective mass would be the main factor to distinguish a martial arts-trained from an untrained subject.\n\nTowards a New Confessionalism: Elizabeth Jennings and Sylvia Plath\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nDowson, Jane\n\n2011-01-01\n\nDue to their self-disclosing manner, both Elizabeth Jennings (1926-2001) and Sylvia Plath (1932-63) have been labelled âconfessionalâ yet have markedly different life experiences and profiles in literary and popular imaginations.

Namun, kuatnya terpaan kebudayaan seni bela diri impor yang masuk (karate, kung fu, tae kwon do, muay thai, capoeira, dll, yang selalu didukung dengan berbagai kemasan media entertainment modern, membuat silat menjadi kalah populer bahkan di mata dan persepsi masyarakat Indonesia sendiri. Hal ini mengakibatkan para generasi muda memandang seni bela diri impor menjadi lebih superior ketimbang pencak silat. Jika hal ini terus berlangsung tanpa ada usaha untuk mengembangkan pencak silat melalui media modern, maka akan sangat sulit untuk mempertahankan dan mengembangkan tradisi ini di masa depan. Tujuan dari makalah ini ialah untuk membuktikan dan menggali potensi animasi sebagai media alternatif yang efektif untuk memvisualisasikan adegan dan cerita bertemakan pencak silat. Adapun studi kasus yang menjadi acuan dalam penelitian ialah film animasi âKung Fu Pandaâ. Penelitian ini mengkaji studi kasus dengan menggunakan metode kualitatif deskriptif, lalu dianalisis dengan pendekatan analisis deskriptif untuk mengkaji dan mengidentifikasi pemasalahan dan solusi. Pembahasan dari makalah lebih ditekankan pada kekuatan penyampaikan cerita melalui gambar (visual storytelling yang efektif terkait dengan pencak silat.

He exhibited distinctive facial features, severe growth retardation with relative macrocephaly, and friendly, hyperactive behavior. His dysmorphic features might suggest a congenital histone modification defect syndrome, such as Kleefstra, CoffinâSiris, or RubinsteinâTaybi syndromes, which are indicative of functional interactions between the casein kinase II, alpha 1 gene and histone modification factors.

Under aerobic conditions, the expression of JEN1 is regulated by the carbon source: the gene is repressed by glucose and induced by non-fermentable substrates. JEN1 expression is also controlled by oxygen availability, but is unaffected by the absence of haem biosynthesis. JEN1 is negatively regulated by the repressors Mig1p and Mig2p, and requires Cat8p for full derepression. In this report we demonstrate that, in addition to these regulators, the Hap2/3/4/5 complex interacts specifically with a CAAT-box element in the JEN1 promoter, and acts to derepress JEN1 expression. We also provide evidence for transcriptional stimulation of JEN1 by the protein kinase Snf1p. Data are presented which provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms implicated in the co-regulation of genes involved in the metabolism of lactate.\n\n13-16-vuotiaiden tyypin 1 diabetesta sairastavien tyttÃ¶jen liikuntatottumukset\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nVainionpÃ¤Ã¤, Milja; MykkÃ¤nen, Janika\n\n2016-01-01\n\nOpinnÃ¤ytetyÃ¶n tavoitteena oli tuottaa tietoa terveydenhuollon ammattihenkilÃ¶ille 13â16-vuotiaiden tyypin 1 diabetesta sairastavien tyttÃ¶jen liikuntatottumuksista ja liikunnan harrastamisesta.

It was originally fueled with 20%-enriched uranium but more recently with 90%-enriched fuel. It now appears that it will have to be converted back to using 20%- enriched fuel. Progress is presently being made in fuel fabrication. Plates with meat thicknesses of up to 1.5 mm have been fabricated. Plates are being tested with 40 wt % uranium in the fuel meat. Progress is also being made in reactor design in collaboration with atomic energy commissions of other countries for swimming pool reactors being designed or under construction in Chile, Ecuador, and Spain itself. The design studies address core optimization, safety analysis report updating, irradiation facilities, etc. Core optimization is specifically addressed in this paper. A common swimming-pool-type reactor such as the JEN-1 served as an example. The philosophy adopted in this study is not to try to match the high enrichment core, but rather to treat the design as new and try to optimize it using simplified neutronic/thermal hydraulic/economic models. This philosophy appears to be somewhat original. As many as possible of the fuel parameters are constrained to remain constant\n\nAn Investigation of the Painting Technique in Portraits by Jens Juel\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nSlotsgaard, Tine Louise\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis paper summarizes the findings of the first technical art historical study executed on paintings by the Danish portrait painter Jens Juel.

They performed 5 palm strikes to a freestanding basketball, recorded by high-speed camera at 1000 Hz. Nonparametric comparisons and correlations showed experienced practitioners presented larger values of mean muscle force, mean impact force, mean muscle power, mean impact power, and mean striking efficiency, as is noted in evidence obtained for other martial arts. Also, an interesting result was that for experienced Kung Fu practitioners, muscle power was linearly correlated with impact power (p = .98) but not for the novice practitioners (p = .46).\n\nElectromyographic Study of a Sequence of Yau-Man Kung Fu Palm Strikes with and without Impact.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNeto, Osmar Pinto; Magini, Marcio; Pacheco, Marcos T T\n\n2007-01-01\n\nIN MARTIAL ARTS AND CONTACT SPORTS, STRIKES ARE OFTEN TRAINED IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS: with and without impacts. This study aims to compare the electromyographical activity (EMG) of the triceps brachii (TB), biceps brachii (BB) and brachioradialis (BR) muscles during strikes with and without impacts. Eight Yau-Man Kung Fu practitioners participated in the experiment. Each participant performed 5 sequences of 5 consecutive KF Yau-Man palm strikes with no impact intercalated with 5 sequences of 5 repetitions targeting a KF training shield. Surface EMG signals were obtained from the TB, BB, and RB for 3.0 seconds using an eight-channel module with a total amplifier gain of 2000 and sampled at 3500 Hz. The EMG analyses were done in the time (rms) and frequency (wavelet) domains. For the frequency domain, Morlet wavelet power spectra were obtained and an original method was used to quantify statistically significant regions on the power spectra. The results both in the time and frequency domains indicate a higher TB and BR muscle activity for the strikes with impacts. No significant difference was found for the BB in the two different scenarios. In addition, the results show that the wavelet power spectra pattern for the three analysed muscles obtained from the strikes with and without impacts were similar. Key pointsEMG analysis of a sequence of Kung Fu strikes demonstrates higher Triceps Brachii and Brachioradialis muscle activity for strikes with impact than strikes without impact.An original reliable method for quantifying EMG wavelet transform results is presented.EMG wavelet power spectra describe muscle roles during a Kung Fu sequence of strikes.\n\nAnnual report on JEN-1 reactor; Informe periodico del Reactor JEN-1 correspondiente al ano 1971\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nMontes, J\n\n1972-07-01\n\nIn the annual report on the JEN-1 reactor the main features of the reactor operations and maintenance are described.

Constraints from the Kung Co half graben\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMahÃ©o, G.; Leloup, P. H.; Valli, F.; Lacassin, R.; Arnaud, N.; Paquette, J.-L.; Fernandez, A.; Haibing, L.; Farley, K. A.; Tapponnier, P.\n\n2007-04-01\n\nThe timing of E-W extension of the Tibetan plateau provides a test of mechanical models of the geodynamic evolution of the India-Asia convergence zone. In this work we focus on the Kung Co half graben (Southern Tibet, China), bounded by an active N-S normal fault with a minimum vertical offset of 1600 m. To estimate the onset of normal faulting we combined high and medium temperature (U-Pb, Ar/Ar) and low temperature ((U-Th)/He) thermochronometry of the Kung Co pluton, a two-mica granite of the northern Himalayan granitic belt that outcrop in the footwall of the fault. Biotite and muscovite Ar/Ar ages , are close from each other [Ë 16 Ma Â± 0.2 (Ms) and Ë 15 Â± 0.4 Ma (Bt)], which is typical of fast cooling. The zircon and apatite (U-Th)/He ages range from 11.3 to 9.6 Ma and 9.9 to 3.7 Ma respectively. These He ages are indicative of (1) fast initial cooling, from 11.3 to Ë 9 Ma, gradually decreasing with time and (2) a high geothermal gradient (Ë 400 Â°C/km), close to the surface at Ë 10 Ma. The Kung Co pluton was emplaced at about 22 Ma (U-Pb on zircon) at less than 10 km depth and 520-545 Â°C. Subsequent to its shallow emplacement, the pluton underwent fast thermal re-equilibration ending around 7.5 Ma, followed by a period of slow cooling caused either by the end of the thermal re-equilibration or by very slow exhumation (0.02-0.03 mm/yr) from Ë 7.5 Ma to at least 4 Ma. In either case the data suggest that the exhumation rate increased after 4 Ma. We infer this increase to be related to the initiation of the Kung Co normal fault. A critical examination of previously published data show that most Ë N-S Tibetan normal faults may have formed less than 5 Ma ago rather than in the Miocene as assumed by several authors. Such a young age implies that E-W extension is not related to the Neogene South Tibetan magmatism (25 to 8 Ma). Consequently, models relating E-W extension to magmatism, such as convective removal of the lower lithosphere, may be inappropriate\n\nLevey-Jennings Analysis Uncovers Unsuspected Causes of Immunohistochemistry Stain Variability.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVani, Kodela; Sompuram, Seshi R; Naber, Stephen P; Goldsmith, Jeffrey D; Fulton, Regan; Bogen, Steven A\n\nAlmost all clinical laboratory tests use objective, quantitative measures of quality control (QC), incorporating Levey-Jennings analysis and Westgard rules. Clinical immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing, in contrast, relies on subjective, qualitative QC review. The consequences of using Levey-Jennings analysis for QC assessment in clinical IHC testing are not known. To investigate this question, we conducted a 1- to 2-month pilot test wherein the QC for either human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) or progesterone receptor (PR) in 3 clinical IHC laboratories was quantified and analyzed with Levey-Jennings graphs. Moreover, conventional tissue controls were supplemented with a new QC comprised of HER-2 or PR peptide antigens coupled onto 8 Î¼m glass beads. At institution 1, this more stringent analysis identified a decrease in the HER-2 tissue control that had escaped notice by subjective evaluation. The decrement was due to heterogeneity in the tissue control itself. At institution 2, we identified a 1-day sudden drop in the PR tissue control, also undetected by subjective evaluation, due to counterstain variability. At institution 3, a QC shift was identified, but only with 1 of 2 controls mounted on each slide. The QC shift was due to use of the instrument's selective reagent drop zones dispense feature. None of these events affected patient diagnoses. These case examples illustrate that subjective QC evaluation of tissue controls can detect gross assay failure but not subtle changes. The fact that QC issues arose from each site, and in only a pilot study, suggests that immunohistochemical stain variability may be an underappreciated problem.\n\nAn Image of Britain during the Second World War: The films of Humphrey Jennings (1939-1945 Une image de la Grande-Bretagne pendant la Seconde Guerre mondialeÂ : les films de Humphrey Jennings (1939-1945\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nElena Von Kassel\n\n2009-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Il sâagit de chercher Ã comprendre comment le style poÃ©tique a pu atteindre des sommets avec les films de Humphrey Jennings dans le documentaire anglais et comment ces films rÃ©sultent dâun mÃ©lange entre deux traditions du cinÃ©ma britannique, traditions jusque-lÃ opposÃ©es. A lâinitiative dâAlberto Cavalcanti, en 1939, The First Days, corÃ©alisÃ© par Humphrey Jennings, Harry Watt et Pat Jackson, fut, au tout dÃ©but la guerre, le premier film offrant une rÃ©flexion sur des rÃ©alitÃ©s, lorsque lâon avait essayÃ© de manipuler le public dans Le lion a des ailes, tournÃ© la mÃªme annÃ©e, mais aussi Â le premier film anglais de propagande de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, dont Alexander Korda avait lancÃ© et soutenu la rÃ©alisation. Quand, partant pour Ealing Studios, Cavalcanti quitte la direction de la GPO Film Unit, il est remplacÃ© par Ian Dalrymple, le producteur du film Le lion a des ailes. Câest sous la direction de Dalrymple quâau GPO, dÃ©sormais appelÃ© Crown Film Unit, un nouveau genre de film put Ã©merger.

Several key indicators show that P. pelagicus population is in crisis. Fishing mortality shows an increase to 4.14. The exploitation rate is 0.71, higher than the optimal value of 0.38. The size of the mature females has also decreased from 8.10Â±0.39 cm to 7.52Â±1.14 cm. The average fecundity is 0.572Ã10(6)Â±0.261Ã10(6) eggs per batch, and the sex ratio (male:female) is 1:0.92. Based on these results, a sustainable management program for P. pelagicus was proposed as follows: (i) closing the bay during the spawning season, (ii) restoration of the Enhalus acoroides seagrass beds, (iii) restocking crab larvae in the bay and (iv) educating and networking all stakeholders to develop a better understanding of the ecology of the crab to support sustainable fishery management in Kung Krabaen Bay.\n\nIndole and synthetic derivative activate chaperone expression to reduce polyQ aggregation in SCA17 neuronal cell and slice culture models\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKung PJ\n\n2014-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Pin-Jui Kung,1,* Yu-Chen Tao,1,* Ho-Chiang Hsu,1 Wan-Ling Chen,1 Te-Hsien Lin,1 Donala Janreddy,2 Ching-Fa Yao,2 Kuo-Hsuan Chang,3 Jung-Yaw Lin,1 Ming-Tsan Su,1 Chung-Hsin Wu,1 Guey-Jen Lee-Chen,1 Hsiu-Mei Hsieh-Li1 1Department of Life Science, 2Department of Chemistry, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan; 3Department of Neurology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan *These authors contributed equally to this work Abstract: In spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17, the expansion of a translated CAG repeat in the TATA box binding protein (TBP gene results in a long polyglutamine (polyQ tract in the TBP protein, leading to intracellular accumulation of aggregated TBP and cell death. The molecular chaperones act in preventing protein aggregation to ameliorate downstream harmful events. In this study, we used Tet-On SH-SY5Y cells with inducible SCA17 TBP/Q79-green fluorescent protein (GFP expression to test indole and synthetic derivative NC001-8 for neuroprotection. We found that indole and NC001-8 up-regulated chaperone expression to reduce polyQ aggregation in neuronal differentiated TBP/Q79 cells. The effects on promoting neurite outgrowth and on reduction of aggregation on Purkinje cells were also confirmed with cerebellar primary and slice cultures of SCA17 transgenic mice. Our results demonstrate how indole and derivative NC001-8 reduce polyQ aggregation to support their therapeutic potentials in SCA17 treatment.

A point of interest from that approach is the role of lateralized motor experiences on handedness. In this study, intermanual performance asymmetry in sport-specific movements and manual preference in daily living tasks were compared between Kung Fu athletes and novices. Analysis of movement time in the performance of interlaterally symmetric and asymmetric movement patterns showed smaller intermanual performance asymmetry in experts. Analysis of manual preference using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory indicated that experts presented predominantly weak or moderate strength of right hand preference.

Jennings's Biophilosophical Responses to Neovitalism, 1909-1914.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRussell, Doug\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe sustained interdisciplinary debate about neovitalism between two Johns Hopkins University colleagues, philosopher Arthur O. Lovejoy and experimental geneticist H. S. Jennings, in the period 1911-1914, was the basis for their theoretical reconceptualization of scientific knowledge as contingent and necessarily incomplete in its account of nature. Their response to Hans Driesch's neovitalist concept of entelechy, and his challenge to the continuity between biology and the inorganic sciences, resulted in a historically significant articulation of genetics and philosophy. This study traces the debate's shift of problem-focus away from neovitalism's threat to the unity of science - \"organic autonomy,\" as Lovejoy put it - and toward the potential for development of a nonmechanististic, nonrationalist theory of scientific knowledge. The result was a new pragmatist epistemology, based on Lovejoy's and Jennings's critiques of the inadequacy of pragmatism's account of scientific knowledge. The first intellectual move, drawing on naturalism and pragmatism, was based on a reinterpretation of science as organized experience. The second, sparked by Henri Bergson's theory of creative evolution, and drawing together elements of Dewey's and James's pragmatisms, produced a new account of the contingency and necessary incompleteness of scientific knowledge. Prompted by the neovitalists' mix of a priori concepts and, in Driesch's case, and adherence to empiricism, Lovejoy's and Jennings's developing pragmatist epistemologies of science explored the interrelation between rationalism and empiricism.\n\nJens Baggesen voyageur en France.

An empirical model applied to data obtained by a high-speed camera describes the kinematic characteristics of the movement. The electromyographic patterns of the biceps brachii, brachioradialis and triceps brachii muscles were studied during the strike in the time (root mean square) and frequency (wavelet transform) domains. Eight KF practitioners participated in the investigation. A wooden board was placed in front of the subjects, and they were asked to perform the strike imagining a target above the board. The results show that the Yau-Man KF palm strike has very similar kinematic characteristics to a simple moderate speed elbow extension movement. All practitioners positioned themselves in relation to the wooden board in a way to achieve their highest hand speeds in the instant their hands crossed the board. The analyses of the electromyography data shows a well developed muscle coordination of the practitioners in agreement with kinematic results. The results of this paper are important not only for improving the performance of practitioners but also to demonstrate the applicability of KF in the process of motor control development.\n\nCalculations of Changes in Reactivity during some regular periods of operation of JEN-1 MOD Reactor; Calculo de vairaciones de reactividad en algunos periodos regulares de operacion del reactor JEN-1 Mod.\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nAlcala Ruiz, F\n\n1973-07-01\n\nBy a Point-Reactor model and Perturbation Theory, changes in reactivity during some regular operating periods of JEN-1 MOD Reactor have been calculated and compared with available measured values. they were in good agreement.

Twenty subjects (age: 13.3 Â± 1.8 y; BMI percentile: 98.6(86.5 - 99.8); 60% girls) were randomly-assigned to the supervised KF or placebo (Tai Chi, TC) control group 3 d.wk(-1) for 6 months. We assessed body composition, including total and regional fat and lean mass, total and regional bone mineral density (BMD), percent lean and fat mass, body mass index and waist circumference, at baseline and after 6 months of training using anthropometry and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Habitual physical activity and dietary intake were recorded as covariates via self-report at each time-point. As expected due to natural growth, significant increases in height, weight, total and lumbar BMD, and lean mass were seen in the cohort over time, with a trend for increased whole body fat mass, with no difference between groups. By contrast, percent fat and android fat mass via DXA did not increase in either group over time. The absence of a similar expected increase in central adiposity over 6 months could indicate a positive effect of participation in both programs on the metabolically critical abdominal adiposity in this cohort. Further research in this area is warranted to determine ways to increase uptake and compliance, and to see if longer-term martial arts training not only maintains, but improves abdominal fat mass and related metabolic health indices in overweight/ obese adolescents. Key pointsParticipation in our martial arts trial attenuated the increases in body fat mass expected due to growth in our overweight/obese adolescent group.All subjects allocated to the Kung Fu intervention were satisfied with their Kung Fu training, in contrast to our placebo-exercise (Tai Chi) subjects, suggesting that this form of\n\nVÃ¡clav CÃ­lek: ZchudnutÃ­ lidstva by bylo jen nÃ¡vratem k normÃ¡lu [Rozhovor\n\nCzech Academy of Sciences Publication Activity Database\n\nTuÄek, J.; CÃ­lek, VÃ¡clav\n\n2010-01-01\n\nRoÄ. 4, 2010.06.25 (2010), s. 1-3 ISSN 1803-4543 Institutional research plan: CEZ:AV0Z30130516 Keywords : mineral resources * oil * oil accidents * global changes Subject RIV: DB - Geology ; Mineralogy http://www.e15.cz/nazory/rozhovory/vaclav-cilek-zchudnuti-lidstva-by-bylo-jen-navratem-k-normalu\n\nSpectroscopic system for impurity measurements in the TJ-1 Tokamak of JEN; Un sistema espectroscopico para medidas de impurezas en el Tokamak TJ-1 de la JEN\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nNavas, G; Zurro, B\n\n1982-07-01\n\nwe describe a spectroscopic system with spatial resolution capability that has been configured for plasma diagnostic in the TJ-1 Tokamak of JEN.

To examine the efficacy of a six-month Kung Fu (KF) program on physical fitness in overweight/obese adolescents. Methods. Subjects were randomly assigned to the KF or sham exercise (Tai Chi, TC) control group. Physical measurements in cardiovascular fitness and muscle fitness occurred at baseline and after 6 months of training thrice weekly. Results. Twenty subjects were recruited. One subject was lost to follow-up, although overall compliance to the training sessions was 46.7 +/- 27.8%. At follow-up, the cohort improved in absolute upper (P = .002) and lower (P = .04) body strength, and upper body muscle endurance (P = .02), without group differences. KF training resulted in significantly greater improvements in submaximal cardiovascular fitness (P = .03), lower body muscle endurance (P = .28; significant 95% CI: 0.37-2.49), and upper body muscle velocity (P = .03) relative to TC training. Conclusions. This short-term KF program improved submaximal cardiovascular fitness, lower body muscle endurance, and muscle velocity, in overweight/obese adolescents with very low baseline fitness.\n\nDevelopment of Taiwanâs strategies for regulatingÂ nanotechnology-based pharmaceuticals harmonized with international considerations\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGuo JW\n\n2014-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Jiun-Wen Guo,1 Yu-Hsuan Lee,2 Hsiau-Wen Huang,3 Mei-Chyun Tzou,3 Ying-Jan Wang,2 Jui-Chen Tsai1,4 1Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Medicine, National Chung Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; 2Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; 3Food and Drug Administration, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taiwan; 4Center for Pharmaceutical Regulatory Science, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan Abstract: Nanotechnology offers potential in pharmaceuticals and biomedical developments for improving drug delivery systems, medical imaging, diagnosis, cancer therapy, and regenerative medicine. Although there is no international regulation or legislation specifically for nanomedicine, it is agreed worldwide that considerably more attention should be paid to the quality, safety, and efficacy of nanotechnology-based drugs. The US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency have provided several draft regulatory guidance and reflection papers to assist the development of nanomedicines. To cope with the impact of nanotechnology and to foster its pharmaceutical applications and development in Taiwan, this article reviews the trends of regulating nanotechnology-based pharmaceuticals in the international community and proposes strategies for Taiwanâs regulation harmonized with international considerations. The draft regulatory measures include a chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC review checklist and guidance for CMC review of liposomal products. These have been submitted for discussion among an expert committee, with membership comprised of multidisciplinary academia, research institutions, the pharmaceutical industry, and regulators, and are currently approaching final consensus.

In 1954, he founded what would later become the Department of Automatic Control at the Norwegian Institute of Technology in Trondheim. This name was changed to the Department of Engineering Cybernetics in 1972 to reflect the broader efforts being made, not only within the purely technical disciplines, but also within biology, oceanography and medicine. Balchen established an advanced research community in cybernetics in postwar Norway, whose applications span everything from the process industry and positioning of ships to control of fish and lobster farming. He was a chief among the tribe of Norwegian cybernetics engineers and made a strong impact on his colleagues worldwide. He planted the seeds of a whole generation of Norwegian industrial companies through his efforts of seeking applications for every scientific breakthrough. His strength and his wisdom in combination with his remarkable stubbornness gave extraordinary results.\n\nPrometeo I.

Two novels in particular, Sprouts from Red Earth and Behind You, were widely praised for their realistic representation of life on the peninsula, especially their depiction of Japanese imperialist activities and the anti-colonial pushback from Koreans. How exactly these novels were to be interpreted varied according to audience, however, giving rise to competing images of Nakanishi. Some critics considered him to be an advocate of a newly emerging international proletarian consciousness while other readers, including many Koreans, looked on Nakanishi (whom they called ChungsÅ Ijijo, the Korean reading of his name as a supporter of colonial nationalism. Still others contested his claim to authenticity altogether. In tracing the development of these interpretations of Nakanishi from these early works up until his participation in the founding of the Korean Artist Proletarian Federation (KAPF in August 1925 and after, the article argues that his worksâ ability to successfully navigate the period of a dawning proletarian cultural movement through to its collapse lay (and continues to lie in their ambiguity, an ambiguity that has facilitated a continual reinterpretation of him from the 1920s to the present day.\n\nKung Fu Training Improves Physical Fitness Measures in Overweight/Obese Adolescents: The âMartial Fitnessâ Study\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTracey W.

Although insulin sensitivity did not change, HbA(1c) tended to decrease over time (p = 0.09), again with no group difference (p = 0.60). Reduced CRP was related to increased upper body strength (p = 0.01). Increased lean body mass was related to reductions in HbA(1c), insulin resistance, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. Improvements in lean body mass appear to have a potential role in favorable metabolic outcomes, independent of changes in fat mass. Further research in this area is warranted before definite conclusions can be drawn about the efficacy of martial arts training for metabolic outcomes in this cohort.\n\nThe effect of some organic substances on the mycelium of the fungus Ustilago nuda (Jens.) Rostr.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKrÃ¡tkÃ¡, J\n\n1976-01-01\n\nResearch was performed for studying the effect of some organic compounds, considered by many authors as the products ob barley seed metabolism generated after anaerobic seed treatment, on the mycelium of the fungus Ustilago nuda (Jens.) Rostr. The author examined the effectiveness of ethylacohol, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, and hydroquinone in concentrations from 1 M to 10(-6) M, and the effectiveness of extracts from disinfected seeds in doses from 10 g to 0.001 g/l. The effect of the mentioned solutions was examined as exerted on the growth of dicaryotic mycelium and on the growth of the haploid promycelium of the fungus. The dicaryotic mycelium of Ustilago nuda (Jens.) Rostr. was cultivated on potato agar with benzoic acid. The presence of the acid prevents mitosis, and the chlamydospores germinate on the nutritive medium with two fibres having binuclear cells. The haploid promycelium was cultivated on potato agar; chlamydospores germinated with one four-cell fibre, and individual cells are mononuclear and haploid. Only later, a dicarytic mycelium is created in a complex process. In all the substances used, the concentration of 1 M was found to stop further growth of mycelium. The concentration of 10(-1) M of acetic acid and hydroquinone also stopped growth, the same concentration of acetaldehyde, lactic acid, succinic acid, ethylacohol stimulated mycelium growth in comparison with the control. The concentration of 10(-6) M stimulated mycelium growth in a majority of cases. Extracts from disinfected seeds did not influence mycelium growth significantly in all cases in comparison with the control. The results were similar in the two types of mycelium.\n\nLa tradiciÃ³n en la teologÃ­a de JenÃ³fanes Tradition in Xenophanes's theology\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCarlos Gustavo Carrasco Meza\n\n2010-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Este trabajo busca tanto relacionar la teologÃ­a de JenÃ³fanes con la cosmovisiÃ³n heredada de la Ã©pica, como encontrar vestigios de la nueva religiosidad griega del siglo VI a. C. La posibilidad de hallar rastros de pitagorismo en los fragmentos nos obliga a postular la relaciÃ³n necesaria entre la defensa de una nueva fe y la crÃ­tica a la religiÃ³n tradicional. JenÃ³fanes atribuye cuatro caracterÃ­sticas a dios: unicidad, inmovilidad, espiritualidad, eternidad. Es posible ver en la obra de Homero una prefiguraciÃ³n de algunos de estos atributos y es posible, ademÃ¡s, reconocer en ellos la influencia de las nuevas corrientes mistÃ©ricas que reformularon algunos de los conceptos religiosos tradicionales o los rechazaron, dada la incompatibilidad entre la inmoralidad y la divinidad.This article attempts to relate theology of Xenophanes with worldview that goes back to epic poetry and to find traces of new religiosity in century VI B. C. Possibility to find traces of Pythagorism in fragmente forces us to suggest a necessary relation between defense of a new faith and criticism of traditional religiÃ³n. Xenophanes ascribes to god four characteristics: oneness, immobility, spirituality, eternity. It is possible to find in Homer's work a precedent of some attributes and it is possible too to recognize innuence of new mystery religions that reform many religious concepts or reject them because of incompatibility between immorality and divinity.\n\nBiogeochemical characteristics of Kuan-Tzu-Ling, Chung-Lun and Bao-Lai hot springs in southern Taiwan.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMaity, Jyoti Prakash; Liu, Chia-Chuan; Nath, Bibhash; Bundschuh, Jochen; Kar, Sandeep; Jean, Jiin-Shuh; Bhattacharya, Prosun; Liu, Jiann-Hong; Atla, Shashi B; Chen, Chien-Yen\n\n2011-01-01\n\nHot springs are the important natural sources of geothermally heated groundwater from the Earth's crust. Kuan-Tzu-Ling (KTL), Chung-Lun (CL) and Bao-Lai (BL) are well-known hot springs in southern Taiwan. Fluid and mud (sediments) samples were collected from the eruption points of three hot springs for detailed biogeochemical characterization. The fluid sample displays relatively high concentrations of Na(+) and Cl(-) compared with K(+), Mg(2+), Ca(2+), NO(2) (-), and SO(4) (2-), suggesting a possible marine origin. The concentrations of Fe, Cr, Mn, Ni, V and Zn were significantly higher in the mud sediments compared with fluids, whereas high concentrations of As, Ba, Cu, Se, Sr and Rb were observed in the fluids. This suggests that electronegative elements were released during sediment-water interactions. High As concentration in the fluids was observed to be associated with low redox (Eh) conditions. The FTIR spectra of the humic acid fractions of the sediments showed the presence of possible functional groups of secondary amines, ureas, urethanesm (amide), and silicon. The sulfate-reducing deltaproteobacterium 99% similar to Desulfovibrio psychrotolerans (GU329907) were rich in the CL hot spring while mesophilic, proteolytic, thiosulfate- and sulfur-reducing bacterium that 99% similar to Clostridium sulfidigenes (GU329908) were rich in the BL hot spring.\n\nFilm Censorship Policy During Park Chung Heeâs Military Regime (1960â1979 and Hostess Films\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMolly Hyo Kim\n\n2018-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Park Chung-heeâs military government (1960-1979 purportedly used film censorship to distract the public from political consciousness by controlling political materials in films while condoning censorship control on sexual content. As a result, the production of soft-core adult films soared and became popular among Korean audiences. One such film genre that thrived during this period, so-called hostess films (prostitute films, is worthy of attention for the filmsâ foregrounding issues of class, poverty and other social issues that the state censorship board heavily regulated. In viewing such dynamics between state censorship and film, this article aims to unravel the questions of how the state was willing to turn a blind eye to the explicit sexualization of women in hostess films when film censorship was at its peak and why the social and political aspects of this group of films about female sexual workers were not considered socially relevant by the censorship board, through scrutinizing the interplay between Parkâs state censorship and hostess films. Furthermore, it offers an analysis of a hostess film, The Rose that Swallowed Thorn (Cheong, 1979, as a case study to show how it strategically orchestrates visual and thematic elements to circumvent censorship enforcement.\n\nSelections From Kung-Jen JIH-PAO (Source Span: 9 May-30 June 1961) Number 7 -Communist China.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n1961-08-17\n\nsulphate Ammonium hydrogen carbonate Sodium borate TitaniÃ¼m-iron powder Sodium fluoride Silicon dioxide Barium chloride beryllium carbonate ...Vinzenstrasse, 22a :â P. 0.

Beyond the Archive: Memory, Narrative, and the Autobiographical Process\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLucas Bietti\n\n2016-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Jens BROCKMEIER's new book proposes a very provocative aim for memory studies: \"[T]o radically re-think our very idea of memory and challenge the notions of remembering and forgetting that we have taken for granted\" (p.vii. The main target for the author's critique is the archival model of memory. In order to support his approach, the author provides empirical evidence from the neurosciences, social sciences, and humanities. \"Beyond the Archive\" represents an innovative contribution to the field of memory studies. It brings together disparate disciplinary fields in a novel and sophisticated fashion with a clear goal in mind: to propose a new model for the analysis of autobiographical remembering. BROCKMEIER's book is a true exercise of multidisciplinary research in action, which is much needed in the current climate of psychological and neuroscientific reductionism in the sciences of memory.
