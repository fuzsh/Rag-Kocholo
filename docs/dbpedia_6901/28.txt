Barbara Robinson was born Barbara Jean Webb on October 24, 1927, in Portsmouth, Ohio. She began writing in elementary school as a hobby and for fun. She received a BA in theatre from Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania and worked as a librarian before beginning her writing career.

She wrote her stories as a reader, anxious to see what would be on the next page. “Sometimes the characters step in and show me what happens next.”
