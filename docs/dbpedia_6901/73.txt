(1927–2013). Although not a prolific writer, children’s author Barbara Robinson produced some creatively insightful books in the latter half of the 20th century. She was especially noted for writing the novel The Best Christmas Pageant Ever (1972), a humorous look at the troublemaking children in the Herdman family.

Robinson was born Barbara Jean Webb on October 24, 1927, in Portsmouth, Ohio. She grew up an avid reader and began to write stories and poetry when she was young. She received a bachelor’s degree in theater from Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. Shortly thereafter she married John Robinson, and the couple settled in Pennsylvania.

Barbara Robinson began her career by writing short stories that she submitted to magazines such as McCall’s, Good Housekeeping, and Redbook. The Best Christmas Pageant Ever was an expanded version of a short story titled “The Christmas Pageant” that McCall’s published in 1971. This story revolves around six poor, delinquent siblings who take over a church’s play depicting the story of Mary, Joseph, and baby Jesus. Although the children bring chaos to the production, they also lend a humanness to the characters they portray that turns the play into a special performance. Robinson adapted the book into both a television movie, which appeared in 1983, and a play. Her books The Best School Year Ever (1994) and The Best Halloween Ever (2004) also involved the Herdman family.

Among Robinson’s other books is Temporary Times, Temporary Places (1982), a young-adult novel delving into first love and family relationships. My Brother Louis Measures Worms and Other Louis Stories (1988) is a collection of humorous short stories about a family and their crazy misadventures. Robinson died on July 9, 2013, in Berwyn, Pennsylvania.
