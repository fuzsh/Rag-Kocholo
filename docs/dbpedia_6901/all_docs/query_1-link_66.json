        "text": "The Best Christmas Pageant Ever.\n\nROBINSON, Barbara.\n\nItem Number: 108363\n\nNew York: Harper & Row, Publishers, 1972.\n\nFirst edition of this Christmas classic. Octavo, original illustrated boards. Presentation copy, inscribed by the author on the title page, “For you, Joan, Enjoy! Barbara Robinson June 5, 1991.” Near fine in a near fine dust jacket. Jacket design by Judith Gwyn Brown.\n\nThe Best Christmas Pageant Ever tells the story of six misfit children who volunteer to star in their town's Sunday school Christmas pageant, and end up teaching the town the true meaning of Christmas. The book was adapted by Robinson into a play which was first performed on November 26, 1982 by the Seattle Children's Theatre. \"The Best Christmas Pageant Ever\" is a play performed annually for over 20 years by Stage One, the world renowned Theatre for Young Audiences in Louisville, KY. Other theatres that have performed the play are the Public Theatre of Kentucky in Bowling Green, KY, and by The Communication Department of Mississippi College in Clinton, MS. The book was next adapted into a television movie on ABC in 1983, starring Loretta Swit and Fairuza Balk."
