        "text": "Friends and family gathered Monday to say goodbye to Barbara K. Robinson, a Hermosa Beach philanthropist and breast cancer activist who died last week.\n\nA well-attended service at Rolling Hills Covenant Church in Rolling Hills Estates honored Robinson, who died Thursday at age 53 after battling cancer on and off for about 12 years, according to her family.\n\nBorn Oct. 7, 1955, in Los Angeles, Robinson grew up in Lennox and the Palos Verdes Peninsula, graduating in 1973 from Rolling Hills High School, now Palos Verdes Peninsula High School.\n\nIn 1983 she married Frank Robinson, the founder of Torrance-based Robinson Helicopters, where she worked for many years.\n\nCourt documents show the couple filed for divorce in 2003.\n\nFirst diagnosed with breast cancer in 1997, Robinson beat the disease only to relapse several years later, and then again in 2004, she told the Daily Breeze in 2005.\n\nShe established the Robinson Breast Cancer Research Fund with a $3 million contribution in early 2005.\n\nLater that year, she opened p.i.n.k., a Hermosa Beach boutique whose profits benefited the research fund.\n\nRobinson told the Breeze that she opened the store, its name an acronym for “People inspiring new knowledge,” with the hope of mining positivity from her cancer battle.\n\nThe store ultimately closed in 2008, but preserving the 1920s Craftsman-style home at 238 Pier Ave. earned Robinson commendations from the city as well as the Hermosa Beach Historical Society.\n\nA few years later, Robinson went on to become the historical society’s biggest donor, contributing $50,000 toward the 2007 opening of the society’s museum, said Rick Koenig, president of the group.\n\n“She was a person who exuded kindness and generosity,” he said. “She was the kind of woman who, the moment you meet her, the light in her eyes tells you that this is a good person who cares about her fellow human being.”\n\nRobinson is survived by a daughter, Cindy Robinson; a son, Mark Robinson; and two sisters, Mary Ann Krauss and Christine Krauss Scheele."
