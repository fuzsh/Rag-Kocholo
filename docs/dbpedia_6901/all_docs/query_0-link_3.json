        "text": "Author Barbara Robinson, who introduced the rambunctious Herdman family – “absolutely the worst kids in the history of the world” – in her bestseller The Best Christmas Pageant Ever, died on July 9. She was 85.\n\nRobinson was born and grew up in southern Ohio, in the river town of Portsmouth. She often credited her life in that small town as inspiring her writing, saying that it provided “great stuff to feed the imagination.” An avid reader and writer from an early age, Robinson followed her passion for both drama and writing when she attended Allegheny College in Pennsylvania. She graduated in 1948; in 1949 she married John Robinson; their family grew to include two daughters. Robinson made her home and worked in Berwyn, Pa., a Philadelphia suburb, for many years"
