        "text": "I started in the real estate professional right out of college to join the family business started by my Father in 1971 called Red Apple Realty with its iconic big Red Apple \"For Sale\" signs and reputation for excellence in the real estate profession. I now own the company and have loved what I have done ever since I started! Highly trained and thoroughly experienced to represent buyer clients as well as seller clients, I believe Columbia County is a rare and beautiful jewel of the Hudson Valley that should be explored. I am a savvy negotiator who can help my clients achieve their real estate goals.\n\nWhether I am assisting a first time home buyer or a New York City second home weekender, it thrills me to show off our stunning area from rolling farmland to the niche hot spots and restaurants of the City of Hudson, all of which I specialize in! I get joy out of helping someone find just the right place to call home, or assisting a seller who is making their next step in life. I've had the pleasure of continual repeat business and referrals from my past clients and there is no greater honor than becoming a family's local REALTOR!\n\nBeing a lifelong resident of Columbia County, my knowledge of the area and 30 years experience in the business combine for excellent service to my clients. I have been recognized with the REALTOR ASSOCIATE of the Year in 1988, and REALTOR of the Year in 2011 at my local Board of REALTORS. I hold the professional designation of the GRI, (Graduate REALTOR Institute), have served on my local Columbia-Greene Board of REALTORS and Columbia-Greene Northern Dutchess MLS as a Director and as committee chairs over the years; I instruct Orientation for new REALTORS joining our Board, and am also very active at the New York State of REALTORS where I serve on many committees, and have chaired the MLS Policies, Professional Standards and Legal Action Committees for its 50,000+ members. I am a National Association of REALTORS Professional Standards member and an NAR trained Mediator. I also hold an Insurance license and the Certified Insurance Counselor, (CIC) and Certified Risk Manager, (CRM) designations. I put all of this experience and knowledge together to help my client’s real estate dreams come true!\n\nWhen not doing what I do best, I enjoy ballroom dancing and have just started dancing competitively!"
