        "meta_description": "I write paranormal romance featuring traditional witches in historical and contemporary settings. I am an unrepentant optimist who believes that lasting love is possible, so it follows that my stories almost always feature happily-ever-after endings. My writing includes elements of magic, rooted in the cultural and spiritual traditions of pre-Christian Europe. I find inspiration in myths and folktales, poems and ballads, historical sources and academic writing. I also draw inspiration from nature. I live in Nova Scotia, in the shadow of ancient mountains that lie along the Bay of Fundy coast. New Scotland has a magic all its own, with mist covered valleys and wild, windswept shorelines. These rugged vistas shape my story settings, while providing the perfect backdrop for life with my husband, our three hounds and our dragon (Pogona Vitticeps).",
