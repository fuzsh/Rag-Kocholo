        "text": "A CURE FOR SPRING FEVER by Barbara Robinson\n\nFiction, Paranormal Romance, Novella, 73 pages\n\n5*****\n\nBlurb: For centuries, Gamekeepers have used their magical abilities to create a buffer between the creatures who dwell in the enchanted forest and the sleepy coastal town that sits in its shadow. When Gamekeeper Stan Ross’s magic begins to fail, he must find out what went wrong, then fix it before the two worlds collide. His hit or miss magic has already led to a few close calls so he journeys to the Sacred Isle searching for answers and advice.Finding a cure proves elusive—until Stan encounters a kitchen witch who captivates him body and soul. Lynnette Peters is healing from her own wounds, however, and it isn’t clear whether she’s ready to open herself to the possibility—or the peril—of love.\n\nThoughts: This was a cute short novella full of magic and mischief and the old ways. Lynette and Stan are perfect for each other – they just don’t know it yet and it’s up to the High Priestess to pull some strings and see to it that they get together.\n\nIf you like mixing your romance with magic, definitely pick this one up. It won’t disappoint. And there’s a HEA ending that satisfies. Grab a cup of tea (or whatever) and curl up for a sweet story.\n\nDisclaimer: Disclosure of Material: I received a final and/or advanced reader copy of this book with the hope that I will leave my unbiased opinion.
