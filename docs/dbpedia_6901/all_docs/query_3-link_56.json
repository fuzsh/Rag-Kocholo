        "text": "Name Barbara Robinson writes as B. J. Robinson\n\nWhere are you from Louisiana\n\nA little about your self `ie your education Family life ect Married with five children and 12 grandchildren, two dogs, and a cat. All my children have made me a grandmother multiple times. I have a golden cocker spaniel and a golden retriever. I have a Masters degree in Curriculum, Instruction, and Assessment, and a Bachelor’s in secondary education in Business Education/Office Administration with a minor in English. I’m a member of The Christian Writers Guild started by Jerry B. Jenkins, a graduate of Long Ridge Writers Institute, and a friend of American Christian Fiction Writers (ACFW). I have a novel titled Last Resort that released July 15, 2011, Christian romantic suspense.\n\nFiona: Tell us your latest news? My latest news is my just-released novel Southern Superstitions, released January 15 from Desert Breeze Publishing, Inc. in California. It’s also a Christian romantic suspense and has three five-star reviews already on Amazon.com. Prayer versus southern superstitions when a woman’s husband mysteriously disappears in the swamp on a deer-hunting trip. Reviewer Kathy Boswell says, “Very good! She never gives up hope that Andy will return to her someday. She puts it all in God’s hands like she’d done every crisis in her life. She knows He will take care of this for her.” As steamy as the hot, thick sticky heat of Louisiana, this page-turner will keep readers in suspense, as the author spins a tale of love, loss, superstition, pain, heartache, and faith in god. God and the power of prayer versus superstitions. Through belief, faith, hard work, the power of prayer, and God’s help, this powerful, moving story is a thought-provoking Christian romantic suspense about a young couple who fall in love, but have to change her mother’s mind in more ways than one, if their relationship is to survive. Can Andy convince Jue there’s more to their relationship than friends? Will he win the approval of Mrs. Myrtle, June’s mother? Can love survive strawberry season, an April flood, superstitions, and an accident? They have to change her mother’s mind in more ways than one if their love is to survive. Will June be able to give Andy a child?\n\nRead the first two chapters and first reviews free at : http://www.amazon.com/Southern-Superstitions-ebook/dp/B006X8GAWA/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1327008085&sr=1-2\n\nBook trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNoo962DbF0&feature=share\n\nFiona: When and why did you begin writing? I started writing and was published in the third grade when my teacher submitted a story to the local newspaper about my pet dog. In college, my first essay was published in a local newspaper, and my short story won first prize in fiction-writing competition. I’ve always loved reading and writing. I read more books and gave more book reports than other students when I was in school, and I joined the library club and devoured books each summer.\n\nFiona: When did you first consider yourself a writer? When my short story won first prize, that validated it for me, and I developed that prize-winning short story into a full-length novel, Southern Superstitions.\n\nFiona: What inspired you to write your first book? My love of reading and writing and my mother and father. I also read other romance authors and decided I could write such a book as many as I’d read. I penned Southern Superstitions before my mother died, and my youngest sister read it to her over and over. She loved it, but did not live to see it published.\n\nFiona: Do you have a specific writing style? I don’t think I do anything differently than other writers. Sometimes I like to write the traditional way, with a spiral notebook and pen. Other times I key from the computer. If it’s pretty outside, I like to sit in the sunshine and listen to the birds sing and watch the squirrels play or look at water while I write. I get my first draft down first go around and then go back and layer and edit. I’ve used Natalie Goldberg’s timed writing method for deep writing, and it’s worked for me. I have three of her books on writing. When I first became serious about writing a book, bought her Writing Down the Bones.\n\nFiona: How did you come up with the title? It’s set in the South and it’s about superstitions, and I try to stick to two-word titles.\n\nFiona: Is there a message in your novel that you want readers to grasp? Put your trust and faith in Jesus, not superstitions.\n\nFiona: How much of the book is realistic? It’s realistic fiction, but it’s fiction. I did draw upon my own experiences from working in strawberries to write it, but there is no Old Blue, and Mom never owned a strawberry farm. I picked and packed berries growing up. I picked them for a local schoolteacher before school in the mornings and after school in the evenings to earn extra spending money. I worked in them for my aunt on weekends.\n\nFiona: Are experiences based on someone you know, or events in your own life? Events in my own life. One of my sons was two weeks overdue. I worked in berries. Mom raised me on Bible verses and superstitions. I did survive two floods in my life, and one was an April flood.\n\nFiona: What books have most influenced your life most? The Bible, the best book in the world. Henry David Thoreau’s WALDEN. Lynn Austin’s ALL SHE EVER WANTED, Chris Fabry’s DOGWOOD. Growing up, the Little House series by Laura Ingalls Wilder and Nancy Drew Mysteries.\n\nFiona: If you had to choose, which writer would you consider a mentor? My writing mentor is Eva Marie Everson with the Christian Writers Guild, and she is also an author, so I’d have to say her both ways.\n\nFiona: What book are you reading now? I’m in between books at the moment, but you can visit my blog at http://barbarajrobinson.blogspot.com to see many I’ve read, loved, and reviewed.\n\nFiona: Are there any new authors that have grasped your interest? I love Naomi Musch’s writing style. She’s a Desert Breeze author, too. She wrote The Green Veil and The Red Fury, and I love her characters and description. Shawna K. Williams, also a Desert Breeze author has several times I really enjoyed, and Nike Chillemi wrote BURNING HEARTS and GOODBYE NOEL.\n\nFiona: What are your current projects? I’m working on a YA novel that will release in October titled ONE RAINY SUMMER, and I have to complete edits on WHISPERING CYPRESS, another romantic suspense that releases in August.\n\nFiona: Name one entity that you feel supported you outside of family members. The Christian Writers Guild and American Christian Fiction Writers\n\nFiona: Do you see writing as a career? Yes\n\nFiona: If you had to do it all over again, would you change anything in your latest book? I think you always find something you wished you’d caught or tweaked, but as far as the plot itself, I feel great about it. I rewrote and reworked the middle and the ending, and it went through two edits.\n\nFiona: Do you recall how your interest in writing originated? I owe my love to writing to my third grade schoolteacher who got me started, and I hope she sees from heaven above.\n\nFiona: Can you share a little of your current work with us?\n\nPrologue\n\nChristmas\n\nNo word of Andy made the cold Christmas Day stab like an ice pick. The search party disbanded at nightfall Christmas Eve and picked the search up again at day break, but they’d found no sign of his father Andy, the deer hunter.\n\nRod joined them. He guided a canoe deep into the marshes and swamps, where his dad went into the wetlands. He’d deer hunted with him many times, so he knew where to check.\n\nHe slid the canoe through a wall of cypress trees, deeper and deeper into the heart of the swamp. He figured his father headed for the hills. White cranes flew from the cypress limbs. The canoe hit a cypress knee, and Rod gently eased it around a few. The way they stuck out of the shallow water like protruding nubs, they reminded him of his grandmother’s warning finger wagging in his face. They could tear a hole in the bottom of a boat. Thank God my boat survived the lick. Maybe that’s what happened to Dad.\n\nFinally, after 12 hours of searching, Rod spotted his dad’s pirogue on one side of the hills, where they’d deer hunted the previous year. But, there was no sign of him. He found the dome tent on the other side, and the supplies were still there. It looked as though he never got to deer hunt or put any of his supplies to use. Where was he?\n\nThey searched until dusk. Rod dreaded giving his mother the disappointing news. She’d worry even more, because the pirogue was in perfect condition and so was the tent. No leaking pirogue kept him from coming home. The campsite looked peaceful and serene, as though nothing invaded it, but still there was no sign of his father. Mom’s on pins and needles, yet she clings to her faith and trust in God. I hear her faithfully pray for Dad’s safe return every day. Maybe she won’t fall apart when she hears the news.\n\nRumors flow through the little town like an April flood. What has really become of Andy? What will June do without him? What does she do? Does she wait for him? Does he ever return? Did he leave her for another woman, or did he meet some horrible fate in that deep, dark, mysterious swamp? Dive right into the river, campground, and a red, ripe, juicy berry for a sensational strawberry story. Read the novel and find out the answers to all these questions and more as you learn about picking edible mushrooms and bayou asparagus. Who knows, someday you might have to survive in the woods? Don’t miss B. J. Robinson’s Sensational Strawberry Tales. Follow her Christian Inspirational Romantic Suspense writing and win free novels at http://barbarajrobinson.blogspot.com. Don’t miss Last Resort, B. J. Robinson’s debut Strawberry Sensation. Two Desperate People–one last resort. Faith Grace Roussell is stalked by her ex-fiancée and forced to search her conflicted heart. The men in her family used guns, but only for hunting. The women never touched them. In a battle of love, loss, and raging jealousy, she strives to build a new life with peace and contentment, but Matt Allen has eyes like magnets she could get as lost in as unknown woods.\n\nFiona: Is there anything you find particularly challenging in your writing? I love editing and layering as much as I love writing, and I don’t have problems with writers’ block, so the only thing I can think of is wishing I had more time to devote to it.\n\nFiona: Who is your favorite author and what is it that really strikes you about their work? My favorite new author is Naomi Musch, and I love her characters, descriptions, details, and writing style. Her books are deep, and I like them that way.\n\nFiona: Do you have to travel much concerning your book(s)? Not at this time.\n\nFiona: Who designed the covers? My publisher has cover artist who do the covers, and they’re hard to beat. She does a beautiful job on them.\n\nFiona: What was the hardest part of writing your book? I had fun writing this one and rewriting it. It wasn’t hard; it was fun, but I did have a harder time with LAST RESORT and spent three years writing it compared to writing SOUTHERN SUPERSTITIONS in nine months and then spending six more reworking and rewriting it.\n\nFiona: Did you learn anything from writing your book and what was it? I learned how to move blocks of text around to make the book read better and make it more interesting with SOUTHERN SUPERSTITIONS. LAST RESORT is the book I learned the most writing. With it, I joined a critique group with (ACFW) and learned so much in it. I also took writing classes through Christian Writers Guild while I wrote the novel, which is why it took me so long to finish that one.\n\nFiona: Do you have any advice for other writers? Join a great critique group. You’ll learn more in one than from any writing book.\n\nFiona: Do you have anything specific that you want to say to your readers? I hope you have as much fun reading my novels as I did writing them, and I hope you know Jesus as a best friend as I do.\n\nFiona: If you were not a writer what else would you like to have done ? Teach, and I do."
