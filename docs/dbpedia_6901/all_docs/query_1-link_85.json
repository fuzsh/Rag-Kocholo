        "text": "Name B. J. or Barbara Robinson\n\nWhere are you from? Louisiana\n\nA little about your self `ie your education Family life etc I have an Associate of Arts in Office Administration, a bachelor’s in Office Administration/Business Education, and a master’s in Curriculum/Instruction\n\nFiona: Tell us your latest news?\n\nI recently published a new novel titled Louisiana Sunset, and I’m working on it’s sequel, Louisiana Sundown. I’m also working on a contemporary romance set in Florida.\n\nFiona: When and why did you begin writing?\n\nI’ve been writing since the third grade when my short story was published in a local newspaper, my first college essay was published in another local paper, and a short story won first prize in college and was published in the university’s literary magazine. I’ve always loved writing from the third grade.\n\nFiona: When did you first consider yourself a writer?\n\nWhen my short story won first prize and then I sold an article to the local newspaper.\n\nFiona: What inspired you to write your first book?\n\nMy mother’s superstitions and beliefs in God influenced me to write Southern Superstitions.\n\nFiona: Do you have a specific writing style?\n\nSeat-of-the-pants mostly\n\nFiona: How did you come up with the title?\n\nTitles are never a problem for me. I can come up with titles easy and from there go with a novel, which is what I usually do,\n\nFiona: Is there a message in your novel that you want readers to grasp?\n\nEach novel has a theme that I hope my readers will grasp.\n\nFiona: How much of the book is realistic?\n\nMy books are fiction though I do use real travel experiences in my writing and life experience.\n\nFiona: Are experiences based on someone you know, or events in your own life?\n\nUsually events in my own life, and I get ideas from music and travel.\n\nFiona: What books have most influenced your life most?\n\nThe Bible\n\nFiona: If you had to choose, which writer would you consider a mentor?\n\nEva Marie Everson because she was truly my writing mentor\n\nFiona: What book are you reading now?\n\nJust finished The Best of Me by Nicholas Sparks\n\nFiona: Are there any new authors that have grasped your interest?\n\nI buy many books by new authors. I especially enjoy Naomi Musch, though I can no longer say she’s a new author since she has several novels under her belt. I love the way she includes nature and vivid description in her novels.\n\nFiona: What are your current projects?\n\nI just answered this question above. Louisiana Sundown and Love Beneath a Florida Sky\n\nFiona: Name one entity that you feel supported you outside of family members.\n\nMy critique group\n\nFiona: Do you see writing as a career?\n\nYes\n\nFiona: If you had to do it all over again, would you change anything in your latest book?\n\nYes, I always want to go back and make changes and improve then.\n\nFiona: Do you recall how your interest in writing originated?\n\nI enjoy writing about my pets and family and was encouraged to continue writing by my family. Being published early on encouraged me to continue.\n\nFiona: Is there anything you find particularly challenging in your writing?\n\nFinding the time to go back and improve older books since my writing has improved.\n\nFiona: Who is your favorite author and what is it that really strikes you about their work?\n\nI love Nicholas Sparks because his novels are so powerful with love and romance stories, and I don’t consider them a cheesy romance because he includes real-life situations and even gets literary at times.\n\nFiona: Do you have to travel much concerning your book(s)?\n\nNo\n\nFiona: Who designed the covers?\n\nI take my pictures, and my granddaughter or a friend makes my covers.\n\nFiona: What was the hardest part of writing your book?\n\nUsually getting started is the hardest part for me. Once I get the first three chapters, I can keep going.\n\nFiona: Did you learn anything from writing your book and what was it?\n\nThere’s always room for improvement. Join a critique group so you can learn more than you will from any class. Read, read, read in your genre. Edit, edit, edit.\n\nFiona: Do you remember the first book you read?\n\nNancy Drew mysteries. Grew up on them.\n\nFiona: What makes you laugh/cry?\n\nSad stories and sad movies make me cry. Funny ones make me laugh. I’m an emotional woman.\n\nFiona: Is there one person pass or present you would meet and why?\n\nI’d like to meet Eva Marie Everson, my writing mentor, one day. We worked together online.\n\nFiona: What do you want written on your head stone and why ?\n\nNever thought about this, but perhaps. She lived, loved, and wrote.\n\nFiona: Other than writing do you have any hobbies ?\n\nFishing, gardening, cooking, reading\n\nFiona: What TV shows/films do you enjoy watching?\n\nI don’t watch a lot of TV, but I love the Sherwood movies, Survivor, and Touched by an Angel. There are some old shows I really enjoyed watching years ago such as I love Lucy, Dick Van Dyke, The Wild, Wild West, and my favorite movie and book of all time is Gone With the Wind.\n\nFiona: Favorite foods / Colors/ Music Seafood, blue, country and gospel\n\nFiona: If you were not a writer what else would you like to have done?\n\nTeach, and I did.\n\nFiona: Do you have a blog/website? If so what is it? http://barbarajrobinson.blogspot.com\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/B.-J.-Robinson/e/B007DNJIKU/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1413594127&sr=1-2-ent\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Author-BJ-Robinson/600635176683799"
