        "text": "Book Synopsis\n\nAmerica's favorite Christmas book by Barbara Robinson is now a major motion picture! This special movie tie-in edition of the beloved middle grade holiday story will feature cover art from the movie and is the perfect holiday gift. Lionsgate is releasing a live action movie version of The Best Christmas Pageant Ever on November 8, 2024, directed by Dallas Jenkins of The Chosen and featuring actors Judy Greer, Lauren Graham, Elizabeth Tabish, and Pete Holmes, coming to a theater near you!\n\nThe Herdmans are the worst kids in the history of the world. They lie, steal, and swear. So no one is prepared when this outlaw family invades church one Sunday and decides to take over the annual Christmas pageant. None of the Herdmans has ever heard the Christmas story before. Their interpretation of the tale--the Wise Men are a bunch of dirty spies--has a lot of people up in arms. And their wild antics cause havoc throughout the play's production. But the actual pageant is full of surprises for everyone, starting with the Herdmans themselves, as they ultimately lead the town in finding the true meaning of Christmas. They will make this year's pageant the most unusual anyone has seen and, just possibly, the best one ever.\n\nBarbara Robinson's popular and bestselling tale of the rowdy Herdmans has been beloved and celebrated since the book's original release in 1972. Read the book again before you see the movie!\n\nReview Quotes\n\n\"One of the best Christmas books ever.\" -- Publishers Weekly\n\n\"Wiry-tough, tender-hearted, unsentimental, and consistently funny.\" -- The London Sunday Times\n\n\"This charming story delivers a fresh perspective on the nativity and is a beautiful reminder that God loves everyone.\" -- Brightly\n\n\"Outrageous, lively, funny, and wonderful.
