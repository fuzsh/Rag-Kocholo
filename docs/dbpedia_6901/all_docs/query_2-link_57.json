        "text": "Mrs. Barbara Jean (Wilkins) Robinson was born on July 9th, 1939, in Starkville Mississippi. She was the only child of the late Mr. Thomas Wilkins and the late Thelma Wilkins. She departed this life on Tuesday, October 17th, 2023. She was preceded in death by her parents and her late husband Mr. George Clifton Robinson, Sr.\n\nHer family moved from Mississippi to the Chicago area when she was 4 years old. Barbara excelled in school, receiving multiple double promotions in elementary school. She graduated from Proviso East High School at the age of 16. She received a scholarship to the University of Michigan in 1956. She was an avid reader and participated in several book clubs.\n\nBarbara joined in holy matrimony to George Clifton Robinson, Sr. on June 20, 1957. To the union, three sons were born. They were married for 37 years until George’s passing on September 14, 1994. She confessed her faith in Christ at an early age and was a faithful member of Second Baptish church for over 70 years. She later moved to Georgia to be with her sons and worshiped at Shaw Temple AME Zion Church in Smyrna GA until her passing.\n\nBarbara was a loving mother, not only to her sons but to all the children in the community. She was active in many activities in Maywood and the surrounding area, including chaperoning the Young People’s choir at Second Baptist Church, the Maywood Little League, Memorial Park Spartans Football, St. Paul Lutheran School, Proviso East and Walther Lutheran Athletics to name a few. Her home was host to countless young adult friends of her sons. She also enjoyed socializing with her friends from the Crazy 12.\n\nBarbara was a faithful and diligent employee of the Veteran’s Administration for over 30 years. She retired from the VA but continued to work at Loyola Hospital for several years thereafter. She was beloved by her superiors and co-workers alike. Barbara also served on the Panel of American Women as well as the National Association of Negro Professional Women (NANBPW).\n\nBarbara was a very kind, compassionate and caring person. She exemplified the love of Christ detailed in 1 Corinthians 13:4-7. She was always patient, always kind. She did not envy, she did not boast, she was not proud (except of her sons). She did not dishonor others, she was not self-seeking, she was not easily angered, she kept no record of wrongs. She did not delight in evil but rejoiced in the truth. She always protected, always trusted, always hoped, always persevered. She could also be described as a Proverbs 31 woman, a woman of strength and virtue. She was hardworking, disciplined, and took care of her family. She was also someone who put others first and always strived to do her best in all areas of her life.\n\nBarbara leaves to cherish her precious memories her three sons, Mr. Thomas (Tammy) Robinson, Mr. George C. (Debby) Robinson, Jr. and Mr. Mark (Serene Bridgett) Robinson. 14 grandchildren, including William Tirrell Robinson (Kimberly) and Genice Robinson who were like her own children, 7 great grand-children, 1 great-great grand-child, her God-daughter Candice Carswell, and a host of nieces, nephews, other relatives and friends.\n\nA visitation for Barbara Jean Robinson will be held on Friday October 27, 2023 at Second Baptist Church 436 S 13th Ave, Maywood, IL 60153 at 10:00Am until Celebration of Life at 11am. Interment will follow at Oakridge Cemetery.\n\nStreaming Live on Facebook & YouTube\n\nYouTube\n\nhttps://youtube.com/@thesecondbaptistchurchofma9258?si=dZriXsj43HAJjZiZ\n\nFacebook\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/871512022905378/?ref=share&mibextid=NSMWBT"
