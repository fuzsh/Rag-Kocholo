She holds a Bachelor of Arts from the University of King’s College and a Master of Arts from Dalhousie University. Barbara enjoys writing poetry and romantic fiction, and is especially drawn to stories with paranormal elements. Her writing spans the sub-genres of light paranormal, magical realism, and historical romance, and each of her stories promises a happily ever after with a distinctly otherworldly flair. Barbara lives in Nova Scotia, Canada, with her husband Michael, two basset hounds and a small dragon."
