        "text": "Andrei Kirilenko officially announced his decision to retire. The Russian forward will likely run for Russian Basketball Federation Presidency.\n\n\"I decided to end my career. This is my final decision,\" Kirilenko told Sportexpress. \"Now I would love to change something in Russian basketball,\" added the Russian forward who returned to Europe after a second stint in the NBA with Timberwolves, Nets and 76ers.\n\nYou have to wonder how his career would be considered if he played in a slightly different era. Making his NBA debut in 2001, he spent 10 seasons with the Utah Jazz but missed out on the franchise's mid-to-late-90s glory. His game was before his time -- this was a skinny power forward with crazy length, athleticism and the ability to defend guards. Surely his younger self would thrive in today's game, and at 34 years old he'd still be a solid role player if injuries hadn't set him back. He should be remembered as an original."
