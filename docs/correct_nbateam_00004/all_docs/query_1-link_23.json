        "text": "Andrei Kirilenko is probably a top 10 all-time most beloved Jazz player ever right?\n\nStockton, Malone, Thurl, pre-blow-up Deron, Memo...AK is right there.\n\nHere are his top 5 plays as a Jazz man culminating with what I think is his best play ever.\n\n5 - The fake behind the back pass to Okur and dump off to Boozer\n\nThis is the second play they show in the clip below...\n\nKirilenko's passing ability in transition was unbelievable.\n\n4 - This is one of the coolest plays ever. Double behind the back passes...\n\nAnother awesome unselfish play from AK. I think he's maybe most known for his shot blocking ability, but his passing is a close second.\n\n3 - This is unfortunately one of the most famous Kirilenko plays\n\nHate to do it on a highlight reel for him, but this is the most famous \"Lowlight\" of his career. Nothing to be ashamed of it's just a really famous play.\n\nI loved this playoff season. Golden State was such a fun team to watch and the Jazz put an end to their Cinderella run, but this was the best play of the postseason and unfortunately AK was postered.\n\n2 - Here's an array of plays that showcase his passing ability, dunking, blocking\n\n1 - Blocking Kobe four times in 90 seconds\n\nLast one was called for a foul but who cares still counting it.\n\nA lot of people say that Kirilenko would have flourished even more in today's NBA because of how perimeter oriented it's become. But I don't know I think his game would fit in any era.\n\nLove it!"
