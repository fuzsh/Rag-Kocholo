        "text": "Doug Pensinger/Getty Images\n\nTalk about your second-coming.\n\nIt has been quite a while since the Utah Jazz have played up to their level of abilities.\n\nMost commonly, they play down to the Minnesotas and Sacramentos and up to the Clevelands and Kobe's squad.\n\nWhile the Jazz are arguably one of the deepest teams in the NBA, they suffered from some sort of mysterious ailment that no fan or journalist in their right mind could figure.\n\nUntil now.\n\nThe Jazz were suffering from underachieveism . It's a degenerate disease that eats away at the chemistry of a talented roster.\n\nMany teams have fallen victim to the illness. Some unable to be restored to their former status.\n\nAs of right now, the Jazz have kicked that flu-bug to the curb.\n\nGood thing, too.\n\nThey're back.\n\nSo, how did the Jazz avoid jumping the shark?\n\nNot too hard to find an answer. Quite simple, actually.\n\nLook no further than a gangly, wiry forward, who's currently sporting some sort of fifth-grade hairdo.\n\nAndrei Kirilenko is back.\n\nAnd so are his Jazz.\n\nAfter Utah's 116-106 win over rival Denver last week, Nuggets head coach George Karl said that's the best he'd seen Kirilenko since his All-Star run.\n\nAny basketball enthusiast could've told you that if they'd been paying any attention to the resurgent Jazz.\n\nAlso: The Jazz are currently on a eight-game winning streak and have catapulted themselves into sole possession of third place in the rough—and—tumble Western Conference.\n\nNow the revitalization in Utah hasn't been purely Kirilenko's return to form. It's a plethora of right things going in the right direction at the right time.\n\nThe Jazz bench is playing phenomenally, getting a double—digit output by one or more players each and every game.\n\nDefensively, Utah is more active than its been in....\n\n...Seriously, still thinking.\n\nWhen Carlos Boozer pulled up lame (surprise, surprise), Paul Millsap step in and cemented his contract that was matched this summer.\n\nMillsap's line as a two-game starter: 28.5 points, 11.5 rebounds and four assists per.\n\nWes Matthews, CJ Miles, Ronnie Brewer, Ronnie Price, and on and on and on have made quality contributions.\n\nNo need to have to mention Deron Williams. It's a given.\n\nWhich brings us back to Kirilenko. He was supposed to be the super-sub off a super bench at the disposal of coach Jerry Sloan.\n\nMiles and Matthews had their hands in the starter's pot. It worked. Then it didn't.\n\nThe Jazz needed a jumpstart. Who else but the most erratic, yet energetic player on the team?\n\nSloan said Kirilenko would start.\n\nAnd since then, off they went.\n\nDuring this crazy eight game streak, Utah is averaging a blistering 111.2 points per outing.\n\nRemember, two of those wins were minus Boozer. One minus Williams.\n\nKirilenko has been more than a breath of fresh air. He's been a guy that's accepted his role.\n\nAnd he's relishing. All he needed was a tiny push.\n\nHe's flown.\n\nDuring the streak, Kirilenko is 57-of-79 from the field. That's 72 percent from the field from a guy that has been in love with his jump shot for the past two seasons.\n\nThat is a stat worth admiring and contemplating.\n\nHow has Kirilenko been resuscitated?\n\nFor one, he's disrupting each and every passing lane. He's blocking shots. He's running without the ball. He's running with the ball. He's slashing. He's cutting.\n\nHe's dunking. He's shooting—effectively.\n\nHe's finally proving himself to be the quintessential X-Factor for a team that needs it more so than any other team in the league.\n\nKirilenko is Utah's Manu Ginobili.\n\nOn a team that is so disciplined, introducing a little anarchy is a perfection in and of itself.\n\nTrying to figure out what is circling around in the brain of Kirilenko on the court is something most opponents wish they knew.\n\nNo one really does.\n\nHe's just out there, using his superior athleticism, court vision, and tads of unforeseen magic to lift his team.\n\nAnd what a turn around it has been.\n\nA few years ago, Kirilenko broke down into tears during a off-day shootaround in Houston. He wasn't helping his team. He wanted to, more than anything.\n\nKirilenko and Sloan are polar opposites.\n\nSloan is all business, all the time. Winning is the bottomline.\n\nKirilenko is, at times, a bit more fragile, knowing that if he can be possessed by a boatload of energy and confidence, he can do anything.\n\nUnfortunately, the All-Star break, generally a sigh of relief for NBA'ers who need a break from it all, is in sight and preparing to mess with the mojo they've got going on in Utah right now.\n\nTo be frank, that really doesn't matter. Not if they have Kirilenko back to the days of AK-47.\n\nThe Jazz will go as far as Kirilenko can take them. Not Williams, not Boozer, not Millsap.\n\nAndrei Kirilenko is the ace in the hole. You never know what you'll get out of him on a daily basis.\n\nAs long as Utah finds belief in his convictions and mettle, they're going to be that team that no one wants to play come June."
