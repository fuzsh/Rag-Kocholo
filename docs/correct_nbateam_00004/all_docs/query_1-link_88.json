        "meta_description": "Andrei Gennadyevich Kirilenko (Russian: Андрей Геннадьевич Кириленко; born February 18, 1981) is a Russian-American professional basketball player who currently plays for the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). At age fifteen, Kirilenko began playing professional basketball in his native Russia with the Russian Basketball Super League. He spent another three years with CSKA Moscow, winning the Russian league MVP award in 2000.\n\tIn 2001, Kirilenko joined the Utah Jazz, who drafted him in 1999. He became the first Russian player selected in the first round of a draft and the youngest European player drafted. He made the NBA All-Rookie First Team after his first season, was an NBA All-Defensive Team pick three times and played in the 2004 All-Star Game. In 2012, he led CSKA Moscow to the Euroleague Final, being named the competition's MVP, while earning an All-Euroleague first team selection. He also won the Euroleague Defensive Player of the Year award the same year.\n\t\n\tSince the 2000 Summer Olympics, Kirilenko has been a regular member of the Russian national team. With Russia, he won the EuroBasket title in 2007, earning MVP honors in the process. In 2011, he won his second EuroBasket medal, this time the bronze. He was selected to the All-Tournament Team on both occasions.\n\tKirilenko is nicknamed &quot;AK-47&quot;, in reference to both his initials and jersey number, and the AK-47 rifle. Coincidentally, Kirilenko was born in the city of Izhevsk, in the former Soviet Union (now Russia), where the weapon was first manufactured. In January 2011, he became an American citizen.\n\t\n\t<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Kirilenko\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Kirilenko</a>\n\t\n\t<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...</a>",
