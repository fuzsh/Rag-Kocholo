        "text": "Kirilenko still lacks the firepower of the future Hall of Famers but the fifth-year National Basketball Association (NBA) forward from Russia is making the rebuilding of the franchise a lot less painful.\n\n\"He does a lot of things,\" Washington Wizards coach Eddie Jordan said after watching the six-foot nine-inch (2.06-metre) Kirilenko help the visiting Jazz to dismantle the Wizards 97 89.\n\n\"He cuts hard, drives hard, rebounds both ends. He plays great defense, mostly blocking shots, coming from the weak side. He's tough.\"\n\nNBA\n\nAllt-time NBA top draft picks\n\n27/06/2006 at 08:31\n\nBASKETBALL 2005-2006 NBA Utah-Toronto Kirilenko\n\nImage credit: Reuters\n\nThe game was vintage Kirilenko. He scored 17 points, had seven rebounds and four assists while making the Wizards chase him around the floor.\n\nKirilenko is one of those players who frustrates opposing teams by doing everything well. However, he is not yet great at any one aspect of the game.\n\nHe is averaging 15.3 points a game, 8.3 rebounds, 2.91 blocks (third in the league) and, perhaps most telling of his unselfish nature, a team-leading 4.6 assists.\n\n\"He's progressed a great deal,\" Jazz Coach Jerry Sloan told Reuters. \"The biggest thing was understanding what we're doing. He's a lively guy. A little wild sometimes.\n\n\"But he's becoming more under control, doing more things that really help his team mates.\"\n\nINJURY LIST\n\nThe lanky yet agile Kirilenko has endured a broken nose, a broken wrist and knee problems. The list goes on.\n\n\"When you get injured and you're losing a month of games and a month of practices it gets you out of your conditioning,\" Kirilenko told Reuters. \"After an injury it usually takes a couple of weeks to get back. At least. To be injured is bad.\n\n\"I've had tons of injuries. Right now I'm just happy to get back.\"\n\nAfter missing several games with a bad back, Kirilenko's return has sparked the Jazz to their best run of the season. Utah (21-21) has won 10 of its last 15 and trails front running Denver by 2-1/2 games in the Northwest Division.\n\nEarlier this month, Kirilenko notched up the third so-called five-by-five of his career, with 14 points, eight rebounds, nine assists, seven blocks and six steals in a win over the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nHe is one of just four players in the last 12 years to manage the feat.\n\nTwo weeks later, he had his first triple-double with 18 points, 16 rebounds and 11 assists during a victory over the Toronto Raptors.\n\nFor the 24-year-old Kirilenko, drafted by the Jazz in the first round of the 1999 NBA Draft, personal numbers are satisfying but winning is electrifying.\n\n\"I've always said that I'm a team player and that I don't care about my own stats,\" said the affable Kirilenko, dubbed AK-47 by his team mates after the Russian assault rifle.\n\n\"I don't really care as long as we have a 'W.' If we win the game, I don't give a damn.\n\nUNBRIDLED PASSION\n\nKirilenko, who has been playing basketball since he was seven years old, grew up watching Chicago Bulls superstar Michael Jordan, whom he calls \"the player of the century\".\n\nHe sometimes has a tough time believing that he is now part of the NBA. Kirilenko is trying to get stronger to better cope with the nightly pounding.\n\nRunning the floor with unbridled passion has its drawbacks, however -- he cannot gain weight.\n\n\"Some people think I can be a little stronger,\" he said. \"Maybe. And this summer I tried to work hard but when I start running, everything goes off. I don't know where.\n\n\"Because of the way I play, it's so energetic, lots of motion, lots of running, defense, offense. It's hard to stay in the same weight condition.\"\n\nKirilenko said he was fortunate to arrive in Utah while Malone and Stockton were still playing.\n\n\"They helped me a lot when I was young,\" he said. \"Not just advice. But the things they'd do on the floor and off the floor, how they prepare themselves before the game, what they do on the court -- that's worth a lot.\n\n\"I think I'm kind of lucky at this point because I had a chance to play with them, learn a little bit. And then when they left we have a young team. I have a chance to prove a lot.\"\n\nSloan agrees, even if he had to admonish Kirilenko earlier this season for his undisciplined play. The coach, however, did not want to dim his star pupil's enthusiasm.\n\n\"He's a hustle player, he's a guy that rebounds, he blocks shots, he defends, he gets steals, he makes passes -- all of those things are important to winning,\" he said.\n\n\"When he's doing it, we're a pretty good basketball team.\"\n\nNBA\n\nBargnani could be first European top pick\n\n27/06/2006 at 08:21\n\nNBA\n\nNesterovic traded to Raptors\n\n22/06/2006 at 08:43"
