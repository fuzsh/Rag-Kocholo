The 8,100-square-feet home has views of Great Salt Lake and enough room to park a boat or RV. It sits on .72 acres and was built in 1995. It has five bedrooms, high-end appliances throughout and soaring two-story ceilings in the entryway. The lower level has sliding glass doors opening on to a park-like setting yard with a pool. The property is located in the exclusive Arlington Hill subdivision, with views not just of the lake but also of downtown Salt Lake City and the mountains."
