        "text": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Andrei Kirilenko feels he is close to a contract extension with the Utah Jazz and hopes to have it finalized within the next few days. <br/><br/>The Jazz and Kirilenko have until\n\nBy: News On 6\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Andrei Kirilenko feels he is close to a contract extension with the Utah Jazz and hopes to have it finalized within the next few days.\n\nThe Jazz and Kirilenko have until Oct. 31 to agree on an extension for Kirilenko, who is in the fourth-year option of his original contract. If no deal is reached, the All-Star forward will be a restricted free agent at the end of the season _ something both sides are trying to avoid.\n\n``I think we're almost done. I think (in the) next few more days everything will be done,'' Kirilenko said Friday before the Jazz's preseason game against Sacramento. ``I want to be part of this organization forever _ for my career.''\n\nKirilenko is hoping for the maximum 6-year, $86 million deal, but would not discuss details in the contract or what the holdup has been. He said he and the Jazz are more than 90 percent finished with the negotiations.\n\nKirilenko's agent, Mark Fleischer, said Friday night that negotiations were still going.\n\n``We're not done. That's all I can tell you,'' Fleischer said. ``There's only nine days left so I'm hopeful we can get it done in time.''\n\nKevin O'Connor, Utah's vice president for basketball operations, said no deal has been reached.\n\n``We've talked and the thing's gone back and forth, but we have no deal,'' O'Connor said. ``Obviously time is becoming a little bit short now.''"
