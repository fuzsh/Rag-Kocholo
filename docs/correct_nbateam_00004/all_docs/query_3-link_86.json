        "text": "PHILADELPHIA — The 76ers have suspended forward Andrei Kirilenko for not reporting to the team after his trade from the Brooklyn Nets last month.\n\nCoach Brett Brown confirmed the suspension during a shootaround before Friday night’s game in Brooklyn. He says he had been looking forward to coaching Kirilenko.\n\nIt’s not clear why Kirilenko hasn’t joined the Sixers since the Dec. 11 trade. The deal sent forward Brandon Davies to the Nets for Kirilenko, a second-round pick in the 2020 draft, guard Jorge Gutierrez and cash.\n\nKirilenko hasn’t played since Nov. 13 and has played sparingly in seven games this season. He has cited family matters as part of the reason for his absence.\n\nBrown said he had coffee with Kirilenko after the trade, and wouldn’t have done that had he thought Kirilenko would not be part of the team."
