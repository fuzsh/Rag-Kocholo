        "text": "Andrei Vatutin, PBC CSKA President:\n\nI think that Andrey’s long-awaited decision is the best New Year gift for all CSKA and Russian fans they could imagine. It’s great that we will meet the New Year with such good news. AK-47 did not just proved that he is the important chain of our team, tremendously valuable, dedicated player. He showed that he is a true patriot, a man who does not look for quick benefits, who tries to please basketball fans all over the country, to raise our favorite sport popularity. I am glad to know that the decision was taken by Andrey in best of interests of CSKA team, it is very important for all of us.\n\nOur club was always following “All for one and one for all” principle. I know that Kirilenko had a number of options to leave, and every option had its own value – in means of finances, life conditions, possibilities to win in the NBA. Therefore Andrey’s decision is even more valuable for us.\n\nAndrey Kirilenko, CSKA forward:\n\nDuring this month I considered different options, weighting out all pros and contras, and I came to the conclusion that I should finish this season with CSKA. We developed great team chemistry, the real team in the first part of the season. It would be incorrect to stop halfway. It would be unfair toward my teammates and, more importantly, toward fans. I know how many people count on me.\n\nTo play for CSKA is a great pleasure and fun, and I will do my best to win all the tournaments we are participating in. I am thankful to club’s management for patience in my difficult situation. Thank you very much to all the fans for their support! Come to our games to cheer for CSKA!"
