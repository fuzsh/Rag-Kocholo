        "text": "By Antonis Stroggylakis/ info@eurohoops.net\n\nDuring the game against the L.A. Lakers, the Utah Jazz decided to honor the one and only “AK47”. Commonly known to both friend and foe as Andrei Kirilenko.\n\nFrom his very first season in Salt Lake City, the Russian superstar had given the NBA a sign of things to come, when he made the All Rookie First Team after averaging 10.7 points, 5 rebounds and 2 blocks per game. He spent the halcyon days of his rich career with the Jazz, for 10 years, between 2001 and 2011.\n\nDuring that period he was chosen as an All Star (2004) and member of the All Defensive First Team (2006) once, while he was named member of the All Defensive Second Team, twice (2004 and 2005).\n\nNow, if you believe in strange coincidences, here’s what happened in a specific moment of the game between the Utah Jazz and the L.A. Lakers. Perhaps some basketball planets aligned to create that image on the boxscore.\n\nEarlier, he was officially honored by the team. It comes as small surprise that the Jazz consider him as one of their own. And how could they do otherwise?\n\nThe people of the club decided that with Andrei Kirilenko in Salt Lake City, here lies a good chance for him to answer some fan questions in a twitter Q&A. When asked about which players is closer to his style, “AK47” chose Giannis Antetokounmpo. To none’s amazement.\n\nBut Kirilenko has been also experienced with the “wheres” and “hows” of Euroleague. His opinion on Nando De Colo? Why to put it simply “the best player in Euroleague right now”."
