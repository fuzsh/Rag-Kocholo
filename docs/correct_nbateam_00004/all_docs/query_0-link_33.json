        "text": "Hansbrough, who may move to the bench this season, is fine with that. He’s actually embracing it with open arms. The Pacers met with free agent Nene on Tuesday, had a phone conversation with David West and inquired about Andrei Kirilenko. They’re also interested in former Purdue standout Carl Landry. “That’s what I’m about, winning,” he said at Conseco Fieldhouse today. “So whoever they feel like can help us win ball games is who I want on the team. If we get a good power forward, which is where we need help at, I’m wiling to compete and do my role to win.”\n\nA power player is the Nets’ focus. They have made their calls to free-agent threes, including Tayshaun Prince, Andrei Kirilenko (whom owner Mikhail Prokhorov in 2007 tried to entice back to Russia from Utah), Grant Hill, Caron Butler (with knee injury reservations, but he is expected to meet with team brass this week, possibly Wednesday) and Boki Nachbar."
