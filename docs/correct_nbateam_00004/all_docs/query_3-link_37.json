        "text": "They'd prefer the Sixers waive or buy out Kirilenko, so he'd be paid the remainder of his $3.3 million salary and become a free agent immediately.\n\nHowever, Sixers GM Sam Hinkie told Kirilenko and his camp that the Sixers have no plans to buy him out, so they're asking him to report to Philadelphia to get in shape and get ready to play, Yahoo reports.\n\nIt's turning into a bit of an awkward stalemate. According to Wojnarowski, the Sixers have said they'd be accommodating to Kirilenko's family issue and they believe Philadelphia's proximity to New York allows them to help him. Kirilenko, meanwhile, seemingly has no interest in playing for a lottery-bound team, and as a free agent this summer, he probably doesn't want to risk injury in meaningless games.\n\nIf the situation becomes dire enough, Philadelphia can actually mandate that Kirilenko come play for them.\n\nAccording to Wojnarowski, the Sixers probably have little interest in keeping Kirilenko past the trade deadline, but by getting him to play, it could possibly increase his trade value, thus making him an asset for the 76ers to use.\n\nKirilenko hasn't played since November 13."
