        "text": "But Buzelis, who, at just 19, flashes an awareness beyond his years, doesn’t limit himself to the offensive end. He cited former Utah Jazz Andrei Kirilenko for his shotblocking ability and defensive prowess. It’s clear that becoming a two-way player is important for Buzelis. “My rookie year, I’m not going to have any plays ran for me,” he said on the podcast. “So I have to go play defense and be an energy guy and make open shots.”\n\nShams Charania: Potential top-5 NBA pick Matas Buzelis sits down with @Stadium: “I respect Zach (Risacher) as a player…He just doesn’t want to see me. I’m just going to keep it real with everybody.” On “disrespect” of Ignite shutdown; Franz Wagner, PG, Andrei Kirilenko, Jaden McDaniels; more: pic.twitter.com/nZpLsoCkVp\n\nHis physical attributes set him apart from his peers. “I measured at 6’8″. … But I don’t really get why you don’t measure with shoes on. You play with shoes on. … But I am really 6’10”, I can say that with confidence. Wingspan, 6’10”. Weight 205 lbs,” he said. Buzelis sees several NBA comparisons for his game. “Franz Wagner, Andrei Kirilenko, Paul George, Tracy McGrady, Joe Johnson, Michael Beasley,” he listed, elaborating on Wagner: “Just the versatility of his game. His height, too. He can bring the ball up. He does a lot of things on the court. Watching him brings more out of me, of what I could be in the NBA.”\n\nAndrei Kirilenko: 'In the NBA, basketball is still wrong'\n\nCarrying plenty of experience from both ends of the comparison between the Turkish Airlines EuroLeague and the NBA, Andrei Kirilenko voted in favor of Europe’s premier club continental competition. “You should watch, it is great basketball,” he told Russian outlet Okko Sport on the EuroLeague, “Especially if you love proper basketball. In the NBA, basketball is still wrong, in my opinion. It is more about individuals. Basketball in Europe is traditional with more team plays and tactics, players knowing what to do on the court in each situation.”\n\nThe FIBA Central Board has announced the continuation of the mandate of Kirilenko as well as fellow co-opted members Richard Carrión of Puerto Rico and Erick Thohir of Indonesia, both members of the International Olympic Committee. But the International Federation revealed that the decision on Kirilenko would “take effect subject to the decisions of the International Olympic Committee and FIBA in relation to the war in Ukraine”.\n\nMorten Stig Jensen: This is one hell of an insulting quote by Andrei Kirilenko if you’re a basketball player. “I understand the situation, “mentioned Kirilenko referring to the ongoing war in Ukraine, the result of the invasion of Russia, “I am sure players don’t follow politics nor are interested in politics. But nowadays everyone is an expert. We are all experts in viruses and the next day in politics. I don’t know anything about politics. I know about basketball. That’s where I can help.”"
