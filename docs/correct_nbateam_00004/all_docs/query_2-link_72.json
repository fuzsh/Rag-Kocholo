        "text": "Blatt is a proud American, but sees the world and the game with a far more discerning, critical eye. Whenever Russia is finished in these worlds, Blatt told Yahoo! Sports he will resign as the national coach. Six years ago, Blatt, one of Europe’s most accomplished coaches, was hired to push Russian basketball beyond a cold-war militaristic mindset of coaching that had too grudgingly evolved despite the Westernization of its players. They were millionaires now, and no one embodied that transformation of the country’s basketball player than its biggest star, the temperamental Utah Jazz diva, Andrei Kirilenko. “He’s a max contract player in the NBA, making $80 million, and that changed everything for the Russian player,” Blatt said. “Andrei brought Russian basketball to the world stage and in a user-friendly way. Andrei was a friendly Drago. He had an athleticism, a skill, of a player that people were used to seeing from an American player.\n\nAndrei Kirilenko told Russia’s Sport Express newspaper that he will not play at this summer’s FIBA world championships. The Jazz had been hoping Kirilenko would decide as much, given his struggles with a strained calf at the end of last season. O’Connor noted how pleased the Jazz were with Kirilenko’s weight and conditioning when he arrived for training camp last fall after a summer in which he skipped the European championships. “We expect him to have a really big-time year this year,” said O’Connor, with Kirilenko entering the last year of his contract. “I think changing [the roster] around a little bit, I think it’s going to really help him.”\n\nJazz forward Andrei Kirilenko has decided not to play for his native Russia at the FIBA World Championships, which begin late next month in Turkey. The Jazz had been hoping Kirilenko, star of the Russian national team, wouldn’t play due to the strained calf muscle that caused him to miss multiple games late last season and in the NBA playoffs. Kirilenko told a Russian newspaper, Sport Express, of his plans.\n\nMore likely, Stoudemire will have left with no return, other than salary-cap and tax relief, although the Suns could do sign-and-trades and get a $17 million trade exception from New York. That exception could be used over the next year to acquire a player making a similar or less expensive salary, without the Suns losing players. The Suns have considered that with the possibility of a midseason deal for a player such as Utah’s Andrei Kirilenko.\n\nThe Russian newspaper Sovetskii Sport reported that Kirilenko might not play, and according to the Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti the 29-year-old “will probably follow the (Jazz)’s advice in order not to spoil relations with the management in view of a new contract.” Kirilenko, who led Russia to a surprise EuroBasket title in 2007 and carried Russia’s flag at the 2008 Olympics in China, is on vacation in France and could not be reached for comment. His contract with the Jazz, which pays $17.8 million next season, expires next summer.\n\nRIA Novosti also reported that the Russian Basketball Federation “confirmed earlier that it is ready to provide Utah Jazz the necessary amount (of insurance) for Kirilenko, who according to RBF is willing to compete” when the FIBA tournament opens next month in Turkey. As long as insurance is provided, NBA teams — as part of an agreement with FIBA, basketball’s international governing body — cannot prevent their players from taking part in international events. A Russian basketball reporter, Alexander Chernykh, who writes for the Russian website sports.ru, tweeted Tuesday that while “Utah presses Kirilenko to miss the World Championship” … “Andrei wants to play.”\n\nThe Jazz don’t want Kirilenko to play because of the calf strain he sustained late last season. Kirilenko missed 15 of Utah’s final 17 games of the regular season after sustaining muscle strains and re-strains three different times in three different areas of the same calf. He also missed all of the Jazz’s first-round playoff series against the Denver Nuggets, and the first two games of their second-round series with the eventual NBA-champion Los Angeles Lakers. “He unquestionably, if there was no other of these injuries, wants to play with his national team,” Fleisher said. But the calf situation, Fleisher said, “will be a significant factor” in Kirilenko’s decision."
