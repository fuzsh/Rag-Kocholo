        "text": "AMERICAN BASKETBALL That's the tune of a 6-year, US$86 million contract extension for the Russian who led Utah with a 16.2 scoring average last season\n\nAP\n\nAndrei Kirilenko signed a 6-year, US$86 million contract extension with the Utah Jazz, a deal that took three months of negotiations.\n\n\"This is the team which I love and is where I want to stay for the rest of my career,\" Kirilenko said Friday. \"It's pretty nice to be a part of this team -- of a family actually. It's my family for the next seven years.\"\n\nThe fourth-year All-Star forward from Russia has been with the team longer than any other current player. The extension kicks in next season and is for the maximum amount allowed under the NBA's collective bargaining agreement.\n\nIt completed a long summer for vice president for basketball operations Kevin O'Connor, who added restricted free agents Carlos Boozer and Mehmet Okur to the Jazz in July.\n\nWith the 23-year-old Kirilenko, the 22-year-old Boozer and the 25-year-old Okur, Utah appears set in the frontcourt for several years.\n\n\"We're trying to make a very, very, eloquent loud statement to this market that the Jazz not only are here, we're not just tagalongs,\" Jazz owner Larry Miller said. \"We've been as competitive a team as there is in the league.\"\n\nThe deal was completed Thursday while Kirilenko and the Jazz were in New York for the final preseason game. O'Connor and agent Marc Fleischer, who also worked out the deals for Okur and shooting guard Gordan Giricek in the offseason, finally agreed on the terms.\n\nKirilenko is in the fourth-year option of his rookie contract. If he had not signed the extension before the Oct. 31 deadline, he would have become a restricted free agent at the end of the season.\n\nKirilenko may have had a chance at an even bigger deal, but also could have been injured. Neither side wanted to risk it and the Jazz finally agreed to the maximum deal.\n\n\"Andrei got a little frustrated, but it was his first time going through this, so it's completely understandable,\" Fleischer said. \"It's a good move for Andrei because I think it's a great place for him to be. I can't think of a guy on your team to build around that's any better.\"\n\nKirilenko led the Jazz in scoring last year with a 16.2 average. He also led the Jazz in rebounds (8.1), blocked shots (2.76) and steals (1.92). Twice last season Kirilenko recorded at least five in all of the positive statistics -- points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks.\n\nThe Jazz selected Kirilenko in the opening round of the 1999 draft with the 24th overall pick, but he stayed two more years in Russia before coming to Utah for his rookie season in 2001.\n\nKirilenko said he learned a lot from former Jazz greats John Stockton and Karl Malone in his two seasons. He also knows now that the Stockton-Malone era is over and he's the highest paid player on the Jazz, it's unofficially his team.\n\n\"What they've done for the Jazz is legendary,\" said Kirilenko, whose English is still coming along. \"I want to do [it] the same way. I want to be this kind of guy.\"\n\nSPURS 102, HORNETS 86\n\nTim Duncan scored 17 points to lead the San Antonio Spurs over the New Orleans Hornets 102-86 Friday.\n\nTony Parker added 16 points for San Antonio, and newly acquired Brent Barry scored 14.\n\nBarry, who left Seattle as a free agent after last season, was 5-of-6 from the field and 4-of-5 from 3-point range. Reserve Tony Massenburg scored 12 points in 14 minutes.\n\nBaron Davis led the Hornets (3-5) with 21 points, and Chris Anderson had nine rebounds in 25 minutes.\n\nSan Antonio (4-3) broke the game open in the third quarter, outscoring New Orleans 36-24 to take an 80-64 lead.\n\nRaptors 100, Cavaliers 92\n\nIn Toronto, Vince Carter scored 20 points as Toronto beat Cleveland.\n\nRobert Traylor had 30 points and 11 rebounds for the Cavaliers (6-2), who host Indiana on Wednesday night in their season opener.\n\nDonyell Marshall added 16 points and 10 rebounds for the Raptors (2-5).\n\nCarter missed Toronto's two previous preseason games to deal with a lawsuit filed by a former agent. Carter is expected to return to Columbia, South Carolina, for the trial on Monday, but will be back for Toronto's season opener at home against Houston on Wednesday night.\n\nNuggets 98, Pacers 79\n\nIn Indianapolis, Indiana guard Reggie Miller broke a bone in his left hand in the Pacers' loss to Denver.\n\nMiller left the game in the first quarter, clutching his non-shooting hand. He will be examined Saturday to determine the extent of the injury.\n\nBrazilian-born player, Nene, had 17 points and four rebounds for Denver. Earlier in the day, the Nuggets said they picked up his US$3.04 million option for next season.\n\nRon Artest led the Pacers with 24 points, seven rebounds and three steals.\n\nTimberwolves 102, Pistons 95\n\nIn Minneapolis, Kevin Garnett had 22 points and nine rebounds to lead Minnesota over Detroit\n\nTroy Hudson, in his first game action since March 29, sparked Minnesota with nine second-half points. The Timberwolves' backup point guard is recovering from offseason surgery on his right ankle.\n\nFred Hoiberg and Eddie Griffin added 15 points each for Minnesota (4-4), which starts the regular season Wednesday night at home against New York.\n\nRichard Hamilton had 21 points and nine assists for Detroit (3-5), which had 24 turnovers.\n\nSuns 124, Kings 96\n\nIn Sacramento, California, Joe Johnson had 21 points, seven rebounds and seven assists to help Phoenix beat Sacramento.\n\nThe Suns had a 28-point lead at halftime and the Kings never cut the lead below 20 points in the second half.\n\nAmare Stoudemire had 19 points and seven rebounds for Phoenix. Shawn Marion had 18 points and eight rebounds, Quentin Richardson made five 3-pointers and scored 18 points.\n\nSteve Nash added 11 points and eight assists.\n\nPeja Stojakovic hit five 3-pointers and scored 21 points for the Kings. Darius Songaila scored 15 points, while Matt Barnes and Mike Bibby had 12 points apiece.\n\nSuperSonics 91, Trail Blazers 87\n\nIn Seattle, Ray Allen scored 32 points, including a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 24.6 seconds left, as Seattle beat Portland.\n\nAllen, who missed the previous two games with a sore back, scored 17 points in the fourth quarter and had eight of Seattle's last nine.\n\nPortland (4-4) had only eight healthy players in uniform -- Theo Ratliff, Derek Anderson and Nick Van Exel stayed home for the final preseason game.\n\nRuben Patterson had 22 points and six rebounds for the Blazers, and Darius Miles scored 14 of his 16 points in the first half. Zach Randolph added 14 points and nine rebounds.\n\nLuke Ridnour had 14 points and six assists for Seattle (2-6), and Reggie Evans scored 13 points.\n\nForward Qyntel Woods, already suspended by the Portland Trail Blazers following allegations of dog fighting, has been suspended without pay for five games by the NBA for violating the league's drug policy.\n\nThe NBA suspension announced Friday starts with Wednesday night's season opener at Golden State.\n\nThe league and its players' association do not reveal details about drug testing.\n\nThe Trail Blazers suspended Woods without pay during the preseason after a television news report linked him to dog fighting. Sheriff's deputies and Oregon Humane Society officials have twice searched his Lake Oswego home for evidence.\n\nNo criminal charges have been brought in the case."
