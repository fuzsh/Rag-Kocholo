        "text": "SALT LAKE CITY -- The Utah Jazz are rumored to be involved in a four-team trade to send Carmelo Anthony of the Denver Nuggets to the New Jersey Nets. The trade would involve sending veteran Jazz forward Andrei Kirilenko to the division rival Nuggets. In return, the Jazz would receive forward Boris Diaw from the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nRelated:\n\nESPN.com reported Friday that the four teams are \"seriously engaged\" in talks about a trade taking place. However, the Nets have said that they will not go through with the trade unless Anthony is willing to sign a contract extension with the Nets.\n\nThe details of the trade involve sending Carmelo Anthony to the Nets, with Denver receiving Kirilenko, rookie Derrick Favors and multiple first-round draft picks. The Bobcats receive Devin Harris, with the Jazz receiving Diaw in return.\n\nEarlier this summer, the Nuggets offered Anthony a three-year extension worth $65 million. Anthony has yet to sign the deal and plans to leave his options open, especially since he has an opportunity to become a free agent next summer.\n\nEarly rumors indicated that Anthony was looking to be traded to the New York Knicks or Chicago Bulls. If the trade is to occur, the Jazz would be in a better payroll situation for the 2010-2011 season, giving the team approximately $8.8 million in salary relief. Kirilenko is in the last year of his contract, paying out $17.8 million this season. Diaw's contract calls for $9 million this season; he also has a $9 million option for the 2011-12 season.\n\nKirilenko told KSL he does not want to be traded and wants to stay with the Utah Jazz. His agent, Marc Fleisher told the Deseret News he hasn't heard of any trades taking place.\n\nSince joining the NBA in 2003, Diaw has played for Phoenix and Atlanta, averaging 9.6 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.0 assists in seven seasons."
