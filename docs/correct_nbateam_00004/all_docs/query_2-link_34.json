        "text": "Biography[]\n\nAndrei Kirilenko (Russian: Андрей Кириле́нко; born February 18, 1981) is a forward currently playing for the Utah Jazz in the NBA. He is 206 cm tall and weighs 102 kg (6'9\", 225 lb).\n\nOn January 18, 1997, Andrei Kirilenko became the youngest player ever to compete in the Russian Superleague, scoring three points for his hometown Spartak Saint Petersburg against Spartak Moscow. After spending two seasons with Spartak Saint Petersburg, he joined CSKA Moscow in 1998. In his first season, he helped his new team win the Russian Superleague championship. He was also selected to participate in the Russian All-Star game, helping the West beat the East 138-107 and winning the slam dunk contest.\n\nOn June 30, 1999, at 18 years, 4 months, and 12 days, Kirilenko became the youngest European player at the time to be drafted in the National Basketball Association, when the Utah Jazz selected him with the 24th pick. However, he remained with CSKA Moscow for the next two seasons. In the 1999-2000 season, he helped his team win the inaugural championship of the Northern European Basketball League and its second Russian Superleague championship in a row. On April 23, 2000, he participated in his second Russian All-Star game, helping the West beat the East 122-111. Despite being the odds-on favorite to win the slam dunk contest, he finished second to Harold Dean of Lokomotiv Mineralnye Vody.\n\nAndrei Kirilenko participated in the 2000 Summer Olympics as a member of the Russian national basketball team, which finished 8th in the tournament. On February 8, 2001, in his third season with CSKA Moscow, Kirilenko became the second player ever in the history of the Euroleague to record a triple-double with 13 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 steals against Lietuvos Rytas. He showed off his all-around skills in the European Championships, finishing in top ten in 7 out of 8 statistical categories.\n\nKirilenko joined the Utah Jazz in the 2001-02 NBA season. He was named to the first team on the NBA All-Rookie team. He has since emerged as one of the top young players in the NBA, and one of the league's top weak side defenders. He was selected to play as a reserve in the 2004 NBA All-Star Game in Los Angeles. In the 2003-04 NBA season, he ranked third in the league in blocked shots per game and fourth in the league in steals per game, becoming just the second player in NBA history to rank in the top five in both categories (David Robinson ranked first in blocked shots per game and fifth in steals per game in the 1991-92 NBA season). During the NBA offseason, Kirilenko plays for the Russian national basketball team.\n\nKirilenko became the leader of the Jazz in 2003 after John Stockton retired and Karl Malone left Utah to join the Los Angeles Lakers. He played and started in 78 of the Utah's 82 games and lead them to a 42-40 record. Utah missed the playoffs by one game behind the Denver Nuggets. He finished fifth in Defensive Player of the Year voting and fourth in Most Improved Player voting and was named to the second team on the All-NBA Defensive Team. Kirilenko lead the Jazz in many [seasonal] statistical categories:\n\ntotal points with 1284\n\npoints per game with 16.5\n\ntotal rebounds with 629\n\nrebounds per game with 8.1\n\nblocks with 215\n\nblocks per game with 2.8\n\nsteals with 150\n\nsteals per game with 1.9\n\nfree throws made with 392\n\nfree throws attempted with 496\n\nthree-pointers made with 68\n\nthree-pointers attempted with 201\n\nIn the middle of the 2004-05 NBA season against the Washington Wizards, Kirilenko sustained a broken right wrist, sidelining him for the remainder of the season. Despite only playing in 41 of the Jazz' 82 games, he amassed enough blocked shots during the season to qualify as the league leader in blocks per game, and was named to the second team on the NBA All-Defensive Team.\n\nIn the 2005-06 NBA season Kirilenko was again among the league best shotblockers and defenders. He recorded a career high 10 blocks against Indiana on March 26 and finished first in the league with total blocks (220) and second in blocks per game with 3.2, just behind league leader Marcus Camby at 3.3. He was named to the first team on the NBA All-Defensive Team.\n\nIn close games, Kirilenko proved that his defense can win games, deflecting or blocking the potential game winning shot or lay-up. Kirilenko recently moved to the two-guard, or 'shooting guard' position, when Jerry Sloan opted to go with a larger lineup, giving Andrei more freedom with the ball in his hands, and utilizing his perimeter offensive skill set. Many experts feel that Kirilenko is only improving, considering he is still just 25 years of age. He is also a top fantasy basketball player due to his contributions to many statistics.\n\nKirilenko averaged 15.3 points, 8 rebounds, 1.5 steals, 3.2 blocks and 4.3 assists per game in the 2005-2006 season. For his NBA career, he averages 13.8 points, 6.5 rebounds, 1.6 steals, 2.6 blocks, and 2.6 assists per game.\n\nPlayer Profile[]\n\nKirilenko is a versatile \"big man\" who can play either forward spot. He is good in both offense (13.8 points and 6.5 assists per game career averages) and defense. On offense, he is proficient in drawing fouls, passing, and possesses a quick first step. He is lauded for his defense, as of 2006 three times selected into the NBA All-Defensive Team or Second Team. Staples of Kirilenko's defensive power are his shot blocking, averaging 3.32 and 3.19 swats per game in the last two seasons, and his ball-hawking (1.58 career averages in steals).\n\nHis versatility is best shown in one of his most remarkable games. On January 3, 2006, against the Los Angeles Lakers, Kirilenko posted an amazing statline of 14 points, 8 rebounds, 9 assists, 6 steals, and 7 blocks. This was the third time in his career he racked up at least 5 in all of the other relevant categories. Arguably, his statline is one of the closest performances to a quintuple double in NBA history. It was also the first-ever regulation \"5×6\" — a game in which a player registers at least 6 points, 6 rebounds, 6 assists, 6 blocks, and 6 steals — since the NBA began recording blocks and steals in the 1973-74 season. In 1987, Hakeem Olajuwon had 38 points, 17 rebounds, 12 blocks, 7 steals, and 6 assists for the Houston Rockets in a double-overtime win over the Seattle Supersonics, the only other time a player has earned a 5×6.\n\nThe downside of Kirilenko's game is that he is also somewhat injury-prone (in the last two seasons, he appeared in just 110 of 164 possible regular season games) and his jump shot is a bit stiff. Nevertheless, Kirilenko is currently considered one of the best forwards in the NBA, especially on defense.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nKirilenko wears uniform #47 and is thus nicknamed AK-47 after the ubiquitous Russian rifle. The infamous weapon was designed in his birthplace, the city of Izhevsk.\n\nRecorded his first career triple-double against the Toronto Raptors on January 17, 2006, posting 18 points, 16 rebounds and 11 assists, becoming the first Russian in NBA history to complete that milestone.\n\nRecorded his second career triple-double against the Sacramento Kings on March 25, 2006, posting 15 points, 14 rebounds and 10 blocks.\n\nKirilenko shoots with his right hand but writes left-handed.\n\nHis wife said in an interview that she allows him to sleep with another woman for one night a year [1],[2]\n\nHowever, his wife states that there is no \"reciprocal\" arrangement for her, and Kirilenko states he has no plans to take advantage of the agreement.[3]\n\nTransactions[]\n\nJune 30, 1999: Drafted by the Utah Jazz in the 1st round (24th overall) in 1999.\n\nStatistics[]\n\nTotals[]\n\nSeason Team G GS MP FG FGA FG% 3P 3PA 3P% FT FTA FT% ORB DRB TRB AST STL BLK TOV PF PTS 2002 UTA 82 40 2151 285 633 .450 25 100 .250 285 371 .768 149 253 402 94 116 159 108 156 880 2003 UTA 80 11 2213 315 642 .491 37 114 .325 296 370 .800 147 273 420 138 118 175 136 185 963 2004 UTA 78 78 2895 412 931 .443 68 201 .338 392 496 .790 226 403 629 244 150 215 215 174 1284 2005 UTA 41 37 1349 207 420 .493 23 77 .299 203 259 .784 89 166 255 132 67 136 90 101 640 2006 UTA 69 63 2604 336 730 .460 36 117 .308 346 495 .699 161 391 552 299 102 220 203 162 1054 2007 UTA 70 70 2049 197 418 .471 16 75 .213 174 239 .728 88 241 329 202 74 144 135 172 584 2008 UTA 72 72 2217 275 544 .506 44 116 .379 198 257 .770 121 218 339 285 86 109 140 165 792 2009 UTA 67 10 1831 256 570 .449 20 73 .274 244 311 .785 84 235 319 175 83 77 121 127 776 Career 559 881 17309 2283 4888 .467 269 873 .308 2138 2798 .764 1065 2180 3245 1569 796 1235 1148 1242 6973\n\nPer Game[]\n\nSeason Team G GS MP FG FGA FG% 3P 3PA 3P% FT FTA FT% ORB DRB TRB AST STL BLK TOV PF PTS 2002 UTA 82 40 26.2 3.5 7.7 .450 0.3 1.2 .250 3.5 4.5 .768 1.8 3.1 4.9 1.1 1.4 1.9 1.3 1.9 10.7 2003 UTA 80 11 27.7 3.9 8.0 .491 0.5 1.4 .325 3.7 4.6 .800 1.8 3.4 5.3 1.7 1.5 2.2 1.7 2.3 12.0 2004 UTA 78 78 37.1 5.3 11.9 .443 0.9 2.6 .338 5.0 6.4 .790 2.9 5.2 8.1 3.1 1.9 2.8 2.8 2.2 16.5 2005 UTA 41 37 32.9 5.0 10.2 .493 0.6 1.9 .299 5.0 6.3 .784 2.2 4.0 6.2 3.2 1.6 3.3 2.2 2.5 15.6 2006 UTA 69 63 37.7 4.9 10.6 .460 0.5 1.7 .308 5.0 7.2 .699 2.3 5.7 8.0 4.3 1.5 3.2 2.9 2.3 15.3 2007 UTA 70 70 29.3 2.8 6.0 .471 0.2 1.1 .213 2.5 3.4 .728 1.3 3.4 4.7 2.9 1.1 2.1 1.9 2.5 8.3 2008 UTA 72 72 30.8 3.8 7.6 .506 0.6 1.6 .379 2.8 3.6 .770 1.7 3.0 4.7 4.0 1.2 1.5 1.9 2.3 11.0 2009 UTA 67 10 27.3 3.8 8.5 .449 0.3 1.1 .274 3.6 4.6 .785 1.3 3.5 4.8 2.6 1.2 1.1 1.8 1.9 11.6 Career 559 381 31.0 4.1 8.7 .467 0.5 1.6 .308 3.8 5.0 .764 1.9 3.9 5.8 2.8 1.4 2.2 2.1 2.2 12.5\n\nAwards and Accomplishments[]\n\nSee also[]\n\nWeb Directory[]\n\nOfficial website\n\nNBA player page\n\nPlayer Page at basketball-reference.com\n\nAndrei Kirilenko Player Profile (InterBasket)\n\nStatistics[]\n\nNews, Opinion, and Rumors[]"
