Utah Jazz forward Andrei Kirilenko has signed a 3-year contract with Russia's CSKA team that he can terminate if the NBA lockout ends.

The deal was announced on the team's website.

Kirilenko will become an unrestricted free agent once the 2011-12 NBA campaign begins but has expressed a desire to play for the team that drafted him 24th overall in 1999.

The 30-year-old grew up in Russia but gained dual citizenship recently.

He averaged 11.7 points and 5.1 rebounds last season but battled injuries.

Kirilenko started his pro career in St. Petersburg when he was 16 and joined CSKA a year later.

Kirilenko said on the website he was glad to be back where he spent his adolescence.

He said the money he earns in Russia will go to his Kirilenko's Kids charity.
