Andrei Kirilenko, a free agent forward of the Utah Jazz, has signed a contract to play with CSKA Moscow in his native Russia during the NBA lockout. FIBA.com reports that Kirilenko signed a three-year deal with CSKA, but the deal includes an opt-out clause that would allow the forward to return to the NBA if the lockout ends. As a free agent, Kirilenko did not have to include an opt-out clause in his deal under FIBA regulations. Kirilenko also said that he will donate all of his salary earned in Russia to charity.

Kirilenko wouldn't be expected to stay with the Jazz, the only NBA team he's ever played for. Rumors have suggested that the New Jersey Nets would be interested in bringing AK in, based in equal parts on the team's lack of depth at small and power forward, and Kirilenko's relationships with Nets star Deron Williams and owner Mikhail Prokhorov.

CSKA Moscow competes in the Euroleague in addition to the Russian domestic league.
