Kökten, C. Burneyand K. Bittel. The surveys in İznik-İnegöl areas by D. French (1960-1961, 1965-1966) and J. Cullberg (1964-65) has provided the first preliminary site distribution and material evidence concerning the region. Much later, between the years 1988-1995, T. Efe conducted surface surveys in ...",

        "text": "We would like to thank the General Directorate of Antiquities and Museums of Turkey for granting the necessary permit, thus making this survey possible. Our thanks also go to the directors and stuffs of the Eskişehir, Kütahya and Bilecik Museums, government representatives and the team members of each year.\n\nIntroduction\n\n4Çavlum lies in the Alpu Plain to the east of Eskişehir and the last two cemeteries are situated in the Afyon plain which remains outside the survey area. For the reasons cited above, it has not been possible to give a detailed analysis and chronological evaluation of the survey pottery in terms of the Middle and Late Bronze ages.\n\nGeographical Framework\n\n5The survey area encompassing ca. 150 km2 covers the most northwestern extremity of Central Anatolian Plateau (Upper Sakarya and Eskişehir plains), central part of Inland Western Anatolian Plateau or Threshold (the area covering roughly the Kütahya province) and the Eastern Marmara Region (Bilecik province). The area is an important buffer zone for the connections between inland Anatolia and the Marmara basin and beyond.\n\n7The Bilecik province situated between Central Anatolia and the Marmara basin is comprised of rough terrain which forms the western extremity of the Köroğlu mountain range to the north of the Sündüken Dağları. The area forms a buffer-zone between the Eskişehir and İznik-İnegöl plains. After the pass at Bozüyük, the Karasu river valley leads the traffic northward into the Bilecik, Osmaneli and Gölpazarı areas. The communication between this valley and the İnegöl plain seems to have been provided by way of the Pazaryeri plain to the west. Pazaryeri and Gölpazarı are the only plains in the area worth mentioning. The paucity of land suitable for cultivation is most likely the main reason why the area was not densely settled during the Bronze Ages.\n\nCatalogue of the Surveyed Sites\n\n9The sites and the pottery are introduced in five cultural/geographical areas, according to the topography and clusters that the Second Millennium sites form:\n\nUpper Sakarya Plains and the Phrygian Highlands\n\nUpper Porsuk Valley and the Eskişehir Plains\n\nNorthern part of the Kütahya province (The Areas of Kütahya-Tavşanlı, Seyitömer and Domaniç)\n\nSouthern part of the Kütahya province (the Altıntaş, Örencik and Emet areas)\n\nThe Bilecik Province\n\n10In this part, we will briefly introduce each site.\n\nUpper Sakarya Plains and the Phrygian Highlands\n\n11In this area, twenty seven sites have been visited.\n\n12Aşağı Kepen/Büyük Höyük (1)\n\nLocation: 6.5 km SW of Sivrihisar; the immediate west of Aşağı Kepen village.

The mound is very high; so we can anticipate that the Second Millennium is represented on the mound, although no evidence has been provided.\n\nDimensions: Large oval mound. Length: 260 m; Width: 180 m; Area: 3.5 ha (cat. 3); Height: 21.50 m.\n\nBibliography: Efe 1992: 567 (Site 55)\n\nSurvey Methodology\n\n108To begin with, we would like to briefly introduce the survey methodology in order to better assess the survey results achieved in terms of the Second Millennium B.C.\n\nSite recognition\n\n109The surface surveys in the area by C. Burney and D. French in the 50’s and 60’s were mainly confined to the mounds in the plains easily visible from a distance. Among these Eskişehir Province was the least known area in terms of prehistoric site distribution. Dündar Tokgöz, the former Director of the Eskişehir Archaeological Museum conducted an intensive survey in the Eskişehir province in the late 1970’s. Unfortunately, his survey results have not been introduced to the literature. The site distribution map partly based on his survey results was fetched from the museum by T. Efe, right before his survey and it saved him a lot of time and effort in finding the mounds. During the surface survey, additional new mounds and flat settlements have also been discovered; thus, in total, more than 200 prehistoric sites have been visited. Among these, 89 sites that we introduce here yielded Second Millennium pottery.\n\n110The survey has been conducted under difficult conditions, basically due to the insufficiency of the financial possibilities. We cannot claim that every remote corner of the region has been reached. From time to time, the team walked in the fields to look for the flat settlements.\n\nSite measurements\n\n112The site size was measured using 20 m-long tape line, a spirit level and a meter stick (for the height of the site). During the preparation of the catalogue of the surveyed sites, almost all of the sites visited have been spotted in Google Earth and the values for their sizes verified.\n\nCollection strategy\n\nTable 1: Periodization of surveyed sites\n\n114Due to the fact there were very few excavated sites in the survey area for the Second Millennium (Demircihöyük, Seyitömer) and by consequence a paucity of well stratified contexts, the chronological frame for the Middle and Late Bronze Age was largely based on wider regional synchronism (Beycesultan, Troia, Gordion, Boğazköy) (cf. Fig. 3). In the current state of research, it is not possible to distinguish accurately the material from the Middle and Late Bronze Age. Thus, for a large majority of sherds of the corpus is labelled Second Millennium.\n\nAssessment of the Sites Interms of Their Types, Sizes and Distribution\n\nSettlement Types\n\n115Nearly all Second Millennium sites were established on the mounds as a continuation of earlier settlements; flat settlements such as Kayabaşı/İnli (27), Kızlar Höyük (41), Esnemez (55), Hüyüktepe (78) and Kalehöyük (83) are few. Since the material of the preceding EB III period is often sealed under the Second Millennium deposit on the mounds, it is not, most of the time, possible to determine on how many of them the occupation continues uninterrupted into the Second Millennium B.C. The settlements normally take the shape of the earlier mound or the natural rise on which the site was established – Hüyüktepe (78), Aşağı Kepen (1). Most of the sites are round, roughly round or oval in shape.\n\n116The sites of Suluhöyük (14) and Yeşildon (32) (Fig. 2e) have long oval terracing on one side. It either has something to do with the subsequent expansion of the site or with the gradual formation of upper and lower settlements. Three large-sized mounds, Karapazar (24) (Fig. 2a), Malatça (59) and Tavşanlı (81) (Fig. 2d), seem to definitely have lower settlements on one side. We are not sure if those of Karapazar and Malatça date from the Second Millennium. The Yakakayı site (40), on the other hand, is comprised of a mound and a lower settlement encircling it all the way around. So, it is very similar in form to certain Mesopotamian tells.\n\nSettlement Sizes and Site Distribution\n\n117Due to the favorable geographical conditions (fertile and well-watered plains, richness of natural sources), strategic situation etc. the area was densely inhabited in all periods. Eighty-nine sites from the Second Millennium have so far been discovered in the survey area, encompassing the Provinces of Kütahya, Bilecik and Eskişehir (Fig. 3). Most of these sites are clustered in the Plains of Upper Sakarya, Eskişehir and Altıntaş-Örencik (Southern Kütahya Province). The Tavşanlı-Kütahya plains and the mountainous regions are much less populated. Surprisingly, the eastern part of the Upper Sakarya Plain as well was never densely settled in prehistoric times.\n\n118We distinguished four categories of sites according to their sizes:\n\nCategory 1: 10-30 ha\n\nCategory 2: 5-10 ha\n\nCategory 3: 1-5 ha\n\nCategory 4: less than 1 hectare (Fig. 3).\n\n119In the entire survey area, the number of category 1 sites in total are 7. The other 6 sites belong to Category 2. The sizes of most sites (51 out of 89 identified) are range between 1 ha to 5 ha (cat. 3). This is by far, the most widespread kind of settlement in the region at this time. Finally, 25 sites measured less than 1 hectare (cat. 4).\n\n120In terms of site distribution, the following five sub-regions have been determined, based on the geographical and cultural conditions.\n\nThe Upper Sakarya Plains and the Phrygian Highlands (I)\n\n121The Sakarya River crosses the area from east to west. This region delivered twenty seven sites, most of which are located in the western half of the plain. Only a few small sites from the Second Millennium B.C. are known from the Phrygian Highlands to the west.\n\n122This area delivered one major site (category 1) Aşağı Kepen (1), in the eastern part of the plain. The Second Millennium settlement, however, might not be as impressive as it appears to be. The cone in the middle of the settlement appears not to have cultural accumulation. This site is quite isolated; only two small sites – Kızılcaköy (2) and Bahçeçik II (3) – have been located in its close vicinity.\n\n123The region has 2 sites of category 2 and 19 of category 3. If we take the lower settlement into consideration, we can evaluate Karapazar (24) under category 2 sites. Finally, category 4 is only represented by 5 settlements.\n\nThe Upper Porsuk Valley and the Eskişehir Plain (II)\n\n124The eastern part of the plain is called Alpu Plain. The plain is terminated in the west by the plains of İnönü and Bozüyük. The Porsuk and its tributary, Sarısu run through the plain. Most of the sites line up along these rivers. The upper Porsuk Valley which provides traffic between Kütahya and Eskişehir plains was poorly occupied during the Second Millennium B.C.\n\n125With 31 sites, this plain is by far the most densely occupied part of the survey area. Five large sites of more than 10 ha have been located in this area. These are, from east to west, Porsuk II (30), Karahüyük/Midaion (39), Yakakayı (40), Şarhöyük/Doryleion (44) and Bahçehisar/Kandilli (53). Porsuk II almost 30 ha in size is the most impressive of all sites. However, we are not sure if the entire surface of the mound was occupied during this time period. Karahöyük/Midaion (30) which is almost 20 ha in size constitutes the second largest mound of the plain. Around these large settlements, there are a range of intermediate sites: 1 site of 5-10 ha, 16 sites of 1-5 ha and 9 sites less than 1 ha. The eastern part of the Eskişehir Plain (the Alpu Plain) is more densely settled than the west.\n\n126The regions I and II are both densely occupied; however, they don’t present the same patterns. In the Upper Sakarya region (I), the major sites (Aşağı Kepen) is quite isolated. On the contrary, in region II, the major sites (30, 39, 40, 44, 53) are surrounded by clusters of sites. This variation could reflect different kinds of political organization.\n\nThe Southern Kütahya Province (III)\n\n127Sixteen sites have been located in this area. The site of Hacıkebir (70), which covers 14 ha, appears to be the crucial site of this area. There are 2 sites of category 2, 6 sites of category 3 and 7 sites of category 4. The clustering of sites and their increase in number as they get smaller in size might, as well, have something to do with the political/hierarchical structuring in the area.\n\nNorthern Kütahya Province (IV)\n\n128This region is less densely occupied than the previous ones. Only eight sites have been identified in this area. On the western part of the area is located the major site (cat. 1) of Tavşanlı (81) and Kocahüyük (82) which is of intermediate size (cat. 2) is located in the north.\n\n129Except for Kayıköy (80), the other settlements of the area are not located in the immediate vicinity of Tavşanlı (81). The oval flat settlement of Hüyüktepe (78) dated to the LBA is situated on a natural hill in the mountainous area to the north of the Kütahya Plain. The mound of Seyitömer (77) in the immediate vicinity is the only excavated site in this area. The completely excavated level IVA (with 3 architectural layers), the material of which has not yet been adequately published is dated to the MBA.\n\nThe Bilecik province (V)\n\n130Finally, the last region is located in the northern part of our survey area. The settlement system in the “Bilecik Province” is characterized by small and dispersed settlements measuring less than 5 ha. There are only 2 sites of category 4 – Kalehöyük (83), Demirköy (84) – and 5 sites of category 3 – Pazaryeri II (85), Kınık (86), Gökhöyük (87), Yıllık Höyük (88) and Arıçaklar/Aracaklar (89).\n\n131This region seems obviously to be more sparsely populated. This is the only zone in the surveyed area that hasn’t delivered at least one major site. Arıcaklar, situated in the Gölpazarı plain is the largest mound (3.5 ha). This area was most probably culturally – and perhaps politically as well – integrated with the neighbouring İznik-İnegöl area which was much more densely populated than Bilecik Province during the entire time span of the Bronze Ages. İnegöl II and Çardak are the largest mounds.\n\nThe Wares\n\n132Our corpus includes 258 drawn sherds. Only sherds which we considered important for the Second Millennium such as rim sherds, bases, and wall sherds with decorative patterns have been illustrated. The pottery is divided into nine different ware groups, determined mainly according to the surface treatment. The paste is normally fine except the coarse ware. The vast majority of the pottery is wheel made. Wheel marks are usually visible. The cooking-pot rims pieces (n° 176 and 177) are definitely handmade.\n\nFine Red Slipped Ware/Hittite Ware (ware 1) (Fig. 4)\n\n133The surface is slipped and burnished. The quality of burnish varies. Sometimes burnishing strokes are visible and occasionally horizontal burnishing stripes or pattern-burnishing are present. Some pieces have matt surfaces. The surface colour is in various hues of red, reddish brown and light brown. The paste is normally very fine. Some pastes are compact and well-fired. Seldom sporadic stone tempering. Mica is not characteristic. The most popular paste colour is brown. Especially thick walls have cores. Most of the well burnished examples of this ware should rather be dated to the Middle Bronze Age.\n\n135This ware is mainly dated to the Middle Bronze Age. A subcategories of the Fine Red Slipped ware, called Brown Slipped Ware are also attested, but so far sherds have been found at only two sites Tavşanlı (no 205) and Yakakayı (no 170). They are slipped and burnished; well smoothed and occasionally faceted. Slip adheres very well. The surface colour presents various tones of brown. The brown paste, occasionally with core, is very fine, compact and hard fired. No tempering. It differentiates itself from the Fine Red Slipped Ware by having a compact paste and well-adhered brown slip.\n\nRed Washed Ware (ware 2) (Fig. 5)\n\n136This ware is in most ways similar to the Fine Red Sipped Ware. The only difference is that this ware has a thin slip defined as “wash”. Sometimes horizontal burnishing strokes are visible on the surface.\n\nOrange Washed Ware (ware 3) (Fig. 6)\n\n137The surface is slipped, matt or slightly burnished. Sometimes, the slip is thin (washed). The color surface varies between Orange, pinkish brown and light brown. The biscuit is fine, normally with no tempering; brown, pink, pinkish brown; without core.\n\n138Comments: This ware is widespread from the early EB III on, in the Kütahya, Uşak and Denizli areas. The Seyitömer early EB III Orange Slipped Ware must be somehow related to this ware.\n\nRed/Brown Burnished Ware (ware 4) (Fig 7)\n\n139No slip, matt or burnished; sometimes with horizontal or vertical burnishing strokes. The surface changes from reddish brown to light brown. Biscuit is fine, no tempering. The clay is reddish brown, pinkish red, brown or light brown in colour.\n\n140Comments: This ware is separated from the Plain Ware practically by its matt or burnished surface.\n\n141Comparison: French 1967: 64 (Second millennium: Red burnished).\n\nHittite White/Cream Slipped Ware (ware 5) (Fig. 8)\n\n142Slipped, matt or slightly burnished. The surface is white or cream in colour. The biscuit is fine. The thick walls sometimes shows sporadic stone tempering. No mica. Paste colour varies from red to reddish brown or light brown.\n\n143Comments: This typical Hittite White/Cream Slipped Ware is especially known from Central Anatolia.\n\nSecond Millennium Demirköy Ware (ware 6) (Fig. 9)\n\n144No slip, matt or slightly burnished surface. Brown or reddish brown in colour. The clay is fine and always with mica inclusions; red, reddish brown or brown in colour.\n\n145Comments: This ware, hand or wheel made, seems to occur in the Bilecik area from the EB I period onward.\n\nPlain Ware (ware 7) (Fig. 10)\n\n146No slipped and no burnish; normally well smoothed. In all kinds of tones of red or brown.\n\n147The clay is normally fine. Stone inclusions occur infrequently. Mica is not typical. Paste colour is the same as the surface. Horizontal grooving or fluting is typical on the vessels of this ware.\n\nGrey Ware (ware 8) (Fig. 11)\n\n148Slipped, washed or unslipped; matt or slightly burnished. The surface presents different shades of grey. The biscuit is fine. Thick walls occasionally with sporadic stone tempering. Paste colour is black, dark grey, light brown.\n\nCoarse Ware (Ware 9) (Fig. 12)\n\n150No slip and no burnish. The colour varies from reddish brown to brown. Cooking pots are naturally secondarily burnt and often with smoky surfaces. The clay is coarse often with large stone inclusions. Paste colour is the same as that of the surface.\n\n151Comments: This ware is mostly represented by cooking pots with globular bodies and crescent lugs under the rims.\n\nForms\n\n152In the following section each form is described in detail and pertinent parallels in Western Anatolia are cited. Parallels are made on the basis of shape alone. Considering that we are dealing with survey material we are not able to determine the preponderance of any specific shapes or to claim to the completeness of the repertory. We have distinguished twenty five different shapes of pottery, including bowls, dishes, pots and jugs. There are many pieces that are not sufficiently preserved to restore complete profile. The total number of drawn sherds are 246.\n\nBowls\n\n153The bowls are the commonest shape. There is a great number of subvarieties in profile. Twelve subgroups have been distinguished according to their profile. The great majority of the bowls of our corpus are wheel made. Wheel marks are usually visible on interiors.\n\nA1- Bowls with simple profile (Fig. 14)\n\n154The first type is a hemispheric simple bowl with a plain rim (n° 1-2, Tavşanlı). The shape occurs in Orange washed ware (ware 3).\n\nA2- Bowl with incurving rim (Fig. 14)\n\nA3- Carinated bowls (Fig. 14)\n\nA4- Bowls with interior-thickened rim (Fig. 15)\n\nA5- Bowls with S-profile (Fig. 15)\n\n158Bowls with S-profile represent the fifth type. They are generally carinated (n° 31 Malatça, 32 Malatça, 33 Tavşanlı, 34 Yalınlı, 35 Tavşanlı, 38 Tavşanlı, 39 Tavşanlı, 36 Haydarlar, 37 Malatça, 40 Gecek) but we also have some examples of simple profile (n° 41 Malatça, 42 Hüyüktepe, 43 İkiz Höyük, 44 Haydarlar). Among this group, there is one example of a shallow flaring bowl with S-profile (n° 40 Gecek). This type of bowl can also boast a loop handle (n° 35 Tavşanlı) with a flat section.\n\nA6- Bowls with fluting under the rim (Fig. 15)\n\nA7- Bead rim bowl (Fig. 16-17)\n\nA8- Bowls with flattened bead rim (hemispherical or carinated) (Fig. 17-18)\n\nA9- Simple bowls with T-shaped rim (Fig. 19)\n\nA10- Carinated bowl with overhanging rim (Fig. 19)\n\nA11- Carinated bowls with broad flat-topped rim (Fig. 19)\n\nA12- Bowls with various thickened-rim shape (Fig. 19)\n\nDishes\n\n167The second category of vessel are the dishes. We distinguished three different types.\n\nB1 – Dishes with simple profile (Fig. 20)\n\nB2 – Dishes with interior-thickened rim (Fig. 20)\n\nB3- Dishes with T-shape rim (Fig. 20)\n\n170The third and last type of dishes is the one which present a T-shape rim. The diameter of these dishes varie between 20 and 30 cm (n° 145 Karacahüyük, 146 Yakakayı, 147 Ortaca, 148 Köprübaşı, 149 Haydarlar, 150 Çerkes Çukurhisar, 151 Yalınlı). This shape was found in Fine Red Slipped Ware (ware 1), Orange Washed Ware (ware 3) and Plain Ware (ware 7).\n\nPots\n\nC1- Pots with bead rim (Fig. 21)\n\n171The pots with bead rim are quite common. The profiles of this form are almost straight (n° 153 Ortaca, 154 Gecek, 156 Hacıkebir, 163 Hacıkebir, 165 Bahçehisar, 166 Çayır Höyük, 168 Güllühöyük), or slightly hemispherical (n° 152 Höyüktepe, 155 Tavşanlı, 157 Tavşanlı, 158 Erenköy I, 159 Sağlar, 160 Bahçecik, 162 Erenköy I, 164 Tavşanlı, 167 Kızılcaköy). The bead rim is more or less pronounced. Our examples measured between 18 and 30 of rim diameter. This kind of pot occur mainly in washed\n\n172Ware, Red or Orange Washed Wares (wares 2 and 3), but also in Red/Brown Burnished Ware (ware 4), in Fine Red Slipped Ware (Ware 1) and in Plain Ware (ware 7).\n\nC2- Globular pots including cooking pots (Fig. 22)\n\nC3- Globular pots and pithoi with outturning rims (Fig. 23)\n\n174Profiles of these globular pots show many variations, especially in the rim shape, the sharpness of angle and the height of rim (n° 179 Gecek, 181 Tavşanlı, 182 Subak, 183 Parmakören, 184 Ilıcabaşı, 185 Tavşanlı, 186 Bahçehisar, 187 Hacıkebir, 188 Demirköy, 189 Malatça). The globular pots with outturning rim generally occur in Red or Orange Washed Ware (ware 2 and 3), or in Plain Ware (Ware 7). There is one example in Red/Brown Burnished Ware (ware 4).\n\nJug\n\nD1- Trefoil-mouthed jug (Fig. 24)\n\nD2- Elongated and pointed beak-spouted jug (Schnabelkanne) (Fig. 24)\n\nD3- Jug necks (Fig. 24)\n\n180The third group is represented by jugs characterized by a narrow cylindrical neck. We can distinguish different rim profiles: outturning (n° 200 Par- makören, 201 Tavşanlı, 202 Ortaca, 203 Tavşanlı, 204 Tavşanlı, 205 Tavşanlı, 206 Ortaca, 208 Külhöyük, 211 Tavşanlı), with thickened rim (n° 209 Ortaca, 210 Köprübaşı, 211 Tavşanlı), with sloping rim (n° 207 Bahçecik). Sherd n° 208 has a round-sectioned handle which is attached to the rim. This shape is represented by several wares: Fine Red Slipped Ware and Brown Slipped Ware (Ware 1), Orange Washed Ware (ware 3), Red/Brown Slipped Ware (Ware 4), Cream Slipped Ware (Ware 5) and Plain Ware (Ware 7).\n\nFunnel (Fig. 25)\n\nSmall pots (Fig. 25)\n\n182Two sherds from small pots (n° 213 Hacıkebir, 214 Hüyüktepe) have been classified under a separate group. They have a globular body with small rim diameter and are represented by Fine Red Slipped Ware (Ware 1) and Plain Ware (Ware 7).\n\nCups/goblets or miniatures ( ?) (Fig. 25)\n\n183Six sherds could belong to cups/goblets or miniature vessels. They are characterized by a very thin rim and a small size (under 11 cm in diameter). Since we only have the upper portions of these vessels, we don’t know what kind of a base they have. Generally, the upper part is in the form of a carinated bowl.\n\n184The sherds of our corpus show various profile: simple rim (n° 217 Tavşanlı, 216 Tavşanlı, 215 Tavşanlı), bead rim (n° 218 Ortaca), overhung rim (n° 219 Tavşanlı) and everted rim (n° 220 Bahçehisar). This cup/goblets occurs in Fine Red Slipped Ware (ware 1), in Red and Orange Washed Wares (wares 2 and 3).\n\nPedestal pieces\n\nBases (Fig. 25)\n\n186Three different type of base have been recorded. The gently rounded bases (n° 227 Tavşanlı), the flat bases (n° 231 Güllühöyük, 232 Tavşanlı, 230 Tavşanlı, 229 Tavşanlı, 228 Tavşanlı) and the ring bases (n° 236 Akin, 234 Tavşanlı, 233 Tavşanlı, 235 Yakakayı). Sherd n° 231 is a typical string-cut base.\n\nMiscellaneous (Fig. 26)\n\nOrnament (Fig. 13, 26)\n\n188Decoration on the pottery is quite sparse in our corpus. Certain pieces have relief decoration either in knobs (n° 51, 108) or in “mustache” motif (n° 65, 67, 72). The motif on one piece is undetermined (n° 86). The incision/grooving is executed in chevrons, zigzag or straight lines (n° 243, 242, 167). Pattern burnishing is also attested (n° 125, 95, 115, 167, 21, 184). Most of the decorated pieces are only wall sherds which do not permit the identification of the shapes of the vessels. Knobs are situated on the exterior and on or under the rim. The “mustache motif” is always applied on the body, just under the rim (n° 56, 65, 67, 72). The pattern-burnished motives (Fig. 13) can be on the exterior (n° 115, 246) or on both the inside and outside (n° 125). Different designs are attested, such as horizontal strips of various sizes, vertical lines or strokes and chevrons (n° 245).\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\n192Three sites have so far been investigated in the research area in terms of the Middle and Late Bronze Ages: Demircihüyük, Şarhöyük and Seyitömer Höyük. The completely excavated MBA level (IV) at Seyitömer has given us a valuable information on the architecture and different material groups of the period. It has not yet been adequately published however. Demircihüyük MBA with four phases (I-IV) was investigated only in a limited area. Second Millennium pottery of Şarhöyük has also not yet been published. Since we here mainly rely upon the surface material, it is not possible to make a detailed analysis of the Second Millennium pottery of the region in terms of its development, local characteristics and interrelations with those of neighbouring regions.\n\n193We can speak of two different pottery distribution areas in the research area: area 1 encompasses roughly the Eskişehir and Kütahya provinces (subregions I-IV) and area 2 the Bilecik Province (subregion V). The pottery of the first area display a parallel development to that of Central Anatolia from the Late EB III (Transitional Period into the MBA) onwards, although the pottery groups of both regions exhibit certain differences in wares, forms and stylistic features. The pottery of Altıntaş-Örencik Plains/Sub-region III, due to its geographical position, has also certain common characteristics with the Beycesultan type of pottery distributed roughly in the Uşak and Denizli provinces. The area 2 (Bilecik Province) appears to be bonded culturally with İznik-İnegöl areas in the west. The Gray Ware of this area is also attested in the northern Kütahya province (Sub-region IV) as an intrusion. Such pottery particularly characterised by its bowls with horizontal handles on the rim (with or without low pedestals) has lately been recovered at Seyitömer Höyük MBA levels.\n\n194This study clearly demonstrates the archaeological potential of the area in the Second Millennium B.C. We need excavations especially on the large-sized mounds in each of the sub-regions to assess and evaluate the issues concerning the Second Millennium of inland western Anatolia from a broader perspective."
