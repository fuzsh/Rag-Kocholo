From this perspective, the cave map is one of the most critical references between an exploration and a sporting pastime. Therefore, the priority of every caver who discovers a new cave is to survey, map and publish that cave. Mapping a cave requires precise and tiring work. In a dark, mostly humid, muddy and wet environment, hundreds of stations are detected, distances between stations, compass and clino measurements are taken and rechecked when necessary, and most importantly, detailed sketches are drawn in these challenging conditions. Then, these muddy sketchbooks open onto the desk, and the drawing begins. If the cave is long and complicated, this desk work takes days, sometimes weeks, and no one pays you for your hard work. It is only a document of your extraordinary discovery and effort.\n\nGiven all these difficulties, there should be a logical and sound reason for remapping a previously mapped cave. The most important reason is the idea of correcting the existing errors in the old map and drawing a new map that is better and more detailed than the old one. Even discovering new galleries does not require remapping the entire cavern if the previous map is sufficiently clear. It will suffice to add new findings to the old map, as has been done for years in many different parts of the world.\n\nThe map of Altınbeşik Cave, which you will see a few pages later, is an excellent example. The Czech cavers working in this cave used the WEC cavers’ map, which mapped this part before them, rather than measuring and drawing the part of the cave again until the first siphon, and they started their measurements after the point where that map ended. Therefore, every caver who surveys a cave must show maximum precision in measurements and drawings, considering that the exploration of that cave will continue after them and that future generations will use the part they have drawn. As far as we have been able to determine, there is more than one map of 79 caves in Turkey, and –unfortunately- the reason why most of these second, even third and fourth maps were drawn is not the logical reason we mentioned above. Most of these caves have been remapped for the following reasons: The first and most important reason is that the team investigating the cave needs to learn that this cave has been previously explored and mapped. This problem is due to several reasons. First, there is no inventory of the studies conducted for many years, and the groups working in the field cannot do a comprehensive literature review before this study. Before the inventory (www. tayproject.org), which exists now and was prepared 17 years ago, it took a lot of work to conduct archival research because it was almost impossible to find the documents of old cave researchers. On the other hand, although we have had an inventory of caves for many years, regional cave information still needs to be improved. Different names are given to the same cave by local people or different cavers, creating a severe problem. As a natural consequence, some caves can be remapped due to their different names. Only after you have drawn and finished the map and if you search all the maps in the inventory one by one, you can understand that Atak and Cliff caves, Tabak and Kırkgözler sinkholes or Fossil and Güvercinlik caves are the same places. An even worse problem is that caves are given codes instead of names, and there is no GPS coordinate on the report or map of the cave. In 1992 the French ADEKS group came to Kastamonu region as part of a general Turkey survey, discovered and surveyed 11 caves. They only gave a code to the caves instead of their local names, and there is no detailed information in the report, so it is not possible to understand which caves they are. One of the descriptions in their report illustrates this issue: “As for the cave TU 92-51, it would be utopian to try to find it by reading this report! Let us point out that it is located about 25 km east-south-east of the coastal town of Cide, still in the\n\nKastamonu region” (Wolozan, 1992). In this case, there is no doubt that the sinkhole coded TU 92-51, which has been explored and mapped before, will be explored and mapped several more times. Another reason why the same cave has different maps drawn at other times is different from the working style of European and North American caving organizations; caving organizations operating in Turkey do not concentrate on a specific region and work scattered in very different areas, in line with the news and notices they receive, instead of scientifically researching the entire region in an extended period. This way of working has been going on for many years. Combined with inadequate inventory and use of references, different research organizations sometimes work in close proximity or even in the same areas, resulting in many caves being rediscovered and remapped.\n\nDouble Cave Maps poster, 16. ICS Double Cave Maps poster, 4. MESS Symposium, Antalya 2018 Congress, Brno 2013 As a result of all these mistakes, today, we have 185 different maps belonging to 79 caves. The only benefit of all these “double maps”, most of which are drawn unnecessarily, is that we can compare them to see the differences and inaccuracies and analyze how a cave map should be drawn or not drawn.\n\nSome cave maps show how minor survey errors accumulate, leading to significant errors. Despite that, some other maps have been marked with such precise measurements that despite all the years that have passed and the advances in measurement techniques, the redrawn map is like a copy of the old one. The “double maps” that bothered us the most were the ones we questioned, which were closer to the truth or even whether they were maps of the same cave. We have presented a poster at two international and one national congress about double maps of caves in Turkey. The poster we submitted during the 16th UIS Congress in Brno in 2013 was documented by the NSS Cave Mapping Department for display in their training. Although we could present a maximum of 15-20 cave maps in these posters at different congresses, it became necessary to prepare this book when the number of caves with double maps reached 79. We hope and wish this number stays the same, but unfortunately, we discover new reports every day and access previously drawn versions of new maps. Most of these maps were taken from sources that small caving organizations printed with limited means or even copied and reproduced. Ali Yamaç Istanul 2024\n\nALTINBEŞİK CAVE MAPS Ürünlü – İbradı – Antalya Located about 300 m west of the Manavgat River, this cave was first discovered by SCP in 1966 and first mapped (Chabert, 1966). Dye tests carried out during the construction of the Oymapınar Dam showed that there is a connection between Altınbeşik Cave and the sinkholes to the south of the Kembos Polje. The fact that the bird flight distance between these two points was 33 km caused many cavers to be interested in Altınbeşik in the following years, and during these researches, the dry galleries in the first part were mapped again. In 1986, for the first time in the US – German – Turkish joint activity, the 1st siphon dived (Hardcastle and Schmitt, 1987). The cave was studied by the Czech Geospeleos Club between 1992 and 2017, and four more siphons were passed in a row (Jäger and Janousek, 2013, Janousek, 2018 ). The leftmost of these four maps, whose directions and scales are almost the same, was drawn by Geospeleos and published in 2018. Normally, this map is much longer than the other three maps because Altınbeşik Cave is now 5,119 m. The second map from the left is the map of the Japanese team WEC from 1987. The reason why it looks like the Geospeleos map on the left is that the Geospeleos team did not draw this part of the cave and continued using the map of the Japanese. So these two maps are already the same; In a sense, one is the continuation of the other. Let’s come to the third map from the left: Gerhard Schmitt’s 1979 Altınbeşik map is very different from other maps, although it is placed in the same direction and on the same scale. Not only the direction of the cave or the side branches, but even the width of the gallery is unlike any other map. The interesting thing is; far right, the first map of Altınbeşik drawn by SCP in 1966. Although this map has some scale errors, it is at least similar to the Japanese team’s map of 1987 in terms of orientation and gallery widths.\n\nARMAĞAN 2 - YEŞİLLİK CAVE MAPS Demirköy – Kırklareli Before moving on to the map details, let’s start with the location of the cave: On the maps published in 1995, which you can see on the left, MAD wrote that this is Armağan 2 Cave in Kırklareli - Dereköy - Armağanlı Village (Özkan and Altay, 1999). Measuring the same cave again 14 years later, the mixed team said it is the Yeşillik Cave in Kırklareli - Demirköy - Armağan Village. We don’t mind the name of the cave, both teams may have given a name for themselves or its name changed over the years. Well, is Armağanlı (Armağan) Village connected to Dereköy or to Demirköy? Since it is 5 km south of Dereköy and 26 km west of Demirköy, it must be connected to Dereköy. By the way, in official records, the name of the village is not Armağanlı, but Armağan. After these corrections in the names, we can now move on to the maps. Both maps were drawn in the BCRA 3C standard. The BCRA 3C standard means ±2.5º measurement accuracy and ±50 cm length error at each station. C shows that sketches were taken at each station. If the margin of error at each station is 50 cm, how can the length of such a small cave be 58 m on one map and 101 m on the other? On the maps, the main hall at the entrance of the cave is not alike, nor is the side branch extending to the east. Anyway, at least the north and west arms look a little like each other.\n\nATAK - UÇURUM CAVE MAPS Pınarbaşı – Kastamonu This is a cave located near Çavuşköy in Kastamonu - Pınarbaşı. When we went for the survey in 2008, the villagers told us that his name was “Atak”. The FACC, which mapped the same cave in 1992, 16 years before us, named this cave “Uçurum”. We realized that the two caves were the same only after we drew the map, since we received the reports very late and they did not write any location on their maps. It was quite a long and difficult cave. Moreover, in the FACC report, they wrote that they found the cave too late, two days before the end of their expedition, and could not complete it. The fact that many arms are missing in the FACC map is a result of this lack of time. The total length on the FACC map is even less than half of the other map, which may be an explanation for the fact that the FACC did not survey many branches. On the left page, you see two maps rotated in the same direction and to the same scale. Yes, we said “to the same scale”. You can already see the two scale bars in the middle, top and bottom. There can only be one explanation for this extremely strange situation; One of these two maps must be scaled incorrectly!\n\nAYVACIK SINKHOLE MAPS Subatan – Bozdağ – Ödemiş - İzmir Compared to the Ödemiş Sinkhole on the other side of the same hill, Ayvacık Sinkhole is a much more difficult cave to survey and map. As you can see in the plans, it constantly makes side branches as it curves down and some of these arms are connected to the main gallery after a certain distance. On the left of the panel on the left page, there is the plan and profile of the 1990 joint work of ADEKS and BUMAK, and on the right, the plan and profile of the same cave drawn in 2010 by a mixed team. Although they may not seem similar at first glance, they actually have a lot in common. Note that the profile on the left is an ‘Extended profile’, and it is quite similar to the ‘Northeast’ profile on the right. Although the leftmost part of the ADEKS - BUMAK plan on the left looks like it is connected to the cave with a long gallery, it actually coincides with the lower floor of that point of the cave. Wolozan, who drew the plan, ‘torn’ that piece to show this detail. Of course, it would be much better if he showed the torn part with an arrow instead of a tunnel-like double line. The drawings of the great hall after the entrance are also not alike. On the other hand, interestingly, the measurements of the two maps are very close to each other; 1579 m and -228 m on the left, and 1575 m and -239 m on the right map.\n\nBAHÇECİK SINKHOLE MAPS Bahçecik – Bilecik On the left, you can see the map of Bahçecik Sinkhole drawn by OBRUK in 2011, and on the right, another map of the same cave drawn by MTA in 1997 (Nazik et al., 1997). Since the MTA measures up to the siphon, we only took that part of the OBRUK map. Considering these parts, these are two maps that are quite similar in orientation and detail.\n\nBALATİNİ CAVE MAPS Çamlık – Derebucak - Konya Balatini Cave was formed within the Jurassic-Cretaceous aged limestones of the Beyşehir-Hoyran nappes. Although the limestone of this region is very suitable for karstification, all caves in the region were developed horizontally due to its low thickness and the presence of an impermeable Permian schist layer at the bottom. Balatini drains the waters of the Balat uvala underground, a closed basin formed as a result of carstification, on its edge, and discharges it again after a short distance. The cave has a total of five different entrances and three interconnected galleries. It is strange that Balatini Cave, discovered by Temuçin Aygen in 1966, has not been mapped for many years. The first map of the cave is the map you see on the right drawn by MAD in 1982. On the left, you see the map drawn by the Swindon Speleological Society ten years later in 1992 (Stratford and Crabbe, 1992). The MAD map has been rotated in the same direction by us to match the Swindon map. Their scales are also same. At first glance, they look like similar maps, but the second gallery in the eastern part of the cave, continuing to the north, is incredibly long on the Swindon map compared to MAD. There shouldn’t be that much difference in a traverse cave with five different entrances.\n\nBALLIKAYA CAVE MAPS Söve – Manyas - Balıkesir These two maps are not at the same scale, and there is no need. Above the 1997 MTA map (Nazik et al., 1997) on the left is a rather oddly drawn plan. In the lower part, you can see the profile of the cave as a straight line inclined at 45 degrees. On the other hand, the profile of BUMAK dated 2004 that you see on the right is drawn as detailed as possible. MTA did not descend below -72 m and they put a note like “-40 / -50 m” under this descent. The depth of this level is almost -75 m in the BUMAK section, and the cave does not continue “-40 / -50 m” and ends 20 m later at -95 m. We leave the interpretation of estimating a 20 m descent as 40 - 50 m to you.\n\nBAYINDIR CAVE MAPS Bayındır - Büyükorhan - Bursa Map of MTA dated 2014 on the left and 2009 map of the MAD - Bursa on the right. The MAD- Bursa map has been rotated by us to match the MTA map. Two very successful works; Not only the orientation and gallery widths, even the small side pockets look more or less similar on both maps. MAD - Bursa measured the cave at 267 m and MTA, which worked five years after them, measured 266 m. While celebrating these two teams on the one hand, on the other hand, “Wouldn’t it be better if we didn’t do the same things over and over again?” one thinks.\n\nBOYNUZCU CAVE MAPS Taraşçı - Seydişehir - Konya Located in the Taraşçı Village of Seydişehir, the map on the left was drawn by a mixed team in 2011. On the right is an MTA map of 2009 (Nazik et al., 2009). The north of the MTA map has been turned by us to fit the other map. Apart from this transformation, the orientation and scales of both maps are the same. What is more interesting is that the lengths and depths are very close to each other on both maps. So what is the explanation for these two very different maps? You draw two separate maps of a three hundred-odd-meter cave, two years apart, and one of these maps is ‘Double Mirror’. In the following pages, you will see examples of ‘Mirror’ maps within the maps of İnaltı, Oylat, Subaşı and Susuz caves. While some of these maps are left-right or bottom-up ‘Mirror’, one of the two maps of the Boynuzcu Cave you see here is both left-right and bottom-up ‘Mirror’. That is a ‘Double Mirror’, and this is the only example we have come across so far. We do not know which of the maps is the ‘Double Mirror’, only those who drew it can know. But if you turn any of the maps both from left to right and from top to bottom, you will notice that it is very similar to the other map, except for minor differences. It’s relatively easy to spot when left-right or top-down mirror drawings are wrong, but the ‘Double Mirror’ map looks correct to the surveyor, oh if only there wasn’t a north arrow.\n\nBULAK - MENCILIS CAVE MAPS Safranbolu - Karabük On the left, there are four different maps of this cave, which has been explored since the 1970s. The beauty of these four maps is that, unlike the cave maps you see in this book, which are completely dissimilar, they are very similar to each other, in a sense they are “Keep Searching” maps. On the far right is the map drawn by BUMAK in 1976. The length is 870 m and - it cannot be seen in such a small print - but all the details on the map are outstanding. The second map right next to it belongs to the Trent Polytechnic University Caving Club and is dated 1978. In this map, the length of the cave is 2725 m. Then a German team with no knowledge of these previous studies drew the third map you see in the early 1980s. The map you see on the far left belongs to the ADEKS 92 study. David Wolozan and his team increased the length of Bulak - Mencilis Cave to 5250 m by passing six siphons one after the other. Like the maps of Altınbeşik Cave, the introductory part of the last map of Bulak - Mencilis is taken from the Trent Polytechnic map. So its 2725 m + 2525 m. Note to the curious: Bulak - Mencilis Cave remained in front of Siphon 7 and continues.\n\nBÜYÜKKAYA CAVE MAPS Ulus - Bartın The top map was drawn by MTA in 2002 and the bottom map was drawn by ASPEG in 2009. Yes, the profiles look so and so, but the difference between the plans is incredible. Even if we leave aside the details on the MTA map, even the compass orientation is different. The sad thing is that we don’t know which one is correct. If you make 50 error in a single station during the survey, this error continues. On the ASPEG map, the bend to the south about 50 m after the entrance is missing on the MTA map, perhaps one of the teams made a compass error at this point. The measurements are very close to each other. MTA measured the cave as 113 m and +16 m depth, ASPEG measured 129 m and +15 m.\n\nCİHANBEĞENDİ CAVE MAPS Gaziemir – İzmir Okay, we know; Caving and cave mapping is a useful hobby and some people really enjoy this activity, which is a very good thing. Okay, as in the previous Bulak-Mencilis Cave, if the exploration of the cave continues, of course you will draw a new map. However, it is not a very understandable activity to survey and map a cave that is 150 m or 125 m or 63 m or 47 m five times which does not continue. Especially if three of these five maps are drawn by the same club and no two are alike. On the bottom left you can see the first drawn BUMAK map of the cave, dated 1986. Compared to the other four maps, it seems that they did not care much about the subject. On the left column middle Rod Milner’s map from Speleo Digest dated 1992. DEUMAK maps dated 1995 on the upper left and 2016 on the lower right. Finally, there is another DEUMAK map dated 2020 on the upper right. These five maps, which date back to 34 years in total, have no relationship with each other, and the cave is only a hundred something meters long.\n\nPlease also check out Yarımburgaz Cave Maps for comparison.\n\nCİNLİKUYU - AKSIĞIN CAVE MAPS Aksığın - Kocaeli Kocaeli is perhaps the region where the most geological and geomorphological studies have been carried out in Turkey, due to the North Anatolian Fault passing just north of the caves under investigation. In the piece extending from Aksığın Village in the south of Gölcük to Pamukova in the southeast, Paleozoic units are in fragmented heaps as the top cover. During the research of the Veysel Dayı and Cirbin Ali caves, located on the slopes of Aytepe, south of the Yuvacık Dam in Kocaeli, it was reported that there were caves in Aksığın Village. Upon this notice, the sinkhole in the mentioned village was examined by BUMAK in 2002. Since we learned much later that its name was Cinlikuyu, this sinkhole was named “Aksığın Cave” at that time and its map was published in DELTA 7, page 20. During our later visits, we learned that this cave was called Cinlikuyu, and that the cave, which was named ‘Köprü Cave’ at the end of the above-mentioned report, was named ‘Aksıkın Cave’. Therefore, cavers from İTÜMAK are right in drawing the map you see on the left. Even if they searched in the inventory, they wouldn’t be able to find another Cinlikuyu map. On the other hand, since Emrah Çoraman’s map published in DELTA 7 is in BCRA 1A standard, it would be very appropriate to draw a new map. The only point that is difficult to understand on the İTÜMAK map is how the depth in a completely vertical cave is -59 m, while the length is 102 m. In fact, this cave continues with horizontal meanders after the -59 m descent and has a third map. We did not include it here because it is a plan, not a cross section, but this plan, including meanders, was published in OBRUK 1. According to this plan, Cinlikuyu is 482 m long and -72 m deep. Looks like a third (or fourth) map is needed.\n\nCUMAYANI CAVE MAPS Cumayanı – Zonguldak The cave was formed in the Lower Cretaceous Kapuz Formation, which is the most karstic unit of the region. This formation, which contains limestones with abundant fractures, is touching with another formation consisting of flysch of the same age right in front of the cave. A fault line passing in the immediate vicinity of the cave pushed the limestones onto the flysch and caused an impermeable layer to form. Cumayanı Cave, which is the last link of the system that drains the surface and ground waters of a wide river basin, has two separate entrances. There is a fossil entrance 20 meters above the active mouth where the water comes out. These two entrances converge after a certain distance. The cave, with a total length of 1100 meters, developed in the northwest-southeast direction from the beginning to the end of the great fossil hall. The first scientific research of Cumayani Cave was carried out by Temuçin Aygen in 1975. It was roughly mapped by SCP member Eric Gilli in 1977 and fully mapped by Trent Polytechnic University in 1978 (Watkins, 1980). It was then surveyed and drawn again by the MTA in 1995 (Nazik et al., 1995). These two maps, 17 years apart, are very close to each other, and this measurement quality is admirable for such a long and difficult cave. It’s just that the two small side branches that appear at the entrance on the Trent Polytechnic map are not available on the MTA map. So, why are the halls on the two cave maps so different from each other, with all the galleries so similar in direction and length?\n\nÇAYIRKÖY CAVE MAPS Çayırköy - Çaycuma - Zonguldak The first map of Çayırköy Cave was drawn in 1988 during the joint work of MAD with Kaufmann and Laumanns (Laumanns and Kaufmann, 1988, Laumanns and Ozbek, 1990). You see this map at the top of the side page. The lower map is the 1995 MTA study (Nazik et al., 1995). The lengths of both maps are close to each other; 1282 m and 1150 m. The two maps are almost identical, except for the slight difference in the orientation of the gallery that extends to the east.\n\nDAZDAĞI SINKHOLE MAPS Sofular - Zonguldak The map on the top, where the Sofular Stream sinks and siphons in the further part of the sinkhole, was drawn in 1988 during the collaboration of MAD with Kaufmann and Laumanns (Laumanns and Kaufmann, 1988, Laumanns and Özbek, 1990). The map on the bottom is the 1995 MTA study (Nazik et al., 1995). Both teams mapped Çayırköy Cave, which you can see on the previous page, and both worked in this cave almost at the same time as Çayırköy Cave. Well, what could be the reason why these teams, who were able to draw two similar maps of a cave of 1150 m in length like Çayırköy, drew two maps that were not so similar to each other in this cave which has a total length of 210 m? Let’s say Sofular Stream is drawn to the south of the map below -unnecessarily- and this part is missing on the MTA map on the right. And, again, let’s say the waters were less in the season the MTA was measuring, and the siphoning north part of their chart might be longer. So, why are the two halls inside the cave so different on both maps?\n\nDOMBRA CAVE MAPS Gündoğmuş – Antalya Two different profiles of a sinkhole on the Central Taurus plateau, 40 km north of Gündoğmuş, drawn one year apart. On the left is the 2012 İZMAD study, on the right is the 2013 İZMAD – Poland joint activity. In the profile on the left, the sinkhole reached 348 m and continues. The following year, the ongoing part narrowed and ended. So far everything is normal. The abnormal point is that the depth of the cave, which was -348 m in the first profile you see on the left, decreased to -252 m the next year. Since the sections are very different from each other, we cannot predict the actual depth of the last point reached in 2012 by looking at the 2013 map. But, in any case, the error of 100 m in a 300 m deep cave is unbelievable. The nice thing is that both maps belong to the same club and they corrected their mistake a year later.\n\nDEDE TARLASI SINKHOLE MAPS Çamlık – Derebucak - Konya At the bottom you see the map drawn by the Swindon Speleological Society in 1992 (Stratford and Crabbe, 1992), and at the top 1993 map of MTA (Nazik et al., 1993). The maps of this cave, which is more than 500 m long, have a difference of only 10 m, and they are two very close maps. There is only a slight difference in orientation between the two maps on the west-turning branch of the main gallery. We did not know whether the branch, which is at the southernmost part of the map and turns west just after the entrance, connects to the main gallery as drawn by the MTA or not as drawn by Swindon.\n\nDOMUZDERE CAVE MAPS Vize – Kırklareli On the left we see the 2009 BUMAK map of the cave (Çoraman, 2013), and on the right we see the 1998 MTA map of the same cave (Nazik et al., 1998). The scales and directions are the same. There is some orientation error between the MTA and BUMAK maps in the part they draw, but the really interesting question may be why the MTA did not continue to search and measure in such a prominent gallery. After the point where the MTA map left off, the cave continues to the northwest with the same gallery width and its total length is more than the double of MTA map. If we say that there was a narrow passage at the point where the MTA terminated the work, and they couldn’t see it, such a narrowing does not appear on the BUMAK map.\n\nDÖLLEK SINKHOLE - DÖLLÜKÖĞÜ CAVE MAPS Çamlık – Derebucak - Konya At the bottom you see the map of the Swindon Speleological Society (Stratford and Crabbe, 1992) and at the top the map of the MTA (Nazik et al., 1993). Except for minor differences in the name of the cave and the hall at the entrance of the maps, both maps are almost the same. What is even more interesting is that both maps were drawn in the same year, 1992, and the total length of both is exactly the same; to be 286 m!\n\nDÖNGEL CAVE MAPS Döngel – Kahramanmaraş These are the maps of Döngel Cave, which is an active aquifer in the Döngel Village in the north of Kahramanmaraş. The bottom map was drawn in 1982 by Hüsam Süleymangil and Gürsel Tarba, members of BUMAK, who went to Kahramanmaraş to train the scouts in the region, and - for some reason - was not published. The other two maps were drawn unaware of each other and the first map. In the middle you can see the map drawn by MTA in 2008 and on the top by OBRUK in 2011 (Törk and Savaş, 2008, Yamaç, 2011). Inside the cave, there was another gallery, accessed through a small hole in the north wall of the main gallery, and this fossil gallery climbing to the northeast was much larger than the main active gallery of the cave. The absence of this side gallery on the MTA map, which was found and surveyed by two young cavers in 1983 and then by us in 2011, is a good example in terms of showing the results of a small hole that was overlooked during the measurement. The maps of Domuzdere and Balatini caves above show you similar results about paying attention—or not—to your surroundings during a cave survey. You will see worse on the maps of Kadıini Cave below.\n\nDÜDENCİK CAVE MAPS Cevizli – Antalya Düdencik Cave, found by SCP in 1968 and measured and mapped in the same year, was the deepest cave in Turkey with a depth of -330 m until 1989, the first year of the Çukurpınar Sinkhole survey (Bakalowicz, 1968). Above you can see the plan and section of Düdencik drawn by Michel Bakalowicz in 1968. The same cave was re-measured and mapped in 1987 in the joint activity of Spanish La Senyera and BUMAK. This second team knew that the cave had been mapped before and this second measurement was planned purely as a check and confirmation study. At the end of the La Senyera – BÜMAK study, the depth of Düdencik was measured as -325 m, but Düdencik Cave is still written as -330 m in all lists out of respect for the team that carried out this measurement under difficult conditions years ago. When we compare these two maps, which are not at the same scale, it is seen that the La Senyera – BUMAK profile is much more detailed than Bakalowicz. On the other hand, both plans are almost identical, except for the ascending gallery arms at the end of the cave.\n\nERKİBET SINKHOLE MAPS Avason - Manavgat – Antalya French SCP member cavers found and began exploring the Erkibet Sinkhole in 1977. The cave was completed the following year. The map on the left is from Jacques Chabert’s 1979 article in Grottes et Gouffres (Chabert, 1979b). A year later, the Italian Gruppo Speleologica Piemontese measured and mapped the same cave again (Eusebio, 1980). The first descent is identical and both sections are very similar. However, in the Italian team’s measurement the depth of the cave increased by 10 m and reached -60 m.\n\nFASIH SINKHOLE MAPS Susuz – Seydişehir – Konya Four more maps! And of a small cave -50 m deep. The first map of the Fasih Sinkhole near Suğla, which terminates with a siphon, is by Bakalowicz and was drawn in 1970, as you can see in the upper right corner (Bakalowicz, 1970). Then, in 1976, cavers from Sheffield and Leeds Universities drew it again during a joint activity in the region (Skuce et al., 1977). You can see this map at the bottom right. The same team will measure and draw Tınaztepe and Gölcük sinkholes after Fasıh. The plan in the top center belongs to Czech cavers and was drawn in 1990 (Schmidt, 1991). Finally, MTA came in 1991 and drew the plan you see on the left and the profile below it (Nazik et al., 1993). Let’s ignore the profiles of these maps for a moment and just look at the plans. Although the first part of all four plans is more or less similar, the gallery that follows is different in each map. Just compare the MTA and Czech plans next to each other. On the other hand, the Bakalowicz map in the upper right corner resembles the entrance part of the other maps, but in this map the cave is siphoned at -12 m. However, in the MTA and Czech maps the beginning of the siphon is much deeper, at -50 m. We can assume that the water level was higher before and during Bakalowicz’s first exploration in 1970, the Fasıh Sinkhole was filled with water up to the level labeled “-14” in the section of the MTA map on the lower left. Moreover, although the section drawings are not very similar to the MTA, in the Sheffield and Leeds section at the bottom right, the siphon starts at -20 m.\n\nFELENGİ CAVE MAPS Koçaş - Altınekin - Konya In fact, the place names on both maps are correct. Asmaköy is now a neighborhood of Koçaş and Felengi Cave is located on the plateau north of Asmaköy. The map on the bottom was drawn by the FFS in 1973. The top map is the result of the work of the Belgian UBS group in 1994, 1995 and 1996. The siphon starts at the hall at the entrance of the cave and continues throughout the cave. For this reason, the first team’s map includes only the entrance hall up to the point where the siphon starts. However, the southeastward branch, which the UBS team found and measured in the dry gallery, is omitted in the FFS map below.\n\nFERZENE – FERZİNE CAVE MAPS Seydişehir - Konya Top, a map drawn by Michel Bakalowicz in 1971 (Chabert, 1972a) and bottom, another map of the same cave drawn by MTA in 1980 (Güldalı et al., 1980). Although they are very similar to each other, the Bakalowicz map has some minor problems in both orientation and drawing details. Especially the details of the central part of the cave are missing. We could not understand why the north arrows of both maps are 1800 different from each other. As you can see a few examples in this book, the cave map with an inverted north should be a ‘Mirror’ compared to the other map, but in these two examples, the maps are facing the same direction and the drawings are very similar, but the norths are inverted. Probably the north arrow of one of the maps was drawn incorrectly.\n\nFEYZULLAH CAVE – SINKHOLE MAPS Derebucak - Konya This cave, one of the sinkholes in Kembos Polje, was first mapped by Bakalowicz in 1966 (Bakalowicz, 1967). You can see this first map on the left. On the right is the map drawn by the Swindon Speleological Society 25 years later in 1992 (Stratford and Crabbe, 1992). Although both maps of this 400 m long cave look similar at first glance, the difference in the drawings of the side branch just west of the northern entrance is incredible. On the other hand, it is not clear in Bakalowicz’s map that the cave terminates in the south of the map.\n\nGİRMELER CAVE MAPS Girmeler – Fethiye – Muğla The map you see at the top on the left was taken from an article written by Fabrizio Bosco and published in Società di Studi Carsici’s journal in 2008. Girmeler Cave is also called “Alexander’s Cave” by the local people. Because we didn’t know about this map before, as OBRUK Cave Research Group, we mapped this double cave system in 2013. You can see this map on the left, middle. Then, in 2019, the DEUMAK / İZMAD team mapped the same cave. Although the maps of the western cave are almost identical, there are serious differences in the eastern cave. In this cave, the different drawings in the first bend and the last part of the gallery are striking. In the DEUMAK / IZMAD map the cave narrows and ends, whereas in the OBRUK map there is a 20 m long chamber at the end. If you notice, we didn’t even compare the top map with the other two maps. It is doubtful that Fabrizio Bosco even used a compass or a meter during the survey when preparing this map. At best, it is a BCRA 1A grade cave map.\n\nGÖKDELİ (MIZRAK) CAVE MAPS Pınarbaşı - Kastamonu ASPEG map from 2008 on top and FACC map from 1992 on the bottom. One is BCRA 2B, the other is BCRA 4D. Despite this difference in the quality of the measurement, the profiles are almost identical. If you turn the plans in the same direction, you will see that they are almost identical too. The depths are also close, the problem is in the lengths: 241 m and 195 m. In such a small cave with such similar maps, there should not be a 46 m difference in length. This is a problem we come across all the time in double cave maps. But, what is the ‘length’ of a cave? Is it the total length between stations? Then take a look at the two different ways of survey in the gallery of an imaginary cave below.\n\nThere are two different survey techniques here. Actually both are correct, but it is clear that the green survey is almost 50% longer than the red one. It doesn’t matter which computer program you use. The program will add up the length between the stations and give you a total length meter. So, in other words, the length of this gallery will be 64 meters according to the red survey and 96 meters according to the green survey. Now, the same question again: What is the ‘length’ of a cave and what will be the length of this gallery ?\n\nGÖKGÖL CAVE MAPS Erçek - Zonguldak Gökgöl Cave has three entrances, two fossilized and one active. The small mouth 10 meters below the main entrance at the top is flooded from time to time after sudden rains. The youngest mouth of the cave is located at the edge of the Erçek Stream. This third mouth is hydrologically active and very narrow. Apart from the main gallery developed in east-west direction, Gökgöl Cave consists of two large side branches. The main gallery with its end point at +10 meters relative to the entrance ends with a narrow siphon. The southern gallery diverging from the Great Collapse Hall terminates at + 17 meters, while the semi-active northern gallery, which turns north and makes a wide arc, terminates at + 21 meters. The Great Depression Hall is the junction point of all the tributaries. The width of the side branches in the hydrologically active zone and the second part of the main gallery after the collapse varies between 1-5 m and the ceiling height between 1 - 8 m. On the other hand, the section from the entrance to the Great Collapse Hall is wider and higher (Nazik et al., 1995). This 875-meter section has been opened for tourism purposes. There are walking trails, bridges and viewing terraces in this illuminated area. The active underground stream continues to flow under the walking paths. The first exploration of Gökgöl Cave was made by French and Turkish cavers in July 1977 and mapped by Trent Polytechnic the following year (Watkins, 1980). It was resurveyed and redrawn by MTA in 1995 (Nazik et al., 1995). When we compare these two maps, we see that the gallery extending to the southernmost point is longer in the Trent map than in the MTA map, whereas the gallery continuing to the east is longer and more detailed in the MTA map. If we ignore these small details, these two maps of Gökgöl Cave are almost identical. While there are big differences in the maps of much smaller caves, it is interesting that the two maps of this cave with a total length of 3,350 m are so similar.\n\nGÖLCÜK SINKHOLE MAPS Arvana – Seydişehir – Konya Another impressive example of cave mapping in Turkey is these maps of Gölcük Sinkhole. Located between Seydisehir and Akseki, in the middle of the Taurus Mountains, close to the road and easily accessible, this sinkhole, which is about -140 m deep, has been remapped over the years by every team passing by. So far we were able to find (from bottom to top) maps of Italian, French, British and German cavers (Agnoletti et al., 1970, Chabert, 1972a, Schmitt, 1976, Skuce et al., 1977). It is possible that maps of other “explorers” will appear in the future. All these maps are a sad consequence of not researching the area in advance and not doing source work. If you look at the maps, you will see that the depth and cross-section of the sinkhole is different in each map. The plans drawn by British and German cavers are also very different from each other.\n\nGÜMÜŞDERE SINKHOLE MAPS Gümüşdere-Tavas-Denizli Although what you see on the left are two very different plans and profiles of the same sinkole, the preparation purposes are different, so the evaluation should be made taking this criterion into consideration. While the plan and profile you see above were drawn by DEUMAK - IZMAD primarily for the purpose of preparing a cave map, the drawing below accompanies Kadir Tuncer’s scientific article (Tuncer, 2023). We will not even object to the different measurements written. In the upper map, the widest diameter is 300 m and the narrowest diameter is 125 m, while in the lower map the ‘length’ is 397 m. It can be, this is a very large and amorphous sinkhole and these differences are natural. But, by a strange coincidence, the scale bars of both maps are incorrect. On the map above, ‘100’ is written right in the middle of the scale bar. If this means that the second mark is 100 m and the entire scale bar is 200 m, the widest diameter of Gümüşdere Sinkhole is 560 m, not 300 m as written. On the other hand, the whole scale bar in Kadir Tuncer’s map below is 4 m! It is an error that doesn’t suit a scientific article at all and is more to be laughed at than criticized.\n\nGÜRCÜOLUK – KARAKAÇAK CAVE MAPS Amasra – Bartın The north of the BUMAK map dated 1993 (Erdem, 1993) on the top has been translated by us to match the MTA map dated 1998 on the bottom. The scales are the same and the total length of the cave is 191 m and 169 m. Although there is a difference of 22 m between the two maps, we should be grateful that the difference between the total lengths of the two cave maps, which are so dissimilar, is around 10%. Can two maps of a relatively short cave with two halls and double entrances be so different from each other? Although the hall and the side branch from the western entrance are more or less similar on both maps, the halls following the eastern entrance have nothing to do with each other on both maps. The MTA map below has too much detail, which makes it difficult to make a comparison.\n\nGÜRLEK CAVE MAPS Şile – İstanbul The map of Gürlek Cave on the left was published in Delta 8 and according to the article in the magazine, it was drawn in 2006. Although there is a long description in the magazine, the fact that there is no information on the map, from the name of the cave to the drawers and even the north arrow, suggests that this map is a draft. The map of Gürlek Cave on the right was drawn by Ertek in 1996 and published in his book on Şile. Since the BUMAK map on the left does not have a north arrow, we only converted this map from horizontal to vertical and brought both maps to the same scale. Although the names of the team that measured and drew the Gürlek Cave map prepared by BUMAK are not on the map, they are mentioned in the article. We can assume that this map prepared by this highly knowledgeable and experienced team is more accurate than Ertek’s map. On the other hand, the question of why such an experienced team published such a draft map remains unanswered. Let’s come to another issue: Although these two cave maps do not resemble each other at all, the BUMAK map ends with a siphon in the main gallery, whereas Ertek’s map is much longer and apparently continues after the siphon. As a result; the orientation, branches, gallery length, in other words, almost everything is different between the two maps.\n\nGÜRLEVİK – BAŞLAR CAVE MAPS Başlar – Akseki – Antalya As if we don’t have enough problems, the situation becomes even more complicated when there are two different caves with the same name in two different places, and when there are several different maps of these caves with the same name, and when none of these maps resemble one another. Anyway, the 2397 m long Gürlevik Cave in Taşkale, Karaman, which was mapped by Krieg in 1990, was eliminated from this list without leaving any room for doubt, as it is different from the other three Gürlevik maps in every respect. In order to confirm that the remaining three Gürlevik maps belong to the same cave, the cave located in the village of Başlar in Akseki, we even had to read the reports in which they were published. In fact, except for the map of the Czech Geospeleos Club dated 1990, which you can see at the bottom, we did not need to examine the reports of the other two maps because Akseki - Başlar is written on the other two maps. The oldest map at the top was drawn by Michel Bakalowicz in 1967 (Bakalowicz, 1967). A Turkish copy of this map was presented by M. Atalay and O. Baltan at the “International Symposium on Karst Hydrogeology” congress held in Oymapınar in 1979 (Atalay and Baltan, 1979). The other map of Gürlevik (Başlar) in the centre belongs to Gerhartd Schmitt and was drawn in 1983. The third map at the bottom is from Geospeleos’ 1990 study. In their report, this team mentioned that they saw a bolt on the wall at the entrance, nevertheless they continued their exploration and reached a length of 866 m (Schmidt, 1991). All three maps have the same orientation and scale. The only explanation we can think of is that there are three different caves with water outlets and siphons in Başlar Village of Akseki!\n\nGÜVERCİNLİK CAVE MAPS Güneysınır – Çumra – Konya In his article titled “Güneysınır Güvercinlik Cave” in MAD Bulletin no 12, pp 68-70, Emrah Sınmaz states that two different caves were mentioned to him by local guides during the surveys conducted in the region in 1994 and 1996. In the first cave mentioned, “Obruk”, a bolt was found at -50 m. The other cave was “Güvercinlik”. This cave, which was not found in the first search, was later travelled three times and was measured and mapped. However, Güvercinlik Cave had been mapped two more times before this survey by MAD. The first map of the cave on the left is the one drawn by Gerhard Schmitt in 1984 and the name of the cave is ‘Fossil Cave’ (Schmitt, 1984). The other map in the centre was drawn by Swiss cavers Thoma and Scheurer in 1988. Considering the fact that the same name is used in this second map and that a name like ‘Fossil Cave’ cannot be local, it can be assumed that the Swiss cavers were aware of Gerhard Schmitt’s work. The sections are very similar, even the 51 m descent is the same. On the other hand, both the descent and the hall section of MAD’s map dated 1996 are very different from the other two maps. On the other hand, the depth is approximately the same in all three maps.\n\nILGARİNİ CAVE MAPS Sümenler – Pınarbaşı - Kastamonu Ilgarini Cave, located in the Küre Mountains National Park, north of Sümenler Village of Pınarbaşı, can be reached by a 4-hour walk in a dense forest. The cave consists of two sections, the fossil horizontal section and the active vertical section. The horizontal section with a total length of 400 metres and high ceilings is divided by a chimney and the vertical section begins below the chimney. The wide arm of the horizontal section extending westwards after the chimney is decorated with stalactites and stalagmites. There are three descents requiring technical equipment after the part where the remains of the cemetery are located, which can be reached by walking with a sloping arm. Ilgarini is not very active today. From a depth of -150 metres, remarkable travertine formations are encountered in places. Ilgarini was discovered by Prof. Cemal Arif Alagöz in 1940 and published on pages 12-13 of his work “Karst Events of Turkey” (Alagöz, 1944). The cave was investigated and mapped by BUMAK in 1982 and published in Delta 1 (Çetin et al., 1983, Ülkümen, 1983). In this map, the length of the cave was given as 858 m and the depth as -250 m. This depth of -250 m made Ilgarini the 3rd deepest cave in Turkey for that year. In 1990, the British team of Leicester University Speleological Society (LUSS) visited the cave and drew another map. In this map, the total length of the cave was measured as 1131 metres and the depth as -240 metres (Holland, 1990, Kay, 1990). Although at first glance the two maps look quite similar, it is difficult to understand the 273 m difference in length between them. Also, if you look carefully at the LUSS section, you will see that there is a side gallery in the centre of the descent in this drawing, which is not present in the BUMAK map, and ‘?’ marks at three different points. Let us add without comment that the standard of the LUSS map is ‘BCRA 5B’, which means ±10 slope accuracy and ±10 cm length error at each station, and it should also be noted that it cannot be ‘B’ of BCRA 5, 5 can only be drawn as ‘C’ or ‘D’.\n\nILIKSU CAVE MAPS Kozlu – Zonguldak It is a horizontal spring cave; developed on the slope where the beach dunes formed by the alluvium of the Iliksu Stream meet the limestones; on the edge of the Inçatı Stream. The last 25 m section of the cave at +8 m relative to the entrance was developed in sandstone and claystone. The underground stream flowing through the cave enters the cave through the narrow siphon in this last section by boiling in the form of a vocclus. There is no significant dripstone accumulation in the cave. However; wall and curtain dripstones; small sized stalactites and pools have developed in some areas. Below you can see the map of MTA dated 1995 (Nazik et al., 1995) and above you can see the other map drawn in 1989 by the joint work of MAD and Hungarian teams. These are two completely different maps, from the orientation to the details, as if they were maps of two different caves. Anyway, the Hungarians modestly wrote that the map is a “sketch”. How can a 600 m long cave map with 19 sections be a “sketch”?\n\nİNAĞZI CAVE MAPS İnağzı – Zonguldak Inağzı is a cave in Zonguldak, within the city. It is located on the 15th km of the Kilimli road, on the sea shore and the mouth of the cave is just above the railway line. The cave developed in the Apsian aged Kapuz Formation; which has lithostratigraphic features suitable for karstification and cave development in the Zonguldak region; is an important form of the Pliocene relief system. The cave; which has a total length of 793 m; is entered through a fossil mouth facing the sea. From 50 m onwards; it continues with an underground stream after a hole where a human can barely fit. At 400 m there is a siphon and it can be crossed by walking during the low tide. From here it continues for another 393 m and ends with another siphon. You can see the maps of MTA dated 1995 (Nazik et al., 1995) on the bottom and MAD dated 1981 on the top. Forget the plans for a moment, even the cross sections do not resemble each other. There are serious directional and sketch differences in the plans. Considering that both maps are in the same scale, it can be seen that the length of the hall at the entrance is quite different on the two maps. There are also big differences in the ongoing orientation of the gallery.\n\nİNALTI CAVE MAPS Ayancık – Sinop The cave is located near the village of Inalti, about 35 km from Ayancik District. It is accessible by a dirt road with a beautiful view. The distance between Inalti Village and the cave is about 400-450 m. Inalti Cave starts with a wide and high entrance; and maintains this characteristic until the 350-400 m section. The cave has a width of 3-6 m and a height of 5-25 m and continues as a big tunnel. In the first 350 - 400 m section; there are travertines on the walls and small and large stalactites in places. The total length of the cave is 625 m; after 400 m it is watery and muddy. Above you can see the MTA map dated 1998; below you can see the ANMAK map dated 1995. The north of the ANMAK map was rotated by us and the scales were levelled. There is not much to say. Yes, like the cavers of ANMAK, all young cavers should start drawing cave maps from somewhere, but it would be very useful to pay more attention to the maps, especially if they are going to be published. There are many deficiencies and mistakes in the ANMAK map, but the most important one is that it is a ‘mirror’. If MTA’s measurement direction is correct, ANMAK’s compass direction is completely wrong. When you measure a cave, if you enter the compass direction in reverse during the drawing, the map of the cave will be inverted, even if the north is correct, and this is called ‘Mirror’. We could have reversed ANMAK’s drawing and put it in the right direction, but we wanted you to see the mistake. On the other hand, it is interesting that ANMAK, despite all these mistakes and rough drawings, wrote the ‘4C’ standard on its map. MTA measured the cave as 658 m, while ANMAK measured it as 625 m.\n\nİNKESE CAVE MAPS Şile – İstanbul On the left, a 1995 map of the Inkese Cave in Şile by T.A. Ertek, and on the right, another map of the same cave drawn by ITUMAK cavers in 2018. The ITUMAK map was rotated to match Ertek to the north, the two maps were brought to the same scale and the lower exit mouth was aligned. It can be seen that the cavers from ITUMAK made a great contribution to Ertek’s map. In addition to mapping the gallery extending from the entrance to the northwest in detail, they also measured the previously unexplored side branches. On the other hand; to his credit, Ertek’s map is also a very carefully drawn map showing the structural features inside the cave, water inlets and unexplored tributaries. The main problem is that these two maps do not resemble each other. If you wish, let’s leave aside the galleries newly discovered by İTÜMAK in this cave and analyse the area between the entrance and exit mouths of İnkese Cave: We wrote above that the two maps are on the same scale. If we align the maps from the lower mouth, the upper mouths do not align. On the ITUMAK map, the upper mouth is about 50 metres lower than Ertek. Of course, the “orientation to the north” error between the two maps is also a factor in the non-alignment of the mouths, but the mouths are not aligned even if we superimpose them. Probably one of these maps has not only a compass error but also a metric error.\n\nİNÖĞÜ İNİ – İNÖNÜ CAVE MAPS Kurucaova – Isparta Located 4 km east of Kurucaova Village in a mountainous region, this cave has small lakes. At the bottom, you can see the first map of this cave drawn by Fiorentini Rusconi, which was explored by the Italian Circolo Speleologico Romano in 1970. The other map in the centre was drawn by Claude Chabert in 1979. These two maps, which are not to the same scale, are very similar except for the western gallery which was not explored by the French team. There are some slight differences in the cross-sections, but these differences can be easily overlooked when the other ‘double maps’ are considered (Agnoletti P et al 1970; Chabert C 1979). The third map at the top was drawn by ASPEG in 2011; there are no cross sections, but the plan is almost identical to the other two maps except for minor differences.\n\nİNSUYU CAVE MAPS Burdur Insuyu Cave is located 13 km east of Burdur on the slope of Sarpgüney Hill overlooking the Çine Plain. This region where the cave is located has a very complex geological structure. The lithological units observed in the vicinity of Insuyu Cave can be divided into two main categories as autochthonous and allochthonous units. The autochthonous units are mainly composed of Upper Cretaceous aged Söbüdağ and Senirce formations, Plio-Quaternary aged travertine and alluvial deposits. Structural anomalies, which are the most basic characteristics of the advanced tectonic activation in the region, are frequently found in the lithostratigraphic stack. Scientific research in Insuyu Cave started in 1952 with Dr Temuçin Aygen. Insuyu Cave was opened to visitors in 1966 as Turkey’s first touristic cave and many different scientific studies have been carried out in the cave. Some of the scientific studies were conducted by Paolo Marcello Brignoli (Brignoli, 1971, Brignoli, 1972, Brignoli, 1973) and Friederike Spitzenberger (Spitzenberger, 1973). The first detailed map of the cave was drawn in 1968. None of the small side galleries are visible on this map prepared by Murat Basar. On the other hand, the narrow passage to the northeast of Büyük Göl, which provides access to the second non-touristy part of the cave, is present (Nazik et al., 1999). It is strange that this passage was only known in 1968, but this part of the cave was not explored until 1993. There are seven different maps of the touristic and non-touristic parts of Insuyu Cave. As a result of the project initiated by OBRUK in 2011 to eliminate the deficiencies in these maps and to draw a new map, many new discoveries were made and the length of Insuyu Cave exceeded 8.350 m (Yamaç, 2013b, Yamaç and Eğrikavuk, 2013). In this book, we have chosen to publish only the oldest and most recent maps of Insuyu Cave, and only the touristic part of the 2011 OBRUK map.\n\nKADIİNİ – KADIPINARI CAVE MAPS Alanya – Antalya Located 15 km northeast of Alanya, on the rocky wall near the Oba Stream and 40 m above the stream, Kadıini Cave has a semi-active structure suspended as a result of the erosion and deepening of the bed of this stream (Siler, 2016). The underground stream flowing inside Kadıini Cave has also deepened its bed continuously over time and today it continues to flow approximately 20-30 m below the entrance of the cave. The cavity formed by the erosion of this underground stream formed a large hall at the entrance of Kadıini Cave with the collapse of the weakened ceiling. The entire floor of this hall, which measures approximately 120x40 m, is covered with large rocks broken off from the ceiling (Güldalı et al., 1987). A narrow side branch, which can hardly be found among the rocks on the north wall of the hall, extends for hundreds of metres. Dozens of skeletons and potsherds were found in a small room 120 m from the beginning of this gallery covered with stalactites, stalagmites and travertines. Probably due to the difficulty of finding this side branch, these finds, which were preserved undisturbed until recently, were first discovered by the cavers of AKÜMAK. Archaeological studies were carried out in Kadıini Cave by Kılıç Kökten in 1956-1957. After the cave was explored and mapped by MTA in 1987 under the name ‘Kadıpınarı’, it was remapped by AKÜMAK 20 years later. On the left page, you can see the MTA plan dated 1987 on the top right and AKÜMAK plan dated 2007 on the left. These two maps, which are in the same scale and orientation, have no close or distant similarities with each other. On the other hand, there was no need to put the third map below here. After all, we were comparing two different maps of the hall at the entrance of Kadıini Cave. However, a side branch that the previous cavers did not notice during the measurement was so long that the hall, whose plans you see above in this last map you see below, now fit into a tiny box at the bottom of this new map. With this last map drawn by AKÜMAK in 2020, Kadıini Cave reached a length of 2676 m and this map is very important in terms of showing the results of a side branch that was overlooked during the measurement.\n\nKARAGÖL CAVE MAPS Elmalı –Antalya Karagöl Düden Cave is located about 5 km south of Elmalı District and on the side of the Finike road. This active sinkhole, which drains the water of the entire Elmalı Plain, has been known in the caving community for many years. A regulator was built at the mouth of the cave by DSI to regulate the flow rate of the incoming water. After the water enters the cave, it disappears in narrow and vertical cracks. In order to dry Karagöl, located in the middle of Elmalı Plain, DSI connected the lake basin to the sinkholes and Avlan Lake, which covers the south of Elmalı Plain, with channels. Flood waters coming to Karagöl during winter and spring months flow into Karagöl Sinkhole through channels. In order for the sinkholes to draw more water, the sinkhole entrance was widened and sliding covers were installed to control the water flow. After these procedures, the mouth of Karagöl Sinkhole has completely changed. Karagöl Düden Cave was first explored by Temuçin Aygen in 1958. The water leading to the cave was blocked by a dike in the plain and entrance was provided. In 1965, London Caving Club came for research, but the research was left unfinished due to rain. There are three separate maps of this sinkhole drawn on different dates. Interestingly, the MTA map at the bottom and the Czech map in the middle were drawn in the same year, 1990. The map above, prepared by the Italian team, is dated 1994. It is also interesting that both the MTA and the Italians missed the northern branch, which the Czechs found and measured in this very short and easy cave.\n\nKARAKOVUK CAVE MAPS Marmaris – Muğla It is possible to reach this cave, located near İçmeler Village, both by sea and by road. It was developed on a fracture within the Cretaceous aged massive and occasionally hornstein limestones. Limestone has a partially conglomerate structure. The cave was explored by MTA in 1984 and the map you see on the right was drawn (Güldalı, 1985). The map on the left was made by MAD in 2017, 33 years after this work of MTA. In this second map, the length of the cave increased from 53 m to 69 m. These are two very similar maps, except for minor differences that can be ignored.\n\nKARLIK SINKHOLE MAPS Ovacuma – Safranbolu - Zonguldak veya Ulus – Bartın This book contains double maps of three different caves drawn by the same club. One of them is this, the other two are sections of Dombra and Church sinkholes. BÜMAK cavers measured and drew the cave again in 2019, probably to correct the deficiencies in the 1989 map. The location problem experienced in the other Uluyayla cave maps you can see below is also present in this pair of maps on the same plateau. On the other hand, the depth of the sinkhole reached -170 m from -115 m with this new map. By investigating the upper branch immediately after the entrance and connecting it to -120 m, the part that was not explored and therefore not drawn on the 1989 map was resolved. Measurements and depths match each other, as a result, both maps are quite successful. On the other hand, the “section of the section” problem, which is frequently encountered in cave section drawings, is clearly visible in the 2019 map, and when the problem of drawing descents is added to these “sections of the section”, the already complicated sections become even more incomprehensible.\n\nKELEBEKLİ CAVE MAPS Akseki - Antalya Located near Topraktepe Village of Akseki, this cave, which is -50 m deep and 150 m long, continues with narrow passages and ends with a siphon, and there are three different maps of the cave drawn to date. The first map below was drawn by Michel Bakalowicz in 1967, during the first research (Bakalowicz, 1967). It was then remeasured and mapped by an Italian team in 1973 (Biondi, 1978/1980). The third map you see at the top was drawn by British RRCPC member cavers in 1974 (Oldham, 1974). Despite the lack of detail in the Bakalowicz map, there is an unnecessary abundance of detail in the British map. Just as we did not include the 20 sections on this map here, we also did not understand the logic of including 20 sections in the plan of a 150 m cave. It creates visual pollution, to say the least.\n\nKEPEZ CAVE MAPS Silifke – Mersin There are two different maps of this 367 m long cave, located in Silifke, Keşlitürkmen Village, drawn by Hungarian cavers in 1990 (Attila and Bolner-Takacsne, 1991) and by MTA in 2011. Since we could not obtain a clean copy of the Hungarians’ map, we drew again from the damaged copy. For this reason, the interior details of the cave are not available, only its contour. Did you say, “When we compare the two maps, we see that the orientation, length and even the details are similar - except for minor differences”? Look a little more carefully if you wish. Yes, the main gallery is quite similar, except for the shape of the entrance hall. So, why is the hall that the Hungarians found and mapped after the westward part of the cave not on the MTA map? Possibly, as in the Döngel and Sofular caves, MTA missed a branch branch again.\n\nKIZILELMA CAVE MAPS Ayiçi – Zonguldak Kızılelma Cave is a spring cave developed within the Lower Cretaceous aged and abundantly fractured limestones, which are commonly observed in this part of Zonguldak. The same old impermeable layer underneath this limestone layer is a karst base level. Faults in the region have been effective in the formation and development of karst shapes on the surface and the extension of caves. Kızılelma Cave has two different entrances: The main entrance is on the eastern slope of the Kızılelma cave. This entrance, located 5 meters above the Uvala floor, is on a clear fault line and is completely fossilized. The second entrance is a -85 m deep sinkhole 1.5 km north of the main entrance and goes down to the middle of the cave. The first part of the cave, up to the branch branch to the east, developed in the southwest-northeast direction. Debris, sand and gravel accumulations in this section, which has water inflow from four different points, cover a large area. Among these, there are pools or ponds of different sizes. The surface waters coming to the Kızılelma uvala do not enter the cave directly, but go underground through the dolines in front of the entrance. Since these dolines cannot quickly absorb the water coming into the basin during rainy periods, the uvala turns into a lake. These waters, which descend underground from the dolines, enter the cave after about 250 meters. A small part of the Uvala waters enters the Kızılelma Cave from a small branch, and this 400-meter section right after the entrance is the place with the lowest ceiling height of the Kızılelma Cave. After the point where the main gallery meets the side branch coming from the east, the cave takes a northwest direction. The ceiling height of this part, where the amount of flowing water increases significantly, is much higher than the first part and reaches 20 m in places (Nazik et al., 1995). You see three excellent maps side by side of a cave that is more than six kilometers long and very difficult to explore. At the bottom, there is the 1978 map of Trent Polytechnic, which conducted the first research of the cave (Watkins, 1980), in the middle, there is the 1987 BÜMAK - La Senyara joint study, and at the top, MTA’s 1995 maps (Nazik et al., 1995). Yes, there are minor differences in the MTA map, such as a small branch extending to the east, which is probably newly discovered, but these three maps of Kızılelma are a work beyond all appreciation.\n\nKİLİSE SINKHOLE MAPS Döşemealtı – Antalya Same cave and same club; ITÜMAK. The lower profile is 2017, the upper one is 2018. The upper 2018 profile also has the date of the previous year. In this case, it is an admirable work; They both explored the rest of the cave and re-measured and drew to compensate for the mistakes in the old section. The depth of the cave increased by 20 meters and reached -151 m. We hope it’s not too deep because drawing a new map every 20 meters will be quite a pain. Drawing a profile instead of a plan is always a preferred method in caves that are mostly vertical, such as the Kilise Sinkhole. But the most important weakness of a cross-sectional map is that it is not clear where in the cave you are “cutting”. We see a perfect example of this problem in this pair of charts. Two profiles continue in the same direction up to 40 meters and then change direction. The left side in the 2017 map turned to the right in the 2018 map. On the other hand, we think BCRA 5C, written in the 2017 profile below, is a very ambitious measurement standard for such a profile. I wonder if those who drew this map know that 5C means ±1º compass and ±10 cm station accuracy at each station?\n\nKOCAİN CAVE MAPS Ahırtaş – Antalya Kocain, located in İndağı in the north-west of Ahırtaş Village, north of Antalya, has been measured three times so far. The first measurement was made in 1919, then in 1977, and finally between 2001 and 2013. Following the Armistice of Mudros signed between the Ottoman Empire and the Allied Powers on October 30, 1918, the Italian occupation of Antalya and its surroundings indirectly led to the discovery and research of Kocain. Italian archaeologist Giuseppe Moretti set out towards Kocain on July 30, 1919, taking a guide from Ahırtaş Village of Antalya. All the details of this study are explained in the article titled “Kocaine in Indağ”, published in the 6th issue of the magazine ‘Annuario Della Scuola Archeologica di Atene’ dated 1923-1924. The Kocain map drawn by Moretti during this research was the oldest cave map drawn in Anatolia until an older one was discovered. Although there are serious differences between the Kocain maps drawn later and this map drawn by Moretti, the technique and precision applied in this drawing 100 years ago is admirable. On the other hand, during his very short work, Moretti not only drew the map of this huge cave, but also copied all the inscriptions on the cave walls and drew a detailed sketch of the cistern inside the cave, dating back to the Roman Period (Moretti, 1923-1924). Following this map drawn by Moretti, Kocain Cave was re-explored and remapped in 1977 by French cavers who are members of SCP (Speleo Club de Paris) (Chabert et al., 1978, Chabert, 1979a). As he himself admitted years ago, Chabert’s 1977 map is both lacking in detail and incorrectly oriented. Chabert said in a private meeting that this map did not suit such a large and beautiful cave, and he started measurements for a third map in 2001. The third map, completed by Ezgi Tok in 2013 after the death of Claude Chabert, is the most detailed one among those drawn (Yamaç, 2013a).\n\nKÖRÜKİNİ - SULUİN CAVE MAPS Çamlık Köyü – Derebucak - Konya Many caves around Çamlık Village, located about 80 km north of Antalya - Akseki, are protected as a national park. This entire group of caves, including the Balatini Cave mentioned above, was formed in Jurassic - Cretaceous aged limestones. Körükini - Suluin Cave System is one of the most strangely named caves in Turkey. Uzunsu Stream, flowing south of Çamlık Village, sinks into the dense limestone formation in the region, emerges after 1,250 m, sinks again after a few hundred meters, and then emerges again. The name of the cave formed at the first sunset is Körükini. The Uzunsu Stream, which originates from the Körükini Cave, flows openly for a while and then sinks again, taking the name Değirmenini Cave, and on its way out it becomes the Suluin Cave. It is strange that this system, which is structurally the same cave, has three different names. Of the two maps you see on the left, the upper one was drawn by Bakalowicz in 1967, and the lower one was drawn by MTA in 1993. The maps are not ‘Mirror’, they just started drawing from different directions. So, if you rotate any map both horizontally and vertically, you will see that it looks very similar to the other map. But there is a serious difference between the scales of the two maps. We do not know which scale is correct and which is incorrect, but if Körükini Cave is approximately 1,250 m long, as Temuçin Aygen writes in many different sources, Bakalowicz’s scale bar looks much more accurate than the scale bar of the MTA map.\n\nKURUDERE CAVE MAPS Hamidiye – Vize – Kırklareli Below, BÜMAK map dated 1982, and above, MTA map dated 1997 (Nazik et al., 1998). This was the all BUMAK map; there was no scale or north arrow. We took it as it was and tried to make it the same length with the MTA map. The plan is not ‘Mirror’, the fact that the last turn of the cave is in the same direction on both maps shows that it is not ‘Mirror’. So why is the other turn seen in the middle of the cave on the MTA map not on the BÜMAK map and what does ‘Plan (4c)’ on the BUMAK map mean?\n\nKURUKÖPRÜ CAVE MAPS Beşkonak – Manavgat – Antalya Above ANÜMAT map dated 1997, and below M. Değirmenci map dated 1989. The plans are somewhat similar. Although the lengths before and after the fork are not the same in the two maps, total lengths are close; 530 and 578 meters. So, how can the depth be -30 m and -87 m when there is a slight difference between the lengths? On the other hand, I laugh a lot at this arrogance I come across in some cave maps. Length: 578.3 m depth: -86.8 m. Although ANÜMAT cavers did not write a BCRA grade on their maps, even if you use a theodolite, there will be more difference than that in measuring a cave.\n\nKUYUMCU SINKHOLE MAPS Dodurga – Bozöyük - Bilecik Don’t ever say “How different can the cross-sections of a roughly 40-meter vertical cave be?” These two drawings can be as different as what you see. On the left are sections of MAD dated 1996, and on the right are sections of MTA dated 1997. The scariest part is; Although on the MAD map the sinkhole descends steeply and ends at -48 m, on the MTA section on the right it ends with a ‘?’ sign at -40 m after a slope that starts at -35 meters. We don’t know which is more accurate.\n\nMARASPOLİ CAVE MAPS Ermenek These two maps show the upper, fossil part of Maraspoli. The map on the left was drawn by Couderc in 1965 (Couderc et al., 1965), and the map on the right was drawn by OBRUK in 2011. The cave, which begins with a small descent inside the large entrance in the south (left), is the suspended fossil part of the Maraspoli Stream, which flows at a lower elevation and meets the water of Ermenek even today. The black bands on the map on the right show the stream flowing 12 m below in these parts of the cave. Two maps, 46 years apart, that are very similar from the introduction to the middle. There are serious differences in the two halls towards the north. The hall in the middle of the cave is quite small on Couderc’s map, and the side branch that continues northward from this western part is missing. One possibility is that they could not cross the 12 m cliff in the middle during the measurement of this middle hall. If you look carefully at the Couderc map, you can see that it shows the water flow below with an arrow.\n\nMOLLA DELİĞİ CAVE MAPS Beycik - Kemer - Antalya Below is the AKÜMAK map dated 2022, and above MTA map dated 1997. The entrance and the first long gallery are almost the same on both maps. Although there are minor differences in the branch that turns northwest after this section, these can be relatively ignored. The nonsense begins not in these galleries of the cave, but in the other galleries extending to the south. There is not a single similar gallery in this part of either map.\n\nOYLAT - BURSA CAVE MAPS İnegöl – Bursa Oylat Cave, which was opened to tourism fifteen years ago, is located at the exit point of Oylat Canyon, 17 km south-east of İnegöl. The cave was investigated and reported by MTA in 1997 (Nazik et al., 1997). The top map is taken from this report of MTA. The bottom one is a map drawn by ANMAK in 1995, two years before MTA (ANMAK, 1997). The same problem you have seen before in some other cave maps is also valid in these maps; the ANMAK map is upside-down ‘Mirror’. This time, we have placed the corrected version of the ANMAK map in the centre so that you can both see the problem and compare the maps of this detailed cave more easily. If you look at it, you will see that apart from being a ‘Mirror’, the ANMAK map is quite consistent with the MTA map until you reach the big hall. The hall is very different in both maps. This hall measures approximately 100 x 40 m and is a large formation with a very steep slope. ANMAK measured this cave, which it named Bursa Cave, as 482 m, while MTA measured it as 665 m.\n\nÖDEMİŞ SINKHOLE MAPS Subatan - Ödemiş Let’s be honest; the above Ödemiş Sinkhole open profile drawn by BÜMAK in 1980 (more precisely in 1981) is quite sloppy. Although they have already written that it is 2D, this does not excuse the standard, Turkish and date errors. Nevertheless, the depth of the sinkhole is very close to the depths on the map below, measured by a mixed team in 2010 and drawn by Fatih Büyüktopçu; -160 m and -154 m. On the other hand, the profile below is also quite detailed.\n\nPEYNİRİNİ CAVE MAPS Karaburun - İzmir Below is the DEUMAK map dated 2002 and above is the BUMAK map dated 1991, drawn 11 years ago. Let’s leave the maps aside for a moment and look at the lengths and depths. The length of the BUMAK map is 277 m and the depth is -48 m. On the other hand, the length of the DEUMAK map is 229 m and the depth is -108 m. It is not possible for there to be a 60 m depth difference between the two maps of such a short cave. Starting from their entrances, almost no part of the maps resembles the other. Yes, there are two different galleries in the centre of both maps, but this is the only similarity. Neither the halls nor the galleries are alike. Even the orientations are different.\n\nPINARGÖZÜ CAVE MAPS Yenişarbademli – Isparta It is one of the most extraordinary caves of Turkey, perhaps the most important, all still unexplored. Pınargözü Cave is located on the northern slope of Dedegöl Mountain in the Western Taurus Mountains and is an active water outlet. The cave is located at the intersection of three different geological formations and proceeds along the contact of the Karagöl Formation, in the NE-SW direction, within the limestones of the Triassic aged Kasımlar Formation, also known as the “Dippoyraz Limestones”. The first research in the cave, which was discovered by Temuçin Aygen in 1964, started in 1968 with cavers who were members of SCP (Speleo Club de Paris) and continued until 1972. During this period, surface surveys were continued on the entire Dedegöl Mountain to discover the sinking points of the water coming out of Pınargözü, but none of the 6-7 sinkholes discovered were connected to Pınargözü Cave. As a result of these studies, on the map of Pınargözü Cave dated 1972, the length is 5275 m and the height is +248 m (Chabert, 1972b). Pınargözü Cave started to be measured again in the new period research, which started in 2011 with a mixed team supported by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. With the new branches found as a result of the work that continued until 2016, the length of the cave reached 8500 m and its height reached +440 m. During the same study, a total of 50 km2 of land was scanned and although new caves were found in addition to the sinkholes previously discovered by SCP, no connection with Pınargözü Cave has still been established. Therefore, the source or sources that feed a source with a high flow rate of 50 l/s have still not been found despite 50 years of research. On the left are the maps of Pınargözü Cave dated 1972, and on the right are the maps dated 2014, drawn by a mixed team. The fact that two maps of such a long and difficult cave, drawn 42 years apart, are so similar is both surprising and deserves all kinds of praise. If we compare the 1972 Chabert map on the left with the map on the right, we can say that the new team is not even halfway there yet. Meanwhile, the three siphons that Chabert’s team dived through are no longer there, as the amount of water has decreased over time. And, perhaps most importantly, since there was no SRT yet in 1972, the French explored this cave by laying ladders!\n\nSARPUNALINCA CAVE MAPS Sarpunalınca – Devrekani – Kastamonu Sarpunalınca Cave is located 22 km east of Devrekani and 400 m away from the village. Sandwiched between the Yaralıgöz Mountain and the formations to the north of Devrekani, this region is composed of younger sedimentary rocks discordantly piled on the Precambrian Daday-Devrekani group, which extends to the north and east and has been heavily metamorphosed. The first exploration of Sarpunalınca Cave, which is a long traverse cave formed in these rocks and drains the water of the river sinking in the western entrance to the eastern exit, was carried out by BUMAK in November 1981. Then, in 1982, MAD conducted a study in the cave and drew a map of it. This map was published in the 4th MAD Bulletin in 1987. Since we did not know that the cave was surveyed and mapped by MAD 28 years ago and we were not aware of the bulletin published 23 years ago, we, as OBRUK, remapped Sarpunalınca in 2010. On the other hand, we look at both maps and say ‘I am glad we went and remapped it’.\n\nSOFULAR CAVE MAPS Sofular - Zonguldak Sofular Cave was developed within a Lower Carboniferous formation that is extremely suitable for karstification. This formation is bounded by another Lower Cretaceous formation consisting of carbonate cemented sandstones, and a reverse fault caused stratigraphic inversion. The Lower Carboniferous formation in which the cave is located consists of three different facies. At the bottom are chalky and clayey limestones. Dolomitic limestones come on top, and pure limestones come at the top. Depending on these different facies layers, large changes in CaCO3 ratios are observed. Sofular Cave was formed in the lower layers of the formation. The lowest floor of the cave, located at 80 meters from the entrance, is located in clayey limestone. On the other hand, the upper layers are located in the dolomitic levels of the formation. Sofular Cave was mapped separately by MAD in 1990 (Laumanns and Özbek, 1990) and by MTA in 1995 (Nazik et al., 1995). MTA’s map is 170 m longer than the map of MAD, which works with Kaufmann and Laumanns, and this map has a huge gallery that continues eastwards, which is not on the MAD map.\n\nSOĞUCAK CAVE MAPS Sapanca – Sakarya You see the ASPEG map dated 2009 above, and the MTA map dated 1997 below. Although two maps rotated in the same direction and brought to the same scale seem quite similar at first glance, there are actually big differences. The first difference observed is that the side branch deviating from the main gallery to the north after the entrance on the MTA map is not present on the ASPEG map. Likewise, the branch that continues west after the elbow on the MTA map is not present on the ASPEG map, it is replaced by a ‘?’ sign. Although parallel branches continuing towards the south are present on both maps, the distance between them is very different. The distance between these two galleries, which appear to be adjacent on the MTA map, appears to be around 15 m on the ASPEG map. The side branch that turns east at the last part of the cave, which is visible on the ASPEG map, is not on the MTA map.\n\nSORGUN CAVE MAPS Aksu - Eğirdir - Isparta Below, MTA dated 1989 (Güldalı et al., 1989), and above, M. Değirmenci maps of the same date (Değirmenci, 1989). They look incredibly similar except for a few minor details. Even the lengths are 303 m and 302 m.\n\nSÖĞÜTLÜ - MAĞARA KÖYÜ CAVE MAPS Sakarya - Söğütlü - Mağara Köyü This was not an easy book to prepare. Some double maps were easy; The names of the caves were the same, but in some other maps the names or locations of the caves were different. If you add to this problem that the maps are not similar to each other, you can understand the problem better. You have seen this problem on the Gürlevik Cave maps above. On the left page you see another example. On the left is the Söğütlü Cave map drawn by MTA in 2002, and on the right is the Cave Village Cave map drawn by BÜMAK in 1995. On the MTA map, the location is written as “Sakarya - Söğütlü - Cave Village”, which is the correct location, but on the BÜMAK map it is “Adapazarı - Söğütlü - Cave Village”. After overcoming the difficulty of bringing together two caves with different locations, names and maps, the problem of interpreting two different maps that are not similar to each other begins. Both maps were translated by us in the same direction and brought to the same scale. They have almost no similarities, except for two folds in the middle of the cave. BUMAK skipped two side branches. MTA measured the cave as 475 m, while BÜMAK measured 368 m. Depth (elevation) is +22 m on MTA and +11 m on BÜMAK map.\n\nSUBAŞI CAVE – SUBAŞININ GÖZÜ SINKHOLE MAPS Kuyucak – Akseki – Antalya On the left are MAD’s map dated 2001, on the right are La Senyara’s map dated 1987 (Leloğlu, 2007, Senyara, 1989). Let’s start with the plans you see below, right and left: The north of the plans are facing the same direction, but their scales are not the same. The Spanish map on the right is larger in scale. Compared to MAD, the Spaniards worked a shorter distance, as can be seen when comparing these sections. The orientation in the plans is not wrong, the problem we have encountered many times in this book is present here as well: One of the plans is “Mirror”! Note the small, horn-shaped side branch in the middle of the main gallery in the MAD plan on the left. The same small arm is also present in the plan on the right, with one facing east and the other facing west. Apart from this difference, both the plan and the sections of the Spanish are more comprehensive than the MAD - although much shorter. They found a lower gallery right after the entrance. This lower gallery, which is not on the MAD map, must be the continuation of the phreatic gallery in the further part of the cave, where water sinks by siphoning and continues to flow from the bottom. Moreover, this point sinking into the siphon is clearly visible in both sections.\n\nSUSUZ - GÜVERCİN TAŞI DELİĞİ – GÜVERCİN DELİĞİ CAVE MAPS Susuz – Seydişehir – Konya Susuz Cave is located approximately 1 km southwest of Susuz Village, which is 15 km southeast of Seydişehir. The cave is also known as Keş Hole and Pigeon Stone Hole. Susuz Cave was developed within the Upper Cretaceous limestones. Tectonic fractures and crack systems, which are very common in the region, dominate the structure. The cave has two entrances. The main entrance is located on the valley floor. The second entrance is in the form of a deep and wide-open doline developed on the slope, 37 m above the bottom in the same valley. This entrance is in the form of a chimney, opened to the main gallery partly by melting and partly by collapse. Contrary to its name, Susuz Cave is a very watery cave and it was determined that it merges with Tınaztepe Sinkhole through the paint test. The water entering from Tınaztepe Sinkhole reaches the cave and continues its flow inside the cave, forming a waterfall approximately 70-80 m below the current entrance of the cave and ending with a siphon after 40-50 m. The upper parts of the cave are where the cave is developed in terms of travertine, stalactites, stalagmites and columns. The research report of this cave is included in the 64th issue of Speleologie Magazine. It was mapped by M. Clarke and M. Raimond in 1971, and it was understood that the cave was -79 m deep and 1638 m long (Bakalowicz, 1970, Raimond and Chabert, 1971). . In 1989, two different siphons were passed by the Czech Geospeleos Team and the cave was measured and mapped again (Sroubek, 1989). You see the French maps dated 1971 above and the Czech maps dated 1989 below. When you look at these two maps of Susuz, which is not an easy cave to work in, even though it is relatively horizontal, one really feels sorry for the effort spent. Again the same problem; As you noticed, one of these two maps is a “horizontal mirror” and the worst part is that we do not know which one is correct and which one is a “mirror”.\n\nSÜTİNİ CAVE MAPS Selçuk – İzmir BUMAK map dated 1986 on the top and EMAK map dated 2001 on the bottom. Although it is unlikely that there are two different Sütini Cave in the same place, when you come across two such different maps, you can’t help but think “I wonder?”. There is almost nothing similar about the two plans. It would not have made a difference even if we had turned their norths in the same direction. In the BUMAK map, all details are drawn precisely and sections are taken at almost every station. On the other hand, it is already stated on the EMAK map that the measurement quality is BCRA 2B. But does the fact that it is BCRA 2B justify not having a scale bar or not writing where the ‘entrance’ is? What is even funnier is that the length of the cave is 212.5 m on the BCRA 2B map. Later, we learned that they found a branch that was not on the EMAK-BÜMAK map and were drawing it.\n\nŞİNASİ (GİDEROS 1) CAVE MAPS Gideros - Kurucaşile - Kastamonu This cave is located on the Gideros Bay of Bartın, Kurucaşile, and has three different maps with three different names. In 2009 we explored a cave here in almost the same location and only 20 meters from the main road, in a dense forest. We asked the residents its local name and used the name they gave; ‘Şinasi Cave’. As if these problems were not enough, the Cide Archaeological Project explored, surveyed, and mapped a cave exactly in the same area in 2015. They named the cave as ‘Gideros Cave 1’. In their archaeological report, there are only a few notes: “The walls of Gideros Cave 1 are covered in multiple Greek graffiti. Found in close proximity to the religious complex discussed above, Gideros Cave 1 is a large cave complex. At some point, it was turned into a commemorative shrine, which is noted by an apsidal enclave at the back of the cave surrounded by crosses scratched into the wall. There are also some Greek inscriptions which need further analysis, as they will almost certainly offer some indication of the purpose and dedication of this site.” (Düring & Glatz, 2015; Düring et al., 2012) Although there are obvious differences between the two maps, it is clear that ‘Şinasi Cave’ and ‘Gideros Cave 1’ are the same.\n\nTABAK – KIRKGÖZLER SINHOLE MAPS Döşemealtı – Antalya Their sections are quite similar, and there is no other cave at this depth around Döşemealtı - Kırkgözler, so these two maps most likely belong to the same sinkhole. The section on the right was drawn by American caver Andy Walsh, a member of RRCPC, in 1989, and the section on the left was drawn by BÜMAK in 2007. While the depth of Walsh’s section is -229 m, BÜMAK’s depth is -178 m. The difference of 51 m corresponds to almost 30% of the total depth of the cave and is a much larger difference than normal.\n\nTEZİNİ CAVE MAPS Balıklıova - İzmir Below is the profile of Tezini Cave drawn by Fatih Büyüktopçu in 2002. Above is another profile drawn by BÜMAK this year. BÜMAK went there knowing the previously drawn map of this cave and to draw a more accurate map. We have written before; The biggest problem with profiles is not understanding where you cut them according to the plan. For example, in these profiles, the first parts of Fatih and BÜMAK are almost the same; 45m and 50m. But while there is a large volume in the descent in this first part of Fatih’s map, BUMAK descends with a very narrow and straight shaft. Although there are minor similarities in both maps of the other descents that continue behind this descent, the drawings become quite complex from this point on. As a result, Fatih’s section ended with branches continuing at -95 m, while BÜMAK ended it with non-continuing branches at -71 m.\n\nTINAZTEPE CAVE MAPS Seydişehir – Konya Tınaztepe caves and sinkhole are located 25 km south of Seydişehir and on the side of the main road. The system consists of three fossil caves and one active sinkhole located at different elevations. The fossil caves are 1015 m long and the sinkhole is 1650 m long and -153 m deep. The region has undergone a very complex geological and geomorphological evolution. If we consider the field as a whole; It is seen that young and old formations are intertwined. Tınaz Mountain consists of nummulitic limestones that form the top layer of the compressive series. Gidengelmez Mountain, located opposite this, consists of Cretaceous aged series. The longitudinal depression, bounded by two main faults in the middle, consists of Paleozoic age cover layers. The Cretaceous limestones that make up the structure of Tınaztepe extend towards the southeast and disappear under the Paleozoic formations that make up the structure of Karadağ. This system, which was first explored by French cavers who were members of the SCP in 1968, was later re-explored by Italian, British, Turkish and German teams, and was re-measured and mapped each time (Agnoletti et al., 1970, Bakalowicz, 1968, Güldalı et al., 1980). , Schmitt, 1986, Skuce et al., 1977). It is impossible not to feel sorry for this unnecessary effort in such a system that is difficult to work with, with its 153 m deep sinkhole and 2665 m long galleries in total. On the other hand, each map is so different from the other that it is not possible to say which one is correct and which one is incorrect. We chose to publish all maps as they are, without any editing.\n\nULUYAYLA – İNAĞZI (KIRLANGIÇ) CAVE MAPS Ovacuma – Safranbolu - Zonguldak or Ulus – Bartın Map of two caves with different names, locations, everything. Let’s start with the location: This is a plateau located in the northern part of the border of Karabük and Bartın provinces, connected to Bartın and at an altitude of approximately 1100 meters, located right in the middle of Ovacuma and Ulus. From this perspective, both positions can actually be considered correct. The only problem is that Ovacuma – Safranbolu has nothing to do with Zonguldak and is connected to Karabük. This 450 m long traverse cave, which was first explored, measured and mapped by BÜMAK in 1989, was re-mapped by MTA 13 years later in 2002 (Albukrek, 1993; Nazik, 2003). The two small side branches on the south wall, which appear on the MTA map, are not present on the BÜMAK map. If the errors were limited to these two side arms, we would say it was “missed”, but the difference in the turning angles observed 100 m after the entrance and the width of the cave on both maps is so large that this is; The traverse, which should be relatively short and easy to measure, makes the difference in the maps of the cave incomprehensible.\n\nULUYAYLA SINKHOLE - SUBATIK CAVE MAPS Ovacuma – Safranbolu - Zonguldak or Ulus – Bartın This cave is a continuation of the work in the same region for both organizations, BÜMAK and MTA (Albukrek and Usuloglu, 1993, Nazik and Törk, 2003b). Uluyayla / İnağzı Cave was relatively easy, this one is quite complicated. Seeing such a difference in the map of the relatively easy, traverse cave above, it is expected that the maps of this cave measured and drawn by the same teams would be like this. Even if you turn the north of these maps in the same direction, even if you bring the maps to the same scale and place them on top of each other, they do not look the same. We couldn’t find anything to comment on. Since their names are different, we even wondered if these were two different caves in the same region. But the main gallery in the east of the cave looked somewhat similar on both maps.\n\nYARIMBURGAZ CAVE MAPS Büyükçekmece – Istanbul Due to its proximity to Istanbul, numerous studies have been carried out in Yarımburgaz Cave, both speleologically and archaeologically. Turkey’s first known cave research was conducted by Abdullah Bey in Yarımburgaz in 1869. This is explained in another article by the same researcher in 1872 (Bey, 1872), in a travel report published in R. Bousquet’s Echos d’Orient magazine in 1901 (Bousquet, 1901) and in H. Kocacan’s 1918 publication in Tedrisat Mecmuası. It was followed by a conference text (Kocacan, 1918). Despite so many publications about Yarımburgaz Cave, no one measured and mapped the cave until 1927. On this date, Professor Hovasse carried out perhaps one of the most comprehensive cave investigations ever made in Turkey, and also measured and mapped the cave (Hovasse, 1927). This map of Hovasse is the second oldest known cave map of Turkey after Moretti’s map of Kocain dated 1923. There are six different maps of Yarımburgaz Cave drawn over a period of 66 years, and all of these maps were prepared without being aware of the existence of the previous one. The interesting point is that all six maps are of extremely high quality, unlike the dissimilar “double maps” of many small caves you have encountered so far. Left row, bottom to top; You can see Raymond Hovasse’s 1927, Racovita’s 1930, Hubbard’s 1932 maps, and on the right row, from bottom to top, Celal Şengör’s 1972, E. Gilli and J. P. Maiteret’s 1984, and BÜMAK’s 1993 maps. BÜMAK measured the length of Yarımburgaz as 1021 m. When we see how similar BÜMAK’s map and Hovasse’s map are, it is impossible not to appreciate the precision with which Hovasse measured this long and difficult cave with the limited resources of that day and with the help of only one person.\n\nYUKARI BALİÖNÜ CAVE MAPS Cide – Kastamonu Although it says “Balıönü” on the upper map of MTA (Nazik and Törk, 2003a), since there are two different caves in the same place, ASPEG preferred to separate them as “Upper” and “Lower” and called the cave “Upper Baliönü”. Although the main gallery at the entrance is similar on both maps, there are serious differences in the side branch of this gallery that continues to the west and, worse, in the orientation of this branch. It is very likely that the ASPEG map is incorrect and in our opinion, even a single compass error at a station in the measurement of this branch extending to the west could create this result.\n\nZİNDAN CAVE MAPS Aksu – Isparta Zindan Cave is located about 2 km northeast of Isparta’s Aksu district, on the edge of the Aksu stream, and this region is one o"
