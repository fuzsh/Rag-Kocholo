        "text": "This study aims to assess the pottery collected from Late Neolithic settlements during pedestrian surveys in the Kuseyr Plateau within the boundaries of Hatay Province (Turkey). The fact that the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods of this region have only been known so far from the Amuq Plain increases the importance of the new data from the Kuseyr Plateau. The comprehensive surveys conducted during the 2017-2019 seasons showed that not only the fertile plains, but also the marginal areas on higher elevations were inhabited during the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods. Ten such settlements belonging to the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods (Amuq A-E) were identified in the region. These settlements are mainly located in the valleys which lead to the Orontes River and its tributaries. The initial assessment of these ceramics indicates close technological and typological relationships with the El-Rouj and Balikh valleys in Syria, Northern Levant, Cilicia and the Upper Tigris region.\n\nhis study examines the pottery assemblage recovered from rescue excavations conducted in 2018 and 2019 at the prehistoric site of Kulaksızlar, which took its name from a synonymous village near the town of Akhisar in Manisa province. The site of Kulaksızlar is best known as a marble workshop concentrating on the production of Kilia Type figurines and conical vessels, both being hallmarks of the second half of the fifth millennium BC in western Anatolia. Kulaksızlar is a settlement that contributes to our knowledge of the Middle Chalcolithic period, which was poorly understood in the past. The pottery assemblage from two seasons of rescue excavations is important as its analysis allows us to place the site in its temporal and cultural context and helps us to understand the material world of the inhabitants of the site other than working with marble. Özet Bu çalışma Manisa ili Akhisar ilçesi Kulaksızlar köyü yakınında aynı adlı prehistorik yerleşimde 2018 ve 2019 yıllarında yapılan kurtarma kazıları sırasında ele geçen çanak çömlek buluntu topluluğunu inceler. Kulaksızlar yerleşimi daha çok M.Ö. 5. bin yılın ikinci yarısının işaret ürünlerinden olan Kilya tipi idoller ve konik rhytonlar üreten bir mermer işleme atölyesi ile tanınmaktadır. Bu yüzden Kulaksızlar geçmişte Batı Anadolu'nun en az bilinen dönemlerinden biri olan Orta Kalkolitik dönemi tanımlamamıza yardımcı olan bir yerleşimdir. İki kurtarma kazısı sezonunda ele geçen seramiklerin analizi hem bu yerleşimin kronolojik ve kültürel bağlamlarını ortaya koymak hem de bu yerleşim sakinlerinin mermer işçiliği dışındaki materyal dünyalarını tanımlamak için önemlidir."
