        "text": "In the Eskişehir Basin, western Turkey, oil shale occurs in alternation with claystone, siltstone, conglomerate and coal (lignite) seams in lacustrine deposits of Early-Middle Miocene age. The thickness of oil shale seams drilled during the study varies between 20 and 30 m. Organic geochemical features of the shale were evaluated using TOC, pyrolysis, GC and GC-MS analyses. The Eskişehir oil shale is characterized by very high TOC contents (6.32–37.15 wt%), Hydrogen Index (HI = 392–777 mg HC/g TOC), Potential Yield (PY = 35.50–159.32 mg HC/g rock) and very low Oxygen Index (OI = 13–92 mg CO2/g TOC) values. Organic matter in the studied oil shale is of Type II kerogen and shows S2/S3 ratio values between 5.49 and 56.79 and low Tmax (421–435 °C ) and PI (0.01–0.05) values. Low Pr/Ph ratio of oil shale (0.17–0.96) is indicative of anoxic conditions. Dominant steranes are either C27 or C28. Normal steranes are more abundant than iso- and diasteranes and diasterane abundances as well as 20S/(20S + 20R) and ββ/(ββ + αα) sterane ratios are low. While oil shale samples in general have low tricyclic terpane (C19–C29) abundance, their C30 (R + S) tricyclic terpane content is high. For all the oil shale samples studied C29/C30 hopane, C31R homohopane/hopane and moretane/hopane ratios are high and Ts/(Ts + Tm) and C29Ts/(C29Ts + C29H) ratios are low. 22S homohopanes are recorded in lower quantities in comparison to 22R epimers and the 22S/(22S + 22R) homohopane ratio is low.\n\nThe Miocene units of the Beypazarı Neogene Basin extensively outcrop and prevalently include oil shale and coal. In the previous studies, it has been determined that the total organic carbon (TOC) values of bituminous shales in the basin are concentrated between 4-8% and algal organic matter (Type I-II kerogen) are dominant. It has also been determined that the bituminous shales have pyrolyzable hydrocarbon content of 83% and a potential source rock feature that can produce oil in a large quantity if exposed to high temperatures. Beypazarı Neogene Basin consists of volcano-sedimentary units. Therefore, as a result of the idea that the immature source rocks can be matured by young volcanic that exhibit widespread outcrops, it has been aimed to investigate the oil and gas potential especially in the northeastern part of the basin by TPH (Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons) analysis performed on the samples taken from the natural cold water resources located in the related part of the basin. As a consequence of the analyses conducted, hydrocarbons have been detected in all the water samples. The organic geochemical methods have been used to determine the source of hydrocarbons detected in the water resources. The detected n-alkane hydrocarbons are the mature petroleum hydrocarbons derived from peat/coal type organic matter (Type III kerogen, gas-prone). The presence of these mature petroleum hydrocarbons is regarded as evidence for the existence of a working petroleum system in the study area. Due to the presence of waters containing mature petroleum hydrocarbons, the anticlines in the depth of approximately 110 m in fault-propagation folds identified in the investigation area by gravity and magnetic data have a very high potential to become gas reservoirs.

It is seismically one of the most active regions of the world and includes prospective areas for hydrocarbons, coal beds, and geothermal sources. The KB5 well, from which the petroleum sample was taken, has been located at the intersection of the geothermally active Menderes and Gediz grabens near the town of Saraykoy. During drilling, the petroleum erupted onto the surface with its associated thermal water (120 o C) from a depth of 120132 m (e.g., from Early to Middle Pliocene aged claystone"
