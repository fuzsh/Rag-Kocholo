        "text": "MirrorMask is a 2005 dark fantasy film designed and directed by Dave McKean and written by Neil Gaiman from a story they developed together. It was produced by The Jim Henson Company. The film stars Stephanie Leonidas, Jason Barry, Rob Brydon, and Gina McKee.\n\nGaiman and McKean worked on the film concepts over the course of two weeks at Jim Henson's family's home. The film's production took seventeen months.\n\nCreated on a budget of $4 million, the film was originally made as a direct-to-video film,[2] but had a limited theatrical run in the United States on September 30, 2005, resulting in a domestic theatrical gross of $867,000. The film was also screened at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival where it received positive responses. The overall critical reaction to the film was mixed, with critics praising the film's visuals while complaining about the overall story and script."
