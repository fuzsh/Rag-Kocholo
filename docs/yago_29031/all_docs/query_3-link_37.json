        "text": "He has helped revamp contemporary comics, either by teaming up with other British writers such as Neil Gaiman for Violent Cases, Black Orchid, Signal to Noise, and Grant Morrison for the celebrated masterpiece Arkham Asylum, or by working on his own with the monumental graphic novel Cages. He created music album artworks for Tori Amos, Alice Cooper, Dream Theater, Front Line Assembly. He created the covers for all of The Sandman‘s comic books, and now that the cult character has been transposed into a live action series on Netflix, he has curated its credits scenes. Dave McKean will be the special guest at TOHorror Fantastic Film Fest 2022, this the first preview of the 22nd edition of the festival to be held Oct. 18-23 in Turin (at Cinema Massimo, Circolo dei Lettori and Blah Blah Club). On Friday, October 21, at 6 pm, at Cinema Massimo, the great British illustrator and director will hold a masterclass in conversation with Manfredi Toraldo (deputy artistic director of the Turin branch of Scuola Comics). The meeting, organized in collaboration with POPstore comic book store, is free entry and will be followed by a special screening of Luna, a feature film directed by McKean in 2014 that was previously unreleased in Italy.\n\n“It will be an honor to host at the 22nd edition of TOHorror one of the graphic authors who has most impacted the fantastic imaginary in the last decades - says Massimiliano Supporta, artistic director of the Festival - the presence of Dave McKean will be one of the highlights of an edition full of films and events: 29 feature films divided into 5 sections, 50 short films between live action and animation, 9 special events including 4 concerts and 5 thematic panels… a 6-day odyssey in cinema & culture of the fantastic, at 360 degrees. We will reveal the full program at a press conference on Tuesday, September 27.”\n\nComic book fans will have their fill. In addition to McKean, the Mad Doc section will feature the Italian premiere of the documentary Mike Mignola: Drawing Monsters by Jim Demonakos and Kevin Konrad Hanna. A biographical tale of Mike Mignola’s career that focuses on the origins of Hellboy and the cartoonist’s (sometimes conflicted) relationship with his most famous creation and its film adaptations.\n\nThe feature film competition section will show 12 films (10 national premieres, 1 international premiere) from 9 countries. Among them is Katsumi Sasaki’s Japanese Devil’s Residents, which breaks down J-horror clichés to speak to our (digital) present with anarchic fury, bringing together pulp and macabre à la Lucio Fulci. Lovers of the bizarre will find satisfaction in the Freakshow section, full of weird films, splatter and gore gems, extreme and wacky B movies. Including, from Switzerland, Mad Heidi by Johannes Hartmann and Sandro Klopfstein, a wild grindhouse reinterpretation of the mountain orphan girl’s adventures."
