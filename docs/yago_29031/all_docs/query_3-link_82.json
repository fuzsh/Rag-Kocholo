Contributor to periodicals, including the New Yorker.\n\nSidelights\n\nBritish artist and filmmmaker Dave McKean is best known for the illustrations he has provided for book and CD covers as well as comics and graphic novels, especially those written by friend Neil Gaiman. McKean's talent is extensive, however, and his creativity extends to photography, painting, model-building, music performance, film direction, and digital and graphic design. As a visual artist he use a variety of mediums, including drawing, painting, photography, paper and found-object collage, and sculpture. Despite his wide-ranging credits, McKean is best known to younger fans as the illustrator of children's books by Gaiman, S.F. Said, and David Almond.\n\nMcKean and Gaiman first met in New York City in the mid-1980s, and they have since collaborated on many projects. In fact, McKean's artwork was first introduced to mass audiences in the pages of Gaiman's short graphic novel Violent Cases. Subsequent comic-book projects cemented the collaboration, among them Black Orchid, Signal to Noise, and Gaiman's groundbreaking \"Sandman\" comic-book series, all of which have subsequently been published in graphic-novel format.\n\nFrom ongoing series work, Gaiman and McKean soon turned to stand-alone projects, such as the large-format graphic novel The Tragical Comedy, or Comical Tragedy, of Mr. Punch: A Romance. Featuring a haunting story by Gaiman, the book showcases McKean's multimedia\n\n[Image not available for copyright reasons]\n\nart, made eerie due to the darkly drawn and sometimes grotesque adult characters and surreal Punch-and-Judy images. Calling the work \"stunning,\" Frank McConnell went on to assert in Commonweal that The Tragical Comedy, or Comical Tragedy, of Mr. Punch is \"easily the most haunting, inescapable story I've read in years.\" Another creative collaboration, this time with writer Grant Morrison, resulted in the comic-book compilation Arkham Asylum, a \"Batman\" adventure. Roger Sabin, reviewing this work for New Statesman & Society, concluded that \"McKean's artwork is often breathtaking—veering from gloomy photo-realism to brightly-coloured Steadmanesque abstraction.\"\n\nApart from their work in comics, McKean and Gaiman have also collaborated on several books for children, as well as on the McKean-directed film MirrorMask, based on a screenplay by Gaiman. In The Day I Swapped My Dad for Two Goldfish, an uninvolved father realizes that he is not important to his child when he is traded for a pair of desired pets. Coraline focuses on a little girl who crosses over into a nightmarish dimension, while in The Wolves in the Walls an imaginative child named Lucy is the only one in her family who has seen the wolves living in the walls of her parents' house. Another imaginative child is the focus of Gaiman's rhyming story Crazy Hair, in which young Bonnie discovers strange animals and other unusual objects hiding in a man's unruly coiffure, while The Graveyard Book finds author and illustrator returning to their darker themes in a Newbery Award-winning book that School Library Journal contributor Megan Honig described as \"a rich, surprising, and sometimes disturbing tale of dreams, ghouls, murderers, trickery, and family.\" Reviewing Coraline in Kliatt, Sherry Hoy concluded that McKean's surreal illustrations \"create the true chills here,\" while Booklist critic Francisca Goldsmith credited the artist's \"startling graphics\" for making The Wolves in the Walls \"visually and emotionally sophisticated, accessible, and inspired.\"\n\nOther books featuring artwork by McKean include The Savage, by Almond, and Said's novels Varjak Paw and The Outlaw Varjak Paw. Gestured ink images bring to life Said's novels, which focus on a purebred cat with Mesopotamian antecedents and a talent for the martial arts that saves several threatened family members and lead them to a haven in a dark and dangerous world. In Kirkus Reviews a critic concluded of Varjak Paw that Said's \"creepily off-kilter\" fictional world is \"effectively reinforced by [McKean's] vivid ink sketches,\" and a Publishers Weekly critic dubbed the book's illustrations \"chilling\" and \"sinuous.\"\n\nBiographical and Critical Sources\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nBooklist, September 15, 1998, Gordon Flagg, review of Cages, p. 185; August, 2003, Francisca Goldsmith, review of The Wolves in the Walls, p. 1989; April 1, 2006, Ed Sullivan, review of The Outlaw Varjak Paw, p. 41.\n\nBulletin of the Center for Children's Books, September, 2003, Janice Del Negro, review of The Wolves in the Walls, p. 14, and Varjak Paw, p. 32.\n\nCommonweal, December 2, 1994, Frank McConnell, review of The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch: A Romance, p. 27.\n\nHorn Book, November-December, 2002, Anita L.
