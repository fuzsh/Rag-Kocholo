        "text": "Dave McKean was born in Taplow, Berkshire in 1963. He attended Berkshire College of Art and Design from 1982-86 and, before leaving, started working as an illustrator.\n\nIn 1986 he met author Neil Gaiman with whom he has collaborated on many projects since. Their first book, Violent Cases (1987), has been printed in many editions worldwide, and adapted for the stage. Since then they have produced Black Orchid (1988), Signal To Noise (1990) for The Face magazine and Mr. Punch (1975). Dave has contributed all the cover illustrations and design for the popular Sandman series of graphic novels, and a collection of this work, Dust Covers, was published in 1998.\n\nArkham Asylum (1989) written by Scottish author/playwrite Grant Morrison, still the single most successful graphic novel ever published, was also illustrated by Dave. 1995 saw collaborations with the Rolling Stones (The Voodoo Lounge), and Rachel Pollack (The Vertigo Tarot).\n\nBetween 1990 and 1996, Dave also wrote and illustrated the 500pg. comic novel Cages, which won the Harvey Award for Best new comic and best graphic novel, the Ignatz Award, the International Alph Art award and Italy's La Pantera Award. His collection of short stories in comics form, Pictures That Tick released in 2000, won the Victoria and Albert Museum Illustrated Book of the Year Award, and several of McKean's books are in the V&A collection.\n\nHe has contributed many illustrations to The New Yorker, Playboy and other magazines, and promotional work for the films Blade, Alien Resurrection, The King is Alive, Dust and Sleepy Hollow. He has also created concept illustrations for the 2nd. And 3rd. Harry Potter films, and designs for Lars von Trier's interactive project in Copenhagen, House of Zoon.\n\nIn the last few years Dave has created several award winning children's books as well as adult illustrated books. He has also made some films such as MirrorMask, a feature fantasy film for Columbia/Tristar with the Jim Henson Company; and he has created extensive designs, films and photographs for the Elton John Broadway musical Lestat for Warner Brothers. Recently, Dave has written and directed a second feature film called Luna."
