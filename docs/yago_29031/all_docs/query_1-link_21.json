        "text": "MirrorMask was originally a\n\nfilm directed by Neil Gaiman’s longtime collaborator Dave McKean. The story is\n\na teen girl whose family owns a circus. Helen wants to run away from the circus,\n\nand in an argument with her mother, tells says that she hopes that she will be\n\nthe death of her mother. Helen’s mother becomes ill and everyone is worried.\n\nMost of the plot takes place within Helen’s dream, in which Helen goes into\n\nanother world where people from her real life have counterparts. She\n\nencounters her double, who wants to escape from the dreamworld. There are\n\nthemes of growing up, self-discovery, differentiation from others, and\n\novercoming obstacles. However, to a large extent the interest and charm of the\n\nfilm is visual, and the plot does not make a great deal of sense. After the\n\nmovie was made, Gaiman and McKean collaborated on a graphic novel together, in\n\nsimilar format to the many books they had made together before. This book can\n\nalso take advantage of the visual elements of the movie. However, the\n\nunabridged audiobook with text by Neil Gaiman, performed by Stephanie Leonidas,\n\nstar of the film, is only able to try to evoke the visual elements through the\n\nuse of words, and it doesn’t succeed well. The story is full of magic in the dream\n\nlogic of Helena’s surreal world. These elements are entertaining if you like\n\nthat sort of thing, but they do not add up to a coherent whole. Maybe Gaiman’s\n\nmost devoted fans would enjoy this audiobook, but most other people would do\n\nbest to stick to the feature-packed DVD of MirrorMask.\n\n© 2006 Christian\n\nPerring.
