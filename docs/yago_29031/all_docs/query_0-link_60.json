        "text": "MirrorMask Interview\n\nAs a follow up to his first look at the new Fantasy/Adventure picture MirrorMask, writer Jonathan Joy went to a promotional press interview event to learn more about the film and the men behind it. Here is what he found:\n\nUpon my arrival to the Jim Henson Studios in Hollywood, with Kermit the Frog statue flying high above, Im was unsure what to expect. I really enjoyed the film, and was completely anxious to hear more about the film.\n\nOnce on the premises, I wasnt let down in the least. There was plenty of creativity and imagination around every corner. The specific reason for my visit to the Henson Studios involved a roundtable O&A with writer Neil Gaiman and director Dave McKean for MirrorMask. Though my small group was allotted a short amount of time with each individual, I wanted to hear about McKeans pros and cons, to making a feature that heavily mixes live action with digital animation, along with his successful twenty year collaboration with writer Gaiman.\n\nThe project MirrorMask began with Lisa Henson approaching both McKean and Gaiman. In tackling such a project, McKean knew of the pressure to raise the bar for a company that has produced such classics as The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth. The only problem was those two pictures were made for 40 million dollars, while this one had a very, very low budget of only $4 million. As soon as we sat down, McKean explained: I learned so much from making this picture. In many ways this was my film school Stephanie Leonidas believed everything in the role of Helena. Without her, they would have had nothing. With her believing so much allowed her to carry the film.\n\nMcKean continued to take questions from some fellow journalists that were good, but not what I had in mind. I was interested more in the heart and soul of what made this film tick. To finish his portion of the discussion, McKean was asked what the secret to a good working relationship is and said, It is two things to the key and balance of our relationship and that is knowing we dont always have to work with one another thus we are not defined by each other. The second and most important element is trust. We have no baggage. That and the fact that Neil and I started at the bottom. We have grown and matured together which allows us to challenge one another all the time.\n\nIn the Q&A portion with writer Neil Gaiman that followed, I was most curious to hear about how he approaches writing in general and how his writing may change with each new project. He began our discussion by talking about how his writing style fit into writing MirrorMask. My style is very upside down. The one selling point for him to do this film was simple. We had no money, but total creative control. Given the opportunity to collaborate with McKean and the fantasy genre, Gaiman knew he would be pulling from many points of inspiration, but a few in particular such as the 1939 Wizard Of Oz, The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth and Terry Gilliams Time Bandits.\n\nHis long-running collaboration with McKean is still a unique one even to this day. Gaiman told us Dave always surprises me. He gives me back something I would never expect even after twenty years.\n\nThe Gaiman interview came to a close with what he thought the MirrorMask represents: The mask is a reflection of taking control over a situation that Helena never really had control over. Its about a time in our lives when we are picking and changing identities all the time. McKean and Gaiman have a genuine relationship that this individual hopes will continue for another twenty years. If MirrorMask is the surprise hit it deserve to be, this is far from the last time they will work together.\n\nSee Jons review of the film at:\n\nhttp://www.fulvuedrive-in.com/review/2710/MirrorMask+(Theatrical+Release)\n\nThe film national release date: 9/30/05."
