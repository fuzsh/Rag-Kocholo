A simple narrative with a close-knit storytelling remains in the focus area.\n\nIf the story requires an elaborate detailing, then he opts to go for digital equipment, or paint, stressing on the symbolic renditions of the narrative. At the end of the day, everything boils down to emotions and how passionate one feels, as Dave states in one of the interview questions.\n\nSoftware he uses\n\nMany of the artists and illustrators are particularly interested in the kinds of software products that Dave uses to create his marvellous and inspiring artworks, that he has relentlessly done over the years.

Dave stresses on learning the basics and implementing the knowledge repeatedly to master the skills, before moving on to master the advanced concepts of the craft. But a thing that he has always believed is not hesitating to experiment and discover newer avenues in the ever-expanding and evolving field of illustrations and artworks.\n\nInfluences\n\nWhen he was in school, his main influences were Marvel comics. He also admired illustrations in Warren magazines. Another of his primary influences form the early school days was Heavy Metal. Surreal art has had a deep impact on his craft ideas in the beginning days.
