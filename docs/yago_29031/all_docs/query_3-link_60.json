        "text": "35 years after publishing Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean’s first-ever graphic novel, Scary Monster, Lakesville Productions and Foton.Pictures have announced that development on Violent Cases is well underway with Academy Award-winning actor Ben Kingsley attached in the lead role of the Osteopath led by the creative team behind the BAFTA-nominated The Girl With All The Gifts – writer Mike Carey, director Colm McCarthy and producer Camille Gatin.\n\nViolent Cases was created by Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean. The graphic novel’s original publisher Mike Lake reached out to Neil to turn it into a feature film. Mike Lake suggested writer Mike Carey, who had previously written Lucifer and many other books in the Sandman universe.\n\nViolent Cases is a journey into the mind of Neil Gaiman, as a famous author recounts fragmented childhood memories and visits to an osteopath who once worked for Al Capone, weaving a dark and twisting tale about stories, our memory, violence and the ways we can’t escape our past.\n\nDirected by Colm McCarthy, the film will be produced by Lakesville Productions’ Edmund Kingsley, Scary Monster’s Camille Gatin and Colm McCarthy and Foton.Pictures’ Carlos Enrique Cuscó and Ari Taboada.\n\nAward-winning painter Kent Williams, legendary Frank cartoonist Jim Woodring, and the renowned Italian illustrators known as the Balbusso Twins are collaborating with Beehive Books to create lush, new illustrated editions of literary classics and forgotten gems. Having previously released six award-winning volumes with acclaimed artists Rebekka Dunlap, Brecht Evens, Dave McKean, Paul Pope, Yuko Shimizu, and Bill Sienkiewicz, Beehive Books is returning to Kickstarter with a new campaign to crowdfund three new volumes of Illuminated Editions, the company’s distinctive line of book art editions of literary classics.\n\nBeehive Books’s Illuminated Editions features some of the finest talents in contemporary art, singular design sensibilities, the highest production values, and a special emphasis on comics and graphic art. Each Illuminated Edition also features original essays from luminaries of literature, art and film, including Academy Award-winning filmmaker Guillermo Del Toro and Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Michael Cunningham\n\nThe three new titles run the gamut: one beloved classic Roaring Twenties tale of extravagance and excess, one chilling compendium of spectral Japanese folktales, and one unjustly obscure work of mind bending visionary science fiction.\n\nThe new books in the Illuminated Editions line are:\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY by F. Scott Fitzgerald, illustrated by the Balbusso Twins\n\nFeaturing an introduction by Nathan Robinson.\n\nThe Italian illustrators known as the Balbusso Twins are taking on F. Scott Fitzgerald’s THE GREAT GATSBY, bringing out the richness and satire and sorrow that suffuses this saga of wealth and corruption and decadence and love. Their modern illustration style highlights the incredible relevance of Fitzgerald’s story, which has only seemed to increase over time. Their illustrations bring us into Gatsby’s world ― but they also bring Gatsby into ours.\n\nKWAIDAN & SHADOWINGS by Lafcadio Hearn, illustrated by Kent Williams\n\nFeaturing an introduction by filmmaker Darren Aronofsky, a foreword by writer Kyoko Yoshida, and an essay by Bon Koizumi.\n\nThe great painter and multimedia artist Kent Williams is depicting the supernatural Japanese stories of Lafcadio Hearn, originally published in his books KWAIDAN and SHADOWINGS. These books are full of ghost stories, nightmares and strange tales ― of possessed forests, of monks tormented by demons and ghosts, of corpse brides, man-eating goblins, and undead samurai.\n\nA VOYAGE TO ARCTURUS by David Lindsay, illustrated by Jim Woodring\n\nFeaturing an introduction by Alan Moore.\n\nVisionary cartoonist Jim Woodring has chosen to illustrate an unclassifiable 1920 novel by the legendary British writer David Lindsay. A VOYAGE TO ARCTURUS is a baffling amalgam of mysticism, science fiction, sexual politics, and outrageous fantasy, and stands as one of the greatest works of sustained, untrammeled imagination ever achieved. Woodring’s drawings capture the writhing currents of interacting forces that lie beneath the wonderfully arcane prose.\n\nThe Illuminated Editions books come in three print editions: a slipcase hardcover, a signed and numbered edition, and a sketched and lettered edition. All nine titles in this series are available through the latest campaign and each title also comes as a DRM-free digital PDF, which is included along with every print edition.\n\nThe standard Illuminated Editions is an oversize 9×12″ hardcover, bound in sewn signatures, and housed in an elaborately embossed and debossed die-cut slipcase, silk-screened or foil-stamped with artwork. The interior is printed on creamy, acid-free heavy-weight 140gsm uncoated paper with a fine tooth, and each edition includes a minimum of ten full page illustrations, along with numerous spot drawings, illuminated letters, and special design pieces. The entire package is designed by Maëlle Doliveux with a restrained graphic boldness, and an unparalleled eye for beauty, clarity and readability. These editions have been honored with a number of awards and prizes, winning multiple Communication Arts Design Competitions, several Bronze and Silver Cubes from the Art Director’s Club, and three nominations for the Locus Awards.\n\nFrom award-winning, critically acclaimed artist and writer Dave McKean comes his first creator-owned character in a stunning visual tour-de-force graphic novel, Raptor: A Sokol Graphic Novel.\n\nRaptor flickers between two worlds and two conflicted souls: Sokol wanders a feudal fantastical landscape hunting monsters for those that can pay, and Arthur, a writer of supernatural tales in 19th Century Wales, mourning the passing of his young wife and dabbling in the supernatural in the vain hope of seeing her again. They both exist in the twilight between truth and lies, life and death, reality and the imagination.\n\nAlso available is a deluxe, oversized hardcover limited edition of Raptor: A Sokol Graphic Novel, with an exclusive signed tip-in illustration that is a perfect addition to any fan’s Dave McKean collection.\n\nRaptor: A Sokol Graphic Novel and Raptor: A Sokol Graphic Novel Limited Edition will be in comic shops on July 7, 2021 and in bookstores on July 20, 2021. They are available for pre-order on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and at your local comic shop and bookstore. Raptor: A Sokol Graphic Novel is a 128-page trade paperback that will retail for $29.99. The oversized, hardcover Raptor: A Sokol Graphic Novel Limited Edition will retail for $99.99.\n\nThis Tuesday, Mondo has part two of remaining posters from their 80 Years of Batman gallery show. This week we’re shining the Bat signal on several truly quintessential pieces of Batman covers from the ’70s and ’80s including revelatory artwork by titans of the industry including Neal Adams, Jim Aparo, Frank Miller, Todd McFarlane, and Dave McKean.\n\nMoving away from the lighter, more kid-friendly adventure comics of the ’50s and ’60s, BATMAN was returned to the more hardened “Dark Knight” vigilante we mostly associate his character with. This is largely due to the contributions from many of the artists mentioned above as well as writers Dennis O’Neil, Jim Starlin, Grant Morrison, and David Vern Reed.\n\nThese are some of the best covers in all of Batman history and Mondo is proud to celebrate the art as big as possible as beautifully printed silkscreen posters.\n\nThese posters will be available tomorrow (6/4) at a random time via mondotees.com.\n\nBATMAN 251 by Neal Adams. 24″x36″ Screenprinted Poster.
