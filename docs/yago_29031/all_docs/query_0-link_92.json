        "text": "This is a bit of an odd comparison to make, since David Lynch’s Mulholland Drive and Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean’s Mirrormask are not particularly similar to each other. This article only exists because I happened to watch both movies, which both apparently take place mostly in dream worlds, for the first time within about 24 hours of each other.\n\nOne of these films successfully creates a surreal, disturbing, and compelling dreamscape that certainly creates a visceral experience for the audience and arguably hints toward a deeper meaning. The other film is Mirrormask.\n\nWhat is it about Mulholland Drive and many of Lynch’s other films that makes the dream convincing while Mirrormask and many other films’ dreamscapes fail? I wrote up a short list, mostly because I could be actually working right now.\n\nDisclaimer: I don’t dislike Mirromask, in fact I very much enjoyed a lot of Gaiman’s clever dialogue, but overall it’s not a movie I would say is anything more than “okay.” I’m also aware that the purposes of the dreamscapes in Mulholland Drive and Mirrormask are clearly different; I’m mainly using the latter as a point of comparison to show how Lynch’s film is so effective.\n\nDon’t explicitly tell us it’s a dream. One of the first things Mirrormask and other Wonderland-esque movies do is let the audience know in no uncertain terms that the protagonist is asleep, often through some sort of “window” into the real world. Mirrormask does an odd sort of U-turn later on and claims the dream world is now some sort of parallel universe, but the damage has already been done. Once the audience knows they’re in a dream, the crucial mystery of the situation is gone. Mulholland Drive does not even contain a clearly denoted “waking up” scene, in part due to the nonlinear narrative structure.\n\nDon’t explicitly tell us what it means. The most fascinating thing about dreams is the wide range of possible interpretations that can be assigned to their content. Withholding an explanation, while still sprinkling the necessary clues into the environment, keeps the audience immersed in the dream world and guarantees they’ll continue thinking and theorizing after the credits roll.\n\nRecycle actors. Real dreams very rarely contain original characters; they almost exclusively grab people from memory and assign them a role in the dream narrative. Their personality and role can be wildly different from real life, but a familiar face showing up somewhere they don’t belong is sure to inspire speculation and give the dream world more credibility. Small cameos of minor characters work particularly well; in Mulholland Drive, seeing the hotel manager reappear as the emcee of the theatre is a fascinating little connection. Mirrormask does this as well, most notably with Helena’s mother playing two extra parts in the dream world. For some reason, Valentine shows up as a real person after the dream, which is…odd.\n\nDon’t rush. Mostly likely done in an effort to keep the runtime under 2 hours, Mirrormask‘s pacing is just a little too quick. Partly an issue with scene length, often an issue with editing, the movie just jumps around a bit too fast. Dreams, however, tend to happen in real time; when a change in location takes place, it’s in an unnoticeable, unconscious way that is impossible to emulate in film. Lynch is known for long, drawn out shots, and often substituting panning for cutting. His scripts call for seemingly random, inconsequential exchanges and actions, such as the butler serving espresso in Mulholland Drive, and his directing gives these actions all the time they need to play out in full. He also employs careful editing that makes unavoidable cuts as seamless as possible. Traditional directing calls for cutting anything that is not essential; however, dreams are not scripted, so emulating a dream requires careful loosening of control over what the audience sees.\n\nDon’t underestimate the power of sound. Epic orchestral soundtracks are lovely, but the vast majority of real people’s dreams aren’t graced by a sweeping Zimmer score. Lynch likes using electrical hums, but any ambient sound will do the trick: interesting, but not intrusive.\n\nDitch the CGI. This is the big one, and it’s a tough command to give Mirrormask, since a large chunk of the movie would be empty frames if all the CGI were removed. But in creating a convincing dreamscape it’s absolutely crucial that the audience buy into everything shown onscreen. The second that obvious computer effects show up, the illusion is weakened. Mirrormask is an extreme example of this, as the majority of the movie fills the entire screen with computer imagery that looked dated even when the movie released in 2005. Computer effects have come a long way since then, but I’ve found that most dreams are composed entirely of images that can be replicated in real life; in fact, many dreams, like that portrayed in Mulholland Drive, contain little to no fantastical imagery. Strange props, strange make-up, strange set design, sure, but if it’s not physically on camera it’s going to instantly break the audience’s immersion.\n\nThink of any other techniques for creating a compelling dreamscape?
