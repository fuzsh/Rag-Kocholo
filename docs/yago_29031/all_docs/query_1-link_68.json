It’s a movie that combines the talents of Neil Gaiman, Dave McKean and the Jim Henson Company? Consider me sold on this!\n\nHere’s a brief synopsis:\n\nMirrorMask is the story of Helena, a fifteen-year-old girl working for her family circus, who wishes – quite ironically – that she could run away from the circus and join real life. But such is not to be the case, as she finds herself on a strange journey into the Dark Lands, a fantastic landscape filled with giants, Monkeybirds and dangerous sphinxes. Helena searches for the Mirrormask, an object of enormous power that is her only hope of escaping the Dark Lands, waking the Queen of Light and returning home."
