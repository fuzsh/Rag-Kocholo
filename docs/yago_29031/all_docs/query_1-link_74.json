        "text": "Gina McKee\n\nFairly well-known in her native Britain for her work on such television series as Our Friend in the North, The Brass Eye, and The Lenny Henry Show, Gina McKee started earning recognition among transatlantic audiences with her work in a series of films during the late '90s.\n\nMcKee made her film debut in 1988, when she had a bit part as a nurse in Ken Russell's Lair of the White Worm, a camp-fest starring a then-unknown Hugh Grant. Although McKee would eventually work with Grant again eleven years later in Notting Hill, in the meantime she played bit roles in such films as The Rachel Papers (1989) and Mike Leigh's Naked (1993). In 1999 McKee could be seen in a major role in the aforementioned Notting Hill; over the course of that same year, she did more substantial work in Michael Winterbottom's ensemble family drama Wonderland, and Women Talking Dirty, the latter of which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival. McKee also had secondary roles in Mike Figgis' The Loss of Sexual Innocence and Luc Besson's The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc.\n\nRob Brydon was born in Swansea, South Wales on 3rd May 1965. He grew up in Baglan nr Port Talbot, before moving to Porthcawl where his interest in acting flourished under the guidance of Porthcawl Comprehensive School's drama teacher, Roger Burnel.\n\nAfter school Rob began a three year course at The Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardiff, but left midway through the second year to become a radio presenter for nearby BBC Wales.\n\nThere then followed six years of presenting work on local television and radio, during which time Rob would perform the odd comedy pieces including, on Radio 5's 'Rave' with Alan Thompson, the early days of Keith Barret. Whilst at the BBC Rob joined the Bath based improvisational comedy group 'More Fool Us', where he met Julia Davis with whom he would go on some years later to make the award winning 'Human Remains'. Leaving Cardiff for London, Rob worked mostly as a voice artist on animations and commercials until his role as the traffic warden in 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' prompted him to make a short video of comic characters he had created. The video, 'Rob Brydon - An Extremely Unlucky Traffic Warden' finished with Cardiff cabbie Keith Barret chatting cheerily to a camera fixed to the dashboard.\n\nDave McKean\n\nDave McKean (born 29 December 1963 in Maidenhead, England) is an illustrator, photographer, comic book artist, filmmaker and musician. His work incorporates drawing, painting, photography, collage, found objects, digital art and sculpture.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful trip to New York in 1986 during which he failed to find work as a comics artist, McKean met writer Neil Gaiman and the pair collaborated on a short graphic novel of disturbing childhood memories, Violent Cases, published in 1987. This was followed in 1988 by a Black Orchid miniseries (again with Gaiman) and Hellblazer covers for DC Comics. Beginning in 1989 he produced the covers for Gaiman's celebrated series The Sandman, all its collected editions and many of its spin-offs, and the Batman graphic novel, Arkham Asylum, with writer Grant Morrison (1989). His work during this period was often compared to that of Bill Sienkiewicz.\n\nBetween 1990 and 1996 McKean wrote and drew the ten issues of Cages, an ambitious graphic novel about artists and creativity, illustrated in a stripped-down pen and ink style influenced by José Muñoz and Lorenzo Mattotti. Cages was published as single volume by Kitchen Sink Press in 1998, and in a new edition by NBM Publishing in 2002.\n\nFurther collaborations with Gaiman produced the graphic novels Signal to Noise in 1992 (previously serialised in The Face magazine), about a dying filmmaker and his hypothetical last film, and Mr Punch, which explored similar themes as Violent Cases through the imagery of the Punch and Judy show.\n\nOutside of comics, McKean has produced CD covers for Tori Amos, Alice Cooper, Counting Crows, Michael Nyman, Toad the Wet Sprocket, Front Line Assembly, Bill Bruford and many others; book covers for Jonathan Carroll, Iain Sinclair and others, illustrations for The New Yorker, and advertising and commercial art. He has published two books of photography, A Small Book of Black and White Lies (1995) and Option: Click (1998), and a book of short comics, Pictures that Tick (2001). In 2005, he designed the poster for the 32nd Telluride Film Festival.\n\nMore recently McKean has collaborated with Neil Gaiman on two children's picture books, The Day I Swapped my Dad for Two Goldfish (1998) and The Wolves in the Walls (2003), and illustrated Gaiman's children's novel Coraline (2002), as well as S F Said's Varjak Paw (2003).\n\nMcKean is also an accomplished jazz pianist, and founded the record label Feral Records with saxophonist Ian Ballamy.\n\nNeil Gaiman\n\nA professional writer for more than twenty years, Neil Gaiman has been one of the top writers in modern comics, and is now a bestselling novelist. His work has appeared in translation in more than nineteen countries, and nearly all of his novels, graphic and otherwise, have been optioned for films. He is listed in the Dictionary of Literary Biography as one of the top ten living post-modern writers.\n\nGaiman was the creator/writer of the monthly cult DC Comics series, Sandman, which won Neil nine Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards, including the award for best writer four times, and three Harvey Awards. Sandman #19 took the 1991 World Fantasy Award for best short story, making it the first comic ever to be awarded a literary award.\n\nHis six-part fantastical TV series for the BBC, Neverwhere, was broadcast in 1996. His novel, also called Neverwhere, and set in the same strange underground world as the television series, was released in 1997; it appeared on a number of bestseller lists, including those of the Los Angeles Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, and Locus.\n\nStardust, an illustrated prose novel in four parts, began to appear from DC Comics in 1997. In 1999 Avon released the all-prose unillustrated version, which appeared on a number of bestseller lists, was selected by Publishers Weekly as one of the best books of the year, and was awarded the prestigious Mythopoeic Award as best novel for adults.\n\nAmerican Gods, a novel for adults, was published in 2001 and appeared on many best-of- the-year lists, was a New York Times bestseller in both hardcover and paperback, and won the Hugo, Nebula, SFX, Bram Stoker, and Locus Awards.\n\nCoraline (2002), his first novel for children, was a New York Times and international bestseller, was nominated for the Prix Tam Tam, and won the Elizabeth Burr/Worzalla Award, the BSFA Award, the HUgo, the Nebula and the Bram Stoker Award.\n\n2003 saw the publication of bestseller The Wolves in the Walls, a children's picture book, illustrated by Gaiman's longtime collaborator Dave McKean, which the New York Times named as one of the best illustrated books of the year; and the first Sandman graphic novel in seven years, Endless Nights, the first graphic novel to make the New York Times bestseller list.\n\nIn 2004, Gaiman published the a new graphic novel for Marvel called 1602, which was the best-selling comic of 2004, and 2005 saw the Sundance Film Festival premiere of MirrorMask, a Jim Henson Company Production written by Gaiman and directed by McKean. A lavishly designed book containing the complete script, black and white storyboards, and full-color art from the film will be published by William Morrow in early 2005; a picture book for younger readers, also written by Gaiman and illustrated with art from the movie, will be published by HarperCollins Children's Books at a later date.\n\nGaiman's official website, www.neilgaiman.com, has 400,000 unique visitors per month in 2004; close to 600,000 per month are expected in 2005. His online journal is syndicated to thousands of blog readers every day. Currently, more than 2,500 websites link to www.neilgaiman.com.\n\nBorn and raised in England, Neil Gaiman now lives near Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he is currently at work on Anansi Boys, the long-awaited follow-up to American Gods."
