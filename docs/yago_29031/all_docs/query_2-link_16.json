        "text": "Virtual Memories Show 250:\n\nDave McKean\n\n“Everything is in the words. Now matter how many pretty pictures I put in a comic, it’s never going to be worth anything without the words.”\n\nArtist, writer, illustrator, cartoonist, designer, director, composer, and all-around creative force Dave McKean joins the show to talk about how the story dictates the medium, why comics-making shouldn’t be taught, the balancing act of collaborative and solo work, the missed opportunity of Tundra Publishing, his forays into theater and film with the WildWorks team and how they taught him to give up his control-freak nature, the influence of his jazz background, why it’s okay sometimes to judge a book by its cover, the problem-solving nature of a long walk, how the early loss of his father plays out in his work, his tendency to start every project with a complete failure of confidence, and the confluence of forces that led to his amazing new book, Black Dog: The Dreams of Paul Nash ! Give it a listen! And go buy Black Dog !\n\n“Up until about 12 years old, I thought comics just arrived on the newsstand from heaven or somewhere. I didn’t realize people made a living from doing these things.”\n\nAnd what the heck: here’s a load of quotes from the episode:\n\n“I can’t do a half a life. I have to spend all my time doing the things that I feel passionate about.”\n\n“I fell in love with the process of not being in control.”\n\n“I think I went into art school in love with the surface of things, and then realized how limited that is.”\n\n“Record covers were like a little art gallery in your own home.”\n\n“I felt like whoever wrote the Photoshop manual was writing it directly for me!”\n\n“There’s a degree of inspiration in art, but I’m very interested in paying attention to what provokes that inspiration.”\n\nEnjoy the conversation!
