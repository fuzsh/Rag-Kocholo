        "text": "David \"Dave\" McKean (born December 29, 1963) is an English illustrator, photographer, comic book artist, graphic designer, filmmaker and musician who provided cover art for the comic adaptation of Alien Resurrection for Dark Horse Comics.\n\nBiography[]\n\nBorn in 1963 in Maidenhead, Berkshire, the UK-based McKean is most well known for his years of work as singular cover artist on the iconic much-acclaimed Sandman series for DC/Vertigo Comics throughout the 1980s and 90s.\n\nHis art pieces and covers often incorporate drawing, painting, photography, collage, found objects, digital art and sculpture.\n\nAfter a trip to New York in 1986 during which he failed to find work as a comics artist, McKean met writer Neil Gaiman and the pair collaborated on a short graphic novel of disturbing childhood memories, Violent Cases, published in 1987. This was followed in 1988 by a Black Orchid miniseries (again with Gaiman) and Hellblazer covers for DC Comics. Beginning in 1989 he produced the covers for Gaiman's celebrated series The Sandman, all its collected editions and many of its spin-offs, and the Batman graphic novel, Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, with writer Grant Morrison (1989). His work during this period was often compared to that of Bill Sienkiewicz. In 1995 he wrote and illustrated a book for The Rolling Stones called Voodoo Lounge to tie in with the release of their album of the same name. In 2001 he produced the short comic Pictures that Tick.\n\nIn 2005, he designed the poster for the 32nd Telluride Film Festival. In 2006, he designed projections, sets and directed film clips for the Broadway musical Lestat, adapted from Anne Rice's novels with music and lyrics by Elton John and Bernie Taupin. His most recent projects are directing an original feature called Luna, and a book with the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins.\n\nBetween 1990 and 1996 McKean wrote and drew the ten issues of Cages, an ambitious graphic novel about artists and creativity, illustrated in a stripped-down pen and ink style influenced by Alberto Breccia, José Antonio Muñoz and Lorenzo Mattotti. Cages was published as single volume by Kitchen Sink Press in 1998, and in a new edition by NBM Publishing in 2002. In 2010, Cages was released by Dark Horse Comics in paperback for the first time. Cages (1998) by Dave McKeanFurther collaborations with Gaiman produced the graphic novels Signal to Noise in 1992 (previously serialised in The Face magazine), about a dying filmmaker and his hypothetical last film, and Mr. Punch, which explored similar themes as Violent Cases through the imagery of the Punch and Judy show.\n\nMcKean has also created a few books documenting his travels using only illustrations. Examples include Postcards from Vienna, Postcards from Barcelona, Postcards from Paris (2008), and Postcards from Brussels (2009). He also wrote another book of 200 pages called Squink (éditions BdArtist(e)) that gathered a number of drawings in 15 chapters.\n\nMcKean has also worked as an artist for the music industry, providing CD covers for:\n\nAlice Cooper\n\nAltan\n\nTori Amos\n\nIain Ballamy\n\nBeliever\n\nBill Bruford and Earthworks\n\nBuckethead (for whom he also created a 3D animation in 16 mm)\n\nJohn Cale\n\nCounting Crows\n\nDali's Dilemma\n\nDisincarnate\n\nDownload\n\nDream Theater\n\nFear Factory\n\nFront Line Assembly\n\nBill Laswell\n\nMachine Head\n\nMediaeval Babes\n\nJames Murphy\n\nMy Dying Bride\n\nMichael Nyman\n\nParadise Lost\n\nSkinny Puppy\n\nStabbing Westward\n\nSuicide Silence\n\nTestament\n\nToad the Wet Sprocket\n\nHe has done book covers for:\n\nJonathan Carroll\n\nIain Sinclair\n\nSomeone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town\n\nThe Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass\n\nCoraline\n\nThe Graveyard Book\n\nThe New Yorker\n\nHe has also published four books of photography:\n\nA Small Book of Black and White Lies (1995) and\n\nOption: Click (1998),\n\nThe Particle Tarot: The Major Arcana\n\nThe Particle Tarot: The Minor Arcana\n\nMcKean designed and illustrated John Cale's autobiography What's Welsh for Zen, a further biography called Sedition and Alchemy, a box set of cd's called Circus Live, and used John's Welsh-by-way-of-New York voice as the narrator for his short film N[eon].\n\nMore recently McKean has collaborated with Neil Gaiman on two children's picture books, The Day I Swapped My Dad for Two Goldfish (1998) and The Wolves in the Walls (2003), and illustrated Gaiman's children's novels Coraline (2002) and The Graveyard Book (2008), as well as S F Said's Varjak Paw (2003). The Wolves in the Walls: a Musical Pandemonium premiered as a play in Glasgow in 2006 with Improbable and the National Theatre of Scotland. He also illustrated David Almond's The Savage published in April 2008, and Slog's Dad published in September 2010.\n\nIn 2008, McKean collaborated with Heston Blumenthal on The Big Fat Duck Cookbook, an autobiography, compilation of key recipes and insight into Blumenthal's scientific method. The book was nominated in the James Beard Foundation Awards for Cooking from a Professional Point of View and won the Photography/Illustration award.\n\nMcKean created six images for Royal Mail's Mythical Creatures collection, which featured depictions of mythical creatures found in British Folklore, including Dragons, Unicorns, Giants, Pixies, Mermaids and Fairies. The collection was released in the UK on 16 June 2009. The Presentation Pack contains short descriptions of each subject by author Neil Gaiman, someone whom has worked with McKean many times in the past.\n\nMirrorMask, McKean's first feature film as director, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2005. The screenplay was written by Neil Gaiman, from a story by Gaiman and McKean. A children's fantasy which combines live action and digital animation, Mirrormask was produced by Jim Henson Studios. Before MirrorMask, McKean directed a number of television intros and music videos as well as several short films, such as The Week Before (1998) and N[eon] (2002), which are included in the compilation DVD of McKean's work Keanoshow from Allen Spiegel Fine Arts. McKean was also a conceptual artist on Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005).\n\nMcKean has won numerous awards and accolades. Over the years, he has been nominated 5 times for a World Fantasy Award in the category of \"Artist\", and in 1991 he won the award. His graphic novel Cages won the Alph-Art, Pantera, and Harvey Awards for best Graphic Novel. He has been nominated 6 times and won 3 Spectrum Awards in the categories of \"Advertising\", \"Book\", and \"Comic\". His collection of short comics, Pictures That Tick won the V&A Museum Illustrated Book Awards Overall First Prize. In 2004, McKean won a BSFA Award in \"Short Fiction\" along with Neil Gaiman for their work, The Wolves in the Walls.
