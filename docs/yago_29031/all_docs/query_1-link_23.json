        "text": "Synopsis of Mirrormask\n\nHelena is about to embark on a most amazing journey.\n\nRaised in a family of circus performers, she’s always dreamed of leading a more ordinary life. But when haunting music draws her into a strange and magical realm, one where anything can happen, her real life is stolen by a runaway from the other side. Helena must rescue the realm from chaos in order to win back her own not-so-ordinary life.\n\nMirrorMask is a breathtaking film written by bestselling author Neil Gaiman and brought to life through the vision of acclaimed artist and director Dave McKean. This original novella is Helena’s tale in her own voice, written by master storyteller Neil Gaiman and accompanied by original art by Dave McKean and images from the film; it is a stunning and magical journey.\n\nMy Thoughts\n\nMirrormask’s protagonist Helena leads the life of most children’s dreams. She is born into a family of circus performers. Literally, the most wished-for dream aside from astronaut for most kids. Yet, Helena dreams of a more normal life. She and her mother get into an argument as kids do with their mothers and shortly thereafter Helena’s mother is hospitalized and is found to need surgery. Of course, Helena can only blame herself. That night Helena wakes into a fever dream of sorts where the fantastical and incredible come to life.\n\nOriginally Mirrormask was a movie written by Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean, and with the movies success, it was thus turned into a novel. It is surprisingly short at only 80 pages, however, the narrative of the story and visual descriptions pack a punch. Much like the movie, the book uses descriptive visual language to describe the dream atmosphere that Helena enters. It reminds me a lot of Labyrinth and Dark Crystal – Dark fantasy. All the imagery has a dark edge to it and not all is wonderful and sweet in the Mirrormask realm.\n\nThe book is great, especially if you enjoy Neil Gaiman and I do. It isn’t as good as the movie, but it is an enjoyable dark romp into the mirror realm.\n\nCheck Out Some of Our Other Stories\n\nReview Spin the Dawn by Elizabeth Lim\n\nReview The Audacity Trilogy by Laura Loup\n\nProcurement\n\nI listened to this on Scribd.\n\nAbout the Author"
