        "text": "Biography\n\nDave McKean was born in Taplow, Berkshire in 1963. He attended Berkshire College of Art and Design from 1982-86 and, before leaving, started working as an illustrator.\n\nHe was chosen by Apple as one of their thirty key creatives representing thirty years since the launch of the Apple Mac (Dave’s year was 1994, the year he created\n\nthe first Photoshop comics covers for the hugely influential Sandman series, and the first original online interactive narrative, Club Salsa).\n\nIn 1986 he met author Neil Gaiman. Their first book, Violent Cases (1987), has been printed in many editions worldwide, and adapted for the stage. They also created Black Orchid (1988), Signal To Noise (1990) for The Face magazine, and Mr. Punch (1975).

It has remained in print, and for its 30th anniversary edition, was finally digitally remastered, and included the script, notes and commentary. This book has inspired computer games and live theatrical installations.\n\nBetween 1990 and 1996, Dave also wrote and illustrated the 500pg. comic novel Cages, which won the Harvey Award for Best new comic and best graphic novel, the Ignatz Award, the International Alph Art award and Italy’s La Pantera Award.\n\n1995 saw collaborations with the Rolling Stones (The Voodoo Lounge), and Rachel Pollack (The Vertigo Tarot).\n\nHis collection of short stories in comics form, Pictures That Tick released in 2000, won the Victoria and Albert Museum Illustrated Book of the Year Award, and several of McKean’s books are in the V&A collection.\n\nAlso in 2010/11 an erotic wordless novel called Celluloid was released by Delcourt, Fantagraphics and other publishers across Europe.\n\nIn 1995 he produced the image to launch The Sony Playstation, and in 1996 was one of four photographers chosen by Kodak and Saatchi’s to launch their new colour film with a book, video and global ad package.

A book that encourages imaginative, critical, sceptical thinking, and introduces young readers (and anyone really) to the awe-inspiring real world of science.\n\nIn 1998, Dave decided to make some films. The Week Before and N[eon] are short films that played the festival circuits worldwide and N[eon] won First Prize at the Clermont-Ferrand Film Festival. These films brought Dave to the attention of Lisa Henson from the Jim Henson Company, and together with Neil Gaiman and Dave’s small crew from the shorts, they embarked on MirrorMask, a feature fantasy film for Columbia/Tristar. Premiered at the Sundance Festival in Utah, and officially selected for the Locarno, Sitges, London, Edinburgh, Sarasota, Hawaii and Dublin film festivals, it won 9 awards (including the Inaugural Black Tulip at the Amsterdam Festival) and was finally released in cinemas in 2005. Three books were released to tie in with the film including The Alchemy of MirrorMask, a lavish art book which includes all the paintings, designs and photographs made for the film.\n\nHe has also directed numerous other short films including Whack!, Dawn, Visitors and Displacements, and music films for Emilia Martensson, Stian Carstenssen, Izzy, Lowcraft and Buckethead. A collection of all Dave’s short films, music films and trailers for features, was released on blu-ray, with an accompanying book of commentary and related imagery simply called Short Films, from Dark Horse Books.\n\nAt Easter 2011, Dave travelled to Port Talbot, Wales to direct the film version of Michael Sheen’s epic three day live theatrical event the Passion of Port Talbot. A contemporary, secular re-imagining of the Passion play. Staged by Wildworks and National Theatre Wales, 20,000 visitors took part in the outdoor scenes, and a core company of nearly a 1000 locals contributed to one of the most important artistic events of the decade. The film was called The Gospel of Us, and was released by Soda Pictures in 2012. It won 2 Bafta Cymru Awards for Michael Sheen and sound wizard Ian Sands.\n\nDave’s third feature Luna premiered at the Toronto Film Festival, and was invited to many international festivals around the world including London’s Raindance, where it won Best British Feature and a BIFAward.\n\nIn 2013/14 Dave finished a new collection of short comics called Pictures that Tick 2: Exhibition, featuring several large gallery and interavtive narrative works including the Coast Road and Blue Tree (Rye Art Gallery) and The Rut (Pumphouse Gallery, London). He completed two travel sketchbooks (Perugia and Bilbao) to add to an ongoing series (Brussels, Paris, Barcelona, Vienna).\n\nIn 2015, Dave worked with Bill Mitchell and the Wildworks Theatre Company again to create Wolf’s Child, a site specific outdoor play, for the Norfolk Theatre Festival. Dave wrote the script and lyrics, and is currently compiling the footage into a new feature film. He also wrote the story, lyrics and created films for the Manchester Jazz/Literature Festival commission An Ape’s Progress, with Iain Ballamy and poet Matthew Sweeney.\n\nIn 2016, Dave wrote and illustrated Black Dog: the Dreams of Paul Nash.

It was published as an artists edition in the UK, and worldwide by Dark Horse Publishing and Glénat. Dave transferred the book to a series of projections, and wrote an hour’s worth of orchestral music and songs. This performance occurred at the Somme Memorial in Amiens, festivals in Toronto, Mumbai, Europe, and at the Tate Britain opening of Nash’s retrospective.\n\nHis graphic novel Raptor was published in 2021, and may be the first in an ongoing series featuring the traveler and hunter Sokol.\n\nRecent illustrative book projects include Caustic, a collection drawings inspired by silent erotic cinema, I Am Legend (Richard Matheson), Crime and Punishment (Fyodor Dostoevsky).

(Heston Blumenthal/Pascal Clariss), Roadside Picnic (The Strugatsky Brothers), Postcard from Venice and Postcard from Prague (sketchbooks), and Apophenia (art book).\n\nIn response to the development of artificial intelligence image creation programs like Midjourney, Dave created Prompt: Conversations with AI in twelve days. Through three short graphic story experiments, it explores the creative and ethical implications of this new technology, and asks how our working definitions of creativity, art and consciousness have shifted.\n\nDave is currently finishing a book of paintings and drawings inspired by silent cinema (Nitrate), more travel sketchbooks (Tenerife, Copenhagen and Naples) and a couple of new graphic novel projects. He is slowly editing his fourth feature based on the play Wolf’s Child, together with an accompanying short film series Unearthed.
