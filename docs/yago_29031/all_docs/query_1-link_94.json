        "text": "This blog was originally set up for Alverno College's 'Film Around the World' humanities course. It contains posts on foreign films that I have seen both in & out of class...so bear in mind that some pieces are more formally written than others. Also, when I write 'foreign' I mean films created outside of the United States, since I myself am American. Sorry about that. ^^;\n\nI myself graduated in Winter 2014 with a B.A. in English conferred with Honors. I worked as a freelance copyeditor, obtained an MLIS (IT) in Spring 2018, and am currently working as a reference librarian at a local public library. In my pastime I enjoy writing, doodling, and daydreaming. I also like to travel, play video games, and listen to retrowave. More importantly, though, I am a massive biblio/cinephile (arguably with too much time on my hands)."
