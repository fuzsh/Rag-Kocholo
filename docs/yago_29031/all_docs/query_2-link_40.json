        "text": "Originally published in the run-up to Graphic 2013 on my old The Momus Report blog, I wanted to rescue this Dave McKean interview from the dusty realm of expired website domains.\n\n‘Meet The Myth-Makers of the Modern World’ reads the promotional blurb for the 2013 GRAPHIC Festival and this year Jordan Verzar et al really have pulled out all the stops.\n\nPrevious sessions have featured guests such as Neil Gaiman and Jim Woodring — with events organised around the principle of introducing comic art to audiences through more dynamic means than you might find at a typical convention. By mixing comic art with music, animation and spoken word, GRAPHIC has drawn attention to how adaptive the medium is.\n\nNext weekend’s line-up includes comic luminaries Art Spiegelman, Grant Morrison and Len Wein, as well as the boys from Robot Chicken and Cinematic Orchestra popping over (Man With A Movie Camera is an amazing album that everyone should own).\n\nFor myself though, the highlight of the weekend’s event is Dave McKean, a unique artistic visionary who throughout his career has explored comics, music — not to mention a book collaboration with Richard Dawkins called The Magic of Reality that explains the science of existence to children — and film. On October 5 he will be presenting an original performance titled 9 Lives. McKean spoke to me about his work in comics, his transition to film and the Michael Sheen-starring experimental project The Gospel of Us.\n\nFirst of all though, what has he got in store for audiences with 9 Lives:\n\nI certainly didn’t want to just show up and do a talk, I wanted to do something a bit more interesting than that. Since it takes place in this extraordinary location I felt obliged to come up with something appropriate. So the piece is called 9 Lives — it’s nine short stories really, touching on nine people’s lives. One of them is a whole life, another is just a few minutes of a life, and the others are all somewhere in between. The stories are told as songs and we have some players on the stage. Some of them are told as just narrated stories. Then there are films and animations and images going on behind all the time. Since I have always played music and written the odd song, or music for the films I have done, it was a nice possibility to show all of these things in one show.\n\nThe more experimental approach of GRAPHIC to its comic art programme has proven to be quite inspirational for McKean in his plans for 9 Lives:\n\nComic conventions tend to be pretty similar, wherever you go in the world, the cities may change, but once you’re inside a comic convention you really could be at the same one everywhere. This one feels different. I’ve never been to it before, Neil told me a little bit about it, and I’ve seen some stills from previous festivals but it does seem to have a real identity of its own, so I’m just interested to see that. Embrace comics, take them out of the little bubble that they’re usually in and push them into the real world a little bit. I think that’s great.\n\nMcKean will also be on stage with Wein and Morrison for a panel titled The Creation Myth, promising an investigation of these three masters’ own work in comics and storytelling within the medium.\n\nThat said, McKean is perhaps best known among mainstream comic fans for his work on two very popular series — his collaboration with Neil Gaiman on the distinctive covers for Sandman and his visual translation of Grant Morrison’s famously dense and symbolic script for Batman book Arkham Asylum. McKean has a warning for 9 Lives attendees hoping for a revisit to one of his popular hits:\n\nThere’s no Arkham, there’s no superheroes, there’s none of that. There’s some strange imagery in the stories, dreamlike imagery, but they’re really all about real people and real life situations. Die hard Batman fans tempted to come along and only talk about Arkham may be a little disappointed.\n\nArkham itself is a surreal, bizarre investigation of the idea of Batman, the character’s antagonism with the assorted villains from his vigilante career depicted as a series of clashes between Jungian archetypes and literalized psychological disorders. The process of collaboration on the script led the two creators to meet halfway on this experimental take on one of the oldest American superheroes:\n\nHonestly, that was the only way I could really deal with the character. I found it quite difficult to get to grips with the idea of a man dressing up as a big bat and wandering out into the world to try and beat people up. Because the story had a very Alice in Wonderland structure to it, obviously actual references to Alice as well, with the Mad Hatter and everything, I thought it would be much more interesting that it was more mythological, as if this character is sort of a cross between a man and an animal, so that you don’t really see the edge of the costume or anything — he’s just a creature, a shadow.\n\nGrant’s original story was much more traditional but when we got together to talk about doing it, it was obvious that Grant really wanted to try new things and he was influenced by writers like Dennis Potter, and I had just discovered Czech animation, in particular Švankmajer. We had a great lunch where we sort of just threw names at each other, and it was obvious by the end of the lunch that we had to change it to make it something more interesting.\n\nMcKean’s own entry into film has been notable for the manner in which he has brought his artistic style to the moving image. Mirrormask for example was immediately recognizable as a McKean piece, and while The Gospel of Us was produced in a more stripped back manner, the upcoming Luna looks to be a return to the visuals of his installation work and photography. It doesn’t escape the comic artist turned film-maker’s attention that others have made the same journey as himself, but in reverse:\n\nIt’s been great watching people coming to the medium and bring their own knowledge and ideas about what comics can be, and expanding the medium that way. I’ve just been doing work that I think feels like my world. I’ve always loved film as well, and always wanted to try making a film, but I didn’t want to just do another film to stick on the pile of thousands that are produced every year. There are so many extraordinary directors around, extraordinary film-makers. If I’m going to try I want to try and do something that’s mine, that feels like my work.\n\nWhile The Gospel of Us might seem out of keeping with that distinctive style, the impetus behind the project itself — capture on film Michael Sheen’s performance of The Passion with the local community of Port Talbot in Wales — was clearly an artistic challenge that attracted McKean:\n\nIt’s a very strange piece. It was a big theatrical three day live event that we shot just once. We had to capture it live, while staying out of the way of everybody and not being visible. We weren’t allowed to have big cranes and be very obviously shooting it because primarily it was a theatrical piece. The whole thing is very unusual, and came about in a very unusual way, and for that alone I’m very happy with it. There are certainly some bumpy bits and some bits that don’t quite work, and bits where the theatricality of it kind of swamps the film part of it, but there are certain passages of it that I think work really beautifully and kind of unlike anything else.\n\nMcKean also crowdsourced footage from social media for the editing of the film — which came to a total of 72 hours, during which star Sheen did not break character. To have fashioned a cohesive final picture is itself remarkable. It is easy to see the appeal of the film for the director, to reshape a story instantly recognizable to many people within a new context and setting.\n\nGRAPHIC in turn has set itself the task of presenting creators like McKean, Morrison and Wein to audiences in new ways, these modern-day “myth-makers”."
