The document discusses several international parity relationships that can help explain exchange rate movements:\n\n(1) Purchasing power parity (PPP) suggests that exchange rates will adjust so that the purchasing power of currencies is equal between countries. The absolute version states identical goods will have the same price. The relative version accounts for market imperfections. \n\n(2) The Fisher effect theory states that nominal interest rates differ between countries only because of different expected inflation rates. Nominal rates equal the real required rate of return plus expected inflation.\n\n(3) Supply and demand determines exchange rates at the point where the demand and supply curves intersect. Excess demand or supply causes temporary changes rectified by market forces over time.",
