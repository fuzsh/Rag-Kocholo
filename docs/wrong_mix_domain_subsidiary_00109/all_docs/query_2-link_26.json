        "text": "The new CMS DAQ system for run-2 of the LHC\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nBawej, Tomasz; Behrens, Ulf; Branson, James; ...\n\n2015-05-21\n\nThe data acquisition (DAQ) system of the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider assembles events at a rate of 100 kHz, transporting event data at an aggregate throughput of 100 GB/s to the high level trigger (HLT) farm. The HLT farm selects interesting events for storage and offline analysis at a rate of around 1 kHz. The DAQ system has been redesigned during the accelerator shutdown in 2013/14. The motivation is twofold: Firstly, the current compute nodes, networking, and storage infrastructure will have reached the end of their lifetime by the time the LHC restarts. Secondly, in ordermoreÂ Â» to handle higher LHC luminosities and event pileup, a number of sub-detectors will be upgraded, increasing the number of readout channels and replacing the off-detector readout electronics with a Î¼TCA implementation. The new DAQ architecture will take advantage of the latest developments in the computing industry. For data concentration, 10/40 Gb/s Ethernet technologies will be used, as well as an implementation of a reduced TCP/IP in FPGA for a reliable transport between custom electronics and commercial computing hardware. A Clos network based on 56 Gb/s FDR Infiniband has been chosen for the event builder with a throughput of ~ 4 Tb/s. The HLT processing is entirely file based. This allows the DAQ and HLT systems to be independent, and to use the HLT software in the same way as for the offline processing. The fully built events are sent to the HLT with 1/10/40 Gb/s Ethernet via network file systems. Hierarchical collection of HLT accepted events and monitoring meta-data are stored into a global file system. As a result, this paper presents the requirements, technical choices, and performance of the new system.Â«Â less\n\nA data transmission method for particle physics experiments based on Ethernet physical layer\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHuang, Xi-Ru; Cao, Ping; Zheng, Jia-Jun\n\n2015-11-01\n\nDue to its advantages of universality, flexibility and high performance, fast Ethernet is widely used in readout system design for modern particle physics experiments. However, Ethernet is usually used together with the TCP/IP protocol stack, which makes it difficult to implement readout systems because designers have to use the operating system to process this protocol. Furthermore, TCP/IP degrades the transmission efficiency and real-time performance. To maximize the performance of Ethernet in physics experiment applications, a data readout method based on the physical layer (PHY) is proposed. In this method, TCP/IP is replaced with a customized and simple protocol, which makes it easier to implement. On each readout module, data from the front-end electronics is first fed into an FPGA for protocol processing and then sent out to a PHY chip controlled by this FPGA for transmission. This kind of data path is fully implemented by hardware. From the side of the data acquisition system (DAQ), however, the absence of a standard protocol causes problems for the network related applications. To solve this problem, in the operating system kernel space, data received by the network interface card is redirected from the traditional flow to a specified memory space by a customized program. This memory space can easily be accessed by applications in user space. For the purpose of verification, a prototype system has been designed and implemented. Preliminary test results show that this method can meet the requirements of data transmission from the readout module to the DAQ with an efficient and simple manner.

K.; Sahu, S. K.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nA data logger is designed to monitor and record ambient parameters such as temperature, pressure and relative humidity along with gas flow rate as a function of time. These parameters are required for understanding the characteristics of gas-filled detectors such as Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) and Multi-Wire Proportional Counter (MWPC). The data logger has different microcontrollers and has been interfaced to an ethernet port with a local LCD unit for displaying all measured parameters. In this article, the explanation of the data logger design, hardware, and software description of the master microcontroller and the DAQ system along with LabVIEW interface client program have been presented. We have implemented this device with GEM detector and displayed few preliminary results as a function of above parameters.\n\nDevelopment of a cost-effective and flexible vibration DAQ system for long-term continuous structural health monitoring\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNguyen, Theanh; Chan, Tommy H. T.; Thambiratnam, David P.; King, Les\n\n2015-12-01\n\nIn the structural health monitoring (SHM) field, long-term continuous vibration-based monitoring is becoming increasingly popular as this could keep track of the health status of structures during their service lives. However, implementing such a system is not always feasible due to on-going conflicts between budget constraints and the need of sophisticated systems to monitor real-world structures under their demanding in-service conditions. To address this problem, this paper presents a comprehensive development of a cost-effective and flexible vibration DAQ system for long-term continuous SHM of a newly constructed institutional complex with a special focus on the main building. First, selections of sensor type and sensor positions are scrutinized to overcome adversities such as low-frequency and low-level vibration measurements. In order to economically tackle the sparse measurement problem, a cost-optimized Ethernet-based peripheral DAQ model is first adopted to form the system skeleton. A combination of a high-resolution timing coordination method based on the TCP/IP command communication medium and a periodic system resynchronization strategy is then proposed to synchronize data from multiple distributed DAQ units. The results of both experimental evaluations and experimental-numerical verifications show that the proposed DAQ system in general and the data synchronization solution in particular work well and they can provide a promising cost-effective and flexible alternative for use in real-world SHM projects. Finally, the paper demonstrates simple but effective ways to make use of the developed monitoring system for long-term continuous structural health evaluation as well as to use the instrumented building herein as a multi-purpose benchmark structure for studying not only practical SHM problems but also synchronization related issues.\n\nA potent approach for the development of FPGA based DAQ system for HEP experiments\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKhan, Shuaib Ahmad; Mitra, Jubin; David, Erno; Kiss, Tivadar; Nayak, Tapan Kumar\n\n2017-10-01\n\nWith ever increasing particle beam energies and interaction rates in modern High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments in the present and future accelerator facilities, there has always been the demand for robust Data Acquisition (DAQ) schemes which perform in the harsh radiation environment and handle high data volume. The scheme is required to be flexible enough to adapt to the demands of future detector and electronics upgrades, and at the same time keeping the cost factor in mind. To address these challenges, in the present work, we discuss an efficient DAQ scheme for error resilient, high speed data communication on commercially available state-of-the-art FPGA with optical links. The scheme utilises GigaBit Transceiver (GBT) protocol to establish radiation tolerant communication link between on-detector front-end electronics situated in harsh radiation environment to the back-end Data Processing Unit (DPU) placed in a low radiation zone. The acquired data are reconstructed in DPU which reduces the data volume significantly, and then transmitted to the computing farms through high speed optical links using 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GbE). In this study, we focus on implementation and testing of GBT protocol and 10GbE links on an Intel FPGA. Results of the measurements of resource utilisation, critical path delays, signal integrity, eye diagram and Bit Error Rate (BER) are presented, which are the indicators for efficient system performance.\n\nLevel 1 Daq System for Kloe\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAloisio, A.; Cavaliere, S.; Cevenini, F.; Della Volpe, D.; Merola, L.; Anastasio, A.; Fiore, D. J.\n\nKLOE is a general purpose detector optimized to observe CP violation in K0 decays. This detector will be installed at the DAÎ¦NE Î¦-factory, in Frascati (Italy) and it is expected to run at the end of 1997. The KLOE DAQ system can be divided mainly into the front-end fast readout section (the Level 1 DAQ), the FDDI Switch and the processor farm. The total bandwidth requirement is estimated to be of the order of 50 Mbyte/s. In this paper, we describe the Level 1 DAQ section, which is based on custom protocols and hardware controllers, developed to achieve high data transfer rates and event building capabilities without software overhead.\n\nDAQ application of PC oscilloscope for chaos fiber-optic fence system based on LabVIEW\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLu, Manman; Fang, Nian; Wang, Lutang; Huang, Zhaoming; Sun, Xiaofei\n\n2011-12-01\n\nIn order to obtain simultaneously high sample rate and large buffer in data acquisition (DAQ) for a chaos fiber-optic fence system, we developed a double-channel high-speed DAQ application of a digital oscilloscope of PicoScope 5203 based on LabVIEW. We accomplished it by creating call library function (CLF) nodes to call the DAQ functions in the two dynamic link libraries (DLLs) of PS5000.dll and PS5000wrap.dll provided by Pico Technology Company. The maximum real-time sample rate of the DAQ application can reach 1GS/s. We can control the resolutions of the application at the sample time and data amplitudes by changing their units in the block diagram, and also control the start and end times of the sampling operations. The experimental results show that the application has enough high sample rate and large buffer to meet the demanding DAQ requirements of the chaos fiber-optic fence system.\n\nWeb-based DAQ systems: connecting the user and electronics front-ends\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLenzi, Thomas\n\n2016-12-01\n\nWeb technologies are quickly evolving and are gaining in computational power and flexibility, allowing for a paradigm shift in the field of Data Acquisition (DAQ) systems design. Modern web browsers offer the possibility to create intricate user interfaces and are able to process and render complex data. Furthermore, new web standards such as WebSockets allow for fast real-time communication between the server and the user with minimal overhead. Those improvements make it possible to move the control and monitoring operations from the back-end servers directly to the user and to the front-end electronics, thus reducing the complexity of the data acquisition chain. Moreover, web-based DAQ systems offer greater flexibility, accessibility, and maintainability on the user side than traditional applications which often lack portability and ease of use. As proof of concept, we implemented a simplified DAQ system on a mid-range Spartan6 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) development board coupled to a digital front-end readout chip. The system is connected to the Internet and can be accessed from any web browser. It is composed of custom code to control the front-end readout and of a dual soft-core Microblaze processor to communicate with the client.\n\nReadout electronics for CBM-TOF super module quality evaluation based on 10 Gbps ethernet\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJiang, D.; Cao, P.; Huang, X.; Zheng, J.; Wang, Q.; Li, B.; Li, J.; Liu, S.; An, Q.\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThe Compressed Baryonic Matter-Time of Flight (CBM-TOF) wall uses high performance of Multi-gap Resistive Plate Chambers (MRPC) assembled in super modules to identify charged particles with high channel density and high measurement precision at high event rate. Electronics meet the challenge for reading data out from a super module at high speed of about 6 Gbps in real time. In this paper, the readout electronics for CBM-TOF super module quality evaluation is proposed based on 10 Gigabit Ethernet. The digitized TOF data from one super module will be concentrated at the front-end electronics residing on the side of the super module and transmitted to an extreme speed readout module (XSRM) housed in the backend crate through the PCI Express (PCIe) protocol via optic channels. Eventually, the XSRM transmits data to the data acquisition (DAQ) system through four 10 Gbps Ethernet ports in real time. This readout structure has advantages of high performance and expansibility. Furthermore, it is easy to operate. Test results on the prototype show that the overall data readout performance for each XSRM can reach up to 28.8 Gbps, which means XSRM can meet the requirement of reading data out from 4 super modules with 1280 channels in real time.\n\nInexpensive DAQ based physics labs\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLewis, Benjamin; Clark, Shane\n\n2015-11-01\n\nQuality Data Acquisition (DAQ) based physics labs can be designed using microcontrollers and very low cost sensors with minimal lab equipment. A prototype device with several sensors and documentation for a number of DAQ-based labs is showcased. The device connects to a computer through Bluetooth and uses a simple interface to control the DAQ and display real time graphs, storing the data in .txt and .xls formats. A full device including a larger number of sensors combined with software interface and detailed documentation would provide a high quality physics lab education for minimal cost, for instance in high schools lacking lab equipment or students taking online classes. An entire semesterâs lab course could be conducted using a single device with a manufacturing cost of under $20.\n\nPCDAQ, A Windows Based DAQ System\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHogan, Gary\n\n1998-10-01\n\nPCDAQ is a Windows NT based general DAQ/Analysis/Monte Carlo shell developed as part of the Proton Radiography project at LANL (Los Alamos National Laboratory). It has been adopted by experiments outside of the Proton Radiography project at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and at LANL.

The DAQ (Data Acquisition System) facilities handle the data flow from the detectors electronics up to the mass storage. The DAQ system is based on a large farm of commodity hardware consisting of more than 600 devices (Linux PCs, storage, network switches), and controls hundreds of distributed hardware and software components interacting together. This paper presents Orthos, the alarm system used to detect, log, report, and follow-up abnormal situations on the DAQ machines at the experimental area. The main objective of this package is to integrate alarm detection and notification mechanisms with a full-featured issues tracker, in order to prioritize, assign, and fix system failures optimally. This tool relies on a database repository with a logic engine, SQL interfaces to inject or query metrics, and dynamic web pages for user interaction. We describe the system architecture, the technologies used for the implementation, and the integration with existing monitoring tools.\n\nEthernet-based test stand for a CAN network\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZiebinski, Adam; Cupek, Rafal; Drewniak, Marek\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThis paper presents a test stand for the CAN-based systems that are used in automotive systems. The authors propose applying an Ethernet-based test system that supports the virtualisation of a CAN network. The proposed solution has many advantages compared to classical test beds that are based on dedicated CAN-PC interfaces: it allows the physical constraints associated with the number of interfaces that can be simultaneously connected to a tested system to be avoided, which enables the test time for parallel tests to be shortened; the high speed of Ethernet transmission allows for more frequent sampling of the messages that are transmitted by a CAN network (as the authors show in the experiment results section) and the cost of the proposed solution is much lower than the traditional lab-based dedicated CAN interfaces for PCs.\n\nEthernet for Aerospace Applications - Ethernet Heads for the Skies\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGrams, Paul R.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nOne of the goals of aerospace applications is to reduce the cost and complexity of avionic systems. Ethernet is a highly scalable, flexible, and popular protocol. The aerospace market is large, with a forecasted production of over 50,000 turbine-powered aircraft valued at $1.7 trillion between 2012 and 2022. Boeing estimates demand for commercial aircraft by 2033 to total over 36,000 with a value of over $5 trillion. In 2014 US airlines served over 750 million passengers and this is growing over 2% yearly. Electronic fly-by-wire is now used for all airliners and high performance aircraft. Although Ethernet has been widely used for four decades, its use in aerospace applications is just beginning to become common. Ethernet is the universal solution in commercial networks because of its high bandwidths, lower cost, openness, reliability, maintainability, flexibility, and interoperability. However, when Ethernet was designed applications with time-critical, safety relevant and deterministic requirements were not given much consideration. Many aerospace applications use a variety of communication architectures that add cost and complexity. Some of them are SpaceWire, MIL-STD-1553, Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX), and Time-Triggered Ethernet (TTE). Aerospace network designers desire to decrease the number of networks to reduce cost and effort while improving scalability, flexibility, openness, maintainability, and reliability. AFDX and TTE are being considered more for critical aerospace systems because they provide redundancy, failover protection, guaranteed timing, and frame priority and are based on Ethernet IEEE 802.3. This paper explores the use of AFDX and TTE for aerospace applications.\n\nOptical Ethernet\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChan, Calvin C. K.; Lam, Cedric F.; Tsang, Danny H. K.\n\n2005-09-01\n\nCall for Papers: Optical Ethernet The Journal of Optical Networking (JON) is soliciting papers for a second feature issue on Optical Ethernet. Ethernet has evolved from a LAN technology connecting desktop computers to a universal broadband network interface.

The embedded microcontroller was mounted on the front-end I/O cards with software packages such as Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) and Real Time Executive for Multiprocessor System (RTEMS) running as an Input/Output Controller (IOC). By cross compiling with the EPICS, the RTEMS kernel, IOC device supports, and databases all of these can be downloaded into the microcontroller. The first version of the BPM electronics based on the embedded controller wasmoreÂ Â» built and is currently running in our FEL system. The new version of BPM that will use a Single Board IOC (SBIOC), which integrates with an Field Programming Gate Array (FPGA) and a ColdFire embedded microcontroller, is presently under development. The new system has the features of a low cost IOC, an open source real-time operating system, plug&play-like ease of installation and flexibility, and provides a much more localized solution.Â«Â less\n\nUpgrade of the TOTEM DAQ using the Scalable Readout System (SRS)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nQuinto, M.; Cafagna, F.; Fiergolski, A.; Radicioni, E.\n\n2013-11-01\n\nThe main goals of the TOTEM Experiment at the LHC are the measurements of the elastic and total p-p cross sections and the studies of the diffractive dissociation processes. At LHC, collisions are produced at a rate of 40 MHz, imposing strong requirements for the Data Acquisition Systems (DAQ) in terms of trigger rate and data throughput. The TOTEM DAQ adopts a modular approach that, in standalone mode, is based on VME bus system. The VME based Front End Driver (FED) modules, host mezzanines that receive data through optical fibres directly from the detectors. After data checks and formatting are applied in the mezzanine, data is retransmitted to the VME interface and to another mezzanine card plugged in the FED module. The VME bus maximum bandwidth limits the maximum first level trigger (L1A) to 1 kHz rate. In order to get rid of the VME bottleneck and improve scalability and the overall capabilities of the DAQ, a new system was designed and constructed based on the Scalable Readout System (SRS), developed in the framework of the RD51 Collaboration. The project aims to increase the efficiency of the actual readout system providing higher bandwidth, and increasing data filtering, implementing a second-level trigger event selection based on hardware pattern recognition algorithms. This goal is to be achieved preserving the maximum back compatibility with the LHC Timing, Trigger and Control (TTC) system as well as with the CMS DAQ. The obtained results and the perspectives of the project are reported. In particular, we describe the system architecture and the new Opto-FEC adapter card developed to connect the SRS with the FED mezzanine modules. A first test bench was built and validated during the last TOTEM data taking period (February 2013). Readout of a set of 3 TOTEM Roman Pot silicon detectors was carried out to verify performance in the real LHC environment. In addition, the test allowed a check of data consistency and quality.\n\nDevelopment of the New DAQ System for the SD Array of TAÃ4 and TALE\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTakahashi, Yuichi; Sahara, Ryosuke; Konishi, Shogo; Goto, Takashi; Ogio, Shoichi\n\nThe data acquisition (DAQ) system for the surface detector (SD) arrays of TAÃ4 and TALE will be presented. Each SD records digital signals with 50â MHz FADCs and sends the data to a central communication center (of the \"communication tower\") via a wireless network system. The technique employed here is based on the currently-running DAQ system of the Telescope Array, and there are some improvements including i) replacement of a wireless LAN module with a custom protocol to another with TCP/IP, and ii) replacement of the \"tower electronics\" to a generic Linux board PC of Raspberry Pi Type II B.

We are currently designing and constructing information processing system for a Serendipter. The information processing system for Serendipter is a kind of sensor-fusion system but with much more difficulties: To fulfill these requirements, we adopt All IP based architecture: All IP-Ethernet based data processing system consists of (1) sensor/detector directly output data as IP-Ethernet packet stream, (2) single Ethernet/TCP/IP streams by a L2 100Gbps Ethernet switch, (3) An FPGA board with 100Gbps Ethernet I/F connected to the switch and a Xeon based server.

In order to cope with the increased machine luminosity and the higher statistic required by the extension of the TOTEM physics program, approved for the LHC's Run Two phase, the previous VME based data acquisition system has been replaced with a new one based on the Scalable Readout System. The system features an aggregated data throughput of 2GB / s towards the online storage system. This makes it possible to sustain a maximum trigger rate of Ë 24kHz, to be compared with the 1KHz rate of the previous system. The trigger rate is further improved by implementing zero-suppression and second-level hardware algorithms in the Scalable Readout System. The new system fulfils the requirements for an increased efficiency, providing higher bandwidth, and increasing the purity of the data recorded. Moreover full compatibility has been guaranteed with the legacy front-end hardware, as well as with the DAQ interface of the CMS experiment and with the LHC's Timing, Trigger and Control distribution system. In this contribution we describe in detail the architecture of full system and its performance measured during the commissioning phase at the LHC Interaction Point.\n\nResearch of Fast DAQ system in KSTAR Thomson scattering diagnostic\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLee, J. H.; Kim, H. J.; Yamada, I.; Funaba, H.; Kim, Y. G.; Kim, D. Y.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe Thomson scattering diagnostic is one of the most important diagnostic systems in fusion plasma research. It provides reliable electron temperature and density profiles in magnetically confined plasma. A Q-switched Nd:YAG Thomson system was installed several years ago in KSTAR tokamak to measure the electron temperature and density profiles. For the KSTAR Thomson scattering system, a Charge-to-Digital Conversion (QDC) type data acquisition system was used to measure a pulse type Thomson signal. Recently, however, an error was found during the Te, ne calculation, because the QDC system had integrated the pulse Thomson signal that included a signal similar to stray light. To overcome such errors, we introduce a fast data acquisition (F-DAQ) system. To test this, we use CAEN V1742 5 GS/s, a Versa Module Eurocard Bus (VMEbus) type 12-bit switched capacitor digitizer with 32 channels. In this experiment, we compare the calculated Te results of Thomson scattering data measured simultaneously using QDC and F-DAQ. In the F-DAQ system, the shape of the pulse was restored by fitting.\n\nEfficient Data Transfer Rate and Speed of Secured Ethernet Interface System.\n\nPubMed\n\nGhanti, Shaila; Naik, G M\n\n2016-01-01\n\nEmbedded systems are extensively used in home automation systems, small office systems, vehicle communication systems, and health service systems. The services provided by these systems are available on the Internet and these services need to be protected. Security features like IP filtering, UDP protection, or TCP protection need to be implemented depending on the specific application used by the device. Every device on the Internet must have network interface. This paper proposes the design of the embedded Secured Ethernet Interface System to protect the service available on the Internet against the SYN flood attack.

We encountered a number of performance and stability issues, which were promptly dealt with by SGI and S2io. Using nttcp we tested TCP performance for single and multiple streams, and we tested file transfer using NFS and bbftp. We will present the results of our testing, including the effects of various tuning options on throughput and CPU utilization, and offer suggestions for configuring and tuning S2io 10 Gigabit Ethernet cards in an Altix/Linux or Origin/Irix environment.\n\nEthernet-Based Services for Next Generation Networks\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHernandez-Valencia, Enrique\n\nOver the last few years, Ethernet technology and services have emerged as an indispensable component of the broadband networking and telecommunications infrastructure, both for network operators and service providers. As an example, Worldwide Enterprise customer demand for Ethernet services by itself is expected to hit the 30B US mark by year 2012. Use of Ethernet technology in the feeder networks that support residential applications, such as \"triple play\" voice, data, and video services, is equally on the rise. As the synergies between packet-aware transport and service oriented equipment continue to be exploited in the path toward transport convergence. Ethernet technology is expected to play a critical part in the evolution toward converged Optical/Packet Transport networks. Here we discuss the main business motivations, services, and technologies driving the specifications of so-called carrier Ethernet and highlight challenges associated with delivering the expectations for low implementation complexity, easy of use, provisioning and management of networks and network elements embracing this technology.\n\nThe ALICE DAQ infoLogger\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChapeland, S.; Carena, F.; Carena, W.; Chibante Barroso, V.; Costa, F.; DÃ©nes, E.; DiviÃ , R.; Fuchs, U.; Grigore, A.; Ionita, C.; Delort, C.; Simonetti, G.; SoÃ³s, C.; Telesca, A.; Vande Vyvre, P.; Von Haller, B.; Alice Collaboration\n\n2014-04-01\n\nALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a heavy-ion experiment studying the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at the CERN LHC (Large Hadron Collider). The ALICE DAQ (Data Acquisition System) is based on a large farm of commodity hardware consisting of more than 600 devices (Linux PCs, storage, network switches). The DAQ reads the data transferred from the detectors through 500 dedicated optical links at an aggregated and sustained rate of up to 10 Gigabytes per second and stores at up to 2.5 Gigabytes per second. The infoLogger is the log system which collects centrally the messages issued by the thousands of processes running on the DAQ machines. It allows to report errors on the fly, and to keep a trace of runtime execution for later investigation. More than 500000 messages are stored every day in a MySQL database, in a structured table keeping track for each message of 16 indexing fields (e.g. time, host, user, ...). The total amount of logs for 2012 exceeds 75GB of data and 150 million rows. We present in this paper the architecture and implementation of this distributed logging system, consisting of a client programming API, local data collector processes, a central server, and interactive human interfaces. We review the operational experience during the 2012 run, in particular the actions taken to ensure shifters receive manageable and relevant content from the main log stream. Finally, we present the performance of this log system, and future evolutions.\n\nAn ethernet/IP security review with intrusion detection applications\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLaughter, S. A.; Williams, R. D.\n\n2006-07-01\n\nSupervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and automation networks, used throughout utility and manufacturing applications, have their own specific set of operational and security requirements when compared to corporate networks. The modern climate of heightened national security and awareness of terrorist threats has made the security of these systems of prime concern. There is a need to understand the vulnerabilities of these systems and how to monitor and protect them. Ethernet/IP is a member of a family of protocols based on the Control and Information Protocol (CIP). Ethernet/IP allows automation systems to be utilized on and integrated with traditional TCP/IPmoreÂ Â» networks, facilitating integration of these networks with corporate systems and even the Internet. A review of the CIP protocol and the additions Ethernet/IP makes to it has been done to reveal the kind of attacks made possible through the protocol. A set of rules for the SNORT Intrusion Detection software is developed based on the results of the security review. These can be used to monitor, and possibly actively protect, a SCADA or automation network that utilizes Ethernet/IP in its infrastructure.

A.\n\n2014-08-01\n\nContinuous advances in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and the increased complexity of their applications raise the demand for improved data acquisition systems (DAQ). These improvements may comprise low power consumption, low volume and weight, robustness, modularity and capability to interface with various sensors and peripherals while maintaining the high sampling rates and processing speeds. Such a system has been designed and developed and is currently integrated on the Autonomous Flying Platforms for Atmospheric and Earth Surface Observations (APAESO/NEA-YÎ OÎOMH/NEKÎ /0308/09) however, it can be easily adapted to any UAV or any other mobile vehicle. The system consists of a single-board computer with a dual-core processor, rugged surface-mount memory and storage device, analog and digital input-output ports and many other peripherals that enhance its connectivity with various sensors, imagers and on-board devices. The system is powered by a high efficiency power supply board. Additional boards such as frame-grabbers, differential global positioning system (DGPS) satellite receivers, general packet radio service (3G-4G-GPRS) modems for communication redundancy have been interfaced to the core system and are used whenever there is a mission need. The onboard DAQ system can be preprogrammed for automatic data acquisition or it can be remotely operated during the flight from the ground control station (GCS) using a graphical user interface (GUI) which has been developed and will also be presented in this paper. The unique design of the GUI and the DAQ system enables the synchronized acquisition of a variety of scientific and UAV flight data in a single core location. The new DAQ system and the GUI have been successfully utilized in several scientific UAV missions. In conclusion, the novel DAQ system provides the UAV and the remote-sensing community with a new tool capable of reliably acquiring, processing, storing and transmitting data from any sensor integrated\n\nartdaq: DAQ software development made simple\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBiery, Kurt; Flumerfelt, Eric; Freeman, John; Ketchum, Wesley; Lukhanin, Gennadiy; Rechenmacher, Ron\n\n2017-10-01\n\nFor a few years now, the artdaq data acquisition software toolkit has provided numerous experiments with ready-to-use components which allow for rapid development and deployment of DAQ systems. Developed within the Fermilab Scientific Computing Division, artdaq provides data transfer, event building, run control, and event analysis functionality. This latter feature includes built-in support for the art event analysis framework, allowing experiments to run art modules for real-time filtering, compression, disk writing and online monitoring. As art, also developed at Fermilab, is also used for offline analysis, a major advantage of artdaq is that it allows developers to easily switch between developing online and offline software. artdaq continues to be improved. Support for an alternate mode of running whereby data from some subdetector components are only streamed if requested has been added; this option will reduce unnecessary DAQ throughput. Real-time reporting of DAQ metrics has been implemented, along with the flexibility to choose the format through which experiments receive the reports; these formats include the Ganglia, Graphite and syslog software packages, along with flat ASCII files. Additionally, work has been performed investigating more flexible modes of online monitoring, including the capability to run multiple online monitoring processes on different hosts, each running its own set of art modules. Finally, a web-based GUI interface through which users can configure details of their DAQ system has been implemented, increasing the ease of use of the system. Already successfully deployed on the LArlAT, DarkSide-50, DUNE 35ton and Mu2e experiments, artdaq will be employed for SBND and is a strong candidate for use on ICARUS and protoDUNE. With each experiment comes new ideas for how artdaq can be made more flexible and powerful. The above improvements will be described, along with potential ideas for the future.\n\nTime Triggered Ethernet System Testing Means and Method\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSmithgall, William Todd (Inventor); Hall, Brendan (Inventor); Varadarajan, Srivatsan (Inventor)\n\n2014-01-01\n\nMethods and apparatus are provided for evaluating the performance of a Time Triggered Ethernet (TTE) system employing Time Triggered (TT) communication.

A simulation system is also provided having input simulators that communicate using TT messages via one or more second TTE switches with the same output elements during a second time interval schedule established for the simulation system. The first and second time interval schedules are off-set slightly so that messages from the input simulators, when present, arrive at the output elements prior to messages from the analogous real inputs, thereby having priority over messages from the real inputs and causing the system to operate based on the simulated inputs when present.\n\nEthernet-based smart networked elements (sensors and actuators)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMata, Carlos T.; Perotti, JosÃ© M.; Oostdyk, Rebecca L.; Lucena, Angel\n\n2006-05-01\n\nThis paper outlines the present design approach for the Ethernet-Based Smart Networked Elements (SNE) being developed by NASA's Instrumentation Branch and the Advanced Electronics and Technology Development Laboratory of ASRC Aerospace Corporation at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The SNEs are being developed as part of the Integrated Intelligent Health Management System (IIHMS), jointly developed by Stennis Space Center (SSC), KSC, and Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). SNEs are sensors/actuators with embedded intelligence, capable of networking among themselves and with higher-level systems (external processors and controllers) to provide not only instrumentation data but also associated data validity qualifiers. NASA KSC has successfully developed and preliminarily demonstrated this new generation of SNEs. SNEs that collect pressure, strain, and temperature measurements (including cryogenic temperature ranges) have been developed and tested in the laboratory and are ready for demonstration in the field.\n\nEthernet direct display: a new dimension for in-vehicle video connectivity solutions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRowley, Vincent\n\n2009-05-01\n\nTo improve the local situational awareness (LSA) of personnel in light or heavily armored vehicles, most military organizations recognize the need to equip their fleets with high-resolution digital video systems. Several related upgrade programs are already in progress and, almost invariably, COTS IP/Ethernet is specified as the underlying transport mechanism. The high bandwidths, long reach, networking flexibility, scalability, and affordability of IP/Ethernet make it an attractive choice. There are significant technical challenges, however, in achieving high-performance, real-time video connectivity over the IP/Ethernet platform. As an early pioneer in performance-oriented video systems based on IP/Ethernet, Pleora Technologies has developed core expertise in meeting these challenges and applied a singular focus to innovating within the required framework. The company's field-proven iPORTTM Video Connectivity Solution is deployed successfully in thousands of real-world applications for medical, military, and manufacturing operations. Pleora's latest innovation is eDisplayTM, a smallfootprint, low-power, highly efficient IP engine that acquires video from an Ethernet connection and sends it directly to a standard HDMI/DVI monitor for real-time viewing. More costly PCs are not required. This paper describes Pleora's eDisplay IP Engine in more detail. It demonstrates how - in concert with other elements of the end-to-end iPORT Video Connectivity Solution - the engine can be used to build standards-based, in-vehicle video systems that increase the safety and effectiveness of military personnel while fully leveraging the advantages of the lowcost COTS IP/Ethernet platform.\n\nEthernet for Space Flight Applications\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWebb, Evan; Day, John H. (Technical Monitor)\n\n2002-01-01\n\nNASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is adapting current data networking technologies to fly on future spaceflight missions. The benefits of using commercially based networking standards and protocols have been widely discussed and are expected to include reduction in overall mission cost, shortened integration and test (I&T) schedules, increased operations flexibility, and hardware and software upgradeability/scalability with developments ongoing in the commercial world. The networking effort is a comprehensive one encompassing missions ranging from small University Explorer (UNEX) class spacecraft to large observatories such as the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST). Mission aspects such as flight hardware and software, ground station hardware and software, operations, RF communications, and security (physical and electronic) are all being addressed to ensure a complete end-to-end system solution. One of the current networking development efforts at GSFC is the SpaceLAN (Spacecraft Local Area Network) project, development of a space-qualifiable Ethernet network. To this end we have purchased an IEEE 802.3-compatible 10/100/1000 Media Access Control (MAC) layer Intellectual Property (IP) core and are designing a network node interface (NNI) and associated network components such as a switch. These systems will ultimately allow the replacement of the typical MIL-STD-1553/1773 and custom interfaces that inhabit most spacecraft. In this paper we will describe our current Ethernet NNI development along with a novel new space qualified physical layer that will be used in place of the standard interfaces. We will outline our plans for development of space qualified network components that will allow future spacecraft to operate in significant radiation environments while using a single onboard network for reliable commanding and data transfer. There will be a brief discussion of some issues surrounding system implications of a flight Ethernet.

However the common learning media still has not implemented a monitoring system in their learning process. This research was conducted to implement monitoring system in the mannequin head prototype as a learning media of facial acupressure using Bluetooth, wireless and Ethernet. The results of the implementation of monitoring system in the prototype showed that there were differences in the delay time between Bluetooth and wireless or Ethernet. The results data showed no difference in the average delay time between the use of Bluetooth with wireless and the use of Bluetooth with Ethernet in monitoring system of facial acupressure learning media. From all the facial acupressure points, the forehead facial acupressure point has the longest delay time of 11.93 seconds. The average delay time in all 3 class rooms was 1.96 seconds therefore the use of Bluetooth, wireless and Ethernet is highly recommended in the monitoring system of facial acupressure.\n\nFast BPM data distribution for global orbit feedback using commercial gigabit ethernet technology\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHulsart, R.; Cerniglia, P.; Michnoff, R.\n\n2011-03-28\n\nIn order to correct beam perturbations in RHIC around 10Hz, a new fast data distribution network was required to deliver BPM position data at rates several orders of magnitude above the capability of the existing system. The urgency of the project limited the amount of custom hardware that could be developed, which dictated the use of as much commercially available equipment as possible. The selected architecture uses a custom hardware interface to the existing RHIC BPM electronics together with commercially available Gigabit Ethernet switches to distribute position data to devices located around the collider ring. Using the minimum Ethernet packetmoreÂ Â» size and a field programmable gate array (FPGA) based state machine logic instead of a software based driver, real-time and deterministic data delivery is possible using Ethernet. The method of adapting this protocol for low latency data delivery, bench testing of Ethernet hardware, and the logic to construct Ethernet packets using FPGA hardware will be discussed. A robust communications system using almost all commercial off-the-shelf equipment was developed in under a year which enabled retrofitting of the existing RHIC BPM system to provide 10 KHz data delivery for a global orbit feedback scheme using 72 BPMs. Total latencies from data acquisition at the BPMs to delivery at the controller modules, including very long transmission distances, were kept under 100 {micro}s, which provide very little phase error in correcting the 10 Hz oscillations. Leveraging off of the speed of Gigabit Ethernet and wide availability of Ethernet products enabled this solution to be fully implemented in a much shorter time and at lower cost than if a similar network was developed using a proprietary method.Â«Â less\n\nFuture of DAQ Frameworks and Approaches, and Their Evolution towards the Internet of Things\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNeufeld, Niko\n\n2015-12-01\n\nNowadays, a DAQ system is a complex network of processors, sensors and many other active devices. Historically, providing a framework for DAQ has been a very important role of host institutes of experiments. Reviewing evolution of such DAQ frameworks is a very interesting subject of the conference. âInternet of Thingsâ is a recent buzz word but a DAQ framework could be a good example of IoT.\n\nInterfacing the Controllogics PLC over Ethernet/IP.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKasemir, K.

The ControlLogix Ethernet interface module 1756-ENET uses EtherNet/IP, the ControlNet protocol [2], encapsulated in Ethernet packages, with specific service codes [3]. A driver for the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) has been developed that utilizes this EtherNet/IP protocol for controllers running the vxWorks RTOS as well as a Win32 and Unix/Linux test program.

We show that our system attains the theoretical maximum performance in the short packet which is difficult to realize until now.\n\nA DAQ-Device-Based Continuous Wave Near-Infrared Spectroscopy System for Measuring Human Functional Brain Activity\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLi, Xiaoli; Liu, Xiaomin\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn the last two decades, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is getting more and more popular as a neuroimaging technique. The fNIRS instrument can be used to measure local hemodynamic response, which indirectly reflects the functional neural activities in human brain. In this study, an easily implemented way to establish DAQ-device-based fNIRS system was proposed. Basic instrumentation components (light sources driving, signal conditioning, sensors, and optical fiber) of the fNIRS system were described. The digital in-phase and quadrature demodulation method was applied in LabVIEW software to distinguish light sources from different emitters. The effectiveness of the custom-made system was verified by simultaneous measurement with a commercial instrument ETG-4000 during Valsalva maneuver experiment. The light intensity data acquired from two systems were highly correlated for lower wavelength (Pearson's correlation coefficient r = 0.92, P < 0.01) and higher wavelength (r = 0.84, P < 0.01). Further, another mental arithmetic experiment was implemented to detect neural activation in the prefrontal cortex. For 9 participants, significant cerebral activation was detected in 6 subjects (P < 0.05) for oxyhemoglobin and in 8 subjects (P < 0.01) for deoxyhemoglobin.

For decades, the IEEE standard that defines Ethernet has required electrical isolation between the twisted pair cable and the Ethernet device. So, for decades, every Ethernet interface has used magnetic core Ethernet transformers to isolate Ethernet devices and keep users safe in the event of a potentially dangerous fault on the network media. The current state-of-the-art Ethernet transformers are miniature (<5mm diameter) ferrite-core toroids wrapped with approximately 10 to 30 turns of wire. As small as current Ethernet transformers are, they still limit further Ethernet device miniaturization and require a separate bulky package or jack housing. New coupler designs must be explored which are capable of exceptional miniaturization or on-chip fabrication. This dissertation thoroughly explores the performance of the current commercial Ethernet transformers to both increase understanding of the device's behavior and outline performance parameters for replacement devices. Lumped element and distributed circuit models are derived; testing schemes are developed and used to extract model parameters from commercial Ethernet devices. Transfer relation measurements of the commercial Ethernet transformers are compared against the model's behavior and it is found that the tuned, distributed models produce the best transfer relation match to the measured data. Process descriptions and testing results on fabricated thin-film dielectric-core toroid transformers are presented. The best results were found for a 32-turn transformer loaded with 100Î©, the impedance of twisted pair cable. This transformer gave a flat response from about 10MHz to 40MHz with a height of approximately 0.45. For the fabricated transformer structures, theoretical methods to determine resistance, capacitance and inductance are presented.

During these LS phases both the LHC, and the experiments around its ring, undergo maintenance and upgrades. For the LHC these upgrades improve their ability to create data for physicists; the more data the LHC can create the more opportunities there are for rare events to appear that physicists will be interested in. The experiments upgrade so they can record the data and ensure the event won't be missed. Currently the LHC is in Run 2 having completed the first LS of three. This thesis focuses on the development of Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based readout systems that span across three major tasks of the ATLAS Pixel data acquisition (DAQ) system. The evolution of Pixel DAQ's Readout Driver (ROD) card is presented. Starting from improvements made to the new Insertable B-Layer (IBL) ROD design, which was part of the LS1 upgrade; to upgrading the old RODs from Run 1 to help them run more efficiently in Run 2.

C.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe upgrade of the particle detectors for the HL-LHC or for future colliders requires an extensive program of tests to qualify different detector prototypes with dedicated test beams. A common data-acquisition system, H4DAQ, was developed for the H4 test beam line at the North Area of the CERN SPS in 2014 and it has since been adopted in various applications for the CMS experiment and AIDA project. Several calorimeter prototypes and precision timing detectors have used our system from 2014 to 2017. H4DAQ has proven to be a versatile application and has been ported to many other beam test environments. H4DAQ is fast, simple, modular and can be configured to support various kinds of setup. The functionalities of the DAQ core software are split into three configurable finite state machines: data readout, run control, and event builder. The distribution of information and data between the various computers is performed using ZEROMQ (0MQ) sockets. Plugins are available to read different types of hardware, including VME crates with many types of boards, PADE boards, custom front-end boards and beam instrumentation devices. The raw data are saved as ROOT files, using the CERN C++ ROOT libraries. A Graphical User Interface, based on the python gtk libraries, is used to operate the H4DAQ and an integrated data quality monitoring (DQM), written in C++, allows for fast processing of the events for quick feedback to the user. As the 0MQ libraries are also available for the National Instruments LabVIEW program, this environment can easily be integrated within H4DAQ applications.\n\nEthernet ring protection with managed FDB using APS payload\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIm, Jinsung; Ryoo, Jeong-dong; Joo, Bheom Soon; Rhee, J.-K.

The physics program of the experiment requires the Level 3 data acquisition (DAQ) system system to handle average event sizes of 250 kilobytes at a rate of 1 kHz. The system routes and transfers event fragments of approximately 1-20 kilobytes from 63 VME crate sources to any of approximately 100 processing nodes.

First, an asymmetric network load, due to the requests of a large number of PACS clients for only a few main servers, should be compensated by communication links to the servers with a higher bandwidth compared to the clients. Secondly, as the number of PACS nodes increases, the network throughout should not measurably cut production. These requirements can easily be fulfilled using switching technologies. Here asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) is clearly one of the hottest topics in networking because the ATM architecture provides integrated support for a variety of communication services, and it supports virtual networking. On the other hand, most of the imaging modalities are not yet ready for integration into a native ATM network. For a lot of nodes already joining an Ethernet, a cost-effective and pragmatic way to benefit from the switching concept would be a combined ATM/Ethernet switching environment. This incorporates an incremental migration strategy with the immediate benefits of high-speed, high-capacity ATM (for servers and high-sophisticated display workstations), while preserving elements of the existing network technologies. In addition, Ethernet switching instead of shared media Ethernet improves the performance considerably. The LAN emulation (LANE) specification by the ATM forum defines mechanisms that allow ATM networks to coexist with legacy systems using any data networking protocol. This paper points out the suitability of this network architecture in accordance with an appropriate system design.\n\nInterfacing the VAX 11/780 Using Berkeley Unix 4.2.BSD and Ethernet Based Xerox Network Systems.

All these FPGAs in a large system have to share a common state like a trigger number or an epoch counter to keep the system synchronized for a consistent event/epoch building. Additionally, the collected data has to be transported with high bandwidth, optionally via the ubiquitous Ethernet protocol. Furthermore, the FPGAs' internal states and configuration memories have to be accessed for control and monitoring purposes. Another requirement for a modern DAQ-network is the fault-tolerance for intermittent data errors in the form of automatic retransmission of faulty data. As FPGAs suffer from Single Event Effects when exposed to ionizing particles, the system has to deal with failing FPGAs. The TrbNet protocol was developed taking all these requirements into account. Three virtual channels are merged on one physical medium: The trigger/epoch information is transported with the highest priority. The data channel is second in the priority order, while the control channel is the last. Combined with a small frame size of 80 bit this guarantees a low latency data transport: A system with 100 front-ends can be built with a one-way latency of 2.2 us. The TrbNet-protocol was implemented in each of the 550 FPGAs of the HADES upgrade project and has been successfully used during the Au+Au campaign in April 2012. With 2á¹¡106/s Au-ions and 3% interaction ratio the accepted trigger rate is 10 kHz while data is written to storage with 150 MBytes/s. Errors are reliably mitigated via the implemented retransmission of packets and auto-shut-down of individual links. TrbNet was also used for full monitoring of the FEE status. The network stack is written in VHDL and was successfully deployed on various Lattice and Xilinx devices. The TrbNet is also\n\nGigabit Ethernet: A Technical Assessment.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAxner, David\n\n1997-01-01\n\nDescribes gigabit ethernet for LAN (local area network) technology that will expand ethernet bandwidth.

Still, the DAQ system can be one of the few forces that drive towards the integration of otherwise loosely coupled detector systems. As such it may be hard to complete with off-the-shelf components only. LabVIEW and ROOT are the (only) two software systems that were assumed to be familiar enough to all collaborators of the AEá¸¡IS (AD6) experiment at CERN: working out of the GXML representation of LabVIEW Data types, a semantically equivalent representation as ROOT TTrees was developed for permanent storage and analysis. All data in the experiment is cast into this common format and can be produced and consumed on both systems and transferred over TCP and/or multicast over UDP for immediate sharing over the experiment LAN. We describe the setup that has been able to cater to all run data logging and long term monitoring needs of the AEá¸¡IS experiment so far.\n\nCalculating distance by wireless ethernet signal strength for global positioning method\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKim, Seung-Yong; Kim, Jeehong; Lee, Chang-goo\n\n2005-12-01\n\nThis paper investigated mobile robot localization by using wireless Ethernet for global localization and INS for relative localization. For relative localization, the low-cost INS features self-contained was adopted. Low-cost MEMS-based INS has a short-period response and acceptable performance. Generally, variety sensor was used for mobile robot localization. In spite of precise modeling of the sensor, it leads inevitably to the accumulation of errors. The IEEE802.11b wireless Ethernet standard has been deployed in office building, museums, hospitals, shopping centers and other indoor environments. Many mobile robots already make use of wireless networking for communication. So location sensing with wireless Ethernet might be very useful for a low-cost robot. This research used wireless Ethernet card for compensation the accumulation of errors. So the mobile robot can use that for global localization through the installed many IEEE802.11b wireless Ethernets in indoor environments. The chief difficulty in localization with wireless Ethernet is predicting signal strength. As a sensor, RF signal strength measured indoors is non-linear with distance. So, there made the profiles of signal strength for points and used that. We wrote using function between signal strength profile and distance from the wireless Ethernet point.\n\nA New Event Builder for CMS Run II\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAlbertsson, K.; Andre, J.-M.; Andronidis, A.; Behrens, U.; Branson, J.; Chaze, O.; Cittolin, S.; Darlea, G.-L.; Deldicque, C.; Dobson, M.; Dupont, A.; Erhan, S.; Gigi, D.; Glege, F.; Gomez-Ceballos, G.; Hegeman, J.; Holzner, A.; Jimenez-EstupiÃ±Ã¡n, R.; Masetti, L.; Meijers, F.; Meschi, E.; Mommsen, R.

However, since EPON is an optical shared medium network, some unique features make it more vulnerable to security attacks. In this paper, the key security threats of EPON are firstly analyzed. And then, considering some specific properties which might be utilized for security, such as the safety of transmissions in upstream direction, some novel methods are presented to solve security problems. Firstly, based on some modification about registration, the mechanism of access control is achieved. Secondly, we implement an AES-128 symmetrical encryption and decryption in the EPON system. The AES-128 algorithm can process data blocks of 128 bits, but the length of Ethernet frame is variable. How to deal with the last block, which is not up to 128 bits, is discussed in detail. Finally, key update is accomplished through a vendor specific OAM frame in order to enhance the level of security. The proposed mechanism will remain in conformance with P2MP specification defined by 802.3ah TF, and can supply a complete security solution for EPON.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAndre, J.M.; et al.\n\nThe data acquisition system (DAQ) of the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider assembles events at a rate of 100 kHz, transporting event data at an aggregate throughput of to the high-level trigger farm.

The Ethernet interface allows for a more distributed payload architecture. Connections can be placed in locations not serviced by the PEP 1553 bus. The Ethernet interface provides a new access port into the PEP so as to use the already existing services. Initial capability will include a subset of services with a plan to expand services later.\n\nSafety management of Ethernet broadband access based on VLAN aggregation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Li\n\n2004-04-01\n\nWith broadband access network development, the Ethernet technology is more and more applied access network now. It is different from the private network -LAN. The differences lie in four points: customer management, safety management, service management and count-fee management. This paper mainly discusses the safety management related questions. Safety management means that the access network must secure the customer data safety, isolate the broad message which brings the customer private information, such as ARP, DHCP, and protect key equipment from attack. Virtue LAN (VLAN) technology can restrict network broadcast flow. We can config each customer port with a VLAN, so each customer is isolated with others. The IP address bound with VLAN ID can be routed rightly. But this technology brings another question: IP address shortage. VLAN aggregation technology can solve this problem well. Such a mechanism provides several advantages over traditional IPv4 addressing architectures employed in large switched LANs today. With VLAN aggregation technology, we introduce the notion of sub-VLANs and super-VLANs, a much more optimal approach to IP addressing can be realized. This paper will expatiate the VLAN aggregation model and its implementation in Ethernet access network. It is obvious that the customers in different sub-VLANs can not communication to each other because the ARP packet is isolated. Proxy ARP can enable the communication among them. This paper will also expatiate the proxy ARP model and its implementation in Ethernet access network.\n\nRadiated emissions comparison of seven-stage modal filter constructions for Ethernet 100Base-T network protection\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKhazhibekov, R.

The serial data is converted to 10-bit parallel data at a 125 MHz rate on a clock recovered from the serial data stream. This recovered data needs to be processed by a system clock that is also running at a nominal rate of 125 MHz, but not synchronous to the recovered clock. To cross clock domains, an asynchronous FIFO (first-in-first-out) is used, with the write pointer (wprt) in the recovered clock domain and the read pointer (rptr) in the system clock domain. Because the clocks are generated from separate sources, there is potential for FIFO overflow or underflow. Clock compensation in Gigabit Ethernet is possible by taking advantage of the protocol data stream features. There are two distinct data streams that occur in Gigabit Ethernet where identical data is transmitted for a period of time. The first is configuration, which happens during auto-negotiation. The second is idle, which occurs at the end of auto-negotiation and between every packet. The identical data in the FIFO can be repeated by decrementing the read pointer, thus compensating for a FIFO that is draining too fast. The identical data in the FIFO can also be skipped by incrementing the read pointer, which compensates for a FIFO draining too slowly. The unique and novel features of this FIFO are that it works in both the idle stream and the configuration streams. The increment or decrement of the read pointer is different in the idle and compensation streams to preserve disparity. Another unique feature is that the read pointer to write pointer difference range changes between compensation and idle to minimize FIFO latency during packet transmission.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBauer, Gerry; et al.\n\nThe DAQ system of the CMS experiment at CERN collects data from more than 600 custom detector Front-End Drivers (FEDs). During 2013 and 2014 the CMS DAQ system will undergo a major upgrade to address the obsolescence of current hardware and the requirements posed by the upgrade of the LHC accelerator and various detector components. For a loss-less data collection from the FEDs a new FPGA based card implementing the TCP/IP protocol suite over 10Gbps Ethernet has been developed. To limit the TCP hardware implementation complexity the DAQ group developed a simplified and unidirectional but RFC 793 compliant version ofmoreÂ Â» the TCP protocol. This allows to use a PC with the standard Linux TCP/IP stack as a receiver. We present the challenges and protocol modifications made to TCP in order to simplify its FPGA implementation. We also describe the interaction between the simplified TCP and Linux TCP/IP stack including the performance measurements.Â«Â less\n\nReadout and DAQ for Pixel Detectors\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPlatkevic, Michal\n\n2010-01-01\n\nData readout and acquisition control of pixel detectors demand the transfer of significantly a large amounts of bits between the detector and the computer.

Within this framework, INAF is currently developing an end-to-end prototype of a Small Size dual-mirror Telescope. In a second phase the ASTRI project foresees the installation of the first elements of the array at CTA southern site, a mini-array of 7 telescopes. The ASTRI Camera DAQ Software is aimed at the Camera data acquisition, storage and display during Camera development as well as during commissioning and operations on the ASTRI SST-2M telescope prototype that will operate at the INAF observing station located at Serra La Nave on the Mount Etna (Sicily). The Camera DAQ configuration and operations will be sequenced either through local operator commands or through remote commands received from the Instrument Controller System that commands and controls the Camera. The Camera DAQ software will acquire data packets through a direct one-way socket connection with the Camera Back End Electronics. In near real time, the data will be stored in both raw and FITS format. The DAQ Quick Look component will allow the operator to display in near real time the Camera data packets.
