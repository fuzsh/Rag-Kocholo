INTRODUCTION Purchasing Power Purchasing power is the amount of goods and services that can be purchased with a unit of currency. In simple words, purchasing power refers to the value of an individual unit of currency and what someone can buy with it. A decrease in purchasing power is called inflation. Inflation decreases a currency's purchasing power as the price of goods and services goes up. Understanding purchasing power Purchasing power affects every aspect of economics, from consumers buying goods to investors and stock prices to a country’s economic prosperity. When a currency’s purchasing power decreases due to excessive inflation, serious negative economic consequences arise, including rising costs of goods and services contributing to a high cost of living, as well as high interest rates that affect the global market, and falling credit ratings as a result. All of these factors can contribute to an economic crisis. For Example- As an example of purchasing power gain, if laptop computers cost $1,000 two years ago and today they cost $500, consumers have seen their purchasing power rise. In the absence of inflation, $1,000 will now buy a laptop plus an additional $500 worth of goods. Measurement of purchasing power Measuring purchasing power by country is done through purchasing power parity which provides a way to calculate the affordability of goods and services accounting for all other exchange factors.\n\n5. PURCHASING POWER PARITY (PPP) Overview Purchasing Power Parity(PPP) is the measurement of prices in different countries that uses the prices of specific goods to compare the absolute purchasing power of the countries' currencies. Thus, it can said that Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a theory that compares the purchasing powers of currencies from different countries around the world. PPP can be used to determine how much more or less expensive it can be to live in another country. Origin of Purchasing Power Parity The concept originated in the 16th century and was developed by Swedish economist Gustav Cassel in 1918. The concept is based on the “law of one price,” which states that similar goods will cost the same in different markets when the prices are expressed in the same currency (assuming the absence of transaction costs or trade barriers). Concept Purchasing power parity is an economic term for measuring prices at different locations. It is based on the law of one price which says that, if there are no transaction costs nor trade barriers for a particular good, then the price for that good should be the same at every location. Poverty, tariffs, transportation and other frictions prevent trading and purchasing of various goods, so measuring a single good can cause a large error. The PPP term accounts for this by using a basket of goods, that is, many goods with different quantities. PPP then computes an\n\n6. inflation and exchange rate as the ratio of the price of the basket in one location to the price of the basket in the other location. For example, if a basket consisting of 1 computer, 1 ton of rice, and 1 ton of steel was 1,800 US dollars in New York and the same goods cost 10,800 HK dollars in Hong Kong, the PPP exchange rate would be 6 HK dollars for every 1 US dollar. The name purchasing power parity comes from the idea that, with the right exchange rate, consumers in every location will have the same purchasing power. The value of the PPP exchange rate is very dependent on the basket of goods chosen. In general, goods are chosen that might closely obey the law of one price. So, ones traded easily and are commonly available in both locations. Organizations that compute PPP exchange rates use different baskets of goods and can come up with different values. How to calculate purchasing power parity? As buying power parity is based on the law of one price. As a result, after adjusting for the exchange rate, the price in the partner nation must be equivalent to the domestic price for a bundle of goods. We may compute it mathematically using the following formula: Pd = Sd/f x Pf Where:  Pd = domestic price  Pf = price abroad  Sd/f = PPP exchange rate, domestic currency against foreign currencies\n\n7. Take a product package in Indonesia and the United States, for example. The pricing for both should be similar when adjusted to the PPP exchange rate. Assume you're a native of Indonesia. Assume the price in the United States is $1 and the rupiah exchange rate against the dollar is IDR14,000/USD. As a result, the pricing in Indonesia for this product should be IDR14,000 (USD1 x IDR14,000/USD). Types of purchasing power parity 1. Absolute parity Absolute purchasing power parity (APPP) states that once two currencies are exchanged, a basket of commodities should have the same value. The hypothesis is usually based on the conversion of other international currencies into US dollars. For example- If a can of Coca-Cola costs $1.50 in the United States, APPP suggests that a can of Coca-Cola in any other nation should cost $1.50 after conversion to the local currency. 2. Relative parity Relative purchasing power parity (RPPP) is an extension of APPP that may be used in conjunction with the first. RPPP argues that there is a link between price inflation and currency exchange rates despite the fact that it maintains that the value of the same items in various nations should equalise over time. For example- If the UK had an annual inflation rate of 2%, then one unit of pound sterling would be able to purchase 2% less per year.\n\n8. Advantages of using purchasing power parity Some of the advantages of using PPP to compare the economies of different countries include the following things. 1. PPP exchange rates are stable compared with the market. PPP exchange rates stay relatively stable when compared with financial world market rates. Comparing GDP using market rates can mean more volatility in comparisons, even when the individual countries' markets are stable. 2. It accounts for non-traded goods. GDP measures a country’s economic productivity as it relates to the sale of tangible, internationally traded goods. However, PPP accounts for the cost of non-traded goods and services—like haircuts or massages—which also speaks to the productivity of a given economy. 3. It provides real-world examples of living costs and standards. Every year, The Economist releases a comparative list of what 55 countries around the world charge for a McDonald’s Big Mac called the Big Mac Index. This example of PPP uses a recognizable good as a point of comparison between the living costs around the world, which is similar to the research of the ICP. Laypeople can look at the PPP of different goods in different places, and get a sense of how expensive or affordable their current home economy is. LAW OF ONE PRICE What Is the Law of One Price? The law of one price is an economic concept that states that the price of an identical asset or commodity will have the same price globally, regardless of location, when certain factors are considered. Purchasing power parity is just a fancy way of saying that buyers have equal\n\n9. The law of one price takes into account a frictionless market, where there are no transaction costs, transportation costs, or legal restrictions, the currency exchange rates are the same, and that there is no price manipulation by buyers or sellers. The law of one price exists because differences between asset prices in different locations would eventually be eliminated due to the arbitrage opportunity. The arbitrage opportunity would be achieved whereby a trader would purchase the asset in the market it is available at a lower price and then sell it in the market where it is available at a higher price. Over time, market equilibrium forces would align the prices of the asset. Definition of the Law of One Price The concept behind the law of one price is pretty simple. Basically, an asset, security or commodity will have one price across markets, even when taking into consideration the exchange rates. This is because if an asset is cheaper in one market, investors will swoop in and buy that asset. Then, those investors will flip the asset, selling it to the more expensive market and ultimately netting a profit. This is called market arbitrage. However, this type of buying power simply can’t last forever. As more investors try to take advantage of the lower priced market, the supply and demand will shift until prices level out across markets. Of course, transportation costs, taxes and tariffs affect prices in different markets. This may result in a variance in the actual price consumers pay. For example, gas and groceries are more expensive on islands, because they must be transported to the island. Still, the base price of these items before shipping should be nearly identical under the law of one price. Example of the Law of One Price Say Market A is selling widgets for $100, while Market B is selling them for just $10. It stands to reason that investors would buy up\n\n10. Market B’s widgets and sell them for a profit to buyers in Market A, who are willing to pay a higher price. Obviously, this can’t go on forever. As more investors sell into Market A, competition will ensue, and prices will be driven down. Eventually, the law of one price dictates that these prices will balance out across markets. Ultimately, this keeps markets more fair, balanced and efficient. Violations of the Law of One Price In the real world, the assumptions built into the law of one price frequently do not hold, and persistent differentials in prices for many kinds of goods and assets can be readily observed. Transportation Costs When dealing in commodities, or any physical good, the cost to transport them must be included, resulting in different prices when commodities from two different locations are examined. If the difference in transportation costs does not account for the difference in commodity prices between regions, it can be a sign of a shortage or excess within a particular region. This applies to any good that must be physically transported from one geographic location to another rather than just transferred in title from one owner to another. It also applies to wages for any employment where the worker must be physically present at the worksite to perform the job. Transaction Costs Because transaction costs exist and can vary across different markets and geographic regions, prices for the same good can also vary between markets. Where transaction costs, such as the costs to find an appropriate trading counterparty or costs to negotiate and enforce a contract, are higher, the price for a good will tend to be higher there than in other markets with lower transaction costs.\n\n11. Legal Restrictions Legal barriers to trade, such as tariffs, capital controls, or in the case of wages, immigration restrictions, can lead to persistent price differentials rather than one price. These will have a similar effect to transportation and transaction costs, and might even be thought of as a type of transaction cost. For example, if a country imposes a tariff on the importation of rubber, then domestic rubber prices will tend to be higher than the world price. Market Structure Because the number of buyers and sellers (and the ability of buyers and sellers to enter the market) can vary between markets, market concentration and ability of buyers and sellers to set prices can vary as well. A seller who enjoys a high degree of market power due to natural economies of scale in a given market might act like a monopoly price setter and charge a higher price. This can lead to different prices for the same good in different markets even for otherwise easily transportable goods. Purchasing Power Parity Theory Purchasing power parity theory is simply the end result of the law of one price. When the law of one price works the way it should, buyers will have the same purchasing power across markets, regardless of the currency or exchange rate. In practice, consumers across markets do not exactly have absolute purchasing power parity. There are many reasons for this, but they mostly boil down to access. Not every consumer has access to cheap goods, or to international goods. Some buyers are limited in their access to goods and services, and this makes purchasing power parity very difficult to achieve in the real world.\n\n12. THE PPP HYPOTHESIS The law of one price (LOP) Pi = SP* i Where Pi and P*i are the prices of good i in the home and foreign economy, respectively, and S is the nominal exchange rate (domestic currency price of foreign currency). Absolute purchasing power parity (PPP) prevails if the same basket of goods costs the same when prices are converted to a common currency. That is, when P = SP where P and P are the local currency prices of the basket in the home and foreign country, respectively. Relative PPP prevails if the ratio of two broadly defined price indices stays constant when corrected for changes in the exchange rate, i.e., if the real exchange rate R = SP=P is constant. Note:  If the law of one price holds for every commodity then absolute PPP holds. However, the law of one price is not necessary for absolute PPP (the basket of goods may cost the same even if the prices of individual goods differ).  Absolute PPP implies relative PPP if the same basket of goods is used in the comparisons.  The law of one price is neither necessary nor sufficient for relative PPP since the weights in the relative price indices may differ."
