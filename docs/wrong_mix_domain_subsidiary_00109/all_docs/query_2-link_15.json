        "text": "ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes, 1995\n\nAs systems become more complex, the high-level organization of the overall system---the software architecture---becomes a critical aspect of design. Architectural concerns include organization of a system as a composition of components; global control structures; protocols for communication, synchronization, and data access; assignment of functionality to design elements; physical distribution; scaling and performance; dimensions of evolution; and selection among design alternatives.Recently, software architecture has begun to emerge as an important field of study for software engineering practitioners and researchers. Architectural issues are being addressed by work in areas such as module interface languages, domain-specific architectures, software reuse, codification of organizational patterns for software, architectural description languages, formal underpinnings for architectural design, and architectural design environments.While there has been considerable recent activity in ...\n\nDownload\n\nACM SIGMOD Record, 2009\n\nSoftware Architecture, defined as the formal study of the structures and patterns of complex software systems, is already in its second decade as a regular discipline within Software Engineering. Not so long ago, architectures were simply left implicit. Today this would not be possible anymore; software applications cannot be conceived as isolated monoliths. Almost any software piece is now part of another system, and these systems have become themselves distributed, more complex, and larger.\n\nDownload"
