Gethyn; Morgan, Jeffrey S.; Slater, David C.; Kasle, David B.; Bybee, Richard L.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThird-generation, 224 x 960 and 360 x 1024-pixel multianode microchannel (MAMA) detectors are under development for satellite-borne FUV and EUV observations, using pixel dimensions of 25 x 25 microns. An account is presently given of the configurations, modes of operation, and recent performance data of these systems. At UV and visible wavelengths, these MAMAs employ a semitransparent, proximity-focused photocathode structure. At FUV and EUV wavelengths below about 1500 A, opaque alkali-halide photocathodes deposited directly on the front surface of the MCP furnish the best detective quantum efficiencies.\n\nDevelopment of the MAMA Detectors for the Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTimothy, J. Gethyn\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThe development of the Multi-Anode Microchannel Array (MAMA) detector systems started in the early 1970's in order to produce multi-element detector arrays for use in spectrographs for solar studies from the Skylab-B mission. Development of the MAMA detectors for spectrographs on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) began in the late 1970's, and reached its culmination with the successful installation of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on the second HST servicing mission (STS-82 launched 11 February 1997). Under NASA Contract NAS5-29389 from December 1986 through June 1994 we supported the development of the MAMA detectors for STIS, including complementary sounding rocket and ground-based research programs. This final report describes the results of the MAMA detector development program for STIS.\n\nSpeckle imaging with the MAMA detector: Preliminary results\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHorch, E.; Heanue, J. F.; Morgan, J. S.; Timothy, J. G.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nWe report on the first successful speckle imaging studies using the Stanford University speckle interferometry system, an instrument that uses a multianode microchannel array (MAMA) detector as the imaging device. The method of producing high-resolution images is based on the analysis of so-called 'near-axis' bispectral subplanes and follows the work of Lohmann et al. (1983). In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the bispectrum, the frame-oversampling technique of Nakajima et al. (1989) is also employed. We present speckle imaging results of binary stars and other objects from V magnitude 5.5 to 11, and the quality of these images is studied. While the Stanford system is capable of good speckle imaging results, it is limited by the overall quantum efficiency of the current MAMA detector (which is due to the response of the photocathode at visible wavelengths and other detector properties) and by channel saturation of the microchannel plate. Both affect the signal-to-noise ratio of the power spectrum and bispectrum.\n\nA new-speckle interferometry system for the MAMA detector\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHorch, E.; Morgan, J. S.; Giaretta, G.; Kasle, D. B.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nWe have developed a new system for making speckle observations with the multianode microchannel array (MAMA) detector. This system is a true photon-counting imaging device which records the arrival time of every detected photon and allows for reconstruction of image features near the diffraction limit of the telescope. We present a description of the system and summary of observational results obtained at the Lick Observatory 1-m reflector in 1991 September. The diffraction limit of the 1-m telescope at 5029 A is about 0.125 arcsec and we have successfully resolved the catalogued interferometric binary HD 202582 with a separation of 0.157 +/- 0.031 arcsec. A pair of stars in the open cluster Chi Persei separated by 2.65 +/- 0.22 arcsec with approximate V magnitudes 8.6 and 11.5 has also been successfully analyzed with the speckle technique.\n\nTIME-TAG mode of STIS observations using the MAMA detectors\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSahu, Kailash; Danks, Anthony; Baum, Stefi; Balzano, Vicki; Kraemer, Steve; Kutina, Ray; Sears, William\n\n1995-04-01\n\nWe summarize the time-tag mode of STIS observations using the MAMA detectors, both in imaging and spectroscopic modes. After a brief outline on the MAMA detector characteristics and the astronomical applications of the time-tag mode, the general philosophy and the details of the data management strategy are described in detail. The GO specifications, and the consequent different modes of data transfer strategy are outlined. Restrictions on maximum data rates, integration times, and BUFFER-TIME requirements are explained. A few cases where the subarray option would be useful are outlined.\n\nDynamic range considerations for EUV MAMA detectors. [Extreme UV Multianode Microchannel Array\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nIlling, Rainer M. E.; Bybee, Richard L.; Timothy, J. G.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nThe multianode microchannel array (MAMA) has been chosen as the detector for two instruments on the ESA/NASA Solar Heliospheric Observatory. The response of the MAMA to the two extreme types of solar spectra, disk and corona, have been modeled with a view toward evaluating dynamic range effects present. The method of MAMA operation is discussed, with emphasis given to modeling the effect of electron cloud charge spreading to several detector anodes and amplifiers (n-fold events). Representative synthetic EUV spectra have been created. The detector response to these spectra is modeled by dissecting the input photon radiation field across the detector array into contributions to the various amplifier channels. The results of this dissection are shown for spectral regions across the entire wavelength region of interest. These results are used to identify regions in which total array photon counting rate or individual amplifier rate may exceed the design limits. This allows the design or operational modes to be tailored to eliminate the problem areas.\n\nThe STIS MAMA status: Current detector performance\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDanks, A. C.; Joseph, C.; Bybee, R.; Argebright, V.; Abraham, J.; Kimble, R.; Woodgate, B.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe STIS (Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph) is a second generation Hubble instrument scheduled to fly in 1997. Through a variety of modes, the instrument will provide spectral resolutions from R approximately 50 in the objective spectroscopy mode to 100,000 in the high resolution echelle mode in the wavelength region from 115 to 1000 nm. In the UV the instrument employs two MAMA (Multimode Anode Microchannel plate Arrays) 1024 by 1024 pixel detectors, which provide high DQE (Detective Quantum Efficiency), and good dynamic range and resolution. The current progress and performance of these detectors are reported, illustrating that the technology is mature and that the performance is very close to flight requirements.\n\nNew Geometric-distortion Solution for STIS FUV-MAMA\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSohn, S. Tony\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWe derived a new geometric distortion solution for the STIS FUV-MAMA detector. To do this, positions of stars in 89 FUV-MAMA observations of NGC 6681 were compared to an astrometric standard catalog created using WFC3/UVIS imaging data to derive a fourth-order polynomial solution that transforms raw (x, y) positions to geometrically- corrected (x, y) positions. When compared to astrometric catalog positions, the FUV- MAMA position measurements based on the IDCTAB showed residuals with an RMS of Ã¢ÂÂ¼ 30 mas in each coordinate. Using the new IDCTAB, the RMS is reduced to Ã¢ÂÂ¼ 4 mas, or 0.16 FUV-MAMA pixels, in each coordinate. The updated IDCTAB is now being used in the HST STIS pipeline to process all STIS FUV-MAMA images.\n\nFar-ultraviolet MAMA detector imagery and emission-line CCD imagery of NGC 6240\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSmith, Andrew M.; Hill, Robert S.; Vrba, Frederick J.; Timothy, J. G.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nAn image of the luminous infrared galaxy NGC 6240 at 1480 A was obtained using a multianode microchannel array (MAMA) detector with a rocket-borne telescope. At distances greater than 12 arcsec from the nucleus, the measured ultraviolet luminosity implies intensive star formation activity equal to 2-3 times that of a spiral galaxy such as M83. Optical images in the H-beta and forbidden O III 5007 A emission lines reveal a region of high excitation east of the nucleus between the centers of disks 1 and 2 as described by Bland-Hawthorn et al.\n\nHigh-resolution pulse-counting array detectors for imaging and spectroscopy at ultraviolet wavelengths\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTimothy, J. Gethyn; Bybee, Richard L.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nThe performance characteristics of multianode microchannel array (MAMA) detector systems which have formats as large as 256 x 1024 pixels and which have application to imaging and spectroscopy at UV wavelengths are evaluated. Sealed and open-structure MAMA detector tubes with opaque CsI photocathodes can determine the arrival time of the detected photon to an accuracy of 100 ns or better. Very large format MAMA detectors with CsI and Cs2Te photocathodes and active areas of 52 x 52 mm (2048 x 2048 pixels) will be used as the UV solar blind detectors for the NASA STIS.\n\nAn Introduction to MAMA (Meta-Analysis of MicroArray data) System.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Zhe; Fenstermacher, David\n\n2005-01-01\n\nAnalyzing microarray data across multiple experiments has been proven advantageous. To support this kind of analysis, we are developing a software system called MAMA (Meta-Analysis of MicroArray data). MAMA utilizes a client-server architecture with a relational database on the server-side for the storage of microarray datasets collected from various resources. The client-side is an application running on the end user's computer that allows the user to manipulate microarray data and analytical results locally. MAMA implementation will integrate several analytical methods, including meta-analysis within an open-source framework offering other developers the flexibility to plug in additional statistical algorithms.\n\nMusic Activities for \"Mama\", \"Mama\" and \"Papa\", \"Papa\"\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nCardany, Audrey Berger\n\n2011-01-01\n\nJean Marzollo creates two beautiful texts using a child's first words, \"Mama, Mama\" and \"Papa, Papa\" as a recurring theme. Wildlife artist, Laura Regan, illustrates Marzollo's poetry with loving images of parents and children in the animal kingdom.

G.; Bybee, R. L.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nThe Multi-Anode Microchannel Arrays (MAMAs) are a family of photoelectric, photoncounting array detectors that have been developed and qualified specifically for use in space. MAMA detectors with formats as large as 256 x 1024 pixels are now in use or under construction for a variety of imaging and tracking applications. These photo-emissive detectors can be operated in a windowless configuration at extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray wavelengths or in a sealed configuration at ultraviolet and visible wavelengths. The construction and modes-of-operation of the MAMA detectors are briefly described and the scientific objectives of a number of sounding rocket and Space Shuttle instruments utilizing these detectors are outlined. Performance characteristics of the MAMA detectors that are of fundamental importance for operation in the Space Shuttle environment are described and compared with those of the photo-conductive array detectors such as the CCDs and CIDs.\n\nPhoton-counting array detectors for space and ground-based studies at ultraviolet and vacuum ultraviolet /VUV/ wavelengths\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTimothy, J. G.; Bybee, R. L.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nThe Multi-Anode Microchannel Arrays (MAMAs) are a family of photoelectric photon-counting array detectors, with formats as large as (256 x 1024)-pixels that can be operated in a windowless configuration at vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) and soft X-ray wavelengths or in a sealed configuration at ultraviolet and visible wavelengths. This paper describes the construction and modes of operation of (1 x 1024)-pixel and (24 x 1024)-pixel MAMA detector systems that are being built and qualified for use in sounding-rocket spectrometers for solar and stellar observations at wavelengths below 1300 A. The performance characteristics of the MAMA detectors at ultraviolet and VUV wavelengths are also described.\n\nLaboratory test data on the stability of the STIS MAMAs\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJoseph, Charles L.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nSTIS has two MAMA detectors systems with distinctly different tube configurations. The first (designated BAND 1) has an opaque CsI photocathode deposited on the microchannel plate (MCP) providing wavelength coverage from 1150A to 1700A. The other MAMA (designated BAND 2) has a semitransparent CS2Te photocathode deposited on the faceplate in close proximity to the input of the MCP. It covers the 1650A to 3100A bandpass and serves as a backup for the short wavelength detector. Laboratory test data indicate that both of these detectors have good sensitivity, have good uniformity and provide stable response, making each capable of collecting data with a signal-to-noise ratio in excess of 100 per Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) optical resolution element. Over a multiyear development effort, a substantial body of laboratory test data (more than 6 GBytes spanning more than 6 years of collection) has accumulated on more than a dozen fabricated tubes. These tests even included a few destructive evaluations to examine the limitations and operating life. In addition, analyses where conducted regarding impact caused by the specified electronic tolerances and expected changes in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) thermal environment. Perhaps the simplest test of stability is to collect a sequence of images, each with a uniform illumination, and use these individual \"flat fields\" to remove the pixel-to-pixel sensitivity in the other flat fields. These sequences typically spanned 3-5 weeks of time. The detectors are very stable, allowing the pixel-to-pixel sensitivity to be removed with good precision. The STIS specification for stability is 1% (sufficient for data with a S/N = 100) over a 1 week period and 2% over 30 days. All Engineering Model Units as well as Flight Detectors tested exceeded this specification.\n\nMAMA User Guide v2.0.1\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGaschen, Brian Keith; Bloch, Jeffrey Joseph; Porter, Reid\n\nMorphological signatures of bulk SNM materials have significant promise, but these potential signatures are not fully utilized. This document describes software tools, collectively called the MAMA (Morphological Analysis for Material Attribution) software that can help provide robust and accurate quantification of morphological features in bulk material microscopy images (Optical, SEM). Although many of the specific tools are not unique to Mama, the software package has been designed specifically for nuclear material morphological analysis, and is at a point where it can be easily adapted (by Los Alamos or by collaborators) in response to new, different, or changing forensics needs. ThemoreÂ Â» current release of the MAMA software only includes the image quantification, descriptions, and annotation functionality. Only limited information on a sample, its pedigree, and its chemistry are recorded inside this part of the software. This was decision based on initial feedback and the fact that there are several analytical chemistry databases being developed within the community. Currently MAMA is a standalone program that can export quantification results in a basic text format that can be imported into other programs such as Excel and Access. There is also a basic report generating feature that produces HTML formatted pages of the same information. We will be working with collaborators to provide better integration of MAMA into their particular systems, databases and workflows.Â«Â less\n\nWalkThrough Example Procedures for MAMA\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRuggiero, Christy E.; Gaschen, Brian Keith; Bloch, Jeffrey Joseph\n\nThis documentation is a growing set of walk through examples of analyses using the MAMA V2.0 software. It does not cover all the features or possibilities with the MAMA software, but will address using many of the basic analysis tools to quantify particle size and shape in an image. This document will continue to evolve as additional procedures and examples are added. The starting assumption is that the MAMA software has been successfully installed.\n\nCharacterization of Morphology using MAMA Software\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGravelle, Julie\n\nThe MAMA (Morphological Analysis for Material Attribution) software was developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory funded through the National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center in the Department of Homeland Security. The software allows images to be analysed and quantified. The largest project I worked on was to quantify images of plutonium oxides and ammonium diuranates prepared by the group with the software and provide analyses on the particles of each sample. Images were quantified through MAMA, with a color analysis, a lexicon description and powder x-ray diffraction. Through this we were able to visually see a difference between some ofmoreÂ Â» the syntheses. An additional project was to revise the manual for MAMA to help streamline training and provide useful tips to users to more quickly become acclimated to using the software. The third project investigated expanding the scope of MAMA and finding a statistically relevant baseline for the particulates through the analysis of maps in the software and using known measurements to compare the error associated with the software. During this internship, I worked on several different projects dealing with the MAMA software. The revision of the usermanual for the MAMA software was the first project I was able to work and collaborate on. I first learned how to use the software by getting instruction from a skilled user at the laboratory, Dan Schwartz, and by using the existing user manual and examples. After becoming accustomed to the program, I started to go over the manual to correct and change items that were not as useful or descriptive as they could have been. I also added in tips that I learned as I explored the software. The updated manual was also worked on by several others who have been developing the program. The goal of these revisions was to ensure the most concise and simple directions to the software were available to future users. By incorporating tricks and shortcuts that I discovered and\n\nDetector arrays for photometric measurements at soft X-ray, ultraviolet and visible wavelengths\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTimothy, J. G.; Mount, G. H.; Bybee, R. L.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nThe construction and modes of operation of the Multi-Anode Microchannel Array (MAMA) detectors are described, and the designs of spectrometers utilizing them are outlined. MAMA consists of a curved microchannel array plate, an opaque photocathode (peak quantum efficiency of 19% at 1216 A), and a multi-anode (either discrete- or coincidence-anode) readout array. Designed for use in instruments on spaceborne telescopes, MAMA can be operated in a windowless configuration in extreme-ultraviolet and soft X-ray wavelengths, or in a sealed configuration at UV and visible wavelengths. Advantages of MAMA include low applied potential (less than 3.0 kV), high gain (greater than 10 to the 6th electrons/pulse), low sensitivity to high-energy charged particles, and immunity to external magnetic fields of less than 500 Gauss\n\nInfluence of formulation ratio of the plant components on the antimalarial properties of MAMA decoction.\n\nPubMed\n\nOdediran, Samuel Akintunde; Elujoba, Anthony Adebolu; Adebajo, Adeleke Clement\n\n2014-05-01\n\nMangifera indica, Alstonia boonei, Morinda lucida and Azadirachta indica (MAMA) decoction, commonly prepared and used in Nigeria from 1:1:1:1 ratio of Mangifera indica L. (Anacardiaceae), Alstonia boonei De Wild (Apocynaceae), Morinda lucida Benth (Rubiaceae), and Azadirachta indica A. Juss (Meliaceae) leaves, plus four new variants of this combination were subjected to three in vivo antimalarial test models using chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium berghei berghei to determine the most active under each of the test models. Using the original formulation, MAMA (1:1:1:1) which gave ED50 and ED90 of 101.54Â±2.95 and 227.18Â±2.95, respectively, as reference for comparison, MAMA-1 (1:2:2:2), with 79.58Â±1.30 and 170.98Â±1.30, gave significantly (p<0.05) higher survival at 85 and 340 mg/kg when 80 % of the mice survived for 15.6 and 17.8 days, respectively, while MAMA-2 (2:1:2:2), with 83.57Â±1.93 and 164.23Â±1.93, gave comparable survival except at 170 mg/kg with 60 % survivors for 12 days. MAMA-1 and MAMA-2 were the best curative formulations with MAMA-1 giving additional prophylactic activity. MAMA-3 (2:2:2:1) with 98.70Â±0.91 and 220.17Â±0.91, gave comparable (p>0.05) survival at 85 mg/kg with 60 % survival for 13.2 days and significantly higher survival at 42.5 mg/kg for 17 days with 40 % survival. Both MAMA and MAMA-3 were the best chemosuppressive formulations plus additional curative activities. MAMA-4 (1:1:2:2), the best prophylactic formulation with 94.87Â±2.43 and 201.20Â±2.43 gave significantly higher (p<0.05) survival at all doses except at 21.25 mg/kg which gave 60 % survival up to 10 days. Thus, the antimalarial therapy desired, following appropriate diagnosis, whether prophylactic, chemosuppressive or curative would determine which of the MAMA decoction formulations to be prescribed. This phenomenon of formulary optimization may also be applied to other pharmacological activities.\n\nMAMA- User Feedback and Training Summary\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPorter, Reid B.; Ruggiero, Christy E.\n\n2014-05-21\n\nThis document describes the current state of the MAMA (Morphological Analysis of Materials) software user identified bugs, issues, and requests for improvements. It also lists Current users and current training methods.\n\nMelt Analysis of Mismatch Amplification Mutation Assays (Melt-MAMA): A Functional Study of a Cost-Effective SNP Genotyping Assay in Bacterial Models\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBirdsell, Dawn N.; Pearson, Talima; Price, Erin P.; Hornstra, Heidie M.; Nera, Roxanne D.; Stone, Nathan; Gruendike, Jeffrey; Kaufman, Emily L.; Pettus, Amanda H.; Hurbon, Audriana N.; Buchhagen, Jordan L.; Harms, N. Jane; Chanturia, Gvantsa; Gyuranecz, Miklos; Wagner, David M.; Keim, Paul S.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are abundant in genomes of all species and biologically informative markers extensively used across broad scientific disciplines. Newly identified SNP markers are publicly available at an ever-increasing rate due to advancements in sequencing technologies. Efficient, cost-effective SNP genotyping methods to screen sample populations are in great demand in well-equipped laboratories, but also in developing world situations. Dual Probe TaqMan assays are robust but can be cost-prohibitive and require specialized equipment. The Mismatch Amplification Mutation Assay, coupled with melt analysis (Melt-MAMA), is flexible, efficient and cost-effective. However, Melt-MAMA traditionally suffers from high rates of assay design failures and knowledge gaps on assay robustness and sensitivity. In this study, we identified strategies that improved the success of Melt-MAMA. We examined the performance of 185 Melt-MAMAs across eight different pathogens using various optimization parameters. We evaluated the effects of genome size and %GC content on assay development. When used collectively, specific strategies markedly improved the rate of successful assays at the first design attempt from â¼50% to â¼80%. We observed that Melt-MAMA accurately genotypes across a broad DNA range (â¼100 ng to â¼0.1 pg). Genomic size and %GC content influence the rate of successful assay design in an independent manner. Finally, we demonstrated the versatility of these assays by the creation of a duplex Melt-MAMA real-time PCR (two SNPs) and conversion to a size-based genotyping system, which uses agarose gel electrophoresis. Melt-MAMA is comparable to Dual Probe TaqMan assays in terms of design success rate and accuracy. Although sensitivity is less robust than Dual Probe TaqMan assays, Melt-MAMA is superior in terms of cost-effectiveness, speed of development and versatility. We detail the parameters most important for the successful application of Melt-MAMA\n\nUncertainty in the use of MAMA software to measure particle morphological parameters from SEM images\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSchwartz, Daniel S.; Tandon, Lav\n\nThe MAMA software package developed at LANL is designed to make morphological measurements on a wide variety of digital images of objects. At LANL, we have focused on using MAMA to measure scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of particles, as this is a critical part of our forensic analysis of interdicted radiologic materials. In order to successfully use MAMA to make such measurements, we must understand the level of uncertainty involved in the process, so that we can rigorously support our quantitative conclusions.\n\nMulti-anode microchannel arrays. [for use in ground-based and spaceborne telescopes\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTimothy, J. G.; Mount, G. H.; Bybee, R. L.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nThe Multi-Anode Microchannel Arrays (MAMA's) are a family of photoelectric, photon-counting array detectors being developed for use in instruments on both ground-based and space-borne telescopes.

MAMA detectors can be operated in a windowless configuration at extreme-ultraviolet and soft X-ray wavelengths or in a sealed configuration at ultraviolet and visible wavelengths. Prototype MAMA detectors with up to 512 x 512 pixels are now being tested in the laboratory and telescope operation of a simple (10 x 10)-pixel visible-light detector has been initiated.

The detector system is designed to detect the presence of molecules or molecular species by inducing fluorescence with exciting radiation and detecting the emitted fluorescence. Because the system is capable of accurately detecting and measuring picomolar concentrations it is ideally suited for use with microchemical analysis systems generally and capillary chromatographic systems in particular. By employing a modular design, the detector system provides both the ability to replace various elements of the detector system without requiring extensive realignment or recalibration of the components as well as minimal user interaction with the system. In addition, the modular concept provides for the use and addition of a wide variety of components, including optical elements (lenses and filters), light sources, and detection means, to fit particular needs.\n\nMonolithic integrated circuit charge amplifier and comparator for MAMA readout\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCole, Edward H.; Smeins, Larry G.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nPrototype ICs for the Solar Heliospheric Observatory's Multi-Anode Microchannel Array (MAMA) have been developed; these ICs' charge-amplifier and comparator components were then tested with a view to pulse response and noise performance. All model performance predictions have been exceeded. Electrostatic discharge protection has been included on all IC connections; device operation over temperature has been consistent with model predictions.\n\nThe Zero-Degree Detector System\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAdams, James H.; Christl, Mark J.; Howell, Leonard W.; Kouznetsov, Evgueni\n\n2006-01-01\n\nWe will report on a detector system used for accelerator measurement of nuclear fragmentation cross sections. This system consists of two detector planes, each carrying a ring of 8 detectors. Each detector has 64 pads. These two detector planes are arranged facing each other so that the matching detector pads on each plane form a two element charged particle telescope. Each of these telescopes is capable of determining the elemental identity of nuclear fragments passing through it. The system is used to measure light fragment production in the presence of heavier fragments. We will present a detailed discussion of the 64-pad detector design, the substrate design. The front-end electronics used to read out the signals is based on a custom VLSI chip developed for the Advanced Thin Ionization Calorimeter experiment which has been flown successfully twice in Antarctica. Each of these chips has 16 channels and each channel consists of a charge-sensitive preamplifier followed by a shaping amplifier and a track-and-hold circuit. The track-and-hold circuits are connected via a multiplexer to an output line driver. This allows the held signals to be presented, one-by-one via a common data line to a analog-to-digital converter. Because the output line driver can be placed in a high input impedance state when not in use, it is possible to daisy-change many chips on the same common data line.

The high-voltage characteristic of the microchannel array plate, average dark count, gain, and resolution of pulse height distribution characteristics showed no degradation after this total dose. In fact, the degassing of the microchannels induced by the high radiation flux had the effect of cleaning up the array plate and improving its characteristics.\n\n14 CFR 121.273 - Fire-detector systems.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-01-01\n\n... 14 Aeronautics and Space 3 2010-01-01 2010-01-01 false Fire-detector systems. 121.273 Section 121.273 Aeronautics and Space FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (CONTINUED...-detector systems.

In Study 1, 48 young adults evaluated the positivity of culturally popular labels for gender nonconformity, including \"tomboy,\" \"sissy,\" and two new labels generated in a pilot study, \"mama's boy\" and \"brat.\" The \"mama's boy\" was described as a boy who has positive feminine traits (gentle and well-mannered) as opposed to the \"sissy\" who was described as having negative feminine traits (crying and easily frightened). In Study 2, 161 young adults read descriptions of gender-typical and nonconforming children, evaluating them in several domains. The label \"mama's boy\" was considered negative in Study 1 but an unlabeled positive nonconforming boy was rated as likable and competent in Study 2. However, participants worried about nonconforming boys, saying they would encourage them to behave differently and describing such children with derogatory sexual orientation slurs. \"Tomboy\" was generally considered a positive label in Study 1. In Study 2, gender nonconforming girls were considered neither likable nor dislikeable, and neither competent nor incompetent, reflecting ambivalence about girls' nonconformity. It may be that we use gender nonconformity labels as indicators of sexual orientation, even in young children. Therefore, even when an individual displays objectively positive traits, the stigma associated with homosexuality taints judgments about their nonconforming behavior.\n\nSeal system with integral detector\n\nDOEpatents\n\nFiarman, Sidney\n\n1985-01-01\n\nThere is disclosed a seal system for materials where security is of the essence, such as nuclear materials, which is tamper-indicating, which indicates changes in environmental conditions that evidence attempts to by-pass the seal, which is unique and cost effective, said seal system comprised of a seal where an optical signal is transmitted through a loop, with a detector to read said signal, and one or more additional detectors designed to detect environmental changes, these detectors being operatively associated with the seal so that detection of a break in the optical signal or detection of environmental changes will cause an observable change in the seal.\n\nSeal system with integral detector\n\nDOEpatents\n\nFiarman, S.\n\n1982-08-12\n\nA seal system is disclosed for materials where security is of the essence, such as nuclear materials.

(Inventor); Moerk, John S. (Inventor); Youngquist, Robert C. (Inventor)\n\n1996-01-01\n\nAn optical detector calibrator system simulates a source of optical radiation to which a detector to be calibrated is responsive. A light source selected to emit radiation in a range of wavelengths corresponding to the spectral signature of the source is disposed within a housing containing a microprocessor for controlling the light source and other system elements. An adjustable iris and a multiple aperture filter wheel are provided for controlling the intensity of radiation emitted from the housing by the light source to adjust the simulated distance between the light source and the detector to be calibrated. The geared iris has an aperture whose size is adjustable by means of a first stepper motor controlled by the microprocessor. The multiple aperture filter wheel contains neutral density filters of different attenuation levels which are selectively positioned in the path of the emitted radiation by a second stepper motor that is also controlled by the microprocessor. An operator can select a number of detector tests including range, maximum and minimum sensitivity, and basic functionality. During the range test, the geared iris and filter wheel are repeatedly adjusted by the microprocessor as necessary to simulate an incrementally increasing simulated source distance. A light source calibration subsystem is incorporated in the system which insures that the intensity of the light source is maintained at a constant level over time.\n\nMonoallelic mutation analysis (MAMA) for identifying germline mutations.\n\nPubMed\n\nPapadopoulos, N; Leach, F S; Kinzler, K W; Vogelstein, B\n\n1995-09-01\n\nDissection of germline mutations in a sensitive and specific manner presents a continuing challenge. In dominantly inherited diseases, mutations occur in only one allele and are often masked by the normal allele. Here we report the development of a sensitive and specific diagnostic strategy based on somatic cell hybridization termed MAMA (monoallelic mutation analysis). We have demonstrated the utility of this strategy in two different hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes, one caused by a defective tumour suppressor gene on chromosome 5 (familial adenomatous polyposis, FAP) and the other caused by a defective mismatch repair gene on chromosome 2 (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, HNPCC).\n\nMonooxorhenium(V) complexes with 222-N2S2 MAMA ligands for bifunctional chelator agents: Syntheses and preliminary in vivo evaluation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDemoin, Dustin Wayne; Dame, Ashley N.; Minard, William D.; Gallazzi, Fabio; Seickman, Gary L.; Rold, Tammy L.; Bernskoetter, Nicole; Fassbender, Michael E.; Hoffman, Timothy J.; Deakyne, Carol A.; Jurisson, Silvia S.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIntroduction Targeted radiotherapy using the bifunctional chelate approach with 186/188Re(V) is challenging because of the susceptibility of monooxorhenium(V)-based complexes to oxidize in vivo at high dilution. A monoamine-monoamide dithiol (MAMA)-based bifunctional chelating agent was evaluated with both rhenium and technetium to determine its utility for in vivo applications. Methods A 222-MAMA chelator, 222-MAMA(N-6-Ahx-OEt) bifunctional chelator, and 222- MAMA(N-6-Ahx-BBN(7-14)NH2) were synthesized, complexed with rhenium, radiolabeled with 99mTc and 186Re (carrier added and no carrier added), and evaluated in initial biological distribution studies. Results An IC50 value of 2.0 Â± 0.7 nM for natReO-222-MAMA(N-6-Ahx-BBN(7-14)NH2) compared to [125I]-Tyr4-BBN(NH2) was determined through competitive cell binding assays with PC-3 tumor cells. In vivo evaluation of the no-carrier added 99mTc-222-N2S2(N-6-Ahx-BBN(7-14)NH2) complex showed little gastric uptake and blockable pancreatic uptake in normal mice. Conclusions The 186ReO-222-N2S2(N-6-Ahx-BBN(7-14)NH2) complex showed stability in biological media, which indicates that the 222-N2S2 chelator is appropriate for chelating 186/188Re in radiopharmaceuticals involving peptides. Additionally, the in vitro cell studies showed that the ReO-222-N2S2(N-6-Ahx-BBN(7-14)NH2) complex (macroscopically) bound to PC3-tumor cell surface receptors with high affinity. The 99mTc analog was stable in vivo and exhibited pancreatic uptake in mice that was blockable, indicating BB2r targeting.

Fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin are the antibiotics of choice for treatment. An increase in the frequency of ciprofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter has been reported globally due to a single base mutation (C-257 to T) in codon 86 of the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) of the gyrA gene altering the amino acid sequence from threonine at position 86 to isoleucine (Thr-86 to Ile). Campylobacter spp (n = 118) were selected from a collection of Egyptian isolates spanning 1998 to 2005. The presence of C. jejuni gyrA gene was confirmed in each isolate by a PCR assay amplifying 368 bp portion of the gyrA gene. C to T alteration was detected by the mismatch amplification mutation assay MAMA PCR. The MIC of nalidixic acid (NA) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) was determined by E-test. C. jejuni gyrA gene was detected in 100 of the Campylobacter spp studied; the other 18 isolates were found to be Campylobacter coli by lpxA PCR. The mutation was detected in 89 C. jejuni resistant isolates with MIC values (NA; 8 - >256 Î¼g/ml) and (CIP; 4 - >32 Î¼g/ml). The other 11 sensitive C. jejuni isolates with MIC values (NA; 0.38 - 3 Âµg/ml) and (CIP; 0.03 - 0.125 Âµg/ml) were not amplified by the MAMA primers. There was 100% congruence with MAMA PCR, MIC results and gyrA gene sequence analysis. In Egypt the main mechanism for resistance to fluoroquinolones is an alteration in the gyrA QRDR. MAMA PCR provides an economical and rapid means for screening fluoroquinolone resistance.\n\nDetector Control System for the AFP detector in ATLAS experiment at CERN\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBanaÅ, E.; Caforio, D.; Czekierda, S.; Hajduk, Z.; Olszowska, J.; Seabra, L.; Å Ã­cho, P.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe ATLAS Forward Proton (AFP) detector consists of two forward detectors located at 205 m and 217 m on either side of the ATLAS experiment. The aim is to measure the momenta and angles of diffractively scattered protons. In 2016, two detector stations on one side of the ATLAS interaction point were installed and commissioned. The detector infrastructure and necessary services were installed and are supervised by the Detector Control System (DCS), which is responsible for the coherent and safe operation of the detector. A large variety of used equipment represents a considerable challenge for the AFP DCS design. Industrial Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) product Siemens WinCCOA, together with the CERN Joint Control Project (JCOP) framework and standard industrial and custom developed server applications and protocols are used for reading, processing, monitoring and archiving of the detector parameters. Graphical user interfaces allow for overall detector operation and visualization of the detector status. Parameters, important for the detector safety, are used for alert generation and interlock mechanisms.\n\nA Rapid Turnaround Cryogenic Detector Characterization System\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBenford, Dominic j.; Dipirro, Michael J.; Forgione, Joshua B.; Jackson, Clifton E.; Jackson, Michael L.; Kogut, Al; Moseley, S. Harvey; Shirron, Peter J.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nUpcoming major NASA missions such as the Einstein Inflation Probe and the Single Aperture Far-Infrared Observatory require arrays of detectors with thousands of elements, operating at temperatures near l00 mK and sensitive to wavelengths from approx. 100 microns to approx. 3 mm. Such detectors represent a substantial enabling technology for these missions, and must be demonstrated soon in order for them to proceed. In order to make rapid progress on detector development, the cryogenic testing cycle must be made convenient and quick. We have developed a cryogenic detector characterization system capable of testing superconducting detector arrays in formats up to 8 x 32, read out by SQUID multiplexers. The system relies on the cooling of a two-stage adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator immersed in a liquid helium bath. This approach permits a detector to be cooled from 300K to 50 mK in about 4 hours, so that a test cycle begun in the morning will be over by the end of the day. Tine system is modular, with two identical immersible units, so that while one unit is cooling, the second can be reconfigured for the next battery of tests. We describe the design, construction, and performance of this cryogenic detector testing facility.\n\nSynthesis and evaluation of a (99m)Tc-MAMA-propyl-thymidine complex as a potential probe for in vivo visualization of tumor cell proliferation with SPECT.\n\nPubMed\n\nCelen, Sofie; de Groot, Tjibbe; Balzarini, Jan; Vunckx, Kathleen; Terwinghe, Christelle; Vermaelen, Peter; Van Berckelaer, Lizette; Vanbilloen, Hubert; Nuyts, Johan; Mortelmans, Luc; Verbruggen, Alfons; Bormans, Guy\n\n2007-04-01\n\nCytosolic thymidine kinase (TK1) catalyzes phosphorylation of thymidine to its monophosphate. TK1 activity is closely related with DNA synthesis, and thymidine analogs derivatized with bulky carboranylalkyl groups at the N-3 position were reported to be good substrates for TK1. Accordingly, we have synthesized (99m)Tc-MAMA-propyl-thymidine and evaluated it as a potential tumor tracer. The bis(S-trityl)-protected MAMA-propyl-thymidine precursor (3-N-[S-trityl-2-mercaptoethyl]-N-[N'-(S-trityl-2-mercaptoethyl)amidoacetyl]-aminopropyl-thymidine) was prepared in three steps, and its structure was confirmed with (1)H NMR and mass spectrometry. Deprotection of the thiols and labeling with (99m)Tc were done in a two-step, one-pot procedure, yielding (99m)Tc-MAMA-propyl-thymidine, which was analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography, radio-LC-MS analysis (ESI+) and electrophoresis, and its log P was determined. The biodistribution in normal mice was evaluated, and its biodistribution in a radiation-induced fibrosarcoma (RIF) tumor mouse was compared with that of 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F] fluorothymidine [(18)F]FLT. (99m)Tc-MAMA-propyl-thymidine was obtained with a radiochemical yield of 70%. Electrophoresis indicated that the complex is uncharged, and its log P was 1.0. The molecular ion mass of the Tc complex was 589 Da, which is compatible with the hypothesized N(2)S(2)-oxotechnetium structure. Tissue distribution showed fast clearance from plasma primarily by the hepatobiliary pathway. Whole-body planar imaging after injection of (99m)Tc-MAMA-propyl-thymidine in an RIF tumor-bearing mouse showed high uptake in the liver and the intestines. No uptake was observed in the tumor, in contrast to the clear uptake observed for [(18)F] FLT visualized with muPET. Although it has been reported that TK1 accepts large substituents at the N-3 position of the thymine ring, the results of this study show that (99m)Tc-MAMA-propyl-thymidine cannot be used as a single photon emission\n\nCharacterizing X-ray detectors for prototype digital breast tomosynthesis systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKim, Y.-s.; Park, H.-s.; Park, S.-J.; Choi, S.; Lee, H.; Lee, D.; Choi, Y.-W.; Kim, H.-J.\n\n2016-03-01\n\nThe digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) system is a newly developed 3-D imaging technique that overcomes the tissue superposition problems of conventional mammography. Therefore, it produces fewer false positives. In DBT system, several parameters are involved in image acquisition, including geometric components. A series of projections should be acquired at low exposure. This makes the system strongly dependent on the detector's characteristic performance. This study compares two types of x-ray detectors developed by the Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute (KERI). The first prototype DBT system has a CsI (Tl) scintillator/CMOS based flat panel digital detector (2923 MAM, Dexela Ltd.), with a pixel size of 0.0748 mm. The second uses a-Se based direct conversion full field detector (AXS 2430, analogic) with a pixel size of 0.085 mm. The geometry of both systems is same, with a focal spot 665.8 mm from the detector, and a center of rotation 33 mm above the detector surface. The systems were compared with regard to modulation transfer function (MTF), normalized noise power spectrum (NNPS), detective quantum efficiency (DQE) and a new metric, the relative object detectability (ROD). The ROD quantifies the relative performance of each detector at detecting specified objects. The system response function demonstrated excellent linearity (R2>0.99). The CMOS-based detector had a high sensitivity, while the Anrad detector had a large dynamic range. The higher MTF and noise power spectrum (NPS) values were measured using an Anrad detector. The maximum DQE value of the Dexela detector was higher than that of the Anrad detector with a low exposure level, considering one projection exposure for tomosynthesis. Overall, the Dexela detector performed better than did the Anrad detector with regard to the simulated Al wires, spheres, test objects of ROD with low exposure level. In this study, we compared the newly developed prototype DBT system with two different types of x\n\nPredictive modeling of infrared detectors and material systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPinkie, Benjamin\n\nDetectors sensitive to thermal and reflected infrared radiation are widely used for night-vision, communications, thermography, and object tracking among other military, industrial, and commercial applications. System requirements for the next generation of ultra-high-performance infrared detectors call for increased functionality such as large formats (> 4K HD) with wide field-of-view, multispectral sensitivity, and on-chip processing. Due to the low yield of infrared material processing, the development of these next-generation technologies has become prohibitively costly and time consuming. In this work, it will be shown that physics-based numerical models can be applied to predictively simulate infrared detector arrays of current technological interest. The models can be used to a priori estimate detector characteristics, intelligently design detector architectures, and assist in the analysis and interpretation of existing systems. This dissertation develops a multi-scale simulation model which evaluates the physics of infrared systems from the atomic (material properties and electronic structure) to systems level (modulation transfer function, dense array effects). The framework is used to determine the electronic structure of several infrared materials, optimize the design of a two-color back-to-back HgCdTe photodiode, investigate a predicted failure mechanism for next-generation arrays, and predict the systems-level measurables of a number of detector architectures.\n\nHigh precision detector robot arm system\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nShu, Deming; Chu, Yong\n\nA method and high precision robot arm system are provided, for example, for X-ray nanodiffraction with an X-ray nanoprobe.

This paper develops an analytical model of PCD imaging performance, including the system gain, modulation transfer function (MTF), noise-power spectrum (NPS), and detective quantum efficiency (DQE). A cascaded systems analysis model describing the propagation of quanta through the imaging chain was developed. The model was validated in comparison to the physical performance of a silicon-strip PCD implemented on an experimental imaging bench. The signal response, MTF, and NPS were measured and compared to theory as a function of exposure conditions (70 kVp, 1-7 mA), detector threshold, and readout mode (i.e., the option for coincidence detection). The model sheds new light on the dependence of spatial resolution, charge sharing, and additive noise effects on threshold selection and was used to investigate the factors governing PCD performance, including the fundamental advantages and limitations of PCDs in comparison to energy-integrating detectors (EIDs) in the linear regime for which pulse pileup can be ignored.

The radiation detector system includes a radiation detector thermally coupled to a thermo electric cooler (TEC). The TEC cools down the radiation detector, whereby heat is generated by the TEC. A heat removal device dissipates the heat generated by the TEC to surrounding environment. A heat pipe has a first end thermally coupled to the TEC to receive the heat generated by the TEC, and a second end thermally coupled to the heat removal device. The heat pipe transfers the heat generated by the TEC from the first end to the second end to be removed by the heat removal device.\n\nCascaded systems analysis of photon counting detectors\n\nPubMed Central\n\nXu, J.; Zbijewski, W.; Gang, G.; Stayman, J. W.; Taguchi, K.; Lundqvist, M.; Fredenberg, E.; Carrino, J. A.; Siewerdsen, J. H.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPurpose: Photon counting detectors (PCDs) are an emerging technology with applications in spectral and low-dose radiographic and tomographic imaging. This paper develops an analytical model of PCD imaging performance, including the system gain, modulation transfer function (MTF), noise-power spectrum (NPS), and detective quantum efficiency (DQE). Methods: A cascaded systems analysis model describing the propagation of quanta through the imaging chain was developed. The model was validated in comparison to the physical performance of a silicon-strip PCD implemented on an experimental imaging bench. The signal response, MTF, and NPS were measured and compared to theory as a function of exposure conditions (70 kVp, 1â7 mA), detector threshold, and readout mode (i.e., the option for coincidence detection). The model sheds new light on the dependence of spatial resolution, charge sharing, and additive noise effects on threshold selection and was used to investigate the factors governing PCD performance, including the fundamental advantages and limitations of PCDs in comparison to energy-integrating detectors (EIDs) in the linear regime for which pulse pileup can be ignored. Results: The detector exhibited highly linear mean signal response across the system operating range and agreed well with theoretical prediction, as did the system MTF and NPS. The DQE analyzed as a function of kilovolt (peak), exposure, detector threshold, and readout mode revealed important considerations for system optimization. The model also demonstrated the important implications of false counts from both additive electronic noise and charge sharing and highlighted the system design and operational parameters that most affect detector performance in the presence of such factors: for example, increasing the detector threshold from 0 to 100 (arbitrary units of pulse height threshold roughly equivalent to 0.5 and 6 keV energy threshold, respectively), increased the f50 (spatial-frequency at\n\nSeismic intrusion detector system\n\nDOEpatents\n\nHawk, Hervey L.; Hawley, James G.; Portlock, John M.; Scheibner, James E.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nA system for monitoring man-associated seismic movements within a control area including a geophone for generating an electrical signal in response to seismic movement, a bandpass amplifier and threshold detector for eliminating unwanted signals, pulse counting system for counting and storing the number of seismic movements within the area, and a monitoring system operable on command having a variable frequency oscillator generating an audio frequency signal proportional to the number of said seismic movements.\n\nCamera System MTF: combining optic with detector\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAndersen, Torben B.; Granger, Zachary A.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nMTF is one of the most common metrics used to quantify the resolving power of an optical component. Extensive literature is dedicated to describing methods to calculate the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) for stand-alone optical components such as a camera lens or telescope, and some literature addresses approaches to determine an MTF for combination of an optic with a detector. The formulations pertaining to a combined electro-optical system MTF are mostly based on theory, and assumptions that detector MTF is described only by the pixel pitch which does not account for wavelength dependencies. When working with real hardware, detectors are often characterized by testing MTF at discrete wavelengths. This paper presents a method to simplify the calculation of a polychromatic system MTF when it is permissible to consider the detector MTF to be independent of wavelength.\n\nRADIATION DETECTOR SYSTEM\n\nDOEpatents\n\nGundlach, J.C.; Kelley, G.G.\n\n1958-02-25\n\nThis patent relates to radiation detection devices and presents a unique detection system especialiy desirable for portable type instruments using a Geiger-Mueller for a high voltage battery, thereby reducing the size and weight of the instrument, by arranging a one-shot multivibrator to recharge a capacitance applying operating potential to tho Geiger-Mueller tube each time a nuclear particle is detected. When detection occurs, the multivibrator further delivers a pulse to an appropriate indicator doing away with the necessity for the pulse amplifier conventionally intermediate between the detector and indicator in pulse detection systems.\n\nResearch on application of several tracking detectors in APT system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Zhi\n\n2005-01-01\n\nAPT system is the key technology in free space optical communication system, and acquisition and tracking detector is the key component in PAT system.

Albert; Vaughn, Valentine; McCully, Michael; Ulrich, Steven; Egan, Thomas F.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nA modified ion-detector/data-acquisition system has been devised to increase the dynamic range of a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS) that, previously, included a microchannel-plate detector and a data-acquisition system based on counting pulses and time-tagging them by use of a time-to-digital converter (TDC). The dynamic range of the TOF-MS was limited by saturation of the microchannel plate detector, which can handle no more than a few million counts per second. The modified system includes (1) a combined microchannel plate/discrete ion multiplier and (2) a hybrid data-acquisition system that simultaneously performs analog current or voltage measurements and multianode single-ion-pulse-counting time-of-flight measurements to extend the dynamic range of a TDC into the regime in which a mass peak comprises multiple ions arriving simultaneously at the detector. The multianode data are used to determine, in real time, whether the detector is saturated. When saturation is detected, the data-acquisition system selectively enables circuitry that simultaneously determines the ion-peak intensity by measuring the time profile of the analog current or voltage detector-output signal.\n\nAsymmetric Data Acquisition System for an Endoscopic PET-US Detector\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZorraquino, Carlos; Bugalho, Ricardo; Rolo, Manuel; Silva, Jose C.; Vecklans, Viesturs; Silva, Rui; OrtigÃ£o, Catarina; Neves, Jorge A.; Tavernier, Stefaan; Guerra, Pedro; Santos, Andres; Varela, JoÃ£o\n\n2016-02-01\n\nAccording to current prognosis studies of pancreatic cancer, survival rate nowadays is still as low as 6% mainly due to late detections. Taking into account the location of the disease within the body and making use of the level of miniaturization in radiation detectors that can be achieved at the present time, EndoTOFPET-US collaboration aims at the development of a multimodal imaging technique for endoscopic pancreas exams that combines the benefits of high resolution metabolic information from time-of- flight (TOF) positron emission tomography (PET) with anatomical information from ultrasound (US). A system with such capabilities calls for an application-specific high-performance data acquisition system (DAQ) able to control and readout data from different detectors. The system is composed of two novel detectors: a PET head extension for a commercial US endoscope placed internally close to the region-of-interest (ROI) and a PET plate placed over the patient's abdomen in coincidence with the PET head. These two detectors will send asymmetric data streams that need to be handled by the DAQ system. The approach chosen to cope with these needs goes through the implementation of a DAQ capable of performing multi-level triggering and which is distributed across two different on-detector electronics and the off-detector electronics placed inside the reconstruction workstation. This manuscript provides an overview on the design of this innovative DAQ system and, based on results obtained by means of final prototypes of the two detectors and DAQ, we conclude that a distributed multi-level triggering DAQ system is suitable for endoscopic PET detectors and it shows potential for its application in different scenarios with asymmetric sources of data.\n\nThe Zero-Degree Detector System for Fragmentation Studies\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAdams, J.

If light and heavy fragments are recorded in 'ne same detector, it may be impossible distinguish the signal from the light fragment. To overcome this problem, we have developed the Zero-Degree Detector System.

It is planned to run the fluorescence detectors in absence of operators on site. Therefore, the main task of the Slow Control System (SCS) is to ensure a secure remote operation of the FD system. The Slow Control System works autonomously and continuously monitors those parameters which may disturb a secure operation.

Typically, for a reasonable detector area, an impedance-matched anode design is necessary to transmit the registered signal fast and distortion-free from the anode to the signal acquisition system. In this report, a high-speed microstrip multi-anode multichannel plate detector is presented and discussed. The anode consists of four separate active concentric anode segments allowing a simultaneous readout of signal with a dynamic range of about eight orders of magnitude. The impedance matched anode segments show pulse width of about 250 ps, measured at full width at half maximum, and rise time of Ë170 ps, measured with an oscilloscope with a sampling rate of 20 GS/s and 4 GHz analogue bandwidth.

G.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nDetector systems based on the high gain microchannel plate (MCP) electron multiplier were used extensively for imaging at soft X-ray wavelengths both on the ground and in space. The latest pulse counting electronic readout systems provide zero readout noise, spatial resolutions (FWHM) of 25 microns or better and can determine the arrival times of detected photons to an accuracy of the order of 100 ns. These systems can be developed to produce detectors with active areas of 100 nm in diameter or greater. The use of CsI photocathodes produces very high detective quantum efficiencies at wavelengths between about 100 and 1A (approximately 0.1 to 10 keV) with moderate energy resolution.

Multi-anode microchannel array detector systems with formats as large as 256 x 1024 pixels are currently under evaluation. Preliminary performance data for sealed ultraviolet and visible-light detector tubes show that the detector systems have unique characteristics which make them complementary to photoconductive array detectors, such as CCDs, and superior to alternative pulse-counting detector systems employing high-gain MCPs.\n\nA pixel detector system for laser-accelerated ion detection\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nReinhardt, S.; Draxinger, W.; Schreiber, J.; Assmann, W.\n\n2013-03-01\n\nLaser ion acceleration is an unique acceleration process that creates ultra-short ion pulses of high intensity ( > 107 ions/cm2/ns), which makes online detection an ambitious task. Non-electronic detectors such as radio-chromic films (RCF), imaging plates (IP) or nuclear track detectors (e.g. CR39) are broadly used at present. Only offline information on ion pulse intensity and position are available by these detectors, as minutes to hours of processing time are required after their exposure. With increasing pulse repetition rate of the laser system, there is a growing need for detection of laser accelerated ions in real-time. Therefore, we have investigated a commercial pixel detector system for online detection of laser-accelerated proton pulses. The CMOS imager RadEye1 was chosen, which is based on a photodiode array, 512 Ã 1024 pixels with 48 Î¼m pixel pitch, thus offering a large sensitive area of approximately 25 Ã 50 mm2. First detection tests were accomplished at the conventional electrostatic 14 MV Tandem accelerator in Munich as well as Atlas laser accelerator. Detector response measurements at the conventional accelerator have been accomplished in a proton beam in dc (15 MeV) and pulsed (20 MeV) irradiation mode, the latter providing comparable particle flux as under laser acceleration conditions. Radiation hardness of the device was studied using protons (20 MeV) and C-ions (77 MeV), additionally. The detector system shows a linear response up to a maximum pulse flux of about 107 protons/cm2/ns. Single particle detection is possible in a low flux beam (104 protons/cm2/s) for all investigated energies. The radiation hardness has shown to give reasonable lifetime for an application at the laser accelerator. The results from the irradiation at a conventional accelerator are confirmed by a cross-calibration with CR39 in a laser-accelerated proton beam at the MPQ Atlas Laser in Garching, showing no problems of detector operation in presence of electro\n\nThe Daya Bay antineutrino detector filling system and liquid mass measurement\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBand, H. R.; Cherwinka, J. J.; Draeger, E.; Heeger, K. M.; Hinrichs, P.; Lewis, C. A.; Mattison, H.; McFarlane, M. C.; Webber, D. M.; Wenman, D.; Wang, W.; Wise, T.; Xiao, Q.\n\n2013-09-01\n\nThe Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment has measured the neutrino mixing angle Î¸13 to world-leading precision. The experiment uses eight antineutrino detectors filled with 20-tons of gadolinium-doped liquid scintillator to detect antineutrinos emitted from the Daya Bay nuclear power plant through the inverse beta decay reaction. The precision measurement of sin22Î¸13 relies on the relative antineutrino interaction rates between detectors at near (400 m) and far (roughly 1.8 km) distances from the nuclear reactors. The measured interaction rate in each detector is directly proportional to the number of protons in the liquid scintillator target. A precision detector filling system was developed to simultaneously fill the three liquid zones of the antineutrino detectors and measure the relative target mass between detectors to < 0.02%. This paper describes the design, operation, and performance of the system and the resulting precision measurement of the detectors' target liquid masses.\n\nTest results of a new detector system for gamma ray isotopic measurements\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMalcom, J.E.; Bonner, C.A.; Hurd, J.R.\n\n1993-08-01\n\nA new type of gamma-ray detector system for isotopic measurements has been developed. This new system, a ``Duo detector`` array, consists of two intrinsic germanium detectors, a planar followed by a coaxial mounted on the same axis within a single cryostat assembly. This configuration allows the isotopic analysis system to take advantage of spectral data results that are collected simultaneously from different gamma-ray energy regimes. Princeton Gamma Tech (PGT) produced several prototypes of this Duo detector array which were then tested by Rocky Flats personnel until the design was optimized. An application for this detector design is in automated, roboticizedmoreÂ Â» NDA systems such as those being developed at the Los Alamos TA-55 Plutonium Facility. The Duo detector design reduces the space necessary for the isotopic instrument by a factor of two (only one liquid nitrogen dewar is needed), and also reduces the complexity of the mechanical systems and controlling software. Data will be presented on measurements of nuclear material with a Duo detector for a wide variety of matrices. Results indicate that the maximum count rate can be increased up to 100,000 counts per second yet maintaining excellent resolution and energy rate product.Â«Â less\n\nCharacterization and optimization for detector systems of IGRINS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJeong, Ueejeong; Chun, Moo-Young; Oh, Jae Sok; Park, Chan; Yuk, In-Soo; Oh, Heeyoung; Kim, Kang-Min; Ko, Kyeong Yeon; Pavel, Michael D.; Yu, Young Sam; Jaffe, Daniel T.\n\n2014-07-01\n\nIGRINS (Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer) is a high resolution wide-band infrared spectrograph developed by the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI) and the University of Texas at Austin (UT). This spectrograph has H-band and K-band science cameras and a slit viewing camera, all three of which use Teledyne's Î»c~2.5Î¼m 2kÃ2k HgCdTe HAWAII-2RG CMOS detectors. The two spectrograph cameras employ science grade detectors, while the slit viewing camera includes an engineering grade detector. Teledyne's cryogenic SIDECAR ASIC boards and JADE2 USB interface cards were installed to control those detectors. We performed experiments to characterize and optimize the detector systems in the IGRINS cryostat. We present measurements and optimization of noise, dark current, and referencelevel stability obtained under dark conditions. We also discuss well depth, linearity and conversion gain measurements obtained using an external light source.\n\nDevelopment of the RAIDS extreme ultraviolet wedge and strip detector.
