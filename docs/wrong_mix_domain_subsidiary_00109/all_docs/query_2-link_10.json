        "text": "Test of ATLAS RPCs Front-End electronics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAielli, G.; Camarri, P.; Cardarelli, R.; Di Ciaccio, A.; Di Stante, L.; Liberti, B.; Paoloni, A.; Pastori, E.; Santonico, R.\n\n2003-08-01\n\nThe Front-End Electronics performing the ATLAS RPCs readout is a full custom 8 channels GaAs circuit, which integrates in a single die both the analog and digital signal processing. The die is bonded on the Front-End board which is completely closed inside the detector Faraday cage. About 50 000 FE boards are foreseen for the experiment. The complete functionality of the FE boards will be certificated before the detector assembly. We describe here the systematic test devoted to check the dynamic functionality of each single channel and the selection criteria applied. It measures and registers all relevant electronics parameters to build up a complete database for the experiment. The statistical results from more than 1100 channels are presented.\n\nFront-end electronics of the Belle II drift chamber\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShimazaki, Shoichi; Taniguchi, Takashi; Uchida, Tomohisa; Ikeno, Masahiro; Taniguchi, Nanae; Tanaka, Manobu M.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis paper describes the performance of the Belle II central drift chamber (CDC) front-end electronics. The front-end electronics consists of a current sensitive preamplifier, a 1/t cancellation circuit, baseline restorers, a comparator for timing measurement and an analog buffer for the dE/dx measurement on a CDC readout card. The CDC readout card is located on the endplate of the CDC. Mass production will be completed after the performance of the chip is verified. The electrical performance and results of a neutron/gamma-ray irradiation test are reported here.\n\nFront-end electronics development for TPC detector in the MPD/NICA project\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCheremukhina, G.; Movchan, S.; Vereschagin, S.; Zaporozhets, S.\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThe article is aimed at describing the development status, measuring results and design changes of the TPC front-end electronics. The TPC is placed in the middle of Multi-Purpose Detector (MPD) and provides tracing and identifying of charged particles in the pseudorapidity range |Î·| < 1.2. The readout system is one of the most complex parts of the TPC. The electronics of each readout chamber is an independent system. The whole system contains 95232 channels, 1488 64-channelâfront-end cards (FEC), 24 readout control units (RCU). The front-end electronics (FEE) is based on ASICs, FPGAs and high-speed serial links. The concept of the TPC front-end electronics has been motivated from one sideâby the requirements concerning the NICA accelerator complex which will operate at the luminosity up to 1027 cm-2 s-1 for Au79+ ions over the energy range of 4 < âSNN < 11 GeV with the trigger rate up to 7 kHz and from the other sideâby the requirements of the 4-Ï geometry to minimize the substance on the end-caps of the TPC.\n\nPassive front-ends for wideband millimeter wave electronic warfare\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJastram, Nathan Joseph\n\nThis thesis presents the analysis, design and measurements of novel passive front ends of interest to millimeter wave electronic warfare systems. However, emerging threats in the millimeter waves (18 GHz and above) has led to a push for new systems capable of addressing these threats. At these frequencies, traditional techniques of design and fabrication are challenging due to small size, limited bandwidth and losses. The use of surface micromachining technology for wideband direction finding with multiple element antenna arrays for electronic support is demonstrated. A wideband tapered slot antenna is first designed and measured as an array element for the subsequent arrays. Both 18--36 GHz and 75--110 GHz amplitude only and amplitude/phase two element direction finding front ends are designed and measured. The design of arrays using Butler matrix and Rotman lens beamformers for greater than two element direction finding over W band and beyond using is also presented. The design of a dual polarized high power capable front end for electronic attack over an 18--45 GHz band is presented. To combine two polarizations into the same radiating aperture, an orthomode transducer (OMT) based upon a new double ridge waveguide cross section is developed. To provide greater flexibility in needed performance characteristics, several different turnstile junction matching sections are tested. A modular horn section is proposed to address flexible and ever changing operational requirements, and is designed for performance criteria such as constant gain, beamwidth, etc. A multi-section branch guide coupler and low loss Rotman lens based upon the proposed cross section are also developed. Prototyping methods for the herein designed millimeter wave electronic warfare front ends are investigated. Specifically, both printed circuit board (PCB) prototyping of micromachined systems and 3D printing of conventionally machined horns are presented.

J.; Wormser, G.; Zhang, B.; Zomer, F.\n\n2000-12-01\n\nRecent results from the Front-End electronics of the Detector of Internally Reflected Cerenkov light (DIRC) for the BaBar experiment at SLAC (Stanford, USA) are presented. It measures to better than 1 ns the arrival time of Cerenkov photoelectrons detected in a 11000 phototubes array and their amplitude spectra. It mainly comprises 64-channel DIRC Front-End Boards (DFB) equipped with eight full-custom analog chips performing zero-cross discrimination with 2 mV threshold and pulse shaping, four full-custom digital time to digital chips (TDC) for timing measurements with 500 ps binning and a readout logic selecting hits in the trigger window, and DIRC Crate Controller cards (DCC) serializing the data collected front up to 16 DFBs onto a 1.2 Gb/s optical link. Extensive test results of the pre-production chips are presented, as well as system tests.\n\nFront-end Electronics for Unattended Measurement (FEUM). Prototype Test Plan\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nConrad, Ryan C.; Morris, Scott J.; Smith, Leon E.\n\n2015-09-16\n\nThe IAEA has requested that PNNL perform an initial set of tests on front-end electronics for unattended measurement (FEUM) prototypes. The FEUM prototype test plan details the tests to be performed, the criteria for evaluation, and the procedures used to execute the tests.\n\nLow-noise front-end electronics for detection of intermediate-frequency weak light signals\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLin, Cunbao; Yan, Shuhua; Du, Zhiguang; Wei, Chunhua; Wang, Guochao\n\n2015-02-01\n\nA novel low-noise front-end electronics was proposed for detection of light signals with intensity about 10 Î¼W and frequency above 2.7 MHz. The direct current (DC) power supply, pre-amplifier and main-amplifier were first designed, simulated and then realized. Small-size components were used to make the power supply small, and the pre-amplifier and main-amplifier were the least capacitors to avoid the phase shift of the signals. The performance of the developed front-end electronics was verified in cross-grating diffraction experiments. The results indicated that the output peak-topeak noise of the +/-5 V DC power supply was about 2 mV, and the total output current was 1.25 A. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the output signal of the pre-amplifier was about 50 dB, and it increased to nearly 60 dB after the mainamplifier, which means this front-end electronics was especially suitable for using in the phase-sensitive and integrated precision measurement systems.\n\nFront-end electronics for the LZ experiment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMorad, James; LZ Collaboration\n\n2016-03-01\n\nLZ is a second generation direct dark matter detection experiment with 5.6 tonnes of liquid xenon active target, which will be instrumented as a two-phase time projection chamber (TPC). The peripheral xenon outside the active TPC (``skin'') will also be instrumented. In addition, there will be a liquid scintillator based outer veto surrounding the main cryostat. All of these systems will be read out using photomultiplier tubes. I will present the designs for front-end electronics for all these systems, which have been optimized for shaping times, gains, and low noise. Preliminary results from prototype boards will also be presented.\n\nThe Majorana Low-noise Low-background Front-end Electronics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAbgrall, N.; Aguayo, E.; Avignone, F.

In view of the next generation of tonne-scale germanium-based Î²Î²(0Î½)-decay searches, a major goal of the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR is to demonstrate a path forward to achieving a background rate at or below 1 cnt/(ROI-t-y) in the 4 keV region of interest (ROI) around the 2039-keV Q-value of the 76Ge Î²Î²(0Î½)-decay. Such a requirement on the background level significantly constrains the design of the readout electronics, which is further driven by noise and energy resolution performances. We present here the low-noise low- background front-end electronics developed for the low-capacitance p-type point contact (P-PC) germanium detectors of the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR. This resistive-feedback front-end, specifically designed to have low mass, is fabricated on a radioassayed fused-silica substrate where the feedback resistor consists of a sputtered thin film of high purity amorphous germanium and the feedback capacitor is based on the capacitance between gold conductive traces.\n\nA front-end electronic system for large arrays of bolometers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nArnaboldi, C.; Carniti, P.; Cassina, L.; Gotti, C.; Liu, X.; Maino, M.; Pessina, G.; Rosenfeld, C.; Zhu, B. X.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nCUORE is an array of thermal calorimeters composed of 988 crystals held at about 10 mK, whose absorbed energy is read out with semiconductor thermistors. The composition of the crystal is TeO2, and the aim is the study of the double beta decay of 130Te on very long and stable runs. CUPID-0 is an array of 26 Zn82Se crystals with double thermistor readout to study the double beta decay of 82Se. In the present paper, we present an overview of the entire front-end electronic readout chain, from the preamplifier to the anti-aliasing filter. This overview includes motivations, design strategies, circuit implementation and performance results of the electronic system, including other auxiliary yet important elements like power supplies and the slow control communication system. The stringent requirements of stability on the very long experimental runs that are foreseen during CUORE and CUPID-0 operation, are achieved thanks to novel solutions of the front-end preamplifier and of the detector bias circuit setup.\n\nOptimizing read-out of the NECTAr front-end electronics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVorobiov, S.; Feinstein, F.; Bolmont, J.; Corona, P.; Delagnes, E.; Falvard, A.; GascÃ³n, D.; Glicenstein, J.-F.; Naumann, C. L.; Nayman, P.; Ribo, M.; Sanuy, A.; Tavernet, J.-P.; Toussenel, F.; Vincent, P.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nWe describe the optimization of the read-out specifications of the NECTAr front-end electronics for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). The NECTAr project aims at building and testing a demonstrator module of a new front-end electronics design, which takes an advantage of the know-how acquired while building the cameras of the CAT, H.E.S.S.-I and H.E.S.S.-II experiments. The goal of the optimization work is to define the specifications of the digitizing electronics of a CTA camera, in particular integration time window, sampling rate, analog bandwidth using physics simulations. We employed for this work real photomultiplier pulses, sampled at 100 ps with a 600 MHz bandwidth oscilloscope. The individual pulses are drawn randomly at the times at which the photo-electrons, originating from atmospheric showers, arrive at the focal planes of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The timing information is extracted from the existing CTA simulations on the GRID and organized in a local database, together with all the relevant physical parameters (energy, primary particle type, zenith angle, distance from the shower axis, pixel offset from the optical axis, night-sky background level, etc.), and detector configurations (telescope types, camera/mirror configurations, etc.). While investigating the parameter space, an optimal pixel charge integration time window, which minimizes relative error in the measured charge, has been determined. This will allow to gain in sensitivity and to lower the energy threshold of CTA telescopes. We present results of our optimizations and first measurements obtained using the NECTAr demonstrator module.\n\nThe Majorana low-noise low-background front-end electronics\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nAbgrall, N.; Aguayo, E.; Avignone, III, F.

The front-end electronics will be replaced to address the increased luminosity at the HL-LHC around 2025, as well as to upgrade to faster, more modern components with higher radiation tolerance. The new electronics will operate dead-timelessly, pushing full data sets from each beam crossing to the data acquisition system that resides off-detector. The new on-detector electronics contains five main parts: the front-end boards that connect directly to the photomultiplier tubes; the Main Boards that digitize the data; the Daughter Boards that collect the data streams and contain the high speed optical communication links for writing data to the data acquisition system; a programmable high voltage control system; and a new low voltage power supply. There are different options for implementing these subcomponents, which will be described. The new system contains new features that in the current version include power system redundancy, data collection redundancy, data transmission redundancy with 2 QSFP optical transceivers and Kintex-7 FPGAs with firmware enhanced scheme for single event upset mitigation. To date, we have built a Demonstratorâa fully functional prototype of the new system. Performance results and plans are presented.\n\nWeb-based DAQ systems: connecting the user and electronics front-ends\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLenzi, Thomas\n\n2016-12-01\n\nWeb technologies are quickly evolving and are gaining in computational power and flexibility, allowing for a paradigm shift in the field of Data Acquisition (DAQ) systems design. Modern web browsers offer the possibility to create intricate user interfaces and are able to process and render complex data. Furthermore, new web standards such as WebSockets allow for fast real-time communication between the server and the user with minimal overhead. Those improvements make it possible to move the control and monitoring operations from the back-end servers directly to the user and to the front-end electronics, thus reducing the complexity of the data acquisition chain. Moreover, web-based DAQ systems offer greater flexibility, accessibility, and maintainability on the user side than traditional applications which often lack portability and ease of use. As proof of concept, we implemented a simplified DAQ system on a mid-range Spartan6 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) development board coupled to a digital front-end readout chip. The system is connected to the Internet and can be accessed from any web browser. It is composed of custom code to control the front-end readout and of a dual soft-core Microblaze processor to communicate with the client.\n\nFront-end Electronics for Unattended Measurement (FEUM). Results of Prototype Evaluation\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nConrad, Ryan C.; Keller, Daniel T.; Morris, Scott J.\n\n2015-07-01\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) deploys unattended monitoring systems to provide continuous monitoring of nuclear material within safeguarded facilities around the world. As the number of unattended monitoring instruments increases, the IAEA is challenged to become more efficient in the implementation of those systems. In 2010, the IAEA initiated the Front-End Electronics for Unattended Measurement (FEUM) project with the goals of greater flexibility in the interfaces to various sensors and data acquisition systems, and improved capabilities for remotely located sensors (e.g., where sensor and front-end electronics might be separated by tens of meters). In consultation with the IAEA, amoreÂ Â» technical evaluation of a candidate FEUM device produced by a commercial vendor has been performed. This evaluation assessed the device against the IAEAâs original technical specifications and a broad range of important parameters that include sensor types, cable lengths and types, industrial electromagnetic noise that can degrade signals from remotely located detectors, and high radiation fields. Testing data, interpretation, findings and recommendations are provided.Â«Â less\n\nPMF: The front end electronic of the ALFA detector\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBarrillon, P.; Blin, S.; Cheikali, C.; Cuisy, D.; Gaspard, M.; Fournier, D.; Heller, M.; Iwanski, W.; Lavigne, B.; De la Taille, C.; Puzo, P.; Socha, J.-L.\n\n2010-11-01\n\nThe front end electronic (PMF) of the future ATLAS luminometer is described here. It is composed of a MAPMT and a compact stack of three PCBs, which deliver high voltage, route and read out of the output signals. The third board contains an FPGA and MAROC, a 64-channel ASIC, which can correct the non-uniformity of the MAPMT channels gain, thanks to a variable gain preamplifier. Its main role is to shape and discriminate the input signals at 1/3 photo-electron and produce 64 trigger outputs. Laboratory tests performed on prototype and pre-series PMFs have showed performances in good agreement with the requirements and have fulfilled the approval criteria for the final production of all elements.\n\nSPD very front end electronics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLuengo, S.; GascÃ³n, D.; Comerma, A.; Garrido, L.; Riera, J.; Tortella, S.; VilasÃ­s, X.\n\n2006-11-01\n\nThe Scintillator Pad Detector (SPD) is part of the LHCb calorimetry system [D. Breton, The front-end electronics for LHCb calorimeters, Tenth International Conference on Calorimetry in Particle Physics, CALOR, Pasadena, 2002] that provides high-energy hadron, electron and photon candidates for the first level trigger. The SPD is designed to distinguish electrons from photons. It consists of a plastic scintillator layer, divided into about 6000 cells of different size to obtain better granularity near the beam [S. Amato, et al., LHCb technical design report, CERN/LHCC/2000-0036, 2000]. Charged particles will produce, and photons will not, ionization in the scintillator. This ionization generates a light pulse that is collected by a WaveLength Shifting (WLS) fiber that is coiled inside the scintillator cell. The light is transmitted through a clear fiber to the readout system that is placed at the periphery of the detector. Due to space constraints, and in order to reduce costs, these 6000 cells are divided in groups using a MAPMT [Z. Ajaltouni, et al., Nucl. Instr. and Meth. A 504 (2003) 9] of 64 channels that provides information to the VFE readout electronics. The SPD signal has rather large statistical fluctuations because of the low number (20-30) of photoelectrons per MIP. Therefore the signal is integrated over the whole bunch crossing length of 25 ns in order to have the maximum value. Since in average about 85% of the SPD signal is within 25 ns, 15% of a sample is subtracted from the following one using an operational amplifier. The SPD VFE readout system that will be presented consists of the following components. A specific ASIC [D. Gascon, et al., Discriminator ASIC for the VFE SPD of the LHCb Calorimeter, LHCB Technical Note, LHCB 2004-xx] integrates the signal, makes the signal-tail subtraction, and compares the level obtained to a programmable threshold (to distinguish electrons from photons). A FPGA programmes the ASIC threshold and the value for\n\nDigital front end electronics design for the EUSO photon detector\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMusico, P.; Pallavicini, M.; Petrolini, A.; Pratolongo, F.\n\n2003-09-01\n\nIn this paper we will present the design status of the Digital Front End Electronic system (DFEE), that will be used for the EUSO photon detector. The DFEE is able to count the single photoelectrons coming form the detector for a given time period, store the numbers in a memory buffer and read them out after a trigger, using a serial communication line. Because of space, mass and power consumption constraints, the system will be implemented in an ASIC using a deep submicron technology. The actual design follows the original ideas of the system, though adding several new functionalities. A fully functional prototype chip has been submitted for fabrication in fall 2002. Extensive tests will be performed on it both with bench instrumentations and with the real sensor (the multi anode photomultiplier Hamamatsu R7600-M64), expecting significant results by early Summer 2003. Future work is needed to convert the design into a more robust RAD-hard technology, suitable for space applications and to include in the final die an additional circuit used to optimize the performances at high photons rates: the Analog Front End Electronics (AFEE). Moreover the base board used to house the multi anode photomultipliers is presented: it is the back-bone of the microcell and will be the basic block used to build up the EUSO focal surface.\n\nA Test Apparatus for the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR Front-end Electronics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSingh, Harjit; Loach, James; Poon, Alan\n\n2012-10-01\n\nOne of the most important experimental programs in neutrino physics is the search for neutrinoless double-beta decay. The MAJORANA collaboration is searching for this rare nuclear process in the Ge-76 isotope using HPGe detectors. Each detector is instrumented with high-performance electronics to read out and amplify the signals. The part of the electronics close to the detectors, consisting of a novel front-end circuit, cables and connectors, is made of radio-pure materials and is exceedingly delicate. In this work a dedicated test apparatus was created to benchmark the performance of the electronics before installation in the experiment. The apparatus was designed for cleanroom use, with fixtures to hold the components without contaminating them, and included the electronics necessary for power and readout. In addition to testing, the station will find longer term use in development of future versions of the electronics.\n\nGravitational Reference Sensor Front-End Electronics Simulator for LISA\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMeshksar, Neda; Ferraioli, Luigi; Mance, Davor; ten Pierick, Jan; Zweifel, Peter; Giardini, Domenico; \">LISA Pathfinder colaboration, Front End Electronics (FEE) for LISA Gravitational Reference Sensor (GRS).

Based on the ETH GRS FEE-simulator for LISA Pathfinder we aim to develop a modular simulator that provides a realistic simulation of GRS FEE for LISA.\n\nEnd-Users, Front Ends and Librarians.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBourne, Donna E.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe increase in end-user searching, the advantages and limitations of front ends, and the role of the librarian in end-user searching are discussed. It is argued that librarians need to recognize that front ends can be of benefit to themselves and patrons, and to assume the role of advisors and educators for end-users.

One critical sub-detector of the DAMPE payload is the BGO (bismuth germanium oxide) calorimeter, which contains 1848 PMT (photomultiplier tube) dynodes and 16 FEE (Front-End Electronics) boards. VA160 and VATA160, two 32-channel low power ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits), are adopted as the key components on the FEEs to perform charge measurement for the PMT signals. In order to monitor the parameter drift which may be caused by temperature variation, aging, or other environmental factors, an onboard calibration circuit is designed for the VA160 and VATA160 ASICs. It is mainly composed of a 12-bit DAC (Digital to Analog Converter), an operational amplifier and an analog switch. Test results showed that a dynamic range of 0-30 pC with a precision of 5 fC (Root Meam Square, RMS) was achieved, which covers the VA160âs input range. It can be used to compensate for the temperature drift and test the trigger function of the FEEs. The calibration circuit has been implemented for the front-end electronics of the BGO Calorimeter and verified by all the environmental tests for both Qualification Model and Flight Model of DAMPE. The DAMPE satellite was launched at the end of 2015 and the calibration circuit will operate periodically in space.

ADCs achieving 8-10 bit resolution, 50-100 MHz conversion frequency and less than 1 mW power consumption are the today's standard, while TDCs have reached sub-picosecond time resolution. These results have been made possible by architectural upgrades combined with the use of ultra deep submicron CMOS technologies with minimum feature size of 130 nm or smaller. Front-end ASICs in which a prompt digitization is followed by signal conditioning in the digital domain can now be envisaged also within the tight power budget typically available in high density tracking systems. Furthermore, tracking detectors embedding high resolution timing capabilities are gaining interest. In the paper, ADC's and TDC's developments which are of particular relevance for the design front-end electronics for semiconductor trackers are discussed along with the benefits and challenges of exploiting such high performance building blocks in implementing the next generation of ASICs for high granularity particle detectors.\n\nNon-Electronic Radio Front-End (NERF)\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2007-04-01\n\nelectro - optic field sensor.

When considering photodetectors, the cost per channel is determined by the use of high-voltage, analog-to-digital converters, BNC cables, and any other ancillary devices. The overhead associated with device operation limits the number of channels for the detector system, while potentially limiting the scope of physics that can be explored. The PRIMEX experiment at JLab, which is being designed to measure the radiative widths of the Î· and Î·' pseudo-scalar mesons for a more comprehensive understanding of QCD at low energies, is an example where CMOS solid-state photomultipliers (SSPMs) can be implemented. The ubiquitous nature of CMOS allows for on-chip signal processing to provide front-end electronics within the detector package. We present the results of the device development for the PRIMEX calorimeter, discussing the characteristics of SSPMs, the potential cost savings, and experimental results of on-chip signal processing.\n\nThe front-end electronics of the LSPE-SWIPE experiment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFontanelli, F.; Biasotti, M.; Bevilacqua, A.; Siccardi, F.\n\n2016-07-01\n\nThe SWIPE detector of the Ballon Borne Mission LSPE (see e.g. the contribution of P. de Bernardis et al. in this conference) intends to measure the primordial 'B-mode' polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). For this scope microwave telescopes need sensitive cryogenic bolometers with an overall equivalent noise temperature in the nK range. The detector is a spiderweb bolometer based on transition edge sensor and followed by a SQUID to perform the signal readout. This contribution will concentrate on the design, description and first tests on the front-end electronics which processes the squid output (and controls it). The squid output is first amplified by a very low noise preamplifier based on a discrete JFET input differential architecture followed by a low noise CMOS operational amplifier. Equivalent input noise density is 0.6 nV/Hz and bandwidth extends up to at least 2 MHz. Both devices (JFET and CMOS amplifier) have been tested at liquid nitrogen. The second part of the contribution will discuss design and results of the control electronics, both the flux locked loop for the squid and the slow control chain to monitor and set up the system will be reviewed.\n\nFELIX: a PCIe based high-throughput approach for interfacing front-end and trigger electronics in the ATLAS Upgrade framework\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAnderson, J.; Bauer, K.; Borga, A.; Boterenbrood, H.; Chen, H.; Chen, K.; Drake, G.; DÃ¶nszelmann, M.; Francis, D.; Guest, D.; Gorini, B.; Joos, M.; Lanni, F.; Lehmann Miotto, G.; Levinson, L.; Narevicius, J.; Panduro Vazquez, W.; Roich, A.; Ryu, S.; Schreuder, F.; Schumacher, J.; Vandelli, W.; Vermeulen, J.; Whiteson, D.; Wu, W.; Zhang, J.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe ATLAS Phase-I upgrade (2019) requires a Trigger and Data Acquisition (TDAQ) system able to trigger and record data from up to three times the nominal LHC instantaneous luminosity.

The integrated front-end solutions described in this paper use N-channel JFETs as basic elements. The first one is based upon an all-NJFET charge preamplifier designed to match detector capacitances of a few picofarads and available in both a resistive and a non resistive feedback configuration. In the second solution, a single NJFET in the source-follower configuration is connected to the detector, while its source is wired to an external readout channel through an integrated capacitor.\n\nA Front-End electronics board for single photo-electron timing and charge from MaPMT\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGiordano, F.; Breton, D.; Beigbeder, C.; De Robertis, G.; Fusco, P.; Gargano, F.; Liuzzi, R.; Loparco, F.; Mazziotta, M.

These weapons produce a power surge capable of destroying or damaging sensitive circuitry in electronic systems. Unfortunately, the trend towards circuits with smaller sizes and voltages renders modern electronics highly susceptible to such damage. Radiofrequency communication systems are particularly vulnerable, because the antenna provides a direct port of entry for electromagnetic radiation. In this work, we present a novel type of radiofrequency receiver front end featuring a complete absence of electronic circuitry and metal interconnects, the traditional 'soft spots' of a conventional radiofrequency receiver. The device exploits a dielectric resonator antenna to capture and deliver the radiofrequency signal onto a whispering-gallery mode electro-optic field sensor. The dielectric approach has an added benefit in that it reduces the physical size of the front end, an important benefit in mobile applications.\n\nFPGA-Based Front-End Electronics for Positron Emission Tomography\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHaselman, Michael; DeWitt, Don; McDougald, Wendy; Lewellen, Thomas K.; Miyaoka, Robert; Hauck, Scott\n\n2010-01-01\n\nModern Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are capable of performing complex discrete signal processing algorithms with clock rates above 100MHz. This combined with FPGAâs low expense, ease of use, and selected dedicated hardware make them an ideal technology for a data acquisition system for positron emission tomography (PET) scanners. Our laboratory is producing a high-resolution, small-animal PET scanner that utilizes FPGAs as the core of the front-end electronics. For this next generation scanner, functions that are typically performed in dedicated circuits, or offline, are being migrated to the FPGA. This will not only simplify the electronics, but the features of modern FPGAs can be utilizes to add significant signal processing power to produce higher resolution images. In this paper two such processes, sub-clock rate pulse timing and event localization, will be discussed in detail. We show that timing performed in the FPGA can achieve a resolution that is suitable for small-animal scanners, and will outperform the analog version given a low enough sampling period for the ADC. We will also show that the position of events in the scanner can be determined in real time using a statistical positioning based algorithm.

The spread in the thermistor characteristics and bolometer thermal coupling leads to different energy conversion gains and optimum operating points of the detectors. Detector biasing levels and voltage gains are completely remote-adjustable by the front end system developed, the subject of this paper, achieving the same signal range at the input of the DAQ system. The front end consists of a cold buffer stage, a second pseudo differential stage followed by a gain stage, an antialiasing filter, and a battery powered detector biasing set up. The DAQ system can be used to set all necessary parameters of the electronics remotely, by writing to a Î¼-controller located on each board. Fiber optics are used for the serial communication between the DAQ and the front end. To suppress interference noise during normal operation, the clocked devices of the front end are maintained in sleep-mode, except during the set-up phase of the experiment. An automatic DC detector characterization procedure is used to establish the optimum operating point of every detector of the array. A very low noise level has been achieved: about 3nV/â¡Hz at 1 Hz and 1 nV/â¡Hz for the white component, high frequencies.\n\nA front end readout electronics ASIC chip for position sensitive solid state detectors\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKravis, S.D.; Tuemer, T.O.; Visser, G.J.\n\n1998-12-31\n\nA mixed signal Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chip for front end readout electronics of position sensitive solid state detectors has been manufactured.

In addition, as ToF detectors are being constructed with ever improving timing resolution, the need to improve the high speed performance of the fast electronics used in their front-end electronics (FEE) increases. A series of careful measurements has been performed to investigate the performance and efficiency of each element in the FEE chain. The focus of these tests lies on the amplitude transmission efficiency of the high speed signals as a function of frequency, also known as the bandwidth. The components tested include balanced to unbalanced (balun) boards, signal pre-amps, and waveform digitizers. These tests were performed on individual components and with all elements connected over a frequency range of 1MHz to 1GHz. The results of these tests will be presented. This research was supported by US DOE MENP Grant DE-FG02-03ER41243.\n\nDevelopment of a front end controller/heap manager for PHENIX\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nEricson, M.N.; Allen, M.D.; Musrock, M.S.\n\n1996-12-31\n\nA controller/heap manager has been designed for applicability to all detector subsystem types of PHENIX. the heap manager performs all functions associated with front end electronics control including ADC and analog memory control, data collection, command interpretation and execution, and data packet forming and communication. Interfaces to the unit consist of a timing and control bus, a serial bus, a parallel data bus, and a trigger interface. The topology developed is modular so that many functional blocks are identical for a number of subsystem types. Programmability is maximized through the use of flexible modular functions and implementation using field programmablemoreÂ Â» gate arrays (FPGAs). Details of unit design and functionality will be discussed with particular detail given to subsystems having analog memory-based front end electronics. In addition, mode control, serial functions, and FPGA implementation details will be presented.Â«Â less\n\nThe front-end data conversion and readout electronics for the CMS ECAL upgrade\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMazza, G.; Cometti, S.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will require a significant upgrade of the readout electronics for the CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL). The Very Front-End (VFE) output signal will be sampled at 160 MS/s (i.e. four times the current sampling rate) with a 13 bits resolution. Therefore, a high-speed, high-resolution ADC is required. Moreover, each readout channel will produce 2.08 Gb/s, thus requiring a fast data transmission circuitry. A new readout architecture, based on two 12 bit, 160 MS/s ADCs, lossless data compression algorithms and fast serial links have been developed for the ECAL upgrade. These functions will be integrated in a single ASIC which is currently under design in a commercial CMOS 65 nm technology using radiation damage mitigation techniques.\n\nDesign of fast signal processing readout front-end electronics implemented in CMOS 40 nm technology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKleczek, Rafal\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe author presents considerations on the design of fast readout front-end electronics implemented in a CMOS 40 nm technology with an emphasis on the system dead time, noise performance and power dissipation. The designed processing channel consists of a charge sensitive amplifier with different feedback types (Krummenacher, resistive and constant current blocks), a threshold setting block, a discriminator and a counter with logic circuitry. The results of schematic and post-layout simulations with randomly generated input pulses in a time domain according to the Poisson distribution are presented and analyzed.

To reduce the capacitance mismatch, instead of the fractional capacitor, the unit capacitor is used as the bridge capacitor in the split-capacitor digital to analog converter (DAC) circuit. In addition, in order to eliminate the periodical DNL errors of -1 LSB which often exists in the SAR-ADC using the charge-redistributed DAC, a calibration algorithm is proposed and verified by the experiments. The proposed 12-bit 1 MS/s SAR-ADC is designed and implemented using a 0.35 Î¼m CMOS technology, it occupies only an active area of 986Ã956 Î¼m2. The measurement results show that, at the power supply of 3.3/5.0 V and the sampling rate of 1 MS/s, the ADC with calibration has a signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SINAD) of 67.98 dB, the power dissipation of 5 mW, and a figure of merit (FOM) of 2.44 pJ/conv.-step. This ADC is with the features of high accuracy, low power and small layout area, it is especially suitable to the one-chip integration of the front-end readout electronics.\n\nFront-end receiver electronics for a matrix transducer for 3-D transesophageal echocardiography.\n\nPubMed\n\nYu, Zili; Blaak, Sandra; Chang, Zu-yao; Yao, Jiajian; Bosch, Johan G; Prins, Christian; LancÃ©e, Charles T; de Jong, Nico; Pertijs, Michiel A P; Meijer, Gerard C M\n\n2012-07-01\n\nThere is a clear clinical need for creating 3-D images of the heart. One promising technique is the use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). To enable 3-D TEE, we are developing a miniature ultrasound probe containing a matrix piezoelectric transducer with more than 2000 elements. Because a gastroscopic tube cannot accommodate the cables needed to connect all transducer elements directly to an imaging system, a major challenge is to locally reduce the number of channels, while maintaining a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. This can be achieved by using front-end receiver electronics bonded to the transducers to provide appropriate signal conditioning in the tip of the probe. This paper presents the design of such electronics, realizing time-gain compensation (TGC) and micro-beamforming using simple, low-power circuits. Prototypes of TGC amplifiers and micro-beamforming cells have been fabricated in 0.35-Î¼m CMOS technology. These prototype chips have been combined on a printed circuit board (PCB) to form an ultrasound-receiver system capable of reading and combining the signals of three transducer elements. Experimental results show that this design is a suitable candidate for 3-D TEE.\n\nPhotodetectors and front-end electronics for the LHCb RICH upgrade\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCassina, L.; LHCb RICH\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe RICH detectors of the LHCb experiment provide identification of hadrons produced in high energy proton-proton collisions in the LHC at CERN over a wide momentum range (2-100 GeV/c). Cherenkov light is collected on photon detector planes sensitive to single photons. The RICH will be upgraded (in 2019) to read out every bunch crossing, at a rate of 40 MHz. The current hybrid photon detectors (HPD) will be replaced with multi-anode photomultiplier tubes (customisations of the Hamamatsu R11265 and the H12699 MaPMTs). These 8Ã8 pixel devices meet the experimental requirements thanks to their small pixel size, high gain, negligible dark count rate (â¼50 Hz/cm2) and moderate cross-talk. The measured performance of several tubes is reported, together with their long-term stability. A new 8-channel front-end chip, named CLARO, has been designed in 0.35 Î¼m CMOS AMS technology for the MaPMT readout. The CLARO chip operates in binary mode and combines low power consumption (â¼1 mW/Ch), wide bandwidth (baseline restored in â©½ 25 ns) and radiation hardness. A 12-bit digital register permits the optimisation of the dynamic range and the threshold level for each channel and provides tools for the on-site calibration. The design choices and the characterization of the electronics are presented.\n\nConcepts for a Muon Accelerator Front-End\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nStratakis, Diktys; Berg, Scott; Neuffer, David\n\n2017-03-16\n\nWe present a muon capture front-end scheme for muon based applications. In this Front-End design, a proton bunch strikes a target and creates secondary pions that drift into a capture channel, decaying into muons. A series of rf cavities forms the resulting muon beams into a series of bunches of differerent energies, aligns the bunches to equal central energies, and initiates ionization cooling. We also discuss the design of a chicane system for the removal of unwanted secondary particles from the muon capture region and thus reduce activation of the machine. With the aid of numerical simulations we evaluate themoreÂ Â» performance of this Front-End scheme as well as study its sensitivity against key parameters such as the type of target, the number of rf cavities and the gas pressure of the channel.Â«Â less\n\nThe Parkes front-end controller and noise-adding radiometer\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBrunzie, T. J.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nA new front-end controller (FEC) was installed on the 64-m antenna in Parkes, Australia, to support the 1989 Voyager 2 Neptune encounter. The FEC was added to automate operation of the front-end microwave hardware as part of the Deep Space Network's Parkes-Canberra Telemetry Array. Much of the front-end hardware was refurbished and reimplemented from a front-end system installed in 1985 by the European Space Agency for the Uranus encounter; however, the FEC and its associated noise-adding radiometer (NAR) were new Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) designs. Project requirements and other factors led to the development of capabilities not found in standard Deep Space Network (DSN) controllers and radiometers. The Parkes FEC/NAR performed satisfactorily throughout the Neptune encounter and was removed in October 1989.\n\nThe DIRC front-end electronics chain for BaBar\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBailly, P.; Chauveau, J.; Del Buono, L.; Genat, J.

It mainly comprises of 64-channel DIRC Front-End Boards (DFB) equipped with eight full-custom Analog chips performing zero-cross discrimination with 2 mV threshold and pulse shaping, four full-custom Digital TDC chips for timing measurements with 500 ps binning and a readout logic selecting hits in the trigger window, and DIRC Crate Controller cards (DCC) serializing the data collected from up to 16 DFBs onto a 1.2 Gb/s optical link.

However, state-of-the-art detector systems require high-performance readout electronics. Though an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) is an adequate solution for the readout, requirements of high dynamic range and high throughput are not available in any commercial circuit. Consequently, the present study develops the analog front-end electronics with operational amplifiers for an 8Ã8 pixelated CZT detector. For this purpose, we modeled an electrical equivalent circuit of the CZT detector with the associated charge-sensitive amplifier (CSA). Based on a detailed network analysis, the circuit design is completed by numerical values for various features such as ballistic deficit, charge-to-voltage gain, rise time, and noise level. A verification of the performance is carried out by synthetic detector signals and a pixel detector. The experimental results with the pixel detector assembly and a 22Na radioactive source emphasize the depth dependence of the measured energy. After pulse processing with depth correction based on the fit of the weighting potential, the energy resolution is 2.2% (FWHM) for the 511 keV photopeak.\n\nAlign the Front End First.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPerry, Jim\n\n1995-01-01\n\nDiscussion of management styles and front-end analysis focuses on a review of Douglas McGregor's theories.

(LRW)\n\nA Front-End Electronics Prototype Based on Gigabit Ethernet for the ATLAS Small-Strip Thin Gap Chamber\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHu, Kun; Lu, Houbing; Wang, Xu; Li, Feng; Wang, Xinxin; Geng, Tianru; Yang, Hang; Liu, Shengquan; Han, Liang; Jin, Ge\n\n2017-06-01\n\nA front-end electronics prototype for the ATLAS small-strip Thin Gap Chamber (sTGC) based on gigabit Ethernet has been developed. The prototype is designed to read out signals of pads, wires, and strips of the sTGC detector. The prototype includes two VMM2 chips developed to read out the signals of the sTGC, a Xilinx Kintex-7 field-programmable gate array (FPGA) used for the VMM2 configuration and the events storage, and a gigabit Ethernet transceiver PHY chip for interfacing with a computer. The VMM2 chip is designed for the readout of the Micromegas detector and sTGC detector, which is composed of 64 linear front-end channels. Each channel integrates a charge-sensitive amplifier, a shaper, several analog-to-digital converters, and other digital functions. For a bunch-crossing interval of 25 ns, events are continuously read out by the FPGA and forwarded to the computer. The interface between the computer and the prototype has been measured to reach an error-free rate of 900 Mb/s, therefore making a very effective use of the available bandwidth. Additionally, the computer can control several prototypes of this kind simultaneously via the Ethernet interface. At present, the prototype will be used for the sTGC performance test. The features of the prototype are described in detail.\n\nReviewed approach to defining the Active Interlock Envelope for Front End ray tracing\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSeletskiy, S.; Shaftan, T.\n\nTo protect the NSLS-II Storage Ring (SR) components from damage from synchrotron radiation produced by insertion devices (IDs) the Active Interlock (AI) keeps electron beam within some safe envelope (a.k.a Active Interlock Envelope or AIE) in the transverse phase space. The beamline Front Ends (FEs) are designed under assumption that above certain beam current (typically 2 mA) the ID synchrotron radiation (IDSR) fan is produced by the interlocked e-beam. These assumptions also define how the ray tracing for FE is done. To simplify the FE ray tracing for typical uncanted ID it was decided to provide the Mechanical Engineering groupmoreÂ Â» with a single set of numbers (x,xâ,y,yâ) for the AIE at the center of the long (or short) ID straight section. Such unified approach to the design of the beamline Front Ends will accelerate the design process and save valuable human resources. In this paper we describe our new approach to defining the AI envelope and provide the resulting numbers required for design of the typical Front End.Â«Â less\n\nFront-end electronics for PWO-based PHOS calorimeter of ALICE\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMuller, Hans; Budnikov, Dmitry; Ippolitov, Mikhail; Li, Qingxia; Manko, Vladislav; Pimenta, Rui; Rohrich, Dieter; Sibiryak, Iouri; Skaali, Bernhard; Vinogradov, Alexandre\n\n2006-11-01\n\nThe electromagnetic Photon Spectrometer (PHOS) of ALICE consists of five modules with 56Ã64 PWO crystals, operated at -25 Â°C. Glued to each crystal are APD diodes which amplify a lightyield of 4.4 photoelectrons/MeV, followed by charge-sensitive pre-amplifiers with a charge conversion gain of ca. 1 V/pC. We describe our new 32-channel shaper/digitizer and readout electronics for gain-programmable photodiodes. These Front-End Electronics (FEE) cards are installed below the crystals in an isolated warm volume in geometrical correspondence to 2Ã16 crystal rows per card. With a total detector capacitance of 100 pF and a noise level of 3 MeV, the FEEs cover a 14 bit dynamic range from 5 MeV to 80 GeV. The low noise level is achieved by operating the APDs and preamplifiers at low temperature and by applying a relatively long shaping time of 1 Î¼s. The offline timing resolution, obtained via a Gamma-2 fit is less than 2 ns. The second-order, dual-gain shapers produce semi-Gaussian output for 10 bit ADCs with embedded multi-event buffers. A Readout Control Unit (RCU) masters data readout with address-mapped access to the event-buffers and controls registers via a custom bus which interconnects up to 14 FEE cards. Programmable bias voltage controllers on the FEE cards allow for very precise gain adjustment of each individual APD. Being co-designed with the TRU trigger cards, each FEE card generates eight fast signal sums (2Ã2 crystals) as input to the TRU. FPGA-based algorithms generate level-0 and level-1 trigger decisions at 40 MHz and allow PHOS also to operate in self-triggered mode. Inside each PHOS module there are 112 FEE and 8 TRU cards which dissipate ca. 1 kW heat which is extracted via a water cooling system.\n\nREACH: a high-performance wireless base station front end\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNettleton, Ray W.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nThe link budget determines the relationships between range, capacity and transmitted power for any wireless technology. In every case it is a key determinant of the system's performance from both an engineering and an economic point of view. Unfortunately, the new 1.9 GHz PCS systems will begin life with an inherent 7 dB disadvantage over the 800 MHz cellular due to propagation differences. Additionally, system wiring and electronics often degrade performance by a further 5 to 10 dB due to long coaxial runs and noisy front end amplification, both of which are harder issues to deal with at 1.9 GHz than at 800 MHz. SCT's REACHTM products address these shortcomings by packaging critical components--front end amplification, filtering, etc.--in a compact cryoelectronic package intended for mounting near the antennas of the base station. In a recent trial with Qualcomm in San Diego, this package improved the CDMA uplink budget by 6 dB--enough to halve the number of base stations that are needed in most areas. This paper examines the technical and economic ramifications of the REACHTM product.\n\nFront-End Analysis Cornerstone of Logistics\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNager, Paul J.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThe presentation provides an overview of Front-End Logistics Support Analysis (FELSA), when it should be performed, benefits of performing FELSA and why it should be performed, how it is conducted, and examples.\n\nMotivation and Front-End Analysis.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHarless, Joe\n\n1978-01-01\n\nRelates Front-End Analysis (FEA) to motivation by categorizing it as either Diagnostic FEA or Planning FEA.

A.; Gil, A.; Gonzalez-Diaz, D.; Koenig, W.; Traxler, M.; Zapata, M.\n\n2009-05-01\n\nA Front-End Electronics (FEE) chain for timing accurate measurements has been developed for the RPC wall upgrade of the High-Acceptance DiElectron Spectrometer (HADES). The wall will cover an area of around 8 m with 1122 RPC cells (2244 electronic channels). The FEE chain consists of two boards: a four-channel DaughterBOard (DBO) and a 32-channel MotherBOard (MBO). The DBO uses a fast 2 GHz amplifier feeding a discriminator. The time and the charge information are encoded in the leading and the trailing edge (by a charge to width method) of an LVDS signal. Each MBO houses up to eight DBOs providing them regulated voltage supply, threshold values via DACs, test signals and collection of their trigger outputs. The MBO delivers LVDS signals to a time-to-digital converter readout board (TRB) based on HPTDC for data acquisition. In this work, we present the performance of the FEE measured using: (a) narrow electronic test pulses and (b) real signals read out in a fully instrumented RPC sextant installed in its final position at the HADES. The detector was exposed to particles coming from reactions of a 12C beam on Be and Nb targets at 2 GeV/A kinetic energy. Results for the whole electronic chain (DBO+MBO+TRB) show a timing jitter of around 40 ps/channel for pulses above 100 fC and 80 ps/channel for beam data taken with the RPC.\n\nAn 8.4-GHz dual-maser front-end system for Parkes reimplementation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTrowbridge, D.

The front-end system was originally assembled by the European Space Agency and installed on the Parkes antenna for the Giotto project. It was also used on a time-sharing basis by the Deep Space Network as part of the Parkes Canberra Telemetry Array to enhance the data return from the Voyager Uranus encounter. At the conclusion of these projects in 1986, part of the system was then shipped to JPL on loan for reimplementation at Parkes for the Voyager Neptune encounter. New design and implementation required to make the system operable at Parkes included new microwave front-end control cabinets, closed-cycle refrigeration monitor system, noise-adding radiometer system, front-end controller assembly, X81 local oscillator multiplier, and refurbishment of the original dual 8.4-GHz traveling-wave masers and waveguide feed system. The front-end system met all requirements during the encounter and was disassembled in October 1989 and returned to JPL.\n\nIonization Readout Electronics for SuperCDMS SNOLAB Employing a HEMT Front-End\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPartridge, R.\n\n2014-09-01\n\nThe SuperCDMS SNOLAB experiment seeks to deploy 200 kg of cryogenic Ge detectors employing phonon and ionization readout to identify dark matter interactions. One of the design challenges for the experiment is to provide amplification of the high impedance ionization signal while minimizing power dissipation and noise. This paper describes the design and expected performance of the ionization readout being developed for an engineering model of the SuperCDMS SNOLAB Ge Tower System. The readout features the use of a low-noise HEMT front end transistor operating at 4 K to achieve a power dissipation of 100 W per channel, local grounding to minimize noise injection, and biasing circuitry that allows precise control of the HEMT operating point.\n\nFERMI: a digital Front End and Readout MIcrosystem for high resolution calorimetry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAlexanian, H.; Appelquist, G.; Bailly, P.; Benetta, R.; Berglund, S.; Bezamat, J.; Blouzon, F.; Bohm, C.; Breveglieri, L.; Brigati, S.; Cattaneo, P.

It is based on analogue signal compression, high speed {A}/{D} converters, a fully programmable pipeline and a digital signal processing (DSP) chain with local intelligence and system supervision. This digital solution is aimed at providing maximal front-end processing power by performing waveform analysis using DSP methods. For the system integration of the multichannel device a multi-chip, silicon-on-silicon multi-chip module (MCM) has been adopted. This solution allows a high level of integration of complex analogue and digital functions, with excellent flexibility in mixing technologies for the different functional blocks. This type of multichip integration provides a high degree of reliability and programmability at both the function and the system level, with the additional possibility of customising the microsystem to detector-specific requirements. For enhanced reliability in high radiation environments, fault tolerance strategies, i.e. redundancy, reconfigurability, majority voting and coding for error detection and correction, are integrated into the design.\n\nFront-End/Gateway Software: Availability and Usefulness.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKesselman, Martin\n\n1985-01-01\n\nReviews features of front-end software packages (interface between user and online system)--database selection, search strategy development, saving and downloading, hardware and software requirements, training and documentation, online systems and database accession, and costs--and discusses gateway services (user searches through intermediaryâ¦\n\nSystem-level considerations for the front-end readout ASIC in the CBM experiment from the power supply perspective\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKasinski, K.; Koczon, P.; Ayet, S.; LÃ¶chner, S.; Schmidt, C. J.\n\n2017-03-01\n\nNew fixed target experiments using high intensity beams with energy up to 10 AGeV from the SIS100 synchrotron presently being constructed at FAIR/GSI are under preparation. Most of the readout electronics and power supplies are expected to be exposed to a very high flux of nuclear reaction products and have to be radiation tolerant up to 3 MRad (TID) and sustain up to 1014/cm2 of 1 MeV neutron equivalent in their life time. Moreover, the mostly minimum ionising particles under investigation leave very little signal in the sensors. Therefore very low noise level amplitude measurements are required by the front-end electronics for effective tracking. Sensor and interconnecting micro-cable capacitance and series resistance in conjunction with intrinsic noise of the charge sensitive amplifier are dominant noise sources in the system. However, the single-ended architecture of the amplifiers employed for the charge processing channels implies a potential problem with noise contributions from power supply sources. Strict system-level constraints leave very little freedom in selecting a power supply structure optimal with respect to: power efficiency, cooling capabilities and power density on modules, but also noise injection to the front-end via the power supply lines. Design of the power supply and distribution system of the Silicon Tracking System in the CBM experiment together with details on the front-end ASICs (STS -XYTER2) and measurement results of power supply and conditioning electronics (selected DC/DC converter and LDO regulators) are presented.\n\nPerformance of the Low-Jitter High-Gain/Bandwidth Front-End Electronics of the HADES tRPC Wall\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBelver, Daniel; Cabanelas, P.; Castro, E.; Garzon, J. A.; Gil, A.; Gonzalez-Diaz, D.; Koenig, W.; Traxler, M.\n\n2010-10-01\n\nA front-end electronics (FEE) chain for accurate time measurements has been developed for the new Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC)-based Time-of-Flight (TOF) wall of the High Acceptance Di-Electron Spectrometer (HADES). The wall covers an area of around 8 m2, divided in 6 sectors. In total, 1122 4-gap timing RPC cells are read-out by 2244 time and charge sensitive channels. The FEE chain consists of 2 custom-made boards: a 4-channel DaughterBOard (DBO) and a 32-channel MotherBOard (MBO). The DBO uses a fast 2 GHz amplifier feeding a dual high-speed discriminator. The time and charge information are encoded, respectively, in the leading edge and the width of an LVDS signal. Each MBO houses up to 8 DBOs providing them regulated voltage supply, threshold values via DACs, test signals and, additionally, routing out a signal proportional to the channel multiplicity needed for a 1st level trigger decision. The MBO delivers LVDS signals to a multi-purpose Trigger Readout Board (TRB) for data acquisition. The FEE allows achieving a system resolution around 75 ps fulfilling comfortably the requirements of the HADES upgrade .\n\n40 CFR 63.487 - Batch front-end process vents-reference control technology.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2012 CFR\n\n2012-07-01\n\n...-reference control technology. 63.487 Section 63.487 Protection of Environment ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION...

E.; Cazes, A.; Hess, M.; de La Taille, C.; Martin-Chassard, G.; Raux, L.; Repellin, J. P.\n\n2004-04-01\n\nMulti-anode photomultipliers H7546 are used to readout signal from the OPERA Scintillator Tracker (CERN/SPSC 2000-028, SPSC/P318, LNGSP 25/2000; CERN/SPSC 2001-025, SPSC/M668, LNGS-EXP30/2001). A 32-channel front-end Read Out Chip prototype accommodating the H7546 has been designed at LAL. This device features a low-noise, variable gain preamplifier to correct for multi-anode non-uniformity, an auto-trigger capability 100% efficient at a 0.3 photo-electron, and a charge measurement extending over a large dynamic range [0-100] photo-electrons. In this article we describe the ASIC architecture that is being implemented for the Target Tracker in OPERA, with a special emphasis put on the designs and the measured performance.\n\nFront-End Board with Cyclone V as a Test High-Resolution Platform for the Auger_Beyond_2015 Front End Electronics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSzadkowski, Zbigniew\n\n2015-06-01\n\nThe surface detector (SD) array of the Pierre Auger Observatory needs an upgrade which allows space for more complex triggers with higher bandwidth and greater dynamic range. To this end this paper presents a front-end board (FEB) with the largest Cyclone V E FPGA 5CEFA9F31I7N. It supports eight channels sampled with max. 250 MSps@14-bit resolution. Considered sampling for the SD is 120 MSps; however, the FEB has been developed with external anti-aliasing filters to retain maximal flexibility. Six channels are targeted at the SD, two are reserved for other experiments like: Auger Engineering Radio Array and additional muon counters. The FEB is an intermed"
