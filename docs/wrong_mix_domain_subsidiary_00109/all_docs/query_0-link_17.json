        "text": "The paper focuses on creating an internet security awareness training program for use by students at the Metropolitan State University of Denver. The discussion begins with analyzing the best practices of the current security programs. Also, the paper outlines some of the challenges of creating the training program for the university's students.\n\nDownload\n\nInternational Journal for Research in Applied Science and Engineering Technology (IJRASET), 2022\n\nWe know that many e-learning institutions are rushing into adopting ICT without carefully planning and understanding any related security concerns. E-learning is a new method of learning which ultimately depends on the Internet in its execution. The Internet has become the venue for a new set of illegal activities, and the e-learning environment is now exposed to such threats. In this paper, e-learning context, definition, characteristics, development, growth, benefits and challenges are all elaborated upon. This paper discusses the security elements required to be implemented within e-learning environments. In addition, the paper explains the situation and existing research relating to security in e-learning. Furthermore, information security management is suggested to contribute to preparing a secured e-learning environment.\n\nDownload"
