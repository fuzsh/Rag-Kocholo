H.; Liao, Z.; Xu, C.; Gauquelin, N.; Yin, C.; Aarts, J.; van der Molen, S. J.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe two-dimensional electron gas occurring between the band insulators SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 continues to attract considerable interest, due to the possibility of dynamic control over the carrier density and due to ensuing phenomena such as magnetism and superconductivity. The formation of this conducting interface is sensitive to the growth conditions, but despite numerous investigations there are still questions about the details of the physics involved. In particular, not much is known about the electronic structure of the growing LaAlO3 layer at the growth temperature (around 800Â°C) in oxygen (pressure around 5 Ã10-5 mbar), since analysis techniques at these conditions are not readily available. We developed a pulsed laser deposition system inside a low-energy electron microscope in order to study this issue. The setup allows for layer-by-layer growth control and in situ measurements of the angle-dependent electron reflection intensity, which can be used as a fingerprint of the electronic structure of the surface layers during growth. By using different substrate terminations and growth conditions we observe two families of reflectivity maps, which we can connect either to samples with an AlO2-rich surface and a conducting interface or to samples with a LaO-rich surface and an insulating interface. Our observations emphasize that substrate termination and stoichiometry determine the electronic structure of the growing layer, and thereby the conductance of the interface.\n\nElectron confinement at diffuse ZnMgO/ZnO interfaces\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaddison L. Coke\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Abrupt interfaces between ZnMgO and ZnO are strained due to lattice mismatch. This strain is relaxed if there is a gradual incorporation of Mg during growth, resulting in a diffuse interface. This strain relaxation is however accompanied by reduced confinement and enhanced Mg-ion scattering of the confined electrons at the interface. Here we experimentally study the electronic transport properties of the diffuse heteroepitaxial interface between single-crystal ZnO and ZnMgO films grown by molecular-beam epitaxy. The spatial extent of the interface region is controlled during growth by varying the zinc flux. We show that, as the spatial extent of the graded interface is reduced, the enhancement of electron mobility due to electron confinement more than compensates for any suppression of mobility due to increased strain. Furthermore, we determine the extent to which scattering of impurities in the ZnO substrate limits the electron mobility in diffuse ZnMgOâZnO interfaces.\n\nElectron confinement at diffuse ZnMgO/ZnO interfaces\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCoke, Maddison L.; Kennedy, Oscar W.; Sagar, James T.; Warburton, Paul A.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAbrupt interfaces between ZnMgO and ZnO are strained due to lattice mismatch.

In order to make clear that the transition mechanism of c-BN single crystals, the variation of B and N atomic hybrid states in the growth interface is analyzed with the help of auger electron spectroscopy in the Li-based system. It is found that the sp2 fractions of B and N atoms decreases, and their sp3 fractions increases from the outer to the inner in the growth interface. In addition, Lithium nitride (Li3N) are not found in the growth interface by X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiment. It is suggested that lithium boron nitride (Li3BN2) is produced by the reaction of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and Li3N at the first step, and then B and N atoms transform from sp2 into sp3 state with the catalysis of Li3BN2 in c-BN single crystals synthesis process.\n\nInterface-mediated amorphization of coesite by 200 keV electron irradiation\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGong, W.L.; Wang, L.M.; Ewing, R.C.; Xie, H.S.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nElectron-induced amorphization of coesite was studied as a function of irradiation temperature by in situ transmission electron microscopy at an incident energy of 200 keV. Electron-induced amorphization of coesite is induced by an ionization mechanism and is mainly dominated by an interface-mediated, heterogeneous nucleation-and-growth controlled process. Amorphous domains nucleate at surfaces, crystalline-amorphous (c-a) interfaces, and grain boundaries. This is the same process as the interface-mediated vitrification of coesite by isothermal annealing above the thermodynamic melting temperature (875 K), but below the glass transition temperature (1480 K). The interface-mediated amorphization of coesite by electron irradiation is morphologically similar to interface-mediated thermodynamic melting. copyright 1997 American Institute of Physics\n\nOverlayer growth and electronic properties of the Bi/GaSb(110) interface\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGavioli, Luca; Betti, Maria Grazia; Casarini, Paolo; Mariani, Carlo\n\n1995-06-01\n\nThe overlayer growth and electronic properties of the Bi/GaSb(110) interface and of the two-dimensional ordered (1Ã1)- and (1Ã2)-Bi layers have been investigated by complementary spectroscopic techniques (high-resolution electron-energy-loss, photoemission, and Auger spectroscopy). Bismuth forms an epitaxial monolayer, followed by island formation (Stranski-Krastanov growth mode) covering an average surface area of 40% at a nominal coverage of 4 ML. The (1Ã2)-symmetry stable structural phase, obtained after annealing at ~220 Â°C, corresponds to an average nominal Bi coverage of about 0.7 ML, suggesting an atomic geometry different from the epitaxial-continued layer structure. The disposal of Bi atoms in the (1Ã2) structure should build up an ``open'' layer, as the Ga-related surface exciton quenched in the (1Ã1) epitaxial monolayer is present in the (1Ã2) stable phase. The two symmetry phases are characterized by strong absorption features at 1 eV [(1Ã1)-Bi] and 0.54 eV [(1Ã2)-Bi], related to interband electronic transitions between Bi-induced electronic states. The major Bi-related occupied electronic levels, present in the valence band of the (1Ã1)- and (1Ã2)-Bi layer, have been detected by angle-integrated ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy. Both the (1Ã1) and (1Ã2) phases show a metallic nature, with a low density of electronic states at the Fermi level. Schottky barrier heights of 0.20 and 0.14 eV are estimated for the epitaxial (1Ã1)- and (1Ã2)-symmetry stage, respectively, by analyzing the space-charge layer conditions through the study of the dopant-induced free-carrier plasmon in the GaSb substrate.\n\nInterface electron structure of Fe3Al/TiC composites\n\nInstitute of Scientific and Technical Information of China (English)\n\nPANG Lai-xue; SUN Kang-ning; SUN Jia-tao; FAN Run-hua; REN Shuai\n\n2006-01-01\n\nBased on YU's solids and molecules emperical electron theory(EET), interface valence electron structure of TiC-Fe3Al composites was set up, and the valence electron density of different atomic states TiC and Fe3Al composites in various planes was determined. The results indicate that the electron density of (100)Fe3Al is consistent with that of (110)TiC in the first-class approximation, the absolute value of minimum electron density difference along the interface is 0.007 37 nm-2, and the relative value is 0.759%. (110)TiC//(100)Fe3Al preferred orientation is believed to benefit the formation of the cuboidal shape TiC. In the other hand, it shows that the particle growth is accompanied by the transport of electron, the deviation continuity of electron density intrinsically hinders the grain growth. The electron density of (100)TiC is not consistent with Fe3Al arbitrary crystallographic plane,thus it well explains that the increased titanium and carbon contents do not increase the size of large particles. The crystallographic orientation of (110)TiC//(100)FeAl will improve the mechanical properties. Therefore interface electron theory is an effective theoretical implement for designing excellent property of composites.\n\nGrowth parameter optimization and interface treatment for enhanced electron mobility in heavily strained GaInAs/AlInAs high electron mobility transistor structures\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFedoryshyn, Yuriy; Ostinelli, Olivier; Alt, Andreas; Pallin, Angel; Bolognesi, Colombo R.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe optimization of heavily strained Ga 0.25 In 0.75 As/Al 0.48 In 0.52 As high electron mobility transistor structures is discussed in detail.

Structures composed of an 11ânm thick channel layer and a 4ânm thick spacer layer exhibited electron mobilities as high as 15â100 cm 2 /Vs and 70â000 cm 2 /Vs at 300 and 77âK, respectively, for channels including InAs strained layers.

The incoherency arises due to incompatibility of growth and elastic distortion tensors at the interface. The incoherent interface therefore acts as an additional source of internal stress besides allowing for rich growth kinematics. All the biochemicals in the model are essentially represented in terms of nutrient concentration fields, in the bulk and at the interface. A nutrient balance law is postulated which, combined with mechanical balances and kinetic laws, yields an initial-boundary-value problem coupling the evolution of bulk and interfacial growth, on the one hand, and the evolution of growth and nutrient concentration on the other. The problem is solved, and discussed in detail, for two distinct examples: annual ring formation during tree growth and healing of cutaneous wounds in animals.\n\nAdvanced understanding on electronic structure of molecular semiconductors and their interfaces\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAkaike, Kouki\n\n2018-03-01\n\nUnderstanding the electronic structure of organic semiconductors and their interfaces is critical to optimizing functionalities for electronics applications, by rational chemical design and appropriate combination of device constituents. The unique electronic structure of a molecular solid is characterized as (i) anisotropic electrostatic fields that originate from molecular quadrupoles, (ii) interfacial energy-level lineup governed by simple electrostatics, and (iii) weak intermolecular interactions that make not only structural order but also energy distributions of the frontier orbitals sensitive to atmosphere and interface growth. This article shows an overview on these features with reference to the improved understanding of the orientation-dependent electronic structure, comprehensive mechanisms of molecular doping, and energy-level alignment. Furthermore, the engineering of ionization energy by the control of the electrostatic fields and work function of practical electrodes by contact-induced doping is briefly described for the purpose of highlighting how the electronic structure impacts the performance of organic devices.\n\nElectronic structure of semiconductor interfaces\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nHerman, F\n\n1983-02-01\n\nThe study of semiconductor interfaces is one of the most active and exciting areas of current semiconductor research.

The issues addressed in this research program are important for basic science, because the behavior of correlated electron superlattices is a crucial challenge to and crucial test of our understanding of the grand-challenge problem of correlated electron physics and are important for our nation's energy future because correlated interfaces offer opportunities for the control of phenomena needed for energy and device applications.

Two main electron traps have been revealed with activation energies at 0.16 eV and 0.52 eV from the conduction band. Inhomogeneous spatial distributions of the traps, obtained by DLTS profiling, indicate that they are agglomerated at the interrupted interface on a concentration level of (2-3) x 10 15 cm -3 at their maximum. Their behaviour is typical of acceptor-like traps when investigating by C-V profiling as a function of temperature. Based on a comparison made with electron traps in MBE-GaAs as well as with the traps in InAs/GaAs quantum dot/quantum well (QD/QW) structures, we conclude they are the well-known EL10 and EL4 defects, respectively, and their concentrations are growth condition dependent.

As advanced gigascale electronic devices continue to shrink, the stability of these interfaces is becoming an increasingly important issue that has a profound impact on the operational reliability of these devices. In this book, the authors present the basic science underlying Â the thermal and electrical stability of metal-dielectric interfaces and its relationship to the operation of advanced interconnect systems in gigascale electronics. Interface phenomena, including chemical reactions between metals and dielectrics, metallic-atom diffusion, and ion drift, are discussed based on fundamental physical and chemical principles. Schematic diagrams are provided throughout the book to illustrate Â interface phenomena and the principles that govern them.

[Univ. of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA (United States)\n\n2015-02-23\n\nFinal Report to the Department of Energy for period 6/1/2000 to 11/30/2014 for Grant # DE-FG02-00ER45813-A000 to the University of Pennsylvania Local Electronic And Dielectric Properties at Nanosized Interfaces PI: Dawn Bonnell The behavior of grain boundaries and interfaces has been a focus of fundamental research for decades because variations of structure and composition at interfaces dictate mechanical, electrical, optical and dielectric properties in solids. Similarly, the consequence of atomic and electronic structures of surfaces to chemical and physical interactions are critical due to their implications to catalysis and device fabrication. Increasing fundamental understanding of surfaces and interfaces has materially advanced technologies that directly bear on energy considerations. Currently, exciting developments in materials processing are enabling creative new electrical, optical and chemical device configurations. Controlled synthesis of nanoparticles, semiconducting nanowires and nanorods, optical quantum dots, etc. along with a range of strategies for assembling and patterning nanostructures portend the viability of new devices that have the potential to significantly impact the energy landscape. As devices become smaller the impact of interfaces and surfaces grows geometrically. As with other nanoscale phenomena, small interfaces do not exhibit the same properties as do large interfaces. The size dependence of interface properties had not been explored and understanding at the most fundamental level is necessary to the advancement of nanostructured devices. An equally important factor in the behavior of interfaces in devices is the ability to examine the interfaces under realistic conditions. For example, interfaces and boundaries dictate the behavior of oxide fuel cells which operate at extremely high temperatures in dynamic high pressure chemical environments. These conditions preclude the characterization of local properties during fuel cell\n\nOrganic/metal interfaces. Electronic and structural properties\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nDuhm, Steffen\n\n2008-07-17\n\nThis work addresses several important topics of the field of organic electronics. The focus lies on organic/metal interfaces, which exist in all organic electronic devices. Physical properties of such interfaces are crucial for device performance. Four main topics have been covered: (i) the impact of molecular orientation on the energy levels, (ii) energy level tuning with strong electron acceptors, (iii) the role of thermodynamic equilibrium at organic/ organic homo-interfaces and (iv) the correlation of interfacial electronic structure and bonding distance. To address these issues a broad experimental approach was necessary: mainly ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy was used, supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, metastable atom electron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray standing waves, to examine vacuum sublimed thin films of conjugated organic molecules (COMs) in ultrahigh vacuum. (i) A novel approach is presented to explain the phenomenon that the ionization energy in molecular assemblies is orientation dependent. It is demonstrated that this is due to a macroscopic impact of intramolecular dipoles on the ionization energy in molecular assemblies. Furthermore, the correlation of molecular orientation and conformation has been studied in detail for COMs on various substrates. (ii) A new approach was developed to tune hole injection barriers ({delta}{sub h}) at organic/metal interfaces by adsorbing a (sub-) monolayer of an organic electron acceptor on the metal electrode. Charge transfer from the metal to the acceptor leads to a chemisorbed layer, which reduces {delta}{sub h} to the COM overlayer. This concept was tested with three acceptors and a lowering of {delta}{sub h} of up to 1.2 eV could be observed. (iii) A transition from vacuum-level alignment to molecular level pinning at the homo-interface between a lying monolayer and standing multilayers of a COM was observed, which depended on the amount of a pre-deposited acceptor.

KBr deposition does not strongly perturb the crystallographic structure of the InSb surface and the electronic structure of the substrate also remains unaffected by the overlayer. A simple model of the studied system is proposed, in which a thin KBr layer is treated as a dielectric film, modifying potential barrier for the electrons tunneling to/from the InSb substrate. Apparent step heights on the KBr film, measured using scanning tunneling microscope (STM), agree well with the predictions of the model and the atomically-resolved STM images show the structure of the InSb-KBr interface. Our results demonstrate that STM may be used as a tool for investigations of the semiconductorâinsulator interfaces.\n\nInterface failure by cavity growth to coalescence\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nTvergaard, Viggo\n\n2000-01-01\n\nFor a thin metal layer between ceramics ductile failure by the growth of voids along one of the interfaces is studied numerically.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging at the interface reveals a change from 'layer+island' to \"island\" growth mode with increasing substrate temperatures, further confirmed by probing the buried interfaces using X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and positron annihilation spectroscopic (PAS) techniques. PAS depth profiling provides insight into the details of molecular ordering while positron lifetime measurements reveal the difference in packing modes of CuPc molecules at the interface. XRR measurements show systematic increase in interface width and electron density correlating well with the change from layer + island to coalesced huge 3D islands at higher substrate temperatures. Study demonstrates the usefulness of XRR and PAS techniques to study growth modes at buried interfaces and reveals the influence of growth modes of semiconductor at the interface on hole and electron trap concentrations individually, thereby affecting hysteresis and threshold voltage stability. Minimum hole trapping is correlated to near layer by layer formation close to the interface at 100 Â°C and maximum to the island formation with large voids between the grains at 225 Â°C.\n\nEffect of residual stresses on interface crack growth by void expansion mechanism\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nTvergaard, Viggo\n\n2006-01-01\n\nCrack growth along an interface between two adjacent elastic-plastic materials in a layered solid is analysed, using special interface elements to represent the fracture process ahead of the crack-tip.

S.; Walke, A.; Favia, P.; Douhard, B.; Lu, W.; del Alamo, J. A.; Collaert, N.; Merckling, C.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nIn this work, we report on the growth of pseudomorphic and highly doped InAs(Si)/GaSb(Si) heterostructures on p-type (0 0 1)-oriented GaSb substrate and the fabrication and characterization of n+/p+ Esaki tunneling diodes. We particularly study the influence of the Molecular Beam Epitaxy shutter sequences on the structural and electrical characteristics of InAs(Si)/GaSb(Si) Esaki diodes structures. We use real time Reflection High Electron Diffraction analysis to monitor different interface stoichiometry at the tunneling interface. With Atomic Force Microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Transmission Electron Microscopy analyses, we demonstrate that an \"InSb-like\" interface leads to a sharp and defect-free interface exhibiting high quality InAs(Si) crystal growth contrary to the \"GaAs-like\" one. We then prove by means of Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy profiles that Si-diffusion at the interface allows the growth of highly Si-doped InAs/GaSb diodes without any III-V material deterioration. Finally, simulations are conducted to explain our electrical results where a high Band to Band Tunneling (BTBT) peak current density of Jp = 8 mA/Î¼m2 is achieved.\n\nSubcritical crack growth along polymer interfaces\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGurumurthy, Charavana Kumara\n\n2000-10-01\n\nThe adhesion characteristics have been investigated for a polyimide (PI)/model epoxy (ME) interface that is important for microelectronic applications. The fracture toughness (G*c) of this interface has been measured using an asymmetric double cantilever beam (ADCB) technique. The G*c is low, 10-25 J/m 2, and is sensitive to the mechanical phase angle psi. A modified ADCB setup has been used to measure the subcritical crack growth velocity v due to the stress-assisted water attack (SAWA) at various relative humidities (RH) and temperatures (T) as a function of its driving force (the strain energy release rate) G*. The threshold G* decreases remarkably. Above the threshold log v rises linearly with â G* (a hydrolysis controlled regime) but then enters a regime where the crack velocity is almost independent of âG*, i.e., v = v* (a transport controlled regime). A model for SAWA has been developed based on thermally-activated kinetics for hydrolysis of the ester covalent bonds that bridge from one side to the other of the interface. A new technique has been developed for the determination of the fatigue crack growth under thermal (T) and hydro-thermal (HT) conditions as a function of the range in the strain energy release rate (DeltaG). Under T-fatigue, the fatigue crack growth per unit temperature cycle (da/dN) increases as a power of DeltaG, i.e., a Paris law relationship holds. The HT da/dN measured is higher than da/dN under T-fatigue conditions and has been successfully modeled as a summation of two components: (a) the da/dN due to T-fatigue and (b) the da/dN due to the SAWA along the interface for a given T-cycle. A surface modification procedure that converts a thin interpenetrated by a solvent cast ME is used to strengthen ME/PI interface. The G* c increases with the interpenetration distance w. Increasing w also improves the resistance of the PI/ME interface to SAWA with the threshold G* increasing and the water transport controlled velocity (v\n\nRoom temperature formation of high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases at crystalline complex oxide interfaces\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nChen, Yunzhong; Bovet, N.; Kasama, Takeshi\n\n2014-01-01\n\nWell-controlled sub-unit-cell layer-bylayer epitaxial growth of spinel alumina is achieved at room temperature on a TiO2-terminated SrTiO3 single-crystalline substrate.

The (2 x 1) reconstruction of the 6H-SiC(0001) surface has been obtained by cleaving the sample along the (0001) direction. This reconstruction has not been observed up to now for this compound, and has been compared with those of similar elemental semiconductors of the fourth group of the periodic table. This comparison has been carried out by making use of photoemission spectroscopy, analyzing the core level shifts of both Si 2p and C 1s core levels in terms of charge transfer between atoms of both elements and in different chemical environments. From this comparison, a difference between the reconstruction on the Si-terminated and the C-terminated surface was established, due to the ionic nature of the Si-C bond. The growth of manganese films on Si(111) in the 1-5 ML thickness range has been studied by means of LEED, STM and photoemission spectroscopy. By the complementary use of these surface science techniques, two different phases have been observed for two thickness regimes (<1 ML and >1 ML), which exhibit a different electronic character. The two reconstructions, the (1 x 1)-phase and the ({radical}3 x {radical}3)R30 -phase, are due to silicide formation, as observed in core level spectroscopy. The growth proceeds via island formation in the monolayer regime, while the thicker films show flat layers interrupted by deep holes. On the basis of STM investigations, this growth mode has been attributed to strain due to lattice mismatch between the substrate and the silicide. Co-deposition of Al and Mg onto a Si(111) substrate at low temperature (100K) resulted in the formation of thin alloy films. By varying the relative content of both elements, the thin films exhibited different electronic properties\n\nSolid-melt interface structure and growth of Cu alloy single crystals\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTomimitsu, Hiroshi; Kamada, Kohji.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nCrystal-melt interface behavior during the growth of Cu-base solid solutions by the Bridgman method is discussed on the basis of experimental evidence obtained by neutron diffraction topography. Advantages of neutron diffraction topography for the characterization of large single crystals, such as dealt with in this paper, are emphasized. Evidence was odserved of extremely regular crystal growth along directions, irrespective of the macroscopic growth direction. This contrasts with the previously believed (110) normal growth which is a conclusion of growth theory based on molecular kinetics at the solid-melt interface. In consequence, we believe that the kinetics at the interface is a minor factor in the meltgrowth of metal single crystals. Revised melt-growth theory should include both the growth and the formation of the regular structure as evidenced by neutron diffraction topography.

M.\n\n1990-06-01\n\nThe atomic structures of the Î³/Î±2 and Î³/Î³T interfaces in a TiAl alloy were investigated using conventional and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in order to understand the growth mechanisms and deformation behavior of the two-phase alloy. The results show that the Î±2 plates grow from the Î³ phase by the migration of a/6 partial dislocation ledges across the faces and that the Î³/Î±2 interface usually contains closely spaced arrays of interfacial dislocations. Deformation twins cut through both Î³ twin boundaries and Î±2 plates during deformation, although slip of twinning c slocations through Î±2 appears to be a difficult process. Both the Î³/Î±2 and Î³/Î³T interfaces can be imaged and modeled at the atomic level, although slight crystal and/or beam tilt can complicate image interpretation.\n\nElectronic structure imperfections and chemical bonding at graphene interfaces\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSchultz, Brian Joseph\n\nThe manifestation of novel phenomena upon scaling to finite size has inspired a paradigm shift in materials science that takes advantage of the distinctive electrical and physical properties of nanomaterials. Remarkably, the simple honeycomb arrangement of carbon atoms in a single atomic layer has become renowned for exhibiting never-before-seen electronic and physical phenomena. This archetypal 2-dimensional nanomaterial is known as graphene, a single layer of graphite. Early reports in the 1950's eluded to graphene-like nanostructures that were evidenced from exfoliation of oxidized graphite followed by chemical reduction, absorbed carbon on transition metals, and thermal decomposition of SiC. Furthermore, the earliest tight binding approximation calculations in the 1950's held clues that a single-layer of graphite would behave drastically different than bulk graphite. Not until 2004, when Giem and Novoselov first synthesized graphene by mechanical exfoliation from highly-oriented pyrolytic graphite did the field of graphene-based research bloom within the scientific community. Since 2004, the availability and relatively straight forward synthesis of single-layer graphene (SLG) enabled the observation of remarkable phenomena including: massless Dirac fermions, extremely high mobilities of its charge carriers, room temperature half-integer quantum Hall effect, the Rashba effect, and the potential for ballistic conduction over macroscopic distances. These enticing electronic properties produce the drive to study graphene for use in truly nanoscale electrical interconnects, integrated circuits, transparent conducting electrodes, ultra-high frequency transistors, and spintronic devices, just to name a few. Yet, for almost all real world applications graphene will need to be interfaced with other materials, metals, dielectrics, organics, or any combination thereof that in turn are constituted from various inorganic and organic components.

In order to realize these visions, graphene has to be synthesized, grown, or exfoliated with properties that are determined by the targeted application. Growth of so-called epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide by sublimation of silicon in an argon atmosphere is one particular method that could potentially lead to electronic applications. In this contribution we summarize our recent work on different aspects of epitaxial graphene growth and interface manipulation by intercalation, which was performed by a combination of low-energy electron microscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, atomic force microscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy.

KGaA, Weinheim)\n\nElectronic structure and electron dynamics at an organic molecule/metal interface: interface states of tetra-tert-butyl-imine/Au(111)\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHagen, Sebastian; Wolf, Martin; Tegeder, Petra; Luo Ying; Haag, Rainer\n\n2010-01-01\n\nTime- and angle-resolved two-photon photoemission (2PPE) spectroscopies have been used to investigated the electronic structure, electron dynamics and localization at the interface between tetra-tert-butyl imine (TBI) and Au(111). At a TBI coverage of one monolayer (ML), the two highest occupied molecular orbitals, HOMO and HOMO-1, are observed at an energy of -1.9 and -2.6 eV below the Fermi level (E F ), respectively, and coincide with the d-band features of the Au substrate. In the unoccupied electronic structure, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) has been observed at 1.6 eV with respect to E F . In addition, two delocalized states that arise from the modified image potential at the TBI/metal interface have been identified. Their binding energies depend strongly on the adsorption structure of the TBI adlayer, which is coverage dependent in the submonolayer (â¤1 ML) regime. Thus the binding energy of the lower interface state (IS) shifts from 3.5 eV at 1.0 ML to 4.0 eV at 0.5 ML, which is accompanied by a pronounced decrease in its lifetime from 100 fs to below 10 fs. This is a result of differences in the wave function overlap with electronic states of the Au(111) substrate at different binding energies. This study shows that in order to fully understand the electronic structure of organic adsorbates at metal surfaces, not only adsorbate- and substrate-induced electronic states have to be considered but also ISs, which are the result of a potential formed by the interaction between the adsorbate and the substrate.\n\nObservation of carbon growth and interface structures in methanol solution\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nOkuno, Kimio\n\n2015-11-01\n\nIn the deposition of carbon on the surface of a tungsten tip in methanol solution by electrolysis, the growth structure of the carbon films, the interface state, and the dissolution of carbon atoms into the tungsten matrix of the substrate have been investigated with the atomic events by field ion microscopy (FIM). The carbon films preferentially condense on the W{111} plane. The interfacial reaction at the carbon atom-tungsten substrate interface is vigorous and the carbon atoms also readily dissolve into the substrate matrix to form a tungsten-carbon complex. The reaction depth of the deposited carbon depends on the magnitude of electrolytic current and the treatment duration in the methanol solution. In this work, the resolution depth of carbon was found to be approximately 270 atomic layers below the top layer of the tungsten substrate by a field evaporation technique. In the case of a low electrolytic current, the tungsten substrate surface is entirely covered with carbon atoms having a pseudomorphic structure. The field-electron emission characteristics were also evaluated for various coverages of the carbon film formed on the substrate.\n\nEvolution of the SrTiO3/MoO3 interface electronic structure: An in situ photoelectron spectroscopy study\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nDu, Yuanmin; Peng, Haiyang; Mao, Hongying; Jin, Kexin; Wang, Hong; Li, Feng; Gao, Xingyu; Chen, Wei; Wu, Tao\n\n2015-01-01\n\nModifying the surface energetics, particularly the work function, of advanced materials is of critical importance for a wide range of surface- and interface-based devices.

Thanks to the large work function difference between SrTiO3 and MoO3, the energy band alignment on the SrTiO3 surface is significantly modified. The charge transfer and dipole formation at the SrTiO3/MoO3 interface leads to a large modulation of work function and an apparent doping in SrTiO3.

The interface design represents the central component for successful information delivery to consumers. However, interface design for web-based information systems is probably more an art than a science at this point in time. Much research is needed to understand properties of an effective interface for electronic commerce. This paper develops a framework identifying the relationship between user factors, the role of the user interface and overall system success for web-based electronic commerce. The paper argues that web-based systems for electronic commerce have some similar properties to decision support systems (DSS and adapts an established DSS framework to the electronic commerce domain. Based on a limited amount of research studying web browser interface design, the framework identifies areas of research needed and outlines possible relationships between consumer characteristics, interface design attributes and measures of overall system success.\n\nElectronic and structural characterizations of unreconstructed {0001} surfaces and the growth of graphene overlayers\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nEmtsev, Konstantin\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe present work is focused on the characterization of the clean unreconstructed SiC{0001} surfaces and the growth of graphene overlayers thereon.

Both materials are non-magnetic insulators. LAO-STO interfaces, however, can be conducting, and even superconducting at millikelvin temperatures. Moreover, using cantilever-based torque magnetometry we have found a ferromagnetic-like ordering at such interfaces that coexists with the superconductivity. To gain insight into the underlying electronic structure I have developed and built solid-state planar tunnel devices with LAO-STO interfaces as one tunneling electrode. Using these devices the electronic density of states (DOS) of normal- and superconducting LAO-STO interfaces was mapped with tunneling spectroscopy. Since the charge carrier density at LAO-STO interfaces is highly tunable with electrostatic gating, the spectral DOS of the 2D-superconductor could be explored across a wide T,n-phase diagram. The main result bears a striking resemblance to the pseudogap-phase of high-temperature cuprate superconductors. The appendix reports on possible technical applications of LAO-STO interfaces in field-effect transistors and integrated circuits. Furthermore, it contains extensive experimental results concerning alternative growth procedures and related material systems. The LAO-STO interface is established as a representative of a broader class of conducting oxide interfaces. In particular, a conducting oxide interface without SrTiO{sub 3}, the LaAlO{sub 3}-CaTiO{sub 3} interface, is investigated.\n\nPredictions of mixed mode interface crack growth using a cohesive zone model for ductile fracture\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nTvergaard, Viggo\n\n2004-01-01\n\nSpecial interface elements that account for ductile failure by the nucleation and growth of voids to coalescence are used to analyse crack growth.

First-principles calculations were incorporated in high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) simulations by converting the charge density into electron scattering factors to examine the influence of charge transfer, charge redistribution at the interface, and ionicity on the dynamical electron scattering and on calculated HRTEM images. It is concluded that the ionicity of oxides and the charge redistribution at interfaces play a significant role in HRTEM image simulations. In particular, the calculations show that at oxygen-terminated (111) Ag-MgO interfaces the first oxygen layer at the interface is much brighter than that in calculations with neutral atoms, in agreement with experimental observations\n\nLedge-flow-controlled catalyst interface dynamics during Si nanowire growth\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nHofmann, S; Sharma, R; Wirth, CT\n\n2008-01-01\n\nunderstanding of the role of commonly used catalysts and specifically of their interface dynamics1, 2.

The rates of introduction and annealing-out temperatures of In and P vancancies are estimated using proper theoretical models. These calculations reveal that after room temperature irradiation only complexes may exist. It is also supported by our experimental data that the sum of introducing rates of three detected levels are less than the theoretical value calculated for single vacancies. According to our equation on the relation between interface states and DLTS signal and from the results of computer calculation we believe that the broad peak appearing in the DLTS diagram before irradiation is related to interface states. Its disappearance after electron irradiation suggests the reduction of interface states; this is further confirmed by the reduction of surface recombination rate derived from the results of surface photovoltage measurement\n\nElectronic Processes at OrganicâOrganic Interfaces: Insight from Modeling and Implications for Opto-electronic Devices â\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nBeljonne, David\n\n2011-02-08\n\nWe report on the recent progress achieved in modeling the electronic processes that take place at interfaces between Ï-conjugated materials in organic opto-electronic devices. First, we provide a critical overview of the current computational techniques used to assess the morphology of organic: organic heterojunctions; we highlight the compromises that are necessary to handle large systems and multiple time scales while preserving the atomistic details required for subsequent computations of the electronic and optical properties. We then review some recent theoretical advances in describing the ground-state electronic structure at heterojunctions between donor and acceptor materials and highlight the role played by charge-transfer and long-range polarization effects. Finally, we discuss the modeling of the excited-state electronic structure at organic:organic interfaces, which is a key aspect in the understanding of the dynamics of photoinduced electron-transfer processes.

The primary approach to address this problem has been command-and-control policies that ban informal recycling and international trade in electronic scrap. These bans are difficult to enforce and also have negative effects by reducing reuse of electronics, and employment for people in poverty. An alternate approach is to link informal and formal sectors so as to maintain economic activity while mitigating environmental damages. This article explores the idea of an interface organization that purchases components and waste from informal dismantlers and passes them on to formal processors. Environmental, economic and social implications of interface organizations are discussed. The main environmental questions to resolve are what e-scrap components should be targeted by the interface organization, i.e., circuit boards, wires, and/or plastic parts. Economically, when formal recycling is more profitable (e.g., for circuit boards, the interface organization is revenue positive. However, price subsidies are needed for copper wires and residual waste to incentivize informal dismantlers to turn in for formal processing. Socially, the potential for corruption and gaming of the system is critical and needs to be addressed.\n\nElectronic structure of ferromagnet-insulator interfaces: Fe/MgO and Co/MgO\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nMueller, M.\n\n2007-07-11\n\nIn this thesis the electronic structure of Fe/MgO{sub x} and Co/MgO{sub x} ferromagnet-insulator interfaces, representing material systems which are widely used in magnetic tunnel junctions, is studied by means of spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The photoemission studies focus particularly on the response of the ferromagnetic electronic system in contact with MgO of varying stoichiometries, as this reflects the mechanisms of metal-oxide bonding at real ferromagnet-insulator interfaces. The correlation between chemical bonding and electronic structure formation is analyzed by combining information from core- and valence-band photoemission spectroscopy. The spectral features are compared to band structure calculations, which are performed using the SPR-KKR method. The Fe/MgO and Co/MgO systems are prepared by molecular beam epitaxy under ultrahigh vacuum conditions on well-defined (4 x 6) GaAs(001) substrates. A structural analysis by means of low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) reveals their body-centered cubic crystalline structure, whereas the chemical characterization by Auger electron spectroscopy is used to quantify the chemical environment at the sample surfaces. The magnetic analysis, using the magneto-optical Kerr effect, reveals the uniaxial anisotropy of the ferromagnetic layers. A crucial parameter is given by the MgO degree of oxidation, which is addressed by means of core-level spectroscopy and quantified by suitable fitting procedures of the Mg 2p core level. The results of the photoemission experiments show, that the electronic structure of the Fe/MgO and Co/MgO ferromagnet/insulator interfaces and, consequently, the interfacial spin polarization are sensitively controlled by the interface chemistry. In particular, three distinct scenarios are identified: the nearly stoichiometric, the oxygen-deficient and the over-oxidized ferromagnet/MgO interface. Each case is defined by innate characteristics of the electronic structure at\n\nBiomechanical ordering and buckling due to microbial growth confined at oil-water interfaces\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJuarez, Gabriel; Stocker, Roman\n\n2015-11-01\n\nBacteria are unicellular organisms that often exist as densely populated, surface-associated communities. Bacteria are also environmental colloids and spontaneously attach and self-assemble at liquid-liquid interfaces. Here, we present results on the growth dynamics of individual rod-shaped bacteria confined to finite oil-water interfaces of varying curvature. Through experiments using microfluidic chambers and time-lapse microscopy, we study the formation of macroscopic structures observed as adsorbed bacteria grow, divide, and self-assemble in a nematic phase due to biomechanical interactions. The continued growth at the interface leads to a jammed monolayer of cells, which then causes the interface to buckle and undergo large deformations including wrinkling and tubulation. These observations highlight the interplay between physical environment, such as confinement and interface curvature, and active biological processes, such as growth, at the scale of individual agents and shape our understanding of macroscale processes such as microbial degradation of oil in the ocean.\n\nUser Interface of MUDR Electronic Health Record\n\nCzech Academy of Sciences Publication Activity Database\n\nHanzlÃ­Äek, Petr; Å pidlen, Josef; HeroutovÃ¡, Helena; Nagy, Miroslav\n\n2005-01-01\n\nRoÄ. 74, - (2005), s. 221-227 ISSN 1386-5056 R&D Projects: GA MÅ k LN00B107 Institutional research plan: CEZ:AV0Z10300504 Keywords : electronic health record * user interface * data entry * knowledge base Subject RIV: BB - Applied Statistics, Operational Research Impact factor: 1.374, year: 2005\n\nA unique metal-semiconductor interface and resultant electron transfer phenomenon\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nTaft, S.

L.; Kozhevnikov, M.; Lee, E. Y.; Narayanamurti, V.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nWe present an interface scattering model to describe ballistic-electron-emission microscopy (BEEM) at nonepitaxial metal/semiconductor interfaces. The model starts with a Hamiltonian consisting of the sum of two terms: one term, H 0 , describes an ideal interface for which the interface parallel component of wave vector is a good quantum number, and the second term, Î´H, describes interfacial scattering centers. The eigenstates of H 0 consist of an incident and a reflected part in the metal and a transmitted part in the semiconductor. The three components of each eigenstate have the same interface parallel wave vector. Because tunneling preferentially weights forward-directed states, the interface parallel component of wave vector is small for the H 0 eigenstates that are initially populated with high probability in BEEM. Î´H scatters electrons between the eigenstates of H 0 . The scattering conserves energy, but not the interface parallel wave vector. In the final state of the scattering process, states with a large interface parallel wave vector can be occupied with reasonable probability. If scattering is weak, so that the parallel wave vector is nearly conserved, the calculated collector current into conduction-band valleys with zero parallel wave vector at the minimum, such as the Î valley for GaAs(100), is much larger than the calculated collector current into conduction-band valleys with a large parallel wave vector at the minimum, such as the L valleys for GaAs(100). However, if scattering is strong, the injected electron flux distribution is redistributed and valleys with zero interface transverse wave vector at their energy minimum are not preferentially weighted. Instead, the weighting varies as the density of final states for the scattering process so that, for example, the calculated L-channel collector current is much larger than the calculated Î-channel collector current for GaAs(100). Interfacial scattering reduces the overall magnitude of the\n\nFreezing hot electrons.

Within this framework, the influence of the substrate, adsorbate structure and morphology, solvation site, coverage, temperature, and solvent on the electron dynamics are studied, yielding microscopic insight into the underlying fundamental processes. Transitions between different regimes of ET, substrate-dominated, barrier-determined, strong, and weak coupling are observed by systematic variation of the interfacial properties and development of empirical model descriptions. It is shown that the fundamental steps of the interfacial electron dynamics are similar for all investigated systems: Metal electrons are photoexcited to unoccupied metal states and transferred into the adlayer via the adsorbate's conduction band. The electrons localize at favorable sites and are stabilized by reorientations of the surrounding polar solvent molecules. Concurrently, they decay back two the metal substrate, as it offers a continuum of unoccupied states. However, the detailed characteristics vary for the different investigated interfaces: For amorphous ice-metal interfaces, the electron transfer is initially, right after photoinjection, dominated by the substrate's electronic surface band structure. With increasing solvation, a transient barrier evolves at the interface that increasingly screens the electrons from the substrate. Tunneling through this barrier becomes the rate-limiting step for ET. The competition of electron decay and solvation leads to lifetimes of the solvated electrons in the order of 100 fs. Furthermore, it is shown that the electrons bind in the bulk of the ice layers, but on the edges of adsorbed D{sub 2}O clusters and that the ice morphology strongly influences the electron dynamics. For the amorphous NH{sub 3}/Cu(111\n\nTuning the conductivity threshold and carrier density of two-dimensional electron gas at oxide interfaces through interface engineering\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nH. J. Harsan Ma\n\n2015-08-01\n\nFull Text Available The two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG formed at the perovskite oxides heterostructures is of great interest because of its potential applications in oxides electronics and nanoscale multifunctional devices. A canonical example is the 2DEG at the interface between a polar oxide LaAlO3 (LAO and non-polar SrTiO3 (STO. Here, the LAO polar oxide can be regarded as the modulating or doping layer and is expected to define the electronic properties of 2DEG at the LAO/STO interface. However, to practically implement the 2DEG in electronics and device design, desired properties such as tunable 2D carrier density are necessary. Here, we report the tuning of conductivity threshold, carrier density and electronic properties of 2DEG in LAO/STO heterostructures by insertion of a La0.5Sr0.5TiO3 (LSTO layer of varying thicknesses, and thus modulating the amount of polarization of the oxide over layers. Our experimental result shows an enhancement of carrier density up to a value of about five times higher than that observed at the LAO/STO interface. A complete thickness dependent metal-insulator phase diagram is obtained by varying the thickness of LAO and LSTO providing an estimate for the critical thickness needed for the metallic phase. The observations are discussed in terms of electronic reconstruction induced by polar oxides.\n\nConductance enhancement due to interface magnons in electron-beam evaporated MgO magnetic tunnel junctions with CoFeB free layer deposited at different pressure\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nGuo, P.; Yu, G.

By changing the growth pressure, the junction dynamic conductance dI/dV, inelastic electron tunneling spectrum dÂ²I/dVÂ², and tunneling magnetoresistance vary with temperature. Moreover, the low-energy magnon cutoff energy E{sub C} derived from the conductance versus temperature curve agrees with interface magnon energy obtained directly from the inelastic electron tunneling spectrum, which demonstrates that interface magnons are involved in the electron tunneling process, opening an additional conductance channel and thus enhancing the total conductance.\n\nElectronic Processes at OrganicâOrganic Interfaces: Insight from Modeling and Implications for Opto-electronic Devices â\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nBeljonne, David; Cornil, JeÌroÌme; Muccioli, Luca; Zannoni, Claudio; BreÌdas, Jean-Luc; Castet, FreÌdeÌric\n\n2011-01-01\n\nWe report on the recent progress achieved in modeling the electronic processes that take place at interfaces between Ï-conjugated materials in organic opto-electronic devices.

We focus on two different models that treat weakly interacting organic/metal (and organic/organic) interfaces: the induced density of interfacial states model and the so-called integer charge transfer model. The two models are compared and evaluated, mainly using photoelectron spectroscopy data of the energy level alignment of conjugated polymers and molecules at various organic/metal and organic/organic interfaces. We show that two different alignment regimes are generally observed: (i) vacuum level alignment, which corresponds to the lack of vacuum level offsets (Schottky-Mott limit) and hence the lack of charge transfer across the interface, and (ii) Fermi level pinning where the resulting work function of an organic/metal and organic/organic bilayer is independent of the substrate work function and an interface dipole is formed due to charge transfer across the interface. We argue that the experimental results are best described by the integer charge transfer model which predicts the vacuum level alignment when the substrate work function is above the positive charge transfer level and below the negative charge transfer level of the conjugated material. The model further predicts Fermi level pinning to the positive (negative) charge transfer level when the substrate work function is below (above) the positive (negative) charge transfer level. The nature of the integer charge transfer levels depend on the materials system: for conjugated large molecules and polymers, the integer charge transfer states are polarons or bipolarons; for small molecules' highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals and for crystalline systems, the relevant levels are the valence and conduction band edges. Finally, limits and further improvements to the integer charge transfer model are discussed as well as the impact on device design.

The stoichiometry, structural quality and crystal orientation, surface morphology, and the electron concentration were examined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Laue diffraction, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and Hall-effect measurement, respectively. The similarity of the measured-fundamental and surface-band gaps reveals the nearly flat behavior of the bands at the as-cleaved surface of the crystals. Ag and Au/In{sub 2}O{sub 3} interfaces show Schottky behavior, while an ohmic one was observed in Cu, In, and Sn/In{sub 2}O{sub 3} contacts. From agreement of the bulk and surface band gaps, rectifying contact formation as well as the occurrence of photovoltage effect at the pristine surface of the crystals, it can be deduced that SEAL is not an intrinsic property of the as-cleaved surface of the studied crystals. Moreover, for thick Au and Cu overlayer regime at room temperature, Shockley-like surface states were observed. Additionally, the initial stage of Cu and In growth on In{sub 2}O{sub 3} was accompanied by the formation of a two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) fading away for higher coverages which are not associated with the earlier-detected 2DEG at the surface of In{sub 2}O{sub 3} thin films. The application of the Schottky-Mott rule, using in situ-measured work functions of In{sub 2}O{sub 3} and the metals, showed a strong disagreement for all the interfaces except for Ag/In{sub 2}O{sub 3}. The experimental data also disagree with more advanced theories based on the electronegativity concept and metal-induced gap states models.\n\nWeakly nonlinear incompressible Rayleigh-Taylor instability growth at cylindrically convergent interfaces\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWang, L. F.; He, X. T.; Wu, J. F.; Zhang, W. Y.; Ye, W. H.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nA weakly nonlinear (WN) model has been developed for the incompressible Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) in cylindrical geometry. The transition from linear to nonlinear growth is analytically investigated via a third-order solutions for the cylindrical RTI initiated by a single-mode velocity perturbation. The third-order solutions can depict the early stage of the interface asymmetry due to the bubble-spike formation, as well as the saturation of the linear (exponential) growth of the fundamental mode. The WN results in planar RTI [Wang et al., Phys. Plasmas 19, 112706 (2012)] are recovered in the limit of high-mode number perturbations. The difference between the WN growth of the RTI in cylindrical geometry and in planar geometry is discussed. It is found that the interface of the inward (outward) development spike/bubble is extruded (stretched) by the additional inertial force in cylindrical geometry compared with that in planar geometry. For interfaces with small density ratios, the inward growth bubble can grow fast than the outward growth spike in cylindrical RTI. Moreover, a reduced formula is proposed to describe the WN growth of the RTI in cylindrical geometry with an acceptable precision, especially for small-amplitude perturbations. Using the reduced formula, the nonlinear saturation amplitude of the fundamental mode and the phases of the Fourier harmonics are studied. Thus, it should be included in applications where converging geometry effects play an important role, such as the supernova explosions and inertial confinement fusion implosions.\n\nElectronic charge rearrangement at metal/organic interfaces induced by weak van der Waals interactions\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFerri, Nicola; Ambrosetti, Alberto; Tkatchenko, Alexandre\n\n2017-07-01\n\nElectronic charge rearrangements at interfaces between organic molecules and solid surfaces play a key role in a wide range of applications in catalysis, light-emitting diodes, single-molecule junctions, molecular sensors and switches, and photovoltaics. It is common to utilize electrostatics and Pauli pushback to control the interface electronic properties, while the ubiquitous van der Waals (vdW) interactions are often considered to have a negligible direct contribution (beyond the obvious structural relaxation). Here, we apply a fully self-consistent Tkatchenko-Scheffler vdW density functional to demonstrate that the weak vdW interactions can induce sizable charge rearrangements at hybrid metal/organic systems (HMOS). The complex vdW correlation potential smears out the interfacial electronic density, thereby reducing the charge transfer in HMOS, changes the interface work functions by up to 0.2 eV, and increases the interface dipole moment by up to 0.3 Debye. Our results suggest that vdW interactions should be considered as an additional control parameter in the design of hybrid interfaces with the desired electronic properties.\n\nModel of two-dimensional electron gas formation at ferroelectric interfaces\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nAguado-Puente, P.; Bristowe, N. C.; Yin, B.; Shirasawa, R.; Ghosez, Philippe; Littlewood, P. B.; Artacho, Emilio\n\n2015-07-01\n\nThe formation of a two-dimensional electron gas at oxide interfaces as a consequence of polar discontinuities has generated an enormous amount of activity due to the variety of interesting effects it gives rise to. Here, we study under what circumstances similar processes can also take place underneath ferroelectric thin films. We use a simple Landau model to demonstrate that in the absence of extrinsic screening mechanisms, a monodomain phase can be stabilized in ferroelectric films by means of an electronic reconstruction. Unlike in the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructure, the emergence with thickness of the free charge at the interface is discontinuous. This prediction is confirmed by performing first-principles simulations of free-standing slabs of PbTiO3. The model is also used to predict the response of the system to an applied electric field, demonstrating that the two-dimensional electron gas can be switched on and off discontinuously and in a nonvolatile fashion. Furthermore, the reversal of the polarization can be used to switch between a two-dimensional electron gas and a two-dimensional hole gas, which should, in principle, have very different transport properties. We discuss the possible formation of polarization domains and how such configuration competes with the spontaneous accumulation of free charge at the interfaces.\n\nEpitaxial growth of topological insulator Bi{sub 2}Se{sub 3} film on Si(111) with atomically sharp interface\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nBansal, Namrata [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rutgers, State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ 08854 (United States); Kim, Yong Seung [Graphene Research Institute, Sejong University, Seoul 143-747 (Korea, Republic of); Edrey, Eliav; Brahlek, Matthew; Horibe, Yoichi [Department of Physics and Astronomy, Rutgers, State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ 08854 (United States); Iida, Keiko; Tanimura, Makoto [Research Department, Nissan Arc, Ltd.

Two-step growth process is found to be a key to achieve interfacial-layer-free epitaxial Bi{sub 2}Se{sub 3} films on Si substrates. With a single-step high temperature growth, second phase clusters are formed at an early stage. On the other hand, with low temperature growth, the film tends to be disordered even in the absence of a second phase. With a low temperature initial growth followed by a high temperature growth, second-phase-free atomically sharp interface is obtained between Bi{sub 2}Se{sub 3} and Si substrate, as verified by reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction. The lattice constant of Bi{sub 2}Se{sub 3} is observed to relax to its bulk value during the first quintuple layer according to RHEED analysis, implying the absence of strain from the substrate. TEM shows a fully epitaxial structure of Bi{sub 2}Se{sub 3} film down to the first quintuple layer without any second phase or an amorphous layer.\n\nStructures and electronics of buried and unburied semiconductor interfaces\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKamiya, Itaru\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe structure of interfaces plays an important role in determining the electronic properties of semiconductor nanostructures.

Using an ultra-thin B2-FeSi film grown on Si(111), the interface is still reached by electrons, so quantitative low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) could be applied to determine the bonding geometry experimentally. As a result, the local configuration at the shallow buried interface is characterized by near-substrate Fe atoms being 8-fold coordinated to Si atoms and by the silicide unit cell being rotated by 180 deg. with respect to the Si unit cell (B8 configuration). The interface energetics were explored by total-energy calculations using density functional theory (DFT). The B8-type interface proves to be the most stable one, consistent with the experimental findings. The atomic geometries obtained experimentally (LEED) and theoretically (DFT) agree within the limits of errors. Additionally, the calculations explain the stabilization of the B2 phase, which is unstable as bulk material: the analysis of the elastic behaviour reveals a reversed energy hierarchy of B2 and the bulk stable B20 phase when epitaxial growth on Si(111) is enforced\n\nAdvanced Power Electronics Interfaces for Distributed Energy Workshop Summary: August 24, 2006, Sacramento, California\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nTreanton, B.; Palomo, J.; Kroposki, B.; Thomas, H.\n\n2006-10-01\n\nThe Advanced Power Electronics Interfaces for Distributed Energy Workshop, sponsored by the California Energy Commission Public Interest Energy Research program and organized by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, was held Aug. 24, 2006, in Sacramento, Calif.

A valuable step towards a better understanding of molecular electronics. Nominated as an outstanding contribution by the Autonomous University of Madrid. In recent years, ever more electronic devices have started to exploit the advantages of organic semiconductors. The work reported in this thesis focuses on analyzing theoretically the energy level alignment of different metal/organic interfaces, necessary to tailor devices with good performance. Traditional methods based on density functional theory (DFT), are not appropriate for analyzing them because they underestimate the organic energy gap and fail to correctly describe the van der Waals forces. Since the size of these systems prohibits the use of more accurate methods, corrections to those DFT drawbacks are desirable. In this work a combination of a standard DFT calculation with the inclusion of the charging energy (U) of the molecule, calculated from first principles, is presented. Regarding the dispersion forces, incorrect long range interaction is substituted by a van der Waals potential. With these corrections, the C60, benzene, pentacene, TTF and TCNQ/Au(111) interfaces are analyzed, both for single molecules and for a monolayer. The results validate the induced density of interface states model.\n\nDesign of a Flexible Hardware Interface for Multiple Remote Electronic practical Experiments of Virtual Laboratory\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFarah Said\n\n2012-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The objective of this work is to present a new design of a Flexible Hardware Interface (FHI based on PID control techniques to use in a virtual laboratory.

This interface can be viewed as opened hardware architecture to easily develop simple or complex remote experiments in the electronic domain. The philosophy of the use of this interface can also be expanded to many other domains as optic experiments for instance.

TPC requires about 17,000 channels of data acquisition, which samples on command the input to each channel at a 10 MHz rate. This high data rate is made possible by means of Charge Coupled Devices (CCDs), intelligent digitizers, and a sophisticated trigger system. The TPC-CAMAC interface described here was developed to allow experiments of smaller scale than the complete TPC to use the standard data acquisition portion of the TPC electronics, namely the amplifier, CCD and digitizer bins. These three bins, when properly interconnected and controlled by the interface control bin, form a transient digitizer with a depth of 455 samples and a maximum width of 256 channels per bin set\n\nEffects of graphene defect on electronic structures of its interface with organic semiconductor\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nYang, Qing-Dan; Wang, Chundong; Mo, Hin-Wai; Lo, Ming-Fai; Yuen, Muk Fung; Ng, Tsz-Wai, E-mail: tszwaing@cityu.edu.hk, E-mail: apcslee@cityu.edu.hk; Zhang, Wen-Jun; Lee, Chun-Sing, E-mail: tszwaing@cityu.edu.hk, E-mail: apcslee@cityu.edu.hk [Department of Physics and Materials Science, Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), City University of Hong Kong (Hong Kong); Dou, Wei-Dong [Department of Physics and Materials Science, Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), City University of Hong Kong (Hong Kong); Physics Department, Shaoxing University, Shaoxing 312000 (China); Tsang, Sai-Wing [Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong (Hong Kong)\n\n2015-03-30\n\nElectronic structures of copper hexadecafluorophthalocyanine (F{sub 16}CuPc)/graphene with different defect density were studied with ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy.

Spatially connected TMDC lateral heterojunctions are key components for constructing monolayer p-n rectifying diodes, light-emitting diodes, photovoltaic devices, and bipolar junction transistors. However, such structures are not readily prepared via the layer-stacking techniques, and direct growth favors the thermodynamically preferred TMDC alloys. We report the two-step epitaxial growth of lateral WSe2-MoS2 heterojunction, where the edge of WSe2 induces the epitaxial MoS2 growth despite a large lattice mismatch. The epitaxial growth process offers a controllable method to obtain lateral heterojunction with an atomically sharp interface.\n\nElectronic structure at metal-smiconductor surfaces and interfaces: effects of disorder\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRodrigues, D.E.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nThe main concern of this work is the study of the electronic structure at metal and semiconductor surfaces or interfaces, with special emphasis in the effects of disorder and local microstructure upon them. Various factors which determine this structure are presented and those of central importance are identified. A model that allows the efficient and exact calculation of the local density of states at disordered interfaces is described. This model is based on a tight-binding hamiltonian that has enough flexibility so as to allow an adequate description of real solids. The disorder is taken into account by including stochastic perturbations in the diagonal elements of the hamiltonian in a site orbital basis. These perturbations are taken at each layer from a lorentzian probability distribution. An exact expression for the calculation of the local density of states is derived and applied to a model surface built up from a type orbitals arranged in a simple cubic lattice. The effects of disorder on the local densities of states and on the existence of surface Tamm states are studied. The properties of the electronic states with this kind of model of disorder are considered. The self-consistent calculation of the electronic structure of the Si(111) - (1x1) surface is presented. The effects of disorder on the electronic properties such as the work function or the position of surface states within the gap are evaluated. The surface of the metallic compound NiSi 2 is also treated. The first self-consistent calculation of the electronic structure of its (111) surface is presented. The electronic structure of the Si/NiSi 2 (111) interfaces is calculated for the two types of junctions that can be grown experimentally. The origin of the difference between the Schottky barrier heights at both interfaces is discussed. The results are compared with available experimental data.
