In recent decades, all branches of science have been widely expanded and many words and terms have been utilized to express their concept. Many of them are compound phrases and high-frequency terms, and if we use them as they are, our speech and writing becomes very lengthy and boring. That is why people prefer the short forms (abbreviations) for frequently used compound phrases. The main objective of technical abbreviations is to save time and decrease speech and writing to facilitate engineers’ communication. The other intention is the explicitness, ﬂuency, and beauty of our speech and writing. Any method, which can help us to achieve these goals, is acceptable. Abbreviations contribute to faster writing, reading, speaking, and better understanding of technical and scientiﬁc articles, reports, and lectures. They can save time and money by reducing the time and cost of writing, typing, editing, and composition resetting costs. They also reduce the space required for texts, tables, and diagrams. Therefore, they are very good tools to enhance any live and dynamic language. The words of the English and other European languages comprise a few special characters implying distinct technical meanings, such as l for wavelength or 4 for phase. In these languages, abbreviations play a similar role, but each of them implies the meaning of a “phrase” instead of a “word.” Thus, they can be considered as the elements of that language and are treated like the original words. Sometimes, the short form of a phrase is more common than that of its original form because they are very proper and effective tools for communication. In most languages, especially in English, coining abbreviations is a common practice and most of the high-frequency compound terms are used in short forms. For this reason, the abbreviations of a language are considered as “a language within that language”, and from the socio-linguistic point\n\nviii\n\n&\n\nof view, they are comparable with a “dialect.” Therefore, utilization of abbreviations is inevitable and it is a wise decision to take action for their standardization. Without standard rules and principles, there will be many debates and discussions about writing style, when engineers are writing their manuscripts. To avoid these debates, it is recommended that writing principles and rules are formulated and standardized. With this in mind, I have followed the principles and rules adopted by John Markus, the composer of “Electronics Dictionary” as described in the fourth edition and recommend them to be standardized for international application. This book is entitled as “Comprehensive Glossary of Telecom Abbreviations”, but since each branch of science listed below are somehow interrelated and intermingled with telecommunications engineering, I have also included the abbreviations of those branches. The abbreviations listed in this work have been compiled over years from intensive study of various resources. A glossary of abbreviations is a growing work and will never be perfect and fully comprehensive. Despite this, I have tried all my best to include a collection of over 16,200 entries from almost all the ﬁelds of telecommunications, satellite communications, electronics, computer, Internet, broadcasting, ﬁber optics, information technology (IT), ICT, live Internet chat, e-learning, e-commerce, remote sensing, cellular networks, avionics, Ham radio, radar, and military communications terms to satisfy the needs of engineers, technical writers, technicians, and university students. Particular attention is paid to the abbreviations used in ITU, IMO, Intelsat, Inmarsat, and APSCC documents. Telecommunication magazines are not forgotten and many titles and volumes have been searched. You may also ﬁnd many abbreviations used in contracts and ﬁnancial documents. The most famous telecom companies and operators are included. A larger number of abbreviations made and used by the specialized institutions and standard organizations such as IEEE, ETSI, IETF, and ISO are also included. New technologies and systems such as ISDN, ATM, TMN, SONET, SDH, DECT, and Bluetooth are of special importance in this glossary. All entries are listed in alphabetical order. Where two or more entries differ only in capitalization or punctuation, the forms comprised of uppercased (capital) letters will follow the lowercased forms, and those having dots, slashes, or spaces precede the capital forms. Entries commencing with numbers are collected before all others. Where more than one phrase stand for a given abbreviation, both or all phrases are mentioned and marked by numbers. Entries of Greek symbols or letters are also alphabetized as if they were spelt out. Following the phrases, the relevant ﬁeld of each entry has also been shown in parentheses or\n\n&\n\nix\n\nbrackets to clarify or limit the usage ﬁeld. If an entry does not fall into a speciﬁc category, the name of the company which coined that abbreviation is mentioned in parentheses.

They contributed so much to solve and cope with the problems, which I faced while compiling this glossary.\n\nIntroduction STRUCTURE OF ABBREVIATIONS Abbreviation, in its simplest deﬁnition, is a shortened form of a word or phrase used mostly in writing to imply and represent the complete form of that word or phrase. There are many ways to build abbreviations for words or phrases which fall into eight main categories as follows. 1. Acronyms: The pronounceable abbreviations coined from the combination of the ﬁrst letters of each successive words of a compound term or phrase, as in radar, laser, maser, and sonar. The most common acronyms are normally written in lowercase letters and pronounced in the same way as the ordinary words. They may be either initially capitalized or set in all capitals in titles and headings. 2. Initials: A category of abbreviations in which the ﬁrst letters of a series of words are selected and spelt out letter by letter but are not separated by dots, as in ISDN, CDMA, and DWDM. 3. Blendings: Another category of abbreviations in which the ﬁrst syllables of two or three words are combined and pronounced as an ordinary word, such as codec for coder–decoder, modem for modulator–demodulator, and Inmarsat for International maritime satellite Organization. Other forms of blendings are made of the ﬁrst syllable of the ﬁrst word and the last syllable of the second word, such as netiquette, which stands for network-etiquette and webinar standing for Web-based seminar. 4. Clippings: A category of abbreviations in which some of the letters or sounds of a word are omitted and the key letters are combined, e.g., Bldg for building and MUX for multiplexer. 5. Truncations: A category of abbreviations in which a word is simply shortened by cutting off the ﬁrst or last syllable, such as phone for telephone, amp for ampliﬁer, and Fig for ﬁgure. For building such short forms, it is recommended to select at least three letters of the word.\n\nxiv\n\n&\n\n6. Contractions: A category of abbreviations in which the ﬁrst and last letters of a word is selected, such as Mr for Mister and Dr for Doctor. 7. Symbols: Single letters generally used to represent an element, a quality, a physical or numerical quantity, often appended with subscripts or superscripts to qualify their meaning, such as C for Capacitor and R for Resistor. Symbols may not be related to the words that they represent. Examples are C for speed of light in a vacuum, G for electrical conductance, H for magnetic ﬁeld strength, and L for inductance or an inductor. 8. Signs: A category of abbreviations which are printed or written ﬁgures (mostly Greek letters) each one conventionally stands for a word, phrase, or mathematical operation, e.g., U for ohm, F for phase, m for micro, l for wavelength, and 8 for degree. RULES FOLLOWED IN THIS GLOSSARY (Courtesy of John Markus and McGrawHill) Part A: Rules for abbreviations 1. All the abbreviations formed from ﬁrst letters of key words in a phrase are uppercased (capital) letters, except the units of measures which conform to the French SI units of measure adopted by the American National Standards Institute. There is another exception for the soundalike words, such as laser, maser, and radar, which are lowercased. 2. Abbreviations of phrases are generally pronounced letter by letter, but this is not a requirement for capitalizing. Thus, FET can be pronounced either letter by letter or as a word. Long abbreviations such as JFET and MOSFET are usually pronounced partially or entirely as words. 3. A Hyphen (-) is seldom used in abbreviations. When used, it will generally have one of the meanings represented by the slash. Thus, in A/D-D/A the hyphen stands for or, but in P-P it stands for -to-. 4. A hyphen should be used after an abbreviation when it is combined with another word to form a compound adjective, such as “JPEG-formatted picture.” 5. A hyphen should be used before an abbreviation when it is combined with another word to form a compound adjective, such as “BroadbandISDN.” 6. For plural forms of capital-letter abbreviations, especially the acronyms and blendings, regardless of whether in text or headings, same as the ordinary words, simply add a lowercase “s”, e.g., ICs, VSATs, FETs, RAMs, LEDs, SCRs, MICs, and PCBs. Same rule applies to plurals of numbers, e.g., 0s and 1s. 7. Use an apostrophe with the plurals of lowercase letters, as in “programming has two m’s.” 8. Use an apostrophe for the possessive form of a capital-letter abbreviation, as in “the SCR’s heat sink.”\n\n&\n\nxv\n\n9. Use a space between a number and its abbreviated unit of measure in noun phrases, such as “5 kU and 100 VAR.” 10. Use a numerical exponent to indicate repetition of a letter in abbreviations for logic terms, such as T2L which stands for TTL. 11. A slash (/) generally means -to-, such as S/N (signal-to-noise). It will also have the meaning of per when it is used with letter symbols, such as kHz/s which stands for “kilo Hertz per second.” 12. Although the names of programming languages are acronyms and therefore are pronounced as words, it is now a common usage to type or print them in capital letters, e.g., ALGOL, COBOL, BASIC, and FORTRAN. 13. Do not italicize R, L, and C where they represent resistance or resistor, inductance or coil, and capacitance or capacitor, respectively. When R, L, and C are used in combination, run the letters together without hyphens, as in RC coupling and RLC circuit. Italicize these letters only in mathematical equations where they represent values of resistance, inductance, and capacitance, respectively, and in expressions like LC product, L /C ratio, and RC constant. Part B: Rules for SI Units of measure 1. When a letter symbol in SI system of units is derived from the name of a pioneer in the ﬁeld, capitalize the letter that represents the ﬁrst letter of the surname, such as “mF” which stands for microfarad. 2. Standard preﬁxes are used in lowercase letters as multipliers with the SI letter symbols. Note that only six largest preﬁxes have capital letters for their symbols, e.g., M for mega-, G for giga-, T for tera-, P for peta-, Y for yotta-, and Z for zetta-. 3. Letter symbols always represent both singular and plural forms of units of measure. Never add a lowercase “s” for plural because it represents seconds in the SI system of units. 4. Use an exponent after a length symbol to change it to an area or volume symbol. (The abbreviations sq for square and cu for cubic are used with SI units.) Pronunciation is unchanged; thus, in2 is pronounced “square inches” and in3 is pronounced “cubic inches.” 5. Use a space between a number and its abbreviated unit of measure in noun phrases. 6. Use a hyphen (-) between a number and its abbreviated unit of measure in compound adjectives, such as “a 20-kHz signal.” 7. Use a hyphen between two numbers that are the upper and lower limits of a range. In this case, the meaning of hyphen is “up to and including.” 8. Do not use a letter symbol without a numerical value. Spell out units of measure whenever they are used with words that represent approximations.\n\nThe Author Ali Akbar Arabi is a senior technical engineer with Inmarsat Mobile Satellite Communication Systems, handling the affairs of the Inmarsat network plus the IMSO and APSCC organizations in Iran.
