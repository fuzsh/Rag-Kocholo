        "text": "The paper focuses on creating an internet security awareness training program for use by students at the Metropolitan State University of Denver. The discussion begins with analyzing the best practices of the current security programs. Also, the paper outlines some of the challenges of creating the training program for the university's students.\n\nAbstract New attacks are emerging rapidly in Information Security; hence the tools and technologies available for securing the information needs substantial upgradation as well as skills for operationlization to mitigate these attacks. It requires creation of practical training environment with tools ...\n\nWe know that many e-learning institutions are rushing into adopting ICT without carefully planning and understanding any related security concerns. E-learning is a new method of learning which ultimately depends on the Internet in its execution. The Internet has become the venue for a new set of illegal activities, and the e-learning environment is now exposed to such threats. In this paper, e-learning context, definition, characteristics, development, growth, benefits and challenges are all elaborated upon. This paper discusses the security elements required to be implemented within e-learning environments. In addition, the paper explains the situation and existing research relating to security in e-learning. Furthermore, information security management is suggested to contribute to preparing a secured e-learning environment.\n\nThis study was conducted to know about design, development, and implementation of information security education for teachers and educational personnel’s: framework of technology for Indonesia. This study used qualitative method of analysis to find and understand central phenomenon’s with kind of bibliography. The applicated method of data collecting was technic of gather and analyze the documents, conducted by technic of data mining with document analysis. The research results showed the components of education of information security integrated of categories of discussion consisting of design, development, and implementation. Design included categories of designs of methodology, safety, outsourcing, spreading, technological continuity, development process, and partners involvement and method of evaluation ready to be transferred (education). The components of development consisted of e-learning materials category supporting pictures/videos, security capacity, and continued profess...\n\nThe article considers the peculiarities of using the Internet as an educational resource. The author analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of implementation Internet technologies into the educational process. It is noted that the effective use of educational Internet resources depends on the availability of ITT tools, their technical level, the ability of users to efficiently search and use of the necessary educational and reference resources at different stages of the educational process."
