        "text": "1. X-XXX-XXX DECEMBER 12, 2005 DAN FACCIO MARINA FONTOURA Why Exchange Rates Change: Purchasing Power Parity and Interest Rate Parity Ever since the initial experimentations with floating exchange rates in the 1920’s, rate fluctuations have been the object of attention, study and puzzlement of economists and businesspeople. Initially supposed to be fairly constant and controllable by governments and policy-makers, currency exchange rates have proven to be disappointingly unstable under a free- floating system. This instability has been attributed to factors ranging from “destabilizing speculation” to complex interactions within the economic and monetary systems. There are, nevertheless, fundamental dynamics which are expected to link exchange rates to other economic elements, such as interest rates and inflation rates. The purpose of this note is to provide a didactic overview of these dynamics and verify their occurrence in real historical data. Currency Exchange Rates An exchange rate is the rate at which one currency can be exchanged for another. For most practical effects, they can be understood as the “price” paid (or received) in a given currency to acquire (or sell) one unit of another currency. The U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate, for instance, determines how many U.S. dollars are required to acquire one euro, or how many U.S. dollars are received when one euro is sold. This analogy is specially useful when thinking about the movement in exchange rates: since exchange rates represent the price of “products” – the currencies – which can be traded in foreign-exchange markets1, movements in exchange rates should be largely explained by supply-demand dynamics in these markets. Currencies are, however, “products” with very specific characteristics. Their demand is influenced by domestic and global economic shifts, their supply is guided by monetary policies, and both are heavily impacted by the action of international speculators. Some fundamental economic dynamics, however, drive what could be seen as the “intrinsic value” of currencies. Although their actual influence on rates is disputed by economists, these dynamics seem to exist independently of other market forces, and therefore explain at least some part of the movement observed in exchange rates. 1 Since the end of the Bretton Woods system, in 1973, most major currencies are traded freely in foreign-exchange markets. Restrictions imposed by specific governments on currency transactions impact the exchange rates for these currencies and will be treated as exceptions for the purposes of this note.\n\n2. XXX-XXX Why Exchange Rates Change: IRP and PPP Two mechanisms, known as Purchasing Power Parity and Interest Rate Parity, are the main elements of this logic. They are ultimately two aspects of the same underlying economic concept, but can nevertheless be initially explained as two different relationships. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) Purchasing Power Parity, or PPP, is a theory which states that, when two currencies are in equilibrium, their exchange rate should be such, that either one of them retains its purchasing power when converted into the other. For instance, suppose one Canadian dollar is enough to purchase one apple in Canada. According to PPP, the U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar exchange rate should be such that when this one Canadian dollar (CAD) is converted into U.S. dollars (USD), the resulting amount of U.S. dollars should also be enough to purchase one apple in the U.S. It is not difficult to realize that PPP is derived from the law of one price. It essentially implies that any freely traded good should be priced the same, everywhere, when measured in the same currency. Keeping with the example above, one apple is priced CAD 1.00 in Canada. Supposing the same apple cost USD 1.40 in the U.S., the exchange rate would have to be 1.4 USD/CAD, so that the price of the apple could be the same in the two countries, when expressed in the same currency. In other words, the expected exchange rate when in equilibrium should be the relationship between the observed prices for the same product in the different currencies, or: USD apple Price apple,USD E USD = = , expected CAD Price apple,CAD CAD apple The law of one price holds because, in the absence of transportation and other transaction costs, competitive markets will equalize the price of an identical good in two countries when the prices are expressed in the same currency. That means that if the USD/CAD exchange rate was 1 USD/CAD instead of 1.4 USD/CAD, for instance, an American could exchange USD 1.00 into CAD 1.00 and buy one apple in Canada instead of paying USD 1.40 for it in the US. What the law of one price tells us is that over a long period of time, as the demand for apples in Canada (and for Canadian dollars) increases and the demand for apples in the US (and for US dollars) decreases, the Canadian dollar is expected to appreciate against the dollar, thus equalizing the purchasing power of the currencies, relative to apples. This is called an “arbitrage”, a general name given to transactions which tend to bring a competitive market to its equilibrium. The main theory behind PPP is simply that the law of one price should hold for all identical products which can be purchased in either one of the two countries. As such, the purchasing power of each currency, as measured by its ability to purchase any of these products, should always be the same. Therefore, according to PPP, exchange rates are defined by the difference in purchasing powers (or prices) between currencies. Likewise, PPP predicts that when the purchasing power of one currency increases (or prices in that currency decreases) relative to another currency, the exchange rate for these currencies should change accordingly. 2\n\n3. XXX-XXX Why Exchange Rates Change: IRP and PPP Prices USD E USD = CAD , expected Prices CAD There are obvious caveats to the law of one price, which in turn affect the practical application of PPP. They include, for instance, transportation costs, barriers to trade and other transaction costs which prevent the existence of “perfect” arbitrages. Also, the law of one price only applies to tradable goods, and does not directly affect immobile goods, such as real estate and local services. The impact of these caveats on the actual application of the PPP concept will be further discussed ahead. PPP and Price Indices As explained above, PPP assumes the existence of a relationship between exchange rates and prices in different countries. However, tracking the prices of all existing products and services across all countries and currencies would be obviously impossible in practical terms. In order to overcome this problem and also be able to apply PPP consistently across countries, prices are usually defined by means of a standard price index. This index is used to represents a defined basket of products (instead of using only apples, for instance), which are both representative of general consumption and comparable across countries. The most common indexes used are variations of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), formed from a standard “basket” of products and services, which represent the average household consumption in any given country. Based on a fixed quantity for each of the items consumed (pounds of meat, gallons of gas, gallons of milk, etc), a total cost for this basket is calculated, determining the CPI for each country and each period. Other popular index is the “Big Mac Index”, a light-hearted survey prepared yearly by The Economist, which uses the price of the famous sandwich in different countries of the world to determine PPP across these countries. Recently, other similar indexes have been proposed, such as the price of a cup of coffee in a Starbucks store, for instance. The advantage of using products as the “Big Mac” as an index for PPP is basically the comparability above and beyond cultural, social and economic differences – the product is supposed to be the same everywhere in the world, while even the most robust CPI calculations may vary. It also provides a more direct understanding for people with no knowledge of economics, when compared to an abstract concept as the CPI. Finally, when compared to a simple product (such as an apple, for example), the “Big Mac” provides price information encompassing all the items required to produce and market the sandwich, including meat, grains, water, labor and energy, among others. The main disadvantage, on the other hand, is that it can never be as comprehensive as the CPI, since it provides the inadequate weight to some important items and no weight at all to other. Furthermore, variations in price positioning due to the company’s different marketing strategies across countries also end up tainting the Big Mac index with spurious information. Analyzing the CPI and other indexes such as the Big Mac index is usually a theoretical exercise, since exchange rates rarely reflect the values obtained with these analyses. Their main application, however, is as a “yardstick” against which to measure current exchange rates: PPP 3\n\n4. XXX-XXX Why Exchange Rates Change: IRP and PPP provides a set of “expected” rates, which are helpful in determining whether a currency is currently under- or overvalued in the market. Also, PPP is usually applied as a “more realistic” exchange rate to compare economic dimensions, such as GDP per capita, across countries. Therefore, when countries have their GDP/capita compared in PPP terms, each figure is being converted to a common currency through the PPP exchange rate. Since GDP/capita can be interpreted as the average consumption level in each country, it makes sense to compare these figures in terms of their real purchasing power. Finally, even when purchasing power parity does not hold in absolute terms, it is usually a rather robust tool for tracking exchange rates’ evolution over time, as we will see ahead. Absolute and Relative PPP Absolute PPP is the concept just explained above: currency exchange rates should converge to an equilibrium where purchasing power is constant for any given currency, when converted into other currencies. Considering the CPI as the adequate measure for prices, this translates into: CPI USD E USD = CAD , expected CPI CAD Relative PPP, on the other hand, holds that the variation of the purchasing power of a currency, relative to another currency, is going to be reflected in the variation of the exchange rate for these two currencies over the same period. That is to say, the change in exchange rates, over any period, equals the difference in the price changes of different countries. An easy way to understand the concept of Relative PPP is to realize that, while Absolute PPP implies Relative PPP, the opposite is not true. In other words, if it is true that the prices for a given product should be the same across different countries, and that exchange rates should reflect that (Absolute PPP), then it is also true that, whenever the price of this product increases in one of the countries and not in the other, the exchange rate should change accordingly (Relative PPP). However, if the relative fluctuations in prices across countries are reflected in exchange rates variations (Relative PPP), it does not necessarily mean that, in absolute terms, purchasing power for a currency should be the same across countries (Absolute PPP). Relative PPP can be derived from Absolute PPP as follows: CPI USD, year 0 E USD = CAD , year 0 CPI CAD, year 0 E USD , year 1 CPI USD, year 1 CPI CAD, year 0 CPI USD, year 1 CPI CAD, year 0 ∆CPI USD ∆E USD = CAD = * = * = CAD E USD CPI CAD, year 1 CPI USD, year 0 CPI USD, year 0 CPI CAD, year 1 ∆CPI CAD , year 0 CAD ∆CPI USD ∆E USD = CAD ∆CPI CAD 4\n\n5. XXX-XXX Why Exchange Rates Change: IRP and PPP We know, however, that inflation rates (π USD and π CAD) are, per definition, the rate of change in prices for any given country/currency. Therefore: (1 + π USD ) ∆E USD = CAD (1 + π CAD ) Relative PPP implies, therefore, that variations in the exchange rate of two currencies are determined by the relation between inflation rates in these two currencies, for the same period. If inflation rates are sufficiently smaller than 1 (as they usually are), we can write, in percent terms: ∆ % E USD = π USD − π CAD CAD For instance, if inflation in the US during 2005 was 3% and in Canada was 1%, then PPP says that the US dollar should have depreciated 2% against the Canadian dollar during that period (∆%E USD/CAD = 2%). In other terms, if prices seem to have increased more in the US than in Canada, then the Canadian dollar must have become “stronger”, so that Canadians can keep using their currency to buy products in the US which now cost more US dollars. The intuition to be built here is that, if a country has faster (greater) inflation rates than other countries, its currency should depreciate against the other currencies over time. Although usually more robust than Absolute PPP, Relative PPP does not always hold either. As mentioned before, several other factors influence exchange rates, and many of the mechanisms which are expected to make PPP hold – such as price arbitrages across countries – are imperfect in most of the cases. A more detailed discussion about practical observations of PPP is presented in the last part of this note. Interest Rate Parity (IRP) Interest rate parity is the other main theory behind exchange rate fluctuation. It establishes a relationship between interest rates and the expected evolution in exchange rates for two different currencies. IRP is normally stated as: two currencies are in equilibrium when the expected rates of return on deposits of these two currencies measured in the same currency are equal. To compare the expected rate of return on deposits in two different currencies, two pieces of information are necessary: each currency’s interest rate and the expected change in the exchange rate between the currencies. Therefore, the basic interest parity condition states that any difference in interest rates should be compensated by the expected change in the exchange rate. For example, suppose interest rates for a one-year deposit in US dollars are 5% and in Japanese Yen are 3%. IRP says that the Japanese Yen (JPY) will have to appreciate against the US dollar during that period, so that by the end of the year the two deposits have provided the same return. To make the example more visible, let us suppose that the JPY/USD exchange rate today is 110 JPY/USD. Imagine someone is investing the same amount of money, US$ 100, in the US and in Japan. To invest this money in Japan, it needs to be exchanged into yen, providing JPY 11,000 (USD 100 * 110 JPY/USD). 5\n\n6. XXX-XXX Why Exchange Rates Change: IRP and PPP Investment in the US Investment in Japan Exchange rate Today USD 100 JPY 11,000 110 JPY/USD One year from now, each investment will have yielded its return in local currency, 5% in the US and 3% in Japan: Investment in the US Investment in Japan Exchange rate Today USD 100 JPY 11,000 110 JPY/USD One year later USD 105 JPY 11,330 ? In order for both investments to provide the same rate of return, the two returns observed must be equal (because the invested amounts were the same). Therefore, USD 105 must be equal to JPY 11,330, and the implied exchange rate is 11,330/105 = 108 JPY/USD. The Yen is expected to appreciate 2% against the dollar during this year. The interest rate parity therefore tells us that, as long as interest rates in the US and in Japan are different by 2 percentage points, the Yen will appreciate 2% against the US dollar each year, so that the rate of return on deposits remains the same. It is important to note that IRP may be contrary to a possible common intuition in this case: the lower interest rate in Japan could suggest that investors would avoid investing in Japanese Yen, and that the reduced demand for the currency would eventually depreciate it. However, that intuition is flawed because it assumes investors are comparing returns based solely on nominal interest rates (5% vs. 3%), while the actual returns are composed of both the nominal rates and the expected variation in the exchange rate. Therefore we can not compare the two deposits and make statements about their demand the way we did with North-American apples. In fact, in a steady state (without variation in interest rates) investors compare the two deposits, in USD and JPY, and conclude that, if both are equally risk-free, then the difference in nominal rates has to be compensated by the appreciation, and not depreciation, of the Yen against the dollar. IRP can be written as: (1 + in, USD ) ∆E USD = JPY (1 + in, JPY ) Where i n is the nominal interest rate in any given currency, and the maturity of this interest rate should be the same as the period considered in ∆E (in this case, one year). If interest rates are sufficiently smaller than 1 (as they usually are), we can write, in percent terms: ∆ % E USD = i n, USD − in, JPY JPY 6\n\n7. XXX-XXX Why Exchange Rates Change: IRP and PPP Something to note about the interest rate parity is that it makes no statement about the absolute exchange rate in any given point in time: it only establishes a rule to determine the variation of exchange rates over a period of time. In this sense, it is more closely related to Relative PPP than to Absolute PPP, as will be seen further ahead. Covered and Uncovered Interest Rate Parity Considering the simplified form of IRP: ∆ % E USD = i n, USD − in, JPY JPY It can be rewritten as: E USD future, JPY − 1 = in, USD − in, JPY E USD JPY ⎛E ⎞ ⎜ future, USD ⎟ in, USD = in, JPY +⎜ JPY − 1⎟ ⎜ E USD ⎟ ⎝ JPY ⎠ where E future is the expected exchange rate for the future (one year from now if we are using one-year interest rates, for instance). This expression basically tells us that the risk-free return rate in US dollars should be the same as the risk-free return rate in Japanese Yen, and that any difference must be attributed to the expected variation in the exchange rate. Based on this expression, the interest rate parity can be established in two ways, which differ on the way they deal with the estimation of the expected exchange rate. Under Covered Interest Parity (CIP), market forward rates are used as the expected exchange rate. It provides a simple and straightforward way to deal with future exchange rates, since forward rates provide an exact rate available today to exchange the currencies in the future. The expression becomes: ⎛ FUSD ⎞ ⎜ JPY ⎟ rn, USD = rn, JPY +⎜ − 1⎟ (CIP) ⎜ E USD ⎟ ⎝ JPY ⎠ where F is the forward rate for the two considered currencies, in the considered period (one- year forward, in this case). This relationship is called “covered” because the currency risks have been covered by the forward contract. In other words, if the relationship holds today, the expected return rates will be 7\n\n8. XXX-XXX Why Exchange Rates Change: IRP and PPP observed in the future, regardless of what really happens to the exchange rate one year from now. This is because the future exchange rate has been “locked” at today’s forward rate. In fact, the Covered Interest Parity is observed in practice for most of the cases, simply because it is actually the main tool used to price forward contracts. That is to say, forward contracts are priced by considering that the difference in nominal interest rates is the main driver behind the expected variation in exchange rates. The main reason for that is, if forward contracts were not priced according to CIP, then arbitrage opportunities would appear, eventually forcing the market into equilibrium again. Assume for example that i USD = 7%, i GBP = 3%, the current spot exchange rate is EUSD/GBP=1.20 and the forward rate in one year is FUSD/GBP=1.26. In this situation, the interest rate differential between the US and the UK is equal to 4% (7% - 3%) and the expected rate of depreciation of the US dollar is 5% (F/E - 1 = 5%). CIP tells us that the interest rate differential and the expected exchange rate should be the same, so there must be an arbitrage opportunity. In fact, an investor could profit from this situation with no risk by borrowing USD 100 in the US, transforming the money into 100/1.20 = GBP 83.33 and investing in the UK for one year at 3%, getting GBP 85.83. If a forward contract is established today, at 1.26 USD/GBP, then these pounds can be converted one year from now, risk-free, to USD 108.15. The debt to be paid back is USD 107 (USD 100 plus 7% interest), so there would be a profit of USD 1.15. That is why, in order to keep the market equilibrium and eliminate arbitrage opportunities, the forward rate FUSD/GBP should be E USD/GBP + 4% (since the interest rate differential is 4%). Therefore, FUSD/GBP = 1.248 for a one-year forward contract. Under Uncovered Interest Parity (UIP), the actual expected spot rate in the future is used instead of the forward rate as E future. UIP is harder to test because there is no direct data on expectations. Most economists use the actual future exchange rate to test, ex-post, whether the parity would have held. ⎛E ⎞ ⎜ future, USD ⎟ rn, USD = rn, JPY +⎜ JPY − 1⎟ (UIP) ⎜ E USD ⎟ ⎝ JPY ⎠ This parity is called “uncovered” because the currency risk has not been taken care of. That is to say, even if the parity holds today (because of the expected exchange rate Efuture), an investor may still not have the same return rates in USD and JPY, simply because the actual exchange rate one year from now may be different from the expected Efuture. Also, the UIP is not as likely to hold because there is no opportunity for arbitrages that would restore the equilibrium when the parity did not hold. In fact, there is no simple way to establish risk-free arbitrages under UIP. An investor trying to do it would always have to deal with the fact that his/her expectations about the exchange rate might simply not come true in the end. The reason why it makes sense to discuss covered and uncovered parities is that forward rates and actual future exchange rates rarely coincide. This phenomenon is called forward 8\n\n9. XXX-XXX Why Exchange Rates Change: IRP and PPP premium puzzle, and it implies that forward rates are in fact poor (or biased) predictors of the actual future rates. That is why, even when covered parity holds, uncovered parity usually does not. Several factors seem to contribute to this puzzle, and many economists have tried to prove whether it is mainly the effect of a risk premium being charged by exchange rate markets when pricing forward rates. More of these factors are discussed in the last part of this note. Reconciling IRP and PPP As mentioned previously, PPP and IRP, although apparently disconnected at first, are in fact two aspects of the same economic reality. If we examine IRP in one of its simplified forms: ∆ % E USD = in,USD − in, JPY JPY And we also consider the simplified form of Relative PPP for the same two currencies: ∆ %E USD = π USD − π JPY JPY We arrive at: i n, USD − i n, JPY = π USD − π JPY Therefore, if we are to consider both IRP and PPP simultaneously, the conclusion is that the differential in nominal interest rates must equal the expected inflation difference for the same period. If we consider that nominal interest rates are actually composed by real interest rates (i real) and the effect of inflation for the period (π), or, in percent terms: in = ireal + π we conclude from the last two expressions that: ireal,USD = i real,JPY That is, for both IRP and PPP to be valid, real interest rates must be the same everywhere. This conclusion is consistent with the argument that risk-free deposits should have the same real returns, regardless of the currency they are made in. Investors should be geographically unbiased in their choice of investments, and expect the same real return from equally risk-free assets. In other terms, what PPP tells us is that differences in the inflation rates across countries/currencies will be reflected in exchange rates. IRP, on the other hand, states that these changes in exchange rates are directly connected to differences in nominal interest rates for the same countries/currencies. A final, elegant way to reconcile the two concepts is to think of them as mechanisms through which occurrences in any given currency are propagated to others and equalized. PPP represents 9\n\n10. XXX-XXX Why Exchange Rates Change: IRP and PPP equalizations made through the country’s current account: differences in prices cause commercial arbitrages, with goods being purchased across borders. IRP represents the equalizations made through the country’s capital account: differences in rates of return cause financial arbitrages, with investments being made across borders. Two mechanisms, one single process which links exchange rates with the other elements of economic reality. Theory and practice: do PPP and IRP really hold? As mentioned earlier in this note, these two parities are not necessarily always observed in practical terms. Even though they are based in concepts supposed to be consistent and robust, exchange rates have a very volatile nature and few conclusions can be made by analyzing any single piece of data over a limited period of time. In general, parities seem to hold more, whenever arbitrage opportunities are more easily exercisable. Purchasing Power Parity Absolute PPP is not necessarily observed in practice and, in fact, is most useful as a reference against which to compare real exchange rates. Exhibit 1 shows the “Big Mac Index” for several countries, along with the implied over- or undervaluation of their currencies. Relative PPP is sometimes a reasonable approximation to the data, but it also usually performs badly. Exhibit 2 demonstrates PPP’s limitation by plotting for six different countries (UK, Japan, Canada, Brazil, India and Mexico) the evolution of the exchange rate and the ratio of each country’s price levels to the US price level. Relative PPP predicts that these two series should move in proportion, but they actually do not. Only considering longer time period (the entire 7-year period), relative PPP seems to be approximately satisfied in some countries. PPP is mainly limited by the assumptions underlying the law of one price, which basically considers the world as one single competitive marketplace. These limitations include: • Transport costs and restrictions on trade exist, and may be high enough to prevent some goods and services from being traded; other goods, such as real estate and local services, simply cannot be traded in a global scale • Different competitive environment (e.g. monopolistic and oligopolistic practices) in different markets weaken the link between prices of similar goods sold in different countries • Different methodologies of calculating inflation data between countries (e.g. different basket of goods since consumptions patterns are different) imply that there is no reason for exchange rate changes to offset differences in “official” measures of inflation 10\n\n11. XXX-XXX Why Exchange Rates Change: IRP and PPP Covered Interest Parity CIP holds for currencies in developed countries. As Exhibit 3 demonstrates, for UK, Japan, and Canada, the one-year interest rate differential between each of those countries and the US equals the variation in exchange rates implied by the spot and forward exchange rates in one- year. The small difference (less than 0.1pp) can be attributed to the transaction costs so that in fact there are no arbitrage opportunities to be exploited. As explained before, this results from the fact that forward rates in these countries are actually priced according to CIP. On the other hand, in developing countries, empirical analysis demonstrates that CIP does not hold, especially during times of economic turbulence. Exhibit 4 shows how, in Brazil, Mexico and India, investors require an interest rate differential higher than the covered exchange rate projected depreciation. The main issues which restrict CIP from holding in these countries are: • Political risk and capital controls: Even after the currency risks have been covered by a forward contract, other risks for having investments abroad must be accounted for, increasing the demanded interest rate differential. Specifically in developing economies, investors may want to account for the risk that governments may impose regulations preventing the free movement of foreign funds across national borders (capital controls). • Transaction costs: In developing countries, forward contracts may have significant transaction costs, especially for currencies with low liquidity. • Individual borrowing constraints and other market restrictions: developing economies sometimes lack mechanisms and intermediaries required for arbitrages to be performed effectively. These gaps lead to permanent discrepancies between interest rate differentials and expected exchange rate changes. Uncovered Interest Parity As we have seen, UIP is harder to test, simply because it involves assessing the expected future exchange rate, a largely unobservable variable. Although surveys have been conducted to assess expectations on future rates, for most studies economists have considered that “rational expectations” in exchange markets can be assumed. That means that any difference between current expectations of future exchange rates and the actually observed future exchange rates can be considered “random noise”. In other terms, for the purpose of verifying the validity of UIP, real exchange rates – “lagged” by a constant period of time – can be used as an estimate for expected future exchange rates. The only difference is that an error component would be assumed, however unrelated to the other variables being considered. That is: ∆ %E USD = (i n, USD − i n, JPY ) + error JPY In order to circumvent this error, UIP validation attempts focus on correlating the observed exchange rate variation (∆%E USD/JPY) with the differential in interest rates (i USD – i JPY). Validity of UIP implies that the coefficient obtained in this correlation (β) must be 1. 11\n\n12. XXX-XXX Why Exchange Rates Change: IRP and PPP Innumerous analyses have shown that UIP does not hold in the short term, as can be seen in Exhibit 5 for the one-year period example. Rather, much more common, is the finding that exchange rates move in the opposite direction of the expected, i.e. that the correlation coefficient (β) is negative2. Recently, it has been demonstrated that, when tested using financial data covering a sufficiently large period of time, UIP actually holds3. Exhibit 6 displays the results of these analyses. Attempts to explain these results are very controversial. Some economists argue that UIP is simply a theoretical abstraction and therefore it should not be observed in the real exchange markets. Others try to adapt the theory, including new variables to better try to fit the data into sophisticated prediction models. Finally, some of the arguments are associated with the forward premium puzzle, i.e., base their reasoning in the fact that forward rates are not good predictors of actual future exchange rates. Here are some of these theories: • Time-varying risk premium4: expected return rates actually carry a risk premium which varies over time, and this masks the occurrence of UIP. The main assumption behind this hypothesis is that risk-free interest-bearing assets are not seen as equally risk-free by investors, and this perceived risk is not easily modeled. • Home bias and other biases: even though the currency market and the market for interest- bearing assets is much more dynamic than the goods markets that influence PPP, they are far from being perfect. Many investors are not completely free (or willing) to diversify into other assets, even when they seem to be more attractive. For instance, investments tend to be made predominantly in the investor’s homeland, even if real return rates are less attractive (home bias). This restricts the arbitrages that would bring the market into equilibrium and make UIP valid. • Temporary distortions: through government policy and manipulation of “herd effects”, an exchange rate can be sustained at artificially high levels. Similarly, interest rates may be forced to remain excessively high in times of lack of confidence in international markets. These momentary “aberrations” may be sufficient to significantly alter the behavior of exchange rates, causing the parities to be unobservable over short periods of time. • Influence of policymakers5: policymakers adjust interest rates in order to keep exchange rates stable, and they are interested in smoothing interest rate movements. When the apparent irrational movements of exchange rates and interest rates are modeled with that in mind, UIP seems to be consistent with part of the short-term contradictions observed. • Self-solving problem: a final hypothesis is that the whole controversy of IRP holding or not has prevented investors from effectively equalizing the market in the past. Now that it has become known that UIP does not hold in several situations and therefore that implies the existence of arbitrage opportunities, many investors (such as hedge funds, for instance) are going after assets priced in an unbalanced way (such as high yield 2 Froot and Thaler (1990) and Mussa (1979), for instance, arrived at coefficients ranging from -0.5 to -3, instead of the expected unity. 3 Chinn and Meredith (2004) 4 Domowitz and Hakkio (1985) 5 McCallum (1994a) 12\n\n13. XXX-XXX Why Exchange Rates Change: IRP and PPP currencies) in order to profit from the situation. Eventually, some argue, these arbitrages will bring the market to an equilibrium and UIP will be observable in future data. Conclusion Many economists still dispute the real applicability of these parities, but most of them seem to agree that Interest Rate Parities and Purchasing Power Parities can be seen as underlying economic truths influencing exchange rates. One possible analogy is the price of a company’s stock, determined not only by the company’s real economic performance but also by the “noise” caused by market dynamics and speculation. In the same way, the exchange rate market can be seen as driven by economic fundamentals such as IRP and PPP, but also subject to other effects which sometimes prevent an observer from identifying the effect of these parities in practical terms. 13"
