He fought on the front lines of World War I, and in his writings he frequently returned to the battlefield and its repercussions, and pondered the gulf between Catholic faith and freethinking atheism. His Un Taciturne (The Silent One) was significant for its open albeit bleak treatment of a gay protagonist, and he wrote a series of eight novels collectively called Les Thibault, which tell the story of Jacques Thibault and his bourgeoisie family as they dealt with the political, personal, and practical issues of World War I. Well-received in his native France, the English translation of Les Thibault sold so poorly in America that latter volumes were never released there. He wrote five hundred pages of his last novel, Lieutenant-Colonel de Maumort, toiling over it for seventeen years, and decades after his death it was rather unsatisfactorily completed from another 300 pages of his notes. To present-day readers, du Gard may be best known for his book about his long-time friend and lover, fellow Nobel laureate André Gide.\n\nFather: (attorney)\n\nWife: Hèléne Foucault (m. 1906, div.)\n\nDaughter: Christiane du Gard\n\nBoyfriend: André Gide (author)\n\nUniversity: BS Paleography, University of Paris\n\nNobel Prize for Literature 1937\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nL'Abbaye de Jumieges (1909)\n\nDevenir!
