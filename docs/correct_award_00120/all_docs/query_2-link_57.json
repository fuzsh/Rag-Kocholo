        "text": "Roger Martin du Gard came from a conservative catholic family of lawyers. He studied literature at the Sorbonne from 1898 to 1900, but switched to the École des Chartes, a school for librarians. He worked as archivist and specialised in old handwritings but he already knew that he wanted to be a writer.\n\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts at writing novels he published \"Devenier!\" in 1913 and \"Jean Barois\" appeared during the same year. Inthe First World War he served in the army. In 1920 he withdrew to his estate Bellême and he only left it when he fled to Nice during the Second World War. In 1922 he started his main work, \"Les Thibault\" (1922-1940). After he and his wife were seriously injured in a car crash in 1931 he continued \"Les Thibault\" in a different style. In 1937 he won the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nHis last work \"Le lieutenant-colonel de Maumort\" was unfinished when he died in Bellême in 1958."
