It anticipates some of the thematic material of Les Thibault . Largely in dialogue form, Jean Barois is the story of a life deeply divided by two world views, that of the Catholic Church and that of a freethinking, unflinching, humanistic philosophy of facing and mastering reality. In 1920 he published the peasant farce . He became attached to the circle of the and was close to Gide , Copeau, and J. Schlumberger.\n\nLes Thibault , which culminates in the three volumes of Summer 1914 ]. The twelve individual volumes of the series of novels appeared between 1922 and 1940.\n\nLes Thibault is a monumental picture of the world before the outbreak of the First World War. Its rambling plot traces the history of Jacques Thibault, the rebel son of an upper middle-class family, against the background of the more staid destinies of his relatives. The work gives a detailed account of the hero's despair at the outbreak of fighting and the failure of his insane attempt to stop it.

Martin du Gard was originally trained as an archivist and expert in old handwriting. His literary fame rests on his eight-part novel The World of the Thibaults , which continued the tradition of Stendhal and Tolstoy in its wide historical scope. In his works Martin du Gard often juxtaposed two different characters and studied through their conflict philosophical and religious problems. \"One can love the people and not be able to stand their ongoing company. One can love the populace and not like to live with the individuals who compose it. Their ways of being and of thinking, their ways of being happy or unhappy, their desires, their welfare, their joys, their emotions, their sensitivity, their reactions are not my own; and I am a foreigner among them. My climate is not theirs. Whenever circumstances have forced me into contact with them, I have suffered from it.\" (from Lieutenant-Colonel de Maumort Roger Martin du Gard was born in the Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine.

Trained as a paleographer and archivist, Martin du Gard brought to his works a spirit of objectivity and a scrupulous regard for details. For his concern with documentation and with the relationship of social reality to individual development, he has been linked with the realist and naturalist traditions of the 19th century. Martin du Gard first attracted attention with Jean Barois (1913), which traced the development of an intellectual torn between the Roman Catholic faith of his childhood and the scientific materialism of his maturity; it also described the full impact of the Dreyfus affair on French minds. He is best known for the eight-part novel cycle Les Thibault (1922-40; parts 1-6 as The Thibaults; parts 7-8 as Summer 1914 ).
