        "text": "Career\n\nApart from the four years he spent with a motor-transport unit in World War I, and a brief period immediately before and after working at the Vieux-Colombier Theater with Jacques Copeau, he spent his whole life in seclusion, completely dedicated to his writing.\n\nHis first novel, Devenir! (1908), portrayed a would-be writer whose life was a series of failures. Jean Barois (1913) analyzed the dilemma of an intellectual torn, like his whole generation, between religion and scientific materialism; it is especially notable for its very full treatment of the Dreyfus case.\n\nMartin du Gard also wrote of French country life in Le Testament du PèrePere Leleu (1913) and La Gonfle (1928), two farces in the fabliau tradition, and in Vieille France (1933), bitterly realistic sketches of an imaginary village. He treated problems of sexual abnormality in Confidence Africaine (1931), which deals with incest, and in Un Taciturne (1931), a naturalistic drama on homosexuality.\n\nHe also published a volume of frank reminiscences on André Gide, Notes sur André Gide (1951). Martin du Gard's reputation at present rests on Les Thibault (1922-1940; The World of the Thibaults), a cyclical novel in eight parts. The chief characters are two brothers, Jacques and Antoine Thibault, who react in opposing ways to life in a bourgeois environment. The outstanding features of Les Thibault are the graphic account of the father's death in the sixth volume, La Mort du Père; the dramatic descriptions of the Paris scene on the eve of war in the seventh volume, L'Eté 1914; and the patient exploration of the relationships between the brothers and their friends and relations throughout the whole series.\n\nLe Journal du Colonel Maumort, a vast novel on which Martin du Gard worked during the final 18 years of his life, was never completed."
