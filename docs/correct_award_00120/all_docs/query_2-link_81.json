        "text": "In the late 1930s and early 1940s, Roger Martin du Gard was one of the most famous writers in the Western world. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1937, and his works, especially Les Thibault, a multivolume novel, were translated into English and read widely. Today, this close friend of Andre Gide, Albert Camus, and Andre Malraux is almost unknown, largely because he left unfinished the long project he began in the 1940s, Lieutenant Colonel de Maumort. Initially, the novel is an account of the French experience during World War II and the German occupation as seen through the eyes of a retired army officer. Yet, through Maumort's series of recollections, it becomes a morality tale that questions the values of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century European civilization. A fragmentary version of the novel was published in 1983, twenty-five years after its author's death, and an English translation appeared in 1999. Even incomplete, it is a work of haunting brilliance. In this groundbreaking study, Benjamin Franklin Martin recovers the life and times of Roger Martin du Gard and those closest to him. He describes the genius of Martin du Gard's literature and the causes of his decline by analyzing thousands of pages from journals and correspondence. To the outside world, the writer and his family were staid representatives of the French bourgeoisie. Behind this veil of secrecy, however, they were passionate and combative, tearing each other apart through words and deeds in clashes over life, love, and faith. Martin interweaves their accounts with the expert narration that distinguishes all of his books, creating a blend of intellectual history, family drama, and biography that will appeal to scholars, students, and general readers alike.\n\n“\"The resulting biography... avoids discussion of the writing beyond plot summaries repeated from Martin's previous book on post-First World War France. This is a conventional approach--Martin confesses to being 'traditional and old-fashioned'--but, even on these terms, it sheds little new light on Martin du Gard himself and still less on his creations, beyond seeing them as 'romans-”\n\nIn this rigorously researched and well-written volume, Benjamin Franklin Martin sheds light on the life and creative genius of Roger Martin du Gard, a figure who, despite winning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1937, has become somewhat marginalized in French literary history.\n\nFrench History\n\nBenjamin Franklin Martin's literary biography of Roger Martin du Gard, who won the 1937 Nobel Prize for Literature, is an impressive achievement.\n\nThe Key Reporter\n\nMartin weaves throughout his subject's journal, correspondence, and works, and brings to light (and life) the complexity that lurked behind the public persona of the world-renowned 1937 recipient of the Nobel Prize. Highly recommended.\n\nChoice\n\nBenjamin Franklin Martin is the Katheryn J., Lewis C., and Benjamin Price Professor of History at Louisiana State University. He is the author of six previous books, among them, The Hypocrisy of Justice in the Belle Epoque and Years of Plenty, Years of Want: France and the Legacy of the Great War (NIU Press, 2013). He has been a consulting scholar to the Jewish Museum in New York for the celebrated exhibition \"The Dreyfus Affair: Art, Truth and Justice,\" and a featured contributor to documentaries by The History Channel."
