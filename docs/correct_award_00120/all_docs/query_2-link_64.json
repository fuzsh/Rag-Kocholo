        "text": "Roger Martin du Gard won the Nobel Prize for his novel cycle Les Thibault, but the following text is from his book Notes on André Gide: The door is pushed ajar. A man sidles into the shop, as a down-and-out slips into the warmth of a church. His eyes are hidden behind the brim of a battered old hat; and enveloping cloak hangs down from his shoulders. He looks like an old, half-starved, out-of-work actor; or like one of those behoemian wrecks who end up in a doss-house when their luck’s right out; or else like one of those habitués of the Bibliothèque Nationale, professional copyists with their dubious collars and cuffs, who fall asleep on their folios in the middle of the day after lunching off a croissant.\n\nOr an unfrocked priest, perhaps? An unfrocked priest with a bad conscience? Gautier accused Renan of having kept his ‘parsonical look’ . . . . But they all go to greet him; evidently he has something to do with the magazine. He takes off his hat and his cloak; his shapeless, outworn travelling-suit doesn’t seem to belong to his awkward limbs; his detachable collar, frayed and hanging loose, reveals a neck like that of some elderly bird; the hair recedes from the forehead and is beginning to turn grey; tufty above the coat-collar, it looks drab, as if it were dead at the roots. The Mongol mask, in which the oblique ridges of the brow predomoninate, is flawed by wards. The features are emphatic, but flaccid; the complexion is grayish, the cheeks hollow and ill-shaven; the line of the thin-set lips is sinuous and elastic; there is no candour in the eyes, as they hover beneath the eyelids, and with the momentary flashing glance there goes a smile that is almost a grimace; a smile at once childlike and sly, at once timid and rehearsed.Schlumberger brings him over to me. I am dumbfounded: it is André Gide….\n\n……………………………\n\ntranslated by John Russell"
