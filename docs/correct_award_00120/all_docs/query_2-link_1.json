        "text": "Roger Martin du Gard (born March 23, 1881, Neuilly-sur-Seine, France—died Aug. 22, 1958, Bellême) was a French author and winner of the 1937 Nobel Prize for Literature. Trained as a paleographer and archivist, Martin du Gard brought to his works a spirit of objectivity and a scrupulous regard for details. For his concern with documentation and with the relationship of social reality to individual development, he has been linked with the realist and naturalist traditions of the 19th century.\n\nMartin du Gard first attracted attention with Jean Barois (1913), which traced the development of an intellectual torn between the Roman Catholic faith of his childhood and the scientific materialism of his maturity; it also described the full impact of the Dreyfus affair on French minds. He is best known for the eight-part novel cycle Les Thibault (1922–40; parts 1–6 as The Thibaults; parts 7–8 as Summer 1914). This record of a family’s development chronicles the social and moral issues confronting the French bourgeoisie from the turn of the 19th century to World War I. Reacting against a bourgeois patriarch, the younger son, Jacques, renounces his Roman Catholic past to embrace revolutionary socialism, and the elder son, Antoine, accepts his middle-class heritage but loses faith in its religious foundation. Both sons eventually die in World War I. The outstanding features of Les Thibaults are the wide range of human relationships patiently explored, the graphic realism of the sickbed and death scenes, and, in the seventh volume, L’Été 1914 (“Summer 1914”), the dramatic description of Europe’s nations being swept into war."
