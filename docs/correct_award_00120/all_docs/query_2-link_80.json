        "text": "STOCKHOLM, Sweden | France's Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clezio won the 2008 Nobel Prize in literature on Thursday for works characterized by \"poetic adventure and sensual ecstasy\" and focused on the environment, especially the desert.\n\nLe Clezio, 68, is the first French writer to win the prestigious award since Chinese-born Frenchman Gao Xingjian was honored in 2000 and the 14th since the Nobel Prizes began in 1901.\n\nThe decision was in line with the Swedish Academy's recent picks of European authors and followed days of vitriolic debate about whether the jury was anti-American.\n\nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy hailed Le Clezio's win as a sign of France's worldwide cultural influence.\n\n\"A child of Mauritius and Nigeria, a teenager in Nice, a nomad of the American and African deserts, Jean-Marie Le Clezio is a citizen of the world, the son of all continents and cultures,\" Sarkozy said. \"A great traveler, he embodies the influence of France, its culture and its values in a globalized world.\"\n\nThe academy called Le Clezio, who also holds Mauritian citizenship, an \"author of new departures, poetic adventure and sensual ecstasy, explorer of a humanity beyond and below the reigning civilization.\"\n\nLe Clezio made his breakthrough as a novelist with \"Desert,\" in 1980, a work the academy said \"contains magnificent images of a lost culture in the North African desert contrasted with a depiction of Europe seen through the eyes of unwanted immigrants.\"\n\nThat novel, which also won Le Clezio a prize from the French Academy, is considered a masterpiece. It describes the ordeal of Lalla, a woman from the Tuareg nomadic tribe of the Sahara Desert, as she adapts to civilization imposed by colonial France.\n\nThe Swedish Academy said Le Clezio from early on \"stood out as an ecologically engaged author, an orientation that is accentuated with the novels 'Terra Amata,' 'The Book of Flights,' 'War' and 'The Giants.'\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Paris, Le Clezio described feeling waves of emotion upon hearing the news. \"(I felt) some kind of incredulity, and then some kind of awe, and then some kind of joy and mirth,\" he said.\n\nThe newest Nobel laureate also insisted that French culture was not dead - as Time magazine had claimed in an article last year.\n\n\"I deny it,\" said the globe-trotting writer. \"It's a very rich, very diversified culture. There's no risk of decline.\"\n\nLe Clezio said one of the reasons why French culture is so rich is because it has been influenced by French-speaking countries around the world.\n\nHe also singled out American writer Philip Roth as someone he felt should win a Nobel.\n\n\"Philip Roth is a very great writer, I think he will certainly have the prize,\" Le Clezio said. \"But even if he doesn't get it, he's still a very great writer.\"\n\nLe Clezio was already planning to travel to Sweden later this month to receive another award - the Stig Dagerman prize, which honors efforts to promote the freedom of expression.\n\nSince Japanese writer Kenzaburo Oe won the award in 1994, the selections have had a distinctly European flavor. Since then 12 Europeans, including Le Clezio and last year's winner Doris Lessing of Britain, have won the prize. The last U.S. writer to win the prize was Toni Morrison in 1993.\n\nLast week, Academy Permanent Secretary Horace Engdahl told The Associated Press that the United States is too insular and ignorant to challenge Europe as the center of the literary world. The comments ignited a fierce reaction across the Atlantic, where the head of the U.S. National Book Foundation offered to send Engdahl a reading list.\n\n\"I was very surprised that the reaction was so violent. I don't think that what I said was that derogatory or sensational,\" Engdahl told AP after Thursday's prize announcement.\n\nHe added his comments had been \"perhaps a bit too generalizing.\"\n\nAsked how he thought the choice of Le Clezio would be received in the United States, he said he had no idea.\n\n\"He's not a particularly French writer, if you look at him from a strictly cultural point of view. So I don't think this choice will give rise to any anti-French comments,\" he said. \"I would be very sad if that was the case.\"\n\nLe Clezio has spent much time living in New Mexico in recent years. He has long shied away from public life and often traveled, especially to the world's deserts. The academy said he and his Moroccan wife, Jemia, split their time between Albuquerque, N.M., Mauritius and Nice.\n\nHe has published several dozen books, including novels, essays and children's books. His most famous works are tales of nomads, mediations on the desert and childhood memories. He has also explored the mythologies of native Americans.\n\nThe academy said Le Clezio's long stays in Mexico and Central America in the mid-1970s had a decisive influence on his work.\n\nBorn in Nice in 1940, Le Clezio was eight when his family moved to Nigeria, where his father had been a doctor during World War II. They returned to France in 1950. Le Clezio tells the story of his father in his 2004 work, \"L'Africain.\"\n\nBesides the 10 million kronor ($1.4 million) check, Le Clezio will also receive a gold medal and be invited to lecture at the academy's headquarters in Stockholm's Old Town.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in literature is handed out in Stockholm on Dec. 10 - the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896 - along with the awards in medicine, chemistry, physics and economics. The Nobel Peace Prize is presented in Oslo, Norway.\n\n[ Associated Press writers Malin Rising and Louise Nordstrom in Stockholm, Alfred de Montesquiou in Algiers, Angela Doland in Paris and Hillel Italie in New York contributed to this report. ]\n\nFrenchmen Have Won Award 14 Times STOCKHOLM, Sweden | France's literary heritage has been a part of the Nobel Prize in literature since the first one was awarded in 1901 to Sully Prudhomme, who wrote under the pen-name Francois Armand Prudhomme. Since then, 14 French writers have received the prize, including Albert Camus in 1957. All of them welcomed it save for Jean-Paul Sartre, who famously declined it in 1964, citing his principle of rejecting all official honors. The figure does not include the 1933 laureate, Ivan Bunin, who was born in Russia but held a stateless domicile in France when he won the prize. One notable thing about the French winners of the prize รณ they all are men. Other French winners include Claude Simon, who won in 1985; Saint-John Perse, the pen name of Alexis Leger, who won in 1960; Andre Paul Guillaume Gide, who won in 1947; and Roger Martin du Gard, who won the prize in 1937.\n\nNOBEL FACTS"
