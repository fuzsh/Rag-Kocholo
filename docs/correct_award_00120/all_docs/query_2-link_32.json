        "text": "May 2, 2013\n\nRoger Martin du Gard is sadly unknown to English-language—and even to many current-day French—readers despite his place in the modern canon, Nobel Prize and all else. A pity, that: this writer is up there with Camus, Gide (whom he wrote some of the best criticism of, incidently) and even I would daresay, Proust. Martin du Gard is often said to have garnered the Nobel in Literature for his epic tale of a modern French family, their dramas, their transitions towards a new type of life and a new, evolving world: these books, the Thibault cycle, is not really the easiest place to start with Martin du Gard but again, his best-known work. A better introduction would be (especially for someone looking to read him in English) Lieutenant-Colonel de Maumort: A Novel . The Thibaults however are essential reading for anyone interested in either Martin du Gard as an author or in the transition of France in the early twentieth century towards the contemporary/late-modern world. The lives of brothers Antoine and Jacques Thibault won't be everyone's cup of tea: for one, the novel cycle is neither soap opera nor the type of social novel we know from current writers or even those like Jane Austen: it's something more akin to Downton Abbey as retold by Proust with ample edits by someone like Céline. It's sprawling but unlike soap operas of today or yesteryear, it's not comic or overly dramatic but takes itself pretty seriously as if we really really are on the edges of our seats to know how the Thibaults fare. Which isn't to say we're not, and Martin du Gard's prose is beautiful, but it runs into writing akin to biography in places where you wonder if the details are being included for a sense of history or some other sake. And this happens over the course of no less than eight full, robust novels. It will keep you busy a while. Best read in French, but I expect there is also an English translation availible—there ought to be, at least."
