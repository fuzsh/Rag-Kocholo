        "text": "Roger Martin du Gard\n\nRoger Martin du Gard won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1937. He dedicated most of his life to a single work, an eight-part novel-cycle with the collective title, Les Thibault (1922-1940). This long series of novels is best known for the artistic power and truth with which they depicted human conflict, as well as some fundamental aspects of life in France during the ten years preceding the First World War. A longtime and intimate friend of Andre Gide, the “notes” are excerpts from his journal.\n\nBooks:"
