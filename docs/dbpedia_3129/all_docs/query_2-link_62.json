        "text": "If you have visited Hilton Head Island’s beaches, you are probably familiar with Shore Beach Service. We are on the beach in the lifeguard highchairs, under the blue & gray umbrellas, or driving the red beach patrol vehicles. If you are new to the island, let us help you have a great vacation!\n\nHilton Head Island is blessed with some of the safest waters on the east coast, as gentle sloping beaches and offshore sandbars generally create calm surf conditions. However, always be cautious in the ocean and please follow our beach safety tips and beach rules to ensure a safe and enjoyable day.\n\nServing Hilton Head since 1974, Shore Beach Service is the island’s premier beach equipment rental service. We provide the rental of umbrellas and chairs anywhere throughout the beach.\n\nWe are the only company on Hilton Head Island that can set up the equipment for you anywhere on the beach daily, saving you the hassle so you can have a more relaxing and enjoyable vacation.\n\nSee our Rentals page for rates and other info.\n\nWE ARE OPEN FOR 2024!\n\nShore Beach Service provides the beach patrol for Hilton Head Island’s 13.5 miles of beach. The beach patrol includes about 80 lifeguards from across the country and around the world.\n\nAs a member of the South Atlantic region of the United States Lifesaving Association (USLA) since 1989 and a Certified Agency of the USLA for Open Water Lifeguarding since 1995, our lifeguards are held to the USLA’s high standards of training. We are always looking for physically fit individuals with outstanding customer service skills to join our team."
