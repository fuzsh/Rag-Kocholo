        "text": "SAVING LIVES SINCE 1910\n\nSurf Life Saving New Zealand (SLSNZ) is the leading beach and coastal safety, drowning prevention and rescue authority in Aotearoa. We are truly unique, delivering proactive lifeguarding and essential emergency rescue services, a range of public education beach safety programmes, member education, training and development, as well as a highly respected sport.\n\nWe do all this as a charity and rely on the generosity of the public, commercial partners, foundations and trusts for donations and financial contributions in order to lead and support our incredible front-line volunteer lifeguarding services. SLSNZ is the national association representing 74 surf lifesaving clubs with 18,000+ members, including more than 4,500 volunteer Surf Lifeguards. Our lifeguards patrol over 80 locations each summer and provide emergency call-out rescue services throughout Aotearoa, saving hundreds of lives each year and ensuring thousands return home safe after a day at the beach.\n\nEven though our volunteer Surf Lifeguards have kept thousands of people safe on our beaches and saved thousands of lives, New Zealandâ€™s beach and coastal fatal drowning rates have increased over the last 5 years compared to the previous 5 years. We are committed to changing this. Our vision is \"no-one drowns on our beaches\". It's what drives us and why we are \"In It For Life\"."
