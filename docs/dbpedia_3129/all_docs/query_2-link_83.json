        "text": "Surf lifesaving originated in Australia in 1906 in response to drownings at local beaches in Sydney. Such groups became necessary following the relaxing of laws prohibiting daylight bathing on Australian beaches. Volunteer groups of men were trained in life saving methods and patrolled the beaches as lifesavers looking after public safety.\n\nThe original surf life saving club is a matter of contention between the Bronte and Bondi beach clubs in Sydney. Bronte Surf Lifesaving Club claims to be the “First Surf Club in the World since 1903”. This is based on minutes of a meeting held in 1907 (found at the local library in 1982), which was noted to be the fourth AGM of the club, as well as a time capsule from 1931 (unearthed during renovations of the club house) in which documents record then President and Gen. Secretary of Surf Lifesaving Australia unanimously declaring Bronte to be the first club. The Bondi Surf Bathers Life Saving Club also claims to be the “world’s first life saving club”. It was officially established on February 21, 1907 at the Royal Hotel in Bondi.\n\nThis multifaceted movement comprising of voluntary lifeguard service and the competitive surf sport expanded globally and in 1955, the Surf Life Saving Great Britain (SLSGB) organisation was formed with clubs in Wales establishing themselves in the 1960s later forming the Surf Lifesaving Association of Wales in 1969.\n\nThe Surf Lifesaving Association of Wales (SLSA Wales) has voluntary surf lifesaving clubs across the Welsh coast and all hole the same values, standards of training and service provision. All clubs patrol their designated beaches or designated area and are on hand to offer first aid and rescue assistance to those in need. SLSA Wales itself trains and educates its members, of all ages in surf life saving skills, beach safety and first aid via a range of comprehensive awards, courses and qualifications.\n\nThe main qualification on offer is the internationally recognised National Vocational Beach Lifeguard Qualification (NVBLQ) which is the preference for RNLI Lifeguards and many other employees. Qualifications can also range from shore based first aid and life support to the Welsh Ambulance Service First Responder. This proves that surf lifesaving can not only offer the opportunities to keep fit through the sport but will also enhance your lifesaving skill level, making you better equipped to deal with emergency situations."
