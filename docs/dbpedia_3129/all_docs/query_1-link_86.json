        "text": "Over sixty members of Isle of Wight Scouts have joined 8,000 other Scouts and Guides at the Essex International Jamboree 2024 at Boyton Cross near Chelmsford, Essex.\n\nThe Isle of Wight Scouts Contingent comprising 50 young people aged 10 to 17 and 14 adult volunteers departed from East Cowes on Saturday (27th July) morning.\n\nThe contingent reached the jamboree site at Boynton Wood at 3:30pm and were met by the advance party of six adult volunteers who had driven to the site the day before. The Contingent are camping on the Nile Sub-Camp, one of 11 Sub Camps named after river systems.\n\nTransformed by 1,500 volunteers\n\nThe 120-acre green field site at Boynton Wood is transformed by 1,500 volunteers into a fully operational tented village. It has all the facilities you’d expect – water, showers, toilets, electrics, communications, food distribution, health and welfare services and even a beach!\n\nThe event was opened on the evening of Saturday 27th July with a big ceremony attended by all participants at which the Isle of Wight’s new Scout Contingent flag was paraded. The event closes on Friday 2nd August with the Isle of Wight Contingent returning home on Saturday 3RD August.\n\nA week of fun, discovery and adventure\n\nWith 8,000 Scouts and Guides from all over the world in camp together it will be a week of fun, discovery and adventure, embracing the spirit of Girlguiding and Scouting.\n\nThere is a varied and exciting selection of activities for participants including a range of adventurous, creative and cultural activities following the Scout and Guide programme, as well as opportunities to meet new friends from around the world.\n\nEntertainment and activities\n\nIn the evening, the Jamboree becomes even more vibrant with lots of different entertainment venues and activities.\n\nA particular feature of the event will be a food festival showcasing regional food. The Isle of Wight Contingent will be showcasing Island food from The Garlic Farm, Briddlesford Farm, the IOW Cheese Company, the IOW Biscuit Company, IoW Tomatoes and the Rock Shop, Shanklin.\n\nBurt: An unforgettable experience for our young Islanders\n\nAli Burt, Contingent Leader for Isle of Wight Scouts, said,\n\n“After many years (due to Covid preventing the attempt in 2020) of planning and fundraising Essex International Jamboree promises to be an unforgettable experience for our young Islanders, providing skills for life, building new friendships, and memories to last a lifetime.\n\n“I want to thank everyone who has helped us and these young people along the way, particularly all the companies who supplied products for the food festival.”\n\nGet involved\n\nScouting is the largest voluntary sector provider of activities for young people on the Isle of Wight but without the support of adult volunteers none of this would be possible.\n\nWe have uniformed and non-uniformed volunteer roles in Scout Groups and Units across the Island and welcome enquiries via the website or our Facebook page @IsleofWightScouts.\n\nNews shared by Andy on behalf of Isle of Wight Scouts.
