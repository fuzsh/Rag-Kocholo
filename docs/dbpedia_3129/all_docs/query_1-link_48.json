        "text": "A tragic incident at St Agnes, nearer to Land’s End on the north coast, would eventually bring Cornwall’s second surf lifesaving club into existence and justify the creation of a national association. On 10 August 1954 a visitor to the village got into difficulties in a very rough sea, close to rocks which had once been a harbour. A local man, Jack Plowright, grabbed the lifebelt and line, kept at the beach for emergencies, and swam out towards the man in trouble. He got to where he could all but reach the casualty but by then the 75ft lifeline was fully paid out and, wisely, he would not let go.\n\nPlowright’s effort and the ferocity of the sea were beginning to get the better of him when a woman, Joan Pugsley, waded, then swam out through the waves with another rope. She reached the would-be rescuer and they were both pulled back to the beach and safety, but not before receiving a battering on the rocks. The visitor sadly drowned.\n\nThe community were all too well aware after this accident that a lifebelt and a heavy hemp rope half the length of a football pitch were woefully inadequate for rescuing people from the surf. They found out about the help Bude had received from Australia the previous year and asked if they, too, could be loaned a reel and modern nylon line. Meanwhile, a group of local people set about training through the winter and, with the guidance of the Bude lifesavers, a St Agnes Surf Lifesaving Club was founded. Then, in the spring of 1955, a meeting was held in St Agnes coastguard station which concluded that, with three surf clubs now in existence – Brighton Beach in Sussex had just created one – a Surf Lifesaving Association of Great Britain should come into being.\n\nAs a mark of proud parental approval, the High Commissioner of Australia invited a deputation from St Agnes to Australia House in London in May 1955 to be presented with a belt, line and reel, a gift from North Bondi Surf Lifesaving Club. In August, an eight-strong squad of St Agnes lifesavers were awarded their Bronze medallions and the movement was up and running. The growing popularity of surfing and board riding through the 1960s and 70s, inspired locals to form surf lifesaving clubs at many beaches in South West England and Wales."
