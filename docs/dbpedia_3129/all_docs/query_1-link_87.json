        "text": "The Rehoboth Beach Patrol will once again host lifeguard-athletes from throughout the Mid-Atlantic region as they compete in sand and surf events this July for the right to compete in the United States Lifesaving Association’s national competition.\n\nThe 2024 United States Lifesaving Association’s Mid-Atlantic Regional Championships will begin at 9:30 am Wednesday, July 10. The beach venue for this year’s competition will move from Rehoboth Beach to Towers Beach in Delaware Seashore State Park due to construction of Rehoboth’s beach patrol headquarters at Baltimore Avenue.\n\nImage\n\nThis will be the 27th consecutive year that the Rehoboth Beach Patrol has been selected to host this event, which draws 250-350 lifeguard-competitors from New York to Virginia.\n\n“We are excited to have the opportunity to host the 43rd annual lifesaving championships just as we have for more than 25 years,” says Rehoboth Beach Patrol Captain Jeff Giles. “We’re looking forward to an expanded competition with additional events. The day is filled with action-packed competition that can’t be seen in any other forum.”\n\nThis event showcases the skills and knowledge necessary to be an ocean lifeguard. The event schedule includes competitions traditionally held in Rehoboth such as a 90-meter sprint, 2K beach run, 4 x 90 soft-sand beach relay, 400-meter surf swim, swimmer rescue race, landline rescue race, paddleboard rescue race, run-swim-run, surf dash, and beach flags. In addition, surf skis and board events, which traditionally have been held in New Jersey, will be held in Delaware for the first time this year.\n\n“The level of local and regional talent competing will put on a show not to be missed,” says fifth-year Rehoboth Beach Patrol guard Sophia Gulotti. “We performed well last year, and everyone is excited to see who has what it takes to win a championship and qualify for the nationals in South Padre Island, Texas.”\n\nThe United States Lifesaving Association is America’s nonprofit professional association of beach lifeguards and open water rescuers. USLA works to reduce the incidence of death and injury in the aquatic environment through public education, national lifesaving standards, training programs, promotion of high levels of lifeguard readiness, and other means.\n\nEstablished in 1921, the Rehoboth Beach Patrol is considered one of the nation's leading lifesaving agencies with 103 years of excellence in safety and lifesaving competition as well as a 700-member alumni association prepared to guide the RBP to continued excellence."
