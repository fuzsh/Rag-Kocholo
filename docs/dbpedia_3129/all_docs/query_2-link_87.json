        "text": "If you have visited Hilton Head Island’s beaches, you are probably familiar with Shore Beach Service.\n\nThey are on the beach in the lifeguard highchairs, under the red beach patrol umbrellas, or driving the red beach patrol vehicles. Shore Beach Service’s Beach Patrol is here to help you have a great vacation!\n\nHilton Head Island is blessed with some of the safest waters on the east coast. Our gentle sloping beaches and offshore sandbars generally create calm surf conditions. However, always be cautious in the ocean.\n\nShore Beach Service provides year-round beach patrol for Hilton Head Island’s 13.5 miles of beach.\n\nThe beach patrol includes about 80 lifeguards from across the country and around the world. During the peak summer season, the patrol consists of more than sixty lifeguards, eight red trucks marked “Beach Patrol” and two red ATVs. In addition, they have three wave runners for use in water rescue.\n\nTheir supervisors can be found patrolling the beach in the red Beach Patrol trucks.\n\nPlease find a lifeguard or flag down a beach patrol vehicle if you need help or to ask any questions. They assist in first aid, ocean rescue, missing persons, beach-specific questions, or any other questions you may have about the island. Each member of their staff has access to two-way radios which allow for communication to all points on the beach. In addition, these radios provide them with a direct line of communication to the 911 dispatch office. This provides immediate assistance to medical emergencies and from the sheriff’s department.\n\nAs a member of the South Atlantic region of the United States Lifesaving Association (USLA) since 1989 and a Certified Agency of the USLA for Open Water Lifeguarding since 1995, their lifeguards meet USLA’s high standards of training.\n\nThey also rent beach chairs and umbrellas!\n\nServing Hilton Head since 1974, they are the only company on Hilton Head Island that sets up the equipment for you daily. Arrive at the beach and your personal umbrella and chairs will be reserved in your name. Just leave them behind when you depart at the end of the day!\n\nSource: http://www.shorebeach.com/index.php."
