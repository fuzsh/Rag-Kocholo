        "text": "Part 2: Time to shine!\n\n‚ÄúYou may be the only person left who believes in you, but it‚Äôs enough. It takes just one star to pierce a universe of darkness. Never give up.‚Äù ‚Äî Richelle E. Goodrich, Author\n\nFor the next 17 years, we poured our hearts into our surf school ‚ÄúSurf Steps,‚Äù One of the most fulfilling yet challenging endeavours was running our ‚ÄúJunior Surf Club‚Äù for over a decade. It was a labour of love that demanded endless liaison, organisation, and nurturing‚Äîboth of the young athletes and their sometimes equally passionate parents! Despite the challenges, it was incredible witnessing these individuals evolve into top-level surfers, coaches, lifeguards, and physiotherapists. filled me with immense pride. Even today, I am full of pride in what was achieved and cherish the bonds forged during those formative years, realising the profound impact our coaching and mentorship had on their lives and also importantly, mine.\n\nDuring this time in 2007 and after two decades, I finally pursued my long-held dream of attending university. This opened doors to new opportunities and perspectives in Sport. Stepping back from the management of the day-to-day operations of the school in 2011 allowed me to explore some of these new avenues, recognising many areas for surfing development. So I endeavoured to address these areas‚Äô lack of resources by also becoming a trainer and mentor of surf and SUP coaches, as well as a water safety instructor.\n\nIn 2013, I embarked on my first international sports development consultancy project with the Danish National Surf Federation, representing the International Surfing Association (ISA). This has continued into many more projects since and has allowed me to impart invaluable skills to many, but also provided an opportunity to make tangible drowning prevention improvements and create work opportunities in many countries. Contributing to the improvements in the sport, the safety and well-being of individuals worldwide has been immensely gratifying.\n\nThe pivotal year of 2020 heralded a new chapter in my career journey with the offer of the Regional Development Advisor position created by the ISA as it became a recognised Olympic sport. The incredibly varied nature of this role nowadays ensures that no two days are alike, there are so many uncharted territories to try to provide development solutions to! We also closed our Surf School this year. COVID-19 effects, and the continuing lack of support and restrictions in operation from our school‚Äôs landlords, the local government, finally led us to this decision. This allowed me to focus more time on my new career direction and shed a workload we no longer had the passion for and wanted to carry. In 2023 I was offered the ISA International Development Officer role which is the role I fulfil at present.\n\nFrom establishing the first surf school in our local area to spearheading groundbreaking projects on a global scale, I feel my path has been now defined as a pursuit of excellence and a commitment to pushing boundaries. It‚Äôs still a daily challenge to decide how far to push these or when not to!\n\nAs I reflect on my journey, I am reminded of how hard it was at times to persevere in the pursuit of my desire to do something beneficial for me and others. Despite grappling with many moments of self-doubt and anxiety, I have emerged stronger and more resilient.\n\nTo all those grappling with uncertainty and apprehension about pursuing their dreams, I urge you to take that leap of faith. Embrace your inner brightness, for it has the power to illuminate even the darkest of paths. With perseverance and unwavering belief in yourself, you have the potential to carve a path that not only fulfils your aspirations but also leaves a lasting impact on the world.\n\nWhat inspired YOU to Coach or to change your career path? Let me know in the commentsüòä\n\nPart 1: Beginnings\n\nReflecting on my past, I realised I stumbled into coaching almost by chance. I understand now that it was my desires, life events, and the environments I found myself in all played a role in steering me towards this path.\n\nI‚Äôm going back to my early years in this journey, when I began surfing at the age of twelve in Christchurch, NZ. As I approached the end of high school in the late 80s, our economy was in recession and we didn‚Äôt have a lot of money, so it was too challenging for me to pursue the University pathway. Struggling to secure good employment, I sought a route that would allow me to earn a tertiary qualification while being gainfully employed. This quest led me to explore opportunities within the Air Force, prompting me to undertake their entrance exams.\n\nPerforming well in the exams, I was encouraged by the recruiter to pursue aircrew selection. However, I ‚Äúchoked‚Äù during the impromptu public speaking assessment, hindered by insecurities a lot of 17-year-old have and paralysed with performance anxiety. Although I was urged to reapply for the next intake, financial pressures led me to seek alternative paths.\n\nDuring the selection process, I connected with a fellow candidate already serving in the military, who suggested considering choosing an engineering trade if I couldn‚Äôt afford to wait. Following his advice, I enrolled as an aircraft engineering cadet, embarking on a career that allowed me to travel extensively, indulging in my passion for surfing and honing my knack for fixing things.\n\nAs I entered my thirties and embraced fatherhood, a newfound sense of responsibility and desire to do different and make a difference began to take root. The experience of nurturing my young daughter had quickly shifted my focus from self to others, prompting me to contemplate what changes I could make in my life to do different.\n\nThe idea of becoming a surf coach emerged.\n\nEager to share my love for the ocean and my wealth of experiences with others, I underwent training as a surf coach, balancing this newfound passion with my existing career in engineering. This eventually led to a part-time coaching role for a chain of surf shops across the south of England.\n\nBecoming a coach marked a pivotal moment in my vocational journey, where my skills and passions took precedence over mere financial considerations. The success of a ‚Äúgirls only‚Äù surf event that I organised for the shop chain propelled me into a full-time coaching and sports equipment trainer role. However, as fate would have it, the company underwent a takeover, resulting in redundancy. As a part of my severance package, I negotiated then retainment of the lease agreement with the local council for the surf school, along with all the equipment and my company car. I still have two original beginner boards from 2002 that are still in use to this day.\n\nStay tuned for Part 2, where I‚Äôll delve into what happened next!\n\nLocal surfers from the social group ‚ÄúSisters of Stoke (SOS)‚Äù hit the beach near Bournemouth pier on St. Patrick‚Äôs Day Sunday last week, not only to catch the cool spring waves but to learn bystander rescue techniques from local surf, SUP and safety training organisation Surf Steps.\n\nThe term ‚Äòbystander‚Äô describes any member of the public, be they family, friend, or stranger, attempting to rescue someone in distress. However, it can be extremely hazardous for the bystanders if they don‚Äôt understand and assess the risks or have knowledge of rescue principles/techniques.\n\nThis is the first time this training programme has run in the UK. SALT (Surfers Awareness in Lifesaving Techniques) was designed by a team of Huntington Beach lifeguards, in California, US, to provide aquatic emergency response guidelines and techniques to surfing members of the public.\n\nThe program teaches The 3R‚Äôs:\n\nRecognition of potential hazards and victims.\n\nReaction to people in need, with consideration of one‚Äôs own safety first.\n\nResponse from lifeguards, emergency services and surfers.\n\nThe Sisters of Stoke (SOS) said much of what they learned on Sunday was new to them. The SALT program changed the way they think about people who end up in unsafe situations in the water. SALT teaches that a crisis can happen to anyone at any time and that surfers should have an obligation to look after one another, especially when there is no lifeguard patrol.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rewarding to be in a program that‚Äôs not just about surfing ‚Äî it‚Äôs about helping out others,‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is going to have a ripple effect. ‚Ä¶ With all the people here today, you know they are going to save lives in the future.‚Äù Mar, SOS\n\nThe group took turns in training being the person in trouble and then, rescuer, then assistance. Andy, Surf Steps‚Äô trainer, showed the group how to identify if the person was in trouble, how to secure them, and then how to start the person‚Äôs safe return to shore.\n\n‚ÄúWe realised that many bystander rescues were conducted by surfers who are already out there surfing. If you surf long enough, it is not a matter of if you will rescue someone ‚Äî it‚Äôs when.‚Äù Andy, Surf Steps\n\nSALT instructors tell participants that many rescues will also need a response from lifeguards or other emergency medical services. A big issue is that many untrained people trying to help in these situations without knowledge and coordination can make it more difficult.\n\nIn the US, The SALT program is run by Huntington Beach Marine Safety Division and is free to any local surf groups. Those interested can email marinesafetyeducation@surfcity-hb.org to set up a class.\n\nInterested in similar programs for Surf or SUP groups in your local area? Contact Andy, Director of Surf Steps by email: andy@surfsteps.co.uk\n\nBig thanks to Sistas of Surf for being part of our top 1st-time trial of SALT!\n\nLast and no means least, Ian and Terry at Havana Beach Hotel for being the stand-up members of the local community by providing their awesome venue for the classroom and changing facilities! Legends:-)\n\nWalton on Thames, Elmbridge, Surrey August 21-23 2020\n\n8 SUP coaches from Ditton‚Äôs Paddle Boarding took part in the first Coach Rescue course since the UK lockdown in March.\n\nThe course was hosted at a superb private location right on the banks of the river Thames arranged by Brett Scillitoe, Admiral of Dittons, with Surfing England and SLSGB trainer/assessor Andy Joyce.\n\nSubjects covered included practical skills, safety, communication, risk analysis and assessment, SUP rescue, and First Aid.\n\nThe days started with theory and dry land practical sessions, followed in the afternoon by a lot of enjoyable water-based practical sessions in the surprisingly mild temperatures of the summertime Thames.\n\n‚ÄúIt was great to be able to get back to doing what I love, helping people become safer coaches in and on the water and enable them to perform quality rescues in emergency situations. The students finally got the long-waited opportunity to complete the internationally recognised course and showed this in the way they applied themselves during the courses.‚Äù Andy Joyce\n\n‚Äù Andy was a great instructor and all the students commented on how well he guided them through all parts of the course, with care and consideration. Nothing was ever a bother to go through again. They were all very keen to get going and practice their new skills.‚Äù Brett Scillitoe\n\nSurf Steps provide this and other safety courses that are suitable for all watersports users, not just lifesavers and coaches.\n\nIf you are interested in any information regarding these, feel free to contact Trainer: Andy (andy@surfsteps.co.uk) or Ditton‚Äôs Paddle Boarding https://dpbclub.co/contact-us/\n\nLast week, after a long time in lockdown, the Surfing England Adaptive (Para) Surf crew got together on Monday the 20th July in Porthtowan for a long-needed team catch up and surf!\n\nBlessed with great weather and easy conditions, a lot of the core team made it for the day with some new surfers joining as well. We also had the great surprise of Bruno Hansen, Danish prone surfing world champion turning up to say hi!\n\nIt provided a great opportunity to look at equipment, technical aspects of surfing, and renewing and developing the relationships between the group as a whole.\n\nThe day was arranged by Andy Joyce, Surfing England‚Äôs Para Surf Team Manager and Melissa Reid, Britain‚Äôs first woman‚Äôs World Champion surfer (VI) at her home break of Porthtowan. We were grateful for the amazing support by the following companies and people:\n\n-The Wave Project for organisational assistance and the use of their beach wheelchair.\n\n-Spike Kane and The Wave for the use of the prone board for Tash.\n\n‚ÄìSnugg and Swell for the use of their boards and wetsuits.\n\n‚ÄìCaroline Kearsley Photography (ckearsleyphotography@gmail.com) for the amazing shots of the group featured here.
