        "text": "World Drowning Prevention Day 2024\n\nIn April 2021, the United Nations adopted the historic first Resolution on Global Drowning Prevention, recognising the scale of the problem, calling for coordinated action to prevent drowning and marking the 25 July as World Drowning Prevention Day.\n\nAquatic Centres, Swim Schools and Community Groups are encouraged to promote and support World Drowning Prevention Day, to shine a spotlight on and raise awareness of that fact that \"anyone can drown, no one should\".\n\nFrom Going Blue, Sharing Resources and Sharing Local Stories - Be part of the global movement to prevent drowning and promote water safety.\n\nPrepare for the unexpected.\n\nKids will be kids. And we love them all. Cute, funny, quiet, wild, angelic, studious, all of them with their own unique personalities, all of them unpredictable. One day the side kick and the curious one the next, with everything in between. Which is why we love them even more!\n\nBut they have one thing in common: Kids canâ€™t help themselves around water, you need to. Keep Watch."
