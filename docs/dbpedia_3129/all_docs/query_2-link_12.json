        "text": "The Surf Life Saving Association of Great Britain was founded in 1955 and was a founder member of WLS. Surf Life Saving is an exciting and healthy recreational activity that embodies voluntary public service.\n\nIt helps people to reach high standards of physical fitness, swimming ability and life saving skills. It is a water sport that involves the use of boards, skis and boats. It involves competition for members of all age groups as individuals and as members of teams.\n\nThe Surf Life Saving Association of Great Britain has over 4.000 members. They patrol Britain’s beaches voluntarily, in their own time and at their own expense. Members carry out training and qualify Proficiency awards so that they are able to:\n\nAdvise people how to avoid getting into danger in the water.\n\nReact sensibly to emergencies, effect necessary rescues and administer the required first aid.\n\nTake part in Surf Life Saving Competitions and Championships for which relevant proficiency awards are generally a pre-requisite.\n\nMission Statement\n\nTo provide a safe and enjoyable environment on our beaches.\n\nObjectives"
