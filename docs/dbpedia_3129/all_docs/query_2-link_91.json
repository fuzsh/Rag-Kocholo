        "text": "On March 4, 2023, at Royal Palms Beach in San Pedro, Ocean Lifeguard Specialist Sam O’Hare responded to a major medical emergency/mass casualty incident involving multiple victims of a shooting a short distance from his tower.\n\nA few minutes before 8:00 p.m., just as OLS O’Hare, the only remaining Lifeguard on duty began to close the area. Royal Palms/White Point Beach is a fairly isolated pocket beach known for its tide pools, rocky and sometimes slippery shoreline, combined with rough and dangerous surf. It is very popular with locals for its picnic and family atmosphere.\n\nWhile the beach was still very crowded, O’Hare heard multiple gun shots coming from less than approximately 100 yards to his west in the parking lot near the picnic and restroom area.\n\nO’Hare immediately requested backup from law enforcement and Fire Department resources, and without regard to his own safety responded to the area where he found multiple victims with gunshot wounds. He began the job of triaging the patients, as well advising the remaining patrons on areas of safety. He began working on the four victims, stopping the bleeding and treating them for shock.\n\nWhen backup units from LAPD arrived, they secured the area while L.A. City Fire Paramedics began Advanced Life Care alongside L.A. County Lifeguards. All four victims were transported — with one in critical condition — to area hospitals.\n\nWithout O’Hare’s quick response, calm demeanor, professional triage under extremely chaotic and hazardous circumstances, these victims, as well as the dozens of other patrons, may not have survived.\n\nO’Hare, initially acting alone and putting himself in a life-threatening situation in an extraordinary effort to protect the public, is the finest example of an L.A. County Fire Department Ocean Lifeguard Specialist.\n\n​\n\nOcean Lifeguard Specialist Samual O'Hare\n\nSteve Moseley began his career as an Ocean Lifeguard in 1981. During his 36-year career, he worked all the beaches along the 72 miles of Los Angeles Coastline, from Malibu to San Pedro until retiring as Chief Lifeguard in 2019.\n\n​\n\nSteve grew up in Glendale, Ca., son of Carl and Bree Moseley. He began swimming and playing water polo in 1976, at the famous Hoover High School. He continued his aquatic and academic education at Valley Community College, where he played water polo for Bill Krause, another Lifeguard Legend. Steve then transferred to USC and graduated in 1984 with a degree in Business Administration with an emphasis in Marketing. Steve was also an Eagle Scout.\n\n​\n\nIn 1981, Steve graduated from the Lifeguard Rookie Academy, and worked in the Central Section at Santa Monica Beach, Venice Beach, Marina del Rey, and Will Rogers Beach. After seven years, he realized that his lifetime calling would be as a Los Angeles County Ocean Lifeguard and was promoted to a permanent position as an Ocean Lifeguard Specialist in 1991.\n\nWith Steve’s passion and dedication to lifesaving, and his people skills so apparent, Steve was recruited to and elected to the L.A. County Lifeguard Association’s (LACOLA) Board of Directors. Steve served as a Member at Large, Vice-President, President, and finally President Emeritus. He assisted during some of the most turbulent times for Lifeguard Division and LACOLA. His leadership was instrumental with the merger of the Lifeguard Division into the L.A. County Fire Department and in the fight for control over the beaches of Royal Palms, Redondo, Manhattan, Topanga, Las Tunas, Malibu, Dan Blocker, and Point Dume helping to preserve the continuity, stewardship and quality service provided by L.A. County Lifeguards from County Line to San Pedro and Catalina Island.\n\nIn 1997, Steve was promoted to Captain and assigned to the Southern Section, working the beaches of Cabrillo, Torrance, Redondo, Hermosa, Manhattan, and Dockweiler. During this time, Steve was placed in charge of the Lifeguard Training Academy, where for nine years he impacted the lives of hundreds of recruits and dozens of instructors. Included with this assignment was the responsibility of Public Information Officer and oversight of the Junior Lifeguard Program.\n\nIn 2001, Steve was promoted to Lifeguard Section Chief and assigned to the Northern Section, with responsibility for Malibu/Surfrider, Dan Blocker, Point Dume, Zuma, and Nicholas Canyon beaches. Eventually, Steve was reassigned back to the South Bay and was promoted to Chief Lifeguard in 2014.\n\n​\n\nFor 24 years, Steve and his wife Jennifer have called Hermosa Beach “The Jewel of the South Bay”, their home. They have one son, Max, 22, who has recently graduated from George Washington University.\n\n​\n\nSteve is known for his insight, wisdom, dedication, physical skills, professionalism, thoughtfulness, and wit.\n\nHe represents the best of Lifeguard Division and so, is recognized with the 2023 Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\n​"
