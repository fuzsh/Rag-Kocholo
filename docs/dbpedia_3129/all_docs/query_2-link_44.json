At this event, the Australian team will conduct a demonstration of “Patrol Competition” a hallmark of Surf Life Saving Australia (SLSA) format.\n\nThe Patrol Competition has been taking place in Australia annually for more than 30 years to not only improve and strengthen life-saving personnel physically, but to reinforce rescue techniques and know-how; all necessary skill sets for surf patrol to provide safer beaches. The Australian team’s demonstration will be based on frequently occurring water accidents in Japan, and displaying the necessary team dynamics through the rescue simulation.\n\nIn addition to the demonstration, the team will meet with Japanese lifesavers and professionals who work near the ocean to contribute to local beach safety and to improve rescue skills in the case of water accidents in Japan.
