        "text": "Paul Cracroft-Wilson - Fitzroy\n\nWhen a young Taranaki boy left the black sands of Fitzroy Beach for the golden sands of the Gold Coast in 2007, he had no idea the trail blazing achievements that would follow in the years to come or the great legacy in a sport he did just for fun. Paul started his surf lifesaving journey as a nipper at NPOB in the late 1990's and moved across to Fitzroy in the early 2000's. His first taste of success in the Open Men’s division came in 2005 when he won the beach sprint title for the first time. A title he would go on to defend again in 2006, 2007 and later on in 2016.\n\nBut it was musical sticks or in the surf lifesaving world \"beach flags\" that Paul truly excelled in. Beach flags could sometimes be a race of chance, luck and skill. It took great mental toughness, power, speed and strength to go round after round until only one stick and two people were left. This event was Paul's specialty and one he dominated in our sport for the better part of seven New Zealand titles 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2016.\n\nPaul's success on the sand awarded him numerous call ups to the New Zealand team from 2007 through to 2016. Paul was an integral part of the unstoppable New Zealand Black Fins Teams that won Worlds in 2012, 2014 and 2016. Paul captained the NZ Team in 2011 and 2015 for the International Surf Rescue Challenges.\n\nNew Zealand Team Representation\n\nTri Nationals Team – 2007\n\nInternational Surf Rescue Challenge – 2013, 2015\n\nNew Zealand Teams - 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016\n\nWorlds Results\n\nItaly 2004 - 2nd Beach Flags\n\nGermany 2008 - 1st Beach Sprint, 2nd Beach Flags\n\nEgypt 2010 - 1st Beach Flags, Beach Relay\n\nAdelaide 2012 - 2nd Beach Flags, Beach Relay\n\nNetherlands 2016 - 2nd Beach Flags\n\nNew Zealand National Surf Life Saving Championships Results\n\n1st Beach Flags - 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2016\n\n1st Beach Sprint - 2005, 2006, 2007, 2016\n\n1st Beach Relay - 2014\n\nTaranaki Team - 2010, 2011, 2012 - Overall Winners for New Zealand Surf League\n\nAussies Results\n\n1st Beach Flags - 2007\n\n2nd Beach Flags - 2006, 2005, 2008, 2009, 2010\n\n3rd Beach Sprint - 2011\n\n1st Beach Relay - 2008, 2009, 2010\n\nKatie Watts & Emma Crofskey - Fitzroy\n\nWhen a national board champ and a beach flagger teamed up to race IRBs, neither of them knew the legacy they would leave on the sport. In 2006 Emma Crofskey jumped in a boat with Katie Watts for the first time together with just six weeks until the National Champs at Paekakariki Beach. They walked away with gold in the tube rescue, silver in the single rescue and bronze in the mass rescue. The combined results/points were good enough to land the girls first equal for the Foxton Shield (top overall women’s team), which they would go on to hold for the next five years. A feat that no other women’s crew in the county had achieved before. The 2006 Nationals were also the first time Fitzroy Surf Life Saving Club became the country’s champion IRB club, a title they went on to hold for three consecutive years in 2006, 2007 and 2008.\n\nThe next year at Ohope Beach they managed a clean sweep of all categories, winning the tube rescue, single rescue, assembly rescue and mass rescue. The girls pay tribute to the camaraderie among the entire Fitzroy IRB racing crew and club for all the support and advice given to them over their racing career. “We were a team, not just individuals. It wasn’t just about your own crew. Everyone helped each other out. We could not have done as well as we did without the support and team work to get the boat to the line each time we raced.\n\nIt’s fun when teams support each other. And success helped build a team and team culture.” Each season the pressure for the girls to stay at the top was always there in the background. When you are at the top everyone wants to beat you — you become the team to beat which put a target on their backs at the National Champs. They would practice a couple of times a week, each training lasting at least two hours. Emma would also get in the pool 2-3 times a week for tube training and Katie would sprint train for the mass transitions and finishes where speed was key. “We had to keep training to keep ahead of the opposition”. “Racing was always fun — but nerve-wracking too.”\n\nEmma and Katie also held roles on the club’s committee, were patrol captains and coached throughout their racing careers. These were volunteer positions. Their leadership, time and experience has been invaluable to the Fitzroy Surf Life Saving Club over the years. They have also been great role models for the younger generation coming through our sport.\n\nbp Surf Rescue New Zealand IRB Championships - Between 2006-2010\n\nGold - 11\n\nSilver - 2\n\nBronze - 2\n\nSamantha Lee - Lyall Bay\n\nWhen a young Samantha Lee rocked up to Lyall Bay SLSC in Wellington she probably had no idea that her Surf Lifesaving career in the future would see her be crowned our most successful\n\nWorld Championships athlete ever! Yes you heard it right! Whilst many people would think of Cory Hutchings when asked “who has been our most successful athlete at the Worlds?” It is in fact, Samantha Lee. During her Surf Lifesaving career Samantha racked up six individual world titles between 2012 and 2016. In doing so she also set world records.\n\nSamantha was a pivotal member of the history breaking Black Fins team who won the overall world titles at the 2012, 2014 and 2016 World Championships. On top of her World Championships success, Sam was also named the top female competitor at the German Cup in 2013, 2015 and the Bene Cup in 2013 along with claiming eight individual titles. She also took away a massive sixteen individual titles at the Surf Life Saving New Zealand Pool Rescue Championships. However, it was always the team events and relays that Sam enjoyed the most stating “there is nothing like sharing the podium with your mates.”\n\nSam is not only a World Champion competitor she is a champion person - very humble, supportive and an amazing role model for many. Since her retirement from the international stage in 2017, Sam has continued to be involved with her club Lyall Bay, coaching and mentoring the young members. “More than just a champion, Samantha is a champion person”\n\nWorld titles\n\n6 individual world titles - 3 for 100m Rescue Medley (2012, 2014, 2016), 2 for 200m Obstacle (2012, 2014), 1 for Tube Rescue (2016)\n\n2 team world titles – 2 for 4 x 50m Obstacle Relay (2012, 2014) both world records\n\n4 individual world club champs titles in 2016\n\n1 team world club champs title in 2016\n\n8 individual world champs placings; 5 2nds, 3 3rds\n\n3 world champs team placings; 2 2nds,1 3rd\n\n2 individual world club champs placings; 2 2nds\n\n1 team world club champs placing; 3rd\n\nFirst overall competitor at German Cup 2013,2015 and at Bene Cup 2013\n\nAustralian pool titles\n\n8 individual Australian titles, 200m Obstacle (2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2016), Rescue Medley (2009, 2012, 2013, 2014)\n\n8 individual Australian title placings; 5 2nds, 3 3rds\n\nSurf Life Saving New Zealand Pool Rescue Championships\n\n16 individual titles including 200m Obstacle (2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2016), Rescue Medley (2009, 2012, 2013, 2014)\n\n12 individual placings; 9 2nds, 3 3rds\n\nSteph Laughton & Carla Laughton - St Clair\n\nSteph and Carla have been an inspiration to all members of Surf Lifesaving by demonstrating longevity as Surf Lifeguards and in all forms of Surf Lifesaving sport. They have won National medals from 2008 until their retirement in 2019.\n\nDuring this time, they have won:\n\n17 gold IRB medals, 1 Worlds gold and 2 Worlds silvers, 5 Pool Champs golds, 2 Sand Nationals golds and 30 other place medals across all disciplines.\n\nSteph and Carla have shown extreme dedication across all disciplines of Surf Lifesaving whether that be through lifeguarding or sport. Both have spent considerable time on the Club committee, as instructors, examiners and patrol captains while also playing a crucial role in maintaining high patrol standards set at the St Clair SLSC and Otago/Southland area. Moreover, to be able to compete at such a high level at the SLS New Zealand Pool Rescue Championships, TSB New Zealand National Championships and bp Surf Rescue New Zealand IRB Championship, their dedication to training and success has taken considerable effort.\n\nBeing based in Dunedin, Steph and Carla have had to train in less than desirable conditions with cold water temperatures and large surf conditions often preventing people from reaching the highest level along with significant financial outlay and travel, however, Steph and Carla have powered through this to be champions in all disciplines of Surf Lifesaving. Steph and Carla have been pioneers as multi-disciplined female athletes that have had successes in all areas of Surf Lifesaving. They have always represented St Clair SLSC and the organisation to the highest possible standard and have been role models and coaches to people across the country. Surf Lifesaving is better off as a movement thanks to Steph and Carla’s contribution and ongoing contribution to the movement.\n\nOverview as a team\n\n18 National titles\n\nASB Otago Sports Awards Team of the Year 2013\n\nHave achieved Gold medal results in all 3 SLSNZ National Championships\n\nHave both won gold in Tube Rescue events at Pool Champs (Steph 1st , Carla 2nd), Surf Nationals and IRB Nationals in the same season – 2010\n\nChristopher W Billing - Worser Bay\n\nThe induction of Chris Billing into the New Zealand Surf Life Saving Hall of fame for his contribution to beach events, all began on the beach at Worser Bay in the summer of 1952/53. In fact his beach event prowess was born out of hours and hours of training at no where else but the beach. To qualify for his surf medallion in 1952, Chris used Worser Bay beach as his training ground. In those days there was no such thing as a heated swimming pool in Wellington so Chris’s created his own beach-based training regime that became more and more rigorous as his career progressed.\n\nThe 1953/54 season was Chris Billing’s greatest competitive year. He won the Junior Surf and the Junior Belt race at the Wellington trials to select representatives to attend a national selection trial for a team to tour Australia. At the national trials Chris won the Junior Surf Race and Beltman’s title and the open Beach Sprint. Not surprisingly he was selected in the New Zealand team.\n\nIn the 1954/55 season Chris was undefeated in Surf races, beltmas events and the beach sprint in the Wellington region carnivals. At the Nationals he won the Junior Surf Race title and was runner up in the beltman’s. As a Junior, Chris won the Wellington Junior Surf and beltman’s titles for three consecutive seasons. At his last carnival as Junior. Chris won the Junior Surf and entered the Senior race that followed immediately after and won that as well.\n\nAs a Senior, he won a number of Wellington titles but National individual titles eluded him. There were, however, some epic races with Reg Harker and also with the increasing number of pool specialists (like Brian Crowder) who also enjoyed participating in Surf events. For a number of years Chris was a perpetual finalist in the National beltman’s final and a top five finisher in the National Surf Race.\n\nAt all times in his beach career, Chris was a great Club member and a keen participant in team and R & R events. He was a member of Worser Bay team that won the National March Past Pennant in 1968. In fact Chris was a Club member who was prepared to help the Club out in any event they required him to participate in. A typical Carnival day would see him compete in the Surf Race Belt race, 6 man and 4 man, the beach sprint, beach relay and the March past. It was this all-round prowess that saw Chris again selected to represent New Zealand in a series of tests against Australia in 1956.\n\nPerhaps the most unique string to Chris’s bow, was his ability as beach sprinter. The hours spent training on the beach at Worser had helped develop Chris’s sprinting prowess to the point that he was unbeatable running on sand. He won the National Beach Sprint title at least 11 consecutive times. In fact he was unbeaten in beach sprints until the time he gave sprinting away in the early 70’s. His speed on the final leg of the beach relay helped the Worser Bay Club win 4 beach relay titles. Every time Chris ran in Club’s relay team at Nationals, they won the event.\n\nIt is a beach career simply packed with outstanding personal achievements and a deep continuing loyalty to the Worser Bay Club where it all began.\n\n1995 Sport Hall of Fame Induction\n\n22 September 1995, Beehive\n\nFour Surf Life Savers were recognised for their outstanding contributions to lifeguarding with induction into the Surf Lifeguard New Zealand Hall of Fame in a ceremony held at the Beehive in September. The recipients were Peter Fitzsimmons OBE, John Honnor, Alan Thompson and the late Hugh Cooper. They have each shown outstand- ing commitment to Surf Life Saving in both individual effort and on behalf of others in the organisation.\n\nPeter Fitzsimmons has a long history in water sports with contributions to Surf Life Saving through an outstanding number of activities; currently he is SLSNZ's Director of Public Affairs and a Life Member. John Honnor has also given many years of endeavour to Surf Life Saving at local, national and international levels; presently John is an active member of the Directorate of the International Life Saving Federation (ILS).\n\nAlan Thompson has a record of outstanding sporting achievement which he has coupled with solid organisational work to promote and enhance Surf Life Saving in New Zealand. The late Hugh Cooper selflessly devoted a large part of his life to building Surf Life Saving while being an active Lifeguard and performing many rescues. He showed outstanding commit- ment and perseverance in promoting and sustaining Surf Life Saving at a grass roots level.\n\nThe four inductees joined the 16 existing Hall of Fame members whose commitment and achievements were recognised with the establishment of the Surf Lifeguards New Zealand Hall of Fame in 1992. In all cases the work and achievements of these Hall of Fame members have benefited both Surf Life Saving in New Zealand and the community as a whole.\n\nIeuan John Honnor OBE - East End\n\nJohn Honnor first joined his Club East End in 1953, has since committed much of his life to Surf Life Saving. John has filled a wide variety of roles at Club, District and New Zealand levels including administrator, competitor, instructor, judge, manager/coach and selector. Three roles stand out at New Zealand level; the first is that of Chief Superintendent and his successful running of New Zealand Championships. The other two are his present role as the Chairman of Surf Life Saving’s first Board of Directors – formerly Management Committee – and New Zealand’s representative at World Life Saving forums. In all fields he has acted with integrity and dedication in the advancement of Surf Life Saving.\n\nBack in the 1970s Honnor helped set up a new international body called International Lifesaving. He enjoyed the \"humanitarian side\" of life saving, he says. \"It was a service organisation and we were giving something back to the community. I liked swimming and I liked the beach and one thing followed another.\" Giving back to the community is something he has done all his life.\n\nAlan Thompson - Waikanae\n\nAlan Thompson has a record of outstanding sporting achievement which he has coupled with solid organisational work to promote and enhance Surf Life Saving in New Zealand. Alan was selected for the 1982 Mt Maunganui Trans-Tasman test as a ski paddler and proved his ranking as a formidable competitor by scoring the only New Zealand win on a day.\n\nAt the 1984 Westshore New Zealand Surf Life Saving champs the New Zealand kayak team for the Los Angeles Olympics was announced - The coaches, Ben Hutchings and Brian Wilson were also surf lifesaving lifeguards and New Zealand Surf Life Saving national titles winners.\n\nThough Olympic success stands supreme for Alan we cannot discount his involvement in surf lifesaving. It provided the training ground and impetus for such success. Alan's skill, never-say-die attitude and extraordinary versatility in an era of what has become increasing specialisation, was first displayed at his second New Zealand Surf Life Saving champs at Paekakariki in 1976 when he came away with seven medals, including the Junior Ironman title.\n\nFrom there until 1991 he was to win a total of 66 medals. At senior level from 1980 to 1990 he amassed 20 gold medals, 14 silvers and 5 bronze - 11 from the swim/R&R arena, 24 from board and ski and four from canoe. He was a member of three SLSNZ teams, '82, '85, and '87, and captained the team at the Mount test of '85, as well as the Gisborne District teams that won the Norrie Trophy.\n\nPat Ellison MBE* - Moana Rua\n\nOver the years, Pat Ellison has received many honours in recognition of her services, including life membership of the Moana Rua Club (which she formed after the war to attract the displaced women from St Clair and St Kilda) and the Otago Association as well as the New Zealand Service Award and the Distinguished Service Award. Pat was made a life members of NZSLSA in 1980, and in 1992 she was one of two women (the other was Muriel Brown) elected to the NZSLSA's Hall of Fame.\n\nPat was the assistant manager for the first ever New Zealand ladies tour to Sri Lanka in 1974.\n\nShe was also a foundation member, and has served as president of the Ladies 21 Club, an organisation representing 21 years'involvement in surf lifesaving. In 1976 she was awarded an MBE for service to lifesaving. Pat's achievements were an important breakthrough for women's sport in general and gave women such as Kath Bradshaw and Bet Sydney the confidence to apply for and hold similar positions in Otago athletics and swimming.\n\nH Duke Gillies MBE* - St Clair\n\nIf he had remained Hugh Donald Gillies, perhaps his story would not have struck such a chord. But Duke Gillies: what a name, what a man and what a life.\n\nGillies was the godfather of Otago surf life-saving, a man who spent three-quarters of a century watching the waves but whose influence will be felt for much longer. He was a man of the water, so salty you half expected to see barnacles on his skin.\n\nGillies was a swimming champion as a youngster and gained his nickname when Duke Kahunamoko, the Hawaiian world champion, gave demonstrations in New Zealand. An injury curtailed his involvement in other sports but, limp and all, he found his calling in life-saving. It was once estimated he had rescued at least three dozen people from the sea.\n\nGillies had a 76-year association with the St Clair Surf Life Saving Club, holding almost every official position. In the 1930s, he coached the St Clair six-man junior team to national honours, and was in the senior team which won the Nelson Shield for rescue and resuscitation. \"Life-saving got into me,\" he later told Otago Daily Times reporter Kim Dungey. \"People need it and you've got to have people to do these things. If you don't do the work, it doesn't get done.\"\n\nPerhaps his greatest contribution was designing a revolutionary four-man surf rescue canoe in 1932. Until then, life-savers swam to those in difficulty with a reel and a belt. Canoes were available, but the Gillies-designed craft was the first built high at the front to withstand large waves, going both in and out. He and friends built the first wooden canoe in his backyard at St Kilda. It became the standard rescue craft in New Zealand and was the forerunner of the fibreglass models which were used well into the 1950s.\n\nGillies was a foundation member of the Otago Surf Life Saving Association, and president of Surf Life Saving New Zealand from 1956 to 1958. He received the order of MBE in 1974 for his efforts. He was also active in Special Olympics, and a lifelong supporter of the St Clair salt water pool. Gillies died in 2002, aged 95.\n\nJ Allen Lee MNZM* - South Brighton\n\nAllen joined the SBSLSC on 1949, gaining his surf lifeguard award in 1950. He served in various fields of practical surf life saving activity for 37 years. He has been involved in Club administration for 34 years, including club captain, chief instructor. He competed in NZ Championships for 14 years being a winning member of the Nelson Shield and Senior Surf Race Team for 4 years.

He was examined on the way down to Christchurch on the boat and again in the morning before the championships started. It was the start of an incredible 70-year love affair with the surf. Paddy was 19 when he won that first title and 89 when he won his last World Masters title in 1993 - nearly 70 years later. Between 1925 and 1948, Paddy was on the winning team of New Zealand senior 6-man R&R four times. He also won the individual surf race in 1938. He won 2 titles at the World Masters in 1993 at the age of 89.\n\nIn 1938 he was selected to be a member of the first ever New Zealand surf lifesaving team to visit Australia but had to withdraw. He managed the NZ team to Australia in 1970 and also served as President, Deputy president, Chair from 1945-49, Delegate for Otago and was on the Executive and various sub committees for NZSLSA. Paddy was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1992.\n\nJack C Blakeley, MBE* - Lyall Bay\n\nThe NZSLA improved the sport, standardised equipment and rules and in 1937 it brought and inspirational New South Wales team to New Zealand.\n\nJack Blakeley was selected for the NZ team to pay a return visit to Australia but had to withdraw.\n\nOlder members of the surf lifesaving movement tend to regard the 1930s as ‘the Golden years,’when the only events contested at major surf lifesaving competitions centred on belt race, surf race and R&R events. They were the years of such national champions as the Lyall Bay trio of Jack Blakeley, Maori All Black Dick Pelham and Frank Ryan along with Wally Jarvis of St Clair and the young Maranui up-and-comer, Joe Clark. In 1938 Blakeley won the New Zealand beltman’s title over the great Alan Dalton who had been the first to defend the title the year before. He also was a member of 4 Nelson Shield winning teams and won his last medal in 1948 in the surf teams race 21 years after he joined the club..\n\nIn the early 1970s, the Lyall Bay club modestly updated its facilities and added a small bar, which Jack Blakeley ran profitably. What other club in New Zealand can offer its members these facilities?’, it boasted in 1974: Sauna room, Carpeted lounge, Hot & cold showers, Television, Plunge pool, stereogram.\n\nJack was a Life member of the Lyall Bay Surf Lifesaving Club, the Wellington District Association and the National Association. At administration level he was the National Registrar and Publicity Officer from 1941 to 1944. Treasurer from 1945 to 1947, Auditor from 1948 to 1983 and was on various subcommittees He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1992.\n\nW V (Bill) Griffin, QSM* - Lyall Bay\n\nBill joined the Lyall Bay Club in 1922 – serving the club in many positions over the years. Bill became “No. 1” of the “21” Club when it was formed in 1948. Bill was President, Patron and made a Life Member of the Lyall Bay Club and was made a Life Member of the Bay of Plenty Association. He was President and Deputy president for NZSLSA, a delegate for Auckland and Bay of Plenty on the NZ Council and was on various subcomittees. He was made a Life Member of the National Association. Bill was awarded the Queens Service Medal in 1982 for his 60 years of service. He served for 21 years as beach Marshall at district and national level and was often referred to as “Mr Surf”. His catch phrase was “Always look after the juniors”.\n\nBill was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1992\n\nPhoto, voice like thunder: Bill Griffin calls the arena to attention at the 1953 NZ Champs, Waikanae. (Barry McLean Collection, Between the Flags)\n\nNewell St Clair Berge* - East End\n\nKnown only to most a \"Toby\", he joined East End SLSC in 1916 at the age of 14, and was associated with the club for over 60 years. The highlight of his younger years at hte club was winning the Tabor Shield.\n\nToby never expected members to do anything he wasn't prepared to do himself, and was well respected around the club, and region. At the end of his sporting career, Toby took on the role of judge on the beach and was New Zealand Chief Time Keeper.\n\nToby occupied all positions of Executive Committee at East End and Taranaki SLSA, as well as reaching the highest official position in the surf Life Saving Association of New Zealand being elected President in 1958/60.\n\nA New Zealand Service award was presented to Toby in 1935, and Life Membership in 1963. Toby was one of the few to be presented with the Gold Badge for 50 years’ service to the life saving movement.\n\nToby (#12) was one of the original 21 members of the 21 Club in 1948. During World War 11, Toby took over the responsibility for Taranaki, and was instrumental in the reforming of surf life saving in Taranaki after the war.\n\nGeoff Le Cren - Taylors Mistake\n\nGeoff was another surf life saver with strong family connections to the Club. His parents Keith and Rene were active members of Taylors as was sister Helen. Later his children Tim, Danelle and Kristi became members.\n\nGeoff gained his Surf Bronze in 1958 and competed in his first nationals the same year in New Brighton. He competed with distinction as a patient for Norm Webb where in heavy seas they were only one of three teams to finish. However, they were denied a placing as the event was called off because of the big sea.\n\nAccording to Kevin Tutty and Paul Carpinter in ‘Over the Hill for 100 years’ “the next year, at Oakura, he became perhaps the youngest to win the national junior belt title at only 15, … and in 1960 he added the surf race”. However, a combination of factors outside his control i.e. accidents and injuries, family bereavement, need to work, archaic rules relating to professional swimming instructors (for which he did part time for a period) reduced his opportunities to shine as a senior. He swam a host of finals, and twice won the South Island Belt title. In 1982 he won the national over 30 surf race. In 1963 he was the sole Taylors Mistake representative in the Canterbury team that competed in the prestigious Royal Carnival. Between 1960 and 1981 he represented Canterbury for 16 of those years. Perhaps the most satisfaction Geoff gained from the sport was being a member of the club’s six-man team and the multiple successes it had in winning the Nelson Shield. Of the thirteen wins in two decades, Geoff was in 10 of them.\n\nAs well as the sporting side of life saving, Geoff was an extremely able administrator, secretary of the Canterbury association for several years, and of the club from 1974-77 and club captain from 1965-66. He represented New Zealand in a surf life saving educational role in 1980, having been granted an Air New Zealand Study Award. In 1981 he was named Canterbury Surf Life Saver of the Year.\n\nKen W Mitchell* - Worser Bay\n\nKen Mitchell was dedicated to Surf Life Saving in and out of the water. In the water, he was instrumental in saving lives during the Wahine sinking and co-ordinated Barrie Davenport’s first-ever swim across Cook Strait in 1962. Out of the water he was dedicated to his Worser Bay Club and also to SLSNZ, where he was Chairman of the SLSNZ Council in the later 1970s and subsequently Executive Officer for nine years until his retirement in 1989.\n\nKen was Instructor of the NZ team v Australia in 1972, a member of the NZ team to the World Congress in South Africa in 1974, a National selector for many years and Chief Instructor of NZSLSA between 1971 and 1977. He also served as a delegate on the NZSLSA National Council and was on the management committee for many years.\n\nDaryl Neate - Taylors Mistake\n\nDaryl grew up in Taylors with the family owning the bach “Shangri-la “at the end of the bay. He started as a nipper and got his surf award in 1962. Daryl was one of the club’s most successful competitors in both R & R and craft, winning the Nelson Shield 13 times, NZ Iron Man, Ski, Ski Rescue, Taplin Relay and Double Ski Titles. In all – 35 gold, 22 silver and 21 bronze medals at national championships.\n\nDaryl also represented New Zealand in 1973 in South Africa and in 1974 against Australia. In 1992 he was inducted into the NZ Surf Life Saving Hall of Fame along with Geoff Le Cren. Daryl competed for the club for 40 years as well as patrolling and coaching. In 1988 the Taylors Mistake team of Daryl Neate, Paul Carpinter, Simon Davis, Lars Humer, Carl Immers and Dene Waru, coached by Jock McNaught, made no errors throughout the entire drill – recording an unbelievable 0.0 score for the first time ever.\n\nHis long association with the club and support was acknowledged by the Taylors Mistake SLSC by being made a life member."
