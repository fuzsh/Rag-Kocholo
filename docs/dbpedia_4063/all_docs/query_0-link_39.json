        "text": "The story I was told, and it may be apocryphal, is that localities used it to make money, drawing up lists of names. Nice names, like Montefiore, cost more money than ordinary ones (mine: Mendlesohn or son of Mendel), and some names were imposed on the poor, like Schwarzkopf.\n\nBut that’s just the tradition I was brought up with. I don’t know.\n\nItalian Jewish last names are tipically names of cities (e.g. Volterra, Recanati, Bologna). “Montefiore” is the name of more than a town in Tuscany and Central Italy, so probably it has no connection with the names used by Jews in Germany.\n\nBy the way, many typical Italian Jewish last names are taken from names of German cities. For example: “Luzzato” (or Luzzatto, Luzzati, Luzzatti) comes from “Lausitz”, “Marpurgo” comes from “Marburg”, etc. Also “Tedesco” and “Tedeschi” are typical Jewish last names in Italy (“tedesco” = “German”).\n\nDuring the Fascist regime, when laws against Jews were introduced, “arian” italians that had accidentally the name of a city, of another typical Jew name, as their last name were allowed to change it to something less equivocal.\n\nThat section about permanent surnames has one of my favorite footnotes in any academic work. He describes a particular instance of the state giving someone a last name–in this case, a Welsh peasant. (I don’t have the book near me right now or I’d find it and quote.) It’s brilliant stuff, and I often use it to explain the concept of legibility.\n\n(My other favorite footnote is in John Demos’s Unredemed Captive, when he describes a group people snowshoing through New England and admits that there are no records of what happened to them, but he’s writing based on his own experience of New England snowshoing.)\n\nI, too, doubt that Hoffman was anti-semitic. None of the biographical notes I’ve read suggest this, nor does a quick Google search. One of the major characters in The Tomcat Murr is Master Abraham, a good friend of the author’s alter-ego Kreisler, and, from his name, presumably Jewish.\n\nI’ll second what Emerson said about Scandinavians using patronyms until well into the nineteenth century, and I’ve read that the Scots used patronyms until the seventeenth, when they became fixed (so that MacSomething is not necessarily a clan name).\n\nPatronyms still seem to be in use in Iceland.\n\nThat’s what that website says. And I think the story about him coming up with ridiculous or insulting names is pretty well sourced. It could be that the adjective “vicious” is…I dunno… maybe he was just your standard 18th/19th century anti-semitic European.\n\nBut as an aside. Aren’t surnames in most languages based on either:\n\na) Occupation\n\n(Taylor, Schmidt – Smith – Kowalski etc)\n\nb) Place of origin of family long time ago\n\nc) Some personal feature of some ancestor\n\n(White, Newmann (Neumann, Nowak)\n\nd) Related to nature (probably through occupation or place of origin) (Mountbaum, Hillman, Gorski, etc.)\n\ne) Patronymic (Johnson, Ericsson, Emerson? etc.)\n\nf) Name of the master’s family back when your ancestors were slaves/serfs\n\nI’m willing to bet non-Indo-European languages are the same (got a Chinese friend whose name directly translates as “Barbarian People”, or so he says)\n\nNo one knows where my last name came from. It’s of the kind that gives linguists a headache.\n\nI’ve heard the same story as Henry and I see no particular reason to doubt it.\n\nA similar phenomenon occurred in 1920s Turkey, when Turks, who had used surnames only rarely, were mandated by Ataturk and the leadership of the Turkish Republic to choose their own surnames. Thus we have in modern Turkey a proliferation of surnames that translate to things like “white cloud” “clear water” “warrior” “black metal” “rose” “great mountain”, names of heroes in Turkic and Altaic mythology and Seljuk and Ottoman history, as well as ‘professional’-type names like “cotton seller”, “blacksmith”, and so on. The two most important figures in the early Republic, Mustafa Kemal and Ismet Inonu, both had adopted last names: Inonu named himself after the site of a successful military engagement against the Greeks, and Kemal means “excellence”.\n\nSpanish colonialists introduced compulsory surnames into the Philippines in 1849, issuing a “Catalogo Alfabetico de Apellidos” from which all were supposed to select family names. Prior to that date most Filipinos had two names, but neither was necessarily a “family name” and both were likely to be the names of catholic saints, combined in seemingly random order, so that “Juan Francisco” in one document might show up as “Francisco San Juan” in another. More than half the women were “Maria XXXX” (Maria Juana, Maria Francisca, Maria Theresa, Maria Candelaria,&c).\n\nIn some provinces, this assignment was apparently random. In others, it looks as if pages had been torn from the “Catalogo” and sent to each town in turn, so that you have 80-90% of the inhabitants of one town with surnames beginning with the letter “A”; in the next town down the coast it’s “B,” and so forth. (Thus the town of Oas, Albay, is so heavy with names beginning with “R” that they jokingly claim both Rizal and Roosevelt as native sons!) For a few years, if the historian is lucky, surviving records will show both someone’s new surname and the name by which s/he was previously known.\n\nIn Thailand, on the Western model, surnames were adopted by government decree early in the 20th century. The Thai went along because they had to, but did not fully internalize it, and most are still referred to except on official documents by the first (=real) name, not their surname. Thus Dr. Neon Snidvongs would be called “Dr. Neon,” not Dr. Snidvongs.\n\nMost Indonesians still use only a single name. This confused the editors of Time in the immediate postwar period when they started hearing about a brash nationalist called “Sukarno” (or “Soekarno” in the Dutch spelling). Nothing daunted – Time never was in those days – they simply assigned him one, so the fictive name “Achmed Soekarno” is found in some reports of that period – and occasionally even later!\n\nOn Icelandic, I have a coworker who’s Icelandic and apparently [pm]atronymic naming is still the norm. His name is based on his father’s, but after he immigrated to the US he gave his daughter his last name (which naturally ends in ‘son’) in order to fit with the local norm. But when he goes back to Iceland to visit family her last name is ‘Skarpisdottir’ so she won’t be teased. Also, apparently in Iceland you are not permitted to give a child a first name that has not been approved by some sort of naming council.\n\nAlso, apparently in Iceland you are not permitted to give a child a first name that has not been approved by some sort of naming council.\n\nWas this not also until recently the case in France â€“ the mayor had a list of approved names against which the registrar had to check your application?\n\nAlso in Germany – and something similar (I think) in Turkey – at least for Turkish citizens: you must have at least one given name from a standard list though you may have more than one given name.\n\nIn Britain there isn’t a similar requirement (so people could presumably still end up with ‘Puritan’ names like ‘Praisegod Barebones’)\n\nBut I believe there’s a list of ‘names’ that you can’t give a child – I’ve been told or read that it includes ‘Satan’, ‘Jesus Christ’, ‘Uz’ and ‘Water’. I guess the list is issued to registrars of births and deaths.\n\n(You may, though, be able to change your name by deed poll to something on the ‘forbidden list’ list\n\nIn parts of Sweden patronymics worked into 20’the century. My great grandfather was Sven Karlsson, his son Gustaf Adolf Svensson, my father Bruno Svensson (born 1924, habit fading out by then but cousins kept is up), and I was Fredrik Brunosson.\n\nTo avoid the nautrual misconceptions that this caused we then cahgned to a new unique name, this process is still ongoing which results sometimes in rather strange names. The reason is that so many people have the same name that it creates problems: try to look for Per Johansson in the Stockholm phonebook.\n\nPatronyics, variable or standardised as a name, creates confusion outside small villages, of course, so it became a habit for urban dwellers to make up a name. Straightforward natural phenomena or simple combiantions are the most common: Berg, Ekberg (Oakhill), Nyman (Newman)\n\nFor the aristocracy in the same situation, i.e. an ancestor from a peasant background (most noblemen were soldiers/officers), more elegant substances were used: Goldstar, Silvershield etc.\n\nGustaf Eriksson Vasa referred to above reflects the medieval habit, where aptronymics were used but noble families had a third name, usually based on their family crest (Vasa: fasces). of course many noblemen had a foreign background: Bildt e.g.\n\nOf course some bourgeois families tried to make their name sound noble: Lagerfeldt:noble, Lagerberg:not. Lager: Laurel.\n\nPriestly families on the other hand usually latinized e.g. the name of their ancestral farm or village: Linneaus (who Frenchified it to von LinnÃ© when he was ennobled)\n\nOne side of my family is Jewish and Dutch, and I was always told that my surname came about due to a Napoleonic decree that Jews should have last names (I assume it is the same one listed in the original post). The family worked in the textile business so our name is just the Dutch word for a rather common household item. Here in the USA nobody can pronounce it, but whenever I travel to Holland or to Belgium almost every person I meet tells the same lame joke about how I’d be useful to have around the house. If only my anscestors had been engaged in some more exciting and/or louche work back then, I imagine it’d be a funnier joke.\n\nAs far as I know, the Danish state never had specific regulations for the Jewish community with regard to family names. The Jewish community was always very small, so there were other ways of controlling it. If I’m not mistaken, then the oldest Jewish families in Denmark have Spanish/Portugese names.\n\nThe decree introducing obligatory family names originate from 1829 and that in turn led to the adoption of the “sen”(son of)-family names.\n\nIf I bothered to look, I would find a Christen (regional form of Christian) as a paternal ancestor – most likely in Western or Northern Jutland.\n\nIf I bothered to pay, I could change my oh so pedestrian Christensen – the 6th most common surname in Denmark – to either Lassen (maternal grandfather), Olsen (maternal grandmother) or Mouritsen (paternal grandmother).\n\nThere is a list of approved first names which is available from the Danish Family Agency.\n\nBonus information I: You can – in principle – tell a Swede from a Dane and a Norwegian by looking at the -son/-sen ending. Danes and Norwegians use -sen, Swedes (and Icelandic) -son. But you will find -sons in Denmark (Swedish emigrants from the 19th Century) and the US authorities also messed up a lot of Danish and Norwegian names, so Mr. Olson or Larson could very well be of Danish ancestry.\n\nBonus information II: The Jewish-Danish writer Henri Nathansen had a curious mix of a Jewish (Nathan) and a Danish name (-sen).\n\nI believe that the Tamil naming convention gives one’s father’s name first and then one’s given name. However, unlike Hungarians and Chinese people, my father and his brothers (as far as I can tell) all ended up in North America with the same first name and different last names! Though it’s not entirely clear to me, because there seem to be special names (or perhaps terms, or descriptions?) that people within the family use to refer to one another, that may have little to do with their official names."
