        "text": "Dr. Barnett Slepian, an obstetrician with a practice in this Buffalo suburb, returned home from synagogue Friday night with his wife, Lynn, and greeted his four sons. Then he stepped into his kitchen, where a sniper's bullet crashed through a back window and struck him in the chest, the police said.\n\nHe fell to the floor, calling for help, and died within two hours.\n\nDr. Slepian was one of three doctors who provide abortions in the Buffalo area, and investigators said his killing was the most deadly evidence yet of a pattern of anti-abortion sniper shootings in Canada and western New York.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Federal Bureau of Investigation joined a Canadian law enforcement task force trying to solve four sniper attacks against abortion doctors dating back to 1994. Canadian officials said the shootings appeared to be connected and warned of ''a high probability that these attacks will continue.''\n\nThe shooting of Dr. Slepian, 51, apparently fulfilled that prophecy. He is the third abortion doctor killed in the United States since 1993. He had endured years of picketing and harassment, apparently moving his family into a new home in a quiet, affluent subdivision two years ago in hope of avoiding protesters.\n\nThe four other shootings -- three in Canada and one in Rochester -- each occurred within a few weeks of Nov. 11, or Veterans Day, known as Remembrance Day in Canada. Carla Eckhardt of the Washington-based National Abortion Federation, an abortion-rights organization, said earlier in the week that some Canadian anti-abortion activists call the holiday ''Remember the Unborn Children Day.''\n\nIn each of the attacks, the snipers used a high-powered rifle, firing through a window of the doctors' homes. Investigators are looking at the possibility that the same gunman is responsible for all the shootings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
