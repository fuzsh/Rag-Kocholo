How is the wood sliced up and formed into floor boards..How long does it take to make the court ?? How long does it take to set up the court in an arena ?? All those things are talked about in the video.. 🌳 🌲 🔨 ⛏ 🔧 🏟 🎨 🖌 🏀 🗑 🏜 👩🏫 👨🏫 🚚 📺 🎥 #eventmanagement #facilitymanagement #logistics #sportbusiness\n\nWoodside Bible ChurchChurch family, TOMORROW is the day!

And don't forget, tomorrow is also Family Sunday, so kids get to join us in the big service!Sermon outline in comments\n\nHands down the most effective conference for educators of personal finance. Not only has the national team of Laura L. Levine Dan Hebert Joel Chrisler and many more, mastered hosting a comprehensive conference with a teacher-centered focus (it's in their mission!), they are doing incredible work ALL year long to promote why this content is critical to our nation's youth. I have leaned on all three of these individuals at one time or another since discovering their work, and often stated that #JumpStartNEC changed my classroom, not only for me, but for my students. (Mystic Dan) #DanTheMan, Laura, Joel, the entire JumpStart Team...I appreciate you for wanting my classroom to be better in providing high-quality, highly-engaging personal finance resources for ALL of my students. I wish State Departments of Education understood how this work has been comprehensive for many years, not just convenient timing in recent headlines. You understand the data and the importance of doing this correctly. Apply today!!"
