In other German-speaking countries such as Austria and Switzerland, it does not rank as highly. In the United States, the last name is more rare, but still present; it ranks 16,829th, according to Census 2000 data.\n\nGruenfeldt is also a common surname among Jews of German heritage. Many Jewish people adopted the Gruenfeldt surname to evade persecution and assimilate into German society. It is estimated that over 1,000 Gruenfeldts were murdered during the Nazi regime in the Holocaust.\n\nToday, the Gruenfeldt name is still seen among both the Jewish and non-Jewish people of Germany and elsewhere.
