Selected Active Reserve (AR) Marines. Must be non-competitively augmented to the active component at the time of selection. To accomplish this, the AR select must initiate a Prior Service Enlisted Package to Manpower Enlisted Assignments (MMEA-1) via their Career Planners to coordinate the augmentation per reference (c). Once augmented, Marines are directed to provide an updated Basic Individual Record reflecting the component change to the MCRC POC.\n\n3. Selectees who desire to decline appointment in the primary MOS in which selected, shall submit a letter of declination via their chain of command to the Commanding General, Marine Corps Recruiting Command (CG MCRC).\n\n4. Per paragraph 8 of reference (a), selectees may defer to the next available Warrant Officer Basic Course (WOBC) if they are not medically qualified by BUMED or due to a personal hardship. Selectees must submit a Request for Deferment through their chain of command to CG MCRC. Marines selected for WO may defer up to two times before they will be recommended by CG MCRC for removal from the selection list.\n\n5. WOBC seats are limited. Marines selected for WO may be deferred to future WOBC classes as needed. Individuals deferred will be notified by Headquarters Marine Corps.\n\n6. Commanding officers shall ensure the selectee meets the appointment requirements set forth in reference (a). If a selectee fails to meet those requirements, the commanding officer will initiate a delay in accordance with reference (a) and the Marine will not attend WOBC nor be appointed.\n\n7. WO selectees are slated to be appointed on 1 February 2024 at a ceremony aboard Marine Corps Base, Quantico. WO selectees will attend the WOBC. The mission of the WOBC is to train and educate newly appointed warrant officers in the high standards of professional knowledge, esprit de corps, and leadership required to transition from enlisted Marines to officers, with particular emphasis on the duties, responsibilities and professional abilities required to serve as a platoon commander in a support role. By separate orders, selectees will be ordered by the CMC Manpower Management (MM) to report to the Commanding Officer, The Basic School (TBS) to attend the WOBC that is scheduled to convene on 17 January 2024. Selectees must report no earlier than 0600 on 17 January 2024, and no later than 1200 on 17 January 2024. References (d) and (e) define the differences in duty under instructions, temporary additional duty (TAD), temporary duty under instructions (TEMINS), and reassignment orders in relation to per diem and other allowances. It is requested that as many selectees as possible be sent TAD to TBS. This reduces the administrative hardship on TBS as well as on the selectees. It is requested that any selectee with more than 30 days between WOBC graduation and follow-on school be sent TAD to TBS. The report date to the WOBC was modified in order to effectively screen selectees and ensure they meet the standards outlined in reference (a) prior to appointment.\n\n8. Orders Process\n\na. Although the majority of students will be attending WOBC via TAD orders from their command, the individual monitors will determine if an individual executes TEMINS orders or TAD orders to WOBC.\n\n1) Marines with no dependents (CONUS and OCONUS) will be issued TEMINS orders.\n\n2) Marines with dependents (CONUS and OCONUS) or single Marines who were previously authorized to reside off-base will be issued TAD orders via DTS and a funding letter will be provided in Marine Corps Training Information Management System (MCTIMS) by TECOM. Marines attending WOBC in a TAD status should ensure proper administrative and legal documents are completed prior to departing to WOBC (i.e. Power of Attorney).\n\nb. The point of contact for TAD orders is your local administrative office or consolidated admin center. The point of contact for all other order types is the respective monitor at Manpower Management Officer Assignments (MMOA).\n\nc. All commanders issuing orders for Marines to attend WOBC will ensure a DD Form 214 is created via the Document Tracking and Management System (DTMS) in Marine Online (MOL). The DD Form 214 will cover all active duty enlisted service through 31 January 2024. Ensure strict compliance with reference (g). Although the hard copy DD Form 214 may be signed and copies 1 and 4 issued to the Marine prior to executing orders to TBS, the DD Form 214 should not be certified, published, and distributed via DTMS until the unit has confirmed the individual’s appointment/commission via the Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS). Upon appointment/commission confirmation, the DD Form 214 may be certified, published and distributed per the current edition of reference (g).\n\nd. If a selectee is found unqualified or is otherwise not appointed for any reason after executing orders to TBS, the DD Form 214 previously generated via DTMS shall be deleted and any hard copy DD Form 214 issued to the Marine shall be shredded, as appropriate. The following blocks/items will be standard on each 2022 enlisted to warrant officer DD Form 214: “12B. 20240131”; “15A-C. No”; “16. None”; “20-20A. No”; “23. Discharged”; “24. Honorable”; “25. MARCORSEPMAN 6404.1”; “26. KGM1”; “27. N/A”; “28. Accept commission or warrant in same branch of service”. All other provisions of reference (g) for this occasion shall apply to all other sections of the DD Form 214.\n\ne. If a selectee/WO is disenrolled from WOBC and placed on legal by TBS while in a TAD status, they may be formally re-assigned to TBS via Basic Orders until the case is adjudicated, per reference (d).\n\n9. Administration\n\na. Check-in procedures and initial information for WOBC will be posted on the TBS website upon release of this message. Additionally, check-in information and documents will be posted on the WOBC 1-24 MarineNet Moodle Page approximately one month prior to check-in date. TBS will add all selected Marines to the MarineNet Moodle Page one month prior to check-in date. Selectees will receive an email form the Company Executive officer. The package will contain important information concerning the upcoming WOBC, including check-in procedures and amplifying comments for this message. The selectees must view the TBS website as soon as possible to read the welcome aboard information and other coordinating instructions pertaining to WOBC. The TBS point of contact is The Student Liaison Office and can be reached at TBS_Student_Liaison_Officers@usmc.mil. The website address is www.trngcmd.marines.mil/Northeast/The-Basic-School/. Students should direct their attention to the bottom of the page and find \"Student Information\" -> \"WOBC\" -> \"Welcome Aboard\".\n\nb. Selectees must report to TBS with a completed preship checklist, original orders, Defense Travel System travel authorizations, completed DD Form 214 in accordance with the information in the paragraph above and complete health and dental records. The Appointment Acceptance (NAVMC 763) and Identification Card will be completed/issued at WOBC. Selectees should report in MARPAT Digital Woodland Camouflage uniform. Selectees should either purchase their officer Service Alpha uniform or be prepared to have their uniforms tailored prior to the appointment ceremony. Specific information for uniform requirements can be found on the TBS website within the \"Welcome Aboard\" PDF packet.\n\n10. Training Requirement\n\na. Selectees must complete the preship checklist at home station and bring it with them when inprocessing at WOBC.\n\nb. Selectees are encouraged to arrive in peak physical condition due to the rigors of the course. Selectees must achieve a first class physical fitness test (PFT) prior to appointment as outlined in reference (h) and maintain Marine Corps Body Composition and Military Appearance standards per reference (i). Those who are not within standards or do not score a first class PFT after two attempts will be dropped from the course prior to appointment/commissioning on 1 February 2024. If a Marine is dropped from training, the CO TBS has the discretion to delay the appointment or allow a Marine to defer to the next WOBC. There will be extended field time at the WOBC. Selectees are highly encouraged to practice running the obstacle course with an emphasis on rope climbing. Hiking under load and running in boots and utilities are also highly recommended. Passing a 10-mile hike under prescribed load, a double standard Marine Corps Obstacle Course and the TBS Endurance Course are required to graduate from WOBC.\n\nc. Selectees must be able to satisfy swim qualification requirements per reference (g), which requires all officers to be a Water Survival-Basic (WS-B). The WS-B qualification is a requirement for graduation. It is highly encouraged that selectees make every effort to attain WS-B qualification prior to arrival at TBS. Selectees without immediate access to swim facilities are encouraged to make every effort to attain qualification. Due to the demanding program of instruction and limited opportunities for remediation, an opportunity will be made for unqualified WO selects to satisfy this requirement prior to the start of the course.\n\nd. Selectees with less than 13 years of service are encouraged to be current rifle and pistol qualified prior to attending WOBC 1-24 as the number of range seats available at their first duty station as an officer will be limited, if available at all.\n\ne. Selectees are required to read and review the following publications prior to check in:\n\n1. MCDP 1\n\n2. MCDP 1-3\n\n3. MCDP 6\n\n4. MCWP 6-10\n\nf. Once selectees have been in-processed, there will be an appointment ceremony on 1 February 2024. Further details will be made available on the TBS website and through follow-on correspondence with India Company staff.\n\ng. All required training must be completed within 36 months of appointment in order to be considered and selected for promotion to Chief Warrant 2. If all training is not completed within 36 months of appointment, the appointment will be terminated.\n\n11. Commanding officers are required to document, by page 11 entry, a permanent WO selectee's acknowledgement of the probationary status of his or her appointment. Active component WO selectees will receive the following entry: \"I understand that the first three years as a permanent warrant officer is a probationary period, and that the Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) may terminate the appointment of any warrant officer who fails to complete the WOBC, or any required MOS follow-on school. A Marine whose appointment is terminated, may, upon his or her request and at the discretion of SECNAV, be enlisted in a grade not lower than that held immediately prior to appointment.\" Marines selected for the warrant officer program will incur a 3-year obligation from the date of appointment.\n\n12. Physical Qualifications\n\na. Selectees who do not meet the qualifications established in references (i), (j) and (k) will not be appointed.\n\nb. These individuals will remain on the list of Marines approved for appointment to the grade of WO and, once medically qualified, will have an appointment date of the first day of the month prior to the month in which the members attend WOBC.\n\nc. Immediately upon release of this message, all selectees are required to provide (via email) a letter on command letterhead with their point of contact information, DSN, commercial telephone numbers, and electronic mail addresses to the point of contact at MCRC, Mr. Brent Reidenbach, at brent.reidenbach@marines.usmc.mil.\n\nd. Per reference (k), prior to appointment, selectees must be determined physically qualified for appointment by the Bureau Of Medicine and Surgery and must pass with a first class PFT as outlined in reference (i). Selectees whose health (i.e. injury, surgery, etc.) has changed in any way since submitting their pre-commissioning physical must contact MCRC immediately. Failure to comply with requirements may delay receipt of the appointment documents at TBS, and may subsequently result in a forfeiture of the date of rank. Commanding officers of deployed Marines can contact MCRC, ON-E to establish arrangements to complete this task, if needed. If not done already, selectees must submit a current commissioning physical examination, to include a Report of Medical Examination (DD Form 2808), A Report of Medical History (DD Form 2807-1), and an Annual Certification if applicable. The date of the physical exam must not be older than 1 February 2021. If the physical examination was completed prior to 1 February 2022, then copies of the current and previous years preventative health assessment (PHA) is required in addition to the physical examination.\n\ne. Local medical personnel and the selectee must closely review a selectee's medical and dental records to ensure accuracy and completeness prior to their arrival at TBS. Selectees should arrive at TBS fully medically ready to train at the time of check in with no outstanding medical issues that would preclude training. Pay particular attention to the following items:\n\n(1) Marks and scars must be listed.\n\n(2) Selectees must be dental class type 1 or 2, documented on the DD Form 2808 in block 43, and have block 83.a signed by a dentist or submit a dental examination as a separate enclosure. Dental records should be updated to reflect the most current dental examination.\n\n(3) HIV results must be within 24 months of check-in and include date tested and roster number.\n\n(4) Distance vision must be documented in block 61 of the DD Form 2808. If vision does not correct to 20/20, a current manifest refraction and ophthalmology evaluation is required. WO selectees with a history of vision correction surgery must have all pre-operative and post-operative reports included with the medical documents.\n\n(5) The results of an updated audiogram must be included in DD Form 2808 block 71.a. or as a separate enclosure. If any result is outside the normal range, per reference (k), section 38, submit an Ear, Nose, Throat (ENT) or Audiology consultation/evaluation and interpretation.\n\n(6) Female selectees, over the age of 21, must have a current Papanicolaou (PAP) test within the past 36 months. The pathology report from the most recent test must be submitted.\n\n(7) Ensure all \"yes\" answers on DD Form 2807-1 are explained by the physician in block 29. All pertinent medical clearance documents for each condition disclosed in the DD Form 2807 should be provided.\n\n(8) Ensure all answers on DD Form 2808 blocks 17-42 (excluding block 41 for males) are marked normal or abnormal. \"NE\" is not an acceptable answer.\n\n13. Questions from medical personnel concerning the medical requirements may be addressed to HM1 Adkins at derrick.adkins@marines.usmc.mil at DSN 278-9427 or by phone at commercial (703) 784-9427. CG MCRC is the approval authority for medical deferments for selectees who have not yet been appointed. Requests for medical deferments with supporting documentation must be routed via their chain of commands, to include a general officer level endorsement, and forwarded to MCRC ON-E. All requests for deferment must be received by MCRC before the projected date of appointment.\n\n14. Selectees who fail to comply with the aforementioned requirements will delay receipt of their appointment documents at TBS, and will subsequently result in a forfeiture of their date of rank.\n\n15. This MARADMIN is not applicable to the Marine Corps Reserve.\n\n16. This MARADMIN cancels 31 March 2024.\n\n17. Release authorized by Major General W. J. Bowers, Commanding General, Marine Corps Recruiting Command.//"
