        "text": "Zeppenfeldt: What does the surname Zeppenfeldt mean?\n\nThe last name Zeppenfeldt is of German origin and derives from an old German word that means “living near a field of tar or resin.” This indicates that the original family that bore this surname originated from an area known for producing a large amount of tar or resin. This tar or resin was often used in early times for fortification works, and it’s possible that the family had origins in the production of this material.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the Zeppenfeldt family was very likely a prosperous one since the production and sale of tar or resin was a necessary commodity and in high demand. Over time, they expanded their business in various European countries, settling in each of these places and acquiring properties and land. This expansion led to the eventual relocation to the United States, where several Zeppenfeldts currently reside.\n\nThe Zeppenfeldt family has a long and proud history of hard work and enterprise. Even though this last name has changed over the centuries, its roots in the production of tar or resin remain to this day. This is a testament of the enduring legacy of this family, and the strength of their commitment to their craft.\n\nOrder DNA origin analysis\n\nZeppenfeldt: Where does the name Zeppenfeldt come from?\n\nThe Zeppenfeldt surname is most commonly found in Germany today, where it is known to have originated. Records from the 12th century show the surname was first associated with villages in the area of Hessen, Germany, where many Zeppenfeldts still own land and live. The regions of the Upper Rhine, such as Baden-Wurttemberg, the Palatinate, and Rheinland-Pfalz, are also filled with families with this last name that trace their ancestry back to Germanic tribes living in the region. It is believed that the name is derived from the German phrase “zippen-feld”, meaning a fenced-in field.\n\nMore recently, Zeppenfeldt families can be found in the United States, Canada, and even as far away as Australia, as a result of immigration during the 19th and 20th centuries. In the US, records show that the surname is most common in the states of New York, Pennsylvania, California, and Florida.\n\nIt is possible to trace the Zeppenfeldt surname even further through records such as those of the LDS, or the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Whilst it is clear that the name’s prevalence is mainly in Germany, there are other pockets of Zeppenfeldts across the globe where the name has been carried to due to emigration.\n\nVariations of the surname Zeppenfeldt\n\nThe variants, spellings and surnames of the same origin for the surname Zeppenfeldt are as follows:\n\n• Zeppenfeld: This was the original German spelling for the surname.\n\n• Zeppelinfeld: This is the most common variant of the surname.\n\n• Zeppenfeldt: This is the anglicized version of the original German spelling.\n\n• Zeppenfield: This is another anglicized version of the surname.\n\n• Zeppelinfield: Another anglicized version of the surname.\n\n• Sebenfeldt: An alternate spelling of Zeppenfeldt.\n\n• Seppenfeld: Another variant of the surname originating in Germany.\n\n• Seppenfield: Another anglicized version of the surname.\n\n• Sebinfield: An alternate spelling of Zeppenfield.\n\n• Seppenfeldt: Another variant of the surname originating in Germany.\n\nSurnames that are related to the surname Zeppenfeldt include:\n\n• Zepfield: This surname is derived from the Middle High German given name “Zêpfli”\n\n• Zepp: This surname is derived from the diminutive of zeppelin.\n\n• Zepf: This surname is derived from the Middle High German given name “Zepf”.\n\n• Zeppling: This surname is derived from the diminutive of zeppelin.\n\n• Sepp: This surname is derived from the Middle High German given name “Sepp”.\n\n• Seppling: This surname is derived from the diminutive of sepp.\n\n• Seppl: This surname is derived from the diminutive of sepp.\n\n• Zepfel: This surname is derived from the Middle High German personal name “Zepfel”.\n\n• Seppel: This surname is derived from the Middle High German personal name “Seppel”.\n\n• Zepplingen: This surname is derived from the Middle High German locality Zeppelin.\n\n• Zepingen: This surname is derived from the Middle High German locality Zepflingen.\n\nFamous people with the name Zeppenfeldt\n\nBob Zeppenfeldt: Bob is an American professional golfer who had several top-10 finishes on the Nationwide Tour.
