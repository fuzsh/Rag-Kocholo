It is derived from the Old German word \"felten\" which means \"field,\" and the word \"mann\" which means \"man.\" In this context, the name could be interpreted to mean “field worker” or “farmer.”\n\nFeldtmann was likely an occupational surname, given to someone who lived or worked in a rural area. This could include a farmer, a farmhand, or those who supported the farm activity, such as a stable hand, a wheelwright, or a blacksmith.
