        "text": "Male given name\n\nFor other uses, see Eric (disambiguation).\n\nEric, Erich, Erik, Erick, Erikk, Eirik, EiríkurPronunciation ERR-ik\n\nFrench: [eʁik]\n\nRomanian: [ˈerik]\n\nErik\n\nSwedish: [ˈêːrɪk]\n\nDutch: [ˈeːrɪk] ⓘ\n\nErich\n\nGerman: [ˈeːʁɪç] ⓘGenderMaleLanguage(s)North GermanicName daySweden & Norway: 18 MayOriginWord/nameOld NorseMeaning\"sole ruler\",\n\n\"eternal ruler\"Region of originGermaniaOther namesVariant form(s)Eiríkr\n\nThe given name Eric, Erich, Erikk, Erik, Erick, Eirik, or Eiríkur is derived from the Old Norse name Eiríkr [ˈɛiˌriːkz̠] (or Eríkr [ˈeˌriːkz̠] in Old East Norse due to monophthongization).\n\nThe first element, ei- may be derived from the older Proto-Norse *aina(z), meaning \"one, alone, unique\",[1] as in the form Æ∆inrikr explicitly, but it could also be from *aiwa(z) \"everlasting, eternity\",[2] as in the Gothic form Euric.[3] The second element -ríkr stems either from Proto-Germanic *ríks \"king, ruler\" (cf. Gothic reiks) or the therefrom derived *ríkijaz \"kingly, powerful, rich, prince\"; from the common Proto-Indo-European root *h₃rḗǵs.[4] The name is thus usually taken to mean \"sole ruler, autocrat\" or \"eternal ruler, ever powerful\".[5] Eric used in the sense of a proper noun meaning \"one ruler\" may be the origin of Eriksgata, and if so it would have meant \"one ruler's journey\".[6] The tour was the medieval Swedish king's journey, when newly elected, to seek the acceptance of peripheral provinces.\n\nEric is one of the most commonly used Germanic names in the United States, along with Robert, William, Edward and others. [7]\n\nThe most common spelling across Fennoscandia and in the Netherlands is Erik. In Norway, another form of the name (which has kept the Old Norse diphthong) Eirik ( Norwegian: [ˈæ̂ɪrɪk]) is also commonly used.[8] The modern Icelandic version is Eiríkur ( Icelandic: [ˈeiːˌriːkʏr̥]),[9][10][11] while the modern Faroese version is Eirikur.\n\nIn Estonia and Finland (where Fenno-Swedish remains an official minority language), the standard Nordic name form Erik is found, but it may also be spelled phonetically as Eerik ( Finnish: [ˈeːrik]), in accordance with Finnic language orthography, along with a slew of other unique Balto-Finnic variant forms including Eerikki, Eero, Erki and Erkki.[12][13][14][15]\n\nAlthough the name was in use in Anglo-Saxon England, its use was reinforced by Scandinavian settlers arriving before the Norman conquest of England. It was an uncommon name in England until the Middle Ages, when it gained popularity, and finally became a common name in the 19th century. This was partly because of the publishing of the novel Eric, or, Little by Little by Frederic Farrar in 1858.\n\nThe Latin form of the name is Euricus or Erīcus (Medieval Latin: [ɛˈriː.kus]), which was also adopted into Old Swedish usage (for example, cf. 15th century Kalmar Swedish historian Ericus Olai).[16] Whence come the Greek forms Ερίκος (Eríkos) or Ερρίκος (Erríkos) (both pronounced [eˈri.kos]), in addition to the direct Nordic borrowing Έρικ (Érik).[17][18]\n\nÉric ( French: [e.ʁik]) is used in French, Erico in Italian, Érico in Portuguese. (Note some phonetically simplified modern forms may be conflated with descendants of cognate name Henry via Henrīcus, Henrik, from Proto-Germanic Haimarīks, sharing the stem *rīks.)\n\nAmong Slavic languages, most using the Latin alphabet borrow Erik, but there also exists Polish Eryk. The name is adapted into Cyrillic as Russian Э́йрик (Éyrik) or Э́рик (Érik), and Ukrainian Е́рік (Érik). The Baltic languages use forms such as Latvian Ēriks and Lithuanian Erikas.[19][20][21]\n\nAnd in Germany, Eric, Erik and Erich are used.[22] In South America, the most common spelling is Erick.\n\nIn Norway, Sweden and Finland, the name day for derivations of Erik and Eirik is 18 May, commemorating the death of Saint King Eric IX of Sweden, founder of the royal House of Eric.\n\nThe feminine derivative is Erica or Erika.\n\nRoyalty\n\n[edit]\n\nVisigothic\n\n[edit]\n\nEuric, king of the Visigoths between 466 and 484\n\nDanish\n\n[edit]\n\nEric I of Denmark, king of Denmark between 1095 and 1103\n\nEric II of Denmark, king of Denmark between 1134 and 1137\n\nEric III of Denmark, king of Denmark from 1137 until he abdicated in 1146\n\nEric IV of Denmark, king of Denmark from 1241 until his murder in 1250\n\nEric V of Denmark, son of Christopher I, reigned from 1259 to his murder in 1286\n\nEric VI of Denmark, firstborn son of Eric V, reigned from 1286 to 1319\n\nEric VII of Denmark, also Eric III of Norway and Eric XIII of Sweden, reigned from 1397 to his deposition in 1439\n\nNorwegian\n\n[edit]\n\nEric I of Norway (Eric Bloodaxe), the second king of Norway\n\nEric II of Norway, the king of Norway from 1280 until 1299\n\nEric III of Norway, also Eric VII of Denmark and Eric XIII of Sweden\n\nEiríkr Hákonarson, earl of Lade, ruler of Norway and earl of Northumbria\n\nErik the Red, the son of Þorvaldr Ásvaldsson\n\nSwedish\n\n[edit]\n\nAlaric and Eric, two legendary kings of Sweden\n\nJorund and Eirik, two legendary kings of Sweden\n\nErik Björnsson, one of the sons of Björn Ironside\n\nErik Refilsson, Swedish legendary king\n\nEric Anundsson, Swedish legendary king who ruled during the 9th century, may be the same as Erik Weatherhat, a more or less mythical Swedish king\n\nEric the Victorious, king of the Swedes during the second half of the 10th century\n\nEric and Eric, two pretenders around 1066\n\nEric IX of Sweden, Swedish king between 1150 and 1160, called Saint Eric, Eric the Lawgiver, Eric the Saint, or Eric the Holy\n\nEric X of Sweden, the King of Sweden between 1208 and 1216\n\nEric XI of Sweden, the son of king Erik X of Sweden and Richeza of Denmark\n\nEric XII of Sweden, rival King of Sweden and to his father Magnus IV from 1356 to his death in 1359\n\nEric XIII of Sweden, Eric of Pomerania\n\nEric XIV of Sweden, King of Sweden from 1560 until he was deposed in 1568\n\nGiven name\n\n[edit]\n\nEric, Erich, and Erik are very common given names.
