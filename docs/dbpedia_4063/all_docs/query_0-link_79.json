        "text": "Roberta Estes has been a professional scientist and business owner for 35+ years, (MS Computer Science, MBA, graduate work in Geographic Information Systems), as well as an obsessed genealogist since 1978.\n\nIn 2005, reflecting her interest and expertise in genetics for genealogy, she formed DNAeXplain, a company providing genetic research, analysis, and consulting services.\n\nRoberta is a National Geographic Society, Genographic Project affiliate scientific researcher and became part of the design team in 2012. Roberta has authored multiple academic papers, provided content and consultation to the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the History Channel, National Geographic Magazine, and other organizations and businesses.\n\nThe Million Mito Project\n\nIn 2020, Roberta launched the Million Mito Project, a collaborative scientific effort to rewrite the tree of womankind for all of humanity in partnership with Dr. Miguel Vilar, Lead Scientist for the Genographic Project, Dr. Paul Maier, Population Geneticist at FamilyTreeDNA, and Goran Runfeldt, Head of Research and Development at FamilyTreeDNA.\n\nIn June 2022, the Million Mito Team published a paper announcing the discovery of a 100,000-year-old branch of the human tree.\n\nEarly Years of Genetic Genealogy\n\nIn 2000, thanks to FamilyTreeDNA, the infant scientific field of DNA for genealogy emerged, allowing DNA to be used to trace individuals to common ancestors. With traditional genealogical records already researched to no avail, and several brick walls needing to fall, Roberta was one of the early DNA project administrators and pioneer adopters of DNA analysis for genealogy. Roberta manages over 20 DNA projects with an emphasis on Native American heritage.\n\nRoberta’s blog, Native Heritage Project documents early evidence of Native people in records and can be found at www.nativeheritageproject.com.\n\nPublications\n\nRoberta wrote the book, DNA for Native American Genealogy. She authored or co-authored several scientific academic papers and appeared in the History Channel documentary, In Search of: The Lost Colony of Roanoke.\n\nProducts and Services\n\nYou can purchase Roberta’s book, DNA for Native American Genealogy, here for people ordering within the US, or here for people outside the US.\n\nRoberta speaks and writes widely about DNA and genealogy and has provided keynotes at several major international conferences.
