        "text": "EDITOR'S NOTE: This article is Part II of the two-part series: What's in a Name? -- How Women in Business See It.\n\nOur names are core pieces of our identities. There are many layers to a name: cultural ties, one's vision of self, and assumptions others make. Names are a powerful communication device that we use to interact with the world, an essential part of our personal and professional brands.\n\nIn this series, women discuss some of the societal challenges that come with names and how these have impacted our individual journeys.\n\nIf our names are meant to match our identities, I haven’t always been clear on who I was. My names have altered, chameleon-like, as I sought to adapt different versions of myself into the broader context of life in three countries and across four cultures. These are the stories of the names I've been and how they have affected my identity and my pursuit for inclusion.\n\nPlain Jane White Girl Name\n\nMy birth name perfectly reflects my status as your average female middle-class white American, so ordinary that there were three other Jennifers in my class at school. The only thing remarkable about it is the spelling of my surname, which I was taught to defend from an early age. My father’s background was just Western European enough that no one ever bothered to Americanize the way it was written, so I spent my formative years echoing my mother and specifying, “Petersen, s-e-n” when giving my name.\n\nThe Hispanization of a Gringa\n\nWhen I moved to Mexico in my early twenties, almost everyone I met struggled to pronounce my name. Unfazed, I began to introduce myself with a Spanish accent, cradling my given name languidly in the back of my mouth, stretching the short i into a long e, dropping the uniquely English snarling r, and curling up the tip of my tongue to savor the tail end of my evolving identity, sacrificing /ʤen′∙ɪ∙fɜr/ on my personal altar of assimilation in favor of the more Spanish-sounding /yen∙i:∙fer′/. Somehow, that wasn’t enough. More than once, I actually filled out official forms in a way that made my name appear Latin American, tacking my mother’s maiden name on at the end of my two given names and my father’s surname.\n\nGet Yourself Some Characters\n\nA few years later, I moved to mainland China. Following expat best practice, I adopted a Chinese name, loosely based on the phonetics of my birth name. I selected the family name 毕 (Bì) and the characters 珍琳 (ZhēnLín) for my given name. Unlike Latin America, where I had mastered the language and enthusiastically embraced the culture, slipping them on like a tailor-made suit, China would never allow me to assimilate. No matter how much I studied the language or how many cultural nuances I picked up on, I would always be an outsider. My Chinese name, however, felt like a beautiful mask I could hide behind. I practiced signing that name until my handwriting for those three characters no longer looked like it belonged a 6-year-old. I was inordinately proud of my bilingual business cards and delighted whenever a local colleague (whose business cards sported English names like Kobe, Happy, Tank, or Apple) told me that my assumed name was a good one, rich in meaning and authentic-sounding.\n\nSo I Married an Igbo Man\n\nI made my first (and only) legal name change when I took on my West African husband’s family name. Doing so felt right to me, even though I continued to use both surnames professionally. As Ms. Ugwu, I was granted access to subcultures I had previously known of in theory only, unlocking my right to wear traditional African prints without being accused of cultural assimilation, and attaining new levels of intimacy in my relationships with women of color. However, I’m ashamed to say that when the non-African people in my life found themselves unable to coherently articulate the four letters that spell my new surname, I would wave off their efforts and say, “Oh, don’t worry, it’s really hard to pronounce. No big deal. I know you mean well.”\n\nI wonder now how that made my husband feel. He certainly never waved anyone off when they couldn’t pronounce his name. He’d patiently model the correct pronunciation until people got it right, dignifying his name every time he said it aloud. Given my history as a name chameleon, I failed to see the importance of this.\n\nMy Name of Many Colors\n\nIt wasn’t until he wasn’t around anymore – he died prematurely – that I began to understand. When the responsibility of raising two beautiful brown girls as a single white woman fell on my shoulders, I started to talk less and listen more to the Black and African voices in my life. I read tweets and blog posts from Ijeoma Oluo and novels by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and the works of Chinua Achebe. I recalled the words of the poet Warsan Shire, thoughtfully inscribed on a card I received at my first daughter’s baby shower:\n\nSince then, I have begun to gently insist that you say my name, and you say it correctly. Say it correctly for my late husband, who cannot carry the name any longer. Say it correctly for my daughters, who carry the blood of two continents in their veins. Say it correctly for me, because personally and professionally, I carry it proudly.\n\nIt’s one long u, a hard g, a w, and another long u. Ug-wu. Jennifer Petersen, s-e-n, Ugwu.\n\nThis contribution to the deconstructed digital magazine VOICES comes from the Women's ThinkTank at Korn Ferry."
