        "text": "What is better for weekend reading than a story about a great dog? Jim the Wonder Dog became famous in the 1930s for his ability to follow instructions and to even predict the future. Animal behaviorists tell me that he was not psychic, but read the story and see what you think. He was an incredible dog! https://lnkd.in/gFkKapE\n\nAugust 14 is the date stipulated by the government to honor the incredible contribution made by the Navajo Code Talkers during World War II. The marines became desperate for an uncrackable code that could be used to discuss troop movements in the War in the Pacific. A fellow named Philip Johnston grew up on a Navajo Reservation, and he was the one who suggested recruiting the Navajo men to create a language. It was a tremendous success. The Japanese never cracked the code, and the US was so protective of it that they waited until 1968 to publicly reveal how communication in the Pacific Theater was handled. Here's the story of one of the Code Talkers: https://lnkd.in/exTnCHAk\n\nThis week the San Diego Zoo welcome two Giant Pandas to their zoo. China recalled most of the pandas in the US in recent years, so welcome a new pair is very exciting. Today animal specialists know so much about how to prepare the pandas for travel and how to take care of them to help with relocation. When the first Giant Panda was brought to the U.S. in 1937, they unwittingly did almost everything wrong. It's an eye-opening story: https://lnkd.in/eejqqnbB #giantpanda #sandiegozoo\n\nToday's Wall Street Journal (7-31-2024) ran a very interesting article about how police departments are having difficulty assessing when car drivers are high. Cannabis can be detected in a person for 2-3 days, but there is not yet a good way to judge level of impairment. Today we have a reliable system for measuring the level of impairment caused by alcohol, but ironically, those working on the \"drunk-o-meter,\" as it was called in the early 1900s, faced the same difficulty as scientists face today. Read what these professionals went through: https://lnkd.in/g8-qR_X\n\nThis year July 27 is celebrated as the National Day of the Cowboy/girl. Congress established this in 2008, noting that our way West was led by hardworking men and women who ventured into new territory. For many years, no one talked much about Black cowboys but there were many of them. Addison Jones was a well-respected cowboy who was also a range boss: https://lnkd.in/gNthses #nationaldayofthecowboy\n\nOne of the most rewarding aspects of running a website has to do with my being able to see what stories are of interest to readers on any given day. Today I was delighted to see that several people were reading \"Red State or Blue State: Your Vote Counts.\" This was an article I posted many years ago when I first started the website, and the presidential candidates were John McCain and Barack Obama. When I saw that the article was of interest---but out-of-date--I just updated it and have re-posted it. No matter where you live, your vote counts! This year--like all years---we need to be out there taking advantage of the privilege we have as citizens: https://lnkd.in/edw3dvFa If you read this short article, I don't think you'll disagree."
