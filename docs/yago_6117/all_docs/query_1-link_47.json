As he grew up, he was able to attend a prestigious school and become a lawyer.[1] At some point, he met Betsy from the Mesmer family. The two got married, with Betsy later becoming pregnant with his son.[2] At some point, Harold’s younger sister, Keigan, would visit him and help him with legal documentation.\n\nDuring his law career, Harold would accept a monetary bribe from his father-in-law in exchange for an innocent verdict on an upcoming law case against him. His wife would discover the documentation of this exchange and would alert Keigan to it.[3] Keigan, angered at her brother’s disregard for a proper trial, would take matters into her own hands and slowly begin poisoning his food. As a result, his health would deteriorate and he would begin to rely on Keigan more and more, leading to her taking his place as a judge.\n\nMentions[]\n\nLetters[]\n\nKeigan’s Character Day Letter (2024)\n\nDeductions[]\n\nClerk (Deduction Quests 3, 4)\n\nBackstories[]\n\nClerk's Official Website Backstory\n\nClerk’s Animated Background Story"
