This caused Neva to become incredibly obsessive.\n\nIn 1939, The Dandridge Sisters were invited to perform at the Palladium in London.\n\nNeva was their only escort.\n\nIt was during this trip that she took advantage of her position as caretaker and abused Dorothy.\n\nThis led Dorothy to distance herself from this group and declare her independence in order to go solo as a singer and actress.\n\nDorothy was only 16 at the time.\n\nHarold Nicholas - First Love & Marriage (1941)\n\nBy 1941, Dorothy was engaged to Harold Nicholas.\n\nAt the time, The Nicholas Brothers were cast as a performing number in the movie Sun Valley Serenade.\n\nHarold convinced the studio executives to cast Dorothy as well, citing that she would add talent and sex appeal to their number Chattanooga Chu-chu.\n\nThis was one of Dorothy’s big breaks.\n\nDorothy and Harold married on September 6, 1942.\n\nShe was just a few weeks away from turning 20. He was 22.\n\nTheir marriage had a rocky start.\n\nIn an interview many years later, Harold Nicholas explains that he was just a boy trying to act like a man.\n\nThis is to say that his wandering eye didn’t stop after he married Dorothy.\n\nNeither did his love for golf.\n\nHis disinterest led Dorothy to self-medicate on occasion.\n\nHarold Nicholas. - Nicholas Brothers - Stormy Weather\n\nDorothy & Harold Nicholas On Horseback\n\nDorothy Dandridge And Harold Nicholas\n\nDorothy Dandridge – And Harold Nicholas Dancing\n\nDorothy & Harold Welcome A Baby Girl!\n\nDorothy Dandridge, Harolyn Nicholas, & Ruby Dandridge\n\nDorothy Dandridge with Ruby Dandridge, & Daughter Harolyn\n\nHAROLYN SUZANNE NICHOLAS (1943)\n\nOn September 2, 1943, Dorothy gave birth to her only daughter, Harolyn Suzanne Nicholas.\n\nOn the day of her birth, Harold was playing golf.\n\nDorothy determined to find him, asked her loved ones to look for him instead of taking her to the hospital.\n\nBy the time she reached the hospital, without Harold, her baby was on the way.\n\nDorothy Dandridge & Harolyn Playing with Bubbles\n\nHarolyn Suzanne Nicholas was born with cerebral anoxia – which is when the brain is completely deprived of oxygen. The result was brain damage.\n\nShe couldn’t recognize people, not even her parents.\n\nThis caused Dorothy great heartache.\n\nShe blamed herself for waiting too long to give birth.\n\nWhile initially the birth of Harolyn strengthened their marriage, once symptoms of Harolyn’s condition started showing up, Harold started traveling frequently in search of answers for his daughter’s condition.\n\nDorothy Dandridge And Her Daughter, Harolyn Nicholas\n\nDorothy Dandridge, Harolyn Dandridge & Harold Nicholas\n\nDorothy Dandridge with Harolyn - Group Photo\n\nDorothy Dandridge: Back To Work & On Her Own (1948)\n\nArticle: Chills Run Up And Down \"Her\" Spine\n\nDorothy Dandridge - Performing\n\nDorothy Dandridge - The High Price Of Stardom\n\nIn 1948, Dorothy asked for a divorce. It was finalized in 1951.\n\nDorothy returned to work, given that she needed help with Harolyn’s care.\n\nIn 1948, she attended the Actors Laboratory in Hollywood, one of the top acting schools in America – and became one of the first black students.\n\nShe soon started working with Phil Moore, a jazz musician she met while performing in the Cotton Club with The Dandridge Sisters.\n\nHe helped her establish her glamorous onstage presence.\n\nHe also coached her with her singing and dancing.\n\nWith his help, she became a great on-stage performer.\n\nDorothy is singing & jazz musician Phil Moore plays piano in the background.\n\nDorothy Dandridge, Harry Belafonte, & Bright Road (1953)\n\nIn 1953, she starred alongside Harry Belafonte in Bright Road, which featured an all-black cast and Dorothy as a first-year elementary school teacher trying to reach out to a problematic student.\n\nThis acting role was far removed from her onstage persona and received great accolades.\n\nBright Road (1953) - Still\n\nDOROTHY’S GRAND AMBITION - BEING A WIFE AND MOTHER\n\nIt was around this time when, again, she began self-medicating.\n\nYes, she’d experienced great career success, but more than anything, she wanted to fill the role of wife and mother.\n\nThat was one of her life’s grand ambitions, but most of her relationships were short-lived and mired given that interracial relationships, which she had a few, were unacceptable and condemned at the time.\n\nThis heartache, paired with her guilt over Harolyn’s condition, was often too much for her, but she always seemed to overcome it.\n\nDorothy Dandridge & Harolyn Playing with Bubbles\n\nRise To Stardom: Carmen Jones (1954) & Academy Award Nomination\n\nCarmen Jones (1954)\n\nDorothy Dandridge & Harry Belafonte - Carmen Jones\n\nDorothy Dandridge as Carmen Jones\n\nDorothy Dandridge cheering for her man in Carmen Jones\n\nIn 1954, after great determination, Dorothy was cast as Carmen Jones in the movie adaptation of Carmen Jones – originally a Broadway musical.\n\nWhile the films’ musical numbers were dubbed for Dorothy – the director sought an opera singer instead of Dorothy’s melodic voice – Dorothy’s performance was riveting.\n\nThis performance catapulted her to A-List stardom and won her an Oscar nomination.\n\nThis nomination marked a historical moment.\n\nThis was the first time an African American had been nominated for an academy for a leading role.\n\nHer rivals were:\n\nWINNER – Grace Kelly – The Country Girl\n\nJudy Garland – A Star Is Born\n\nAudrey Hepburn – Sabrina\n\nJane Wyman – Magnificent Obsession\n\nCarmen Jones Flirting\n\nDorothy Dandridge & Harry Belafonte Jet Magazine\n\nDorothy Dandridge as Carmen Jones on the cover of LIFE MAGAZINE\n\nDorothy Dandridge -Article about her screen test for Carmen Jones\n\nDating Otto Preminger, Director of Carmen Jones\n\nOtto Preminger & Dorothy Dancing\n\nDorothy Celebrating with Otto Preminger & Vivian Dandridge\n\nOtto & Dorothy Celebrating\n\nFollowing this film’s success, Dorothy and Otto Preminger, the director of Carmen Jones, dated for a few years.\n\nAt the time, he was separated from his wife but still married.\n\nControlling in nature, he insisted that Dorothy only take leading roles, which weren’t readily available.\n\nEventually, offers dwindled.\n\nWhile her star had dimmed, she shone brightly whenever given an opportunity.\n\nFor example, her performance in Island in the Sun (1957) received great reviews, as did her work in the movie Porgy and Bess (1959).\n\nThe latter role provided her with a nomination for a Golden Globe.\n\nDorothy Dandridge – Toning for Porgy & Bess\n\nDorothy Dandridge - Afraid of Marriage\n\nSecond chance at happily ever after (1959)—Dorothy marries Jack Denison, Businessman\n\nDorothy Dandridge married Jack Denison, a hotel owner who’d pursued her extensively in 1959.\n\nThrough this marriage, she hoped to finally leave the limelight and settle down with her husband and family.\n\nAgain, it wasn’t meant to be.\n\nSoon after the wedding, she learned that he had massive debt and that he would need her to perform in his hotel, which she did.\n\nNot only did he provide her with financial strain, but he also proved to be incredibly possessive and violent.\n\nIn 1962, they divorced & soon after filed for bankruptcy.\n\nJack Denison & Dorothy Celebrating\n\nDorothy Dandridge: Gone too soon…\n\nFollowing her divorce, she sold her Hollywood home, placed her daughter in a mental institution, and moved into a small apartment.\n\nAgain, she began self-medicating and spoke cryptically about her life.\n\nDorothy passed away on September 8, 1965, due to an overdose of antidepressants.\n\nA few days earlier, she’d signed up to play in two films by producer Raul Fernandez.\n\nThis is just one reason why some believe that her death was foul play.\n\nDorothy Dandridge Enjoying The Sun\n\nActress-Singer Dorothy Dandridge Found Dead In Hollywood Home\n\nThe Death & Life Of Dorothy\n\nDorothy Dandridge Inspired Jewelry\n\nDesigning Vintage-Inspired Jewelry for Dorothy Dandridge in Bright Road and Carmen Jones (VIDEO)\n\nDorothy Dandridge in Bright Road as a new teacher, Miss. Richards.\n\n\"I wanted any black girl in the audience to look at me performing in this film and be able to say to herself, 'Why, this schoolteacher could be me.'\"\n\nDorothy Dandridge\n\nI watched a few of her movies to derive greater inspiration for a unique piece of jewelry inspired by Dorothy Dandridge.\n\nBright Road (1953): Movie adaptation of “See How They Run” by Mary Elizabeth Vroman\n\nBright Road - A New Star Is Born\n\nBRIGHT ROAD: Miss Richards teaching CJ\n\nFirst, I watched Bright Road.\n\nLittle did I know, but this was a book-to-movie adaptation.\n\nThe source material was written by an African-American teacher who wrote a series of short stories relating to her personal experience.\n\nThe film was a wonderful black-and-white production featuring an all-black cast.\n\nI loved it.\n\nI found it inspirational, beautifully shot, and something that a modern audience would also appreciate.\n\nBRIGHT ROAD - Miss Richards & CJ\n\nBright Road - Miss Richards with the town doctor\n\nBRIGHT ROAD: CJ Walking Home\n\nDorothy Dandridge behind the scenes with Harry Belafonte - BRIGHT ROAD\n\nCarmen Jones (1954): Best Actress Award Nominee & Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy\n\nBright Road - Miss Richards with the town doctor\n\nBRIGHT ROAD: CJ Walking Home\n\nI found the following excerpts on Wikipedia relating to Bright Road especially interesting:\n\nBright Road was not commercially successful [3] and was criticized for having \"dealt too timidly with racial and economic questions.\"[4] Dandridge, however, had been specifically attracted to the lack of racial conflict in Bright Road's story. She wrote that she was \"profoundly fond of ... a theme which showed that beneath any color skin, people were simply people. I had a feeling that themes like this might do more real good than the more hard-hitting protest pictures. I wanted any black girl in the audience to look at me performing in this film and be able to say to herself, 'Why, this schoolteacher could be me.'\"\n\n\"See How They Run\" by Mary Elizabeth Vroman (1951)\n\n\"See How They Run\" was Mary Elizabeth Vroman's first published short story, written while she was a schoolteacher in rural Alabama. First published in Ladies' Home Journal in 1951, it also appeared in Ebony magazine in 1952. When Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer purchased the rights to adapt the story to film, Vroman helped write the screenplay, and as a result, became the first black member of the Screen Writers Guild.[2]\n\nMary Elizabeth Vroman on the cover of JET\n\nWedding Bells for Mary Elizabeth Vroman\n\nCarmen Jones (1954): Best Actress Award Nominee & Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy\n\nCarmen Jones In Red Skirt & Black Top\n\nCarmen Jones in Pink Dress\n\nFollowing Bright Road, I watched Carmen Jones.\n\nThis film was made up of an almost entirely all-black cast.\n\nI loved watching a sassier version of Dorothy bringing Carmen Jones to life.\n\nThe costumes were amazing—everything from the military uniforms to glamourous gowns – 5/5 stars.\n\nUnfortunately, I wasn’t as big a fan of this film – which was a bit of a surprise to me as I generally love this kind of film.\n\nMy biggest complaint would be the dubbing of Dorothy’s musical parts.\n\nThey were distracting, and given that there was quite a bit of singing, it took me out of the story frequently.\n\nI think Otto Preminger, the director of Carmen Jones, would have been better off using Dorothy’s musical talents instead of hiring a trained opera singer.\n\nUnsurprisingly, many critics also struggled with the dubbing.\n\nCASTING DOROTHY AS CARMEN JONES (1954)\n\nOtto Preminger & Carmen Jones Cast - ON SET\n\nOtto Preminger & Carmen Jones Cast\n\nAfter watching Carmen Jones, I wanted to know more and was quite surprised to find that Dorothy wasn’t Otto Preminger’s first pick, given that she was “a beautiful butterfly” – but not Carmen.\n\nIncredible.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, Otto needed further convincing & Dorothy delivered via an exceptional portrayal of Carmen.\n\nHere's the excerpt from Wikipedia:\n\nPreminger was familiar with Dorothy Dandridge but felt she was incapable of exuding the sultry sex appeal the role of Carmen demanded, particularly after having seen Dandridge's performance as a demure schoolteacher opposite Belafonte in Bright Road (1953).[16] Her agent's office was in the same building where Preminger's brother Ingo worked, and he asked Ingo to intercede on his client's behalf. At his first meeting with Dandridge, Preminger told her she was \"lovely\" and looked like a \"model\" or \"a beautiful butterfly,\" but not Carmen,[17] and suggested she audition for the role of Cindy Lou. Dandridge took the script and left, and when she returned she was dressed and behaved exactly as Preminger envisioned Carmen. The director was impressed enough to schedule a screen test for mid-May, after Dandridge completed a singing engagement in St. Louis. In the interim he cast Juilliard School graduate Olga James as Cindy Lou.[18]\n\nVintage-Inspired Crystal Bracelet & Brooch for Dorothy Dandridge\n\nDorothy Dandridge Inspired Bracelet\n\n“It is easily overlooked that what is now called vintage was once brand new.”\n\nTony Visconti\n\nDesigning A Glamourous Bracelet Inspired by Dorothy's Onstage Presence\n\nGreen Crystal Bracelet - Before and After\n\nGreen Crystal Bracelet Inspired by Dorothy\n\nThe second piece I designed with Dorothy in mind is this enchanting green crystal bracelet.\n\nAccented with back beads and embroidery, I had visions of her performing in a nightclub in one of her snake-like dresses, holding her microphone, and showing off this elegant bracelet.\n\nToo much?\n\nI don’t think so.\n\nThe more I learn of Dorothy, the more I love her.\n\nMy biggest dream in life was to find the love of my life as well.\n\nI’m just so sad she didn’t get to that place in her life.\n\nI genuinely think she would have succeeded had she had a bit more time.\n\nAs for this piece, it’s dedicated to the one and only Dorothy Dandridge.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nGreen Crystal Bracelet\n\nDazzling Green Crystal Bracelet\n\nConclusion\n\nI know I’ve only scratched the surface of all that her life entailed, but I am so excited to dive deeper into her story in the future.\n\n* If you know that any part of these excerpts is false, please let me know.
