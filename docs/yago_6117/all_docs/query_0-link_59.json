        "text": "Background\n\nDorothy Jean Dandridge was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on November 9, 1922. She was of African-American descent. She was the youngest daughter of Ruby Dandridge, an actress, and Cyril Dandridge, a Baptist minister, and cabinet maker. She was raised by her mother since her parents separated before she was born. She did not attend school in her early years and instead, was trained to sing and dance with her elder sister, Vivian.\n\nDandridge’s career can be traced to her childhood when, in 1934, she began to perform with her sister as part of an act her mother called The Wonder Children. Later, they were joined by their friend Etta Jones, and the trio, under the new name of Dandridge Sisters, began to tour the U.S., performing at nightclubs, theaters, and Baptist churches. She made her screen debut the following year, in 1935, appearing in an uncredited role in the short comedy film “Teacher’s Beau.” In 1939, she and the Dandridge Sisters traveled to Europe, performing in England and Ireland. After returning to the U.S. in 1940, the trio split and Dandridge embarked on her solo career as a cabaret dancer and actress. Her first official screen role came that same year in the movie “Four Shall Die.” Rejecting stereotypical roles for black actors, in 1941, she appeared in small parts in the movies “Lady from Louisiana” and “Sundown.” That same year, she made her first appearance with the Nicholas Brothers in the movie “Sun Valley Serenade.” The next year, in 1942, she married Harold Nicholas, one of the Nicholas Brothers, and in 1943, she gave birth to her only child, a daughter named Harolyn Suzanne Nicholas. For the next few years, she continued to appear in movies, on stage, and in “soundies” (film clips displayed on jukeboxes). She came into the public eye for her wardrobe in the 1951 movie “Tarzan’s Peril” in which she appeared as Melmendi, Queen of the Ashuba, alongside Lex Barker and Virginia Huston. The interest generated by her wardrobe saw her being featured on the cover of “Ebony” magazine.\n\nIn 1953, she was cast in her first starring role in “Bright Road,” the first of many productions with Harry Belafonte. Her breakout role came as Carmen Jones in the 1954 movie “Carmen,” which established her as a star with a box office hit to her credit and positive critical acclaim. Later that year, she also became the first African-American woman to be featured on the cover of “Life” magazine. In 1955, she was nominated for the Best Actress award at the Oscars for “Carmen,” making her the first African-American woman to achieve the honor. That same year, she signed a three-movie deal with 20th Century Fox and also became the first African-American to open at Waldorf-Astoria’s Empire Room in New York. In 1957, she appeared in the movie “Island in the Sun,” which portrayed interracial romance, a controversial subject at the time, that became a successful hit. The following year, she appeared in a French-Italian movie “Tamango,” accepting the role of a slave only after learning that the film portrayed a successful slave revolt. The movie was banned in the U.S. but managed to achieve moderate success. In 1959, she made her first appearance in a Hollywood movie in five years in Samuel Goldwyn’s “Porgy and Bess,” which was commercially unsuccessful. In 1959, she married Jack Denison, a hotel owner, and appeared in her last completed film appearance in the movie “Malaga,” which was only released in 1960. In 1962, she made two appearances in a Highland Park Music Theater production of the play “West Side Story” but had to back out after an illness.\n\n1962 was a year of personal setbacks for her amid her divorce from Denison and the discovery of fraud by her financial managers, leading to her having to sell her house. 1963 marked the decline of Dandridge’s career and she struggled with unpaid dues, alcoholism, and troubled personal life. In 1964, she applied for bankruptcy and appeared in a lounge act in Las Vegas to make some money. The following year, attempting to revive her acting career, she signed to appear in a movie based on the outlaw Johnny Ringo. On September 12, 1965, she was found dead in her apartment from what was later declared to be a drug overdose. She was cremated the same day and her ashes were interred at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park at Freedom Mausoleum. She was posthumously awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1984. In 1999, a previously unreleased album recorded by Dandridge was released."
