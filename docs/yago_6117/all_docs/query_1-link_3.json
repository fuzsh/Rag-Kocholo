        "text": "American entertainment act\n\nThe Nicholas Brothers were an entertainment act composed of brothers, Fayard (1914–2006) and Harold (1921–2000), who excelled in a variety of dance techniques, primarily between the 1930s and 1950s. Best known for their unique interpretation of a highly acrobatic technique known as \"flash dancing\", they were also considered by many to be the greatest tap dancers of their day, if not all time. Their virtuoso performance in the musical number \"Jumpin' Jive\" (with Cab Calloway and his orchestra) featured in the 1943 movie Stormy Weather has been praised as one of the greatest dance routines ever captured on film.\n\nGrowing up surrounded by vaudeville acts as children, they became stars of the jazz circuit during the Harlem Renaissance and performed on stage, film, and television well into the 1990s. Diminutive in size, they were appreciated for their artistry, innovation, and soaring leaps.\n\nEarly lives\n\n[edit]\n\nFayard Antonio Nicholas was born October 20, 1914, in Mobile, Alabama,[1] and Harold Lloyd Nicholas was born March 17, 1921, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina,[1] to Viola Harden (maiden; 1893–1971), a pianist, and Ulysses Dominick Nicholas (1892–1935), a drummer.\n\nThe Nicholas Brothers grew up in Philadelphia, the sons of college-educated musicians who played in their own band at the Standard Theater. At the age of three, Fayard would always sit in the front row while his parents worked, and by the time he was ten, he had seen most of the great African-American vaudeville acts—particularly the dancers, including such notables of the time as Alice Whitman, Willie Bryant, and Bill Robinson.[2] The brothers were fascinated by the combination of tap dancing and acrobatics. Fayard often imitated their acrobatics and clowning for the kids in his neighborhood.[2]\n\nNeither Fayard nor Harold had any formal dance training.[3] Fayard taught himself how to dance, sing, and perform by watching and imitating the professional entertainers on stage. He then taught his younger siblings, first performing with his sister Dorothy as the Nicholas Kids, later joined by Harold. Harold idolized his older brother and learned by copying his moves and distinct style. Dorothy later opted out of the act, and the Nicholas Kids became known as the Nicholas Brothers.[4]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nAs word spread of their talents, the Nicholas Brothers became known around Philadelphia. They were first hired for a radio program, The Horn and Hardart Kiddie Hour, and then by other local theatres such as the Standard and the Pearl. When they were performing at the Pearl, the manager of The Lafayette, a New York vaudeville showcase, saw them and immediately wanted them to perform for his theater.[2]\n\nThe brothers moved to Philadelphia in 1926 and gave their first performance at the Standard a few years later.[5] In 1932, they became the featured act at Harlem's Cotton Club when Harold was 11 and Fayard was 18. They astonished their mainly white audiences dancing to the jazz tempos of \"Bugle Call Rag\"; they were the only entertainers in the African-American cast allowed to mingle with white patrons.[3] They performed at the Cotton Club for two years, working with the orchestras of Lucky Millinder, Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington, and Jimmy Lunceford. During this time, they made their uncredited movie debut, in the 1932 short Pie, Pie Blackbird, featuring Eubie Blake and his orchestra.[2][6] The brothers attributed their success to their unique style of dancing - a hybrid of tap dance, ballet, and acrobatics sometimes called \"acrobatic dancing\" or \"flash dancing\" [1] - which was greatly in demand during this time.[7]\n\nProducer Samuel Goldwyn saw them at the Cotton Club and invited them to California to be a part of Kid Millions (1934), their first performances in a Hollywood movie. The brothers made their Broadway debut in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1936 and also appeared in Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart's musical Babes in Arms in 1937. They impressed their choreographer, George Balanchine, who invited them to appear in Babes in Arms. With Balanchine's training, they learned many new stunts. Their talent led many to presume they were trained ballet dancers.[8]\n\nBy 1940, they had moved to Hollywood and for several decades divided their time between movies, nightclubs, concerts, Broadway, television, and extensive tours of Latin America, Africa, and Europe.[1] They toured England with a production of Blackbirds.[2] They gave a Royal Command Performance at the London Paladium for King George VI in 1948.[6]\n\nIn 1991, the Nicholas Brothers received Kennedy Center Honors in recognition of their six decades of achievements. A year later, a documentary film, We Sing & We Dance, celebrated their careers and included tributes from Mikhail Baryshnikov, Gregory Hines, M.C. Hammer, and Clarke Peters. In 1994, members of the cast of Hot Shoe Shuffle also paid them tribute.[9]\n\nTeaching\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Nicholas Brothers taught master classes in tap dance as teachers-in-residence at Harvard University and Radcliffe at Ruth Page Visiting Artists. Among their known students are Debbie Allen, Janet Jackson, and Michael Jackson.[2] Several of today's master tap dancers have performed with or been taught by the brothers: Dianne Walker, Sam Weber, Lane Alexander, Mark Mendonca, Terry Brock,[10] Colburn Kids Tap/L.A, Channing Cook Holmes,[11] Chris Baker, Artis Brienzo, Chester Whitmore, Darlene Gist, Chris Scott, Tobius Tak,[12] Carol Zee, and Steve Zee.[13]\n\nStyle and moves\n\n[edit]\n\nExternal videos Stormy Weather in color - The Nicholas Brothers and Cab Calloway - Colorized with DeOldify\n\nThe brothers were particularly known for their expressive use of their hands and arms while dancing, particularly tap. One of their signature moves was to leapfrog down a long, broad flight of stairs, completing each step with a split. Its best remembered performance is in the finale of the movie Stormy Weather (1943).[3] In that routine, the Nicholas Brothers leapt exuberantly across the orchestra's music stands and danced on the top of a grand piano in a call and response act with the pianist, to the tune of \"Jumpin' Jive\".[3] Fred Astaire once told the brothers that this dance number was the greatest number he had ever seen on film.[14] Numerous articles have been written about this whole dance being filmed in one take and unrehearsed. As unbelievable as that sounds, the Nicholas Brothers confirmed it in an interview shortly before their recognition at the 14th Annual Kennedy Center Honors. The choreographer, Nick Castle, said, \"Just do it. Don`t rehearse it, just do it.\" And so it was done, unrehearsed and in one take, which relieved Harold Nicholas because he did not want to do the rigorous routine over and over all night.[15][3][16]\n\nIn another signature move, they would rise from a split without using their hands.[3] Gregory Hines declared that if their biography were ever filmed, their dance numbers would have to be computer-generated because no one now could emulate them.[3] Ballet legend Mikhail Baryshnikov once called them the most amazing dancers he had ever seen in his life.[17]\n\nPersonal lives\n\n[edit]\n\nFayard\n\n[edit]\n\nFayard married four times. His marriage to Geraldine Pate lasted from 1942 until their divorce in 1955.[18][19] That year, he married Mexican dancer Victoria Barron.[20][21] As of May 1960, that marriage remained intact, with \"Vicky\" also working alongside Fayard professionally.[22] He married Barbara January in 1967,[19] the same year he converted to the Baháʼí Faith,[23] and they remained together until her death in 1998. He married Katherine Hopkins in 2000.[24]\n\nHe died on January 24, 2006, of pneumonia contracted after a stroke.[3] His memorial service, presided over by Mary Jean Valente of A Ceremony of the Heart, was standing-room only and featured personal tributes, music, dance, and one last standing ovation.[25]\n\nTwo of Fayard's granddaughters dance as the \"Nicholas Sisters\" [26] and have won awards for their performances.[27]\n\nHarold\n\n[edit]\n\nHarold was married three times.[28] From 1942 to 1951, he was married to singer and actress Dorothy Dandridge, with whom he had one child, Harolyn Nicholas, who was born with a severe intellectual disability[29] In Paris, he had a son, Melih Nicholas, with his second wife Elayne Patronne. He lived on New York's Upper West Side for twenty years with his third wife, producer and former Miss Sweden, Rigmor Alfredsson Newman.[citation needed] Harold died July 3, 2000, of a heart attack following minor surgery.[30][31]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to a Los Angeles Times article on the brothers, \"Because of racial prejudice, they appeared as guest artists, isolated from the plot, in many of their films. This was a strategy that allowed their scenes to be easily deleted for screening in the Jim Crow-era South\".[32]\n\nPie, Pie Blackbird (1932) (short subject) (uncredited)\n\nThe Emperor Jones (1933) (Harold Nicholas)\n\nSyncopancy (1933) (short subject) (Harold Nicholas)\n\nKid Millions (1934)\n\nAn All-Colored Vaudeville Show (1935) (short subject)\n\nCoronado (1935)\n\nThe Big Broadcast of 1936 (1935)\n\nThe Black Network (1936) (short subject)\n\nMy American Wife (1936)\n\nBabes in Arms (1937)\n\nCalling All Stars (1937)\n\nMy Son Is Guilty (1939)\n\nDown Argentine Way (1940)\n\nTin Pan Alley (1940)\n\nThe Great American Broadcast (1941)\n\nSun Valley Serenade (1941)\n\nOrchestra Wives (1942)\n\nStormy Weather (1943)\n\nTake It or Leave It (1944)\n\nThe Reckless Age (1944) (Harold Nicholas)\n\nCarolina Blues (1944) (Harold Nicholas)\n\nDixieland Jamboree (1946) (short subject)\n\nThe Pirate (1948)\n\nPathe Newsreel (1948)\n\nI'm in the Revue (1950)\n\nEl Misterio del carro express (1953)\n\nEl Mensaje de la muerte (1953)\n\nMusik im Blut (1955)\n\nBonjour Kathrin (1956)\n\nL'Empire de la nuit (1963) (Harold Nicholas)\n\nThe Liberation of L.B.
