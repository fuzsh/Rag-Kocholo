        "text": "joanne ostrowBerry lives legend of Dandridge\n\nBy Joanne Ostrow\n\nDenver Post TV/Radio Critic\n\nAugust 19 - Dorothy Dandridge was Hollywood's first black bombshell. A fleeting icon of the '50s, she was internationally acclaimed and full of potential.\n\nWhitney Houston, Janet Jackson and Vanessa Williams all have wanted to play her. It was Halle Berry's determination and personal identification with the star that helped see through the first Dandridge movie biography.\n\nBerry produced and stars in a powerful film that fills in an overlooked chapter of Hollywood history. \"Introducing Dorothy Dandridge'' debuts Saturday at 7 p.m. on HBO.\n\nIt's a story of exceptional beauty and talent thwarted by racism.\n\nThe first black woman nominated for a best actress Oscar, for her starring role in \"Carmen Jones,'' Dandridge should have been bigger than Marilyn; as a singer and dancer, she could have outdistanced Lena Horne.\n\nEarly in the movie, Dandridge hangs with Monroe and Ava Gardner under a piano at a swinging party. In fact, they were her friends. Today, Dandridge's name is hardly well-known. She deserves to be remembered alongside Monroe as an early casualty of Hollywood.\n\nThe facts of Dandridge's life are exceptionally grim. Raised by her mother, a player on the old \"Amos 'n' Andy'' TV show, she was abused as a girl by her mother's violent lesbian lover. Working at the Cotton Club, Dandridge married Harold Nicholas of the tap-dancing Nicholas Brothers, and then was devastated by the birth of their severely retarded daughter. She somehow blamed herself; the marriage ended badly.\n\nDead at age 42\n\nProfessionally blocked by racism, she was jilted by her married lover, the director Otto Preminger, and later driven to bankruptcy by an abusive husband. Dandridge was found dead at 42 in 1965 in what may have been a suicide. More likely it was the accidental result of years of self-destruction, with help from pills and alcohol.\n\nThrough it all, Dandridge broke barriers while being treated miserably. Touring the country on the nightclub circuit, playing Las Vegas and Miami, Dandridge was received as a glamorous star on stage, but denied access to the pool and bathroom backstage. The elegant lady was required to use the service entrance before and after performing.\n\nIn the film's most memorable scene, taken from the biography by her longtime manager Earl Mills, Dandridge pointedly breaks the hotel rule by appearing at the pool in glamorous swimwear and dipping her foot in the water. The hotel responds by having the pool drained and scrubbed.\n\nA successful singer-dancer, Dandridge desperately wanted to make the crossover to dramatic actress. (Horne, while appearing in MGM musicals, never made the crossover to interacting with white characters in leading roles, either.)\n\nIn some ways, Dandridge's dilemmas are not unfamiliar to the producer and star of this biography. Until now, Berry hasn't found a part big enough to take advantage of her talents. Her last TV role was as the daughter of an upper-crust black family who wants to marry a white man in ABC's \"The Wedding.'' On the big screen, she had a meaty role in Warren Beatty's \"Bulworth.''\n\nBerry fought for years to bring Dandridge's story to the screen. Several film studios rejected the script. Berry had trouble convincing the industry that anyone would want to see a movie about a little-known African-American woman.\n\nHBO, which has tackled stories of racism and bigotry before, stepped up to the task. Their confidence pays off.\n\nBerry's on-screen magnetism is unmistakable. Singing and dancing in sexy stage numbers or breaking down in emotional distress, she consumes the ambitious role. It may be her best performance to date.\n\nAfter two hours of heartbreaking storytelling, viewers will be wiser if sadder. Dandridge rose to the heights scaled by few actresses of any race. The residual feeling after following her dynamic rise and devastating fall is: What a life, what a waste. And what if ...?\n\nTonight on TV\n\n\"A Bill Moyers Special: Free Speech For Sale'' at 5:30 p.m. on KBDI-Channel 12 is a recent production focusing on political influences by large corporations. Under scrutiny are hog farming and media ownership."
