        "text": "“Introducing Dorothy Dandridge,” as the title suggests, will most likely be an education for many viewers. This film marks a big step in recognizing the contributions of Dandridge, a woman who made Hollywood accessible for other black actors, but as a biography, it only begins to explore the psyche of such a complex star.\n\nBased on the book “Dorothy Dandridge” by the star’s former manager Earl Mills , this film focuses heavily on her career, and like her Hollywood peer Marilyn Monroe, Dandridge’s personal and professional life were complexly intertwined.\n\nCoolidge chooses to take us through Dandridge’s life through a series of flashbacks as the fading star recalls the events of her life in one of her notorious latenight phone calls to her best friend Geri Nicholas (Tamara Taylor).\n\nOften described by the white press as sepia-skinned or cafe au lait colored, Dandridge bought into the beauty myth that brought her instant attention, but made waves by refusing to play stereotypical black roles in movies. Her real fame came by landing and nailing the lead role of Carmen in the controversial musical “Carmen Jones” by helmer Otto Preminger (Klaus Maria Brandauer).\n\nThrough the film, we learn that Dandridge was traumatized by a sexual assault by her mother’s lesbian lover, which caused a lifetime of intimacy problems, she had two failed marriages and a mentally challenged daughter who had to be institutionalized. Dandridge, while gutsy and determined when it came to her career, had a bad head for business, and allowed her finances to be colossally mismanaged.\n\nDandridge’s tragic tale is not unique to Hollywood, but it is important. The entertainment field in the 1950s was a place where minorities could excel, but it also offered a cruel dichotomy: Although Dandridge could make the cover of Life magazine, she was not allowed to swim in a hotel pool in Las Vegas.\n\nTime and again, Dandridge was called upon by her agents and lovers to conjure up the strength and courage to break down racial barriers, but they did not offer the same strength in return. Preminger, with whom she had a tumultuous affair, talked her out of taking roles, which many speculate hurt her career.\n\nIt would have been easy for Coolidge and writers Shonda Rhimes and Scott Abbot to attribute Dandridge’s career failings to her weakness for choosing the wrong men, but as in the case of Monroe, the truth is far more complicated.\n\nDandridge placed far too much emphasis on her beauty, and as she got older, self-doubt undermined her natural ability. She was also plagued with guilt over her daughter and mismanaged career. The movie ends with her death from a prescription drug overdose at 42, on the eve of her supposed comeback tour.\n\nAs Dandridge, Berry is sexy and innocent, breathy and every bit as beautiful as the glamorous star. The role is that of a damaged beauty — but not a pitiful one — and Berry hits the mark whether it calls for sultry or sullen.\n\nOne wonders if Dandridge would have had the nerve to take a role like this, which calls for some decidedly unglamorous scenes.\n\nBrent Spiner, as the put-upon Mills, none-too-surprisingly gets saintly treatment, but he handles the duty well, playing the softer moments as poignant and not saccharine.\n\nBrandauer makes for a fascinating Preminger, bringing out both the bulldog and puppy dog in the notoriously difficult director. Other supporting roles, including that of Dandridge’s actress mother, played by Loretta Devine, and D.B. Sweeney as her abusive second husband Jack Dennison, however, are far too brief.\n\nDance sequences are impeccable, as are production designer James Spencer’s meticulous re-creations of famous nightclubs and movie sets. Tech credits are polished, accentuated by a jazzy musical score by Elmer Bernstein."
