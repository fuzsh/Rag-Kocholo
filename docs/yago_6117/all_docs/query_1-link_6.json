        "text": "Tony Nicholas was born in Los Angeles, California, the grandson of vaudeville performers from Alabama and the son of the most famous dancing family of all time, the Nicholas Brothers.\n\nHis father, Fayard Nicholas, was one half of the Nicholas Brothers, and his mother was an organizer and activist who studied under Paul Robeson. His uncle, Harold Nicholas, married the famous Hollywood star Dorothy Dandridge, and Nicholas grew up in warm and loving environment where African American notables like Nat King Cole and others were often in his family’s home.\n\nTony Nicholas spent the first five years of his life in Europe, traveling with his family and performing in front of dignitaries and royals, including Queen Elizabeth. He also performed in front of Pope Pius XII.\n\nTony Nicholas’ stepfather, Leo Branton, a renowned civil rights and entertainment attorney, was also a special figure in his life. Later on, the family became close to Rosa Parks, who wintered with the family in Los Angeles during the last ten years of her life.\n\nHe attended Los Angeles City College before serving in the US Army from 1966 to 1968. He later obtained a Master’s Degree in Education from Antioch College. He has since devoted much of his life to the care for veterans and veterans’ families, serving as president of the Veterans Commission for the City of Los Angeles. For his activities on behalf of veterans, he has received a Presidential Citation from President Jimmy Carter and more than 40 awards from the city of Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, the state of California, and the federal government.\n\nHe has been married for more than 40 years, has three children and five great grandchildren."
