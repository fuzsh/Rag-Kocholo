Former Brooklyn Nets assistant Kyle Korver is joining the Hawks front office.

NBA insider Shams Charania reports that Korver is getting a promotion, with his official title with the Hawks being Director of Player Affairs and Development.

Korver is a former Atlanta Hawks sharpshooter, making him the perfect addition to the organization. He was a one-time All-Star in Atlanta and served in player development in Brooklyn. Korver played for the Hawks for five years, where he quickly became a fan-favorite.

Korver was drafted in 2003 at 51st overall, before he bounced around the league playing for the Sixers, Jazz, Bulls, Hawks, Cavaliers, and Bucks. Korver served as a part-time TV analyst during his short retirement from working with an NBA team.

With Korver leaving the organization, the Nets have lost a major piece their coaching staff.
