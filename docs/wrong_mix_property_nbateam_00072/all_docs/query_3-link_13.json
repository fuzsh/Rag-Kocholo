He was a one-time All-Star in Atlanta and served in player development in Brooklyn. Korver played for the Hawks for five years, where he quickly became a fan-favorite.\n\nKorver was drafted in 2003 at 51st overall, before he bounced around the league playing for the Sixers, Jazz, Bulls, Hawks, Cavaliers, and Bucks. Korver served as a part-time TV analyst during his short retirement from working with an NBA team.\n\nWith Korver leaving the organization, the Nets have lost a major piece their coaching staff."
