        "text": "The entire Hawks organization is going through a re-shuffling, and it’s not slowing down anytime soon. A few weeks ago, Travis Schlenk stepped down as GM, relieving his duties to Landry Fields, who was the Assistant GM. Now, the Hawks have filled Fields’ old role with a familiar face, as Adrian Wojnarowski reports Kyle Korver is taking over as Assistant GM.\n\nI’m not sure what’s going on with the Hawks behind the scenes, but it at least looks as if they have a plan with how they are approaching their front office, hiring fresh faces that have fantastic relationships with current players.\n\nKorver last played in the NBA in 2019-2020 with the Bucks; however, his best years and only All-Star season came with the Hawks from 2012-2017. As Wojnarowski notes, he had been serving as the team’s director of affairs/development this season before the promotion.\n\nThe movement in Atlanta’s front office is likely not done, but the most substantial changes could be coming soon with the guys on the floor. Nate McMillan‘s seat is on fire, and with the trade deadline approaching, many expect the Hawks to make some significant trades.\n\nThis season has gone about as poorly as one could have imagined at the start of the campaign. The Hawks sit in 9th place in the Eastern Conference standings with a 19-22 record. If things don’t change dramatically over the next month, a major shake up could be in store.\n\n—\n\nPhoto: Jevone Moore/Icon Sportswire"
