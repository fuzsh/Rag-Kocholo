        "text": "After a standout 17-year playing career where he was known as one of the best 3-point shooters in NBA history, Kyle Korver could be taking it easy, spending some time out of the public eye while relaxing with family and friends.\n\nInstead, he appears weekly on TNT’s ‘The Arena,’ which discusses current social and societal issues leading into the network’s flagship Thursday ‘Inside The NBA’ pregame show, leaning into issues about race and culture where other programs may try to shy away from such difficult conversations.\n\nBefore deciding to publish a widely-read, highly praised piece in The Players Tribune called Privileged in April 2019, the 39-year-old was on the Utah Jazz and bouncing some ideas off of teammate Ekpe Udoh.\n\n“He’s like ‘Kyle, this is great that you wanna say these things, but if you’re gonna say these things you have to realize that you have to stay in,’” Korver said. “‘This isn’t something that you step in, drop something and step back out. This is gonna be life work for you from here on out.’ And that’s how I view it. This is an opportunity that came about and I felt like something that hopefully I can bring a perspective and thoughts that can be helpful in these conversations.”\n\nAlongside regular co-hosts including Cari Champion and Bakari Sellers, Korver believes it’s still important for him to be involved in this overall conversation about racial issues in America even if he doesn’t have the same exact perspective of his Black counterparts on the show.\n\n“We need to continue to get more white Americans, white people, engaged. And the sad truth is that sometimes if a person of color speaks about racism, it can fall on deaf ears,” the California native said. “This is a hard thing for me to say, but it’s really true. Sometimes if a white person says it first, some people are a little more open to it. The way I’ve found to be helpful is if I can share my own stories.”\n\nKorver doesn’t try to pretend to be an expert, he said, or to have the answers. But he’s there to recount his story and provide his experiences, which he’s now had plenty of over the course of a long NBA career that included an All-Star appearance. And over time, especially since publishing his breakout article, he fully and openly acknowledges the privileged life he’s led. If anyone was further along in life because of where he lived and who his friends were, it was Korver.\n\n“But I still realize, especially these last bunch of years, that I just live with so many blind spots and I have so many things that I don’t understand, and I’ve been complicit in so many ways in my life just because as a white man, I have privilege,” he said. “And this is a country where white supremacy is still intricately laced into our systems, that oftentimes I can’t see things outside of the perspectives that I naturally have. So I think, especially in the last year, a lot of white folk have understood that there’s a need for their voice.”\n\nKorver hopes he can break down an early barrier to conversation, be helpful and take on questions about privilege, white supremacy and the differences between Black Lives Matter and when people say All Lives Matter.\n\n“We’re certainly seeing the need for that right now in our country.”\n\nDuring a summer of protests all across the U.S. against systemic racism and police violence, Korver was in the NBA’s bubble in Orlando playing for the Milwaukee Bucks. He and players from across the league saw the ordinary pre and postgame interviews they gave as a platform and an opportunity to speak out on various societal issues they felt were important. And after Jacob Blake was shot by police in Kenosha, WI., on Aug. 23, Korver said he could sense the frustration among his teammates and other players, wondering whether what they were saying was actually being heard or making a difference.\n\n“I think in that moment, our team being from Milwaukee and being so close to Kenosha and the story, guys wanted to try to take the next step and we didn’t know what that looked like,” he said.\n\nThe protests went from the streets to the bubble on Aug. 26, with Korver following his Bucks teammates George Hill and Sterling Brown.\n\n“For me in that moment, there’s the understanding that as a white man, I’m not supposed to lead,” Korver said. “The most powerful or best thing I could do was stand with you. And I’m for you.”\n\nThe Bucks famously sat out that afternoon’s Game 5 first round matchup against the Orlando Magic in protest of Blake’s shooting and other incidents, setting off a chain reaction where players refused to play that day across the NBA, WNBA, Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer, making history while setting an example for pro and college athletes to make a difference on the court simply by not playing.\n\n“There wasn’t even a second thought. This was the right thing to do,” Korver said. “But I don’t really feel that great talking about myself in that moment. It was our team and the leadership of a couple guys in the team that really made that happen. And then watching everything else in Orlando and the rest of the teams and other leagues standing with us that really made that moment what it was.”\n\nTwo other instances of police violence endured by Korver’s teammates helped shape his devotion to actively speaking out and being a reliable front-facing ally to such causes.\n\nIn 2018, Brown was stopped by police for illegally parking across two disabled spots at a Milwaukee Walgreens. As officers wrote up his citation, one allegedly became angry that Brown wouldn’t take his hands out of his pockets. Body camera footage from the scene shows several officers taking the young Bucks guard to the ground and using stun guns to subdue him. The city later admitted wrongdoing and settled a lawsuit for $750,000.\n\nIn 2014 while on the Atlanta Hawks, Korver’s teammate Thabo Sefolosha encountered an even worse case of excessive force by police . Sefolosha was at New York City nightclub 1OAK the night Indiana Pacers player Chris Copeland was stabbed in an unrelated incident. As the NYPD was trying to clear the block, Sefolosha got into an argument with one of the officers and several officers knocked him to the ground and arrested him, breaking his right fibula in the process, ending his season. Sefolosha was found not guilty in court on several charges and ultimately settled a federal lawsuit against the police department for $4 million.\n\nSefolosha’s story was really eye-opening for Korver, who initially wondered why he was out there in the first place and how he possibly could’ve put himself in that position.\n\n“For me and for my thoughts to directly go to Thabo and not understand it’s a whole different story when you’re a Black man,” Korver said, “that was a big moment for me with some of these initial blind spots that I was able to see.”\n\nBefore the world shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic, Korver said he was talking to a veteran Black teammate who’d never gotten in any trouble with the law, someone the Creighton product described as a tall, powerful man.\n\n“With tears in his eyes, he told me ‘my biggest fear in life is something happening to my wife and my kids, them getting sick. My second-biggest fear in life is getting pulled over by the police,’” Korver said. “And when he tells that to me with tears running down his face, that gives me a whole new perspective and lens for how I’m going to see this.”\n\nKorver said that most white people don’t have these Black friends or other people of color to speak candidly with and get told these stories, which would help lend much needed perspective on some of the most important issues they regularly have to confront.\n\n“We’re still a segregated country in a lot of ways in who we interact with and who we do life with,” he said. “And certainly I think part of what I hope to be is a bridge in that I can bring some of these stories and conversations to white folk who wouldn’t hear them otherwise, who wouldn’t know these stories otherwise.”\n\nSpeaking out in The Players Tribune just under two years ago was just the beginning of Korver speaking out publicly about race and other societal issues. And while he wasn’t too comfortable at the time, he knew it was the right thing to do.\n\n“We’re all on a journey and we’re all learning how to be more thoughtful and to see more clearly,” he said.\n\nAnd for Korver, that journey is a continual one, one he’s taking each week on national television, tackling divisive and contentious subjects, instead of just taking the easy way out after a long playing career and standing silent on the sidelines."
