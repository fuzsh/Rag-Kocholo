        "text": "Atlanta Hawks fans will be pleased about their teamâ€™s latest hire.\n\nShams Charania of The Athletic reported on Tuesday that the Hawks are finalizing the hire of former NBA sharpshooter Kyle Korver to their front office.\n\nKorver, 41, played for 17 seasons in the NBA, including five in Atlanta from 2012 to 2017. He was a beloved Hawk, making the All-Star team in 2015, a year that was also the winningest season in Hawks franchise history. Korver is remembered as one of the most accurate, productive 3-point shooters to ever play in the league. His 2,450 career triples rank fifth all time, and his 42.9 percent career mark from deep ranks tenth."
