        "text": "Things are business as usual for the Chicago Bulls' front office, who just made a bad decision in trading Jimmy Butler to the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nFormer Chicago Bulls head coach Tom Thibodeau had a great Thursday night.\n\nFinally getting the chance at ultimate revenge against the organization that left him high-and-dry, Thibodeau orchestrated a trade for the ages with general manager Gar Forman and vice president of basketball operations John Paxson.\n\nThibodeau, who is not just the Minnesota Timberwolves' head coach but also president of basketball operations, proposed a deal that would send Jimmy Butler and the No. 16 pick his way for Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn and the No. 7 pick.\n\nAnd of course, the Bulls' front office bit, resulting in not just a Butler/Thibodeau reunion, but the five-year Chicago coach fleecing the heck out of his former employers.\n\nTherefore, to say Thibodeau had plenty to celebrate during the 2017 NBA Draft would be an understatement.\n\nNow Butler has been at the center of league trade rumors for quite some time now. While most reports had the Boston Celtics gunning for the 27-year-old over the majority of last season, the Cleveland Cavaliers recently emerged as an interested party as well.\n\nHowever, between Butler himself preaching his loyalty to the Bulls and Paxson recently giving an interview indicating they were not interested in letting their star go, most took the buzz for nothing more than just that: empty chatter.\n\nBut the truth is, no one should be surprised at Thursday night's bad decision.\n\nBecause while Paxson may have said Butler was not going anywhere, he was also the one who started the narrative of \"younger and more athletic,\" right before Chicago signed both Rajon Rondo and Dwyane Wade.\n\nNot to mention that making poor calls has sort of become the franchise's identity — firing Thibodeau being a prime example of such.\n\nThere was also trading away Derrick Rose (and Justin Holiday and a 2017 second round pick) for Robin Lopez, Jose Calderon and Jerian Grant. And perhaps an even worse deal of giving Taj Gibson, Doug McDermott and a 2018 second round pick to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Cameron Payne, Anthony Morrow and Joffrey Lauvergne.\n\nEven getting rid of Tony Snell for Michael Carter-Williams was the wrong play.\n\nNever mind trading away Kyle Korver, a move most Bulls fans will never forgive them for.\n\nSo although Butler's departure may have been a blow in the moment, fans have no reason to be shocked by the news; unfortunately, illogical proceedings should always be expected when it comes to this front office.\n\nTrading Butler may not have been the wrong decision per se, but it cannot be denied that the front office virtually gave a top-15 player away for free. Which is where the disappointment lies.\n\nIt gets better though.\n\nChicago also gave away its second round pick in Jordan Bell, away to the Golden State Warriors for cash considerations. Not exactly a great idea when you are supposedly trying to enter a youth movement.\n\nWant more? Despite drafting Lauri Markkanen, a clear replacement for Nikola Mirotic, it turns out the Bulls are planning on re-signing him too.\n\nWhat the duo of Forman and Paxson are thinking at this point, is anyone's guess.\n\nCongratulations to Tom Thibodeau. Chicago Bulls fans, keep hanging in there.\n\nMore from Hoops Habit\n\nThis article originally appeared on"
