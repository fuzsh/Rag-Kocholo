        "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY — The Cavaliers took a wrong and made it right by trading Kyle Korver to the Utah Jazz.\n\n“I’m thankful that Koby (Altman) and management were upfront and mindful of my family through this process and are sending us to a great city and organization,” Korver told The Athletic on Wednesday, hours after the Cavs agreed to ship him to the Jazz for Alec Burks and two second-round picks. The trade is not yet official.\n\nSalt Lake City, Korver said, is where he met his wife, Juliet, when he played for the Jazz previously from 2007-10.\n\n“We have lots of friendships there, which will soften the landing,” Korver said.\n\nOK, here’s the mess the Cavs cleaned up by trading Korver to Utah.\n\nLast summer, Korver asked the Cavs to keep their word and move him (either by trade or buyout) because LeBron James was gone. It was the gentlemen’s agreement Korver struck with the front office when he re-signed with Cleveland in July 2017.\n\nIf James left as a free agent the following summer, triggering an automatic rebuild, Korver wanted a trade or freedom to go elsewhere so he wouldn’t have to move his family in the middle of the season.\n\nThe Cavs rebuffed his request when he came calling this past July, telling him they intended to compete this season and he would play a key role. We all know how that turned out — last night’s 100-83 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder dropped the Cavs to 4-16 this season. They’re steamrolling toward the lottery. Korver was even told after just two games that he’d lose playing time so the Cavs could give more minutes to younger players, though he was reinstalled to the rotation after that.\n\nWhen it became abundantly clear the team would have no chance of making the playoffs this season, when Kevin Love was lost for months to toe surgery and coach Tyronn Lue was fired and they fell to 1-11, the Cavs turned toward trading Korver. Interest was high and offers were fielded. They kept Korver in the loop and ultimately moved him to a place where he, his wife, and their three children will be comfortable from familiarity.\n\nKorver flew home to Cleveland on Wednesday night, commercially, with a connection, so he could tell his children in person he’d been traded.\n\n“I think it’s because he earned that respect from the franchise,” Tristan Thompson said, when asked about the Cavs’ trading of Korver to Utah, specifically. “When you come in every day and do the right things as a pro, work your butt off and you don’t do nothing to jeopardize the organization, they are going to look out for you.”\n\nRebuilds are hard on veterans, especially veterans like Korver and Thompson, Kevin Love and Channing Frye, and JR Smith. Vets who’d gone to consecutive Finals, maybe even four straight, maybe even won one.\n\nKorver, who is 37 and in his 16th season, was acquired via trade from Atlanta. He wasn’t with the Cavs when they won it all the previous June, but he reached two Finals — a destination he’d never made before and probably won’t again.\n\nThe hard part for veterans is coming to work every day and trying to win games, knowing the deck is stacked against them. It’s knowing that scenes like what unfolded Wednesday — Korver being traded just after he arrived at Chesapeake Energy Arena to play against the Thunder — are possible, even probable. Korver was on the court early getting up shots when an assistant pulled him off and told him he’d been traded. Most teammates didn’t even get to say good bye.\n\nWords like “tanking” are thrown in their faces, even though it’s not their personal intent to lose. Practices are just as long. Opponents (usually) play just as hard as they did last season.\n\nMultiple Cavs players are upset with the trading of Korver, insofar as this is a team with very little outside shooting. Korver’s only averaging 6.8 points per game, but he’s still shooting .463 from the outside and is one of the greatest 3-point shooters in NBA history. Subtracting him from the team only makes it harder to win games, they feel.\n\nThen again, they know what this season has become for the Cavs. It’s not about wins.\n\n“At the end of the day it’s a business and anyone can get moved,” Thompson said. “If the trade is right and it adds up, then someone can get moved unless you have a no-trade clause. I don’t know who has that. So the only two guys that are safe in the NBA are Bron and Steph Curry. Everyone else, you can be moved. All you can do is control what you can control. Come in, play hard every day, do your job and don’t get in trouble.”\n\nThompson’s wrong on part of this. There are no players in the NBA this season with explicit no-trade clauses in their contracts.\n\nWhere he’s right, though, is the responsibility of the players in this position to come in and continue to work. That was Korver.\n\nHe was among the elder statesmen in the locker room trying to show rookie Collin Sexton the ropes. Late after Wednesday’s game, as we stood talking to Thompson, Sexton chimed in from across the room: “I respect my boy Kyle. What doesn’t he do right?”\n\nKorver was upset by what happened this summer and then during the first few weeks of this season, but he remained engaged as a teammate and a contributor.\n\nAnd gracious, forever gracious.\n\n“I think just overall I’m really grateful for my time in Cleveland,” Korver said. “So many amazing opportunities. Incredible teammates. Relationships that I’ll take with me for the rest of my life. The fans have really embraced me and my family. I’ve never heard ‘thank you’ so many times from fans, even after harder moments.\n\n“Cleveland fans are who you want to play for.”\n\nThe Cavs want the same thing to be said for their organization. Doing right by Korver is a start.\n\nThe losses are going to mount this season, and it’s going to have a negative impact on the players and on the organization’s image. Altman, the Cavs’ general manager, wants to reset the team’s culture so that winning is not incumbent upon a LeBron to carry everyone else to the top. It’s supposed to be systemic, but that will be made difficult by the poisoning of losing.\n\nPlayers inside and outside the organization will see that the Cavs traded Korver to a place where he can be comfortable. It won’t go unnoticed.\n\nIn Burks, the Cavs traded for a contract that is worth $11.5 million this season and expires at season’s end. Because they traded for him now, in late November, they’d be permitted to stack his contract on top of others in another trade before the league’s Feb. 7 trade deadline. They also have his full “Bird” rights if they decided they wanted to re-sign him as a free agent, so they could go over the salary cap to sign him.\n\nThere are more deals to be made in the coming weeks and months. They’re trying to trade JR Smith. George Hill will probably be traded. And maybe others. The Cavs need to acquire more assets, more draft picks like the two they received from the Jazz, and players whose contracts may be tradeable in a year or two.\n\nThis is the business end of the rebuild. The emotions of realizing the run atop the East is over, not just this season but for the foreseeable future, have come and gone. Now it’s time to make cold, calculated decisions to put the franchise in the best place.\n\nOnly, this one trade, the one involving Korver, had a little warmth to it.\n\nThe last thing Korver ever said as a member of the Cavs, he said after scoring 22 in a loss Monday to Minnesota. He said: “We’re going in the right direction.”\n\n(Photo: Sam Sharpe/ USA Today Sports)"
