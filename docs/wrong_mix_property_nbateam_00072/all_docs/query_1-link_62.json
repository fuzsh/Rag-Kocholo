        "text": "Free agency in the NBA typically involves a lot of meetings between players and powerful people. Monday brought one of those, except this time it was totally unprecedented.\n\nA delegation of five NBA players and three executives from the NBA Players Association met with Pope Francis in a one-hour, private meeting Monday. The meeting was at the invitation of the Vatican in order to discuss the efforts of the players and the league to address social and economic injustices and inequalities in their lives and in their communities.\n\nThe five players were Marco Belinelli, Sterling Brown, Jonathan Isaac, Kyle Korver and Anthony Tolliver. Brown, who agreed to a deal with the Houston Rockets over the weekend, and Korver were both members of the Milwaukee Bucks last season.\n\n“We are extremely honored to have had this opportunity to come to the Vatican and share our experiences with Pope Francis,” Korver said in a news release from the NBPA. “His openness and eagerness to discuss these issues was inspiring and a reminder that our work has had a global impact and must continue moving forward.”\n\nBrown and Korver were vocal in their support of social justice and equality during their time with the Bucks. On Friday, Brown was officially named to the league's new social justice coalition, a board that also includes Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry.\n\nDuring the playoffs in August, the Bucks opted not to play a game against the Orlando Magic in protest of the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha. That decision spurred a larger movement, halting sporting events across the country and drawing recognition from around the globe.\n\nBrown was one of the central figures in that protest. When he learned teammate George Hill already had decided not to play, Brown immediately decided to join him. Soon, the entire Bucks team was on board. After hours inside the locker room talking to high-ranking political figures in Wisconsin as well as the family of Blake, Brown and Hill together delivered the team's statement explaining their decision to sit out the game.\n\nThat wasn't the first time Brown had taken a stand. In January 2018, a group of eight Milwaukee police officers took Brown to the ground, tased and arrested him after a parking violation at a Walgreens. That incident sparked an internal investigation that ended with some officers suspended and others retrained.\n\nBrown, who was not charged, filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Milwaukee Police Department and the city. In early November, the city proposed a $750,000 settlement that also includes an admission that Brown's constitutional rights were violated. If the proposal is approved by Milwaukee elected officials, the settlement would likely become the first time the city admitted wrongdoing in a police misconduct case.\n\nSince that night in January 2018, Brown has been committed to using his platform to enact positive change. A son of a police officer, Brown has often shared his story and was prominent this summer as he led a Bucks-organized protest in Milwaukee following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.\n\n“For these white people and everybody that’s not Black to walk up the street and say Black lives matter — if they really mean it, then something’s gonna come out of this,” Brown said at the Bucks' protest in June.\n\nKorver also has been vocal during his time in Milwaukee. He has spoken about being intensely affected by the Bucks' visit to the Racine Correctional Institution in December, when members of the team talked and played basketball with a collection of incarcerated individuals.\n\nWhen the Bucks decided to sit out their game against Orlando, Korver detailed crying in the locker room as he listened to the stories of his Black teammates. As a white man, he expressed a willingness and a need to hear their stories and listen for direction on how to be an ally against social and racial injustices.\n\n\"What we’re trying to figure out as a team is we don’t want to be aligned politically,\" Korver said in early September regarding inaction in the Wisconsin Legislature. \"Sport has always had the opportunity to be a bridge in life in so many ways and that’s what we’re trying to do as a team. We’re trying to be a bridge, we’re trying to stand in the middle, we’re trying to stand for what’s right, we’re trying to stand for people, but we’re demanding that our leaders be better.\"\n\nWhile Brown has moved on to the next stop in his NBA career, it is unclear what is next for Korver. Based on their free-agent moves, the Bucks don't have space for him on their roster. If the Bucks don't free space, the 39-year-old could opt to continue his NBA career with another team or retire."
