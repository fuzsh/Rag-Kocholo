        "text": "January 16: Korver’s promotion is official, the Hawks announced in a press release.\n\nJanuary 13: The Hawks are finalizing a deal to promote Kyle Korver to an assistant general manager position, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski (via Twitter). Sam Amick of The Athletic first reported that Korver may be in line for that role.\n\nThe move represents a rapid ascension in the front office ranks for Korver, who played in the NBA as recently as 2020 and only joined the Hawks in the summer of 2022 as the team’s director of player affairs and development. The former NBA sharpshooter served as a player development assistant on the Nets’ coaching staff in 2021/22.\n\nIn his role as Atlanta’s director of player affairs and development, Korver was involved in creating and overseeing a development plan for each player on the Hawks’ roster. In his new position as assistant GM, he figures to be more involved in roster and personnel decisions.\n\nKorver’s promotion is part of a larger shake-up that has been occurring in Atlanta’s front office in recent weeks. General manager Landry Fields replaced Travis Schlenk as the club’s head of basketball operations when Schlenk transitioned into an advisory role last month."
