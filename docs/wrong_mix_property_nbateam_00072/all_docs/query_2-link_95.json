        "text": "The Atlanta Hawks today announced that Kyle Korver has been elevated to the position of assistant general manager. Korver joined the Hawks in July 2022 as director of player affairs & development.\n\n“Kyle has brought a great perspective and voice to our group after seamlessly making the transition from playing to coaching to the front office,” said General Manager Landry Fields. “Moving forward, I’m excited to have him even more involved with the day-to-day management and direction of our basketball operations group. Kyle is a special person and teammate whose impact will continue to raise the level of our entire organization. He and his family have made Atlanta their home and we’re thrilled to have them as part of the Hawks family long term.”\n\n“Having played in Atlanta for almost five years, I have a love for the city and the Hawks franchise. I’d like to thank Landry for this opportunity. I am grateful and excited to draw from my experiences playing and working in the NBA over the last 20 years to add to our front office,” Korver said.\n\nKorver, who spent the 2021-22 season as a player development assistant with the Brooklyn Nets, played in 332 regular season games over four-and-a-half seasons (2012-17) with the Hawks, including an All-Star appearance in 2015. He was also the NBA’s Sportsmanship Award recipient in 2014-15.\n\nKorver appeared in 1,232 career regular season games (and 145 playoff contests) in 17 seasons with Philadelphia, Utah, Chicago, Atlanta, Cleveland and Milwaukee. He ranks fifth in NBA history in three-pointers made (2,450) and seventh in career three-point percentage (.429), including the best single-season mark in league history (.536 in 2009-10 with the Jazz). Korver is the only player to ever lead the league in three-point percentage four times.\n\nSelected 51st overall in the 2003 NBA Draft, Korver was the two-time Missouri Valley Conference Player of the Year as a collegian at Creighton. Korver, 41, was born in Paramount, Calif. before his family relocated to Pella, Iowa. He and his wife, Juliet, have three children.\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks have hired Kyle Korver as the organization’s director of player affairs & development.\n\nIn this newly-formed position, Korver will assist in creating and overseeing a development plan for each Hawks player in partnership with the coaches, athletic performance team and front office.\n\n“We are excited to bring Kyle back to the Hawks,” said Hawks General Manager Landry Fields. “He is a tremendous person and someone whose presence will benefit all of our players, both on and off the court, drawing from his unique experiences over his 17-year playing career, as a late-second round pick who later became an All-Star in Atlanta and one of the league’s all-time best shooters.”\n\nKorver, who spent the 2021-22 season as a player development assistant with the Brooklyn Nets, returns to the Hawks, where he played in 332 regular season games over four-and-a-half seasons (2012-17), including an All-Star appearance in 2015. He was also the NBA’s Sportsmanship Award recipient in 2014-15.\n\nKorver appeared in 1,232 career regular season games (and 145 playoff contests) in 17 seasons with Philadelphia, Utah, Chicago, Atlanta, Cleveland and Milwaukee. He ranks fifth in NBA history in three-pointers made (2,450) and seventh in career three-point percentage (.429), including the best single-season mark in league history (.536 in 2009-10 with the Jazz). Korver is the only player to ever lead the league in three-point percentage four times.\n\nSelected 51st overall in the 2003 NBA Draft, Korver was the two-time Missouri Valley Conference Player of the Year as a collegian at Creighton. Korver, 41, was born in Paramount, Calif. before his family relocated to Pella, Iowa.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers have acquired guard Alec Burks and two future second round draft picks from the Utah Jazz in exchange for guard Kyle Korver.\n\nThe two draft picks that Cleveland is receiving in the deal are Utah’s own 2020 second round pick and a 2021 second round pick from the Washington Wizards via the Jazz.\n\n“Kyle’s on-court accomplishments are well known,” said Cavaliers General Manager Koby Altman. “More importantly, though, Kyle is a great person and teammate. He sets an example in everything he does. His work ethic, character and dependability are all at a very special level and something we will always respect and be thankful for. We wish Kyle and his family the best as he continues his career back in Salt Lake City.”\n\n“Alec is a young vet that’s versatile and talented,” said Altman. “We welcome him to Cleveland and we’re looking forward to him getting started with us soon.”\n\nBurks (6-6, 214) has appeared in 17 games for Utah this season, averaging 8.4 points in 15.8 minutes per game. He has scored in double figures on six occasions in 2018-19, including a season-high 22 points in 27 minutes on Nov. 5 versus Toronto. Playing in his ninth NBA season, Burks holds career averages of 9.6 points and 2.9 rebounds in 20.8 minutes per game over 382 career contests (43 starts) with Utah. He also competed in the 2012 and 2018 NBA Playoffs for the Jazz, averaging 8.3 points and 2.7 rebounds in 14.1 minutes per game through 13 contests. The 6-6 guard out of Colorado was originally selected by Utah with the 12th overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft.\n\nCurrently in his 16th NBA season, Korver (6-7, 212, Creighton) has appeared in 1,120 career games (422 starts) with Philadelphia, Utah, Chicago, Atlanta and Cleveland, owning averages of 9.9 points on 44.4 percent from the field and 43.2 percent from three-point range, 3.0 rebounds and 1.8 assists in 26.0 minutes per contest. Named an All-Star during the 2014-15 season, the Pella, Iowa native currently ranks fourth all-time in NBA history for three-point field goals made (2,238). Along with Stephen Curry and Ray Allen, Korver is one of only three players in NBA history to hit over 2000 three-point field goals on better than 40 percent from beyond the arc in their career.\n\nKorver appeared in 180 games during his first stint in Utah (2007-10), totaling 1,570 points, 468 rebounds and 294 assists, 95 steals and 65 blocks, also helping the Jazz to the postseason in each of his seasons as a Jazzman. He ranks second in Jazz history in three-point field goal percentage (.416) and third in free-throw percentage (.879). During the 2009-10 season, he shot 53.6 percent from three, which set an NBA single-season three-point field goal accuracy record.\n\nOriginally selected in the second round (51st overall pick) by the Nets, Korver won the 2014-15 NBA Sportsmanship Award, as voted on by fellow NBA players.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers have re-signed guard Kyle Korver, the team announced Wednesday from Cleveland Clinic Courts.\n\nKorver (6-7, 212) joined the Cavaliers last season after being acquired via trade from the Atlanta Hawks on Jan. 7. In 35 games (one start) with Cleveland, he averaged 10.7 points and 2.8 rebounds in 24.5 minutes per game while shooting .487 from the field, .485 from beyond the arc and .933 from the free throw line.\n\nFor the entire season, he averaged 10.1 points, 2.8 rebounds and 1.6 assists in 26.2 minutes and shot an NBA-best .451 (162-359) from three-point range – his fourth time leading the league in three-point percentage over his career (2009-10, 2013-14, 2014-15). Korver scored in double digits 19 times with the Cavaliers this past season, which includes a 29-point performance at Indiana on Feb. 8. The 14-year veteran knocked down his 2,000th career three-pointer on Feb. 15 against the Pacers, becoming just the seventh player in NBA history to accomplish that feat. Korver also appeared in 18 games during Cleveland’s NBA Finals run, averaging 5.8 points and 1.7 rebounds in 18.1 minutes per game.\n\nKorver has appeared in 1,031 games (418 starts) with the Philadelphia 76ers, Utah Jazz, Chicago Bulls, Hawks and Cavaliers, owning career averages of 10.0 points and 3.1 rebounds in 26.5 minutes per game. He is also averaging 8.3 points and 2.7 rebounds in 24.9 minutes over 109 career postseason contests (38 starts). An NBA All-Star in 2015, Korver is currently tied for fifth in NBA history with 2,049 career made three-pointers and ranks fifth all-time in three-point field goal percentage (.431, minimum 300 3FGM). He has hit 100 threes or more 12 times in his career, including each of the last seven seasons.\n\nHere’s the Atlanta Journal-Constitution blog on Kyle Korver looking to get his name in the record books:\n\nMuch of the talk around Hawks practice this morning revolved around Kyle Korver’s shot at owning the NBA record for consecutive games with a 3-pointer. With a long-range shot against the Cavaliers tonight Korver will own the streak outright at 90. He is currently tied with Dana Barros at 89.\n\nOne new item that came out today came from Al Horford. The Hawks center he has heard players from other teams tell Korver that he wouldn’t get a 3-point shot off against them.\n\n“I’ve heard it,” Horford said. “‘You’re not going to get a 3-point shot off tonight.’ I’ve definitely heard it. It gives credit to what he’s been able to do. That is an impressive streak.”\n\nThe Hawks are planning an in-game moment of recognition should Korver set the record tonight."
