        "text": "After the addition of Tyson Chandler just over a week ago, the Lakers still are eyeing other veteran pieces to add to their roster. This time, the front office is looking at a shooter and a former teammate of LeBron James in Cleveland; Kyle Korver.\n\nAccording to Gery Woelfl of Woelfl’s Press Box, the Lakers are one of a few teams interested in acquiring the 37-year old:\n\nThe Bucks aren’t the only team interested in Korver’s services. Sources said Philadelphia, Oklahoma City and Los Angeles Lakers are also among the Korver suitors.\n\nThe Sixers are an interesting team here because they were also rumored to have interest in Kentavious Caldwell-Pope.\n\nWoelfl also mentioned that the Cavaliers may have a rather high asking price for the sharpshooting forward:\n\nAccording to sources, the Cavs are seeking a first-round pick for Korver, although the prevailing feeling among several NBA officials is that no team will likely agree to the Cavs’ asking price.\n\nA first-round pick is an incredibly high asking price for someone of that age, but Korver would certainly be a welcomed addition to the Lakers second unit due to his ability to spread the floor and play off-ball.\n\nMany of the Lakers contracts that would be used to facilitate a Korver trade are not able to be moved until December 15th so the team will likely have to wait until then to strike a deal. They also don’t currently have an open roster spot available so they would have to open one by sending a player out or waiving them.\n\nOn the season, Korver is averaging just 5.5 points while shooting 38 percent from deep. For his career, Korver is a 43 percent three-point marksman."
