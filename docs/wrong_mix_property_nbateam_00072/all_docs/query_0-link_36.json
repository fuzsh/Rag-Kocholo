He played for six organizations, including the Hawks from 2012-17. He made the All-Star team in an Atlanta uniform in 2015.\n\nHe’ll work under president of basketball operations and general manager Travis Schlenk.\n\nThe 51st overall pick in the 2003 draft, Korver appeared in a total of 1,232 regular season games for the Philadelphia 76ers, Utah Jazz, Chicago Bulls, Hawks, Cleveland Cavaliers and Milwaukee Bucks. He averaged 9.7 PPG and 3.0 RPG in 25.3 minutes per game and was one of the top long-distance shooters of his era, knocking down 42.9 percent of his three-pointers during his career."
