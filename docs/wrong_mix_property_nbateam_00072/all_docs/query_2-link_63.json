        "text": "Harden entered Thursday 413 3-pointers behind Ray Allen for the second most in NBA history and 552 behind all-time leader Stephen Curry, who passed Allen earlier this season. “[Third] all time in NBA history, that’s definitely a huge accomplishment,” Harden said recently. “I think No. 1 is definitely going to be hard to catch. You’ve got the best shooter that ever touched a basketball in Steph. But that realm from Reggie to Ray to Kyle Korver [in fifth place], I mean, those are some unbelievable shooters that we all witnessed shoot the basketball at a high level. “So I’m blessed, I’m fortunate to be on that list, high on top of the list. And I’ll do whatever it takes to try to catch Steph. [It’s] going to be difficult, man.”\n\nStoryline: Statistical Milestones"
