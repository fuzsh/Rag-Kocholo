        "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY -- It's rare when a trade works out for everyone involved. But that's the case when it comes to the Cleveland Cavaliers' decision to deal Kyle Korver to the Utah Jazz for Alec Burks and a pair of future second-round picks.\n\nThe Cavaliers entered this season with a long list of goals. At the top was their desire to win. Whether that was realistic or not, they were hoping to overachieve, believing Kevin Love and some of their young core pieces would be able to fight for one of the final playoff spots in the top-heavy Eastern Conference.\n\nThat's why they kept Korver, who wanted to be sent away this summer -- and felt there was an agreement in place if LeBron James left -- in hopes of avoiding this family move during the season.\n\nThe Cavs believed there was importance in having Korver around, when the franchise was attempting to protect its culture and teaching the newbies the Cavaliers way.\n\nJudging by comments from the locker room Wednesday night, those few months were significant.\n\n\"I respect my boy Kyle,\" rookie Collin Sexton said. \"What doesn't he do right?\"\n\nTristan Thompson, one of the leaders and holdovers from the previous era, echoed those sentiments.\n\n\"His positive, professional approach,\" Thompson said. \"He's 17 years in and always a pro. I was very fortunate my first year to be under Antawn Jamison and he kept it as a pro too. I think that's what I appreciate from Kyle. More veterans need to start acting like that. I think that's how you pass it down to the young fellas so when they get old they will treat the next rookie right. You need those guys in the locker room.\n\n\"The good vets like Channing (Frye), Kyle, RJ (Richard Jefferson), these guys can teach young guys like Collin and Cedi (Osman) how to be pros. That holds value and I think that's taken for granted.\"\n\nAlong with a desire to win, the Cavs wanted to develop their youngsters. Those two goals, of course, were always going to come to a head, especially when factoring in another priority: accumulating assets.\n\nBecause the Cavs entered this season with limited assets that most rebuilding teams need -- draft picks, young players on team-friendly deals, expiring contracts and cap space -- they knew there was a possibility of trading Korver. JR Smith and George Hill could be next.\n\nThe veteran purge began Wednesday night with Korver. And it was quite a haul.\n\nThe only player coming back to Cleveland is Alec Burks. A 27-year-old former first-round pick, Burks brings value on the floor, giving the Cavs an extra ball-handler and scorer off the bench.\n\nFor three straight seasons in Utah, starting with his breakout 2013-14 run, Burks averaged double figures in scoring, his lowest being 13.3 points. In large part because of injuries and fewer opportunities, he's fizzled since and the Jazz were done with him -- similar to the decision they made with Rodney Hood last February.\n\nThis season, in limited action, Burks is averaging 8.4 points and 41.2 percent from the field to go with 37.2 percent from beyond the arc.\n\n\"That's my guy, really close with A.B.,\" Hood told cleveland.com. \"Good player. Sidelined by some injuries throughout his career, but really can score the ball. He's a good that can defend and I think he will get more of an opportunity to show what he can do. I know he's excited. My wife is friends with his fiancee, really good friends of the family and it will be good reuniting with him.\"\n\nHood's right. Burks will get a fresh start here, going from a team where playing time was sparse as they chased a playoff spot in the Western Conference to a group that understands the reality of their situation.\n\nA horrible, injury-plagued start wrecked any playoff dreams and Burks will get as much playing time as he can handle while the Cavs get to see him in their system, alongside their nucleus. It's an up-close look at a player who could possibly become part of the future. They also have his full \"Bird\" rights if they wanted to re-sign him as a free agent, able to go over the salary cap to keep him.\n\nThen again, Burks brings even more value as an expiring contract. Set to make $11.5 million, the Cavs added a compelling trade chip at a time when teams are looking to shed bulky salaries to either get below the luxury tax threshold or start clearing space to chase free agents in the talented 2019 class.\n\nThis positions the Cavs to take on some long-term salary and recoup additional draft picks as sweeteners for taking that bad contract, something they are willing to do.\n\nBecause the Cavs traded for Burks before Dec. 6, they are allowed to swap him immediately or can aggregate his salary with others in about two months -- creating an opportunity for a bigger trade package.\n\nAlong with Burks, the Cavs got two valuable second-round picks -- Utah's pick in 2020 and Washington's in 2021.\n\nBy then, who knows where Washington will be? That's the same year when Bradley Beal -- if he's not traded before then -- hits free agency. A year prior, the team will have to make a decision about Otto Porter Jr. Given their murky salary cap situation in the next few seasons, the Wizards may look at blowing up their roster and starting over, possibly pushing that second into the top half of the round.\n\nMaybe the Cavs use those picks for themselves. Or perhaps they become trade chips if the right player becomes available. Every asset helps.\n\nNot to be lost in the mix is Cleveland being off the hook for $3.4 million in partially guaranteed money owed to Korver.\n\nThe terms \"shocked\" and \"thrilled\" were both used to cleveland.com when a team source discussed the package they received for the 37-year-old sniper.\n\nFrom their standpoint, they received a talented player who is 10 years younger while also getting off some money for next year and receiving two second-round picks that essentially end up replacing the ones that will likely be heading to the Hawks as payment for Korver.\n\nIf the Cavs end up dealing Burks before the deadline, which seems probable, then they will get more for Korver than what they gave up.\n\nThe front office also did right by Korver, turning what could have been a horrendous misstep into a positive outcome. It didn't go unnoticed.\n\n\"I feel both understand it's best to let him go,\" Thompson said. \"I think it's because he earned that respect from the franchise. When you come in every day and do the right things as a pro, work your butt off and you don't do nothing to jeopardize the organization they are going to look out for you.\n\n\"You don't control who pays you and where you get traded to. That is somebody else. If you piss that guy off they are going to f--- you over. I think (Kyle) did everything the right way where it's only right that they sent him somewhere that's a positive. That's how business works. Treat people how you want to be treated.\"\n\nKorver was a hot name on the trade market. Plenty of teams had been eyeing his situation in Cleveland.\n\nAccording to sources, the Cavs talked with the 76ers in the summer, but the conversations never really advanced. There were rumors about the Cavs taking a look at 2017 No. 1 pick Markelle Fultz as a possible reclamation project, but a source said the Cavs didn't feel that was nearly enough in return. His broken jumper and shoulder issue make it tough to gauge his value.\n\nKorver wanted to go to a contender. In conversations with cleveland.com over the last month, he brought up Boston, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. While the Jazz entered the night three games under .500, they were fifth in the West last season and have the talent to turn around a sluggish start.\n\nKorver wanted to go where he would get playing time, where the team would value his skill set. The Jazz rank 29th in 3-point percentage and 23rd in made triples. His away-from-the-ball movement and floor spacing will fit well in Utah and Korver likes that style.\n\nMore than anything, he wanted a place where his family would be comfortable.\n\n\"He was excited,\" a source told cleveland.com of Korver's reaction to the deal. \"Really appreciative of the how the Cavs handled the trade.\"\n\nKorver played three seasons with the Jazz. He met his wife, Juliet, in Utah. If he's going to be forced to uproot his family in the middle of the season, an incredible challenge for any player, it's best he ends up in a city in which he is familiar and can be happy. The Cavs did right by him.\n\nSo now the follow-up question: Who is next?\n\n\"At the end of the day it's a business and anyone can get moved,\" Thompson said. \"If the trade is right and it adds up then someone can get moved unless you have a no-trade clause. So the only two guys that are safe in the NBA are Bron and Steph Curry. Everyone else, you can be moved. All you can do is control what you can control. Come in, play hard every day, do your job and don't get in trouble.\""
