        "text": "Kyle Korver returns to Atlanta. The former player has closed an agreement with the Georgia franchise to join their office; reports Shams Charania of The Athletic.\n\nAfter a long career as a player of up to 17 seasons, Korver begins a new path in an organization that he knows really well, since he was a player for Atlanta between 2012 and 2016. It was precisely in the 2014-15 campaign when he was part of the best Hawks of history in regular season concluding with a balance of 60-22. Such collective performance, added to his individual performance, allowed him to be designated as an All-Star.\n\nWith this movement, Korver ends his time in Brooklyn, where in February 2021 he signed a contract to serve as player development assistant; decision that on the other hand was something like an unofficial announcement of his retirement as a basketball player.\n\nAt 41 years old, Korver now arrives at a franchise that wants to take an important step forward. In 2021 they reached the Eastern Conference finals, true, but in 2022 they were far from expectations. The Hawks want more and have shown it in the market with the landing of Dejounte Murray. It remains to be seen if all the pieces of the puzzle fit together as desired.\n\n(Photo by Mike Lawrie/Getty Images)"
