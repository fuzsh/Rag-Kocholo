        "text": "The Atlanta Hawks hired former All-Star Kyle Korver to the front office as their new director of player affairs and development.\n\nThe role is a newly-created position within the Hawks organization, in which Korver will help devise development plans for the team's players.\n\n\"We are excited to bring Kyle back to the Hawks,\" general manager Landry Fields said in a statement.\n\n\"He is a tremendous person and someone whose presence will benefit all of our players, both on and off the court, drawing from his unique experiences over his 17-year playing career as a late second-round pick who later became an All-Star in Atlanta and one of the league's all-time best shooters.\"\n\nKorver spent last season with the Brooklyn Nets as a development coach.\n\nThe sharpshooter played five seasons in Atlanta from 2012-17. He made the All-Star team in 2015. Korver ranks fifth all time in 3-point field goals made and 10th all time in 3-point field-goal percentage."
