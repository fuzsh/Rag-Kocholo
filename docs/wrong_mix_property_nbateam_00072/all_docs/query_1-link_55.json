        "text": "INDEPENDENCE, Ohio -- If you're looking for changes on the Cavaliers after their latest debacle Saturday, too bad.\n\nThere aren't any.\n\nCoach Tyronn Lue said he would not change the starting lineup or his player rotation after practice Sunday, a day after the team was blown out by the Oklahoma City Thunder, 148-124.\n\nThe front office was not expected to fire Lue, and Lue wouldn't make changes to his coaching staff, but those changes were discussed by reporters and players in the immediate aftermath of Saturday's disaster.\n\nThe Cavs have won just three times in 12 games since Christmas, and are the NBA's worst defensive team and 23rd-ranked offense during that stretch. They play the Spurs in San Antonio on Tuesday.\n\n\"I just didn't want to,\" Lue said. \"Looking at film and what we're trying to do, it's not the best thing right now.\"\n\nLue is loathe to make any lineup changes while the team is losing so that any one player doesn't become the scapegoat. Fans must consider Lue's thinking when taking in what he said when asked to defend his decision to stay the course.\n\n\"It's the same group we won 18 out of 19 with also,\" Lue said. \"We've just got to play better. We've got to play better, we've got to be sharper and that's what we continue to keep working on. It's the same team that won 18 out of 19 and 13 in a row.\"\n\nThis of course is, at some level, entirely incorrect. The Cavs won all those games in November and December with Isaiah Thomas, Tristan Thompson, and Derrick Rose in street clothes.\n\nIman Shumpert ran the point at the start of the winning streak and then Jose Calderon took over. Channing Frye, a fan favorite, was getting minutes off the bench and rookie Cedi Osman saw court time, too.\n\nKyle Korver is playing less, getting fewer looks, and isn't spending as much time in the lineup with LeBron James now. Kevin Love's shot attempts have gone down, too.\n\nBut there are two obvious targets within the starting lineup -- J.R. Smith and Jae Crowder -- who were in those roles when this team was winning.\n\n\"Ty is trying to...he's got a tough job,\" said Korver, who's averaging just 6.3 points and shooting .393 from 3-point range over the last 12 games. \"He's trying to find lineups that are working and he's trying to find minutes for everybody. I think he's doing a great job in that regard, as far as getting everybody in the game. Maybe not Channing, we'd like to get Channing out there a little more but it's a numbers thing right now. It's tough. Cedi, we'd like to see Cedi out there more, too. It's tough.\n\n\"There's a numbers thing right now,\" Korver continued. \"Definitely I've been a part of that too. It's a long season. We're riding a bad wave right now, but hopefully find some things that will start working again, guys will get healthier. Guys are getting healthier but we need to get back in sync. There's no answers right now. Just trying to figure it out.\"\n\nThomas and Dwyane Wade both mentioned player accountability on Saturday, with Thomas going so far as to say \"I think we need to hold everybody accountable a little more and I think that's the biggest think right now, if guys ain't doing the right job they need to come out the game.\"\n\nThomas' quote was mentioned to Lue on Sunday and he responded: \"That's why they're players and I'm the coach.\"\n\nKorver said the Cavs are a veteran team (not just that, they're the league's oldest team and one with players who've gone to anywhere from one to seven consecutive Finals), and accountability should come from players looking in the mirror.\n\n\"We're all grownups,\" Korver said. \"When you're a mature grown up you just look yourself in the mirror.\"\n\nKeep in mind that Korver has lost shots and minutes. He explained the danger if Lue were to make changes.\n\n\"You've seen that go bad too, when coaching start jerking guys in and out of the lineup and it's a blame game,\" Korver said. \"If you're the person that got jerked out of the lineup you feel like it's your fault. If you change the lineup and it works that's one thing. Change the lineup and it doesn't work that's another thing so no one thinks about the lineups more than Ty does and it's a tough job.\""
