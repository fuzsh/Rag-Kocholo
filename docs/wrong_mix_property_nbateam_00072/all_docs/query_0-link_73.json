        "text": "Kyle Korver likely will miss the Cleveland Cavaliers' Wednesday game against the Toronto Raptors following the death of his brother.\n\nKirk Korver died Tuesday in Iowa at age 27 after becoming seriously ill last week, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer.\n\nKyle Korver, 37, wasn't with the Cavaliers for their Saturday road victory against the Chicago Bulls, but he came back to participate Monday in a home win over the Milwaukee Bucks, scoring 12 points.\n\nThe Cavaliers tweeted Tuesday night, \"We are very sad to share that Cavaliers guard Kyle Korver's brother, Kirk, passed away today. Kyle has been excused from the team to be with his family. We extend our deepest condolences and heartfelt best to Kyle and his entire family as they go through this very difficult time.\"\n\nKirk Korver played three seasons as a forward for the University of Missouri-Kansas City from 2009-14, scoring 597 points and 267 rebounds.\n\nThe UMKC athletic department tweeted, \"It is with great sadness that UMKC shares the passing of one of its student-athletes, Kirk Korver. A 2014 graduate, Kirk was an exemplary student-athlete. He defined kindness & hard work. Our hearts & prayers go out to the Korver family. He will be missed & forever loved.\"\n\nTwo other Korver brothers also played college basketball, Kaleb at Creighton (where Kyle starred) and Klayton at Drake.\n\n--Field Level Media"
