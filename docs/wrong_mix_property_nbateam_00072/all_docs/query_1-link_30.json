        "text": "While every NBA transaction has an impact on the court, there are often other major effects due to the rules of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. For The Athletic, CBA and salary cap expert Danny Leroux breaks down Wednesday’s Kyle Korver trade from each team’s perspective for both the near and long-term.\n\nThe Trade\n\nAs first reported by ESPN, and confirmed by Tony Jones and Joe Vardon of The Athletic: Cavaliers send Kyle Korver to the Utah Jazz in exchange for Alec Burks and two second-round picks.\n\nWhere the trade leaves the Utah Jazz\n\nThe Jazz have a truly fascinating salary structure moving forward, with only Rudy Gobert and Joe Ingles making more than $10 million in any future season. Utah is looking at the possibility of max cap space in July, but that would come at a significant cost: renouncing most of their pending free agents, including Derrick Favors’ non-guaranteed contract and fellow starter Ricky Rubio.\n\nAnother possible outcome would be a mixed approach of keeping some of their own free agents while using modest cap space though GM Dennis Lindsey could also choose to stay over the cap to use the larger Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception. All of those options are still on the table but their relative merits change with this trade.\n\nSwapping Alec Burks’ expiring contract for Kyle Korver changes Utah’s cap math in a small but compelling way because now the front office has the choice of either keeping Korver at a price of $7.5 million or paying him $3.44 million to play elsewhere. Either of those options is an obligation they did not have with Burks and may be a hint that Lindsey is not prioritizing maximizing 2019 cap space.\n\nIt is certainly possible for Utah to clear plenty of space or even to trade Korver between now and then to offload that obligation, but they could have acquired someone without a 2019-20 payment or even waited for a potential Cleveland buy-out to avoid that commitment.\n\nWhile it is far too early to say this is a definitive sign of which way Utah will go next July, especially since they can still clear a ton of space by making the aforementioned tough choices, it does look like an early indicator of how their front office is thinking about cap flexibility next summer. Also, since Burks makes more than Korver, they will save about $3 million this season and create a trade exception worth about $4 million.\n\nWhere the trade leaves the Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nWhile there are cogent rationales for this deal in terms of the talent on the floor and draft picks, this transaction also raises some interesting questions about how GM Koby Altman wants to approach the 2019 offseason, particularly in ways that affect what they do before the February trade deadline.\n\nIt may appear at first glance that shedding Korver’s partial guarantee for the 2019-20 season in a deal for a fully expiring contract makes it more likely that Cleveland is in space-clearing mode for next summer, but that may not be true and the timing here tells a more compelling story.\n\nWhile the Cavs are allowed to trade JR Smith next summer for a player making substantially more than his $3.9 million partial guarantee thanks to an unusual situation, both Korver and George Hill signed their deals under the current CBA so trading them for someone with a significant 2019-20 salary needed to happen this season if they wanted to go down that road. Due to existing obligations to Kevin Love, Larry Nance, Tristan Thompson and Jordan Clarkson, Cleveland’s salary structure should lead them to function as an over the cap team next summer without larger moves.\n\nThat may raise the question of why Altman just traded Korver for Burks’ expiring deal, but for many teams Burks would be a more desirable target in a long-term salary dump than Korver due to that partial guarantee. This is because many franchises have complicated calculations where $3.4 million could make a big difference, making purely expiring contracts more desirable.\n\nThe CBA has a limitation on aggregating players who have been recently acquired unless they did so using cap space, which is not the case here. Aggregation is basically combining a player’s salary with others in order to take on a larger salary than they could with any of them individually. Due to that limitation, Burks cannot be immediately traded along with any other Cavs to take on a big money deal.\n\nHowever, the CBA only prevents teams from aggregating recently-acquired players for two months and the trade deadline is February 7, 2019, just over two months from now. That means Altman can make a bigger move combining Burks with Hill, Smith or someone else to take on multi-season salary at the deadline, presumably for a meaningful asset return.\n\nThere is no guarantee that such a move will take place at the deadline but the timing of this trade keeps that door open.\n\n(Top photo: Melissa Majchrzak/NBAE via Getty Images)"
