Kyle Korver is finalizing a deal on Tuesday to join the Hawks in a front office role.

Korver played for the Hawks from 2012-2017, which included his lone All-Star appearance during the 2014-2015 season. That was the season the Hawks won 60 games, and their starting five was named the Player of the Month in January of 2015. He’ll move from a player development role with the Nets to the front office in Atlanta.

Kyle Korver said he’s still deciding on whether or not to continue his NBA career.

“I’m not sure. I’ve talked to a few teams about it,” Korver said of a potential return. “Coming out of the bubble, I believe in honoring the game. I believe you honor the season with a good offseason. Coming out of the bubble with the quick turnaround, I didn’t feel I really did that. So I don’t want to cheat the game.” If he does latch onto a contender it sounds like he’ll need to some time to ramp up his conditioning but it would be nice to see one of the best sharpshooters of the last decade back in the NBA. Last season with the Bucks, Korver hit 41.8% from beyond the arc.

Kyle Korver said he will talk with his family before making a decision about his future.

The 39-year-old sharpshooter is now a free agent but it’s possible he follows in Marvin Williams’ footsteps and calls it a career. He has shown that he still has some gas left in the tank though, hitting 41.8% of his 3-pointers this season.

Kyle Korver hit 5-of-6 shots, which were all 3-pointers, and 4-of-4 free throws on his way to a team-high 19 points with four rebounds, two assists and a steal in Monday’s loss to the Raptors.

Giannis Antetokounmpo sat this one out and Korver came through with a big game. He took a shot below his left eye from Paul Watson’s elbow and is going to have a nice shiner, but he was able to stay in the game and play through it. He should be OK going forward.

Kyle Korver will start tonight as Allen Iverson sits with an elbow injury.

Korver has been one of the hottest fantasy pickups lately and the news for his new owners just keeps getting better. Iverson should return for Wendesday’s game against Boston, which will likely send Korver back to the bench.

Could Kyle Korver be the NBA’s most valuable player? Perhaps, if you believe in a statistic known as the “Roland Ratings.”

The ratings measure team net points-per-48-minutes when a player is on the floor, versus net points-per-48-minutes when that same player is off the floor. The formula shows that the Sixers outscored an opponent by 10.6 points over 48 minutes with Korver on the floor, and were outscored by 20.4 points over 48 minutes with Korver on the bench. That’s a +31 rating for Korver. Following him are Andrei Kirilenko, Kobe Bryant, Tayshaun Prince, and LeBron James.

Coach Jim O’Brien informed us that we “can read that I have felt that our best lineup of the year is the lineup at the wing spots that I’m starting now.”

That means Kyle Korver at small forward, and Andre Iguodala at shooting guard. If we can trust O’Brien here, the Philadelphia lineup could be coming close to order. Allen Iverson is the point guard, Kenny Thomas is at power forward backed up by Corliss Williamson. The only major question that would remain is who wins out at center between Samuel Dalembert (last night’s starter) or Marc Jackson.
