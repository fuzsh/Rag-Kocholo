        "text": "Series of Doctor Who-based novels (1997–2005)\n\nFor the related book series, see Eighth Doctor Adventures.\n\nThe Past Doctor Adventures (sometimes known by the abbreviation PDA or PDAs) were a series of spin-off novels based on the long running BBC science fiction television series Doctor Who and published under the BBC Books imprint. For most of their existence, they were published side-by-side with the Eighth Doctor Adventures. The novels regularly featured the First through Seventh Doctors. The Infinity Doctors had an ambiguous place in continuity and featured an unidentified incarnation of the Doctor. The Eighth Doctor co-starred with the Fourth Doctor in one novel (Wolfsbane) and, after the Eighth Doctor Adventures had ceased publication, a novel (Fear Itself) featuring the Eighth Doctor and set between two earlier Eighth Doctor Adventures (EarthWorld and Vanishing Point) was published within the Past Doctor series.\n\nBetween 1991 and 1997, Virgin Publishing produced successful spin-off novels under the New Adventures and Missing Adventures ranges. However, following the Doctor Who television movie in 1996, the BBC did not renew Virgin Publishing's license to continue publishing Doctor Who material. Instead, they opted to publish their own range beginning in 1997 with The Devil Goblins from Neptune by Martin Day and Keith Topping. The range continued to be published through to 2005.\n\nVirgin had distinguished the New and Missing Adventures with different cover designs. BBC Books, however, did not differentiate their novels featuring the current and past Doctors in this way, although they were listed separately within the books. Fans, however, continued to distinguish the ongoing story of the Eighth Doctor from the more stand-alone adventures of past Doctors.\n\nDespite moving to the BBC, the writers (many of whom wrote for the Virgin series) have broadly attempted to maintain continuity with the New and Missing Adventures and many elements from these series have appeared in the Past Doctor Adventures (which replaced the Missing Adventures). Indeed, one of the novels — Millennium Shock by Justin Richards — was a direct sequel to System Shock, a Missing Adventure published by Virgin. Another notable release was Scream of the Shalka, a novelisation of the webcast of the same title and the only release in the Past Doctor range that did not feature an \"official\" incarnation of the Doctor. The Infinity Doctors, written by Lance Parkin, featured an unidentified Doctor.\n\nIn addition to the Past Doctor Adventures and the Eighth Doctor Adventures, the BBC also published three short story collections under the title of Short Trips, which feature all eight (at the time of publication) Doctors. These were also inherited from Virgin, a version of their Decalog short story collections, and when the BBC ceased publishing them, a licence to continue was sought by Big Finish Productions, who continued to publish their own range of Short Trips collections until 2009.\n\nThe range has ceased publication. In the spring of 2005, BBC Books began publishing a series of hardcover books, the New Series Adventures. The BBC Past Doctor paperback series continued for the remainder of 2005, but no titles were announced after Andrew Cartmel's Atom Bomb Blues, which was released in November 2005. In a talk in July 2006, commissioning editor Justin Richards said that BBC Books have plans for the future of the Past Doctor Adventures, but that decisions had not yet been taken.\n\nBeginning in 2012, hardback books featuring past Doctors are being published, though at a much reduced rate compared with the pre-2005 output. The books are longer, in a larger format, and written by (or in once case, adapted from earlier work by) prominent science fiction authors. As of the mid-2014, the titles published are Shada by Gareth Roberts (a novelisation of the unbroadcast television story by Douglas Adams), The Wheel of Ice by Stephen Baxter and Harvest of Time by Alastair Reynolds.\n\nIncluding books featuring two of the Doctors, the numbers of books each appears in are as follows:\n\nFirst Doctor, 8 books\n\nSecond Doctor, 12 books\n\nThird Doctor, 12 books\n\nFourth Doctor, 13 books\n\nFifth Doctor, 10 books\n\nSixth Doctor, 11 books\n\nSeventh Doctor, 13 books\n\nEighth Doctor, 2 books\n\n# Title Author(s) Doctor Featuring Published Notes 1 The Devil Goblins from Neptune Martin Day and Keith Topping 3rd Liz Shaw, UNIT June 1997 2 The Murder Game Steve Lyons 2nd Ben and Polly July 1997 3 The Ultimate Treasure Christopher Bulis 5th Peri August 1997 4 Business Unusual Gary Russell 6th Mel and The Brigadier September 1997 5 Illegal Alien Mike Tucker and Robert Perry 7th Ace October 1997 6 The Roundheads Mark Gatiss 2nd Ben, Polly and Jamie November 1997 7 The Face of the Enemy David A.

According to E.G. Wolverson of Doctor Who Reviews, many critiqued the portrayal of the Doctor's childhood on Gallifrey in the extended flashback. They state that they and Chadd Knueppe of Outpost Gallifrey are the only ones who enjoyed it.[3] 27 Corpse Marker Chris Boucher 4th Leela November 1999 28 Last of the Gaderene Mark Gatiss 3rd Jo and UNIT January 2000 29 Tomb of Valdemar Simon Messingham 4th Romana I and K-9 February 2000 30 Verdigris Paul Magrs 3rd Jo 3 April 2000 31 Grave Matter Justin Richards 6th Peri May 2000 32 Heart of TARDIS Dave Stone 2nd and 4th Jamie, Victoria and Romana I June 2000 33 Prime Time Mike Tucker 7th Ace July 2000 34 Imperial Moon Christopher Bulis 5th Turlough and Kamelion August 2000 35 Festival of Death Jonathan Morris 4th Romana II and K-9 September 2000 36 Independence Day Peter Darvill-Evans 2nd and 7th Jamie and Ace October 2000 37 The King of Terror Keith Topping 5th Tegan, Turlough and The Brigadier November 2000 38 The Quantum Archangel Craig Hinton 6th Mel January 2001 39 Bunker Soldiers Martin Day 1st Steven and Dodo February 2001 40 Rags Mick Lewis 3rd Jo and UNIT March 2001 41 The Shadow in the Glass Justin Richards and Stephen Cole 6th The Brigadier 2 April 2001 42 Asylum Peter Darvill-Evans 4th Nyssa May 2001 43 Superior Beings Nick Walters 5th Peri June 2001 44 Byzantium!

A secret seance is planned. Concurrently, The Doctor and Nyssa are dealing with the death of their good friend, Adric. They are surprised when they are seemingly visited by the ghost of their dead friend. Everything, plus the secrets of a guarded, drowned village come together.[7] 66 The Eleventh Tiger David A.

Also, Harry is the only person to interact with both Doctors (although the Fourth Doctor and Sarah learn of the Eighth's presence, neither of them appear to realise that he is the Doctor) to be fully aware of the Doctor's nature as an alien time traveller, and the Eighth's current state of amnesia — in the aftermath of The Ancestor Cell — prevents either the Eighth Doctor or Harry from recognising each other.\n\nDrift book cover\n\nList of Doctor Who novelists\n\nPast Doctor Adventures on Tardis Wiki, the Doctor Who Wiki\n\nThe TARDIS Library's listing of BBC Past Doctor books"
