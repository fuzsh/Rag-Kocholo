        "text": "One dose of Xanax reaches its therapeutic peak in about 2 hours and may stay in your body for 1 day or so. The drug can still be detected in the blood and urine for much longer. Your metabolism, dosage, body weight, and overall health may be factors.\n\nThis drug has boxed warnings. These are the most serious warnings from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Boxed warnings alert doctors and patients about drug effects that may be dangerous.\n\nTaking benzodiazepines with opioid drugs increases your risk for severe sleepiness, respiratory depression, coma, and even death. Aplrazolam shouldn’t be taken with an opioid unless there are no other available treatment options.\n\nUsing benzodiazepines, even as prescribed, can lead to physical dependence and withdrawal if you stop taking the drug suddenly. Withdrawal can be life threatening.\n\nTaking this drug can also lead to misuse and addiction. Misuse of Alprazolam increases your risk of overdose and death.\n\nOnly take this drug as your doctor prescribes. Talk with your healthcare provider if you have any concerns about safely taking this drug.\n\nAlprazolam (Xanax) is a medication that belongs to the drug class doctors call “benzodiazepines.” People take it to relieve symptoms of anxiety and panic disorders.\n\nThe average person eliminates half a Xanax dose from their system in about 11.2 hours, according to the Xanax prescribing information. It can take days before your body fully eliminates Xanax from your system.\n\nKeep reading to find out how long Xanax stays in your body — and how long different testing methods may detect it.\n\nDifferent benzodiazepines work for various amounts of time. For example, midazolam (Nayzilam) is a short-acting benzodiazepine while clonazepam (Klonopin) is a longer-acting one. Xanax is somewhere in the middle.\n\nWhen you take Xanax, your body absorbs it, and a large part of it binds to circulating proteins. In about 1 to 2 hours, Xanax reaches its peak (maximum) concentration in your body. While doctors don’t know exactly how it works, they do know it depresses the central nervous system to help relieve anxiety.\n\nAfter that, your body starts breaking it down, and its effects start to lessen.\n\nJust because Xanax stays in your system, doesn’t mean that you feel its effects as long. You’ll usually start to feel less anxious within 1 to 2 hours of taking it. If you take it regularly, you may be able to maintain the concentrations of Xanax in your blood so you don’t feel like it’s worn off.\n\nPharmaceutical manufacturers also make extended-release versions of Xanax. These are made to last longer in your system so you don’t have to take as much each day. These formulations could last longer in your system.\n\nDoctors can test for the presence of Xanax in a variety of ways. The method may determine how long a test can detect Xanax. These include:\n\nBlood. It can vary how long laboratories can detect Xanax in your blood. Most people have about half the dose of Xanax in their blood within a day. However, it can take several days longer for the body to completely eliminate Xanax, according to the Xanax prescribing information. Even if you don’t feel the anxiety-relieving effects anymore, a laboratory may be able to detect Xanax in the blood for up to 4 to 5 days.\n\nHair. Laboratories can detect Xanax in head hair for up to 3 months, according to the United States Drug Testing Laboratories. Because body hair doesn’t usually grow as quickly, a laboratory may test a positive result for up to 12 months after taking Xanax.\n\nSaliva. A 2015 study of 25 people using saliva samples found the maximum time Xanax stayed detectable in a person’s oral fluid was 2 1/2 days.\n\nUrine. Not all drug tests can identify benzodiazepines or Xanax specifically, according to an article in the Journal Laboratory Medicine. However, some urine drug screens can detect Xanax for up to 5 days.\n\nThese timeframes can vary based on how quickly your body breaks down Xanax and the sensitivity of the laboratory test.\n\nDoctors don’t conduct a lot of studies on pregnant women and medications because they don’t want to hurt their babies. This means a lot of medical knowledge comes from reports of or studies that indicate possible problems.\n\nDoctors assume that Xanax does cross the placenta and therefore can affect a baby. Most doctors will recommend stopping taking Xanax at least for the first trimester to try and reduce birth defects.\n\nIf you take Xanax while pregnant, it’s possible your baby could be born with Xanax in its system. It’s really important you have an honest discussion with your doctor if you’re pregnant about how much Xanax you take and how it can affect your baby.\n\nYes, Xanax can pass through breast milk. An older study from 1995 studied the presence of Xanax in breast milk, and found the average half-life of Xanax in breast milk was about 14.5 hours, according to the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology.\n\nBreastfeeding while taking Xanax could cause a baby to be more sedated, affecting their breathing. Xanax also can reduce the risks for seizures, so when a baby withdraws from Xanax, they could have a seizure.\n\nMost doctors won’t recommend taking Xanax while breastfeeding unless absolutely necessary. They can usually prescribe medicines that are shorter acting or have a different action in the body, so they’re less likely to affect a baby.\n\nSeveral factors affect how long Xanax stays in your system. Some make it stay in your system longer while others mean it stays in for less time.\n\nXanax lasts longer in these circumstances:\n\nAlcoholic liver disease. Because the liver helps break down Xanax, a person whose liver doesn’t work as well will take longer to break it down. The average half-life for Xanax in this population is 19.7 hours, according to the Xanax prescribing information.\n\nElderly. Older people usually take longer to break down Xanax. The average half-life in an elderly person is about 16.3 hours, according to the Xanax prescribing information.\n\nObesity. The half-life of Xanax in a person with obesity is 21.8 hours on average — that’s 10 hours more than in a person who is “average sized,” according to the Xanax prescribing information.\n\nXanax may last a shorter amount of time if a person takes certain medications that speed up the elimination of medicines. Doctors call these medicines “inducers.” They include:\n\ncarbamazepine\n\nfosphenytoin\n\nphenytoin\n\ntopiramate (Topamax)\n\nDoctors prescribe these medicines to reduce seizure activity.\n\nOther examples that can speed up the elimination of medicines include St. John’s wort, which is a supplement used to improve moods, and rifampin (Rifadin), which is used for infections."
