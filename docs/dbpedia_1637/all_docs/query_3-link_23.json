        "text": "Great Doctor and Martha Adventure!\n\nThis is an excellent adventure! The story is well written. I can picture it's world, characters, and creatures. Martha and the Doctor are in character. This could have very well been an episode. While I'm not fond of the 'romance' aspect of their early (Season 3) relationship, it refers to it an casual, tasteful way near the end.\n\nThere's a lot of running and action, with a few twists. It starts as creeping dread before becoming fast paced. There's a real tension and worry about the Doctor and Martha saving the day. Though I KNOW they will, I still feel my heart racing as the story barrels towards its climax.\n\nThe characters feel real and remind me of a show about people colonizing a planet. Fortunately, this group has the Doctor and Martha on their side. The villain is a dark, imagined malevolence that isn't really revealed until a little ways past the halfway mark.\n\nIt's a good plot and I didn't hear any plot holes when I listened. Everyone has an equal part in the plot. There aren't throwaways here. It's a short story and the author makes every detail and character count.\n\nI LOVE Freema's reading. The actress always gets it right! I really wish her and David had read most of their adventures featuring their characters together. Not that there are really 'bad' narrators for the DW books, but Freema and David are top-notch!"
