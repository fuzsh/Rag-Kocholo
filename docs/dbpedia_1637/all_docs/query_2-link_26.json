        "text": "Farxiga is a brand-name prescription medication. It’s approved for different uses in adults with type 2 diabetes or heart failure.\n\nIn people with type 2 diabetes, it’s approved to:\n\nimprove blood sugar levels when used along with changes in diet and exercise\n\nreduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in people with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease\n\nIn people with heart failure with or without type 2 diabetes, it’s approved to:\n\nreduce the risk of either hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death* in people with reduced ejection fraction (EF)†\n\nFor people with chronic (long-lasting) kidney disease that may worsen, Farxiga is approved to reduce the risk of:\n\nlowered glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which can indicate poor kidney health\n\nend stage kidney disease\n\ncardiovascular death\n\nhospitalization for heart failure\n\nIt’s important to note that Farxiga isn’t approved to treat type 1 diabetes. And the drug also shouldn’t be used to treat a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). (DKA is a life threatening condition that’s related to diabetes.) It’s also not used for type 2 diabetes in certain people with kidney problems, or for kidney problems in certain people.\n\n* Cardiovascular death is death that’s related to a heart or blood vessel problem.\n\n† With reduced EF, your heart isn’t able to pump out as much blood to the rest of your body as usual.\n\nDrug details\n\nFarxiga can be used by itself or along with other diabetes and heart failure medications.\n\nFarxiga comes as a tablet you take by mouth once daily. It contains the active drug dapagliflozin. And it belongs to a class of medications called sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.\n\nEffectiveness\n\nIn clinical studies, Farxiga decreased fasting blood sugar* levels in people with type 2 diabetes by an average of 28.8 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). And the drug lowered their hemoglobin A1c (A1C)† level by an average of 0.9% after 24 weeks of treatment.\n\nAbout 44% to 51% of people in the studies who took Farxiga for 24 weeks reached their goal A1C of less than 7%.\n\nTo learn about Farxiga’s effectiveness for its other approved uses, see the “Farxiga uses” section below.\n\n* Fasting blood sugar is measured after you’ve fasted for a certain period of time. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends a fasting blood sugar level of 80 mg/dL to 130 mg/dL for most adults.\n\n† A1C is a measurement that shows your average blood sugar levels over the past 2 to 3 months. The ADA recommends an A1C goal of less than 7% for most adults.\n\nFarxiga can cause mild or serious side effects. The following list contains some of the key side effects that may occur while taking Farxiga. This list doesn’t include all possible side effects.\n\nFor more information on the possible side effects of Farxiga, or tips on how to manage a troubling side effect, talk with your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nNote: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) tracks side effects of drugs it has approved. If you would like to report to the FDA a side effect you’ve had with Farxiga, you can do so through MedWatch.\n\nMore common side effects\n\nThe more common side effects of Farxiga can include:\n\ngenital yeast infection\n\nrespiratory infections, such as the common cold or the flu\n\nurinary tract infection\n\nincreased urination\n\nback pain\n\nnausea\n\nincreased cholesterol levels\n\nconstipation\n\nSome of these side effects may go away within a few days or a couple of weeks. If they’re severe or don’t go away, talk with your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n* This is a partial list of mild side effects from Farxiga. To learn about other mild side effects, talk with your doctor or pharmacist, or visit Farxiga’s prescribing information.\n\nSerious side effects\n\nSerious side effects from Farxiga aren’t common, but they can occur. Call your doctor right away if you have serious side effects. Call 911 if your symptoms feel life threatening or if you think you’re having a medical emergency.\n\nSerious side effects and their symptoms can include the following:\n\nDehydration (low fluid level), which can cause other problems such as low blood pressure. Symptoms can include:\n\ndizziness\n\nfeeling faint\n\nlightheadedness\n\nweakness, especially when you stand up\n\nfatigue\n\nthirst\n\nHypoglycemia (low blood sugar level), if Farxiga is used in combination with insulin or a sulfonylurea drug such as glipizide (Glucotrol). Symptoms can include:\n\ndrowsiness\n\nheadache\n\nconfusion\n\nweakness\n\nhunger\n\nirritability\n\nsweating\n\nfeeling jittery\n\nfast heart rate\n\nSevere allergic reaction.*\n\nKidney damage.*\n\nSerious urinary tract infections (UTIs).*\n\nKetoacidosis.*\n\nFournier’s gangrene (necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum).*\n\n* For information about these serious side effects of Farxiga, see the “Side effect details” section just below.\n\nSide effect details\n\nYou may wonder how often certain side effects occur with this drug, or whether certain side effects pertain to it. Here’s some detail on several of the side effects this drug may or may not cause.\n\nYou can find further information about Farxiga’s side effects in this comprehensive article.\n\nAllergic reaction\n\nAs with most drugs, some people can have an allergic reaction after taking Farxiga. In clinical studies, 0.3% of people who took Farxiga had an allergic reaction to it.\n\nSymptoms of a mild allergic reaction can include:\n\nskin rash\n\nitchiness\n\nflushing\n\nA more severe allergic reaction is rare but possible. Symptoms of a severe allergic reaction can include:\n\nswelling under your skin, typically in your eyelids, lips, hands, or feet\n\nswelling of your tongue, mouth, or throat\n\ntrouble breathing\n\nCall your doctor right away if you have a severe allergic reaction to Farxiga. But call 911 if your symptoms feel life threatening or if you think you’re having a medical emergency.\n\nBack pain\n\nIn clinical studies, back pain occurred in up to 4% of people taking Farxiga. This side effect may go away with continued use of the drug. If you have back pain that doesn’t go away or becomes severe, talk with your doctor.\n\nKidney damage\n\nFarxiga can increase your risk of kidney damage. Symptoms of kidney damage can include:\n\nreduced urination\n\nswelling in your legs or ankles\n\nconfusion\n\nThis side effect didn’t occur in clinical tests of Farxiga, but later reports have mentioned it.\n\nKidney damage is more likely to occur if you’re dehydrated, have kidney or heart problems, or are over the age of 65 years. They’re also more likely if you take other medications that affect your kidneys.\n\nBefore you start taking Farxiga, your doctor will test how well your kidneys are working. If you have kidney problems, you may not be able to take Farxiga.\n\nYour doctor may also test your kidney function from time to time during your treatment with Farxiga. If they detect any problems with your kidneys, they may stop your treatment with the drug.\n\nGenital yeast infection\n\nFarxiga can increase your risk of genital yeast infection. In clinical studies, yeast infection occurred in up to about 8% of females and about 3% of males taking Farxiga.*\n\nPeople who had genital yeast infections in the past were more likely to have this side effect during studies.\n\nGenital yeast infection in males can cause a rash or discoloration on the penis. This condition is called balanitis or balanoposthitis, depending on what part of the penis is affected.\n\nIf you take Farxiga and get a rash or discoloration on your genitals, talk with your doctor. They may prescribe a medication to treat the infection.\n\n* Sex and gender exist on spectrums. Use of the terms “male” and “female” in this article refers to sex assigned at birth.\n\nUrinary tract infection (UTI)\n\nFarxiga can increase your risk of urinary tract infection (UTI). In clinical studies, UTI occurred in up to about 6% of people taking the drug.\n\nSymptoms of UTI can include:\n\nburning sensation when urinating\n\nthe need to urinate more often\n\nthe need to urinate right away\n\npain in the lower part of your abdomen (belly)\n\nblood in your urine\n\nIn rare cases, people taking Farxiga and other drugs similar to it have developed serious UTIs. Serious UTIs may require treatment in a hospital. Examples of serious UTIs include:\n\nurosepsis (a serious reaction to a UTI)\n\npyelonephritis (a kidney infection)\n\nIf you think you might have a UTI, call your doctor. They can check to see if you have a UTI, and they’ll recommend treatment if needed.\n\nKetoacidosis\n\nAlthough uncommon, some people who take Farxiga can develop a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis.\n\nThis condition occurs when the cells of your body aren’t getting the glucose they need for energy. Instead, your body uses fat for energy. If your body breaks down fat too quickly for energy, it can cause excessive levels of chemicals in your blood called ketones. This can cause your blood to become too acidic. In severe cases, this condition can cause coma or death.\n\nThe first symptoms of ketoacidosis typically include:\n\nthirst and dry mouth\n\nurinating more often than usual\n\nhigh blood sugar levels\n\nhigh levels of ketones in your urine\n\nLater symptoms may include:\n\nnausea and vomiting\n\npain in your abdomen (belly)\n\nweakness or fatigue (lack of energy)\n\nfruity-smelling breath\n\ntrouble breathing\n\nconfusion\n\nIf you have any of these symptoms, call your doctor right away. If your symptoms are severe, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room.\n\nFournier’s gangrene\n\nWhile it hasn’t occurred in clinical studies of Farxiga, a condition called Fournier’s gangrene has been reported in people using Farxiga and other drugs in its class.\n\nAlso called necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum, it’s an infection of the area between the genitals and the rectum. This condition is rare but can be life threatening, and it can affect both males and females.*\n\nSymptoms of Fournier’s gangrene can include:\n\npain, tenderness, swelling, and discoloration in the genital or rectal area\n\nfever\n\nmalaise (overall feeling of discomfort)\n\nFournier’s gangrene requires immediate care, which could include medication, hospitalization, or surgery. If you’re taking Farxiga and have symptoms of this condition, seek immediate medical care. Call 911 (or your local emergency number) or go to the closest emergency room.\n\n* Sex and gender exist on spectrums. Use of the terms “male” and “female” in this article refers to sex assigned at birth.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves prescription drugs such as Farxiga to treat certain conditions. Farxiga may also be used off-label for other conditions. Off-label use is when a drug that’s approved to treat one condition is used to treat a different condition.\n\nBelow, we describe Farxiga’s approved uses. It’s important to note that Farxiga isn’t approved to treat type 1 diabetes. And the drug also shouldn’t be used to treat diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is a life threatening condition that’s related to diabetes. It’s also not used for type 2 diabetes in certain people with kidney problems, or for kidney problems in certain people.\n\nFarxiga for type 2 diabetes\n\nFarxiga is FDA-approved for use in adults with type 2 diabetes to:\n\nimprove blood sugar levels when used along with improved diet and exercise\n\nreduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in people with either heart disease or risk factors* for heart disease\n\nDiabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) condition. With diabetes, the level of sugar (glucose) in your bloodstream builds up. Typically, a hormone called insulin helps to move glucose from your bloodstream into your cells. (Once inside your cells, glucose is used to make energy.)\n\nBut with type 2 diabetes, your body’s cells don’t respond to insulin as well as they should. And in the later stages of diabetes, your body also might not make enough insulin.\n\nHaving type 2 diabetes that’s not managed can cause your blood glucose level to be high all the time. And this can cause several symptoms that may lead to serious complications, such as heart failure.\n\nFor further details about type 2 diabetes, you can see our diabetes hub.\n\n* Some examples of risk factors for heart disease include being of an older age, having high cholesterol or high blood pressure, and smoking.\n\nHow type 2 diabetes and heart failure are connected\n\nMany of the risk factors and changes in bodily functions are the same for both type 2 diabetes and heart failure. So both of these conditions can be a risk factor for the other.\n\nFor example, having too much sugar and insulin in your bloodstream also causes fatty buildup and inflammation in your blood vessels. This weakens your heart and can lead to heart failure. On the other hand, having heart failure is linked to metabolic problems (problems with your body’s ability to process energy). And this can lead to unmanaged blood sugar and diabetes.\n\nIn clinical studies, people with type 2 diabetes were two to four times more likely to develop heart failure. They also had a 50% higher risk of hospitalization than someone without diabetes.\n\nIf you have heart failure without diabetes, you have up to a 60% risk of developing insulin resistance. (With insulin resistance, your body’s insulin isn’t working as it should to move glucose from your bloodstream into your cells.)\n\nBecause of the link between type 2 diabetes and heart failure, drugs like Farxiga can help improve both conditions.\n\nEffectiveness for glucose management in type 2 diabetes\n\nA large number of clinical trials have been performed on Farxiga in people with type 2 diabetes. In some studies, different doses of Farxiga alone were compared with a placebo (treatment with no active drug).\n\nIn other studies, combinations of Farxiga and other diabetes drugs were compared with a placebo or different diabetes drug. These other diabetes drugs include metformin, glipizide, glimepiride, glyburide, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, exenatide, and insulin.\n\nOne clinical study compared treatment with Farxiga alone to that of a placebo in people with untreated type 2 diabetes. After 24 weeks of treatment:\n\npeople taking Farxiga 5 mg had their fasting blood sugar* levels decreased by 24.1 mg/dL and their hemoglobin A1c (A1C)† level was lowered by 0.8%, on average\n\npeople taking Farxiga 10 mg had their fasting blood sugar levels decreased by 28.8 mg/dL and their A1C level lowered by 0.9%, on average\n\npeople taking the placebo had their fasting blood sugar levels decreased by 4.1 mg/dL and their A1C level lowered by 0.2%, on average\n\nAbout 44% to 51% of people in this study who took Farxiga for 24 weeks reached their goal A1C of less than 7%. In the placebo group, only about 32% of people reached their goal.\n\nOther clinical studies looked at treatment with Farxiga in combination with other diabetes drugs in people with type 2 diabetes. The studies showed that the people had similar or better results as people taking Farxiga alone.\n\n* Fasting blood sugar is measured after you’ve fasted for a certain period of time. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends a fasting blood sugar level of 80 mg/dL to 130 mg/dL for most adults.\n\n† A1C is a measurement that shows your average blood sugar levels over the past 2 to 3 months. The ADA recommends an A1C goal of less than 7% for most adults.\n\nEffectiveness for reducing hospitalization risk from heart failure in type 2 diabetes\n\nIn a clinical study, people taking Farxiga had a 27% lower rate of hospitalization due to heart failure than people taking a placebo. (A placebo is a treatment with no active drug.) People in this study had type 2 diabetes. And they were followed for about 4 years.\n\nFarxiga for heart failure\n\nFarxiga is approved for use in adults with heart failure. For this use, the drug is given to people with reduced ejection fraction (EF)* to reduce the risk for:\n\nhospitalization for heart failure, and\n\ncardiovascular death (death that’s related to a heart or blood vessel problem)\n\n* With reduced EF, your heart isn’t able to pump out as much blood to the rest of your body as usual.\n\nWith heart failure, your heart isn’t working as well to pump blood throughout your body. Without enough blood flow, your body can’t function as it should. Typical symptoms of heart failure can include:\n\nshortness of breath\n\ntiredness\n\nedema (swelling) in your legs, ankles, and feet\n\nTo learn more about heart failure, you can refer to our cardiovascular health hub.\n\nEffectiveness for reducing death in people with heart failure\n\nIn a clinical study, people taking Farxiga had an 18% lower rate of death due to heart or blood vessel problems compared with people taking a placebo. (A placebo is a treatment with no active drug.) People in this study were followed for 18 months.\n\nEffectiveness for reducing hospitalization risk of heart failure\n\nIn the same clinical study as above, people taking Farxiga had a 30% lower likelihood of being hospitalized for heart failure compared with people taking a placebo.\n\nFarxiga for kidney disease\n\nFor people with chronic (long-lasting) kidney disease that may worsen, Farxiga is FDA-approved to lower certain risks. Specifically, it’s used to reduce the risk of:\n\nlowered glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which can indicate poor kidney health\n\nend stage kidney disease\n\ncardiovascular death (death that’s related to a heart or blood vessel problem)\n\nhospitalization for heart failure\n\nWith chronic kidney disease, your kidneys don’t work as well as usual to clean and filter your blood. This condition gets worse over time, and it may lead to kidney failure.\n\nPossible symptoms of kidney disease can include:\n\nreduced urine output\n\ndark colored urine or blood in your urine\n\nedema (swelling) in your legs, ankles, and feet\n\nhigh blood pressure\n\nfatigue\n\nconfusion\n\nEffectiveness for reducing complications in people with kidney disease\n\nClinical studies showed that Farxiga was effective in reducing complications in people with kidney disease. To see how the drug performed in these studies, check out Farxiga’s prescribing information.\n\nOther possible uses for Farxiga\n\nThe FDA hasn’t approved other uses for Farxiga. However, the drug may be used off-label for certain purposes. Off-label use is when a drug is approved for one purpose but is prescribed for a different purpose.\n\nFarxiga for type 1 diabetes (not an acceptable use)\n\nFarxiga is approved to treat type 2 diabetes. But it’s not approved to treat type 1 diabetes, and it should not be used to treat this condition.\n\nIn one clinical study, Farxiga reduced blood sugar levels, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c),* and total daily insulin doses in people with type 1 diabetes. However, the drug also increased the risk for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is a life threatening condition that’s related to diabetes.\n\nPeople with type 1 diabetes already have a risk for DKA. This risk may be increased if they take Farxiga.\n\nThe risk of having DKA outweighs the potential benefits of using Farxiga in people with type 1 diabetes. So Farxiga should not be used by people with type 1 diabetes.\n\n* A1C is a measurement that shows your average blood sugar levels over the past 2 to 3 months. The American Diabetes Association recommends an A1C goal of less than 7% for most adults.\n\nFarxiga for weight loss\n\nMany people with diabetes who take Farxiga lose weight. Your doctor may recommend Farxiga for you if you have type 2 diabetes and overweight.\n\nBut keep in mind that Farxiga hasn’t been studied or approved as an aid to weight loss. You should only take Farxiga as prescribed by your doctor.\n\nFor more information about this, see the “Farxiga for weight loss” section below.\n\nFarxiga is only available as a brand-name drug. It contains the drug dapagliflozin, which isn’t currently available in generic form.\n\nThe following information describes dosages that are commonly used or recommended. However, be sure to take the dosage your doctor prescribes for you. Your doctor will determine the best dosage to suit your needs.\n\nFor more information, you can also refer to this detailed article about Farxiga’s dosage.\n\nDrug forms and strengths\n\nFarxiga comes as an oral tablet. It’s available in two strengths: 5 milligrams (mg) and 10 mg.\n\nDosage for type 2 diabetes\n\nThe typical starting dosage of Farxiga for type 2 diabetes is 5 mg once daily.\n\nIf this dosage of Farxiga doesn’t lower your blood sugar levels enough (and it also doesn’t cause troubling side effects), your doctor may increase your dosage to 10 mg once daily.\n\nThe maximum dosage of Farxiga for type 2 diabetes is 10 mg once daily.\n\nThe dosage to reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in people with type 2 diabetes and heart disease or risk factors for heart disease is 10 mg once daily.\n\nDosage for heart failure\n\nFarxiga is approved to lower the risk of certain complications of heart failure in adults. (For more information about this, see the section below called “Farxiga uses.”)\n\nThe typical dosage for this use is 10 mg once daily.\n\nDosage for kidney disease\n\nFarxiga is approved to lower the risk of certain complications of chronic (long-lasting) kidney disease that may worsen. (For more information about this, see the section below called “Farxiga uses.”)\n\nThe typical dosage for this use is 10 mg once daily.\n\nWhat if I miss a dose?\n\nIf you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If it’s almost time for your next dose, just take that one dose. Don’t try to catch up by taking two doses at once. This can cause dangerous side effects.\n\nWill I need to use this drug long term?\n\nFarxiga is meant to be used as a long-term treatment. If you and your doctor determine that Farxiga is safe and effective for you, you’ll likely take it long term.\n\nDo I need to take this drug with food?\n\nFarxiga can be taken with or without food.\n\nWhile Farxiga isn’t approved as a weight-loss medication, weight loss can be an effect of the drug.\n\nIn clinical studies, people taking Farxiga lost up to about 7 pounds (3 kilograms) over 24 weeks of treatment. Because of this effect, your doctor may recommend Farxiga if you have type 2 diabetes and overweight.\n\nIt’s thought that Farxiga causes weight loss because it sends extra glucose (sugar) from your blood into your urine. That means the calories from the glucose leave your body in your urine, which may lead to weight loss.\n\nNote: Farxiga should only be used according to your doctor’s prescription. You shouldn’t use Farxiga for weight loss or any other purpose without your doctor’s guidance.\n\nFarxiga can be used by itself or along with other:\n\ndiabetes medications\n\nheart failure medications\n\nkidney disease medications\n\nExamples of these drugs are listed below.\n\nFarxiga and other diabetes medications\n\nFarxiga can be used alone or along with other diabetes medications to treat type 2 diabetes. If a single drug, such as Farxiga, doesn’t lower your blood sugar or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)* levels enough, your doctor may prescribe two or more diabetes drugs.\n\nExamples of other diabetes drugs that may be used with Farxiga include:\n\nmetformin (Glumetza)\n\ndulaglutide (Trulicity)\n\nexenatide (Bydureon BCise, Byetta)\n\nliraglutide (Victoza)\n\nlixisenatide (Adlyxin)\n\nsaxagliptin (Onglyza)\n\nsitagliptin (Januvia)\n\ninsulin glargine (Lantus, Toujeo)\n\npioglitazone (Actos)\n\nglimepiride (Amaryl)\n\nglipizide (Glucotrol XL)\n\nglyburide (Glynase, Diabeta)\n\n* A1C is a measurement that shows your average blood sugar levels over the past 2 to 3 months. The American Diabetes Association recommends an A1C goal of less than 7% for most adults.\n\nFarxiga and metformin\n\nFarxiga and metformin (Glumetza) are commonly used together to treat type 2 diabetes. In clinical studies, taking Farxiga plus metformin reduced blood sugar levels, HbA1c, and weight more than when either drug was taken by itself.\n\nFarxiga and Bydureon BCise\n\nFarxiga is sometimes used with Bydureon BCise (exenatide) to treat type 2 diabetes. In one study, taking Farxiga plus Bydureon BCise reduced HbA1c more than when either drug was taken by itself.\n\nFarxiga and glimepiride\n\nFarxiga is sometimes used with glimepiride (Amaryl) to treat type 2 diabetes. In a study, taking Farxiga and glimepiride together reduced fasting blood sugar levels, HbA1c, and weight more than when glimepiride was taken alone.\n\nFarxiga and other heart medications\n\nFarxiga may be taken with other drugs used to treat heart failure. These drugs include:\n\nangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, such as:\n\ncaptopril\n\nenalapril (Vasotec)\n\nlisinopril (Zestril)\n\nangiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), such as:\n\nlosartan (Cozaar)\n\ncandesartan (Atacand)\n\nvalsartan (Diovan)\n\nangiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI), such as sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto)\n\nbeta-blockers, such as:\n\nbisoprolol\n\ncarvedilol (Coreg)\n\nmetoprolol (Toprol XL)\n\nmineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, such as spironolactone (Aldactone)\n\nFarxiga and other kidney medications\n\nFarxiga may be taken with other drugs used to treat chronic (long-lasting) kidney disease. These drugs include:\n\nphosphate binders, such as:\n\ncalcium acetate (PhosLo)\n\nlanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol)\n\nsevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel)\n\nsucroferric oxyhydroxide (Velphoro)\n\nvitamin D analogs, such as\n\ncalcitriol (Rocaltrol)\n\ndoxercalciferol (Hectorol)\n\nparicalcitol (Zemplar)\n\niron supplements, such as:\n\nferrous sulfate\n\niron sucrose (Venofer)\n\niron dextran (Dexferrum)\n\nferric gluconate (Ferrlecit)\n\nferric carboxymaltose (Injectafer)\n\nfinerenone (Kerendia)\n\nAvoid drinking too much alcohol while taking Farxiga. Alcohol can change your blood sugar levels and increase your risk of low blood sugar.\n\nIf you drink alcohol, talk with your doctor about how much alcohol is safe for you while taking Farxiga.\n\nFarxiga can interact with several other medications. It can also interact with certain supplements as well as certain foods.\n\nDifferent interactions can cause different effects. For instance, some can interfere with how well a drug works, while others can cause increased side effects.\n\nFarxiga and other medications\n\nBelow is a list of medications that can interact with Farxiga. This list doesn’t contain all drugs that may interact with Farxiga.\n\nBefore taking Farxiga, be sure to tell your doctor and pharmacist about all prescription, over-the-counter, and other drugs you take. Also tell them about any vitamins, herbs, and supplements you use. Sharing this information can help you avoid potential interactions.\n\nIf you have questions about drug interactions that may affect you, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nFarxiga and drugs that increase the risk of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)\n\nTaking Farxiga with certain medications can lower your blood sugar levels and increase your risk of hypoglycemia. If you take these medications, you may need to check your blood sugar levels more often. Also, your doctor may need to change the dosage of your diabetes medications.\n\nExamples of these medications include:\n\ncertain other diabetes medications, such as:\n\nglyburide (Glynase, Diabeta)\n\nglimepiride (Amaryl)\n\nglipizide (Glucotrol)\n\ninsulin products, such as insulin glargine (Lantus, Toujeo)\n\ncertain high blood pressure medications, such as:\n\nbenazepril (Lotensin)\n\ncandesartan (Atacand)\n\nenalapril (Vasotec)\n\nirbesartan (Avapro)\n\nolmesartan (Benicar)\n\nperindopril\n\nquinapril (Accupril)\n\nramipril (Altace)\n\nvalsartan (Diovan)\n\nother medications, such as:\n\ndisopyramide (Norpace)\n\nfluoxetine (Prozac)\n\npentoxifylline\n\nsulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (Bactrim, Septra)\n\nFarxiga and drugs that increase blood sugar levels\n\nTaking Farxiga with certain medications can increase your blood sugar levels. This can cancel out some or all of the effects of Farxiga. If you take these medications, you may need to check your blood sugar levels more often. Also, your doctor may need to increase your Farxiga dosage.\n\nExamples of these medications include:\n\nchlorthalidone\n\nhydrochlorothiazide (Microzide)\n\nlevothyroxine (Levoxyl, Synthroid, Tirosint)\n\nniacin (Slo-Niacin, others)\n\nFarxiga and drugs that lower blood pressure\n\nTaking Farxiga with certain medications that decrease blood pressure may cause your blood pressure to become too low. It may also increase your risk of becoming dehydrated, which could result in kidney damage in rare cases.\n\nIt’s typically safe to take these medications together with Farxiga. However, it’s important that you follow your doctor’s instructions for staying hydrated. Your doctor may also prescribe a lower dose of Farxiga, the other medication, or both.\n\nExamples of these medications include:\n\nbenazepril (Lotensin)\n\ncandesartan (Atacand)\n\nenalapril (Vasotec)\n\nirbesartan (Avapro)\n\nolmesartan (Benicar)\n\nperindopril\n\nquinapril (Accupril)\n\nramipril (Altace)\n\nvalsartan (Diovan)\n\nFarxiga and herbs and supplements\n\nTaking certain herbs and supplements with Farxiga may increase your risk of low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia). Examples of these include:\n\nalpha-lipoic acid\n\nbanaba\n\nbitter melon\n\nchromium\n\ngymnema\n\nprickly pear cactus\n\nwhite mulberry\n\nOther drugs are available that can treat your condition. Some may be better suited for you than others. If you’re interested in finding an alternative to Farxiga, talk with your doctor to learn more about other medications that may work well for you.\n\nAlternatives for type 2 diabetes\n\nSome of these alternative medications for type 2 diabetes are in the same class as Farxiga, while others are in different drug classes. Examples of these drugs include:\n\nsodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, such as:\n\ncanagliflozin (Invokana)\n\nempagliflozin (Jardiance)\n\nertugliflozin (Steglatro)\n\nincretin mimetics/glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) receptor agonists, such as:\n\ndulaglutide (Trulicity)\n\nexenatide (Bydureon BCise, Byetta)\n\nliraglutide (Victoza)\n\nlixisenatide (Adlyxin)\n\nsemaglutide (Ozempic, Rybelsus)\n\nmetformin (Glumetza), which is a biguanide\n\ndipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, such as:\n\nalogliptin (Nesina)\n\nlinagliptin (Tradjenta)\n\nsaxagliptin (Onglyza)\n\nsitagliptin (Januvia)\n\nthiazolidinediones, such as:\n\npioglitazone (Actos)\n\nrosiglitazone (Avandia)\n\nalpha-glucosidase inhibitors, such as:\n\nmiglitol\n\nsulfonylureas, such as:\n\nglimepiride (Amaryl)\n\nglipizide (Glucotrol)\n\nglyburide (Glynase, Diabeta)\n\nAlternatives for heart failure\n\nExamples of other drugs that may be used to reduce the risk of certain complications in people with heart failure include:\n\nangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, such as:\n\ncaptopril\n\nenalapril (Vasotec)\n\nlisinopril (Zestril)\n\nangiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), such as:\n\nlosartan (Cozaar)\n\ncandesartan (Atacand)\n\nvalsartan (Diovan)\n\nangiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI), such as sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto)\n\nbeta-blockers, such as:\n\nbisoprolol\n\ncarvedilol (Coreg)\n\nmetoprolol (Toprol XL)\n\nmineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, such as spironolactone (Aldactone)\n\nAlternatives for kidney disease\n\nExamples of other drugs that may be used to reduce the risk of certain complications in people with chronic (long-lasting) kidney disease include:\n\nphosphate binders, such as:\n\ncalcium acetate (PhosLo)\n\nlanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol)\n\nsevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel)\n\nsucroferric oxyhydroxide (Velphoro)\n\nvitamin D analogs, such as\n\ncalcitriol (Rocaltrol)\n\ndoxercalciferol (Hectorol)\n\nparicalcitol (Zemplar)\n\niron supplements, such as:\n\nferrous sulfate\n\niron sucrose (Venofer)\n\niron dextran (Dexferrum)\n\nferric gluconate (Ferrlecit)\n\nferric carboxymaltose (Injectafer)\n\nthe sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor canagliflozin (Invokana), which should not be used with Farxiga\n\nfinerenone (Kerendia)\n\nFarxiga and Jardiance (empagliflozin) are both in the same class of medications: sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. This means they work in the same way to treat type 2 diabetes.\n\nIngredients\n\nFarxiga contains the active drug dapagliflozin. Jardiance contains the active drug empagliflozin.\n\nUses\n\nBoth Farxiga and Jardiance are FDA-approved to improve blood sugar management in adults with type 2 diabetes when used with improved diet and exercise.\n\nFarxiga is also approved to:\n\nReduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in adults with type 2 diabetes. For this use, Farxiga is prescribed for adults who have heart disease or risk factors for heart disease.\n\nReduce the risk of certain complications from heart failure in adults.\n\nReduce the risk of certain complications from kidney disease in adults.\n\nJardiance is also approved to:\n\nReduce the risk of cardiovascular death in people with both type 2 diabetes and heart disease.

Below are examples of these side effects.\n\nMore common side effects\n\nMore common side effects that can occur with both Farxiga and Jardiance include:\n\ngenital yeast infection\n\nrespiratory infections such as the common cold or flu\n\nurinary tract infection\n\nincreased urination\n\nback pain\n\nnausea\n\nincreased cholesterol levels\n\nSerious side effects\n\nSerious side effects that can occur with both Farxiga and Jardiance include:\n\ndehydration (low fluid level), which may cause complications such as low blood pressure\n\nketoacidosis (increased ketones in the blood or urine)\n\nkidney damage*\n\nserious urinary tract infections\n\nlow blood sugar (hypoglycemia)\n\nsevere allergic reaction\n\n* Both Farxiga and Jardiance can cause kidney damage. However, an analysis of studies found that the risk of kidney damage may be higher in people who take Farxiga compared to those who take Jardiance.\n\nEffectiveness\n\nBoth Farxiga and Jardiance are used to treat type 2 diabetes. Both can be used to reduce certain risks in adults with type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Farxiga and Jardiance are recommended as treatment options for people with type 2 diabetes by the American Diabetes Association.\n\nBoth Farxiga and Jardiance can also be used to reduce certain risks in adults with heart failure. However, the two drugs haven’t been compared for these uses.\n\nCosts\n\nBoth Farxiga and Jardiance are available as brand-name drugs. They’re not available in generic forms, which typically cost less than brand-name forms.\n\nFarxiga may cost a little more than Jardiance. The exact price you pay for either drug depends on your insurance plan.\n\nYou may wonder how Farxiga compares to other medications that are prescribed for similar uses. Below are comparisons between Farxiga and several medications.\n\nFarxiga vs. Invokana\n\nFarxiga and Invokana (canagliflozin) are both in the same class of medications: sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. This means they work in the same way to treat type 2 diabetes.\n\nUses\n\nBoth Farxiga and Invokana are FDA-approved to improve blood sugar management in adults with type 2 diabetes when used with improved diet and exercise.\n\nFarxiga is also approved to:\n\nReduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in adults with type 2 diabetes. For this use, Farxiga is prescribed for adults who have heart disease or risk factors for heart disease.\n\nReduce the risk of certain complications from heart failure in adults.\n\nReduce the risk of certain complications from kidney disease in adults.\n\nInvokana is also approved to lower the risk of heart attack and stroke in people with both type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD).\n\nIn addition, in people with type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy (a type of kidney disease caused by diabetes) with albuminuria (too much protein in your urine), Invokana is approved to reduce the risk of:\n\nend stage kidney disease\n\ndoubled level of creatinine in their blood\n\ndeath from cardiovascular problems\n\nneed for hospitalization due to heart failure\n\nDrug forms and administration\n\nBoth Farxiga and Invokana come as tablets that are taken by mouth.\n\nSide effects and risks\n\nFarxiga and Invokana have similar effects in the body, and therefore cause very similar side effects. Below are examples of these side effects.\n\nMore common side effects\n\nThese lists contain some of the more common mild side effects that can occur with each drug, as well as mild side effects that both drugs may share.\n\nCan occur with Farxiga:\n\nrespiratory infections, such as the common cold or flu\n\nback pain\n\nCan occur with Invokana:\n\nthirst\n\nCan occur with both Farxiga and Invokana:\n\nurinary tract infection\n\nincreased urination\n\nnausea\n\ngenital yeast infection\n\nincreased cholesterol\n\nconstipation\n\nSerious side effects\n\nThese lists contain examples of serious side effects that can occur with Farxiga or Invokana, as well as serious side effects that both drugs may share.\n\nCan occur with Farxiga:\n\nfew unique serious side effects\n\nCan occur with Invokana:\n\nhigh potassium levels\n\nbone fracture\n\nincreased risk of lower limb amputation\n\nCan occur with both Farxiga and Invokana:\n\ndehydration (low fluid level), which may cause complications such as low blood pressure\n\nketoacidosis (increased ketones in blood or urine)\n\nkidney damage\n\nserious urinary tract infections\n\nlow blood sugar (hypoglycemia)\n\nsevere allergic reaction\n\nEffectiveness\n\nBoth Farxiga and Invokana are used to treat type 2 diabetes and reduce the risk of certain heart-related problems in people with type 2 diabetes. Guidelines from the American Diabetes Association endorse either drug as a treatment option for these uses.\n\nBoth Farxiga and Invokana can reduce symptoms of worsening heart failure in people with type 2 diabetes. One analysis found that Invokana and Farxiga worked about equally well in reducing heart failure symptoms.\n\nCosts\n\nBoth Farxiga and Invokana are available as brand-name drugs. They’re not available in generic forms, which typically cost less than brand-name forms.\n\nFarxiga and Invokana cost about the same amount. The exact price you pay for either drug will depend on your insurance plan.\n\nFarxiga vs. metformin\n\nFarxiga and metformin (Glumetza) are often used together to treat type 2 diabetes. Below is more information about how the drugs compare.\n\nUses\n\nFarxiga and metformin are both FDA-approved to improve blood sugar management in adults with type 2 diabetes when used with changes in diet and exercise.\n\nFarxiga is also approved to:\n\nReduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in adults with type 2 diabetes. For this use, Farxiga is prescribed for adults who have heart disease or risk factors for heart disease.\n\nReduce the risk of certain complications from heart failure in adults.\n\nReduce the risk of certain complications from kidney disease in adults.\n\nDrug forms and administration\n\nBoth Farxiga and metformin come as tablets that are taken by mouth. Metformin is also available as a solution that is taken by mouth.\n\nSide effects and risks\n\nLike most other drugs, Farxiga and metformin may each cause side effects, and some of these effects may be similar.\n\nFor more information about Farxiga’s potential side effects, see the “Farxiga side effects” section above. And for more information about metformin’s potential side effects, see the “Metformin side effects” section of this article.\n\nEffectiveness\n\nFarxiga and metformin are often used together to treat type 2 diabetes. In clinical studies, taking Farxiga alongside metformin reduced blood sugar levels, HbA1c, and weight more than when either drug was taken on its own.\n\nCosts\n\nFarxiga is a brand-name medication that is not available in a generic form. However, metformin is a generic drug. It is also available as the brand-name medications Glumetza and Fortamet.\n\nGeneric medications typically cost less than brand-name drugs. However, the exact price you pay for either drug will depend on your insurance plan.\n\nYou should take Farxiga according to your doctor’s instructions.\n\nWhen to take\n\nThere’s no best time of day to take Farxiga, but your doctor may recommend taking your dose in the morning. Try to take Farxiga consistently at the same time of day. This helps Farxiga work effectively.\n\nTo help make sure that you don’t miss a dose, try using a medication reminder. This can include setting an alarm or using a timer. You could also download a reminder app on your phone.\n\nTaking Farxiga with food\n\nFarxiga can be taken with or without food.\n\nCan Farxiga be crushed?\n\nThe manufacturer of Farxiga hasn’t stated whether it’s safe to crush Farxiga. Therefore, it might be safer to avoid crushing it.\n\nFarxiga helps improve blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. It also helps lower the risk of complications from heart failure and kidney disease in certain people.\n\nHow insulin affects blood sugar\n\nTypically, when you eat food, your body releases a hormone called insulin. Insulin helps transport glucose (sugar) from your bloodstream into the cells of your body. The cells then turn the glucose into energy.\n\nPeople with type 2 diabetes usually have insulin resistance. This means their body doesn’t respond to insulin the way it should. Over time, people with type 2 diabetes may also stop producing enough insulin.\n\nWhen your body doesn’t respond to insulin the way it should, or if it doesn’t produce enough insulin, this causes problems.\n\nThe cells of your body may not get the glucose they need to work correctly. Also, you may get too much glucose in your blood. This is called high blood sugar (hyperglycemia). Having too much glucose in your blood can damage your body and organs, including your eyes, heart, nerves, and kidneys.\n\nWhat Farxiga does for diabetes\n\nFarxiga belongs to a class of drugs called sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. A class of drugs is a group of medications that work in a similar way. These drugs are often used to treat similar conditions.\n\nFarxiga lowers your blood sugar levels by causing your kidneys to get rid of excess sugar in your blood through your urine.\n\nWhat Farxiga does for heart failure\n\nFarxiga likely treats symptoms of heart failure in many different ways. Symptoms of heart failure that may be reduced with Farxiga include:\n\nchest pain\n\nshortness of breath\n\nedema (swelling) in your legs, ankles, and feet\n\nThe possible ways that Farxiga may work to treat heart failure include:\n\nLowering sodium. Farxiga causes your body to get rid of extra sodium through your urine. Having too much sodium in your body can lead to high blood pressure, which makes your heart work harder than usual. And over time, high blood pressure may make your heart muscle thicken and be unable to pump as well as usual.\n\nReducing edema. Farxiga helps to reduce edema (swelling) in your body. With heart failure, your heart is weakened and can’t pump blood as well as usual. This can lead to fluid buildup, which causes swelling.\n\nIncreasing the strength of your heart. Farxiga improves your heart’s energy supply by helping your body turn blood sugar into energy. This results in your heart having more strength to pump blood. Well-managed blood sugar levels also reduce stress and inflammation in your blood vessels and heart.\n\nReducing muscle thickening in your heart. Farxiga reduces thickening of the muscle wall in your heart’s left ventricle. (The left ventricle is the main pumping chamber of the heart.) In one type of heart failure, the left ventricle is weakened because its wall is too thick. This causes problems with how well your heart is able to pump blood.\n\nWhat Farxiga does for kidney disease\n\nFarxiga belongs to a class of drugs called sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. (A class of drugs is a group of medications that work in a similar way.)\n\nInhibiting SGLT2 has been shown to help people with kidney disease by:\n\nLowering sodium. Farxiga causes your body to get rid of extra sodium through your urine. Having too much sodium in your body can lead to high blood pressure, including the pressure inside your kidneys. High pressure inside your kidneys can cause kidney damage.\n\nLowering blood sugar. Farxiga lowers your blood sugar level by causing your kidneys to get rid of excess sugar from your blood through your urine. Having a lower blood sugar level helps prevent your kidney function from worsening.\n\nLowering blood pressure. Farxiga causes your kidneys to get rid of excess blood sugar and sodium. It also causes you to lose fluid from your body, helping to lower your blood pressure. Lowering high blood pressure has been shown to help prevent kidney disease from getting worse.\n\nHow long does it take to work?\n\nIn people with diabetes, Farxiga begins to work to lower blood sugar levels within 30 to 60 minutes of when it’s taken. And it reaches its peak (highest) effect about 2 hours after it’s been taken. When first starting Farxiga, it may take days to weeks to see the drug’s full effects on your blood sugar level.\n\nFarxiga works to lower the risk of certain complications in people with heart failure or kidney disease over time. You may not “feel” the drug working when it’s prescribed for this use, but you may notice a reduction in your symptoms.\n\nThere are limited studies on this drug’s effects on human pregnancies. However, animal studies have shown that kidney problems can occur in a fetus. Because of this risk, Farxiga shouldn’t be used during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.\n\nDuring the first trimester, Farxiga should only be used if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks.\n\nIf you’re pregnant or planning to become pregnant, talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of using Farxiga during pregnancy.\n\nIt isn’t known if Farxiga passes into breast milk. However, the drug’s manufacturer recommends against breastfeeding while taking Farxiga. This is because if Farxiga does pass into breast milk, there’s a possible risk of side effects in a child who’s breastfed.\n\nTalk with your doctor about safe feeding options for your child if you’re taking Farxiga.\n\nHere are answers to some frequently asked questions about Farxiga.\n\nDo Farxiga and metformin both cause weight loss?\n\nYes, both Farxiga and metformin (another drug used to treat diabetes) can cause weight loss. In clinical studies, people taking Farxiga lost up to about 7 pounds (3 kilograms) over 24 weeks of treatment. In clinical studies of metformin, mild weight loss has also occurred, usually from less than 1 pound (0.5 kilograms) up to about 8 pounds (4 kilograms).\n\nWhen these medications are taken together, people usually lose more weight than when taking these drugs by themselves.\n\nIs Farxiga a diuretic?\n\nNo, Farxiga isn’t classified as a diuretic. Farxiga is in a class of medications called sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.\n\nHowever, Farxiga has some effects that are similar to the effects of diuretics. For instance, Farxiga can make you urinate more and can cause dehydration, which diuretics can also do. (With dehydration, you have a low fluid level in your body.)\n\nDoes Farxiga make you tired?\n\nTiredness isn’t a side effect that has occurred in studies of Farxiga. However, tiredness is a possible symptom of heart failure, which Farxiga is used to help manage.\n\nHowever, fatigue (lack of energy) and weakness can be signs of dehydration (low fluid level) and low blood sugar. And these conditions are both possible side effects of Farxiga.\n\nDoes Farxiga cause constipation?\n\nYes, it can. Some people who take Farxiga can have constipation. In clinical studies, this effect occurred in about 2% of people who took Farxiga.\n\nTaking too much of this medication can increase your risk of serious side effects.\n\nOverdose symptoms\n\nThere is very little information about the symptoms you might have if you take too much Farxiga. Possible symptoms of an overdose might include:\n\nlow blood sugar level (hypoglycemia)\n\nnausea\n\nkidney damage\n\nWhat to do in case of overdose\n\nIf you think you’ve taken too much of this drug, call your doctor or seek guidance from the American Association of Poison Control Centers at 800-222-1222 or through its online tool. But if your symptoms are severe, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room right away.\n\nAs with all medications, the cost of Farxiga can vary. The actual price you’ll pay depends on your insurance plan, your location, and the pharmacy you use.\n\nYour insurance plan may require you to get prior authorization before approving coverage for Farxiga. This means that your doctor and insurance company will need to communicate about your prescription before the insurance company will cover the drug. The insurance company will review the prior authorization request and decide if the drug will be covered.\n\nIf you’re not sure if you’ll need to get prior authorization for Farxiga, contact your insurance company.\n\nYou can refer to this article for more information about the cost of Farxiga.\n\nFinancial and insurance assistance\n\nIf you need financial support to pay for Farxiga, or if you need help understanding your insurance coverage, help is available.\n\nAstraZeneca, the manufacturer of Farxiga, offers a savings card that may lower the cost of Farxiga. For more information and to find out if you’re eligible for support, visit the program website.\n\nGeneric version\n\nFarxiga isn’t available in a generic form. (A generic drug is an exact copy of the active drug in a brand-name medication.) Generics tend to cost less than brand-name drugs.\n\nBefore taking Farxiga, talk with your doctor about your health history. Farxiga may not be right for you if you have certain medical conditions. These include:\n\nSevere kidney disease, including receiving dialysis. Farxiga could worsen kidney damage. If your kidney function worsens during your treatment, your doctor may have you stop taking this drug. Don’t take this medication if you have severe kidney disease or if you’re on dialysis. (Dialysis is a process that’s used to remove extra fluids and waste from your blood when your kidneys can’t do it.)\n\nHistory of pancreatitis (inflammation in your pancreas). Although rare, treatment with Farxiga can cause a serious side effect called ketoacidosis in people with diabetes. With this side effect, you have a high acid level in your blood. If you’ve had pancreatitis in the past, you may have a higher risk for this side effect. Your doctor can help decide if Farxiga is safe for you to take if you’ve had pancreatitis in the past.\n\nPast urinary tract infection (UTI). Taking Farxiga can increase your risk for UTI. In rare cases, these infections can be serious. People with a history of UTIs, especially frequent ones, may have a higher risk for this side effect. Talk with your doctor to determine whether Farxiga is safe for you to take.\n\nHigh cholesterol. Farxiga may increase your cholesterol levels. If you already have high cholesterol, your doctor will likely monitor your cholesterol levels closely during your treatment with this drug.\n\nRisk for dehydration. Farxiga may increase your risk of dehydration (low fluid level). This is the case if you’re age 65 years or older, maintaining a low salt diet, have kidney problems, or are taking drugs to lower your blood pressure. With dehydration, you may feel faint, dizzy, weak, and have low blood pressure, especially when you stand up suddenly. Talk with your doctor about these symptoms. And ask your doctor how much fluid you should drink every day to help avoid dehydration. Before you start taking Farxiga, your doctor may check to make sure your fluid level isn’t too low.\n\nWhen Farxiga is dispensed from the pharmacy, the pharmacist adds an expiration date to the label on the container. This date is typically 1 year from the date the medication was dispensed.\n\nThe expiration date helps guarantee that the medication is effective during this time. The current stance of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is to avoid using expired medications. If you have unused medication that has gone past the expiration date, talk with your pharmacist about whether you might still be able to take it.\n\nStorage\n\nHow long a medication remains safe to take can depend on many factors, including how and where the medication is stored. Farxiga tablets should be stored at a room temperature of 68°F to 77°F (20°C to 25°C).\n\nDisposal\n\nIf you no longer need to take Farxiga and have leftover medication, it’s important to dispose of it safely. This helps prevent others, including children and pets, from taking the drug by accident. It also helps keep the drug from harming the environment.\n\nThis article provides several useful tips on medication disposal. You can also ask your pharmacist for information on how to dispose of your medication.\n\nThe following information is provided for clinicians and other healthcare professionals.\n\nIndications\n\nFarxiga is approved for the following indications in adults:\n\nType 2 diabetes. For this condition, Farxiga is used:\n\nin combination with exercise and diet to improve blood glucose management.\n\nto lower the risk of hospitalization due to heart failure in adults with type 2 diabetes who have existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) or multiple risk factors for CVD.\n\nHeart failure with or without type 2 diabetes. For this condition, Farxiga is indicated to lower the risk of hospitalization and cardiovascular death in adults who have heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF).\n\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) at risk of worsening. For this condition, Farxiga is indicated to lower the risk of:\n\nsustained reduction of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)\n\ncardiovascular death\n\nhospitalization due to heart failure\n\nend-stage renal disease\n\nFarxiga should not be used to treat either type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). It is also not recommended to manage type 2 diabetes in people with a certain reduced eGFR. Additionally, Farxiga should not be used to manage CKD accompanied by polycystic kidney disease or in people who have recently used immunosuppressants for their kidney disease.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nFarxiga blocks the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) in the proximal renal tubules. This prevents reabsorption of filtered glucose from the renal tubules. The result is osmotic diuresis due to excess excretion of urinary glucose.\n\nFarxiga also lowers reabsorption of sodium and increases distal tubular sodium delivery. This likely decreases both cardiac preload and afterload, and reduces sympathetic activity, thus attenuating heart failure symptoms.
