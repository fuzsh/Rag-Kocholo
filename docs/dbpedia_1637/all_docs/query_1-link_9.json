        "text": "\"Jillian Cantor's beautifully written Half Life is a poignant exploration of ambition, family, gender, and love. I couldn't put down this tender, nuanced, and inspiring novel. This is a book for anyone who's ever been torn by conflicting passions and loyalties; in other words, this is a book for all of us. A dazzling must-read.\" -- Jean Kwok, New York Times bestselling author of Searching for Sylvie Lee and Girl in Translation\n\n\"In her riveting new novel, Half Life, Jillian Cantor explores not only the fascinating inner life of the famous scientist Marie Curie but also the life that might have been if she'd chosen love over science in her early years, a determination that would have irrevocably altered the face of science and history. This thoughtful, compelling story delves into issues faced by modern women, while inviting readers to ruminate on their own life choices and the domino-effect of those decisions.\" -- Marie Benedict, New York Times bestselling author of Lady Clementine and The Only Woman in the Room\n\n\"Thought-provoking, skillfully written, and hard to put down.\" -- Kirkus Reviews (starred review)\n\n\"Cantor has created an absorbing biographical novel and performed an engaging riff on the \"what if\" ponderings we all experience.\" -- Booklist\n\n\"In a time when many of us are more tuned in to scientific advances than we've ever been before, this reimagining of what might happen if pioneering scientist Marie Curie had taken a different path is just what the doctor ordered.\" -- Good Housekeeping\n\n\"Cantor's details of language, customs, and how people interact in those times and places are spot on.\" -- Historical Novel Society"
