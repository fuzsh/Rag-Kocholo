        "text": "BASIC PLOT\n\nTo lose one set of memories may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose two smacks of carelessness. The Terran colony world of Espero seems the unlikely source of a sophisticated distress call. And the Doctor, Fitz and Trix are not the only ones responding to it. While Fitz consorts with royalty, the Doctor's on the run with a sixteen year old girl, and Trix meets a small boy with a dark secret. In a race for the minds and souls of an entire planet, the Doctor and Trix are offered temptations that may change them forever. At least one of them will be unable to resist.\n\nDOCTOR\n\nEighth.\n\nCOMPANIONS\n\nFitz and Trix.\n\nMadame Xing is very likely Compassion.\n\nMATERIALISATION CIRCUIT\n\nPg 18 Near some bushes, on the outskirts of the city of Saiarossa, Espero, the future.\n\nPg 150 Inside the barrel room, the cellar of the Imperator palace.\n\nPREPARATORY READING\n\nEscape Velocity, Trading Futures, Sometime Never...\n\nCONTINUITY REFERENCES\n\nPg 5 \"Joshua tipped his head back and stared up at the stars, feeling momentarily dizzy. Which ones had other worlds around them, he wondered. Which ones had other human colonies? Where were Bliss, and Heritage and Availon?\" Heritage.\n\nPg 16 \"At times like these, when the TARDIS wasn't in flight and she was the only one aboard, it was easy to remember what it had been like before: when she'd lived like a mouse in the skirting board, the Doctor, Fitz and Anji knowing nothing of her existence aboard the ship.\" The Infinity Race through to The Last Resort.\n\nPg 17 \"She felt a bit bad for begrudging the Doctor his happiness - particularly after what had happened to Miranda\" Sometime Never...\n\nReference to Anji.\n\nPg 19 \"Something like that ointment he gave to Guy?\" Timeless.\n\nPg 32 \"It reminded him of Venice, a city sliding graciously towards its final end.\" The Stones of Venice.\n\nPg 58 \"Are you aware that your memory has been interfered with on thirty-seven separate occasions - eight of them still outstanding?\" Some of the big ones include the Doctor wiping his own memory in Timewyrm: Genesys, his various post-regenerative amnesias, losing his memory in The Eight Doctors and, of course, in The Ancestor Cell. \"Some of your recent memories have been excised, removed. Not repressed. they are not there to restore.\" The Ancestor Cell.\n\nPg 62 \"- Miranda, falling to her knees at his feet, her whole life racing across her features as the Time Winds tore through her.\"\n\nPg 70 \"Do you have a girlfriend?

Again. I'm not suddenly going to find myself swashbuckling all over the place, and challenging you to a duel for the hand of a fair maiden, am I?\" The Book of the Still\n\nPg 131 \"But don't hang it all on Miranda's death.\" Sometime Never...\n\nPg 138 \"Perrier perhaps. He frowned - the phrase somehow had a resonance, an in-joke that he didn't understand.\" Vengeance on Varos.\n\nPg 151 \"The old girl must have a thing for cellars\" Reckless Engineering.z\n\nPg 154 \"'Snap,' said the Doctor grimly\" The Two Doctors.\n\nPg 172 \"It looked like a tiny, slightly ginger monkey - as if she hadn't had her fill of monkeys and apes recently.\" Timeless, Sometime Never...\n\nPg 175 \"She froze beside a table bearing a particularly piece of crystal in the shape of an eagle (she never wanted to see anything made of crystal ever again!)\" Sometime Never...\n\nPg 185 \"She asked Tannalis what Trove looked like, but the description didn't tally with the Sabbath she'd met.\" Time Zero through to Sometime Never...\n\nPg 192 \"And there had been no announcement that immortality was suddenly on the market, despite the rumours of cloning on Heritage.\" Heritage.\n\nPg 195 \"If that was the case, then how come the Doctor didn't remember blowing up his own planet?\" The Ancestor Cell.\n\n\"Fitz felt a cold shudder run through him as he realised that he didn't remember much about it either.\" Trading Futures.\n\nPg 215 \"'And why does the name \"Maker\" sound so familiar?' A cold shiver stroked his spine. 'They called themselve \"Us\".' The phrase drifted through him like a spirit seeking redemption.\" The Space Age.\n\nPg 225 \"He suddenly remembered playing Super Mario Brothers in a pub in Bradford, back in the eighties\" The Caught on Earth arc.\n\nPg 242 Reference to Anji.\n\nPg 249 \"It brought back memories of Scale's camera obscura and the images it had shown him, the strangers who seemed, somehow, familiar.\" Camera Obscura and the Doctor seeing images of his former selves.\n\nPg 262 Reference to Anji.\n\n\"A long time ago something happened to me. I died. And then I was brought back to life by being recreated. Being remembered.\" Interference part II.\n\nPg 264 \"I got ridden around by a mad old Russian and how much concern do I get shown?\" Emotional Chemistry.\n\nPg 267 \"You weren't expecting that, were you?\" Madame Xing knows the Doctor.

Sometime never..., pages 238-239: Octan is threatening her with the Vortex gun, which will cause the Time Winds to rip through her, but instead she breaks her hourglasses and the moments of her life simply run out.\n\nPg 167 \"Alinti went straight to her room and called up the weather-sat bureau. They were none to pleased to be disturbed\" I wonder if they were none too pleased, as well?\n\nPg 199 \"But as they progressed, the bark on the stems opened up and swallowed them, healing itself over as nothing had happened.\" Surely, this should be \"as though nothing had happened\"?\n\nPg 273 \"She wasn't going soft, she told herself. Yeah, OK - there had been Anji and the lottery ticket.\" Except that Trix's present to Anji in Timeless (pg 272) was a birth certificate and adoption papers for Chloe, whereas she gave the winning lottery ticket to Guy (pg 275).\n\nPLUGGING THE HOLES [Fan-wank theorizing of how to fix continuity cock-ups]\n\nMiranda's death affected the Doctor so intensely that he's conflated it with her possible fate just moments before. It's post-traumatic stress syndrome.\n\nSome of the weather-sat bureau members were quite pleased to be called to duty, others not so much. So there was a range, from none, to pleased.\n\nCalamee's sixteen, so she's trying to be cool in the face of pretty much everything. Thus, she's pretending that nothing happened.\n\nTrix threw a winning lottery ticket into Anji's envelope as well. She really is going soft.\n\nFEATURED ALIEN RACES\n\nPg 1 Insects.\n\nPg 8 Centaur-like aliens, with the body of a thin man and the lower half of a horse, but with legs that splay outwards.\n\nPg 14 Mokeys, creatures similar to small monkeys.\n\nPg 78 Flycams, robot surveillance devices disguised as flies.\n\nPg 92 Night beasts, seven foot tall with huge, muscly arms, a slim waist, sinewy thighs, broad feet, a low head sloping down to its shoulders with no neck, a tiny mouth, piggy wet eyes and covered in a bluish-black substance like fine wire.\n\nPg 186 The Oon, literal aliens who aren't seen (there's a suggestion they may be cities), but their voices are heard here.\n\nPg 198 Maggots and voracious plants that eat them (shown on the cover).\n\nPg 206 A sentient bioship.\n\nPgs 111/114/239 The Makers, Y-shaped things that hang around someone's neck and possess them, eating their personality from inside.
