The study of the positions and aspects of celestial bodies in the belief that they have an influence on the course of natural occurrences and the affairs of individuals. At this point in the fourth millennium, we can see how, throughout the history of the universe, almost all civilisations have at one time or another looked to the stars to find the answers to life, the universe and everything. In Earth history, we can see the influence of the Osirians whose pyramids first appeared in Egypt in about 10,500 BCE (Before Christian Era). These structures were decorated with astral charts that almost certainly first inspired the Egyptians to examine the night sky. Similar influences can be seen in Mayan, Aboriginal and Chinese development to the point where, on three separate continents across one planet, different cultures evolved away from mere sun-worship (such as the cult of Orb, which stretched right back to the development of early man) to the worship of many\n\nsuns. It was the ancient Greeks of Earth who first devised the zodiac system, in which a 'wheel of time' was divided into 12 equal but distinctly different houses, or 'signs' as they became known.The signs were divided alternately into either 'masculine' or 'feminine' depending on their perceived influences upon an individual. In the homeworld's solar system, these signs related to 'planets' in the firmament (which for the Ancients would also include the sun and the moon), with those planets lower in the night sky believed to be 'warmer' and therefore more feminine than the higher, cooler planets, which were masculine. Mercury was the exception, being neutral or hermaphrodite. And just as the movement of these bodies could affect the air and water of Earth, so too could that movement affect a child on the day it is born and thereby shape its personality and likely future. In purely Earth-focused terms, we see the first real challenge to astrology in the rather grandly named 'Age of Reason' in the second millennium of the Christian Era. Here, the establishing sciences took the word 'astronomy' to distance themselves from the 'interminable mumbo jumbo' of the older science. But it was the Great Breakout of the third and early fourth millennia that saw resurgence in the ancient faiths. As colonies broke ties with Earth Central, so their reliance on science began to dwindle and belief in astrology increased exponentially. Though many individuals played their part in the formation of what we now know as `neo-astrology'. One man can be said to have shaped neo-astrology into the form we know today 1\n\nthe astrologist Kasterborus. It was he who first studied the constellations from Earth's position and remapped them according to the layout of the stars in the neighbouring colony clusters (some saw this merely as a way of appeasing pressure groups such as the Sons of Earth). Planets such as Bellicantra, Stella Stora and Japetus quickly adopted Kasterborus's neoastrology as the galactic standard; only a very few planets on the outer reaches refused to give credence to Kasterborus's system, preferring to create their own, principally Chloris, S14 and Levithia. The notoriously superstitious and cautious inhabitants of Gallifrey decided to name one of their constellations after Kasterborus in an all-too-rare display of a sense of humour.\n\n2\n\nThough most of Kasterborus's calculations were destroyed in the horrific fire/ that devastated much of Cyrrhenis Minima's capitol, extensive restoration work on the remaining records show how respectful Kasterborus was towards the fundamental aspects of pure astrology, and how he used his skills not just to foretell the future, but to rewrite the past.The origins of the house of Aries, for example, were already confused before Kasterborus came to them. The Romans believed the ram to have been a manifestation of the Egyptian god Ammon, while for the Greeks it represented the golden ram that lent its fleece to legend. Curiously, in all origins, the ram was sacrificed in honour of the gods themselves; in Kasterborus's version, the ram simply ascended to the firmament without loss of blood.\n\nAries, the first sign of the zodiac, is the element of our personality that governs the 'self This is not to say that those born into this sign are selfish', so much as they are highly aware of their own self-interest. They can be wilful, argumentative, impatient and blunt - all traits governed by the fourth planet out from the nearest star (from the homeworld, this would be Mars, while from Estellios, it is Carval - both planets associated with war). Aries is an impulsive sign, symbolised by the ram... Kasterborus, Our Destiny is in the Stars\n\n3\n\nKasterborus says... If today is your birthday: A meeting of minds is\n\nwell starred today. You may be invited to a party which will give you the chance to bring matters to a head...\n\n4\n\nThe True and Indisputable Facts in the Matter of the Ram's Skull Mark Michalowski This document is reproduced exactly as found. October 2nd, 1849 My first encounter with the gentleman who - for his own purposes of anonymity - preferred to withhold his full name from the company, and wept simply by the sobriquet of 'the Doctor', was scarcely five hours ago; when, at the behest of two other doctors of my acquaintance - Parsons and Wolffson - I had found myself entering the house of a certain Mr R —, a scholar and man of letters of whom I was cognizant but whom, before this very evening, I had not met. On the journey to Mr R —'s house, I attempted to ascertain from the good doctors the purpose of our visit; but both were taciturn in the extreme, impressing upon me that, as a gentleman familiar with the unnatural and the bizarre, I was to be something of a learned witness to to-night's events. Before I could correct their impressions of me, we were at Mr R—'s residence and we alighted from the cab. We were shown into a parlor by a servant who thenceforth made himself absent and I was introduced to our host, Mr R —, a rather unremarkable gentleman, possessed of a pale, insubstantial complexion with thin hair plastered back across his pate, who gave every impression of being of a nervous or hysterical nature - which did not predispose me well to the evening.Also in the room, on chairs and sofas or else standing by the curtained window were a number of other people. The two doctors and I were introduced to the gathered company which struck me as being of a very disparate composition: Miss Allardyce, a stern and somewhat matronly woman, and her young female companion, Abigail (a plump, sullen and charmless girl, possibly only just of marriageable age fourteen years old at the very most); and Colonel Caine, a veritable model of the military classes with a florid complexion and a most pugnacious air about him who, barring his name, had said very little since our arrival, and who was sipping from a glass of cognac, grimacing. But I was most interested in the trio who stood at the window - an elderly gentleman and two younger people, a man and a woman.Although the first seemed comfortable - if somewhat impatient - his companions 5\n\nlooked sadly lost or perhaps just bored. I introduced myself to them - the younger was Mr Ian Chesterton, and his companion (perhaps his fiancee, or perhaps the elderly gentleman's daughter), Miss Barbara Wright. The other gentleman introduced himself simply as the Doctor - which elicited an expression of knowing disbelief from Miss Allardyce. As I asked him how they came to be there, he turned his gaze on me and gripped his lapels in the manner of a school teacher about to embark upon a peremptory lecture. `We received a message from a friend of ours,' he said sharply, eyeing me with a curiosity that was somewhat disquieting. I asked him if we had previously met, but he smiled a most disarming smile and shook his head, saying that although he had not yet had the pleasure, he was fully acquainted with my works. I was on the point of questioning him and of attempting to ascertain further his provenance when Mr R — gave a short cough and we all turned our attentions on him. He was standing in the doorway to the back room, his arms extended to hold out of the way the heavy brocade curtain that covered the door, with the clear implication that the evening was about to begin. The Doctor seemed strangely reluctant to pass through. If I may ask,' he said, addressing Mr R —, 'are we to be informed of the nature of this evening's, ah, entertainment?' At this, Colonel Caine bridled audibly, letting out a disgruntled snort. `Entertainment sir? Entertainment?! I can assure you, this is no evening of \"entertainment\"!' ' My apologies,' replied the Doctor. 'The friend who secured our invitation for the evening was, shall we say, less than forthcoming about the purpose of this gathering. I am merely curious, that is all. ` Miss G— was less than forthcoming,' interjected Mr R —, 'because I have had to be very circumspect in my description of this evening, Doctor. I apologize for what•must seem like excessive secrecy, but what I hope we will achieve here tonight is not something that I would wish to be disseminated to the public at large.' At his words, I felt a cold hand grip my spine, and my eyes darted toward the still closed door to the back room. The Doctor nodded thoughtfully, and, in a silence somewhat thickened by Mr R —'s pronouncement, we all processed through, myself leading the way. The windows had been draped with heavy velvet curtains and a fire that had been burning in the grate had been extinguished, leaving the air smoky and gray.A circular table, topped with a dark baize cloth, filled most of the room, and around it were ranged enough chairs for the gathered company. But what drew my - and, no doubt, the others' - eyes was the object that Mr R had placed in the center of the table, positioned carefully on a small round dais of dark wood. It was a skull - a goat's skull, —\n\n6\n\nI first thought, although Mr R — corrected Mrs Allardyce when she, too, commented on it presently, informing us all that it was the skull of a ram. The bone was a pale and sickly ivory color, bleached and unnaturally clean.The yellowish light from the three wall lamps stationed around the room glimmered softly on it, revealing a sheen that suggested that the skull had been polished - dare I say it, lovingly - over many years. Dark, ribbed horns curved and twisted out from it, their tips resting upon the cloth. Those awful, empty sockets, surrounded by raised ridges of sharp bone, gazed up at us, and even the residual warmth from the extinguished fire was insufficient to keep another sudden chill from clawing at my bones. Inscribed precisely between those sockets, in the flat of the forehead, was a clearly recognizable symbol - a five-pointed star, a pentagram, that most ancient of occult devices. Being the first into the room, I had the opportunity to observe the reactions Doctr of the other participants in tonight's 'entertainment' - as the had put it. The Colonel gave the skull a most cursory glance, and I wondered briefly if perhaps he had seen it before. Indeed, it was possible that he had supplied it to Mr R —. I knew little of the Colonel, although I had heard of him by reputation. He was a stalwart of the Longridge Club where, rumor had it, he often held court at tedious length about his African hunting trips and expeditions to Egypt, so it was quite plausible that this skull had been one of his trophies. His cognac glass still in his hand, the Colonel sat down heavily in one of the chairs as Mrs Allardyce and her ward entered. Whilst Mrs Allardyce seemed clearly disturbed by the animal remains (her hand flew to her mouth in a somewhat parodic gesture at which I had to stifle a laugh!), the child stared at it in what I can only describe as awe. There was certainly something ghoulish in the way she was drawn to it, her chubby fingers pawing at the thick cloth on the table. Mr R— was standing further into the room, watching, with a fascination equal to mine, the reaction of Abigail. Her mouth fell slightly open, her fat, pink lips glistening with saliva as her bright eyes darted around, drinking in every detail of the macabre exhibit She was only cut short by Mrs Allardyce who whispered curtly that it was rude to stare, and pulled her around the table to their seats. Next into the room were the Doctor and his entourage. I noted with interest that whilst Miss Wright and Mr Chesterton were drawn to the table and the skull, exchanging oddly disturbed glances, the Doctor himself seemed more concerned with the environs. He strode silently around, his thumbs tucked into the pockets of his vest, as he examined the dimmed chandelier that hung above the table. I watched him as he took a few steps backward and seemed to be attempting to peer under the table cloth. Then it occurred to me that this Doctor was anticipating 7\n\nsome sort of charlatanism on the part of Mr R — and was searching for signs of whatever artifices he imagined our host was anticipating employing. But when he did, finally, examine the skull and its enscribed symbol, a curious expression crossed his face, as if at the recollection of some dim and distant memory. He tapped his upper lip with his finger and then shook his head sharply before seating himself alongside his companions. Doctors Wolffson and Parsons followed them and exchanged an uncertain look: whether it was an acknowledgement of a shared secret or a shared suspicion, I could not be certain.They joined the other guests at the table, leaving only two chairs - for myself and for Mr R —, who took his place after he had passed around the room dimming the lights and placing a lit candle, ensconced within an elaborate brass candlestick entwined about with ivy leaves, upon the table. In silence, he completed the circle: proceeding clockwise around it - Abigail, Miss Allardyce, Colonel Caine, the Doctor, Miss Wright, myself, Mr Chesterton, Doctor Wolffson, Mr R— and Doctor Parsons. I caught a twinkle in the eyes of the Doctor: 'Very atmospheric lighting,' he commented wryly. 'I take it we are supposed to hold hands?' `Not at all, Doctor,' said Mr R —. 'All that is required is that you keep your attention on the skull on the table.' I smiled to myself at the thought that, at this moment, it seemed unlikely that anyone's attention was anywhere other than the skull. In the dim lamplight, its cavernous sockets seemed to gaze balefully at me, and I wished I had chosen my seat more carefully, so that I should not have fallen under its countenance. `Focusing our psychic energies,' the Doctor murmured thoughtfully although he spoke so quietly that it was possible that I had mis-heard him `Perhaps, Mr R—, this might be a good time to tell us what, exactly, is supposed to happen. Have we come all this way for nothing more than a séance?' Mr R— gave a gentle chuckle. `This is considerably more than just a séance,' he replied. Mrs Allardyce's ward has what I believe is sometimes referred to as \"the gift\", second sight. With her help, we shall bridge the gulf between this plane of existence and the next.' At this, there was an irritated sigh from Mr Chesterton, but Mr R — continued as though he had not heard. 'My intention is that she will discover for us the ultimate secret, revealing to us knowledge that only those who have passed on can know. The ultimate secret, Doctor. Immortality!' Mr R—'s eyes glimmered in the dim light and again I felt a cold hand press against my heart, as though attempting to still its beating. The Doctor's expression remained fixed, although I sensed a certain grimness, 8\n\nas if this were not the first time that he'd been in such a situation. `Then it is a good thing that I am here: he said with an air of finality. The room fell silent again and the other guests turned their attentions back to the skull. As the seconds passed a palpable and altogether unpleasant change came over the room. The air around us, which previously had been still and warm, abruptly dropped in temperature, as if someone had silently thrown open a window.And yet, as far as I could perceive, there was no attendant draft of air, and the pale, oily light from the lamps stayed as hesitantly constant as it had been before. I felt a dryness in my throat as, illuminated from the side, a thick, milky cloud issued forth from Mr Chesterton's mouth. For one moment, I wondered if this was what I had heard referred to as ectoplasm. But, I realized with some relief, it was merely his breath, condensing in the increasing cold. I saw that Mr R— was staring at me, and drew my attention back to the skull. As the seconds ticked by in silence, I'm ashamed to say that I began to feel somewhat disappointed. True, the drop in temperature had been dramatic and unsettling, but since then, nothing had happened. `Should we be thinking any particular thoughts?' came the whispered and, dare I say it, mischievous - sound of the Doctor's voice suddenly, followed by an impatient 'tut' from one of the others - quite possibly the Colonel. `Please Doctor,' said Mr R—. 'If you would be so kind as to keep looking at the -' Mr R— suddenly stopped. Looking back on the moment when his words were cut dead, I can remember nothing other than a vague sense of irritation that he had not finished his utterance. It seems I was, regrettably, the only person to be unaware of the circumstances that had caused him to finish mid-sentence - perhaps due to the fact that, yet again, my attention had wandered from the skull to Mr R— himself, whose eyes were gleaming wetly and maniacally. At his words I followed his gaze back to the skull on the table. At first, I thought that the dim light, the atmosphere - and, perhaps, a degree of Mesmerism - were combining to induce some sort of hallucination; for something most peculiar was happening to the remnants of the unfortunate and long-dead creature before us. In the depths of the shadows that nestled in those dreadful hollows, something moved, a gentle and writhing sinuous motion, as worms rising from damp soil. Each socket seemed possessed of things alive and I heard a gasp from Miss Wright who, from her seat at my side, could clearly see the same things that I could. I broke off from the skull and let my eyes wander across the shadowed faces of the other guests.All but the Doctor - which hardly surprised me - and Abigail were staring fixedly at the skull. She was looking from one to 9\n\nanother of the assembled group, her eyes wide and searching as if looking for some particular reaction, some specific response to the horror unfolding before our eyes. I had a sudden and inexplicable urge to pull away; to stand, bring up the lights and fling wide the curtains. But it was as if the very air had, at that moment, solidified and congealed, holding me in its frigid grasp as it insinuated writhing tendrils of darkness into my marrow. I found I was unable to breathe, my chest bound tightly as though by a huge, unnatural hand and a tingle, as from a galvanic battery, was playing upon my skin. Curiously, I realized that I could smell roses. `Doctor.. ! came a hoarse whisper from Miss Wright. I tried to turn my head but I was held immobile by the force that had taken possession of us. All of us, with the notable and somewhat unnerving exception of Abigail, seemed transfixed. The girl's pale, round face was illuminated by something which appeared to emanate from within her: a paradoxically wan, lambent radiance; and I was brought to mind of a full moon.As I gazed at her, she opened her mouth and a voice that I can only describe as unearthly issued forth, bubbling as though being transmitted through the medium of some viscous, oily fluid. `The door is open,' she said. Her lips twisted into the most horrific parody of a smile that I have ever had the misfortune to see; and the foulness of her visage was compounded by the fact that she was no more than a child; although, at that moment, she had clearly left childish innocence far behind her. `Proceed,' spoke up Mr R—. `No.'his from the Doctor, who, against all the outward indicators of his frailty, had somehow managed to turn his head against the diabolical force which held us. He was staring at the girl, his jaw clenching and unclenching.\"This must stop,' he hissed through gritted teeth:What you're unleashing here is evil. Can't you feel that?' This last phrase was almost grunted, and if I had not previously been convinced of the malevolent provenance of this evening's events, his tone would have most certainly convinced me. Whatever the girl was doing, whatever doorway had been opened, I was in no doubt that what lay beyond it was, more than anything I ever witnessed before, totally and utterly inimical to us all. But my train of thought was curtailed by further changes: a new metamorphosis was overcoming the skull before us.As if, in some bizarre way, we were witnessing the reversal of time, as though the world itself were winding backward, the skull began to clothe itself in flesh. Soft and pallid, the tissue formed on the polished bone, oozing out as a liquid from the surface of the skull.Within those horrible sockets, the wormlike forms continued to writhe, unaffected by the transubstantiation that overtook the rest of the head - for a head is what, by degrees, it was becoming. No longer a naked skull, it now possessed a thick patina of pale flesh, 10\n\nquite unlike any flesh I have seen before. There was no intimation of blood vessels nor musculature, and I began to wonder whether this was merely some stage magic - perhaps a fluid or paste being pumped through the skull from beneath the table. Was that what the Doctor had been searching for? But the fluid did not drip or pool as one might have expected. It followed the contours of the skull, flowing around it and encasing it in a macabre parody of actual flesh. I became aware, for the first time, of a sweet, sickly odor, not unlike that of decomposition, which grew rapidly stronger, mingling with the scent of roses that I had previously noted, until I felt sure that I would be ill. My stomach churned in protest as the stench formed a miasma, thickening and curdling around us. And then, of a sudden, the silence that filled the room was shattered by a gasp from Doctor Wolffson, and we all raised our eyes from the skull. moent He was staring at Mrs Allardyce's girl, across the table from him For a , I was unable to take in what my eyes beheld: my first thoughts were that my own eyesight was impaired or that the breathy clouds issuing forth from the company had obscured my view of the girl. Amidst the grunts and moans of horror, shock and disgust from the other guests seated around the table, I realized that I was not mistaken.As though some sickening exchange were taking place, even as the flesh grew and crept upon the skull of the ram,Abigail's previous round and uncharitable though it may be to say so - fat face was becoming thinner, visibly so, as we watched. Her jaw fell slackly open with a noise like the sound of tearing paper. Her eyes had rolled back in her skull so that only the whites were visible, and from within her dark and now cavernous mouth, a moan the like of which I would never have believed possible issued forth; and, to compound this ghastly sight, somewhere behind her tongue dark and sinuous shapes writhed. I looked down at the ram's head. Now it was fully clothed in pale flesh. Curiously, there was none of the hair that I might have expected; and the eye sockets no longer held those wormlike forms. Instead, a single glossy black sphere filled each cavity, featureless and cold. They were staring at me. My attention was suddenly drawn to the figure of the Doctor, who had placed his hands upon the surface of the table and who was in the process - labored and painful - of levering himself from his seat.The tendons stood out in his neck as he exerted what I imagine must have been an incredible force for a gentleman of his age, in order to extricate himself from the power that held the rest of us as flies trapped in amber. Inch by agonizing inch, as the rest of us looked on, he rose from his seat, shaking and unsteady. Beads of glistening sweat stood out on his pale forehead and I could plainly hear his stertorous breathing. I cast my eyes about the room: 11\n\nthe Colonel wore an expression of utter fear, and I suspected that his adventures had little prepared him for something like this. The doctors Parsons and Wolffson, too, looked on in terror, and I caught Parsons's eye for a moment before he returned his gaze to the skull, unable to turn his head to see Abigail, seated at his side. The girl's face was, by now, little more than the head of a cadaver almost fleshless, the surprisingly sharp cheekbones now protruding from the parchment skin that clung to them, taut and smooth. Her mouth was still open and those worms still crawled within it, flicking around her lips as if tasting the air. Her eye sockets were dark and empty now, and a foul fluid dribbled from the apertures, down over her cheeks like glistening tears of decay. `Do not interfere, old man!' came the rumbling voice from within, and I sensed - as perhaps we all did - that whatever vile abomination had possessed her had realized that its hold was more precarious than it had first believed. If, indeed, this was some demon or spirit from the netherworld, attempting to gain a foothold in our realm, then the Doctor clearly intended to prevent it. With jerky, spastic movements, the Doctor's hand moved across the table to where Colonel Caine had deposited his cognac glass - still, I noted with some grim amusement, half full. In one swift movement, he caught up the glass and threw its contents over the ram's head. `You will not succeed,' the girl said gutturally:My reincarnation is almost complete. In these last words there was a note of triumph which sent my spirits sinking, plummeting away; and, indeed, I wondered how soaking the ram's head in the Colonel's cognac could avail us of aught. To my knowledge, cognac was not one of those substances such as garlic and salt which are said to prove inimical to demonic forms. `The candle, Barbara,' grunted the Doctor, his eyes darting between his companion and the elaborate candle stick, no more than a foot from her hand. To my amazement - and to Miss Wright's great credit - she managed to speak through the tetanus which must surely have gripped her jaw. `I - can't - move.' My heart sank at the helplessness that had descended upon us; and then, to my great surprise, I found a strength within me which I had previously little suspected.As, like a light coming on in my brain, I realized the Doctor's plan, I found myself moving almost without thinking - which perhaps explains my ability to move at all - and threw - no! pushed! - my hand across the table. It contacted with the broad, ivy-wound base of the candlestick, knocking it over. A pale nimbus of blueish light sprang up where the flame made contact with the spilled cognac which, in an instant, raced across the intervening inches to the head and thence 12\n\nengulfed it, wrapping it in a flickering blue corona, curiously more intense than I would have imagined. It was as though, in a manner somehow more symbolic than literal, the flames were driving back whatever demon was attempting to invade this plane.The pressure which had pinned me in my seat lifted and I heard a chorus of sighs and imprecations from around me as the others, likewise, felt themselves released. But amidst those imprecations came a low, animal moan which rapidly built to a shriek.Abigail rose in her seat as if elevated by invisible strings, and we all saw that her face - now little more than a skull beribboned with tattered shreds of purulent flesh - was likewise aflame.Yellow and blue it burned, spitting and sizzling like fax in a frying pan, as the poor, poor girl stood motionless, her mouth wide. The unearthly fire engulfed her head, the hair and lips and eyelids peeling back as they blackened and shriveled and added their substance to the conflagration.And yet - most chilling of all - she made no further movement and no effort to extinguish theflames. Like a wax dummy, she stood rigid as the flames spread rapidly down over her shoulders, igniting her dress; and thence across her chest and down her arms. `In God's name!' cried Doctor Wolffson suddenly, shattering us all from our reveries. He attempted to rush around the table to the girl's aid, hopeless though it seemed. But he was stopped in his passage by the Doctor, who gripped his arm to hold him back. I caught something of a look transpire between them, and Wolffson shrank back, his face clearly betraying his shock at the Doctor's apparent callousness. In a shameful, mutual silence, we watched the still-burning corpse of Mrs Allardyce's ward topple forward onto the table before it rolled aside and thumped, sickeningly, to the floor. On the table, the ram's head, charred and crisped, suddenly burst, spattering us all - and myself in particular - with the foul-smelling flesh that lay beneath the blackened skin. Copious cognac - its connotations did not go unnoticed - was passed amongst the remaining guests as we sat or stood in the dining room. Mr R— had lent me a change of clothing which, despite being somewhat less formal than my own had been, was gratefully received; although I still imagined I could detect the stench of that room and of the skull's vile flesh, clinging to me; and I felt almost disappointed that the heady rose scent that I had previously smelled was no longer in evidence. Miss Allardyce sat, sobbing, in a corner as the Colonel attempted - with little visible success - to comfort her. The Doctor, Miss Wright and Mr Chesterton had abstracted themselves to one corner and were muttering in low, conspiratorial voices. Not so low, however, that I could not hear\n\nChem. 13\n\n'So we came here to watch a young girl die, did we?'This Chesterton. `We came here to prevent... something. Something evil, from gaining a foothold on this world: The Doctor sounded stern, as though repeating a lecture he had given many times before. `But she was just a girl, Doctor,' said Miss Wright, her voice choked with incipient tears. The Doctor nodded sagely. 'A very gifted girl, Barbara. Or a very cursed one.' He gave a sour shake of his head, and for a moment, his eyes caught mine and I looked away. 'If Mr Poe hadn't summoned up, such strength and courage' (I had no doubt this last was for my ears, and I felt strangely grateful and humbled) 'then I imagine that the poor girl's substance would have been used to rebuild the ram.Yes, I imagine that's not far from the truth. The ram - or, at any rate, whatever the ram was to become would have reconstituted itself, acting as a vessel for whatever force was possessing the child' He shook his head ruefully:And, thank goodness, we managed to sever its connection to this plane, to drive it back where it came from: Mr R— had, it seemed, spoken to Mrs Allardyce and although I was not privy to their conversation, it appeared that some agreement had been reached between them regarding the story that they would tell to the police. No doubt some concoction regarding an accident with a candle. But what else, I asked myself, could be said that would not result in our immediate removal to a sanatorium?That we had been party to an attempt to gain the secrets of the dead? That, before our eyes, we had almost witnessed the materialization of some unimagined evil? In numbed silence, we all bade our host goodnight, having made our own compact never to speak of this again. As I stepped out into the cool night air, refreshing after the grim atmosphere within, the Doctor and his companions passed me and bade me a good night. `You have a great talent, Mr Poe,' the Doctor said with a smile. 'One day - I suspect - the world will rate you more highly than you may imagine' He leaned forward as if to shelter his words from other ears. 'But a lighter touch with the prose wouldn't go amiss' He smiled tightly - and, curiously, somewhat sadly - and turned away, leaving me wondering quite what he'd meant. I watched them go, feeling tired and leaden, and then reentered the house to bid my farewells to the Colonel and Mr R — - who expressed his desire that his name (and, oddly, that of Miss G ) be withheld from any account of this evening that I should choose to write up - before I returned to my rooms through the damp October air. I have, it must be noted, often been described as having a 'fevered imagination', but I could not drive from my mind the image of that poor girl, standing before us like some ghastly human torch, whilst the skull 14\n\n•\n\nburned and sizzled on the table in front of us.And had it been the candle's flickering light, or had the pentagram, inscribed upon the skull, glowed momentarily before it had been obscured by its unearthly flesh? So it is done, and I have committed the events of the past few hours to paper. It is past midnight and my story is complete; and yet I continue writing as if, somehow, my continued existence depends upon the incompleteness of my tale. As I penned the final paragraphs of the account above, it seemed that the shadows were gathering around me, waiting for me to finish - perhaps to pass some critical judgment on my story. I would like to believe that it is simply the horror that I have witnessed this evening that causes me to be so afraid of every dark cranny in my room, every movement that I see from the corners of my eyes. I had hoped that the transcribing of my tale would be - what an apposite phrase! - a form of exorcism for the demons that seem to have clung tenaciously to me since I left Mr 11---=s house. But quite to the contrary, it is as if that oppressive, demonic presence is here with me now. And, although I know not for what reason, I am possessed of the unshakeable belief that the shadows around me are pleased - oh, horror! - that I have put down this account. Perhaps, as I have oft times suspected, there are other gateways, other means of egress into our world, of evil. And now that I have thought it, I am sure that I am right; that, simply through the medium of my words, I have somehow accomplished that which Mr R— failed to do; whatever doorway to Hell that the Doctor sealed shut with the burning of the ram's skull has been opened again through the scrawls on the paper before me.About me, the shadows dance and writhe as if in triumph.The door - Lord save us all! - is, once again, open.\n\nAllen Poe was found in the streets of Baltimore, disoriented and Edgar ill, on the afternoon of October 3rd, 1849, and taken to the Washington College Hospital where he died on October 7th. The cause of death still remains a mystery, although the Baltimore Clipper described it as 'congestion of the brain. Following Poe's burial, a mysterious stranger - still unidentified - visited his grave and left a bunch of roses and a bottle of cognac. This document appears to be the last thing Poe ever wrote.\n\n15\n\nThe connection of this sign to bulls originally came from another Greek legend regarding Zeus's seduction of Europa, where he took the form of a beautiful white bull before kidnapping her and taking her to Crete where she bore him three sons. Kasterborus would appear to have confused this legend with another - that of the Minotaur - and tried to find its closest counterpart in galactic folklore to form his neo-taurean history. Here we see Kasterborus trying too hard to adapt his studies to match contemporary circumstances. Many of his critics additionally felt that his rewriting of the sign of Taurus was crossing too far over into the realm of creative writing, particularly in the way he as good as accuses Taureans of being murderers and thieves to a man (It's long been suspected that Kasterborus was simply having a dig at his publisher, a Taurean, for rejecting his discourse on how credit cards can be used instead of the traditional tarot deck.) We'll skip that passage... ...the Great Journey of Life takes on added significance for those born under the sign of Taurus. Just as the plagues of Nimons devastated empires, so too the style and wit of those born under the sign of the bull can be devastating. And like the Nimons, Taureans can often be said to be acquisitive, wanting the luxuries of life and obsessing over them instead of the necessities or mundanities. Taureans have a natural sense for the finer things in life and actively seek them out for both themselves and their loved ones. For Taureans may be stubborn, but this is also their most positive attribute as they make the most loyal of friends, so long as their friends do not try to offer unsolicited advice advice which will remain unheeded... Kasterborus, Our Destiny is in the Stars 17\n\nKasterborus says... If today is your birthday: Things are never as bad as they seem. Today is not the day to push yourself too far. Take things easy and everything will work out fine.\n\n18\n\nGrowing Higher Paul Leonard In his dreams, he flew above the mountains. Pale blue in the earthlight, they seemed to heave below him, like the ghost of an ocean. He could feel sickness rising in his stomach, but there was no end to the waves: the crests piled up ahead of him, each layer higher than the last, until they were a vertical shield, blinding silver under the midday sun. The suit rushed him on towards the light; but he got no closer to it. Air alarms shrieked. Red lights blinked in the visor, and his brain became thick from lack of oxygen. But *still he was getting no closer. In the surface below, white cracks opened, like an eggshell breaking from inside - and the fire was, streaming in... Sewa Singh awoke, shaking and sweating, and instantly remembered where he was and why he had dreamed that particular dream. They would be here today, almost for certain. He sat up, letting the sheet fall, and examined the black hairs that were turning to grey on his chest. Eighty-two years. His great-great-grandfather wouldn't have considered it a bad span of life, he thought bitterly. He swung out of the bed, slowly so as to avoid disturbing the young woman sleeping next to him. The air was warm and the carpet was soft on his feet. He padded through the half-darkness towards the shadow of an ebony cabinet, opened a small drawer and took out a golden control bracelet.Tiny keys glowed in the dark, made from emerald, lilac amethyst, ruby, sapphire, diamond.They no longer controlled anything; the bracelet had been off line for forty years. Primitive, he thought. Like me. But he put It on his right wrist anyway. Pushing aside the silk curtains of the doorway, he stepped up into the mainroom.The sudden steely light sent stabs of pain through his eyes. He blinked, put out an arm to lean on the doorway, looked around. Black and silver stools were scattered like tall spiders across the moondust-coloured carpet. In their midst crouched a low table topped in white Imbrian stone. Beyond, the room curved gently away to the kitchen, a pattern of grey squares and green vines. The shape of the room was intended to imitate the torus in an orbit station. The style had been fashionable half a century ago when the unit had been built. Singh had always meant to do some alterations, bring it up to date a bit. Well, it was too late to worry about that now. `The possessions of the deceased, Sewa Singh, were sold at auction today...' he muttered, and wondered where he'd left the whisky bottle. A floor-to-ceiling screen on the outer wall, several metres long, was set 19\n\nup as a false window. Presently it was showing the view above on the Surface, a flat landscape with a short horizon. The lunar rock glared like concrete in the noon sun. Metal rails ran across the ground, surrounded by dull orange coil guides. A couple of black slits near the horizon indicated the sites of landing ports. Nothing moved. Four months ago (a time of innocence, Singh thought), silver packages had rushed along those rails, red lights flickering as the cargoes accelerated towards orbital velocity. Trolleys loaded with grit had rolled up to the dumps. Shuttles had grumbled in and out of the ports every minute, sending a deep, soothing vibration through the floor of the apartments. Singh had liked that sound: in his more fanciful moments he had used to think of it as a heartbeat, a living beat, as if the Port, the Base, the entire mine System with all its machinery was part of a living animal. And he had watched the lines of redlit cargoes receding and seen arteries pulsing with red blood, moving the digested substance of the Moon to other parts of the body of the human race, where they would be built into new, living worlds... It occurred to him that he ought to ask. `System,' he commanded. The house system indicated that it was ready, by means of a small chime. Any flights due in?' A list appeared on the inner wallscreen: there were four entries.At the head of the list was the UN Administrative Support Ship Diversity 'Special Run', due in at 0715. Ten minutes. `Passenger list, number one,' he rapped out. There was a slight pause - a security check? - before the screen responded. Akimboola, Joshu, Dr. UN Peace Corps, Senior Officer. Cleomides,Aristo. UN Peace Corps, Sergeant. Singh felt his stomach heave.They were really coming. He really would be taken to Earth, put on trial. Certainly he would be found guilty Given `socially useful work' to do. Planting trees. Helping the irreversibly senile to use the lavatory. Burying the dead. And, whatever he did, in Earth's crushing gravity he would age. Muscles would lose their tone, cells would die, irreversible decay would occur in his own blood vessels and neural tissues. It was something that he had come to think would never happen to him. He'd had a good job, and plenty of money. Antisenility drugs, 20\n\nreplacement organs, low gravity - perhaps he would last until the day when people started to live for ever. But not now. Now Sewa Singh was going to die, like all the rest of them. He fingered the golden control bracelet, watched a date form in ruby letters on the gold. `Four months...' he muttered. Four months ago, he had been facing this same inner screen, confirming costs with a client in Osaka, when the news had come. There had been a world called Kuppam, newly built by the Yamoyata Company in high Earth orbit. It had been the largest, newest and best of its kind: the flagship of the makers.A steel and glass spheroid almost thirty kilometres across, filled, with air and light, had rotated rapidly in order to generate a lunar-like `gravity'. Inside there had been woodlands, hills, rivers, bridges, small towns with open-plan houses.Thousands of people had come to live there, to escape the heavy, dusty, corrupted Earth. On the outside of Kuppam, in order to protect the delicate lifeshell froth radiation and meteoroids, there had been a stationary casing of lunar rock. The junctions between the moving and the static shells had been supported by light-alloy bearings. Four months ago the supposedly impossible had happened: one of these bearings had sheared. That on its own would not have been serious, since the system was partially redundant, but within ninety seconds a second bearing had failed, and then a third.The inner shell had toppled wildly, slamming into the casing and breaching in several places.Air had rushed out, laden with fragments, widening the breaches. Within a few minutes the shell had disintegrated. Fifty thousand, five hundred and ninety-five people had died. Sewa Singh had been the person responsible for the quality of the lightalloy used in the failed bearings. 'I see we'll have visitors soon: Singh jumped at the voice, looked up and saw that the girl had come into the room and was looking at the inner screen. She had washed and patterned: a wide stripe of purple decorated with silver stars ran across her black skin from shoulder to hip, and a light jasmine scent filled the air. Before he could speak she had crossed the room, pulled open a wallset, picked out a metal bowl and a wooden scoop. `Perhaps I'd better make them some breakfast,' she commented. Singh opened his mouth but it took a few seconds for him to make any words. `They're coming to arrest me - take me away for ever - destroy my life - and you want to cook a meal for them?' He tried to laugh, but could only make a kind of choking sound. She glanced at him. `I'm quite serious.' From another wallset, she scooped out oats, soft lentils, dried apricots, and began to mix them in the bowl. 'If we all eat together, it will reduce the tension between us.' 21\n\nSingh felt sick. She was nineteen. But even at that age, surely she knew? \"This isn't a quarrel at a children's party, Bernadette. Psycho-social techniques from Copernicus College aren't going to do any good in this situation. Perhaps you should go: She took the bowl to the sink, filled it with water, placed it on a hotspot on the grey-topped hob, fitted the lid into place. Then said, as she scrabbled in the wallset for cutlery, 'You'd better wash and dress.' He watched her for a moment, as she walked past him with her arms full of wooden bowls and metal spoons, laid the table two-handed, fetched glasses and a jug of lemon juice.The movements of her swift young body were as implacable as steel. `Go and wash,' she repeated levelly, when he just stood there. He turned slowly, walked back towards the bedroom. Bernadette Faraddin watched the man leave the room from the corner of her eye, then linked the electronic part of her brain to the house cameras to follow his progress. She saw him walk into the poolroom, toe the scented water, felt him key an instruction to the system.The Jacuzzi began to whirl. Meanwhile Singh crossed the green tiles to the lavatory and urinated. Bernadette grinned. Obviously he didn't think she was watching him He often forgot about the capabilities of her implants. It was an old person's mental stiffness, she thought.At times it was hard to believe that Sewa Singh was eighty-two, with his childish jokes, his temper, his party nights, his wild-bull lovemaking. But then - at other times... She'd once suggested that he have an implant fitted for himself. His reaction had amazed her: he'd almost exploded with anger, his eyes popping from their sockets. 'Bloody hell Bernadette! I'm not having a machine doing my brain's job for it! I want to stay alive - I, not some bloody computer!' He had rarely mentioned the Kuppam disaster to her. He had attended Company hearings, she knew, and one infamous press conference. But all he would say in private was, 'There is nothing to be done. I am a lamb to their slaughter.' Bernadette had made her own plans, nonetheless. She switched off her link, turned to the hob, sniffed at the vapour that was rising from the hotpot. Vegetal, but a little bland: it needed spice, she decided. She walked past the machinery of the kitchen, following the curve of the room to an area thick with plants. Some of them had been here when she arrived - decorative things like damsel roses, silverbells, blood orchids, blue ferns - but she had brought others, mostly herbs in pots, from her student's digs at Copernicus. The plants wove in and 22\n\naround each other in the broad shafts of piped sunlight, growing higher than they ever would on Earth. Bernadette set about gathering what she needed. Parsley, lemon verbena, stick bay, gingerleaf - she balanced the flavours in her mind, watched the predictive pH traces on her visual cortex display, imagined likely reactions and possible side products. Infographics and schematics of chain polymers filled her eyes. For a moment she was back at school, learning the basic uses of her implant's encyclopaedic access states. Even the many angled sunlight was the same, the smell of green, the humidity. Slowly, she relaxed. When she returned to the mainroom she found Singh standing by the table, wearing a strong spicy scent and a neck-to-ankle pattern of primrose yellow decorated with grey crescents. She put her bundle of leaves down on the hob, smiled at him. `I've picked these to flavour the breakfast: He stared at her as if she were a stranger, a thief broken into his apartment. She realised that there was a tumbler in his hand, and that part of the scent about him was whisky. `I'm trying to help,' she said uncertainly. He turned away, refilled his tumbler from a decanter on the table. Took several swallows. His voice was slurred when he spoke. `I've just seen their ship come in. It was beautiful, you know, just beautiful. Like a seed: a silver seed drifting down to Earth - to the Moon, I mean - to bury itself in the soil and reproduce: He laughed, banged the palm of his free hand down on the table, turned and winked at her. 'Don't worry Bernadette, I'm not drunk. I won't spoil the party. I'm just overcome with emotion at the prospects for my wonderful future: She walked up to him, making an effort to write a smile on her face, searching her memories, onboard and remote, in search of the best thing to say. `SYSTEM!' bawled Singh. Bernadette jumped: stress readouts blinked in the corners of her eyes. `SYSTEM!' He bawled it again, without giving the machine a chance to respond. There was a huge physical anger in his voice. He caught Bernadette's arm, gripped it so tightly that the bone hurt. The system chimed. `I want to see a tiger. Sabre. At Khadri: Singh's breath came in rapid snorts. His grip on Bernadette's arm tightened further, so that columns of red damage-report readouts on her display added themselves to the whining nerves: she shut off both, so that she could concentrate. In front of them, the wallscreen had become a window on Khadri, the orbital tiger reserve. Moist green leaves hung over dark soil. To the left, 23\n\napparently behind the kitchen, was a still white pool.The scene was threedimensional, the illusion so complete that the soil looked only a small step down from the carpet. After a few seconds there was a faint rustling, a whisper of breath, a sense of presence... A tiger stepped out from the foliage. He walked past them without pausing, so close that Bernadette could feel the heat radiating from his body. When he reached the pool he stopped, sniffed the air, looked over his shoulder. His eyes were enormous, water-green, aware. Bernadette's stomach tightened. `He knows we're watching, doesn't he?' she whispered. But Singh still ignored her. He stared without a blink into the animal's eyes.After a while he said in a soft voice, `Ah, that's my tiger.' With a grunt, the tiger turned to drink from the pool, and Singh told the screen to revert. He released her arm, muttering, 'Sorry Bernadette: He fiddled with a gold bracelet on his wrist. The device beeped faintly, like a tiny metal animal lost in a maze. Singh turned and looked at her, his eyes solemn `I'm going to take a final look at the surface,' he said. 'If our visitors should arrive, give them some breakfast and tell them I will be back soon.' He carefully placed his half-empty tumbler in the centre of the table and strode out through the doorway leading to the airlock. Bernadette stared at the grey curtain swinging behind him, listened to the clicks and hisses as he suited up. She was glad he was going out: if he stayed away until after the UN people had arrived, it would make it easier to do what she had in mind. For a moment she did think he might be trying to escape, but then dismissed the notion as ridiculous. He couldn't make a move without their knowing it. If he tried to take a shuttle, or even a buggy, the base System would have instructions to refuse it clearance.A picture came into her head: Singh walking across the mountains in his old red Aztex suit, destination unknown, the true twentieth-century science-fiction hero. She grinned. Singh had been gone less than five minutes when they arrived. Bernadette ran down the stone stairs leading from the mainroom to the street door, arriving just as it opened. Two figures stood there, wearing white earth suits with blue armbands and blue UN badges on the lapels. Behind them, the wide street was crowded: Moon people in patterns and dayskirts, Earth reporters in thick, dull-coloured clothing. Flycameras buzzed and clattered around the lemon trees, their long snouts pointing, lenses dark. `Ms... Faraddin?' She focused on the speaker: a young man. light brown hair, a smile, eyes that fixed on hers with a mixture of firmness and compassion that she 24\n\nimmediately found irritating. 'I am the -' He broke off, made an awkward grin. 'Dr John Smith, of the UN Peace Corps.This is my Sergeant, Fitz Kreiner. May we come in?' She stepped aside. 'We thought you might be here soon. She paused, smiled. `I have some breakfast for you, in case you weren't able to eat on the ship. `That would be kind,' said Smith at once. 'Thank you.' He didn't seem surprised, which Bernadette had somehow expected him to be. In the mainroom, Bernadette gestured the two men to sit at the table. Smith sat down with his back to the kitchen, moving with the easy grace of one long used to many kinds of gravity. Kreiner, seemingly curious, walked over to the main wallscreen, and peered out at the motionless landscape. Looking at the Sergeant for the first time, Bernadette saw that he was pasty skinned and puffy faced, with a typical Earth person's heavfness of build. Unlike Smith, he moved awkwardly in the light gravity: when he sat down he grasped at the edge of the table while he pulled up his stool, as if he were still in freefall and expected to float away. Obviously he was new to space. Bernadette wondered if that fact might be useful. She turned to the kitchen, signalled open a valve on the cooking pot.A Jet of hot steam rushed out, smelling of bay and ginger.There was a robot hot-hand mounted on the oven; she linked to it, bent it down to remove the pressure lid, waited for the steam to clear, then released the link, took the wooden handles of the pot in her own hands and carried it to the table.The aromatic steam rose in front of her eyes as she walked: beads of condensation tickled on her nose and chin. Smith spoke. Mr Singh is out, then?' Bernadette nodded. 'He said he wouldn't be long. He wants to have a last look at the surface.' `Of course,' said Smith. 'We quite understand.' Kreiner gave his superior a swift glance, as if he were puzzled by this exchange. Bernadette wondered if there was some sort of disagreement between them on policy. If so, that might be useful too. The proper etiquette was to serve the older man's portion first. She spooned the sticky green mash into Smith's bowl; he held it still for her whilst she did so. Looking down at his face, she noticed that he was wearing a discreet blue eyeshadow of the kind that had been fashionable for men about ten years ago. Obviously he liked the effect: Bernadette decided that she liked it too.And its very out-of-dateness made him seem less official, more human and accessible. She smiled at him. Turning to Kreiner, she spooned out his portion. He didn't hold the bowl for her, continued staring out of the wallscreen. 25\n\nStill, thought Bernadette, I'd better try to relate to him. `You are from Europe, Mr Kreiner?' 'Er - yes. Umm - England, despite the name. My father's family were German' He seemed embarrassed, as if he were trying to hide something. Bernadette wondered what his instructions were, in case of resistance. She glanced at Smith, but there were no clues in his face, only that vague, compassionate, irritating smile. She watched as he took a mouthful of the food, chewed and swallowed, nodded approvingly. The herbs are fresh?' `Froin the garden? She indicated the tangled greenery, just visible around the curve of the kitchen. He smiled. 'A very civilised way of living' Bernadette grinned to herself. She decided that now was as good a time as any to start the action. `Will the trial be on Station?' she began, addressing the remark to Smith He flicked his eyes up to hers, and down again to the table. `On Earth: `The gravity will be difficult for Sewa and ine: She didn't stress the 'and me'. 'Let the other person feel their own surprise' - she could almost hear her Psycho-Soc tutor speaking. But to her disappointment, Smith showed no sign of being surprised. `We will provide a support suit for each of you, and time to acclimatise. And the necessary permits for you to travel with Mr Singh will be no difficulty in the circumstances.' From the corner of her eye, she noticed a puzzled expression flicker across Kreiner's features, though his gaze never turned from the window. Good. She had surprised him, at least. She took a sip of lemon juice. `Even with a support suit, the gravity could kill Sewa within a few inonths' She kept her voice calm and level, made eye contact (`maximum influence that way'). 'Isn't it possible to have him tried here on the Moon - and punished, if he has to be, up here too? Wouldn't it be easier for everyone?' She waited, but Smith only chewed stolidly. `It can't be done,' said Kreiner, turning to face her for the first time. `The Earth people want to see him tried on Earth. Lunar colonists have been getting away with too much. Going too fast' He put a knuckle to his mouth for an instant, glanced up at Smith. 'That's just a personal opinion of course. Not even mine, really. Certainly not an official one.' Bernadette looked from one to the other of thein, Smith eating, Kreiner playing with his food, both of them avoiding her eyes. She wondered if they knew something about what was being planned. Well, now was the time to find out. `There are friends of mine at Copernicus -' she mentioned some names, 26\n\nsenior Tutors, SystemOps, academics - 'who think that the Moon should be allowed her own jurisdiction in this case, rather than following the conventional UN process. They've formed a committee -' Kreiner interrupted her. `Which way did Singh go?' She frowned at the Sergeant, irritated. `I don't know. West, I should think.' `Can you make this thing look west?' He gestured at the wallscreen. She did so, using her link, without a word.The new view showed square stacks of cold furnaces, white gaping quarries surrounded by rubbleheaps, and, behind, the smooth domes of the eviscerated mountains.There was no movement. Kreiner got up and stood by the screen, leaning forward and peering out of it as if it were a glass window, in the way Earth people always did. Bernadette noticed that he had hardly touched his food. Did he think that, despite everything, Singh might try to run away? If so, how would looking out of the window help? Bernadette decided he couldn't be very bright. She turned back to Smith. `Our committee feel that this is a show trial, that Earth just needs a scapegoat for a disaster that wasn't really anyone's fault. In this they represent a strong current of feeling amongst lunar citizens. If the UN insists on the policy that you have indicated, then it could have major consequences in political terms.' She hesitated. 'There's serious talk of independence: Then, without giving them a chance to take that in: 'I personally will accompany Sewa throughout the trial, and any punishment that is allotted to him, and will maintain liaison for publicity purposes with -' She broke off as her link sent an urgent signal buzzing through her nerves. She blinked, brought up the NewsScreen in her mind. UN Cops at Copernicus Port - \"Singh must pay for Lunar Crime\"\n\nJoshu Akimboola and Aristo Cleomides have arrived at Copernicus port with permits for the arrest of Sewa Singh. More>>> Bernadette didn't need \"more\". She glared at Smith. `Okay, Mr Akimboola and Mr Cleomides. Why have you given false names?' `Not false,' said Kreiner. Smith looked down at his food, embarrassed. 'You see, we're not strictly the right people.Akimboola and Cleomides have just arrived.' `So who are you? Why are there two sets of officers here? I can tell you 27\n\nnow that deception by UN Officers will be taken very seriously by iny friends.The Lunar Committee will not -' She stopped. Smith and Kreiner had exchanged a glance across the table, and something in that glance had made her shiver. Without conscious thought, she linked her eyes to the camera in the airlock. Singh's red Aztex suit was missing from the rack. She counted the foil-packed air bottles on the floor beneath, and looked in the dusty outer chamber to check that the emergency unit was still there. Yes. He'd only taken the suit. Half an hour's air. He'd been gone thirty-five minutes. She linked in to Base Traffic, checked for his suit tracer. It wasn't logged. The electronic part of her mind seemed to act on its own. With frightening speed, she had accessed the Base System.An overview of the area around the base appeared. Beacons were green; radar blind spots were shadows. A broad blue shield, spreading like a flood over the landscape, indicated the places Singh could have reached in a light suit in the time available.There were three places where the blue and the radar shadow overlapped. She logged the coordinates, felt her way through the smooth interface of Emergency Shuttle Dispatch, at the same time connected to manual BaseCom to obtain the necessary authority... `Wait. Smith's voice, and a stop message appeared on her display, too, in pulsing blue with the tag 'UN/AUTH'. `There is something that I need to tell you.' Smith went on, speaking slowly, carefully. 'Shortly after we arrived at the port, I had a conversation with Mr Singh. He stated that, rather than face the trial, and the slow death from senility that would probably follow, he would prefer to take his own life now, with dignity. I indicated that we would not stand in his way.' Bernadette stared at Smith for a moment, then stood up. She was oddly conscious of the fact that she felt nothing of the things she should feel fear, anger, desperation - only the necessities of the moment. `You can't stop me from trying to save him,' she said. 'There's still time.' And she already had the line open to the duty officer at BaseCom. Smith went on eating, placidly enough, but Bernadette found that her communications were cut. `Mr Singh also specifically requested me -' he paused, blinked once; Bernadette had the curious impression that he was trying to stop himself from crying - `to ensure that you did not interfere with his wishes.' Bernadette shouted, 'He wanted you to let him die? You expect me to believe that? You think that anyone will believe it?' Smith gave a shrug. `I don't know. It's what happened. It's better than what Akimboola and Cleomides had planned - for him, and for all of you' He looked up, met her eyes. `I know how angry you are, and how inuch grief you're going to 28\n\nfeel, and how justified some of your friends' complaints against Earth are. But remember, no human being has been killed in war for eighty-seven years.You can't let it start again now.' The BaseCom display faded. Bernadette became aware of Singh's whisky glass, still standing on the table, incongruous in the middle of breakfast. She sat down, feeling heavy, as if she were in a shuttle at takeoff. 'He wasn't a criminal. Her jaw felt heavy, too, as she spoke. Stiff.A unit of machinery that needed greasing. 'He was just a romantic. A careless fool. He wanted to live - for ever. He wanted everyone to live for ever. Growing higher. Growing up to be gods: She looked up at the older man. 'Is that where you think we're going, Dr Smith? Or aren't we going anywhere? I mean, what's the point in going anywhere if there isn't - if he isn't - if there's no spirit left in us -' She wasn't crying. She wanted to, but she wasn't crying. Smith reached out and laid a hand on her arm, just below the place where Singh had bruised it. His touch was gentle, sexless. 'You are young,' he said, And from what I hear about the new treatments that are available now, it seems likely that you will be young for a very long time: He let go his hand. 'It remains to be seen what price you will pay for that.' He stood and joined Kreiner at the screen. Bernadette swallowed, got up, gathered the empty bowls. Her legs felt weak, as if Earth's huge gravity had reached out and was pulling her down. She carried the bowls and the glasses across to the kitchen, placed them in a steel basin on the worktop, lowered the grey ceramic lid.There was a hissing sound, and a thin trail of steam emerged from a vent. She watched it for a moinent, then went and stood behind the others, staring over their shoulders at the empty horizon. At last Kreiner spoke. 'How much air did he have in that suit?'\n\n29\n\nSceptics of neo-astrology generally focused on one single aspect - that many noted astrologers continued to discuss prophecies in terms of the constellations visible froin the old homeworld, Earth. Such patterns in the stars could not be said to have the same influence upon individuals if that individual was living many light years from the point where, say,Aquarius was once visible. For Gemini, Kasterborus had the double challenge of taking into account twin constellations. In mythology the twins themselves were Castor and Pollux, favoured mortals of Zeus who, as members of the Argonauts, had helped Jason rescue the Golden Fleece (see Aries). Killed in battle with their cousins, the Leucippidae, the twins were taken by Zeus and placed for eternity in the heavens as the twin stars that still bear their name The Gemini is in fact two signs in one: a reflective, introspective side tbat constantly questions the self; and the extrovert, the achiever, the persuader. Many Geminis use their extrovert side as a mask, hiding behind their louder personality to prevent others from seeing their true self This aspect often makes them extremely competitive, always wanting to win, always needing to have the last word in every discussion. Their ruling planet is Mercury, regardless of whichever solar system the individual is born into. Kasterborus, Our Destiny is in the Stars\n\n31\n\nKasterborus says... If today is your birthday: Check travel arrangements carefully before setting of on any long trips.And remember - you can have too much of a good thing.\n\n32\n\nTwin Piques Anthony Keetch The Doctor beamed as he was carried along on the shoulders of the cheering crowd, ticker tape stranded in his mop of hair, confetti staining his collar like paper dandruff. Jamie, a pretty girl on each arm, was surfing the front of the joyous crowd on foot. He too had been held aloft initially, but a kilt/breeze situation had made this unwise, so there had been a mutual decision for the Scottish lad to walk. Whatever, his smile threatened to split his face in two. King Gavin XXIII, flanked by his majestic retinue of impossibly butch guards, stood at the door of the TARDIS, an expression of dignified pleasure on his handsome face. He was a middle-aged man, tall, broad of shoulder, clean-shaven, with a jaw that implied a man who would brook no dissent, rather belied by the twinkle in his eye. As his subjects marched the time travellers to the idyllic copse lined with aromatic lilac-leaved trees where the TARDIS had landed, the guards leaped to attention, and King Gavin strode forward to meet the excited crowd. The Doctor was gently lowered to the ground, and the two giggling girls tugged Jamie out of the throng. 'Father!' Japonica squealed and kissed the King. 'Order him to stay!' Corianda pleaded. 'Please!' Gavin siniled at his daughters, then took the hands of the Doctor and Jamie and held them\n\nhigh.\n\nThe King turned to face the crowd who fell immediately and respectfully silent. 'My people!' he boomed.`Today has been the greatest day in our history. And we owe it all to our two friends here!' And the crowd bellowed its approval. `Without their intervention and courage and sense of justice, iny evil brother Conrad would be your king. A hiss like a perforated zeppelin leaked from the crowd. His daughters clung to their father, as though their wicked uncle could snatch them away any minute. 'May the whiskers of his moustache curl up with shame and fall from his chin!' bellowed one old woman. The crowd concurred, quite noisily. They didn't like Conrad's moustache, it was yet another example of the pretender's narcissism. King Gavin stroked his own baby-smooth upper lip, and with a raised hand and a barely concealed grin, quietened his subjects. 'And along with the calamity of my brother's crowning would have come slavery, poverty, and rank cruelty. But fear no longer. He is 33\n\nvanquished and locked away for ever in the Tower of Judgement.' As one, the crowd's heads swivelled to glance fearfully at the distant sight of the black spire, a baleful scar on the horizon. 'I know,' yelled one man in the crowd. 'Let us build a giant statue of our beloved King, to block out the view of the Tower and its malevolent occupant.' The crowd considered. Nice idea, they thought, but was it too toadying? Gavin was known to be rather disparaging of sycophancy. Everyone glanced at the King. `Well,' he pronounced. 'I can't stop you...' `It's nice to be appreciated, eh, Doctor?' The Doctor danced around the TARDIS console, flicking at the switches with even more brio than usual. 'Oh yes, Jamie. Not that we do what we do for the kudos, mind you.' \"Course not; Jamie snorted. The Doctor's hair twitched. But I think a rare moment of smugness isn't too unreasonable: Jamie preened:Aye, it made a nice change to receive a hero's send-off as opposed the usual skulking away while no one was looking.And do you realise that is the only planet I have ever visited where I didn't get locked up or shot at or knocked unconscious?' The Doctor looked up from his finger work. 'Yes,' he said thoughtfully, `a remarkably civilised world. Lovely weather too. Only rained at night, just like Camelot. And with that rogue of a brother out of the way, they can get on with their lives' `That Gavin was a nice fellow. For a king' 'Charming!' The Doctor glanced mischievously at Jamie. And as for the princesses...' Jamie's cheeks burned cerise and he decided that his dirk needed urgent polishing. Then with the sound of a million elephants clearing their throats, the TARDIS shuddered to a halt. The Doctor peered out of the TARDIS - and his jaw dropped. Jamie!' he called. 'Come and take a look' Jamie's chin joined the Doctor's on the ground. Blue skies, a warm sun with a deliciously cooling breeze, air like vintage wine. `But we haven'ae gone anywhere: `Well,' the Doctor's bow tie drooped in puzzlement,`I rather suspect we must have travelled in time somewhat. It would have taken longer than we have been in flight to disperse that crowd' 34\n\n`So we've gone into their future?' `Or the past.' The Doctor shut and locked the TARDIS door. 'Let's find out, shall we?' 'So now we know we've moved forward in time.' They stared at the colossal statue which had been implausibly elevated since their departure a few minutes ago. 'Quite a feat of artistic engineering,' the Doctor said admiringly:I'm not sure if I approve of such idolatry, but... Jamie clutched the Doctor's sleeve. 'But look at the face!' he gasped. The Doctor examined the head of the statue. It was a remarkable likeness, he had to admit, albeit a tad too sentimental for his taste.The jaw, the mane of hair, the moustache... Four eyebrows whizzed heavenwards. 'But...' gasped Jamie. 'Something must have happened after we left. Conrad must have escaped from the tower, overpowered Gavin, and usurped the throne.' And the statue?' asked Jamie. 'I suspect that it was not the labour of love it was intended to be. Look!' The Doctor pointed to the horizon. And the Tower of Judgement.' The once imposing structure had flopped to the ground, its crumbled base the only reminder of its previous dominance of the landscape. `Doctor! Doctor!' A chubby man ran towards them, his ragged breath at odds with the look of delight on his face. 'It's Ernst!' the Doctor exclaimed. 'He's got awfu' old: Jamie pointed out. `Jamie, one streak of grey does not imply decrepitude: Ernst gave the Doctor a kiss on both cheeks, then before the Scots lad could duck, did the same to Jamie. 'Shall I be mother?' Ernst had bustled the frantic pair to his beautiful cottage, with its thatched roof and crooked chimney out of which spiralled a twist of smoke.A fussy little man, locked owlishly behind inch-thick spectacles, he had made them so welcome that they were quite exhausted by the attention. Jamie and the Doctor sat on a blissfully comfy sofa, their dangling legs not quite reaching the floor. Ernst dished out mugs of steaming liquid and slabs of cake. 'It is lovely to see you again, he said:You haven't changed a bit, either of you. Still showing off those lovely lallies, Jamie?' Jamie nodded, mouth chock-a-block, not really sure what he had just been asked:Geffre will be 35\n\nhome from work soon. He's in the Treasury now Privy-Secretary or something, I dunno. Better than cleaning the privvies, I always say. You remember my friend Geffre?' `Of course,' spluttered the Doctor, cake spraying over the immediate vicinity. 'Without the pair of you, it would have been impossible to knock the resistance movement into any sort of shape. Your world owes you both a great deal.' Ernst blushed. The Doctor leaned forward. 'But what happened?' he inquired gently. Ernst looked confused. 'When?' He nibbled at his sliver of cake. `Since we left,' said Jamie. `Which was how long ago exactly?' asked the Doctor. Ernst did the numbers on his fingers:Just over ten years' And how did Conrad become king, exactly?' Ernst boggled at the Doctor.'Erm... you helped him. How can you have forgotten?' `Let me get this clear.' The Doctor mopped up the last crumbs of cake, licked his fingers, and chose his words carefully. `Ten years ago, Jamie and I came to this world, and helped King Conrad...' ... Good King Conrad, bless him!' Ernst interrupted. ...to wrest the crown from his brother Gavin...' `Boo hiss!' chorused Ernst and Geffre, his endlessly tall, languorous, but equally-spectacled friend who had just walked in from a long day at the Palace. `...who was then locked up in the Tower of Judgement: `Well, at first,' Geffre explained slowly. 'But when Good King Conrad decided that the Tower was a blot on the landscape and to demolish it and replace it with a Palladium of Art for the Community, he sent Gavin into exile.A long way from here: `We've seen the last of that rat-bag!' declared Ernst. 'He'll never dare show his scabby, disloyal, clean-shaven face back here' `And we owe it all to you and Jamie: said Geffre. `But, Doctor... ' Jamie had long since left confusion behind and was now toying with bewilderment. `Shh, Jamie, I'm thinking:The Doctor's face was even more creased than usual. Something occurred to him. 'Now you're positive that you're not getting your kings mixed up?' Ernst and Geffre stared at him blankly. The Doctor clutched at his final straw. And you promise you're not just teasing us?' Ernst and Geffre stared at each other blankly. The Doctor sighed, his face crumpled like the hanky in his pocket. `If it's not one thing, it's another:\n\n36\n\n`Supper won't be ready for an hour at least,' declared Ernst.'Why doesn't Geffre take you both for a drink at the tavern?' Geffre strode purposely through the balmy twilight, his long legs leaving the Doctor and Jamie scuttling to keep up. A million insects gossiped noisily, but kept their distance. 'I don't understand, Doctor, what's going on?' Jamie whispered. `I'm not sure, Jamie, but I expect there is some rational explanation.' 'But we helped Gavin,' protested Jamie. 'He was the good guy. He was the one the people wanted to be king. Conrad was a right... well, you know. Everyone said so. Now I could understand if they'd been hypnotised or something.That's usual: `Don't forget, Jamie, they are also convinced that we were on Conrad's side: 'But we weren't!' Jamie stopped. 'Were we?' The Doctor shook his head. 'I really don't know: The Doctor and Jamie sat on the grass outside, clutching their drinks The noise inside had begun to weary them and they were both feeling rather light-headed, not entirely due to the potency of the local wine. Everyone had greeted them as returning heroes and had bombarded them with drinks and slaps on the back and updates on their lives. Luckily no one had asked the time travellers what they had been up to since their previous visit because it would have resulted in a very short conversation. Jamie muttered something to the Doctor about feeling a fraud, but the Doctor had responded that they weren't really, after all, they had fought to save the people from a tyrant - just not the one that everyone assumed. It was almost time for them to return to Ernst's supper, so while Geffre 'paid a visit', the Doctor and Jamie waited for him outside the tavern. It was a gorgeous evening, the air was warm without being oppressive, only the sounds of nature could be heard, and the stars twinkled exactly the way they are supposed to. 'They seem very happy with Conrad as king, don't they, Doctor?' An interminable litany of praise for King Conrad had been forced on them for the past hour. It had become a bit boring eventually, like being bombarded with photos and anecdotes by a grandmother who is convinced her grandchild is a genius, a prodigy, or maybe even a messiah. Since his coronation, Conrad had instigated free medical help for all, ensured a more equitable distribution of wealth, built affordable housing, and made intolerance illegal and - more effectively - unfashionable. He had even ordered his Scientist Royal to invent calorie-free chocolate. The only complaint seemed to be that the telly wasn't as good any more, but as the Doctor pointed out, drama doesn't thrive in an atmosphere of nirvana. 37\n\n`Yes, they do,' said the Doctor, 'and it's not right. 'I don't see what the problem is: Jamie shrugged, eyelids drooping, the wine having hit the spot. 'They've got a king they like and who doesn't chop their heads off for any silly wee excuse. Let's just leave it at that, eh?' He lay back and stared at the sky. `Because there's something wrong, Jamie, I can feel it in my water. Gavin was a good man. I knew that as soon as I met him and we were right to fight for him' `Perhaps... ' Jamie started, then paused. `Perhaps what?' Jamie shrugged nervously. 'Perhaps you... we were wrong.' Wrong?'The Doctor's face was unusually immobile.'In what way?' Jamie knew he was stuck in this hole so he had to make the most of it. `Maybe, we were on the wrong side. Perhaps Gavin was the villain, after all' `Fiddlesticks!'The Doctor folded his arms. `I know my dictators. No, the important questions are: Why have the people changed their allegiance? How come history has been rewritten? Why do they think we were fighting for the wrong side? And most peculiarly, what is behind Conrad's suspicious benevolence?' Jamie gave no response:I realise those were rhetorical questions, Jamie, but I would appreciate...' He noticed that Jamie was laid prostrate on the ground, his knees bent, hands behind his head. 'Oh, Jamie do pay attention.\"This enigma was making the Doctor cross. Jamie sat up rather too quickly. His head spun and he clutched his forehead. 'I've just noticed something odd' `Yes, well, oddness does seem to be a la mode in these parts.' `You know I spent last night with the princesses...' The Doctor coughed. 'Now, Jamie, you're a grown lad and I can't stop you doing... Just be glad the King didn't find out...' `No, Doctor, the lassies took me up the hill and showed me their constellations.' The Doctor looked uncomfortable. The stars,' Jamie explained:They pointed them out to me and told me their names. I can't remember them all, although I know Princess Japonica was born under the Sign of the Wardrobe. It just looked like four stars quite near each other to me. I couldn'ae see a wardrobe: The Doctor gulped down the last of his drink and shut his eyes. `Now, I'm no expert on the stars, although I've visited a few of them since I joined you: Jamie shook his head. 'But I think those stars up there are all in a different place from last night.' The Doctor's eyes snapped open. `Yes, I am sure they're all higgledy-piggledy: 38\n\nThe Doctor stared into the heavens and slapped the ground. A grin cracked his face and he leaped up and danced a tittle jig. Not for the first time, Jamie was secretly relieved that he had taken the precaution of chopping up the recorder, not that it ever prevented the Doctor producing a fresh one from somewhere. Geffre left the tavern. 'Ready for sups, chaps?' The next morning - naturally with an azure sky and perfectly choreographed butterflies - after a breakfast as delicious and tablebreaking as the previous night's supper, the Doctor and Jamie set off to the TARDIS. 'But, Doctor, I can't believe it.' 'It's the only explanation' 'But everything's exactly the same' \"That's the whole point of doppelganger worlds.They are rare, I admit, but they are a fascinating phenomenon.Two planets, absolutely identical down to the last leaf? 'But what about Ernst and Geffre?' The same geology, flora, fauna, even individuals. It's a trillion billion to one chance, but', the Doctor sniffed, 'anything's possible.' The Doctor stopped and surveyed the environment with great pleasure. 'Fascinating!' 'Bit of a coincidence, eh, Doctor, to land here straight away after the first planet?' 'Now, Jamie, don't knock coincidence. Very useful thing. Don't know where I'd have been without coincidence down the years: 'So...' Jamie began. 'So?' the Doctor asked. 'What now, Doctor? The Doctor rubbed his hands together. Ah!' he said. The people are happy, the planet is idyllic and the weather is glorious' 'The telly isn't very good apparently though' 'Yes, well, Jamie, there's nothing you and I could do about that' 'So...' 'By rights, we should move on. Return to the TARDIS and move on. To the next adventure.There's nothing here for us to do' 'Is that right?' 'Except...' the Doctor winked, `to have a marvellous holiday!' 'I'll get the sun tan lotion' 'And I'll get the bucket and spade' The pair of them scampered in the direction of the TARDIS. 'Do you think Ernst and Geffre will mind us staying with them?' Jamie\n\n39\n\n`Mind? They are the perfect hosts.Although we'd better not impose for too long. Guests are like fish, they go off after three days.' As the grove where the TARDIS rested came into view; Jamie paused and took a look back at the surrounding land.A cloud sidled in front of the sun, but soon realised it was not welcome and quickly dispersed. 'I wonder what's going on back at the other planet?' he asked. The Doctor was fishing for the TARDIS key. 'In what way, Jamie?' `If Conrad is the good guy, what does that make Gavin?' The Doctor stared at Jamie. `I mean: he struggled to make sense of what he was thinking, 'did we help put the wrong man in power?' `No,' the Doctor stated firmly. But for a second, a worried expression made a brief visit to his face. 'Obviously...' he began, an explanation almost but not quite within his reach. 'Um, obviously, on this planet, Conrad is the benevolent leader while back on the other planet, Gavin takes that role: `But you said the two planets were identical,' accused Jamie. `They are,' protested the Doctor. `Down to the tiniest leaf.' `Um... `Suppose we've helped a tyrant gain power? What then?' `We haven't. Look, didn't Gavin seem like a decent chap to you?' `He did: `And what about his daughters? The princesses?' `Japonica and Corianda?' `Yes, you liked them, didn't you, Jamie?' Jamie stuck his hands in his sporran and emitted a heartfelt 'Oh aye.' `There you are then: the Doctor stated firmly. `Do you seriously think those girls would allow their father to turn into an autocrat?' `A what?' `A bully.A despot: Jamie looked blank. `A James the Seventh.' Jamie's lip curled. 'No, probably not: `There's no probably about it. They were good girls, they'll keep their dad in check. `But...' `Trust me' A mauve-feathered bird landed on the branch of a nearby tree and cawcaw-cawed as though laughing at a particularly dirty joke. `I do: Jamie stated, almost convincingly. 'But... ' The Doctor looked cross. 'But what?' Jamie chewed on his lower lip. 'Suppose you're wrong?' An outraged squawk escaped from the Doctor:I am never wrong!' The pair of them looked at each other. 40\n\n'I suppose we could always check,' said the Doctor, meekly. 'How can we do that?' Silence. Then the Doctor snapped his fingers. 'The fast return switch!' He shrugged his shoulders. 'Well, it might work: Four very short legs ran as fast as they could to the TARDIS. Jamie arrived first. The Doctor flung him the key, and he opened the door and disappeared inside. The Doctor stopped at the door and patted the 'Emergency' notice:Don't let me down, old friend.' 'It all seems okay.' Appearances can be deceptive, Jamie. Haven't you learned that through all our travels?' They stared up at the statue. 'Is it my imagination, Doctor, or is it taller than the one of Conrad?' \"Mere is a tape measure back in the TARDIS, Jamie. You can always measure it if you like.' As expected the sun shone, birds twittered harmoniously, and the breeze lapped deliciously against their faces. They had yet to spot an ominous pall of smoke, or a corpse-laden gibbet, or even an officious noticeboard. Instead, children played unsupervised in the street. Passing strangers nodded at each other with a smile A man walking his dog scooped. And not only had the Tower of Judgement disappeared, but the Palladium Of Art For The Community was almost complete - and, astonishingly, quite tastefully designed. 'Well, Doctor, what do you think?' The Doctor surveyed the surroundings. As paradises go, it was bit suburban and unexciting for him, but then he wasn't expecting to live here. But neither did he get the itch to overthrow the local authority. Which made a nice change, and meant that someone was doing something right. 'I think,' he said, that I'd like a cup of tea: Ernst greeted them as though he hadn't seen them for years and hadn't cooked supper for them last night, which of course he hadn't. He dished out all the local gossip, most of which was pretty identical to what they had heard last night. Since Gavin had claimed the throne, life had progressed rather nicely, thank you very much; the streets were clean, the prisons were virtually empty, and a cure for gout had just been announced. Hurrah for Good King Gavin, he cheered. And yah boo to rotten old Conrad, justifiably exiled to the distant armpit of the world. 'Shame about the telly, though: sympathised Jamie. 'Oh no,' protested Ernst:TV's getting better. Mostly repeats admittedly, 41\n\nbut old stuff we haven't seen for donkey's years, when they knew how to tell a story well' Jamie and the Doctor finished their tea, accepted some of Ernst's homemade cake for their journey, and, imparting messages of love for Geffre, they departed. `Now all we have to choose; said Jamie, 'is which of the two planets we are going to spend our holiday on` Timm!' the Doctor muttered. Jamie groaned. 'I know that \"hmm\" ' Timm?' No, not that one. That's a question \"hmm\" I mean the first \"hmm\", the itching-to-investigate-something-and get-us-into-a-terrible-mess \"hmm\" ' The Doctor smiled. 'You know me too well, Jamie` `What is there to investigate?' asked Jamie. Two planets, both very happy. End of story.' Two kings, both good men and wise rulers,' said the Doctor, 'albeit neither of them democratically elected. Why were they at war with each other?' `Don't care,' said Jamie. 'Fancy an ice cream?' `Yes; said the Doctor. 'But after we've solved this dilemma.' `There is no dilemma,' Jamie grumbled. 'Except what flavour.' `But... but... but...' spluttered King Conrad. 'It's bigger on the inside than the out!' `Oh aye; said Jamie, `so it is.' He led Conrad into the TARDIS console room and held out a Chippendale chair for the royal posterior, but the king wandered about the console in a daze. 'With technology like this, it is little surprise that you were able to defeat my wicked brother.' Jamie fidgeted awkwardly. He hadn't met Conrad before, although the king greeted him like an old friend. Conrad was uncannily like his brother, with the exception of the bushy moustache which engulfed the middle of his face. He even shared the same twinkle in the eye as Gavin, which sat oddly with the brutal reputation he initially held. Eventually, his senses regained, Conrad ceased his aimless roaming and turned to face Jamie. 'Why have you brought me here, Jamie? I owe you and the Doctor my whole life, but I am a busy man, you understand` `Oh aye, we realise that,' Jamie said slowly. He chose his next words as carefully as he could. 'But we feel, the Doctor and I, that your world is missing just one thing which could help you be even more prosperous and, erm, happier than it is already? Conrad's eyes narrowed. And that is?' His hand automatically reached for where his sword usually hung. 42\n\n'Oh, I'll leave the Doctor to explain it,' Jamie said, then quickly added, 'Besides, it's all his idea anyway` Conrad took his seat. 'Kindly inform the Doctor that I am ready to receive him whenever he is ready.' 'I'll do that: Jamie raced down the corridor to the room which the Doctor had allocated for this - in Jamie's opinion - daft business. He knocked on the door, and the Doctor poked his head out. 'You-know-who is ready,' Jamie informed him. And very reluctantly unarmed` The Doctor nodded.'Bring him here. But be prepared...' Jamie, muscles taut, sweat dripping, a rictus smile etched on his face, led Conrad down the corridor.As they reached the door, Jamie wanted to say something, but couldn't decide what. He knocked on the door and then turned the handle. He gestured for the King to enter.As Conrad went in, Jamie poised himself to leap. Two identical screams of anguish rent the air, as Conrad saw with whom he shared the room. 'How dare you break your exile!' Gavin and Conrad yelled at each other in unison. 'For that you will die!' Both reached for swords that weren't there. Remembering they were unarmed each leaped for the other's throat. Jamie hastily grabbed Conrad by the shoulders, while the Doctor, with astonishing ease, restrained Gavin. 'Now, majesties,' said the Doctor, 'we all need to have a little talk. Jamie, put the kettle on' Gavin and Conrad glowered at each other, matching lips curled in scorn. Jamie stared at the surroundings. He had never been in here before. It was a long room, so long it had its own horizon.The walls and floor were covered with what looked like dimpled mattresses. Gavin sat on one side of the room, Conrad the other, the pair of them separated by a narrow river which flowed down the middle of the room into the distance. Occasionally, small life-forms could be seen near the surface of the water. Jamie didn't want to know what they were. The two kings had hesitatingly agreed to listen to what the Doctor wished to say. But each had fixed his eyes on his hated brother, ready to rip the other's heart out if the opportunity made itself available. The Doctor had spent the past ten minutes explaining the situation. But It became clear to Jamie that neither king was listening to a word the Doctor said. Gavin glared at the Doctor.'My people consider you a hero, Doctor. But they will cheerfully tear you in half for allowing that accursed monster to return to our land' 43\n\n`You think so?' Conrad spat:It is you they despise.Although, much as I am loathe to agree with such an asinine specimen of humanity, my people will fmd it hard to forgive this betrayal, Doctor. `Your people? Pah!' `Yes, my people, usurper.' The Doctor flopped down on to a chair and rested his cheeks in his palms. 'Oh dear.' Jamie shook his head:I could have told you, Doctor.' Gavin made to stand up. Jamie tensed:If this charade is finished, Doctor, I wish to leave. I have a sibling to kill. `Really?' Conrad sneered. 'You and whose army?' Gavin considered. My own.' `My army', said Conrad proudly, 'is bigger than yours.' `Your army?' spat Gavin. 'A rag-tag of mercenaries and low-life scum. Conrad was shocked. 'A fine way to describe the Royal Retinue!' Actually,' Jamie pointed out, 'they're both the same` `As if the Royal Retinue would demean their courageous selves to serve a rascal such as you...' `Gentlemen, please!' A loud thwack rent the air.The Doctor tucked his hand inside his armpit, trying to hide exactly how much hitting the table with his palm had hurt. 'Stop this childish behaviour!' The two kings looked at him sulkily. Conrad muttered something under his breath. `I heard that, Conrad: the Doctor snapped. Gavin sniggered:You know, it's your own time you're wasting. I'm not going anywhere. I can stay here all night.And we are not leaving until this is sorted out` Gavin stared at the ceiling. Conrad examined his fingernails. `I don't understand: the Doctor said, sadly. 'You're both good kings. Among the best I have ever encountered.Admittedly, as Oscar said, a good king is the worst enemy of democracy.' He caught Jamie's eye. 'But now isn't the time, I expect. But,' he continued, 'if you are both wonderful rulers individually, just imagine how much better you'd be if you could work together.' Simultaneous snorts erupted from the matching noses of Gavin and Conrad. Even Jamie looked incredulous. 'Oh aye, Doctor, you'll be suggesting the Daleks and the Cybermen share a highland fling next` `Share the throne with him?' Gavin boggled. `I'd rather share my trousers with a leper: said Conrad. The Doctor restrained himself from tearing his hair out. 'But what is the problem?' he spluttered:I don't understand. Gavin, explain to me - what is so wrong with your brother?' Gavin stared at Conrad with undisguised loathing:The list of his crimes is endless` 44\n\n'Pah!' `Start at the very beginning,' suggested the Doctor:It's a very good place to start' Gavin smiled. This he would obviously enjoy. 'He eats with his mouth open' The Doctor stared at him `Oh?' `And not just that,' Gavin continued outraged, 'he actually shovels food in while he's talking' `I do not!' Do!' `Well, actually,' said Conrad, 'that's nothing. He breathes in a really annoying way.' `How?' asked the Doctor, interested despite himself. `It's a sort of... just... like this' And Conrad demonstrated an overemphasised hiss. Gavin pulled a hurt face. 'I don't do that!' 'Well, you do actually: said the Doctor apologetically. 'But I expect it's just adenoids. We can get that sorted out quite easily.' 'No one's getting anywhere near my nose with a scalpel just to keep that monkey-mannered oaf quiet.' 'He also', Conrad was clearly almost enjoying himself now, 'reads something funny and laughs out loud and everyone is supposed to ask him what's funny and if they don't then he's like a Moglan Beast with a sore head for the rest of the day.' 'Just because you've got no sense of humour,' accused Gavin. 'I have too' 'Anyway,' shouted Gavin, 'at least I remember to put the seat down afterwards...' The Doctor and Jamie slipped out of the room. `I just don't understand!' the Doctor wailed again. `It's very simple,' Jamie explained. `They're family. It's quite normal' The Doctor stared at him. 'Is it?' 'Oh aye. If you had a brother, you'd be fighting with him all the time' The Doctor said nothing. 'It's just that they're both kings, so they've got armies and power and no one to tell them they're both being big girly dafties` 'I suppose we had better separate them and get them back to their respective worlds` 'Leave them for a while. They're having a whale of a time in there. Let them enjoy themselves. You never know, it might even get some of the silliness out of their systems` The Doctor nodded sadly. 45\n\nGavin and Conrad eventually exhausted themselves with their arguing and had now separated themselves. Gavin had removed his shoes and was paddling in the stream, seemingly oblivious to the small creatures nibbling at his toes, while Conrad was sprawled on his back in the corner, head on the floor, his legs up against the wall. Gavin pursed his lips and breathily whistled a popular tune while Conrad ground his teeth to powder. Jamie led Conrad out of the TARDIS and back to his palace, while the Doctor returned Gavin to his own planet. Neither brother said a word to each other. That night, stuffed to the gills with another of Ernst's eat-till-you-explode suppers and consequently incapable of movement, Jamie and the Doctor sprawled in the garden, enjoying a meteor shower. Jamie had unwisely chosen a hammock, so when a sudden thought caused him to sit up, he regretted it. `Doctor!' he exclaimed, clutching his stomach to stop the contents slopping about inside him `What is it, Jamie?' the Doctor yawned. `When we arrived on this planet - or was it the other planet? - we asked Ernst how Conrad got into power, and he told us that we had helped him But we didn't.
