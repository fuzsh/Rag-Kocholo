Book your appointment to donate blood and find out.\n\nBOOK NOW\n\nWhat is the most common blood type?\n\nO-positive blood type is the most common blood type in Canada — 39 per cent of Canadians share this blood type.\n\nDonors who are AB+ positive are the universal platelet and plasma donors because these blood components can be transfused to any patient.\n\nDonors who are O-negative are the universal blood type; O-negative red blood cells are compatible with all other blood types. This means that in critical emergencies — when there is no time to confirm a patient’s blood type — O-negative blood can make a lifesaving difference.\n\nThe right blood transfusion can mean the difference between life and death. Our immune systems are designed to know what belongs in our body and what doesn’t. If a patient gets the wrong blood type, things can go very wrong. That’s why there are very specific ways in which blood types must be matched for a safe transfusion.\n\nUse the interactive graphic below to learn more about matching blood types for transfusions.\n\nThe universal red cell donor has type O-negative blood. O-negative donors are essential to saving the lives of patients when we don’t know their blood type (often in trauma situations), and their blood is the only type that O-negative recipients can receive. The universal plasma donor has type AB blood.\n\nAlso, Rh-negative blood is given to Rh-negative patients, and Rh-positive or Rh-negative blood may be given to Rh-positive patients. The rules for plasma are the reverse.\n\nDid you know that some people’s blood is rarer than others? It’s not just about being type A, B, O or AB. On the surface of our red blood cells are molecules called antigens. There are about 360 known antigens — and some combinations of antigens are far less common than others.\n\nWhenever a blood transfusion is required, time is of the essence. But if someone in need has a rare blood type, finding a matching donor can be hard. Through our rare blood program, we make sure lifesaving rare blood is available to patients whenever and wherever it’s needed. To deliver on that promise, we need everyone with rare blood to donate regularly."
