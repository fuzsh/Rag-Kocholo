Nonetheless, HIV-infected patients (HIV-pts) remain at an increased risk of hematologic malignancies for which HSCT is standard therapy. While HAART enables HIV-pts to undergo autologous HSCT with comparable results to the general population, the outcome of HIV-pts after allogeneic (allo-) HSCT remains largely unknown, with limited case reports and small series. Here, we present an updated report of the experience of allo-HSCT for hematologic indications in HIV-pts reported to the EBMT Registry.\n\nMethods: This is a retrospective study of HIV-pts receiving a first allo-HSCT from 1997 to 2018. HIV-pts’ outcomes were compared with HIV-negative controls (HIV-neg), including a 1:3 case-control matched analysis for the following criteria: diagnosis, disease status, year and age at transplant (both +/− 3 years), gender, previous autologous transplant, donor type, cell source, conditioning regimen (myeloablative vs reduced intensity, TBI vs chemotherapy-based) and ex-vivo manipulation.\n\nResults: We identified 144 HIV-pts who received a first allo-HSCT: AML (n = 59, 41%), CLPD (n = 30, 21%), MDS (n = 21, 15%), ALL (n = 20, 14%), SAA (n = 6, 4%), and others (n = 8, 5%); 96 men (67%), median age 42 (0-69), including 19 pediatric/adolescent cases ≤18 years; matched (72, 50%) and mismatched (15, 10%) related, unrelated (50, 35%) and cord-blood (7, 5%) donors/source; 76 myeloablative conditioning (53%; 35 TBI-based); 10 (7%) with ex vivo TCD; 13 (9%) with a prior autologous transplant. Beyond the matching criteria, cases and controls were also balanced for donor gender and gender mismatch, in vivo TCD and Karnofsky’s performance status. Compared to HIV-neg, HIV-pts had lower rates of neutrophil engraftment (92% vs 98%, p = 0.002), higher incidence of grade III-IV acute GVHD (18% vs 10%, p = 0.007), higher NRM at day 100 (13% vs 7%, p = 0.022) and 2 years (32% vs 20%, p = 0.001), and similar incidence of relapse (28% vs 24%, n.s.). Overall, HIV-pts had poorer PFS (40% vs 56%; p < 0.001, HR=1.80 [1.34-2.41]), GRFS (31% vs 46%; p = 0.002, HR=1.54 [1.17-2.03]) and OS (48% vs 61%; p = 0.001; HR=1.68 [1.23-2.28]) at 2 years than HIV-neg cases. Outcomes within HIV-pts were comparable across different donor types, stem cell sources or intensity of conditioning regimen (data not shown). Of note, the use of unrelated donors in HIV-pts (40%) remains markedly reduced compared to allo-HSCT standard practice (51%; Passweg, et al. 10.1038/s41409-019-0465-9).\n\nConclusions: This study reports on the largest series available of allo-HSCT in HIV-pts. Despite the limitations of any retrospective study, the pair-matched design strongly suggests that the outcome of allo-HSCT is poorer in HIV-pts than in the general population, primarily driven by higher NRM, in association with higher severe GVHD, and in keeping with their reduced overall life expectancy despite HAART. Even so, allo-HSCT is feasible in HIV-pts with hematologic indications, with a 48% OS at 2 years. HIV-pts with an indication for allo-HSCT should be considered for the procedure, including those without matched-related donors, who should be granted access to alternative donor search and consideration for transplantation at the same level as HIV-neg candidates.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to declare.\n\nO011. Comparable Outcomes of AML Patients Receiving Haplo-HCT with Thiotepa/Busulfan/Fludarabine Conditioning and Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide Versus a Matched Unrelated Donor with Fludarabine/Busulfan Conditioning, Regardless of Disease Status\n\nAli Bazarbachi1, Myriam Labopin2, Didier Blaise3, Edouard Forcade4, Gerard Socié5, Ana Berceanu6, Claude Eric Bulabois7, Nicolaus Kröger8, Alessandro Rambaldi9, Patrice Ceballos10, Stephan Mielke11, Ibrahim Yakoub-Agha12, Bipin Savani13, Alexandros Spyridonidis14, Arnon Nagler15, Mohamad Mohty16\n\n1American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon, 2EBMT Paris Study Office, CEREST-TC, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France, 3Paoli-Calmettes Institute, Inserm CBT1409, Marseille, France, 4CHU Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France, 5Hopital St. Louis, Paris, France, 6Hopital Jean Minjoz, Besancon, France, 7CHU Grenoble Alpes - Université Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France, 8University Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany, 9ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy, 10CHU Lapeyronie, Montpellier, France, 11Karolinska Intitutet and University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, 12CHU de Lille, LIRIC, INSERM U995, Université de Lille, Lille, France, 13Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, United States, 14University Hospital of Patras, BMT Unit, Patras, Greece, 15Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel-hosmer, Israel, 16EBMT Paris Study Office, CEREST-TC, Saint Antoine Hospital, INSERM UMR 938, Université Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France\n\nBackground: While a HLA matched sibling donor (MSD) represents the first choice for allogeneic hematopoeitic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), most patients do not have a MSD and hence alternative donor sources are used, most frequently matched unrelated donors (MUD) or haploidentical donors (haplo). Multiple studies compared outcomes of MUD and haplo but included patients from different risk groups and with heterogeneous conditioning regimens.\n\nMethods: Here we compared transplant outcomes at EBMT participating centers between 2010 and 2018, of 708 AML patients receiving haploHCT using a homogeneous thiotepa/busulfan/fludarabine conditioning with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (haplo-TBF), to 2083 patients receiving MUD (10/10) using a homogeneous fludarabine/busulfan conditioning and in vivo T-cell depletion (MUD-FB), both being among the most popular regimens in these respective settings. All analyses were stratified according to disease status and cytogenetic risk group for patients transplanted in first complete remission (CR1).\n\nResults: Patients, donors and transplant characteristics are summarized in Table 1. For patients with intermediate cytogenetic risk AML transplanted in CR1 (234 haplo-TBF and 1124 MUD-FB), multivariate analysis (MVA) using the Cox regression method revealed that haplo-TBF significantly increased non-relapse mortality (NRM) (HR 2.1; p = 0.0006) but did not affect relapse incidence (RI), leukemia free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS) or graft- versus-host disease free, relapse free survival (GRFS). Older age negatively affected NRM, LFS, OS and GRFS whereas transplant outcomes were not affected by patient and donor gender or CMV positivity, year of transplant, time from diagnosis to transplant, Karnofsky score, stem cell source, or intensity of conditioning. For patients with high cytogenetic risk AML transplanted in CR1 (79 haplo-TBF and 280 MUD-FB), MVA showed that haplo-TBF significantly increased NRM (HR=2.7; p = 0.02), decreased RI (HR=0.45; p = 0.03) but had no influence on LFS, OS or GRFS. Again, transplant outcomes were not affected by other patient, donor and transplant characteristics, except lower OS in older patients. For patients with AML transplanted in CR2 (165 haplo-TBF and 440 MUD-FB), haplo-TBF significantly increased NRM (HR=2.36; p = 0.008), decreased RI (HR=0.38; p = 0.005), but had no influence on LFS, OS or GRFS. Patient age negatively affected NRM and OS whereas a shorter time from diagnosis to transplant negatively affected RI, LFS, OS and GRFS. Transplant outcomes were not affected by other patient, donor and transplant characteristics. Finally, for patients with AML transplanted with active disease (230 haplo-TBF and 239 MUD-FB), haplo-TBF had no influence on transplant outcomes. Older patient age negatively affected NRM and poor performance status negatively affected all transplant outcomes. Other patient, donor and transplant characteristics had no effect on outcomes.\n\nConclusions: Compared to MUD-FB, haplo-TBF increased NRM, reduced RI in high risk AML, resulting in similar LFS, OS and GRFS. These results support the use of either a matched unrelated donor or a haplo-identical family donor for AML patients lacking a MSD, regardless of disease status at transplant.\n\nClinical Trial Registry: not applicable.\n\nDisclosure: no disclosures.\n\nO012. Trends and Predictive Factors for Outcome of Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia After Allogeneic Hematopoeitic Cell Transplant: Improved Survival for Young Patients in Recent Years\n\nAli Bazarbachi1, Myriam Labopin2, Dietrich Beelen3, Igor Wolfgang Blau4, Victoria Potter5, Riitta Niittyvuopio6, Gerard Socié7, Didier Blaise7, Jaime Sanz8, Fabio Ciceri9, Alexandros Spyridonidis10, Gesine Bug11, Jordi Esteve12, Bipin N Savani13, Christoph Schmid14, Arnon Nagler15, Mohamad Mohty16\n\n1American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon, 2EBMT Paris Study Office, CEREST-TC, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France, 3University Hospital, Essen, Germany, 4Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany, 5GKT School of Medicine, London, United Kingdom, 6HUCH Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland, 7Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France, 8University Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain, 9Ospedale San Raffaele s.r.l., Milano, Italy, 10University Hospital of Patras, Patras, Greece, 11Goethe-Universitaet, Frankfurt Main, Germany, 12Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain, 13Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, United States, 14Klinikum Augsburg, II Medizinische Klinik, Ausburg, Germany, 15Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-hosmer, Israel, 16EBMT Paris Study Office, CEREST-TC, Saint Antoine Hospital, INSERM UMR 938, Université Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France\n\nBackground: Disease relapse represents the main cause of treatment failure after allogeneic hematopoietic-cell-transplantation (allo-HCT) for acute-myeloid-leukemia (AML). Standard treatment modalities include reduction/withdrawal of immunosuppression, chemotherapy or hypomethylating agents with or without donor lymphocyte infusion, a second allo-HCT or even palliative care. More recently, multiple targeted therapies were introduced in that setting. However, little information is available about the global impact of the current standard of care for relapsed AML after allo-HCT and about the predictive factors for outcome.\n\nMethods: Here we compared transplant outcomes at EBMT participating centers of 8162 adult AML patients who relapsed between 2000 and 2018 after allo-HCT performed in first complete remission (CR1). We included patients who received transplants from matched sibling or unrelated donors or haploidentical donors. Patients receiving in vitro T cell depletion were excluded. All outcomes were censored at 2 years after relapse. Median follow up for alive patients was 35 months.\n\nResults: Patients, donors and transplant characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Overall, 692 patients relapsed between 2000-2004, 1734 between 2005-2009, 2856 between 2010-2014 and 2878 between 2015-2018. The 2-year overall survival after relapse was 17%. Original disease was the cause of death in 77% of patients. A second allo-HCT within 2 years after relapse was performed in 17% of patients resulting in a 2-year OS of 37%. For 3630 patients less than 50 years of age at relapse, the 2-year OS after relapse increased from 16% for patients relapsing between 2000-2004 to 18% for 2005-2009, 21% for 2010-2014 and 26% for 2015-2018 (p = 0.001). The incidence of second allo-HCT was 23%, 20%, 22% and 32% for the same time periods (p = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, OS from relapse was positively affected by the year of relapse after 2010 compared to 2000-2004 (HR 0.82; p< 0.02 for patients relapsing from 2010-2014 and HR=0.72; p = 0.0002 for patients relapsing from 2015-2018), good performance status at transplant and longer time from transplant to relapse but negatively affected by patient age and intermediate or high cytogenetic risk group. Other patient, donor and transplant characteristics had no significant effect. Conversely, for 4532 patients > 50 year-old at relapse, the 2-year OS from relapse was not affected by the year of relapse (16% for 2000-2004; 15% for 2005-2009 and 2010-2014 and 14% for 2015-2018; p = 0.56) whereas the incidence of second allo-HCT surprisingly decreased from 17% for 2000-2004 to 14% in 2005-2009; 11% in 2010-2014 and 13% in 2015-2018 (p = 0.006). In multivariate analysis, OS from relapse was positively affected by the time from transplant to relapse, good performance status and transplant from matched sibling donor while negatively affected by patient age and adverse cytogenetic risk group. Other patient, donor and transplant characteristics had no effect including the year of relapse.\n\nConclusions: We demonstrate a significant improvement of OS from relapse after 2010 for younger patients, which was more pronounced after 2015. These results likely reflect the efficacy of post-transplant salvage including second allo-HCT. The 2-year OS of 37% after a second transplant probably supports to reconsider this approach in a subset of relapsed patients.\n\nClinical Trial Registry: not applicable.\n\nDisclosure: no disclosures.\n\nO013. Anti-cd3/cd33 Bispecific Antibodies Efficiently Redirect Donor T Cells Against HLA Loss Leukemia Relapses\n\nPier Edoardo Rovatti1, Laura Zito1, Eleonora Draghi1, Monika Herrmann2, Anetta Marcinek1,2, Bettina Brauchle2, Cesare Covino1, Mattia Di Bono1, Matteo Giovanni Carrabba1, Massimo Bernardi1, Karl-Peter Hopfner2, Cristina Toffalori1, Fabio Ciceri1, Marion Subklewe2, Luca Vago1\n\n1IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy, 2Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, Munich, Germany\n\nBackground: Genomic loss of mismatched HLAs (\"HLA loss\") represents a frequent modality by which acute myeloid leukemia (AML) evades immune recognition from donor T cells after partially HLA-incompatible allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Here, we tested the ability of an anti-CD3/CD33 bispecific antibody (BsAb) to circumvent the loss of T cell receptor-HLA interactions and re-target donor T cells towards HLA loss relapses.\n\nMethods: T cells purified from healthy donors were co-cultured with primary patient blasts with or without addition of BsAb and surface expression of early T cell activation markers (CD25 and CD69) was evaluated after 72 hours.\n\nWe established mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLCs) between T cells purified from three patients after allo-HCT and primary AML blasts obtained from the same patients at time of diagnosis. After sequential stimulations, co-cultures were tested against respective patient leukemia at diagnosis and at relapse, measuring T cell degranulation (as CD107a expression), antigen-specific activation (as CD137/41-BB expression) and target-specific cytotoxicity (by live cell imaging over a 48-hour time span) in the presence or absence of BsAb.\n\nFor in vivo experiments, primary HLA loss samples were infused intravenously into non-irradiated NSG mice, followed by intravenous infusion of T cells and daily administration of BsAb.\n\nResults: First, we reviewed immunophenotypic data of 36 HLA loss relapses documented at our Institution over the last 15 years, verifying robust surface expression of CD33 on relapsed leukemia in 97% of them.\n\nBy short-term co-culture experiments between healthy donor T cells and allogeneic leukemia we titrated BsAb concentration and effector:target ratio to be used for subsequent experiments.\n\nT cells collected from patients after HCT robustly responded against patient leukemia at time of diagnosis in terms of degranulation (71,6% mean CD8+CD107+ population). As expected, when tested against HLA loss relapses, T cells failed to recognize target cells (5,9% mean CD8+CD107+ population). Noticeably, when BsAb was added, we detected a strong response, indicating that T cells were effectively re-targeted towards HLA loss variants (84,6% mean CD8+CD107+ population).\n\nSimilar results were obtained measuring antigen-specific T cell activation and target cell apoptosis by live-cell imaging: consistent with previous assays, donor T cells recognized and killed leukemia at diagnosis (45% of detection area positive for apoptosis dye) and failed to recognize its HLA loss relapse counterpart (32% of area positive for apoptosis dye). Addition of BsAb to co-cultures drove dramatic cell death of HLA loss blasts (80% of area positive for apoptosis dye), demonstrating that BsAb also, and most importantly, induced target cell killing.\n\nFinally, we modelled BsAb activity in vivo, showing that, whereas the sole infusion of T cells is not able to prevent the leukemia outgrowth in the bone marrow of NSG mice, addition of the BsAb leads to significant disease reduction.\n\nConclusions: Our results demonstrate that anti-CD3/CD33 BsAbs can effectively redirect donor T cells against HLA loss leukemia variants, resulting in their rapid and effective killing. Taken together, these promising findings strongly support translation of this approach to clinical trials, to provide a rational therapy for this increasingly recognized but still treatment-orphan modality of post-transplantation relapse.\n\nDisclosure: Fabio, Ciceri: San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-TIGET).

Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) Emerges as a Key Driver of HLA Class II Negative Post-Transplantation Relapse\n\nValentina Gambacorta1,2, Daniela Gnani1, Laura Zito1, Stefano Beretta3, Lucia Zanotti1, Giacomo Oliveira1, Davide Cittaro1, Ivan Merelli3, Fabio Ciceri1, Raffaella Di Micco1, Luca Vago1\n\n1IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy, Milano, Italy, 2San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-TIGET), IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy, 2Milano-Bicocca University, Milano, Italy, 3Institute for Biomedical Technologies, National Research Council, Segrate, Milano, Italy,\n\nBackground: Evasion from immune control represents one of the main drivers of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse after allogeneic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Recently, we and others (Toffalori et al, Nat Med, 2019; Christopher et al, N Engl J Med, 2018) reported that up to 40% of AML relapses display loss of surface expression of HLA class II not explained by genomic alterations. Here, we aim to decipher epigenetic alterations responsible for this immune escape modality.\n\nMethods: We generated patient derived xenografts (PDXs) from diagnosis and relapse samples with non-genomic loss of HLA class II expression and verified that they faithfully recapitulated the original immune-related differences between diagnosis and relapse. Primary and PDX samples were then characterized for gene expression (by RNA-seq), DNA methylation (by RRBS), and chromatin accessibility (by ATAC-seq). All the data were integrated by multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA), followed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Finally, the immunological effects of epigenetic drugs and recombinant cytokines on primary and PDX-derived AML cells were tested in ex-vivo short-term cultures on a layer of mesenchymal stromal cells.\n\nResults: We verified that PDXs faithfully recapitulate immune-related differences between diagnosis and post-transplantation relapse, including loss of expression of HLA class II molecules. Separate analysis of each of the omics and their integration by MOFA concordantly evidenced that the relapse-specific features were mainly explained by decreased chromatin accessibility in immune-related genes, with a very limited role of DNA methylation. GSEA highlighted that chromatin changes overlapped with known target of EZH2, the enzymatic subunit of the polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2), and that this epigenetic signature was shared by a number of patients at relapse. Consistently, we evidenced closed chromatin status at HLA class II genes and their regulators in relapse samples. To revert these changes, relapse samples with downregulated expression of HLA class II were tested in ex-vivo with a panel of compounds targeting different subunits of PRC2. PRC2 inhibition reduced the levels of the repressor mark H3K27me3 and increased the surface expression of HLA class II molecules. Notably, these effects were even more pronounced when PRC2 inhibition was combined with IFN-g treatment, recovering leukemia recognition by CD4+ T cells and suggesting synergism between reverting epigenetic changes and cytokines released by immune cells upon target recognition.\n\nConclusions: Our results provide mechanistic links between epigenetic regulation and immune escape, and pave the way for testing PRC2 inhibition as an innovative strategy for the treatment of AML post-transplantation relapses.\n\nClinical Trial Registry: None.\n\nDisclosure: No disclosure.\n\nO015.

IKZF1 gene defects may be detected in up to 50% of BCP-ALL in adults and are associated with inferior outcome. The goal of this retrospective study based on EBMT registry was to evaluate outcome of allo-HCT in this population and to identify prognostic factors.\n\nMethods: This was a retrospective study based on EBMT registry. Adult patients with ALL harboring IKZF-1 gene mutations, treated with first allo-HCT between 2015 and 2018 were eligible.\n\nResults: Ninety-five patients transplanted in first (n = 75) or second (n = 20) complete remission (CR) from either HLA-matched sibling (n = 32), unrelated (n = 47) or haploidentical (n = 16) donor, were included in the analysis. Median recipient age was 41 years. Forty-six (48%) patients had Ph(+) ALL. Status of minimal residual disease (MRD) prior to transplantation was reported as positive (n = 42), negative (n = 38) or unknown (n = 15).\n\nThe probabilities of the overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 2 years were 55% and 47%, respectively. Relapse incidence was 32% while non-relapse mortality (NRM), 21%. The incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD and chronic GVHD was 34% and 30%, respectively. The probability of GVHD and relapse-free survival (GRFS) was 35%.\n\nIn a univariate analysis the probability of LFS at two years was 71% for patients in molecular remission compared to 23% for those with detectable MRD (p = 0.002), while OS rates were 75% and 40%, respectively (p = 0.02). Relapse incidence at two years according to MRD status equaled 12% vs. 55%, respectively (p = 0.002). Both LFS and OS rates were higher for patients transplanted in CR1 than CR2 (53% vs. 27%, p = 0.003 and 61% vs. 37%, p = 0.02, respectively). LFS rates were comparable for patients with Ph(+) and Ph(-) ALL (55% vs. 41%, p = 0.51).\n\nMultivariate analysis was restricted to 80 patients with known MRD status at allo-HCT. MRD-positive status was associated with decreased chance of LFS (HR=3.15, p = 0.004) and OS (HR=2.37, p = 0.049) as well as increased risk of relapse (HR=5.87, p = 0.003). Disease stage (CR2 vs. CR1) affected all, LFS (p = 0.0003), OS (p = 0.003), GRFS (p = 0.007), the risk of relapse (p = 0.02) and NRM (p = 0.003). In addition, the risk of NRM was decreased with increasing year of transplantation (p = 0.005).\n\nConclusions: Patients with BCP-ALL and IKZF1 mutation may benefit from allo-HCT performed in CR1. Results of allo-HCT are enhancing provided that MRD negative status is achieved. Patients with detectable MRD have poor prognosis and therefore require additional intervention prior to transplantation.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to declare.\n\nO016. The Value of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia with and without ASXL1-, RUNX1- and TP53 Mutations\n\nKatharina Heidrich1, Jan Moritz Middeke1, Kerstin Schäfer-Eckart2, Walter E Aulitzky3, Hermann Einsele4, Carsten Müller-Tidow5, Wolf Rösler6, Mathias Hänel7, Claudia D Baldus8, Lars Fransecky8, Friedrich Stölzel1, Christoph Röllig1, Franziska Taube1, Michael Kramer1, Sebastian Stasik1, Andreas Neubauer9, Andreas Burchert9, Wolfgang E Berdel10, Matthias Stelljes10, Gesine Bug11, Gerhard Ehninger1, Martin Bornhäuser1,12, Christian Thiede1, Johannes Schetelig1\n\n1Universitätsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany, 2Klinikum Nürnberg, Nürnberg, Germany, 3Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus, Stuttgart, Germany, 4Universitätsklinikum Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany, 5Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany, 6Universitätsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany, 7Klinikum Chemnitz, Chemnitz, Germany, 8Universitätsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany, 9Universitätsklinikum Marburg, Marburg, Germany, 10University Hospital Muenster, Münster, Germany, 11Medizinische Klinik 2, Universitätsklinikum Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany, 12National Center for Tumor Diseases, Dresden, Germany\n\nBackground: The ELN guidelines propose risk-adapted consolidation strategies for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with recurrent mutations, e.g. RUNX1, ASXL1 and TP53. The latter were introduced as high-risk mutations into the 2017 revision of the ELN classification. So far, no data has been published whether patients who are only classified as high risk based on mutations in RUNX1, ASXL1 and TP53, benefit from consolidation with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT).\n\nMethods: To address this question, we re-analyzed samples of 312 AML patients who had achieved a first complete remission (CR1) and were classified as intermediate risk based on ELN 2017 criteria, with NGS-based targeted sequencing. Patient age ranged between 18-60 years. All patients were treated within randomized controlled trials on intensive induction chemotherapy of the Study Alliance Leukemia (AML96, {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT 00180115\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00180115\"}}NCT 00180115; AML 2003, {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00180102\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00180102\"}}NCT00180102; SORAML, {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00893373\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00893373\"}}NCT00893373). Altogether 145 patients received alloHCT in CR1 and 75 patients after hematologic relapse. We performed Cox regression models to compare outcomes of patients with and without ASXL1-, RUNX1- and TP53 mutations. To evaluate the effect of alloHCT on OS and RFS, we tested alloHCT as a time-dependent covariate in a multivariable model including age, white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase and AML type (de novo versus secondary versus therapy-related myeloid neoplasia) as adjusting covariates and displayed OS and RFS by means of Simon-Makuch-Plots.\n\nResults: We identified 77 cases of AML with high-risk mutations (35 RUNX1-, 22 ASXL1-, 12 concordant ASXL1- and RUNX1-, and eight TP53-mutant cases of AML). These patients were re-classified as high-risk according to ELN 2017.\n\nAt 5 years from study inclusion, both RFS (38%, 95%CI 28 to 50%, versus 37%, 95%CI 31 to 44%) and OS (47%, 95%CI 37 to 60%, versus 50%, 95%CI 44 to 57%) did not differ significantly between patients with and without high-risk mutations irrespective of postremission treatment.\n\nFor patients with AML and ASXL1-, RUNX1-, or TP53 mutations who received alloHCT in CR1, we observed a statistically significant benefit in terms of RFS (HR 0.4, 95%CI 0.23 to 0.69, p=0.001) and a trend towards better OS (HR 0.56, 95%CI 0.31 to 1.01, p=0.053) compared with postremission chemotherapy. Patients with AML without these high risk mutations also benefited from alloHCT in terms of RFS (HR 0.47, 95%CI 0.33 to 0.66, p=0.001) and showed a trend to better OS (HR 0.73, 95%CI 0.51 to 1.05, p=0.093).\n\nConclusions: Our data supports the recommendation to offer alloHCT as consolidation therapy for fit patients with ELN 2017 intermediate risk and high-risk AML in CR1. Further studies in larger cohorts are warranted to study the effect of ASXL1-, RUNX1-, or TP53 mutations outside the context of high-risk karyotype abnormalities.\n\n[Simon Makuch Plots on relapse free (RFS) and overall survival (OS).]\n\nClinical Trial Registry:\n\nAML96 https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/{\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00180115\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00180115\"}}NCT00180115\n\nAML 2003 https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/{\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00180102\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00180102\"}}NCT00180102\n\nSORAML https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/{\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00893373\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00893373\"}}NCT00893373\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to declare.\n\nO017.

Median age at transplant was 55 years (18-77 years). The KPS score was 80% in 85% of the patients and < 80% in 15% of the patients. Cytogenetic risk was good, intermediate or poor in 6%, 68% and 26% of the patients, respectively. Donor type was sibling (MSD), matched (10/10 UD), mismatched (9/10 UD) unrelated, haploidentical (haplo) or cord blood (CB) in 47%, 35%, 8%, 6% and 4% of patients, respectively. Conditioning was myeloablative (MAC) or reduced-intensity (RIC) in 42% and 58% of patients, respectively. Stem cell source was PBSC or BM in 84% and 14% of the patients, respectively. Non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse incidence (RI) at 2 years were 19% and 27%, respectively. Notably, in the subgroup of patients with KPS < 80% NRM rate was as high as 27% (23-31%). Leukemia-free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS) and GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) rates were 54%, 59% and 41%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, transplant from a MSD was associated with a reduced risk of aGvHD (p < 10−4) and NRM (p < 10−3) as compared to all other donor types. Transplant from 10/10 UD was associated with lower GRFS (HR 1.2, p = 0.03), while 9/10 UD predicted inferior LFS, OS and GRFS (p < 0.001) as compared to MSD. Patients with KPS score of 80% had significantly lower NRM and improved survival as compared to patients with KPS< 80% (NRM: HR 0.6, p < 10-4; OS: HR 0.7, p < 10−4). Notably, administration of ATG was associated with reduced risk of developing grade II-IV aGVHD (p < 10−4), cGVHD (p < 10−4), severe cGVHD (p < 10−4) and with improved GRFS (p < 0.01). In the group of patients with a KPS score of 80%, a RIC regimen was associated with higher RI (p < 0.01), higher incidence of severe cGVHD (p < 0.001), and inferior GRFS (p < 0.001) as compared to MAC. NRM was not significantly different following RIC or MAC in this population. In contrast, in patients with a KPS score < 80%, RIC was associated with lower NRM (p < 0.0001) and better LFS (p < 0.01), OS (p < 0.0001) and GRFS (p < 0.01) as compared to MAC.\n\nConclusions: Allo-SCT is feasible in patients with AML in CR1 and KPS score < 80%, with acceptable NRM and survival rates. As for the conditioning regimen, in patients with a KPS score of 80% a MAC regimen was associated with lower relapse rate, similar NRM and better GRFS as compared to RIC, while in patients with a KPS score lower than 80% RIC was associated with reduced NRM and improved OS as compared to MAC. In addition, transplant from a MSD was associated with reduced risk of NRM and aGVHD rates as compared to other donor types. Finally, administration of ATG correlated with reduced acute and chronic GVHD and improved GRFS.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to declare.\n\nO018. RIC Combined with Anti-Thymocyte Globulin and Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide Provides Higher GVHD-Free/Relapse Free Survival in Fit Young Adults with Acute Myeloid Leukemia\n\nMaria Queralt Salas1,2, Shiyi Chen2, Wilson Lam1,2, Zeyad Al-Shaibani1,2, Dennis (Dong Hwan) Kim1,2, Fotios V Michelis1,2, Ivan Pasic1,2, Armin Gerbitz1,2, Auro Viswabandya1,2, Jeffrey Howard Lipton1,2, Jonas Mattsson1,2, Arjun D. Law1,2\n\n1University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada, 2Princess Margaret Cancer Center, Toronto, Canada\n\nBackground: An ideal conditioning platform should maximize anti-leukemia cytotoxicity and potentiate the graft-versus leukemia effect while minimizing transplant-related toxicity. The selection of the intensity of the conditioning regimen is tailored according to age and comorbidities. However, the optimal age cut-off is not well determined because age is an imprecise determinant of medical fitness. Moreover, with the refinement of HLA-typing, GVHD prophylaxis and supportive care, TRM in patients with comorbidities has decreased.\n\nWe aim to compare the outcome of alloHCT in adults with AML transplanted with RIC combined with dual T-cell depletion using anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) for GVHD prophylaxis with patients transplanted receiving myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens combined with standard GVHD prophylaxis.\n\nMethods: All adults with AML in complete remission who underwent MAC alloHCT (N = 111) between January 2013 to December 2018 were included in the analysis. Those adults younger than 60 years with an HCT-CI score < = 3 who underwent RIC alloHCT in combination with ATG-PTCY-CsA (N = 79) during the defined period of time were included in the analysis. Data was collected retrospectively and updated in July 2019.\n\nA propensity score matching was applied between both cohorts to reduce section bias and approximate a randomized trial. The goal was that both cohorts and matched individual pairs will have well balanced characteristics. Age, CD34 dose, frozen/fresh, disease stage (CR1, CR2-3), donor type and disease risk index (DRI) were entered into the multiple logistics regression (with group membership as the outcome) to create propensity score, which is the predicted probability of receiving RIC. 8à1 digit match technique was performed to find matched pairs.\n\nAll together 55 pairs of patients (N = 110) were finally included in the analysis. Paired t-tests were used to compare continuous variables and McNemar’s tests were used to compare categorical variables, taking into account the correlations between matched pairs. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare two groups in terms of OS, RFS and GRFS, whereas Fine and Gray competing risk models were used to compare outcomes including NRM and CIR.\n\nResults: Figure 1 summarizes baseline characteristics of patients included in the analysis and comparison over the two cohorts after applying the propensity score matching analysis. Results suggest that the two groups were very balanced after matching.\n\nThe cumulative incidence of acute and chronic GVHD was significantly lower in patients who deceived RIC alloHCT with ATG-PTCY-CsA.\n\nPatients who underwent RIC alloHCT combined with ATG-PTCY-CsA had a non-significant trend to better OS (p = 0.08) and RFS (P = 0.07), and a significantly lower NRM (P = 0.002) in comparison with patients who underwent MAC alloHCT. The differences on CIR between both approaches were not statistically significant (p = 0.51). Those patients who underwent RIC alloHCT with ATG-PTCY-CsA had a significantly higher GRFS (P < 0.001).\n\nConclusions: Dual T-cell depletion for GVHD prophylaxis in RIC alloHCT reduces clinically relevant GVHD improving GRFS in AML patients.\n\nBoth strategies provided comparable overall survival and cumulative incidence of relapse. However, RIC alloHSCT resulted in lower NRM in AML patients.\n\nClinical Trial Registry: No applicable.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to declare.\n\nO019. Low-Dose Memory Donor Lymphocyte Infusion After αβ T Cell-Depleted HSCT Among Children with High-Risk Leukemia: Results of a Prospective Randomized Single-Center Trial\n\nZhanna Shekhovtsova1, Maria Dunaikina1, Larisa Shelikhova1, Elena Osipova1, Dmitriy Pershin1, Dmitriy Balashov1, Elena Kurnikova1, Alexei Kazachenok1, Yakov Muzalevskii1, Maria Ilushina1, Rimma Khismatullina1, Julia Starichkova1, Galina Novichkova1, Alexei Maschan1, Michael Maschan1\n\n1Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Research Centre of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Москва, Russian Federation\n\nBackground: Depletion of αβ T lymphocytes is an established method of graft manipulation. Delayed recovery of adaptive immunity remains is an unresolved issue. To accelerate the recovery of immunity we proposed to use low doses of donor memory lymphocytes. We have report the results of a prospective randomized trial that tested safety and efficiency of low-dose memory DLI after αβ T cell-depleted HSCT among children with hematologic malignancies.\n\nMethods: A group of 149 patients were enrolled. Indications for HSCT were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 91), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 39), other high-risk malignancies (n = 19). Median age was 8.6 years (0.5-18) and m:f ratio was 1.5:1. Donors were haploidentical family among 137 (91%) cases and matched among 13(9%) cases. Conditioning regimen included either treosulfan at Σ42 g/m2 (n = 65) or total body irradiation at Σ12Gy(n = 84). All patients received thiotepa at Σ10mg/kg, fludarabine at Σ150mg/kg and bortezomib at 1.3mg/m2 on days -5,-2,+2,+5. Anti-thymocyte globulin serotherapy was abandoned. Tocilizumab at 8 mg/kg at day 0 and abatacept at 10 mg/kg at days 0,7,14 and 28 were administered instead. Grafts were derived from G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood and split into two parts. Part I was used to produce the primary graft by αβTCR/19+ depletion. Part II was depleted of CD45RA+ population to produce memory DLI. Patients were randomized at enrollment either to experimental or control arm. Experimental arm (n = 77) were scheduled to receive 25 × 103 CD3+CD45RO+ cells at day 0 and monthly infusions of 50x103 CD3+CD45RO+ on days 30, 60 and 90. Control arm (n = 73) received standard care. The primary endpoints were the cumulative incidence of acute GVHD grade II-IV and the cumulative incidence of CMV viremia.\n\nResults: One patient died due to septic shock before engraftment. A total of 148 patients were evaluable for engraftment at day 30. Engraftment rate was 98%, 97%(control) and 99%(experimental). The cumulative incidence of aGVHD grade II-IV was 14% in total population, 15%(experimental) and 14%(control), p-ns. The incidence of grade III-IV aGVHD was 8% (experimental) and 6%(control), p-ns. The cumulative incidence of CMV viremia was 55% in the control arm and 45% in the experimental arm, Gray’s, p = 0,3. The incidence of chronic GVHD was 6%, 5%(experimental) and 6%(control). The cumulative incidence of relapse was 21%, 22% (experimental) and 20%(control). Non-relapse mortality was 2%, 1% and 3% in the control and experimental arm, respectively. At a median follow-up of 1.5 years the event-free survival for all patients was 77 ± 4% and overall survival was 89 ± 3%. In the experimental arm the EFS and OS were 75% and 91%, while in the control arm EFS and OS were 79% and 87%, p = ns. There was a trend towards faster recovery of CMV-specific immunity in the experimental arm in a subcohort of CMV-seropositive recipients\n\nConclusions: Low-dose CD45RA-depleted DLI commenced at day of grafting were safe but insufficient to prevent CMV viremia.

All 149 consecutive first haplo-HCT with PTCy (50mg/kg on D+3 and D+4) reported by the 17 Brazilian participating centers of the Pediatric Working Group transplanted for HM were included.\n\nResults: The median age was 10 (0-18) years and 86 were transplanted for ALL, 58 for AML and 5 for MDS. HCTdonors were father (N=82), mother (N=51), or siblings (N=16). Most patients were in second complete remission (CR2; N=57) and in CR1 (N=38) followed by CR3+ and active/refractory disease (N=27 each). Most received a myeloablative conditioning (87%). In addition to PTCy, all patients received mycophenolate mofetil with either cyclosporine (79%) or tacrolimus (21%) for GVHD prophylaxis. Bone marrow (BM) was the stem cell source in 57%. Median follow up for surviving patients is 16 (5-84) months. Most achieved neutrophil engraftment (96%). Primary and secondary graft failure occurred in 5 and 4 patients respectively, and all received BM grafts. The cumulative incidence (CI) of non-relapse mortality at D+100 was 7.4%. At a median of 170 days after HCT, 38% of patients relapsed. The 1-year PFS was 52%: 70% in CR1, 50% in CR2 and 42% in CR3+ or active disease (p = 0.006). CI of acute GVHD grades II-IV was higher after PB grafts (45%) than after BM grafts (27%), (p = 0.02). CI of chronic GVHD at 1 year was higher after PB grafts from female (75%) than from male (21%) donors, as well as after BM from female (24%) than male donors (13%), both p < 0.001. The risk of cGVHD was higher after PB grafts than after BM grafts from a female donor (Hazards Ratio (HR)3.4; p < 0.01). In a multivariable analysis, risk associated with death were female donor (HR=1.9; p = 0.02) and disease status (p<0.001) and increased risk for cGVHD was the use of PBSC from a female donor (HR=6.9; p<0.001). The 1-year overall survival was 62% (95% CI, 54 to 70). Disease progression was the main cause of death (66%). Early mortality after haplo-HCT with PTCy in children with hematological malignancies was low. The 1-year PFS was above 50% with higher rates for those with lower disease risk. The use of PB grafts from female donors increased the risk of acute and of cGVHD.\n\nConclusions: Our results show that Haplo-HCT with PTCy for children without an HLA-matched donor is an alternative curative intervention for hematological malignancies. A retrospective comparative study of all allogeneic HCT performed in Brazil between 2014 and 2018 and reported to the CIBMTR from HLA matched sibling, unrelated and haploidentical donors is underway. Prospective studies using haploidentical donors with PTCy are necessary to determine if current HCT practices will be changed.\n\nDisclosure: All authors declare no conflict of interest related to this abstract.\n\nO021.

Here we compared outcomes of such patients given either allo-HCT or autologous (auto)-HCT.\n\nMethods: Inclusions criteria consisted of adult patients, de novo AML, isolated trisomy 8, first HCT between 2000 and 2018, CR1 at transplantation, and either auto-HCT or allo-HCT with a HLA-identical sibling donor (MSD) or a 10/10 HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD).\n\nResults: A total of 401 patients met the inclusion criteria. They were given auto-HCT (n = 81), allo-HCT with a MSD (n = 186) or allo-HCT with a MUD (n = 134). Median patient age was 52 years in auto-HCT recipients, 52 years in MSD recipients, and 55 years in MUD recipients. Median time from diagnosis to transplantation was 5.3 months in auto-HCT recipients, 4.5 months in MSD recipients and 5 months in MUD recipients (P = 0.001). At 3-year, nonrelapse mortality, relapse incidence, and leukemia-free survival (LFS) were 5%, 59%, and 37%, respectively, in auto-HCT recipients; 14% (P = 0.04), 31% (p < 0.001), and 55% (p = 0.033), respectively, in MSD recipients and 13% (P = 0.15), 29% (P < 0.001), and 59% (P = 0.03), respectively, in MUD recipients. The 180-day incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD was 22% in MSD versus 35% in MUD (P = 0.01) while 42% of MSD versus 43% of MUD recipients experienced chronic GVHD. In multivariate analysis, in comparison to auto-HCT, each MSD and MUD were associated with a lower risk of relapse (HR = 0.47, P < 0.001 and HR=0.40, P < 0.001, respectively) translating to better LFS (HR=0.69, P = 0.04 and HR = 0.60, P = 0.03, respectively). There was also a similar trend for overall survival (HR=0.73, P=12 and HR=0.65, p = 0.08).\n\nConclusions: In AML patients with isolated trisomy 8, allo-HCT in first CR with either a MSD or a MUD results in better LFS than auto-HCT, due to significantly lower risks of disease relapse.\n\nClinical Trial Registry: NA.\n\nDisclosure: NA.\n\nAplastic anaemia\n\nO022. LNP023 - A New Oral Complement Factor-B Inhibitor Normalizes Hemoglobin in Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria Patients with Poor Response to Eculizumab, Both as Add-on and Monotherapy\n\nAntonio M Risitano1, Alexander Roth2, Juliette Soret3, Camilla Frieri1, Flore Sicre de Fontbrune4, Luana Marano1, Izabella Rozenberg5, Julie Milojevic5, Peter End5, Prasanna K Nidamarthy6, Guido Junge5, Regis Peffault de Latour3,4\n\n1Federico II University, Naples, Italy, 2University Hospital, Essen, Germany, 3Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France, 4Frence Reference Center for AA & PNH, Paris, France, 5Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research (NIBR), Basel, Switzerland, 6Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research (NIBR), Hyderabad, India\n\nBackground: The treatment of hemolytic paroxysmal nocturnal hematuria (PNH) is based on anti-C5 antibodies resulting in control of intravascular hemolysis (IVH), leading to reduction of thromboembolic events and improved survival. However, 20-50% of patients remain transfusion-dependent due to persistent extravascular hemolysis (EVH), and further 20-40% exhibit different degree of residual anemia. LNP023 is a new, oral, selective and potent first-in-class factor B inhibitor, expected to block both IVH and EVH.\n\nMethods: CLNP023X2201 ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT03439839\",\"term_id\":\"NCT03439839\"}}NCT03439839) is a multicenter, open-label, sequential 2-cohort trial to assess the safety, efficacy, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics/-dynamics (PK/PD) of LNP023 in PNH patients with active hemolysis despite treatment with eculizumab. The primary objective is defined as the effect of LNP023, given add-on to eculizumab, on the reduction of hemolysis. Other endpoints include changes in hemoglobin (Hb), reticulocytes, C3-positive red blood cell (RBC), various hemolysis and complement markers, as well as PK/PD and safety/tolerability assessments. At 13 Weeks, patients could enter into a long-term study extension, which also included the possibility of modifying/discontinuing eculizumab treatment.\n\nResults: N=10 (3/7 female/male) PNH patients (25-79 years) with active hemolysis were enrolled and received LNP023 twice daily (BID) concomitant to eculizumab for at least 13 weeks. LNP023 was well tolerated; no treatment discontinuation, no treatment-related serious adverse event (SAE) nor thromboembolic events have been reported. All patients required RBC transfusions prior to LNP023 therapy. At baseline (prior to LNP023 treatment) mean values for LDH (539 U/L), reticulocytes (199 10^9/L), bilirubin (39.2 umol/L), free hemoglobin (28.7 g/L) were increased, while values for Hb (97.7 g/L), RBC (2.7 10^12/L), and haptoglobin (<0.2 g/L) were decreased. At week 13, LNP023 demonstrated meaningful improvement of LDH in all patients with a reduction of 34-81%, and transfusion-free Hb normalization in all (100%) female subjects and 71% males achieved Hb >120 g/L (mean Hb change from baseline 31.9 g/L; 90% CI 23.4-40.3), and normalization of all biomarkers of hemolytic disease activity. The remarkable effect on both IVH and EVH was confirmed by disappearance of C3 deposition on, and increased size of the PNH RBC population (48.4 ± 32.3 vs. 92.5 ± 34.9 %RBC at BL vs. Week 13), confirming the prolonged survival of affected RBC. All patients entered into the LNP023 extension treatment; with a mean LNP023 exposure of 241 (92-392) days, no patient required RBC transfusion. At the time of the data lock point, 5 patients have already discontinued eculizumab treatment: even on LNP023 monotherapy, all of them retained their hemoglobin levels, with no change in any biomarker of disease activity and no sign/symptom of breakthrough hemolysis.\n\nConclusions: LNP023 is a new, well-tolerated oral factor B inhibitor that blocks IVH and EVH in patients with hemolytic PNH with poor response to eculizumab, leading to marked improvement up to normalization of Hb and all biomarkers of disease activity. The observed efficacy was retained even in monotherapy, demonstrating the redundancy of terminal complement inhibition in presence of complete and sustained proximal complement inhibition. These data anticipate that oral, single-agent, treatment with LNP023 represents an emerging therapeutic option aiming to change the treatment paradigm of hemolytic PNH.\n\nClinical Trial Registry: {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT03439839\",\"term_id\":\"NCT03439839\"}}NCT03439839\n\nDisclosure: Antonio Maria Risitano and Regis Peffault de Latour have received consultancy, honoraria and research funding from Novartis.\n\nIzabela Rozenberg, Julie Milojevic, Peter End, Prasanna K.

Epigenetic Aging After Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation is Associated with Poor Survival in Patients with Severe Aplastic Anemia: Results from DNA-Methylation Grimage\n\nRotana Alsaggaf1, Shilpa Katta1, Stephen Spellman2, Tao Wang3, Belynda D. Hicks1, Youjin Wang1, Sharon A. Savage1, Bin Zhu1, Stephanie J. Lee4, Steve Horvath5, Shahinaz M. Gadalla1\n\n1National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States, 2Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Minneapolis, MN, United States, 3Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, United States, 4Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, United States, 5University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, United States\n\nBackground: Biological aging in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is important in the context of immune reconstitution and age-related complications. Several DNA-methylation (DNAm) based biomarkers of aging known as “epigenetic clocks” have been introduced as novel tools to predict biological age. Most recently, the DNAm “GrimAge” (DNAm-GrimAge) clock, a composite biomarker of seven lifespan-associated plasma proteins, smoking pack-years, and chronological age, has been shown to outperform previous DNAm clocks in predicting mortality. Here, we explored the possible associations of donor pre-HCT DNAm-GrimAge and early post-HCT changes in DNAm-GrimAge with post-HCT survival among severe aplastic anemia (SAA) patients.\n\nMethods: This study is part of the Transplant Outcomes in Aplastic Anemia (TOAA) Project, an ongoing collaboration between the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research and the National Cancer Institute aiming to identify molecular predictors of transplant outcomes in patients with SAA. This study included 732 patients who underwent unrelated-donor HCT and for whom donor pre-HCT blood samples were available; 41 patients had a post-HCT sample collected at day 100. We used Illumina Infinium whole-genome MethylationEPIC array data to calculate DNAm-GrimAge and DNAm-GrimAge acceleration (a measure of the deviation from expected biological age relative to chronological age). For statistical analyses, we used Cox proportional hazards regression models.\n\nResults: Median donor chronological age was 33.6 years (interquartile range [IQR]=14.2). Donor DNAm-GrimAge was highly correlated with chronological age (R2 = 0.7, p < 0.001). In multivariable analyses adjusted for recipient age and race, transplant year, conditioning regimen, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), HLA match, and disease subtype, the effects of donor chronological age and pre-HCT DNAm-GrimAge on post-HCT survival were similar (hazard ratio [HR]=1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.00-1.03, p = 0.07 and HR = 1.01, 95% CI = 1.00-1.03, p = 0.08, respectively). Results from DNAm-GrimAge acceleration showed a small deviation from expected (median = -0.5, IQR=5.1 years), with no statistically significant linear relationship with post-HCT survival (HR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.97-1.04, p = 0.80) after further adjusting for donor chronological age. Notably, though we observed no statistically significant association between extreme donor DNAm-GrimAge acceleration (10+ years) and survival post-HCT (HR = 1.39, 95% CI = 0.67-2.86, p = 0.39), the elevated HR warrants further exploration. In patients with a post-HCT sample at day 100, a significant increase in DNAm-GrimAge post-HCT was noted (median difference post-HCT vs. pre-HCT=12.5 years, IQR=7.0). Increased DNAm-GrimAge post-HCT (15+ years) was associated with inferior survival (HR=4.57, 95%CI=1.81-11.51, p = 0.001) after adjusting for donor age, conditioning regimen and KPS. The excess mortality risk was most significant in the first year post-HCT (HR at < or = 12 months=17.07, 95% CI=2.09-139.69, p = 0.008; HR at >12months=2.07, 95% CI=0.52-8.18 p = 0.30). Patients whose DNAm-GrimAge increased 15+ years post-HCT were more likely to die of infection (33% vs. 11%) and primary disease (17% vs. 0%) compared with those with < 15 years of aging. Exploratory analyses suggested donor sex, recipient sex, and KPS may be associated with accelerated post-HCT aging.\n\nConclusions: Donor DNAm-GrimAge pre-HCT did not provide a better prediction of survival post-HCT over chronological age in patients with SAA. Significant DNAm aging post-HCT was associated with poor survival, predominantly within the first year post-HCT.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to declare.\n\nO024.

Marqués de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain, 21Baskent University Hospital, Adana, Turkey, 22Federico II University of Naples, Napoli, Italy, 23Hopital St. Louis, Paris, France\n\nBackground: Survival after Allo-HSCT for severe idiopathic aplastic anemia (SAA) has improved over past 20 years, approaching 75% at 5 years. However, beyond survival, a SAA-adapted composite endpoint GVHD and relapse free survival (GRFS) may more accurately assess patient outcomes, becoming a meaningful study endpoint. We analyzed GRFS aiming to identify risk factors and specific causes of GRFS failure.\n\nMethods: This retrospective analysis from the SAAWP Data Quality Initiative (DQI registry database) program of EBMT included patients with: diagnosis of idiopathic SAA; first Allo-HSCT from 2005 to 2016; and matched related (MRD) or unrelated donor (UD) (no cord blood). Relevant events for Kaplan-Meier calculation of GRFS were: relapse (including primary and secondary graft failure); grade 3-4 acute GVHD; extensive chronic GVHD; and death. In addition, we used a competing-risk model to analyze cumulative incidences of specific causes of GRFS failure.\n\nResults: We analyzed 580 patients (385 adults and 195 younger than 18 years), with a median age of 23 years (< 0.1-77). Donor was matched related and unrelated in MRD and 243 patients, respectively. Median time from diagnosis to Allo-HSCT was 6 months (<1-444) and 310 (53%) patients underwent Allo-HSCT without prior treatment. GRFS at 5 years was 69% (65-73) in the whole cohort. Median follow up was 59 months (2-165). Multivariate cox model including age (continuous), graft source, conditioning intensity, sex mismatch, CMV-serostatus, donor type, time from diagnosis to Allo-HSCT (< vs. > 6 months) and previous treatment before Allo-HSCT showed that age (HR=1.02, [1.01-1.03], p < 0.001) and CMV serostatus other than negative-donor to negative-recipient [D-/R-] (HR=1.51, [1.02-2.23], p = 0.041) were the only independent factors associated with worse GRFS. Using cause specific cox model, we analyzed the risk of the different causes of GRFS failure and found that CMV-serostatus other than D-/R- was associated with higher risk of graft failure/relapse (HR=2.88, [1.12-7.38], p = 0.028) while age influenced the risk of grade 3-4 acute GVHD (HR=1.03, [1.00-1.05], p = 0.043), extensive chronic GVHD (HR=1.03, [1.01-1.06], p = 0.008) and death without prior failure (HR=1.03, [1.01-1.04], p < 0.001).\n\nAmong the 209 patients who underwent upfront Allo-HSCT from a MRD, 5-year GRFS was 77% (71-84). In multivariate analysis, time from diagnosis to Allo-HSCT (HR=2.64, [1.38-5.03], p = 0.003) and age (HR=1.03, [1.00-1.05], p = 0.039) independently influenced GRFS. When investigating the causes of GRFS failure in this subset of patients who underwent upfront MRD Allo-HSCT, time from diagnosis to Allo-HSCT was the only remaining factors significantly associated with the risk of death without prior failure (HR=0.29, [0.10-0.84], p = 0.022). No factor was found specifically associated with any other causes of GRFS failure.\n\nConclusions: We observed 5-year GRFS of 69%, meaning that most of patients who underwent Allo-HSCT for idiopathic SAA are cured without experiencing severe forms of acute and chronic GVHD. In the context of upfront MRD Allo-HSCT, GRFS was even more promising (77%). In this particular setting, time from diagnosis to Allo-HSCT was the most important factor influencing GRFS, suggesting the need to proceed to Allo-HSCT as quick as possible when a MRD is available.\n\nDisclosure: Regis Peffault de la Tour: research grant and honorarium speaker fees from alexion, novartis, amgen and pfizer.\n\nO025.

Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS). EFS was defined as survival without graft failure, relapse and post-transplant malignancy. Secondary endpoints were grade II-IV acute GvHD (aGvHD), chronic GvHD (cGvHD) and graft failure. Subgroup differences in OS and EFS were evaluated by log-rank test. Competing risks methods were used for the cumulative incidence of acute and chronic GVHD, with competing events death, graft failure, relapse and second transplant. Subgroup differences in cGvHD and aGvHD were evaluated by Gray’s test. All estimates are reported with 95% confidence intervals.\n\nResults: Median age at transplant was 8 years (range, 1-16) and median follow-up was 5.7 years (5.2 - 6.3). Median interval between diagnosis and HCT was 2.4 years (range, 0.03-12.7). Eleven patients (8%) had pre-transplant malignancy (3 acute leukaemia; 8 MDS/MPD). Conditioning regimen was Fludarabine/Cyclophosphamide (n = 95; 73%), Busulfan/Cyclophosphamide/Fludarabine or others (n = 35, 27%). Ten (7.7%) received TBI. Donors were matched family (MFD; n = 43, 33%), matched unrelated (MUD; n = 24, 19%), mismatched unrelated (MMUD; n = 19; 14%) or unrelated donor with no HLA results (UD; n = 44, 34%). Stem cell source was bone marrow (n = 83, 65%), peripheral blood (n = 22, 17%) or cord blood (CB; n = 18, 14%) or BM and CB (n = 5, 4%). The CI of primary or secondary engraftment failure was 9% (4-14%). CI of secondary malignancy at 5-year post-HCT was 2% (0-4%).\n\nThe 5-year OS and EFS were 83% (95% CI, 77-90%) and 77% (69-85%). Increasing age was associated with lower OS (HR: 1.14, 1-1.29, p=0.05) and EFS (HR 1.11, 0.98-1.26, p = 0.1). MMUD (56%, 34-79%) was associated with inferior 5-year OS compared to MFD (90%, 81-99%), MUD (88%, 74-100%), UD (86%, 75-96%) (p=0.006). MMUD (43%, 15-71%) was associated with significantly lower EFS versus MFD (83%, 71-9%) or MUD (88%, 73-100%) or UD (78%, 64-91%). CB was associated with lower OS (60%, 35-85% vs BM: 85%, 77-93% vs PB: 86%, 72-100%) (p=0.07) and EFS (51%, 25-78% vs BM: 79%, 68-89% vs PB: 84%, 68-100%) (p=0.07). Conditioning had no association with OS and EFS.\n\nCI of grade II-IV aGvHD at day 100 and cGvHD at 1 year were 38% (29-43%) and 14% (8-20%). Younger age had higher rate of aGvHD (HR=0.91 (0.83-1.0), p = 0.05) but had no association with cGvHD (HR 1.07, 0.93-1.22, p=0.33). Rate of aGvHD was significantly lower in MFD (20%, 8-32% vs MUD: 59%, 39-80% vs MMUD: 44%, 21-67% vs UD: 40%, CI 26-55%) (p=0.04). Donor type had no impact on cGvHD. FluCy had lower rates of aGvHD (28%, 19-37% vs FluBuCy/others: 64%, 47-80%, p< 0.001) and cGvHD (11%, 4-17% vs FluBuCy/others (35%, 19-51%), p=0.002). Stem cell source was not associated with aGvHD and cGVHD.\n\nConclusions: Younger age was associated with better survival.

Reduced Intensity Conditioning is Effective for Hematopoietic stem Cell Transplantation in Patients with Diamond-Blackfan ANEMIA\n\nShun Koyamaishi1, Takuya Kamio1, Akie Kobayashi1, Tomohiko Sato1, Ko Kudo1, Shinya Sasaki1, Rika Kanezaki1, Daiichiro Hasegawa2, Hideki Muramatsu3, Yoshiyuki Takahashi3, Yoji Sasahara4, Hidefumi Hiramatsu5, Harumi Kakuda6, Miyuki Tanaka7, Masataka Ishimura8, Masanori Nishi9, Akira Ishiguro10, Hiromasa Yabe11, Kenichi Yoshida5, Hitoshi Kanno12, Shouichi Ohga8, Akira Ohara13, Seiji Kojima3, Satoru Miyano14, Seishi Ogawa5, Tsutomu Toki1, Kiminori Terui1, Etsuro Ito1\n\n1Hirosaki University, Hirosaki, Japan, 2Prefectural Kobe Children’s Hospital, Kobe, Japan, 3Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan, 4Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, 5Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, 6Chiba Children’s Hospital, Chiba, Japan, 7Shinshu University, Matsumoto, Japan, 8Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan, 9Saga University, Saga, Japan, 10National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan, 11Tokai University, Isehara, Japan, 12Tokyo Women’s Medical University, Tokyo, Japan, 13Toho University, Tokyo, Japan, 14University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan\n\nBackground: Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by red cell aplasia and congenital anomalies. Patients with transfusion-dependent DBA who are unresponsive to corticosteroids can undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as a curative therapy. Successful results were recently reported in DBA patients who underwent HSCT using a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen. However, there are limited data for determining the optimal conditioning regimen for patients with DBA.\n\nMethods: The aims were to evaluate the outcomes of myeloablative conditioning (MAC) versus RIC regimens in DBA patients in Japan. To evaluate the clinical course of DBA, we sent questionnaires to the physicians of the DBA patients enrolled in our cohort between 2000 and 2018.\n\nResults: Our DBA cohort consists of 187 patients. We performed genetic analysis in all 187 patients, of whom 117 (62.6%) had heterozygous mutations in one of the ribosomal genes. Completed questionnaires were returned from the physicians of 165 of the patients (88.2% response rate). The median age of these 165 patients at the time of diagnosis was 0.917 (range 0-47) years. The median follow-up duration after diagnosis was 7.33 years, and 13 patients (7.9%) were observed for more than 25 years. HSCT was performed in 27 patients (16.4%), of whom 25 (92.6%) became treatment independent. The median age at the time of HSCT was 3.58 (range 1.08-11.7) years. The median follow-up time after HSCT was 3.33 (range 0.667-12.8) years. Transplantation sources were bone marrow in 25 patients (from HLA-matched sibling donors in 5, HLA-mismatched related donors in 2, HLA-matched unrelated donors in 13, and HLA-mismatched unrelated donors in 5) and cord blood in 2 patients (from HLA-mismatched unrelated donors). MAC regimens were used in 13 patients, and RIC regimens with and without busulfan in 2 and 12 patients, respectively. Engraftment was successful in all 27 patients who underwent HSCT. One patient achieved neutrophil recovery and transfusion independency despite secondary graft failure. One patient with mixed chimerism became transfusion dependent, and one patient developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after HSCT. Three patients who underwent HSCT using a MAC regimen developed sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS). Acute (Grade II-IV) and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) incidences were 48.1% and 40.7%, respectively. The 3-year overall survival (OS) and failure-free survival (FFS) rates post-transplantation were 95.2% and 92.6%, respectively, and showed no significant differences between the MAC and RIC regimens (OS: 100% vs. 92.3%, p = 0.433; FFS: 92.3% vs. 92.9%, p = 0.979).\n\nConclusions: Our data suggest that HSCT using a RIC regimen is effective to obtain engraftment with a low toxicity and excellent FFS for DBA patients.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to declare.\n\nAutoimmune diseases\n\nO027. Beam vs Cyclophosphamide-Based Conditioning Regimen in Aggressive Multiple Sclerosis: A Retrospective Analysis of European Blood and Marrow Transplantation Society\n\nRiccardo Saccardi1, Manuela Badoglio2, Joachim Burman3, Grzegorz Helbig4, Chiara Innocenti1, Majid Kazmi5, Giovanni Luigi Mancardi6, John Moore7, Paolo Muraro8, Basil Sharrack9, Marek Smilowski10, Maria Pia Sormani6, John A.

Autologous HSCT was shown to induce a high rate of sustained, treatment-free remissions in cases of aggressive MS. Optimal intensity of Conditioning Regimen (CR) in terms of both toxicity and efficacy is still to be clarified. In EBMT Registry the most frequently used CR were BEAM + ATG (BEAM) or HD-Cyclophosphamide + ATG (CYC). Overall TRM was low (1.4%), but slightly higher in BEAM over CYC. Here we retrospectively analyzed the neurological outcome of 603 MS patients who underwent autologous HSCT following either BEAM or CYC regimens.\n\nMethods: Patient data were extracted from both the EBMT database and a disease-specific database developed by the EBMT Autoimmune Diseases Working Party (ADWP). Patients were selected for having received either BEAM or CYC and the availability of major neurological variables at both baseline and follow-up. MS forms at HSCT were reported as Relapsing-Remitting (RR), Secondary Progressive (SP), Primary Progressive (PP) and Progressive-Relapsing (PR). The impact of variables related to both patients (age, gender, EDSS at HSCT) and MS form at HSCT were also evaluated. Endpoints were failure to maintain a NEDA (Non-Evidence of Disease Activity) status, incidence of clinical relapses and/or progression of disability.\n\nResults: Number of CYC procedures was higher (331 vs 272, respectively). Gender distribution was similar (p=ns), whilst mean age was higher in CYC patients over BEAM (38.3 vs 36.5, p = 0.02). RR forms at baseline were more frequent in CYC group (p = 0.004) as well as incidence of Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline (47.2% vs 35.5%, p = 0.004). Mean disability at baseline, assessed through the EDSS index, was significantly higher in BEAM over CYC (5.1±1.7 vs 4.8±1.7, p = 0.03), with no differences in the number of relapses in the 2 years before HSCT (0.41±0.49 vs 0.39±0.48, p=ns). Analysis of NEDA failures didn’t show any significant differences between the two groups, also when RR and Progressive patients were analyzed separately. Comparison of relapse incidence was also not significant whilst CYC-treated patients showed an advantage over BEAM in progressive patients in terms of both overall disability worsening (p = 0.01) and continuous progression after HSCT (p = 0.01).\n\nConclusions: The non-myeloablative regimen CYC-ATG has become the most common conditioning regimen despite a lack of comparative data with more intense regimens. In our retrospective analysis of the two most frequent conditioning regimens in the EBMT Registry, there was no significant difference in terms of prevention of relapses, whilst the CYC regimen showed a slight advantage over BEAM in Progressive patients in terms of disability progression. The overall low incidence of relapses and the retrospective character of this analysis prevent to draw conclusions in terms of capability of the two conditioning regimens to restore the self-tolerance in MS. A prospective comparative trial is likely needed in order to provide a reliable information for this still unanswered question\n\nDisclosure: No disclosures.\n\nO028. A Novel Targeted Approach to Achieve Immune System Reset: CD45-targeted Antibody Drug Conjugates Ameliorate Disease in Preclinical Autoimmune Disease Models and Enable AutoHSCT\n\nGeoffrey Gillard, Jennifer Proctor, Melissa Brooks, Tahirih Lamothe, Sharon Hyzy, Sean McDonough, Nicholas Clark, Rahul Palchaudhuri, Anjali Bhat, Ganapathy Sarma, Prashant Bhattarai, Pranoti Sawant, Bradley Pearse, Charlotte McDonagh, Anthony Boitano, Michael Cooke\n\nMagenta Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA, United States\n\nBackground: Resetting the immune system through autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (autoHSCT) is a highly effective treatment in selected patients with autoimmune diseases. AutoHSCT can induce long-term remission (up to 15 years) with 80% progression free survival in multiple sclerosis patients (Muraro 2017, Burt 2019). Likewise, use of autoHSCT in scleroderma patients has achieved superior outcomes in two randomized studies compared to standard of care (Tyndall 2014, Sullivan 2018). These impressive results are achieved by a combination of the eradication of autoreactive immune effector cells and re-establishment of self-tolerance, i.e., immune system reset. However, only a small fraction of eligible patients undergo autoHSCT, largely due to toxicity associated with current conditioning protocols.\n\nMethods: As part of our goal to reduce the toxicity of transplant conditioning, we have generated novel anti-human CD45 ADCs that cross react with nonhuman primates (NHP) and evaluated these for the ability to deplete hematopoietic and immune cells in vitro and in vivo in humanized NSG (hNSG) mice and NHPs. To model the transplant approach in mouse models of AID, we generated an anti-mouse CD45 ADC and evaluated the capacity of this ADC to enable immune reset and ameliorate autoimmune disease.\n\nResults: The anti-human CD45-ADC showed efficient killing of human BM CD34+ (EC50 2.44 × 10−9 M) and peripheral CD3+ cells from a healthy donor (EC50 7.6 x10−10 M) and patients with MS (EC50 1.5 × 10−10 M) (Fig. 1A). In hNSG, single doses of the CD45-ADC were well-tolerated and led to substantial (>95%) depletion of human cells. (Fig. 1B). In NHPs, single doses of CD45-ADC were well tolerated and achieved >90% peripheral lymphocyte depletion and >80% depletion of HSCs (Fig. 1C). Finally, administration of a single dose of anti-human CD45-ADC to hNSGs with sclerodermatous xenoGVHD resulted in depletion of human T cells and resolution of symptoms (Fig. 1D).\n\nA single-dose of the anti-mouse CD45-ADC enabled full myeloablation (>99% depletion of LT-HSCs) and complete donor chimerism with congenic HSCT (>90% chimerism at 16 weeks). In a murine model of MS, EAE, a single dose of the CD45-ADC followed by congenic HSCT enabled full donor chimerism; treatment prior to disease onset significantly delayed disease onset and reduced disease severity. In a murine model of arthritis, proteoglycan-induced arthritis (PGIA), therapeutic treatment with a single dose of the CD45-ADC followed by congenic HSCT enabled complete donor chimerism and halted disease progression, comparable to what was achieved with repeated doses of anti-TNFα. These data demonstrate that CD45-ADC conditioning followed by congenic HSCT is sufficient for full myeloablation and immune reset. Additional experiments are ongoing, and evaluation of this ADC in a murine model of diabetes will be presented.\n\nConclusions: These results suggest that targeted immune depletion with a single dose of CD45-ADC may be sufficient to enable auto-HSCT and immune reset in multiple AID indications without toxic side effects. Targeted conditioning with CD45-ADC may represent a better tolerated approach for removing disease-causing cells as part of immune reset through autoHSCT and may significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with current conditioning.\n\nDisclosure: All authors are employees and hold equity in Magenta Therapeutics.\n\nO029. Long Term Follow up of Systemic Sclerosis French Patients Included in the Astis Trial Using Scot Trial Global Rank Composite Score (GRCS)\n\nNassim Ait Abdallah1,2, Mianbo Wang3, Zora Marjanovic2,4, Pauline Lansiaux1,2, Catney Charles2, Fanny.

The largest ASTIS (phase III)[1] and SCOT (phase II)[2] randomised trials used similar inclusion criteria and control arms, but different primary endpoints to assess the overall response with respectively: the ASTIS event-free survival (EFS) at 2 years and the SCOT global rank composite score (GRCS) at 54 months.\n\nObjective: To asses the 5 year efficacy of AHSCT vs iv pulse Cyclophosphamide in all French patients initially included in ASTIS after extended follow-up in the MATHEC cohort using the SCOT-GRCS.\n\nMethods: All French patients randomized (1:1, stratification according to centre) in the multicenter open-label ASTIS trial from 2001 to 2019, followed in parallel-groups until October 31, 2013 were subsequently included in the MATHEC cohort for extended follow-up with at least yearly evaluation with data collection up to last visit. Primary endpoint was the GRCS comparing participants with each other, based on a hierarchy of disease features assessed at 5 years 60 months: death, EFS (survival without respiratory, renal, or cardiac failure), forced vital capacity (FVC), the Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index score (SHAQ) and the modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS). Secondary endpoints were: EFS, overall survival (OS) and functional status. Delta values were calculated between 5 years and baseline. All analyses have been done by intention to treat.\n\nResults: The 49 MATHEC patients initially randomly assigned in ASTIS to AHSCT (n = 26) or cyclophosphamide (n = 23) showed no significant difference at baseline regarding: age (46vs 42years), female predominance(58 vs 65%), SSc duration (1.6vs 1.4years), mRSS (25 vs 25), FVC (83vs 80%), CT-scan abnormalities (24/26 vs 18/23), Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF%) (66 vs 68), Pulmonary Artery Hypertension (3/26 vs 6/23), creatinemia (66vs 60µmol/ l) and SHAQ (1.2 vs1.3).\n\nAt 5 years, comparison between AHSCT versus Cyclophosphamide groups showed median GRCS at 9 versus -19 (p = 0.018) with 64% versus 29% improvement using paired comparison (p = 0.021). EFS was higher in AHSCT (7 events including 3 deaths) versus Cyclophosphamide group (12 events including 7 deaths) (p = 0.04, Hazard ratio = 0.48mRSS improved in both groups, with higher improvement in the AHSCT versus Cyclophosphamide group (delta mRSS: 16 vs -9, p = 0.02). SHAQ improved in the AHSCT group only (delta SHAQ = 0.89 versus - 0.2, p = 0.05). No significant difference was observed between the groups in FVC, LVEF and creatinemia.\n\nConclusions: The ASTIS-France-MATHEC study confirms the efficacy and the superiority of AHSCT versus Cyclophosphamide treatment for severe SSs, after 5 years and using GRCS criteria.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] van Laar JM, Farge D and Al.

Advances in Multiple Sclerosis (Ms) Treatment: Clinical and Patient-reported Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation\n\nDenis Fedorenko1, Vladimir Melnichenko1, Gorgut Zeinalov1, Tatiana Nikitina2,3, Natalia Porfirieva3, Tatiana Ionova1,2\n\n1National Medical and Surgical Center named after N.I. Pirogov, Moscow, Russian Federation, 2Saint Petersburg State University Hospital, Saint-Petersburg, Russian Federation, 3Multinational Center for Quality of Life Research, Saint-Petersburg, Russian Federation\n\nBackground: At present high-dose immunosuppressive therapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) has been used with increasing frequency as a therapeutic option for MS patients. Here we present the results of single center experience of AHSCT in MS with the analysis of both clinical and patient-reported outcomes (PRO).\n\nMethods: Pts aged >14 y.o. with verified MS, who had indications for AHSCT were involved in a prospective single center study. Reduced-intensity BM/BEAM-like or Cyclophosphamide based conditioning were used. For clinical outcomes neurological assessment using EDSS and MRI scans were performed. Safety was evaluated in accordance with NCI CTCAE v.2.0. Quality of life (QoL) was assessed using RAND SF-36, symptom severity - using CSP-MS-42. Event-free survival (EFS) and progressive-free survival (PFS) after AHSCT were evaluated using Kaplan-Meyer method. For QoL and EDSS comparisons paired t-test, Mann-Whitney test, Wilcoxon test, and ANOVA were used. For comparison of survival log-rank criterion was applied.\n\nResults: 502 MS pts (mean age - 39 years old; male/female -178/324; mean EDSS=4.0; 257 relapsing/remitting MS, 161 - secondary progressive MS and 84 - primary progressive MS) were included in the analysis. Median of MS duration - 5 yrs (0.5-33). Median follow-up after HSCT - 29.5 mo (0.2-111.6). The mobilization and transplantation procedures were well tolerated. Transplant-related mortality - 2 pts (0.4%). Clinical response was observed in the vast majority (99%) of pts. Average time until disease progression - 101.4 mo (95% CI 98.0-104.9). EFS in relapsing-remitting MS was 95%, in progressive - 78%. EFS and PFS were better in younger pts with less EDSS score and less disease duration as well as in those with relapsing-remitting MS (p < 0.001). As for QoL it was significantly compromised before AHSCT. In a year after transplantation definite QoL improvement was registered across all the scales of SF-36, except role emotional functioning (p< 0.01). At long-term follow-up (median - 24 months) positive QoL changes preserved: QoL scales were significantly higher than at baseline (p< 0.01). Further analysis demonstrated that positive QoL and symptom changes after AHSCT were revealed for different patients’ subgroups: pts with progressive and relapsing disease; pts with low, intermediate and high disability according to EDSS; pts with MS duration < 5 yrs and pts with longer disease duration. A wide range of disease-related symptoms according to CSP-MS-42 were pronounced before AHSCT. Their severity significantly decreased after transplantation for the majority of scales.\n\nConclusions: Thus, the risk/benefit ratio of AHSCT in our population of MS pts is very favorable. The vast majority of pts responded to treatment and exhibited clinical improvement or were stable during the follow-up. AHSCT was accompanied by significant improvement in patient’s QoL and decrease of symptom burden. AHSCT is beneficial for different subgroups of MS pts, including the unfavorable ones. Information about PROs in MS pts undergoing AHSCT may provide valuable information about patient’s perspective about the risks/benefits of treatment, needs for rehabilitation and the degree of the recovery.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to declare.\n\nO031. Post Transplantation Cyclophosphamide Improves Outcome After Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Animal Model of Multiple Sclerosis\n\nKaja Kasarełło1, Martyna Seta1, Tomasz Ciesielski1, Dorota Sulejczak2, Robert Wrzesień1, Agnieszka Cudnoch-Jędrzejewska1, Emilian Snarski1\n\n1Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland, 2Mossakowski Medical Research Centre, Warsaw, Poland\n\nBackground: Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is the animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), the autoimmunological human disease leading to neurodegeneration.\n\nThe autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) has recently become the standard treatment for highly-active relapsing remitting MS. Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) which is a typical part of conditioning is thought to eliminate the autoreactive cells, which may persist after the chemotherapy. The other strategies of post-transplantation treatment are neither well developed in animal model nor in clinical transplantation.\n\nIn our experiment, we aimed to investigate the effect of AHSCT with the addition of low dose post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (CP) on the disease course in rats with evoked EAE.\n\nMethods: Rats with evoked EAE (day 0) were treated with (a) high-dose (125mg/kg) CP (day +6), followed by AHSCT (day +7) (EAE CP HSCT), or (b) high-dose (125mg/kg) CP, followed by AHSCT (EAE CP HSCT CP), followed by low-dose (20mg/kg) CP (day +10, +11). Clinical symptoms of EAE were observed during the disease course, and after the resolution of symptoms (day +21) rats were euthanized. Spinal cords were collected for further analysis. Histochemical analysis (H+E staining) were performed to assess the intensity of immune cells infiltration to the CNS.\n\nResults: The results showed that both the AHSCT and AHSCT with post-transplant CP reduce the intensity of the inflammatory response in the CNS, in comparison to EAE not-treated rats. Histopathological analysis of cervical and thoracic spinal cord sections has shown significant reduction of the inflammatory infiltrations (% of slice area occupied by infiltrated cells) from 0.015% in EAE non-treated animals to about 0.005% in EAE treated animals (Figure 1). The clinical symptoms reduction was present in both treatment arms (p = 0.00005) - however significantly stronger in arm with post-transplantation CP compared to AHSCT alone (p = 0.03). The toxicity of both treatment arms was similar: engraftment was complete by day +14 after the AHSCT and there was no transplant related mortality.\n\nConclusions: Application of the additional post AHSCT low-dose CP improved the results of AHSCT by not only reducing the intensity of inflammation in the CNS but also by significantly reducing the clinical symptoms in treated animals. We provide the experimental rationale that the addition of post transplantation CP could improve outcome of AHSCT in MS.\n\n[Figure 1: Infiltrations in spinal cord in treated animals]\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to declare.
