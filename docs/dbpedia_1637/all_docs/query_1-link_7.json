        "text": "When I was in college, I wanted to be a writer. But then I read that only two hundred writers in America support themselves writing. I thought, “That’s an awfully small group.” I didn’t want to be a part-time writer with a day job—that didn’t interest me. I either had to be one of those two hundred people or forget it. So I decided to become a doctor. I was attracted to medicine partly because I thought I would be doing useful work, helping people—I would never have to wonder if the work was worthwhile. But many working physicians are not convinced at all. They have all kinds of doubts, which troubled me. I also found that I was at odds with the thrust of the profession at the time, which was highly scientific medicine: the physician as technician and the patient as biological machine that was broken. I didn’t find it appealing to work in that kind of setting.\n\nA medical student always is in the position of not knowing how to do something. Medicine also got you into the frame of mind of dealing with very high-pressure situations, dealing with complex factors, emergencies. You often had to act and make fast decisions. Something is always going wrong in a movie, and that kind of experience is invaluable in salvaging a situation. Directing is really hard work.\n\nMeet Michael Crichton, a man whose creative landscape ranges from the ragtag intrigues of 19th century London to the threatening predictions of a future we can only imagine.\n\nHe is a Harvard Medical School graduate who chose not to pursue a medical career. Instead he “writes books and makes movies.” He is an author and film maker with a keen sense of where the human imagination is headed.\n\nCrichton is now at work on a novel, screenplay and film exploring the darker side of communication between man and primate in Africa.\n\nHis first novel, The Andromeda Strain, published the year he finished medical school, became an international best-seller. In the ten years since, he has written six books, including The Great Train Robbery, which remained on the New York Times Best Seller List for 22 weeks. He major film credits include Westworld, Coma and The Great Train Robbery.\n\n“I like the complexity of film. It has every element you could want to play with. It’s a symphony, a play, it’s a photograph. And the director pulls it together.”\n\nCrichton recasts historical fact and transforms scientific data. He plumbs the depths of the plausible, leading his audience to that uncertain terrain which lies between what we know and what we can believe.\n\n“The game to me is to convince people that something really happened. My ideal is to create what appears to be a non-fiction book.” The writer he feels closest to is Daniel Dafoe. “He took existing accounts and essentially “fixed” them creating Robinson Crusoe. He improved on the facts, really. Half of what passes for history is fiction anyhow.”\n\nBut what of these instances when actual events fulfill the prophecies of fiction?\n\n“In the best circumstances, fiction serves as a kind of trial balloon. It allows a society to experience events before they actually take place, make decisions and prepare responses to them.”\n\nTechnological innovation and scientific discovery demand that we make choices. These choices are central to much of Crichton’s work.\n\n“What we are seeing increasingly is that the decision to commit to certain technologies will affect us for longer and longer periods. That implies an enormous responsibility.\n\nResponsibility include being informed. Crichton reads Scientific American.\n\n“I keep back issues forever because my interests change. I’m always amazed at what’s there. The graphics are extraordinary and they make even the most difficult articles accessible.”\n\nScientific American is a working tool for Crichton. “The articles review recent developments in particular fields. I go to past issues and work my way up on a subject, getting the background by reviewing the magazine chronologically.\n\nA growing number of newsstand buyers are subscribers and join Michael Crichton every month. Every issue of Scientific American reaches more than two million people who make the future happen."
