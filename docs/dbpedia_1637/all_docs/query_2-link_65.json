This cautionary tale is timely and important.’ Dave Sweeney, Australian Conservation Foundation\n\nAustralia has been directly involved in the nuclear industry for more than a century, but our involvement has never been comprehensively documented. Long Half-life tells the social and political history of Australia’s role, from the first discovery of radioactive ores in 1906 to contemporary contentious questions. Should the next generation of submarines be nuclear powered? Can nuclear energy help to slow global climate change? Do we need nuclear weapons for defence? Should we store radioactive waste from nuclear power stations in our region?\n\nLong Half-life is a timely and riveting account of the political, social and scientific complexities of the nuclear industry, revealing the power of vested interests, the subjectivities of scientists and the transformative force of community passion.\n\nIan Lowe and Robin Williams discuss Long Half-life on The Science Show ABC\n\nIan Lowe and Jeremy Moss discuss nuclear energy in Australia (recorded at this year’s Adelaide Writers’ Week)"
