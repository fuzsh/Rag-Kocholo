A new four-generation classification of the quinolone drugs takes into account the expanded antimicrobial spectrum of the more recently introduced fluoroquinolones and their clinical indications. First-generation drugs (e.g., nalidixic acid) achieve minimal serum levels. Second-generation quinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin) have increased gram-negative and systemic activity. Third-generation drugs (e.g., levofloxacin) have expanded activity against gram-positive bacteria and atypical pathogens. Fourth-generation quinolone drugs (currently only trovafloxacin) add significant activity against anaerobes. The quinolones can be differentiated within classes based on their pharmacokinetic properties. The new classification can help family physicians prescribe these drugs appropriately.",

        "text": "The newer fluoroquinolones have broad-spectrum bactericidal activity, excellent oral bioavailability, good tissue penetration and favorable safety and tolerability profiles. A new four-generation classification of the quinolone drugs takes into account the expanded antimicrobial spectrum of the more recently introduced fluoroquinolones and their clinical indications. First-generation drugs (e.g., nalidixic acid) achieve minimal serum levels. Second-generation quinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin) have increased gram-negative and systemic activity. Third-generation drugs (e.g., levofloxacin) have expanded activity against gram-positive bacteria and atypical pathogens. Fourth-generation quinolone drugs (currently only trovafloxacin) add significant activity against anaerobes. The quinolones can be differentiated within classes based on their pharmacokinetic properties. The new classification can help family physicians prescribe these drugs appropriately.\n\nAbsorption of orally administered fluoroquinolones is significantly decreased when these agents are coadministered with aluminum, magnesium, calcium, iron or zinc, because of the formation of insoluble drug–cationic chelate complexes in the gastrointestinal tract.3,10 The problem can be overcome largely by administering products containing these metal ions at least four hours before or two hours after oral administration of a fluoroquinolone. Because sucralfate (Carafate) contains aluminum, it can also reduce absorption of the quinolones. Adequate spacing of administration times has not been determined, and coadministration of quinolones and sucralfate should be avoided.\n\nThe long half-lives of the newer fluoroquinolones allow once- or twice-daily dosing. The quinolones vary with respect to the relative contribution of renal and nonrenal pathways for their elimination. Only ofloxacin and levofloxacin are exclusively eliminated by the kidney.2,5,6 Renal and nonrenal (gastrointestinal or hepatic) mechanisms are responsible for the elimination of nalidixic acid, cinoxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin (Penetrex), lomefloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin and sparfloxacin. Dosage adjustments based on estimated creatinine clearance values must be made for the agents with significant renal elimination. In most instances, administering the usual dose at an extended interval is recommended.\n\nThe new classification of quinolone antibiotics takes into account the expanded antimicrobial spectrum of the newer fluoroquinolones and their clinical indications (Tables 11,5–7,9,11–13,19 and 220). Introduced in 1997, this classification is a useful tool for physicians to use when empirically prescribing these drugs or evaluating new agents introduced to the market.1 Drugs in each group are similar in antimicrobial activity. With each successive generation, a significant new group of pathogens is added to the coverage.\n\nTrovafloxacin is available in an oral tablet and as the prodrug alatrofloxacin (Trovan IV) in an intravenous formulation. Although the findings of few clinical trials on trovafloxacin have been published, the drug was originally labeled by the FDA for the treatment of a wide spectrum of infectious diseases.18 Because of concern about hepatotoxicity, trovafloxacin therapy should be reserved for life- or limb-threatening infections requiring inpatient treatment (hospital or long-term care facility), and the drug should be taken for no longer than 14 days.9\n\nCopyright © 2000 by the American Academy of Family Physicians.\n\nThis content is owned by the AAFP.
