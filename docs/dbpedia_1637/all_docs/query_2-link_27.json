A poignant exploration of ambition, family, gender and love. A tender, nuanced and inspiring novel for anyone who's ever been torn by conflicting passions and loyalties; in other words, a book for all of us.’\n\n– Jean Kwok\n\n‘Thought-provoking, skillfully written and hard to put down.’\n\n– Kirkus\n\n‘Cantor has created an absorbing biographical novel and performed an engaging riff on the “what if” ponderings we all experience.’\n\n– Booklist\n\n‘In a time when many of us are more tuned in to scientific advances than we've ever been before, this reimagining of what might happen if pioneering scientist Marie Curie had taken a different path is just what the doctor ordered.’\n\n– Good Housekeeping"
