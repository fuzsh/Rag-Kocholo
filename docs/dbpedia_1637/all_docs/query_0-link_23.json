        "text": "One of the predators, who actually was and may never have stopped being a Nazi is global financier and convicted felon George Soros [10]. His plan, which is shared by many in these elite circles, was to shut down every part of the economy in the first world, and de-industrialize the USA. The collapsing borders, super-inflation, total elimination of fossil fuels (unless it comes from perhaps British Petroleum or those in league with the globalists), and collapse of the world food supply (mass starvation). All this so a corporate UN coordinated world government can come in and act as saviors. It is a decarbonizing agenda, an anti-terraforming religion where carbon dioxide will be removed from the atmosphere in the name of being Green. Green was intended to be the new anti-human, anti-science religion used to isolate, control and eventually eliminate as much as 80% of the human population on the planet, for the carbon they really want to remove is us. If Green were really “Green” why are we outsourcing our energy needs to China where slaves are many and human rights are few. Those batteries for electric cars require cobalt mined by exploited African children. Who do you think are making all those Chinese solar panels (yes, they make most of them)? How about a million Uyghur Muslim slaves incarcerated because of their religion - at least until someone with money needs an organ that matches one of the slaves, be they Muslim or Fallon Gong practitioners. It’s called Green Washing or environmental virtue signaling.\n\nBy 2026, there will be more than three Chinese males for every female aged 15-29, thanks to their policy of sex-selective abortion. The Chinese gender gap is fueling the trafficking of poor women, who are being kidnapped or lured into China and forced to be prostitutes or slave-brides. This is an unspoken driver of Chinese policy.\n\nA massive global death cult has been lurking for decades for the moment to strike. They actually believe(d) they could transcend carbon-based life and have their consciousness transferred to some silicon-based life-form. In the short term, their plan is to neutralize the USA with a civil war/economic collapse while China takes over the South China Sea including Taiwan.\n\nWhether you personally believe in malevolence, Satan [11] or nasty inter-dimensionals is your choice, but the globalists believe in them and most have sold their proverbial souls [12] for something they already had and now they have created a covenant with the losing team. The weird thing is on some level they know it, but can’t stop themselves so they push forward with their deranged game plans to create a transhuman world where most humans have been eliminated and they want this all to happen by 2030 according to their own published agenda [13].\n\nA world that will be free of poverty and hunger because we won’t be in it, but those who remain will own nothing, be happy and eat bugs - again, this plan has been cooking for the last century. The globalists’ desire to be top dogs on a prison planet is so intense their wish may actually be granted, but not on this Earth. That seems to be the way a benevolent universe works, you get what you want, eventually, but it may not be exactly how you planned it out. Be that as it may, there also seems to be a lot of malevolence tolerated at certain levels and layers of our reality undoubtedly to stir the evolutionary pot for the benefit of all. Nevertheless, what goes around comes around, so if true, you don’t trade your future for temporary misuse of power as seductive as it may be. It is a poor choice, but some insist on learning the hard way, yet even in their insanity, the lessons they offer benefit the whole.\n\nMedical Tyranny and Soft Kill weapons\n\nFluoride seems to have been the first foray into medical tyranny to control populations. The historical use of fluoride for behavior control probably started in the Soviet gulags in the 1930’s but Nazi Germany was quick to apply same in their prison camps as the mineral makes humans apathetic and easy to dominate - stupid and docile. The propaganda campaign in the USA was so convincing that fluoride was essential for preventing tooth decay that anyone who questioned its use in the water supply, even though fluoride is more poisonous than lead, was considered a nut case. The book The Fluoride Deception is well researched and goes over this in detail [14].\n\nThe practice and paradigm of fluoridating municipal drinking water demonstrated that the public would accept drinking poison if the government insisted it was a public health measure being done for the benefit of citizen’s well-being - “Fur Ihre Sicherheit” - it’s for your safety a common Nazi reframe. This poison is still universally defended by the dentists who will willingly put the most poisonous non-radioactive element on the periodic table in your mouth, mercury amalgam fillings, and call it silver. The mercury is constantly leeching out and you breathe it in and swallow it too.\n\nDuring WW II, the biowarfare activities of the Japanese were particularly atrocious. As many as 3000 allied troops lost their lives in places such as the infamous Unit 731 testing biologics and untold number of civilians when these agents were released in Asia. The USA covertly granted the scientists involved immunity not unlike Operation Paper Clip [15].\n\nBlame it on the fluoridated water, but we have allowed ourselves to be experimented on far too easily and without holding anyone accountable. There is no freedom without accountability. In 1950, the U.S. Army sprayed the bacteria serratia marcescens in San Francisco from a boat(s) in the bay - Operation Sea Spray and continued till 1969. There was at least one documented death from the infections that followed.\n\nInfantile paralysis or polio didn’t exist until the heavy use of various pesticides the most notable being DDT, which is required to weaken the immune system so a previously benign stomach virus could start causing paralysis. But the government had encouraged and required the liberal use of DDT, and it was used everywhere and on almost everything (still is in certain parts of the world). Nevertheless, a virus and only a virus would be blamed for what was actually an illness caused by a pesticide or else there would be great liability to both the government and industry. So fear of a virus was ginned up - sound familiar? The mass vaccination campaign (Polio) initially gave 98 million Americans a retrovirus infection, a simian virus (SV40), now known to be causally related to several types of cancer. Now it seems genetic sequences from SV40 are in the mRNA bioweapon for COVID.\n\nDon’t misunderstand what is written here… an enterovirus causes the illness but it needs a toxic co-factor in most cases. If the truth of the toxic cause of polio was known, and the government held accountable for infecting millions with a cancer-causing retrovirus, we would not be where we are today. The first mass vaccination program for polio in the USA, now called the Cutter Incident, gave 200,000 children polio. To convince the public the polio vaccine program was working, the definition of polio was changed so that one had to be paralyzed for at least 60 days to be classified as polio - most cases resolved before 60 days and of course they knew that. It made the vaccine look very effective. Today, the definition of what is a vaccine has been redefined to accommodate a hard to sell, problematic gene-transfer therapy that makes the human body create a pathogenic protein (forever in some people), potentially sterilize [16] many recipients and inflame their hearts [17]. Make the human body produce a pathogenic spike protein - what could go wrong?\n\nOh, and the definition of “Gain-of-Function” was changed as well, so the reader can decide if that made Dr. Fauci look any more credible. Especially, when it was found he wanted EcoHealth Alliance to spray more virulent corona virus in Wuhan caves to infect the local population (the Pentagon refused to fund the project - maybe because it was an act of war?) [18].\n\nMade in the USA\n\nBy masking biowarfare programs as public health measure producing vaccines these fools were able to get around restrictions. The Department of Defense (DoD)/DARPA admitted to operating 46 biolabs in Ukraine, for public health of course - but pay no attention to the fact we operate these labs all over the world…. “we are the good guys.” In 2012, DARPA developed their ADEPT:PROTECT project that would use gene-encoded vaccines to stop a pandemic (they would create?). There was no WARP speed program - they had already been working on this for ten years before Trump announced WARP speed. Moderna got its first contract in 2013, but it was the DoD that came up with the idea of mRNA vaccines - this whole thing has been a military operation from the get go. By 2015, the peer reviewed literature had articles announcing the enhanced CoV2 was ready to be used (on the human population). It was never a China-virus, the Wuhan lab was just enhancing what was created in the USA. With the first week thousands of pregnant women were taking this vaccine. Never have we given experimental vaccines to pregnant women and in the past medicine went out of its way to protect pregnant women from as much as possible and certainly not interventions that would upset their immune systems, but medicine was now neutered - only Pharmakeia existed and was in full control.\n\nThe polio outbreak showed that you could herd the sheep (humans in this case) into a slaughter house if there was an invisible enemy and a virus is perfect for that because one can use fear to get populations to turn to their government to protect them from this invisible enemy. If you have control of the media, you can also implement a divide & conquer strategy, so if you can turn men against women, blacks against whites, heterosexuals against the LGBQTs, established populations against imported immigrants by the millions - all of that causes people to turn to their governments for interventions. Do you think those funding Critical Race Theory to Drag Queen Story-Time want harmony? No, they want culture wars and civil wars.\n\nIn the USA, if one disagreed with the narrative the media, the Department of Justice or FBI would label that individual either a domestic terrorist or white supremacist/racist regardless of their skin color. It was part of the plan to blame the destruction of the USA on white supremacists, but ponder this one example - the City of Oakland California is deeply beset with crime and violence, but I would challenge you to find even one white supremist in Oakland. Those behind the tyrannical cult we have been subjected to are not super-intelligent, but few realize they get their power from public acquiescence whose perceptions they have to control. Yes, the cult has a lot of financial resources and many deluded minions who will blindly do their bidding, but they are weak - only the weak censor. The censorship was a desperate move to control perceptions. But the censorship surrounding COVID killed tens of thousands.\n\nSo, with a virus, you can stop people from gathering, organizing and if you can digitize a population, you can control who is talking to whom and where. If you can get people to school online or do their work online the government can listen to everything everyone is saying and writing and buying. The excuse is that it is Fur Ihre Sicherheit to protect against the invisible enemy. It also keeps people lonely, isolated, and depressed. People will buy into solutions before they know anything about the consequences of that solution, so you can mandate lockdowns without proper science supporting same, injections that have not been adequately tested, or vaccines that are known to cause harm for the greater good of someone’s bottom-line.\n\nInfectious Disease Skullduggery\n\nThis is not a comprehensive tome of infectious disease skullduggery, but in 1955 it has been reported that the CIA conducted an open-air biological warfare experiment near Tampa, Florida and environs with the Pertussis bacteria. It was alleged that the nasty endeavor tripled the whooping cough infections in Florida to over one-thousand cases and caused whooping cough deaths in the state to increase 12-fold over the previous year [19].\n\nIn 1966, the U.S. Army released Bacillus globigii into the tunnels of the New York City Subway system, as part of a field experiment called A Study of the Vulnerability of Subway Passengers in New York City to Covert Attack with Biological Agents. The Chicago subway system was also subject to a similar experiment by the Army [20].\n\nBacillus globigii was used to simulate an attack with anthrax, but as it turned out, now we know this bacteria is a human pathogen [21].\n\nThe USA government conducted many radiation experiments on the unwary, MKULTRA drug experiments on the unknowing, torture experiments on the incarcerated, but again…this is not meant to be a comprehensive list. By the time U.S. President Eisenhower left office with his infamous speech beware the “military-industrial-complex” we were being lead into unending military conflicts, often initiated by false flag events such as the Gulf of Tonkin incident that was used to start the Vietnam war.\n\nMen in Black\n\nIn the 1950s, the CIA had split into two factions. The western faction was almost exclusively in control of anything that had to do with ETs - I don’t mention this to be sensational. In the years that followed the military-industrial paradigm evolved and became inclusive of many multinational corporations, investment houses and banks, which benefited from this arrangement leading to where we have massive corporate interests, such as Black Rock/Vanguard, which span the globe and whose shareholder-ships are networked among a very small oligarch class.\n\nWhile President Roosevelt avoided a coup, President John F Kennedy did not, and was assassinated (1963) in a coordinated plot managed by the CIA’s E. Howard Hunt. Lyndon B. Johnson was Vice-President and was fully aware of the planned elimination of JFK as was the infamous director of the FBI, J Edgar Hoover. Apparently, America decided to explore the dark side and so begin unending wars and skullduggery around the globe. But I doubt this could have been possible without the cooperation of the press in covering up the facts of the event. Why was Kennedy assassinated?\n\nKennedy wanted the USA back on the gold standard, he wanted the CIA dismantled, he never wanted the USA to get entangled in Viet Nam. Unbeknownst to Kennedy, the CIA had become far more than the “CIA” they were literally the Men in Black in matters extraterrestrial and if the CIA was threatened it also threatened the cover being used in such matters and the monopoly of information the CIA had on this information. Kennedy had a vision for the space program, but his vison was not shared by those using NASA as a front organization for their secret space program (they were back engineering crashed vehicles probably with the help of low-vibrational ETs, but that is speculation). Just days before his murder, Kennedy signed an agreement with Kurschev to cooperate on moon exploration and signed an executive order requesting the CIA share what they knew about UFO’s to make sure there were no accidents from confusing UFOs with an aggressive act by either side. The CIA had no intention of sharing anything with anyone and certainly wasn’t going to let the chief executive tell them what to do even if that meant making him “wet.”\n\nMeanwhile, the secret biowarfare facility located on Plum Island off the coast of Connecticut was developing an enhanced version of the Borrelia bacteria (Lyme disease) under the directorship of former German SS-officer and microbiologist Eric Traub - Gain of Function research. This organism with increased virulence now infects 20% of the world’s population. Be that as it may, the virulence of the organism was not robust enough for the globalists.\n\nThe fall-guy set-up to take the blame for the JFK assassination was CIA asset Lee Harvey Oswald, who strangely enough was mixed up in a virus gain-of-function program for the purpose of developing a weapon that would kill Fidel Castro. Oswald knew too much and was expendable, so he was a convenient “patsy.” Mary Sherman, the scientist running the program, was murdered. It is still speculation whether there was a link to this apparent effort to create a deadly virus and the subsequent identification and possible enhancement of the HIV virus.\n\nMaurice Hillerman, one of the world’s most prominent virologists of his time and a Vice President of Merck, was recorded boasting, “So we brought African Greens in and I didn't know we were importing the AIDS virus at the time.” Merck switched from Indian rhesus to green monkeys because the rhesus monkey were full of retroviruses including SV40. Was HIV just due to sloppy virology, or was HIV, once identified, manipulated and chosen as a bioweapon. A weapon that must have been a big disappointment as it took far too long to kill its victims. Intentional or not, in all likelihood it was introduced in the USA via the Hepatitis B vaccine trials that exclusively recruited gay men in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. The bottom-line is that vaccineologists in the 20th century were creating invasive medical interventions with no clue as to what they were doing and as a result murdered many. Or did they know what they were doing?\n\nThe situation in Africa is a little less clear, starting in 1957 [22], oral polio vaccines were administered by the Wistar Institute and given to “hundreds of thousands of Africans.” As with almost all vaccines there was no follow-up. The FDA has archived vaccines from that period and if they forensically looked at them to see if HIV was present, they have not told anyone. That would eliminate the conspiracy theories, but it would also implicate the whole vaccine program as a very problematic, unethical and sloppy endeavor to say the least.\n\nBig Pharma, in the USA, was able to get unconditional liability protection from lawsuits related to adverse events from their vaccines in 1986. Safety was no longer their concern as the responsibility of vaccine safety was now the responsibility of the U.S. Government. So, there was an explosion of vaccines required for children, and a mysterious increase in sudden infant death syndrome, chronic health conditions and a formerly rare neurological disorder called autism. Autism is a post-vaccination encephalitis but the connection between vaccines, mercury, aluminum (found in ~ 80% of vaccines at toxic levels), acetaminophen and autism was deliberately covered up by agencies of the U.S. Government. When the CDC had the objective data the vaccines were connected to autism their response was to shred the data. A high-level whistleblower came forward and disclosed this but no one in government did anything - no hearings, no investigation - nothing. This was the subject of the documentary “Vaxxed.”\n\nBig Pharma was already well on their way to capturing regulatory agencies and politicians. No one in the upper echelons of government would dare reveal what they knew, and they never did; however, that silence empowered the eugenics cult. The U.S. Government never met their obligations under the 1986 Vaccine Act and ignored all safety issues even as they pushed the mantra, “Safe & Effective” so that by the time CoV2 showed up the population was good and indoctrinated. Health & Human Services (HHS) already had decades of blowing off their responsibilities for vaccine safety and few seemed to care.\n\nSARS -1, the predecessor to SARS-2 (CoV2) arrived on the scene in 2002, and in all likelihood was a test run. The reason one does not here about it anymore is that is has no natural host, and therefore not in circulation. If there is no natural host, then where did it come from? Is there wet market in the Wuhan virology lab? CoV2 was a made in the USA, but was sent to the Wuhan Virology Lab for enhancements that became illegal to do in the U.S.\n\nThere is strong circumstantial evidence that A/H1N1, the so-called novel Mexican Swine flu event of 2009 was neither Mexican nor novel, but a genetically engineered creation from the USA. The virus included genetic bits of North American human, avian and swine flus and Eurasian swine flu —the virus had not been detected in any pigs except those in a single herd in Canada [23]. A variant of A/H1N1 broke out in India in 2015, but has apparently not been a player since. No natural host.\n\nHad there been a sincere and honest attempt to flesh out the origins of these viruses, again we would not be where we are today. While A/H1N1 was very infectious, the virus was no more problematic than the normal flu virus and has vanished. It may have just been a test run for a future release.\n\nThe destruction of the World Trade Center on 9/11, was another coup d’état this time by the NeoCon faction of the New World Order set. It greatly empowered them to have been able to get away with that event. Firing a missile into the Pentagon, but telling everyone it was a 757 jet, the overt demolishing of WTC 7 (no plane hit this building), and clear evidence WTC 1 & 2 were demolished. It was carried off by traitors within the USA in conjunction with several middle eastern countries. Much could be said here about the horrors unleashed post-coup d’état, but no one in officialdom would dare speak the obvious truths. It really set the stage for what would be coming soon enough. And what was that?… the continued NeoCon agenda to take over Eastern Europe (in violation of the agreement made with Gorbachev that there would be no expansion into Eastern Europe [by NATO] if the Warsaw Pact was dissolved).\n\nThe attempt to scare the world with the Zika virus was a really big flop. They would not make that mistake again. So quick to blame a relatively benign virus for the clusters of microcephaly in Brazil. However, too many found out fairly quickly that the pocket of mothers in Brazil who gave birth to children with microcephaly were vaccinated with DTP while pregnant and while drinking larvicide laden tap water at the same time. So, that attempt to scare the world had to be shut down immediately because a vaccine was clearly implicated. At the same time a sentinel paper was published - a retrospective look (using matched controls) at 30 years of DPT use in Africa showing in increased overall mortality 10-fold, so it was very important to shut down any interest in looking at the safety and efficacy of the DPT [24].\n\nWhich brings us to CoV2, and the announcement by Dr. Fauci in 2017, that a surprise outbreak was imminent. The plot was apparently hatched as far back as 1999, at the University of North Carolina. In the subsequent years numerous white papers, such as SARS 2025-2028, [25] the pandemic war games, such as Event 201, [26] which were priming both the media and the public. Finally, they would have the event that would allow them to bring in their great reset of the world economy and cull the population at the same time. Key players in multiple governments had already been compromised, regulatory agencies had been captured, and Big Pharma along with Big Tech were in total control of conventional media outlets.\n\nYet, CoV2 virus was not an infectious disease hellion. It took out the old and the infirm just like influenza does every year, so the hype had to go into overdrive, which the PCR tests accomplished cycled so high clean swabs would test positive. It was critical the number of deaths for CoV2 to be very high in order to generate the fear to justify what would come next. So, despite long standing rules for data collection and reporting, successfully used for years by all hospitals, medical examiners, coroners, and physicians, suddenly CDC changed the way they wanted deaths reported. Had they used the normal criteria the mortality figures would have had to be revised down 90%. The very people within government who might have sounded the alarm that we were being manipulated into a bio-security state based on false information were compromised as many of them would be able to earn millions of dollars from the licensing of the mRNA technology. It has been determined that almost half of all PCR results were false positives, which if nothing else calls into question the clinical trials used to validate the “vaccine.” [27] As an aside, we have never had a vaccine that makes the human body create a pathogen in a controlled way for an uncontrolled duration. The Spike protein is a significant pathogen - a loaded weapon if you will with no assurance it would control the outbreak.\n\nWhat happened next was 50 countries panicked and were cajoled into signing secret agreements with Pfizer essentially putting them into receivership in exchange for the injections and monetary assistance from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund [28]. An agreement to remain secret for 50 years. Any criticism of the injections or of Pfizer would be forbidden, Pfizer would not only direct the global response but also the response individual countries would have so a worldwide extermination system could be initiated. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) now under operational control of the Department of Defense (DoD) even asked a federal court to allow them 55 years to hold onto the data they relied on to give Emergency Use Authorization for the Pfizer injection. There can only be one reason for this request, and that is the FDA/DoD didn’t want anyone to see that the Pfizer data showed that at best, one would have to inject 22,000 people to potentially prevent one death. No need to point out the Wuhan A strain was no longer in circulation. I am also sure they didn’t want anyone to see that there were more deaths in the injected group than in the control group.\n\nThe lack of early prevention and treatment protocols, and the persecution of anyone trying to treat COVID patients prior to hospitalization was not a form of treatment nihilism, it was a well-organized, well-funded conspiracy to make sure nothing would interfere with an injection rollout. Never have sick patients been turned away from hospitals and told to come back when their lips were blue.\n\nAll the big players were deeply, corruptly and maliciously in bed with Pharma, so would lose billions if it were found off-patent drugs could treat COVID. The FDA, under the direction of the Department of Defense (DoD), illegally exercised emergency use powers, and was a willing ally in the suppression of treatments known to be effective against the virus, such as something as benign as vitamin D. In some countries physicians were arrested for prescribing Ivermectin. Then injections were illegally marketed to children as well after the FDA advisory panelist said \"We're never gonna learn about how safe the vaccine is until we start giving it,\" said panel member Dr. Eric Rubin. \"That's just the way it goes.\" No Dr. Rubin… that is not the way it goes [29]. When you ignore safety, you tend to ignore whether the injection even works, and while the “science” is moving forward, unfortunately deluded technocrats were not [30]. The FDA stopped being a regulatory agency and became part of the other alphabet agencies to promote the “vaccine.” They saw their role was to get a needle in every arm, in everyone in every country - it was choreography to dance to the edicts of the DoD.\n\nPfizer now had the power to silence governments, maximize profits and power. Military bases, National Parks - just a few of the items signed over [31]. Big Tech and Pharma had bled out multiple governments to create this giant one world government monster with Pfizer calling the shots - literally. The human infestation would be eliminated with the silent, obedient consent of governments around the world.\n\nOriginal Antigenic Sin\n\nBut there were problems. The injection was going to kill too many too fast (as intended) even though many of the injections were expired and ineffective (they were thawed for too long) and many blanks were shipped to many locations to mitigate the number of adverse events anticipated. Nevertheless, the body count increased as well hidden as those bodies may have been. They had to buffer the rollout of the injection because again it was supposed to have come on the scene after billions were already dead from CoV2 and few would be left to ask important questions.\n\nOne question was why give a non-sterilizing vaccine to everyone possible in the middle of a pandemic…all that would do is prolong the length of illness by pumping out a multitude of variants, which is exactly what took place. They were called variants because they had a different spike protein than the one the injection was having the human body manufacture, and so the efficacy of the injections started falling into the single digits [32]. This was all predicted well in advance, but the injections were rushed for socio-political reasons not medical/scientific reasons. Compare and contrast what took place in Gibraltar vs. Africa.\n\nAfrica, a heavy user of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) - taken by millions - by the end 2021, the vaccination rates in 20 African countries wasn’t even close to coming out of the single digits.\n\nOverall the African vaccination rate was around 6%, but for some reason the “experts” were mystified as to why there is so little COVID in Africa [33]. On the other hand, perhaps the most vaccinated country on the planet was Gibraltar where there is a 100%+ vaccination rate and yet cases of COVID were so high Christmas 2021, was canceled. Unintentionally, they proved boosters don’t work. In Singapore, with at 94% vaccination rate, cases and mortality spiked to record levels, and in Ireland, where 92% of the adult population is vaccinated, cases and mortality doubled [34]. England was the only country, worldwide, that seemed to keep accurate records of its deaths by vaccination status (at least for a while). The COVID vaccines used in England (mRNA & DNA vector vaccines Pfizer, Moderna, and Astrazenica) do not significantly reduce COVID mortality, but did result in greatly increased all-cause mortality [35]. Specifically in England, if you are under 60 and you get injected, you are twice as likely to die. As the months went by the mortality of the injected only increased.\n\nThe mortality from COVID in an African country, such as Zaire was 0.6 per 100,000. Almost no one received the injection. In the USA the mortality was 1000 per 100,000. There should be no need to read one more word if you understand the obvious implications of that last sentence. Even before President Trump announced he had taken HCQ, the drug was disappearing and countries were removing it from over-the-counter status and requiring prescriptions. Someone didn’t want HCQ to be around, and studies were being conducted with near lethal doses of HCQ in late-stage patients (no zinc, no azithromycin) - it was as if someone deliberately wanted to destroy any chance HCQ might have to help treat COVID patients. Then perhaps one of the most momentous medical frauds in history took place - both the New England Journal of Medicine and the Lancet simultaneously published completely fabricated, fictional articles that concluded HCQ was not efficacious. What someone(s) had the power to fund fraudulent studies, compromise the world’s top medical journals, and then get the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) to pull the emergency use authorization (EUA) for HCQ? Apparently, that was the FTX group. Even after the papers were retracted the FDA did not reinstate the EUA. This brings up the problem that there is no FDA - the DoD took over the FDA regarding all things COVID.\n\nHowever, those who successfully destroyed the possibility of using HCQ for COVID weren’t done - they went after Ivermectin, but not with the same success. First and foremost, data from 19 countries that participated in the World Health Organization (WHO) sponsored African Programmed for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC), from 1995 until 2015, were compared with thirty-five (Non-APOC) - in other words, APOC countries are on Ivermectin. That may be why they had almost a 30% lower mortality from COVID than non-APOC countries [36]. But what took place in India was even better. Two provinces took opposite stands. Tamal Nadu followed WHO recommendations and had the same dismal stats that the USA had, but Uttar Pradesh supplied Ivermectin to its population and 97% of the cases were eliminated. Uttar Pradesh has 2/3rds the population of the USA.\n\nDespite the data on Ivermectin, leaders from Australia to Austria actually believed the COVID injections worked and the unvaccinated were spreading CoV2 - they probably still believe it. Ignore the fact there are no unvaccinated in Gibraltar. Are these leaders psychotic or, following orders from the Fauci/Francis Collins/Gates/Bio-Pharmaceutical-Military complex? They wanted us to panic with each new variant, so they could continue to lock-down, take people to camps, and have the ability to inject humanity multiple times a year forever [37] …that was always the plan.\n\nThis was not the greatest public health disaster the USA had ever seen; this was done on purpose but when events deviated from what was projected the cabal scrambled to salvage the situation as best they could. So, insane medical rituals that had no foundation in science or medicine were pushed - the less than worthless cloth masks, the quarantining of health asymptomatic adults and children, the meaningless six feet social distancing (the pulled that out of their rear-ends).\n\nRemember, those that expired were very old, fat and had multiple medical problems. There was never any credible reason to keep children from attending school and most lost two full years of education they will never be able to make up. Suicides increased, along with obesity and delays in treatment for medical problems that cost lives. The burden was on the poor who didn’t have jobs where they could work from home, while the elite rich got richer.\n\nIt doesn’t take a degree in immunology to understand that if you occupy the body’s immune system making a spike protein that is no longer connected to the circulating variant, not only is the vaccine worthless, it perniciously lowers one’s ability to deal with the actual viral infection one may get in the real world, because one’s immune system is busy making antibodies to something that is not present and may be oblivious to an actual virus invading the body. The CoV2 infection has a very low risk of myocarditis, but it is there. The injection had the body make massive amounts of spike protein, and the amounts the injection was having the body make caused significant myopericarditis. The FDA actually asked that prospective studies be done but they were never done by manufacturers. One such study has the actual risk is about 2.8% or about 3 people out of every 100. Conservative estimates have the risk at 1:<2000 (for context the Swine flu vaccine from the late ‘70’s was pulled when it was found the risk of a neurological disorder Guillain-Barre was 1:100,000).\n\nThe population continued to be told “Safe & Effective” and the usual “one in a million (side-effects).” There was 20 years of data showing corona viruses can cause heart disease, so one case of myocarditis should have shut the “vaccine” program down. But instead of pulling the vaccine the CDC went to work pushing the idea that the “vaccine” induced myocarditis was mild. It is just there is no such thing as mild myocarditis, in fact 20% of those that die within a day of receiving the “vaccine” have myocarditis [38]. There is only one solution…immediately end the worldwide vaccination program and try to help people repair their immune systems. But compromised, well-paid “experts” will never acknowledge this solution. There is just too much money to be made giving everyone more “vaccines.”\n\nThen there is this insane group-think that needs to be overcome, because there are people in government, medicine and academia that have been so indoctrinated that if something is a vaccine it is safe & effective - end of story - they shut out objective reality at all costs. Even the government’s own VAERS vaccine adverse event reporting system produced a massive death safety signal. VAERS recognized for under reporting adverse events by 99-fold still produced a massive death safety signal, but between the corruption and group think it was ignored.\n\nThe response to this inconvenient data was to order people to get more and more worthless injections that would do nothing but cause side-effects. Yet the presence of so many un-injected showed how robust natural immunity is, still promoting natural immunity could put one on a terrorist watch list. They needed as many as possible to be injected as often as possible before the public became aware of the hidden sequalae of the injections. The control group had to be eliminated, or rounded up and terminated - at least that is what they wanted to happen.\n\nObviously, this story is not over. On their way out the globalists will do whatever they think they can get away with to undermine and collapse civilization, including more bioweapons, they know their future is bleak and would sooner take as many with them as possible. But all stories end sooner or later, and when the story of the New World Order ends, it will look nothing like what its proponents had in mind. So, fight for freedom of knowledge, and in place of deceit, intolerance and prejudice fight for the possibilities of understanding, truth and acceptance. For that is the reality humanity is moving towards no matter how hard those who dish out their cruelties try and stop this change. Change is inevitable - it is the only Universal constant.\n\nPharmakeia a false hope and deception of false peace, false healing, and a false future.\n\n“The Armenian genocide was not a mistake; Holodomor was not a mistake; the Final Solution was not a mistake; the Killing Fields was not a mistake; the Great Leap Forward was not a mistake. Name your genocide it was not a mistake - that in includes the Great Democide of the 2020’s, to imply otherwise is to give “them” the out they are seeking.\n\n“It was not botched; it was not bungled; it was not a blunder; it was not incompetence; it was not lack of knowledge; it was not spontaneous mass hysteria.

Don’t let them get away with it.”\n\n---- by Margaret Anna Alice.\n\nThe world now knows, thanks to 46 Pages FOIA’ed emails between CDC managers, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Collins, and White House, NIH, HHS, that they all knew about vaccine-induced myocarditis and thrombotic thrombocytopenia in early 2021, despite that over 80% of the emails were redacted [1].\n\nEvery American citizen must be given access to this complete set of unredacted communications, and the guilty must be prosecuted in a special court arranged by the victims’ families.\n\nWe are still in the midst of the greatest worldwide psychological operation (Psy-Op) in the history of man. Not that long ago we were hunter-gatherers where family, purpose, cooperation and community where paramount to survival. We were never wired to withstand the level of psychological manipulation we have been experiencing the purpose of which was to invert reality so we could easily be led to slaughter. It has split our realities, and now we have two separate realities co-existing in the same space-time. The splitting of these two realities is inevitable, the only question is how will it happen.\n\nIt takes about 2 years, on average, for citizens in the United States of America (USA) to recognize they are being poisoned, for captured regulatory agencies to make some token inadequate attempt to fix the problem.\n\nNow, who captured most of these agencies that are meant to regulate and protect… well, the obvious answer is Big Pharma - nothing new and no big surprise. Agencies developed mercantile relationships with the very companies they were supposed to be regulating - kind of an economic Stockholm Syndrome. Pharma cares about one thing - profits, and we have let this psychopathic entity run policy in multiple countries. Yet, does someone control Big Pharma like the military? Or is it Big Pharma that is in control of the military?\n\nMaybe they just work hand and hand, because what we saw take place in the last few years is a Globalist military run operation where everyone seemed to be controlled by a central source… “Operation Lockstep?” if you will… even though the population was kept in the dark. After all, you just don’t announce there has been a Bio-Military coup of the US Government (along with many other countries) and expect the population will be ok with that. When it came to COVID, the FDA (Federal Drug Administration) was MIA, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) was but rubberstamping because on a practical level there was no more CDC - they became the propaganda arm of Pharma prevaricating their dark little hearts out to the public. The FDA existed in name only when it came to COVID… it was all a military operation perhaps in cooperation with China’s 5th Column war to take down the USA. The CDC actually had the Public Relations firm for Pfizer/Moderna embed themselves inside the CDC. The CDC is a regulatory agency it is not supposed to be marketing the very things they are supposed to be regulating. But then they have been doing just that for all vaccines for decades and few complained. You never have the same entity in charge of promoting, distributing (that also owns patents) on vaccines also be in charge of safety - that is a recipe for disaster.\n\nIt was an out-in-the-open fact that the NIH was funding Gain-of-Function research at the Wuhan lab [2]. In 2015, a paper was published, A SARS -like cluster of circulation bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence. This study clearly states that the authors conducted Gain-of-Function research on bat coronaviruses in order to make them infectious to primary human airway epithelial cells. Ralph Baric (University North Carolina) and colleague, Zhengli-Li Shi were very much engineering the CoV2 virus in Wuhan to make sure that virus was highly infectious to humans. So, literally everything that came out of Fauci’s mouth and the rest of the government was gas-lighting.\n\nWestern Civilization, was targeted for destruction and subjected to an intense propaganda campaign to create a permanent global government, but beneath the Psy-Op a spiritual war. Not being tangential here, but one can’t ignore these Macro disease issues - the spiritual sickness component of all this and expect to understand the Micro disease issues, such as how does one deal with the myocarditis the bioweapon causes. Part of this spiritual war is to destroy the experiment called the USA - a Constitutional Republic where rights were given by God. That doesn’t work for the imperialistic New World Order group. The USA was always the thorn in their side and had to be destroyed and they got very far along in doing so, too far it seems. Gates and Zuckerberg have poured in millions upon millions into the public education system in the USA but students have only been getting dumber and dumber, so one has to assume all that money was not to improve education but destroy it. You don’t want your future slaves to be educated - indoctrinated absolutely - but not educated. The dumbing down of Americans was by design.\n\nNature, the creative spark of life, is an anathema to this group of misanthropes who pretend they care about the environment. We are just useless eaters and bottom-feeders to them to be exploited and killed, but humanity must know the enemy to end this. If we don’t’ face this head-on then Pharma will take over the world and will make sure, for example, you can’t travel if you are over 14 and not taking a statin drug.\n\nIt was easy to lose faith in humanity when it was so obvious millions were being encouraged to illegally come to the USA (weaponized immigration) and bring one of the bio-weapons being used to destroy us from the inside. Not CoV2 but Fentanyl. Because journalists (the legacy press), was captured and carried water for these enemies and traitors, the failsafe that would have prevented all this was removed. Without the media CoV2 would have just been another flu like illness that primarily affected the elderly and those with multiple co-morbidities. Remember how the flu completely disappeared in 2020? The media truly was the virus and also made sure you didn’t know the USA was being invaded as policy - globalist United Nations policy.\n\nYet, the flu never disappeared it was just called COVID to juice the numbers in a case-demic extraordinaire (PCR tests cycled so high clean swabs would be positive). We actually saw our hospitals become de facto euthanasia factories inappropriately putting patients on ventilators and pumping them full of the deadly drug Remdesivir (what nurses called “Run-Your-Death-is Near”). I always wondered if all the videos of dancing nurses was their way of telling the public that hospitals were not being overwhelmed with COVID patients. But there was no science supporting the use of Remdesivir and it was well known as a deadly drug that was killing Ebola victims in a drug trial and its use was halted. But the regulatory gatekeepers were all compromised, fired or had resigned in disgust. The hospitals received a 20% payment bonus if they used the drug. A $500,000 hospital bill would generate an extra $150,000 if Remdesivir was used. Putting a patient on a ventilator earned the hospital $40,000. A lot of money to help hospitals make choices about priorities (wink, wink).\n\nMedia organizations played a central role, especially Big Tech IT companies, in stifling anything that wasn’t the approved narrative. Mainstream scientists, many leading experts in their field, working in prestigious institutions, and some medical journal editors themselves were all silenced, while others were paid off. Where was all the billions coming from to create fabricated research critical of effective early interventions such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Ivermectin? How much did the New England Journal of Medicine and Lancet get from FTX (the criminal crypto group) to publish articles so obviously flawed they would have been the cause of expulsion from any academic center that still had any integrity. FTX was critical in funding the attacks on effective early interventions with the resultant loss of life.\n\nFTX, backed by elite investors like BlackRock (Rockefeller Foundation) and Sequoia Capital, rapidly became one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world… laundering and stealing investor funds to bankroll the Neo-Con proxy war in Ukraine, and the Democrat party to name two pet projects. Laundering money to the “right” people, Bankman-Fried had Wall Street and the media in his pocket while he practiced effective altruism (aka deceit that makes one look like a moral leader). But it was just another Ponzi scheme that was funding favorite New World Order players. It happened right out in the open. Bankman-Fried’s mother was apparently responsible for running major voter harvesting operations in the 2020 election, so the FTX group was a critical component of a fraudulent government and its fraudulent economy. Yet, maybe FTX’s implosion was all part of a bigger scam to allow a centrally controlled digital currency to come to the fore.\n\nWonder why it was so important to keep the conflict in Ukraine going with no efforts at peace negotiations? Yeah, it was a money laundering operation and they never wanted it to end even if the end was an all-out nuclear holocaust. Few knew Ukraine was the playground for the dark ones - the local population didn’t know any more than USA citizens knew their country is actually the headquarters of the dark ones and that our Constitutional Republic vanished years ago. Drug trafficking, sex trade, organ harvesting, etc. all taking place in Ukraine without any interference until the Russian invasion. Just an aside… don’t invest with anyone who looks and smells like they can’t afford a bar of soap.\n\nPandemic/Scamdemic\n\nDecades of pandemic preparedness protocols were trashed so a psychotic, pip-squeak, criminal mastermind could enrich himself, and his loyal following (loyal because he controlled their NIH grants). It seems, based on the FOIA documents Fauci may have been telling the CIA what to do not the other way around. We were literally in the middle of a Godfather movie, but it wasn’t Don Corleone calling the shots but dog torturer, vivisectionist, Don “I am the Science.” There was some truth to that statement though, because this one man literally was the point man for distributing $10’s of billions of dollars to academic and research institutions throughout the world, so he had almost complete control of the “science.” This was a very dark, pernicious situation, for example, if a research team finds out that it is very dangerous to inject vaccines that contain aluminum (80% of vaccines contain aluminum) that research team will be defunded and journals will be told not to print their research papers.\n\nEighty-six percent of the world was shut down for an infection that had a 0.035% mortality from 0 to 59 years of age, 0.095% mortality for the post 60 set [3]. If you are younger than 20 the fatality rate was 0.0003%. Clearly, this is below fatality rates from the flu and yet this was the emergency that allowed them to bypass safety studies and force/coerce people to get an experimental injections that had never been used before and lie about what they would do. They even lied about saying the “vaccine” would prevent transmission and infection and of course was safe and effective as they say all vaccines are…safe and effective became an indoctrination mantra. Most vaccines do not have adequate safety studies despite what we have all been led to believe. This was not just regulatory maleficence - this was about trashing the U.S. Constitution and murdering as many as possible in the process.\n\nThe median/mean age of death from COVID holds steady at 82 years of age. Seventy percent of the mortality in the USA were in the elderly with six or more underlying medical conditions. If it were not going to be COVID it would have been something else as they were already beyond the average life expectancy. Over the last three years no healthy child in the USA died from a CoV2 infection… not a single healthy child.\n\nWell, we weren’t supposed to be alive to discuss any of this, but the criminal “reset” plan failed out of the starting gate because CoV2 was supposed to have killed billions and the jab was supposed to finish off as many survivors as possible. Too many people were left alive asking inconvenient questions. One of the few true responsibilities of a government is to protect the integrity of the nation’s border, but the so-called “open border” was intended to bring in a replacement population, because the rest of us were supposed to be already dead or dying.\n\nIf you can’t define the enemy you can’t defeat your enemy\n\nOne of the things that makes fleshing out these events important is medicine as we have known it will not survive - the population is losing and will soon lose completely any trust in Public Health institutions and modern medicine in general, and that trust won’t be coming back any time soon nor should it. Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) was destroyed during the last few years and public health decisions were being made on plausibility, as in how much money is it plausible to make if we force deadly injections on the public that don’t even work and lock them down?\n\nModern medicine decided to follow a dark agenda and became a dark influence. While COVID may have been a Hail Mary for the dying paradigm of the Bio-Military-Pharmaceutical complex to maintain control it still caused a lot of death and suffering. They will try and regroup if we don’t all wake-up. I will assume that post financial collapse the money to fund many of these shenanigans just won’t be there to fuel the murder. The lockdown fetishism imposed on us was an import from China as part of their 5th column attack to destroy our economy, but it was also the agenda of the NWO/WEF set.\n\nHuman history has been replete with invasions, attacks, trade wars, etc. It seems like raging war on each other was chosen to be the primary operational paradigm on this planet. For the most part they were driven by the need to eat, have land to grow food, trade routes, etc. I am not assigning blame and after all it was the crucible of our modern civilization, which I have to say has not turned out so well. Today, war is machine - unending on anything and everything be it COVID, drugs, terrorism, Afghanistan - it doesn’t matter. The population is never told the real reasons for war, which is to wash money out of our hands and into the hands of this group of dark elites. So, war is never over, there is always another and it never stops.\n\nAlexander the Great wanted to take over the world, but even he wouldn’t recognize modern war even though he was a one-man wrecking crew. Even the Roman Empire was less about cruelty, power and greed than what human kind now experiences. In the 1200s CE, the Mongol hoard pieced together the largest contagious empire the world had ever seen and unlike the plethora of wars that preceded it, this was being driven by power, cruelty, brutality without honor and greed. Energetically, Earth was being beset upon by a dark energy that was not home grown, it was only present because there were enough humans who held these negative traits for this energy to become interested in feeding off of them and the havoc they could reap. The generation of fear is key to its survival or presence on this planet - fear (the opposite of love) is the gasoline this dark force runs on.\n\nWhat does any of this ancient esoterica have to do with what we are experiencing today where the USA government, the largest empire in modern times, has become vicious, incompetent, utterly corrupt and under the control of agendas pushed from elsewhere.\n\nThey know they are lying; we know they are lying; they know we know they are lying\n\nThe Southern border of the USA was in full operational control by traitors inside the USA and that control was to keep the boarder wide open and lie about it - it is a weaponized invasion. The American people didn’t understand their country had been taken over. Since it seems politicians lie and can’t stop themselves from lying, the public lost the ability to know big lies from small lies - call it some kind of desensitization but it produced an apathy that only empowered the cabal. Institutionalized lying is a major factor that enables LIERS-IN-CHIEF to carry out their illegal, immoral and criminal practices of institutionalized discrimination, retaliation, defamation, and intellectual harassment.\n\nDeception is the modus operandi of the dark ones, which is why free speech had to be eliminated in their playbook. Puppets are never told the true reasons for doing what they are doing, only the upper tier of puppets are made privy to some of this information. For example, the CIA hitman who murdered Marylin Monroe was told she was sleeping with Castro and leaking to him things JFK had whispered to her under the sheets. Normand Hodges said he carried out 37 assassinations for the USA between 1959-1972.\n\nFollow the Money\n\nJumping ahead in this story to address one of the top puppets, Peter Daszak, who is a perfect example of how this dark energy turns the like-minded into its puppets. Can you believe that a scientist funded by the U.S. government could possibly create a virus on purpose to release it and then hype up a resulting infectious disease crisis all for profit and power? Daszak’s Eco-Health Alliance was essentially a front group for a faction of the CIA.\n\n“Daszak reiterated that, until an infectious disease crisis is very real, present, and at an emergency threshold, it is often largely ignored. To sustain the funding base beyond the crisis, he said, we need to increase public understanding of the need for MCMs (medical countermeasures) such as a pan-influenza or pan-coronavirus vaccine. A key driver is the media, and the economics follow the hype. We need to use that hype to our advantage to get to the real issues. Investors will respond if they see profit at the end of process, Daszak stated.”\n\nThe above paragraph is from page 73 of Rapid Medical Countermeasure Response to Infectious Diseases: Enabling Sustainable Capabilities Through Ongoing Public and Private-Sector Partnerships - published by the National Academy of Sciences in 2016 [4].\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nWe know so little about the true history of mankind on this planet - the great civilizations that have waxed and waned long before recorded modern history [5]. Regardless of the time or place, oligarchs of the civilizations that we do know about have been obsessed with over-population going back to at least the days of Plato (Plato [De republica, V] and Aristotle [De republica, II, vi]). While, there are some areas on the planet that have too many humans in the same space or in the wrong place, over-population itself is a myth perpetuated to help the ruling class maintain control - it is about wealth transfer. Even though most of humanity is not aware of the full extent of what has been going on, open war has been declared by those who want to repress and command with the purpose of keeping the rest of us unconscious, keep us from being inquiring beings, keep us from knowing how strong the human spirit is or exploring what we are capable of becoming. This is the emotional grid they want to impose. They want to keep us small, controlled so they can feed off of our assets and energies. They are literally deranged fools whose minds have been warped by their greed and the covenant they have made with forces that have always lied to them and continue to lie to them. This struggle is not new and is addressed in fable and parable by many of the world’s ancient texts, but this is not speculation of what has happened in the far past, this is about what is happening now and why.\n\nLose your Spirit and you have lost everything … Lionel Richi (singer/song writer)\n\nIt is problematic that humans think they are nothing more than evolved mammalian primates (apes). Yes, those are the bodies we use, but we are spiritual beings having a human experience, not just naked apes that aspire to be spiritual. Spirit is not the enthusiasm you have for your local high school football team. It would behoove us all to try and understand what spirit is because there have been those trying to kill you for having one. There are juicy energies and powers connected with being human - a subject humans are almost completely unaware; however, there are those who know about these hidden features of the human experience and want those energies and powers for themselves. Without belaboring the point, tyranny can only be imposed if the population believes they are nothing more than their animal bodies limited to their five senses. Tyranny runs on fear and it is much harder to scare someone who is not completely tied to what their five senses tell them reality is all about. Tyranny cannot exist where there is freedom of speech so it is really easy to tell who the “bad” guys are…they censor and don’t want freedom of speech.\n\nWhere this Timeline starts\n\nIn a timeline that starts in 1933, although the darkness got its foothold long before that, a group of bankers hatched a plot to replace U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt with someone who was more in line with these entrenched institutions and the systemic ideologies that do not want democracies to exist. These dark ones were still drunk on their success from being able to create the Federal Reserve. There was no coup d’état because their point man, retired Marine Corps General Smedley Butler, betrayed them. So, the banking cabal shifted all their attention to Germany.\n\nThat same year the Public Health Service of the USA began its infamous Tuskegee Experiment on poor black males in Alabama. An experiment that lasted 40 years, and only ended in 1972 because of a leak to the press. Under the guise of receiving free health care, the victims were watched to see what the ravages of syphilis would do to them and their families. No Nuremberg trial held, no accountability - but if you are an American apparently, it’s okay to say you were just following orders if caught and it’s all mea culpa and asking for amnesty.\n\nThe lessons of the last century have not been completely understood, and now humanity is in that awkward place where there is a reckoning with these poorly understood experiences that have been swept under the rug. However, the rug is now gone and it would behoove the world to recognize the players of our immediate past for who they really were. For example, Adolf Hitler was probably the greatest teacher of hate the 20th century had ever seen. Intolerance was intense in the western world a century ago, and he filled the calling others had prepared for someone with this intention and influence. He had other options for his life, which he closed down early.\n\nBringing up Hitler or suggesting we are unduly influenced by energies we can’t perceive - many will just tune out, but that is merely a reflection of how indoctrinated we have all become. Indoctrinated by negative energies that have kept us trapped for millennia in deception, delusion, fear and wars, and part of that indoctrination was to convince us we were powerless to change any of this. Rather sad that the megalomanic leading this was again a German national, Klaus Schwab. One would have thought we were done with that part of our history.\n\nIn one sentence this is what WW II was about…Hitler, like Schwab, was merely a tool for large international corporations and banks that were funding him to implement a top-down feudal economy in Europe that would hopefully expand worldwide and reign for a 1000 years or as long as they had the slaves to feed into the system. Yet, their tool became too unstable, too unpredictable and too uncontrollable as he tried to take over the entire planet. The globalists were still able to use him as a pretext for the NATO/European Union (EU) paradigm to control Europe. Now, with both the inspiration for Hitler and much of his financial support coming from inside the USA, it was no surprise that Operation Paperclip brought so many Nazi scientists and technocrats to the USA after the kinetic war was completed (~30,000 Nazis). The American Nazis; although, they did not call themselves Nazis, brought their assets back while Hitler himself, a deletant compared to the fools who have made war against us today, was allowed to retire to South America [6].\n\nThe eugenicists in America (and to some extent England) were a great influence and inspiration to the Nazi regime and in fact it was a part of the defense used in the Nuremberg trials to justify the programs they implemented. But there were other influencers as well, and they may still be present today. The upper tier of Nazidom were deeply into the dark side of occult esoterica. The swastika itself was an ancient symbol of the universe so what the Nazi’s did was use that symbol rotating to the left or counter-clockwise - a symbol of a devolving universe, not an evolving universe shown when it rotates to the right [7].\n\nThis symbol drew in those worldwide who knew what it meant (rotating counter clockwise), which is why, for example, dead Tibetans were reported to have been found among the casualties in WW II… sorcerers perhaps enlisted to help with dark rituals. Rituals are really important to the puppets of darkness as it provides them with a sense of power. They are now flaunting some of their rituals in the open, just to name three - the weird closing Olympic ceremony in London 2012, which heralded a plague that would put many in hospital [8]. In late 2021, the rapper Travis Scott’s Astroworld performance was not only overtly satanic but murders (human sacrifices?) took place during the performance. In 2022, the overtly satanic advertisements of Balenciaga.\n\nIt would surprise many to find out just who these puppets of darkness have been and currently are. For example, Madeleine Albright, former Secretary of State, was celebrated when she passed in 2022, despite being a mass murderer. She publicly announced the sanctions that were imposed on Iraq that killed over half a million children were worth it. Research who has attended the ceremonies at Bohemian Grove (Northern California) where they worship the false deity Molech, and you may be surprised [9]. Then there is the Bilderberg/Davos group and their High Priests (that is literally what they call themselves) - a smarmier group of international corporate scum and villainy you will never find. The World Economic Forum (WEF) is just a front group for these power crazed psychopaths who draw into their circle those who are in synch with them (the Law of Attraction), and they may not all be human, which is almost a guarantee.\n\nConsider the possibility that we are part of a universe replete with life and intelligences of all types and strips be they seen or unseen - trillions upon trillions of conscious beings to a greater or lesser degree. It is regrettable that humans are so unaware, and so misinformed about our participation in the cosmos and we are even less aware of non-humans in the affairs of our lives and our planet. Some seem to be divinely angelic; some are more like predatory parasites.\n\nAs questionable as the influence of these low vibrational “others” might be, they probably weren’t responsible for the descent of certain governments into satanic, murderous, pedophile networks used to control and manipulate those that entered the halls of power. Pedophilia is the sick glue that holds their system together. The dark ones know children, especially young children, are closer to Source and by defiling them, by being brutal and cruel one is showing God that you are a counterion - an angry counterion. Why would you want to show God you are an angry counterion? Seems counter-intuitive, but foolish humans believed the promises made to them about personal power and wealth, so for the weak minded… that apparently is all it takes, an unfortunately there are many with weak minds.\n\nThis is beyond mere corruption; world governments had been bled out from the inside by these global predators. In fact, international banks, working with Pfizer, successfully executed a planetary coup against the nation-state. Pfizer is the most criminally fined corporation in America that admitted in front of the EU that they never tested the COVID injection to see if it would stop transmission or infection. Of course now we know it doesn’t.\n\nMany pharmaceutical interventions do more than advertised. For example, one can’t wean cold-turkey off of SSRI’s even when substituting a serotonin analog, such as saffron, because SSRI’s do more than what they claim to do - they do far more than just inhibit serotonin reuptake. SSRIs such as Prozac, seem to hijack dopamine receptors to name one [3].\n\nWhile the public is/was told mRNA is ephemeral in the body, a truth, what was not told was billions were being injected not with mRNA but modRNA, which is not ephemeral and it is no secret that it is programmed to make more than just the spike protein as per Pfizer’s own documentation:\n\n“Self-amplifying mRNA (saRNA): saRNA is a platform that uses a much larger molecule because not only does it encode the antigen of interest, but four additional proteins. These extra proteins allow the cell to make more copies of the mRNA, resulting in more protein being expressed from a smaller dose” [4].\n\nThis bears repeating... these injections do not deliver natural mRNA but a modified version with extended stability which causes the cells of the body to produce unnatural proteins in addition to the spike protein but the true purpose of these proteins and what they are creating is unknown and on a practical level their presence is undisclosed. Be that as it may, the injection is clearly a gene-therapy and should have been labeled and regulated as such.\n\nIn the spring of 2020, the definition of vaccine was changed from something that would reduce infection and transmission to something that would reduce hospitalization, or the severity of the disease after receiving multiple injections - that violated the CDC’s own published rules on what a vaccine is supposed to be [5]. The public was lied to by saying it was a vaccine when it was an “experimental gene-therapy“ as per Moderna and BioNTech’s own filings - at least until April of 2020. They called it a vaccine so people would take it, because vaccines are the sacred cows of conventional medicine and everyone is preprogrammed to believe they are all “safe & effective,” because an authority figure told them it was and most in the First World have been carefully conditioned to concede our common sense or discernment to authority figures.\n\nThe manufacturers could legally lie about safety because in 2018 the legal definition of an adverse event was changed to being only something the medical literature or medical consensus had previously noted was an untoward sequelae of that injection. It would not have mattered if the injection gave every recipient myocarditis if that was not previously delineated - it would not be an adverse event.\n\nWhile few are aware the injections are making multiple proteins this fact is clearly spelled out by Pfizer itself. Granted Pfizer has zero to no credibility for anything they write or say, but they seem to be very transparent about revealing the injection is making “these extra proteins.” They are admitting to four additional proteins; however, there may be many more unintended, and undisclosed proteins being made. Pfizer very much wanted to keep their clinical data sealed for 75 years, so they had a lot to hide.\n\nWhat are these extra proteins and what are they doing in the human body and what could go wrong? How about death?\n\nNote the words “self-amplifying,” because one might correctly assume that these other proteins are critical to self-amplification. Is there a connection between, for example, these never-seen-before massive clots found in so many deceased jab victims and these self-amplifying bio-nano machines?\n\nWar on humanity became fully operational but not recognized as such because there were no helmets, guns, bombs or bullets. Need proof? A systematic review of autopsy findings in deaths after Covid-19 injections revealed that 73.9% of those deaths were caused by or significantly contributed to by the Covid-19 injections [6].\n\nPerusing the Moderna patent issued in April of 2023 (US patent number 11,622,972 B2) entitled: Lipid nanoparticle compositions and methods for formulating same, you can see that that these stealth nanoparticles are chock full of plastic polymers many of which are carcinogenic and toxic Phthalates. Phthalates are most often used as plasticizers that allow plastics to be more flexible, durable and long lasting. If the COVID injection were actually a vaccine these chemicals would be (and should have been) labeled as adjuvants or excipients, and subjected to safety evaluations.\n\nOf course, safety gets side-stepped when no one even bothers to look or evaluate for same, and this is by design. It was already known many Phthalates are toxic endocrine disrupters, and should never have been allowed in these injections without adequate safety considerations, but ipso facto…safety is not a consideration in today’s captured regulator environment. Phthalate exposure alone is responsible for 100,000 deaths in America every year with a societal cost of almost $40 billion a year [7]. Why do you think testosterone levels have been crashing to use but one example?\n\nHydrogels\n\nComplex organic polymers are called Hydrogels. Hydrogel-forming natural polymers include recognizable proteins such as fibrin and collagen. The Pfizer Lipid nanoparticles [8] are the constituents of hydrogels and again the question is what is being made by these constituents?\n\nRemember the spike protein is a pathogen. So, it is of interest that the CoV-2 spike protein S1 alone induces fibrin(ogen) resistance to fibrinolysis. So, just the massive production of the spike protein alone by the cells of the human body could be causing these massive clots being seen today in those who have experienced post-injection thrombi that the body cannot destroy [9]. We have all heard the reassurances that mRNA does not affect DNA so not to worry your genome is safe, and indeed mRNA does not affect DNA, but modRNA has a direct effect on DNA [10].\n\nAt the very least injected breastfeeding mothers and organ donors who underwent the COVID-19 injection almost certainly transfer worrisome modRNA, adenoviral DNA, spike protein, and or anti-platelet factor-4 antibodies (vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia or VITT) to their close contacts [11].\n\nVITT are these weird elongated clots pulled from the vaccinated dead. Platelets are activated in a novel and deadly manner to create an immune complex hydrogel. This is accomplished by platelet-activating anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies. It is still a mystery as to what sets this off. No one is accusing the spike protein, but if not the spike protein could it be one of the many additional proteins the modRNA is instructing the cells to create? Or is it the undisclosed presence of Graphene oxide (GO) known to self-assemble?\n\nInjecting modRNA, which does not seem to degrade in many - i.e. it is not ephemeral - could have serious repercussions on over-all mortality post injection, to say the least, by the pernicious disruption of the human genome. To believe, and this is about faith not science, that biopolymer particle (BP) vaccine technology is a benign intervention ready for prime time for a whole host of potential conditions is the height of arrogance and hubris in the face of the mounting death toll in the countries most heavily Injected.\n\nFear is the Mind Killer\n\nProviding some additional background context, the Gain-of-Function work that created CoV2 was funded by the United States Government and approved by Anthony Fauci. The bagman was Peter Daszak of Eco-Health Alliance, who as of this writing is still getting millions in NIH grants. Yet, the apparent deliberate release of the CoV2 virus must have been big disappointment as it was hoped it would have killed billions and the injection, called a vaccine, was only meant to do clean-up. Since CoV2 didn’t perform as hoped the roll-out of the injection had to be moderated as not to draw too much attention to the death toll or those asking too many questions given there were too many still alive to ask those questions, so certain batches were not as problematic as others. Never evaluated to see if it would stop transmission or infection, because that was never the intention of the jab - the intention was democide. One need look no further than Canada to prove that point - those with vaccine injuries are being offered free euthanasia. Now, we all know the jab neither stopped transmission nor infection. The mass indiscriminate use of the modRNA vaccine was catastrophic but then wasn’t it meant to be?\n\nIt was also imperative any options for early treatment be extinguished lest that interfere with the injection roll-out, so hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin were demonized, while hospitals were being incentivized to literally murder COVID patients by intubation and the use of the ineffective and deadly drug Remdesivir. Unsupportable medical protocols were strictly enforced. Admitting a patient and labeling them a COVID patient was worth $11K to the hospital, $39K if they were intubated. Using Remdesivir and Versed as the only pharmaceutical protocol gave hospitals a 10 percent bonus on the total bill, so by using Remdesivir a typical $500K hospital bill would garner an extra $150K for the hospital. That is why all other treatments were forbidden.\n\nTruly, this was probably the single greatest crime against humanity in the modern history of mankind. The world was told what they were going to do in 2015, but the world was asleep. At the end of February 2024, Russia submitted a 2,000-page report to the United Nations documenting the bio-security deep state and pharma manufactured the COVID event naming influential figures within the US political landscape who orchestrated the Covid-19 pandemic as part of a global domination strategy. Among those named as participants in this scheme are Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and George Soros, implying their involvement in a conspiracy against humanity. This is really the overlooked big picture, there were a colluding set of conspirators both in industry and in the public sector that orchestrated the plandemic, and well planned it was. No one was allowed to question anything because it had been decided everyone would get the injection.\n\nThese individuals must be exposed lest they take matters into their own hands to hide their crimes in the chaos they are still very much capable of creating. For example, thousands of foreign military or para-military combatants were brought through the open boarder into the United States just waiting for the word to activate and pillage, rape and destroy United States citizens inside their own country. Then again, it could just be that new and improved infectious bio-weapon Bill Gates seems to be so anxious to unleash. The crime was not committed solely by Big Pharma, they were just the arms dealers - the crime is what allowed them to be arms dealers - this ongoing war on humanity itself - that is the crime. This is beyond the scope of this perspective but the elites want a return to feudalism with a vastly reduced planetary population -an 80 to 90 percent reduction. These individuals are detached from reality, but have never suffered the consequences.\n\nThe first patent [12] on CoV2 was back in 2002, but in 2019 Moderna filed four patents that had previously been rejected, “Because of concern for the reemergence or a deliberate release of the SARS coronavirus, vaccine development was initiated.” That is only something you say because you know what the plan is - no different than when Fauci announced in 2017 that Trump would face a surprise infectious disease outbreak...surprise? If anyone announced their local bank would experience a surprise robbery don’t you think that person would be a prime suspect?\n\nIn the fall of 2019, the WHO announced it would conduct a worldwide exercise to be ready for the release of a “rapidly spreading pandemic due to a lethal respiratory virus…which would impose additional preparedness requirements”. The “criminals” announced in advance what they were going to do and no one seemed to care but for literally a handful of individuals that were dismissed as conspiracy theorists. Did the lethal respiratory virus exercise also include distributing the virus to multiple locations around the world? Because it is clear this infection did not come from a wet-market in December of 2019. CoV2 circulating for months before that. Release implies intention and distribution; it does not imply an accident of happenstance. One could infer the WHO was actually involved in its release and the so-called exercise may have been far more than just an exercise.\n\nThen came the diabolically dishonest cover-up. The distrust in government and public health edicts has grown exponentially as a result. More dangerous than CoV2 was the shutdown of free-speech, and of course self-righteous politicians and technocrats who knew nothing about the actual science were eager to censor, terminate, or delicense anyone who didn’t agree with the narrative they were pushing. The government used proxies to silence those asking inconvenient questions or had information that would expose the narrative. The FBI and DHS were meeting weekly with the high-tech platforms to make sure those platforms took down or suppressed information they disagreed with. Meanwhile, “I am the Science” Anthony Fauci’s emails from January 2020 showed he was well aware the NIH was funding Gain-of-Function research in Wuhan; nevertheless, the public was told the opposite (the least of his crimes). It is doubtful he will ever be prosecuted for anything, because in the United States there is now a two-tier system of justice where what is called lawfare is used to minimize anyone who threatens the elite’s plan for world dominance. If this is allowed to continue the judicial system in the United States will collapse and take the rest of the country with it.\n\nPhysicians could have stopped this tragedy but in the United States 85 percent of physicians work for institutions and those that knew better still feared more about their employment than doing the right thing. This is what happens when you have the corporate practice of medicine. So, modern conventional medicine went down a very dark path created 100 years ago by the Rockefeller Foundation. There was a pernicious turn from science to scientism, which is a non-evidence-based mix of scientific dogma and magical thinking that is meant to serve those in control or wanting to be in control.\n\nConsidering the rush is on to completely bypass informed consent and aerosolize this technology [13] it is critical to understand and expose the insanity of how this democide was carried out - an understanding that has yet to happen, so its instigators are still at it and are desperate for the next wave of infectious disease genocide they have up their sleeves if for no other purpose than to cover their tracks from their crimes related to COVID.\n\nThe public has been bombarded with distractions, from UFO’s, Drag Queen Story Time, George Floyd, January 6th, the drug and slave trade on the deliberately open southern border, DEI, men having babies, the climate change hoax, and unending wars in multiple locations. This was all orchestrated to invert reality so that the real crime would not be noticed - that a colluding set of misanthropes caused this all to happen. These conspirators knew the plandemic was coming and played their roles to make sure it took place. This information has been in the public domain now for over a decade, as per Peter Daszak’s 2015 presentation to the National Academy of Science:\n\n“Daszak reiterated that, until an infectious disease crisis is very real, present, and at an emergency threshold, it is often largely ignored. To sustain the funding base beyond the crisis, he said, we need to increase public understanding of the need for MCMs (medical counter- measures) such as a pan-influenza or pan-coronavirus vaccine. A key driver is the media, and the economics follow the hype. We need to use that hype to our advantage to get to the real issues. Investors will respond if they see profit at the end of process, Daszak stated” [14].\n\nBut it goes back farther to 2005 when Ralph Baric gave the DARPA lecture: “Synthetic Coronaviruses. Biohacking: Biological Warfare Enabling Technologies. June 2005 Washington DC: DARPA/MITRE sponsored event”.\n\nWhy are we still debating where the virus came from?\n\nRalph Baric, the scientist who made the weaponized CoV2 virus, at the University of North Carolina, actually published the treatment for the bioweapon in 2010: Zn(2+) inhibits coronavirus and arterivirus RNA polymerase activity in vitro and zinc ionophores block the replication of these viruses in cell culture [15].\n\nNo surprise that the creator of the Gain-of-Function virus would have a countermeasure if for no other reason than his own protection. The public has been conditioned for years to accept fear-based narratives without questioning them and to surrender their own discernment for whatever the authority says is going on and what should be done. Combine that with the assault on our I.Q.’s with toxins, such as fluoridated water, pesticides, and a poor educational system to the point where we couldn’t see the information under our noses - the elites were fearless in their ability to pull off this great democide and will try again if they are not exposed.\n\nReferences\n\nYuyang Lei., et al. “SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Impairs Endothelial Function via Downregulation of ACE 2”. Circulation Research 128 (2021): 1323-1326.\n\nThe release of CoV2 did not cause a pandemic as planned, but a criminal cabal decided to run with it nevertheless. It affected the very old with multiple co-morbidities, the obese and the medically compromised just like the flu does every year. The flu itself mysteriously vanished during this plandemic, because the cabal needed to count flu victims as COVID victims - essentially almost anyone dying of anything was counted as a COVID victim. The planning component of the plandemic was out in the open in both the medical literature and in plenary sessions, such as Event 201. The script of Event 201 (October 19, 2019) was the exact script run 3 months later in December of 2019 and later in 2020, including the lockdowns and other restrictions, which caused far more morbidity and mortality than the virus itself. No healthy child succumbed to COVID, which was almost non-existent on the continent of Africa where millions take ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine as part of their routine malaria prophylaxis or iverm ctin as part of the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC).\n\nFu-Ming Zhou., et al. \"Corelease of Dopamine and Serotonin from Striatal Dopamine Terminals\".

Further, the FDA said one would not be counted as immunized until 2 weeks after the second injection. So, one was counted as unvaccinated until 2 weeks post the second injection. One did not have an adverse event post vaccination unless the medical literature already listed that adverse event as a risk from that injection.\n\nHulscher N., et al. “A Systematic Review of Autopsy Findings in Deaths after COVID-19 Vaccination”.

Kept down in kindergarten for adolescence and held in the 3rd grade to a great extent because of impulsivity, Avery is as yet attempting to defeat a standing of being wild.\n\nQuickly flustered and having a limited ability to focus, Avery has a low disappointment resistance. His couple of companions are frequently furious with him. Different children could do without having him as a component of their helpful work-gatherings.\n\nEach school year has been a battle for him scholastically with Avery scarcely passing, partially, because he neglects to record tasks or complete them or even to turn in tasks in the wake of completing them. Persistently baffled, frequently feeling that everybody is against him, Avery challenges his educators and invests energy consistently in the key's office for hollering out in class or for offering situationally improper remarks. Avery does not plan to disrupt the norms or to cause problems; it just consistently appears to happen to him. The drug he takes helps some yet he would rather not take it and doesn't believe that different children should be aware of it. He needs to go to secondary school one year from now, yet Avery doesn't know if he can hang on that long; furthermore, he is terrified of the change: \"If I am scarcely making it in center school, how might I handle secondary school?\" The reality of the situation is that Avery truly doesn't feel like he has a place or fits in at school or elsewhere.\n\n\"Avery\" is a composite of understudies recognizable to this analyst. For youngsters like him, incorporating scores of thousands with ADHD, the impacts of dissatisfaction, discipline, dismissal, disappointment, and disarray over the years are combined and crushing. Research has shown that understudies determined to have ADHD are at an outrageous gamble for scholastic disappointment. The review demonstrates that understudies with ADHD are three to multiple times as possible as the normal understudy to drop out of school.\n\nScholastic and social disappointment for understudies with ADHD is unavoidable and total, making it extremely challenging to keep on remaining in school and register (Anastopoulos et al., 2018). Understudies with ADHD ordinarily experience difficulty with concentrating, and putting together, as well similarly as making sure to finish scholastic responsibilities. They experience difficulty with peer connections, are frequently youthful, and show a failure to sort out what to do in friendly circumstances or to alter their conduct given social criticism. Their associations with grown-ups are frequently stressed by their pugnacity and impulsivity. However, considering this large number of side effects/deterrents for scholarly achievement, an amazing 65% of the understudies with ADHD truly do figure out how to move on from secondary school and many alumni with good grades (Anastopoulos et al., 2021). The capacity to conquer weakening troubles brings up the issue: How do so many understudies with ADHD effectively complete their kindergarten through twelfth-grade insight notwithstanding the entanglements from ADHD, which frequently remember for going negative encounters at school?\n\nWhile much consideration in momentum research has been dedicated to understudy dropouts in the general and minority populaces, incorporating quitters both with and without ADHD, there has been less spotlight on distinguishing those elements or conditions that urge ADHD in Students 6 understudies with ADHD to remain in school. Wolin and Wolin (1993) supported research on the effective elements in the existence of understudies, proposing specialists ought to examine people who have effectively conquered pessimistic obstructions. This is such a review. The capacity of specific understudies with ADHD to continue in school, particularly when the school climate is much of the time the most overpowering test these understudies have, seems perplexing (DuPaul et al., 2017).\n\nThe understudies' industriousness calls the inquiry: What variables urge understudies to remain in school and prevail despite the impediments introduced by the side effects of ADHD?\n\nProblem Statement\n\nOver 1.9 million young kids experience the ill effects of ADHD, the indications of which put them at a high gamble of exiting school. However, regardless of encountering rehashed and ongoing social dismissal and scholastic disappointment and disappointment, 1.2 million of these understudies will procure their secondary school recognition. Many of these understudies will likewise go on onto school or professional school, some proceeding with ADHD side effects and issues. A survey of the writing demonstrates that while the concentration in this space exists, insufficient is known or perceived in regards to the elements which add to scholastic accomplishment for youths and youthful grown-ups with ADHD, explicitly the impact of locus of control, adapting capacity, and grown-up help. An unmistakable comprehension of what upholds and spurs understudies with ADHD to succeed scholastically doesn't exist, nor is there an intensive comprehension of individual characteristics or of alleviating factors that cultivate the understudies' scholarly achievement (Dvorsky et al., 2017). This study looked for replies to questions in regards to medications which were seen by understudies with ADHD to be scholastically strong.\n\nLiterature Review\n\nADHD is an undeniably pervasive neurological condition that causes or fuels many learning, social, and enthusiastic issues for the two understudies and grown-ups. ADHD is assessed to influence 3-5% of all young youngsters, for certain examinations recommending an event pace of 10-20%.\n\nSomewhere in the range of 1.59 and 2.1 million understudies in America have this issue, ordered to the American Psychiatric Association (Ewe, 2019). The center issues of ADHD-Impulsivity are hyperactivity, impulsivity, and absence of constancy. The center issues of ADHD-Inattention will be obliviousness and mental gradualness or drowsiness in performing perceptual-engine speed assignments. People may likewise have a combination of absentmindedness and impulsivity.\n\nADHD as a problem has center signs in consideration guidelines, action level regulation, and impulsivity. The key areas, which are attributes of the problem, are having extreme trouble with accomplishment in school, regardless of whether learning handicaps are available; introducing rebellion, hostility, and other solitary ways of behaving; and, dismissal by peers. Measurably, these key area highlights of ADHD place people with the problem at a basic gamble of exiting secondary school before graduation (Jansen et al., 2019). Measurements shift marginally for certain examinations showing that somewhere in the range of 35 and 40% of understudies with ADHD truly do leave school early and without a certificate. Battles looked by understudies tested by consideration deficiencies, if joined by hyperactivity, have been very much archived in late writing. This is especially obvious with what Aust (1994) alludes to as the \"staggering social/passionate and instructive aftermaths of having ADHD.\"\n\nResearch demonstrates that one explanation ADHD kids are challenging to raise and instruct is because as little youngsters, they oftentimes display over the top (in recurrence and ADHD in Students 8 force) ways of behaving like hissy fits and tenacity. Guardians keep up with the fact that kids and young people with ADHD require significantly more observation and management than their non ADHD peers.\n\nYoungsters with ADHD are accounted for to be m metal clumsy and to have a higher occurrence of issues, for example, inadvertent poisonings and genuine actual wounds because of their impulsivity (LaCount et al., 2018). More established kids with ADHD frequently foster attendant or existing together ways of behaving like hostility (verbal and physical), lying, insubordination, taking, delinquency, as well as expanded paces of wretchedness, uneasiness, a d lead or oppositional messes.
