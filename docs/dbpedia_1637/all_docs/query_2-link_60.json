Alongside interviews with the original developers, the game is now available with the Uplink mini-campaign, Steam Deck support, updated graphics settings, new multiplayer maps, and some bonus restored goodies.\n\nThe Half-Life saga is the story of Gordon Freeman, a physicist who finds himself at the center of resistance to an alien invasion that threatens the future of humanity. From Valve's 1998 debut game onward, the series has been at the forefront of immersive action and storytelling. In March 2020, that legacy continues as Half-Life: Alyx pushes VR to new dimensions."
