Although a co-authored study did not, as originally planned, result from those early discussions, I am grateful to both colleagues for providing the initial stimulus for this project, and to Simon in particular for providing characteristically crisp advice when I was in the ‘sagging’ middle stages of the writing process. Simon’s reflections on Doctor Who (and on other matters) have suffused my own for most of our lives, and it is impossible not to see him as hovering, Hermes-like, over much of the work I have done here. One of the great delights of my academic involvement with Doctor Who has been that it has led me over the years into encounters with creative individuals of extraordinary calibre. Two of these have made vital contributions to the life of this text. I am indebted to my dear friend June Hudson for the ravishing cover illustrations, and to Paul Magrs for supplying me with the book’s title, TARDISbound. I will add that both these artists have inspired me as much with their work at large as with their direct involvement in this book. A number of colleagues at the University of Redlands, and other members of the campus community, have influenced this book in one way or another through provocative suggestions, pointed questions and trenchant comments, including Priya Jha, Bill McDonald, Ted Pearson, Kelly Hankin, Kathy Feeley, Leslie Brody and Nancy Carrick. Eliza Rodriguez y Gibson has played a crucial supportive role, too broad in scope to define here easily, offering critique,\n\nBritton_Prelims.indd vii\n\n3/22/2011 4:14:51 PM\n\nviii\n\nTARDISbound\n\nconversation or cocktails as required. In the course of the book’s preparation, Liza’s and my research interests have come evermore fully into alignment, and it has been a privilege to enjoy with her the kind of scholarly camaraderie and reciprocation I always imagined the academy would supply but had never before actually experienced. I should like to acknowledge the support of former and ongoing colleagues in the erstwhile Department of Art and Art History at Redlands who in different ways encouraged or supported my work on this book during a very difficult period: Raúl Acero, Cara Cole, Ann Marie Leimer, Jacob Ristau and our administrative assistant Jo Nuño. I’m enormously grateful for the tireless and patient support (and the wicked humour) of Sandi Richey, Head of Circulation Services and Inter-library Loan at the Armacost Library – and indeed to all members of the library staff, not least former Director Jean Swanson. Thanks also to the staff of the University of California Riverside’s Rivera Library who administer the Eaton Collection of Science Fiction, Fantasy, Horror and Utopian Literature; the ready accessibility of materials in this collection has been a great boon during the preparation of this volume. Via sundry online forums, email conversations, and Facebook posts I have benefited from support, comments and information from Kelly Hale, Stuart Douglas, Philip Purser-Hallard and Simon Bucher-Jones. I am grateful, as ever, for ongoing intermittent contact with Ian Potter who continues to complicate and upset my ideas in very useful ways. Siôn Gibson offered wonderful encouragement at two crucial moments. Students in recent seminars on visual culture, film and television costume and television aesthetics have significantly modified my thinking about much of the material in this book, especially Liz Brooks, Mia Buckland, Myranda Hunter, Molly Irelan and Michaela Petrovich. My commissioning editor, Philippa Brewster, has been a model of patience and a fund of common sense as this text shambled unsteadily towards belated completion. I am most grateful to her for encouraging me to submit the proposal which ultimately led to this book’s being picked up by I.B.Tauris, and for all mercies ever since, including the opportunity to revisit my text in the wake of the Eleventh Doctor’s arrival on screen.\n\nBritton_Prelims.indd viii\n\n3/28/2011 4:36:17 PM\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nix\n\nWithout my student research assistant, Nicholas K. Zaharopoulos, this volume would certainly never have been finished. Nick was shrewd enough to anticipate my needs better than I could forecast them, and he calmly relieved me of burdens and removed obstacles in my path more times than I can remember. Words cannot express my relief that the manuscript was essentially complete before he graduated from Redlands. I never taught Nick in class, but I learnt a lot from him. Last, paraphrasing Hitchcock, I should like to acknowledge the four most important contributors to the successful completion of this book: the first is a dauntingly able and imaginative scholar; the second is a colleague of unswerving integrity and tenacity; the third is my spouse and co-carer for three dogs and a cat; the fourth is as fine a cook as ever performed miracles in a domestic kitchen (not least on nights when it was really my turn to make dinner) – and their names are Anne Cavender.\n\nBritton_Prelims.indd ix\n\n3/22/2011 4:14:52 PM\n\nBritton_Prelims.indd x\n\n3/22/2011 4:14:53 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nD\n\noctor Who was first the subject of a book-length scholarly study in 1983; this was Doctor Who: The Unfolding Text by John Tulloch and Manuel Alvarado.1 The subtitle of the volume clearly signals the authors’ conception of their subject: The Unfolding Text implies both that Doctor Who was ongoing (it was to remain in continuous production on BBC TV until 1989) and – more importantly for my purposes in the present book – that it was a unified, monolithic phenomenon. This last point was hardly controversial at the time. Doctor Who had been devised for television and still principally existed in cultural consciousness as such. For some commentators, the claim that Doctor Who is primarily, if not exclusively, a television phenomenon still holds good. This has been the position of both James Chapman and Kim Newman who have published critical-historical studies of Doctor Who since its triumphant revival on BBC television in 2005.2 My book focuses on Doctor Who as a media phenomenon which is firmly established not only in the television cosmos but also, to borrow a well-known phrase from Doctor Who itself, in relative dimensions. For this reason it seems appropriate to begin by considering briefly the kind of text that Doctor Who was when Tulloch and Alvarado wrote their book, and to contrast this with its recent conditions of existence. In the early 1980s Doctor Who aired for thirteen weeks of each year. For the other nine months it existed only in memory, which could be rekindled in a number of ways. Chief among the consumer\n\nBritton_Intro.indd 1\n\n2/28/2011 3:24:33 AM\n\n2\n\nTARDISbound\n\n‘spin-offs’ from the series was a line of novella-length adaptations from Target Books, aimed at juvenile and teen readers. By the programme’s twentieth anniversary in late November 1983, this series of novelizations had encompassed over eighty of the Doctor’s broadcast adventures. There was also a monthly magazine from Marvel Comics, which contained production photographs from the series as well as original comic-strip narratives, and two commemorative publications appeared in 1983, one from Radio Times and the other from W. H. Allen, Target’s parent company. Both contained histories of the show and interviews with cast and crew, and both were lavishly illustrated. This was more or less the full extent of ‘secondary’ textual manifestations of the series, apart from special materials available to hard-core fans through one of the Doctor Who appreciation societies. Nor was it possible for many devotees to relive the pleasures of the television serials by reviewing them. In the UK at least, video recorders were still not the cheaply obtainable commodities that they were to become. Even for those affluent enough to possess one, Doctor Who episodes from the pre-home-video days of the 1960s and 1970s were not yet available on commercial cassettes. For the rest of us (if we were obsessive enough), homemade audio recordings together with one commercial LP of a screened adventure, Genesis of the Daleks (1975) could provide a partial surrogate when the television series was not airing. By the time Doctor Who celebrated its fortieth anniversary, the situation was very different. In 2003 Doctor Who was no longer a single text, unfolding along a trajectory defined by the production and consumption rhythms of real-time broadcasting. Although the television series had been out of production for nearly fifteen years, its archive was more accessible than it had ever been, through continuously cycling repeats on satellite and cable television and a near-comprehensive series of commercial video releases (gradually being superseded by a library of DVDs). Furthermore, the cancellation of the television programme in 1990 had led to the emergence of other officially sanctioned manifestations of Doctor Who. In 1991 Virgin Publishing, which had bought out W. H. Allen and its subsidiary, Target, was licensed to produce original Doctor Who novels. First came the New Adventures, which notionally took up where the television-series narrative had left off in 1989, and then in 1994, the\n\nBritton_Intro.indd 2\n\n2/28/2011 3:24:34 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nMissing Adventures, which, as the name implies, interpolated stories among the original television episodes. The Doctor briefly flashed across television screens again in 1996 in a BBC/Universal TV film which was meant to inaugurate a series but failed to do so. Soon afterwards, the BBC revoked Virgin’s license and initiated another twin series of original novels, published in-house. The Missing Adventures gave way to Past Doctor Adventures, while a parallel sequence followed the exploits of the new television incarnation, as played by Paul McGann. In 1999, the BBC granted another licence, this time to Big Finish Productions, a company specializing in high-quality, straight-to-CD audio dramas. The company’s artistic directors coaxed three of the stars of the original series back to play the Doctor in serials which mimicked the television programme’s serial-within-a-series format. In 2001 Paul McGann renewed his currency as the official Doctor of the moment by also agreeing to feature in Big Finish’s monthly releases. His adventures were even issued in unbroken ‘seasons’ unlike the haphazardly released audios starring his colleagues (which thus became, in effect, audio equivalents of the Missing Adventures). When the new Doctor Who television series, starring Christopher Eccleston, began airing in 2005, he was therefore one Doctor among several. The same has been true for his successors, David Tennant and Matt Smith, since Big Finish continues to produce monthly audios featuring the Fifth to Eighth Doctors (and until the end of 2009 published quarterly short-story collections featuring the first eight Doctors), while in 2009 and 2010 Tom Baker has resumed the role in two BBC CD series written by Paul Magrs. Just as significantly, the new television programme shares its claim to authenticity with occasional BBC-published novels featuring the current Doctor and his companions. A more particular symptom of the new ways in which texts are circulated and recycled in the early twenty-first century is the ‘bleeding’ between forms. In conceptual terms, as should be evident from arguments throughout this book, it is difficult to make any hardand-fast claims for the primacy of the original television series as the point of departure for the new one: the Virgin New Adventures, the BBC books and the Big Finish audios had considerable influence on the tenor of the Davies/Moffat Doctor Who. Nor, in the age of easy cross-media communication, do the various forms of Doctor Who\n\nBritton_Intro.indd 3\n\n2/28/2011 3:24:34 AM\n\n4\n\nTARDISbound\n\nnecessarily stay within their original contexts. For example, when it became clear that the Eccleston series was a hit in 2005, the BBC was quick to optimize media saturation, concurrently broadcasting a quartet of the Big Finish commercial CD releases (featuring the McGann Doctor) on the digital radio channel BBC 7. Among popular culture texts of the last half-century, Doctor Who is far from unique in migrating from its original textual world to others. To name three prominent parallels, secret agent James Bond had infiltrated media other than Ian Fleming’s books by the early 1960s, less than a decade after his literary debut, while the universes of Star Wars and Star Trek have, since the late 1970s, expanded far beyond their medium of origin. Yet in all these other cases, work in the primary medium alone tends to be considered ‘canon’ by purists. This may in turn explain why James Chapman’s and Kim Newman’s recent book-length studies treat the new television series of Doctor Who as the principal and legitimate heir to the classic series. While I do not discount the interest or importance of questions of canonicity – especially for some fans, and by extension for the systems of consumption, production and academic analysis that have grown up around fans3 – I have chosen not to focus much on these issues, or be limited by them. In principle I give equal weight to all the textual forms in which Doctor Who has materialized, whatever the intended audience or readership. In practice, for reasons mostly of personal preference, I concentrate on the television series, novels and audio-dramas, with a few supplementary references to original comic strips. On the other hand, this book is not meant as a comprehensive survey of Doctor Who in different media. In the course of my study I do tease out distinctions, primarily between Doctor Who on television and the licensed audios and novels produced between the end of the original or ‘classic’ series and the beginning of the new. However, I also stress commonalities and continuities across media, for example tracing some of the ways in which the licensed novels have influenced all subsequent texts in terms of tone and orientation. Because I am de facto offering a more wide-ranging account of Doctor Who than earlier commentators, a few other caveats should be entered. Unlike the recent, estimable volumes by Chapman and Newman, mine is not intended as a critical history of Doctor Who.\n\nBritton_Intro.indd 4\n\n2/28/2011 3:24:35 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nSo while I hope to offer a provocative complement to these earlier studies, I do not presume to supplement them. My own study of Doctor Who is not even organized chronologically: it consists of theme-based essays, most of which could, in principle, be read more or less independently of one another. Each of these ranges freely through and across the texts of Doctor Who: individual chapters only ever trace the linear ‘unfolding’ of those texts if this is a function of the discursive framework. For the most part, to borrow an apt phrase from Pat Harrigan and Noah Wardrip-Fruin, I treat the instantiations of Doctor Who in its different media universes as ‘elements of a vast fictional quilt.’4 Although the chapters of this volume are meant to work cumulatively, they could in principle be read separately since I use a variety of theoretical lenses. In Chapter One I offer an overview of patterns and inconsistencies in the fictional worlds of Doctor Who. The following four chapters are all to a greater or lesser degree structured by or around ideological analysis: I examine attitudes in the texts to class, otherness and ‘evil’, heroic masculinity, and gender relations between the Doctor and his fellow travellers. Chapter Six is concerned with defining aesthetic elements which unite the constituent parts of the unruly Doctor Who phenomenon, and Chapter Seven with the ethical potential of the texts. To some extent the variety of media encompassed in this study has inevitably structured aspects of my analysis. Audio dramas, and to a much greater extent novels, are ‘inward’ rather than ‘spectacular.’ One of my arguments throughout the book is that spectacle plays a crucial role in defining Doctor Who’s evocative and discursive scope on television. It is correspondingly important to acknowledge the ways in which key elements in the television texts help or hinder migration to other media. For example, sounds are at least as important as images in evoking plausibly alien or futuristic environments and entities. Doctor Who dramas constructed for audio alone can therefore carry a surprising amount of the evocative force of the television text, not least in their portrayal of alien creatures such as the Daleks, which might superficially seem to rely on visual presence for their impact. By contrast, Doctor Who on television always relies so heavily on the performance style and energy of its lead actor that the original novels invariably have to compensate, one way or another, for the absence of this element. Conversely the\n\nBritton_Intro.indd 5\n\n2/28/2011 3:24:36 AM\n\n6\n\nTARDISbound\n\nnovels, with their potential for laying bare characters’ thought processes, and to a great extent also the dialogue-heavy audio dramas, encourage a more ruminative approach than the generally fastpaced, thrill-oriented television narratives. Yet while I reflect as appropriate on the discrepancies between the media of Doctor Who at various points in this volume, there is no attempt at consistency or parity in the book’s handling of different textual manifestations. Apart from the sixth chapter none deals comprehensively with Doctor Who’s various media universes, and some are heavily skewed one way or another. Chapters One and Four focus more on the two television series than the other texts, while Three and Five both focus principally on the BBC novels and Big Finish audios. Chapter Seven addresses texts which seem to me representative of patterns in the whole vast narrative rather than within individual media. Relations to past academic and popular criticism also vary, especially in chapters structured around ideological issues which have already figured prominently in critical appraisal of Doctor Who. Thus Chapter Two is meant as a challenge to earlier scholarly discussions of class in Doctor Who and especially earlier academic treatment of the Doctor’s notional class identity. Chapter Three is in part a rebuttal of claims that Doctor Who is in some straightforwardly demonstrable way a ‘text of its time.’ And Chapter Four, which concerns the Doctor’s masculinity, questions oft-rehearsed journalistic and fan claims about the extent of the character’s divergence from other male heroes in popular adventure fiction. As noted, the last two chapters are concerned with evaluating the texts’ aesthetic and ethical merits. The very idea of such evaluation has traditionally been at best problematic, at worst taboo, in the field of cultural studies, under whose broad interdisciplinary umbrella this book belongs. Although I discuss this matter in greater detail in the chapters in question, the issue is worth raising here because it leads me to another preliminary caveat. Although I understand the historical reasons for scholars’ queasiness about expressing faith in any given articulation of popular culture, I have approached my subject with the belief that it is inherently worth examining. I would stop short of echoing Kim Newman’s claim that Doctor Who is a ‘masterpiece’,5 but I do not attempt to disguise my enthusiasm for it any more than I hide my distaste and\n\nBritton_Intro.indd 6\n\n2/28/2011 3:24:36 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\ndisappointment over certain aspects of the texts. With all the ideological problems and stylistic weaknesses that can be identified in Doctor Who, I ultimately argue that it has artistic value in that some, at least, of its texts can reward repeated, varied and nuanced reading. By the same token I argue that Doctor Who has ethical value by virtue of the way that it can stimulate imaginative engagement with vast and deep forms of otherness. Although my theoretical commitments are strong, I hope that my book wears its academic mantle relatively lightly. I have not ‘dumbed down’ complex ideas in this book, but I have tried to avoid burdening the text with name-dropping or unnecessarily opaque writing. While I think James Chapman sets up a false dichotomy when he claims that ‘popular culture can be taken seriously without recourse to the impenetrable critical language of high theory’,6 some of the scholarly practices which he implicitly dismisses do rather invite reproach. The tendency to use critical theory as a kind of academic ‘ready reckoner’ seems at last to be on the wane; its elimination should be actively sought. I have tried to use the names of particular intellectuals and the buzzwords of critical theory only where absolutely necessary and not as a convenience or crutch. Above all, I have eschewed the formulation, ‘what so-and-so calls x’ (e.g. ‘what Hills calls “endlessly deferred narrative” ’), which is all too often used without qualification as though it exempted the writer from trying to explain directly and plainly what so-and-so actually meant. This formula is not just hollow; it is also elitist by default, and incidentally does a disservice to the ‘authority’ being invoked.7 If someone’s ideas are worth quoting, they are also worth clarifying. My preference for elucidation over citation has also made me relatively sparing in my use of notes and references. Wherever there is real dependence on or dialogue with another, I felt it best to engage the source text as fully as possible in the body of my own. Endnotes seem to me useful and appropriate only insofar as they serve as a courtesy to the reader and the mark of a real debt to a predecessor; I see no good reason to tax readers’ patience with an endless succession of superscript numerals. Nor, frankly, do I wish to endorse the position, still all too prevalent in the European and American academy, which measures a study’s credentials by the author’s conspicuous consumption of (or at least lip-service\n\nBritton_Intro.indd 7\n\n2/28/2011 3:24:36 AM\n\n8\n\nTARDISbound\n\nto) other work in the field, and obeisance to supposedly overarching, ‘seminal’ texts. Such a system allows for far too many power abuses. Let me conclude with a few notes on some of the key conventions and some of the deliberate biases and exclusions which readers will encounter in this study:\n\nBritton_Intro.indd 8\n\n•\n\nThis book assumes some prior familiarity with Doctor Who. Although in most crucial cases I have glossed references to diegetic characters, events, peoples and worlds, and allusions to the names of those involved in the production of Doctor Who, this is not uniformly the case.\n\n•\n\nReaders will notice that I have mentioned certain stories, conceits and characters repeatedly from chapter to chapter, and those who are most familiar with Doctor Who in aggregate may see this as unreasonably exclusive. Yet with hundreds of texts in different media to represent, a certain measure of reiteration seemed desirable to ensure that my arguments are not dissipated in a mass of detail, or readers’ patience taxed by too cumbersome a range of data. For the same reason, I have not addressed any of Doctor Who’s many spin-offs (e.g. The Sarah Jane Adventures, BBC, 2007–; Torchwood, BBC, 2006–), except in passing references.\n\n•\n\nStudents looking for information on Doctor Who’s various authors and producers or details of audience reception will be disappointed. For recommended studies of Doctor Who’s production history and chronological analysis of its unfolding texts, see the note on further reading at the head of the Bibliography.\n\n•\n\nGiven the still-problematic status of fans and ‘fan knowledge’ in relation to academia,8 I want to be very clear that my use of the word ‘fan’, alone or in such terms as ‘fan producer’, should be understood as neutrally descriptive. I have frequently found it useful to distinguish between texts produced primarily for fans from texts aimed at a broader audience, but no hierarchical distinction is implied.\n\n•\n\nAll Doctor Who’s constituent texts are cited within my study with their names in inverted commas; italics are reserved for the texts’ overall title, Doctor Who. Thus the usual practice of italicizing the titles of novels is not adopted here: for the sake of parity, the various BBC and Virgin books are treated in the same way as serials/episodes from the television and audio series.\n\n•\n\nNB: The following abbreviations, mostly derived from fan critical convention, are used throughout:\n\n2/28/2011 3:24:37 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ni.\n\nI refer to the original run of Doctor Who on television (BBC, 1963–1989) as the classic series, and to the revival (2005–) as the new series.\n\nii.\n\nNAs = Doctor Who: The New Adventures (Virgin Publishing, 1991–1997) – novels concerning the Seventh Doctor (and in one case, the Eighth).

I shall argue here and in later chapters that ongoing elements in Doctor Who have been significantly recoded in texts produced since the demise of the classic series in 1989. This is true especially of the various series of novels produced between 1991 and the television revival in 2005. I do not mean to suggest that there is an absolute fissure between the classic series and later texts, or that Doctor Who cannot be theorized as a narrative whole. Yet it seems to me that what makes the different textual universes of Doctor Who interesting to study in tandem is the fact that the narrative has accommodated so many alterations in ideology and taste without recourse to such devices as Star Trek’s introduction\n\nBritton_Ch01.indd 10\n\n2/28/2011 3:19:38 AM\n\nTHE VERY FABRIC OF TIME-AND-SPACE\n\n11\n\nof ‘next generation’ and ‘prequel’ series, and without any absolute rupture in consistency at a motivic level. It is particularly worth emphasizing that the apparently radical change in tone between the old and new television series seems much less dramatic if we take into account Doctor Who’s textual metamorphoses during the sixteen-year period between the two television series now often rather misleadingly called the hiatus. Any totalizing analysis of Doctor Who presents special problems: attempts to lump together its media-crossing constellation of texts are as fraught with difficulty as attempts to divide its history meaningfully into phases. To a greater extent than other transmedia fiction such as Buffy, the Vampire Slayer (WB, 1997–2001; UPN, 2001–2003) Star Wars (George Lucas, 1977) or even Star Trek (NBC, 1966–1969), Doctor Who is an unwieldy skein of texts, partly by virtue of the fact that it has endured in one form or another almost continuously for forty years, but more particularly because there is no clear hierarchy within its various media manifestations. Had the BBC ever pronounced on which Doctor Who texts are ‘official’ and which are not, as Paramount and Lucasfilm have respectively done with Star Trek and Star Wars,10 the current study might in a sense have been a good deal less interesting to write. The lack of any such ruling means that both the novels and the audios have at various stages been understood as the official continuation of the classic series of Doctor Who, even if they are now all supposedly trumped by the new series. This has fundamentally defined what is at stake in Doctor Who storytelling in these licensed media and constrained the kinds of stories told, at least until Big Finish began issuing ‘What if ... ?’ (or ‘alternate-universe’) audio dramas under the collective title Doctor Who Unbound (which are clearly signalled as non-canonical by the choice of lead actors not previously associated with the role of the Doctor). Chronological analysis of the Doctor Who narrative is not particularly useful unless conditions of production and reception are the main focus as, ultimately, in studies such as Chapman’s, as well as factual books written by fan authors such as Howe, Stammers and Walker.11 It is true that changes of tone and narrative thrust in the television manifestation of Doctor Who have often accompanied changes in production personnel, which in turn often coincide with a change of lead actor (as has recently occurred again with Russell T. Davies\n\nBritton_Ch01.indd 11\n\n2/28/2011 3:19:39 AM\n\n12\n\nTARDISbound\n\nand David Tennant yielding to Steven Moffat and Matt Smith). It is inherently problematic to imply that the Doctor Who narrative is defined by the imprints of its various transient stars or producers. Moreover, any analysis based around a ‘line-of-succession’ model clearly cannot accommodate the current multiplicity of textual universes, with six actors simultaneously playing the Doctor in licensed productions and original tie-in novels regularly being published. For present purposes, it is more useful to theorize Doctor Who’s narrative organization in terms of the recently developed critical model of the ‘vast narrative’, articulated in Pat Harrigan and Noah Wardrip-Fruin’s Third Person: Authoring and Exploring Vast Narratives.12 This can be usefully supplemented with aspects of Matt Hills’s model of the ‘cult text’ from his Fan Cultures.13 As I argue below, both approaches accommodate the essential multi-vocality of Doctor Who texts (which obtains even in the early 2010s, at a moment of massively focused branding), and both provide a context for understanding the transformations of narrative trajectory and ethos which Doctor Who has undergone in the last twenty years.\n\nStructure and Format By way of a preamble it seems useful to sketch some of the stable structural characteristics of Doctor Who. I use the term structure to refer to two distinct but related things: on the one hand, the basic kinds of protagonist and plot functions in the Doctor Who narratives; on the other, the vehicle of storytelling itself. This latter, the ‘outward’ form as opposed to internal organization of narrative, seems to me peculiarly significant in Doctor Who’s case. One of the classic series’ chief formal characteristics – its episodic, ‘cliff-hanger’ narratives – has grown from a programming convention into an aesthetically meaningful element in its own right. If one of the consistent pleasures of Doctor Who has been that each plot is structured around a series of predictable moves and oppositions, then another has clearly been the episodic format itself. As regards Doctor Who’s internal narrative patterns, there are a number of clear baseline textual conventions and functions. Doctor Who is perhaps best characterized as melodrama, but closer still is its affinity with fairy tale, for all the narrative’s trappings of scientific\n\nBritton_Ch01.indd 12\n\n2/28/2011 3:19:39 AM\n\nTHE VERY FABRIC OF TIME-AND-SPACE\n\n13\n\nrationalism and technology. The Doctor, an alien traveller with phenomenal mental acuity, explores the universe and travels backwards and forwards in time in his TARDIS. Outwardly, this appears to be a police lock-up box: inwardly it is impossibly spacious with an unspecified number of chambers. As in fairy tale and melodrama, there has typically been little room for moral ambiguity in Doctor Who. Everywhere we see him go, the Doctor encounters evil which is, or comes during the course of the adventure to be, in ascendancy. The Doctor invariably overcomes evildoers, whose vice generally takes one (or more) of four forms: oppressive power mongering, insane egotism, disdain for the value of life, or murderous hatred of the unlike. The Doctor models the reverse values: he travels with companions of whom he is for the most part paternally protective, and collectively he and they embody voluntary cooperation and liberty of thought and action. Yet the Doctor has seldom been a straightforward hero. He has often exhibited characteristics of the trickster, for he generally relies on wiliness and rhetorical skills more than martial prowess or physical force, and his character has frequently been tinged with antiheroism.14 Conversely – at least in the original television series – his opponents are usually more clear-cut in their villainy. The majority of the Doctor’s enemies are non-human: like the heroes of myth and fairy tale, the Doctor faces evil in overtly monstrous forms. The aim of these creatures is generally the assimilation, conquest or eradication of others. When he is not pitted against inhuman alien races, the Doctor may face destructive individuals who are human, or at least, like the hero himself, appear so. These lone villains always embody unchecked egotism or greed in one way or another. As such, they directly invert one of the Doctor’s key heroic (as opposed to tricksteresque) traits: his selflessness. Villains seek aggrandizement and manipulate or destroy those around them to further their interests or ambitions. The Doctor, by contrast, regularly shows himself willing to endanger his own life in the cause of justice and eschews accolades or rewards for his victories. The Doctor’s companions, mostly young and female, show a relative naivety which contrasts with his experience (and often also relative ignorance which contrasts with his wisdom). Apart from playing the role of pupil or sounding board, their main function within the narrative is to get divided from the Doctor at least once\n\nBritton_Ch01.indd 13\n\n2/28/2011 3:19:39 AM\n\n14\n\nTARDISbound\n\nin almost every adventure. This invariably leads them into peril at the hands of the chief villain or some secondary menace. For companions, and indeed for the Doctor himself, separation from the TARDIS, incarceration, rescue or escape, and mortal jeopardy are mainstays of every plot. In the original television series, the most desperate situations would manifest predictably at the end of each twenty-five minute episode. Doctor Who began as a curious amalgam of series and serial (the latter term here understood as a multi-episode adventure of predefined length, as opposed to an open-ended, multi-stranded narrative like a soap opera).15 For its first three years on air, every episode was individually titled and ended with a cliffhanger. This slightly obscured the fact that each season was subdivided into eight to ten individual serials, the final cliffhanger of one serial being in effect a teaser for the next. From 1966, these multi-part adventures were given umbrella titles, and the individual episode names abandoned. Although the number and length of serials within each season decreased in 1970 and again in 1986, the serial-within-a-series format held until production ceased in 1989. It became such a defining feature of Doctor Who that the home videos released in the 1980s as edited and abridged feature-length presentations were quickly reissued with each episode’s opening and closing credits intact. The inauguration of the NAs in 1992 saw some measure of shift away from the cliffhanger, crisis-and-resolution format, in part reflecting the fact that these were avowedly ‘stories too broad and too deep for the small screen.’16 Exploiting the possibilities of the novel as a form, some of the NAs and EDAs are told in boldly nonlinear ways, Ben Aaronovitch’s ‘Transit’ (1992) and Paul Magrs’ ‘The Blue Angel’ (2000) being among the most notable in the respective series. Yet the appeal of the Doctor Who serial as a form proved tenacious. From their inception in 1999 to the present, the vast majority of the Big Finish Doctor Who audio dramas have been presented as four-part serials, with cliff-hangers and a truncated version of the television show’s evocative theme music framing each instalment. The novels, too, were sometimes connected together in what was, in effect, a grand-scale serial. The NAs, for example, began with four books which pitted the Doctor against a single adversary: the quartet of novels is in effect a protracted but unified quest, extending a narrative form used in Doctor Who as early as its first televised\n\nBritton_Ch01.indd 14\n\n2/28/2011 3:19:40 AM\n\nTHE VERY FABRIC OF TIME-AND-SPACE\n\n15\n\nseason in ‘The Keys of Marinus’ (1964). The serial format has even made the odd cameo appearance in individual novels. For instance, ‘Festival of Death’ (2002), a PDA by Jonathan Morris, is cast as one of the six-part adventures generally used as season closers in the late 1970s, the period from which this ‘missing’ story notionally hails. Every fourth of the eighteen chapters marks the beginning of a new ‘episode’, and even includes a recapitulation of the previous instalment’s last moments; this was a convention used throughout the classic series, which Big Finish also frequently mimics. Morris’s pastiche of the cliffhanger serial is the kind of motif which can only be appreciated by the knowledgeable fan. Unsurprisingly enough, all such nostalgic homage to the original format occurs in Doctor Who texts produced primarily by and for existent fans: the BBC books, among whose editors is long-time fan writer Justin Richards, and the Big Finish audios, which have been produced by two erstwhile fans, the writer Gary Russell and the writer, director and actor Nicholas Briggs. Big Finish has established itself as the chief custodian of format continuity, turning this into a taxonomic as well as an expressive device. For example, in 1985 the BBC briefly experimented with fifty-minute instead of twentyfive-minute episodes for Doctor Who, and Big Finish replicates this for serials which ‘belong’ in that year; likewise, entries in the Big Finish series which ‘follow’ the 1986 season use the new arrangement of the Doctor Who theme tune introduced in that year, and so on. More strikingly, Big Finish has used variation of format to create a transition where none existed on television. Early dramas featuring the Eighth Doctor are in the traditional four- or six-part structure. After the 2005 television revival featuring the Ninth Doctor, which mostly comprised the forty-five-minute stand-alone episodes now standard for television series, a season of Eighth Doctor audio plays – featuring an avowedly older, more tetchy version of the character – was cast in the new format. This structural shift, together with changes of tone, imaginatively serves, among other things, to stitch together the ‘classic’ and ‘new’ Doctor Who. If at one level this is trivia, at another it is an important index of the way in which fans have become managers of the Doctor Who legacy, an issue on which I shall focus heavily in Chapter Three. This is no small consideration since these fan professionals are also Doctor Who’s most copious licensed producers. Big Finish had released\n\nBritton_Ch01.indd 15\n\n2/28/2011 3:19:40 AM\n\n16\n\nTARDISbound\n\naround a hundred and fifty Doctor Who audio adventures in different ranges by July 2009, the tenth anniversary of the monthly series’ inception. The original BBC Books series (EDAs and PDAs) ran to almost the same number of releases in the course of eight years (1997–2005), and the two Virgin lines (NAs and MAs) to nearly a hundred in six (1991–1997). In short, Doctor Who’s adventures in print and audio media (not including comic strips and graphic novels or short story collections) outnumber the television episodes produced to date by very nearly two to one. Although none of these licensed texts reaches audiences in anything like the same numbers as the television series, there can be no doubt that fan professionals have come to exert a predominant influence on the character and morphology of Doctor Who, even without taking into account their seminal role in shaping the new television series.17\n\nManaging the ‘Vast Narrative’: Deferral and Hyperdiegesis Unsurprisingly, given its endurance and the enormous complexity of its diegetic universe, Doctor Who is one of the textual sets most prominently discussed in Harrigan and Wardrip-Fruin’s collection of essays on the ‘vast narrative.’ As a ‘multi-authored cross-media phenomenon’ Doctor Who falls squarely within their (deliberately loose-knit) conceptual framework, which is designed to incorporate a range of recent fictions, textual forms and media interactions.18 Yet they rightly qualify Doctor Who’s status as vast narrative by noting that its universe is ‘fractured and contradictory’ in ways that other narrative worlds, especially those of more recent television series such as The Sopranos (HBO, 1999–2007) and Buffy, the Vampire Slayer are not. The latter, as Harrigan and Wardrip-Fruin write, ‘maintain an ongoing structure, with narrative consistency and thematic coherence, throughout large numbers of episodes and sometimes seasons.’19 In comparison, Doctor Who has historically been, and to a great extent remains, more akin to comic and sitcom narratives in which ‘characters often find themselves each week placed back in a default situation little changed from the series’ outset.’20 However, in another way Doctor Who also thrives more than many series on the studied tension between change and continuity, and\n\nBritton_Ch01.indd 16\n\n2/28/2011 3:19:41 AM\n\nTHE VERY FABRIC OF TIME-AND-SPACE\n\n17\n\ntrue to a now-venerable cliché it has shown a prodigious capacity for repeated self-transformation. Attempts to refresh the narrative have been regular and sometimes radical, from the time of the Doctor’s first on-screen physical ‘regeneration’ onwards. Hills has therefore suggested in his analysis of cult texts that Doctor Who represents a prime example of the endlessly deferred narrative. As the term implies, this storytelling form, proper to many television series, is as potentially limitless as soap opera; but Hills argues that unlike soap opera, with its diffuse serial structure, the endlessly deferred narrative is focused on a central theme or character which is inherently mysterious.21 Hills suggests that Doctor Who’s title is in effect a question addressed throughout the texts’ history in various ways and that the central character is ‘offered up as a mystery, or as “unfinished/ unknown.” ’22 This claim is essentially justified, but as I shall argue in the next section, the nature, extent and above all the tenor of Doctor Who’s narrative deferral has altered, especially since the late 1980s. Another key characteristic of the cult text, according to Hills, is the hyperdiegesis. This is the intricate universe of the text, a selfcontained world with its own laws and history, whose scale and complexity is hinted at but never fully explored. This hyperdiegesis serves as a conceptual anchor, a consistently implied, coherent framework for events, inspiring the audience’s or reader’s trust and ongoing interest in the narrative.23 Doctor Who certainly developed its own hyperdiegesis, but (as noted by Harrigan and WardripFruin) this has proven to be increasingly unstable. In spite of going through periods of obsessive reference to its own past, Doctor Who has much more often breached its own internal continuity. This is partly due to its sheer length of duration and proliferation, partly to the fact that its narrative has always been open and haphazard in nature. Yet, as I shall argue, the ‘failure’ of its hyperdiegesis also points to one of Doctor Who’s idiosyncratic strengths: its capacity for the rich and complex accretion of ideas in what amounts to a narrative palimpsest.\n\nModes of Permutation and Deferral If the classic series of Doctor Who proved in the long run to be a narrative of endless deferral, it does not follow that the closure it\n\nBritton_Ch01.indd 17\n\n2/28/2011 3:19:41 AM\n\n18\n\nTARDISbound\n\nresisted was always the same, or even that the principle of deferral always applied with equal force. Doctor Who was never a series like The Prisoner (ITC, 1967–1968) or The Fugitive (ABC, 1963–1967), in which key questions were established at the outset, and ongoing delay in their resolution was the ostensible basis for the series’ continuation. In other words, it would be a mistake to overstate the extent to which Doctor Who was originally organized around the narrative question implied by the programme’s title.24 True, little was originally disclosed about the Doctor, except that he came from another world and apparently another time, but his role as a space- and time-travelling alien was much more a basis for the action than the explicit or even tacit focus of the narrative. If one central question has arisen to sustain Doctor Who as a narrative of endless deferral, it is less a teleological than an ontological one. There has never been any suggestion of a final goal for the narrative, any hint that the Doctor would voluntarily change his itinerant lifestyle or fulfil some ultimate destiny. Indeed, there is no real sense in which he is a mortal. Four years into the series’ run, the Doctor claimed in ‘The War Games’ (1969) that his people could ‘live forever, barring accidents.’ Although this assertion was modified a few years later in ‘The Deadly Assassin’ (1976) with the disclosure that a Time Lord is able to regenerate only twelve times, this hardly set a tangible limit to the Doctor’s wanderings, especially given that the very same serial demonstrated that a Time Lord could cheat ultimate demise. On the other hand, the texts of Doctor Who have repeatedly and increasingly made the character of the Doctor mysterious in terms of behaviour and motivation. His unpredictability has been renewed at regular intervals by his changes of bodily form, for the introduction of each new performer in the title role inevitably rendered the character strange again. Indeed, in one way the Doctor’s first regeneration placed the principle of endless deferral squarely at the centre of Doctor Who’s narrative, for it made him inexhaustibly unknowable. Beyond this, the last seasons of the classic series introduced the idea that the Doctor was more than ‘just another Time Lord,’ and the implication that in some prior life he had been one of the co-founders of his civilization was teasingly extended throughout the NAs, coming to fruition in the series’ culminating entry, ‘Lungbarrow’ (1997).\n\nBritton_Ch01.indd 18\n\n2/28/2011 3:19:41 AM\n\nTHE VERY FABRIC OF TIME-AND-SPACE\n\n19\n\nYet ultimately more significant than hints of an heroic origin for the Doctor, or even his changes of form, has been the ever-increasing emphasis on his unfathomable thinking and capricious behaviour, his sometimes-shocking attitude to life and death, his secrecy and deviousness, his emotional unavailability and isolation. Since the mid-1980s, the texts of Doctor Who have emphatically presented the Doctor as alien, a character largely incapable of sustaining intimate bonds with others or operating consistently within a human range of emotion. In the NAs and EDAs, and in the audio plays of the present decade, the tension between the Doctor’s humane tendencies and his essentially alien emotional life has provided much of the ongoing interest; it also formed the dramatic mainstay of the new series on television for the first four years of its run. This interplay of the human and inhuman within the Doctor’s persona(e) was certainly not an invention of the 1980s, but it is worth stressing that the motif was far from a constant in the classic series. Titanic egocentricity and deviousness were the Doctor’s strongest attributes for the first dozen or so episodes of the classic series – he thought nothing of placing his companions’ lives in jeopardy to satisfy his own whims – but these tendencies were quickly toned down. Throughout the 1960s and until the mid-1970s he became an increasingly avuncular figure, and the first serious and sustained shift back towards anti-heroism was only made with the Fourth Doctor, Tom Baker. In 1975 Baker and his producer, Philip Hinchcliffe, agreed that the Doctor should exhibit more ‘Olympian detachment.’25 In practice this often meant seemingly callous and unfeeling behaviour, laced with equally Olympian flashes of childishness. The character’s anti-heroism and emphasis on his frightening potential was eventually taken to new heights with the Sixth Doctor, played by Colin Baker. Quite apart from the fact that this Doctor was frequently arrogant, impatient and insensitive, the ‘dark’ side of his character was quite literally embodied in the Valeyard, an enemy who proved to be the Doctor’s own negative traits distilled into independent, corporeal form (‘Trial of a Time Lord’, 1986). In retrospect, the conceit of pitting the Sixth Doctor against the embodiment of his own frailties seems almost like a morality-play prologue to the long career of the Seventh Doctor on screen and in print. By Sylvester McCoy’s third season in the role, the Seventh Doctor was\n\nBritton_Ch01.indd 19\n\n2/28/2011 3:19:41 AM\n\n20\n\nTARDISbound\n\nexhibiting an impish cunning and a willingness to manipulate those around him which exceeded anything seen before in the series.26 In the NAs he became yet more crafty, aloof and evasive, and his companions’ trust in him grew correspondingly fragile. The interest of this situation – on which a narrative of endless deferral was built – was that the Doctor expressed fear of loneliness and yearning for companionship, while simultaneously acting in ways which were guaranteed to alarm and alienate his friends.27 For the first time in Doctor Who’s history, companions routinely questioned his (and their own) motivation for travelling in the TARDIS; recriminations, unease and estrangements amongst the crew became commonplace. The ongoing exploration of the Doctor’s character contradictions and his edgy or angst-ridden relationships with his fellow travellers has proven inexhaustibly fruitful for Doctor Who writers over the last fifteen years in a way that the more epic elements of deferred narrative (such as questions about the Doctor’s true role in Time Lord history) have not. For all that the NAs, EDAs and the new series are discrete and even contradictory at the level of narrative premise and thrust, preoccupation with the Doctor’s mixture of superhuman heroism and emotional elusiveness has been a constant in all of them. I shall turn to some of the instances of interpersonal conflict or tension in recent texts of Doctor Who later in this book (especially in Chapters Three, Five and Seven). For present purposes it is enough to note that since 1989 Doctor Who texts have focused on problems of character barely ever touched upon in the classic series’ first quarter century. This is not the place to speculate on the reasons for the abrupt shift made around 1989 from an almost exclusively plot-driven to a more character-oriented narrative of deferral in Doctor Who. Suffice it to say that if the rapidity of the change was in one way startling, the fact of the change is not so surprising, at least if we compare Doctor Who with some of its generic cousins during the same period. Already by the end of the 1980s, Star Trek: The Next Generation was addressing personal relationships within the context of an epic space-travel saga, and its first two spin-offs in the 1990s, Deep Space Nine and Voyager, took this tendency further (CBS: 1987–1994; CBS, 1993–1999; CBS 1995–2001). By the time Doctor Who was revived on television in 2005, series such as The\n\nBritton_Ch01.indd 20\n\n2/28/2011 3:19:42 AM\n\nTHE VERY FABRIC OF TIME-AND-SPACE\n\n21\n\nX-Files (Fox, 1993–2002), Buffy, the Vampire Slayer and Alias (ABC, 2001–2006) had made the ingredient of emotional resonance a sine qua non for genre fiction. Set pieces and special effects aside, much of the broad appeal of these narratives surely lay in their quasi-soapopera treatment of a core group of characters: dilemmas of professional ethics, sexual relationships or unresolved sexual tension, family dynamics, illness and loss, and so on. From this perspective, Doctor Who has simply demonstrated its famous adaptability: it has been successfully adjusted to the prevalent tastes of genre producers and consumers for whom some sort of dramatic development or exploration of character – however slight or trite – is now apparently de rigueur in fantasy narratives.\n\nContinuity, ‘Canonicity’ and Palimpsest Endlessly deferred narrative, though peculiarly accommodating to the enthusiasms of fans, is a property of many series or serials, whether or not they become cult texts. The device of endless deferral is calculated to secure audience loyalty without necessarily requiring intense engagement. In other words, it is quite possible to be actively curious about the way that the Doctor’s relationship with companions such as Rose Tyler or Sam Jones may turn out, or eagerly anticipate his next rematch with the Daleks, without sharing in the kind of affective play which characterizes fan interaction with the cult text. In Doctor Who’s case, at least, the same cannot be said of hyperdiegesis: the complex, self-suspending universe of a cult text, of which we only ever see portions in the narrative. The maintenance, ordering and enhancement of the Doctor Who hyperdiegesis have almost entirely been the work of fans. Nearly all sustained fictional exploration of the Whoniverse belongs to the phase of the texts’ history in which audience and authors were arguably most homogeneous, which is to say the lifespan of the NAs and MAs. The NAs became increasingly interdependent as the series progressed, but they also alluded to an array of details from the established history of the worlds of Doctor Who on television, sometimes picking up on the most fleeting of references or obscure of characters.28 The MAs by definition filled in some of the blanks and could even be\n\nBritton_Ch01.indd 21\n\n2/28/2011 3:19:42 AM\n\n22\n\nTARDISbound\n\ndesigned specifically to paper over cracks in the classic series narrative.29 It was Lance Parkin, an author in both ranges and longterm fan commentator, who undertook the grandest encyclopaedic survey of Doctor Who’s fictional cosmos. A History of the Universe is a tour de force, its subject matter approached by Parkin with all the clinical precision and measured scepticism of a good philologist or mythographer.30 Subsequent editions of Parkin’s book have been entitled simply Ahistory, perhaps intentionally reflecting that Doctor Who is ahistorical in rather more than its narrative premise. In his introduction, Parkin notes baldly that the writers of various Doctor Who texts ‘shamelessly threw out the show’s established history in the name of a good story’, and his retroactive attempt to impose order was therefore fraught with obstacles.31 Some of the strands in Doctor Who’s skein of texts have proven too tangled or frayed to allow seamless repair or rectification, even (and sometimes especially) when a given story was conceived in part to clarify or consolidate the narrative’s internal historical framework. All this ultimately reflects the fact that until around 1980 continuity was barely a consideration for the authors of Doctor Who. In Lawrence Miles and Tat Wood’s neat phrase, ‘running themes rather than hard facts held the series together.’32 Nor has blithe inattentiveness to internal continuity really ever gone away, for all the historicizing efforts of fans and some cosmetic appearance to the contrary within the narrative itself: uncertainties and contradictions, even over matters as apparently easy to track as the Doctor’s age, persist even in the new series.33 Overall then, Doctor Who’s hyperdiegetic framework is at best rickety. With its time-travel premise, Doctor Who was not conceived with an eye to internal coherence; there was no need for it to be. Adherence to documented facts of Earth history aside, chronology and consistency in the Doctor Who texts only become a potential issue when recurrent characters and environments were involved, or when ongoing scenarios were devised. For some years, almost the only returning characters in the classic series were monsters, and as they tended to be eliminated at their first encounter with the Doctor, explanations inevitably had to be proffered for any reappearance. A prime example is the case of the Cybermen, in which the problem was handled easily enough and in a manner\n\nBritton_Ch01.indd 22\n\n2/28/2011 3:19:43 AM\n\nTHE VERY FABRIC OF TIME-AND-SPACE\n\n23\n\nwhich was to become characteristic of Doctor Who: the accretion of new data which counterpoints or ‘thickens’ the old. The Cybermen were first introduced in ‘The Tenth Planet’ (1966) as the prosthetically augmented denizens of Earth’s wandering twin planet, Mondas. They and their world were utterly destroyed at the end of the serial, foiled in an attempt to leech power from Earth. When the Cybermen reappeared in ‘The Moonbase’ less than a year later, looking rather different, the perfectly reasonable explanation was that this particular troop came from another planet which they had colonized: Telos. Comparable let-outs can be used to resolve many later contradictions in Cyber history. The principle of retroactively shaping continuity around newly stated ‘facts’ is by no means peculiar to Doctor Who; in fact, one might argue that it is another common (if not quite leading) characteristic of cult texts. What is striking about Doctor Who is the extent to which the process of defining the texts’ internal universe is palimpsestic. In other words, key elements have not always simply been brought into alignment with existing ‘truths’, or vice versa; some of them have effectively overwritten earlier histories, albeit leaving the original elements partially visible. The most notable example of this is provided by ‘facts’ concerning the Doctor’s people, the Time Lords of Gallifrey. In ‘The Three Doctors’ (1973), a quasimythic figure called Omega was introduced as the originator of Time Lord technology. A few years later, in ‘The Deadly Assassin’ (1976), the previously unmentioned engineer and architect Rassilon was credited as the author of Gallifrey’s time-travel capability, and Omega apparently forgotten. Rassilon immediately and definitively eclipsed Omega, emerging as the linchpin figure of Gallifreyan history. In nearly every subsequent script or novel referring to Time Lord culture and lore, Rassilon is designated with tedious predictability as the proprietor of anything powerful, mysterious, venerable or merely first-rate in Gallifreyan culture, from the Black Scrolls of Rassilon to ‘Rassilon’s Red’, apparently a favourite wine in taverns beneath the Time Lord citadel.34 Although Omega is not only mentioned but also returns in later Doctor Who texts, he always stands in the shadow of Rassilon. The ritual allusion to Rassilon palimpsests the Doctor Who narrative in another way: the motif both depends on and partially hides its own basis. In ‘The Deadly Assassin’ the Doctor had to rely on a\n\nBritton_Ch01.indd 23\n\n2/28/2011 3:19:43 AM\n\n24\n\nTARDISbound\n\nTime Lord archivist to tell him about Rassilon’s historical achievements. Yet in every subsequent story the Time Lords at large and the Doctor in particular are thoroughly conversant with stories of Rassilon and his powers. Once such an adjustment had been made to the mythos of Gallifrey, it was easy enough to layer on top of that, selectively re-inscribing or occluding elements each time. Thus, by the end of the classic series hints are being made concerning the Other, a third co-founder with Rassilon and Omega of modern Gallifreyan civilization, who is eventually revealed in the NAs to have been the Doctor in an earlier existence. Yet in the novel series that followed, the EDAs and PDAs, as eventually in the television revival, the Other is largely forgotten and the idea of his being in some sense identical with the Doctor is entirely jettisoned. From the time of the NAs onwards, Doctor Who texts began to acknowledge their own internal confusion, and authors started to use this to imaginative ends, a trend that fittingly enough reached its apogee in the final EDA, Lance Parkin’s ‘The Gallifrey Chronicles’ (2005). One of the most striking examples is ‘Unnatural History’ (1999), in which the principal villain is Griffin, a collector of curious creatures (the ‘unnaturalist’ hinted at in the title) who seeks to acquire the Doctor as a specimen. Yet Griffin regards the Doctor as a problematic because of the Time Lord’s paradoxically tangled personal history; Griffin attempts to iron out the more egregious inconsistencies in order to sustain his taxonomy. The gentle dig at more continuity-obsessed fans is clear. In the same novel the Doctor’s companion Sam reflects on the discontinuities in the Doctor’s TARDIS logs: ‘on one page they’d say he’d done something, the next he hadn’t, the page after that he’d done it a long time ago.’35 Amusingly enough, this is in itself a sly continuity reference, for it directly and deliberately echoes lines uttered in an episode of the classic series (‘The Keeper of Traken’, 1981), in which another companion is consulting the same TARDIS logs. This ludic approach to the potentially stifling issue of ‘canonicity’ typifies one of the stylistic strengths which have emerged in Doctor Who since the demise of the classic series: its capacity to absorb its own narrative properties into the world of the text, to revel in lore without being too circumscribed by ‘law.’ Another clear instance of meta-referential play with narrative is the figure of Iris Wildthyme, a time traveller whose very existence is a teasing critique of both\n\nBritton_Ch01.indd 24\n\n2/28/2011 3:19:44 AM\n\nTHE VERY FABRIC OF TIME-AND-SPACE\n\n25\n\nthe structural and ethical inconsistencies of Doctor Who (and whom I shall discuss at some length in Chapter Seven). Yet such poetic devices are the flipside of another important, if much cruder, narrative conceit in Doctor Who: the use of temporal paradox as the basis for ‘resetting’ the hyperdiegesis. In the recent texts of Doctor Who, this reset function took shape around the conceit of time war, which is a natural emanation of the whole narrative’s premise. According to the logic of the Doctor Who universe, a war between opponents both possessing time-travel capability could selectively alter the ‘true’ history of that universe. The time-war motif originally featured in the EDAs, but it was to take on watershed significance for Doctor Who in the 2005 television revival. Here we learn that Gallifrey has at some unspecified point been destroyed in ‘the Last Great Time War’ in which the Time Lords and the Daleks erased one another from history (more or less). The prominent fan writer Paul Cornell has argued in a blog essay on canonicity in Doctor Who that the Time War ‘puts all historical events [in the earlier Doctor Who narrative] up for grabs.’36 In effect, Cornell suggests that the Time War is the ultimate narrative ‘reset button’, foreclosing any discussion of whether or not there is substantive continuity between the various pre-2005 texts and the revival. By this reckoning, the fact that Cornell adapted one of his own NAs, ‘Human Nature’, for the new television series does not necessarily negate the original novel. Who is to say that the Time War did not erase the Seventh Doctor’s sojourn as a human being in pre-World War One England, allowing the Tenth Doctor to have a near-replicate experience? In the same way, the fact that in ‘School Reunion’ (2006), the Doctor’s former companion Sarah Jane Smith claims she has not met him since their parting in ‘The Hand of Fear’ (1976) need not belie her encounters with the Seventh and Eighth Doctors in the BBC novels ‘Bullet Time’ (2001) and ‘Interference’ (1999); those encounters may simply have been cancelled out by the war. In summary, Cornell contends that Doctor Who was always ‘one big and very complex story that rewrites and contradicts itself’; the only difference since the invention of the Time War is that it now ‘does it with purpose, rather than by accident.’37 For all Cornell’s insistence that the invention of the Time War is Russell T. Davies’s way of not ruling on the canonicity of other and\n\nBritton_Ch01.indd 25\n\n2/28/2011 3:19:44 AM\n\n26\n\nTARDISbound\n\nearlier Doctor Who texts, to accept this ‘non-ruling’ is nevertheless to accept a hierarchy within the texts. Cornell argues that Davies has brought order to the disorderly Doctor Who hyperdiegesis by making its internal contradictions purposive and therefore legitimate. Logically this resolution of chaos only works if Davies’s version of Doctor Who is understood as paramount, as the single, commanding vantage point from which to survey past and parallel textual manifestations. By contrast, Harrigan and Wardrip-Fruin’s metaphor of the vast narrative as ‘fictional quilt’ stresses non-linear and thus non-hierarchical relationships within sprawling, media-crossing texts such as Doctor Who. This model encourages us to understand seemingly illassorted or contradictory elements in the Who narrative as parts of a multifarious whole rather than problems requiring unification. In short, the quilt metaphor can serve to highlight not merely Doctor Who’s famous flexibility of narrative premise but rather its inherent and often productive lack of narrative constraint and coherence.\n\nNavigating the Texts: Buoys, Daymarks and Charts There is yet another way of looking at the problem of narrative unity, or the absence thereof, in Doctor Who. The very idea that even the classic series constitutes a single text is, as Alan McKee has pointed out, something of a fiction in itself.38 The series was the work of many different authorial regimes over twenty-six years, producing often wildly divergent material, and such divergences have multiplied since Doctor Who’s migration to other media. Ultimately, it is safest to argue that the ‘wholeness’ in Doctor Who is maintained not at the level of narrative but through structuring icons such as the Daleks, the TARDIS and above all the Doctor himself. With this in mind, it is worth mentioning another critical category articulated by Matt Hills in Fan Cultures: the cult icon. In Hills’s model this is not strictly a property of the cult text. In fact, for Hills the overriding characteristic of the cult icon – implicitly always a human figure, such as Marilyn Monroe or Elvis Presley – is the fact that it eludes containment within a narrative. The Doctor may be fictitious and by definition bound within a narrative frame, but he\n\nBritton_Ch01.indd 26\n\n2/28/2011 3:19:44 AM\n\nTHE VERY FABRIC OF TIME-AND-SPACE\n\n27\n\nexhibits one of the key properties of the cult icon outlined by Hills, namely, its capacity to move ‘across social-historical frames, being re-mapped and reworked in the process.’39 Perhaps more closely applicable to the Doctor is the paradigm of the popular hero as defined by Tony Bennett and Janet Woollacott in their book Bond and Beyond: a figure which ‘floats between and connects ... texts into related sets.’40 It is the Doctor’s presence which guarantees a narrative as being Doctor Who, however remote that narrative might seem in all other respects from the originary 1963 television text or any other benchmark. Yet inasmuch as the Doctor is a constant, the character has been ‘remapped and reworked’ in ways that go far beyond periodic changes of physical appearance and demeanour: there have been significant shifts in the character’s political significance. This has been especially clear-cut with the advent of the new series. For example, the Doctor’s capacity for sexual attraction, a non-issue until the later 1990s in any of the texts, immediately became a central and ongoing theme in the new. As I discuss in Chapter Four, this had striking consequences for the politics of gender in the texts, reaffirming certain givens even as it seemed to override others. Conversely, some iconic and motivic elements of Doctor Who have been almost wholly undisturbed throughout the narrative’s sea changes and migrations, or at least they have quickly regained their original valence after being upset in some particular moment or medium. This has often led to the texts’ developing ethical blind spots since not all the fixed icons of Doctor Who are as ideologically neutral as, say, the fact that the TARDIS is always larger within than without. As I demonstrate in different ways in Chapters Two and Four, blind acceptance of the Doctor’s unbridled masculine agency and imperialist noblesse oblige in the classic series persisted well into the new, arguably stunting the narrative’s discursive potential. Sustained attempts to probe the Doctor’s patriarchal entitlement are mostly confined to the NAs and EDAs, which is to say, fanoriented texts produced between the two television series. Complicating the Doctor’s authority in the novels went hand in hand with giving his companions unprecedented critical distance from the Doctor, another innovation which has diminished since the termination of the EDAs, as I discuss in Chapter Five. By contrast, the growing tendency to question and mitigate binary distinctions\n\nBritton_Ch01.indd 27\n\n2/28/2011 3:19:45 AM\n\n28\n\nTARDISbound\n\nbetween heroism and villainy may have first been strongly evident in the licensed texts of the hiatus (and was arguably at its most rewarding in those texts), but it has in some measure persisted in the new series. In Chapter Three I address the circumstances which have underwritten more or less permanent changes in the portrayal of such iconic traditional enemies as the Master, but also the limits of these changes in face of the need to satisfy a coalition audience rather than a specialist audience. The recurrent, structuring motifs of Doctor Who are ultimately not just markers of overall textual wholeness on the one hand or of nodal responses to the texts’ changing contexts on the other. The iconic and idiomatic elements in the vast narrative also work cumulatively – in all their repetitions, transformations and lapses – to help define the aesthetic scope of the Doctor Who universes, and the texts’ horizon of ethical possibilities. The Doctor, with his (to date) elevenfold persona, and the TARDIS, with its impossible, portmanteau nature, are apt metaphors for the nature of the Doctor Who narrative as a space of imaginative possibilities, a space within which notions of the ineffable can come into play. As I argue in Chapter Six, Doctor Who has proven itself aesthetically suited to representing grand spectacle in miniature, articulating epic events in synecdoche rather than in full. And as I argue in Chapter Seven, some of the most rewarding Doctor Who texts transmute this capacity to relate the expansive and the intimate into a very particular kind of ethical challenge, asking readers or audiences to reflect on concepts of personal and universal responsibility, setting these in often-disquieting juxtaposition.\n\nBritton_Ch01.indd 28\n\n2/28/2011 3:19:45 AM\n\nII IN A CLASS OF HIS OWN? Doctor Who and the Social Matrix\n\nI\n\nn a line from ‘The Daleks’ Master Plan’ (1965–66), oft quoted in both the celebratory and critical literature of Doctor Who, William Hartnell’s testy and fastidious First Doctor makes a notable statement about his class affiliation. Vexed at being asked whether he is a British citizen, the Doctor describes himself rather as ‘a citizen of the universe, and a gentleman to boot.’ Amusing as it was clearly intended to be, the line probably did not strike contemporary viewers as particularly remarkable. By virtue of the TARDIS’s capacity to materialize anywhere in the cosmos at any time in a given world’s history, the Doctor manifestly had a degree of universal access that very few Earthly citizens enjoy even in their own countries. The first part of the Doctor’s assertion, therefore, was nothing more than a personalized restatement of Doctor Who’s narrative premise. The second part of his claim, which modifies the first, was a verbal articulation of something which must also have seemed self-evident to many viewers. In spite of his eccentric mane of long white hair, the Doctor’s bearing, manners and clipped speech made him easily recognisable as an old-fashioned gentleman or ‘toff’ by thennormative standards in Britain.\n\nBritton_Ch02.indd 29\n\n2/28/2011 3:20:37 AM\n\n30\n\nTARDISbound\n\nThis affirmation of a particular social status for its main protagonist overtly established class relations as a part of the Doctor Who text, even though there was no need to do so: no ostensible need in narrative terms, because by definition an extraterrestrial being exists outside British class structures, and no actual need because in affective terms the Doctor’s ‘gentlemanliness’ was already so strongly articulated that the claim was redundant. This overt, doubly unnecessary avowal of class as a defining aspect of Doctor Who’s main protagonist – and thus by extension a structuring element in the narrative – begs two questions: If the Doctor is a ‘gentleman,’ how does his portrayal as such relate to other elements of class specificity in the texts? Just as importantly, to what extent have the evocation and the significance of class relations changed over the course of the Doctor Who texts’ history? In this chapter, I should like to suggest that the Doctor is best understood not merely as a ‘gentleman’ but more specifically as an aristocratic figure. As I shall argue, recognizing him as such allows us to move beyond a dichotomous model of class dividing society into two groups – upper and lower, the classes and the masses – which are in an implicitly adversarial relationship. This dualistic model does not seem useful in the context of Doctor Who, the classic series of which consistently addressed the ideals and anxieties of a middle class aware of two kinds of pressure: from ‘above’ and ‘below.’ My contention, in essence, is that the Doctor is one of a number of essentially benign aristocrats created for 1960s television adventure fiction who, by virtue of being marked as archaic through dress and manners, could serve as figures for rehearsing and critiquing different kinds of class relations. Yet I shall also argue that the Doctor’s elite privilege has proven an exceptionally durable conceit, which – after an interlude during which the series’ paternalism was probed in the original novels of the 1990s and early 2000s – persists largely untroubled in the new series, cosmetic changes notwithstanding.\n\nDeﬁ ning ‘Upper’-Class Identity: Lords and Gentlemen Various generalizing claims and counter-claims have been made about Doctor Who’s social and class politics both by the texts’ producers and by scholarly commentators. Many of these revolve\n\nBritton_Ch02.indd 30\n\n2/28/2011 3:20:37 AM\n\nIN A CLASS OF HIS OWN?\n\n31\n\naround the Doctor himself. One oft-repeated mantra, which seems to be at least partially at odds with the character’s self-definition as a gentleman, is that he is an ‘anti-establishment’ figure. This was the consistent position of Verity Lambert, Doctor Who’s first producer, who was later to bemoan the fact that the decidedly ‘clubbable’ Third Doctor, played by Jon Pertwee, was effectively co-opted by the establishment when he took on the role of scientific adviser to the military.41 In The Unfolding Text, Tulloch and Alvarado claim that the Pertwee incarnation Doctor is ‘essentially upper middle class’, noting more generally that ‘the “gentleman” image has always been a central part of the Doctor’s style.’ They further report that one hostile Australian audience member considered this ‘an extremely irritating and patronising South-East English self-indulgent shot at the rest of Britain.’42 Elsewhere, Tulloch and Alvarado quote Tony Skillen’s view that Doctor Who is ‘the last dilettante farewell of a ruling class culture.’43 Sounding a very different note, Chapman says that it is ‘entirely misleading’ to regard the Third Doctor as an establishment figure, suggesting that he is on the contrary a ‘loose cannon’ who is ‘often in conflict with both the military and the civilian authorities.’44 By the same token, while Tulloch and Alvarado categorize the bohemian persona of Tom Baker’s Fourth Doctor as ‘upper class’, Chapman regards this later-1970s version of the character as non-conformist and anti-authoritarian; he identifies Baker’s incarnation with ‘the counter-cultural generation of the 1960s now grown to adulthood’, even seeing ‘the counter-cultural associations of fin-de-siècle Montmartre ... coded into the Doctor’s dress.’45 Commentators have also remarked on the way in which the Doctor’s companions and incidental characters figure in the series’ handling of class and regional identity. Nicholas Cull points out that ‘the original series plan called for the Doctor’s youngest companion to be “working class” ’ (neglecting to emphasize that this plan was not, in fact, brought to fruition), and adduces later companions such as the cockney sailor, Ben, and the refugee from the post-Culloden Highland purges, Jamie, as evidence of the ‘social inclusiveness’ of the text. Yet Cull also observes that the Doctor himself ‘remained upper middle class’, a figure of ‘whiggish interventionism’ in the affairs of working-class people who were ‘in need of leadership, or at the very least technical assistance.’46\n\nBritton_Ch02.indd 31\n\n2/28/2011 3:20:37 AM\n\n32\n\nTARDISbound\n\nThe above claims are remarkable as much for their unacknowledged assumptions as for their polemical force. Whatever their positions, the various commentators take it for granted that definitions such as ‘establishment’, ‘upper class’, ‘upper middle class’ and even ‘gentleman’ are stable and transparent. The mere fact that there is disparity in the unqualified claims that the Doctor belongs to the ruling or upper class on the one hand and the middle class on the other seems to suggest that the writers’ faith in the connotative stability of these terms may be excessive. In order to say something useful about class in Doctor Who, therefore, it seems important to try to clarify the language of class, with the caveat that this is not a topic on which definitive conclusions can be reached. A useful term with which to begin considering class in the context of Doctor Who is ‘gentleman.’ Quite apart from its centrality to debates about the Doctor’s status, the word ‘gentleman’ is unlike the more abstract categories of degree used to define class, such as ‘upper’ and ‘middle’, in that it once had concrete significance. In Britain the term originally denoted a man of gentle birth, which is to say someone who did not rank among the nobility but was permitted to bear arms. With social and political changes in the nineteenth century which definitively upset the vestiges of the old feudal order, the meaning shifted to connote less a specific social rank than a general sense of superior social standing, and the possession of chivalrous instincts, intelligence and fine feelings. While it could be applied to those working in commerce, the term generally suggested a person whose financial means, to quote the Oxford English Dictionary, ‘enable him to live in easy circumstances without engaging in trade’; in short, ‘a man of money and leisure.’ This more recent, looser connotation of the word ‘gentleman’ seems readily applicable to the Doctor, at least as regards the idea of economic freedom (for issues of superior conduct or refinement are again slippery ideas, unless they can be directly linked to concrete factors such as mode of speech). The Doctor manifestly lives in ‘easy circumstances’ in that neither he nor those who travel with him seem to lack creature comforts, and he is clearly not obliged to work for pay. On the contrary, during the period of his imprisonment by the Time Lords on Earth in the early 1970s, it was made quite explicit that his role as adviser to U.N.I.T. was to be unpaid (‘Spearhead from Space’, 1970). The Doctor’s ‘home’, the TARDIS,\n\nBritton_Ch02.indd 32\n\n2/28/2011 3:20:38 AM\n\nIN A CLASS OF HIS OWN?\n\n33\n\nmight sometimes be mechanically unreliable and its internal spaces are seldom represented as opulent, but it is exceedingly spacious and unimaginably sophisticated. Moreover, the Doctor appears not to have to worry himself with routine upkeep, at least in terms of such matters as domestic cleanliness. Within the context of the adventure narrative, of course, the Doctor is an essentially magical character for whom mundane chores such as housekeeping have no meaning. Yet, whatever the internal or generic justification, the alignment between his conditions of existence of those of the traditional leisured classes is undeniable. Of course, the gentry are not the only leisured class with which the Doctor could be associated. Much more unequivocally leisured, even today, are members of the aristocracy. The distinction between the aristocrat and the gentleman seems to me an important one if we want to discuss the Doctor’s class orientation in ways which have been meaningful during the lifetime of the Doctor Who texts. To think of the Doctor as an aristocrat is to locate him in historically tangible ways. As noted, the term ‘gentleman’ has increasingly come to connote a standard of refined manners and respect for others rather than a position within a particular social group. Aristocracy, on the other hand, is purely a matter of birth, traditionally carrying (for men, at least) the entitled expectation of participating in government or other forms of maintenance of the social order (as clergyman, soldier or lawyer). Skillen’s reported suggestion that Doctor Who is the ‘last dilettante farewell of a ruling class culture’ is much easier to sustain in relation to the aristocracy than the more nebulous category of ‘gentleman’, for the hereditary nobility were certainly more or less moribund as a ruling elite when Doctor Who began. The last British prime minister of noble birth, Alec Douglas Home, completed his brief tenure as premier less than a year after the programme’s debut. Changes to the constitution of House of Lords have been intermittently in train ever since.47 Moreover, the Conservative party, of which Home was a member, has changed its class affiliation with the rise of the New Right: the Heath, Thatcher and Major governments were increasingly dominated by self-made men rather than the landed classes.48 The Doctor himself has been explicitly associated with notions of aristocracy for most of Doctor Who’s history. While the First Doctor claimed only to be a gentleman in ‘The Daleks’ Master Plan’, he was\n\nBritton_Ch02.indd 33\n\n2/28/2011 3:20:38 AM\n\n34\n\nTARDISbound\n\nclearly identified as a Time Lord four years later in ‘The War Games’ (1969). Even without learning – as audiences eventually did in ‘The Deadly Assassin’ (1976) – that ‘Time Lord’ was not the name for his whole race, but for its ruling class, the overtones of nobility are hard to miss. For example, the Pertwee Doctor’s aristocratic mien drew comment from at least one of the self-declared fans interviewed for John Tulloch and Henry Jenkins’s book Science Fiction Audiences.49 His ‘lordly’ status surely renders problematic the claim made both by Cull and by Tulloch and Alvarado that the Doctor is essentially ‘upper middle class.’ While the title ‘Doctor’ could be taken as professional and therefore indicative of earned rather than inherited status, there is little else about the hero of Doctor Who which suggests traditional middle-class values of sobriety, responsibility, thrift and hard work. Conversely, there is a great deal which suggests the casual entitlement of the ‘upper crust.’ For example, the often brusque manner which all the Doctors adopt in varying degrees is remote from the mealy-mouthed equivocation, euphemism and denial often regarded as characteristic of the ‘considerate’ middle class, and correspondingly close to the unrepentant bluntness of the upper crust (which is, ironically enough, something aristocrats supposedly share with the working class).50 This was certainly true at the outset of the classic series, with Hartnell’s prickly and uncompromising portrayal. Indeed, at its inception Doctor Who made a clear distinction between the narrative’s de facto heroes, the measured and reasonable schoolteachers, Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright, who were embodiments of middle-class probity, and the selfish, impatient and contemptuous Doctor, correspondingly the (anti-heroic) embodiment of aristocratic hauteur. If there was an ‘establishment’ to which the Doctor was being opposed, as Verity Lambert claimed, it was surely envisaged as the responsible, war-generation, middleclass establishment, for this social group had attained unprecedented political dominance in the 1920s and 1930s.51 Both the level-headed and reliable Ian Chesterton and his successor in the role of commonsensical male companion, Steven Taylor, were apt heroes for the middle class as it imagined itself in the post-war decades. Both embodied the independence and responsibility which had so long been self-defined virtues of the middle class,\n\nBritton_Ch02.indd 34\n\n2/28/2011 3:20:38 AM\n\nIN A CLASS OF HIS OWN?\n\n35\n\nand as such contained, defused and simultaneously underscored the Doctor’s excesses, rendering him safe and amusing.52\n\nMarkers of Class: Dress and Address As I shall shortly argue, the First Doctor’s air of aristocratic privilege and prerogative continues to play into the construction of the character in recent Doctor Who texts, including the new series. Other signifiers of class have changed, however, and it is worth briefly addressing them. Of paramount importance among shifting signifiers of class are speech and dress. Of these, clothing is arguably more difficult to place securely on the polarity between uppermiddle-class and aristocratic paradigms. What may usefully be said is that nearly all the Doctor’s first eight incarnations have worn outfits which were not merely redolent of the past but more specifically past modes of finery.53 The only exception is Patrick Troughton’s Second Doctor, whose shabby and ill-fitting costume is often likened to that worn by Charlie Chaplin’s ‘little tramp.’54 Otherwise, until the advent of the ascetically clad Christopher Eccleston in the new series, silks, velvets, plaids and embroidery have been very much in evidence (all markers of the ‘foppery’ from which Eccleston was expressly keen to distance himself). So, too, have items of clothing strongly associated with the elite in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: smoking jackets and frock coats, Inverness cloaks, fancy waistcoats and golfing sweaters, Byron neckties and cravats, spats and cloth-top boots, and so on. If one were to try to code the first eight Doctors’ wardrobes simply as a function of class – as opposed to acknowledging the possibility that they might embody masquerade, irony or subversive appropriation – then Tulloch and Alvarado would surely be right in linking all these smart costumes with the ‘upper class.’ Less germane is their insistence on upper-middle-class status in Pertwee’s case. Neither his nor any other Doctor’s clothing bespeaks any of the signs of industry and sobriety which the self-identified middle class has traditionally valued. On the contrary, velvet is for reasons of expense and relative fragility clearly associated with non-strenuous leisure activities, while the natty glen plaids and Irish tweeds of Tom Baker’s Doctor chiefly evoke the country pursuits of the landed\n\nBritton_Ch02.indd 35\n\n2/28/2011 3:20:39 AM\n\n36\n\nTARDISbound\n\nelite. Yet having said all that, even before we get to Peter Davison’s curious, scarlet-braided umpire’s coat or the patchwork horror foisted on Colin Baker, the overtones of eccentricity or decadence in the Doctors’ fussy attire complicate any straightforward association with class. So, too, do their frequent youth resonances, a matter to which I shall return at the end of this chapter. The Doctor’s mode of speech is a slightly different matter, for its class significance is unequivocal. The first six actors to play the Doctor all spoke using received pronunciation, a clear marker of the upper-middle and (with variants) landed classes. Indeed, in Watching the English Kate Fox writes: ‘a person with an upperclass accent, using upper-class terminology, will be recognized as upper class even if he or she is earning poverty-line wages, doing grubby menial work and living in a run-down council flat.’55 With this in mind, one has to question Tulloch and Alvarado’s claim that, by virtue of his scruffy dress, Patrick Troughton’s Doctor is somehow an exception to the gentlemanly norm. 56 Whatever his appearance might suggest, Troughton’s plummy drawl, no less than Pertwee’s lisp, strongly evokes the uppermost echelons of British society. In fact, the ‘classic’ Doctors (bar Sylvester McCoy) all use not merely received pronunciation but a conservative form of this accent. This becomes especially apparent when one listens to the ‘CD extras’ on the Big Finish audio releases. When Colin Baker and Peter Davison are being ‘themselves’ in interview, they both speak in a contemporary version of received pronunciation, quite distinct from the cut-glass tones which they use in their actual performances. It is only in relation to this old-fashioned model of ‘Queen’s English’ that faint traces of the northwest in McGann’s speech, the soft Scots brogue in McCoy’s, or even Tennant’s Estuary English seem to represent any kind of real departure from the Doctor Who norm. Yet, if accent trumps all as an indicator of class, I do not think it can conversely be said that the abrupt breach with received pronunciation and ‘upper-class’ speech patterns with Christopher Eccleston has in any substantive sense democratized the elitist Doctor. In his Ninth and Tenth incarnations he remained as highhanded and rude as ever the First, Third or Sixth Doctors were, and as menacingly overbearing as the Fourth could be. Nor has\n\nBritton_Ch02.indd 36\n\n2/28/2011 3:20:39 AM\n\nIN A CLASS OF HIS OWN?\n\n37\n\nhis mode of life changed in the new series, even if in the Ninth and Tenth Doctors had a more obviously beaten-up, Heath Robinson TARDIS, wore more casual clothing and supposedly sounded less ‘poncey.’ Even the faintly inept and scattered-seeming Eleventh Doctor is still ultimately the lord of all he surveys, sweeping into crisis situations to act as troubleshooter and moral arbiter and then sweeping out again. In the specific case of the ‘northern’ Ninth Doctor, it could be argued that actions and attitudes serve powerfully to recuperate his ruling-class identity, even as his accent seems to belie it. In his debut episode he dismisses humans en masse as useless entities who do nothing but ‘eat chips, go to bed and watch telly’ – a clear jibe at working-class stereotypes. Three episodes later he is openly contemptuous of the fact that, while history is being made (in the form of an alien spacecraft landing in central London), Rose’s family and friends are narrowly preoccupied with ‘where you can buy dodgy top-up cards for half price.’ All this loftiness tends to create the impression that his quasi-working-class persona is a Time Lord’s version of ‘slumming it.’\n\nClass Systems, Class Struggles, and the Beleaguered Middle Ultimately, it is only a little more persuasive to claim that the Ninth Doctor is a man of the people than to suggest that Pertwee’s suave, velvet-and-silk-clad Third Doctor must really be an anti-establishment figure simply because he goes head to head with establishment figures. Pertwee’s Doctor is in fact an inveterate namedropper. For example, in ‘Terror of the Autons’ (1971) he has no qualms about putting a meddlesome civil servant in his place by invoking the name of the man’s Whitehall superior, Lord Rowlands. With studied emphasis, the Doctor reveals not only that Rowlands and he are members of the same club but that they are on sufficiently familiar terms for the Doctor to address Rowlands as ‘Tubby.’ By the same token, the Tenth Doctor apparently has no qualms about continuing to refer to himself – almost ad nauseam, in fact – as a Time Lord, even though this elite group was destroyed along with his home planet.\n\nBritton_Ch02.indd 37\n\n2/28/2011 3:20:40 AM\n\n38\n\nTARDISbound\n\nMy point here is not that it would be more politically correct and egalitarian for the Doctor to disavow his ruling-class roots or predilections, but rather that there seems to be a false dichotomy in critical attitudes to the character’s class status. Commentators insist that he is, for example, either ‘establishment’ or ‘anti-establishment’ but never adequately acknowledge that he might be both. It is worth stressing again that these attempts to place the Doctor tidily and definitively in a given class role always imply a binary and thus an essentially adversarial model of class. When it is posited that the Doctor is upper-middle-class, there must be a counterbalancing ‘working class’ to which he can condescend.57 The same applies to arguments over whether the Fourth Doctor’s ‘bohemian’ style of dress carries a traditionally counter-cultural valence or is simply ‘upper class.’ However the Doctor’s class is identified, there is always an implied opposite which he is not. In fact, as David Cannadine points out in The Rise and Fall of Class in Britain, the adversarial view of class, which sees society as polarized between the two extremes of ‘them and us’, is not the only model which has been deployed in the last two centuries. In seeking to define the ways in which ‘Britons saw and understood the manifestly unequal society in which they lived’, Cannadine convincingly argues that class experience has been defined in the interplay of three models, which may take turns in rhetorical ascendancy, coexist in tension or shade into one another at different historical moments.58 As well as the adversarial model, there is the triadic, in which class is understood in terms of three groups or estates, the most usual formulation in Britain being upper, middle and lower, and the hierarchical, in which society is understood in essentially individualist terms to be an almost infinitely graded ‘procession’ of status rankings.59 One good reason for stressing the Doctor’s aristocratic identity is to broaden the discussion of class in the Doctor Who texts beyond the upper-versus-lower-class dichotomy, and to acknowledge the threefoldness of the social order strongly implied in the classic series during the 1960s and early 1970s. The triadic model of class, which envisages an upper, middle and lower social group, not only provides better insight into the relationships between the Doctor and his companions but also seems relevant to many of the fears addressed in the series’ horror narratives. Here, as I shall argue, Doctor Who focused the anxieties of a managerial middle\n\nBritton_Ch02.indd 38\n\n2/28/2011 3:20:40 AM\n\nIN A CLASS OF HIS OWN?\n\n39\n\nclass which avowedly felt beleaguered from both above and below in the second post-war decade. By almost any definition the Doctor’s earliest earthly companions, the schoolteachers Ian and Barbara, fall squarely inside the (notoriously permeable60) perimeter of the middle class. The tensions between the schoolteachers and the Doctor can easily be read in class terms, and if there is a ‘victory’ in this class skirmish, it is initially to the responsible bourgeoisie. While Ian and Barbara increasingly defer to his superior knowledge, the Doctor is more notably affected in that his fellow travellers have a mellowing influence upon him. After their mutual dislike comes to a paranoiac head in ‘Inside the Spaceship’ (1964), he not only warms to them personally but also changes his own modus operandi. He presents himself increasingly as detached observer rather than selfish and self-willed agent in their adventures, at least when these adventures take place in Earth’s past, in which history is supposedly irrevocable. For much of the rest of Ian and Barbara’s incumbency the Doctor plays a customary role not only for the older generation but for the old-Tory, landed classes: he is the custodian of and spokesperson for tradition, standing for history. This is true even where he occasionally gets embroiled in notable historical events such as the fire of Rome in AD 64, for his intervention here contributes to recorded history rather than diverting it. The Doctor’s role in relation to his companions and others changed in the later 1960s and early 1970s, but I would argue that his aristocracy remained an important element in defining the ideological tenor of the programme. Patrick Troughton’s and Jon Pertwee’s incumbencies saw middle-class identity repeatedly troubled, and the Doctor was often the catalyst for this disruption. Shifts in attitudes to class were to some extent evident in changes to the TARDIS crew: in 1966, for the first time, the main protagonists collectively represented all ‘estates’ within the triadic model when the aristocratic Doctor was joined by Polly, an embodiment of swinging, middle-class youth culture, and a working-class, cockney sailor, Ben. Yet from the advent of the Second Doctor onwards, class identities were more often examined and negotiated within a broader narrative arena. To some extent it might seem that the seemingly middle-class orientation of Doctor Who is a function of its metropolitan bias.\n\nBritton_Ch02.indd 39\n\n2/28/2011 3:20:40 AM\n\n40\n\nTARDISbound\n\nIf we return to the matter of speech, it is notable that the dramatis personae in Doctor Who exhibited very little variation of accents during the classic series.
