        "text": "Klonopin is a brand-name oral tablet that’s prescribed for certain seizure disorders, panic disorder, and agoraphobia. Klonopin contains the active drug clonazepam and belongs to the benzodiazepine drug class.\n\nKlonopin is FDA-approved to treat:\n\nCertain seizure disorders in adults and children of all ages. A seizure disorder is a condition in which you have several seizures. Klonopin treats:\n\natonic seizures\n\nmyoclonic seizures\n\nsome absence seizures (which used to be called petit mal seizures)\n\nPanic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults. Panic disorder is a type of mental health condition that causes repeated panic attacks. Agoraphobia is a fear of being in places from which it may be hard to leave.\n\nIs Klonopin a controlled substance?\n\nYes, Klonopin is a controlled substance. A controlled substance is a drug that’s regulated by the government because it can lead to misuse or addiction.\n\nKlonopin contains the active drug clonazepam, which is classified as a Schedule IV (four) drug by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This means that the drug has acceptable medical uses, but it has the risks mentioned above.\n\nFor more information, see the “Klonopin withdrawal and dependence” section below.\n\nEffectiveness\n\nFor information about the effectiveness of Klonopin, see the “Klonopin uses” section below.\n\nKlonopin is a brand-name drug that contains the active drug clonazepam. This active drug is also available as a generic medication. A generic drug is an exact copy of the active drug in a brand-name medication.\n\nThe generic is considered to be as safe and effective as the original drug. Generics tend to cost less than brand-name drugs.\n\nIf you’re interested in taking the generic form of Klonopin, talk with your doctor. They can tell you if it comes in forms and strengths that can be used for your condition.\n\nThe Klonopin dosage your doctor prescribes will depend on several factors. These include:\n\nyour age\n\nweight (for children)\n\nthe type and severity of the condition you’re taking Klonopin to treat\n\nother medical conditions you may have\n\nTypically, your doctor will start you on a low dosage. They may adjust it over time to reach the amount that’s right for you. They’ll ultimately prescribe the lowest dosage that provides the desired effect.\n\nThe following information describes dosages that are commonly used or recommended. However, be sure to take the dosage your doctor prescribes for you. Your doctor will determine the best dosage to fit your needs.\n\nTo learn more about Klonopin’s dosage, see this comprehensive article.\n\nDrug forms and strengths\n\nKlonopin comes as oral tablets. They’re available in three strengths: 0.5 milligrams (mg), 1.0 mg, and 2.0 mg.\n\nBe sure to take only the dosage of Klonopin that your doctor prescribes.\n\nDosage for seizure disorders\n\nTo treat certain seizure disorders in adults, you’ll likely take a 0.5-mg dose of Klonopin three times per day. If your seizures are not well managed after 3 days, your doctor may increase your dose by 0.5 mg to 1 mg. They’ll continue adjusting your dose every 3 days or so until your seizures are well managed.\n\nThe maximum dosage (highest dose) of Klonopin for seizure disorders in adults is a total of 20 mg per day. The drug is divided into doses throughout the day. Be sure to follow your doctor’s instructions about how many hours between doses are safe for you.\n\nDosage for panic disorder\n\nTo treat panic disorder, you’ll likely take 0.25 mg of Klonopin two times per day. If your panic disorder is not well managed after 3 days, your doctor may increase your dosage to 0.5 mg two times per day. Most people find that their panic disorder is well managed with this dosage.\n\nHowever, your doctor may continue to make dosage adjustments until they find what works for you. The maximum dosage of Klonopin for panic disorder is 4 mg per day.\n\nChildren’s dosage\n\nTo treat seizures in children, the dosage of Klonopin depends on your child’s age and weight:\n\nFor children ages 11 to 17 years, the recommended dosage is the same as for adults. See “Dosage for seizure disorders” above.\n\nFor children ages 10 years and younger or children who weigh 30 kilograms (about 66 pounds) or less, the dosage is based on their weight. The typical starting dosage is 0.01 to 0.03 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) of body weight per day. This is divided into two or three doses per day. Your child’s doctor can determine the right dosage.\n\nYour child’s doctor may continue to adjust the dose until the seizure disorder is well managed.\n\nKlonopin is not approved to treat panic disorder in children. So there is no approved children’s dosage for this use.\n\nWhat if I miss a dose?\n\nIf you miss a dose of Klonopin, you should take it as soon as possible. But if it’s almost time for your next scheduled dose, you should skip the missed dose and take your next dose as usual. You should not take extra doses to make up for a missed dose. Taking extra doses may increase your risk for side effects.*\n\nTo help make sure that you don’t miss a dose, try using a medication reminder. This can include setting an alarm or timer on your phone or downloading a reminder app. A kitchen timer can work, too.\n\n* For more information about side effects, see the “Klonopin side effects” section above.\n\nWill I need to use this drug long term?\n\nWhen you’re considering Klonopin as a treatment option, you may be wondering whether you’ll need to take Klonopin for life.\n\nKlonopin can be a short-term or long-term treatment. Keep in mind that the long-term effectiveness of Klonopin hasn’t been studied for longer than 9 weeks.\n\nBecause of this, it’s important that you and your doctor discuss from time to time whether you need to continue Klonopin treatment. They may suggest slowly reducing your dosage to see if your seizures or panic attacks can be managed with less medication. Or your doctor may recommend you take a different drug that allows your condition to be treated without Klonopin.\n\nHow long Klonopin is used varies. Some people find that long-term use of low-dose Klonopin is safe and effective for their condition. If you and your doctor determine that there are no other effective treatment options available, it’s likely you’ll take Klonopin long term.\n\nKlonopin can cause mild or serious side effects. The following lists contain some of the key side effects that may occur while taking the drug. These lists do not include all possible side effects.\n\nFor more information about the possible side effects of Klonopin, talk with your doctor or pharmacist. They can give you tips on how to manage any side effects that may be concerning or bothersome.\n\nNote: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) tracks side effects of drugs it has approved. If you would like to notify the FDA about a side effect you’ve had with Klonopin, you can do so through MedWatch.\n\nMild side effects\n\nMild side effects* of Klonopin can include:\n\ndrowsiness\n\ndizziness\n\ntrouble with walking and coordination\n\nfatigue (lack of energy)\n\nincreased saliva (drool)\n\nSome of these side effects may go away within a few days or a couple of weeks. But if they become more severe or don’t go away, talk with your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n* This is a partial list of mild side effects from Klonopin. To learn about other mild side effects, talk with your doctor or pharmacist, or see Klonopin’s medication guide.\n\nSerious side effects\n\nSerious side effects from Klonopin aren’t common, but they can occur. Call your doctor right away if you have serious side effects. Call 911 or your local emergency number if your symptoms feel life threatening or if you think you’re having a medical emergency.\n\nSerious side effects and their symptoms can include:\n\nSuicidal thoughts or actions, which are very rare. Symptoms can include:\n\nnew or worsening depression or anxiety\n\ninsomnia (trouble sleeping)\n\nchanges in your emotions, moods, or behaviors\n\nProblems with thinking and memory. Symptoms can include:\n\nconfusion\n\ntrouble understanding or remembering things\n\nAllergic reaction.*\n\nRisk of misuse or addiction.*†\n\nRisk of dependence and withdrawal.†‡\n\nRisk of serious injury or death if taken with opioids.†§\n\n* For more information about this side effect, see the “Side effect details” section below.\n\n† Klonopin has a boxed warning for this side effect. A boxed warning is the most serious warning from the FDA. The warning alerts doctors and patients about drug effects that may be dangerous.\n\n‡ For more information about this side effect, , see the “Klonopin withdrawal and dependence” section below.\n\n§ For more information about this side effect, see the “Klonopin interactions” section below.\n\nSuicide prevention\n\nIf you know someone at immediate risk of self-harm, suicide, or hurting another person:\n\nAsk the tough question: “Are you considering suicide?”\n\nListen to the person without judgment.\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number, or text TALK to 741741 to communicate with a trained crisis counselor.\n\nStay with the person until professional help arrives.\n\nTry to remove any weapons, medications, or other potentially harmful objects if it’s safe to do so.\n\nIf you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, a prevention hotline can help. The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline is available 24 hours a day at 988. During a crisis, people who are hard of hearing can use their preferred relay service or dial 711 then 988.\n\nFind more links and local resources.\n\nSide effects in children\n\nKlonopin may cause side effects in children similar to those in adults.\n\nHowever, it’s possible for children to develop paradoxical reactions while taking Klonopin. The term “paradoxical” means opposite. So instead of causing drowsiness and fatigue (as in adults), Klonopin may cause increased excitement in children. This may include being more talkative or emotional than usual and having more energy.\n\nIf you have any questions about Klonopin’s side effects in your child, talk with their doctor.\n\nSide effect details\n\nHere are some details on certain side effects this drug may cause. For further details, you can refer to this article.\n\nRisk of misuse and addiction\n\nTaking Klonopin may cause an addiction to the drug, even if it’s taken as prescribed. Taking Klonopin can also lead to misuse, which may increase the risk of overdose and, in some cases, death. Klonopin has a boxed warning for these risks. A boxed warning is the most serious type of warning from the FDA. It alerts doctors and patients about drug effects that may be dangerous.\n\nAddiction refers to feeling unable to stop taking a drug, even though it may be causing harm. And misuse means a drug is used in a way other than how it’s prescribed. Some examples of misusing Klonopin include crushing and snorting the tablets or mixing them with other drugs in an effort to feel “high.”\n\nMisuse side effects from Klonopin can include:\n\ndelirium (a sudden change in a person’s mental function)\n\nparanoia (being suspicious or mistrusting of others for no known reason)\n\nsuicidal thoughts or actions\n\nseizures\n\nrespiratory depression (slowed, shallow breathing)\n\ncoma\n\nin some cases, death\n\nTo find out how often this side effect occurred in clinical studies, see Klonopin’s prescribing information.\n\nIf you’ve had problems with drug misuse or addiction in the past, it’s important to talk with your doctor about it. They can work with you to find a treatment that’s best for you.\n\nSexual side effects\n\nSexual side effects from Klonopin aren’t common, but they can occur. Sexual side effects can include:\n\ndelayed ejaculation\n\nerectile dysfunction\n\ndecreased libido (sexual desire)\n\nSexual problems were reported in people who took Klonopin in clinical studies. These side effects may be more likely in people taking high doses of Klonopin.\n\nTo find out how often this side effect occurred in clinical studies, see Klonopin’s prescribing information.\n\nIf you have sexual side effects with Klonopin, talk with your doctor. They may adjust your dosage or suggest other treatments, such as sildenafil (Viagra).\n\nLow blood pressure\n\nWhen hypotension (low blood pressure) occurred with Klonopin in clinical studies, it was usually due to a condition called orthostatic hypotension. With orthostatic hypotension, your blood pressure drops quickly when you stand up, which may cause you to feel dizzy. The condition wasn’t commonly reported.\n\nHypotension can also be a symptom of overdose. To learn more, see the “Klonopin overdose” section below.\n\nTo find out how often orthostatic hypotension occurred in clinical studies, see Klonopin’s prescribing information.\n\nSymptoms of orthostatic hypotension can include:\n\nfainting\n\nlightheadedness or feeling dizzy\n\nnausea\n\nfatigue (lack of energy)\n\nIf you have any of these symptoms while taking Klonopin, talk with your doctor. They may want to see whether Klonopin or something else is the cause. If the orthostatic hypotension is due to the drug, your doctor may adjust your dosage or treatment plan.\n\nAllergic reaction\n\nAs with most drugs, some people can have an allergic reaction after taking Klonopin.\n\nSymptoms of a mild allergic reaction can include:\n\nskin rash\n\nitchiness\n\nflushing\n\nA more severe allergic reaction is rare but possible. Symptoms of a severe allergic reaction can include:\n\nswelling under your skin, typically in your eyelids, lips, hands, or feet\n\nswelling of your tongue, mouth, or throat\n\ntrouble breathing\n\nCall your doctor right away if you have an allergic reaction to Klonopin, as the reaction could become severe. Call 911 or your local emergency number if your symptoms feel life threatening or if you think you’re having a medical emergency.\n\nHere are answers to some frequently asked questions about Klonopin.\n\nCan Klonopin be used to treat anxiety? If so, what’s the dosage for anxiety?\n\nKlonopin isn’t specifically approved to treat anxiety. But the drug is approved to treat panic disorder, which is a type of anxiety disorder.\n\nWith panic disorder, the thought of having a panic attack may increase anxiety. Klonopin may help ease anxiety that’s related to panic disorder.\n\nHow long Klonopin works for anxiety related to panic disorder depends on several factors, including how severe your symptoms are. To learn more, including information about dosage, talk with your doctor.\n\nWhat is Klonopin’s dosage for sleep?\n\nKlonopin is not approved to treat sleep problems such as insomnia (trouble falling asleep or staying asleep). But the drug may be used off-label for sleep problems. Off-label drug use is when an FDA-approved drug is used for a purpose other than what it’s approved for.\n\nAlso, sleepiness is a common side effect of Klonopin, especially when you first start treatment.\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about taking Klonopin for sleep problems, including what the dosage would be, talk with your doctor.\n\nIs Klonopin a narcotic? Will it make you ‘high’?\n\nNo, Klonopin is not a narcotic (a powerful pain reliever also known as an opioid). And misusing the drug may make you feel “high.”\n\nNarcotics are opioid analgesic (painkiller) drugs used to relieve severe pain. Examples include:\n\ncodeine hydrocodone (Zohydro ER)\n\noxycodone (OxyContin)\n\nmorphine (MS Contin, Kadian)\n\nBenzodiazepines, such as Klonopin, are not used to treat pain.\n\nKlonopin contains the drug clonazepam, which is a Schedule IV controlled substance. A controlled substance is a drug that’s regulated by the government because it can lead to misuse or addiction. Misuse means a drug is used in a way other than how it’s prescribed. And addiction refers to feeling unable to stop taking a drug, even though it may be causing harm.\n\nSome people may confuse the term “narcotic” with “controlled substance.” But they are not the same, and not all controlled substances are narcotics.\n\nIf you have other questions about Klonopin, talk with your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nIs Klonopin used for depression or alcohol withdrawal?\n\nKlonopin is not approved to treat alcohol withdrawal or depression. But the drug may be used off-label to treat alcohol withdrawal. Off-label drug use is when an FDA-approved drug is used for a purpose other than what it’s approved for.\n\nWithdrawal symptoms are side effects that can occur when you stop taking a drug that your body has become dependent on.\n\nKlonopin is a type of drug called a benzodiazepine. Other benzodiazepines are more commonly used to treat alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Examples of these drugs include chlordiazepoxide (Librium), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam (Ativan).\n\nTo learn more about Klonopin’s uses as well as treatments for alcohol withdrawal and depression, talk with your doctor.\n\nHow long does Klonopin stay in your urine?\n\nKlonopin may stay in your urine for about 1 month after your last dose.\n\nIn one study, traces of clonazepam (the active drug in Klonopin) were detected in urine tests for 3 to 4 weeks after a single dose.\n\nKlonopin contains the drug clonazepam, which belongs to a class of drugs called benzodiazepines.\n\nClonazepam and other benzodiazepines work by increasing the levels of a chemical called gamma-aminobutyric acid. This chemical sends signals between brain cells. These drugs are thought to make brain cells less sensitive to stimulation, producing a calming effect.\n\nThis calming action makes clonazepam an effective option for preventing and treating seizures or panic attacks.\n\nHow long does it take to work?\n\nKlonopin typically produces a calming effect within 1 to 4 hours. Klonopin’s effects last longer than some other benzodiazepines. The half-life of Klonopin is 30 to 40 hours. A drug’s half-life is the amount of time that it takes for the body to get rid of half a dose.\n\nIt may take a few days or weeks for you and your doctor to find the dosage that works for you.\n\nHow long does it stay in your system?\n\nKlonopin’s effects start to wear off after a few hours, but the drug stays in your body for 6 to 9 days. Keep in mind that traces of the drug can be detected in certain urine tests for up to 1 month after your last dose.\n\nOther drugs are available that can treat seizure disorders or panic disorder. Some may be a better fit for you than others. If you’re interested in finding an alternative to Klonopin, talk with your doctor. They can tell you about other medications that may work well for you.\n\nNote: Some of the drugs listed here are used off-label to treat these specific conditions. Off-label drug use is when an FDA-approved drug is used for a purpose other than what it’s approved for.\n\nAlternatives for seizure disorders\n\nExamples of other drugs that may be used to treat seizure disorders include:\n\nother benzodiazepines, such as:\n\nalprazolam (Xanax)\n\nclobazam (Onfi)\n\ndiazepam (Valium)\n\nlorazepam (Ativan)\n\nseizure drugs, such as:\n\ncarbamazepine (Tegretol)\n\ngabapentin (Neurontin)\n\nlamotrigine (Lamictal)\n\nlevetiracetam (Keppra)\n\noxcarbazepine (Trileptal, Oxtellar XR)\n\ntopiramate (Topamax)\n\nAlternatives for panic disorder\n\nExamples of other drugs that may be used to treat panic disorder include:\n\nother benzodiazepines, such as:\n\nalprazolam (Xanax)\n\nchlordiazepoxide (Librium)\n\ndiazepam (Valium)\n\nlorazepam (Ativan)\n\noxazepam (Serax)\n\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressants, such as:\n\nfluoxetine (Prozac)\n\nparoxetine (Paxil)\n\nsertraline (Zoloft)\n\nvenlafaxine (Effexor XR)\n\nKlonopin can cause withdrawal and physical dependence. In fact, the drug has a boxed warning for these risks. A boxed warning alerts doctors and patients about drug effects that may be dangerous.\n\nWithdrawal symptoms are side effects that can occur when you stop taking a drug that your body has become dependent on. And with dependence, your body needs the drug to feel like you usually do.\n\nTaking Klonopin can lead to physical dependence. Klonopin treatment can also lead to withdrawal if you stop taking the drug suddenly. These effects can happen especially if you take the drug often, long term, or in high dosages before stopping treatment.\n\nTo help prevent withdrawal, your doctor will typically taper off (gradually reduce) your Klonopin dosage very slowly, usually over several weeks or months. For example, your doctor may reduce your dosage by 0.25 milligrams (mg) each week before having you stop Klonopin treatment completely.\n\nWithdrawal symptoms\n\nEven short-term use of Klonopin (as little as 3 to 6 weeks) at prescribed dosages can cause physical dependence and withdrawal.\n\nThe withdrawal timeline for Klonopin isn’t the same for everyone. The severity of the withdrawal can also vary. But it’s common to experience withdrawal in phases.\n\nThe first phase is acute (short-term) withdrawal. Symptoms may start within 1 to 3 days of your last dose. Acute withdrawal from Klonopin may last for a few weeks.\n\nAcute withdrawal symptoms can range from mild to severe and may include:\n\nuncontrolled muscle movements and body tremors (shaking)\n\nanxiety\n\nblurred vision\n\npersonality or mood changes\n\ndizziness\n\nfatigue (lack of energy)\n\ndigestive reactions, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and reduced appetite\n\nheadache\n\nincreased sensitivity to light and loud noises\n\nincreased blood pressure or heart rate\n\ninsomnia (trouble falling asleep or staying asleep)\n\nmuscle pain and stiffness\n\npanic attacks\n\nseizures, which may be life threatening\n\nAfter acute withdrawal, it’s common to develop a protracted (lengthened) phase of withdrawal. This second phase can last for weeks or months. Some symptoms may happen for more than 12 months.\n\nProtracted withdrawal symptoms can include:\n\nanxiety\n\nproblems with thinking and memory\n\nchanges in mood, such as depression\n\ninsomnia\n\nnumbness, prickling, or the feeling of something crawling on your skin\n\nmuscle weakness or twitching\n\ntinnitus (ringing in your ears)\n\nYou should not suddenly stop taking Klonopin. If you’re thinking about stopping treatment with the drug, talk with your doctor first.\n\nYou may wonder how Klonopin compares with other medications that are prescribed for similar uses. To find out how clonazepam (the active drug in Klonopin) compares with Xanax (alprazolam), see this article.\n\nTaking Klonopin and drinking alcohol can increase your risk for dangerous side effects. These include excessive sleepiness, respiratory depression (slowed, shallow breathing), coma, and in some cases, death.\n\nThe use of drugs called benzodiazepines, including Klonopin, can lead to misuse and physical dependence.* Misuse means a drug is used in a way other than how it’s prescribed. And with physical dependence, your body needs the drug to function like usual. Consuming alcohol with benzodiazepines increases these risks.\n\nThe safest option is to avoid drinking alcohol while taking Klonopin. Another option is to talk with your doctor. They can advise you on whether it’s safe to consume any alcohol during your Klonopin treatment.\n\n* Klonopin has a boxed warning for this side effect. A boxed warning is the most serious warning from the FDA. The warning alerts doctors and patients about drug effects that may be dangerous. For more information, see the “Klonopin withdrawal and dependence” section above.\n\nKlonopin can interact with several other medications.\n\nDifferent interactions can cause different effects. For instance, some interactions can interfere with how well a drug works. Other interactions can increase the number of side effects or make them more severe.\n\nIn addition to the following information, you can see this article to learn about Klonopin’s interactions.\n\nKlonopin and other medications\n\nBelow is a list of some medications that can interact with Klonopin. This list does not contain all drugs that may interact with Klonopin.\n\nBefore taking Klonopin, talk with your doctor and pharmacist. Tell them about all prescription, over-the-counter, and other drugs you take. Also tell them about any vitamins, herbs, and supplements you use. Sharing this information can help you avoid potential interactions.\n\nSome drugs in this list are commonly prescribed to treat the same conditions as Klonopin. If your doctor prescribes a drug that may interact with Klonopin, they’ll typically adjust your dosage to reduce the risk of harmful effects. They may also monitor you more closely during your treatment.\n\nCentral nervous system (CNS) depressants. Klonopin, which is a type of drug called a benzodiazepine, can cause CNS depression. So it’s known as a CNS depressant.\n\nCNS depressants can cause sleepiness and can impair your ability to think, react, and move quickly. Less commonly, CNS depressants can cause respiratory depression (slowed, shallow breathing).\n\nTaking Klonopin with other CNS depressants raises your risk for these serious side effects. You and your doctor should discuss the risks and review your treatment plan. If your doctor prescribes more than one CNS depressant for you, they’ll monitor you more closely than usual.\n\nExamples of CNS depressant drugs include:\n\nOpioids. Klonopin has a boxed warning* for the risk of serious injury or death if taken with opioids. These risks can include severe drowsiness, respiratory depression (slowed, shallow breathing), and coma. You should not take Klonopin with an opioid unless you and your doctor have discussed the risks and there are no other available treatment options. If your doctor prescribes Klonopin with an opioid, they will monitor you closely. Some examples of opioids include:\n\ncodeine\n\nhydrocodone (Zohydro ER)\n\noxycodone (OxyContin)\n\ntramadol (Ultram)\n\nSleep aids. Drugs used to treat insomnia (trouble falling asleep or staying asleep) can increase your risk of CNS depression with Klonopin. Examples of sleep aids include:\n\ndiphenhydramine (Benadryl)\n\neszopiclone (Lunesta)\n\nsuvorexant (Belsomra)\n\nzolpidem (Ambien)\n\nBarbiturates. These drugs are used to treat seizure disorders or migraine. Barbiturates can raise your risk of CNS depression with Klonopin. Examples of barbiturates include:\n\nbutalbital (Fioricet)\n\nphenobarbital (Luminal)\n\nCertain antidepressants. The combination of certain antidepressants with Klonopin may increase your risk of CNS and respiratory depression. Some antidepressants may also raise your risk of seizures.
