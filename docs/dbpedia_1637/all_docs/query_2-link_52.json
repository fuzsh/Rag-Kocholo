        "text": "There are 4 main blood groups (types of blood) – A, B, AB and O. Your blood group is determined by the genes you inherit from your parents.\n\nEach group can be either RhD positive or RhD negative, which means in total there are 8 blood groups.\n\nAntibodies and antigens\n\nBlood is made up of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets in a liquid called plasma. Your blood group is identified by antibodies and antigens in the blood.\n\nAntibodies are proteins found in plasma. They're part of your body's natural defences. They recognise foreign substances, such as germs, and alert your immune system, which destroys them.\n\nAntigens are protein molecules found on the surface of red blood cells.\n\nThe ABO system\n\nThere are 4 main blood groups defined by the ABO system:\n\nblood group A – has A antigens on the red blood cells with anti-B antibodies in the plasma\n\nblood group B – has B antigens with anti-A antibodies in the plasma\n\nblood group O – has no antigens, but both anti-A and anti-B antibodies in the plasma\n\nblood group AB – has both A and B antigens, but no antibodies\n\nBlood group O is the most common blood group. Almost half of the UK population (around 48%) has blood group O.\n\nReceiving blood from the wrong ABO group can be life-threatening. For example, if someone with group B blood is given group A blood, their anti-A antibodies will attack the group A cells.\n\nThis is why group A blood must never be given to someone who has group B blood and vice versa.\n\nAs group O red blood cells do not have any A or B antigens, it can safely be given to any other group.\n\nFind out more about the different blood groups on the NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) website\n\nThe Rh system\n\nRed blood cells sometimes have another antigen, a protein known as the RhD antigen. If this is present, your blood group is RhD positive. If it's absent, your blood group is RhD negative.\n\nThis means you can be 1 of 8 blood groups:\n\nA RhD positive (A+)\n\nA RhD negative (A-)\n\nB RhD positive (B+)\n\nB RhD negative (B-)\n\nO RhD positive (O+)\n\nO RhD negative (O-)\n\nAB RhD positive (AB+)\n\nAB RhD negative (AB-)\n\nAbout 85% of the UK population is RhD positive (35% of the population has O+, the most common type).\n\nIn most cases, O RhD negative blood (O-) can safely be given to anyone. It's often used in medical emergencies when the blood type is not immediately known.\n\nIt's safe for most recipients because it does not have any A, B or RhD antigens on the surface of the cells, and is compatible with every other ABO and RhD blood group.\n\nFind out more about the Rh system on the NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) website\n\nBlood group test\n\nTo find out your blood group, a sample of your blood has to be taken and tested. However, GPs do not routinely check people's blood group.\n\nYou can find out your blood group by giving blood.\n\nFor the blood group test, your red blood cells are mixed with different antibody solutions. If, for example, the solution contains anti-B antibodies and you have B antigens on your cells (you're blood group B), it will clump together.\n\nIf the blood does not react to any of the anti-A or anti-B antibodies, it's blood group O. A series of tests with different types of antibody can be used to identify your blood group.\n\nIf you have a blood transfusion (where blood is taken from one person and given to another) your blood will be tested against a sample of donor cells that contain ABO and RhD antigens. If there's no reaction, donor blood with the same ABO and RhD type can be used.\n\nPregnancy\n\nPregnant women are always given a blood group test. This is because if the mother is RhD negative but the child has inherited RhD-positive blood from the father, it could cause complications if left untreated.\n\nRhD-negative women of child-bearing age should always only receive RhD-negative blood.\n\nRead more about Rhesus disease."
