Cornell has been nominated for all three media and has even scooped various awards such as the BFSA Awards, an Eagle Award. Cornell is widely known for the Doctor Who television series. Who Killed Sherlock Holmes is Paul Cornell’s most recent novel. Currently, Paul Cornell resides with his wife and son in Gloucester.

After undergoing some transformation, the four police now have access to a London that is exceedingly dangerous than they would have ever pictured. London Falling is a police procedural novel with a new twist. It is an exceedingly clever urban fantasy, which brings all types of paranormal to policing. London Falling is a book that balances both of these genres perfectly, and it is undeniably one that is exceedingly hard, to put down. After a sting operation, officers Constain, Quinn, Sefton and Ross find out that they possess supernatural powers. An occultist version of the city of London appears before these four cops, and now they can be able to not only view ghosts but also remnants of the past and a suspect who is busy adding a fresh dimension to the case that they had been working on.\n\nWith a new set of skills in their possession, these police officers are more than determined to tackle the problems and put an end to the numerous cases that they had been working on. The team begins first by going after a centuries old witch, Mora Lesley, who has a penchant for child sacrifices as well West Ham United. The witch has survived by helping out monsters such as Toshack by using her skills as well as her longevity and evil powers. With that said, Paul Cornel has worked in the television, literary and comic markets, has been recently named in a triple threat by one George RR Martin and it is exceedingly easy to see why the novel, London is falling is a deviously easy novel to start with, before the pressure eventually cranks up. Cornell will be expected to deliver a remarkably impressive story that is not only emotional but also fun read as well.\n\nThe Severed Streets\n\nIt is the 21st Century, and London is steaming mess of political corruption and social unrest. The effect has the entire police force getting ready for violence in the streets and threats of strikes. It does not take long before a series of murder under extremely strange circumstances. All the victims who were murdered were in enclosed spaces, and the remaining individuals who were present during the killings would not have committed the acts of crime. The lead investigators who possessed a sense of history eventually came to the conclusion that these crimes were committed by Jack the Reaper. After an exceedingly dramatic opening, The Severed Streets settles into an exceedingly perfunctory summation of the events that took place in the first book within this series, London Falling, where Detective Inspector, James Quill and his team of investigators discover that there is a hidden London, one that can only be seen by individuals with a special gift.\n\nSupernatural exists beyond the reality that most of us perceive. There are people who know about the supernatural and use it to their advantage. With this premise in mind, The Severed Streets takes the readers inside the lives of each of James Quill’s team members, as they come to terms with their newly acquired skill sets. For one Lisa Ross, there is an enticing prospect of regaining her father, while for one Tony Constain, it is all about a desire to escape from hell. For each of these characters, there are the challenges of reconciling these new abilities with their day-to-day lives. As the team continues to struggle with their day to day lives, Jack the Reaper strikes once again, causing the London Streets to be exceedingly restless. In this installment, London City is portrayed with a great sense of realism. In contrast to the fantasies that are set in alternate realities and fictional universes, the author Paul Cornell establish a Severed Streets London that is much like the real London. The names and the people are there; people are reading Harry Porter, Neil Gaiman is featured as a character in this book, and there is a looming scandal that involves newspapers and politicians as well.\n\nThe third appearance by Gaiman completes this book’s transformation from a supernatural mystery with winks at pop culture to an exceedingly intense and dark story one with death and life consequences for all the characters and a trip through hell for one of the main characters. This, in turn, makes this book, a novel with numerous elements, which would overpower the rest of the story. Gaiman’s appearance would serve as a distracting gimmick. With that said, The Severed Streets is a brilliantly written novel that features well-drawn characters, who are still coming to terms with their newly found skills."
