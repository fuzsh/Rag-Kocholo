        "text": "What Psychologists Do About this section\n\nPsychologists study cognitive, emotional, and social processes and behavior by observing, interpreting, and recording how people relate to one another and to their environments. They use their findings to help improve processes and behaviors.\n\nDuties\n\nPsychologists typically do the following:\n\nStudy behavior and brain function by observing, interviewing, and surveying individuals\n\nIdentify psychological, emotional, behavioral, or organizational issues and diagnose disorders\n\nResearch and identify behavioral or emotional issues, such as anxiety and depression\n\nTest for patterns that will help them better understand and predict behavior\n\nDiscuss the results of testing with clients or their families and, if needed, develop treatment plans\n\nWrite articles, research papers, and reports to share findings\n\nPsychologists seek to understand and explain thoughts, emotions, and behavior. Through techniques such as observation, assessment, and experimentation, they try to gain a better understanding about how beliefs and feelings influence people.\n\nPsychologists often gather information and evaluate behavior through controlled laboratory experiments, psychoanalysis, or psychotherapy. They may administer personality, performance, aptitude, or intelligence tests. They look for patterns of behavior or relationships between events, and they use this information in their research or when treating clients.\n\nThe following are examples of types of psychologists:\n\nClinical and counseling psychologists assess, diagnose, and treat mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders. They help people deal with problems ranging from everyday issues to severe, chronic conditions.\n\nClinical and counseling psychologists typically interview clients, administer diagnostic tests, and provide psychotherapy to individuals, families, and groups. They help clients identify their strengths and available resources to prevent or manage problems, and they design behavior modification plans that they help clients to implement.\n\nClinical and counseling psychologists sometimes work with a specific population, such as older people, or focus on a specific condition, such as cognitive disorders. Some states permit clinical psychologists to prescribe medication.\n\nIndustrial–organizational psychologists apply psychological principles to solve workplace problems and improve work-life quality. They study issues such as productivity, employee testing and selection, and organizational dynamics. They may work closely with top executives, training and development managers, and training and development specialists.\n\nSchool psychologists study strategies to address educational, behavioral, or developmental problems that impact students’ learning. They may design and implement performance plans, evaluate performance, and counsel students and families. They may consult with teachers, administrators, and other educators.\n\nOther psychologists include forensic psychologists, who work with judges, attorneys, and related specialists to understand the psychological aspects of a legal case; neuropsychologists, who study how dysfunction or damage to the brain, spine, or nerves affects behavior and cognition; and rehabilitation psychologists, who help foster independence in clients who have physical or developmental disabilities due to illness or injury.\n\nPsychologists are among several specialists who focus on mental and behavioral health. For more information about some of these specialists, see the profiles on psychiatrists, a type of physician; marriage and family therapists, substance abuse, behavioral disorder, and mental health counselors, and social workers.\n\nHow to Become a Psychologist About this section\n\nPsychologists typically need an advanced degree, such as a master’s or doctoral degree, in psychology. Licensing requirements vary by state and position.\n\nEducation\n\nPsychologists typically need at least a master’s degree to enter the occupation. Applicants to graduate-level psychology programs typically have a bachelor's degree in a field such as psychology, education, or social science.\n\nClinical and counseling psychologists typically need a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in psychology or a Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D.) degree. Ph.D. programs usually emphasize research that culminates in a dissertation, while Psy.D. programs focus on applying psychological principles to working with clients or patients. As part of either program, students are typically required to complete an internship.\n\nIndustrial–organizational psychologists typically need a master’s degree. Programs for these psychologists usually include courses in statistics, research design, and topics specific to understanding the relationships between people and workplaces.\n\nSchool psychologists typically need at least a master’s degree in school psychology. Other degrees for school psychologists include education specialist (Ed.S.) and doctoral (Ph.D. or Psy.D.) degrees. School psychologist programs include coursework in education and psychology to address both of these components in students’ development. These programs also usually require completion of an internship.\n\nTraining\n\nMost psychologists need supervised experience to qualify for licensure, which may include an internship or postdoctoral training. These experiences provide an opportunity for prospective psychologists to use their knowledge in an applied setting. The required number of hours for internships varies by state.\n\nLicenses, Certifications, and Registrations\n\nMost states require licensure for those who provide psychology services or use the title “psychologist.” All states and the District of Columbia require that psychologists who practice independently be licensed where they work. Licensing laws vary by state and by type of position. For more information, contact your state’s licensing board.\n\nClinical and counseling psychologists are licensed in every state. School psychologists also typically need a credential, such as a license or certification from their state’s board of education. Licensure typically requires applicants to have earned a master’s or doctoral degree and completed supervised experience. They also may need to have passed the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP) administered by the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB).\n\nAll states require psychologists to complete continuing education to maintain licensure. For more information about specific state requirements, visit the ASPPB.\n\nCertification, which may be optional or may be required by employers, is available from professional associations. For example, the American Board of Professional Psychology offers certification in areas such as clinical health psychology, couple and family psychology, and rehabilitation psychology. The American Board of Clinical Neuropsychology offers certification in neuropsychology. Board certification typically requires candidates to have a doctoral degree and pass an examination.\n\nImportant Qualities\n\nAnalytical skills. Psychologists examine the information they collect and draw logical conclusions.\n\nCommunication skills. Psychologists spend much of their time speaking with people, writing reports, and describing their research. They must be able to convey ideas both orally and in writing.\n\nCompassion. Psychologists often work with people who are dealing with stressful and difficult situations, so they must empathize with their clients.\n\nIntegrity. Psychologists need to keep client discussions confidential. Clients must be able to trust psychologists’ expertise in treating sensitive issues.\n\nInterpersonal skills. Psychologists must be able to build a rapport with clients and work well with a variety of specialists.\n\nObservational skills. Psychologists study individuals and groups to understand their interactions. For example, they may observe facial expressions and other body language for clues about their clients’ attitudes and behaviors.\n\nPatience. Psychologists must be able to remain calm when working with all types of clients, including those who may be distressed.\n\nProblem-solving skills. Psychologists collect information, design research, evaluate programs, and find treatments or solutions to mental and behavioral problems.\n\nJob Outlook About this section\n\nPsychologists\n\nPercent change in employment, projected 2022-32\n\nPsychologists\n\n6%\n\nSocial scientists and related workers\n\n5%\n\nTotal, all occupations\n\n3%\n\nOverall employment of psychologists is projected to grow 6 percent from 2022 to 2032, faster than the average for all occupations.\n\nAbout 12,800 openings for psychologists are projected each year, on average, over the decade.
