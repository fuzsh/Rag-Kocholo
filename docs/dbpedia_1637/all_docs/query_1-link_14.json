        "text": "Definition/Introduction\n\nLoading doses are a means to quicks achieve therapeutic drug concentrations or prompt an immediate clinical response. Loading doses are larger than maintenance doses and are usually administered as a single bolus, although some drugs (eg, amiodarone or digoxin) may require multiple loading doses administered over several hours to days.[1] An intravenous loading dose of phenytoin, on the other hand, should be administered as a single dose. Medications with shorter half-lives (eg, heparin for treating pulmonary embolism) may also require a loading dose to achieve their therapeutic effect immediately.\n\nIn medicine, the treatment for most conditions uses various pharmacological medications. For each of these individual medications, the route of administration, appropriate dosage, and frequency of use are determined by the medication’s pharmacokinetics (PK). Pharmacokinetics is the relationship between an administered dose of a drug and its measured concentration within the body. An individual medication’s PK is governed by how it moves within the body through absorption, bioavailability, distribution, metabolism, and excretion.\n\nThe characteristics that define an individual medication’s PK can help determine the loading dose. While a patient takes a specific drug to achieve the therapeutic benefit, the drug must reach a certain steady-state concentration.[2] Typically, for any medication, five to seven half-lives are required for this to be achieved.\n\nReaching this concentration is typically not an issue for drugs with short half-lives; however, other medications or conditions may require a more rapid therapeutic onset. For instances where a therapeutic steady-state concentration is needed immediately, loading doses can be utilized to achieve this therapeutic concentration more rapidly.[2]\n\nA loading dose is typically calculated through the following formula:\n\nLD=(Volume of Distribution X Steady State Concentration)/(Bioavailability X Drug Fraction of Salt Form that is Active Drug)\n\nFor this formula, concentration steady-state is defined as the therapeutic concentration of medication in the body, while bioavailability is the fraction of an administered dose that reaches systemic circulation. For intravenous drugs, the bioavailability = 1 because the drug is injected directly into the bloodstream. For orally administered drugs, the bioavailability will be affected by several factors, including first-pass metabolism, absorption, etc). The volume of distribution is typically calculated as follows:\n\nVd=Dose of Medication Given/Concentration in the Plasma\n\nThe calculation of the loading dose should not be confused with the maintenance dose, which is the dose required to maintain steady-state concentration. This calculation is:\n\nMD=(Concentration Steady State X Clearance X Dosing Interval)/Bioavailability\n\nClearance can be determined using the known half-life of a medication, which is the time required for a dose to reach 50% of its initial plasma concentration. Clearance can ultimately be determined through the following:\n\nCL=(0.693 X Vd)/ Half-life\n\nIssues of Concern\n\nWhen prescribing a loading dose of a new medication, there are many factors that a clinician must consider. Through the formulas above, the loading dose of any drug is influenced by many of the pharmacokinetic variables. Loading doses are challenging to calculate, as they necessitate multistep calculations utilizing patient data (such as weight) and the specific drug (eg, the estimated volume of distribution or drug half-life). Staff may mistakenly continue loading doses instead of lowering to maintenance doses, particularly when patients transfer between care settings (such as from the emergency department to being admitted to the floor or at discharge from the hospital back to outpatient status).\n\nBioavailability is typically affected by the route of administration of the medication. Each medication typically has a route of administration that provides the best bioavailability. For example, in one study, researchers found that sublingual administration of misoprostol had significantly higher bioavailability than oral administration.[3]\n\nHigher bioavailability allows for the utilization of a lower loading dose to reach the same steady-state concentration, leading to better medication safety and efficacy. Patient comorbidities can also affect medication bioavailability. For example, celiac disease causes atrophy of the duodenal villi, which can hinder the absorption and bioavailability of medications given orally. As a result, other drugs have been developed to allow proper treatment for these patients, such as a medication to increase iron absorption in patients with celiac disease and iron deficiency anemia.[4]\n\nFurther, various physiological factors can affect the concentration and pharmacokinetics of medication. One study found that the clearance of ciprofloxacin significantly decreases with age and worsening kidney function.[5] Failure to adjust for these factors could lead to toxicity or other related side effects. Ultimately, it is essential to consider all factors while dosing medications, as any change in these variables, will inevitably affect the loading dose and, consequently, steady-state concentration."
