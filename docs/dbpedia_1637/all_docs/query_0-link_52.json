Nonetheless, HIV-infected patients (HIV-pts) remain at an increased risk of hematologic malignancies for which HSCT is standard therapy. While HAART enables HIV-pts to undergo autologous HSCT with comparable results to the general population, the outcome of HIV-pts after allogeneic (allo-) HSCT remains largely unknown, with limited case reports and small series. Here, we present an updated report of the experience of allo-HSCT for hematologic indications in HIV-pts reported to the EBMT Registry.\n\nMethods: This is a retrospective study of HIV-pts receiving a first allo-HSCT from 1997 to 2018. HIV-pts’ outcomes were compared with HIV-negative controls (HIV-neg), including a 1:3 case-control matched analysis for the following criteria: diagnosis, disease status, year and age at transplant (both +/− 3 years), gender, previous autologous transplant, donor type, cell source, conditioning regimen (myeloablative vs reduced intensity, TBI vs chemotherapy-based) and ex-vivo manipulation.\n\nResults: We identified 144 HIV-pts who received a first allo-HSCT: AML (n = 59, 41%), CLPD (n = 30, 21%), MDS (n = 21, 15%), ALL (n = 20, 14%), SAA (n = 6, 4%), and others (n = 8, 5%); 96 men (67%), median age 42 (0-69), including 19 pediatric/adolescent cases ≤18 years; matched (72, 50%) and mismatched (15, 10%) related, unrelated (50, 35%) and cord-blood (7, 5%) donors/source; 76 myeloablative conditioning (53%; 35 TBI-based); 10 (7%) with ex vivo TCD; 13 (9%) with a prior autologous transplant. Beyond the matching criteria, cases and controls were also balanced for donor gender and gender mismatch, in vivo TCD and Karnofsky’s performance status. Compared to HIV-neg, HIV-pts had lower rates of neutrophil engraftment (92% vs 98%, p = 0.002), higher incidence of grade III-IV acute GVHD (18% vs 10%, p = 0.007), higher NRM at day 100 (13% vs 7%, p = 0.022) and 2 years (32% vs 20%, p = 0.001), and similar incidence of relapse (28% vs 24%, n.s.). Overall, HIV-pts had poorer PFS (40% vs 56%; p < 0.001, HR=1.80 [1.34-2.41]), GRFS (31% vs 46%; p = 0.002, HR=1.54 [1.17-2.03]) and OS (48% vs 61%; p = 0.001; HR=1.68 [1.23-2.28]) at 2 years than HIV-neg cases. Outcomes within HIV-pts were comparable across different donor types, stem cell sources or intensity of conditioning regimen (data not shown). Of note, the use of unrelated donors in HIV-pts (40%) remains markedly reduced compared to allo-HSCT standard practice (51%; Passweg, et al. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41409-019-0465-9).\n\nConclusions: This study reports on the largest series available of allo-HSCT in HIV-pts. Despite the limitations of any retrospective study, the pair-matched design strongly suggests that the outcome of allo-HSCT is poorer in HIV-pts than in the general population, primarily driven by higher NRM, in association with higher severe GVHD, and in keeping with their reduced overall life expectancy despite HAART. Even so, allo-HSCT is feasible in HIV-pts with hematologic indications, with a 48% OS at 2 years. HIV-pts with an indication for allo-HSCT should be considered for the procedure, including those without matched-related donors, who should be granted access to alternative donor search and consideration for transplantation at the same level as HIV-neg candidates.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to declare.\n\nO011. Comparable Outcomes of AML Patients Receiving Haplo-HCT with Thiotepa/Busulfan/Fludarabine Conditioning and Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide Versus a Matched Unrelated Donor with Fludarabine/Busulfan Conditioning, Regardless of Disease Status\n\nAli Bazarbachi 1, Myriam Labopin2, Didier Blaise3, Edouard Forcade4, Gerard Socié5, Ana Berceanu6, Claude Eric Bulabois7, Nicolaus Kröger8, Alessandro Rambaldi9, Patrice Ceballos10, Stephan Mielke11, Ibrahim Yakoub-Agha12, Bipin Savani13, Alexandros Spyridonidis14, Arnon Nagler15, Mohamad Mohty16\n\n1 American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon, 2 EBMT Paris Study Office, CEREST-TC, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France, 3 Paoli-Calmettes Institute, Inserm CBT1409, Marseille, France, 4 CHU Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France, 5 Hopital St. Louis, Paris, France, 6 Hopital Jean Minjoz, Besancon, France, 7 CHU Grenoble Alpes - Université Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France, 8 University Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany, 9 ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy, 10 CHU Lapeyronie, Montpellier, France, 11 Karolinska Intitutet and University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, 12 CHU de Lille, LIRIC, INSERM U995, Université de Lille, Lille, France, 13 Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, United States, 14 University Hospital of Patras, BMT Unit, Patras, Greece, 15 Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel-hosmer, Israel, 16 EBMT Paris Study Office, CEREST-TC, Saint Antoine Hospital, INSERM UMR 938, Université Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France\n\nBackground: While a HLA matched sibling donor (MSD) represents the first choice for allogeneic hematopoeitic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), most patients do not have a MSD and hence alternative donor sources are used, most frequently matched unrelated donors (MUD) or haploidentical donors (haplo). Multiple studies compared outcomes of MUD and haplo but included patients from different risk groups and with heterogeneous conditioning regimens.\n\nMethods: Here we compared transplant outcomes at EBMT participating centers between 2010 and 2018, of 708 AML patients receiving haploHCT using a homogeneous thiotepa/busulfan/fludarabine conditioning with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (haplo-TBF), to 2083 patients receiving MUD (10/10) using a homogeneous fludarabine/busulfan conditioning and in vivo T-cell depletion (MUD-FB), both being among the most popular regimens in these respective settings. All analyses were stratified according to disease status and cytogenetic risk group for patients transplanted in first complete remission (CR1).\n\nResults: Patients, donors and transplant characteristics are summarized in Table 1. For patients with intermediate cytogenetic risk AML transplanted in CR1 (234 haplo-TBF and 1124 MUD-FB), multivariate analysis (MVA) using the Cox regression method revealed that haplo-TBF significantly increased non-relapse mortality (NRM) (HR 2.1; p = 0.0006) but did not affect relapse incidence (RI), leukemia free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS) or graft- versus-host disease free, relapse free survival (GRFS). Older age negatively affected NRM, LFS, OS and GRFS whereas transplant outcomes were not affected by patient and donor gender or CMV positivity, year of transplant, time from diagnosis to transplant, Karnofsky score, stem cell source, or intensity of conditioning. For patients with high cytogenetic risk AML transplanted in CR1 (79 haplo-TBF and 280 MUD-FB), MVA showed that haplo-TBF significantly increased NRM (HR=2.7; p = 0.02), decreased RI (HR=0.45; p = 0.03) but had no influence on LFS, OS or GRFS. Again, transplant outcomes were not affected by other patient, donor and transplant characteristics, except lower OS in older patients. For patients with AML transplanted in CR2 (165 haplo-TBF and 440 MUD-FB), haplo-TBF significantly increased NRM (HR=2.36; p = 0.008), decreased RI (HR=0.38; p = 0.005), but had no influence on LFS, OS or GRFS. Patient age negatively affected NRM and OS whereas a shorter time from diagnosis to transplant negatively affected RI, LFS, OS and GRFS. Transplant outcomes were not affected by other patient, donor and transplant characteristics. Finally, for patients with AML transplanted with active disease (230 haplo-TBF and 239 MUD-FB), haplo-TBF had no influence on transplant outcomes. Older patient age negatively affected NRM and poor performance status negatively affected all transplant outcomes. Other patient, donor and transplant characteristics had no effect on outcomes.\n\nConclusions: Compared to MUD-FB, haplo-TBF increased NRM, reduced RI in high risk AML, resulting in similar LFS, OS and GRFS. These results support the use of either a matched unrelated donor or a haplo-identical family donor for AML patients lacking a MSD, regardless of disease status at transplant.\n\nClinical Trial Registry: not applicable.\n\nDisclosure: no disclosures.\n\nO012. Trends and Predictive Factors for Outcome of Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia After Allogeneic Hematopoeitic Cell Transplant: Improved Survival for Young Patients in Recent Years\n\nAli Bazarbachi 1, Myriam Labopin2, Dietrich Beelen3, Igor Wolfgang Blau4, Victoria Potter5, Riitta Niittyvuopio6, Gerard Socié7, Didier Blaise7, Jaime Sanz8, Fabio Ciceri9, Alexandros Spyridonidis10, Gesine Bug11, Jordi Esteve12, Bipin N Savani13, Christoph Schmid14, Arnon Nagler15, Mohamad Mohty16\n\n1 American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon, 2 EBMT Paris Study Office, CEREST-TC, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France, 3 University Hospital, Essen, Germany, 4 Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany, 5 GKT School of Medicine, London, United Kingdom, 6 HUCH Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland, 7 Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France, 8 University Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain, 9 Ospedale San Raffaele s.r.l., Milano, Italy, 10 University Hospital of Patras, Patras, Greece, 11 Goethe-Universitaet, Frankfurt Main, Germany, 12 Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain, 13 Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, United States, 14 Klinikum Augsburg, II Medizinische Klinik, Ausburg, Germany, 15 Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-hosmer, Israel, 16 EBMT Paris Study Office, CEREST-TC, Saint Antoine Hospital, INSERM UMR 938, Université Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France\n\nBackground: Disease relapse represents the main cause of treatment failure after allogeneic hematopoietic-cell-transplantation (allo-HCT) for acute-myeloid-leukemia (AML). Standard treatment modalities include reduction/withdrawal of immunosuppression, chemotherapy or hypomethylating agents with or without donor lymphocyte infusion, a second allo-HCT or even palliative care. More recently, multiple targeted therapies were introduced in that setting. However, little information is available about the global impact of the current standard of care for relapsed AML after allo-HCT and about the predictive factors for outcome.\n\nMethods: Here we compared transplant outcomes at EBMT participating centers of 8162 adult AML patients who relapsed between 2000 and 2018 after allo-HCT performed in first complete remission (CR1). We included patients who received transplants from matched sibling or unrelated donors or haploidentical donors. Patients receiving in vitro T cell depletion were excluded. All outcomes were censored at 2 years after relapse. Median follow up for alive patients was 35 months.\n\nResults: Patients, donors and transplant characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Overall, 692 patients relapsed between 2000-2004, 1734 between 2005-2009, 2856 between 2010-2014 and 2878 between 2015-2018. The 2-year overall survival after relapse was 17%. Original disease was the cause of death in 77% of patients. A second allo-HCT within 2 years after relapse was performed in 17% of patients resulting in a 2-year OS of 37%. For 3630 patients less than 50 years of age at relapse, the 2-year OS after relapse increased from 16% for patients relapsing between 2000-2004 to 18% for 2005-2009, 21% for 2010-2014 and 26% for 2015-2018 (p = 0.001). The incidence of second allo-HCT was 23%, 20%, 22% and 32% for the same time periods (p = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, OS from relapse was positively affected by the year of relapse after 2010 compared to 2000-2004 (HR 0.82; p< 0.02 for patients relapsing from 2010-2014 and HR=0.72; p = 0.0002 for patients relapsing from 2015-2018), good performance status at transplant and longer time from transplant to relapse but negatively affected by patient age and intermediate or high cytogenetic risk group. Other patient, donor and transplant characteristics had no significant effect. Conversely, for 4532 patients > 50 year-old at relapse, the 2-year OS from relapse was not affected by the year of relapse (16% for 2000-2004; 15% for 2005-2009 and 2010-2014 and 14% for 2015-2018; p = 0.56) whereas the incidence of second allo-HCT surprisingly decreased from 17% for 2000-2004 to 14% in 2005-2009; 11% in 2010-2014 and 13% in 2015-2018 (p = 0.006). In multivariate analysis, OS from relapse was positively affected by the time from transplant to relapse, good performance status and transplant from matched sibling donor while negatively affected by patient age and adverse cytogenetic risk group. Other patient, donor and transplant characteristics had no effect including the year of relapse.\n\nConclusions: We demonstrate a significant improvement of OS from relapse after 2010 for younger patients, which was more pronounced after 2015. These results likely reflect the efficacy of post-transplant salvage including second allo-HCT. The 2-year OS of 37% after a second transplant probably supports to reconsider this approach in a subset of relapsed patients.\n\nClinical Trial Registry: not applicable.\n\nDisclosure: no disclosures.\n\nO013. Anti-cd3/cd33 Bispecific Antibodies Efficiently Redirect Donor T Cells Against HLA Loss Leukemia Relapses\n\nPier Edoardo Rovatti 1, Laura Zito1, Eleonora Draghi1, Monika Herrmann2, Anetta Marcinek1,2, Bettina Brauchle2, Cesare Covino1, Mattia Di Bono1, Matteo Giovanni Carrabba1, Massimo Bernardi1, Karl-Peter Hopfner2, Cristina Toffalori1, Fabio Ciceri1, Marion Subklewe2, Luca Vago1\n\n1 IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy, 2 Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, Munich, Germany\n\nBackground: Genomic loss of mismatched HLAs (\"HLA loss\") represents a frequent modality by which acute myeloid leukemia (AML) evades immune recognition from donor T cells after partially HLA-incompatible allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Here, we tested the ability of an anti-CD3/CD33 bispecific antibody (BsAb) to circumvent the loss of T cell receptor-HLA interactions and re-target donor T cells towards HLA loss relapses.\n\nMethods: T cells purified from healthy donors were co-cultured with primary patient blasts with or without addition of BsAb and surface expression of early T cell activation markers (CD25 and CD69) was evaluated after 72 hours.\n\nWe established mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLCs) between T cells purified from three patients after allo-HCT and primary AML blasts obtained from the same patients at time of diagnosis. After sequential stimulations, co-cultures were tested against respective patient leukemia at diagnosis and at relapse, measuring T cell degranulation (as CD107a expression), antigen-specific activation (as CD137/41-BB expression) and target-specific cytotoxicity (by live cell imaging over a 48-hour time span) in the presence or absence of BsAb.\n\nFor in vivo experiments, primary HLA loss samples were infused intravenously into non-irradiated NSG mice, followed by intravenous infusion of T cells and daily administration of BsAb.\n\nResults: First, we reviewed immunophenotypic data of 36 HLA loss relapses documented at our Institution over the last 15 years, verifying robust surface expression of CD33 on relapsed leukemia in 97% of them.\n\nBy short-term co-culture experiments between healthy donor T cells and allogeneic leukemia we titrated BsAb concentration and effector:target ratio to be used for subsequent experiments.\n\nT cells collected from patients after HCT robustly responded against patient leukemia at time of diagnosis in terms of degranulation (71,6% mean CD8+CD107+ population). As expected, when tested against HLA loss relapses, T cells failed to recognize target cells (5,9% mean CD8+CD107+ population). Noticeably, when BsAb was added, we detected a strong response, indicating that T cells were effectively re-targeted towards HLA loss variants (84,6% mean CD8+CD107+ population).\n\nSimilar results were obtained measuring antigen-specific T cell activation and target cell apoptosis by live-cell imaging: consistent with previous assays, donor T cells recognized and killed leukemia at diagnosis (45% of detection area positive for apoptosis dye) and failed to recognize its HLA loss relapse counterpart (32% of area positive for apoptosis dye). Addition of BsAb to co-cultures drove dramatic cell death of HLA loss blasts (80% of area positive for apoptosis dye), demonstrating that BsAb also, and most importantly, induced target cell killing.\n\nFinally, we modelled BsAb activity in vivo, showing that, whereas the sole infusion of T cells is not able to prevent the leukemia outgrowth in the bone marrow of NSG mice, addition of the BsAb leads to significant disease reduction.\n\nConclusions: Our results demonstrate that anti-CD3/CD33 BsAbs can effectively redirect donor T cells against HLA loss leukemia variants, resulting in their rapid and effective killing. Taken together, these promising findings strongly support translation of this approach to clinical trials, to provide a rational therapy for this increasingly recognized but still treatment-orphan modality of post-transplantation relapse.\n\nDisclosure: Fabio, Ciceri: San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-TIGET).

Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) Emerges as a Key Driver of HLA Class II Negative Post-Transplantation Relapse\n\nValentina Gambacorta 1,2, Daniela Gnani1, Laura Zito1, Stefano Beretta3, Lucia Zanotti1, Giacomo Oliveira1, Davide Cittaro1, Ivan Merelli3, Fabio Ciceri1, Raffaella Di Micco1, Luca Vago1\n\n1 IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy, Milano, Italy, 2 San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-TIGET), IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy, 2 Milano-Bicocca University, Milano, Italy, 3 Institute for Biomedical Technologies, National Research Council, Segrate, Milano, Italy,\n\nBackground: Evasion from immune control represents one of the main drivers of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse after allogeneic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Recently, we and others (Toffalori et al, Nat Med, 2019; Christopher et al, N Engl J Med, 2018) reported that up to 40% of AML relapses display loss of surface expression of HLA class II not explained by genomic alterations. Here, we aim to decipher epigenetic alterations responsible for this immune escape modality.\n\nMethods: We generated patient derived xenografts (PDXs) from diagnosis and relapse samples with non-genomic loss of HLA class II expression and verified that they faithfully recapitulated the original immune-related differences between diagnosis and relapse. Primary and PDX samples were then characterized for gene expression (by RNA-seq), DNA methylation (by RRBS), and chromatin accessibility (by ATAC-seq). All the data were integrated by multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA), followed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Finally, the immunological effects of epigenetic drugs and recombinant cytokines on primary and PDX-derived AML cells were tested in ex-vivo short-term cultures on a layer of mesenchymal stromal cells.\n\nResults: We verified that PDXs faithfully recapitulate immune-related differences between diagnosis and post-transplantation relapse, including loss of expression of HLA class II molecules. Separate analysis of each of the omics and their integration by MOFA concordantly evidenced that the relapse-specific features were mainly explained by decreased chromatin accessibility in immune-related genes, with a very limited role of DNA methylation. GSEA highlighted that chromatin changes overlapped with known target of EZH2, the enzymatic subunit of the polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2), and that this epigenetic signature was shared by a number of patients at relapse. Consistently, we evidenced closed chromatin status at HLA class II genes and their regulators in relapse samples. To revert these changes, relapse samples with downregulated expression of HLA class II were tested in ex-vivo with a panel of compounds targeting different subunits of PRC2. PRC2 inhibition reduced the levels of the repressor mark H3K27me3 and increased the surface expression of HLA class II molecules. Notably, these effects were even more pronounced when PRC2 inhibition was combined with IFN-g treatment, recovering leukemia recognition by CD4+ T cells and suggesting synergism between reverting epigenetic changes and cytokines released by immune cells upon target recognition.\n\nConclusions: Our results provide mechanistic links between epigenetic regulation and immune escape, and pave the way for testing PRC2 inhibition as an innovative strategy for the treatment of AML post-transplantation relapses.\n\nClinical Trial Registry: None.\n\nDisclosure: No disclosure.\n\nO015.

IKZF1 gene defects may be detected in up to 50% of BCP-ALL in adults and are associated with inferior outcome. The goal of this retrospective study based on EBMT registry was to evaluate outcome of allo-HCT in this population and to identify prognostic factors.\n\nMethods: This was a retrospective study based on EBMT registry. Adult patients with ALL harboring IKZF-1 gene mutations, treated with first allo-HCT between 2015 and 2018 were eligible.\n\nResults: Ninety-five patients transplanted in first (n = 75) or second (n = 20) complete remission (CR) from either HLA-matched sibling (n = 32), unrelated (n = 47) or haploidentical (n = 16) donor, were included in the analysis. Median recipient age was 41 years. Forty-six (48%) patients had Ph(+) ALL. Status of minimal residual disease (MRD) prior to transplantation was reported as positive (n = 42), negative (n = 38) or unknown (n = 15).\n\nThe probabilities of the overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 2 years were 55% and 47%, respectively. Relapse incidence was 32% while non-relapse mortality (NRM), 21%. The incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD and chronic GVHD was 34% and 30%, respectively. The probability of GVHD and relapse-free survival (GRFS) was 35%.\n\nIn a univariate analysis the probability of LFS at two years was 71% for patients in molecular remission compared to 23% for those with detectable MRD (p = 0.002), while OS rates were 75% and 40%, respectively (p = 0.02). Relapse incidence at two years according to MRD status equaled 12% vs. 55%, respectively (p = 0.002). Both LFS and OS rates were higher for patients transplanted in CR1 than CR2 (53% vs. 27%, p = 0.003 and 61% vs. 37%, p = 0.02, respectively). LFS rates were comparable for patients with Ph(+) and Ph(-) ALL (55% vs. 41%, p = 0.51).\n\nMultivariate analysis was restricted to 80 patients with known MRD status at allo-HCT. MRD-positive status was associated with decreased chance of LFS (HR=3.15, p = 0.004) and OS (HR=2.37, p = 0.049) as well as increased risk of relapse (HR=5.87, p = 0.003). Disease stage (CR2 vs. CR1) affected all, LFS (p = 0.0003), OS (p = 0.003), GRFS (p = 0.007), the risk of relapse (p = 0.02) and NRM (p = 0.003). In addition, the risk of NRM was decreased with increasing year of transplantation (p = 0.005).\n\nConclusions: Patients with BCP-ALL and IKZF1 mutation may benefit from allo-HCT performed in CR1. Results of allo-HCT are enhancing provided that MRD negative status is achieved. Patients with detectable MRD have poor prognosis and therefore require additional intervention prior to transplantation.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to declare.\n\nO016. The Value of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia with and without ASXL1-, RUNX1- and TP53 Mutations\n\nKatharina Heidrich 1, Jan Moritz Middeke1, Kerstin Schäfer-Eckart2, Walter E Aulitzky3, Hermann Einsele4, Carsten Müller-Tidow5, Wolf Rösler6, Mathias Hänel7, Claudia D Baldus8, Lars Fransecky8, Friedrich Stölzel1, Christoph Röllig1, Franziska Taube1, Michael Kramer1, Sebastian Stasik1, Andreas Neubauer9, Andreas Burchert9, Wolfgang E Berdel10, Matthias Stelljes10, Gesine Bug11, Gerhard Ehninger1, Martin Bornhäuser1,12, Christian Thiede1, Johannes Schetelig1\n\n1 Universitätsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany, 2 Klinikum Nürnberg, Nürnberg, Germany, 3 Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus, Stuttgart, Germany, 4 Universitätsklinikum Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany, 5 Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany, 6 Universitätsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany, 7 Klinikum Chemnitz, Chemnitz, Germany, 8 Universitätsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany, 9 Universitätsklinikum Marburg, Marburg, Germany, 10 University Hospital Muenster, Münster, Germany, 11 Medizinische Klinik 2, Universitätsklinikum Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany, 12 National Center for Tumor Diseases, Dresden, Germany\n\nBackground: The ELN guidelines propose risk-adapted consolidation strategies for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with recurrent mutations, e.g. RUNX1, ASXL1 and TP53. The latter were introduced as high-risk mutations into the 2017 revision of the ELN classification. So far, no data has been published whether patients who are only classified as high risk based on mutations in RUNX1, ASXL1 and TP53, benefit from consolidation with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT).\n\nMethods: To address this question, we re-analyzed samples of 312 AML patients who had achieved a first complete remission (CR1) and were classified as intermediate risk based on ELN 2017 criteria, with NGS-based targeted sequencing. Patient age ranged between 18-60 years. All patients were treated within randomized controlled trials on intensive induction chemotherapy of the Study Alliance Leukemia (AML96, NCT 00180115; AML 2003, NCT00180102; SORAML, NCT00893373). Altogether 145 patients received alloHCT in CR1 and 75 patients after hematologic relapse. We performed Cox regression models to compare outcomes of patients with and without ASXL1-, RUNX1- and TP53 mutations. To evaluate the effect of alloHCT on OS and RFS, we tested alloHCT as a time-dependent covariate in a multivariable model including age, white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase and AML type (de novo versus secondary versus therapy-related myeloid neoplasia) as adjusting covariates and displayed OS and RFS by means of Simon-Makuch-Plots.\n\nResults: We identified 77 cases of AML with high-risk mutations (35 RUNX1-, 22 ASXL1-, 12 concordant ASXL1- and RUNX1-, and eight TP53-mutant cases of AML). These patients were re-classified as high-risk according to ELN 2017.\n\nAt 5 years from study inclusion, both RFS (38%, 95%CI 28 to 50%, versus 37%, 95%CI 31 to 44%) and OS (47%, 95%CI 37 to 60%, versus 50%, 95%CI 44 to 57%) did not differ significantly between patients with and without high-risk mutations irrespective of postremission treatment.\n\nFor patients with AML and ASXL1-, RUNX1-, or TP53 mutations who received alloHCT in CR1, we observed a statistically significant benefit in terms of RFS (HR 0.4, 95%CI 0.23 to 0.69, p=0.001) and a trend towards better OS (HR 0.56, 95%CI 0.31 to 1.01, p=0.053) compared with postremission chemotherapy. Patients with AML without these high risk mutations also benefited from alloHCT in terms of RFS (HR 0.47, 95%CI 0.33 to 0.66, p=0.001) and showed a trend to better OS (HR 0.73, 95%CI 0.51 to 1.05, p=0.093).\n\nConclusions: Our data supports the recommendation to offer alloHCT as consolidation therapy for fit patients with ELN 2017 intermediate risk and high-risk AML in CR1. Further studies in larger cohorts are warranted to study the effect of ASXL1-, RUNX1-, or TP53 mutations outside the context of high-risk karyotype abnormalities.\n\n[Simon Makuch Plots on relapse free (RFS) and overall survival (OS).]\n\nClinical Trial Registry:\n\nAML96 https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00180115\n\nAML 2003 https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00180102\n\nSORAML https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00893373\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to declare.\n\nO017.

Median age at transplant was 55 years (18-77 years). The KPS score was 80% in 85% of the patients and < 80% in 15% of the patients. Cytogenetic risk was good, intermediate or poor in 6%, 68% and 26% of the patients, respectively. Donor type was sibling (MSD), matched (10/10 UD), mismatched (9/10 UD) unrelated, haploidentical (haplo) or cord blood (CB) in 47%, 35%, 8%, 6% and 4% of patients, respectively. Conditioning was myeloablative (MAC) or reduced-intensity (RIC) in 42% and 58% of patients, respectively. Stem cell source was PBSC or BM in 84% and 14% of the patients, respectively. Non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse incidence (RI) at 2 years were 19% and 27%, respectively. Notably, in the subgroup of patients with KPS < 80% NRM rate was as high as 27% (23-31%). Leukemia-free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS) and GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) rates were 54%, 59% and 41%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, transplant from a MSD was associated with a reduced risk of aGvHD (p < 10−4) and NRM (p < 10−3) as compared to all other donor types. Transplant from 10/10 UD was associated with lower GRFS (HR 1.2, p = 0.03), while 9/10 UD predicted inferior LFS, OS and GRFS (p < 0.001) as compared to MSD. Patients with KPS score of 80% had significantly lower NRM and improved survival as compared to patients with KPS< 80% (NRM: HR 0.6, p < 10-4; OS: HR 0.7, p < 10−4). Notably, administration of ATG was associated with reduced risk of developing grade II-IV aGVHD (p < 10−4), cGVHD (p < 10−4), severe cGVHD (p < 10−4) and with improved GRFS (p < 0.01). In the group of patients with a KPS score of 80%, a RIC regimen was associated with higher RI (p < 0.01), higher incidence of severe cGVHD (p < 0.001), and inferior GRFS (p < 0.001) as compared to MAC. NRM was not significantly different following RIC or MAC in this population. In contrast, in patients with a KPS score < 80%, RIC was associated with lower NRM (p < 0.0001) and better LFS (p < 0.01), OS (p < 0.0001) and GRFS (p < 0.01) as compared to MAC.\n\nConclusions: Allo-SCT is feasible in patients with AML in CR1 and KPS score < 80%, with acceptable NRM and survival rates. As for the conditioning regimen, in patients with a KPS score of 80% a MAC regimen was associated with lower relapse rate, similar NRM and better GRFS as compared to RIC, while in patients with a KPS score lower than 80% RIC was associated with reduced NRM and improved OS as compared to MAC. In addition, transplant from a MSD was associated with reduced risk of NRM and aGVHD rates as compared to other donor types. Finally, administration of ATG correlated with reduced acute and chronic GVHD and improved GRFS.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to declare.\n\nO018. RIC Combined with Anti-Thymocyte Globulin and Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide Provides Higher GVHD-Free/Relapse Free Survival in Fit Young Adults with Acute Myeloid Leukemia\n\nMaria Queralt Salas 1,2, Shiyi Chen2, Wilson Lam1,2, Zeyad Al-Shaibani1,2, Dennis (Dong Hwan) Kim1,2, Fotios V Michelis1,2, Ivan Pasic1,2, Armin Gerbitz1,2, Auro Viswabandya1,2, Jeffrey Howard Lipton1,2, Jonas Mattsson1,2, Arjun D. Law1,2\n\n1 University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada, 2 Princess Margaret Cancer Center, Toronto, Canada\n\nBackground: An ideal conditioning platform should maximize anti-leukemia cytotoxicity and potentiate the graft-versus leukemia effect while minimizing transplant-related toxicity. The selection of the intensity of the conditioning regimen is tailored according to age and comorbidities. However, the optimal age cut-off is not well determined because age is an imprecise determinant of medical fitness. Moreover, with the refinement of HLA-typing, GVHD prophylaxis and supportive care, TRM in patients with comorbidities has decreased.\n\nWe aim to compare the outcome of alloHCT in adults with AML transplanted with RIC combined with dual T-cell depletion using anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) for GVHD prophylaxis with patients transplanted receiving myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens combined with standard GVHD prophylaxis.\n\nMethods: All adults with AML in complete remission who underwent MAC alloHCT (N = 111) between January 2013 to December 2018 were included in the analysis. Those adults younger than 60 years with an HCT-CI score < = 3 who underwent RIC alloHCT in combination with ATG-PTCY-CsA (N = 79) during the defined period of time were included in the analysis. Data was collected retrospectively and updated in July 2019.\n\nA propensity score matching was applied between both cohorts to reduce section bias and approximate a randomized trial. The goal was that both cohorts and matched individual pairs will have well balanced characteristics. Age, CD34 dose, frozen/fresh, disease stage (CR1, CR2-3), donor type and disease risk index (DRI) were entered into the multiple logistics regression (with group membership as the outcome) to create propensity score, which is the predicted probability of receiving RIC. 8à1 digit match technique was performed to find matched pairs.\n\nAll together 55 pairs of patients (N = 110) were finally included in the analysis. Paired t-tests were used to compare continuous variables and McNemar’s tests were used to compare categorical variables, taking into account the correlations between matched pairs. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare two groups in terms of OS, RFS and GRFS, whereas Fine and Gray competing risk models were used to compare outcomes including NRM and CIR.\n\nResults: Figure 1 summarizes baseline characteristics of patients included in the analysis and comparison over the two cohorts after applying the propensity score matching analysis. Results suggest that the two groups were very balanced after matching.\n\nThe cumulative incidence of acute and chronic GVHD was significantly lower in patients who deceived RIC alloHCT with ATG-PTCY-CsA.\n\nPatients who underwent RIC alloHCT combined with ATG-PTCY-CsA had a non-significant trend to better OS (p = 0.08) and RFS (P = 0.07), and a significantly lower NRM (P = 0.002) in comparison with patients who underwent MAC alloHCT. The differences on CIR between both approaches were not statistically significant (p = 0.51). Those patients who underwent RIC alloHCT with ATG-PTCY-CsA had a significantly higher GRFS (P < 0.001).\n\nConclusions: Dual T-cell depletion for GVHD prophylaxis in RIC alloHCT reduces clinically relevant GVHD improving GRFS in AML patients.\n\nBoth strategies provided comparable overall survival and cumulative incidence of relapse. However, RIC alloHSCT resulted in lower NRM in AML patients.\n\nClinical Trial Registry: No applicable.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to declare.\n\nO019. Low-Dose Memory Donor Lymphocyte Infusion After αβ T Cell-Depleted HSCT Among Children with High-Risk Leukemia: Results of a Prospective Randomized Single-Center Trial\n\nZhanna Shekhovtsova 1 , Maria Dunaikina 1 , Larisa Shelikhova 1 , Elena Osipova 1 , Dmitriy Pershin 1 , Dmitriy Balashov 1 , Elena Kurnikova 1 , Alexei Kazachenok 1 , Yakov Muzalevskii 1 , Maria Ilushina 1 , Rimma Khismatullina 1 , Julia Starichkova 1 , Galina Novichkova 1 , Alexei Maschan 1, Michael Maschan 1\n\n1 Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Research Centre of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Москва, Russian Federation\n\nBackground: Depletion of αβ T lymphocytes is an established method of graft manipulation. Delayed recovery of adaptive immunity remains is an unresolved issue. To accelerate the recovery of immunity we proposed to use low doses of donor memory lymphocytes. We have report the results of a prospective randomized trial that tested safety and efficiency of low-dose memory DLI after αβ T cell-depleted HSCT among children with hematologic malignancies.\n\nMethods: A group of 149 patients were enrolled. Indications for HSCT were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 91), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 39), other high-risk malignancies (n = 19). Median age was 8.6 years (0.5-18) and m:f ratio was 1.5:1. Donors were haploidentical family among 137 (91%) cases and matched among 13(9%) cases. Conditioning regimen included either treosulfan at Σ42 g/m2 (n = 65) or total body irradiation at Σ12Gy(n = 84). All patients received thiotepa at Σ10mg/kg, fludarabine at Σ150mg/kg and bortezomib at 1.3mg/m2 on days -5,-2,+2,+5. Anti-thymocyte globulin serotherapy was abandoned. Tocilizumab at 8 mg/kg at day 0 and abatacept at 10 mg/kg at days 0,7,14 and 28 were administered instead. Grafts were derived from G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood and split into two parts. Part I was used to produce the primary graft by αβTCR/19+ depletion. Part II was depleted of CD45RA+ population to produce memory DLI. Patients were randomized at enrollment either to experimental or control arm. Experimental arm (n = 77) were scheduled to receive 25 × 103 CD3+CD45RO+ cells at day 0 and monthly infusions of 50x103 CD3+CD45RO+ on days 30, 60 and 90. Control arm (n = 73) received standard care. The primary endpoints were the cumulative incidence of acute GVHD grade II-IV and the cumulative incidence of CMV viremia.\n\nResults: One patient died due to septic shock before engraftment. A total of 148 patients were evaluable for engraftment at day 30. Engraftment rate was 98%, 97%(control) and 99%(experimental). The cumulative incidence of aGVHD grade II-IV was 14% in total population, 15%(experimental) and 14%(control), p-ns. The incidence of grade III-IV aGVHD was 8% (experimental) and 6%(control), p-ns. The cumulative incidence of CMV viremia was 55% in the control arm and 45% in the experimental arm, Gray’s, p = 0,3. The incidence of chronic GVHD was 6%, 5%(experimental) and 6%(control). The cumulative incidence of relapse was 21%, 22% (experimental) and 20%(control). Non-relapse mortality was 2%, 1% and 3% in the control and experimental arm, respectively. At a median follow-up of 1.5 years the event-free survival for all patients was 77 ± 4% and overall survival was 89 ± 3%. In the experimental arm the EFS and OS were 75% and 91%, while in the control arm EFS and OS were 79% and 87%, p = ns. There was a trend towards faster recovery of CMV-specific immunity in the experimental arm in a subcohort of CMV-seropositive recipients\n\nConclusions: Low-dose CD45RA-depleted DLI commenced at day of grafting were safe but insufficient to prevent CMV viremia. Overall αβ T cell depleted HSCT among children with high-risk leukemia was associated with very low non-relapse mortality, which we ascribe to overall refinement of the regimen, specifically to replacement of polyclonal lymphodepleting serotherapy with targeted immunomodulation\n\nClinical Trial Registry: NCT02942173.\n\nDisclosure: MM recieved lecturer’s fee from Miltenyi Biotec.\n\nO020.

All 149 consecutive first haplo-HCT with PTCy (50mg/kg on D+3 and D+4) reported by the 17 Brazilian participating centers of the Pediatric Working Group transplanted for HM were included.\n\nResults: The median age was 10 (0-18) years and 86 were transplanted for ALL, 58 for AML and 5 for MDS. HCTdonors were father (N=82), mother (N=51), or siblings (N=16). Most patients were in second complete remission (CR2; N=57) and in CR1 (N=38) followed by CR3+ and active/refractory disease (N=27 each). Most received a myeloablative conditioning (87%). In addition to PTCy, all patients received mycophenolate mofetil with either cyclosporine (79%) or tacrolimus (21%) for GVHD prophylaxis. Bone marrow (BM) was the stem cell source in 57%. Median follow up for surviving patients is 16 (5-84) months. Most achieved neutrophil engraftment (96%). Primary and secondary graft failure occurred in 5 and 4 patients respectively, and all received BM grafts. The cumulative incidence (CI) of non-relapse mortality at D+100 was 7.4%. At a median of 170 days after HCT, 38% of patients relapsed. The 1-year PFS was 52%: 70% in CR1, 50% in CR2 and 42% in CR3+ or active disease (p = 0.006). CI of acute GVHD grades II-IV was higher after PB grafts (45%) than after BM grafts (27%), (p = 0.02). CI of chronic GVHD at 1 year was higher after PB grafts from female (75%) than from male (21%) donors, as well as after BM from female (24%) than male donors (13%), both p < 0.001. The risk of cGVHD was higher after PB grafts than after BM grafts from a female donor (Hazards Ratio (HR)3.4; p < 0.01). In a multivariable analysis, risk associated with death were female donor (HR=1.9; p = 0.02) and disease status (p<0.001) and increased risk for cGVHD was the use of PBSC from a female donor (HR=6.9; p<0.001). The 1-year overall survival was 62% (95% CI, 54 to 70). Disease progression was the main cause of death (66%). Early mortality after haplo-HCT with PTCy in children with hematological malignancies was low. The 1-year PFS was above 50% with higher rates for those with lower disease risk. The use of PB grafts from female donors increased the risk of acute and of cGVHD.\n\nConclusions: Our results show that Haplo-HCT with PTCy for children without an HLA-matched donor is an alternative curative intervention for hematological malignancies. A retrospective comparative study of all allogeneic HCT performed in Brazil between 2014 and 2018 and reported to the CIBMTR from HLA matched sibling, unrelated and haploidentical donors is underway. Prospective studies using haploidentical donors with PTCy are necessary to determine if current HCT practices will be changed.\n\nDisclosure: All authors declare no conflict of interest related to this abstract.\n\nO021. Better Leukemia-Free Survival with Allogeneic Than with Autologous HCT in AML Patients with Isolated Trisomy 8: A Study from the ALWP of the EBMT\n\nFrederic Baron 1, Myriam Labopin2, Didier Blaise3, Maija Itälä-Remes4, Gérard Socié5, Edouard Forcade6, Ibrahim Yakoub-Agha7, Norbert Claude Gorin8, Jordi Esteve9, Arnon Nagler10, Mohamad Mohty8\n\n1 University of Liege, Liege, Belgium, 2 EBMT Paris Study Office, Paris, France, 3 Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France, 4 HUCH Comprehensive Cancer Center, Stem Cell, Helsinki, Finland, 5 CHU Saint Louis, Paris, France, 6 CHU Bordeaux, Pessac, France, 7 CHU de Lille, LIRIC, INSERM U995, Lille, France, 8 Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France, 9 Hospital Clínic, Barcelona, Spain, 10 Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Hashomer, Ramat-Gan, Israel\n\nBackground: The indication of performing an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) in patients with isolated trisomy 8 AML in first complete remission (CR) has remained debated. Here we compared outcomes of such patients given either allo-HCT or autologous (auto)-HCT.\n\nMethods: Inclusions criteria consisted of adult patients, de novo AML, isolated trisomy 8, first HCT between 2000 and 2018, CR1 at transplantation, and either auto-HCT or allo-HCT with a HLA-identical sibling donor (MSD) or a 10/10 HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD).\n\nResults: A total of 401 patients met the inclusion criteria. They were given auto-HCT (n = 81), allo-HCT with a MSD (n = 186) or allo-HCT with a MUD (n = 134). Median patient age was 52 years in auto-HCT recipients, 52 years in MSD recipients, and 55 years in MUD recipients. Median time from diagnosis to transplantation was 5.3 months in auto-HCT recipients, 4.5 months in MSD recipients and 5 months in MUD recipients (P = 0.001). At 3-year, nonrelapse mortality, relapse incidence, and leukemia-free survival (LFS) were 5%, 59%, and 37%, respectively, in auto-HCT recipients; 14% (P = 0.04), 31% (p < 0.001), and 55% (p = 0.033), respectively, in MSD recipients and 13% (P = 0.15), 29% (P < 0.001), and 59% (P = 0.03), respectively, in MUD recipients. The 180-day incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD was 22% in MSD versus 35% in MUD (P = 0.01) while 42% of MSD versus 43% of MUD recipients experienced chronic GVHD. In multivariate analysis, in comparison to auto-HCT, each MSD and MUD were associated with a lower risk of relapse (HR = 0.47, P < 0.001 and HR=0.40, P < 0.001, respectively) translating to better LFS (HR=0.69, P = 0.04 and HR = 0.60, P = 0.03, respectively). There was also a similar trend for overall survival (HR=0.73, P=12 and HR=0.65, p = 0.08).\n\nConclusions: In AML patients with isolated trisomy 8, allo-HCT in first CR with either a MSD or a MUD results in better LFS than auto-HCT, due to significantly lower risks of disease relapse.\n\nClinical Trial Registry: NA.\n\nDisclosure: NA.\n\nO032.

Here, we present interim efficacy and safety results from ZUMA-2, the first Phase 2, registrational, multicenter study evaluating KTE-X19 autologous anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy in patients with R/R MCL.\n\nMethods: Eligible patients (≥ 18 years) with R/R MCL, an ECOG of 0 - 1, and ≤ 5 prior therapies (including chemotherapy, an anti-CD20 antibody, and a BTKi) underwent leukapheresis and conditioning chemotherapy followed by KTE-X19 infusion at 2 × 106 cells/kg. Bridging chemotherapy was permitted. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR [complete response (CR) + partial response]), assessed by an Independent Review Committee per Lugano Classification (Cheson, et al. J Clin Oncol. 2014). Interim efficacy endpoints were investigator-assessed using the revised International Working Group Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson, et al. J Clin Oncol. 2007). Key secondary endpoints included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), frequency of adverse events (AEs), and blood levels of CAR T cells. Sixty patients received KTE-X19; here, we present results in patients with ≥1 year of follow-up. Updated results for all 60 patients will be reported in the presentation.\n\nResults: As of May 30, 2018, 28 patients received KTE-X19 with ≥ 1 year of follow-up (median, 13.2 months). The median age was 65 years; 43% of patients had an ECOG score of 1; 21% had blastoid morphology; 82% had stage IV disease; 50% had intermediate/high-risk MIPI; 86% received a median of 4 prior therapies; 57% were refractory to last prior therapy. Eight patients received bridging therapy; all had disease present post-bridging. Investigator-assessed ORR was 86% (95% CI, 67% - 96%), with a CR rate of 57% (95% CI, 37% - 76%); 75% of responders remained in response, and 64% of treated patients had ongoing responses. The 12-month estimates of DOR, PFS, and OS were 83% (95% CI, 60% - 93%), 71% (95% CI, 50% - 84%), 86% (95% CI, 66% - 94%), respectively; medians were not reached. The most common Grade ≥3 AEs were anemia (54%), platelet count decrease (39%), and neutropenia (36%). Grade 3/4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) assessed by Lee et al. (Blood. 2014) and Grade 3/4 neurologic events (NEs) were reported in 18% and 46% of patients, respectively (no Grade 5 CRS or NEs). All CRS events and most NEs (15/17 patients) were reversible. There was 1 Grade 5 AE of organizing pneumonia, considered related to conditioning chemotherapy. Median CAR T cell levels as measured by peak and area under the curve were 99 cells/µL (range, 0.4 - 2589) and 1542 cells/µL (range, 5.5 - 27239), respectively. Peak CAR T cell expansion was observed between Days 8 and 15 and levels declined over time.\n\nConclusions: With ≥1 year of follow-up, KTE-X19 demonstrated significant and durable clinical benefit and a manageable safety profile in patients with R/R MCL for whom there are no curative treatment options.\n\nClinical Trial Registry: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02601313.\n\nDisclosure: MW: stock/ownership- MoreHealth; honoraria- OMI; consult/advisor- Celgene, MoreHealth, Pulse; testimony- AstraZeneca; research- Novartis, Kite/Gilead, Juno/Celgene, Loxo, VelosBio; honoraria+consult/advisor+research- Pharmacyclics, Janssen, AstraZeneca; travel- Janssen, Pharmacyclics, Celgene, OMI.

We present results from the large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) cohort of TRANSCEND NHL 001 (NCT02631044).\n\nMethods: Patients aged ≥18 years had relapsed/refractory diffuse LBCL not otherwise specified (including transformed from any indolent lymphoma), high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, or follicular lymphoma grade 3B after ≥2 lines of therapy, and ECOG PS of 0‒2. Patients with mild/moderate organ dysfunction and secondary CNS lymphoma were eligible. Bridging therapy was allowed with reconfirmed PET-positive disease before lymphodepletion with fludarabine/cyclophosphamide. Liso-cel was given at 1 of 3 dose levels (DLs): 50 × 106 (DL1), 100 × 106 (DL2), or 150 × 106 (DL3) viable CAR+ T cells. DL2 was chosen for dose confirmation. Primary endpoints were treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints were complete response (CR) rate, duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was graded per 2014 Lee criteria. ORR was assessed by independent review per Lugano criteria.\n\nResults: Of 344 patients leukapheresed, 269 received liso-cel (DL1, n = 51; DL2, n = 177; DL3, n = 41). No product could be manufactured for 2 patients, and 25 patients received nonconforming product. In the optimized manufacturing process, median time from leukapheresis to liso-cel availability was 24 days. Median age was 63 years (range, 18‒86 years; ≥65 years, 42%; ≥75 years, 10%). Overall, 26% of patients had ≥4 lines of prior therapy (median, 3; range, 1‒8), 67% were chemorefractory, 44% had never achieved CR, and 59% had bridging therapy. Twenty-five patients received liso-cel as outpatients. Outcomes were similar across DLs, so data were pooled. 79% of pts had grade ≥3 TEAEs, mostly cytopenias (neutropenia, 60%; anemia, 38%; thrombocytopenia, 27%). 47% of pts had CRS and/or neurological events (NEs), with late onset (median, 5 and 9 days, respectively). Incidence of grade ≥3 CRS (2%) and NEs (10%) was low. Four grade 5 liso-cel-related TEAEs occurred (diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary hemorrhage, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and cardiomyopathy). Safety was similar among patient subgroups. All primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were met. Of 256 efficacy-evaluable patients, the ORR was 73% (95% CI, 67‒78) and the CR rate was 53% (95% CI, 47‒59). Responses were similar across patient subgroups (Table). Median DOR was not reached (NR; 95% CI, 8.6‒NR) with 12.0 months of median follow-up; median DOR for patients in CR was NR (95% CI, NR‒NR). Median PFS was 6.8 months (95% CI, 3.3‒14.1). Median OS was 21.1 months (95% CI, 13.3‒NR).\n\nConclusions: Liso-cel showed durable clinical activity with a favorable safety profile across relapsed/refractory LBCL histologic subgroups and in patients with poor prognosis, including chemotherapy refractory, older age, comorbidities, and high tumor burden. Incidence of severe CRS and NEs was low, with late onset, allowing for outpatient administration.\n\nClinical Trial Registry: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02631044.\n\nDisclosure: Funding Statement: This study was funded by Juno Therapeutics, a Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.

CD19/CD22 Dual Targeted (Chimeric Antigen Receptor) CAR-T Therapy for Relapsed or RE Fractory (R/R) B-CELL Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (B-NHL)\n\nHouli Zhao 1,2,3, Yongxian Hu1,2,3, Arnon Nagler4, Alex Hongsheng Chang5, He Huang1,2,3\n\n1 The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, 2 Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy, Hangzhou, China, 3 Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, 4 Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel, Tel Hashomer, Israel, 5 Shanghai YaKe Biotechnology Ltd, Shanghai, Shanghai, China\n\nBackground: Targeted CD19 CAR-T therapy makes great progress in r/r B-NHL with 50% CR. However, another half of patients relapses from a short duration of response or refractory to CAR-T therapy. Antigen escape and heterogeneity of antigen expression are the key mechanisms of anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy failure. A single CAR targeting CD19 and CD22 simultaneously may overcome such obstacles.\n\nMethods: T cells transduced with CD19/CD22 dual targeted CAR lentiviral vectors were infused in patients with R/R B-NHL with CD19 or CD22 positive under fludarabine- and cyclophosphamide-based lymphodepletion. The post-infusion responses, toxicities, and cytokine profiling in enrolled patients were observed and monitored. Cytokine arrays contains 45 different kinds of cytokines related to function of immune cell. Cytokine arrays was performed at the day of CAR-T infusion, day 1-3 after CAR-T infusion, peak of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) according to clinical status and recovery day from CRS.\n\nResults: Baseline characteristics are listed in Table 1. We enrolled 17 patients with r/r B-NHL. The median transduction efficiency of CD19/CD22 CAR-T was 48%. In vitro cytotoxicity assays were conducted and showed prominent anti-lymphoma activities with CD19/CD22 CAR-T. The patients received CD19/CD22 CAR-T infusion at doses of 4.9-9.4×10^6/kg. 11 (64.7%) and 6 (35.3%) patients achieved complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) 1 month after CAR-T infusion. With the median follow-up of 244 days, 1-year overall survival (OS) and 1-year progression free survival (PFS) were estimated at 70.7% and 48.4%, respectively. Among patients who achieved CR 1-year OS and 1-year PFS were estimated at 100% and 83.3% In this trial, all 17 patients experienced CRS. Grade 1, 2, and 3 cytokine release syndrome occurred in 4 (23.5%), 12 (70.6%), and 1 (5.9%) patients respectively. Cytokine arrays showed MIP-3β increase at day 1-3 after CAR-T infusion. CD40 ligand, MIP-1β, GROβ, EGF, PDGF-AB/BB, RANTES, IL-8, TRAIL decrease and PD-L1/B7-H1, MIP-1α, GM-CSF, IL-1ra, IL-3, IL-5, MIP-3β, MCP-1, IP-10 increase were observed at CRS peak. In subgroup analysis, we found patients who achieved CR with lower level of CD40 ligand, FGF basic at day 1-3, and GM-CSF, IP-10 at recovery day than PR patients.\n\nConclusions: CD19/CD22 dual targeted CAR-T is a promising solution for improving response and prolonging PFS for r/r B-NHL patients with less than grade 3 CRS adverse events. Cytokine profiling showed CD40 ligand, MIP-1β, GROβ, EGF, PDGF-AB/BB, RANTES, IL-8, TRAIL decrease and PD-L1/B7-H1, MIP-1α, GM-CSF, IL-1ra, IL-3, IL-5, MIP-3β, MCP-1, IP-10 increase during CRS. MIP-3β may be a biomarker of early phase of CRS. Lower level of CD40 ligand, FGF basic at early phase of CRS and lower level of GM-CSF, IP-10 when recovery from CRS may be related to good response.\n\n[Baseline characteristics]\n\nClinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR1800015575\n\nwww.chictr.org.cn\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to declare.\n\nO035. An Update of the EBMT Survey on CAR T-Cell Activity in Europe.

The main aim was to capture the rapidly growing activity in this field and the impact of the first commercial drug products targeting CD19. We were also interested to identify those academic clinical trials promoted by European institutions and currently open for recruitment.\n\nMethods: A questionnaire was prepared by CTIWP to identify CART centers and CART based activity in Europe. Using monkey-survey, the survey was sent to 559 EBMT-centers. We crosschecked the collected information with data available on the ClinTrialsGov and Eudract websites.\n\nResults: The updated survey is based on May 2019 report. As of this latest time point, 549 patients treated with CAR T-cells were reported in Europe. The number of European centers administering CAR T-cells has nearly doubled in 6 months (from 34 to 56). Only one additional country (from 13 to 14) has started to treat patients with CAR T-cells during this period. There are now many more adult than pediatric patients (71.6% vs 28.4%, respectively). The two most frequent indications for CART treatment were NHL and ALL (46% and 40%, respectively), in line with existing marketing approvals. The third indicationwas MM (6%), a disease for which no approval has yet been granted by EMA. In addition, 39 patients were reported to have received CAR T-cell treatment for CLL, AML, MDS, or solid tumors. Whereas in November 2018, only 9 patients had been treated with marketed CAR T-cells, this figure rose to 90 in May 2019. We have identified at least 42 clinical trials with active recruitment in Europe. Of these, 27 are pharma-sponsored clinical trials, while 15 are academic clinical trials. The great majority of these clinical trials evaluate CAR T-cells targeting CD19 (n = 26) or BCMA (n = 5), with fewer targeting CD20 (n = 1), CD19/22 (n = 1), CD123 (n = 1), or CD33 (n = 1). Focusing specifically on the 15 European academic clinical trials, they evaluate CAR T-cells targeting CD19 (N = 9=, G2D (N = 2), or BCMA, FAP, ErbBR, and ILIRAP (N = 1 each), respectively. Of note, four European institutions fully prepare their own CAR T-cells, manufacturing both the genetic and the cellular product.\n\nConclusions: These results demonstrate that clinical CAR T-cell activity is rapidly growing at European centers. Adult patients with NHL now represent the most frequent indication for treatment, because of commercial availability of approved products in this indication. The use of marketed CAR T-cells has increased by 10-fold within 6 months, but still represents a minority of the ongoing activity. The existence of 15 active European academic clinical trials shows that Europe is not just a “CAR buyer” but also a “CAR manufacturer”. We encourage centers to keep registering patients receiving CAR T-cells, both commercial and investigational, in a timely manner, through the specific Med A Form of the EBMT database. This will be crucial to monitor potential improvements in the procedure over time, similar to the achievements made by EBMT in monitoring patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for more than two decades.\n\nDisclosure: Gunilla Enblad: Member of the Advisory board for Kite/Gilead.\n\nJurgen Kuball: COI: Scientific cofounder and shareholder of gadeta.

Third-generation CAR T Cells within the Heidelberg CAR Trial 1 (HD-CAR-1) Display an Excellent Safety Profile and Might Improve Persistence of CAR T Cells\n\nMaria-Luisa Schubert 1, Anita Schmitt1, Angela Hueckelhoven-Krauss1, Brigitte Neuber1, Alexander Kunz1, Lei Wang1, Birgit Michels1, Ulrike Gern1, Leopold Sellner1, Susanne Hofmann1, Petra Pavel2, Anthony Ho1, Carsten Müller-Tidow1, Peter Dreger1, Michael Schmitt1\n\n1 University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany, 2 German Red Cross Blood Service Baden-Wuerttemberg-Hessen, Heidelberg, Germany\n\nBackground: The investigator-initiated (IIT) phase I/II clinical CAR trial HD-CAR-1 (Heidelberg CAR trial 1; NCT03676504; EudraCT 2016-004808-60) was initiated in September 2018 and treats patient with B cell malignancies with third-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell (CARTs). Leukapheresis and GMP-conform CART manufacturing are performed in-house at the University Hospital Heidelberg.\n\nMethods: Patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and patients with r/r chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or other non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL) or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) are treated with autologous T lymphocytes transduced with a CD19 targeting CAR retroviral vector (RV-SFG.CD19.CD28.4-1BBzeta). Primary endpoints of HD-CAR-1 are safety and feasibility of escalating CART doses (1-20×106 transduced cells/m2) after lymphodepletion with fludarabine (30 mg/m2/d; days -4 to -2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2/d; days -4 to -2). Patients are monitored for cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) and/or other toxicities. In vivo function, survival and anti-tumor efficacy of CARTs are assessed as HD-CAR-1 secondary endpoints.\n\nResults: To date, 17 patients (8 adult ALL, 2 CLL, 2 MCL, 4 DLBCL (1 transformed from FL), 1 FL) have been enrolled and 15 patients subjected to leukapheresis (2 patients awaiting leukapheresis). CAR products have been manufactured for 14 patients, 1 manufacturing is in process. Mean transduction efficiency of T lymphocytes was 44% (range 19%-61%) and high numbers of CARTs were harvested (52-191 × 106 CAR T cells). With regards to subpopulations of CART products, 43% of CARTs were CD8+ and 52% CD4+. The highest proportion of cells (35%) consisted of naïve (CD45RA+ CCR7+) and effector (31%; CD45RA+ CCR7-) CARTs. Twelve patients (4 ALL, 2 CLL, 2 MCL, 4 DLBCL) have received CARTs (6 patients: 106 transduced CAR T cells/m2; 4 patients 5 × 106 CAR T cells/m2; 2 patient 20 × 106 CAR T cells/m2); 2 patient are awaiting CART administration. 9 patients have reached end-of-study (EOS) on day 90. No signs of CRS or ICANS > grade 2 have been observed. No neurological side-effects occurred, even not in patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement. As per quantitative real-time PCR, CARTs were detectable in the peripheral blood (PB) of 10 of 11 analyzed patients. In one ALL patient with CNS involvement, CARTs were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CART frequency reached up to 200.000 copies/µg DNA, in some patients CARTs were detectable beyond EOS. Clinical responses were achieved in 6 of 9 (66%) treated patients (2 CRs, 4 PRs, 3 PDs); 3 patients are not yet available for response).\n\nConclusions: HD-CAR-1 is the first academic CAR T cell trial in Germany with in-house leukapheresis, CART manufacturing and administration. CART production was feasible for all enrolled patients so far. Patients responded clinically to treatment despite low numbers of administered CARTs. CARTs displayed a highly favorable safety profile, migrated into different compartments and were partly detectable for more than 3 months following administration. HD-CAR-1 accounts for clinical evaluation of third-generation CARTs that might contribute to long-term CART persistence, hence improving responses in treated patients.\n\nClinical Trial Registry: EudraCT 2016-004808-60; NCT03676504 (clinicaltrials.gov).\n\nDisclosure: Schmitt: Therakos Mallinckrodt: Other: Financial Support.

Infusion and management of CAR T cell therapy in the outpatient setting may lead to wider use in nonuniversity centers and improved access. We report on patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) treated with lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) in the outpatient setting in TRANSCEND NHL 001 (NCT02631044) and 2 phase 2 studies (≥3rd-line therapy: OUTREACH [NCT03744676]; 2nd-line transplant noneligible: PILOT [NCT03483103]).\n\nMethods: Eligible patients had relapsed/refractory large B-cell NHL (TRANSCEND/OUTREACH: ≥2 lines of prior therapy and ECOG PS ≤1; PILOT: 1 line of prior therapy and deemed TNE for autologous HSCT based on age, ECOG PS, or organ function). After lymphodepletion with fludarabine/cyclophosphamide, liso-cel was administered. All studies allowed outpatient treatment at nonuniversity (OUTREACH) or university and nonuniversity medical centers (TRANSCEND/PILOT), with hospitalization at the first sign of fever or neurological events (NEs) per management guidelines.\n\nResults: At data cutoff, 44 patients across studies received liso-cel on study Day 1 and were monitored as outpatients, including patients ≥65 years of age (n = 18) and those with SPD ≥50 cm2 (n = 12) or LDH ≥500 U/L (n = 6). Results are shown in the Table. Seventeen patients had any-grade cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and 13 had any-grade NEs (20 had CRS and/or NEs). Only 2 patients had grade 3/4 CRS or NEs, which were reversible. Three patients received tocilizumab and corticosteroids for CRS (none received tocilizumab alone; 2 received corticosteroids only). Five patients received corticosteroids for NEs. Overall, 55% of patients (n = 24/44; all from TRANSCEND or OUTREACH) required hospitalization at any time. Of 44 patients, 9 (20%) were admitted on study Day 4 or earlier (for CRS and/or NE) and 2 (5%) required ICU-level care (median length of stay, 4 days). Median time to initial hospitalization after liso-cel infusion was 5 (range, 2‒22) days; median length of stay was 6.5 (range, 2‒23) days. Across all studies, most patients achieved an objective response (80%), including complete responses (55%).\n\nConclusions: A subset of patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell NHL were successfully treated with liso-cel and monitored for CAR T cell-related toxicity in the outpatient setting, including elderly patients and patients with high tumor burden. Incidences of severe CRS, NEs, and early hospitalization were low; 45% of patients did not require hospitalization at any time after liso-cel infusion. Overall, 80% of patients achieved an objective response.\n\nClinical Trial Registry: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02631044; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03744676; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03483103.\n\nDisclosure: Funding Statement: This study was funded by Juno Therapeutics, a Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.

Ltd., Hyderabad, India, 29 Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, United States, 30 Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Pierre-Bénite, France\n\nBackground: Tisagenlecleucel (autologous anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy) has demonstrated durable responses and a manageable safety profile in adult patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (r/r DLBCL).\n\nMethods: Results from JULIET, a global, single-arm, pivotal, phase 2 trial of tisagenlecleucel in adult patients with r/r DLBCL were analyzed to assess the relationship between pre- and post-infusion factors and biomarkers, as well as cytokine release syndrome (CRS; Penn scale)/neurological event (NE, CTCAE v.4.03) severity, with efficacy.\n\nResults: As of December 11, 2018, 115 patients were infused with tisagenlecleucel and evaluable for efficacy. Baseline tumor volume (TV) did not correlate with month 3 response. Median lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels at pre-infusion were higher in nonresponders (NRs) compared with patients achieving response. 15/16 patients with pre-infusion grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia (<50 × 109/L) were NRs. Pre-infusion C-reactive protein (CRP) levels did not associate with month 3 response. Univariate/multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that high pre-infusion LDH levels (defined as higher than 2-fold the upper limit of normal [ULN]) were independently associated with NRs. Compared with patients with normal levels of LDH at pre-infusion, patients with LDH 1-2-fold or >2-fold above the ULN had poorer progression-free and overall survival (PFS, OS). Patients with pre-infusion platelet levels < 50 × 109/L also had significantly worse PFS/OS compared with patients with platelet levels ≥50 × 109/L. Pre-infusion high TV, high CRP, and high ferritin associated with worse OS, but not PFS.\n\nPost-infusion, 13/13 patients with severe NE were NRs. 9/17 patients with grade 3 CRS and 9/9 patients with grade 4 CRS were also NRs. Patients with severe CRS had worse PFS/OS compared with patients with grade 0-2 CRS. Similarly, patients with severe NE had worse PFS and OS compared with patients with grade 0-2 NE. High pre-infusion LDH, pre-infusion grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia, and severe NE, but not severe CRS, were independently associated with poorer PFS in multivariate Cox regression analyses.\n\nNotably, higher median baseline TV, highest levels of serum biomarkers, highest LDH, and lowest platelet counts within 1 month post-infusion were observed in patients with severe CRS who were also NRs, compared with patients with severe CRS who achieved response and patients with grade 0-2 CRS.\n\nConclusions: Multivariate analyses identified that high levels of pre-infusion LDH (a known marker of tumor burden, metabolic activity, and disease aggressiveness) were associated with NRs at month 3 and worse PFS/OS. Pre-infusion grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia and grade 3/4 NE were also associated with poor efficacy outcomes. The highest serum biomarker profiles post-infusion appeared to associate with patients with severe CRS who were also NRs. These analyses suggest that a subset of patients with aggressive disease at infusion and/or patients with severe CRS/NE had poorer outcomes in the JULIET trial, and may reinforce the rationale for current and future directions of using CAR-T cell therapy in an earlier line of therapy (during less aggressive/less advanced disease), optimizing patient care, and developing interventions to prevent severe CRS and/or NE.\n\nClinical Trial Registry: NCT02445248\n\nDisclosure: Westin: Genentech: Other: Advisory Board, Research Funding; Novartis; Other: Advisory Board, Research Funding; Curis: Other: Advisory Board, Research Funding; Celgene: Other: Advisory Board, Research Funding; 47 Inc: Other: Research Funding; Juno: Other: Advisory Board; MorphoSys: Other: Advisory Board; Unum: Other: Research Funding; Janssen: Other: Advisory Board, Research Funding; Kite: Other: Advisory Board, Research Funding.
