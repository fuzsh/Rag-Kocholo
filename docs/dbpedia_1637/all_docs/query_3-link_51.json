My only concerns in life were how to avoid a transfer to the Case Progression Unit we do paperwork so real coppers don’t have to and finding a way to climb into the panties of the outrageously perky WPC Leslie May. Then one night, in pursuance of a murder inquiry, I tried to take a witness statement from someone who was dead but disturbingly voluable, and that brought me to the attention of Inspector Nightingale, the last wizard in England. Now I’m a Detective Constable and a trainee wizard, the first apprentice in fifty years, and my world has become somewhat more complicated: nests of vampires in Purley, negotiating a truce between the warring god and goddess of the Thames, and digging up graves in Covent Garden…\n\nand there’s something festering at the heart of the city I love, a malicious vengeful spirit that takes ordinary Londoners and twists them into grotesque mannequins to act out its drama of violence and despair. The spirit of riot and rebellion has awakened in the city, and it’s falling to me to bring order out of chaos or die trying.\n\nMoon Over Soho\n\nBODY AND SOUL The song. That’s what London constable and sorcerer s apprentice Peter Grant first notices when he examines the corpse of Cyrus Wilkins, part time jazz drummer and full time accountant, who dropped dead of a heart attack while playing a gig at Soho s 606 Club. The notes of the old jazz standard are rising from the body a sure sign that something about the man s death was not at all natural but instead supernatural. Body and soul they re also what Peter will risk as he investigates a pattern of similar deaths in and around Soho. With the help of his superior officer, Detective Chief Inspector Thomas Nightingale, the last registered wizard in England, and the assistance of beautiful jazz aficionado Simone Fitzwilliam, Peter will uncover a deadly magical menace one that leads right to his own doorstep and to the squandered promise of a young jazz musician: a talented trumpet player named Richard Lord Grant otherwise known as Peter s dear old dad.\n\nDoctor Who and the Auton Invasion (By:Terrance Dicks)\n\nAudio CD, BBC Physical Audio\n\nDoctor Who and the Auton Invasion (By:Terrance Dicks)\n\nAudio CD, BBC Physical Audio\n\nDoctor Who and the Dalek Invasion of Earth (By:Terrance Dicks)\n\nThe TARDIS lands in a London of future times-a city of devastation now ruled by Daleks.
