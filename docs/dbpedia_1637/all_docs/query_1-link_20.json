        "text": "Bram Stoker (born November 8, 1847, Clontarf, County Dublin, Ireland—died April 20, 1912, London, England) was an Irish writer best known as the author of the Gothic horror tale Dracula (1897).\n\nDue to illness, Stoker could not stand or walk until he was seven years old. He went on to become an outstanding athlete and football (soccer) player at Trinity College (1864–70) in Dublin, where he earned a degree in mathematics. After 10 years in the civil service at Dublin Castle, during which he was also an unpaid drama critic for the Dublin Evening Mail (later the Evening Mail), he made the acquaintance of his idol, actor Sir Henry Irving. From 1878 until Irving’s death 27 years later, Stoker was Irving’s manager, writing as many as 50 letters a day for him and accompanying him on his American tours. (After Irving’s death, Stoker published Personal Reminiscences of Henry Irving [1906], a biography of Irving that includes a great deal of biographical detail about Stoker himself.) Stoker’s first book, The Duties of Clerks of Petty Sessions in Ireland, a handbook in legal administration, was published in 1879. Turning to fiction later in life, he published his first novel, The Snake’s Pass, a romantic thriller set in bleak western Ireland, in 1890.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nName That Author\n\nStoker’s masterpiece, the novel Dracula, was published in 1897. It was written chiefly in the form of diaries and journals kept by the principal characters: Jonathan Harker, who made the first contact with the vampire Count Dracula; Wilhelmina (“Mina”) Harker (née Murray), Jonathan’s eventual wife; Dr. John (“Jack”) Seward, a psychiatrist and sanatorium administrator; and Lucy Westenra, Mina’s friend and a victim of Dracula who herself becomes a vampire. The story is that of a Transylvanian vampire who, using supernatural powers, makes his way to England and there victimizes innocent people to gain the blood on which he survives. Led by Dr. Abraham Van Helsing—Seward’s mentor and an expert on “obscure diseases”—Harker and his friends, after many hair-raising adventures, are at last able to overpower and destroy Dracula. The novel’s influence on representations of vampires in Western popular culture has been immense and long-lasting. Dracula has enjoyed wide popularity in its many adaptations for film, television, and the stage.\n\nStoker died in 1912. The cause of his death is disputed. Two years later, in 1914, his widow, Florence Stoker, published Dracula’s Guest as part of a posthumous collection of short stories; most contemporary scholars believe that editors had excised it from the original Dracula manuscript. In 2009 Dacre Stoker (great grandnephew of the author) and Ian Holt produced Dracula: The Un-Dead, a sequel that is based on the novelist’s own notes and excisions from the original. The sequel, which shuns the epistolary style of the first Dracula for traditional third-person narrative, is a thriller set in London in 1912, and it features Bram Stoker as a character.\n\nStoker wrote several other novels—among them The Mystery of the Sea (1902), The Jewel of Seven Stars (1903), and The Lady of the Shroud (1909)—but none of them approached the popularity of Dracula."
