        "text": "This wasn’t a bad reading month, though I did DNF nearly as many books as I finished. You know what sucks? When someone recommends a book to you by comparing it favourably to a book you absolutely adored, then when you start reading it, you realise the similarities are tenuous and superficial at best! (I’m still a bit bitter. If anyone has any recommendations for books actually like the Emily Wilde books, let me know!)\n\nPAST MONTH’S READING:\n\nThe Agathas by Kathleen Glasgow and Liz Lawson (YA mystery/thriller – 3 stars – review)\n\nA Generation of Vipers (Nel Ward Mysteries #4) by Sarah Yarwood-Lovett (cosy mystery – 2.5 stars – review)\n\nA Time Traveller’s Best Friend by W. R. Gingell (sci-fi/humour – 3 stars – review)\n\nDragon Consultant by Mell Eight (urban fantasy – 2 stars)\n\nCURRENTLY READING\n\nPhysical book: I have at least four books that I’ve started but not finished yet. It’s a bit of a problem. They’re my goal for the next month or two.\n\nEbook: Chasing Ghosts by Dean Cole is where my focus currently is. It started off strong but at the moment it feels a bit like every character is there to represent one of the author’s beliefs and be a talking head on the subject. I’m hoping it’ll pick up a bit and we’ll get some actual ghosts rather than just talk about the metaphysical.\n\nAudio book: I’ve started The Soulmate by Sally Hepworth, and I’m enjoying it but also wishing I could shake some sense into the narrator. Which I think is the point. I thought it was a thriller but it’s more of a drama. I know a lot of people really love this author but based on this one, I’m not sure she’s exactly my cup of tea.\n\nREADING NEXT:\n\nI had Red Seas Under Skies, the sequel to The Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch, under this heading in my June wrap-up and I haven’t touched it yet! But I have to try to read it in August so I can return it to the library without renewing it a million times. Then my aim is to finish some of the other books I’ve started over the last few months but not finished yet.\n\nFAVOURITE BOOKISH PHOTO:\n\nIt’s trickier to decide this when none of the books I photographed during the month ended up wowing me (or they were DNFs). Plus I was reading on my Kindle most of the time, and it never does the cover images justice. But this one’s pretty good.\n\nYou can see all my bookish photos and reels (plus some RL as well) on my Instagram.\n\nWhat are you reading this month? 🙂\n\nOof yeah. I think reading so much in May sent me into a reading slump! I only finished one physical book in June. But I did finish five audio books, so overall an okay reading month.\n\nPAST MONTH’S READING:\n\nHush by Sara Foster (sci-fi/thriller – 3.5 stars)\n\nOur Wives Under the Sea (literary fiction/horror – 3.5 stars)\n\nA Master of Djinn by P. Djeli Clark (historical fantasy – 3.5 stars)\n\nDoctor Who: Borrowed Time by Naomi A. Alderman (sci-fi – 3 stars)\n\nDoctor Who: The Nightmare of Black Island by Mike Tucker (sci-fi – 4 stars)\n\nDoctor Who: Wet World by Mark Michalowski (sci-fi – 2.5 stars)\n\nCURRENTLY READING:\n\nPhysical book: Since finishing A Master of Djinn, I’ve focused on The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon again for a while. I’ve hit page 300/830!\n\nEbook: The Year’s Best African Speculative Fiction (2021), edited by Oghenechovwe Donald Ekpeki is still ongoing. I’ve been going from one library book to the other this month, so I haven’t had time to pick up my Kindle. That probably won’t change in June but that’s the good thing about short stories, you can come and go as you please.\n\nAudio book: I haven’t got a specific one at the moment, but I’m enjoying working through my library’s selection of Doctor Who audio books, which are often read by stars of the show. It’s fun getting to have extra adventures in the TARDIS while there are no new episodes coming out.\n\nREADING NEXT:\n\nBack in 2023 I started reading Red Seas Under Skies, the sequel to The Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch, but I had to return it to the library before I’d got very far with it. This time I’m determined to see it through.\n\nFAVOURITE BOOKISH PHOTO:\n\nHonestly, I didn’t take that many bookish photos this month, and made up for it with posts relating to the writing project I’m currently working on. That said, there is this one, of the book that took me three weeks to finish, despite being under 400 pages and quite an easy read. If ever there was a sign of a reading slump…\n\nYou can see all my bookish photos and reels (plus some RL as well) on my Instagram.\n\nWhat are you reading this month? 🙂\n\nThis month I was doing a very fun readathon that got me reading quite a lot. But the speed with which I read four books in 12 days slowed down quite a bit in the second half of the month. Thank goodness I realised that sort of speed wasn’t going to be sustainable! Six books per month seems to be my sweet spot and a good total to aim for each month.\n\nPAST MONTH’S READING:\n\n.\n\nMister Magic by Kiersten White (horror – 4 stars – review)\n\nButcher & Blackbird by Brynne Weaver (dark romance – 2 stars – review)\n\nThe Kiss Quotient by Helen Hoang (romance – 3.5 stars – review)\n\nTen Steps to Nanette by Hannah Gadsby (memoir – 5 stars)\n\nA Mischief of Rats (Nel Ward Mysteries #3) by Sarah Yarwood-Lovett (mystery – 4 stars)\n\nThe Shadow Cabinet by Juno Dawson (urban fantasy – 4 stars)\n\nCURRENTLY READING:\n\nPhysical book: I’m finally reading The Fifth Season by N. K. Jemisin. I think this has been on TBR pretty much since it came out, and I made it one of my five priority reads for 2024. It is slow-moving but absorbing so far. Still going with The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon as well. It’s my big goal for June!\n\nEbook: The Year’s Best African Speculative Fiction (2021), edited by Oghenechovwe Donald Ekpeki is still ongoing. I’ve been going from one library book to the other this month, so I haven’t had time to pick up my Kindle. That probably won’t change in June but that’s the good thing about short stories, you can come and go as you please.\n\nAudio book: I picked up The Hush by Sara Foster on a whim, as I enjoy near-future thrillers. Even though I’m nearly halfway through this one, I’m not entirely sure what I think of it. It’s fairly engaging, though. I’m not contemplating abandoning it.\n\nREADING NEXT:\n\nI picked up A Master of Djinn by P. Djèli Clark from the library this week, after months of it being listed as lost. They must have got a replacement copy. I read the short story and novella set in this universe back around 2021, and I’m excited to finally re-enter this historical fantasy world!\n\nFAVOURITE BOOKISH PHOTO:\n\nIt’s funny how most of my bookish photos are done in the exact same style, and yet I somehow like the way some turn out more than others. I started The Atlas Six during May but have put it aside for a bit while I focus on library books. I’m not entirely sure it’s going to be my cup of tea but the black and gold cover with the astronomy theme and kind of tarot vibes is definitely striking.\n\nYou can see all my bookish photos and reels (plus some RL as well) on my Instagram.\n\nWhat are you reading this month? 🙂\n\nTitle: The Kiss Quotient\n\nAuthor: Helen Hoang\n\nGenre: Romance\n\nIntended audience: Adult\n\nDate Read: 05/05/2024 – 07/05/2024\n\nRating: ★★★☆\n\nReview:\n\nThis was one of those books that was sweet and fun while I was reading, but when I looked back at it, I had to wonder what actually happened for 300+ pages. The dramas were a little too drawn out, and it did get a bit repetitive. Still, it wasn’t a bad way to spend some time.\n\nTouted as “reverse Pretty Woman“, this book focuses on Stella, a successful woman with what was formerly known as Asperger’s, who hires male escort, Michael, to learn how to be good at sex and attract a suitable partner.\n\nThe two lead characters, Stella and Michael, were what really made this book. I really enjoyed both their journeys. There was a bit of insta-love there, but I didn’t mind it too much in this case.\n\nIn and of itself, though, I wasn’t grabbed by the romance. The two characters were supposedly 30 and 28, and acted like horny teenagers most of the time. There’s nothing wrong with characters being unable to keep their hands off each other in theory, but this was just cringey. And in addition, the spice was described much the same way every time.\n\nThe other thing that frustrated me was that the characters just didn’t talk to each other. I know this is a common trope in romance books and sometimes it is done well, but as with the repetitive sex scenes, the scenes in which they characters angsted about their individual problems and how their love interest must not know also sounded a bit the same after a while.\n\nI’m sure there are plenty of people for whom this won’t really be an issue. As a neurotypical person, I don’t want to speak to the autism representation in the book, but I understand it is quite good, and that the author realised she was autistic herself as she was researching. I think for me it’s a case of the whole being less than the sum of its parts, and that’s okay!\n\nFind me on:\n\nGoodReads | Threads | Instagram | Storygraph\n\nTitle: Mister Magic\n\nAuthor: Kiersten White\n\nGenre: Thriller/horror\n\nIntended audience: Adult\n\nDate Read: 28/04/2024 – 04/05/2024\n\nRating: ★★★★\n\nReview:\n\nI felt like this book was written specifically for Millennials. The way we interact with pop culture, the ways in which being on the Internet in our formative years shaped us, and the specific ways in which our parents screwed us up.\n\nMister Magic was a radio show then a TV show that ended in the mid-90s. There are no surviving episodes, no footage online, and only its most ardent fans remember it at all. When the final cast reunite, including one cast member who has no memory of the show whatsoever, they will need to confront exactly what went on in their childhoods and whether Mister Magic was the blissful childhood dream they remembered.\n\nThe characters are diverse and interesting, but all weighed down by the expectations they feel have been placed on them since their time on Mister Magic. They’re each trying to reclaim that childhood happiness, having found their adult lives lacking due to familial expectations and unforeseen circumstances.\n\nThis book hits a lot of great beats for a creepy story – isolated setting, strange noises, unreliable memories, strangers with sinister motives keeping secrets… the sense of foreboding was really great for the first two-thirds to three-quarters. Unfortunately, once we started to get a better idea of what was happening, and once that was outright explained, I started to lose interest a bit.\n\nIt’s been over a week since I finished and I’m still not sure whether I liked the ending. I think that might be partly because I was hoping for a happy ending wrapped up in a bow and the book doesn’t give you that, which is its right. I took away a message of breaking cycles of abuse and creating a better environment for the next generation, which was something I did appreciate.\n\nThis is my first Kiersten White book and I get the impression her backlist is quite varied. I’m looking forward to checking out some of her other writing to see how it compares.\n\nFind me on:\n\nGoodReads | Threads | Instagram | Storygraph\n\nTitle: Butcher & Blackbird (Ruinous Love #1)\n\nAuthor: Brynne Weaver\n\nGenre: (Dark?) romance\n\nIntended audience: Adult\n\nDate Read: 02/05/2024 – 04/05/2024\n\nRating: ★★\n\nReview:\n\nThis review got lengthy! Sorry! I just had a lot of opinions I needed to get off my chest!\n\nThis is the second romance book I’ve read this year that has some sort of “gimmick” and it’s the second time I’m annoyed and disappointed at the missed potential (for those keeping score, the first one was My Roommate is a Vampire by Jenna Levine, which I didn’t end up reviewing). In this case, I came to this advertised serial killer rom-com because I’m a fan of serial killer books (read: thrillers), and I wanted to see how the romance take on it.\n\nUnfortunately, the concept fell entirely flat for me. I just kept muttering things like “How haven’t they been caught?”, “They’re not actually good at this,” and “They don’t fit the profile at all.” Both Rowan and Sloane are just some screwed up young people who occasionally kill people. Their characters outside of the killing didn’t match with people who would slice and dice others on the regular, even if they are “ethical” serial killers who only murder objectively awful people (other murderers, child molesters, etc.). Sloane literally blushes on every second page! Blushes “prettily”. Uggghhhhh. It was also bizarre to me that all their friends and family seem to know what they do and aren’t worried by it. Which kind of lessened the whole “he/she’s the only person who can understand the ~dark side~ of me.”\n\nOutside of their yearly killing competition, we don’t really see much of their serial killing, though apparently they’ve both done enough for the public to have given them names like Boston Butcher and Orb Weaver. They didn’t seem like they took their “hobby” (and they both refer to it as a hobby) very seriously. It just felt like the author didn’t do a lot of research into serial killers other than “they take trophies” and “they stage their crime scenes” and just used it as the fun “quirk” her characters had.\n\nSo with all that, it didn’t feel very “dark” to me. Yeah, some of the content was gross and gory, but it felt like an attempt to be edgy, rather than actually being dark. This is compounded by how cutesy the trigger warning list at the start is. I mean, yes, thank you for including trigger warnings, but don’t try to downplay them in the way you list them.\n\nI have to assume that that’s what people are meaning when they are calling this “dark romance”. Can something be both dark romance and a rom-com? I’m not sure how that works, but I’ve seen this referred to as both. Anyway, I have to assume they’re referring to the gore when they refer to the dark stuff, because the sex scenes were fairly tame, really. I mean, they were fine as far as spice goes, but given Rowan’s repeated “I’m going to destroy you” and similar declarations, it was really just… somewhat rough sex?\n\nThe other thing that bothered me about the sex scenes was that the majority of them (with one exception, I think, though now I’m not entirely sure this wasn’t in the bonus chapter) are all about Rowan. He gets to enact all his fantasies about Sloane, order her around, and she does everything he says. And obviously that was doing it for her, but there was never any discussion about it or what she wanted. As a woman, it just didn’t seem like it would be that fun after a while. Rowan also kept putting his hands around her throat, and yeah, they had a safe word, but they never actually had a discussion about whether it was okay for him to do that. Maybe I’m boring, but that wasn’t okay for me.\n\nAlso I will never be eating at Rowan’s restaurants knowing that he doesn’t bother to clean up after certain activities on the tables, if you know what I mean. (Maybe they cleaned up off-page but it definitely read as them going straight home to do more.)\n\nOh, and did I mention the insta-love? Insta-love/lust, followed by a weirdly paced story that takes place over four whole years, but with a whole bunch of time jumps and explanations that half their relationship-build is taking place off screen. Then they get together and things got so boring and mundane and I couldn’t believe I still had 70+ pages to go. The ending was pretty silly, and I have no idea what the “villain’s” motivation was, other than him also getting off the idea of killing a couple of serial killers. Maybe it was clear while I was reading, but I’ve already forgotten.\n\nFind me on:\n\nGoodReads | Threads | Instagram | Storygraph\n\nI’m starting to believe that I was in a year-long reading slump in 2023. I finally had one five-star read in October, but I wasn’t truly enjoying what I was reading. This year, I have already had three five-star reads, and the four-star ones feel like proper “I really enjoyed that” four star reads rather than the more objective “Ah, yes, I can see how that was a good book” four stars. I don’t know what triggered the change, but man I’m relieved about it! I’ve still had a few duds but it’s easier to cope with those when they’re balanced out by others!\n\nPAST MONTH’S READING:\n\nEmily Wilde’s Encyclopaedia of Fairies by Heather Fawcett (cosy fantasy – 5 stars – review)\n\nEmily Wilde’s Map of the Otherlands by Heather Fawcett (cosy fantasy – 5 stars – review)\n\nHer Majesty’s Royal Coven by Juno Dawson (urban fantasy/horror – 4 stars – review)\n\nCURRENTLY READING:\n\nPhysical book: I’m currently reading both Mister Magic, a contemporary horror by Kiersten White, and Sabriel by Garth Nix. I started Sabriel last year and then put it on a bit of an indefinite hold, but I need to get it back to the colleague who loaned it to me before she moves to a different workplace in mid-May so the race is on!\n\nI started Mister Magic as a palette cleanser with the intention of using it for next month’s readathon, but I fear I got hooked and I’ve now read too much of it in April for it to count! 😂\n\nI reached page 200 of The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon on April 1 and then kind of abandoned it. I’ve read another 50 pages or so in the last week, but it will be a work in progress for a bit longer. I’m doing another readathon in May, as well as a buddy read, so there will be other books that will take priority.\n\nEbook: The Year’s Best African Speculative Fiction (2021), edited by Oghenechovwe Donald Ekpeki is still ongoing. I’ve been going from one library book to the other this month, so I haven’t had time to pick up my Kindle. That probably won’t change in May.\n\nAudio book: I initially started the physical copy of Hannah Gadby’s memoir, Ten Steps to Nanette, but I quickly remembered why I prefer listening to non-fiction to reading it. I haven’t had a lot of solo driving lately or going on many walks, so I’ve been finding it difficult to carve out time for audio books (and have switched to the paperbacks of a couple) but I’ve made enough of a dent in this one now that I think I’ll be able to make time for the rest of it.\n\nREADING NEXT:\n\nI am torn between The Shadow Cabinet by Juno Dawson and Butcher & Blackbird by Brynne Weaver. I think Butcher & Blackbird may be winning slightly. I love serial killer thrillers but this is a spicy romantic comedy?! That retains all the dark stuff?! So I’m not entirely sure how I’ll go with it but I am sure am keen to try it out.\n\nREADATHON PROGRESS:\n\nI wasn’t doing any readathons this month and I’m glad I was able to just focus on the books I wanted to read. I’m doing one in May, though, as I mentioned above, and I’m considering even maybe making a booktube video for it, even though I haven’t done one of those in months! We’ll see.\n\nFAVOURITE BOOKISH PHOTO:\n\nI adored the Emily Wilde books this month! I love historical fantasy and I love cosy fantasy and these were the perfect blend of both! I am now waiting with bated breath for book three in 2025!\n\nYou can see all my bookish photos and reels (plus some RL as well) on my Instagram.\n\nWhat are you reading this month? 🙂\n\nTitle: Her Majesty’s Royal Coven (Her Majesty’s Royal Coven #1)\n\nAuthor: Juno Dawson\n\nGenre: Urban Fantasy/horror\n\nIntended audience: Adult\n\nDate Read: 08/03/2024 – 13/03/2024\n\nRating: ★★★★\n\nReview:\n\nI started this book in audio format, but I am finding lately I haven’t had a lot of time to invest in listening to books, so I decided to switch to the paperback. I’m so glad I did, because after taking at least a couple of weeks to listen to the first 40%, I read the other 60% in a matter of days, and I’m pretty sure I enjoyed it all the more for being able to properly absorb myself.\n\nHMRC draws on a lot of English witchy folklore, with references to Pendle Hill and such, but also examines the ways in which witchcraft narratives have developed over the years to favour certain types of stories. The four main characters are bound by childhood oaths but they are now very different people, hardened by a war that made them grow up too quickly, with different values and different attitudes to the world around them.\n\nI was impressed with Dawson’s ability to handle the different POVs in this book, particularly those who are in opposition to her own values. Niamh was definitely my favourite character, though I enjoyed Leonie and Elle’s perspectives too. Helena is a compelling character to read even though she is an absolute piece of work. Seeing her transformation from “Well, she’s wrong but maybe we could sit her down and explain why she’s being unreasonable” to “wow, she went completely off the rails” made for some compelling reading.\n\nI know that some people are going to say that Dawson was “heavy-handed” because I found myself thinking that, too, before reminding myself that discussions of issues affecting marginalised people are allowed to be there on the page. An author doesn’t have to seamlessly weave their exploration of issues into the story and never explicitly mention it for it to be acceptable.\n\nThe cliffhanger ending does feel a little cheap or unearned, but I am keen to see where the next volume takes us! I already had it on hold at the library before I had finished this one and I’ll be diving into it soon!\n\nFind me on:\n\nGoodReads | Threads | Instagram | Storygraph\n\nTitle: Emily Wilde’s Map of the Otherlands (Emily Wilde #2)\n\nAuthor: Heather Fawcett\n\nGenre: Cosy/Historical Fantasy\n\nIntended audience: Adult\n\nDate Read: 08/04/2024 – 11/04/2024\n\nRating: ★★★★★\n\nReview:\n\nIn the few hours between finishing this book and starting to write this review, I was tossing up whether to rate Emily Wilde’s Map of the Otherlands four or five stars. At times I thought there was probably enough reason (going by my usual rating system) to make this a four star book with some very good five-star moments. But there a lot of those moments and they left me feeling giddily delighted, plus I’ve felt a bit book-drunk ever since finishing….\n\n… not to mention, this is the point where I became distracted from writing this review by reading the precious few pieces of fanfiction that exist for this series… so yeah. It’s another five star like its predecessor.\n\nThis instalment does bring the relationship between Emily Wilde and Wendell Bambleby to the fore in a way it was not in the first book, which may put some people off. At the same time, for plot reasons, Wendell spent a lot of the book unconscious or at least asleep, but Emily is still cantankerous and determined enough to take herself off alone. Though often she’s going off alone because of things she needs to do to help Wendell, so there’s that.\n\nWhile the grumpy/sunshine dynamic between Emily and Wendell is definitely one of my favourite things about the series, meaning I was a bit disappointed by Wendell’s extended absences, Fawcett does not disappoint with her descriptions of Faerie when Emily once again goes gallivanting. The enchantments! The other Fey! The scenery! The danger! These scenes are so immersive, and I love every page.\n\nIn this book, Wendell and Emily are also joined by Ariadne, Emily’s niece, who is nineteen and inspired by her aunt to study dryadology, though Emily’s relationship with her is constantly wrong-footed. This was one of the things that troubled me a bit in the book. While it’s true that Emily doesn’t know how to people, the way she treated Ariadne felt just plain mean at times. At least she was self-aware about it, and finally did apologise. But it did feel a bit outside of the realms of generally cantankerous. The other addition to their party is Farris Rose, the head of the Dryadology department at Cambridge. While at first it seems that he simply doesn’t trust Emily and Wendell and maybe seeks to claim some of the research for himself, it soon becomes more of a father figure to Emily, and his protestations at their relationship are due to having Emily’s best interests at heart. I quite liked the way they ended up bantering instead of being actually at each other’s throats.\n\nI had assumed that we were one-and-done with the setting from book one, seeing as this one is set in an entirely different part of Europe. I was both surprised and delighted when Poe, Emily’s brownie friend, made not one but multiple reappearances throughout this book. He’s so cute! I want a brownie to bake fresh bread for me every morning. I would leave all the offerings.\n\nIt is not often that I find myself wanting to reread a series (or what there currently is of it) immediately after finishing it. In fact, I rarely reread books at all. The only time I can remember doing it in quick succession in recent times was four years ago, when I read a book in preparation for an audition for a play based on said book, then read it again when I knew which character I’d be playing. I nearly launched straight back into Emily Wilde’s Encyclopaedia of Fairies as soon as I had finished this book, but I persuaded myself to read something else first. Either way, this is a world I can see myself revisiting many times, and it’s going to be a long wait until book three in 2025!\n\nFind me on:\n\nGoodReads | Threads | | Instagram | Storygraph"
