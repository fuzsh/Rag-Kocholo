The Diary of Lilian Velez is an account of the Filipina actress and singer’s life from 1946 until her death in 1948. Her story is told through her diary entries, compiled by the her only surviving child, Vivian Climaco Ocampo, who also wrote the book's introduction and post script. The book also includes a biography of Lilian Velez written by Isidra Reyes, accompanied by family photos, movie stills, newspaper clippings, handwritten lines, and other ephemera.

“Through a diary that renders a broad history of society as well as the details of popular culture, she initiates us to her remarkable career as an ebullient entertainer. This publication is a vital contribution to the inquiry around film and women, surely, but also to the annals of crime and fatal affection.” – Patrick Flores
