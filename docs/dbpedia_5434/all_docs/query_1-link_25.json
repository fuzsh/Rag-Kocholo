        "text": "The Lilian Velez: Till Death Do Us Part\n\n“DADDY, NARDING KILLED MOMMY!”\n\nCarlo J. Caparas (1995)\n\nThis is based on a true-to-life story of Lilian Velez. A famous stage and movie actress during the 40’s who was brutally murdered by her former obsessed leading man/ co-actor Bernardo “Narding” Anzures on June 26, 1948. Lilian Velez was 24 years old while Narding Anzures was 21. The crime took place in the Velez’ house at around two in the morning. Authorities said that Narding Anzures admitted plunging the knife into Lilian Velez while they sat in her home.\n\nThe actress’ four-year-old daughter, Vivian saw how her mother was brutally killed by Narding as she peeked through a small hole in her room. The real reason for the murder was unclear although it has been said that Narding was very much obsessed with Lilian Velez even if she’s already married with Jose Climaco, a movie director. Climaco came home at around three in the morning and was shocked to see policemen in their house. His daughter then came running and said “Daddy, Narding killed mommy!” which made him run inside the house.\n\nI am very much impressed on how Cesar Montano portrayed the role of Bernardo “Narding” Anzures. He did really well on the whole movie. Also Sharon Cuneta who portrayed as Lilian Velez and Joel Torre as Jose Climaco. Cesar Montano’s acting was really good. I can see pass through his eyes all the anger, the love, the obsession all wrapped in one great character. It felt like I was taken back to the 40’s while I was watching the entire film. The whole scene, the set up, the wardrobe and even the texture of the film really made it look like it was taken during the 40’s. Also the sounds and how the film was taken. I hope that these kinds of film were taken good care of so that the younger generations could look back on how the movies started and was created back then."
