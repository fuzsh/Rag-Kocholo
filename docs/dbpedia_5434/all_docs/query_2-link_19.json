        "text": "Luther Rice Undergraduate Research Fellowships are part of the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences comprehensive undergraduate initiative to promote discovery- and inquiry-based education throughout the undergraduate experience at GW. Luther Rice Fellowships offer support for student research carried out in collaboration with, and under the guidance of, at least one faculty mentor.\n\nThese fellowships offer substantial support for the promotion of working research alliances between students and faculty. The fellowships provide stipends to the students for research-related expenditures, including summer living expenses, travel, materials and equipment. The faculty mentor also receives monetary funds for salary or professional development.\n\nFeatured Luther Rice Fellows\n\nRead more:\n\nLemur Lessons Lead Luther Rice Fellows\n\nArt + Science = A Hybrid Project Combining Politics and Dance\n\nStudent’s Tenacity Yields Diabetes Breakthrough\n\nEligibility & Application Requirements\n\nStudents\n\nMust be a Columbian College sophomore or junior\n\nMust have a full-time faculty mentor\n\nMust have a declared major\n\nMust have no judicial or disciplinary findings against them\n\nResearch Project\n\nMust be undertaken during the junior or senior year (or the summer before the junior year)\n\nShould undertake a significant, focused examination of an idea or an area of inquiry and result in work that could merit presentation or publication in a scholarly venue\n\nDeadlines\n\nThere are two different deadlines for submission. Students who apply in the fall and are not selected for funding may revise and resubmit their proposals in the spring.\n\nTuesday, December 5, 2023 at 11:59 p.m. EST\n\nTuesday, February 27, 2024 at 11:59 p.m. EST\n\nApplication\n\nThe Luther Rice Undergraduate Research Fellowship Application consists of a Student Application, a Faculty Statement of Support and official transcripts obtained from the Student Services Hub.
