Recto who died in a road accident while on a joyride with friends in 1949.[7]\n\nBarangay 629 Hall, Santa Mesa, Manila: Said to be haunted by poltergeists and the ghosts of children caroling.[8]\n\nBarugo Road, North Caloocan: Said to be haunted by a hairless, charred white lady who chases after passing jeepneys.[9]\n\nBroadway Avenue, Quezon City: Dubbed as \"Millionaire's Row\" for its being located in the affluent neighborhood of New Manila, several mansions along the road are said to be haunted by various entities.
