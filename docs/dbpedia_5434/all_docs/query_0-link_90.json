        "text": "AWARD-winning director and “Komiks King” Carlo J. Caparas’ wife Donna Villa passed away on Tuesday. She was 57.\n\nVilla died in confinement at a hospital following a bout with cancer.\n\nAside from Caparas, Villa leaves behind two children: son CJ and daughter Peach.\n\nVilla was a former actress, but she was best known for producing Caparas-directed films.\n\nCollectively referred to as the “Golden Couple,” Villa and Caparas were widely credited for ushering in the so-called “Massacre Era” through their own Golden Lion films back in the early 1990s.\n\nThe films brought to the silver screen by the couple include: “The Vizconde Massacre: God Help Us” (1993) and “The Myrna Diones Story (Lord, Have Mercy)” (1993) starring Kris Aquino, “The Untold Story: Vizconde Massacre II: May The Lord Be with Us” (1994), “Lipa Massacre: Lord, Deliver Us from Evil” (1994), “Antipolo Massacre (Jesus Save Us!)”\n\n(1994), “The Lilian Velez Story: Till Death Do Us Part” (1995) starring Sharon Cuneta, and “Annabelle Huggins Story-Ruben Ableza Tragedy” (1995), to name a few.\n\nActresses Vivian Velez and Sarah Lahbati were among the first celebrities to express their condolences to the family on social media.\n\nVelez wrote on Facebook: “Remembering Donna’s wonderful and gentle soul will forever remain in our hearts. May she rest in peace.”\n\nMeanwhile Lahbati posted: “Saddened and shocked about the recent news… tita Donna Villa was always supportive of me and always had the biggest, infectious smile.”\n\n“I cherish my time spent with you on our last film together. May you Rest in Peace,” she added. (Regina Mae Parungao)"
