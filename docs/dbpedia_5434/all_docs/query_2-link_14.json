In this time of increased imaging and rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, how do artists working with photography continue to imagine, experiment, and explore this essential form of communication?\n\nOrganized as a conversation between seven 2021–2023 alumni of Pratt Institute’s nascent Photography MFA program and a selection of singular works by the six graduates of the class of 2024, To Live in the Imagination presents a continuum of practices from an evolving cohort of artists in dialogue across disciplines, sites, and experiences. Existential essentials—such as memory, landscape, home, family, and the body—are shared subjects of inquiry and exploration among many of the included artists, while others address the shifting field of photographic representation. Throughout the exhibition, care and criticality are of equal importance.\n\nStephanie Espinoza\n\nRachel Handlin\n\nKatharina Kiefert\n\nEthan Li\n\nMegan Mack in collaboration with Abby Waters\n\nKristina Naso\n\nChloe Scout Nix\n\nErin O’Flynn\n\nJan Rattia\n\nKunwar Prithvi Singh Rathore\n\nLena Smart\n\nBaillie Vensel\n\nJingge Zhang\n\nRecent Exhibitions\n\nThe Apex Is Nothing\n\nCurated by Ken Weathersby and John O’Connor\n\nApril 5–June 8, 2024\n\nOpening Reception: Thursday, April 4, 6–8 pm\n\nLearn more about the exhibition through the Exhibition Catalogue and the Virtual Tour.\n\nThis exhibition was inspired by Alfred Jensen, whose paintings and drawings maintain a center of energy between abstract form and an array of idea structures. Jensen’s thinking was shaped by his deep interest in realities outside of the strict visual concerns of painting or drawing, such as philosophy, physics, mathematics, and calendrical time. The other featured artists in The Apex Is Nothing similarly draw upon diverse systems, including statistical data, language and text, and mapped social or political matrices.\n\nFeatured Artists:\n\nMel Bochner\n\nBecky Brown\n\nMike Cloud\n\nCharles Gaines\n\nXylor Jane\n\nSteffani Jemison\n\nAlfred Jensen\n\nEllen Lesperance\n\nChris Martin\n\nJohn O’Connor\n\nBruce Pearson\n\nLeslie Roberts\n\nJorinde Voigt\n\nMelvin Way\n\nGeorge Widener\n\nThe New Village: Ten Years of New York Fashion\n\nCurated by Jennifer Minniti, Chair, Fashion, and Matthew Linde, Ph.D.\n\nJanuary 22 – March 16, 2024\n\nPublic Reception: Thursday, February 8, 2024, from 6-8pm\n\nLearn more about the exhibition through the Exhibition Catalogue and the Virtual Tour.\n\nThe New Village: Ten Years of New York Fashion focuses on a scene of artists and fashion designers from the past ten years who have, in niche ways, re-established New York as a site for experimental fashion. By understanding the commercialism that has traditionally defined New York’s fashion industry, this exhibition points to an alternative history and suggests how an amorphous group of practitioners reshaped the fashion capital from the fringes.\n\nALL-IN\n\nBernadette Corporation x Supreme\n\nCamilla Carper\n\nCDLM\n\nCFGNY\n\nSusan Cianciolo\n\nEckhaus Latta\n\nGauntlett Cheng\n\nGiovanna Flores\n\nLou Dallas\n\nLUAR\n\nJessi Reaves\n\nSection 8\n\nSC103\n\nBeverly Semmes + CarWash Collective\n\nMartine Syms\n\nTelfar\n\nVaquera\n\nElena Velez\n\nWomen’s History Museum\n\nAmazonia\n\nBerta Sichel, Curator\n\nPatricia Capa, Assistant Curator\n\nSeptember 29 – December 9, 2023\n\nOpening Reception: Thursday, September 28, 6-8pm\n\nLearn more about the exhibition through the Exhibition Catalogue and the Virtual Tour.\n\nAmazonia builds on the premise that addressing environmental challenges requires both ecological knowledge and cultural articulation. Drawing inspiration from Greg Garrad’s book “Ecocriticism,” which offers critical insights into diverse perspectives on the natural environment, curator Berta Sichel and Patricia Capa, assistant curator, have crafted an engaging and thought-provoking experience that invites viewers to contemplate the complex relationship between humanity and nature.\n\nExhibiting Artists:\n\nJavier Andrada, Claudia Andujar, Barbara Brändli, Federico Guzmán and Andrés Corredor, KIMIKA, Margaret Mee / Malu De Martino, Susana Mejía, Simone Michelin, João Musa, pablo sanz, and Sergio Vega\n\nThere is a Certain Slant of Light\n\nCurated by Seph Rodney\n\nJune 21 – September 6, 2023\n\nOpening Reception: Tuesday, June 20, 6-8pm\n\nLearn more about the exhibition through the Exhibition Catalogue and the Virtual Tour.\n\nKate Butler, Guanqi Chen, Katie Croft, Naomi Frank, Devin B.

The selected artwork encourages viewers to appreciate the meaning and significance of light and to allow luminescence into their lives. The exhibition showcases a talented and diverse group of Pratt alumni, all of whom earned an M.F.A. in Fine Arts between 2018 and 2022.\n\nSeph Rodney, PhD, is a former senior critic and opinion editor for Hyperallergic. He has written for The New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, and other publications. He is featured on the podcast The American Age. His book, The Personalization of the Museum Visit, was published by Routledge in 2019. In 2020 he won the Rabkin Arts Journalism Prize. In 2022 he won the Andy Warhol Foundation Arts Writers Grant.\n\nDriving Creative: Pratt Institute, General Motors, and the Foundation of Industrial Design\n\nOn view: April 5-May 20, 2023\n\nLearn more about the exhibition through the Exhibition Brochure andVirtual Tour.\n\nThis exhibition highlights the enormously talented designers and sculptors, trained by Pratt and hired by General Motors Design, whose creative vision shaped the look of American life in the twentieth century, and the natural relationship formed between these two organizations in the 1940s that would result in an unimagined creative output that continues today.\n\nThis exhibition is presented in partnership with General Motors, Pratt Exhibitions, and Institutional Advancement.\n\nHsin-Chien Huang: The Data We Called Home\n\nCurated by Professor Linda Lauro-Lazin, assistant chair, Department of Digital Arts\n\nOpening reception: Thursday, September 22, 6-8 PM\n\nOn View: September 23, 2022 – March 4, 2023\n\nReal 2.0: Artists Discuss Immersive Art in the Virtual Landscape\n\nBarbara London moderates an expansive conversation on how artists have appropriated the medium of virtual reality to create immersive artworks.\n\nAlongside moderator Barbara London, panelists including Mattia Casalegno, Hsin-Chien Haung (via Zoom), and Rachel Rossin discuss the intersections of virtual reality, technology, body, mind, and art.\n\nThe panel Real 2.0 was recorded on January 30, 6:30pm (ET), in Room 201 at Pratt Institute on 144 West 14th Street.\n\nExhibition Catalog\n\nLearn more about the exhibition through the Exhibition Catalog and Virtual Tour.\n\nPratt Manhattan Gallery is pleased to announce its inaugural exhibition showcasing the work of multi-disciplinary artist Hsin-Chien Huang. The show opens on September 23, 2022 in Pratt Institute’s newly renovated gallery space at 144 W 14th Street in Chelsea.\n\nCurated by Linda Lauro-Lazin (Pratt Institute’s Assistant Chairperson of Digital Arts, Adjunct Professor), Hsin-Chien Huang: The Data We Called Home is the artist’s first New York City solo show. The exhibition will remap Taiwanese folklore, the ethics of digital surveillance, space exploration and the body-mind dichotomy across different media, and will feature a seminal collaboration with artist Laurie Anderson.\n\nThe exhibition will highlight the broad scope of Huang’s complex body of work, featuring virtual reality films, sculptures, and videos that present new perspectives on the immersive possibilities of mixed media art practices.\n\nSpecial thanks to the Taiwan Ministry of Culture; Taiwan Creative Content Agency; National Taiwan Normal University; Department of Cultural Affairs, Taipei City Government; Kaohsiung Film Archive; and Fou Gallery, Brooklyn, NY for supporting the artist\n\nVR hardware support provided by VIVE Studios and VIVE Arts\n\nArtist Bio:\n\nThe artist considers stories to be guides for reimagining his life. At the age of 4, Huang lost sight in his right eye. At 14, the cornea from a donor in Sri Lanka brought light back to the eye that had been veiled for a decade. Ever since then, the world he sees is in part through the eye of this unknown deceased person. This experience was extremely enlightening for the artist: life and flesh now seem interchangeable. His corporeal flesh no longer belonged to him; instead, it transformed into a mysterious vessel where one rests temporarily. After he came of age, he registered as an organ donor and imagined how the cornea in his right eye may continue its journey to another one’s body, continuing its gaze upon the world after his death.\n\nHuang brilliantly draws upon this sense of enlightenment to interpret stories through large-scale interactions between performance, mechanical apparatuses, algorithmic computations, and video installations that also reference history, and point to a greater potential for humanity. He is also committed to interdisciplinary STEAM education as a distinguished professor at the Department of Design, National Taiwan Normal University.\n\nIn recent years, Huang’s revolutionary VR works have attracted international attention and won a variety of awards. His VR film Chalkroom, made in collaboration with Laurie Anderson, won the Best VR Experience Award at the 74th Venice Film Festival in 2017. Bodyless won an Honorable Mention at the 2020 Ars Electronica Festival and the Golden Mask at the Newimages Festival in Paris. His new work Samsara won the Jury Award at the Texas SXSW Festival in the United States, Grand Prize for the Best VR Narrative at the Cannes Film Festival XR category and Honorary Mention in the Computer Animation category at Prix Ars Electronica.\n\nThe Work of Love, the Queer of Labor\n\nCurated by Olga Kopenkina\n\nOn View: June 24-August 20, 2022\n\nOpening Reception: Thursday June 23, 6-8 PM\n\nLearn more about the exhibition through the Exhibition Brochure and Virtual Tour.\n\n“The Work of Love, the Queer of Labor” is an exhibition of drawing, photography, video, posters, and installations that explores both historical and imagined connections between queer and left activism. By reviewing queer identities from the class perspective, and class identities ––through queer sensibilities, the artists in the show rediscover political potentialities within today’s LGBTQI+ cultural paradigm(s). The exhibition also links today’s queer activism to the history of gay and lesbian liberation movements, which entertained the faith that people can build a self-regulating worker’s society by liberating both love and labor––in opposition to a commodified and exploited homosexual body. The artists included in the show come from diverse geographic locations and historical backgrounds, such as South Africa, Russia, Estonia, USA, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Canada.\n\nExhibiting artists: Angela Beallor, Daughters of Bilitis/Kay Lahusen, Dyke Action Machine!, Yevgeniy Fiks, Gay Liberation Front/Peter Hujar, Hugo Gellert, Noam Gonick, Hagra, Harry Hay, William E.

Levy & Patricia Olynyk, with science writer Philip Ball, chemist Bart Kahr, artist Ursula Endlicher. Organized in collaboration with NY LASER talks.\n\nTo view the video from the talk, visit: Art Today: New Growth, New Form at Pratt Manhattan Gallery\n\nPresented at Pratt Institute’s Manhattan Gallery and curated by Ellen K. Levy, a multimedia artist, scholar, and past president of the College Art Association, “From Forces to Forms” explores the nature of form by engaging with the potent forces and processes of nature. By investigating how physical laws shape living and nonliving forms alike — ideas first proposed by D’ Arcy Thompson in his classic tome “On Growth and Form” (1917) — the exhibition explores universal principles of organismic development while delving into the flux and perturbations that characterize life today.\n\nReflecting Pratt Institute’s commitment to interdisciplinarity, “From Forces to Forms” features works by 19 artists and designers whose practices draw from both art and science and articulate a shared commitment to creating a more sustainable world. These works consider the implications of form generation through a variety of media (from analog to digital), at different scales (from subatomic to macroscopic), and in varied contexts (from prebiotic to ecosystems).\n\nIncluding Artists:\n\nRicci Albenda\n\nGemma Anderson\n\nTauba Auerbach\n\nLillian Ball\n\nAdam Brown and Robert Root-Bernstein\n\nMarta de Menezes and María Antonia González Valerio\n\nJanet Echelman\n\nUrsula Endlicher\n\nMaría Elena González\n\nHaresh Lalvani\n\nWilliam Lamson\n\nOliver Laric\n\nChristy Rupp\n\nTodd Siler\n\nPaul Thomas\n\nMeredith Tromble\n\nVictoria Vesna\n\n@prattexhibits #FromForcestoForms\n\nThis project was made possible in part by Pratt Institute’s STEAMplant Initiative.\n\n2021 Film/Video Senior Showcase and Community Quilt, Fashion Class of 2021\n\nPratt Institute Fashion Department: Windows (exterior) and Front Gallery\n\nPratt Institute Film/Video Department: West Gallery\n\nCommunity Quilt, Fashion Class of 2021\n\nJuly – October 2021\n\nCommunity Quilt celebrates the Pratt Fashion Department Class of 2021 and highlights three recent graduates, Samara Huggins, Keyin Wang, and Miray Atakan from July – October 2021.

Set against a backdrop of radical demographic change, the exhibition looks at how design can help people lead fuller, healthier, and more rewarding lives into old age, asking the question: how can designers meet the challenge of a rapidly aging society? From robotic clothing to driverless cars, this exhibition rethinks design approaches to aging.\n\nCurated by Jeremy Myerson, Helen Hamlyn Professor of Design at the Royal College of Art, the exhibition presents creative, provocative, and engaging concept designs across six themes: Ageing, Identity, Home, Community, Working, and Mobility.\n\nAlongside infographics, videos and existing physical exhibits, each section features a special design commission by a leading designer or design team.
