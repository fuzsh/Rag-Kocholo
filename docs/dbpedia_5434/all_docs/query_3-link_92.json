        "text": "Please share some good time stories, especially about what Bower & Gardner meant to you while you were there, friendships made, career choices offered, life situations while at the firm (marriage, children, etc.) Send them to Phyllis@personalfinancialcare.com\n\nLuis Rivera: I worked at Bower and Gardner from 1980-1987 in the Billing Department under Michelle Grossman.\n\nThinking back on my years there, I can honestly say that I have nothing but good memories of working at the firm. Till today, I can honestly say that it is still the best place that I have ever had the pleasure of working for!!! I am proud that I can say that I worked at Bower and Gardner!\n\nJoanne McQuillen: I worked at Bower & Garden from around 1983-1987, when I left to marry a teacher from New Jersey. I would have stayed at my job, which I loved, but we live on the shore and the commute was horrid. I worked for Janet Cohen, Ken Rashbaum, and others on the Bronx team. I was very friendly with Ann Federico. I absolutely loved working at Bower & Gardner, my best job ever. You hired me as a legal secretary, most of my experience was in insurance defense in Colorado, but you gave me a chance. Thank you, you made a difference for me. I’m Director of Nursing now for a non-profit home care agency in New Jersey. So, I was in the liquor store yesterday getting champagne for my son and his wife to help them celebrate their one year anniversary, and I was reminded of how oftentimes on a Friday afternoon Ann Federico and I would collect money from the attorneys for champagne and snacks (usually cheese and crackers) for one celebration or another. We were like a family. That prompted me to google Bower & Gardner and your reunion site came up. As soon as I saw your picture, and that of Sylvia Johnson, it brought me back to those wonderful memories, your email address was listed and I took a chance that I could catch up with you to thank you. Sylvia Johnson, too, she’s awesome. She actually came to visit me in Rockaway one Saturday and we went to the beach together. Do you remember how much paper we sent out with our Answers?! The discovery demands, counterclaims, etc. Once, a plaintiff’s attorney, who was calling for Janet, furiously asked me if Bower & Gardner had us weigh the package before we sent it to make sure we had enough demands in there! Bronx team secretaries shared a heavy duty stapler with New York and we were always running around looking for it. Ann, Janet Levine and I did an Order to Show Cause demanding one for Bronx and gave it to David Taback. We got our stapler!\n\nYou and the partners at Bower & Gardner were practicing transformational leadership before anyone knew what it was. We all felt valued and respected; we all worked together. As I said, my best job, ever, hands down. I was sitting on the beach with my sister, I think in the ’90’s, and read in the Times that the firm was closing. I was so sad.\n\nI worked as a legal secretary for a small general practice firm in Red Bank for about 20-25 years, went to LPN school at night, worked in a nursing home for 6 years while getting my RN degree. I worked in hospitals, acute rehab, home care. Now I’m Director for home care department of Family & Children’s Service in Long Branch. I love my job, but it’s difficult trying to keep everyone safe with COVID. Can’t wait until this is all behind us and we can go back to normal.\n\nEdward A. Rademaker: I am a former Bower and Gardner attorney who joined B&G after graduating from Fordham law school in 1993. Although my time at B&G was brief prior to the firm dissolving, I have good memories of my time there. I remember Catherine Baecher, who I shared an office with. I worked on my first case with Lenore Kalmus, who taught me how to prepare a case. Additionally, I remember Kevin O'Mara, who helped me find my next job (Flushing Hospital) after B&G.\n\nOn my way to a subsequent legal job on Wall Street, I was caught in the collapse of the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001. After I was resuscitated and recovered from my 9/11 injuries, I applied to the US JAG Corps and was appointed by the president to serve as a US JAG Corps captain, practicing military law. After serving in the military, I began my current job at Johnson & Johnson, practicing contract law.\n\nBeth Portnoy Bengualid: I was a nurse consultant at B&G from 1983-1990. I worked on the Mount Sinai team and had the honor of working with the best trial attorneys. The years there were certainly the most fun, challenging, and exciting times. To date, I remain close friends with some of my colleagues. Following B&G, I went to work at Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton as a nurse consultant for a national products liability case, then went on to do freelance with plaintiff lawyers. I married Marc, whom I met at B&G and we have three children and live in NYC.\n\n‎Bower And Gardner Facebook Page\n\nLuis F. Rivera: Wow ... this was my job ever, and still was and always will be my favorite place to have ever worked! I working here when I was a kid. Here I am today a grown married man and I still remember, and have nothing but fond memories of working at B & G! I can still remember all of the good people that I had the pleasure of meeting and getting to know. You rock B & G! Thank you.\n\nVidula Sheth: Started working with B&G in 1983 , out of law school . Remember talking with you followed by my interview with Mark Fienstien. The firm was located at a different location, then . Soon after, they moved to 110 E 59th (remember the big move) and I started working in the library, doing research, and handling all the library work, contacting experts etc. I had a wonderful time and could interact with everyone who came by. Learned a great deal. Cindy and Judy worked in the library with me . Later on came James Meese, who also worked in the library. They would all remember me as ‘Vy’. Had some great times. Remember having to look at all the material on ‘microfiche’ those days! In 1985 my son was born . Moved to California in 1987. Was sad to leave. When I went back to visit, 110 E, 59th I was surprised to hear that Bower and Gardner did not exist. When I go to NY, I still have great memories as I walk past 110 East. Did you ever hear from anyone else who worked in the library?\n\nSo happy to reconnect!\n\nIn California, I got my masters (LLM). Three children later (all went to college in\n\nNY), I am ready to get back to working for a wonderful place like B&G.\n\nThank you for this connection\n\nReceived September 21, 2011\n\nDorinda Angelo: I am soooo thrilled to have found this - I have been taking a stroll down memory lane and it's great. I was a Legal Nurse Consultant on the Brooklyn team with Liz Crea, Cathy Taaffe and Peggy Reiser. I remember we had lots of good times working on those cases and joking around but mostly I remember that I learned how to write!! I went back to graduate school in 2001 for a degree in Counseling Psychology and I am now a Licensed Professional Counselor in NJ (Bergen county). B&G will always have a place in my heart - great place with great people. Whenever I'm in the city and in the 'neighborhood', I pass by the old building on 59th. Good times!!\n\nPamela Webster: I started at B & G in the late 80's. My son was a little guy and I was transitioning from medical secretary hospital to lega. I was hired by Linda; training by Charla and Ann \"F\" was my immediate supervisor (go Bronx team). Who could have guessed all that great training would have led me to where I am today (office manager of Shapiro, Beilly, Rosenberg & Aronowitz, LLP). I had the pleasure of working with Mary \"K\", Alice, Cindy \"L\" Sylvere Hyacinth, Bob Betz, Peter D. Assai and Karen \"G\". The list could go on.\n\nThanks for my future, B & G.\n\nLarry Schwartz: I have an overwhelming number of recollections of\n\nB&G. Starting with being greeted by ShaRon on my first interview for a\n\nsummer internship, being introduced to \"Cal\" Adelman and having any one of\n\nour numerous office chats, working with Cal and Linda, sharing a hot dog\n\nwith Dick Caplan, going to Vaduz Liechtenstein on B&G business and working\n\nwith Larry Shanahan and Mel Altman, goofing around with Richie Rubin,\n\nlistening to a lesson on Northern Ireland from Vicki McFaddyn (where is she\n\ntoday?), attending an internal conference and having Stanley Fink make fun\n\nof me as I used the word \"like\" too many times in my presentation (a favor I\n\nnow return on my sons), the list goes on and on.\n\nOf course I remember you and how you seemed to have an infinite amount of\n\npatience in resolving the conflicts and staffing issues. Always even\n\ntempered and approachable.\n\nI started with B&G as a summer associate in 1982 and then as a junior\n\nassociate after graduating Law School in 1983. I worked about 9 years at B&G\n\nbefore moving to Kern Augustine Conroy & Schoppmann, Esq. I retired from the\n\npractice of law about 3 years later and worked for about 2 years as a stage\n\nmanager for PrimaLux Video, Inc., while returning to school and learning\n\nskills as a web developer. I did freelance work developing web sites for\n\nseveral years, then later worked for a software consulting firm until\n\nfinding a more permanent home in 1999 as a software engineer at Moody's\n\nInvestors Services, NY.\n\nI was promoted to a software management position at Moody's and worked there\n\nfor 7 years until I retired this July. I am now in training for my first\n\ntriathlon and live with my wife and two high school boys in New Jersey.\n\nI was very saddened to see many familiar names of people I worked with who\n\nare no longer with us. I think the web site is a wonderful idea and has\n\nsparked many memories for me. How I would love to sit down at a a table and\n\nhave a few beers today with Robert \"Cal\" Adelman (who wouldn't), Vicki\n\nMcFaddyn, Dick Caplan, Phil Lerner, Larry Shanahan, Vic Starsia, gosh the\n\nlist could go on and on....\n\nLydia Zambrano: The times at B&G were the best!!!! I went from a little scared trainee to be the night staff supervisor, to working with Bill Quirk to working with Joan Berk, and Team 2, to working in the LI firm to going back to B & G to work with Marc Bengualid and Linda Padilla and so on, and everybody else.\n\nPhyllis, you were the best Manager ever. I remember when I went for the interview in 1980 and you asked me the difference between an affirmation and an affidavit, and the different between Order with Notice of Entry and Order with Notice of Settlement. Believe you me, I have never forgotten the difference. I learned so much from Bower & Gardner, it was the best training, especially with Jim Howell, and Sylvia Johnson. That training has gotten me a long way and made me a great worker. Thanks to the B & G days.\n\nEthel Westphal: I am an ex employee from B & G. I started out working in Word Processing and then worked for Marty Heller & Alan Katz. About a year after working with them I transferred and began working for Robert Deutsch, Robin Gregory and Lisa Iannone. I also worked for Norman Weitzman and Robin Schair.\n\nLinda Padilla-Diaz: You cannot believe how happy I am to hear about the reunion. It was definitely a great place to work and I hold many great memories from there. I still remember my first interview with you back in 1986 and your smile. I look forward to seeing you at the reunion. I have downloaded the summons and will send my check. See you then!\n\nCharla Thompson: Let's see, I started at B&G in 1987 and left in 1994 ort 1995, can't remember exactly. I thank you again for allowing me to have one of the greatest jobs of my life -- I never found one that matched it. It was so wonderful to receive this e-mail from my niece, Sheryl Simmons, a paralegal, telling of the reunion. I plan on attending. I would like to say that my greatest memories at B&G was first, your seeing my potential to take charge and do a good job, ergo, allowing me to direct some of the activities of the secretarial pool. It was the greatest adrenaline pump of my life and only but a few Mondays, did I ever say, Ugh, today's Monday, I've got to go to work. I really enjoyed working at B&G. The memories are great -- even my son, who happens to be going on 23 years old now, remembers the picnics and the company perks that he was even privileged to partake in -- more specifically, the baseball games wherein his first he sat on the shoulders of John O'Brien in the box seat right up close to the field. The people always made B&G great and you learned to take the good, the bad and the ugly -- suck it up -- and get the job done!\n\nJackie Schettini-O'Brien: I started working at B&G in August of 1985 I wasn't even 19 years old yet. I made so many friends. The one thing that sticks out in my mind about B&G was the wonderful way Linda Oppenheimer trained me in the secretarial pool. She was so pleasant and patient. I was young and scared and no matter how many questions I had she was always sweet and pleasant with me and explained whatever I needed to know. She made good secretaries out of us, because she was very thorough. I always had to hug and kiss her and thank you for being so patient with me. I still have her notes in my binder that I kept all these years. I hope I can see her at the reunion. I could get emotional right now looking back at all the years at B&G, all the attorneys I worked for, all the friends I made. I had my first two babies there, Matt & Johnny and the girls threw me a baby shower each time. We were all like a family, at least that's how I genuinely felt. It feels so good to see the same people now after all these years. My most special memory of Bower & Gardner is that I met my husband there. Who would have known back then that we were going to be married this long and have 4 children? John is a great guy, and I am very lucky to have him. He is a wonderful father and husband and I'm glad I met him at B&G. I enjoyed working there. B&G will always be a part of my life.\n\nKim J. Lomax: The memories most vivid to me are unique to my work experiences there. For instance, I remember my first assignment, working for Debbie DelSordo. She was a powerhouse who used to keep me neck deep in dictation tapes! I thought she could really roll out those tapes until I began working for Ginny Futterman. Oh my! My tape count was never less than 12! (No matter how fast I typed!) I remember Bill Quirk and his \"quirky\" personality. I'll never forget the time Debbie DelSordo and one of the partners got Bill a stripper for his birthday and tricked him into the conference room for it. I remember working 24 hours straight for Warren Sanger's Angel of Death trial!\n\nMaria Santiago: I am really looking forward to this and yes, it brings back wonderful memories of everyone. Even the people that are no longer with us, will be with us in our hearts. I will never forget my years at B&G and the wealth of knowledge I took with me when I left. Phyllis and Dan made sure we were well prepared for the outside world, and that I thank you for that.\n\nRosalie Corradina-Tocman: B & G was a great place to work. I forged some great friendships there and still remain in touch with Linda Fielding, Joan Prince, Yvonne Derry, Diane Gmitter-Pell, Jeni McGowan. The good times and good friends were many. I started at B&G in January 1971. I had just turned 22. There were six partners and about 4 attorneys. Barry Penneycooke ran the xerox machine. Ruthie Ferguson was in the mailroom. We had a department of investigators, former nyc retired policemen - Mr. Medes, Oliveri, Joe (I forget his last name, I believe it started with a \"S\". Philip Josezwitz was the calendar clerk, Dottie was the receptionist. I was hired by a Claire Garrity. Then Mr. Abe Jackness took her place as Managing Attorney. Mr. Levy was also a Calendar Clerk. We had people of every age employed at B&G. The firm was small, but a cohesive group were we. I learned about the law and life in my formative years at B&G. It is so funny to see Dan Siff's son Andrew on TV as a Channel 4 news reporter. I remember him as a little boy who would come visit his dad, Dan at the office. Eva Ramirez was also a good friend at B& G. I still talk about the bizarre cases I worked. I am forever grateful to Dan and John Gardner who saw in me the potential to be more than \"just a secretary.\" I am now an independent contractor working for various attorneys representing their clients at closings, handling bank closings and I am also a title closer. A far cry from litigation and medical mal, products, etc., but interesting nonetheless. When I started B & G, I had just turned 22. That was in January 1971. I worked for Claire Garrity, an attorney who was originally from Boston. She left and then Abe Jackness came into the picture as Managing Attorney. From Abe I went to Dan Siff, Managing Partner. After working for Dan a while, he suggested (or rather he said that I was going to have to work for John Gardner). I, like everyone else was afraid of JG. Mr. Gardner approached me and said \"kid, with your memory and my vocabulary you'll go far. Even with this encouragement, I was reluctant. One day Dan said its time. All I had to do was change my desk drawers from one desk to another and the change was made. I never regretted the opportunity that both Dan and JG gave me. I have fond memories of my life at B & G, through a first marriage, a baby, divorce and second marriage. I grew up at B & G, but have been growing old elsewhere. I am looking forward to seeing many of my friends.\n\nSusan Scherman: I recall being sent down to New Orleans for the week long Risk Management Conference and being trained \"the right way\" by Bower & Gardner. I learned so much in the B & G orientation in my first year that I never received from any other law firm. I've worked for 3 firms so far. Getting out to all the hospitals and working with all the NYC/HHC risk managers was very interesting and gave me a lot of hospital troubleshooting experience. I'm grateful for the experience. There has never been a firm like it.\n\nPavina Kootrakul: I'm so glad to hear about the re-union. My memory of Bower & Gardner has always been one of the best memory in my lifetime and I am glad that you sacrificed your time to try to bring all of us back together again. I've read on some of the comments friends wrote on B&G webpage and all of them are so true. Thanks to B&G. I myself started my legal experience and knowledge at B&G. I have always consider B&G my home, not my workplace and all my friends there family members, rather than just work related acquaintances.\n\nMindy Unger: I started working at B&G in June of 1980 and was there until the bitter(sweet) end. I came to Aaronson Rappaport immediately after B&G closed and have been there ever since. I made some lifelong friends there and fortunately for me, I get to see some of them every day at work. When my son David was bar mitzvahed 10 years ago (ouch!), I even had a B&G table. Some of the highlights I have were of meeting some celebrities at the firm through the commercial team: Billy Joel, Julia Louise-Dreyfuss and the late great Ginger Rogers (who was so sweet to me). I will also never forget being treated to lunch by the late Victor Condello at his regular restaurant \"21.\" We ate downstairs in the \"celebrity room\" and the owner greeted us and introduced us to some of the famous people eating near us I loved working at B&G and look forward to the reunion. By the way, Pat Kenny, if you're reading this, remember that Secretary's Day lunch you promised me back in 1981? I'm still waiting!!\n\nJeannette Velez-Roman: This is Jeannette Velez-Roman, Esther's Daughter. I was known by the name of Jeannie. When I heard about the reunion I was really excited. Although I worked at B & G for the summers, I could remember all the great memories I had and all the friends I made. I used to work in the Mail Room with Esther Medina, my aunt and Norma. I currently live in Virgina with my husband Jerry, married for 7 years and my 2 beautiful and wonderful sons, Aaron 11 and Kyle 6 years old. I currently work as an Admin Support and a Spanish Interpreter for the Prince William County Department of Social Services. I have been working there for almost 4 years and it's great. I can't wait to see everyone at the reunion that I knew when I used to work there or when I visited my mother at the office.\n\nDiane Williams: When I left B&G I was working with Gerry DiEdwards and Joe Stavola, they were the best !!!!! I live in Rye , NY , the same town as Gerry DiEdwards who is a named partner at Schiavetti's office. Gerry looks great and has quite a family. In July of this year I spoke to Joe Stavola from Greensboro , North Carolina via email. Joe is alive, well, still very handsome and a named partner at his firm of Sharpless & Stavola.\n\nTommy Lee: What a time I had there. I was there in 86 right out of high school and worked with John O'Brien (aka Opie aka Disco Dancer) in central files and graduated to be his assistant. Thereafter, I worked as a paralegal with Team 8, thanks to Susan Etra's pull. Imagine working with over 30 of your friends from central files and the mailroom, going to lunch in central park, having liquid lunches at Blarney Stone, rolling dices and flipping coins in the basement, getting paged by Roe Falco when you hanging in the park, eating Esther's home cooking, drinking some spirits with Val, making ice-teas in the dumbwaiters, and, not but least, getting paid on Friday and going to the Copa with the crew. Oh, I forgot to mention ripping up the request cards and throwing away the mail - (only kidding.) The X-mas parties were also great, as was the Krucker picnics (I hope to share the 2 videos from the 88-89 picnics on line) Unfortunately, the partners got greedy, I mean, filed bankruptcy and it all ended (only kidding.) I worked until the end, and helped put the padlocks on the doors. I was rewarded with a bonus and 6 months of vacation from unemployment. I'm happy to report that life is still wonderful with the addition of my two daughters, Chynna and Gianna, with Suzanne. I am still working as a paralegal and have also launched an urban clothing line called AmeriKan LYFF (Live Your Full Fantasy) One World, One Life, AmeriKan LYFF - Don't forget to unwrap the gift! Hope to catch up with you all.\n\nDiane Gmitter: I came to B&G in 1980 at the very strong recommendation of my good friends, Maryellen (Kreinbihl) and Barbara (Caruso) O'Connell. Some of you may remember me as Diane Gmitter and others as Diane Pell. I was married during my 14 years at B&G and I remember many of you attended my wedding in 1987. I am now married 18 years with a 17-year-old son, Mark. He is now a senior in Ocean Lakes High School in Virginia Beach where we have lived for 11 years. Yes, right after I left B&G in 1994, we moved to Virginia Beach and love it down here. I have worked for three firms here and have finally found one, Taylor & Walker, P.C. (5 years plus), that I feel comfortable in (as comfortable and happy as I was at B&G), although it is not quite as large. I still keep in touch with some of my old friends at B&G - Maryellen & Barbara (of course), also - Terry Favret and Rosalie Tocman. I remember many of my old \"bosses\" at B&G - namely, Tom Bower, Janet Winter, Gary Barbanel, Sandra Bentley, John O'Kelly (who I also still keep in touch with), Phil Lerner, just to name a few. Looking forward to seeing all my old friends and acquaintances again and fondly remembering those who have passed on.\n\nJanet Wise-Varrassi: I was hired by Phyllis in 1979 as p/t personnel assistant and later worked as a receptionist; eventually going full time in the HR department until I married and moved away in 1985. Many fond and fun memories at B&G but always the biggest take away was the opportunity to meet and work with wonderful people and the best manager, mentor I ever had - and that remains Phyllis! I personally and professionally grew (as did the firm) under the outstanding leadership and tutelage of Phyllis for which I remain forever grateful!\n\nJanis Bromfeld: I was overjoyed to see the site you started. I still miss Bower and Gardner... genuinely the best place at which I ever worked. I still long for the old days when I was working for Bill Spratt and Peter Bower. My husband and I are raising our two wonderful kids on the south shore of Long Island, and I am working part-time at the local library, though considering a return to the law once my kids are a bit older. Very sad to see the names of those who have left us. Also terrible to learn of the death of so many young and vital people... shocked at news of the passing of Joan Corrigan and Susan Feltman, among so many others.\n\nJacqueline Stein: When all is said and done, I still think of B&G as the best learning experience I ever could have had. I still remember Val coming into my office the day I was admitted to practice at 5pm and dropping 8 Redwelds on my floor for oral argument the next day. For a new lawyer, Bower and Gardner was the ultimate \"hit the ground running\" experience, and has always stood me in good stead. I know a lot of former B&G lawyers who agree. In March of 2003 I became Corporate Claims Counsel for the New York City Health & Hospitals Corporation, a truly challenging and rewarding position. In a \"small-world\" turn of events, our Senior Director of Corporate Risk Management is Joanne Haberlin, another B&G alum. We often reminisce about those years!\n\nGerry Feinberg: I was at B&G from 85 till the end. After I became a partner around 1989 or 1990 I was involved in the hiring process in the commercial litigation area as well as a review of associates for raises. The interesting thing that I remember is that even though B&G was not paying salaries as high as could be gotten at other firms, we had very little turnover of our attorneys. It was almost as though you had to push someone out the door if you wanted to get rid of them. I remember having a conversation about this very subject and the only thing we could come up with was that the people enjoyed working there so much, they were not interested in leaving even if it meant they could earn more. In line with this thought, around that time the firm was going though some austerity measures and decided not to have an our annual Christmas party. since this was always the opportunity for the attorneys and staff to meet and greet and learn about others in the firm I thought this was a shame. So I organized a \"pirate \" Christmas party. We rented a club , caterer, music and solicited a nominal sum of maybe 20 or 25 dollars from anyone who wanted to attend. When it looked like we were running short, Dan Brecher made an excess contribution. We had perhaps almost two hundred attend, a testament to the camaraderie at the firm. And a good time was had by all. P. S. I still carry my B& G litigation bag.\n\nDan Brecher: I joined Bower & Gardner in 1987 as a partner running the Investment Banking Department; a business that B & G was unfamiliar with, but that Stanley Fink wanted to learn about; and boy was he a quick study.\n\nAs you know, Stanley was a leader by personality, with a ready and biting wit. It was interesting to have breakfast meetings with him, which were usually at the Regency...power breakfasts, at which politicians would come over to the table to say hello. I remember David Dinkins coming over one morning, bowing and kissing Stanley's hand. A former Governor came over and, joking, asked if their was a job for him at the firm. Together, Stanley and I worked on and developed some very interesting clients, and the partners made a lot of money on one of the most exciting deals for a company we formed that included no less than three Nobel Laureates on the Board of Directors. But that is another story.\n\nI met my wife, Angela Ortiz, at the Firm; so, naturally, despite other issues, my mind's picture of my time at the Firm has a romantic tint.\n\nAngela and I have a remarkable 4 year old daughter: Maya Angela Brecher. Maya will certainly hear from me how I met her beautiful mother at Bower & Gardner. I also met good friends, like Steve Taub, Gerry Feinberg and Mike Ziegler at the firm; and there are a number of wonderful people at B & G that I would enjoy seeing again so we could laugh (or cry) or just reminisce about old times. B & G threw great parties. Time for another one.\n\nPauline Kurtzman: I had worked in many offices before coming to B&G but never did I have such a positive experience. It was a warm, friendly place with lots of wonderful people. We all worked hard and were very much appreciated. I think about those years 1980-1994 all the time and about the people I worked with. I spent those years with Kevin D. Porter and after that at two other firms, and now, though I am retired I am still in touch with him. I would love to attend the reunion.\n\nJoan Prince: I remember when I started in 1977, the firm was so small that my son, Kajli would call and ask to speak to my mommy and they would know who his mommy was. I was hired by Carol Sabella who believed in me from Day I she knew I had IT Carol passed a couple years after that. My memories of B&G are mostly great Where else could I have come down the elevator with Ginger Rogers and dance with her in the Lobby? Run into a whole bunch of NY Yankees? Eyeball Billy Joel and many, many more! A few days after I started, I remember coming down the elevator one evening with this man who wanted to know why I was working so late if I liked the people I worked with etc., etc., and I started getting vex with his line of questioning and said to him who the hell do you think you are Bower or Gardner? And his reply was Gardner well, I knew he was going to fire me the next day but no, it was the beginning of a love relationship I truly respected Mr. Gardner, who for some reason always called me Mrs. Prince. I left B&G in 1988 when I moved to Rockland County in the same area where a few of the attorneys live John Gardner, Mark Aaronson, Jesse Graham (used to?), Alan Friedberg, to name a few. I have lost track of so many Marybeth? Lori Kamaiko? Bambi? Alan Bernstein? Bill Spratt? hope to see you Diane Gmitter (we had so much fun at your wedding). Over time I have ran into Michael Futterman, Susan Shaeffer and, of course, the ones who live in my area. My 3 sons are all very successful (Doctor, lawyer & the last one who was a B&G birth runs a computer business). I left B&G when I moved to Rockland and was hired over the phone by an attorney who asked me to start right away once I told him I had worked at B&G . Anyone who is anybody knows B&G and RESPECT is felt immediately when the name is mentioned. I am now an Associate Broker and a Top Producer in the No.1 firm in the Hudson Valley , Prudential Rand Realty real estate has been very good to me. I ran into Barbara O'Connell who is also an agent in one of our Westchester offices. My friend for life, Rosalie Tocman, has worked with me when a family member was looking to relocate in Rockland County . I remained in touch with Zandrine Edwards (I knew several members of Zandrine's family who are from the island of Grenada where my husband is from). ..Oh yes, I am still married to the same man. Lillian Richman would have been happy to hear that .She taught me so much her writing skills and her ability to use Webster to the fullest Love you Lillian Oh my goodness, David Richman I still remember David's birth date the Ides of March (year not important). So many are no longer here I don't understand.\n\nCindy Sostchen: I agree with everyone's assessment that working at B&G was the best as far as training for the \"real world.\" When Jim Howell was running the pool it ran like a well-oiled machine - I learned so much. You had a knack for hiring people - I don't see that type of dedication these days in the legal arena, either from the new lawyers or secretaries.\n\nI also credit you with helping me get over my fear of the computer. I remember you put me in a class with only 2 people so that I could learn it - I was so resistant to change then. How did we ever work with typewriters? I remember we used to pray that the attorney wouldn't change anything so we could spare the page. That was impossible to do when doing an Andy Sears EBT report!!\n\nThe memories continue. I find myself thinking about people and events that I haven't in years. This is going to be some great event!\n\nZandrine Edwards: I started working at B&G in the secretarial pool where I was trained by Jim Howell (THE BEST). He was a wonderful person, so gentle and thoughtful. From there I was transferred to work with Jay Rappaport's team, initially to work with Phil Foley (who I still keep in touch with). He is now living in Florida. After Phil moved to Boston, I worked with Peter Bower and Jay. The people I met there will always be in my heart and thoughts. I am currently working with Julien & Schlesinger. When I was interviewed for this job, the office manager told me that once she saw I had worked at B&G her decision was made because B&G had the greatest reputation in the New York area.\n\nSandra DeFazio: I started working at B&G in 1983 and trained under the very watchful but supportive Sylvia Johnson. I was then transferred to the pool to await an assignment. Jim Howell was such a nice man - I will never forget him. After my small stint in the pool, I was assigned to Bill Quirk and worked with him for the 8 years I spent at B&G. I also worked with a wonderful group of people on Team 2 which I was proud to be a member of as it was considered the best working team in the firm - thanks to all. I also had both my children while at B&G. Jason is now 18 and in his freshman year at CSI. Michelle is 16 and was accepted into the Academy of Finance Program at Tottenville High School. My husband Sal and I celebrate our 19th wedding anniversary on 10/31 - yes Halloween! After leaving B&G, I went to work at the firm of Smith Mazure and was promoted to secretarial supervisor. After 9/11, I left the firm and was a stay at home mom for 3 years. I am now working at Kral Clerkin as a secretary. My best memories at B&G - lunches with Joan Corrigan (I was saddened on learning of her passing) and Christmas lunch at the NY AC. I'm very much looking forward to this reunion!!!\n\nTicia Pierce Parente: After interviewing with Dan Siff, I joined the firm in 1974. There were only 7 partners and approximately 40 support and clerical staff. We were like a family then and what I appreciated most, since I was experienced, was their allowing me the autonomy to do what needed to be done without supervision which occasionally included the practice of law. When I left in 1987, the firm had increased it's partnership by leaps and bounds and it's staff had grown to well over 600 employees probably touching the 700 mark. Because of that growth it had become a different place.\n\nKenneth Soto: I worked at B&G from 1986 - 1988, after which I moved on to D'Amato & Lynch. I started in their mailroom and worked my way up the ranks from billing to accounting and my final resting place was the IT department, while at D'Amato & Lynch I was the Network Administrator Assistant to the IT Director Delores F. Browne. I worked for D&L for 12 1/2 years before I moved to Florida. I lived there for a year and came back to New York to be close to my three children. I am currently at Martin Clearwater & Bell. I work in their IT department were I run the Help Desk and assist the Network Administrator and IT Director.\n\nWhat can I say about Bower & Gardner it was my first job and it changed my life by showing me a different way of living, changing the direction in which I was going. To where I was going and what I wanted to do in life. I will always look back in my days at Bower Gardner with bright eyes and fondness."
