I am also a single mother, a daughter, a sister , aunt and friend. I strongly believe in creating a space were the client feels free to be themselves. My coaching sessions are all about the clients agenda not mine. I believe we were created with a purpose, we are all unique human beings with different experiences and journey in life. We all have a choice to create and make changes in our lives whether we are aware of it or not, we are always making a choice one way or the other. We all can learn from one another and appreciate others for who they are. We are all spiritual being and we are well connected. I believe in working together to better this world, one person at a time."
