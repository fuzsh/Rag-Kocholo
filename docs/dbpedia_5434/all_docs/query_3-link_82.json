        "text": "AANHPI refers to Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders, an expansion of the original AAPI (Asian American and Pacific Islanders), the segment of the US population that is honored in May. According to the latest census, there are approximately 24 million Asian Americans, the fastest growing demographic. At 1.6 million, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders are the third fastest growing demographic.\n\nWith such formidable numbers, AANHPIs' contributions to American society cannot be ignored. From high tech to health care to public service, social services, arts and entertainment, we are a force to reckon with. And we are here to stay even if anti-Asian hate (the buzzword for racism directed at people who look like us) is on the rise.\n\nWe celebrate this month by honoring the generations of AANHPIs who came before us and who had to suffer and struggle to find their place in the American tapestry. To them who paved the way, we offer our undying gratitude.\n\n*******"
