        "text": "For his part, Bunbury grew not only as a singer, refining his style and stage persona, but as an exceptional lyricist. Paired with an electrifying live show, each of the band's recordings subsequent to its debut went to the top of the Spanish charts and entered the Top Five in other European countries as well. The group took on a more aggressive sound for their final two studio recordings, El Espíritu del Vino (1993) and Avalancha (1996), both of which went multi-platinum as well. He released the (now triple-platinum) classic Senderos de Traición in 1990. It hit number 56 on the Spanish chart and received solid airplay. The group's pop debut, El Mar No Cesa, appeared in 1988. The second notion was that change itself is a primary engine of creativity. Heroes del Silencio - one of rock en español's architect bands - provided Bunbury with twin models that would guide him throughout his career: first was the melding of his wide range of rock, pop, classical, folk, and Gypsy influences in a manner that would underscore - and not water down - his Spanish-Latino identity. He dropped his first name when he joined guitarist Juan Valdivia in 1986 to form and front the rock band Héroes del Silencio, along with bassist Joaquin Cardiel and drummer Pedro Andreu. He sang lead in a high school rock band called Apocalipsis, and later joined Proceso Entrópico. For 2017's Expectativas, the singer took home his first solo Latin Grammy for Album of the Year.īunbury was born in Zaragoza and took to rock & roll and Spain's own glorious musical traditions with equal enthusiasm. 2015's MTV Unplugged: El Libro de Las Mutaciones featured appearances from Draco Rosa, Carla Morrison, Vetusta Morla, and Pepe Aguilar, and topped the international charts. After releasing his smash Las Consecuencias in 2010, Bunbury bought a house in Los Angeles where he lives half the time. It showcased Bunbury's passionate baritone in songs that melded Middle Eastern, cabaret, caballero, blues, flamenco, milonga, bolero, cumbia, electro, roots and garage rock, heavy metal, and electronic genres. He crossed the pop chart pantheon with 2008's Hellville de Luxe, produced by Roxy Music's Phil Manzanera. He has gained legions of fans across Europe and the Americas. He came across to Anglo audiences as a dead cross between Scott Walker, Joe Strummer, and Iggy Pop, an intense, questioning, mercurial artist who followed a labyrinthine musical path. Bunbury emerged as a solo artist with Radical Sonora, delivering his passions, aspirations, loves, and failures through a wider range of sounds. As frontman for Heroes del Silencio, Bunbury's diverse songwriting skills and empassioned singing on their 1988 multiplatinum debut El Mar No Cesa to their final chart-topping studio outing Avalancha in 1995, their meld of folk traditions, punk, new wave, indie rock, and pop paved the way for countless artists. The godfather of rock en español in his native Spain, singer and songwriter Enrique Bunbury is among the most successful musical artists to emerge from Western Europe in the late 20th century."
