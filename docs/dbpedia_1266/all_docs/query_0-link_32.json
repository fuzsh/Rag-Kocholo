After adopting the nickname of Bunbury, taken from the Oscar Wilde stage play The Importance of Being Earnest, the musician teamed up with Héroes del Silencio, becoming a major number in the Hispanic rock scene. The band eventually broke up in 1996 and Bunbury started his solo career in 1997 with an electro-rock album, Radical Sonora with his new band: Copi (piano), Del Moran (bass), Ramon Gacias (drums) and former Héroes del Silencio guitarist Alan Boguslavsky. Recognized by his wish to always reinvent himself, Bunbury released in 1999 the album Pequeño, which sounded very different from anything he did before. His band also suffered changes, Boguslavsky was replaced by Rafa Dominguez, and the new faces, Ana Belén Estaje (violin), Luis Miguel Romero (percussion), Javier Iñigo, Javier Garcia Vega & Antonio Ríos in the metal instruments. This band was known as the \"Huracán Ambulante\" (\"Wandering Hurricane\") and recorded with Bunbury the rest of his solo discography. « hide"
