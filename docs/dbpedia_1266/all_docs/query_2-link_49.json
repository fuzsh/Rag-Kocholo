        "text": "Eye-Openers We have all come through incidents in our lives which serve as eye-openers to us. What exactly is an eye-opener, and how is it transformative rather than being just a change in our lives? A conflict that we are prejudiced on, in which we think we are right, but in spite of the other party's misrepresentations or faults, there's a solid truth behind something that we need to learn and change - is an example of an eye-opener. Even though what the other might have done was wrong, there was still something strong in the situation that we need learn from, is the key here. Eye-openers can break us internally! We might have been hard-nosed in the past about certain notions, but the incident would transform us completely that we look at the world in a totally different frame! It has occurred to me once and I have become a transformed person in one aspect of life. At the end of the day, it is all about inclusivity that these eye-openers would lead to. We put ourselves in small circles or boundaries that we refuse to see the overall picture or the point of view - be it dealing with human beings or the broader universe including the inanimate. Eye-openers typically work towards inclusivity, towards having a broader picture of the world around us. What kind of eye-openers have you had in your lives? Did they happen because of your own realization or were they because of someone's advice or suggestion? Feel free to comment below. In my book 'A Pebble Unlistened', I have brought in a few eye-opener incidents across the short stories. Please feel free to grab it through Kindle Unlimited or buy it to learn about these eye-openers.

One, I am helping the writer become more confident with the personal studio inside their head, so they can appreciate that the unique ways they think the world are worth sharing. Two, I give them strategies that simplify the writing process. Bono, in his memoir, Surrender, says it this way: ‚ÄúSongs so simple even I might be able to write one.‚Äù What Bono has captured is that profound paradox of wanting to write but worrying whether you are good enough. Professor Sean, please teach me so that ‚Äúeven I‚Äù can write? That's what your students are really asking of you in their heart of hearts. #teachingandlearning #principals #teaching #teachers #writing #criticalthinking #essentialskills #education\n\nI don't think I've ever seen an article designed so specifically to make me mad üòÇ It's true that people used to read out loud a lot more. But that doesn't mean we've lost something essential about reading. Sure, at one point, the Ancient Romans didn't have punctuation, so reading out loud was part of working out what the text actually said. And sure, by the time (the early modern period) that book ownership was accessible, literacy rates still weren't very high among the masses. The folks who could read read out loud for the benefit of people who couldn't. But, if there's anything that my research *in the history of reading habits* tells us, it's that reading habits change. They change because *we* change. They change because the way we relate to our texts, to our media, is always evolving. I love reading out loud. I love physical books. I text people using complete sentences. But there is no benefit to arguing that \"we used to to it differently, so that means what we're doing now is wrong.\" People will say things like, \"Kids don't want to read anymore\" (not true) and then argue that it's only reading if you do it in a certain way. They think they're the old guard, protecting a treasured past from being forgotten. What they're really doing is gatekeeping one of the most important tools for building empathy for other human beings. Making appeal-to-tradition arguments may get you into The Atlantic, but it doesn't make you right.\n\nWe‚Äôre all reading wrong, Alexandra Moe writes. ‚ÄúWe should be doing it out loud, all the time, with everyone we know.‚Äù‚Å† https://lnkd.in/ebGkpbBU ‚Å† ‚ÄúReading, while not technically medicine, is a fundamentally wholesome activity. It can prevent cognitive decline, improve sleep, and lower blood pressure,‚Äù Moe writes. ‚ÄúPeople have intuitively understood reading‚Äôs benefits for thousands of years ‚Ä¶ But the ancients read differently than we do today. Until approximately the tenth century ‚Ä¶ reading was synonymous with reading aloud. Silent reading was terribly strange, and, frankly, missed the point of sharing words to entertain, educate, and bond.‚Äù‚Å† ‚Å† Although those early readers didn‚Äôt know it, verbal reading can boost someone‚Äôs mood and their ability to recall. ‚ÄúIt can lower parents‚Äô stress and increase their warmth and sensitivity toward their children,‚Äù Moe continues. Reading out loud ‚Äúinvolves several operations‚Äîmotor control, hearing, and self-reference (the fact that you said it)‚Äîall of which activate the hippocampus, a brain region associated with episodic memory ‚Ä¶ So although you might enjoy an audiobook narrated by Meryl Streep, you would remember it better if you read parts of it out loud.‚Äù‚Å† ‚Å† And you don‚Äôt need an audience to read out loud. ‚ÄúPlenty of solitary vocal reading no doubt consists of deciphering recipes and proofreading work emails, but if you want to reap the full perks, the best selections are poetry and literature,‚Äù Moe continues. ‚ÄúThese genres provide access to facets of human experience that can be otherwise unreachable, which helps us process our own emotions and memories.‚Äù ‚Å† ‚Å† ‚ÄúHearing words read aloud to you also has unique advantages, especially for kids. Storytelling has been shown to increase hospitalized children‚Äôs levels of oxytocin while decreasing cortisol and pain,‚Äù Moe continues at the link in our bio. And ‚Äúanecdotal evidence suggests that adults, too, can benefit from such listening ‚Ä¶ The health benefits of reading aloud are so profound that some doctors in England now refer their chronic-pain patients to read-aloud groups.‚Äù‚Å† Learn more: https://lnkd.in/ebGkpbBU ‚Å† üì∏: Tony Evans / Getty"
