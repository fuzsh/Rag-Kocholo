Los vapores que entraban al centro preescolar de Martha Beatriz León en las afueras de Tecate, México, olían mucho peor de lo habitual, como a basura podrida. O tal vez era amoníaco. Una mujer lo comparó con el olor de la pólvora gastada. Fuera lo que fuese, León dijo que […]\n\nEnvironment\n\nCalifornia exports the risk from its hazardous waste. One neighborhood in Mexico shows the consequences\n\nAn ongoing CalMatters investigation has shown how California companies and governments avoid the Golden State's strict environmental regulations by shipping toxic waste across state borders. New reporting shows how California exports the risk to Mexico.\n\nEnvironment\n\nToxic trash: California’s aging hazardous waste sites have troubling safety records\n\nNeighbors to one of California's biggest hazardous waste recyclers say they're unfairly exposed to pollution, but can California afford to lose one of the few facilities that still takes toxic waste?\n\nEnvironment\n\nCalifornia Toxics: Out of state, out of mind\n\nA CalMatters investigation finds that environmentally stringent California sends nearly half its toxic waste across its borders, often to states with weaker rules. One of the biggest out-of-state dumpers: the state’s own hazardous waste watchdog.\n\nEducation\n\nSecrecy shrouds pandemic spending at some California schools\n\nCalifornia schools received more than $33 billion in COVID stimulus money. Some districts won’t say how they’ve spent it."
