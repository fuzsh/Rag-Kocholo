        "text": "Instructions for Voluntary Acknowledgment of Parentage\n\nWhat is voluntary Acknowledgment of Parentage (AOP)?\n\nVoluntary Acknowledgment of Parentage (AOP) is a simple administrative process through which unmarried couples and married couples who use assisted reproduction can establish legal parentage. Offering parents the opportunity to complete an Acknowledgment of Parentage form in a hospital or birthing center means parents can begin to establish legal parentage even as soon as the day the child is born.\n\nBe sure the parents are eligible for AOP\n\nBefore discussing Acknowledgment of Parentage with new parents, make sure they are eligible to sign the AOP form. Only two people can sign the form to establish parentage. The two people may fit one of two scenarios:\n\nUnmarried Birth parent and Alleged parent\n\nMarried or unmarried Birth parent and Intended parent (for couples who use assisted reproduction)\n\nOne of the parents MUST be the birth parent.\n\nOtherwise, parentage must be established in court.\n\nParents may complete the AOP form at another place\n\nIf parents are unable to complete an AOP form in the hospital or birthing center, parents may complete the Child, Birth Parent, Other parent and Mailing address sections and file the form themselves with the registrar of the district where the birth certificate is filed.\n\nParents should be sure to check \"Other\" for \"where signed,\" but they must not complete the Registrar's sections at the top or bottom of the form.\n\nParents must sign the form in front of two witnesses who are not related to either parent. The parents can then send or deliver the signed and witnessed form to the appropriate registrar.\n\nFor births that took place in New York City, mail or take the original Acknowledgment of Parentage to the registrar at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Office of Vital Records, Attention: Corrections Unit Room 144, 125 Worth Street CN-4, New York, NY 10013-4089.\n\nFor births that took place outside New York City, mail or take the original Acknowledgment of Parentage to the registrar of the district where the birth certificate is filed.\n\nAOP Videos\n\nThe following videos are available on YouTube:\n\nAcknowledgment of Parentage in New York, 11 minutes\n\nExplains when parentage needs to be acknowledged, what signing a voluntary Acknowledgment of Parentage form means, and who should (or should not) sign this form\n\nThis fulfills the requirement to provide oral notice of the parents' rights and the consequences of signing the AOP form.\n\nReconocimiento de paternidad en Nueva York, 11 minutos\n\nEste video informa a los padres de los beneficios de establecer la paternidad y proporciona informaci√≥n sobre los derechos y las consecuencias vinculadas a la firma de un AOP\n\nCompleting the Acknowledgment of Parentage Form, 9 minutes\n\nExplains how to complete and file a voluntary Acknowledgment of Parentage form\n\nCompletar el formulario de reconocimiento de paternidad (AOP), 9.5 minutos\n\nKey terms"
