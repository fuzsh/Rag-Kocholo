        "text": "From the director of The Longest Distance comes THE CONSEQUENCES, a powerful emotional thriller about a troubled mother who refuses to unveil a terrible family secret while fighting against her own past. The wild Canary Islands landscape creates a unique and hypnotic atmosphere that delves into the deepest human nature.\n\nSince Fabiola saw her husband die in a diving accident, nothing has been the same again. Tired of not getting better, she decides to self-prescribe an unconventional therapy: together with her dad and her teenage daughter, she travels to a house her family owns in a small volcanic island.\n\nDuring this time of coexistence, each of them tries to protect their own privacy, and to safeguard their secrets. But all this secrecy triggers Fabiola's paranoia. She has neither evidence nor certainty, but something tells her that things are not what they seem.\n\nHow far can lies go to protect our loved ones?"
