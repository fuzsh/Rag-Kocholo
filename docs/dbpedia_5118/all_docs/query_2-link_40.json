        "text": "The antennas will often say they're good for multiple tv's, but depending on your equipment, like DVR's, some have multiple tuners. Some brands DVR's even recommend you use 1 antenna, exclusively for the DVR\n\nIf you have a DVR and a couple tv's, you might want to consider more than one antenna.\n\nI use the Clearstream 2Max HDTV Antenna, and I get over 60 channels for my dvr. It was like 79 bucks at lowes.\n\nIn a way, I use the antenna for all my tv's, because I stream live tv through my DVR using firestick and Firetvrecast.\n\nI do have a tv that isn't linked to the dvr, it gets most of the local channels with just an old school set of rabbit ears.\n\nSimplified answer: an antenna picks up electrical signals coming from a radio tower. That is all it does. That electrical signal has a frequency to it, and like a guitar note it will resonate at a specific wave length. If you were for example listening only to one TV signal then you could just use a piece of conductive metal that was the length of that wave. But because we watch many different TV stations we collect signals of different frequencies - meaning the signals are different lengths. That is why when you look at a TV antenna it has different length elements on it. Then if we are at a long distance where the signal is weak the antenna has multiple elements one length to pick up weaker signals. It may have elements that reflect a weak signal to give the main element a second chance at picking it up. In the end there is really NO difference in a digital antenna vs a regular antenna. What does change now is it seems every few years the US Government takes back certain frequencies and reassigns others. What this means is that an antenna tuned to stations that were around in 1980 doesn't work as well as one sold today OR it may have lots of wasted elements that aren't used anymore for TV. Even an antenna from 2010 may be tuned for different frequencies. Different parts of the country may use different frequency combinations.\n\nThe best thing to do is start here to see what stations are available, and what frequencies you need. It will also show how far away the stations are, and how strong a signal. https://www.antennaweb.org\n\nThere really is no such thing as a \"digital TV antenna\". When the switch came about the antenna makers used it as a marketing ploy. The old antennas received radio signals the same as the new ones. And the idea of 1 antenna per TV limit is dumb. You can do it either way. It is really just limited by signal strength. If you split the signal the signal at each outlet is decreased so if it is weak to begin with you may need an amplifier. If you are far from the station you may have issues or need an amplifier. I have an old yagi antenna in the attic with an amplifier that was used when I got it around 1995. Works great and feeds 2 TVs and 2 digital tuners for the DVR.\n\nThere really is no such thing as a \"digital TV antenna\". When the switch came about the antenna makers used it as a marketing ploy.

Works great and feeds 2 TVs and 2 digital tuners for the DVR.\n\nMy situation is anecdotal I know, but I was having issues with my DVR, the tech guy had me run the antenna exclusively to my dvr. It solved the problems\n\nAs SGkent indicates - it depends.\n\nUse one of the various antenna search sites using your zip code. Determine your distance to tower as well as the REAL frequency vs virtual of the channels. Most channels today are in the UHF band but some are still VHF; the bands require different and/or more complex antennas to cover them. The search will tell you how to aim your antenna. They also dumb it down via color codes to better help you target the type of antenna you may need.\n\nMy \"local\" channels are 45+ miles from me. One is VHF while others are UHF. The towers are clustered in about a 30 degree pie shape relative to my house. I installed an outdoor Antennas Direct DB8e and its add-on dipole for VHF on a mast off my chimney. I also have an older model Channel Master Spartan 2(?) pre-amp on the mast, upgraded all the coax to RG6 Quad shield.\n\nI have since installed a Channel Master 4-port distribution amplifier in the attic to split the signal to 3 TV's and capped the unused port.\n\nWe get 60-70 some odd channels.\n\nThis summer I will rotate one of the bays towards Richmond to try and pick those up in addition to my current Washington DC/Baltimore.\n\nA preamp or amplifier splitter?\n\nOn my setup I have a pre-amp on the mast at the antenna (old Channel Master Spartan 2 I found in the attic from the prior owner). Then as soon as the drop enters the attic, I have distribution amplifier (Channel Master CM-3414) pushing the signal to the 3 TV's due long runs\n\nDistribution Amp I have (Channel Master CM-3414)\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PI09SE/?tag=atomicindus08-20\n\nI installed this after I recently connected 2 additional TV's. Originally I had the single TV connected to the output of the pre-amp and it did very well. I did have some issues with some channels. After installing the distribution amp, these issues have gone away and the other 2 TV's receive equally well.\n\nWas thinking of buying this Pre-Amp (Channel Master CM-7778HD) which has slightly better gain than the unit I currently have. This unit seems to have problems staying in stock so hoping that is a good thing. Have not pulled the trigger on this.\n\nhttps://www.channelmaster.com/Amplify_Plus_TV_Antenna_Preamplifier_p/cm-7778hd.htm\n\nI read info here on how to configure my setup. At bottom of link there is a link to a PDF showing wiring/configuration methods.\n\nhttps://support.channelmaster.com/h...fier-and-a-Preamplifier-in-my-Antenna-System-\n\nAttachments\n\ns-l1600.jpg\n\nSpartan 2 Model Number 0064C.jpg\n\nA preamp or amplifier splitter?\n\nIn general\n\nPreamp if you are in a fringe area that you are far away from a TV tower that you wanted to view... usually preamp are installed at the antenna and you'll power it with a power injector into the coax.. so in other word pre-amp amplify reception signals along with what ever noise it picks up or frequency it is design for.\n\na distribution amp/splitter amp is really not needed unless you have very long runs... as the name state.. it is amplify the signals it receives after the antenna for long runs and splitters. Sort of saying \"boost\" the signal. Most of the times a regular good quality splitter is all you needed.. Stick with a good known brand, don't buy cheap ones from 99cent stores and really those fancy advertising wordings might get confusing and their product don't last long.\n\nA regular splitter can be use as a combiner as well to combine two antenna signals if you have two different towers you wanted to receive broadcasting from. It's straight forward if you don't have preamp. If you use pre-amp then combine it after the power injector.\n\nI have two TVs and about 150' of cable run from antenna, the splitter is installed in midway of about 75' from the antenna. then another about 100' to the TV.. The signals are fine on regular splitter.\n\nIn the end there is really NO difference in a digital antenna vs a regular antenna.\n\n100% correct !\n\nSimplified answer: an antenna picks up electrical signals coming from a radio tower. That is all it does. That electrical signal has a frequency to it, and like a guitar note it will resonate at a specific wave length..\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThese statements are also correct, but the rest of that discussion needs to be taken with a \"grain of salt\".\n\nThe \"old\" TV stations (NTSB) had \"channels\" space over a very WIDE range of frequencies that spanned parts of 2 \"bands\", VHF and UHF. The lower part of the VHF band was taken back by the government (FCC) and has (will be) resold. Same is true with the upper part of the UHF band.\n\nThis is good news for consumers because it means that a more compact antenna will work well ! Most are small enough, you can fit them inside of an attic and they still work well.\n\nLike old antennas, higher is better, pointed toward where the signal is coming from is better (see below). Rotor may help, but not a \"must have\".\n\nThe best thing to do is start here to see what stations are available, and what frequencies you need. It will also show how far away the stations are, and how strong a signal. https://www.antennaweb.org\n\nGood place to start ! No reason to spend money on an antenna if the tower broadcasting is close by.\n\nDoes each TV need their own antenna?\n\nNo it does not, but it might be simpler ! My in-laws have 3 TV and we bought 3 \"window mount\" antennas. Fairly cheap, easy and quick to install.\n\nIf you have good quality coax (preferably RG6) all ready run, and the come back to one point, I recommend this 4 Port Cable TV/HDTV/Digital Amplifier (also available in 8 port).\n\nI like ChannelMaster. They have been in the business for a long, LONG time. No gimmicks. Shop Amazon.\n\nAttachments\n\nCapture.JPG\n\nIn most metro area, all of the major network affiliates have gone to UHF.\n\nRumors keep flying that the FCC is going to take back the part of the VHF spectrum that they had left.\n\nEven though the \"radio waves\" are the same, the electronics are \"smart\" enough to sort out signals spaced close together. This is why your local station may have \"sub-channels\" (i.e. 7, 7.1, 7.2, ...)\n\nAlmost right. The subchannels aren't close together. They are on the same frequency. The signals are digitally combined and all transmitted together. Then the receiver takes the pieces for whatever subchannel is selected.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_subchannel\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations on digital TV antennas. We are making a switch away from cable and I'm going to put TV in the garage for races and football games.\n\nI'm building a house. Each TV will get a RG6 drop, but the plan is to have a single (external) antenna at the house. We have several of the indoor \"leaf\" antennas now which are OK, but the shop has a big external antenna and the difference is substantial.\n\nWhat antenna you need depends on how far your stations are away. Many antennas are still directional.\n\nDoes each TV need their own antenna?\n\nOthers have provided active splitters, which are best if you can centralize.\n\nAnother option that I'm \"test driving\" is Amazon's Fire Re-cast. Basically it's a \"whole house\" DVR. So I have a single box that is recording from OTA, either 2-channels or 4-channels at once. From that box, any TV that has an Amazon Fire Stick (about $30) can receive recorded AND live programs from the DVR.... Full channel menu/program guide. So with several older TVs, this is a great option and I don't even have to run RG6 or deal with antennas at all..\n\nOnly downside? It's 720P."
