We recommend always check for signal to see what channels are being broadcasted near you home.\n\nQ> Why do some channel appear incomplete or blank?\n\nA> Weak signal. Your signal strength may vary based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, distance from broadcast towers, building construction, neighboring buildings and trees, weather, and specific reception hardware.

Magic Stick TV™ Antenna works by trapping the channel signals inside a geometric shape therefor resulting in better picture quality and signal strength.\n\nQ> How and Where is the best location to put Magic Stick TV™ Antenna?\n\nA> Near a window or outside. Though best if placed outside we recommend finding a sweet spot to maximize channel selection.

Also scan for channels again once you find a sweet spot and you’re done.\n\n​"
