        "text": "This _was_ a great app for setting up an external antenna for getting over the air signals and then getting free listings for whatâs on. Unfortunately, now when you open it, the app just hangs with a âLoading...â message. Since the last update was over a year ago, it probably canât handle a newer iOS version (12.4.9 in my case). IDK. It was great, now it simply doesnât work. Hoping for an update that will fix it, but Iâll prolly just ditch the app and get something else.\n\nThe app only works when it feels like it. And when it does work, it resets the settings that I put so every time I have to change it back to the right settings and then once I do it works and it does have accurate information. But Iâve had the app for about a month now and I try to go into it every single day for hours on end and alsoAll different times a day and it pretty much has only worked the first day that I got it and two other times after that, Every other time it did not work at all I just keeps trying to load and all my other apps and my Internet works perfectly fine. When I tried to contact the app developer and the other company associated with the app the app developer listed in the App Store does not have any contact information at all and the other company that I found associated with the app literally only has a mailing address thereâs no other way to contact them so if I wanted to Iâd have to send something in the mail and I guarantee theyâre probably not gonna write back\n\nI absolutely love this app! I live in the middle of nowhereVille so an antenna is my only option in the back of my home! (Iâm 8ft too far from satellite being a possibility ) with a baby who loves seasame street, I live by this app to tell me when itâs on! MOST IMPORTANTLY DUE TO THE APP, I was able to find 3 more additional times on different PBS channels, that I had no clue even existed, heâs now able to watch! GET THIS APP! If your an antenna gal (or guy) ITS A MUST HAVE! Five PLUS STARS â­ï¸\n\nPs TO THE NAYSAYERS.. try hitting the refresh button (top right) and it will then show more channels.. hit again to show less. If the times off by half an hr or zone isnât exact, figure it out! Come on now, ITS FREE ! No need in giving bad reviews for simple fixes as you pay zero for the service provided."
