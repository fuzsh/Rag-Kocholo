Anyone know why I'm not getting any of the local channels (CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox)? Maybe it's my antenna, but it worked good at my other house. Are there any Hammock residents out there using a local antenna? Any suggestions would be appreciated. I didn't really want to buy cable because we only watch the local channels anyway. Thanks.\n\nAre you sure you have this pointed in the correct direction, towards Orlando, 117 degrees from our house. Do you have an amplifier on the antenna and is it rated for at least 80 miles? Did you rescan your TV after connecting the antenna? I am in Pinellas and reception from Orlando is sketchy at best (there is a building in Leesburg in the way), I have the antenna pointed to Ocala, and get about a dozen stations which sounds like what you are getting. When i was experimenting with Orlando, on a good day i would get 65 channels, 1/3 Spanish, 1/3 religious (etc), and the rest something I would actually watch. There are a couple of websites that have good info on how to aim the antenna and the approximate height required, search on TV reception in my area.\n\n__________________\n\nPennsylvania, for 60+ years, most recently, Allentown, now TV.\n\nCason Hammock\n\nI live on Outridge Loop Cason Hammock and pick up all channels with antenna in attic pointed east.Youhave to have amplifier and plugged in to receive them.

We will eventually get cable but won't be full-time for a few months, so it would be great to have some reception until then.\n\nNo Local TV - Antennas Do Not Work\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by michaelvac\n\nWe just moved in to Hammock at Fenney and do not have cable yet, so I connected a local antenna and it only picked up a few channels (Court TV, Grit and a couple others), but no local channels.

Thanks.\n\nWe just moved to Fenney, and after purchasing a new antennae, and not getting any local TV stations my husband did not believe me. So, he purchased another new antenna to install in the attic, to no avail. No matter how good the antennae is, you will not get any local TV stations. Disappointing as we do not live in the Villages full time and do not want to pay the price of cable. TV is in the middle of no where. If anyone has additional suggestions I would love to hear them...\n\nHere's a few different questions. I searched available channels using the Antenna Direct link. I noticed multiple channels to the NW, SW, E and SE.\n\n1. Does one antenna pick up in 360 degrees or does it have to be pointed at a specific antenna?\n\n2. Looking at the Gainsville sites, the broadcasting antennas are separated by approximately 10-12 degrees of arc. Can you pick up all those stations by pointing the receiving antenna towards the middle of the cluster?\n\n3. Are there available antennas that you can program to rotate in a direction to point at a specific broadcasting antenna for optimal reception?"
