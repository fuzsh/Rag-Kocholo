        "text": "Quote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Jowel\n\nShovad, I'm glad you were able to fix your issue. For anyone else looking at this thread, over the air antenna frequencies are changing through the middle of the year, so it's a good idea to rescan your TV periodically:\n\nhttps://www.fcc.gov/TVrescan?utm_med...SAAEgK0ePD_BwE\n\nGlad the WBTV issue was fixed.\n\nWBTV is the strongest Charlotte TV signal, due to a very tall tower and an omnidirectional, top mounted transmission antenna in Gaston County. It did not change with the repack. WJZY and WCNC also broadcast from similar tall towers at the same basic location, however they utilize directional patterns such that the coverage area is not quite as large as WBTV. And WJZY is currently at reduced power until about September as they await a replacement part since the repack. Then their signal should be basically the same as WBTV, but WCNC maintains a null to the west.\n\nWSOC and WCCB broadcast from eastern Mecklenburg County, and their towers are not as tall as the Gaston County transmitters. So their coverage area is a bit smaller, but they are strong in Charlotte and extend a bit further to the east.\n\nMost major Charlotte stations completed their repack work last September, but additional work remains for UNC-TV channels 17 and 58, which has been delayed due to the coronavirus. And WJZY as mentioned is not yet full power. WTVI is scheduled to change channels by July, and work may still remain for Hickory station WHKY.\n\nAt my location in Spartanburg County, I get strong signals from WBTV, WJZY, and WCNC with an attic antenna. I also get reliable signals from WSOC and WCCB, although they are a bit weaker as they are further to the east and lower height towers."
