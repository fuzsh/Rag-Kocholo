I live in the country and am a long distance from all\n\nstations. (most are at least 50 miles). The plans for the antenna are\n\nmostly for a single, double, or 4 pole bow tie. But they all have\n\ndifferent whisker lengths which is for different stations (vhf, lower\n\nuhf, middle uhf, and high uhf). They have referred to an online chart\n\nthat shows the stations frequencies and the length of these whiskers\n\nthat are most suitable for that frequency. i'm not finding such a\n\nchart.\n\nI'm mostly looking to improve the upper VHF, channels 8 thru 10\n\n(actual). I have one of those small RCA amplified antennas that are\n\nmeant to mount on a wall or on a mast. I have mine on a mast, made from\n\nseveral lengths of 1-1/4\" EMT conduit. It sits about 5 feet above the\n\nhighest part of my roof. I'm getting a good signal for stations located\n\nbetween 15 to 50 (actual), but those other ones I mentioned above dont\n\ncome in very good, or not at all.\n\nI just want to play around with some ofthese bow tie antennas made from\n\nscrap wire and stuff, but so far, I only know that the whiskers need to\n\nbe longer for the low uhf and upper vhf channels. I'd like to make one\n\nthat is suitable for top gain for those channels 8 thru 10 (actual).\n\nThanks for all help.\n\ndca...@krl.org\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\nOn Thursday, January 23, 2014 3:42:38 PM UTC-5, jam...@home.com wrote:\n\n>\n\n> I'm mostly looking to improve the upper VHF, channels 8 thru 10\n\n>\n\n> (actual).\n\n> Thanks for all help.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is find out the frequencies of the stations that you want to receive. When the conversion to digital signals occurred, they tried to make it easy for the masses. So stations that say were on channel 8 still show up as channel 8, but in actual practice the station moved to say channel 34.

So google for tv location and frequency. When you can say exactly what frequency you are trying to receive, then we can be of more help.\n\nDan\n\njam...@home.com\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\nî—“\n\nI only used the word ACTUAL at least three times in my posting.

The channel numbers haven't changed, but the frequencies\n\nwere heavily reallocated when the digital conversion began; it's a real\n\nproblem trying to find those frequencies from the channel number (I've tried)\n\nand there have been (in Seattle at least) a half dozen frequency changes\n\nannounced by my Tivo (along with instructions to re-scan so the receiver\n\ndoesn't miss channels).\n\n> The first thing you need to do is find out the frequencies of the stations that you want to receive.

Maybe, if you seek in the menus of antenna-connected TVs and converters, one\n\nwill give out this info, in an up-to-date fashion. Which might change next month.\n\nI tried FCC and local station's websites, and was unable to locate that information\n\nin those places. <antennaweb.org> used to be a good place to start.\n\nDavid Platt\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\nIn article <689243948412220314.18...@news.eternal-september.org>,\n\ngregz <ze...@comcast.net> wrote:\n\n>> I tried FCC and local station's websites, and was unable to locate\n\n>that information\n\n>> in those places. <antennaweb.org> used to be a good place to\n\n>start.\n\nwww.rabbitears.info seems like a good place to start looking today.\n\nIt looks as if they're actually pulling data from an FCC database.\n\nTry the \"TV Query\" feature, and ask for a detailed listing on all\n\nstations in a given market and city...

Don't know why FCC mad them stay on 13 ,\n\n>when they were preparing to go UHF.\n\nFrom what I recall, the usual reason for this would be that there was\n\nno UHF frequency to which they would be moved, and which would have\n\nallowed them to retain their current customer-footprint coverage,\n\nwhich would not have caused interference problems of one sort or\n\nanother for other stations in the area.\n\nThis sort of situation cropped up a fair bit in some of the more\n\ncrowded metro areas (especially on the east coast) where each large\n\ncity had a large number of stations. \"Packing\" all of the stations\n\ninto the available UHF channels wasn't a trivial challenge, since some\n\nstations were moving up from VHF, and some had to move down from the\n\nhigher-frequency UHF channels which were being reclaimed from TV\n\nallocation and transferred to public-service allocation.\n\ndca...@krl.org\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\nOn Thursday, January 23, 2014 5:07:26 PM UTC-5, jam...@home.com wrote:\n\n> I only used the word ACTUAL at least three times in my posting.

The speed of a radio wave is slower in a conductor than in a vacuum, so multiply the 65.62 by .95 and get 62.34 inches. And a half wave length is 31.17 inches. So that is the number you want for the horizontal length of each section of the antenna.\n\nIf I have screwed anything up, somebody please correct me. I have not screwed arounud with antenna's for a long time.\n\nDan\n\nPhil Allison\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\n<dca...@krl.org>\n\nOkay the speed of light and radio waves is 300,000,000 meters / second.\n\nSo if you divide that by 180,000,000 You get the wave length is 1.667\n\nmeters.\n\nMultiply that by 39.37 inches / meter and you have the wave length is 65.62\n\ninches.\n\nThe speed of a radio wave is slower in a conductor than in a vacuum,\n\n** Not true.\n\nThe speed of a EM wave is slower in a * medium* like plastic insulation.\n\n> so multiply the 65.62 by .95 and get 62.34 inches.\n\n** Accounts for the \"end effect\" that makes all antennas seem a little\n\nlonger then the elements .\n\nBut a \"bow tie\" antenna is a odd ball with a larger effect that a straight\n\nelement.\n\n>And a half wave length is 31.17 inches.

Phil\n\nmiso\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\nî—“\n\nThe only wideband antenna for your application is a log periodic. The ARRL\n\nhandbook has the designs. Unless you are good with welding, this isn't\n\ntrivial. The ones I've built were done with threaded Al rods, which means\n\nyou need to use a tap and die. [There are tricks to do the Al to Cu\n\ninterface.] You do this kind of work for antennas you can't buy, i.e. for\n\nSIGINT. For TV, you buy the damn antenna. It is cheaper.\n\nNow if you want to build an antenna for ONE channel, it will have to be a\n\nfolded dipole due to the TV bandwidth. The folded dipole is the driven\n\nelement. You need at least one reflector and one director. These are not too\n\ndifficult to make if you use brass rods and a wooden boom.\n\nThe deal is unless you know what you are doing, these outdoor antennas will\n\ndegrade faster than commercially made antennas. It is a waste of time.\n\nIf you really insist on this project, look at this website:\n\nhttp://www.george-smart.co.uk/wiki/432MHz_Yagi\n\nThe site is kind of slow. I found it by doing an image search because 90% of\n\nthe designs on the internet are wrong. This is the right approach, though I\n\nhaven't checked his math. The driven element is a folded dipole for\n\nbandwidth. The loop balun works well. The boom has to be wood. Metal boom\n\ndesign changes the math a bit, and the modeling programs like NEC do not\n\nwork well with metal booms, so most yagi designs on the internet with metal\n\nbooms are fiction.\n\nI have one of these scaled for the federal 400MHz band and it is awesome.\n\n[Like I said, you go through this nonsense for things you can't buy.]\n\nMartin Brown\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\nî—“\n\nIndeed. Unless he has stations in several different directions the best\n\nsolution by far for marginal reception is a high gain directional aerial\n\nhigh up and pointed at the transmitter. Yagi or log periodic depending\n\non the needed bandwidth. A masthead amplifier might help too.\n\nYou can make your own DIY yagi/log periodic but it is hard work.\n\nUK has suffered some silly problems after digital switchover because the\n\nWelsh stations are now powerful enough and omnidirectional transmitting\n\nthat they appear in a sidelobe of many high gain antennas in Manchester\n\n(a major city). Certain manufacturers older sets like Panasonic are\n\nstupid enough to place the first station found in the prime position\n\nwhen they retune. The result is that because the lower frequency Welsh\n\nstations are found first they occupy the main slots!\n\n(this is really unhelpful as hardly anyone in Manchester speaks Welsh)\n\nThe approved fix is to unplug the aerial connector until the low\n\nchannels have been scanned! Telemenders charge good money for this!!\n\n--\n\nRegards,\n\nMartin Brown"
