        "text": "Each time you add cable, you are losing part of the signal. If you use a coupler (to connect two cables together), you are also losing signal. Is it possible to change the cable to a single run? Also - make sure it is a good RG6 cable - other cables work, but have higher loss as well.\n\nAlso, this time of year (very hot days, with cool nights) will create tropospheric propagation which can cause co-channel interference (a channel from a distant town is interfering with the station). I have this issue in Austin, TX - there are 3 channels that share a frequency with stations in Houston (almost 200 miles away) and/or San Antonio (about 120 miles away), and during these atmospheric conditions, the channels go from great signal to “no signal”, usually around 11:00PM - 9:00AM. Once it heats back up, the channels are fine.\n\nSure, but the map doesn’t tell the whole story.\n\nhttps://www.rabbitears.info/searchmap.php?request=result&study_id=124491\n\nMy antenna is aimed at 270 deg, I get excellent reception on 19- and 21- channels, the hard channel is 13- which is on the VHF-lo band. Everything (except the 13-) comes in perfectly, even though the report says poor.\n\nTalking with others here when I was first setting things up, I was given the impression that a 50’ run shouldn’t be a problem, and it wasn’t, I just needed to get the antenna higher to get the 13- and 22- channels; I did that and it brought in the 13- series fine, the 22-series was okay, but faded at night. Today I raised it an additional 2.5’ to try and get the 22-series, it did that but lost the 13-series until, as you said, things heated up, now the 13-series is back, but not sure for how long.\n\nWhen troubleshooting antenna setups, the first thing I do is hook up the antenna directly to a TV on a short cable, and do a channel scan. Then you can look at adding in splitters, pre-amps, longer cables, etc. I always scan in the afternoon or early evening (before 7:00PM) as there is less chance of problems with tropospheric propagation.\n\nThe antenna you have is designed to work with the pre-amp, so you might want to try it with a shorter cable for testing as well. The “magnetic” and “true” directions aren’t always 100% accurate, sometimes it takes “fine tuning” by moving the antenna 3-5 degrees and trying a rescan.\n\nOnce is it setup with good reception with only the short cable, then try the additional cabling in the home. There are a lot of possible problems in multiple lengths of cable, couplers, splitters, etc…and if you eliminate all of them, it makes it easy to troubleshoot (simplest circuit = best way to diagnose).\n\nHi tecumsa,\n\nYou’re spot on to realize that it’s because your PBS WQED is now on VHF-lo that you’re having problems. They moved down frequencies in July 2019, because of the repack.\n\nBut, they knowingly did so. I see your mention about it being the FCC doing this to them, and SophieCat mentioned it, too. Realize though that WQED was the only TV station in the nation that during the 2017 auction took money to move from VHF-Hi to VHF-Lo. Had they not accepted the proceeds, they would have either remained within the VHF-Hi range (RF7-13), or possibly even moved up to UHF (where smaller home antennas work). They were happy to receive money equivalent to their annual budget, per this article I Googled up: WQED board extols fund increase through auction | Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\nLike ronintexas noted, You need an antenna that is expected to receive VHF-Lo. The Antop’s VHF dipoles out each side don’t have a long enough wingspan, unfortunately.\n\nI like to refer to this chart I found on RFCAFE a couple of years ago when thinking about wingspan needs:\n\nTo give full credit, it’s from this article: The Yagi, October 1952 Radio & Television News Article - RF Cafe\n\nSince WQED is now transmitting on the frequency that historically was Channel 4, the primary dipole element needs to be almost 7 feet across (82 inches…so 2 inches shy of 7 feet) for optimal results.\n\nI’m guessing that if you measured the Antop’s wingspan, it’s a yard or less. Fine for VHF-Hi (Channels 7-13, from the chart), but not ideal for any VHF-Lo. Then your happening to be down in what’s apparently a step-sided valley exacerbates things.\n\nSo what to do? One person that posted over in the Pittsburgh thread of AVSForum (I can provide the link if you’re not familiar with that site) had a different antenna than you, but successfully extended the dipole with metal tubing or rod–and scored rather reliable reception of WQED.\n\nOtherwise, you’ll need to add a separate antenna, or replace what you’re using.\n\nI’m afraid the smallest Winegards that have long dipoles won’t be enough. Rather, these come to mind for me–and save you from going to the monsterously long Winegard HD8200:\n\nRCA ANT3036\n\nRCA ANT3037 (with VHF-Lo extensions installed)\n\nPer what last was known, both these RCAs were being manufactured by Winegard. Their main boom is 5-6 feet long, with the widest dipoles 9 or so feet wide.\n\nChannel Master Advantage 60 (model number CM-3018)–Notice this isn’t from their “Digital Advantage” product line, since those aren’t wide enough for VHF-Lo. I’d also be a bit concerned that their Advantage 45 (CM-3016) wouldn’t be quite enough for you in the valley.\n\nAmazon also lists a VHF-Lo-only antenna if you dig far enough. But there’s so few reviews and it comes from overseas that I’m unsure about even mentioning it–plus it costs in the same range as the above options.\n\nI don’t have any VHF-Lo broadcasts in my market. But I do use an RCA ANT3037 (without the extensions installed) for my VHF-Hi reception. Lowes was closing them out from their store inventory a couple of years ago–but Home Depot will ship-to-store free I’m finding.\n\nIf you want to add one of the above, you could leave your current Antop as is, put one of these on the same mast, run a separate coax down to where you have the power injector for the Antop, then add in the VHF-Lo coax line with a “High Low Signal Joiner” (HLSJ for short): Amazon.com\n\nThe key is that the HLSJ would need to be placed so as to not divert the current going to the Antop from the power injector.\n\nLots said here. Hopefully not too overwhelming. ~~ Cheers! Statmanmi\n\nOkay, does this make any sense?\n\nI can’t undo the existing cables because they run through the attic and down between the joists, so, instead, I move the Tablo to a different location, near the antenna. I don’t have another RG6 cable, so I used a 25’ length of RG19U, this cuts the run by 36’ and eliminates one coupler. Prior to making the changes I scanned the Tablo and I am picking up the 13- and 19- channels, after making the changes I lost the 13- and 19- channels. So, I moved everything back and now I have the 13- and 19- channels back. I would have thought, even with the RG19, that the shorter run would have worked.\n\nThey’re not reliable, a recording I had set up for last night didn’t occur because of poor signal."
