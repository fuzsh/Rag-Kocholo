        "text": "I mostly watch many of the local TV stations I get using my antenna. One of the issues I have is when it's windy and I get 'some' pixelization I also get a black information bar on the bottom third of the screen which shows the channel information along with the bars showing signal strength (the same bar that shows up when you first select a channel). This black bar lasts for a good 5 to 7 seconds and is extremely annoying. It's considerably more annoying than the pixelization that might only last a second or less or sometimes hardly seen but that bar still shows up. This happens on two different Roku TV's I have (TCL & Hisense).\n\nDoes anyone know of any way to eliminate this bar?\n\nI tried contacting Roku directly but they tell me it's a TV manufacturer issue. I called both TV manufacturers and they tell me it's definitely a Roku issue. Once a channel has been chosen I shouldn't have to deal with this bar any longer but sometimes it pops up so much it's real difficult to watch the show.\n\nThanks for posting here in the Roku Community, @RRROY.\n\nWe regret to hear about the inconvenience this may have caused you.\n\nPlease be aware that the bar is intended to automatically show the signal strength of your antenna whenever there are changes on it. Moreover, the pixelated screen you are experiencing also relies on the signal strength of your antenna. This happens when you have an antenna connected to your TCL & Hisense Roku TV because the resolution or quality of your streaming solely relies on it.\n\nHope this helps clear everything out.\n\nBest regards,\n\nCarly\n\nCarly Y.\n\nRoku Community Moderator\n\nHi Carly,\n\nI know why I am getting the pixelation. I know that my reception is not 100% but there needs to be a way to 'turn off' that bar from overlaying the bottom third of the TV. I can live with most of the pixelation and many times it's a fraction of a second and hardly noticable. But this bar shows up every time and sits there for 5 to 7 seconds and it is soooo annoying. I don't need this to show up and point out that the signal strength isn't the greatest. There are times I have to change the channel not becuase of the pixelization but because of that bar.\n\nHow can I turn this off?"
