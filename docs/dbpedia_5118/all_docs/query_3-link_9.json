        "text": "Advertisements\n\nOK, I'm in the process of cutting the cord again, this time dumping Dish TV 11 months in to a 24 month contract. The killer is, I ordered some new toys (I mean hardware) for OTA PVR before cancelling and they made me an offer that is better than the ETF fee which kind of doesn't make sense to me but I'm not that big of a fool to pay more for nothing. Ironically, the Hopper DVR has DLNA client so I can watch stuff from PlayOn from my computer. (It also has Bluetooth and I'm pretty sure NFC. Pretty advanced hardware for satco).\n\nAnyway, I'll still cut the cord since for some reason I've only been watching locals, Doctor who and the fake news on Comedy Central. The deal in case you were wondering is $20 per month for I have no idea what channels besides local but CC is still coming in though perhaps not HD. I can't tell because the picture is still really good but it is widescreen shrunk to fit a standard TV but IDC it's a good price with locals in HD. NO DVR FEE for 6 months! That's what sealed the deal. We went from $50 cheapest package with DVR to $20 total. My negotiating tip: silence. Saved $10 per month by not saying anything. Americans are uncomfortable when no one is talking.\n\nAnywho, I picked up a Home Run network tuner to supplement my internal PCI tuner because it was on sale at B&H and Amazon was nice enough to match the $69 price. This device allows the tuner to be on the network instead of directly hooked to the TV. If you don't understand what I just said you probably want to skip to the next section.\n\nSpecifically the device is the SiliconDust HDHomeRun DUAL High Definition Digital TV Tuner HDHR3-US (Black). It has two tuners and the coolest dang thing is with Windows Media Center multiple computers can \"see\" the tuners and think that they are dedicated to that box. Each computer can \"seize\" a tuner on demand. This plus the internal card and the Hopper means I can record 7 network prime time shows at the same time but God knows I never will. Well the Hopper records the 4 networks in prime time by default which is cool but as I hinted, I'm not watching much TV so I rarely go back in time to find something.\n\nWith my Terk HDTVa I recive very strong signals from 3, 9, 18, 36, 46, 55, 58, and 64. I'm close to Mt. Holly but still in Charlotte limits. The only thing really want is 42 but 30 would be nice.\n\nThe HDTVa is directional. Recommendations from industry sites say I need a medium omnidirectional for 42. Something perhaps like the Channel Master CM-3000HD. I have a splitter combiner coming in hopefully today. This should allow me to combine the two antennas in to one and then split them between the two coax receivers.\n\nSo, the short question after all that is who is getting a good signal on 42 in NW Charlotte and what antenna are you using?\n\nPS: Other projects include caller ID for Media Center which is cool though I'm going to have 4 modems before I finish. I wanted caller ID popup when watching Media Center which I will also use to pull down Doctor Who through a UK proxy (shhhh) which will allow perfect HD beamed to the XBOX with no commercials. The caller ID app has an option to pause the program when the phone rings. That's a nice touch.\n\nAll of this hooks in to an Obi 202 to control the phone system which I will be pure VOIP after my UVERSE contract is up. The Obi allows the hook in of Google Voice which is free so you could go as low as $40 for the device and a free (even ported) phone number from Google though they might start charging at some point. The 202 can handle 4 providers either Google or SIP. I'm using Anveo for a couple (OK more like 10) phone numbers divided between two sip appearances and a POTS via USB so I can take calls from UVERSE through the device which gives me caller ID by name. It also has a Bluetooth add on so I can make outgoing calls through my cell phone or have it ring my line 2 when a cell phone comes in. And if you order today (jk) you can have SMS messages appear as caller ID on your home phone. Someone texts your GV or SIP (Anveo charges a whopping 1 cent for SMS incoming) your home phone rings once and displays the message. Nerd heaven. Oh, *78 puts on DND for all sources so it silents all incoming sources from ringing through the Obi. And I just saw that one talking caller ID software speak out an incoming text message but I'm not sure how. No hardware is hooked up to that client. Hmmm.\n\nSo, that's probably the geekeist thing I've posted. I'm spending a few hundred on toys but my TV bill is going from $55 per month (first year) to $90 per month (no, no) to $20 per month for six months then cancel. Add Amazon Prime for $79 for on demand stuff and possible rentals now and then (and free 2nd day shipping though stuff coming out of Columbia ships that fast anyway). Phone is currently $25 for 250 minutes (a total rip) and will go to $30 (no), I mean less than $20 for all the bells and whistles of multiple phone numbers all over the world (cost as low as nothing for incoming 40 minutes or unlimited for $2 per month and 1 cent per minute outgoing but that's where I use GV for).\n\nAnd I get to record 7 TV shows at once."
