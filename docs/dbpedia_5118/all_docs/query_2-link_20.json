        "text": "An alternative to the mast amplifier and network device is the line amplifier, which is used indoors between the antenna and the TV receiver. The line amplifier is designed for situations where additional TV viewing points are desired or the existing signal needs to be amplified.\n\nConnectors and cables\n\nThe quality of connection cables varies significantly, and in many fault locations, the antenna problem is found in the connection cable itself. Sometimes the solution is just changing the connection cable, i.e., the antenna cable connected to the television. We always recommend using a custom-made connection cable. (e.g., TV connection cable PRO)\n\nOther connection points in the antenna system should also be checked, as an old connection may have become damp or otherwise deteriorated. The antenna cable itself may have become brittle, and sometimes animals can cause damage to various parts of the system. It is a good idea to change the antenna cable and connectors when needed. (e.g., Fagor CCF 020 and F-connector 6.8mm threaded)\n\n2. Fixing external disturbances\n\nAn old amplifier that amplifies LTE signals and thus causes overloading. Some of the frequency ranges used for TV signal transmission have been taken into LTE use in recent years, and for this reason, amplifiers over 5 years old without LTE700 protection can easily become congested and cause interference in the TV image as pixelation. The problem can be fixed by changing the amplifier to LTE700 protected (e.g., Fagor AML 910 Kit amplifier package) or installing an LTE filter between the antenna and the amplifier. (e.g., Fagor LTE filter LBF M-694)\n\n- It is also a good idea to check the connections and condition of other electrical devices. Sometimes a damaged device sends interference signals to the antenna system, causing disturbances in the TV image.\n\n3. Optimal sizing of the antenna system\n\nOptimal sizing of the antenna system is important to ensure the quality and power of the signal remains high. Trees growing near the antenna in the direction of the base station, weather conditions, and the expansion of the indoor network are often reasons for the weakening of signal power and/or quality. In this case, the solution is to replace the device with a more powerful one.\n\nIf the indoor network causes too much attenuation (several antenna sockets or too long a chain network), an option is to add a line amplifier to the system. Indoor network-induced disturbances can sometimes be resolved with existing components, but this requires some knowledge of the system and its components.\n\nSometimes, an overly powerful amplifier can be in use, causing too much amplification in strong fields and thus causing overloading. Occasionally, an amplifier is not needed at all, and problems can be fixed by removing the amplifier or changing it to a model with less amplification power.\n\n4. Considering terrain obstacles\n\nThe effect of terrain obstacles on signal propagation sometimes has a significant impact, and it is essential to consider these factors when installing an antenna. During the installation and alignment of the antenna, it is particularly important to pay attention to terrain obstacles in the immediate vicinity of the installation site. For example, high cliffs and buildings in the direction of the base station significantly affect signal propagation.\n\nThere is also a noticeable difference between summer and winter in trees. For example, moist dense coniferous trees act as a considerable signal attenuator. In summer, when leaves appear on trees, signal levels drop noticeably. In this situation, the most effective method is to install the antenna as high as possible.\n\nIn some cases, the terrain can be utilized by installing the antenna, for example, on a cliff in front of the antenna. In this case, the signal can be brought to the television using an underground cable. (e.g., TRIAX KOKA 99 HD Plus PE antenna cable)\n\nWhen choosing an installation site, it is therefore essential to consider high cliffs, dense forests, and other tall terrain obstacles in the direction of the transmitter station. With powerful devices, correct alignment, and height, it is still possible to receive signals even in challenging conditions.\n\n5. Changing the TV or digital box\n\nSometimes, TV image problems can also be caused by a damaged television or digital box. The easiest way to diagnose the problem is to try another receiver. It is also a good idea to check the condition of the television's connecting cable. This inexpensive part of the system is often the cause of antenna network disturbances. The solution is to replace the connecting cable with a new one, such as the TV Connection Cable PRO.\n\n6. Radio weather phenomenon\n\nThere are phenomena in the atmosphere that cause so-called radio weather. The phenomenon typically occurs at least in archipelagos and other open areas. The problem arises when the signal is transmitted from a transmitter that is not intended to carry the signal and thus causes disturbances elsewhere. The phenomenon is described, for example, on the website of the Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority and in the accompanying video. It is extremely difficult to fix the problem, but fortunately, the phenomenon is quite rare. In addition, Digita usually reports on radio weather, and the problem usually disappears on its own after some time. Problems caused by radio weather can be fixed with a larger and more powerful antenna, such as the Triax Unix 52 UHF antenna (LTE 700).\n\nLearn more or contact us:\n\nAntenna Guide is a collection of Nordic Antenna articles related to choosing the right antenna, antenna installation, and antenna alignment.
