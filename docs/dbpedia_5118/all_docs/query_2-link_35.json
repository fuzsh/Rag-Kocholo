        "text": "Television-transmitting mast in Blanchard, North Dakota\n\nThe KVLY-TV mast (formerly the KTHI-TV mast) is a television-transmitting mast in Blanchard, North Dakota. It is used by Fargo station KVLY-TV (channel 11) and KXJB-LD's Argusville/Valley City/Mayville translator K28MA-D (channel 28), along with KNGF (channel 27). Completed in 1963, it was once the tallest structure in the world, and stood at 2,063 feet (629 meters) until 2019, when the top mount VHF antenna was removed for the FCC spectrum repack, dropping the height to 1,987 feet (605.6 m).[1]\n\nIn 1974, the KVLY-TV mast was succeeded by the Warsaw radio mast as the world's tallest structure. The Warsaw mast collapsed in 1991, again making the KVLY-TV mast the tallest structure in the world until the Burj Khalifa surpassed it in 2008. The KVLY-TV mast remained the tallest structure in the Western Hemisphere and the tallest broadcasting mast in the world until the removal of its antenna in 2019.\n\nLocation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe mast is located 3 miles (4.8 km) west of Blanchard, North Dakota, halfway between Fargo and Grand Forks. It became the tallest artificial structure, and the first man-made structure to exceed 2,000 feet (610 m) in height, upon the completion of its construction on August 13, 1963.\n\nConstruction\n\n[edit]\n\nThe tower was built by Hamilton Erection Company of York, South Carolina, and Kline Iron and Steel, and required thirty days to complete, at a cost of approximately $500,000[2] (roughly $4.98 million today[3]). Construction was completed August 13, 1963.[4]\n\nOwners\n\n[edit]\n\nOwned by Gray Television of Atlanta, Georgia, the tower broadcasts at 356 kW on channel 36 for television station KVLY-TV (channel 11 PSIP, an NBC/CBS affiliate) which is based in Fargo, North Dakota. The tower provides a broadcast area of roughly 9,700 square miles (25,000 km2), which is a radius of about 55.6 miles (89.5 km). CBS/CW+ affiliate KXJB-LD's translator K28MA-D also broadcasts on this tower at 15 kW on UHF channel 28 (also its virtual channel).\n\nWhen the mast was built, the call letters of the television station for which it was built were changed to KTHI, the \"HI\" referring to the height of the mast. The top is reachable by a two-person service elevator (built by Park Manufacturing of Charlotte, North Carolina) or ladder.\n\nSpecifications\n\n[edit]\n\nThe tower consists of two parts: a lattice tower of 1,950 feet (590 m);[5] topped by the transmitting antenna array of 53 feet (16 m). The total height of both is 1,987 feet (606 m). The antenna weighs 9,000 pounds (4.1 t), the lattice tower weighs 855,500 pounds (388.0 t), giving a total weight of 864,500 pounds (392.1 t). It takes up 160 acres (65 ha) of land with its guy anchors.[6][7] Its height above mean sea level is 2,962 feet (903 m).\n\nFederal rule change\n\n[edit]\n\nSome time after its completion, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) imposed a policy that states, \"Although there is no absolute height limit for antenna towers, both agencies have established a rebuttable presumption against structures over 2,000 feet above ground level.\" The FCC and FAA may approve a taller structure in \"exceptional cases.\"[8]\n\nGallery\n\n[edit]\n\nKVLY tower from a distance of about one mile (1.6 km)\n\nA guy-wire anchor\n\nDetail of the tower, showing its network of guy-wires\n\nSome of the guy-wires that support the tower (with Stockbridge dampers)\n\nLooking up at the KVLY-TV mast from its base\n\nBuilding at the base of the KVLY-TV tower\n\nStructures of similar height\n\n[edit]\n\nKRDK-TV mast (2,060 feet (628 m))\n\nKXTV/KOVR tower (2,049 feet (625 m))\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of tallest structures in the world\n\nList of tallest structures in the United States\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nKVLY Tower at Structurae\n\nTower web page at KVLY-TV\n\n\"Listing 1046244\".
