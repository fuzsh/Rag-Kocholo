        "text": "The best TV antennas net you the best picture quality on the market for all things broadcast and cable TV. These will come in handy as your big tickets to all live sporting events and assorted programs, gifting you uninterrupted and crystal clear image for all of your favorite live TV.\n\nAt Tom's Guide, we know a thing or two about TVs, projectors, and streaming. With our years of knowhow in the industry, you can trust us in finding you the most worthwhile TV antennas to meet your demands. Remember, antennas are what allow you to keep the entertainment flowing without hurting your bank account.\n\nLike, for instance, the Mohu Leaf Supreme Pro. It's marked as a highest among the best TV antennas, as it rounds it a full list of advanced features that make it the most suitable for a wide range of use cases. But, then again, that over $60 price tag is not suitable for everyone, which is where the 1byone Amplified HD Digital TV Antenna comes into play at just $16.\n\nWhether you're lookin for basic indoor antennas, more amplified models, or even larger outdoor options, we've covered the gamut across a wide array of options to choose from. We take into consideration main features and available channels, ensuring that each option among the best TV antennas can meet a slew of different demands.\n\nThe quick list\n\nThe full list: Best TV antennas in detail\n\nFor the best overall TV antenna, it's hard to beat the capable Mohu Leaf Supreme Pro. The wide design goes big to pull in more stations. With a bigger and thicker design than most flat antennas, this chunky antenna boasts a built-in amplifier with an integrated signal-strength meter, helping you find the optimal spot for pulling in channels.\n\nAnd pull in channels it does, leveraging it's wide surface area to nab more than 40 watchable stations, outperforming some of our favorite indoor antennas. The antenna has a unique detachable coax cable and includes a 3-foot USB power cable for powering the amplifier, but it comes rolled up in the box, and does need to spend some time unfurled before it will lay flat. But all of the quirks are worth it for the solid reception it offers, and the Mohu Leaf Supreme Pro is an excellent indoor antenna for suburban areas that may need a boost to get the most channels.\n\nRead our full Mohu Leaf Supreme Pro HDTV Antenna review.\n\nThe best indoor/outdoor antenna\n\nMade for use inside and out, the Antop AT-800SBS HD Smart Panel offers some of the best performance we've seen, easily topping many of the indoor/outdoor models we've reviewed. And with an adjustable amplifier, included mounting hardware and optional FM connection for radio, it's a versatile best HD antenna option for anyone who's serious about cord-cutting.\n\nThe Antop AT-800SBS also has a table-top stand for indoor use, but this 85-mile antenna was at its best out in the elements, where it pulled in 68 watchable stations. A 40-foot cable is included for easy installation, and the adjustable amplifier lets you dial in the right amount of power boost to help you grab the stations you want. It's the best indoor/outdoor antenna we've tested, and well worth the premium price.\n\nRead our full Antop AT-800SBS HD Smart Panel Antenna review.\n\nThe best budget antenna\n\nFor a simple indoor antenna that offers everything you need to cut the cord, the 1byone Amplified Indoor HDTV Antenna offers a 50-mile range and included amplifier, all for a fairly reasonable price. With slick packaging and a basic black design, it's not only an Amazon best-seller, but it's also one of the best TV antennas we've reviewed.\n\nMeasuring just 13.3 x 9.3 inches, the antenna includes everything you need to connect to the TV, with a 10-foot coaxial cable and included adhesive patches for mounting. The simple design and included amplifier delivered dozens of watchable channels and can plug into any wall outlet or USB port. There's a good reason the 1byone is a top Amazon seller: It performs well and doesn't cost a lot.\n\nRead our full 1byone Amplified Indoor HDTV Antenna review.\n\nThe best outdoor antenna\n\nSometimes an indoor antenna just won't cut it. When you need an outdoor antenna with excellent reception, the Winegard Elite 7550 is the smart option, and the best TV antenna for outdoor installation. It may cost a little more, but the Winegard Elite 7550 pays dividends, delivering a whopping 73 channels in our tests. Whether you're in a crowded city or a rural community, this outdoor HDTV should get the job done, pulling in more channels with better signal than any indoor model can offer.\n\nIf you're having difficulty getting local stations you want — or you just want better, more consistent reception — the Winegard Elite 7550's $120 price tag is worth every penny, pulling in dozens of free channels for less than a month's cable subscription.\n\nRead our full Winegard Elite 7550 Outdoor HDTV Antenna review.\n\nThe budget indoor/outdoor antenna\n\nWhile its aesthetics may leave something to be desired, the ClearStream MAX-V is a very capable antenna that delivers more stations than even competing amplified antennas, even models costing much more. If you want to improve over-the-air TV reception, it's one of the best TV antennas we've reviewed.\n\nRated to capture stations as far away as 60 miles, the ClearStream MAX-V from Antennas Direct will work indoors or out and is competitively priced. Not only did it do better than many of our favorite indoor antennas, it also matched some of the best outdoor antennas, making it a great choice for mounting on a roof, hanging in an attic or just tucking it out of sight – which may be difficult given the bulky figure-8 design.\n\nRead our full ClearStream MAX-V HDTV Antenna review.\n\nThe biggest indoor antenna\n\nLike our favorite indoor antenna, the Mohu Leaf Supreme Pro, the Gateway Plus can pull in dozens of channels with its 60-mile range and shows you how strong of a signal it’s receiving with its four front LEDs.\n\nSpeaking of reception, the Gateway Plus is designed to be multi-directional, meaning it can be placed forwards or backwards and should be able to still receive a signal. That said, the front of the antenna has the LED signal indicator lights, so you’ll probably want those facing inside so you can see them.\n\nFor us, the Mohu Gateway Plus was incredibly solid. It picked up 41 channels with an astounding 34 of them playing flawlessly. Yes, there was still the occasional stutter — especially in the morning when there was inclement weather — but on a sunny day the Mohu Gateway Plus managed to surpass our top TV antenna, the Mohu Leaf Supreme Pro.\n\nRead our full Mohu Gateway Plus review.\n\nBest TV Antennas Test Results\n\nHow to choose the best antenna for you\n\nHow to choose the best TV antenna for you\n\nIf you're shopping for a TV antenna, you're in luck, because there's no better option for getting live TV for the lowest price possible: Free! But before you pick up the first TV antenna you see at the store, you want to make sure that you're getting one that will work for you.\n\nLocation and range: If you're in or near a city, there's a good chance you can make do with a small indoor antenna, since you'll have several stations within a 10 or 20 mile radius that can be pulled in without a big aerial or powered amplifier. If you're more than 30 miles from your local broadcast tower, you'll want to step up to an amplified model. Any antenna that's rated for 50 miles or more will either be a large outdoor unit, or come with an amplifier to boost the signal it gets, if not both.\n\nIndoor or outdoor: Whether or not to get an outdoor antenna will largely depend upon the building you're in and the surrounding environment, since obstacles like house walls and even trees can prevent signal from getting through to an indoor antenna. Outdoor antennas are larger, and work better when positioned as high up as you can get it – a rooftop mast being the ideal installation.\n\nNon-amplified or amplified: An amplified antenna uses an additional signal strength booster that can help weak signals come in clearly with a little extra juice. But that also means having another device to plug in, and another power outlet to give up. It also means a slightly higher price.\n\nNon-amplified indoor antennas generally sell for between $20 to $40, but there are plenty of cheap TV antennas that sell for less than $20 that offer acceptable performance. An amplified antenna offers better performance, and will cost between $30 and $100. For the best performance, consider an outdoor antenna, which costs $100 or more.\n\nGetting an antenna is the first step toward cutting the cord or pulling in free local channels. You don't need to spend a lot of money – the best cheap TV antennas do a great job, and even a $12 set of bunny ears might do the trick – and you don't even need a TV. (Check out I just discovered a new way to cut the cord — and there’s no subscription fee to learn about USB tuners that don't need a TV.)\n\nBut simply having an antenna won't automatically solve all of your over-the-air TV woes. Better antennas and optional amplifiers will go a long way toward bringing in more channels, but that's only part of the equation.\n\nWe recommend researching beforehand to determine what range of antenna you need, and whether you want an indoor model or an antenna made for outdoor installation. The best place to start is AntennaWeb.org, which lets you enter your address or ZIP code and see what stations are broadcasting in your area, as well as how far away the broadcast towers are.\n\nWorried about future proofing for ATSC 3.0 as it rolls out to new cities? The good news is that your existing antenna will work, and may even pull in more channels under the new standard. The bad news is that you'll need to buy a new tuner or an ATSC 3.0-equipped TV, and these are only now coming to market.\n\nAnd check out our other advice for TV antennas to help you get yourself properly equipped and set up for the best reception:\n\nTop cheap TV antennas (under $20) ranked best to worst\n\nHow to get better reception with your TV antenna\n\nHelp Me, Tom's Guide: Is my antenna cable causing signal loss?\n\nUsing a TV antenna with smart TVs and streaming devices\n\nWhile streaming services like Netflix and HBO Max may be taking a more prominent place in the living room, there's still room for over-the-air (OTA) broadcast TV. Whether you want free access to local news or just want to get more sports without shelling out for another subscription service, an HDTV antenna can still provide plenty of great stuff to watch, and having a smart TV or one of the best streaming devices doesn't prevent using an antenna.\n\nAll of the best smart TVs for streaming also have built-in tuners for pulling in broadcast channels, and getting your TV channels programmed is an automatic process, with the TV scanning for stations and putting together a browsable channel guide in just a few minutes.\n\nAnd several streaming devices are built with OTA content in mind. The Amazon Fire TV Cube, for example, can switch over to your TV's built-in tuner seamlessly, without having to swap TV inputs or juggle extra remote controls. You can even get something like the Amazon Fire TV Recast, a DVR that lets you record OTA content, and enjoy it all using the same Fire TV interface your TV might already be using.\n\nHow we test the best TV antennas\n\nAll of the TV antennas we review are tested in the same location. Each antenna is connected to the same TV, so the TV tuner remains consistent, and each one is placed in the same position to generate comparable results.\n\nWe're located just a few miles outside of a major metropolitan area, a location that provides an excellent testing location for antenna reception of any range, with more sensitive, long-range antennas pulling in a higher number of channels. It also gives us a chance to determine the quality of that reception, by seeing whether or not those channels are clear and watchable. The best antennas will pull in more channels, with a higher number of watchable results.\n\nYour experience may differ from our test results. Depending upon how many stations broadcast in you area, and unique geographical impediments to over the air signal – such as buildings, trees and mountains – your own channel selection will vary considerably.\n\nCheck out some of the best accessories for your TV:\n\nBest TV mounts | Best Bluetooth TV adapters | Best Bluetooth speakers | Best Soundbars | Best cheap HDMI switchers"
