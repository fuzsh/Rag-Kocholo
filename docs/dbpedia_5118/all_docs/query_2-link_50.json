        "text": "Hi @tsb273 ,\n\nThe signal strength of the TV channels being received by the TV is fluctuating on the threshold of being of an acceptable level for the TV and of not being of an acceptable level.\n\nWith digital TV signals it is a case of either it works or it doesn’t, unlike analogue TV signals where you may get a snowy picture if the signal level is too low for a good picture.\n\nIs the problem on just the one channel or on all channels?\n\nUse the TV’s inbuilt signal strength meter to check the strength of the TV signals received by the TV. You have to exit the menu and change channels then re-enter the menu for the signal meter to view the levels for each channel\n\n(click on image to enlarge for better viewing)\n\nIf all the TV channels’ signals are low or varying, first try enabling the LNA setting, (low noise amplifier, setting below the signal strength setting) and check if this improves the signal and stabilizes the reception.\n\nIf the TV is connected to an outdoor TV antenna:\n\nIf by enabling the LNA setting it is still no good and the signal comes and goes, use the internet to find the location of the TV broadcast transmitters used for your area and then ensure that the TV antenna is pointed in the direction of the transmitter in relation to your location or look at other antennas in the neighbourhood and check if your antenna is pointed in the same direction. Also check that the antenna itself looks in good condition (at least as best that you can tell), no bent, damaged or hanging dipoles etc\n\nYou may have to physically move the antenna’s direction, by turning the mast, and check if the signal strength improves. Do this in small increments not large swings.\n\nIf it is still no good, is the antenna outlet that the TV is connected to the only TV antenna outlet for the premises?\n\nIf not or even if it is you may have to check the antenna cable connections from the antenna down to the wall outlet. If there are more outlets you may have to check if the antenna cable splitter is OK and its’ connections are OK as well as the connections on the other outlets.\n\nIf they are all OK and it is still no good you may be in a low signal area (what is the TV reception like for your neighbours?) or there may be obstacles in the path between you and the TV transmitter, e.g. trees, tall buildings, low hills etc.\n\nTry installing a masthead amplifier _ example only as close to the TV antenna as possible to improve the signal strength. It is called a “masthead” amplifier because it is mounted on the TV antenna mast or pole, usually directly under the antenna to reduce the amount of signal lost in the cable from the antenna before it is amplified, thereby providing more signal to the TV than if the amplifier was inside near the TV.\n\nIf the TV is connected to an indoor TV antenna:\n\nIf by enabling the LNA setting it is still no good you may either have to invest in an indoor antenna amplifier -examples only or get an external antenna installed\n\nIf the TV is connected to the RF output of a “box” of some description:\n\nIf by enabling the LNA setting it is still no good try connecting the TV directly to the signal source that connects into the “box” and see if this improves the signal strength and stabilizes the picture. If so the cable between the “box” and the TV may be faulty or the “box” is faulty"
