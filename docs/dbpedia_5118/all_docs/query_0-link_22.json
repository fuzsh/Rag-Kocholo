Sponsors to spend $600 M on TV in 1952 Silver Star blades starts $600,000 news campaign New Ziv show boost to local programing DuMont launches merchandising service Original SPONSOR research on radio listening in TV homes (see new de- partment, page 60) points up importance of out-of-home audience today. Data, gathered for SPONSOR by Advertest Research during first 2 weeks December 1951, shows only 8.1% respondents did most of their AM lis- tening out-of-home before buying TV set. After TV, out-of-home rises in relative importance with 18.3% listening most outside homes. Ad- vertest study, first of series commissioned by SPONSOR, was done in New York metropolitan area among 749 respondents. -SR- Sponsors will spend over $600 million on web and spot TV in '52. That's estimate made for SPONSOR by Bob McFadyen, NBC-TV sales plan- ning & research manager. In recent speech before American Marketing Association, McFadyen also said total TV advertising in '51 was about $450 million — 2% times '50 total. P&G alone spent over $10 million. -SR- American Safety Razor Corp. , Brooklyn (via McCann-Erickson) is launch- ing $600,000-plus early-morning news schedule over 70 radio AM sta- tions in 56 markets for Silver Star blades. Ad Manager Buddy Solomon told SPONSOR campaign is result of successful testing of \"Frank Goss\" 3-times-weekly news shows on Columbia Pacific Network. -SR- Vitality of local radio programing, which has been given boost recent- ly by NBC launching of new co-op shows (Minute Man series), gets new push this month with release of Frederic W. Ziv Company show — \"I Was a Communist for the FBI.\" Show has $12,500 weekly production nut, will bring Ziv invesement in new programing over past year to $2,548,- 000. Transcription firms are only radio entities now making big out- lays for new programing. -SR- Unlike AM webs, which waited long time before start of merchandising services for sponsors, Du Mont is first TV web to initiate merchandis- ing department. New 3-man unit is headed by Edward Kletter, 44, ex- V.P. United Cigar-Whelan Stores. H? told SPONSOR: \"Department will stress food, drug advertisers' point-of-sales merchandising, using cards, posters, promotional tie-ins.\" Ben Bodec joins SPONSOR as executive editor Ben Bodec, New York and Chicago tradepaper reporter and editor since the early '30' s and later advertising agency executive, became executive editor of SPONSOR effective 7 January. At J. Walter Thompson Bodec specialized in tal- ent and program development and at Kenyon & Eckhardt he served as talent and program buyer in addition to being a member of the radio/TV plans committee. He was also vice president in charge of radio and television for General Ar- tists Corp. In early 1931 Bodec joined VARIETY where he worked 14 years as reporter, radio editor, and associate editor. ; York 22. $8 a Itl POICT TO SPONSORS for I l Ian nary l!>>2 TV thaw to mean trickle of stations in action Metal shortages won't hit new TV operators Negro market's scope revealed in N.

That's view of F. P. Barnes, General Electric 's TV equipment salesmanager. He told SPONSOR GE already had sold more than 10 transmitters to would-be TV station operators who've put them in warehouses. Because of flood of station applicants, he predicts no more than \"3 or 4\" new stations will be on air in '52. -SR- Prediction above was corroborated to SPONSOR by spokesman for National Production Authority, Washington. Official said \"we'll be allocating transmitter and tower material in new year — and metal shortages won't be serious.\" He expected \"less than a handful\" of new TV stations to be on air, all of them using VHF rather than experimental UHF trans- mitters. (For full details on f reeze-lif ting outlook see page 32.) -SR- Importance of Negro market in New York emphasized in 6-month survey conducted by WLIB, independent specializing in programing to Negro and Jewish groups. Key findings: (1) Income of average Negro family has tripled since 1940; ( 2 ) 95.7% of all employable Negroes were working as of August 1951; (3) more than 200,000 New York Negroes have new homes; (4) Negro population in New York is 1,012,883, larger than Cleveland, St. Louis, Boston — or equivalent of sixth U. S. city in size; (5) Negro preference is almost exclusively for nationally adver- tised brand-name products. -SR- Manager Halsey V. Barrett, Consolidated TV Sales, reports 5 sponsors buying Jerry Fairbanks film, \"Front Page Detective,\" for national spot TV. New users of 59 episode half-hour whodunit shows are: Wine Grow- ers Guild of America (via Guild, Bascom & Bonfigli) ; National Brewing (Owen & Chappell) ; Blatz Beer (Kast or-Farrell'-Chesley & Clifford). -SR- Henry I. Christal Company , which on 1 January began actively represent- ing its first client, WDAF, Kansas City, is doing a turnabout by de- clining TV representation. Will specialize in big-audience radio sta- tions. WHAS, Louisville, joins Christal string 22 March; unnamed other stations may team up earlier. New York office is 300 Park Ave- nue; Chicago office is located at 333 N. Michigan Avenue. -SR- Despite gloom about network radio during 1951, P.I.B. figures for first 11 months of year show only 4.5% decline in net billings from same period previous year. Total in 1951 was $160,100,000, only $7,- 600,000 below 1950's $167,700,000. ABC was down $2,000,000 from 532,400,000; CBS was down $700,000 from $64,200,000; Mutual was up SI, 400, 000 from $14,800,000; NBC was down $6,300,000 from $56,300,000. -SR- Problem of clearing TV web time is. underlined by Bristol-Myers-NBC-TV hassle over \"Break The Bank.\" Because sponsor, which had been with NBC 25 years, had shifted several radio shows to ABC, NBC sold \"Break The Bank\" Wednesday night slot to other advertiser. In huff, Bristol- Myers shifted Ed Wolf TV package to CBS-TV, beginning 13 January, Sun- day, 9-30 to 10:00 p.m. Radio \"Break The Bank\" is still on ABC.

Their President is therefore in a perfect position to appraise KWKH's impact in rural areas. Here's what he recently wrote us: jljL few months ago I was named distributor for Nutrena Feeds in the Shreveport area, and I was rather amazed to learn that the manufacturer, Cargill, Inc., was using only one radio station, KWKH, to cover this area. Now I know why. This station reaches most of the farm families in my territory. They are thoroughly familiar with the product and with the radio program. Also, I have found this radio advertising helps me a lot in lining up new dealers. Those boys at the Bruce B. Brewer agency certainly knew what they were doing when they picked KWKH.

La On bfoiritif/ off people's eyebrows It i-. this column suggests, a fine thing for the industry, and art. of television thai there is (starting this week i a series of programs frankl) dedicated to \"experiment.\" We refer to CBS' third incarna- tion of the Columbia Workshop which, as a radio series, ran from the summer of 1936 through the spring of 1942: then was revived. for 52 week-, in 1946. Television's need of a Workshop is greater than was radio's, for TV tends, because of program costs, to practice a deplorable sameness lor a medium so young. In its time the Columbia Workshop was perhaps the most famous \"prestige*1 series of all radio, excepting onl\\ the far-more-costly Toscanini concerts at NBC. Curiously enough the Workshop story was never painted on anything like full canvas until 12 & 26 Feb- ruary 1951. when this publication featured a two-part histor\\ . The research for these articles proved formidable indeed since Workshop myth kept getting in the wa\\ of Workshop fact. Some weeks the CBS publicity department had been the unstarred star, its effusions flying well ahead of the actual studio performance. But no matter the razzle dazzle, no matter the obscure boundary between Workshop art and individual ego or the saga that was mostly ga-ga. The WOrkshop was in 1936 and 1937 \"Very definitely the bright young radio man's kind of show. Network officials awakened to aspects of their medium they had not suspected. Advertisers had their eyes opened. English professors were suddenly qui vive to a new art. Writers competed for the honor of selling the Workshop a script.'\" It is fair to emphasize the \"publicity \" side of the original Work- shop. Way back in FDR's second administration CBS never had it so nice, publicity-wise, thanks to the Workshop. There were won- derfully lucky breaks, including the unrestrained infatuation, just then, of Time magazine with anything written for radio by Archibald MacLeish. \"For nearly a year and a half Irving Reis did pretty much what he liked, subject only to budget. Perhaps nobod) in radio history ever for so long a time, as human rapture is reckoned, en- joyed comparable carte blanche\" in production as did the founding father of the Workshop. * * * \"In mans direct and indirect wa\\s the Workshop stimulated ad- vertisers, agencies, writers, directors, critics. It led a vitalizing stream of new ideas, brains, blood, and personalities into the me- dium.\" It often \"broke rigid limits needlessh imposed upon the medium b\\ narrow minds.

In fact, it will be a real feat to get a station on the air in Port- land by 1()54. I think the basic fallacy in your time estimate is due to this: you ignore the fact that in each of these markets there will undoubtedly be more applicants than available channels — thus necessi- tating a hearing.

It is more than good reporting; there is an editorial between every line which to me demonstrates once again how deeply and conscientiously you strive to help sponsor and broadcaster co-ordinate their efforts to their mu- tual advantage. Merchandising by media is, of course, a controversial subject. At one extreme are those who virtually break their necks helping their advertisers sell products: at the other extreme are those who won't lift a finger. And in between are as many variations as there are people. The trick is to find out who does what. I recall an effort you made along that line last year (\"Merchandising is like fingerprints'* — sponsor 23 August and 11 September 19501. I was grati- fied then that many of the stations em- ploying our service were included in your listing of \"merchandisers\" and I am gratified now to announce that they still believe in giving the sponsor their full cooperation. We recentlv polled them on iheir willingness to go beyond dealer letters, lobby displav. space advertising and personal check- up on dealers' counters and window display. Here are some of the answers we have received to our questionnaire: \"We will try to locate wholesal- ers and/or distributors for products advertising on our station.\" The TeePee Stations.

Sept. <<>■ WEMP-FM MILWAUKEE L A. L. Blinder ■other President rciture Co., Chicago The depression year of 1932 was hardly considered a rosy time to start a new business, But. Milwaukee-born Abe Blinder did just that in Chicago — and to the satisfying tune of a million and a half dollars in volume the first year. Todifj . 20 years and three Chicago furniture stores later, plus one in Milwaukee, sales volume is well over $4,000,000. Abe Blinder unhesitatingly credits radio. \"Radio built our business.\" lie >a\\-. \"As trade flourished, we added newspaper and TV advertising. But we still find it profitable to spend 60\" of our current $350,000 ap- propriation on radio.\" I$2y2 to 3.000,000 on radio alone since the first store was opened.) However, it's not just a question of money spent. Forty-five-year- old Blinder has definite ideas on radio sell. He reminisces: \"When people responded to a radio advertisement in the \"30's, it was a new- experience. They'd come into the stores to talk about the artists and radio itself . . . but they were skeptical of air ad claims. Today, radio is no novelty, so sincerity and style of copy are all-important. We play up the 'sell'; play down the 'personality'.\"' Neither \"sell\" or sinceritv are a problem for Blinder. He combines Loth with skill. His chief air outlets: Chicago's WBBM and WGN. with programing as varied and in good taste as the furniture he sells. Programs have run from an Irish balladeer (1933) and the first man-on-the-street show with Pat Flannigan I 1934), to a variety show, man-on-the-street stint currently on WGN. Also on the air, on WBBM, are Theatre of Thrills, sports, news and music shows. \\ll this is directed at the family. \"Women do the buying and men pa\\. so both have to be thoroughly sold,\" Blinder believes. For this thorough selling, radio copy is limited to a maximum of five separate furniture items with prices always mentioned. News- papers ami TV complete the ad setting and help keep Nelson Brothers \"First in Furniture.\" Still, Blinder won't settle hack into a comfortable Nelson Brothers easj (hair. Hobbies? None. For outside activities. Blinder main- lain- memberships in several Chicago and Milwaukee business bu- reaus and furniture associations. Ill Dwighi Cr« on W HUM wit • • • (r.)

Subject: New developments on SPONSOR stories •• \\li«r midnight\" 13 February 1950, p. 28 D.J.'s from coast to roast are pull- in <r sales for advertisers in the wee hours of the morning Radio d.j.'s are as numerous as TV cowboys and, like the video range riders, they're top hands at sales. One of the newest of the night owl tune spinners perking up advertiser ears is KFWB's Larry Finlev in Hollywood. His midnight to 4:00 a.m. program, the Larry Finley Show, started as a sustainer about three months ago. The locale: Kings Restau- rant, the \"Toots Shor of Los Angeles.\" By now 11 sponsors have picked up the tab, including 330 Motors, Rhodes Jewelers, Berman's House of Style, Sampson Electric Com- pany, Biltwell Furniture Company, Roger Shoe Stores, TV Remote Control, Virgil Appliance Company, and Kitch Queen Dish Washers. Secret of this quick sponsorship lies in Finley 's commercial ap- proach. All commercials are ad libbed, and he makes this statement: \"There is a money back guarantee to the listener on anything they buy on the Larry Finley Show because of the arrangement I have with my advertisers.\" Typical pitch for 330 Motors permits listeners to select any car they like; drive it for 48 hours without any obligation. At the end of that time, if they don't want it, they can return it to 330 Motors without any charge. This technique sold over 19 cars in four days. Sales alone aren't the only indication of audience response after midnight. Finley, in his first six weeks of airing, received 17,500 letters, some from as far east as Nashville, as far south as Mexico, and as far north as Alaska. Phone calls now average 275 an evening. And, the final clincher, Kings Restaurant says business is up 400% since the inaugural program with the place filled to capacity by 2:00 a.m. On week-end nights, they open the banquet rooms to accommo- date an extra 250 persons. See: \"How to win with Juan\" |W Issue: 4 June 1951, p. 25 ILA Subject: 3.500.000 Spanish-speaking people provide fertile sales field for wide- awake advertisers The West Coast Packing Corporation (Compagna tomato paste and Far Famed tuna I and RCA Victor (records and TV sets) com- bined radio and TV sponsorships of the Rose Parade on New Year's Day to double their impact on the Spanish-speaking audience. Under a novel promotional agreement, KFVD, Los Angeles, for RCA Victor, presented a Spanish parade commentary by Eddie Rod- riguez. He, in turn, constantly reminded listeners to dial Channel 9 for the parade telecast. Then, on Channel 9, West Coast Packing utilized visual commercials I KHJ-TV-Don Lee, Los Angeles) to reach the more than 100,000 TV families of Mexican descent in the Los Angeles area. On the radio side statistically, there's a potential listening audience of 500,000 in seven southern California counties. While the RCA Victor- West Coast Packing approach is something new in co-promotional efforts, they're hitting a market that's rich in sales payoffs. Other advertisers attracted to this area include P. Lorillard, Borden, Pet Sales, Carnation, Best Foods, Procter & Gam- ble, Pepsi-Cola and Quaker Oats. Their key finding: Spanish-speak- ing customers prefer to listen to advertising than to read it.

Hebraska Farmer $60,000,000 is poured annually into farm spaee by ad leaders, yet farm AM's often overlooked ®Leaf through any typical copy of the better-known farm pub- lications, like Farm Journal, Nebraska Farmer, Country Gentle- man, Prairie Farmer, and Wallace's Farmer. You'll find them well stocked with advertising — and not just with ads from firms who have farm machin- ery or feed for sale. There are plenty of consumer adver- tisers using these publications, and us- ing them on a fancy scale with spe- cially-designed ads and copy slants for farm readers. Here are a few: General Motors ($10,000,000 spent in farm publica tions last year) ; General Foods ($9, 000,000) ; Ford Motor Company ($5, 000,000); R. J. Reynolds ($4,500, 000); Lever Brothers ($3,000,000) There's a long list that follows, includ- ing nearly all major advertisers with the notable exception of Procter & Gamble, as good-sized users of farm publications. Then, make your own check-up to find how many of these advertisers go after the same $17-billion farm market with specially-tailored farm radio cam- paigns. SPONSOR did — and the result was a shock. Practically none of these major ad- vertisers were using what could be properly called a \"farm radio cam- paign.\" Practically all of them used broadcast advertising in a general way, but when it came to a pinpoint ap- proach to the rural customer, farm publications got the nod. When sponsor asked leading adver- tisers, agencies, farm stations and sta- tion reps, as well as industry associa- tions like Broadcast Advertising Bu- reau and the International Association of Radio Farm Directors, to explain this seeming paradox, the answer usu- ally went like this: \"Sure, most big advertisers are aware that the farm market is a huge consumer market, out of all proportion to numbers. But there still isn't the proper kind of information available, the right kind of research, and enough good result stories to wake them up to the usefulness of farm radio.\" Whose fault is it that more media promotion isn't done for farm radio? The blame rests on the shoulders of the broadcasters. Yet there are hope- ful signs. The BAB has plans in the works to make special presentations during 1952 covering the latest infor- mation on farm radio, but hasn't had a chance to do much so far. A few big stations with large rural listening — like WLW, KVOO, WNAX, WLS, KWKH, WSM, WWL, WFAA, WHO, WOW, and others — have done a good job in promoting themselves to primarily- farm accounts, but have had only lim- ited success in promoting to more \"general\" air clients. There's still noth- ing in the field of farm radio that com- pares to the slick media promotions done by the Agricultural Publishers Association, and other industry groups of farm publications. The maior national advertiser, who has decided that farm radio can do a job for him. has to go through an enor- Missouri Ruralist -\"GptJer's CONSUMER ADVERTISERS USE FARM PAPERS APLENTY Feiv of these consumer products are sold specifically to farmers via radio, yet all were sold via two issues of typical farm papers* Conoco Products Cheerios Dreft Folger's Coffee Standard Oil products Timken Silent heaters Sunkist Lemons Robin Hood Flour Greyhound Bus Lines United Air Lines Northwestern Bell Tel. i Motor Oil Weed Tire Chains Ben-Hur home freezers Ball-Band overshoes Mobiloil, Mobilube Quaker cereals Banker's Life Insurance 1st Fed. Savings & Loan Fleischmann's Yeast KVOOs Schneider (I.) is typical farm radio director, helped prepare SPONSOR survey which is covered in article on these pages mous amount of digging to get his facts on farm radio. The size of this job is enough to scare anyone away, and usually does. Farm publications, at that point, often win out by de- fault. Too often advertisers forget that farmers love radio. And since TV (ex- cept in parts of New York State, New Jersey, and Ohio) leaves the farm mar- ket practically untouched, radio is still the greatest mass medium of farm au- diences. It's not at all unusual for a bi<i farm to have from eight to 12 ra- dios, plus others in cars, trucks, trac- tors and barns. A recent series of pub- lic utility surveys, taken in farm areas, showed that about nine out of 10 farmers bought a radio set in 1951 — and most of these were extra sets (port- ables, car radios, table models). Rural electrification is still making rapid strides, now serves 950 of farmers. The last big survey made by Rural Re- search. Inc.. in 1950 showed that farm radio saturation was 99.20' — about y '( higher than the nation's average. I pcoming surveys will probably show- near-saturation. Reasons for the farm- ir - hoi interest in radio follow. Farmers depend on their radios as few other groups do. Being business- men, they turn to their radios for everything from the latest farm weath- er reports to agricultural or stock-rais- ing advice. Farm families, listen avid- ly to all sorts of general programing. Better-off than the average American, they buy more radio-sold products per capita than any other comparable seg- ment of the U.S. (For typical farm radio results stories, see the opposite page.) It's more-than-ever worthwhile to reach the nation's farm audiences through radio. Farm income is up again, after a 1948-through-1950 slump in which farm income fell off 27% due to a round of warm winters, cold springs, droughts and floods. As a market, the nation's farmers are today a sizable slice of the population, and have money to spend on everything from farm tools to luxury items. Some symptoms: • After hitting 17.8 billion in net realized farm income in 1947, the curves on the Department of Agricul- ture graphs of 1949 plunged down to a post-war low of 13.0 billions. In 1951, however, they snapped back early in the year, went on to hit 16.9 billions. 1952 expectations, as sponsor went to press, are even higher, and may hit 17.5 billions, according to Department of Agriculture projections. • Even with all this money to spend on everything from labor-saving de- vices to luxuries, the farmer's stand- ard of living still doesn't compare with his more urban cousins. There's room in virtually every farm home, accord- ing to the authoritative Farm Journal, for more electrical appliances, furni- ture, clothing, insurance, hardware, autos, radio sets, etc. • Although there are fewer people, when noses are counted, living on U.S. farms today — about a million less than at the same time last year — this is more than offset by the step-up in income. It's still a giant market. In April of 1952, there will be about 22,250,000 people living on some 6,000,000 farms in this country, according to the Bu- reau of Census. Average farm income will be $4,500 and up, with some mam- moth farms going into the $500,000 bracket. That's a quick picture of where the nation's farm market stands today. But, what about farm radio as a means of reaching this audience? To learn what sponsors themselves thought about farm radio, SPONSOR several months ago enlisted the help of Sam B. Schneider, Farm Director of Tulsa's 50 k.w. station KVOO, and re- cently elected president of the IARFD. Schneider made a special survey among advertisers for SPONSOR. Re- sults of questionnaires returned to Schneider in his International Associa- tion of Radio Farm Directors survey are here released exclusively for the first time. The opinions expressed by these advertisers show that old and new advertisers give glowing accounts about their use of farm radio. The IARFD survey also points up new op- portunities and ideas for advertisers and broadcasters. NOTE: It's pertinent to point out that the IARFD-sponsor survey had to FARM AIR USERS ARE MOSTLY FARM-PRODUCT FIRMS LIKE NEW IDEA (LEFT); BROCK CANDY (RIGHT) IS THE EXCEPTION BROCK - Eight farm radio success stories confine itself to primarily-farm adver- tisers, since few \"general\" advertisers are using farm radio. However, a lit- tle checking will show these latter ad- \\( srtisers that there are many outstand- ing entertainment shows, early-morn- ing shows and folk-music shows avail- able. Stations who air these shows in farm areas will be only too glad to point out results achieved in the past, as well as opportunities for new farm radio advertisers in the future.) Here are highlights from the IARFD- sponsor survey. They include re- plies from Chicago's Lehon Company iMulehide Roofing), Limestone Prod- ucts Corporation of America (Lime Crest calcite products), Consumer's Cooperative Association of Kansas City. Hercules Powder Company (tech- nical materials for formulators) , Pet- rolane Gas (liquid petroleum), Kerr Hatcheries (baby chicks, etc.), d-Con Company (rat killers), Consolidated Products Company (pig and chick emulsions, etc.) . Here's what these ad- vertisers, who have been using farm radio anywhere from one to 21 years, had to say about this type of airselling: Q. Did the advertisers find farm ra- dio effective, and if so, what did they like about it? A. Reactions in this direction were universally favorable among the re- spondents. They liked farm radio just fine. Comments ranged from that of Alvin Eicoff, ad manager of the d-Con Company (\"Radio has done a miracu- lous job for us. We are using every major farm station we can get — all very successfully\") to the statement of Frank Baker of Reincke, Meyer & Finn, ad agency for Lehon Company ( \"Dealer reaction is very favorable.\"). Others complimented farm radio on its ability to supplement farm magazine advertising, to do a good job in prod- uct introductions, but above all in get- ting results. Q. How did they split up their ad budgets, and where did farm radio fit in? A. For the 75% of the panel who let their hair down in this ticklish poser, there was interesting and easily- recognized trend. The longer the firm had been using farm radio, the more money was spent in it. This ranged from small increases to large increases. Examples: (1) Kansas City's Consum- er Cooperative Association, which had Water Systems A. Y. McDonald Co., manufacturer oj home water systems and plumbing supplies, bought a five-minute show daily at 5:40 a.m. for $10 per pro- gram. Show featured Chuck Worcester, the stations Farm Service Director. To prosperous Iowa farmers, Chuck sold the merits of $1,500 water sys- tems, landed 298 choice prospects in a week's time. Cost to the advertiser: about 20tf per prospect. Pgm: Farm News, WMT, Cedar Rapids Farm Equipment International Harvester distributor in Woodland, Cal. is going into his fifth successful year of sponsoring an early-morning farm shoiv, selling wide line of IH equipment, freezers. This is the only air advertising done by the dealer (Graco) .

Q. Can current farm radio be im- proved, and if so, how? A. Respondents to the KV00-SP0N- sor study gave some pretty frank an- swers on this one. Yes, most of them thought farm radio could stand some improvement, sponsor herewith passes ONE-SHOTS on some of the more pertinent remarks for the mutual benefit of farm radio advertisers and broadcasters. \"Keep abreast with programing as farmers modernize their thinking. Need more music and news — and how to farm better with new methods\" I from Consolidated Products, now us- ing spot announcements on some 64 radio stations) . \"Put agricultural programs at pref- erable hours\" (from Limestone Prod- ucts, now using announcements on sev- en stations. NOTE: Limestone had reference to changing living habits in certain farm areas, due to increased income. Actually, most stations do keep a close check on farm listening tastes.) \"Farm directors . . . should ad-lib commercials, not read word-for-word script\" (from d-Con Company.). NOTE: in sponsor's Farm Facts Handbook this was covered thoroughly in \"The faltering farm commercial.\" More and more, stations are getting hep to the value of \"integrated\" com- mercials by farm directors, presented in the farmer's language. \"We need more case histories. Puf- fery and flattering adjectives unneces- sary in this connection. Facts are what we want!\" (from Reincke, Meyer & Finn, ad agency for Lehon Company). [When the preceding survey results were in, SPONSOR decided that it had a question of its own to ask KVOO's Sam Schneider, who is representative for many hard-working radio farm di- rectors in all parts of the nation, and now heads up their national organiza- tion.] Q. Tell us, Sam Schneider, why do you think these advertisers have turned to farm-area radio campaigns in ever- increasing amounts? A. \"Refore I answer that, you must realize that several of these advertisers are turning to the farmers as a con- sumer market, with radio to reach them, for the first time. \"This has come about with the reali- zation that the farmer is a great and relatively untouched market for many products. Not just because he has as much money as some people picture, but because farming is not a \"one gallus\" operation any more, but a mechanized operation. \"Today's farmer has to buy many products of industry to operate his farm. Yesterday, he could get by with a pair of pliers, his baling wire, salt, sugar, snuff and flour. Today, he is a major market for all types of tractors, trucks, implements, machinery, power- driven farm appliances, and suchlike. Also, at the same time, he is using many more consumer products he nev- er used to buy. \"I think, personally, that many of these advertisers have turned to farm service radio, because this new profes- sion is emerging as a definite and de- pendable means of reaching this audi- ence. The profession is notabl] com- SPONSOR ing of ajre, and is finding proof of its ability to influence the purchase of merchandise and services in farm areas.\" SPONSOR feels that the above survey reports will be useful to both veteran and newcomer advertisers in the pros- perous farm market, as well as to broadcasters. They should serve as a guide in planning air campaigns dur- ing 1952. For what these advertisers and agen- cymen told KVOO's Sam Schneider is very typical of what is being said and thought today regarding farm radio by other leading admen. At the recent (24-25 November) an- nual convention of the National Asso- ciation of Radio Farm Directors in Chicago, farm radio directors heard almost the same thing in panel discus- sions where admen were the guests. Arthur Meyerhoff, well-known Chi- cago agencyman, told the farm broad- casters how he thought farm radio could be improved. For one thing, he felt that farm radio should steer away from strictly \"show business\" pro- graming. Said the Chicago adman: \"I would rather settle for a smaller but more effective audience saleswise, com- bining informational talk with com- mercial talk rather than music with a spoken commercial. Radio does its best selling job when the farmer is given information he can use. It isn't easy to get the idea over to the farmer, but it pays off when you do.\" Speaking from experience, Meyer- hoff, whose agency handles advertising for such well-known clients as Illinois Meat Company and William Wrigley, Jr., had a warning for clients who are often prone to expect overnight results from farm radio. Said he: \"The best results for both the editorial matter in an information show as well as the commercial comes between six months and a year after the message has been introduced.\" Later on. Marshall Smith, an execu- tive of St. Louis' Gardner agency. which places farm radio shows and schedules on some 500 stations for Ral- ston, aired some of his thoughts on farm radio. Smith told the farm radio- men that more thought should be given to new programing tastes of farm audi- ences. He added that one of the rea- sons more sponsors weren't using farm radio was that too many station sales- men and reps didn't take the trouble to learn a sponsor's farm problems, and how they could be helped by the use of radio. The St. Louis agencyman also gave a tip on timebuying. Accord- ing to Smith, he has found that TV has made some dents in the city and near- city audiences of some big regional sta- tions, and that several of these stations are aiming more and more shows at the relatively TV-free farmers. Result: more choice time slots are being opened for farm programs on many big radio outlets. Add them up together — the national outlook, the comments of Sam Schnei- ( Please turn to page 79) 227 stations with programing for farmers Some 1,100 stations air farm programs, but these 127 outlets have f I directors who are IARFD r specialty of farm « WSVA Harrisonburg, Va.

An advertising agency radio and TV executive, experienced in such matters, listed for sponsor these key reasons why: 1. Feeling the campaign has such a lofty moral purpose, the sponsors use dry-as-dust programs utterly devoid of entertainment value. Consequently, the show, which must compete with other programs, simply is not listened to. 2. In an effort to skimp overly on money, the sponsors fail to use the services of an advertising agency. Con- sequently, the show is high in amateur- ish ineptitude, low in professional pro- duction values. 3. Though depending so much on voluntary services (of writers, enter- tainers, station operators), the spon- sors don't attempt to get the partici- pants sufficiently enthusiastic about the cause. Therefore, the sponsors find SPONSOR School Luis promoted campaign Professional ad advice, entertaining TV puppets, \\ >1 documentaries put over school tax temperaments exploding, co-operation at an impasse, the commercial pitch forced and insincere. 4. The sponsors short-sightedly fail to follow through their radio and TV plugs with store displays, merchandis- ing cards, and promotional hoopla. As a result, their air campaign loses con- siderable impact. Then just exactly how should civic- minded businessmen go about selling a cause successfully? As a typical case history, SPONSOR has selected the out- standing example of a community air campaign staged in Dayton, Ohio. Thanks largely to radio and TV, a community group there was able to convince Daytonians to vote in (two to one) a $12,000,000 bond issue for a school building program, and to au- thorize a 5.4 mills tax levy to operate the streamlined schools. This miracle of persuasion was achieved in an off- year election and in the face of in- creased federal taxes. The case history is especially note- worthy, because it reveals what a dif- ference a professional touch can make. In the Dayton radio and TV campaign, the sponsors employed a top-notch ad- vertising agency, professional talent, and skilled ad agency promoters with plenty of merchandising know-how. This broadcast advertising success story began about mid-year in 1951. One day, Dayton's Board of Education approached the influential Community Relations Department of the National Cash Register Company. Its problem: the tremendous growth in the city's school system. It was pointed out that Dayton schools were already pitifully over- crowded. During the next five years, enrollment would jump another 15,000 pupils — practically a 40% increase. Therefore, the minimum need called for one new high school, three new ele- mentary schools, and the addition of 182 new rooms to existing school buildings. According to the Board of Educa- tion, only two things would solve the dilemma. One was a $12,000,000 school bond issue (the cost requiring an average tax levy of 1.3 mills for 25 years), which would require approval by 55% or more of citizens' votes cast on the 6th of November. The other was a 5.4 mills tax levy for a period of five years (replacing the 1.5 mill levy expiring in 1951), which would require approval by a majority of the votes cast. The difficulty was, though, that the Board had to overcome a considerable public apathy. People without children were especially loath to sanction will- ingly a boost in their taxes. Other citi- zens were still old-fashioned enough to feel, \"The little red school house was good enough for me; it should be good enough for the kids today.\" In fairly short order, a Call-to-Prog- ress Committee was set up composed of prominent, civic-minded Dayton lead- ers. General Chairman was S. C. Al- lyn, president of National Cash Regis- ter Company. Other members includ- ed such advertising-conscious business- men as David L. Rike, president of Dayton's Rike-Humber department store; and K. C. Long, president of Dayton Power and Light Company, to mention only a few. The Committee then turned over planning and execution of the cam- paign to Hugo Wagenseil & Associates, one of Dayton's top advertising agen- cies. Because of the number of agency personnel involved and their time costs, Wagenseil worked on a business, rather than a philanthropic basis. Key agency personnel who pitched into the campaign were Lincoln Scheurle, di- rector of Wagenseil's radio and TV division; John Leonard, production supervisor of radio and TV activities; George Brenard, who helped produce the radio announcements; and Marga- ret Leonard, a freelancer, who co-wrote scripts with Scheurle. The agency decided that (with little (Please turn to page 67) MERCHANDISING air campaign was achie> membership in \"Kenny and Joe Clubs\" in schools (top); posters kids took home to parents (middle); and display cards youngsters held up at traffic crossings near over-crowded schools (bottom) Why project succeeded 1. Professionalism: Advertising- conscious sponsors hired ad agency, Hugo Wagenseil & Associates, professional talent 2. Co-operation: Sponsors engen- dered participants with enthusiasm for cause, shared payment with the broadcasters 3. Life approach: Sponsors drew listeners by using entertaining shows, dra- matized cause with documentary commercials 4. Promotion: School teachers, mer- chants, newspapers, school kids were all urged to help sell cause as personal crusade 5. Merchandising: TV personalities made public appearances; car cards, pos- ters, kid clubs, window displays were used.

Within two to HI weeks after you read this, the FCC freeze will lijt and appli- cants will begin their trek toward getting neii stations on the air. Like the pioneers of old. many will drop out along the wayside. In the process, de- lay uill pile on confusion, leaving ad- vertisers agape at the post-freeze com- plexities. This report is designed to provide advertisers with some guideposts tli rough the wild and woolly post-freeze country. It presents the best available ansivers to 12 key questions which ex- ecutives in advertising agencies and sponsor firms around the nation are asking todu\\ . Interest in lifting of the freeze is jieak because so many vital decisions hinge on what happens — how fast — in the period immediately after. The me- dia breakdown of ad budgets for hun- dreds of firms hang in the balance. As one topnotch timebuyer at a ma- jor agency in New York told sponsor, \"Anyone who thinks the freeze isn't the hottest issue for advertisers right now is crazy.\" Importance of freeze lifting for ad- vertisers centers around two factors: (1) the number of major markets which are as yet uncovered by TV; (2) the number of major markets which are as yet inadequately covered because they have only one TV station. For a rundown on markets among the top 100 ivhich have no TV, see the table immediately below.

(The area still not covered by TV represents about 40% of the nation's population.) To get perspective on how important it is that the freeze be lifted in one- station markets consider these facts: I 1 I There are 40 one-station markets in all. I 2) Of these. 35 are among the top 100 markets in retail sales, based on J. Walter Thompson figures. (3) Among the one-station markets of the nation, two are in the top 10 in retail sales [Pittsburgh and St. Louis) ; six are in the second 10; three are in the third 10; five are in the fourth 10 — which should give you an idea of the importance of the one-station markets. Q. When will the freeze actually lift? A. Even FCC's top brass don't know for sure. They had hope to issue their freeze-lifting edict by 1 February, but it looks now as if it could take them till the end of March to complete all the paper work. A top FCC official ex- plained: \"If you had foot-high stacks of documents half an inch thick piled on your desk, which you were required by law to read and understand, how long would it take you to get finished? You wouldn't be able to answer defi- nitely and neither can I.\" He referred to the \"written testimony\" submitted by members of the industry covering the FCC's proposed system of station allocations. The FCC's final freeze- lifting edict must answer each such document. sponsor's estimate of the most like- ly edict date is 15 March, but just when it actually comes is academic be- cause the announcement will merely represent the beginning of a long proc- ess to follow before new stations can get on the air. Q. When will new stations get on the air? A. Some optimists believe that there is a chance for new stations opening up in major markets like Denver, Port- land, and Worcester during 1952. They reason that the FCC itself is so anxious to see progress made and TV enthusiasm is so strong that the com- plex hurdles can be leaped in unbeliev- ably short time.

But the very enthusi- asm for television which has fostered its growing in the past will probably help slow down construction of new stations this year. This enthusiasm, most observers believe, will lead so many to apply for licenses in each im- portant market that the hearings over who gets the stations will delay new station construction. FCC brass believe grants will go un- contested in only a few markets. They feel that every market which has a rich profit potential will draw more appli- cants than there are channels, particu- larly now that almost 100r^ of the ex- isting TV stations have gotten into the black ahead of schedule. The attitude of one key FCCer to- ward how many stations can get on the air in 1952 was: \"sponsor's guess is as good as mine.\" sponsor's guess: one dozen new stations oil by 1 Jan- uarj L953, practically all of them in -mall markets.

Jusl as RCA foughl the FCC col- or decision through to the Supreme 34 Court, some organization which object- ed to the FCC's final decision on how to allocate post-freeze channels could for six months or more, delay the entire procedure in the courts DuMont, for example, believes that the FCC-proposed allocations favor TV domination by NBC and CBS and that the FCC's coverage of the nation is based on geography rather than pop- ulation. If the FCC's edict does not modify the proposed allocations suffi- ciently to satisfy DuMont, the net- work's top men might well reason that the delay and anguish of going to the courts is their only alternative to liv- ing with allocations they don't like. Unless there is a court case, the freeze-lifting edict will be followed by a probable 60-day period during which applications for licenses may be sub- mitted. There have been 473 applica- tions to date and many more are ex- pected to pile in right after the freeze- lifting edict. Applicants have been holding off because they do not wish to tip their hands to rivals, and be- cause the FCC has indicated no pri- ority will be given to those who submit applications before the freeze lifting. Some 447 of the 473 applications sub- mitted thus far are for the 449 VHF channels available under FCC's pro- posed allocations. Only 26 applications are for UHF channels, but an increased flow of UHF applications is expected. Just how the FCC will take up the applications is not certain. The Com- munications Bar Association, made up of lawyers who practice before the FCC, has recommended UHF and VHF applications be considered together in cities which have both types of allo- cation. This would tend to speed the process. Best-qualified applicants, pre- sumably, would get the preferred VHF licenses. Others would have to go up- stairs to UHF. If UHF and VHF applications are considered separately, UHF licenses will be more easily come by because few will apply. But VHF applications will tend to log-jam. UHF could become more popular rapidly once applicants realize that taking UHF is their only alternative because of the limited number of UHF channels available. NBC recently urged that the FCC raise the limit on the number of stations a network or other entity can own to seven from five — with the additional stations to be UHF. This move puts NBC squarely behind UHF, should stimulate inter- est in it. For those few markets where there is no competition for channels, the first construction permits will probably be granted by mid-June, assuming that the date of the freeze edict is 15 March. C.P.'s for markets where hearings are necessary may not be granted for months thereafter. Estimates of the to- tal number of c.p.'s possible during 1952 have ranged from 25 to 80.

Despite its 100-yeai ancestry, il was onl) a little over three years ago that Griesedieck Western began taking to air advertising in earnest. Before that, it had restricted itself pretty well to newspapers, point-of-sale merchandis- 36 ing, and billboards. Nowadays, trade observers estimate it spends roughly $500,000 a year on radio and TV. The rest of its advertising appropria- tions devotes an estimated $400,000 for billboards, $200,000 for newspa- pers and merchandising. SPONSOR estimates about $250,000 of its air budget goes for news and wrestling shows, plus announcements, on KSD-TV, St. Louis; wrestling pro- graming on WMCT, Memphis; half- hour of Alan Funt's Candid Camera on KOTV. Tulsa; announcements on WKY-TV, Oklahoma City. Its radio appropriation, totalling about $250,000, is spread out over 33 stations in nine states. Using one-min- ute announcements and station breaks as frequently as five times a week, its messages are heard over these radio outlets, according to Rorabaugh Re- port on Spot Radio: In Arkansas.

There are three key reasons why the brewery has expanded so daringly into the air medium: 1. It pays off in sales. Company surveys have proved that wherever broadcast advertising was used con- sistently, sales of Stag Beer have defi- nitely increased. 2. It's vital in punching home the brand name, as Stag Beer has expand- ed its market distribution. Up until four years ago, Stag's distribution was Eairlj well confined to Missouri and Illinois. Since then, it has extended its market to 12 states, from Chicago to the Gulf. 3.

As sponsor pointed out in its survey of 40 brewery sponsors (\"Beer on the air,\" 23 April, 1951) brewers have increased their advertis- ing per barrel from $1.07 in 1949 to $1.09 in 1950. Thanks in part to its radio and TV advertising, Stag has sustained its role as No. 11 seller in the national field; No. 1 seller of bot- tle and draught beer in the tough St. Louis market (home of four major brewers) ; and No. 1 bottled beer in the States of Illinois and Missouri. Stag's policy has been one of creep- ing expansion. And wherever its dis- tribution has been heavy, its formula has been to blanket the area with radio messages. Largely, it has worked its way west, south, and east from St. Louis, keeping out of far eastern cen- ters like New York and Pittsburgh. In the last 18 months, it has entered Chi- cago for the first time. And to show how keenly competitive the field is, Chicago alone sells 70 to 90 beers. Other figures in the trade would question the modest use of the word \"creeping\" in reference to Stag's growth. John Flynn, business manager of American Brewer, told SPONSOR: \"Griesedieck Western Brewery is one of the most alive and aggressive of the regional brewers. The way it's been expanding south and west, I'd esti- mate it'll soon be distributing Stag Beer in 30 states.\" Certainly, Griesedieck Western's sales potential is in a sound state. Ac- cording to Modern Brewery Age, it sold 1,442,000 barrels in 1950 (each barrel containing 31 gallons of beer). Trade observers estimate this amounts to a yearly gross of about $40,000,000- plus. True, this output is well behind barrel sales of the Big Four Brewers — Schlitz, 5,096,000 barrels; Anheuser- Busch, 4,875,000; Ballantine, 4,374,- 000; and Pabst, 4,300,000. Still, it's hot on the heels of the output of Griese- dieck Western's closest competitors — Blatz, in ninth place with 1,740,000 barrels, and Pfeiffer, a close tenth with 1,618,000. Griesedieck Western's story dates back to a century ago when a small establishment called Western Brewery set up shop in Belleville, 111. In 1912, it was taken over by Henry Louis Griesedieck, who'd brought over an original brewing formula with him from Germany in 1873. (Interesting- ly, St. Louis contains a number of Griesediecks. all related to old Henry Louis, all of whom operate competi- tive breweries. Edward J. Griesedieck, for example, heads Griesedieck Bros. Brewery, and Alvin Griesedieck pre- sides over Falstaff Brewery. All mem- bers of the Griesedieck clan stoutly in- sist their breweries are not connected in a corporate or financial way.) Western Griesedieck Brewery pros- pered, though not spectacularly, and managed to weather the gloomy Pro- hibition Era successfully. Then, in 1936, it began perfecting a brewery process to develop a very dry pilsener type beer. According to record Griesedieck Western was the first in the United States to advertise a 'dry' beer. There- fore, Stag has often been called the original dry beer. Sales of Stag Beer really started go- ing into high gear in 1943 (it was then selling about 375,000 barrels a year and was a poor fifth place in St. Louis). One reason certainly for its sudden spurt ahead was the dynamic, < Please turn to page 74) 14 JANUARY 1952 37 How four advertisers one-shots 1.

Today, one-shots are a growing trend. Once, the use of one-shot shows was confined to a few big national ad- vertisers like Elgin National Watch Company and Gillette Safety Razor, who made advertising careers out of spending $100,000 or more for star- studded holiday-season shows, or sports events. Currently, one-shots are likely to be bankrolled by sponsors whom few admen would ever imagine connected with this type of airselling and at costs as low as $4,000.

This big sports event cost Moto- rola, for time, talent and promotion, an eye-opening $200,000 — perhaps more. However, even the glamour shows are not all in this blue-chip bracket any more.

Aware of the general trend and growing diversity of one-shot usage, sponsor, in recent weeks, interviewed several leading network and agency executives, clients and station officials. What, sponsor asked them, was behind it all? Typical of the answers received was this comment, from the vice president in charge of radio sales for one of the two leading networks. He summed up the situation this way for a sponsor editor : \"There have always been big one- shot sponsored shows in broadcasting. But, in the old days we didn't do much to encourage them. Because, with the exception of some 'extravaganza' holi- day shows and top sports events throughout the year, we weren't in a position to accept the business. \"The headaches of clearing the time, when virtually all of our radio time was sold on the network, was enough to make us freeze up at the mention of 'one-shot.' With the competitive media picture today, we've thrown overboard this type of thinking. \"Not only are we glad to have one- shot business today in radio, and to some extent in TV, we do everything we can to encourage it. This is true of all of the networks as well. Any of the radio networks today will be glad to sell you a one-time shot on any of their sustaining shows on a tailor-made network, and will do all they can to help promote and merchandise it. In fact, the networks are even custom- making vehicles that are ideally suited for 'one-shotting.' \"At the same time, lots of our clients and prospects have overhauled their thinking about year-'round or Septem- ber-through-June air advertising being the only effective way to sell. If you want to hand the major credit to some- one, I guess it would be to the Ford Motor Company. You'll remember that in the fall of 1949, when they couldn't clear enough announcement time for a spot campaign to launch their new auto models, Ford bought a saturation campaign in network radio, using one- shots. I think 14 different programs in 13 weeks were used on one network alone. \"Well, the results for Ford were so good, according to J. Walter Thomp- son, that we woke up to find that a new radio technique in one-shotting was here. So did a lot of other clients and the major networks. Since then, there have been several successful imi- tations of the Ford formula for every- one from General Mills to the mail-or- der book outfits. \"The single one-shot effort is com- ing into its own, too, for a lot of ad- vertisers who never used radio or TV before, or who used it sparingly. They're finding out that one-shots can be designed for all kinds of holiday or selling occasions. They've discovered that networks are more than willing to insure success with promotional back- stopping. You can tell your sponsor readers that one-shot shows are strict- ly here to stay.\" The network official's thoughts on one-shots, sponsor soon discovered, were echoed, with variations, by nearly every broadcaster involved with them. Networks and stations are indeed glad to accept them, provided the advertiser doesn't conflict productwise with ad- jacent sponsored shows. Here are oth- er symptoms of the growing one-shot trend : • Programs. As pointed out above, all of the major radio networks have the welcome mat out for advertisers who want to buy as little as a one-time use of a sustainer. (Some have even drawn up a special rate card for one- time, bi-weekly, and once-a-month sponsorships.) ABC has geared is va- rious \"Pyramid Plan\" shows for the pocketbooks of advertisers who want to buy one big effort, or an occasional promotion. A wide choice of all types of shows are available. NBC has a half-hour portion of The Big Show and the Wednesday night Barry Craig who- dunit series set aside for one-shotting; CBS built its Red Skelton radio series from the ground up, complete with a new merchandising setup (see \"The network merchandising era is here\" in 17 December 1951 sponsor) to make it work. These are in addition to long lists of sustaining shows. Mutual, al- though it has not created special vehi- cles for one-shotting, contemplates do- ing so, has a long list of \"product au- dience\" sustainers suitable for one-time use. • Costs. There is a far wider range of price tags on one-shots today than there used to be, at the national, re- gional and local level. The big, fancy one-shots still cost a lot.
