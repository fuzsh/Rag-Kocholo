March 15, 2022, marks a historic date for the Eiffel Tower, which has always played its part in major innovations in radio and television. The Eiffel Tower will grow to a height of 330 meters (1,083 feet) with the installation of a 6 meters radio antenna by TDF in preparation for DAB+ digital radio broadcasting.

Watch the spectacular operation to install the device by helicopter, carried out at 11am on March 15, 2022. Technicians attached the DAB+ antenna above the existing antennas at a dizzying height of 324 meters (1,063 feet)!

Improving digital radio coverage in Île-de-France

This new antenna will improve the quality of digital radio coverage for Paris and the Île-de-France region. The device joins the dozens of other antennas that allow TDF to broadcast nearly 30 DTT channels and 32 radio stations to 12 million people in Île-de-France within a radius of nearly 50 miles from the Eiffel Tower.

DAB+, for Digital Audio Broadcasting, is digital terrestrial radio. It is the radio version of DTT, Digital Terrestrial Television. DAB+ allows 13 radios to be broadcast on the same frequency, unlike on the FM band, where each radio has its own frequency. In addition, listeners enjoy excellent sound quality thanks to a strong signal captured with a dedicated DAB+ receiver.
