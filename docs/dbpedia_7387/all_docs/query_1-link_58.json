        "text": "The United States Virgin Islands (USVI) may be a small territory, but we are hugely proud of the athletes that represent us in the Olympic Games. While the Jamaican Bobsled team may have put the Caribbean on the map for the Winter Olympics, many of the Caribbean islands send delegates to both the Summer and Winter Olympics – and the USVI is no exception. You’ll find many sleepy faces at work here on St. Croix during the weeks of the Olympics as residents stay up late each night watching the Games and cheering for the Team USVI and Team USA.\n\nThe USVI got their start in the Olympic Games when the Virgin Islands Olympic Committee was formed in 1967, and recognized by the International Olympic Committee the same year. As you can imagine given the Caribbean climate here, the majority of the USVI athletes compete in the Summer Olympics in events like Athletics (Track and Field), Swimming, Sailing and Yachting. A few Summer Olympians from the USVI have also competed in Boxing, Weightlifting, Shooting, Wrestling, Fencing, Equestrian, Tea Kwon Do, and Cycling over the years. Since the team was started 1968, the USVI have competed in almost every Summer Olympics, the only exception being 1980 when the USVI took part in the boycott of the Moscow Games. You may be surprised to learn that the USVI have also participated in seven of the Olympic Winter Games since 1988. Athletes from the USVI have competed in Luge, Bobsled and Skiing at the various Winter Games. In fact, Seba Johnson, the first African American woman Olympic skier, and Dinah Suzy Browne, the first African American Women’s Luge athlete, both represented the USVI in Winter Olympics.\n\nFor those watching or reading about the Olympic Games you can find the USVI Olympic Team stats and scores listed under “ISV”. Why ISV? According to the Virgin Islands Olympic Committee, it is a matter of the Olympic languages. The modern Olympic Games were founded by a Frenchman names Pierre de Coubertin, and French and English are the two official languages of the Olympics. Each country participating in the Olympic Games is given a three letter country code for their team. For most countries, it’s the first three letters of the country’s name, and while many country’s names are very similar in English and French, there are some that are very different. For example Spain in French is Espagne, so their team’s country code is ESP. The Virgin Islands in French are called Iles Vierges, and that’s where the ISV country code is derived.\n\nIn addition to the Summer and Winter Olympic Games, the USVI also sends delegations to the Youth Olympics (where we have one gold medal won by Ian Barrow in 2010), as well as the Pan Am Games and the Central American and Caribbean Games. While the USVI Olympic Team has only brought home one medal thus far in our history at the Games (a silver medal in Sailing at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul by Peter Holmberg), we are nonetheless proud and supportive of ALL the athletes that compete for our territory. To learn more about the USVI Olympic athletes and the history of the USVI in the Olympic Games, you can visit the Virgin Islands Olympic Committee website at www.virginislandsolympics.org.\n\nHere is a list of the athletes that have competed in the Olympic Games representing the USVI, including the sport in which they competed:\n\n2022 Beijing Winter Olympics\n\nKatie Tannenbaum – Skeleton\n\n2020 (2021) Tokoyo Summer Olympics\n\nEddie Lovett – Athletics (Track & field)\n\nNatalia “Nati” Kuipers – Swimming\n\nAdriel Sanes – Swimming\n\nNicholas D’Amour – Archery\n\n2016 Rio Summer Olympics\n\nLaverne Jones – Athletics (Track & field)\n\nMuhammad Halim – Athletics (Track & field)\n\nEddie Lovett – Athletics (Track & field)\n\nCaylee Watson – Swimming\n\nRex Tullius – Swimming\n\nClayton Laurent Jr. – Boxing\n\nCy Thompson – Laser Class Sailing\n\n2012 London Summer Olympics\n\nTabarie Henry – Athletics (Track & field)\n\nMuhammad Halim – Athletics (Track & field)\n\nAllison Peter – Athletics (Track & field)\n\nLaverne Jones-Ferrette – Athletics (Track & field)\n\nCy Thompson – Laser Class Sailing\n\nMimi Roller – Laser Class Sailing\n\nBranden Whitehurst – Swimming\n\n2006 Torino Winter Olympics\n\nJulianne Abernathy – Women’s Luge\n\n2004 Athens Summer Olympics\n\nLaverne Jones – Athletics (Track & Field)\n\nAdrian Durant – Athletics (Track & Field)\n\nTimothy Pitts – Sailing\n\nGeorge Gleason – Swimming\n\nJoshua Laban – Swimming\n\nChris Rice – Shooting\n\nSasha Gumbs – Youth Camp\n\nMuhammad Abiff – Youth Camp\n\n2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics\n\nTroy Billington – Bobsled\n\nZachery Zoller – Bobsled\n\nQuinn T.
