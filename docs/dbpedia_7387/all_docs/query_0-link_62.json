        "text": "The head of the organising committee for the London Olympics in 2012 has said the Tokyo Games scheduled for this summer look “unlikely” to go ahead.\n\nAs the Guardian reports, Sir Keith Mills told the BBC he “would be making plans for cancellation” if he were in charge of this year’s Olympics, postponed from 2020 over the coronavirus pandemic that has shown little sign of dissipating as a slow vaccine rollout begins.\n\nJapan is currently under a state of emergency prompted by a surge in Covid-19 cases, just six months before thousands of athletes are set to converge for the Olympiad.\n\nA significant number of competitors have yet to qualify for Tokyo 2020, including the likes of Irish Laser sailor Ewan McMahon, Rio rep Finn Lynch as well as Liam Glynn all vying for one fo the last Tokyo berths along with Ireland’s two 49er campaign duos.\n\nDespite the present situation, World Athletics president Sebastian Coe said he was confident the Games will go ahead “but they will look different”.\n\nLast week a spokesperson for the Tokyo organising committee insisted there had been no discussion about a cancellation or extended delay.\n\nThe committee’s head Yoshiro Mori said postponing the Games a second time would be “absolutely impossible”.\n\nThe Guardian has more on the story HERE.\n\nTokyo 2021 Olympic Sailing\n\nOlympic Sailing features a variety of craft, from dinghies and keelboats to windsurfing boards. The programme at Tokyo 2020 will include two events for both men and women, three for men only, two for women only and one for mixed crews:\n\nEvent Programme\n\nRS:X - Windsurfer (Men/Women)\n\nLaser - One Person Dinghy (Men)\n\nLaser Radial - One Person Dinghy (Women)\n\nFinn - One Person Dinghy (Heavyweight) (Men)\n\n470 - Two Person Dinghy (Men/Women)\n\n49er - Skiff (Men)\n\n49er FX - Skiff (Women)\n\nNacra 17 Foiling - Mixed Multihull\n\nThe mixed Nacra 17 Foiling - Mixed Multihull and women-only 49er FX - Skiff, events were first staged at Rio 2016.\n\nEach event consists of a series of races. Points in each race are awarded according to position: the winner gets one point, the second-placed finisher scores two, and so on. The final race is called the medal race, for which points are doubled. Following the medal race, the individual or crew with the fewest total points is declared the winner.\n\nDuring races, boats navigate a course shaped like an enormous triangle, heading for the finish line after they contend with the wind from all three directions. They must pass marker buoys a certain number of times and in a predetermined order.\n\nSailing competitions at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo are scheduled to take place from 27 July to 6 August at the Enoshima Yacht Harbour.\n\nVenues: Enoshima Yacht Harbor\n\nNo. of events: 10\n\nDates: 27 July – 6 August"
