        "text": "When the 2012 Summer Olympics air on NBC in just a few short days, you will probably seen some pretty close finishes, with just a few hundredths of a second separating the winner from the rest of the pack.\n\nThanks to NBC Learn and the National Science Foundation, the science behind the summer Olympics is explained.\n\nAt the games in London, timed events will be measured to one one-thousandth of a second or one millisecond and that requires a high-tech timekeeping system built with cameras, lasers, computers and accurate clocks.\n\n\"The accuracy of today's timing circuitry is a thousandth of a second. So it's one hundred times more accurate than a stopwatch,\" said Linda Milor of the Georgia Institute of Technology.\n\nTo make timekeeping more accurate and precise, engineers use technology to remove the possibility of error.\n\nIn track events, an electronic pistol starts the race and speakers behind the starting blocks allow each runner to hear the gun at the same time.\n\nIf a runner applies pressure to a sensor in under 100 milliseconds, faster than any human can react, the system signals a 'false start' and the race is stopped.\n\nAt the finish line runners interrupt a laser beam and their time is recorded with a high-tech camera that takes more than 2,000 digital images per second.\n\n\"So these cameras allow us to get an image and show the result much more quickly than we used to in the past,\" said Milor.\n\nAt the finish of a swimming race, athletes will stop their own timer by touching pressure-sensitive pads that cover the end of each lane.\n\nHigh definition video cameras above and below the water also record the finish taking 100 pictures per second from different angles for judges to examine in a close contest."
