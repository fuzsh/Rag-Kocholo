        "text": "Prohibited Items at the Olympics\n\nPhoto: Stephen Shepherd | Photolibrary | Getty Images\n\nWith an estimated price tag of $14.46 billion,the London Olympics has presented costly logistical and infrastructure challenges and has created the biggest peacetime security operation in the country’s history, costing an estimated $877 million.\n\nThe British military has taken high-profile measures, from deploying over 17,000 soldiers inside and outside of London during the games to placing surface-to-air missile batteriesatop residential buildings.\n\nWith so much emphasis on security, entering Olympic venues may make spectators feel like they are going through a check point at an airport. Just as airport security restricts certain items, the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games has listed a range of things that are prohibited or restricted.\n\nRestricted items — those that “may disrupt competition, obstruct the view of other spectators or create a safety hazard” — may be confiscated.\n\nThe committee suggests that spectators bring as little with them as possible, but in most cases spectators are allowed to bring one medium, soft-sided bag into venues that can fit underneath a seat or on a lap. The more a spectator brings, the longer it will take to pass through security.\n\nSo what are some of the prohibited and restricted items in 2012 Olympic venues? Although most of the items — weapons, alcohol, drugs, fireworks, liquids, spray paint and pets — are obvious, but some may surprise you. Click ahead for some of the most interesting examples.\n\nFor full Olympic safety and security information, click here.\n\nBy Paul Toscano & Morgan Giordano\n\nPosted 25 July 2012\n\nPersonal Wireless Access Points and 3G Hubs\n\nPhoto: Matthew Lloyd | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nPrivate mobile WiFi hotspots, which allow wireless devices to connect to the Internet, are restricted. Although use of tablets and smartphones is allowed in the venues, these devices cannot be used as wireless access points. Because London’s wireless system is likely to be strained during major events, speculation about this ban has focused on an attempt to reduce overall bandwidth use.\n\nFlags of Non-Participating Countries\n\nPhoto: Oren Ziv | AFP | Getty Images\n\nFlags of non-participating countries are also restricted. Some 204 National Olympic Committees are represented, including 196 independent countries.\n\nSome participants, such as the Cook Islands and Puerto Rico, are territories of larger countries but compete under their own flags. Non-participating flags are allowed if they are “under the umbrella of a participating country,” such as the flag of England or Wales, which are under the umbrella of Britain.\n\nAlthough most countries are participating, a few notable ones stand out, such as South Sudan (flag pictured), which declared independence from Sudan in July 2011 but has yet to form an Olympic committee.\n\nThis has forced marathon runner Guor Marialto compete as an independent rather than under the Sudanese flag. Another country not participating is the disputed territory of Western Sahara. Taiwan will compete under “Chinese Taipei,” which has a flag created specifically for the Olympics.\n\nOversized Hats\n\nPhoto: Rainer Martini | LOOK | Getty Images\n\nJust over a year ago, big hats were all the craze in London, during the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton. The Olympics, however, have restricted “oversized hats,” which are likely to obstruct the view of other spectators.\n\nAccording to the committee’s guidelines, Olympic staff can help spectators determine what constitutes an “oversized hat.” If your headgear is determined to be too large, it will be permanently confiscated.\n\nNoisemakers\n\nPhoto: Martin Bernetti | AFP Creative | Getty Images\n\nOne of the most memorable items from the 2010 FIFA World Cup was the vuvuzela — a plastic horn that lent the South Africa event a characteristic “buzz.”\n\nDuring the London games, noisemakers, including vuvuzelas, air horns, hunting horns, klaxons, drums and whistles are restricted. Wembley Stadium is also prohibiting football rattles, trumpets, clappers and other musical instruments.\n\nAlthough noise can be a nuisance, light devices, such as strobes and laser pointers, are completely prohibitedsince their use have the potential to directly influence the competition.\n\n‘Ambush Marketing’ Materials\n\nPhoto: Frederic J. Brown | AFP | Getty Images\n\nAlso restricted are “any objects or clothing bearing political statements or overt commercial identification intended for ambush marketing.”\n\nAmbush marketing is a strategy where companies place their branding in the midst of a public, sponsored event without paying a sponsorship fee, seeking to create an association with that event without authorization. Although ambush marketing can take many forms, the restriction seeks to remove any unauthorized companies from associating their brand with the Games.\n\nPictured: Beijing's notorious counterfeit-goods shopping mall, the Silk Street Market, promotes itself with a version of Beijing's 2008 Olympics slogan of \"One World, One Dream\", 19 July 2007, turning it into \"One Dream, One Shopping Paradise\". The popular market is known for its fake goods with foreign brand names and is an example of Ambush marketing during the 2008 Summer Games.\n\nBicycles and Skateboards\n\nPhoto: Alan Copson | Britian on View | Getty Images\n\nAlthough the athletes on the playing surface may be sporting them, that doesn’t mean spectators should feel free to bring bicycles, folding bikes, roller-skates or skateboards into venues. They’re too large to fit under a seat or on a lap, and would certainly be a nuisance to others.\n\nBiking is popular in London, so an announced ban on non-folding bicycles on trains during the Olympics was lifted after only 36 hours.\n\nWalkie-Talkies, Phone Jammers and Radio Scanners\n\nPhoto: Altrendo Images | Altrendo | Getty Images\n\nIf you’re looking to communicate with your friends wirelessly during the Olympics, stay away from walkie-talkies. They’re banned. Phone jammers, which disable mobile phones from connecting to base stations, and a ban on radio scanners are likely the result of terrorism concerns since they could be used to intercept communications of security personnel.\n\nLarge Golf-Style Umbrellas\n\nPhoto: Alan Copson | Photographer's Choice | Getty Images\n\nReports of poor weather for the Olympics have been dampening spirits, but viewers will be even more depressed when they have no way of protecting themselves from the rain. Commonly used by spectators at golf tournaments, these oversized umbrellas could disrupt views of others. Instead pull on a pair of “wellies” and pack a slicker.\n\nBalls, Rackets, Frisbees or Other Projectiles\n\nPhoto: Glow Images | Getty Images\n\nImagine you are a beach volleyball player and it is the final set, and you have a chance to make it to the podium when a Frisbee floats by. Distracted, you miss the last block, and the game is over.\n\nThe Olympic committee wants to prevent this scenario, or worse, from happening. Anything that can be thrown, shot or launched at the athletic event cannot be taken in by a spectator. It is up to the discretion of the security guards to determine what is a “projectile.”\n\nExcessive Amounts of Food\n\nPhoto: JupiterImages | FoodPix | Getty Images\n\nAnyone who has ever been to the movies, a professional sporting event, play or concert knows it’s cheaper to eat before going and the Olympics are no exception.\n\nAt the Games, a 300 ml bottle of Heneken lager is £4.20 ($6.50), and a plate of curry and rice is £8.50 ($13.15). Bottles of water can be purchased for £1.60 ($2.50).\n\nThese high prices will likely encourage people to bring their own food, but the amount will be restricted by the Olympics, who want their partners, like Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and Cadbury, to profit."
