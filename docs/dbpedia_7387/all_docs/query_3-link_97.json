You ain’t got nothin’ on Kobe Bryant, Lithuania! (Except, maybe, [suicide rates. ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania#Health))\n\nPerformance time! The ceremonies are starting, with Scottish singer Emili Sande, who’s a little “pitchy, dawg,” according to someone at my Good-bye Olympics party. (Randy Jackson is here.) On the bright side, it’s the first time I understand what a Scottish person is saying without using my “warbled nonsense” abacus.\n\nThe day is immediately saved with the one-two punch of Chorus Singing the Beatles and Stomp, which, as a mother of three [motions toward three empty Chobani containers], I can assure you I loved. I mean, really, the only thing that could top this is finding out that Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber has a younger brother who is a gifted cellist WHAT IS HAPPENING:\n\nThat’s Julian Lloyd Webber, who decided against putting a Phantom mask on his cello just to drive the point home that he comes from a family of mutant musical geniuses. Fun fact: He plays a Barjansky Stradivarius cello from 1690, making it the oldest thing at the closing ceremonies after I.O.C. president Jacques Rogge.This serious beginning is offset by the appearance of the only ginger in a Nazi uniform I’ve ever been attracted to, Prince Harry himself, who shows up at the ceremonies representing the Queen. Which makes you wonder how many other royals they approached before settling on Harry.\n\nI just got some International Delights Coffee Creamer on the blue dress I’m wearing, and I have no regrets, America. #thongsnap\n\nThe Pet Shop Boys come out singing “West End Girls,” while some dudes in CB2 masks cycle them around the track. It works. The only issue with the performance is that girls under the age of 14 are doing their best Yawny Kitaen impressions because, seriously, “Who are these people?” —Disinterested Seinfeld. **\n\nThen someone had the good sense to put British boy-band sensation One Direction on a truck and send the thing barreling into the stadium at a solid 55 miles per hour. For a second, I was actually worried that the only “direction” these boys would be headed in tonight would be under a back tire.\n\nLuckily for us and the future of your already ruined daughters, the boys live! And that Harry Styles, I gotta tell you, even though he is roughly the size and weight of a Bratz doll, there is something about him that makes me want to put the guy in my God-given pocket. (He’s 18 according to Google, making that joke more than O.K. Even appropriate.)\n\nThis fun ode to Brit pop (including a nod to my fave, Blur, which was busy closing down Hyde Park last night) ends with the largest combined Stomp cast performance ever. (The horde conveniently made its sweet broomy music while simultaneously helpfully cleaning up a bit before the athletes arrived.)\n\nWas it really necessary to label him? Like, if you don’t know who George Michael is without seeing his name plastered here, and you aren’t at either end of the Benjamin Button age curve, you have no excuse.\n\n“Freedom 90” sounded incredible. The only thing the performance was missing was some real-life supermodels, preferably breaking out from beneath gigantic billboard images of themselves. Now that I think about it, what would an English Olympic closing ceremony be without some sort of nod to famous models???\n\nCollective Phew!! They’re here. The models are here!\n\nKate Moss looked stunning as always, in a floor-length gown covered in gold sequins and cheekbones covered in one millimeter of skin. On the bright side, she did have to pass a drug test before the I.O.C. would even consider including her. The test required her to locate and score some coke in 10 minutes or less. (And not just any coke. The good shit.) Kate was able to run crosstown, pick it up, and grasp the underbelly of a London cab Cape Fear–style back to the testing facility with two minutes to spare. (Self-congrats for making the first Kate Moss/drug test joke on the Internet in this recap.)\n\nJoining Moss were Naomi Campbell, Lily Cole, Lily Donaldson, Karen Elson, Jourdan Dunn, David Gandy, and Georgia May Jagger, who all strutted up the runway clad in British-designed fashions. Watching this all through kid-in-a-candy-store eyes was Official 2012 Olympic Heartthrob Nathan Adrian, who had the best chance of anyone to score with one of these ladies:\n\nUntil his internal dork kicked in and he realized he wasn’t cut out for models. That’s when he made this face:\n\nI love this kid, with or without his dead-on Robert De Niro impression.\n\nNext, Annie Lennox rolls in on some sort of Renaissance pirate ship surrounded by Goth Mozarts. Even the guys in lightbulb hats were like, “I have no idea.”\n\nBritish singer Ed Sheeran momentarily halted the planet on its axis when his blue laser-beam eyes bore holes into our collective cerebral cortexes:\n\nSheeran performed a relaxing cover of Pink Floyd’s “Wish You Were Here,” and as though anything could distract from the azure orbs floating in this man’s skull, a man walked a tightrope above the stadium while the entire audience all stood in line for the bathroom at the same time. For a split second I thought it was maybe the Queen herself looking to top the Bond stunt. But no, it’s just an ordinary man. With superhuman balancing skills. Spoiler alert: He lived.\n\nRussell Brand rode in on a giant bus singing “Pure Imagination” from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which then turned into a cocknified version of “I Am the Walrus,” with Russell pointing to the camera a lot while hundreds of Katy Perry lookalikes danced around him.\n\nThen Fatboy Slim showed up, and somewhere in 1999, a younger version of myself got full-spine chills. But back in 2012, the actual version of myself couldn’t wrap my mind around his appearance. I mean, he just basically stood inside a giant inflatable octopus, mouthing the words to the music while turning a knob slightly to the right. Seems like a job more suitable for opening-ceremonies star Sir Tim Berners-Lee, wouldn’t you agree? (The world may have forgotten about you already TBL, but I haven’t.)\n\nThanks to Jessie J, I now know that my dream of wearing Speedskating Spanx out in public can indeed become a reality. Joining her onstage were British rapper Tinie Tempah and Taio Cruz. But they were largely drowned out by Jesse’s performance of an alleycat mating ritual.\n\nBut why are we all here, really? Two words: SPICE GIRLS.\n\nBecause she was only two when these songs were on the radio. Conversely, you know who was having the time of his life?\n\nMayor of London Boris Johnson, a man elected to the position based solely on how much he resembles British comedian Matt Lucas. Boris is maybe the biggest star to emerge from these Games, as he embodies that rare politician who is at once effective but also doesn’t take himself too seriously. You know how I know that? Because two of his daughters are named Cassia Peaches and Lara Lettice. That’s how.\n\nMeanwhile, the Spice Girls sped off on the roofs of their cars going even faster than One Direction, so fast that Victoria Beckham appears to be actually going back in time and getting younger. (Or at least slightly less angry.)\n\nTonight’s journey through the best karaoke songs of all time continued hitting it out of the Koreatown park with Oasis’s Liam Gallagher singing “Wonderwall” with a hilarious fake band named Beady Eye. Though perhaps a more appropriately titled band would have been Crusty-Cornered Mouth.\n\nThough, if you closed your eyes, you could have sworn he was singing the song out of a single beady nostril with a single kazoo shoved into it. This didn’t stop the crowd from singing along to Wonderwall’s power chorus, including American runner and virgin Lolo Jones, whose own Wonderwall still remains fully intact.\n\nOne of my favorite bands ever, ELO, got the closing-ceremonies treatment, with “Mr. Blue Sky” playing over some steam-punk-ish old-timey bicycle antics. Moments later, Monty Python legend Eric Idle wasn’tshot out of a canon, and instead pleased the masses with “Always Look on the Bright Side of Life,” replete with dancing gladiators and a bleeped curse word. The half-million or so Indians who call London home got a little xenophobic nod with a fun, slightly mocking Bhangra dance segment. A segment which should have been about three minutes longer, but guys, then Jessie J wouldn’t be able to sing a fourth song! Sorry, India!!!\n\nThe world has never been the same since the loss of Freddie Mercury and his facial hair. His presence was re-created last night over big screens throughout the stadium playing a portion of Mercury’s 1986 performance at Wembley Stadium. Queen guitarist Brian May, who was there then and still rocks, shows every other musical act tonight what a legend is made of. Jessie J wasn’t quite done making sure your housepets suffer, so she accompanied him on “We Will Rock You.”\n\nThe Games aren’t even officially over yet, and we’re already talking about Rio in 2016. Guys, we need a breather. This is like when you get in your gay friend’s car and Mariah Carey’s Christmas album is playing . . . in June. (Only my friends? Fine.) We need a breather. A break. Forty winks. The ol’ Ambien Tango.\n\nThe Rio portion starts off with what looks like a lovely janitor just takin’ a li’l dance break onstage. Within moments, an uptight (white) security guard rushes to the stage to take care of the situation. This seems . . . through clenched teeth a little r-cist. Right? Am I too uptight? Should I Moveon.org? Understood.\n\nA lot of weird stuff goes down in this preview. A woman in an umbrella skirt. Giant men whose heads are made out of the Aggro Crag trophy from Nickelodeon’s *Guts.*Victoria Secret Angel Alessandra Ambrosio\n\nBased on the statistics of this preview alone, I will likely recognize one out of every 1,500 performers at Rio’s opening ceremonies.\n\nThe 2012 London Summer Olympic Games ended with English boy band Take That serenading the viewers while the very artsy English torch lowered down and self-extinguished. I, like many of you, was shocked that Robbie Williams, Take That member and the only person in the group I care about, was not there. The only possible explanation I could think of was that his hotness would have made it physically impossible to put that torch out. Or that his wife is giving birth. Whichever.\n\nThe torches are lowered, while a somber tune on a single horn fills the air. And then that’s it. The Games . . . they’re over. It’s so quiet. I can hear everything. The rattle of my air conditioner. The single blueberry left in my fridge, rolling around against the edge of an empty Chobani container like a penny going into a wishing well. All we have left are ourselves. And each other.\n\nFalse alarm, Costas is back, debuting a brand-new post-Olympic personality:\n\nKasual Kostas tells us that this is the very last time a man named Bucky Gunts will be directing the Olympics for NBC. Which is why I’d like to dedicate this recap to Bucky Gunts. Bucky, you gunting deserve it.\n\nThanks for sticking around with us for the Games! If you want to check in on my post-Olympic well-being, you can see if I’ve tweeted in the last 24 hours or just come around in person. If no one answers the door, I’m either dead or at Costco. Bye, guys!\n\nREAD Day Four: U.S. Gymnasts Win Gold, Phelps Breaks Medal Record, but the Parents Steal the Show"
