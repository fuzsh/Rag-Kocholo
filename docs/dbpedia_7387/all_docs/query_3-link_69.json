        "text": "Spectators will get their first taste of sport in the new 2012 Olympic venues this summer at test events including beach volleyball at Horse Guards Parade and basketball in the Olympic Park, London organisers have revealed.\n\nA comprehensive 12-month testing programme will cover 42 events across 26 venues and involving 8,000 athletes from more than 50 countries. Not all of the events will be open to the public, depending on the emphasis of the tests.\n\nA total of 150,000 tickets costing between £5 and £35 will be on sale across several events, though others such as the London–Surrey Cycle Classic to test the road race route will be free.\n\nTickets for the equestrian test events at Greenwich Park will be given away to local residents. Altogether, a total of 250,000 spectators are expected to see events in the so-called \"London Prepares Series\".\n\n\"This is a dress rehearsal for us but the public, of course, will see the rehearsal not the dress. It will look and feel quite different,\" London 2012's chief executive, Paul Deighton, said. \"We don't expect to get everything absolutely right. If we did I wouldn't be happy because we wouldn't be stress-testing things properly. We will learn from our mistakes and make changes.\"\n\nThe series takes in events organised and ticketed by the London Organising Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Games (Locog), such as the mountain biking at Hadleigh Farm for which there will be 5,000 tickets available in July, and others, such as the Badminton World Championships at Wembley Arena in August, that it will not organise but will help to staff and operate.\n\nThe test events are grouped into three \"clusters\". The first, in July and August this year, predominantly take place at venues away from the Park. The exceptions are the BMX and basketball events on the Olympic Park, for which spectators will be bussed in to what will still be a construction site.\n\nLocog will build reduced versions of the temporary grandstands that will be used for the Games at the showjumping arena in Greenwich Park and the beach volleyball venue at Horse Guards Parade.\n\nThe second cluster of events, from November to January next year, will include events at the aquatics centre and the velodrome, while the third cluster in April and May 2012 will test the rest of the Olympic Park venues including the athletics stadium.\n\nDeighton said the events would be used to test technology, security, ticketing, crowd flows and logistical considerations surrounding the individual sports themselves. Modern pentathlon, for example, has recently switched to laser shooting in place of the traditional air rifles and will need to be rigorously tested in situ at Greenwich Park.\n\nDeighton and Locog's head of sport, Debbie Jevans, said lessons had been learned about the staging of events from Beijing and about city-wide logistics from the Vancouver Winter Games.\n\nIn Vancouver in 2010, organisers came under fire for the Own the Podium programme that attempted to maximise home advantage by restricting access to rival teams.\n\nAsked whether London organisers risked going the other way by inviting top-class athletes to compete in Games-time conditions at new 2012 venues, Jevans said: \"We have worked closely with the BOA but also with international federations to allow them access. We have to be open but we also have to get ready to deliver these Games.\"\n\nDeighton also confirmed that those who did not get all the tickets they applied for in the first phase of applications, which closed on 26 April, would be offered the chance to buy other tickets in July. Those who didn't apply in the first phase won't be able to do so until late this year.Tickets for the test events will be sold through Ticketmaster from 26 May.\n\nThe four ticketed London 2012 test events this summer are\n\nMountain bike 31 July, Hadleigh Farm, Essex\n\nBeach volleyball 9-14 August, Horse Guards Parade\n\nBasketball 16-21 August, Basketball Arena, Olympic Park\n\nBMX 19-20 August, BMX Track, Olympic Park\n\nOther London 2012 venue ticketed events include\n\nGymnastics (artistic, rhythmic and trampoline) 10-18 January 2012, North Greenwich Arena\n\nCycling (track) 17-19 February 2012, Velodrome, Olympic Park\n\nAquatics (diving) 20-26 February 2012, Aquatics Centre, Olympic Park\n\nAquatics (synchronised swimming) 18-22 April 2012, Aquatics Centre, Olympic Park\n\nHockey 2-6 May 2012, Hockey Centre, Olympic Park\n\nWheelchair tennis 2-6 May 2012, Eton Manor, Olympic Park\n\nWater polo 3-6 May 2012, Aquatics Centre, Olympic Park\n\nAthletics 4-7 May 2012, Olympic Stadium\n\nParalympic athletics 8 May 2012, Olympic Stadium\n\nTicketing arrangements for these events will be announced later this year"
