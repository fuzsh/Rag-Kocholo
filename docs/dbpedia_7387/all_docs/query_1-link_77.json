        "text": "This past month, the Whistler Museum opened a temporary exhibit on the Sea to Sky volunteers of the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The exhibit will run through March as Whistler continues to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Paralympic Games. One of the groups included in this exhibit is a group that formed well before the Games ever came to Whistler.\n\nThe Weasel Workers formed in the 1970s when Bob Parsons bad his crew of six prepped the course for the first World Cup Downhill races in Whistler. Most of the early volunteers were parents of Whistler Mountain Ski Club members, but membership grew over the years as Weasels continued to work on the courses for large races on Whistler and began sending volunteers to help build courses for World Cups, World Championships, and Winter Olympics on other mountains. When the Games were awarded to Whistler and Vancouver in 2003, the Weasel Workers began recruiting and building their team well in advance of the alpine events held on Whistler Mountain.\n\nDuring the 2010 Games, the number of Weasel Workers swelled to about 1,500 volunteers. Volunteers came from across Canada and other nations to join a core group of 400 to 500 volunteers from Vancouver and the Sea to Sky area. About 300 volunteers worked specifically for the Paralympics, and a couple hundred Weasel Workers volunteered to work for both the Olympics and Paralympics. Weasel volunteers began their work for the Vancouver Organizing Committee (VANOC) on Whistler Mountain as early as mid-November 2008 and continued to clean the courses well after the Games had left town.\n\nEven during the Games, the Weasels continued to be a family affair. Bunny Hume, who began volunteering the with Weasels with her husband Dick in the early 1980s when their grandsons began ski racing, volunteered alongside multiple family members. She handed out and collected race bibs, her son Rick was the Chief of Course for the women’s course, and her grandsons Jeff and Scott worked on the dye crew. Rick’s wife Lynne also worked as a Weasel during the Paralympics.\n\nSome of the Weasel Workers who began volunteering as ski club parents even had children competing in the Games. Long-time Weasel Andrée Janyk, who could often be found working on a course with a smile, saw two of her children, Britt and Mike, race in the Olympics in their hometown.\n\nKarl Ricker, also a long-time dedicated Weasel Worker, was on the mountain trying to prevent people from crossing where the winch-cats were working when he received the news that Maëlle Ricker, his daughter, had won a gold medal in snowboard-cross on Cypress Mountain and become the first Canadian woman to claim an Olympic gold on home soil. He went down to Vancouver to attend her medal ceremony, but was back at work on the course early the next morning.\n\nDespite rain, wet snow, and warm weather over the first few days of the Games, and the postponement of three races, the Weasel Workers created and maintained courses for the men’s, women’s, and Paralympic alpine races that were seen around the world in 2010, and those who came to Whistler to work with the Weasels became just as much a part of the team as the long-time volunteers. Patrick Maloney, then the Weasel president, told The Whistler Question that, “Anybody that’s on that track is a Weasel Worker.” This sentiment was echoed by Weasel Worker Colin Pitt-Taylor, who claimed that, “as soon as you started working on an alpine course, you became a Weasel Worker, whether you like it or not.”\n\n1 year from today the seaside resort of Sochi Village will be a rocking celebration of winter sport on a scale the world has not seen since, well, n3 years ago, right here. Since we’re feeling the Olympic spirit we feel it’s apt to look back into Whistler’s Olympic past.\n\nThe initial bid for the 1968 Olympics that started this whole thing called Whistler is fairly well known, but fewer are aware that a total of 5 unsuccessful bids for the Olympics had already been made before the IOC finally announced on July 2nd 2003 that the joint Vancouver-Whistler 2010 bid had been chosen. All of these prior bids, despite their failure, played an integral role in the continued development of Whistler until it was finally ready to host the 2010 Games.\n\nThe 1976 was an especially strong bid, receiving endorsement from the Canadian Olympic Committee as our official national bid. By 1970, when the bid was being put forth, Whistler Mountain had become an established, high profile ski resort, and Vancouver was an increasingly cosmopolitan city with growing international appeal. One of the most important boosters of the West Coast, and Whistler in particular, was none other than then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau–a frequent visitor to Whistler who even took his honeymoon here with Margaret Sinclair in 1971.\n\nAlthough the 1976 games ended up in Innsbruck, Austria, the fact that a full IOC bid was made has left behind a lot of official material that gives insight into the Canadian Olympic organizers and their vision of Whistler as a future Olympic venue. The official 1976 Vancouver/Garibaldi bid book, printed in 1970 and on display in the Olympic section of our permanent exhibit is a perfect example of this.\n\nThe book is a very polished looking production, meant to showcase the bid and everything the Vancouver-Garibaldi region had to offer. A prominent selling point for this bid was the compact, single host area. All of the events would be held in what is today Whistler, they even advertised that all facilities would be within a 2.5 mile radius of where the village is today.\n\nProbably the coolest element from the bid book are the architectural drawings, which offers an alternate-universe version of Whistler Village from the one designed by Eldon Beck and constructed nearly a decade later. Notably, although there was still very little there at the time, and there were no plans to develop Blackcomb yet, the village was still located more or less where it is today.\n\nThe architecture is very grand, especially with all the elements considered as a whole. The buildings are angular, almost modular looking (the athlete’s village, not shown here, resembles very closely the Whiskey Jack neighbourhood in Nordic/Highlands).\n\nOverall, this Olympic Village would have had a more purpose-built feel than today’s actual village; you’d never be more than a stone’s throw from the ski-jumping arena, the the ice rink, or the biathlon course. Despite such differences, you can still see the influential role it played in leading to the Whistler we have today: the village location, elements of architectural design, perhaps more.\n\nWhether you prefer the designs or today’s village, and whether the reality would have actually matched these preliminary sketches, are matters for debate. Regardless, these drawings offer endless opportunity for pondering what could have been.\n\nAs the 2012 Olympics kicks off in London, we at the Museum have been reflecting on the last Olympic games. It feels so much longer than two and a half years ago that the games were here in Whistler. As I write, the torch relay is underway- the Olympic flame is on its way to London.\n\nThe actual transition of the Olympic flame is something that until now, I’d never given much thought to. As it turns out, the history of the Olympic flame and torch relay is pretty fascinating.\n\nThe origins of the flame are in ancient Greece, where the flame was lit to commemorate Prometheus’ theft of fire from Zeus. The flame was lit throughout the ancient Olympics, but the tradition was not reborn in the modern Olympic games until 1928 in Amsterdam.\n\nThe torch relay is more modern in its origins. The relay was devised as part of the Berlin Olympics in 1936 by a man named Carl Diem, and supervised by none other than infamous Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels. Since the controversial Berlin Olympics, the torch relay has been an important part of the build up to the games.\n\nThe relay begins in Olympia, Greece, where eleven women representing the Vestal Virgins, light a flame using a reflection of the sun’s rays by a parabolic mirror.\n\nThe Museum staff were debating how the torch could travel across the ocean, and whether it traveled by boat or plane. Apparently these days it’s pretty common to put the flame in a special container in order to take it on a plane, but for the Montreal 1976 Olympics, the flame was beamed by satellite. The flame from Greece was deflected, the signal was sent to Ottawa and the flame was lit by a laser. Talk about high tech!\n\nWhen the Olympic flame traveled across Canada, it had a number of interesting ways of being transported. When it was taken to Tofino, BC, it traveled via logging truck and canoe, where it was handed off to Raph Bruhwiler on a surfboard! When the flame traveled to Haida Gwaii, it traveled via a traditional Haida canoe carved by Bill Reid.\n\nWhile London isn’t literally taking up the torch from the Vancouver/Whistler Olympics, it feels like we’re passing off the Olympic spirit.It’s a great time to reflect on the Olympics and the celebratory, convivial atmosphere that the Games brought to Whistler.\n\nGood luck London and all the athletes competing in the 2012 summer Olympics!\n\nIf you’d like to see one of the 2010 Olympic Torches, drop by the Museum where we have one you can pose with!"
