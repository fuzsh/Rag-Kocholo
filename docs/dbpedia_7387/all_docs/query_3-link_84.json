        "text": "pentathlon, athletic contest entailing five distinct types of competition. In the ancient Greek Olympics, the pentathlon included a race the length of the stadium (about 183 meters [200 yards]), the long jump, the discus throw, the javelin throw, and a wrestling match between the two athletes who performed best in the previous four events. This Greek pentathlon was adapted for modern track-and-field competition by setting the sprint distance at 200 meters and by substituting a 1,500-meter run for the wrestling match. The event was included in the Olympic Games from 1912 through 1924.\n\nThe modern pentathlon, based on the skills (fencing, shooting, swimming, running, and horseback riding) needed by a battlefield courier, was first included in the Olympic Games of 1912, and it was a team event from 1952 to 1992. In 2000 it became a women’s event in the Olympics. Originally a five-day contest, the modern pentathlon was shortened to four days in 1984 and to one day in 1996. The fencing competition is a round-robin tournament comprising one-minute, one-touch épée duels. The freestyle swim covers 200 meters. Competitors draw unfamiliar horses for a show jumping competition on a 350- to 450-meter course with 12 obstacles. The final event combines the shooting and running disciplines: competitors alternate between three rounds of shooting (with either air or laser pistols, depending on the competition) at five targets within a 50-second time frame and three 1,000-meter cross-country runs. Competitors begin the combined shooting and running event in the order of their finish in the previous three events combined, and the first athlete to cross the finish line after the third 1,000-meter run is the pentathlon’s winner. The modern pentathlon is governed by the Union Internationale du Pentathlon Moderne et Biathlon.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nAmerican Sports Nicknames"
