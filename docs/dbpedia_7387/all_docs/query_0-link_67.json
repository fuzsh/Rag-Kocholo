        "text": "Lily Xu and her coach Jon Emmett relive the drama of the 4-way fight for three Olympic medals at the London 2012 Games. Jon even gets a bit emotional watching it all over again...\n\nSailjuice editor Andy Rice tried an experiment, which needs a bit of effort on your part as the viewer/ listener! But we think the interview and the insights from Olympic Champion Lily Xu and her coach Jon Emmett are worth making this work.\n\nThe reason, by the way, is because of copyright issues with Olympic TV footage. This is a variation on the theme of the Expert Analysis interviews that we've been doing with a number of Olympic stars, which you can find here.... EXPERT ANALYSIS RACE REVIEWS\n\nNice and straightforward because the video and audio are all in one place.\n\nHowever this time, we need you to play the YouTube video with the sound turned down, and then run the MP3 audio as a separate commentary alongside the YouTube video. Make sense so far? Hope so...\n\nJust follow these steps.\n\nSTEP 1: Open up the YouTube video in a separate tab in your internet browser, or even open a completely different browser, and start playing the video with the volume off\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyn-_yUaMZI&t=1364s\n\nSTEP 2: Play the MP3 audio commentary by pressing the button below...\n\nor you can download the audio here and play from your device....\n\nhttps://www.sailjuice.com/downloads/20200529\n\nSTEP 3: Make sure the audio is in sync with the YouTube video. To help you do this, we've added some time codes below...\n\nTIME CODES TO HELP YOU MATCH UP THE AUDIO WITH THE VIDEO\n\nMinutes 0 to 2 of the MP3 audio: Just some chit chat between Lily, Jon and Andy, setting the scene for that sunny summer's day in Weymouth back in 2012...\n\nSTART THE YOUTUBE VIDEO\n\nAt minute 00:45 of the YouTube video, make sure the audio is at 02:53, where I say 'need to be a little bit careful...' and the Course Diagram looks like this, with the arrow at the finish line...\n\nSTART TIME! THE BOATS CROSS THE START LINE\n\nAt minute 10:39 of the YouTube video, make sure the audio is at 11:19, at the exact moment the start gun fires...\n\nWINDWARD MARK #1: ANNALISE MURPHY (IRL) HOLDS A SLENDER LEAD\n\nAt minute 17:15 of the YouTube video, make sure the audio is at 19:14\n\nLEEWARD GATE ROUNDING, MARK #2: LILY XU (CHN) ROUNDS IN THE LEAD\n\nAt minute 21:01 of the YouTube video, make sure the audio is at 22:52\n\nWINDWARD MARK #2, MARK #3: LILY XU (CHN) ROUNDS IN THE LEAD\n\nAt minute 27:13 of the YouTube video, make sure the audio is at 29:08\n\nLEEWARD GATE ROUNDING, MARK #4: LILY XU (CHN) ROUNDS IN THE LEAD\n\nAt minute 30:38 of the YouTube video, make sure the audio is at 32:35\n\nWINDWARD MARK #3, MARK #5: LILY XU (CHN) ROUNDS IN THE LEAD\n\nAt minute 36:55 of the YouTube video, make sure the audio is at 38:46\n\nLet the audio and the video run together for the rest of the race all the way to the triumphant and emotional finish!!!"
