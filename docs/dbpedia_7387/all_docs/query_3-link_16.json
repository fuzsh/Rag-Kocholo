        "text": "At the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, breaking will make its debut while other sports will feature revised formats and disciplines. To keep you up to date, Olympics.com is bringing you everything you need to know about what’s new at Paris 2024.\n\nSo, it's time to get to know the new modern pentathlon competition format, present since Stockholm 1912, in Sweden. After more than a century at the Games, the sport has gone through several format changes and the next update will debut in France.\n\nParis 2024 | The Modern Pentathlon Olympic qualification system explained\n\nThe previous formats of the modern pentathlon\n\nModern pentathlon aims to define the complete athlete with skills in five disciplines – fencing, swimming, showjumping, shooting and running.\n\nOriginally competed across four, five or even six days, by Atlanta 1996 the Olympic competition was contested in just one. At London 2012, the running was then combined with laser shooting in order to give more drama to the contest and engage the fans. This whole sequence of competitions used to take many hours.\n\nThe tally of points accumulated in fencing, riding and swimming rank the athletes to decide starting positions for the last event – the laser run – with the top-ranked athlete setting off first. Consequently, the first to cross the finish line wins the gold medal.\n\nFor Paris 2024, the semifinal and final will be condensed into 90 minutes, in a reorganised order of disciplines, in front of fans in a single venue. But how?\n\nOlympics.com presents the new modern pentathlon format for the upcoming Olympic Games.\n\nThe new format for Modern Pentathlon at Paris 2024\n\nAt Paris 2024, 72 athletes – 36 men, 36 women – will take part in modern pentathlon. Eighteen finalists in each gender will emerge from the semifinals, which, along with the final, will be contested in a 90-minute format.\n\nThe modern pentathlon in Paris 2024 will be held between 8-11 August with the fencing ranking round taking place at the North Paris Arena on the first day.\n\nThe semifinals and finals will be hosted from days two to four, at the iconic Palace of Versailles, a venue that will accommodate all five disciplines of the sport within a defined spectator-friendly arena. Fans and broadcasters will now be able to follow all the action in one place within a shorter time period. Previously events were organised at different venues.\n\nThe order of the disciplines will also be new in the French capital and includes short rest intervals:\n\n35 minutes of equestrian (jumping)\n\n5 minutes break\n\n20 minutes of fencing (épee) - bonus round\n\n10 minutes break\n\n15 minutes of swimming (200m freestyle)\n\n15 minutes break\n\n20 minutes combined event (laser run)\n\nAthletes accumulate points in each event according to their performance. In the last event, laser run, athletes will start with a handicap time based on the conversion of the total points from the first three (3) events into time (1 point = 1 second). The first starts at time “0”, the next one at time 0 plus the number of seconds difference. The first athlete to cross the finish line in the laser run wins the gold medal.\n\nThe ranking round for male and female fencing, which defines the starting order of the athletes in the fencing bonus round, takes place on Thursday 8 August.\n\nThe men's semifinals take place the following day (Friday 9 August), with the women's semifinals the morning and afternoon of Saturday 10 August.\n\nThe men's final takes place between late afternoon and evening on the Saturday, while the women's decider concludes the competition on Sunday (11 August).\n\nWhat do the athletes think?\n\nThree-time Olympian and silver medallist at Rio 2016, Élodie Clouvel (FRA) spoke to Olympics.com about what she thinks about the changes in modern pentathlon for Paris 2024:\n\n\"In the beginning, of course, it was a little difficult because the fact of doing one test after another is physically difficult. We are leaving swimming, we are going to continue with the combined event, so you have to work on the arm for the throw, which is tired because of swimming. Before, we had time to recover.\n\n\"All these small adjustments we had to make in training as well. We have had very specific training, precisely for the sequences and in the end we got used to it. The [World Cup 2023 stages allowed] us to prepare well for the things to be highly efficient at the end of the season.\"\n\nClouvel’s compatriot, partner and six-time world champion, Valentin Belaud commented to the website of the International Union of Modern Pentathlon (UIPM): \"I have been a top-level athlete for about 15 years and I have seen the evolution in modern pentathlon. The first quality of a pentathlete is to be adaptable. That's what we've been doing for many years. This new version is, in my opinion, a great way to make pentathlon grow... today I'm 28 years old and this new version scares me too! Not for our sport that I love, but for my willingness to adapt. I need to overcome this fear and work to progress, continuously.\"\n\nBrazilian bronze medallist in London 2012, Yane Marques stated: \"It was a requirement and you have to adapt, even though I too have already experienced a transition. Before, it started with shooting and then they created the combined event. When I started it was lead shooting and then laser. It is a big change, yes, but the athletes who are looking for a place in Paris 2024 are already competing in this format. They will already be adapted.\"\n\nObjectives: Facilitate understanding and increase popularity\n\nThe changes in the format of modern pentathlon aim to increase the sport's popularity, by making it more dynamic, with a continuous flow – without long breaks – and easier to understand. Organised in just one venue over a shorter time period, the hope is that fans will feel closer to the action and broadcasting is optimised.\n\n\"Our new Modern Pentathlon format is strongly aligned with these two principles: it will dramatically improve the experience for fans and viewers, while maintaining the essence of the sport,\" said UIPM president, Klaus Schormann (GER) on the organisation’s website."
