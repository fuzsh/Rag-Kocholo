        "text": "TOKYO (AP) — The Latest on the Tokyo Olympics, which are taking place under heavy restrictions after a year’s delay because of the coronavirus pandemic:\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nFrance made sure its first Olympic volleyball medal would be gold, beating the Russians in five sets in a breakthrough win for a country that had no history of success.\n\nThe French had only qualified for the Olympics four times before this year and never made it past the quarterfinals. But they made it through the knockout stage to earn the gold despite being forced to a fifth set after blowing a 2-0 lead in the final.\n\nJean Patry rallied the French late in the fifth set with a kill and an ace to put them ahead 13-11. Antoine Brizard then surprised the Russians when he sent a soft shot over the net instead of setting it to give France match point and they won it 15-12 when Maxim Mikhaylov’s shot went wide.\n\nArgentina beat Brazil in five sets for the bronze medal.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nMalcom scored in the 108th minute and Brazil won its second consecutive gold medal in men’s soccer with a 2-1 victory over Spain.\n\nBrazil also won gold on home soil five years ago at the iconic Maracana Stadium. Neymar struck the winner in a 5-4 shootout after a 1-1 draw with Germany.\n\nBrazil had a 1-0 lead at the half, but Mikel Oyarzabal tied it for Spain in the 61st minute off a cross from Carlos Soler.\n\nThe Brazilians won a penalty kick in the 37th minute after a collision between Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon and Matheus Cunha. Richarlison, who led the field in Japan with five goals, took the penalty, which sailed well over the goal to keep the game scoreless.\n\nBrazil took the lead in first-half stoppage time when Davi Alves popped the ball high into the box to keep it in play and Cunha slotted it just inside the post.\n\nGil Bryan nearly scored in the 88th for Spain, but his shot hit the crossbar and the match went to extra time.\n\nSpain won the gold medal in 1992 and was also seeking its second Olympic title.\n\nBrazil advanced to the final 4-1 on a penalty shootout after a scoreless draw with Mexico in the semifinals while Spain got past host Japan 1-0 on Marco Asensio’s goal in the 115th minute.\n\nMexico downed Japan 3-1 in the bronze medal match in Saitama on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nFrance won the Olympic gold medal in men’s handball by beating Denmark 25-23 in the final.\n\nFrance led by six goals early in the second half before Denmark came back to make it a one-goal game in the final minute. Ludovic Fabregas managed a steal and empty-net goal with six seconds left to secure the victory.\n\nFrance was playing its fourth consecutive men’s Olympic final after winning in 2008 and 2012 and losing to Denmark in 2016. The French women’s team plays the Russian team for gold on Sunday.\n\nSpain beat Egypt 33-31 for the bronze medal.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nMariya Lasitskene won the Russian team’s first gold medal in track and field at the Tokyo Games.\n\nThe three-time women’s high jump world champion added an Olympic gold medal to her collection with a winning height of 2.04 meters.\n\nLasitskene moved into first place when she cleared 2.02 meters on her first jump. She had missed early attempts before clearing 1.96, 1.98 and 2 meters.\n\nNicola McDermott of Australia was leading until she missed her first attempt at 2.02. She cleared it on her next attempt for a national record but missed all three attempts at 2.04.\n\nYaroslava Mahuchikh of Ukraine finished with bronze after clearing 2 meters.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nA Japanese team of All-Stars fulfilled a determined national mission to win the Olympic baseball gold medal for the first time, beating the United States 2-0 behind Munetaka Murakami’s third-inning home run.\n\nMasato Morishita and four relievers combined on a six-hitter, and the Japanese men (5-0) matched the accomplishment of the women’s softball team, which upended the Americans for their second straight gold medal.\n\nSeveral hundred people who appeared to be Olympic volunteers cheered on Japan in a largely empty 34,000-capacity Yokohama Stadium, some wearing orange Japan jerseys and matching facemasks on the warm and humid night.\n\nAmerica, the nation that introduced baseball to Japan in 1872, finished 4-2. Teams were denied access to all 40-man roster players and many eligible top prospects by Major League Baseball and its clubs, hindering the U.S. and other countries whose top players are in MLB.\n\n___\n\nThere were no bad exchanges this time as the U.S. men won their first gold medal in a track race at the Tokyo Games with a victory in the 4x400-meter relay.\n\nThe U.S. men didn’t reach the final of the 4x100-meter relay, but the 4x400 team of Michael Cherry, Michael Norman, Bryce Deadmon and Rai Benjamin was never really in trouble as they completed four laps of the Olympic oval in 2 minutes, 55.70 seconds. It was a fifth gold for the U.S. men in the 4x400 since 1996.\n\nThe Netherlands took silver in a national record 2:57.18 and Botswana won bronze in 2:57.27.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nBritain’s Joseph Choong set an Olympic record to win the men’s pentathlon Saturday, matching the gold medal won by Britain’s Kate French in the women’s event.\n\nChoong finished third in the event’s swimming, first in fencing, 14th in riding and 15th in laser-run to set a new Olympic mark of 1,482 points.\n\nEgypt’s Ahmed Elgendy won silver and Woongtae Jun of South Korea won bronze.\n\nBritain is the first country to win the men’s and women’s individual modern pentathlon at the same Olympic Games.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nAllyson Felix has won her 11th Olympic medal, combining with her American teammates to finish the 4x400-meter relay in 3 minutes, 16.85 seconds for a runaway victory.\n\nThe team of Felix, Sydney McLaughlin, Dalilah Muhammad and Athing Mu was never in jeopardy in this one.\n\nPoland finished second, 3.68 seconds behind, and Jamaica finished third.\n\nFelix, who became the most-decorated woman in Olympic track history when she won bronze in the 400 on Friday night, now passes Carl Lewis with the most track medals of any U.S. athlete. Of the 11 medals, seven are gold.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nIran’s Sajad Ganjzadeh has won the Olympic gold medal in men’s over-75 kilogram karate after final opponent Tareg Hamedi was given a disqualification penalty for kicking Ganjzadeh hard in the upper body or head.\n\nGanjzadeh left the Budokan tatami on a stretcher after falling motionless onto his back from the spectacular kick by Hamedi, who led the bout 4:1. Ganjzadeh moved his arms before he was carried away.\n\nAfter the officials conferred, a hansoku penalty was issued to Hamedi and Ganjzadeh was declared the winner. Hamedi, who left the mat in tears, still won Saudi Arabia’s second-ever silver medal, but missed out on its first gold.\n\nHamedi’s amazing kick was the final strike of karate’s Olympic debut tournament. The sport is not on the program for Paris in 2024, and its long-term Olympic future is up in the air.\n\nHamedi overcame Japan’s Ryutaro Araga in the semifinals. Araga’s bronze surprisingly was the host nation’s only kumite medal in Tokyo. Karate proliferated in Japan and spread throughout the globe during the 20th century.\n\nUğur Aktaş of Turkey won the other bronze.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nJapan’s Yui Susaki defeated China’s Yanan Sun by technical superiority, 10-0, to win the women’s freestyle wrestling 50-kilogram final.\n\nSusaki, 22, added Olympic gold to her two world titles. It was Japan’s fourth Olympic gold in women’s wrestling out of six weight classes.\n\nSun had won an Olympic bronze medal at 48kg in 2016.\n\nAzerbaijan’s Mariya Stadnik won her fourth Olympic medal. She won her match for bronze by technical superiority, 10-0 over Mongolia’s Namuuntsetseg Tsogt Ochir. She previously had won two silvers and a bronze.\n\nAmerican Sarah Hildebrand defeated Ukraine’s Oksana Livach by technical superiority, 12-1, for the other bronze.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nNeeraj Chopra has won India’s first gold medal in Olympic track and field with a throw of 87.58 meters to clinch the javelin title at the Tokyo Games.\n\nIndia’s only previous medals in Olympic track and field were two silver medals won by Norman Pritchard in the 200-meters and the 200-meter hurdles at the Paris Games in 1900.\n\nChopra was the first athlete from India to win gold in javelin at the Asian Games and the Commonwealth Games and he has set a new benchmark in Tokyo. He held off athletes from the Czech Republic to finish atop the podium.\n\nJakub Vadlejch took silver and former world champion Vitezslav Vesely bronze.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nFeryal Abdelaziz of Egypt has won the first Olympic karate gold medal in women’s over-61 kilogram kumite, beating Azerbaijan’s Iryna Zaretska to win Egypt’s second Olympic gold medal since 1948.\n\nThe 22-year-old Abdelaziz went ahead on a yuko with 28 seconds left in a cagey final bout. She scored again three seconds later and hung on for a 2:0 victory celebrated with a primal scream.\n\nEgypt has been competing at the Olympics since 1912, but Greco-Roman wrestler Karem Gaber’s gold in Athens in 2004 was the nation’s only other gold in the past 73 years.\n\nGong Li of China and Sofya Berultseva of Kazakhstan won bronze.\n\nJapan’s Ayumi Uekusa was eliminated before the finals, ending a rough Olympic year for the karate champion. Uekusa spoke out earlier this year against Japanese karate official Masao Kagawa, saying he had bullied her and injured her with a bamboo sword. Kagawa resigned.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nSweden has defeated Jessica Springsteen and the U.S. jumping team in a jump off for the gold medal.\n\nSpringsteen and teammates Laura Kraut and McLain Ward each moved cleanly through the shortened jump-off course and did so with a combined time of 124.2 seconds.\n\nPeder Fredricson, the final Swedish rider, needed to circle the track in 40.30 seconds or better without error and cruised to a time of 39.01 for the country’s record fourth gold medal but first since 1924. The Americans also entered this week with three golds.\n\nFrance had a clear line to a second straight gold when its final rider, Penelope Leprevost, took the course. Needing to finish with fewer than five points to win without a jump off, Leprevost’s horse refused twice, disqualifying her and the rest of the French team.\n\nThat left the Americans and Swedes tied for the lead with eight penalties apiece, necessitating the jump off.\n\nSpringsteen, the daughter of rockers Bruce Springsteen and Patti Scialfia, gets a silver in her Olympic debut.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nJakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway surged ahead as he rounded the last curve and set an Olympic record to win the 1,500-meters at the Tokyo Games.\n\nIngebrigtsen ran behind world champion Timothy Cheruiyot for most of the race before kicking late to win the gold medal in 3 minutes, 28.32 seconds, beating the record of 3:31.65 set by Abel Kipsang of Kenya two days earlier in the heats.\n\nCheruiyot, who missed initial selection for the Olympics and was a late addition because another runner was cut from Kenya’s team, took silver in 3:29.01.\n\nJosh Kerr of Britain won bronze. Kipsang placed fourth.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nThe Russian Olympic Committee’s Abdulrashid Sadulaev defeated American Kyle Snyder 6-3 in the men’s freestyle 97-kilogram final.\n\nSnyder was the Olympic gold medalist at 97kg in 2016 and is a two-time world champion. Sadulaev was the Olympic gold medalist at 86kg in 2016 and is a four-time world champion.\n\nSadulaev led 6-0 in the final minute. Snyder scored two on a takedown and one on a step-out to make it 6-3 before Sadulaev held on.\n\nCuba’s Reineris Salas defeated Azerbaijan’s Sharif Sharifov for bronze. Salas, 34, had never won a world title or an Olympic medal. Sharifov, 32, won Olympic gold in the 84kg category at the 2012 London Olympics and earned bronze at 86kg in 2016.\n\nIn the other bronze medal match, Italy’s Abraham Canyedo Ruano defeated Turkey’s Suleyman Karadeniz 6-2.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nRussian Svetlana Romashina has won the seventh gold medal of her Olympic career, leading her team to gold in the artistic swimming team event.\n\nRomashina has won or been on the winning team of every single event she’s participated in at four Olympics.\n\nThe only other athletes who have won at least seven Olympic golds without ever claiming silver or bronze are Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt and American jumper Ray Ewry, who both won eighth golds in track and field.\n\nThe rest of the ROC team included: Vlada Chigireva, Aleksandra Patskevich, Marina Goliadkina, Svetlana Kolesnichenko, Alla Shishkina, Polina Komar and Maria Shurochkina.\n\nRomashina teamed with Kolesnichenko to win the duet on Wednesday.\n\nThe Russians were heavy favorites in a sport they have dominated for more than two decades. Their last Olympic loss in what was then known as synchronized swimming came at the 1996 Atlanta Games.\n\nPerforming to “Parade of Planets” by Denis Gornizov, with planet designs on their swimsuits, ROC was awarded 98.8000 points for the free routine and finished with a total of 196.0979 points after also leading the technical routine.\n\nChina finished 2.5669 points behind to take the silver medal and Ukraine was 5.7961 behind for bronze.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nSifan Hassan won the 10,000 meters for her second gold and third medal of the Tokyo Olympics after entering three long-distance races.\n\nHassan burst past world-record holder Letesenbet Gidey on the final turn and won in a time of 29 minutes, 55.32 seconds.\n\nIt completed an astonishing 5,000 and 10,000 double for the Ethiopian-born runner, who now competes for the Netherlands. She also won a bronze in the 1,500 meters. Her victory in the 10,000 was her sixth race in eight days in Tokyo.\n\nKalkidan Gezahegne of Bahrain took silver in 29:56.18 and Gidey, having led for most of the race, faded for the bronze as she had no answer to Hassan’s finish.\n\nFour runners didn’t finish race on another humid night at the Olympic Stadium.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nJapan’s Takuto Otoguro defeated Azerbaijan’s Haji Aliyev 5-4 to win the men’s freestyle wrestling 65-kilogram final.\n\nOtoguro’s best result had been a world title in 2018.\n\nAliyev was a 2016 Olympic bronze medalist at 57kg and a three-time world champion.\n\nBronze medalists were the Russian Olympic Committee’s Gadzhimurad Rashidov and India’s Bajrang Punia.\n\n___\n\nJessica Springsteen’s final ride at her first Olympics has put the American team in medal contention at the Equestrian Park.\n\nSpringsteen’s horse, Don Juan van de Donkhoeve, front-hoofed a rail for a four-point penalty but was otherwise lightning quick and clean around the course.\n\nSpringsteen’s ride followed a perfect circuit from Olympic veteran Laura Kraut for the Americans, and the U.S. entered the final round tied with Sweden and Belgium for second with four points. France leads with two.\n\nThe 29-year-old Springsteen -- daughter of rockers Bruce Springsteen and Patti Scialfa -- failed to qualify for the finals in the individual event earlier this week. She’s picked up four penalty points in each of her three runs spanning the individual and team competitions.\n\n___\n\nGerman world champion Jonathan Horne has left the Budokan tatami on a stretcher after getting hurt in his elimination-round kumite bout in men’s 75-kilogram Olympic karate.\n\nHorne withdrew from the Olympic tournament about 30 minutes later.\n\nHorne appeared to injure his arm during a sparring exchange with Georgia’s Gogita Arkania. The 32-year-old karateka collapsed to the mat in pain and was eventually taken away for medical attention.\n\nHorne was the world champion at 84 kilograms in 2018, and he won the European title at the same weight earlier this year. He was among the favorites in this lower division in the Olympic debut of karate, which concludes its three-day run Saturday night.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nIsrael’s Linoy Ashram won the gold medal in the rhythmic gymnastics individual competition, ending Russia’s decades-long dominance in the sport.\n\nAshram, 22, edged out a pair of Russian identical twin sisters who were the favorites heading into Tokyo. Dina Averina, 22, placed second and her sister, Arina, fell to fourth place. Alina Harnasko of Belarus won the bronze medal.\n\nRussia has swept the rhythmic gymnastics gold medals in every Olympics since 2000.\n\nBut Ashram’s victory Saturday, her country’s first ever in rhythmic gymnastics, breaks their streak. Her nearly flawless performance included a club routine set to Beyonce’s “Crazy in Love” and dancing with a ribbon to a techno remix of the Jewish folk song “Hava Nagila” while dressed in a blue and white feathered leotard.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nThe Danish team of Lasse Norman Hansen and Michael Morkov won the return of the men’s Madison to the Olympics for the first time since 2008.\n\nHansen and Morkov won just three of the 20 sprints but were consistent enough through the 200-lap race to finish with 43 points. That was three more than Britain, which earned silver on a tiebreaker, and France, which took the bronze.\n\nThe much-loved Madison, once a staple of track cycling, returned to the Olympics for the first time since the 2008 Beijing Games. In fact, three riders who took part in the last Madison were still around 13 years later for its return: Morkov of Denmark, Kenny de Ketele of Belgium and Germany’s Roger Kluge.\n\nThe race involves teams of two whipping each other around in a relay. One rider is considered in the race at a time, though they can switch at any juncture, and points are awarded to the top four finishers in each 10-lap segment.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nThe U.S. has won its third consecutive gold medal in women’s water polo, pounding Spain 14-5 in the final at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nMaddie Musselman scored three times and Ashleigh Johnson made 11 saves as the U.S. improved to 134-4 since it won gold at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games. After falling 10-9 to Hungary in group play in its first loss at the Olympics since the 2008 final, the U.S. ripped off four straight wins by a combined score of 63-26.\n\nThe U.S. joins the men’s teams from Britain (1908-1920) and Hungary (2000-2008) as the only countries to win at least three straight water polo titles at the Olympics. The U.S. is the only team to medal in each of the six editions of the women’s tournament at the Games.\n\nMaica Garcia had two goals for Spain, which also lost to the U.S. in the 2012 final. The silver medal matches the country’s best finish in the women’s competition.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nCao Yuan became the first diver to win gold medals in three different Olympic events with a thrilling duel off the 10-meter platform at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre.\n\nCao completed another dominating performance by the mighty Chinese team, which was nearly perfect at these games. Yang Jian took the silver, just 1.95 points behind his teammate in a scintillating capper.\n\nYang nailed his final dive, receiving a string of 9.0s and 9.5s for a forward 4 1/2 somersaults with a 4.1-degree of difficulty -- the hardest dive that anyone attempted.\n\nYang came up out of the water, pumping his fists.\n\nBut Cao was the final diver to go off the tower. While his dive wasn’t as difficult, his marks were even better -- two perfect 10s, every other score a 9.5. That was enough to give him the gold with 582.35 points, with Yang taking the silver with 580.40.\n\nBritain’s Tom Daley was the only diver who gave the Chinese a real challenge before finishing with 548.25 for the bronze. He now had four Olympics medals in his career -- one gold and three bronze.\n\nChina’s only slip-up in Tokyo came in the 10-meter synchronized, where Cao and Chen Aisen settled for silver behind Daley and Matty Lee by a mere 1.23 points. That miniscule margin was the only thing stopping a perfect run at the Tokyo pool by the world’s greatest diving nation..\n\nThe Chinese were 1-2 in all four individual events, to go along with three golds and a silver in synchronized.\n\nThe 26-year-old Cao added to the golds he won on the 3-meter springboard at the 2016 Rio Games and in 10-meter synchro at the 2012 London Olympics. He also became only the second man to win medals in all four Olympic diving events after Russia’s Dmitry Sautin.\n\nAmericans Jordan Windle and Brandon Loschiavo finished ninth and 11th, respectively.\n\n___\n\nA German coach has been suspended after she was filmed hitting an uncooperative horse during the Olympic women’s modern pentathlon competition.\n\nTV footage showed Kim Raisner leaning over a fence to strike the horse Saint Boy, which refused to jump the fences in the showjumping round. That cost German athlete Annika Schleu a chance at winning the gold medal.\n\nThe International Modern Pentathlon Union says it reviewed footage showing Raisner “appearing to strike the horse ... with her fist” and that “her actions were deemed to be in violation of (the rules).”\n\nRaisner’s suspension only applies for the rest of the Tokyo Olympics, which end Sunday. It wasn’t immediately clear if she had been supposed to have any role in Saturday’s men’s competition in modern pentathlon.\n\n___\n\nArgentina won its second Olympic medal ever in men’s volleyball, rallying to beat in five sets in the bronze medal game on Saturday.\n\nThe only other medal the Argentinians won in the sport came in Seoul in 1988 when they also beat Brazil for the bronze.\n\nThe Russians play France for the gold medal.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nBusenaz Sürmeneli of Turkey has won the women’s welterweight gold medal in Tokyo, persevering through a difficult final against China’s Gu Hong to win Turkey’s first-ever boxing gold.\n\nSürmeneli won the final 3:0 with two even scorecards after a bout filled with holding and awkward exchanges. They were caused almost completely by Gu, whose awkward, hold-heavy style confounded opponents on her way to silver. Gu was docked a point early in the second round for holding, but would have won the fight on two judges’ scorecards without the deduction.\n\nSürmeneli battered Gu late in the second round with the power and athleticism that made her arguably the most impressive fighter in the 100-woman Tokyo field. Turkey had won only two silvers and two bronzes in gold in its Olympic history before Sürmeneli’s run to the first Olympic title at women’s welterweight, one of two women’s divisions added to the Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nOshae Jones of the United States and Lovlina Borgohain of India won bronze. Jones is one of four medalists for the most successful U.S. boxing team since 2000, while Borgohain is the third boxing medalist in India’s Olympic history.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nBrazil’s Hebert Sousa won the men’s middleweight boxing gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics in shocking fashion when his bout with Ukraine’s Oleksandr Khyzhniak was stopped by a third-round knockdown.\n\nThe top-seeded Khyzhniak thoroughly dominated Sousa for the first two rounds and appeared to be cruising to Ukraine’s fifth-ever boxing gold. But Sousa caught Khyzhniak with a counter left hook during an exchange in the third, and Khyzhniak went to the canvas hard.\n\nThe referee waved off the bout while Khyzhniak got up begged to continue, adding another instance to a series of Tokyo stoppages that would be considered far too early in professional bouts.\n\nSousa, who beat second-seeded Gleb Bakshi of Russia in the semifinal, joins lightweight Robson Conceição as the only boxing gold medalists in Brazil’s Olympic history. Conceição won his historic gold at home in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nBakshi and Eumir Marcial of the Philippines won bronze medals in likely the most talent-stacked division in Tokyo.\n\n___\n\nHungary has earned the country’s first medal in women’s water polo, beating the Russian team 11-9 for bronze at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nVanda Valyi scored three times for Hungary, which finished fourth in each of the last three Games. Rita Kesthelyi had two goals.\n\nHungary was clinging to a 10-9 lead in the final seconds when Alda Magyari stopped a long shot by the Russian Olympic Committee’s Nadezhda Glyzina. Magyari then threw the ball into the open net for the clinching goal.\n\nHungary beat the U.S. in group play, handing the Americans their first loss at the Olympics since the 2008 final. It outlasted the Netherlands in the quarterfinals before losing to Spain.\n\nSpain plays the U.S. for gold later Saturday.\n\nHungary’s men’s team — the winningest country in the the Olympics’ oldest team sport with nine gold medals — also plays for bronze Sunday against Spain.\n\nGlyzina, Anastasia Simanovich and Ekaterina Prokofyeva each scored two goals for the Russian team, which won bronze in 2016. Anna Karnaukh made six saves.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nThe International Olympic Committee has closed a potential disciplinary case against two Chinese gold medalists who wore pin badges of Mao Zedong on the Olympic podium.\n\nInternational Olympic Committee spokesman Christian Klaue says Chinese team officials gave assurances the athletes were warned and the incident will not be repeated.\n\nAt the medal ceremony Monday for the women’s track cycling sprint, Bao Shanju and Zhong Tianshi wore pin badges of Mao, the founding leader of communist China.\n\nThe gesture tested the limits of Olympic Charter Rule 50, which prohibits political statements on the podium at the Tokyo Games. The rule will also apply at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nStoyka Krasteva of Bulgaria has capped her impressive run through the Tokyo Olympics with the women’s flyweight boxing gold medal. She beat top-seeded Buse Naz Cakiroglu of Turkey 5:0.\n\nThe 36-year-old Krasteva, a 2012 Olympian who returned to boxing in 2019 after a break, dominated her final four opponents to win Bulgaria’s fifth-ever boxing gold and its first since Daniel Petrov in 1996. Bulgaria had won just one bronze in boxing since 2004.\n\nCakiroglu lost the final decisively, but still won Turkey’s third-ever silver medal in boxing and sixth medal overall. Teammate Busenaz Surmeneli has another shot at Turkey’s first boxing gold in the welterweight final later Saturday.\n\nHuang Hsiao-wen of Taiwan, the 2019 world champion, and Tsukimi Namiki of Japan won bronze in the lightest women’s weight class.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nGalal Yafai has won Britain’s first boxing gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics, beating Carlo Paalam of the Philippines 4:1 in the flyweight final.\n\nYafai, the 28-year-old younger brother of two professional boxers from Birmingham, is a two-time Olympian who had an impressive run in Tokyo. He finished by knocking down Paalam in the first round of the gold medal bout and going on for a comfortable win.\n\nBritain’s powerhouse team has won two silvers and two bronzes to go with Yafai’s gold in Tokyo. Middleweight Lauren Price fights Sunday for another gold.\n\nPaalam fell just short of winning the first Olympic boxing gold medal in the history of the Philippines after knocking off defending gold medalist Shakhoibidin Zoirov on his way to the final.

Instead, he and Tocs finish fourth -- just as the Latvian women did a day earlier.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nPeres Jepchirchir led a 1-2 Kenyan finish in the women’s marathon, withstanding the heat and humidity while running through the streets of Sapporo.\n\nJepchirchir finished in a time of 2 hours, 27 minutes, 20 seconds in a race moved up an hour to avoid the heat.
