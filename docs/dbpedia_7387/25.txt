Sailing was introduced during the 1900 Summer Olympics, although it was scheduled to appear at the 1896 Summer Olympics, before being canceled due to bad weather. Due to sailing having had open classes, women have been competing since the introduction in 1900.

Although the distance has been changed repeatedly during the previous editions of the Olympic Games, the disciplines are based on boatclasses.
