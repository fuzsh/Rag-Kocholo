        "text": "[LIMA] Peru's former president Alberto Fujimori remained in intensive care in a Lima hospital on Monday, a day after he was granted a pardon for his 25-year sentence for crimes against humanity.\n\nCurrent president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski ordered the pardon on Sunday on humanitarian grounds for Mr Fujimori and seven other prisoners.\n\nHe said the decision relied on a medical evaluation that Mr Fujimori suffered a progressive and incurable illness and that conditions in prison \"represent a grave risk to his life\".\n\nBut the move came after Mr Fujimori's son Kenji drained votes away from a parliamentary bid Thursday to impeach Mr Kuczynski on suspicion of corruption, sparking speculation the pardon was political payback.\n\nThe pardon generated protests, more of which were expected on Monday.\n\nThe condition of Alberto Fujimori, 79, was \"delicate\" and \"a decision will be made\" based on how he responds to treatment at the Centenario Clinic, a doctor at the facility, Alejandro Aguinaga, told reporters.\n\nHe said there was no prospect of Mr Fujimori leaving soon.\n\nMr Fujimori was transferred from his cell to a clinic Saturday suffering from low blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat.\n\n\"He remains in intensive care. His condition is favorable but other tests are necessary,\" Mr Aguinaga said.\n\nHe said the ex-president had already undergone scans of his brain and heart, and stated that the cardiac problem was accentuating \"various degenerative pathologies.\"\n\nKenji Fujimori, who is a lawmaker, posted an online video of his father in intensive care.\n\nAlberto Fujimori has been hospitalised on several previous occasions, the last time in September, and has had heart, back and stomach trouble as well as several operations to remove cancerous growths from his tongue.\n\nThe former leader has spent more than a decade imprisoned for ruthlessly cracking down on political rivals and for ordering dozens of murders and overseeing other brutal tactics.\n\nDespite his conviction for human rights abuses, however, Mr Fujimori retains a level of popularity in Peru for having defeated leftwing guerillas and for stabilising the economy after a period of crisis.\n\nThose duelling feelings for the former president have come to the fore with the pardon.\n\nDozens of supporters gathered in front of the hospital looking after him, while later Monday groups of opponents were to hold demonstrations against him.\n\nMr Fujimori, of Japanese descent, ruled Peru between 1990 and 2000. His reign quickly became autocratic after a 1992 internal coup in which he dissolved the legislature.\n\nThe pardon was Mr Kuczynski's first major act after surviving the impeachment bid that was spearheaded by Kenji Fujimori's sister, Keiko, who is also a legislator and who narrowly lost the last presidential election.\n\nMr Kuczynski, a former Wall Street Banker, was accused of lying to cover up US$5 million in payments received from disgraced Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht.\n\nHe faces a struggle to influence Peru's opposition-dominated Congress, where his party has just 18 seats.\n\nAFP"
