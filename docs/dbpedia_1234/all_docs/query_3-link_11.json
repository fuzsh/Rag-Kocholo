        "text": "The highest court ratified the sentence of a previous one that left the sentence of four years and six months pending ratification by the court that gave its final ruling on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, it applied a legislative decree approved a few months ago that raised from four to five the number of sentence years, within which judges can order the prison sentence to be suspended and replaced by a kind of probation.\n\nThe Public Prosecutorâ€™s Office requested that Kenji Fujimori and his co-defendants serve six years and six months as the charges were fully proven, according to the accusation.\n\nThe prosecutor pointed out that Kenji Fujimori offered congresspersons of the pro-Fujimori party, led by his older sister Keiko, public works and perks in exchange for not voting for the impeachment of then neoliberal President Padro Pablo Kuczynski.\n\nef/omr/ro/mrs"
