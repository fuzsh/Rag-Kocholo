        "text": "The Peruvian political party loyal to former President Alberto Fujimori is expelling the ex-strongman's son as a rift widens between his two children over last month's botched attempt to oust Peru's current president.\n\nKenji Fujimori led a group of rebellious lawmakers from the Popular Will party who blocked a push to remove President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski last month. Two days later the scandal-tainted Kuczynski pardoned Alberto Fujimori in what many see as a closed-door political deal.\n\nKenji Fujimori obtained the most votes of any lawmaker in 2016 congressional elections, but he has taken a back seat to his older sister, Keiko Fujimori, who narrowly lost the presidency to Kuczynski.\n\nAlberto Fujimori was released from a 25-year sentence for graft and human rights abuses committed during his 1990-2000 rule."
