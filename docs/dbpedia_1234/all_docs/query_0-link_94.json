        "text": "Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has pardoned former leader Alberto Fujimori on health grounds in a move that has prompted angry protests.\n\nFujimori, 79, who is serving 25 years for human rights abuses and corruption, was moved from prison to hospital because of health problems on Saturday.\n\nMr Kuczynski denied pardoning him as part of a deal with his party last week to avoid his own impeachment.\n\nPolice in the capital Lima clashed with protesters after the news emerged.\n\nTwo members of President Kuczynski's party in the Peruvian Congress, Vicente Zeballos and Alberto de Belaunde, resigned in protest at the pardon.\n\nMeanwhile, supporters of the man who led Peru from 1990 to 2000 celebrated outside the city hospital where he was being treated.\n\nHe is admired by some Peruvians for combating Maoist rebels but his critics considered him a corrupt dictator.\n\nHis son Kenji tweeted video of himself breaking the news of the pardon to his father in his hospital bed and wishing him a Merry Christmas.\n\nAllow Twitter content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

The reality is that this sadly was a political agreement between the Fujimorists and the current government.\"\n\nJose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch in the Americas, tweeted: \"I regret Fujimori's humanitarian pardon.\n\n\"Instead of reaffirming that in a state of law there is no special treatment for anyone, the idea that his liberation was a vulgar political negotiation in exchange for Pedro Pablo Kuczynski maintaining power will remain forever.\"\n\nAllow Twitter content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .
