        "text": "2.1. Prescription of H. pylori eradication therapy\n\nPrescription of H. pylori eradication therapy throughout Japan was calculated using the claims database for Hokkaido (the north island of Japan) combined with the National Database (NDB). We investigated the prescriptions for primary eradication therapy for H. pylori. The number of patients receiving primary eradication therapy throughout Japan was calculated by determining the actual number of treatment pack formulation for primary eradication using data from the NDB.18 The NDB contains information about claims and specific health examinations, and allows easy retrieval of claims data. Using the anonymized electronic medical claims in this database, we extracted the number of prescription of treatment packs for primary eradication therapy (packs containing Lansap and Rabecure) from the first open data published by the MHLW (April 2014 to March 2015).18 During this period, 7 223 983 treatment packs of medication were prescribed for primary eradication therapy. Since the duration of treatment is 7 days, this was sufficient medication for primary eradication therapy in 1 031 998 patients.\n\nThe claims database for Hokkaido contains anonymized claims data from the NHI scheme and the medical care system for very elderly patients (aged 75 years or older) in all cities, towns, and villages of Hokkaido. Information has been collected for this database independently of the NDB by the Hokkaido government and Hokkaido University in collaboration since 2009 when the use of electronic medical claims has become widespread. In this study, we also investigated prescriptions of H. pylori eradication therapy in Hokkaido using the Hokkaido claims database.\n\nThe number of patients receiving primary eradication therapy with pack formulations and those receiving equivalent medications prescribe separately as current regimens for H. pylori eradication therapy have become more diversified. Accordingly, we investigated the use of two treatment pack formulations (Lansap and Rabecure packs) and concurrent use of a proton‐pump inhibitor (PPI) and/or a potassium‐competitive acid blocker (P‐CAB), amoxicillin, and clarithromycin as primary eradication therapy. The number of prescriptions was calculated for omeprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole, and rabeprazole as PPIs, along with the number for vonoprazan as a P‐CAB. If medications were available as generic formulations, these were also included in calculation. Separate prescription for amoxicillin and clarithromycin for primary eradication therapy was defined as separate prescription for 7 days from the same day in combination with a PPI or P‐CAB for the same period. Therefore, the number of Lansap and Rabecure packs prescribed from April 2014 to March 2015 was calculated from the Hokkaido claims database. Then we calculated the annual prescription of H. pylori eradication therapy in Hokkaido by combining the use of pack formulations (Lansap and Rabecure packs) and the concurrent use of PPI/P‐CAB, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin prescribed for the same period as primary eradication therapy. A total of 27 841 received H. pylori eradication therapy in Hokkaido during this period based on the number of prescriptions.\n\nUsing the same approach, we extracted the number of patients receiving primary eradication therapy with treatment pack formulations and for separately prescribed drugs between April 2010 and March 2017 from the Hokkaido claims database and calculated the number of patients receiving primary eradication therapy throughout Japan based on the extracted data.\n\n2.2. Calculation of deaths from gastric cancer\n\nThe number of deaths from gastric cancer was determined from data provided by the MHLW, the National Cancer Center Japan, and the Cancer Statistics in Japan (2015) published by the Foundation for Promotion of Cancer Research to evaluate the influence of H. pylori eradication therapy being approved for health insurance coverage on death from this cancer. Information on deaths from gastric cancer was extracted from Vital Statistics data (1958 to 2016) in the Cancer Registry and Statistics (Cancer Information Service, National Cancer Center, Japan),19 and the annual numbers were graphed using Excel. Gastric cancer mortality predicted by a model that used age, calendar year, and their interactions as explanatory variables was obtained from Cancer Incidence by Age Group: Monitoring Cancer Incidence in Japan (national estimates from 1975 to 2012) and actual cancer mortality was extracted from the from Vital Statistics (actual data from 1975 to 2015).20 Then the expected and the observed number of deaths from gastric cancer were compared using a chi‐square test. The expected mortality was provided by National Cancer Center.21\n\nTo evaluate whether the discrepancy between the expected and the observed deaths of gastric cancer is transient or not, joinpoint analysis21 was performed using annual gastric cancer mortality from 1958 to 2016 using a program provided by National Cancer Institute (https://surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint/download).\n\n3.1. Prescription of H. pylori eradication therapy\n\nThe number of patients receiving primary H. pylori eradication therapy from April 2010 to November 2016 was calculated from the number of prescriptions in the Hokkaido database (Figure ); 27 841 patients received primary eradication therapy in Hokkaido from April 2010 to November 2016. Similarly, it was calculated that the number of patients receiving primary eradication therapy in Hokkaido was 12 410 in 2010, 11 459 in 2011, 11 280 in 2012, 27 324 in 2013, 27 841 in 2014, and 31 979 in 2015. When the number of patients receiving primary H. pylori eradication therapy throughout Japan was estimated from these data, it was 613 675 in 2010, 566 648 in 2011, 602 564 in 2012, 1 459 615 in 2013, 1 487 233 in 2014, 1 557 318 in 2015 and 1 400 641 in 2016 (Figure ).\n\nThus, the number of patients receiving H. pylori eradication therapy showed a rapid increase after the indications for H. pylori eradication therapy were expanded to include H. pylori gastritis in February 2013. Approximately 6 million patients received H. pylori eradication therapy over 12 years after NHI rebates for such therapy became available in 2000, while 4.3 million patients have undergone H. pylori eradication therapy in the 3 years since the indications were expanded. It can, therefore, be presumed that approximately 10 million patients have undergone eradication therapy to date. When primary eradication therapy for H. pylori was defined as prescription of one of the two treatment pack formulations [Lansap (triple therapy pack for H. pylori eradication that contains lansoprazole, amoxicillin hydrate, clarithromycin) and Rabecure (triple therapy pack for H. pylori eradication that contains rabeprazole, amoxicillin hydrate, and clarithromycin)], as well as the antibiotics plus omeprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole, and rabeprazole or vonoprazan, it was found that the annual prescription of H. pylori eradication therapy increased 2.42 times (1 351 172/557 796) compared with before the indications for eradication therapy were expanded. This trend was stable.\n\n3.2. Death from gastric cancer\n\nThe number of deaths from gastric cancer was 48 632 in 2013, 47 903 in 2014, 46 659 in 2015, and 45 509 in 2016 showing a decreasing trend after widening of the NHI indications for H. pylori eradication therapy, according to cancer mortality data (1958 to 2014) from the Vital Statistics in the Cancer Registry and Statistics19 (Figure ). The decrease in the number of gastric cancer deaths to 45 509 in 2016 represented a fall of 9.2% in the 4 years after the indications for H. pylori eradication therapy were expanded (Figure ). The expected deaths of gastric cancer using the previously observed data are shown by the National Cancer Center on its homepage.21 From 2013 to 2016, discrepancies were observed between the observed and the expected gastric cancer deaths. Observed/Expected deaths (O/E ratio) were 48 632/50 000 (0.97) in 2013, 47 903/50 300 (0.95) in 2014, 46 659/49 800 (0.94) in 2015, and 45 509/48 500 (0.94) in 2016, where all P‐values for chi‐square tests were less than 1.0×10−10. We performed, joinpoint analyzes. The three joinpoints model on mortality from 1958 to 2016 shows that tendency of gastric cancer mortality changed around 2010, and the mortality of GC has decreased since then."
