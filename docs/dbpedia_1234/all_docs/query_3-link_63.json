        "text": "Three months before he granted Alberto Fujimori a pardon on medical grounds, Peru's President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski met the jailed former president's son, lawmaker Kenji Fujimori, to discuss his release, a source close to the president said.\n\nAfter a ceremony at the ornate presidential palace where he grew up, Kenji asked Kuczynski to free his ailing father from prison and offered him political support in Congress in return, the source said on condition of anonymity.\n\nA former Wall Street banker, Kuczynski was struggling to govern alongside the right-wing party Popular Force, led by Keiko Fujimori, Fujimori's daughter and a twice-defeated presidential candidate. Popular Force had used its majority in Congress to oust key ministers in Kuczynski's government, delaying his plans to revive economic growth with infrastructure projects."
