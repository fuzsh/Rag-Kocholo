However, Tsitsi has a secret motivation: he wants to punish his former classmate, Guga (31), who used to make life difficult for the entire class at school. Several male classmates gather at the school to drink and talk. As their time together progresses, Tsitsi gets drunk and tries to accomplish his goal.\n\nDirector’s filmography\n\nDavid Pirtskhalava was born on April 13, 1987 in Tbilisi, Georgia.

I was born and raised in the suburbs of Tbilisi, where I also went to school, where bullying, abuse, beating, and ridiculing people was almost the daily norm. On many occasions, I found myself to have been the victim, and many times I also became the bully myself. This was, of course, unintended. The environment offered us certain conditions as children, and we unconsciously accepted them. After reflecting, I came up with this idea: What if former classmates were to meet each other after a long break to remember their childhood and party, even if none of them have any good things to remember? What if the victim were to invite the bully and orchestrate a process similar to a court ruled by the thirst for vengeance?\n\nContact / Presenters\n\nMillimeter Film\n\n10 A Sandro Akhmeteli Street, 0159, Tbilisi, Georgia\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nDavit Pirtskhalava | Director, Scriptwriter\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMobile: +995 593 645 222\n\nTiko Nadirashvili | Producer\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMobile: +995 595 392 418\n\nAn Owl, a Garden and the Writer\n\nAn Owl, a Garden and the Writer\n\nCountries:\n\nIran, France\n\nDirected by:\n\nSara Dolatabadi\n\nScriptwriter:\n\nSara Dolatabadi\n\nProducer:\n\nAmir Naderi, Sara Dolatabadi, Farhad Mohammadi (associate producer)\n\nCamera:\n\nSara Dolatabadi\n\nLanguage:\n\nPersian\n\nGenre:\n\ncreative documentary\n\nRelease date:\n\n30.10.2022\n\nRuntime:\n\n75 min\n\nWhat’s missing:\n\nco-production, distributors, funding, sales agent\n\nThis film is director's feature debut.\n\nThis is the film’s working title and may change.\n\nFilm synopsis\n\nOn the backdrop of Iran’s recent political history, in an intimate setting, An Owl, a Garden and the Writer invites us to a poetic revelation of one of Iran’s most prominent writers, Mahmoud Dowlatabadi. Having been inspired by the way Mahmoud creates a fictional universe within their daily lives, his daughter, through her lens, portrays the imaginary world of her father in a parallel narrative line, blurring the lines of perceived reality for the audience. The film opens doors to the secret garden of Mahmoud’s life and draws a unique portrait of a novelist who has adopted a solitary routine outside the hassles of today’s Iranian society.\n\nDirector’s filmography\n\nSara is an Iranian multimedia visual artist. Her life was transformed at a young age when the Islamic Revolution changed the political landscape in Iran and by the Iran-Iraq War, which she experienced through the eyes of a child. These memories influenced her practice as a visual artist and filmmaker, which can be seen as a meeting point between the microcosm of the personal and the macrocosm of the political. After receiving her BFA from Azad Art University (Tehran), she spent the next decade living and exhibiting in Tokyo, Paris and New York. While in New York, she obtained her MFA from Hunter College and, for her thesis, she directed and produced a short documentary about her family.\n\nProducer’s filmography\n\nAmir Naderi is one of the most influential figures of 20th-century Iranian cinema. He first came into the international spotlight with films that are now known as international cinema classics – The Runner, and Water, Wind, Dust – which are considered to be among the most influential films of the past quarter century. His film Sound Barrier (2005) premiered at Tribeca Film Festival and won the Roberto Rossellini Prize at Rome Film Festival. Vegas: Based On a True Story (2008) won the CinemAvvenire Best Film in Competition Prize and the SIGNIS Award. Amir Naderi's recent releases include Monte (2017) (recipient of the Jaeger-LeCoultre Glory to the Filmmaker Award at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival).\n\nAuthor’s statement\n\nGrowing up, I was part of a stream of war, constant scrutiny from the authorities, and the censorship and prohibition of Mahmoud's books. Despite his popularity, I looked up to him above all not as a writer, but as a father. Experiencing life this way can bring families closer together while also causing tension. My film explores reimagining family dynamics, a man admired by his daughter, a public figure who fought for what he believed in, but whose presence was perhaps missing in my life. By doing so, I document the intertwined story of an exceptional public figure through a personal journey of rediscovering family ties through three generations with all its pain, triumph, conflict, sorrow and revelation.\n\nContact / Presenters\n\nSara Dolatabadi | Director\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMobile: +337 82 115 075\n\nFarhad Mohammadi | Associate Producer\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMobile: +130 16 028 575\n\nAnd His Brothers\n\nI ego bratya\n\nCountries:\n\nRussia, Germany, Belgium\n\nDirected by:\n\nAleksandra Likhacheva\n\nScriptwriter:\n\nAleksandra Likhacheva\n\nProducer:\n\nAnna Shalashina, Polina Schlicht (Monumental Pictures), Jurgen Buedts (Las Belgas)\n\nCamera:\n\nEvgeny Rodin\n\nLanguage:\n\nRussian\n\nGenre:\n\ndocumentary\n\nRelease date:\n\n20.03.2023\n\nRuntime:\n\n85 min\n\nWhat’s missing:\n\nadditional financing, international sales\n\nThis film is director's feature debut.\n\nThis is the film’s final distribution title.\n\nFilm synopsis\n\nEach person is individual and we – the residents of modern cities – know this. But there are places like Ossetia where this is not the case. This is the story of those who live on Ossetian land and uphold traditions – to be a warrior, to lead a clan, to obey the father. The story of five characters who are ultimately a single whole - the Ossetian people. Ossetia is a small Orthodox enclave surrounded by Muslim republics and the high Caucasus mountains. This film, in many ways, is an attempt to find God. Because there, in the mountains, where a person is too small and unprotected, you can't live without Him.\n\nDirector’s filmography\n\nAleksandra Likhacheva finished her first studies as an artist and graduated in 2011 from the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography (VGIK) as a film director. She is a member of the non-fiction and television film guild. Her short films have been shown and received awards at numerous Russian and international film festivals. She is now in pre-production of her debut feature Kretsul (Eurimages co-production development award winner at TIFF).\n\nFilmography:\n\n2011 – Katya Krenalinova (short), director, premiered at the IDFA Competition for student documentary.\n\n2014 – Long.Black.Cloud Is Coming Down (57'), director, premiered at Artdocfest (competition).\n\nProducer’s filmography\n\nAnna Shalashina was born on February 22, 1989. She graduated from the Linguistics Department of Lomonosov Moscow State University in 2011 and finished an MBA program at Kingston University (London) three years later. Her dissertation on film co-production was nominated for Best MBA Project of 2014. Member of EAVE (B’EST) since 2014. Filmography:\n\n2014 – Tsili (France, Russia, Israel), a feature film by Amos Gitai, premiered at Venice Film Festival.\n\n2018 – Donkey (Russia, Switzerland), a documentary by Anatoly Vasiliev, premiered at Rotterdam International Film Festival.\n\n2019 – Froth (Russia, Qatar), a documentary by Ilia Povolotskiy, premiered at IDFA (first appearance competition, jury special mention).\n\nAuthor’s statement\n\nOur film is one exact phrase spoken in passing about the present, about accumulated pain, about deep matters. Spoken in the midst of silence or in a gust of wind. Here she was and she was swept away. And there she was picked up by the one who shares your blood, who is of the same faith and was born on the same land as you. Ossetia is a place where all the talk is about God; otherwise, it’s just silence. I want to tell you that the ability to overcome stands behind the ringing silence of my characters. Their whole life is like climbing a mountain to pray and make a sacrifice. And more often than not, the victim himself is the one being sacrificed.\n\nThere are a number of political reasons for keeping silent, and I think this is wrong in relation to Ossetia and what its people have experienced.\n\nContact / Presenters\n\nWISH Media\n\nLeninskiy prospekt 152, 119571, Moscow, Russia\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMonumental Pictures\n\nBundesallee 213, 10719, Berlin, Germany\n\nAnna Shalashina | Producer\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMobile: +79 672 379 377\n\nAleksandra Likhacheva | Director\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMobile: +79 036 127 560\n\nAurora\n\nHajnal\n\nCountries:\n\nHungary, Romania\n\nDirected by:\n\nAttila Dávid\n\nScriptwriter:\n\nAttila Dávid\n\nProducer:\n\nAttila Dávid, Genovéva Petrovits\n\nCamera:\n\nMátyás Gyuricza\n\nMusic:\n\nJózsef Iszlai\n\nCast:\n\nNiké Kurta, Levente Orbán, Péter Katona\n\nLanguage:\n\nHungarian\n\nGenre:\n\ndrama\n\nRelease date:\n\n01.04.2022\n\nRuntime:\n\n70 min\n\nWhat’s missing:\n\nadditional post-production funding, international sales\n\nThis film is director's feature debut.\n\nThis is the film’s working title and may change.\n\nFilm synopsis\n\nEszter has been dealing with the death of her child for a year now.

My birth was also a difficult one, which nearly left my father a widower. This trauma that my parents had to endure greatly affected my childhood, and I was an only child for a long while. Within the family, we couldn't talk about these things. In 2019, when grandpa fell ill, I decided to create a life interview with all the members of my immediate family. From these discussions, I learned that my grandparents were also affected by child loss, and this made its mark on our family throughout the generations. My mother's and grandmother's perspective moved me the most. This was the moment I decided I wanted to make a film about this. My goal was to be able to broaden our own experience with that of others. I wanted to create a film with a personal tone while keeping it familiar to all.\n\nContact / Presenters\n\nKino Alfa\n\nKirály utca 80, 1068, Budapest, Hungary\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nAttila Dávid | Director\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMobile: +36 705 906 377\n\nGenovéva Petrovits | Producer\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMobile: +36 205 015 531\n\nBoney Piles\n\nTerykony\n\nCountries:\n\nUkraine\n\nDirected by:\n\nTaras Tomenko\n\nScriptwriter:\n\nTaras Tomenko\n\nProducer:\n\nVolodymyr Filippov\n\nCamera:\n\nMisha Lubarsky\n\nLanguage:\n\nUkrainian, Russian\n\nGenre:\n\ndocumentary\n\nRelease date:\n\n25.08.2022\n\nRuntime:\n\n70 min\n\nWhat’s missing:\n\ndistributors, sales agent\n\nThis is the film’s working title and may change.\n\nFilm synopsis\n\nNastya was ten when a missile fired by Russian terrorists on New Year's Eve changed her life forever.

The only means for Nastya's family to survive is the scrap metal they scavenge while under fire. Senya is seven years old. He is a first-grader. In the seven years of his life, he has seen seven years of war and not a day of peace. Senya likes to climb on the boney pile to watch the sunset.

The situation in the frontline zone is changing daily and it is difficult to predict developments at this time. All drama is dictated by war. The small mining town of Toretsk has been trembling from shelling for seven years. According to official statistics, about 10,000 children live in the war zone in Ukraine. It is necessary to document the fate of these children, as their example can tell us more about the situation of the children of war in general. Nastya's school is 500 meters from the front line, although a simple bullet can cover three times that distance. Too much pain and grief has passed through their hearts.\n\nContact / Presenters\n\nInsightmedia, LLC\n\nGertsena str, 17-25, 04050, Kyiv, Ukraine\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nTaras Tomenko | Director\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMobile: +380 673 929 397\n\nVolodymyr Filippov | Producer\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMobile: +380 681 479 044\n\nAndriy Suyarko | Producer\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMobile: +380 503 274 906\n\nDestiny\n\nDestiny\n\nCountries:\n\nIran\n\nDirected by:\n\nYaser Talebi\n\nScriptwriter:\n\nYaser Talebi\n\nProducer:\n\nElaheh Nobakht\n\nCamera:\n\nYaser Talebi\n\nLanguage:\n\nPersian\n\nGenre:\n\ndocumentary\n\nRelease date:\n\n30.12.2021\n\nRuntime:\n\n85 min\n\nWhat’s missing:\n\npost-production\n\nThis film has sales company attached.\n\nThis is the film’s working title and may change.\n\nFilm synopsis\n\nSahar is an 18-year-old girl living in a remote village in Northern Iran. Two years ago, her mother died unexpectedly of cancer. Since then, Sahar has lived alone with her cognitively impaired father Rahim and taken on her mother's care for him.\n\nThe traditional family demands that she should give up her own future dream and take care of her father. Sahar's wish is to study. She wants to make her mother's dream come true and be a doctor and help people, especially against the cancer that took her mother’s life away.\n\nSahar is torn: Should she listen to her uncle and humbly take on the role of her mother? Or should she help her aunt find a new wife for her father? Can she completely escape this pressure of expectations and go after her dreams?\n\nDirector’s filmography\n\nYaser Talebi was born in Sari in northern Iran in 1982. The director and screenwriter travels and explores his hometown to meet people again and again and explore the culture, history and nature of this special region on film. He is a member of the Iranian Documentary Filmmakers Association. His work already includes over eleven feature length documentaries.\n\nHis last documentary film Beloved, produced by Elaheh Nobakht, was the most successful Iranian documentary film and has been selected for more than 60 international film festivals such as:\n\n- IDFA 2018 - Mid Length Competition - Among Top 10 of Best Audience Award\n\n- 69th Berlin Film Festival - Culinary Cinema\n\n- Hot Doc 2019 - Best Audience Film\n\nProducer’s filmography\n\nElaheh Nobakht is a pioneering woman in the Iranian cinema industry. She has produced six feature films and three short films. She produced Beloved, the most successful Iranian documentary, which has been selected and chosen for the international competition section of more than 65 international film festivals such as IDFA, Berlinale Film Festival, Hot Docs, etc. She is also the international distributor of the documentary film Finding Farideh, which was the Iranian Cinema‘s official entry for the 2020 Oscars.\n\nAuthor’s statement\n\nSahar is caught in the dilemma of having to live with her father or opposing everything in order to pursue her own dreams independently. The paradox surrounding Sahar is representative of the social conflict between traditional social values and modern life in Iran and of many other young women worldwide. We avoid subjective interpretations as our camera directly observes Sahar’s life, struggles, thoughts and wishes for her future by capturing the images of her warm relationship with her father, her arguments with her aunt, her endeavours to be successful in school, and her disapproval of her father’s remarriage, as she does not want another woman to bear the same dreadful fate.\n\nContact / Presenters\n\nEli Image\n\nUnit 172, 8th Floor- No 1- Lavan Tower, Persian Golf Palace, Golchehreh Alley-Golchin St-Ozgol, 1696612869, Tehran, Iran\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nElaheh Nobakht | Producer\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMobile: +989 125 374 139\n\nYaser Talebi | Director\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMobile: +989 125 374 139\n\nFaggots, Friends\n\nFaggots, Friends\n\nCountries:\n\nPoland\n\nDirected by:\n\nAlex Baczyński-Jenkins\n\nScriptwriter:\n\nAlex Baczyński-Jenkins, Krzysztof Bagiński\n\nProducer:\n\nIvo Krankowski, Marta Łachacz\n\nCamera:\n\nKrzysztof Bagiński\n\nCast:\n\nFilip Rutkowski, Agata Grabowska, Dawid Nickel, Billy Morgan\n\nLanguage:\n\nPolish, English\n\nGenre:\n\ndocumentary\n\nRelease date:\n\n01.05.2022\n\nRuntime:\n\n90 min\n\nWhat’s missing:\n\nadditional financing (45,000 EUR budget gap), additional shooting\n\nThis film is director's feature debut.\n\nThis is the film’s working title and may change.\n\nFilm synopsis\n\nFour Warsaw-based queer performers go about their everyday lives – they perform, spend time with friends and lovers, protest and offer each other support, facing an increasingly hostile environment for LGBTQ+ communities in Poland.\n\nDirector’s filmography\n\nAlex Baczyński-Jenkins (Poland/UK) works with choreography, performance and film. His film works were presented at Kunsthalle Basel and Riga Biennial. Recipient of the 2018 Frieze Artist Award. Nominated for the Future Generation Art Prize in 2021 by the Pinchuk Art Centre. Finalist of the Polityka Passport Award in visual arts in 2018. His works have been presented in contexts including the Venice Biennale, David Roberts Art Foundation, Whitechapel Gallery, Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw, Chisenhale Gallery in London, and the Swiss Institute Contemporary Art in New York. He is co-founder of the Kem artist-run collective in Warsaw.\n\nProducer’s filmography\n\nIvo Krankowski is a writer-director, film producer and founder of La Camera Independent. He studied film directing at Central Saint Martins in London. Since 2019 he has been Pawel Pawlikowski’s literary collaborator. He is currently involved as a creative producer for Netflix original films in Poland.\n\nMarta Łachacz’s producing credits include Deep Love by Jan P. Matuszyński, Hycel by Daria Woszek and 16.03. by Natalia Siwicka. Her production coordinator credits include Dolce Fine Giornata by J. Borcuch.\n\nAuthor’s statement\n\nIn my work I focus on relationships, feelings and community. This film documents the everyday lives of queer friends and performers in Warsaw at this critical moment in time of gaining visibility and being declared enemies of the state. The film approaches vulnerable and intimate minor events against their political backdrop. The film is therefore embedded in current events, e.g. pride in Białystok (2019), presidential elections (2020), and homophobic vans and billboards.\n\nI believe this film will be about something essential – interpersonal relations and friendships, as well as documenting the life of the LGBTQ+ community at this particular moment, which is so crucial for the fight against discrimination.\n\nThrough a cinematic language of tenderness and empathetic associative editing, Faggots, Friends becomes an ode to friendship and queer life.\n\nContact / Presenters\n\nLa Camera Independent\n\nAl.

Trying to cope with the loss of the family and the pain and shame that came along with it, they each found relief in different forms of spirituality. Despite this, their past love for each other made room for fear, revolt and despair. The film follows the relationship between my mother and father for a year and a half after their decision to break up and my conversations with each of them during this painful period.\n\nDirector’s filmography\n\nTudor Platon is a Romanian director of photography known for films like The Christmas Gift (Academy Awards shortlisted), 4:15 P.M.

EFA Deputy Chairwoman, Executive President of EWA, winner of Prix Eurimages, EFA Awards 2013.\n\nAuthor’s statement\n\nThe news that my parents are separating didn’t come as much of a surprise, as there had been fights and talks of a divorce ever since I was a child. But no one anticipated the pain this would cause our entire family. That’s why I started to film my parents. For more than a year, I tried to be there for them, involuntarily taking sides, sometimes making it better, sometimes worse. In the Name of the Mother and of the Father is about the different shapes love can take and what is left of a family when love is gone.\n\nContact / Presenters\n\nmicroFILM\n\n23A Gramont Street, 040182, Bucharest, Romania\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nCarla Fotea | Producer\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMobile: +40 754 090 595\n\nTudor Platon | Director\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMobile: +40 725 215 752\n\nLucky Girl\n\nYa, Nina\n\nCountries:\n\nUkraine\n\nDirected by:\n\nMarysia Nikitiuk\n\nScriptwriter:\n\nMarysia Nikitiuk\n\nProducer:\n\nYanina Sokolova, Julia Sinkevych\n\nCamera:\n\nSergey Michalchyk\n\nMusic:\n\nAnton Baibakov\n\nCast:\n\nKsenya Khyjnyak, Olexiy Tritenko, Igor Koltovskoy, Maxim Panchenko\n\nLanguage:\n\nUkrainian\n\nWebsite:\n\nhttps://yanina.life/film\n\nGenre:\n\ndrama\n\nRelease date:\n\n13.03.2022\n\nRuntime:\n\n115 min\n\nWhat’s missing:\n\nfestivals, post-production funding, sales agent\n\nThis is the film’s final distribution title.\n\nFilm synopsis\n\nLucky Girl is a realistic drama featuring a sudden change in the life of a young woman Nina after being diagnosed with osteosarcoma and losing her arm.

When she asked me to write a script on this topic, my best friend and psychotherapist had just died from cancer. She was a person with extreme life energy. Paradoxically, the maximum level of vitality is revealed only in the face of death.\n\nTo write this script, I interviewed more than 30 cancer patients, their relatives and doctors. I was impressed by the vital energy of cancer patients, their attention to detail and the need to live every moment consciously and carefully. I have combined Sokolova’s story with the stories of other people I’ve interviewed in order to write an ode to life and the enormous energy a person can carry within him or herself.\n\nContact / Presenters\n\nYanina Sokolova Production\n\nSyrecka street 38, 04073, Kyiv, Ukraine\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMarysia Nikitiuk | Director\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMobile: +380 968 092 374\n\nYanina Sokolova | Producer\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMobile: +380 504 422 876\n\nJulia Sinkevych | Producer\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMobile: +380 667 386 741\n\nTina & Megi\n\nTina & Megi\n\nCountries:\n\nGeorgia, Germany\n\nDirected by:\n\nIoseb \"Soso\" Bliadze\n\nScriptwriter:\n\nTamar Mumladze, Ioseb \"Soso\" Bliadze\n\nProducer:\n\nEva Blondiau\n\nCamera:\n\nDimirti Dekanosidze\n\nLanguage:\n\nGeorgian\n\nGenre:\n\ndrama\n\nRelease date:\n\n01.02.2022\n\nRuntime:\n\n85 min\n\nWhat’s missing:\n\nediting and post-production, festivals, international sales, post-production funding\n\nThis is the film’s working title and may change.\n\nFilm synopsis\n\n2021, Tbilisi. During the coronavirus pandemic. Tina, a young woman, moves in with Megi (27) while waiting for her boyfriend Beka to come back to Tbilisi. They want to move together. But when Beka finally returns, he has other plans. His family is against this relationship because Tina was married and cheated on her husband with Beka. He leaves Tina.\n\nTina has no money, has never worked, and is shunned by everyone. Knowing no other place to go, she stays with Megi. They become friends. Megi shows Tina the advantages of living a self-determined life. They drink, they party, and Tina has new sexual experiences, even with Megi. But Megi still has a plan to emigrate. It’s time for Tina to learn to fly.\n\nDirector’s filmography\n\nBorn in Tbilisi, Georgia, 1986. After graduating from high school, I studied at Tbilisi State University, Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences, Institute of Applied Mathematics and Computer Sciences, Major in Informatics. 2008 - Prior to 2012, I studied at Shota Rustaveli Theatre and Film Georgian State University, Faculty of Film and TV, Major in Directing. After the diploma work The Most Precious (2012), I made another short film Three Steps (2017), which premiered at Rotterdam Film Festival and was later shown at 20 other festivals and received 10 awards. Tradition premiered at Clermont Ferrand. My debut feature film Otar’s Death will premiere in August 2021 at Karlovy Vary IFF.\n\nProducer’s filmography\n\nEva Blondiau graduated from film school in Cologne in 2012 with The Swing of the Coffin Maker. Her film was invited to more than 100 festivals and won over 40 awards, including a Student Oscar. In 2013, she founded the production company COLOR OF MAY with business partner Elmar Imanov and produced the short, Torn, which premiered in the Directors' Fortnight at Cannes in 2014. They co-produced Soso Bliadze's short Three Steps and V. Glasunowa/L. Lakomy's feature documentary Long Echo as well as Boris Khlebnikov's Arrhythmia. Imanov's feature debut End of Season won the FIPRESCI Prize in Rotterdam 2019.\n\nAuthor’s statement\n\nGeorgia is still a patriarchal country. Young women \"belong\" first to their father, then to their husband. Education is secondary. This makes it difficult for young women to strive for independence, partly because they are ostracized if they want to make their own decisions. Choosing an independent and self-determined life is therefore often a decision against the family. Although there are also modern families in the capital Tbilisi, Tina's story is not a rarity. The limitations I experienced due to COVID made the limitations these women must face even more clear. And the fact that I have a daughter now made this topic very urgent to me. I wanted to tell the story as authentically as possible and co-wrote it with Taki Mumladze.\n\nContact / Presenters\n\nCOLOR OF MAY\n\nNeuenhöfer Allee 19a, 50937, Cologne, Germany\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nEva Blondiau | Producer\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMobile: +491 783 195 751\n\nIoseb \"Soso\" Bliadze | Director, Scriptwriter\n\nTamar \"Taki\" Mumladze | Scriptwriter\n\nUnwanted\n\nNich'ya\n\nCountries:\n\nRussia\n\nDirected by:\n\nLena Lanskih\n\nScriptwriter:\n\nLena Lanskih, Ekaterina Perfilova\n\nProducer:\n\nNatalia Drozd, Sergey Selyanov\n\nCamera:\n\nMikhail Weitsenfeld\n\nLanguage:\n\nRussian\n\nGenre:\n\ndrama\n\nRelease date:\n\n01.11.2021\n\nRuntime:\n\n110 min\n\nWhat’s missing:\n\nfestivals, sales agent\n\nThis film is director's feature debut.\n\nThis is the film’s final distribution title.\n\nFilm synopsis\n\nAfter having an unwanted baby, 14-year-old Vika faces health issues, rejection by friends and community, and betrayal by the person who was her only hope for love.

Her sudden motherhood burdens her, and she feels discarded by the world around her. She tries to find the strength to cope with her new reality – but the pressure is too strong. At first glance, our film is about the desperate pursuit of freedom. But below the surface lies another, deeper meaning: all of Vika’s actions are dictated by her desire to feel loved – a desire she cannot fulfil in the world that confines her. Lovelessness is passed down through generations, and predetermines Vika’s attitude towards her baby daughter.\n\nContact / Presenters\n\nCTB Film Company\n\n10, Kamennoostrovskiy Prospekt, 197 101, Saint-Petersburg, Russia\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nNatalia Drozd | Producer\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMobile: +79 219 155 522\n\nLena Lanskih | Director\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMobile: +79 998 082 012\n\nVictim\n\nObeť\n\nCountries:\n\nSlovak Republic, Czech Republic, Germany\n\nDirected by:\n\nMichal Blaško\n\nScriptwriter:\n\nJakub Medvecký\n\nProducer:\n\nJakub Viktorín, Pavla Janoušková Kubečková\n\nCamera:\n\nAdam Mach\n\nCast:\n\nVita Smachelyuk, Gleb Kuchuk, Alena Mihulová, Claudia Dudová, Gabriela Míčová, Inna Zhulina, Igor Chmela, Viktor Zavadil\n\nLanguage:\n\nCzech, Ukrainian\n\nWebsite:\n\nhttps://nutprodukcia.sk/project/obet/\n\nGenre:\n\ndrama\n\nRelease date:\n\n20.05.2022\n\nRuntime:\n\n90 min\n\nWhat’s missing:\n\nfestivals, international distribution, partners, sales agent\n\nThis film is director's feature debut.\n\nThis is the film’s final distribution title.\n\nFilm synopsis\n\nIrina is a single mother, a Ukrainian woman living in a small Czech town.

The company prefers projects that connect Slovakia with other countries, as evidenced by our regular attendance at markets and workshops (Victim, Caravan / Cannes L’Atelier, Tonny, Shelly, and the Spirit /Junior Coproduction Market at Cinekid). Nutprodukcia recently produced the feature debut By a Sharp Knife (2019, IFF Cottbus - Special Prize for the director), and co-produced Spoor (2017, Silver Bear Prize at IFF Berlinale), the feature documentary Circus Rwanda (2018, KVIFF), and the short-animated film Overboard! (2019, Cinekid).\n\nAuthor’s statement\n\nIn all of my previous films, I have been careful to make the characters appear authentic, relatable and human. For me, the point is for the audience to identify with their experience of the situation and understand, in this case, the extent of the problem that Igor and Irina have got themselves into and the tragedy of the consequences they must bear.\n\nBoth storylines, i.e. the mother-son storyline and the individual-society storyline, are intimately connected and feed into each other. By painting a detailed emotional portrait of Irina, I would like to expose the society for which she becomes a temporary mascot, until she eventually ends up as a caricature of herself. Irina becomes a victim in the matter of her love for her son and her best intentions to find and punish his attackers.\n\nContact / Presenters\n\nnutprodukcia\n\nPalárikova 13, 811 04, Bratislava, Slovakia\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMobile: +421948050189\n\nnutprodukce\n\nPíseckého 333/15, 150 00, Praha 5, Czech Republic\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nJakub Viktorín | Producer\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMobile: +421 948 050 189\n\nMichal Blaško | Director\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMobile: +421 903 250 225"
