It’s strong, solid and masculine.\n\nThe naming highlights the importance of the individualism and exclusivity of selected individuals.\n\nThe visual identity of the brand is built around the solid and structural logotype.\n\nAn essential part of the logo is letter S and pointing arrows (triangles) that once more symbolize\n\nbrand’s concentration on the individual.\n\nCredits\n\nClient – Terabank\n\nAgency – Windfor’s\n\nCreative Concept – Nino Gordeladze, Vato Kavtaradze, Beqa Meparishvili\n\nExecutive Creative Director – Nino Gordeladze\n\nSenior Copywriter – Irina Sakvarelidze\n\nSenior Art Director – Mari Sukhishvili\n\nArt director – Teona Shelia\n\nCreative Strategy – Tsotne Mazmanishvili, Giorgi Chikhradze\n\nClient Service Director – Tamar Tsintsadze\n\nAccount Manager – Mariam Gogodze\n\nHead of Design – Natia Kvaratskhelia\n\nGraphic Designers – Sergo Titenkov, Meko Chikadze\n\nRe|Bank\n\nPasha Bank Georgia was planning to create a separate brand of a new retail bank\n\nand a range of sub-brands of unique retail financial products.\n\nThe concept was a Bank-Supermarket – universal retail bank, focused on meeting\n\nthe daily financial needs of ordinary people.\n\nThe task of the agency was to develop an umbrella brand of the bank and\n\na system of sub-brands of products.\n\nRe|Bank\n\nFor Changes\n\nTherefore we came up with the naming and visual style that implied re-establishing,\n\nrenovating, re-thinking, re-creating and re-evaluating the concept of banking as we know it.\n\nWith disruption in the market, we created the notion that something fundamentally\n\nnew has appeared in the banking sector.\n\nVideo and Visual Style\n\nThe simplicity and direct answers were integrated into the brand philosophy.\n\nTherefore Re|Bank and its products were introduced in a minimalistic typography video,\n\nwith unique visual and sound styles.\n\nThe video acted as an intro to Bank Philosophy and Products.\n\nCredits\n\nClient: Re|Bank\n\nCreative Chairman: Vato Kavtaradze\n\nExecutive Creative Directors: Beqa Meparishvili, Nino Gordeladze\n\nCreative Director: Bibi Asatiani\n\nSenior Art Director: Mari Sukhishvili\n\nSenior Copywriter: Beqa Meparishvili\n\nClient Service Director: Tamar Tsintsadze\n\nSenior Account Manager: Inga Svanidze\n\nDesigners: Dati Chanadiri, Sergo Titenkov\n\nStrategic Planner: Tsotne Mazniashvili\n\nNaming: Bibi Asatiani\n\nProduction: WINDFOR’S\n\nExecutive Producer and Post-production Manager: Natia Nikoleishvili\n\nEditing: Goga Tsikolia\n\nSound Design and Music: Post Red Audio\n\nCGI Artists: Levan Khomeriki and Rhea Mamatsashvili"
