        "text": "14 new members joined the Natural Wine Association. In the spring of 2022, the Association received applications from 25 wine cellars for membership.

Finally, based on the results of the inspection, the founders of the Association decided to admit new members.\n\nHowever, the Association refused several wine cellars to join the association this year. The reason for the refusal აagain is the unacceptable substances detected during the inspection process in the vineyard (herbicides and systemic preparations) and in the wine (industrial additives, astringents), which are against the philosophy of natural viticulture and winemaking.\n\nNWA.GE presents short descriptions of the new members of the Association:\n\nMushkudiani Winery is a family business, being developed by four generations of the family.
