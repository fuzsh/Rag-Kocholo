        "text": "We are a creative agency “watergunz” and we have recently launched a social campaign with a manifest to change the law and make bladed weapons less accessible to underage individuals in the country of Georgia.\n\nThe problem is that there are about 50 shops in Georgia’s capital where bladed weapons are accessible to everyone. As a result, within the last three years, more than 540 bladed weapons were recovered from Tbilisi schools and about 80 people died from bladed weapons, out of which 10 were teenagers.\n\nMore info: manifest.ge | Facebook\n\nMuseum of Indifference\n\nShare icon\n\nResearch showed that the society and the government of Georgia were not aware or hadn’t realized the problem of free accessibility of bladed weapons in the streets. The aim of the campaign is to create awareness of the problem and put the government and public on spot to make changes.\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nFor this purpose, we carried out an experiment by asking teenagers to buy bladed weapons in Tbilisi. They were able to purchase about 100 items including knives, electroshock weapons and other objects within a couple of hours.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nThese objects were used to create a weapon orchestra, consisting of 11 musical instruments playing Georgian folk song, each instrument having its own specially written piece to perform.\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nThis song is also a very important part of the concept, as it is known to practically every individual in Georgia. The song is taught at kindergartens and sung at home by almost everyone during their childhood. Since it’s a folk song, at some point in the history of Georgia, the text was modified into a brutalist version, which goes as follows: “If somebody says a bad thing about you, you should put a knife in their hearts”. The song is so common that most people don’t even realize the message it sends.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nThe concept of the campaign comes together in an idea that we, as a society, teach kids how to behave, if they get angry and we, as a society, hand them weapons by not realizing how accessible it is in the streets. And the government, in its own, is not doing anything to prevent it.\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nWe plan to continue to push the initiative with various OOH activities, such as the recent “Museum of Indifference” on Tbilisi’s main avenue, where anyone had the chance to interact with the instruments and sign the petition on sight.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nIt must also be noted that this is the first time an advertising agency has started a completely independent, in-house social campaign in Georgia, with no sponsor, external funding, whatsoever.\n\nShare icon\n\nHave You Ever Heard the Sound of Indifference?\n\nCredits:\n\nAgency – watergunz\n\nProduction Company – Enkeny Films\n\nCreative Director – Bacho Meburishvili\n\nSenior Art Director – Matassi Sulakauri\n\nSound/Music Composer – Tornike Karchkhadze\n\nElectronic Specialist – Mamuka Apakidze\n\nCreative Team – Niko Ksnelashvili, Toy Rua Toidze, Zura Jijiashvili, Vano Kuparadze\n\nStrategists – Mariam Mikelashvili, Elene Gugushvili\n\nGraphic Designer – Baia Lomsadze\n\nCG Artist – Akaki Kapanadze\n\nProject Managers – Tatia Jikia, Nini Dvalishvili\n\nDigital Media Strategist – Sophie Popiashvili\n\nDirector – Dato Borchkhadze\n\nDoP – Omar Gelashvili\n\nProducer – Sopho Orjonikidze\n\nDecoration – Jimsher Berdzenishvili, Giorgi Kavelashvili, Gia Aprasidze, Dato Omanashvili, Erekle Gordeladze, Kino Fabrika\n\nLight & Camera Equipment – JagaGrip\n\nFocus Puller – Dito Dekanosidze\n\nDolly – Goga Chanturia\n\nGaffer – Vazha Aprasidze\n\nLighting – Misha Saganelidze, Leri Kapanadze, Robert Arakelian\n\nProduction Sound Mixer – Bacho Gvetadze\n\nSound Assistant – Nika Kokhreidze\n\nProduction Designer – Dato Chkoidze\n\nProduction Designer Assistant – Zaza Gogorishvili\n\nSFX – Soso Gvasalia, Dato Gvasalia\n\nSpecial thanks to: Georgian Film, JagaGrip, Kino Fabrika, Giorgi Shvelidze, Paata Godziashvili, Nino Tsitlauri, Sandro Nikolaishvili, Sopho Vasadze"
