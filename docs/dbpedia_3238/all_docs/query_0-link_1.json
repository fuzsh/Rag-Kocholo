        "text": "🐈🎄𝗠𝗘𝗢𝗪-𝗬 𝗫𝗠𝗔𝗦 𝗔𝗡𝗗 𝗛𝗔𝗣𝗣𝗬 𝗛𝗢𝗟𝗜𝗗𝗔𝗬𝗦! 🐈🎄 For the Christmas update in “𝗠𝗲𝗼𝘄𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘂𝗺” I was in charge of a more technical task, coming in handy my current pursue of Technical Art studies- cleaning up our art assets! 🧹 Some aspects I discovered when cleaning up assets in a game: - 🖇️ Be very careful with 𝙧𝙚𝙣𝙖𝙢𝙞𝙣𝙜! Many things are going to be linked together, meaning a small change can cause something else to stop working. - ▶️ Play, play, and 𝙧𝙚𝙥𝙡𝙖𝙮! Because things might stop working, it’s crucial to check the game constantly to see what changes you made might have caused an issue and fix it asap. - 💻 Lots of 𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙢𝙞𝙩𝙨 = Happy project - If you are using a repository for your project, always commit your changes (even if small!) frequently! If something causes an issue, it’s better to pinpoint in smaller bits what might be causing it rather than looking into a big chunk of changes where multiple things need to be checked. I'm looking forward to optimizing our game meshes in the next steps so everyone can dash through the levels with the smoothest experience possible! 💨But enough about cleaning - 𝗚𝗼 𝗴𝗲𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗲 𝘂𝗽 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 (𝗳𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗵) 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗯𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝗱𝗮𝘆 𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲! https://lnkd.in/gss-Pdcj\n\nDo you play the game of Life as a Hero or NPC? Here is how you can be the Hero of your own story: In 2022, I attended my first Mindvalley Party. Thousands of people come together in Estonia to grow, learn, and party together every year. The best part is that everyone there acts like a hero. So, what are the traits of a Hero? - Heroes help others. - Heroes grow and level up. - Heroes play to continue playing. These traits were highlighted repeatedly during the party and throughout the whole 3-week event. The people I met there all have a mission to help others and make a positive impact. They continued to learn by listening and talking to the best teachers and thought leaders. They focused on having fun without taking life too seriously. Because they know the better they get, the better they can help others. And the best way to get better is by playing longer. By optimizing for fun, you play the longest. The game of life is not something you can win. You win by playing. How can you play as a Hero while having fun?\n\nEarlier this year, we launched the Ypto Move Challenge 2023: one big challenge consisting of 20 smaller ones that benefit the mental and physical health of our collaborators. Project Manager Danny Gijbels is one of our most enthusiastic participants. He has already completed 15 challenges! But why is he such a big fan of YMC 2023? “The challenge is accessible to everyone, but that doesn’t mean it’s too easy for the athletes among us. For some challenges, you can slowly work towards your goal. For others, even experienced athletes have to push their limits. In short, there is something for everyone! There are also some challenges you can take on with your colleagues. Before YMC 2023, my colleagues and I used to go for lunchtime walks along the canal from time to time. Since the launch of the challenge, more and more people have been joining our group. Some challenges even sparked competition between colleagues 😊. Not only do you get to know your colleagues better, but you also discover new places you would not normally go to. Fun fact: when I was on holiday, I did the ‘Sun Salutation’ challenge by the pool, which didn’t go unnoticed. Some of the hotel guests joined me in my practice. Even the hotel’s sports animator was delighted to hear that Ypto organises such challenges for its staff.” #YptoMoveChallenge #weareYpto\n\nYesterday I was giving at Digi & Game Center via great people of Peliosuuskunta Expa (Expa Game Business Co-operative) a talk about how to land into job in Game industry and main points were that network and make your things seen like porfolio, demos, hobby things and whatever open for people to see and to know what you have done. So to as an example and note to myself too to do in Practise What i Preached. Today i noticed that I have made / arranged with great people easily over 100 game industry related events and about 30 different kind of startup pitch events (game and non game) - and this do not mean how many i have been my self pitching / attending, that is own story So in very finnish standarts I can now say that maybe i can make events =D #gamedev #careers #events #ownership The Picture from one of the events, we been doing..\n\nUpdate: Saturday's Build Something Dumb event was a lot of fun! The group came up with and worked on 5 app and business concepts. Brian Schuster came up with Caesar - a conversational AI bot that always steers the conversation back to talking about ancient rome. Zack Pennington came up with Influent - a chrome extension that helps you maximize the cringiness factor of LinkedIn posts. Garrett Dailey came up VCease - an platform that replaces VCs with AI. \"VCease uses the world's most cutting edge technology to spend even less time looking at your company\" Alex Graveley worked on an email plugin that helps you prevent developing friendships with other people at work. I worked on SleepTok: basically the opposite of TikTok. Sleeptok bores you to sleep by playing you the most boring passages from audiobooks. If you want to see more from these creative geniuses, please reach out. Posting some screenshots of what we worked on in the comments. 👇👇👇\n\nEp.4 Vinadive | Export the Next Big Thing In the event of the Vietnam Gamemaker Conference on October 31, Appota and Gamota are proud to be one of the main sponsors and thought leadership From the conference, we are confident to announce: that Vietnam's Game Industry is about to Export the Next Big Thing\" With its rapidly growing domestic market, strategic location in Southeast Asia, and rising pool of talented developers, Vietnam has all the ingredients for success.
