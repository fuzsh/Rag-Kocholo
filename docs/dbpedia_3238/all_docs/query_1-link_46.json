That is why our assistant programs in those countries that want them are not only appreciated they’re very valuable, and they’re in the interest of the people in that country, but this is not something imposed, this is something which these countries want to do, by joining the Council of Europe they have shown they want to improve human rights and democracy in their countries and so we’re not imposing something.

I think there is some misunderstanding about this in Eastern Europe, but I have to say the responsibility also rests with some politicians in Western Europe who do talk as if they were teachers, teaching people in Eastern Europe how to behave, the arrogance of some people in Western Europe is self-defeating and counter productive if we are trying to raise the level of human rights democracy and the rule of law throughout Europe.

OUT.- 10.11.07\n\nIN.- 10.11.08 On camera Jean-Paul Costa\n\nPresident\n\nEuropean Court of Human Rights\n\nWe can not, of course, provide to anyone happiness, riches, prosperity, love, we\n\nwould like to be a kind of international Santa Claus but we are not. Our task is really\n\nvery important, it’s to ensure that the states respect the commitments they made by\n\nsigning the Convention, namely respect the fundamental freedoms and liberties\n\nwhich are listed in the Convention and that is all.

OUT.- 10.12.14\n\nIN.- 10.12.17 NARR.- On 16th.December,2005, alleging that their right to peaceful\n\nassembly had been breached and that they had been treated in a discriminatory\n\nmanner, the organizers of the demonstration in Warsaw began a court case against\n\nthe Republic of Poland at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.\n\nOUT.- 10.12.34\n\nIN.- 10.12.41 NARR.- On 3rd.

OUT.- 10.13.42\n\nIN.- 10.13.43 NARR.- A recent survey found 89 per cent of the Polish population\n\nstating that they consider homosexuality an “unnatural” activity which should not be\n\ntolerated. It’s unlikely that same sex marriages or civil unions will be endorsed in the\n\nnear future as Poland is 95 per cent Catholic, with 75 per cent actively practicing their\n\nreligion. OUT.- 10.14.04\n\nIN.- 10.14.08 On camera Piotr Switalski\n\nPermanent Representative of Poland\n\nat the European Council\n\nPoland is probably the only country in Europe where the attendance on\n\nSunday masses in churches has grown in recent years. Since we joined the\n\nEuropean Union the effect on the people is that more of them go to church, so that is\n\nthe opposite tendency if you compare Poland with some other Western European\n\ncountries where churches are empty on Sunday.

(ORIGINAL in Polish). OUT.- 10.16.09\n\nIN.- 10.16.14 On camera Greg Czarnecki\n\nCoordinator\n\nPolish Campaign Against Homophobia\n\n2004 in Krakow is when it really started, Krakow is a much more conservative and Catholic city actually than Warsaw, Warsaw is a bit more metropolitan, and that is when violence really started, when we had people really attacking us with rocks and they attacked us in the town square in Krakow they demolished the town square, they were throwing beer glasses and really demolishing the town square trying to attack us. OUT.- 10.16.39\n\nIN.- 10.16.42 On camera Tomasz Szypula\n\nGay Rigts Activist\n\nPoland\n\nWe decided to sit on the ground and we decided not to move and we said it’s our civil right, the right of assembly, and they can’t make us to stop it, so then the police used force they grab us from the ground and they took us to the police station where we were charged of taking part in an illegal gathering. Of course, it happened very fast and there was no time to think, I just decided, you know, if I’m there and if we have to change something that is the time to do it. OUT.- 10.17.22\n\nIN.- 10.17.22 On camera Robert Biedron\n\nPresident\n\nPolish Campaign Against Homophobia\n\nI have mixed feelings about how to treat stereotypes and prejudices of Polish people about gays and lesbians because on the one hand I know that is a new topic for Polish society and for them gay and lesbian people are something new, they were never faced and they were never forced to deal with them, so it’s like people from Mars who are coming suddenly on earth and asking here we are and accept us. I try to understand them, but on another hand we are members of their families, we grew up together with straight people, we were going to same schools, we were going to same churches. OUT.- 10.18.16\n\nIN.- 10.18.33 NARR.- The 47 member countries of the Council of Europe have agreed to accept and promote a common set of rights and freedoms.

OUT.- 10.18.52\n\nIN.- 10.18.55 On camera Thomas Hammarberg\n\nCommissioner for Human rights\n\nCouncil of Europe\n\nOf course there are different opinions in the various countries about whether they fully accept the agreed human rights standards or not, so that is an ongoing debate and that is where my office will have an importance because we are there to promote the agreed human rights even when they are opposed by governments or other groups in the society. If there is a clash between the individual and a group in society or large portions of a society it is important that the freedom of that individual is protected. We will continue our work parallel to the European Court of Human Rights in order to assist governments to introduce reforms which will make it unnecesary for people to appeal to the Court so the problems will be resolved at home.\n\nOUT.- 10.19.50\n\nIN.- 10.19.52 NARR.- Maybe in the near future all 47 member countries of the\n\nCouncil of Europe will be committed to the rule of law. The reality today is that in\n\nmany countries of the former Soviet Union the use of the judiciary system to settle\n\npolitical scores is still a major source of concern, and many people feel that their last\n\nresort for justice is the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.\n\nOUT.- 10.20.16\n\nIN.- 10.20.18 NARR.- 4th.

OUT.- 10.21.29\n\nIN.- 10.21.32 On camera Zurab Tchiaberashvili\n\nPermanent Representative of Georgia\n\nat the Council of Europe\n\nOf course, we have a lot of problems, we had and we still have some of them, it’s absolutely logical coming from Soviet Union you have the problem of not having experience of how democracy works, and the reason why we became members of the Council of Europe is to learn with our European partners how to build democratic, prosperous Georgia. OUT.- 10.22.08\n\nIN.- 10.22.09 NARR.- To help the Georgian government give credence to its\n\nRepeatedly stated good intentions and promises of reform, the Council of Europe\n\nand the Georgian government have launched a cooperation program to upgrade the\n\nprofessionalism of police officers. OUT.- 10.22.23\n\nIN.- 10.22.26 On camera Khatia Dekanoidze\n\nDirector, Police Academy\n\nTbilisi, Georgia\n\nWhat we do is we create the new face of the Georgian police officer so they\n\nlearn a lot of subjects; they learn administrative law, procedural codes, they learn how to behave, they learn human rights, they learn how to be good police officers to serve the people. And I can say the trust to the police among the people is about 75 per cent, and they trust police officers, they call them, they call 022, this is our kind of our 991, and they trust police officers and they know that they are there in urgent cases, they can every time call the police and Georgian police officers can help them.\n\nOUT.- 10.23.28\n\nIN.- 10.23.40 NARR.- Human rights organizations in Georgia have welcome the\n\nongoing efforts to upgrade the professionalism of police officers. And now the Council\n\nof Europe ‘s cooperation program with the Georgian government is addressing\n\ncorruption in the courts, with measures to remove corrupt judges and inject fresh\n\nblood into the judicial system.

They are realistic and that is why they decided to become judges, because for a lawyer being a judge is ultimate goal in most countries, because across the world the judges are the best and the brightest of the legal community. OUT.- 10.24.38\n\nIN.- 10.24.38 On camera Constantine Kublashvili\n\nChief Justice\n\nSupreme Court of Georgia\n\nI would say that not only in the judicial Chief Justice system but in all aspects of our country’s administrative system Georgia is in the hands of a new generation. And when it comes to our judicial system you now find young people looking for a new way to uphold rights and freedoms in a society that is going though a period of deep reforms. For example, here at the Supreme Court we have introduced reforms to ensure that this court is really a court of last resort, and all other decisions are taken by regional or local courts, we must bring the courts close to the people. Another result of our reform process is that young lawyers and the new young judges understand that the rule of law will work in our country only if all the members of the judicial system, play by the same rules, this means corruption is totally out of the picture or the system will not work. We must uphold the principles outlined for us by the Council of Europe. (ORIGINAL in Georgian).

OUT.- 10.26.19\n\nIN.- 10.26.27 NARR.- This is the place where parliamentarians from 47 countries,\n\nelected or appointed by national parliaments from among their own members, meet\n\nto exchange opinions and to seek consensus, and often all they manage is a\n\ncompromise, the basis of democracy. But critics accuse the Parliamentary Assembly\n\nof the Council of Europe of being just a talking shop with little power, other than\n\ndiplomatic pressure, to make member countries comply with its resolutions.\n\nOUT.- 10.26.55\n\nIN.- 10.26.56 On camera Luis Maria de Puig\n\nPresident, Parliamentary Assembly\n\nCouncil of Europe\n\nIf what you say was totally true, then we really need the Parliamentary Assembly, if\n\nthere are countries that don’t comply with our resolutions it’s then extremely\n\nnecessary to insist that they do so, and to produce resolutions that they will accept.\n\nHalf of the member countries of the Council of Europe had never known democracy, now they do but these are imperfect democracies, with problems that will take time to resolve. But no one can expect that any country can become a perfect democracy from one day to the next, it would be a pipe dream. It will take time for these countries to develop a culture of democracy, to completely accept the concept of human rights, it will take generations. (ORIGINAL in Spanish).

The destiny of Russia is in democratic Europe and together with democratic Europe, the point is just do not tell us how to do and how to work along this process, we’ll work along this process in our own way, but the aim and goal is definitely to be together with democratic Europe,.We choose our way but we go along this road how we think is useful and how it will be in the interest of our population. OUT.- 10.28.46\n\nIN.- 10.28.51 NARR.- In the new Russia the population wants more than they have –\n\nbetter living conditions, better clothes, better shoes, jewelery, luxuries. And for most\n\nyoung Russians human rights boils down to “live my life the way I want to.” To live\n\nnot their situations but their aspirations, and the new generation of Russian women\n\ndon't identify with Cinderella, patiently waiting for Prince Charming. They want to be\n\nPrince Charming. OUT.- 10.29.28\n\nIN.- 10.29.31 NARR.- Wherever you go in Russia you see the exploding advance\n\nof the consumer society, and Western style shopping malls are appearing\n\neverywhere.

And the power of new information technologies to help spread the human rights fever is clearly on display.

The attacks on homosexual marches by extreme nationalist groups, for example, would had been impossible for the Polish public to know about it in the past.

OUT.- 10.31.40\n\nIN.- 10.31.58 NARR.- Many young people in Poland claim the generation that grew up during the days of the cold war is tinted by fear and mistrust, and must make room for the new ideas that have emerged after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and which are still being shaped today. In post-Communist Poland, like in other Eastern European countries, there seems to be a generation gap.

When at first some of my friends didn’t know I’m a gay and I told them I’m in a relationship and they asked so what is the girl’s name and I said Krzys and they said ok that is fine as well so for my perspective is definitely normal.

OUT.- 10.34.50\n\nIN.- 10.34.52 On camera Seda Pumpyanskaya\n\nCommunication Director\n\nCouncil of Europe\n\nI think any organization dealing with human rights has to do campaigning,\n\ncampaignning for the promotion of human rights and the Council of Europe is an example of that. Let’s have a look here – death penalty, you all know that today we live in Europe as a death penalty freed zone, Council of Europe was a pioneer of this campaigning 30 years ago and today all the countries without exception have abolished death penalty.

I’ve worked here at the Council for over 20 years, and I’m still excited by the idealism of this organization, which stands for principles that have real meaning not only for the people who work here but for people throughout the European continent. OUT.- 10.36.38\n\nIN.- 10.36.38 On camera Seda Pumpyanskaya\n\nCommunication Director\n\nCouncil of Europe\n\nThe domestic violence campaign, until recent times it has been thought that it happens only in some places and neither the media nor the people were speaking about that, now we know that it doesn’t matter which country, North or South, East or West, developed country or not developed country that is a problem, Council of Europe launched a very powerful campaign against domestic violence and here are some of the examples with quite powerful images.

Police state, everyone informing on everyone, firing squads – makes a person secretive. It was unpatriotic and disruptive to question the workings of authority and the highest political level in the Soviet Union had a very special relationship with Georgia. And although the Russians left in 1991 economic growth was kept back by second-rate technology, poor transport, inefficient and corrupt managers. Finally in 2003 a battle cry emerged and called itself the Rose Revolution. Enough is enough, said Georgia, and took to the streets 100 000-strong to topple a corrupt government. Eduard Shevardnadze was forced to resign as the result of a peaceful revolution.

OUT.- 10.41.37\n\nIN.- 10.41.42 Giorgi Burduli Since we have started integrating into the European Union, into Western culture, I think the younger generation have loosen up their values they became more laid back, relaxed, they find more time for entertainment the older generation has not changed much.

OUT.- 10.43.29\n\nIN.- 10.43.30 NARR.- All the new democracies in Central and Eastern Europe will\n\nNeed long-term help meeting economic, legal, human rights and other challenges,\n\nbut its people deserve the chance to try. And leading the charge are young people\n\nwho have established hundreds of non-governmental organizations, also known as\n\nNGOs, addressing social, economic and human rights issues that the government\n\nonce insisted it could handle by itself.
