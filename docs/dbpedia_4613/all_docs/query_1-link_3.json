        "text": "LOST – SAVED\n\nMany pre-war Polish feature films remain missing. Those that were miraculously found - for instance in private collections - are often in such bad shape that running them through a classic projector would ensure their complete and irreversible damage. Thanks to the possibilities offered by digitization and time-lapse, frame-by-frame digital restoration, restored films can be seen today not only in cinemas or on DVD, but also on the Internet.\n\nFrame from the “Mania” movie from 1918, before the digital restoration, 1918, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\n,\n\nFrame from the “Mania” movie from 1918, after the digital restoration, 2011, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nOriginal film programme for “Pan Tadeusz” (1928), Wojciech Kossak, 1928, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nOriginal credits from the “Mania” movie, 1918, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nThe NITROFILM project, Filmoteka Narodowa (The National Film Archive) digitised 43 pre-war films made on a highly flammable nitro base and restored three silent productions: “Mania.

THREE STORIES\n\n“Mania. Story of a cigarette factory worker” from 1918 is a classic melodrama. The film tells a story of tragic love between a young woman and music composer - Hans, who writes an opera for his beloved one. Unfortunately he is unable to finalize the production because of the jealousy of another competitor to Mania’s hand. The girl does everything to help her lover to present his opera piece to the public. Her actions, however, eventually lead to tragedy.\n\nScene from the “Mania” movie, 1918, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\n,\n\nScene from the “Mania” movie, 1918, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nScene from the “Pan Tadeusz” movie, 1928, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nFilmed in 1928, “Pan Tadeusz” is an adaptation of an epos under the same title by Adam Mickiewicz. It is one of the most significant masterpieces in Polish literature. The film's premiere honoured the celebrations of the 10th anniversary of Polish independence. The plot corresponded with the sublime atmosphere of this anniversary: two conflicted Polish noble families unite when faced with the invasion of Russian troops. A great deal of well-known scenes from Polish history were portrayed in this film. In the end, love overcomes the differences – the engagement of the youngest members of both families brings hope for a peaceful and united future.\n\nScene from the “Pan Tadeusz” movie, 1928, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nIn “The Call of the Sea” from 1927 the leading theme is also one of love, but this time it is presented within the conventions of adventure and sensation. Stach enlists himself on a ship. He quickly wins the trust of the captain and the heart of his daughter – Jola. But once Stach returns to his hometown, he meets Hanka. Teenage love comes back to life. The girl however, must save the family fortune and marry a rich neighbour. Only when Stach is in danger, Hanka decides to follow her heart.\n\nScene from “The Call of the Sea” movie, 1927, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\n,\n\nScene from “The Call of the Sea” movie, 1927, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nIDOLS OF THE SCREEN, MASTERS OF THE STAGE\n\nThese three films are also important examples of changes in the method of expression, as they are important moments in the actors' careers.\n\nPola Negri on the cover of “Kino” magazine from 1931, 1931, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nAdmittedly “Mania” is a German film, however the leading role is played by the young polish actress, Apolonia Chałupiec, back then already known as Pola Negri. By 1917 she earned status of a star of silent cinema in Poland. The camera loved her. Negri had beauty, grace and a ballet background. She starred in eight Polish films. She mainly played femme fatale roles – for instance in “Wife” by Jan Pawlowski (1915) or in “Beast” by Aleksander Hertz (1917). When Negri ended her contract with the Polish label - Sfinks, she went abroad. Her career took off. “Mania” comes from the time when Negri performed in Germany. Altogether she starred in 20 films, directed mostly by Ernst Lubitsch. A few years later she went on to conquer Hollywood and gain worldwide fame, something that was never again accomplished by a Polish actor.\n\nAn excerpt of the original film stock of “Mania”, 1918, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nAn excerpt of the original film stock of “Mania”, 1918, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nThe performance in “Pan Tadeusz”, due to the significance of theme and the anniversary role of the film, involved only the most prominent theatre actors, even for brief roles. Stefan Jaracz, an icon of the theatre in Poland, played the small but very vital role of Napoleon Bonaparte. Some of the lead actors had rarely performed in films before. Mariusz Maszyński, who played the role of the Count, for a time avoided any contact with cinematography.\n\nNonetheless, among them were also some who saw an opportunity in cinema as an alternative to theatre. Antoni Bednarczyk, in the film - Maciek of the Macieks, was one of those professional theatre actors who contributed to breaking the moral barriers and general reluctance towards the new medium. In “Pan Tadeusz” there was not a single leading star. Today, this particular method seems to be the most interesting part of the film, because so many celebrities from the world of theatre could, at the time of the premiere, be a proof that the art of film begins to be equal to the art of theatre.\n\nScene from “Pan Tadeusz”, 1928, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nOn the other hand, “The Call of the Sea” was a film that had created and promoted the publics's favourite actors. The main roles of Hanka and Stach were performed by novice film actors: Maria Malicka and Jerzy Marr. Their careers soon accelerated.\n\nPostcard from “The Call of the Sea” movie, 1927, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nNora Ney in “The Call of the Sea”, 1927, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nNora Ney, who portrayed the character of Jola, was soon given the title of “Queen of the screen” by a weekly magazine “Cinema”.\n\nNora Ney on the cover of “Kino” magazine from 1933, 1933, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nTadeusz Fijewski in “The Call of the Sea”, 1927, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\n,\n\nTadeusz Fijewski in “The Doll”, Jerzy Troszczyński, 1968, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nThe curious part in the film was the performance of a teenage Tadeusz Fijewski. No one imagined back then that this was when the career of one of the most important Polish actors would begin. After the war, Fijewski starred in over 20 films revealing his enormous versatility of acting skills – he successfully portrayed diverse, comic and dramatic characters.\n\nBLOCKBUSTER, SUPERSTAR AND NATIONAL AFFAIRS\n\nDuring the production of \"Pan Tadeusz” it was clear from the very beginning that it was going to be the biggest event of its time in contemporary Polish cinema. The buzz around the film was caused mainly by three things. First of all, it was an attempt to transfer the national treasure of literature to a feature film – an epos by Adam Mickiewicz. Secondly, the production budget amounted to half a million zlotys (for comparison, at that time a car cost a few thousand only). Lastly, the film’s premiere was going to honour the celebration of the tenth anniversary of Poland's independence.\n\nOn the set of “Pan Tadeusz”, 1928, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nThe director himself - Ryszard Ordyński, was thrilling and anticipated by the audience. Educated in Germany, previously he had worked in the U.S., he was an organizer of theatrical life in Warsaw. Ordyński planned his film to be an attempt to revive the image of one of the most famous works of Adam Mickiewicz. The director wanted to show \"a certain type of people in a certain era, lazy in everyday life, as they roam next to cows and sheep, but at any moment ready to act hastily, impetuous, and when the need arrived- heroic”.\n\nSecond page of the film programme for “Pan Tadeusz”, 1928, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nWhereas “The Call of the Sea” was then advertised as the first Polish maritime film and thanks to the efforts and commitments of the creators parts of the film were shot on the Baltic Coast, in the authentic landscapes of Gdynia, Gdańsk and Puck. The scenes shot at high seas came out impressively and even a real seaplane was used for the scene in the final chase. The film was directed by Henryk Szaro, one of the most important pre-war directors. In years to come he was recognized for highly successful adaptations of Polish literature, including “The Story of Sin” by Stefan Żeromski and “A Strong Man” by Stanisław Przybyszewski. “The Call of the Sea” is the oldest surviving film in his directing.\n\nOn the set of “The Call of the Sea”, 1927, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nHenryk Szaro - pierwszy od lewej\n\nSecond page of the film programme for “The Call of the Sea”, 1927, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nPola Negri in “Mania”, 1918, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\n,\n\nThe name of Pola Negri in the original credits of “Mania”, 1918, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nThe participation of Pola Negri in “Mania” guaranteed the film’s immortality. From the moment the actress left her home country for good, Poles interested in cinema kept track of her international career with great interest. Negri herself kept very loose contact with Poland. Although shortly after the premiere of “Mania” she visited Krakow where she guest starred in the theatre, but no further announced visits ever came into effect. As well as her plan to pay Poland a visit in the 70s, although thoroughly prepared, for unknown reasons the visit never took place. No wonder that, although Negri remained important and close to hearts of the Polish audience, at the same time she was, in a sense, inaccessible. Precisely this inaccessibility has always escalated the interest of native scholars and moviegoers in the character of Pola Negri. It resulted in many books being written about her as well as hundreds of articles, and foreign silent films are still being admired mainly because of her.\n\nEACH FRAME WORTH ITS WEIGHT IN GOLD\n\nFilmoteka Narodowa (The National Film Archive) has probably the world's only preserved copy of “Mania” on the film on a nitrocellulose base. The copy is nearly complete; it lacks only the very endings of several scenes, which does not affect the reception of the film.\n\nFurther frames from “Mania”, 1918, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nFurther frames from “Mania”, 1918, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nAfter the war, “Pan Tadeusz” was known only in fragments. In 1955 Filmoteka Narodowa received a copy including an additional 40 minutes of recovered film. It was not even half of the original version, but it seemed that nothing more could have survived.\n\nReels of nitrocellulose film with the original “Pan Tadeusz”, Dominika Suder, 2009, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nAn unexpected breakthrough also occurred in 2006. Miss Agata Szkarłat from Wrocław called Filmoteka Narodowa with sensational news: amongst her family’s memorabilia she found 18 reels of films. Seeing subtitles and costumes on the copy she immediately assessed it was pre-war “Pan Tadeusz”. It turned out those were unknown fragments that complemented the copy kept by Filmoteka. Unfortunately, “Pan Tadeusz” was not yet complete, however the scale of this discovery was spectacular. Another 1012 meters of film accompanied the 1220 meters held by Filmoteka, so nearly twice as much!\n\nFurther frames from “Pan Tadeusz”, 2009, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nMany stills illustrating the missing scenes from “Pan Tadeusz” can be found in the archives of the Museum of Cinematography in Lodz. With those, one can get an idea of what is still missing in the film.\n\nUnique still from the missing scene from “Pan Tadeusz”, 1928, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nUnique still from the missing scene from “Pan Tadeusz”, 1928, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nFurther frames from “The Call of the Sea”, 1927, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\n,\n\nFurther frames from “The Call of the Sea”, 2013, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\n“The Call of the Sea” survived in two, incomplete copies which, when combined, make almost the entire film. Both copies, however, were in such poor technical condition that they could only be secured and stored. Presenting the film to the cinema audience was made possible only after digital restoration.\n\nPOLISHED TO SHINY PERFECTION\n\nThe surviving copy of “Mania” was characterized by damages typical of the oldest movies. Due to previous usage of the film, many intermittent, thick, oblong scratches emerged and the surface of the film became very dirty and deformed. As it would later turn out, the most burdensome damage for conservators were pieces of paper stuck to the film emulsion. It was impossible to assess what the initial purpose of it was. The paper, covering significant parts of the image, was previously removed. This treatment executed ​​in the past gave rise to new, additional scratches and defects in emulsion. At this stage, the only thing left to do was to remove the fragments of paper.\n\nExcerpt of the original nitro copy of “Mania”, before restoration, 2010, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nThe conservation and reconstruction of the film stock in the laboratory of the National Film Archive in Poland, Łukasz Gawroński, 2013, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nThe copy of “Pan Tadeusz” found in 2006 was also severely damaged. When it found its way to Filmoteka, it consisted of more than a hundred scraps of tape ranging from several to several hundreds of frames. Some of the fragments could be put together: they were matched accordingly to the shapes of ruptures and traces of splices . In other cases, conservators had to first examine scraps of film under a magnifying glass to identify actors and distinguish their roles, then to determine which of the stages from the plot was shown on each fragment and finally they could put the frames in the correct order.\n\n“Pan Tadeusz” before and after digital restoration, 2012, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nMotion picture film scanner, Łukasz Gawroński, 2013, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nAfter the conservation work, the films were scanned. First they were ‘dry’ scanned and then also ‘wet’ scanned. Behind these two terms are two different techniques. Dry scan means that the film’s image is scanned precisely and in detail, including all the defects in the nitrocellulose base and in the photosensitive emulsion. The result is a sharp, high-definition scanned image, but unfortunately with lots of minor scratches.\n\n“Pan Tadeusz” before and after digital restoration, 2012, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\n“The Call of the Sea” before and after digital restoration, 2013, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nThis is how we get a digital copy in high, 4K resolution. It is an exact copy of the original carrier. We can then proceed to the second type of scanning, with the use of an immersion liquid. During this procedure, the film is submerged in the liquid. The liquid’s purpose is to fill any minor cracks and scratches in the film base and in the film emulsion so that the damage is less visible. This is the stage when we begin restoring the film image in high, 4K resolution. This method is so far the only effective mean for restoring scratches. Subsequently, treatments with the use of digital reconstruction techniques and with the participation of a team of specialists are implemented, that is time-lapse, frame-by-frame image retouching.\n\n“The Call of the Sea” before and after digital restoration, 2013, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\n“Mania” before and after digital restoration, 2011, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nGREAT COMEBACK!\n\nThe grand finale of the restoration process of these three titles was their splendid re-premieres in film theatres. Music for each of the films was written and composed specially for the occasion and performed live at the events. Music for “Mania”, the film that re-premiered on 4th September 2011 at the National Philharmonic, was written and conducted by a renowned composer - Jerzy Maksymiuk.\n\nCurrent poster of “Mania” announcing the re-premiere of the movie in London, 2011, From the collection of: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nThe following shows of “Mania” took place in five European capitals - Paris, London, Madrid, Kiev and Berlin.
