        "text": "He was born on Oct. 14, 1864, in the village of Strawczyn, about 20 kilometers from Kielce (at that time a part of partitioned Poland under Russian occupation).\n\nHis father, a nobleman (who lost his estate before the January Uprising) was a leaseholder of farms in the Kielce region. So, Stefan spent his childhood at one of those farms ‒ in the village of Ciekoty with a scenic view of the Swietokrzyskie Mountains. His mother introduced him to Polish patriotic literature. Her death in 1879 was a shock for Stefan (he often wrote about her in his journal).\n\nSince 1874, Stefan attended a gymnasium in Kielce. At that time, he started to write his first poems and dramas. In 1882, his translation of a poem by the Russian poet Lermontov was published in a local press, as well as his own poem âPiosenka rolnikaâ (A Peasantâs Song).\n\nIn 1883, his father died. Because of financial difficulties Stefan tried to support himself by offering private tutoring. He contracted tuberculosis. Therefore, Stefan, even without a high school certificate of graduation, decided to move to Warsaw. There he continued his education at the Veterinary Institute for two years, still supporting himself by private tutoring.\n\nSince 1888 Stefan was employed as a private tutor of noblemenâs children in the Podlasie region. It was during this time of intensive cooperation with the periodicals: Tygodnik Powszechny, Glos, Nowa Reforma that he published his early literary works. But it was also the time of his romances (with daughters of local nobles or their wives).\n\nIn 1890, he got a job in Naleczow, famous for a fashionable spa, where he met Oktawia Rodkiewicz nee Radziwiłłowicz, an older widow, whom he married. Thanks to her connections and support of Boleslaw Prus (who was also in love with Oktawia) Zeromski was offered a job as a librarian in the Polish Library in Rapperswil, Switzerland. There he wrote a novel âSyzyfowe praceâ (Labors of Sisyphus) published in 1897.\n\nAfter five years in Switzerland, he returned to Warsaw, where he worked till 1904 as a library assistant at the Zamoyski Library. In 1899, his son â Adam was born and a novel âLudzie bezdomniâ (Homeless People) was published. Those early novels, as well as his short stories, described a misery of life in partitioned Poland. Zeromskiâs novel âPopiolyâ (Ashes, 1904), brought him recognition and financial independence, so he could focus on literary works. In 1904, the Zeromski family moved for a year to Zakopane and then to Naleczow, where a highlander-style house was built for them.\n\nZeromskiâs writing was accompanied by his social welfare activity. In his house an orphanage for poor children and an underground Polish school were run, with the great help of his wife. It was also Oktawia, who saved his manuscripts of his literary works, when the Russian censorship confiscated them. But during their trip to France in 1909 Żeromski met a young painter Anna Zawadzka, with whom he had a romance, and four years later married her. His first wife Octawia suffered from mental illness, which increased after the death of her son Adam Żeromski (in 1918).\n\nZeromskiâs novel âDzieje\n\ngrzechuâ (Story of a Sin, 1908), a\n\nplay âRÃ³żaâ (The Rose, 1909), a historic\n\ndrama âSułkowskiâ (1910), a\n\nnovel âWierna rzekaâ(The Faithful\n\nRiver, 1912) or the trilogy: âWalka z\n\nSzatanemâ (Struggle with Satan),\n\nâNawracanie Judaszaâ (Converting\n\nJudas), âZamiećâ (Blizzard) brought\n\nenormous popularity to his literary\n\nworks, placing him high in the Polish\n\nwriterâs âParnassusâ.\n\nAfter the outbreak of WWI he unsuccessfully tried to join the Pilsudski Legions. He was a leading activist in the patriotic movement establishing the Republic of Zakopane in 1918, as a part of the Polish national struggle to restitute the independent Poland. After the war he settled with his new family in Warsaw. He bought a house in Konstancin. In 1924, Żeromski got an apartment in the Royal Castle in Warsaw from the president of Poland as an appreciation for his literary works.\n\nThe collection of stories about\n\nthe history of the Polish coastal region\n\nâWiatr od morzaâ (Wind from\n\nthe Sea, 1922) brought Żeromski\n\nthe Polish State Literary Award\n\n(1925), but was strongly criticized\n\nby German opinion, and lowered his\n\nchance for the Nobel Prize. The last\n\nfamous novel by Żeromski\n\nâPrzedwiośnieâ (The Spring to\n\nCome, 1924) triggered a wide discussion\n\nabout the illusion of value\n\nof a struggle for independence,\n\nabout social inequality and revolution.\n\nStefan Żeromski died on Nov.\n\n20, 1925, in Warsaw.\n\nAt the time, the PRL literary works of Zeromski became a strong part of propaganda for âsocial justiceâ. Many of his woks were adapted by the film industry: âSyzyfowe praceâ (dir. Pawel Komorowski, 2000), âPopiolyâ (dir. Andrzej Wajda, 1965), âWierna rzekaâ (dir. Edward Puchalski, 1923, and in 1983 â dir. Tadeusz Chmielewski), âDzieje grzechuâ (dir. Henryk Szaro, 1933, and in 1975 â dir. Walerian Borowczyk), âPrzedwiosnieâ (dir. Henryk Szaro, 1929, and dir. Filip Bajon, 2000). There is a Stefan Zeromski museum of in Naleczow (see: www.muzeumlubelskie.pl), in Kielce, and in Ciekoty."
