Ballet The Story of Sin will be staged at the Castle Opera in Szczecin on 6 and 7 April 2019.

Can a woman's love make her hit rock bottom? Can she save her dignity in a world dominated by men? The ballet based on Stefan Żeromski's novel of the same title was also inspired by Walerian Borowczyk's movie, considered to be one of the greatest scandals of Polish cinema. It is not only a story of a passionate woman isolated in a man's world, but also an encounter with the late Romantic music of Mieczysław Karłowicz.

The Orchestra of the Castle Opera in Szczecin under the direction of Jerzy Wołosiuk along with the soloists Joanna Tylkowska-Drożdż and Paweł Wolski will perform Karłowicz's works: Song for voice and orchestra Op. 1 No. 5 I remember the quiet, bright, golden days, Symphonic Poems Op. 9 Returning Waves and Op. 13 A Sorrowful Tale, Song for two voices and orchestra Op. 3 No. 1 Keep talkingto me, the first part of the Symphony "Rebirth", and Lithuanian Rhapsody.
