Introduction by curator Daniel Bird on April 5

Based on the novel by Stefan &Zdot;eromski, Story of Sin is Borowczyk’s singular Polish feature film. Gra&zdot;yna D&lstrok;ugo&lstrok;&eogon;cka plays Ewa Pobratyńska, the doomed heroine whose passion for a married anthropology student takes her on a perilous journey across early-20th-century Europe. Casting a critical eye on the hypocrisy of the Catholic Church, Story of Sin counts as Borowczyk’s most passionate film, a delirious melodrama that reaches an ecstatic pitch. Nominated for the Palme d’Or at Cannes. Note: contains explicit sexual content.
