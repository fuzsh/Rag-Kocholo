        "meta_description": "Byron âLeroyâ Cook  1938-2018  Byron Leroy Cook, 79 of Edmond, left this earth peacefully surrounded by his family on November 17, 2018. Leroy was born December 3, 1938 to Herman Ray Cook Sr. and Maggie Evelyn Herrold in Luther, Oklahoma. Leroy graduated from Luther High School in 1957 and attended Oklahoma A&M on a baseball scholarship that fall. He met the love of his life, Karen Judkins at a dance in Harrah on December 31, 1957 and the rest is history. They married on August 2, 1958 and made their home in Luther for the next fifty plus years. Leroy worked at EMSCO Electric Supply Company for 45 years. In 1959, he started in the warehouse stocking shelves and filling orders, rising to become their top salesman for many years and later serving as Vice-President of the company. He was very active in the Luther community; serving as president on the Luther School Board, Luther Town Council, Luther Lions Club, and was a Luther Jaycee. Leroy was a 32nd Degree Master Mason and a member of the Wellston Masonic Lodge. Leroy is survived by his wife Karen, daughter Lisa Rondina and husband Gary, son Kevin Cook and wife Tammy, grandchildren Tiffany Grant-Evans and husband Brett, Tara Grant, Kory Cook and wife Lakan, Taylor Grant, Ryan Rondina, Cody Smith, great grandchildren Rowan and Sloane Cook, Olivia Rondina, brother Ron Cook and wife Paulette, sister-in-laws Coleen Cook and Carlee Cook and numerous nieces and nephews. He is preceded in death by his mother and father, brothers Herman Jr., Wayne and Jimmy and his granddaughter Ali Cook-Smith. Throughout his life Leroy enjoyed many things including spending time at the lake running trot lines, teaching his kids and friendsâ kids to ski, hunting, playing cards, dancing, playing golf, OU football, helping the local kids with their 4-H & FFA livestock projects and traveling with Karen in their RV. Most of all Leroy enjoyed spending time with his family and friends enjoying a good laugh. Leroy was a member, Elder, and active supporter of the First Christian Church of Luther for most of his adult life. He especially enjoyed working with the youth groups, serving on the board, and singing in the choir. For almost 40 years Leroy was widely respected as a friend of Bill W. and traveled the state providing support to those in need. Leroy owned land north of Luther and spent countless hours with his family and some of the local high school boys doing all of the things that raising cattle involves. When Leroyâs children and even grandchildren were in school, his house was a place to gather and where you were always welcome. It was because of his care and sometimes-tough love, that many of the local youth grew up to be responsible, caring adults. He was like a second father and grandfather for many Luther kids, his legacy spans multiple generations. Funeral services will be held Wednesday, November 21st at 11:00 a.m. at the First Christian Church in Luther, Oklahoma. Interment to follow at Luther Cemetery. In lieu of flowers, Leroyâs family requests donations be made to the Alzheimerâs Association, Oklahoma Chapter. www.alz.org/oklahoma. PaPa, give our âSugar Bearâ Ali a hug & a kiss. We love you.",
