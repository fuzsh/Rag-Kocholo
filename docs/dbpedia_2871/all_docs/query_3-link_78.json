        "text": "“My time as a student was spent in an environment that prioritized learning, provided by knowledgeable and available professors who gave us the tools to grow as young professionals. Each course taken in my time has been one that has served me well, and in turn, it has served the students that I work with every day.”\n\nEmma Preble Cook, ELA Teacher\n\nClass of 2018\n\n“My English degree helped me develop as a well-rounded professional who has an appreciation for many different areas of interest and created an ability to have discussions and critical conversations about a multitude of subjects in our interconnected world.”\n\nKorey Erickson, MLS, MS\n\nLibrary Coordinator; Teaching Fellow, Class of 2008 & 2012\n\n“I think studying literature is significant for anyone because it is a subject that at once teaches practical skills that are useful in everyday life and in any given job, such as critical thinking and clear expression in writing, and it makes us unfold as humans because it teaches us empathy, to be open to new ideas we might otherwise have never considered, and to keep asking more and better questions. The professors at UJ and the courses offered allowed me to do all that.”\n\nLinda Hess, PhD\n\nSenior Lecturer, Class of 2007\n\n“The education I received through UJ’s English and biology departments continues to support my professional life. I’m now a Clinical Quality Consultant with a podcast about literature – neither of which would be possible without the teachers at UJ.”\n\nLaura Sieling-Gaylord\n\nManager, GCP QA Consultant, Class of 2016\n\n“An undergraduate degree in English is a solid foundation for the practice of law. An English major develops clear and concise writing, as well as critical and considered reading, and both skills are used daily in understanding and interpreting the law.”\n\nAllison Woodbury, JD\n\nShareholder, Fredrikson & Byron, P.A., Class of 2000\n\n“The communication and writing skills I learned are an invaluable skill in my role as a cybersecurity professional. Outside of work, I have also been able to leverage my English background to write and publish fantasy adventure novels, which has been one of the great enjoyments of my life.”\n\nWilliam Heinzen\n\nInformation Security Team Lead; Author; Class of 2010"
