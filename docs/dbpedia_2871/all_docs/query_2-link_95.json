        "text": "We look forward to welcoming guests at the Alan Turing Lecture 2024 titled 'AI and Political Responsibility' given by Professor Jude Browne, on Friday, 3rd May at 5.00pm.\n\nDue to capacity being reached to attend the lecture in person registration has now closed, but all are welcome to join the event online via Zoom. The talk will also be recorded and made available on the College website.\n\nProfessor Jude Browne is a Professorial Fellow of King’s College, the Head of the Department of Politics and International Studies at Cambridge and the Jessica and Peter Frankopan Director of the University of Cambridge Centre for Gender Studies. She is also Associate Fellow of the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence. Her current research focuses on political responsibility, the public interest, feminist theory and structural injustice and the impact of technology on society. Her lecture will draw on her forthcoming book Political Responsibility and Tech Governance: AI, Repro-tech and Structural Injustice (Cambridge University Press).\n\nAI and Political Responsibility: Not a day goes by without a new story on the threats of increasingly clever machines that surpass human capability, comprehension and control. How can we respond? What should we do politically? Jude Browne questions who has political responsibility for the structural impacts of these technologies and how we might think about preparing for the far-reaching societal changes they are set to bring.\n\nThe Alan Turing Lecture, launched in 2017, is given by a leading authority from a key discipline on which Turing's work has had greatest impact. This event has become a highlight in the intellectual and social calendar of the College.\n\nProgramme\n\nThe Alan Turing Lecture is part of a daytime event programme, starting at 2.00pm, that all registered guests are welcome to join.\n\n2.00 - 3.15pm: Alan Turing Archives Exhibition, Audit Room\n\nThe papers of Alan Turing have been assembled at King’s College since 1960 when his mother made the first presentation. Whilst his work at Bletchley Park is not well represented (any surviving papers would probably be in The National Archives), the King’s collection has scores of his letters, photographs, reprints (including the Computer Science foundation document on the Entscheidungsproblem), and evidence of his work on artificial intelligence and morphogenesis. Specimens of all will be included in the exhibition.\n\n3.30 - 4.15pm: Computer Science Research Discussion, Keynes Hall\n\nThe discussion, hosted by King’s Fellow Dr Apinan Hasthanasombat, is themed around ethics in Computer Science, broadly interpreted. Talking to graduate students, Ceren, Tina and Alex, whose work touches on AI ethics, privacy, and cyber-criminal forums, the discussion aims to look forward and explore some implications of emerging technology to wider society. To learn more about our panel please read their research profiles here.\n\n4.15 - 4.45pm: Refreshment Break, Chetwynd Room\n\n5.00 - 6.30pm: Alan Turing Lecture ‘AI and Political Responsibility’ by Professor Jude Browne\n\nThe lecture will last approximately one hour followed by audience Q&A.\n\n* If you would like to watch the Alan Turing Lecture online please register via Zoom\n\n6.30 - 7.15pm: Drinks Reception, Chetwynd Room\n\nGeneral Information\n\nUpon arrival at the College please let the member of staff on gate know you are attending the Alan Turing Lecture.\n\nThe Archives Exhibition, open from 2.00-3.15pm will be held in the Audit Room, all other event activities will be in the Chetwynd Room and Keynes Hall. See event map.\n\nThe College is unable to offer parking.\n\nDue to limited capacity in the Keynes Hall for the Alan Turing Lecture, only registered guests will be permitted to enter. Please have your Ticket Tailor confirmation available.\n\nPlease take your seat by 4.55pm so that anyone on standby can be offered available spaces.\n\nThe suggested dress code for the event is smart casual.\n\nIf you can no longer attend the event please cancel your ticket on Ticket Tailor or email: events@kings.cam.ac.uk so that your ticket can be offered to the waiting list.\n\nPrevious Alan Turing Lectures\n\nAlan Turing Lecture 2023 'The Entscheidungsproblem, revisited.' by Professor Byron Cook, Professor of Computer Science at University College London (UCL) and VP/Distinguished Scientist at Amazon Web Services.\n\nAlan Turing Lecture 2022 'Charting the Horizons of Artificial Intelligence Research’ by Dr Raia Hadsell, Director of Robotics, Deepmind\n\n2021 Digital Alan Turing Event\n\nAlan Turing Lecture 2021 'Modelling Pattern Formation in Developmental Biology' by Professor Philip Maini FRS, University of Oxford\n\n'Bringing the Polish Cyclometer back to life', with Dr Tim Flack and Hal Evans"
