At Amazon, we have recently seen tremendous adoption of the approach by product groups, with a variety of customer-facing launches that use automated reasoning, and numerous internal proof projects. This talk describes those projects, and tries to explain what went well at Amazon. The talk also describes challenges that we face to scale the approach to the next level.\n\nSHORT BIO:"
