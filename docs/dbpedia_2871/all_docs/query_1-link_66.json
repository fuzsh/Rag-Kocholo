        "text": "Michael Diaz de Leon hung up his apron as executive chef at Brutø in December, leaving big shoes to fill. But “Top Chef” alum Byron Gomez is ready to step up to the Michelin-starred plate.\n\nGomez has been named as the new executive chef of Brutø, Denver restaurateur Kelly Whitaker’s 18-seat chef’s counter restaurant at 1801 Blake St. He’ll take over in March, and his first seasonal, 11-course menu will be inspired by his experience at other Michelin-starred restaurants, as well as his upbringing in Costa Rica, according to a statement from Whitaker’s Id Est Hospitality.\n\n“I first stepped into Brutø as a guest chef back in 2021 and was in awe of the entire Id Est’s united focus and devotion to sustainability,” Gomez said in a press statement. “When the opportunity to take over Brutø arose it was an immediate ‘yes’ from me…”\n\nAfter transforming Brutø into one of just five Michelin-starred restaurants in the state, as well as earning a Michelin sustainability award and a 2023 James Beard nomination, Diaz de Leon left in December to pursue his dream of opening his own restaurant. Whitaker, who also owns Michelin-starred The Wolf’s Tailor, Basta and Hey Kiddo, was recently nominated for a 2024 James Beard Award for “Outstanding Restaurateur.”\n\nGomez will maintain the restaurant’s zero-waste kitchen philosophy, utilizing heirloom grains from Dry Storage, Whitaker’s grain company, and integrate house-fermented and dehydrated ingredients when crafting the dishes.\n\nGomez grew up in Costa Rica, moving to Long Island, in New York, with his family when he was eight years old. His first job was at Burger King at age 15, and despite the lack of any formal training as a chef, Gomez moved up and onward in the restaurant industry. He eventually landed roles at Michelin-starred restaurants, such as Café Boulud, Atera and Eleven Madison Park.\n\nIn 2019, Gomez moved to Aspen and began working for the fine-dining restaurant 7908. He appeared on “Top Chef: Portland” in 2021, but was eliminated after episode 10. After his TV appearance, he moved to Boulder and opened his own Costa Rican-inspired food stall dubbed Pollo Tico in Avanti Boulder, which has since closed.\n\nSubscribe to our new food newsletter, Stuffed, to get Denver food and drink news sent straight to your inbox."
