        "text": "The University of St. Thomas Law Journal is the School of Law’s flagship law review. It seeks to embody the school’s unique mission by publishing excellent legal scholarship that promotes ethical actions, the integration of faith and reason and social justice. The law journal’s Latin subtitle Fides et Iustitia, which translates into “faith and justice,” is a core foundation of the works it publishes and the symposia it hosts each year.\n\nThe law journal is a symposium-based journal. It offers two to three symposia each year and asks presenters to write an article or essay based on the symposium topic, their own experiences, and the discussion they take part in at the symposium. This promotes meaningful exploration of a current legal issue, and allows substantial collaboration between law review, our faculty and outside contributors. Symposia also give the law school community a chance to reflect on issues closely connected with the mission and vision of the School of Law. The journal also accepts unsolicited notes, comments or articles.\n\nSince the Spring of 2017, the law journal has been an online-only publication. All published works are available at no cost in Research Online or on Westlaw, HeinOnline and LexisNexis."
