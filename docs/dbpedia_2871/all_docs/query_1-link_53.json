        "text": "On Tuesday, during Tim Walz’s debut speech as Kamala Harris’s running mate, he thanked Harris for “bringing back the joy.”\n\nIt wasn’t until then that I fully realized just how much joy has been generating the electricity behind Harris’s presidential candidacy. Not because of some specific stance that Harris has taken — she isn’t articulating policy positions that differ substantially from President Biden’s. She is, however, allowing herself to be the vessel for pent-up liberal energy.\n\nI underestimated how much soul damage Democratic voters had suffered over the past three and a half years — not in the main because of the Biden administration, but because of the seemingly endless culture wars — and how that damage had jelled into a form of electoral depression."
