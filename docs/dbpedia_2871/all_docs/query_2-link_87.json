        "text": "Today’s interviewee is Cook coach Byron Slack, whose team defeated seventh-ranked Fitzgerald 14-7 last week to move into first place in Region 1-2A. Slack became Cook’s coach in 2022, when the Hornets had not had a winning season since 2015. Cook is 7-2 this season after an 8-4 finish in 2022. Cook had five victories declared forfeits earlier this month by the GHSA, which cited an ineligible player. On Friday, hours before the Fitzgerald game, a Superior Court judge issued an injunction to restore the victories temporarily. The GHSA has not commented publicly on how it will proceed. With no forfeits, Cook is the region champion. If the forfeits are restored, Cook can clinch a playoff berth with a victory over Worth County on Friday. Cook has not missed the playoffs since 1999.\n\n1. What was the game's single biggest play? How did it unfold? “I think the fourth-down stop at around Fitzgerald's 27-yard line early in the game set the tone. It was a short-yardage call that we run in those situations, but Jakori Jones gave superhuman effort on the play and was in the backfield before the running back could take a step forward. It gave our kids confidence. To do that against such a physical team that prides itself on being great in those situations gave us a mental boost.”\n\n2. What was the key to the game in general? How was your game plan? “To endure. They are a great football team. We played some kids up front and tried to have a grouping where we could match their size as best as we could. We knew it was going to be a slugfest, and we just preached to our kids to keep swinging.”\n\n3. How has the GHSA case affected the team? What's been the mindset through it all, from the initial reaction of the GHSA's decision to Friday's court ruling? “The situation in our program over the past weeks has brought us closer as a staff and as a team. I have never been prouder to be associated with a group of kids. When we got the news last Friday [Oct. 20 announcing the five forfeits] it would have been easy for them to not perform and fall short. And I don't think anyone would have blamed them. But they went out and played a great game versus Dodge County [and won 27-7]. The kids and their families have represented Cook County with dignity and class throughout the process, and the way they played is a testament to their upbringing.”"
