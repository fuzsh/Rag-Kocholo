        "text": "The Cook District was started in 1842, and the first log school house was built on a knoll, north of the present school. It was built by Orson Cook, who gave a ½ acres of ground to the district for a school, a portion of his farm. The drinking water for the school had to be carried from a spring, 40 rods east of the school. Also, one tin cup was used by all the children.\n\nIn this school they had home-made seats, a slag of wood for the desk, and about six inches underneath another slab of wood to put their books on. Slates were used to write on and the blackboard.\n\nToday, Mr. Clifford Blain lives on the place of Mr. O. Cook, and near his place is, what was then a creek with the spring in 1842, made into a pond.\n\nThe first teacher, James Pelton, taught in 1842, in this school. The children who attended there were: Ellen Blain, Oscar Blain and Mrs. (Helen Blain) Platt, Anna Fox, Martin Cook, Josephine Cook, Ira Cook, (son of Orson Cook) and Ester Hand.\n\nThey studied the A.B.C.s, reading, writing, arithmetic and spelling. There was a chart like a map, and on these pages were the alphabet and words, as each page was thoroughly studied, then they would study the pages backwards. When these were thoroughly learned the pupils would start in the first primary reader and so on until all the books were studied that were allotted to the school.\n\nAfter several years of schooling in this building, the roof gave way and the school was disbanded. The children had to walk one and a half miles west to another school. Then that school was closed, and the children in that territory walked to what is known today as \"Ross School\". On account of the densely populated forest, infested with wild animals and no roads, just self made trails, the parents did not want their children so far from home, therefore, the people in the Cook District decided to replace the old log school.\n\nThe school house was torn down and the second one was built on the same knoll. This school was built of wood, sheeted and sided. About 40 feet back of the school the woodshed was built, and from here the boys had to carry the wood through the front of the school. One day the boys decided it was too far, so what did they do but chop a hole in the back of the school house, and put a board in front of the hole when they finished letting in the wood.\n\nThe last teacher who taught in the second school on the knoll was Clara Chisler of Caledonia, Michigan. Her folks would bring her in on Monday mornings, with horse and buggy and come back on Fridays for her. Mrs. E. Racket remembers her Aunt Ellen Blain, who also was a teacher at one time, boarded the teachers. The teachers pay was about $20.00 a month and the highest they paid Mrs. Blain for board was $2.00 a week. When Aunt Ellen taught at Cook School an old oak stove was used. Also, factory made double seats were better than the home made ones, and later years, these were replaced with single seats. They had very few library books, a glove and a dictionary.\n\nAs the children advanced in their studies, they would have history, physiology, language, grammar, Civil Government, first Michigan Government, then Federal Government.\n\nThis building stood until 1892, when the ground of that site was traded for ½ acre south on the corner of Easter Avenue and 84th Street. The one-room building was constructed by Orville Riggs. This was the third building.\n\nThe first teacher to teach here was Jon Luniceky. He was a very strict teacher, however, the children knew their lessons under his jurisdiction, and all dearly loved him.\n\nIn 1898 a large tile was placed over the spring with a cover over the top to keep the snakes, frogs, etc., from coming near the spring. The water had to be carried about 40 feet from the north side of the school.\n\nBefore 1890, if the children did not learn their lessons good, a note would be sent home to the parents. In 1890, grades were put in effect. The teacher had to buy the report cards which made it a better system.\n\nThen in 1916, over-crowded conditions compelled them to add the room to the north, making it a two-room school. When the north side was added a complete basement was put under the new addition. At that time the water was piped in, and drinking fountains were put in. Instead of the tin cup, or later years each scholar had their folding cup, they had wax cups.\n\nThe two teachers who were hired in 1916 were Anna Cuddihy and Iva Warner. They had approximately 60 pupils at that time, and taught all eight grades.\n\nToday its the same two-room school, somewhat remodeled. The teachers are Mrs. Montgomery, teaches the second and third grades, she has at the present time 34 pupils and Mrs. Bussa teacher the Kindergarten and first grades, in her class at present there are 28 pupils.\n\nMrs. Bussa relates that in 1943, each room had a large floor furnace, and the children would bring potatoes. At recess they would place the potatoes on top of the furnace, so that by noon they had baked potatoes. Sometimes they would have a complete dinner. Today they have oil heat."
