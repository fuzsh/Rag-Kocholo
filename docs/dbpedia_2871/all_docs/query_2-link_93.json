        "text": "BYRON — A memorial service for Mark S. Cook will be at 11 a.m. Saturday at Christ Lutheran Church in Byron, with the Rev. David Rossow officiating.\n\nMr. Cook, 56, of Byron, died Sunday (Jan. 4, 2009) at his home, of complications from multiple sclerosis.\n\nMark Steven Cook was born Feb. 7, 1952, in Jacksonville, Fla. He came to Rochester at age 3, grew up in Rochester, and graduated from Mayo High School in 1970. He joined the Air Force and served four years as a marksman. Following his service, he went to Mankato State College and graduated with a degree in accounting. While in college he served as a veterans representative for the military. On Sept. 8, 1979, he married Gail Rosencrants in Rochester.\n\nMr. Cook went to work as a postal carrier for the Post Office in Rochester, retiring after 25 years of service. He was a member of Christ Lutheran Church and the Byron American Legion, and served 19 years with the Byron Volunteer Fire Department. He enjoyed woodworking and was a die-hard Vikings fan.\n\nHe is survived by his wife; three sons, Justin, Christopher and Teddy, all of Byron; his parents, Harold \"Mac\" and Marge Macmullen of Apache Junction, Ariz.; a brother, Patrick (Jo) of La Crosse, Wis.; and a stepsister, Nancy Albright of Arizona.\n\nVisitation will be from 10 a.m. until the time of the service Saturday at the church. The Byron American Legion will provide military honors.\n\nMemorials are requested to a charity of the donor’s choice.\n\nRanfranz & Vine Funeral Homes of Rochester is handling arrangements."
