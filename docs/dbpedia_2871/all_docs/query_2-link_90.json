        "text": "Ronald Eugene Byron was born on May 5, 1941 and raised on a farm outside of Remington, Indiana. He was the oldest son of Tom and Blanche Byron. Two years later, his baby brother Robert was born. Ron affectionately called his brother “Sam”. The boys had a wonderful life growing up on the farm. Ron loved telling stories about their childhood escapades.\n\nRon attended a country school, Gilboa, for 11 years, where he had just 5 classmates. He left Gilboa right before his senior year to attend the big Remington High School with a class of 45 students… 9 times bigger!\n\nAfter graduation, he studied to become an x-ray technician. He very quickly changed his mind and enrolled at Indiana University. After one year in the dorm, he felt like he could contribute more by joining Theta Chi Fraternity where many of his brothers became lifelong friends.\n\nRon never seemed to get too excited. He reasoned, explained, and of course, got his way. Naturally, he soon became the president of the fraternity. Family and roots were his highest priority, and in the following two years, he got four more Remington boys in the fraternity. Yes, one was his little brother.\n\nAlthough he suffered his entire life with double curvature of the spine, he was a talented basketball and baseball player. He had great hands and quick reflexes. He continued to play basketball and softball through city rec far into adulthood.\n\nAfter graduating from Indiana University, Ron moved to Appleton, WI, where he became a die-hard fan of the Green Bay Packers. He began to work for the American Can company as a sales executive. He transferred with this company to New York City, and later to Boise, ID. This company changed ownership many times, but he remained with the company throughout his 35-year career.\n\nHe loved Boise immediately. Sports, motorcycle riding, hunting, and camping were some of his favorite activities. At that time, he was only missing one thing. Ron married Cheryl in 1973 in a secret and exciting elopement in Reno, NV. Together, they raised their two children: Christy and Kevin. The family enjoyed camping and skiing together. Ron and Cheryl loved to travel. Each year, they traveled to various parts of the world with dear friends. They went on incredible journeys to places like China, Jamaica, Mexico, and Canada - as well as various places throughout the US. They loved camping in the Idaho mountains, and continued camping even after the kids were grown. After they gave up skiing, they took up snowmobiling in the winter, and golf in the summer. Ron retired in 1997. He and Cheryl became snow birds together after they retired. They eventually bought a home in Arizona where they split their time between Queen Creek and Meridian. They enjoyed their lives with family and friends in both states.\n\nRon was a fabulous cook and loved barbequing for friends and family. He was an avid reader and enjoyed novels about politics, history, mystery and westerns; as well as non-fiction books about people and places. He loved sitting on his patio in the evening - watching the sunset or spending time with family around the fire pit.\n\nRon’s loving family consists of two children: his son, Kevin Climer, and his daughter, Christy Pletcher. Kevin and his wife, Rocksy, gave Ron and Cheryl 4 grandchildren: Kyle Climer and his wife, Madison; MaKaylee Howard and her husband, Matt; Shaniah Zenor and her husband, Jantzen; and Tycie Climer who recently graduated high school. Christy and her husband, Michael, gave them 4 loving grandchildren as well: Amy Gajda and her husband, Jeff; Parker Pletcher, Tyler Pletcher, and Rachel Pletcher who is a senior at the College of Idaho.\n\nThey also have 7 great grandchildren: Gracie and Buck Howard, Kaschton Climer, Hadlyn Howard, Oaklee Goodwin, Frannie Gajda, and Ariyon Parker Pletcher.\n\nRon’s brother is Bob Byron. Bob and his wife, Claudia, gave them 3 wonderful nephews: Tom Byron and his wife Jeannie, Mike Byron and his wife, Karen, and Steve Byron with his wife, Laura, who all have loving families.\n\nRon has many close cousins with whom he kept in contact over the years. He adored and was adored by all of them.\n\nRon was preceded in death by his parents, Tom and Blanche Byron; his sister in law, Peggy Heeb; his son, Kevin Climer; and his grandson, Parker Pletcher.\n\nRon Byron passed away on September 4, 2023. The celebration of his life will be on Sunday, September 10, 2023, at the Cloverdale Funeral Home at 11:00am. Reception will follow. In lieu of flowers, memorials can be made to his favorite charity, the Wounded Warrior Fund."
