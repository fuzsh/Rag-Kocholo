        "text": "Weâ€™re dedicated to empowering schools nationwide with the tools, training, resources, and funding they need to serve meals. Browse through programs to learn more about our work and apply for a grant.\n\nWhether you are a school district administrator, food service director, food service team member, concerned parent, student or committed community advocate, there are many ways to get involved in changing the way we feed our kids.\n\nByron received his B.S. in Dietetics, as well as completed a Dietetic Internship, at Georgia Southern University where he focused on school and rural community nutrition. Upon receiving his registered dietitian credentials Byron went to work as a child nutrition specialist, and then manager, at a Houston non-profit known as Baker-Ripley. There, he managed the School Nutrition Programs and Child and Adult Care Food Programs for Early Head Start, Head Start, and K-12. From there he went to get my M.P.H at Johns Hopkins University with an emphasis in food, nutrition, and policy. Byron then went on to work for the Lerner Center for Public Health Promotion coordinating research projects related to child nutrition policy and programs."
