        "text": "What a gift it has been to work at Byron Center Christian. It has been a wonderful transition after staying home for the past 6 years with my children.\n\nI attended Hope College where I received my teaching degree in elementary education and special education. I taught 6th grade and special education for seven years prior to having kids. My husband Marc and I have been married for 10 years and have 3 children that currently attend Byron Center Christian.\n\nFavorite Verse: “For we God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works which God prepared in advance for us to do.” Ephesians 2:10\n\nMy Deep Hope is that students grow daily in their faith by identifying and applying their gifts to help grow the kingdom of God both in school and in the community.\n\nI have worked at BCCS since 2001. I love working with the kids. My parents were foster parents when I was young, so I always enjoyed having kids around. I like the fact that I am able to work with kids from the age of four to 14.\n\nMy wife and I have 3 boys. We enjoy traveling as a family and going to a lot of different sporting events that our kids are involved in. In the past, I have coached baseball, basketball and soccer.\n\nI also play golf whenever I get the chance and enjoy golfing with my sons.\n\nFavorite Verse: “'For I know the plans I have for you,' declares the Lord, 'plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.'” Jeremiah 29:11-13\n\nI work in the Lower Elementary Media Center and have library classes with preschoolers up through the second grade. I so loved reading each night to my own children as they grew up that we continued years after I thought we might have stopped. I am thankful now to be reading to the students at BCCS and hope I can help instill in them a love of books and reading. I also teach technology to the preschoolers, junior kindergartners, and kindergartners, helping them gain familiarity with and confidence on the computer.\n\nEducation:\n\nCutlerville Christian School\n\nSouth Christian High School\n\nCalvin College, BA in Psychology\n\nFamily:\n\nmarried to Ken\n\n3 children: Aaron, Adam, and Jenna - all BCCS graduates\n\nI enjoy getting together with family and friends, knitting, and, of course, reading!\n\nFavorite Verse: \"I know that my redeemer lives, and that in the end he will stand on the earth. And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God; I myself will see him with my own eyes—I, and not another. How my heart yearns within me!\" Job 19:25-27\n\nI was born and raised in Tinley Park, Illinois, where I attended a Christian school from PreK-12th grade. After high school I moved out to Sioux Center, Iowa, to attend what is now Dordt University. By attending a Christian school my whole life, I have come to value it and appreciate the way it has shaped and molded me.\n\nI am grateful to have been given the opportunity to help out in various areas at Byron Center Christian School. I work with many different students of different ages, and I have really enjoyed the variety! Seeing how God is already at work in kids as young as five years old and then seeing how that faith and love grows in middle school, is quite a privilege in which I am able to see and work.\n\nMy husband, Davis, and I moved to southwest Michigan after graduating from Dordt and getting married in the summer of 2018. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, playing games and sports, and spending time with friends and family.\n\nMy Deep Hope is for you to confidently read and write so that you can explore God’s world.\n\nWhen my youngest daughter entered school full time, I started in earnest to pray about whether God wanted me to remain on my present course (stay-at-home mom), return to a previous one (practicing architecture) or totally veer off in a new direction. I was surprised by God’s answer to my prayer but am excited about my new adventure as MS librarian. For me the position combines an architect’s organizational skills and a mother’s love for kids. I’ve always loved reading aloud to my kids and it is a joy to read aloud to the BCCS students as well. It is such a blessing to be a part of the BCCS staff.\n\nI attended Ada Christian School (K-9th grade), G.R. Christian High School, Calvin College (pre-architecture) and Lawrence Technological University. I am married to Jay Miedema and have two daughters, Kaya and Madie, who attended BCCS. As a family we love taking road trips. We especially enjoy visiting state capitols, national park sites and Frank Lloyd Wright designed buildings.\n\nMy favorite verses: \"I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. I can do all this through him who gives me strength.\" Philippians 4: 12-13\n\nI grew up in Hudsonville (where I still reside) where I attended Hudsonville Christian School and then Unity Christian High School. I graduated from Baker College in 2013 with an Associate Degree in Applied Science, but rerouted my career path a few years later.\n\nGod has been pulling at my heartstrings over the past few years to make a change in my career path to something where I can help people - this led me to seek a career in working with kids. I am excited to be working at Byron Center Christian with kids where I can help make a difference in their lives. Over the next few years, I will be working on my Master’s Degree in School Counseling through Grand Valley State, and I am glad I will have my experience at Byron Center Christian to help me build my degree off of.\n\nIn my free time, I love spending time with my family - including my parents; my older sister, Katelyn; and my younger sister, Shaelyn. Also included in our family is our fur babies: our 2 dogs - Delta and Mushu and 3 cats - Rumpel, Paisley, and Meka.\n\nMy favorite Bible verse is Proverbs 3:5-6 - “Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight.” I am continuing to work on not leaning on my own understanding and fully trusting God, and this verse is always a great reminder of that.\n\nI graduated from Zion Christian School in 2021. After high school, I attended GRCC for Child Development for a year. When I was in college, I felt God was not leading me in that direction. I did a job shadow at BCCS in the fall of 2022 and loved it. They offered me a job and I accepted it. It is a blessing to be at BCCS and I have already learned so much.\n\nI am one of five in my family. I have 2 older brothers, an older sister, and a younger sister who is in 5th grade at Zion Christian School. I have 2 nephews and another nephew/niece on the way.\n\nIn my free time, I love to garden and landscape. I love spending time with my family and going up north to go off-roading.\n\nI attend Trinity URC where I am the VBS director and I also lead a ministry for special needs adults called Special Friends. I love spending my time serving in the church and serving the community.\n\nFavorite Bible Verse: Romans 8:38-39 “For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.”\n\nMy Deep Hope is that you believe you are a loved child of the king, gifted with special talents.\n\nI am the Spiritual Life Coordinator for BCCS. I am thankful and blessed to be a part of this school. I am also thankful for the opportunity to use my gifts of encouragement, faith, prayer, and teaching to serve the Lord in such a warm and caring atmosphere here at BCCS. It is a joy to meet with students and staff and encourage them in their relationships with God and each other. It's also a lot of fun planning service projects, chapels, and small group materials with so many committed teachers and volunteers!\n\nI am also the Director of Youth Ministries for Faith Community CRC in Wyoming, MI, and I have been in youth ministry for 30+ years. I am married to Kim, who is a teacher at Grandville Calvin Christian Middle School. We have five children, Aaron (married to our daughter-in-law Katie), Zach (married to our daughter-in-law Amy), Ashley, Brianna (married to our son-in-law Sam Brown) and Caleb. We also have a grandson, Lincoln Rodney.\n\nI enjoy camping with family and friends, reading, sports, cheering for the Iowa Hawkeyes, and being by water.\n\nI have several life verses, but the one that has \"been with me\" the longest is: \"Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight.\" Proverbs 3:5-6\n\nI have been involved with Byron Center Christian School for many years; as a student, as a parent, as a substitute teacher and now as an aide. It is a privilege and delight to work with a variety of students and challenge them to grow and develop the gifts God gave them as they discover and explore His world.\n\nEducation:\n\nByron Center Christian School\n\nSouth Christian High School\n\nCalvin College, BA in Elementary Education and MA in reading and reading instruction\n\nFamily:\n\nMarried to Darrin\n\nChildren; Nathaniel and Liz, Daniel and Alexa, Levi, Ethan\n\nWhen I am not at school, I enjoy spending time with family and friends. I also love to hike, backpack, cook, play strategy games, and read.\n\nFavorite Verse: \"But now, this is what the LORD says - he who created you, O Jacob, he who formed you, O Israel; 'Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you my name; you are mine. When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not set you ablaze.'\" Isaiah 43:1-2\n\nMy Deep Hope is that I may encourage and equip all those I encounter to flourish in their unique place in God’s world.\n\nAs a Child of God who is deeply loved and forgiven, I long to serve God as an agent of renewal in his world. I enjoy serving God the most while working with children of all ages! As an ESS teacher, I have the blessing to work with students in small groups or one-on-one settings. It is a joy to work alongside my students as they become more successful in various areas of academics. I especially enjoy the opportunities I have to help these students embrace their unique gifts and abilities God has given them and discover the role they are called to play in God’s story.\n\nOne of my favorite verses is Zephaniah 3:17, “The Lord your God is with you, he is mighty to save. He will take great delight in you, he will quiet you with his love, he will rejoice over you with singing.”\n\nPrior to working at Byron Center Christian, I taught Special Education at Moline Christian for 5 years and later served as a paraprofessional in Special Education for 5 years at Jenison Christian. My husband, Matt is a Surgical Physician Assistant in Bariatric Surgery. We have 3 children, Logan, Kisa, and Ethan. In our spare time we enjoy spending time together as a family, fishing, yard work, and reading.\n\nMy Deep Hope is that my students will discover that our unique challenges and abilities are distinct gifts given by God to play a special role in His renewal story.\n\nI am so thankful that God has led me to Byron Center Christian this year. It has been such a joy to get to know the staff and work with different grade levels every day.\n\nI attended Cedarville University and that is where I met my husband, Michael. We have three children. Our daughter graduated last spring from Cedarville University and was married in June. She is currently a 7th grade English teacher at Eagle Crest Charter School in Holland. I also have two sons. One is a freshman at Cedarville University and the other is a junior in high school.\n\nIt is so exciting for me to come each day to work and interact with the students and watch them grow and learn more about God. One of my favorite verses is Galatians 2:20. “I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.”\n\nMy Deep Hope is to serve and encourage the students that I work with and equip them to fulfill their places in God's story.\n\nAs a child I knew I wanted to be a teacher. I love helping others and seeing the many new things that they are able to learn and do each and every day. I graduated from Calvin College with a degree in Special Education and taught for 10 years at Grand Rapids Public Schools. During that time, God opened some amazing doors that allowed me to see that I was being called to teach in a Christian School and use my talents there. I chose BCCS because of the sense of community I immediately felt. I love and appreciate how no matter who you are, what you can and/or can't do, you are accepted and welcomed as a child of God in this school and this community.\n\nI grew up in Grandville and graduated from Calvin Christian High School. I then attended Calvin College for my BA in Special Education, where I met my husband, Zach. I began teaching in the fall of 2008 for Grand Rapids Public Schools. I spent 6 of my years in a Mildly Cognitively Impaired Classroom, 3 years in middle school teaching 7th and 8th grade all content, and 1 year as middle school resource. In 2016, I received my Masters in Learning Disabilities from Calvin College. I began working at BCCS in 2018 as part of the ESS team.\n\nWhen I am not teaching, I am spending time with my husband, Zach and our three boys, Brandon, Benjamin and Isaac. As a family, we love to go camping, biking, traveling to visit family out of state, and just spending time together.\n\nMy favorite verse is Proverbs 3:5-6, \"Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight.\"\n\nMy Deep Hope is that you IDENTIFY yourself as a child of God, who BELONGS and has a PURPOSE in God’s continuing story, understanding YOU are personally helping to write it.\n\nAfter this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe. Revelation 7:9a, 10\n\nI am part of the Educational Support Team at BCCS and work as a paraprofessional in the 1st grade classrooms.\n\nI was born in Anderson, Indiana and lived there until I was 10 years old. I grew up in a large family (3rd oldest of six siblings). My husband Kyle and I met at Grand Valley State University. We graduated from GVSU in 2007 and we were married in 2009.\n\nKyle and I have three children. Dylan (born in 2012) Aubrey (born in 2014) and Isaac (born in 2016). I have always loved being around children. My parenting journey has guided me to realize my true calling which is helping all children learn.\n\nAfter having children of my own, I volunteered at West Side Christian School. I was then hired to work in the kindergarten rooms at WSCS. God led me to BCCS and I feel blessed to be a part of this community.\n\nFaith has always been an important part of my life. The unexpected death of my father in 2017 really pushed me to lean on my faith. The grieving process is difficult but through it, my faith grew stronger.\n\nMatthew 19:14\n\n“Let the little children come to me, and do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of heaven belongs.”\n\nMy Deep Hope is that I effectively spread God's love every day as I guide students in finding and living out their piece in God's story.\n\nI have been deeply connected to BCCS throughout my life, spending my kindergarten through eighth grade years here as a student. I began working here as a paraprofessional in 2010, shortly after graduating from Calvin University with a degree in special education, elementary education, and K-8 science. Throughout the years I have spent time in nearly all of the grades, ranging from junior kindergarten to eighth grade. I work with individuals and groups of students, developing social, emotional, and educational skills.\n\nWhen I am not at school, I enjoy spending time with my parents, siblings, and friends. In the summer you’ll often find me camping, boating, and relaxing outside. I also enjoy watching sports (Go Blue! Go Tigers!), going to concerts, and digging into a good book all year long. Realistic and historical fiction books are my favorites!\n\nI have a hard time picking a favorite Bible verse, but Ephesians 2:8-9 always sticks with me. “For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works, so that no one can boast.” It is such a great reminder that I do not need to carry the weight of my imperfections on my own shoulders!"
