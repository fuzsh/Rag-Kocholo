He obtained his podiatric medical degree in June of 2013 and completed postgraduate surgical training at Crozer Chester Medical Center in Philadelphia.\n\nDr. Cook is extensively trained in rearfoot, pediatric and complex deformity correction, completing a mini-fellowship at the Rubin Institute for Advanced Orthopedics in Baltimore, Maryland. His experience as an engineer provides him with a unique perspective into the care and treatment that he provides each patient that walks through the door. He is committed to quality patient outcomes and strives daily to offer the best patient care possible.\n\nDr. Cook, his wife and two sons are excited to be back in the Lehigh Valley, close to family and friends."
