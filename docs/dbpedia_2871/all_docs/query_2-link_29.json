        "text": "\"Who's the perfect pair for an RTL Engineer? The Design Verification Engineer, of course! 🙌🔍 Together, they ensure that every aspect of the SOC design is rigorously tested and verified, making sure it's not just functional, but top-quality. Similarly, they lead a quality life, ensuring that the SOC they create is a reflection of their dedication and expertise. Tag your favorite DVE or RTL engineer! \" #DesignVerification #RTLDesign #PerfectPair #SOCQuality\n\nHey ASIC Verification rockstars! 🚀 We've all been there – staring at the screen at 2 AM, wondering if that elusive bug is real or just a figment of our sleep-deprived imagination. 😴💻 So, let's swap some war stories!
