        "text": "Byron Bailey is a Louisiana-raised man that has a passion for cuisine and coffee. He is the local owner of RoeLa Roaster where you can find some of the best coffee in the Delta. RoeLa Roaster is located in downtown Monroe next to the Brass Monkey. Bailey said things are much busier these days downtown, far different from the years past. He explained that you need hope to keep things going, and that is exactly what he thinks downtown Monroe has going right now.\n\nWhere did you grow up?\n\nI was born in New Orleans and moved to Calhoun when I was 5-years-old.\n\nWhat was your childhood like?\n\nI was raised on a farm with two parents and two sisters. We had dogs, turkeys, ducks, horses; the whole nine yards.\n\nWhere did you attend high school?\n\nI went to West Ouachita High School and went to Louisiana State University for college.\n\nWhen did you discover that you had a passion for cooking?\n\nAfter college, I decided that I wanted to go to culinary school. I wanted to learn about creole cooking so I went back to New Orleans.\n\nHow long did you spend your time cooking?\n\nI spent 16 years cooking in various places in New Orleans.\n\nWhen did you meet your wife, Jill?\n\nWe met while I was cooking down in New Orleans. We have been married for a year and a half, and we also have a 4-month-old named Trotter. Jill is also my business partner she is the brains of the operation.\n\nSo, why did you decide to make coffee for a living?\n\nI became interested in coffee as I spoke a lot with Jeffery Meeker. I helped him to develop a blend and went on to do an apprenticeship with him.\n\nWhat did you do after the apprenticeship?\n\nFortunately for me, I had a day-time job while I was experimenting making different blends so there wasn’t any major pressure or time constraints to get this blend right.\n\nHow long did it take you to develop a blend that you thought was a success?\n\nI got to develop blends with friends and family over a 9-month period. It was a lot of experimentation and failure, but that’s how you cook. You try things and you learn from them and then you repeat it.\n\nWhat blend at RoeLa Roaster do you think is the best?\n\nOur first blend is probably our best. It is called Talla Bena. That’s where my dad is from which is a town north of Tallulah.\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about Monroe?\n\nThe different people and the diversity amongst the citizens. It feels like a city should feel.\n\nHow has downtown Monroe changed to you?\n\nDowntown is a long work in progress. It is a rollercoaster clicking up slowly, and I think we are at the top of that right now. It takes time. I currently feel we are at the top of a roller coaster, and we are fixing to be a wild ride of all kinds of fun stuff.\n\nWhat do you spend your free time?\n\nI like to cook and I also enjoy bow hunting and fly fishing.\n\nHow did RoeLa cuisine start?\n\nI started it to help out my friends at Flying Tiger. Everyone wants food, so I made some festival and Mardi Gras type friendly food. Now it has developed into what I want to cook and when I want to cook it. It may not be well received by it is what I want to cook at that time. I want to get to a point where we have food every day.\n\nHow do you let customers know what and when you will be serving food?\n\nWe are really active on Facebook and Instagram, so people just follow our posts to know the latest cuisine we will be offering.\n\nWhat your favorite thing about working?\n\nDeveloping relationships with new people. What I like about working is that I like to work.\n\nHow do you want people to perceive RoeLa Roaster?\n\nI think RoeLa Roaster was designed with the sense of community and the focus on community which has been evident by different committees and public events we have had here. Hopefully, it has been a catalyst for many business opportunities, too. Real estate agents rent out the tasting room, business meetings happen here, and interviews happen here. Coffee can stimulate any conversation.\n\nWhat do you feel you need to get out there for people to know about RoeLa Roaster?\n\nWe’re open till 4:00pm now and we serve food!"
