        "text": "The second of Bishop Arthur and Isabelle Brazier’s four children, Dr. Byron T. Brazier was born and raised on Chicago’s South Side. Dr. Brazier has three sisters: Lola, Janice, and Rosalyn.\n\nDr. Brazier was educated in the Chicago Public Schools system, attending and graduating from Doolittle Elementary School and Wendell Phillips High School. He received his bachelor’s degree from Roosevelt University after first attending Wilson Junior College (Kennedy-King) and Northern Illinois University. Dr. Brazier also received a Masters of Arts in Theological Studies and a Doctor of Ministry Degree from McCormick Theological Seminary.\n\nIn 1972, Dr. Brazier started his professional career as a production supervisor at Johnson & Johnson. In 1973, he joined the data processing division of IBM Corporation as a salesman. He later became a marketing instructor in Dallas, Texas and was promoted to several positions at IBM. In 1991, he transitioned from IBM reaching top-level management as a business unit executive over the public sector. During his tenure at IBM, he received national recognition for his service and leadership on several occasions.\n\nIn 1991, Dr. Brazier founded Brazier and Associates and was appointed Chief Information Officer for the Chicago Housing Authority, where he remained until 1995, the year he became the general administrator of the Apostolic Church of God.\n\nMinistry\n\nDr. Brazier served his father for thirteen years before being named as pastor of the Apostolic Church of God in 2008. His primary motivation was for the congregation to grow in the grace they have received from God, to build their spiritual identity, character, and vision, and to enjoy being a part of the body of Christ. As an apologetic-styled teacher and proclaimer of the Jesus Christ, being “Saved by Grace and Grace Alone” remains the ultimate understanding for a child of God.\n\nWhile preparing the church to live out its mission, his desire is to show forth the power of God in the life of the church as the church confronts a society that is more secular, more individualist, and more concerned about materialistic consumption.\n\nDr. Brazier is also preparing to write the first of two books. The first book will focus on the application of the church’s moral authority to convene and unify the Woodlawn community to achieve self-determination. The second book will be about the power of God to transform the community through the church.\n\nCommunity Outreach\n\nAs an advocate for the community, Dr. Brazier continues to ensure that the church remains a beacon of light and an agent of change in the community. Through the establishment of the Bishop Arthur M. Brazier Foundation, Dr. Brazier has been able to obtain support from philanthropic organization to support the development of the Woodlawn community in the area of education, public safety, and economic development. Beginning in 2010, Dr. Brazier proposed the development of the Network of Woodlawn and its pillars, which has provided a unifying vision for Woodlawn. Finally, Dr. Brazier established a Social Enterprise manufacturing company that provides workforce development services for residents in robotics controls while the revenue from the social enterprise will be reinvested into the Woodlawn community.\n\nCurrently, Dr. Brazier is the chairman of the board of the Network of Woodlawn and its pillars, the Bishop Arthur M. Brazier Foundation, and BSD Industries L3C. He also is a member of the Cook County Sheriff’s Merit Board, the Metropolitan Planning Council, and the Museum of Science and Industry."
