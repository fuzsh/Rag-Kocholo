        "text": "Byron Floyd Goode, Sr.\n\nSeptember 26, 1940 - May 26, 2024\n\nByron Floyd Goode, Sr. of Jarrell, Texas passed away peacefully on May 26, 2024 at the age of 83.\n\nByron was born in 1940 to Claudia and Raymond Floyd Goode of Jarrell, Texas. He attended Texas A&M College and graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in Animal Husbandry as part of the class of 1962. After graduation, Byron moved back to Jarrell where he became a permanent resident. He eventually owned Harrison Grain and Cattle Company and was a lifelong rancher and cattle trader.\n\nAs a child, Byron was an avid Brooklyn Dodgers fan and was a polio survivor. Byron loved the Aggies and was a long-standing member of the Texas A&M Association of Former Students Century Club. He was known for his sense of humor and never missed an opportunity to play a prank or practical joke. He could find something humorous in even the most difficult situations. Byron had an incredible ability to remember dates and events, and always had a story to tell. He enjoyed drinking his coffee on the porch in the early hours of the day and spending time in the pasture checking on his cattle. He valued a hard day’s work and nothing made him happier than an inch of rain and a new baby calf.\n\nByron is preceded in death by his parents Claudia and Raymond Floyd Goode, brother Frederick M. Goode, sister Susan Kautzer, and his wife Patsy Goode. He is survived by his son Byron F. Goode, Jr. Class of 1993 and wife Lynn, daughter Jennifer Windland Class of 1999 and husband Doug, and by his 3 grandchildren Cassidy Vrabel, Molly Windland, and Gabriel Windland.\n\nA visitation for Byron will be held Thursday, May 30, 2024 from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM at Cook-Walden Davis Funeral Home, 2900 Williams Drive, Georgetown, TX 78628. The funeral service will occur at 10:00 AM on Friday, May 31, 2024 at Cook-Walden Davis Funeral Home. Burial will follow at Corn Hill Cemetery, Hugh Smith Lane, Jarrell, TX 76537."
