        "text": "Byron E. “Chris” Chrisman, age 96, passed away on Tuesday, December 28, 2021 at home with his family by his side.\n\nByron is survived by his loving children Melanie (Richard) Alvarez and Carol (Tony) Skrapits; his grandchildren Matthew Alvarez, Marilyn Alvarez, Rachel Alvarez, Maddy Skrapits, and Anthony Skrapits.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his beloved wife Lois (nee Korty) Chrisman; parents, Charles and Leta Chrisman; and his brother Charles “Jr.” Chrisman.\n\nByron was a loving man who put a smile on everyone’s face. He was born in Chambersburg, IL in 1925. He entered into the United States Navy and proudly served his country. He then went on to attend Bradley University for undergrad, and earned a Master’s Degree in teaching from University of Illinois. After graduation Byron began his work as a teacher for the Joliet School District. Byron loved to teach and it was something he put his whole heart into. Upon retirement Byron began to enjoy the smaller things in life like, reading a good book, catching up on current events, sipping a Budweiser with a line in the water, and just enjoying nature, especially birds. He also had quite the knack for gardening, and could cook up a wonderful fish fry that had all guests begging for the recipe. People meeting him for the first time would comment on what a gentleman he was. He demonstrated this by waiting to sit down until the lady was seated, always pulling out a chair for a woman and making sure to open the door for others. His favorite restaurant was the Country Charm in New Lenox, and in his later years, he could be found there several times a week enjoying a pot roast melt and a cup of fruit. Byron was an independent man who took care of his family and himself up until the end. He will be missed by all that knew him.\n\nA graveside service will be held on Saturday, January 8, 2021 at 10:30 AM Maplewood Cemetery, New Lenox ."
