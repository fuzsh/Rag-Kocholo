        "text": "“I’ve been able to strike a balance between performance and education and a variety of different collaborations,” says Cook. “I think it’s really important that we pass this on. It’s American classical music, and so it excites me when I see young people interested and excited about it, and wanting to pursue it as I did when I was young.”\n\nIndeed, Cook was introduced to the music at a young age in her native Detroit. Growing up, she sang in the Methodist Church, but also enjoyed a range of musical styles – from European classical to rock to the blues.\n\nDuring her formative years, Cook studied privately voice, piano and string bass, the latter of when she played in the orchestra at Detroit’s esteemed Cass Technical High School. Cook attended Boston’s Northeastern University and earned a degree in Speech Communication. While in Boston, she formed the first of several jazz ensembles. She moved to New York in 1990, where she began performing regularly on the jazz scene; in the ensuing years, in a career spanning more than two decades, she has performed in concert halls and nightclubs and jazz festivals throughout the U.S. and Europe, Russia, Central Asia, Canada, Brazil, The United Arab Emirates, Africa, and Australia.\n\nAlways open to new experiences, Cooks looks forward to the next big thing – from solo recording to collaboration to performing to more teaching opportunities. For her, it’s all about telling stories, and that’s what she loves about a life in jazz.\n\n“I love that it allows me to improvise,” says Cook. “I love the freedom of the music. I love that it’s so broad, with all its different influences by some amazing people that started off creating and defining this music. I feel honored to be part of the story.”"
