Callirhoe pedata

(Nutt. ex Hook.) A.Gray

Malvaceae

There are several records regarding the traditional use of this species for food - all of them place its range in western or northwestern N. America (particularly Idaho, Wyoming and Nebraska). However, the plant is not native to that area, being found instead in central and southern N. America (mainly in Texas and Oklahoma). It is possible that the records on edibility are correct and the range was given in error, though it is also possible that the plant was wrongly identified.

This species has been confused in the past with Callirhoe digitata Nutt. (itself having edible roots), though that species also has a more southerly and easterly range.

Callirhoe involucrata (Torr. & A.Gray) A.Gray, which also has an edible root, is found in northwest N. America and so is a likely candidate.

Callirhoe pedata has also been commonly confused with Callirhoe leiocarpa R.F.Martin in literature, though this latter species also has a more southerly range and is an annual rather than perennial.

One final possibility - Callirhoe alcaeoides (Michx.) A.Gray is closely related to Callirhoe pedata and hybridizes with it where their ranges overlap in Oklahoma. This species, which has a long taproot, is also found in northwest N. America. The taproot of this last species is likely to be edible even though we have found no literature to support this[
