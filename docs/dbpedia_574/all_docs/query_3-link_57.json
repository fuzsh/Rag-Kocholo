        "text": "Select the criterion by which you wish to search (Scientific name, Genus, Family, etc.) and enter that information into the provided field.\n\nHint: Correct spelling is necessary for desired results, but because this function is a string search the full name need not be entered. Any correct part of a taxon name can be entered and a choice of the correct one made from the small list of resulting matches.\n\nFor example, matching the full name exactly in a Scientific Name search for Piptochaetium avenacioides may be difficult, but strings of either tium aven or avenaci or m avenac or pipto will all result in very small lists of matches. The intended name can then be chosen from any of those lists. Usually, the last letter (or two) of a given genus, a space, and the first few correct letters of the specific epithet will provide a sufficiently short list containing the desired taxon.\n\nA similar example in a Common Name search is Virginia snakeroot. Searching using \"snake root\" will yield no results due to the extra space, but searching \"snake\" will generate a short list of plants with the word \"snake\" in the common name. Furthermore, a search of \"Virginia snake\" or even \"nia snak\" yields one result: Virginia snakeroot.\n\nIf, after following the above advice, then difficulties are still encountered please use the \"browse\" feature.\n\nA voucher specimen is a pressed and thoroughly dried plant sample deposited in a herbarium, and is intended to be a permanent record supporting research purposes. A voucher may be a record of a plant's occurrence in a particular area, or a specific example of a plant used in a scientific investigation.\n\nProper vouchers display all the necessary attributes for complete identification of the plant, and are to be accompanied by accurate locality, habitat, collection time, and collector data.\n\nOnly plant populations vouchered by specimens deposited in Index Herbariorum (http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/) recognized herbaria are represented on this map."
