        "text": "No Place but Texas:\n\nAn Annotated List of Plant Taxa Endemic to the Lone Star State\n\nWilliam R. Carr\n\nThe Nature Conservancy of Texas\n\nIncomplete Working Draft, November 2009\n\nProvided below is a list of all plant taxa thought to be endemic to, i.e., found only in, the State of Texas. This distinction has no biological significance, since political boundaries do not correspond to biotic and abiotic forces that effect plant distribution. Nonetheless, this list is offered to satisfy the curiosity of those who wish to know, for whatever reason, which of the state's 5500 to 6000 plant taxa grow only in Texas. Plant taxa that are endemic to the each of the 11 ecoregions that are found, in whole or (mostly) in part in Texas, are available from The Nature Conservancy in other venues.\n\nA list of Texas endemics is not a new idea: two similar unpublished lists have been generated in the past. The first, entitled Endemic Vascular Plants of Texas, probably dates from the mid 1970's. It came to the Texas Natural Heritage Program from the files of the long-defunct Rare Plant Study Center at the University of Texas at Austin. Its authorship is unknown, but legend has it that it was the work of a student of Dr. Chester Rowell, a student who compiled it by painstakingly thumbing through the Manual of the Vascular Plants of Texas (Correll & Johnston, 1970) and writing down every taxon described as endemic to Texas. The second effort was a list of target species for a project entitled Phytogeographical Investigation of Texas Endemics (Amos, 1991). This list was compiled by Dr. Bonnie Amos of Angelo State University. Its concept was broader, including taxa thought to be endemic to major natural biological regions contained mostly within the state as well as most of the traditional political endemics.\n\nAll of the taxa from the preceding efforts were originally included in this list. Many were deleted on the basis of new information documenting occurrence beyond the boundaries of the state. Others were deleted for taxonomic reasons, as new information made it clear that some of our so-called endemics were not distinct from taxa of other regions. (See \"Excluded Taxa\" at end of document.) Conversely, a few recently-described endemics are included here for the first time.\n\nThis is a work in progress. County distributions were compiled over the years from voucher specimens as well as a wide spectrum of published and unpublished literature. However, those sources are not cited directly in this document. Before any such list can be published, voucher specimens for each county must be transcribed. That task has not been undertaken as yet, in part because the ongoing Flora of Texas project offers the prospect that such information will be available electronically in a few years. For the meantime, county records represented by vouchers at the Plant Resources Center at the University of Texas at Austin are flagged with asterisks. The fact that other records are not documented herein is unacceptable and will be corrected in the future.\n\nOnly a few particularly pertinent literature references are cited. Those providing an illustration of the taxon in question are flagged with asterisks.\n\nPTERIDOPHYTES\n\nIsoetaceae Quillwort Family\n\nIsoetes lithophila Pfeiffer.Rock quillwort. Sand and gravel in shallow water of ephemeral pools on essentially barren granite and gneiss outcrops on the Llano Uplift. Burnet*, Gillespie, Llano* and Mason counties. Ref: Correll, 1956*; Correll & Correll, 1975*; Flora of North America Committee, 1993; Rowell, 1983; Walters & Wyatt, 1982.\n\nANGIOSPERMS\n\nMonocots\n\nAgavaceae Agave Family\n\nNolina arenicola Correll.Sand sacahuista. Windblown Quaternary sand in dune area east of Van Horn; also in shrublands on steep Permian limestone slopes in the Guadalupe Mountains. Culberson, Hudspeth and perhaps El Paso counties. Ref.: Burgess & Northington, 1981; Correll, 1968; Poole, 1989b; Powell, 1998*.\n\nNolina lindheimeriana (Scheele) Wats.Lindheimer's nolina. Grasslands and open juniper-oak woodlands on dry rocky limestone slopes, mostly on the Edwards Plateau, but ranging north on the Lampasas Cutplain to Bell and Somervell Counties and south to at least Fayette County. Bandera*, Bell, Bexar*, Comal*, Edwards*, Gillespie*, Fayette*, Kendall*, Kerr*, Lampasas*, Somervell, Travis* and Williamson* counties. Ref.: Diggs, Lipscomb & O'Kennon, 1999*; Lynch, 1981*.\n\nYucca cernua Keith.Nodding yucca. Known from a six square kilometer area in west-central Newton County and adjacent eastern Jasper County, where it is restricted to open or partially shaded upland sites on brownish acid clays of the Redco Series (Keith, 2003).\n\nYucca necopina Shinners.Glen Rose yucca. Grasslands on sandy soils on terraces of the Brazos River in Hood and Somervell counties and in deep sands in Parker and Tarrant counties (Diggs, Lipscomb & O'Kennon, 1999). Ref.: Diggs, Lipscomb & O'Kennon, 1999*.\n\nYucca pallida McKelvey.Pale yucca. Rocky limestone slopes primarily on the Lampasas Cutplain and in the Cross Timbers, with reports from Bosque, Brown, Coryell, Dallas, Palo Pinto, Parker, Somervell, Tarrant and Wise counties; the report from Travis County in Vines (1960) is doubtful.

According to Mahler (1988), Yucca rupicola ranges no further north than Bell County, which would seem to indicate that reports from Dallas and Somervell counties may be based on specimens of Yucca pallida, another Texas endemic. Ref.: Diggs, Lipscomb & O'Kennon, 1999*; Enquist, 1987a*; Lynch, 1981*; Rickett, 1970*; Vines, 1960*.\n\nYucca tenuistyla Trel.White-rim yucca.

Villareal Q. (1994) reported Echeandia chandleri to be common in valleys and on lower slopes in a portion of southeastern Coahuila that lies at an elevation between 1200 and 2350 meters; the species is retained as a Texas endemic pending a taxonomic assessment of the Coahuila material.
