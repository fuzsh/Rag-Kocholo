It is endemic to northern California where it is known from only a few occurrences in two or three counties. It grows in the mountain forests of the North Coast Ranges.\n\nPotentilla californica, also known as California horkelia, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family.\n\nPotentilla clevelandii, also known as Cleveland's horkelia, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is native to the Peninsular Ranges of southern California and northern Baja California.\n\nPotentilla lindleyi, commonly known as wedgeleaf horkelia, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is endemic to California, where it grows in coastal chaparral communities and sandy areas.\n\nPotentilla daucifolia, commonly known as carrotleaf horkelia, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is native to the Klamath Mountains and surrounding ranges in northern California and southern Oregon. It grows on mountain slopes and fields, often on serpentine soils.\n\nPotentilla douglasii is a species of flowering plant in the rose family known by several common names, including pinewoods horkelia and dusky horkelia.

It is endemic to the Klamath Mountains of northern California where it is a plant of mountain meadows, often on serpentine soils. This is a perennial herb forming tufts of long, erect leaves and thin, naked stems. Each leaf is a taillike strip of overlapping lobed leaflets. The reddish to greenish stems reach 30 to 50 centimeters in height and bear inflorescences of clustered flowers. The stems, leaves, and inflorescences are all covered in fuzzy white to gray hairs. Each flower is about a centimeter wide, with pinkish-green triangular sepals and longer, narrower pink or purple petals. In the center of the flower are 20 stamens and a few pistils.\n\nPotentilla recta, the sulphur cinquefoil or rough-fruited cinquefoil, is a species of cinquefoil. It is native to Eurasia but it is present in North America as an introduced species, ranging through almost the entire continent except the northernmost part of Canada and Alaska.\n\nPotentilla hendersonii, commonly known as Henderson's horkelia, is a rare species of flowering plant in the rose family.
