Â\n\nLike the previous two volumes, Iâve tried to follow as much as possible the arrangement of plants of Flora of North America and this has been helped significantly by completion of all the volumes encompassing this group of plants. Â\n\nAlso like before, there are inevitably going to be errors in identification - due strictly to me. Â\n\nTwo things stand out to me in this volume.Â First, I canât believe I photographed and identified (hopefully correctly) so many members of the aster family (149 species).Â Second, when I was working on my masters, the lily family was not as large as it is now.Â DNA analysis has apparently placed a lot more into the family since my graduate days. Â\n\nChapter 2\n\nAsteraceae\n\nI never know what to call this family.Â When I was in graduate school, the old name was Compositae.Â I learned Asteraceae.Â When I restarted my interest in taxonomy, most sites used Compositae and as a consequence, organized my photographs accordingly.Â Flora of North America, volume 19-21 uses Asteraceae butÂ volume 19 was published in 2006.1Â\n\nI donât guess it really matters what you call the family but it is one of the larger families of plants in North America if you dedicate three volumes to cover one family of plants as Flora of North America does. Â\n\nIn the three volumes, there are 418 genera, 2,413 species (of which 1,518 are endemic) and 426 considered conservation taxa.2 Â\n\nThe name Compositae comes from the âcompositeâ nature of the flowers.Â Individual flowers are found grouped together into a âheadâ of flowers.Â The head is often surrounded by leafy bracts called an involucre.Â The head of flowers may be a few individual flowers or hundreds of individual flowers.\n\nFlower types in the family fall into two types: disc flowers and ray flowers.\n\nBoth flowers have an inferior ovary where the petals, stamens, stigma and style are found above the ovary.\n\nThe disc flower has five petals fused for most of their length.Â Sepals are not present or they may be modified into spines, awns, or pappus.Â Often the stamens are fused at their anthers.Â Disc flowers may be either fertile or infertile.\n\nRay flowers have the petals fused into one large petal which looks like a tongue or spatula. Â\n\nThey may also be fertile or infertile.Â In some genera, the head is composed of disc flowers in the center with ray flowers around the periphery.Â The disc flowers in this case are often fertile and the ray flowers are often infertile.Â Think of the sunflower as an example of this.\n\nWhen fertilized, often by insects, the ovary develops into an achene.Â An achene is where the seed is loosely attached to the ovary wall only at one point. Â Again, think of sunflower seeds.Â The seed âcoatâ is the ovary wall.Â The seed within is loose within the ovary.\n\nA lot of the work on the family Asteraceae was done by Arthur Cronquist.Â I met him once when he visited the herbarium at the University of Mississippi.Â He was in a hurry and was a little put out when Dr. Pullen asked him to annotate any species he pulled from the herbarium, but he did it anyway.Â It may have been my comparison with Dr. Pullen, but Cronquist seemed to me to have a bit of an ego.Â Dr. Pullen later felt he has misidentified several species he annotated. Â\n\nBasically, an annotation is when someone utilizes a specimen in a herbarium, they confirm the identification, usually by placing an exclamation mark with their name.Â If they do not confirm the identification, they are supposed to write their identification on the herbarium sheet and then sign their name. Â\n\nThe aster family is complex and one must pay particular attention to numerous features of the plant for identification.Â You must always examine the involucre, the type of structure at the top of the ovary: pappus, awn, bristle, and determine whether the ray and/or disc flowers are fertile.Â In order to do this you really need a dissection scope so you can dissect the flower.Â Thatâs impractical on camping trips which most of my excursions are. Â\n\nFor that reason, Iâm very reluctant to photograph members of the family and only do so when there is a possibility of identification only through the photograph.Â I assumed, as I began to collate the genera that I would have very few photographs of composites.Â Wrong!Â I have photographed 82 genera and 152 species. Â\n\nFor this reason, Iâve put the family in its own volume, sharing with the monocots.Â Considering Flora of North America published three volumes of the family, I guess I can make one separate volume for the family. Â\n\nAdenocaulon bicolor Hooker\n\nAmerican Trailplant (Adenocaulon bicolor Hooker)\n\nI was introduced to this plant by Tom Martell during his walking tour of Muir Woods.Â Supposedly, you can mark a trail by twisting a leaf over showing the white undersurface of the plant.Â Which leaf you turn marks the trail.Â That presupposes there are a lot of these plants growing in the proper place on the trail.Â It sounds good in theory but I suspect the practice leads a little to be desired.\n\nIâve found this in one other place - Mount Hood National Forest near Corbett, Oregon along the Columbia River Gorge - some of the most beautiful scenery in the west.\n\nCarduus pycnocelphalus Linnaeus\n\nItalian Thistle (Carduus pycnocelphalus Linnaeus)\n\nFirst, I have great difficulty distinguishing between the genus Carduus and the genus Cirsium.Â They look the same to me. Â\n\nAlso, why this is called Italian thistle, I have no idea.Â I suppose it came from Europe.Â Perhaps it is so named because I found it in the Italian section of San Francisco - not.Â Actually, I photographed this on the way up to Twin Peaks.\n\nMost thistles are considered pests in the United States.\n\nItalian Thistle (Carduus pycnocelphalus Linnaeus)\n\nAs you can see, it has the hairy pappus of many members of the aster family for seed dispersal. They simply float away on the breeze.\n\nCirsium vulgare (Savi) Ten.\n\nBull Thistle (Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Ten.)\n\nThere are several genera commonly referred to as thistles.Â I like thistles, partly because it is the national flower of Scotland and Iâm part Scottish.Â I like this particular genus of thistle because it almost sound like my name. Â\n\nAs a Boy Scout, I learned most thistles were edible if you could peel away the spines on the plant.Â Tricky business, that. Â\n\nFlora of North America reports 62 species of the genus Cirsium.3Â This, to me, is one of the more beautiful thistles.Â Unfortunately, it is introduced and has spread to all 48 contiguous states and some provinces in Canada and is considered a noxious weed.4\n\nThistles donât have ray flowers.Â Instead, they are all disc although some of the disc flowers can be elongated.Â What you see in the photograph are numerous purple disc flowers surrounded by a spiny involucre of bracts.\n\nBull Thistle (Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Ten.)\n\nEven the leaves and stems have spines.Â In this photo you can see the stem is a bit winged (leaf-like enations on the stem and you can also see the leaves are clasping the stem without a petiole present.\n\nBull Thistle (Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Ten.)\n\nNote the disc flowers but also look very carefully and you can see some structures projecting from the disc flowers which are bilobed at the tip.Â Thatâs the stigma of the pistil. Â\n\nI was at the start of my hike along Avalanche Lake Trail in Glacier National Park when I came across this beauty.Â I have to admit, it was hard to look for plants to photograph when the scenery itself was so spectacular.\n\nAvalanche Lake Trail View - Glacier National Park\n\nCirsium arvense (L.) Scop.\n\nCanada Thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.)\n\nAppropriately, I found this in Canada but not before I found it at Mount Rushmore.Â Like C. vulgare, this is an introduced plant which has become a noxious weed throughout the U.S. and Canada. This one is even found in Alaska.5\n\nTo me, itâs not nearly as attractive as C. vulgare. Â\n\nCanada Thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.)\n\nAgain, the head is composed entirely of disc flowers. Canada Thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.)\n\nThe stigmas of the pistils are turning a little brown here.Â This was photographed at Lake Louise in Alberta.\n\nCirsium horridulum Michx.\n\nPurple Thistle (Cirsium horridulum Michx.)\n\nI think the specific name a little hyperbolic but at least you can definitely see the purple stems.Â If you look at the involucre on the two previous species, the bracts are not lobed.Â On this one, you can see the bracts are distinctly lobed. Â\n\nIâm always amazed to find thistles pretty much anywhere I travel in the United States and Europe.Â Typically they like open places like fields and roadsides but Iâve also found them deep in the woods. Â\n\nThis particular one was along the roadside at Lake George State Forest near De Leon Springs, Florida.\n\nCirsium nuttallii DC.\n\nNuttallâs Thistle (Cirsium nuttallii DC.)\n\nHere again, the involucre is unlobed bracts.Â The flower color in thistles can be highly variable but I see a bit of pink in this one. Â\n\nNuttallâs Thistle (Cirsium nuttallii DC.)\n\nI was lucky to find one in flower and one in fruit on the same plant.Â Note the tufted achenes.Â Each tuft contains tiny hairs arranged like the barbs on a feather.Â The technical term is plumose.Â The tufts carry the achene on the breeze and then drops it down as the breeze stops - an excellent means of seed dispersal but one that strews the seeds on one direction only.Â\n\nThis particular one was photographed on the River Trail at Silver Springs State Park at Silver Springs, Florida.\n\nCirsium neomexicanum A. Gray\n\nNew Mexico Thistle (Cirsium nemomexicanum A. Gray)\n\nThis is a southwestern species as you might assume from both the common name and scientific name and indeed, I photographed it along the roadside of Zion National Park. Â\n\nNew Mexico Thistle (Cirsium nemomexicanum A. Gray)\n\nI like the powder puff effect of the head of flowers on this one. Â\n\nThe nice thing about Zion is that even the roadside has spectacular views of the canyon.\n\nRoadside View of Zion Canyon\n\nCirsium occidentale (Nuttall) Jepson\n\nCalifornia Thistle (Cirsium occidentale (Nuttall) Jepson)\n\nIâve probably mentioned the difficulty Iâve had in distinguishing between the genus Carduus and Cirsium.Â This is one of the reasons.Â This was at one time named Carduus occidentalis.Â I suspect a lot of what I learned as Carduus is no longer in that genus.\n\nThe common name is appropriate since I found it at Lands End in San Francisco.\n\nCirsium arizonicum (A. Gray) Petrak var. bipinnatum (Eastw.) D.J. Keil)\n\nCardimine Thistle (Cirsium arizonicum (A. Gray) Petrak var. bipinnatum (Eastw.) D.J. Keil)\n\nI usually donât do varieties of plants without the aid of a dissection scope but I apparently found a source somewhere that allowed this distinction.Â I suspect I found a checklist of plants of the Grand Canyon North Rim. Â\n\nCardimine Thistle (Cirsium arizonicum (A. Gray) Petrak var. bipinnatum (Eastw.) D.J. Keil)\n\nThis was at the end of its life (gone to seed) and I suspect it could be more attractive earlier in the year but this thistle didnât inspire my Scottish roots.\n\nCirsium scariosum Nuttall\n\nElk Thistle (Cirsium scariosum Nuttall)\n\nFlora of North America has this as a highly variable species with 10 varieties, all in the western U.S. and Canada.6 I photographed it in Upper Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park.Â I wonder if the short size of the plant has anything to do with growing in an area where the soil is extremely hot from geyser activity.\n\nIt could also be that the plant was grazed by either bison or elk within the park. Â\n\nCentaurea stoebe L. subsp. micranthos(S.G. Gmelin ex Gugler) Hayek\n\nSpotted Knapweed (Centaurea stoebe L. subsp. micranthos(S.G. Gmelin ex Gugler) Hayek)\n\nThe only reason I can give subspecies here is this is the only species/subspecies found in North America.Â This is an introduced species from Europe and DNA analysis indicates this is the same one from Europe.7\n\nI photographed this while waiting for the helicopter at Spillimacheen, British Columbia.Â The helicopter was waiting to whisk us away to the Bugaboo Lodge for three days of hiking in the Columbia Mountain Range.Â The Columbia River flowed near by. Â\n\nNotice there arenât any visible spines on the stems or leaves.\n\nElephantopus tomentosus Raeuschel\n\nElephantâs Foot (Elephantopus tomentosus Raeuschel\n\nAnother soft spot in my heart.Â I collected two species of Elephantopus during my Tishomingo days: E. carolinianus and E. tomentosus.8 I was startled to find it at Torreya State Park near Bristol, Florida.Â The plant is so distinctive that after all the intervening years, I was able to recognize the plant immediately.\n\nWhat stands out to me in the plant are the three large deltoid bracts underneath the head of flowers.Â The specific term tomentosus comes from the hairs or trichomes that cover the plant.\n\nElephantâs Foot (Elephantopus tomentosus Raeuschel\n\nThe flowers are disc flowers but there is more of the five petals showing than typical in most disc flowers. Â\n\nYou may wonder why it is called elephantâs food.Â When the plant is in bloom, most of the leaves are found on the stem.Â However, when it starts out in the spring of the year, thereâs a basal rosette of leaves.\n\nElephantâs Foot (Elephantopus tomentosus Raeuschel\n\nThe leaves are quite large and taken all together one might be led to think of an elephantâs foot print.\n\nCichorium intybus L.\n\nÂ Chicory (Cichorium intybus L.)\n\nMy introduction to chicory was on my first trip to New Orleans to visit my cousin Jo with her sister Jimmie.Â It was at Cafe du Monde off Jackson Square in the French Quarter and I had the coffee with chicory and beignets. I still love both.Â I still stop in every time I am in New Orleans\n\nI will admit to a learning curve with coffee with chicory.Â I really became addicted when I was stationed at the Communications Station in New Orleans for two years. Â\n\nThe leaves of this plant have long been used as salad greens and, of course, everyone from the south knows the story of the siege of Vicksburg where the citizens of the town used roasted, ground chicory roots for a coffee substitute.\n\nI found this growing on the Sand Hill Trail at Silver Springs State Park. It was the first time Iâve ever found the plant in the wild.\n\nNote that the flower is composed of all ray flowers. There are no disc flowers in chicory. Â\n\nCrepis atribarba A. Heller\n\nSlender Hawksbeard (Crepis atribarba A. Heller)\n\nThis is another example of all ray flowers in the head.Â I was hiking the Rimrock Trail at Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park when this jumped out at me.Â I would normally have left it alone and not photographed it due to the difficulty in identification but something told me it was unique enough I would be able to identify it. Â\n\nSlender Hawksbeard (Crepis atribarba A. Heller)\n\nI was able to find it on a web site specific to the Black Canyon of the Gunnison.Â Itâs hard to tell in the first photograph, but the leaves are rather linear.Â\n\nRim Rock Trail - Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park\n\nTaraxacum officinale F.H. Wiggers\n\nDandelion (Taraxacum officinale F.H. Wiggers)\n\nI cannot think of a place Iâve been on this planet that I havenât run into dandelions.Â T. officinale is the most abundant species of Taraxacum in North America9 and itâs still a welcome sight.Â Probably the most Iâve seen anywhere is in Minnesota and Michigan where it seems to take over the lawns. Â\n\nThe leaves can be cooked like spinach or eaten raw like a salad.Â Then, of course, thereâs dandelion wine.\n\nDandelion (Taraxacum officinale F.H. Wiggers)\n\nI really like how the bilobed stigma of the pistil sticks out from the ray flowers.Â\n\nDandelion (Taraxacum officinale F.H. Wiggers)\n\nI still admit to the pleasure of blowing the seed pods of the stem.\n\nYoungia japonica (Linnaeus) de Candolle\n\nAsiatic Hawksbeard (Youngia japonica (Linnaeus) de Candolle)\n\nAs you might guess from the common name, this is not native to the United States and has become somewhat of a weed, particularly in my lawn.Â I have to admit I donât mind it too much.Â It has a nice flower and it produces a very small seed head much like dandelions. Â\n\nAsiatic Hawksbeard (Youngia japonica (Linnaeus) de Candolle)\n\nThereâs a basal rosette of leaves at the bottom of the stem.\n\nAsiatic Hawksbeard (Youngia japonica (Linnaeus) de Candolle)\n\nOther than my yard, I also found it at De Leon Springs State Park near De Leon Springs, Florida.\n\nSonchus arvensis L.\n\nSowthistle (Sonchus arvensis L.)\n\nLook how the leaves clasp the stem of the plant.Â The technical description is auricular (ear-like projection).Â This plant has been declared a noxious weed in several states.Â It was introduced from Europe and has a wide distribution across the U.S. and Canada.10\n\nSowthistle (Sonchus arvensis L.)\n\nAll the flowers in the head are ray flowers.Â A lot of people will confuse this with dandelions and it even produces a head of seed similar to dandelions.\n\nThis was photographed at Zion National Park.\n\nSonchus asper (L.) Hill\n\nSowthistle (Sonchus asper (L.) Hill)\n\nAt first glance, this looks similar to S. arvense but this is a much taller plant.\n\nSowthistle (Sonchus asper (L.) Hill)\n\nThe leaves and stems are a little more robust and the leaves actually curve around the stem, more so than in S. arvensis.Â\n\nLike S. arvensis, it is introduced and widely spread across the U.S. and Canada.11\n\nThis was growing along the Cavern Point Trail on Santa Cruz Island in Channel Islands National Park.\n\nHieracium gronovii L.\n\nGronoviusâ Hawkweed (Hieracium gronovii L.)\n\nI think you can begin to see how all these aster family members begin to seem alike.Â This plant has most of its leaves on the stem and typically doesnât have a basal rosette of leaves.Â\n\nGronoviusâ Hawkweed (Hieracium gronovii L.)\n\nI was a little unsure about this identification but itâs the only species of Hieracium reported at Archbold Biological Station.Â I photographed it in April of 2016 along the nature trail.\n\nHieracium albiflorum Hooker\n\nWhite-flowered Hawkweed (Hieracium albiflorum Hooker)\n\nMost Hieracium are yellow flowered so this really drew my attention.Â The only way I new it was Hieracium were by the leaves and the head of all ray flowers.\n\nWhite-flowered Hawkweed (Hieracium albiflorum Hooker)\n\nYou can see the leaves have tiny hairs along the edge of the leaves.Â There are also some among the heads of the unopened flowers.Â This was photographed along the trail to Avalanche Lake in Glacier National Park.Â As you can tell from the photos, I was having a little trouble with the lens fogging over and therefore with focus.\n\nHieracium venosum L.\n\nRattlesnake Hawkweed (Hieracium venosum L.)\n\nTwo things stand out to me with this plant.Â First is the basal rosette of purplish tinged leaves and second, there are no leaves on the stem.Â The only reason I can come up with the common name is this is in mountainous area of North Carolina and it could be you find rattlesnakes in the area.Â Who knows?\n\nRattlesnake Hawkweed (Hieracium venosum L.\n\nIf you look carefully at an individual ray flower, you can count five lobes (notches at the apex) for each flower.Â That shows that ray flowers are simply highly modified disc flowers which also have five lobes.\n\nRattlesnake Hawkweed (Hieracium venosum L.\n\nThe other thing to note is the size of the hairs on the basal leaves.Â They are really obvious in this species.\n\nRattlesnake Hawkweed (Hieracium venosum L.\n\nHieracium triste Wildenow ex Sprengel\n\nHawkweed (Hieracium triste Wildenow ex Sprengel)\n\nI goofed on the original identification of this plant.Â I originally identified it as H. froelichianum.Â There is no such plant in Flora of North America.Â Sometimes, I like a challenge.Â I thumbed through Hieracium in the Flora and found 11 species where I photographed this.12Â I was able to finally narrow it down to H. triste using the distribution maps provided by the Flora. Â\n\nIâll put my original identification down to altitude sickness since I photographed this at around 9,000 feet.\n\nHawksbeard (Hieracium triste Wildenow ex Sprengel)\n\nOne of the features that allowed me to make the current identification was the really hairy involucre surrounding the ray flowers.\n\nThis was photographed on Black Forest Peak in the Bugaboos, British Columbia.\n\nTragopogon dubius Scopoli\n\nGoatâs Beard (Tragopogon dubius Scopoli)\n\nThere are only six states that this plant has not been reported: Alaska, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and Florida.13Â No wonder I was not familiar with it.Â Iâve never been to Alaska (hereâs hoping) and although Iâve been in all the other states except Rhode Island and Hawaii, I only saw this for the first time on my first westward trip with Tauck.Â I first found it in the Upper Geyser Basin of Yellowstone and then on Signal Mountain in Grand Teton.Â Since then, Iâve run into it in Spillimacheen, British Columbia in the Bugaboos. Â\n\nGoatâs Beard (Tragopogon dubius Scopoli)\n\nThe immediate attraction, of course is the flower head.Â The involucre exceeds the petals by a considerable amount.Â The individual flowers of the head are all ray flowers.\n\nGoatâs Beard (Tragopogon dubius Scopoli)\n\nIt also produces a very large âpuffâ of seeds, much larger than any dandelion has tried to produce.Â Each achene (fruit that contains a seed) has a long beak with tufts of hairs at the apex of the beak.\n\nMalacothrix saxatilis (Nutt.) Torr. & A. Gray\n\nCliff Desert Dandelion (Malacotrhix saxatilis (Nutt.) Torr. & A.Gray)\n\nMembers of this genus are distinctly western in distribution.14Â My one and only experience with this genus came at Santa Cruz Island in Channel Islands National Park.Â Sadly, in September of 2019, Santa Cruz Island was the scene of a terrible fire on a diving boat off shore that killed 34 people - one crewman and 33 divers who were below decks at the time the fire broke out.Â As I mentioned before, the time I was there an earthquake occurred.Â I wonder if the island is jinxed.\n\nCliff Desert Dandelion (Malacotrhix saxatilis (Nutt.) Torr. & A.Gray)\n\nThis species was like a shrub and was scattered over the island.Â I saw most of them on the trail to Smugglers Cove.Â The head is composed of ray flowers only. Â\n\nCliff Desert Dandelion (Malacotrhix saxatilis (Nutt.) Torr. & A.Gray)\n\nItâs really hard to tell from the first photograph but the leaves are pinnately dissected and each dissection is almost needle-like.Â I had a hard time figuring the leaf structure at first glance.Â\n\nAgoseris glauca (Pursh) Rafinesque\n\nPale Agoseris (Agoseris glauca (Pursh) Rafinesque)\n\nThere are several genera that give me trouble in identification.Â It didnât used to but since Iâve been so far removed from plant identification when I taught at Broward College, I have trouble with distinguishing among Agoseris, Crepis, and Krigia.Â Superficially, they all look the same to me.Â Itâs only when I begin to work through identifications that it makes any sense to me.\n\nOne feature of Agoseris is there are usually no leaves on the stem.Â All the leaves are typically at the base in a rosette.\n\nPale Agoseris (Agoseris glauca (Pursh) Rafinesque)\n\nLike Malacothrix, Agoseris is a western species15 and I didnât really get exposed to it in graduate school.Â That could be one of the reasons for my confusion.Â This is another one of those ray flowers that it is easy to see the ray is made of five fused petals (note the ends of the rays).\n\nIâve photographed this in Haden Valley of Yellowstone,Â and the Castle Crest Nature Trail of Crater Lake.Â\n\nAgoseris aurantiaca (Hooker) Greene\n\nOrange Agoseris (Agoseris aurantiaca (Hooker) Greene)\n\nWell, this was a pretty easy one to identify.Â Most Agoseris are yellow in color.Â You canât miss the orange against a green background.Â Itâs almost international orange in color.\n\nThis was standing alone at Moraine Lake in Yoho National Park, Alberta.\n\nRafinesquia neomexicana A. Gray\n\nDesert Chicory (Rafinesquia neomexicana A. Gray)\n\nI assume this plant is named in honor of Constantine Samuel Rafinesque who is responsible for 6,700 binomial names of plants, many in the U.S. (Wikipedia)Â\n\nDesert chicory is a good name for this since I found it along the roadside of Death Valley National Park.Â I can only assume you could make a coffee substitute with it but I would be a little hesitant since a lot of western flowers accumulate chemical compounds from the soils.Â The pot of coffee might finish you.\n\nDesert Chicory (Rafinesquia neomexicana A. Gray)\n\nI didnât find too many white flowers in the desert.Â In the background you can see the more common yellow wildflowers.Â Also notice how distinct the stigma and style is of the pistil of each ray in the desert chicory. Â\n\nKrigia virginica (L.) Willdenow\n\nDwarf Dandelion (Krigia virginica (L.) Willd.)\n\nDuring my days at Tishomingo, I collected four species of Krigia: K. biflora, K. dandelion, K. oppositifolia, and K. virginica,16Â so it was good to see an old friend at Manatee Springs State Park near Chiefland, Florida.Â This photograph may be a little misleading.Â The Krigia has a basal rosette of leaves but not the leaves in the foreground.Â That is the winter stage of the grass Panicum.\n\nDwarf Dandelion (Krigia virginica (L.) Willd.)\n\nAgain, the head is composed of all ray flowers.Â This was one of the few wildflowers in bloom in the Manatee Springs State Park.Â Most of what I photographed that day were not in the park but on the Nature Coast bike trail.Â For some reason, the wildflowers in the park were about two weeks behind.Â I assume because the bike trail got more sun.\n\nPyrrhopappus carolinianus (Walter) deCandolle\n\nFalse Dandelion (Pyrrhopappus carolinianus (Walter) de Candolle)\n\nIâm not sure if you can see the basal leaves in this photograph but they definitely look dandelion-like.Â Itâs when you look at the head you begin to see the difference between it and Taraxacum officinale.\n\nÂ Â\n\nP. carolinianus on the top, T. officinale on the bottom\n\nFirst and foremost, there are many more numerous ray flowers on the dandelion head.Â Also, the ray flowers on P. carolinianus are more delicate - almost paperlike.\n\nFalse Dandelion (Pyrrhopappus carolinianus (Walter) de Candolle)\n\nRegardless, it is a beautiful flower.Â This was photographed on the Nature Coast bike trail from Chiefland, Florida to Fanning Springs, Florida.\n\nAntennaria dimorpha (Nuttall) Torrey & A. Gray\n\nLow Pussytoes (Antennaria dimorpha (Nuttall) Torrey & A. Gray)\n\nMembers of the genus Antennaria are commonly called pussytoes.Â In a sense, they do resemble the furry toes of kitty cats.Â Some are probably representative of Papa Hemingwayâs six toed cats with their cluster of heads of ray flowers.\n\nIn Tishomingo, I collected A. plantaginifolia and A. solitaria.17Â Flora of North America states there are two major groups.Â One is mostly western U.S. and the other is North and South America, in general.18Â Thatâs been my experience.Â I have photographed six western species and most of those were in one place: Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park.\n\nLow Pussytoes (Antennaria dimorpha (Nuttall) Torrey & A. Gray)\n\nWhatâs interesting about this particular species is there is but a single head of flowers on the stem.Â If you look carefully, there are no ray flowers here but all disc flowers.Â What you see sticking above each disc is the stigma and style of the pistil.Â These were growing on the trail to Pulpit Rock Overlook.\n\nAntennaria lantana (Hooker) Greene\n\nWooly Pussytoes (Antennaria lantana (Hooker) Greene)\n\nAs you can see here, there are multiple heads on each stem on this species as opposed to the singular head on the previous species.Â There are some stem leaves present but they are much reduced in size.Â Most of the leaves are as a basal rosette. Â\n\nThe shape of the leaf is said to be obovate which means it is broader toward the apex than toward the middle.\n\nI photographed these in a couple of places in the Bugaboos.\n\nAntennaria neglecta Greene\n\nField Pussytoes (Antennaria neglecta Greene)\n\nAll species of pussytoes are pretty innocuous unless you are looking for them.Â They tend to blend in to the background, particularly those with basal rosettes (most species).Â These do have very small leaves on the stem - more lance-like in shape.\n\nField Pussytoes (Antennaria neglecta Greene)\n\nThese are not fully opened as yet but it gives you a good idea of the stem leaves.Â Also note how hairy the stems and leaves are.\n\nField Pussytoes (Antennaria neglecta Greene)\n\nThe most distinctive thing about these are their leaves.Â The term is oblanceolate which means they start out thin at the base and the the apex swells to a large blade.Â More significant in this image is the point on the apex of the leaves.\n\nThis is one of the few eastern species I came across.Â I photographed it on the South Bubble Trail at Acadia National Park.\n\nAntennaria parvifolia Nuttall\n\nCommon Pussytoes (Antennaria parvifolia Nuttall)\n\nEven though it is called âcommonâ it is found mostly in the western U.S. and Canada.19Â Notice how most of the leaves are in-rolled to form a âVâ shape.Â I found these in two separate locations in Black Canyon of the Gunnison: Devilâs Overlook and Rimrock Trail\n\nAntennaria microphylla Rydberg\n\nSmall-leaf Pussytoes (Antennaria microphylla Rydberg)\n\nThe leaves are, indeed, very small in comparison to other species.Â Itâs almost like they form a green mat on the ground. Â\n\nSmall-leaf Pussytoes (Antennaria microphylla Rydberg)\n\nThere are multiple heads for each stem and the leaves are very hairy on both surfaces.Â Iâve photographed this species in two very different locations: Black Canyon of the Gunnison and Yellowstone.\n\nAntennaria rosea Greene\n\nRosy Pussytoes (Antennaria rosea Greene)\n\nYou can see a little rose color on these before they open completely.\n\nRosy Pussytoes (Antennaria rosea Greene)\n\nOthers have no pink associated with them at all.Â Itâs a confusing species with at least four subspecies listed in Flora of North America.Â In addition, it is considered the most widespread Antennaria in North America even though it is not found east of the Mississippi.20\n\nI photographed these in June of 2015 at Crater Lake.Â This was the first of my three visits to the park. Â\n\nAnaphalis margaritacea (L.) Bentham & Hooker f.\n\nPearly Everlasting (Anaphalis margaritacea (L.) Bentham & Hooker f.)\n\nI first saw this plant in August of 2015 at Takakkaw Falls in Yoho National Park in British Columbia.Â Little did I know I would see it over and over again in numerous locations.Â It has escaped and become naturalized in the U.S. and Canada and there are only six states in the southeast where it has not been reported: Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina.21\n\nPearly Everlasting (Anaphalis margaritacea (L.) Bentham & Hooker f.)\n\nI assume the common name is due to finding these pretty much in spring, summer and fall and even remnants in winter.Â The flowers are disc in nature but have a paper-like quality to them.Â The head is unisexual with male flowers in the center and pistillate flowers on the periphery.22\n\nÂ One of my favorite photos is the cluster of heads with a thin coating of ice all over the plant showing they do last quite a while. Â\n\nPearly Everlasting (Anaphalis margaritacea (L.) Bentham & Hooker f.)\n\nThis particular photo was taken at Crater Lake in September of 2016.Â It snowed the night before.\n\nPterocaulon pyncnostchyum (Michx.) Elliott\n\nÂ Â Blackroot (Pterocaulon pycnostachyum (Michx.) Elliott)\n\nThe most interesting thing about this plant to me is the winged stems.Â The flowers are disc flowers but they are so crowded on the head you really canât make out much detail in the field. Â\n\nÂ Blackroot (Pterocaulon pycnostachyum (Michx.) Elliott)\n\nIt was my first experience with this plant at Silver Springs State Park and I knew it might be difficult to identify.Â The winged stems are key along with the toothed leaves. Â\n\nI assume it is called blackroot for a reason but I have not been able to find why.Â In both photos, the flowers are a little past their prime.\n\nPluchea odorata (L.) Cassini\n\nCamphorweed (Pluchea odorata (L.) Cassini)\n\nBack in the day, I collected P. camphorata at Tishomingo23 and when I crossed paths with this, I knew the genus.Â I was pleased to realize it was P. odorata, a close kin and one that Flora of North America suggests hybridizes with P. camphorata.24Â\n\nCamphorweed (Pluchea odorata (L.) Cassini)\n\nI did not squeeze a leaf to see if there is a camphor smell but P. camphorata in Tishomingo did have an aroma.Â Camphor comes from Cinnamomum caphora, not this plant (Wikipedia). Still, I wonder if it could be used as a substitute. Â\n\nOne of the things we had in our medicine chest when I was young was a bottle of Campho-Phenique. We used it as an anti-itch medicine against mosquito bites and redbug bites.Â I still keep a bottle on my medicine shelf for that very purpose.\n\nAchillea millefolium L.\n\nYarrow (Achillea millefolium L.)\n\nA lot of people are impressed when someone has a little knowledge of plants.Â I put that down to so few teachers in K-12 having any botany in their background.Â This is one plant you can impress with your instant identification.Â I know of no other plant that produces a leaf like this. Â\n\nThroughout history, this little plant has had many uses (Wikipedia) but I just love the look of the plant.Â However, I have an ongoing war with the plant in that I never seem to get a decent photo of the flowers.Â The head of flowers are white and to me, white is one of the most difficult things to photograph in nature, particularly in sun.\n\nYarrow (Achillea millefolium L.)\n\nThe ray flowers are on the outer edge of the head and the disc flowers are in the center.Â A lot of times, the ray flowers are infertile but in this case, they generally are fertile.25\n\nÂ This has to be one of the most common roadside plants anywhere in North America - along with Queen Anneâs Lace.\n\nArtemisia tridentata Nuttall\n\nBig Sagebrush (Artemesia tridentata Nuttall)\n\nThere are 50 species of sagebrush in North America26 and I generally steer clear of trying to identify these plants but some are easier than others and then there are those that signs next to them.Â\n\nI think you can see why this is called A. tridentata with the three âteethâ at the apex of each leaf.\n\nBig Sagebrush (Artemesia tridentata Nuttall)\n\nIâve never seen it as a âbigâ plant but it certainly is abundant out west.Â There are ray and disc flowers in the head but Iâve never run across it in bloom. Â\n\nThere are four subspecies in the Flora and a lot of that is based on geographical distribution.27Â I try to stay away from identifying down to subspecies, if possible.\n\nOne unusual place I found this was at Tree Molds Trail in Craters of the Moon National Monument.Â I thought the place worth a visit from the name.Â Itâs an extinct (hopefully) volcanic field and a very interesting place to visit. Â\n\nI had fun hiking various trails there but the one that was disappointing was Tree Molds Trail. It takes you off cross country and when you get there, you see two holes in the ground that represent where two tree trunks were surround by lava and then rotted away. Â\n\nHowever, the scenery getting there was pretty nice.\n\nArtemisia frigida Willdenow\n\nFringed Sage (Artemisia frigida Willdenow)\n\nThe only reason I know what this is is because it was labeled on the nature trail at Great Sand Dunes National Park near the visitor center.Â I can see the âfringedâ aspect however with the leaves looking like fringe.\n\nFringed Sage (Artemisia frigida Willdenow)\n\nArtemisia californica Lessing\n\nCoastal Sagebrush (Artemisia californica Lessing)\n\nThis is another one of those âthank goodness they labeled the plantâ identifications.Â From the common name, I think you can assume it is predominate along the west coast.Â It seems to be restricted in distribution to the state of California.28Â Again, I salute the visitor center at Channel Islands National Park in Ventura, California for providing the identification.\n\nLeucanthemum vulgare L.\n\nOx-eye Daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare L.)\n\nIâve heard of ox-eye daisy ever since my graduate school days but never encountered it until my western trips, which, when you think about it, is unusual in that it is so widespread across North America - just not in Mississippi.29\n\nItâs a beautiful, classical, daisy-looking flower that makes you want to pick the flower and start pulling petals and saying the love me, love me not routine.\n\nOx-eye Daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare L.)\n\nWhy the specific name of vulgare, is beyond me.Â Itâs stunningly beautiful.\n\nBellis perennis L.\n\nEnglish Daisy (Bellis perennis L.)\n\nHow appropriate to go from the ox-eye daisy to the English daisy.Â This, again was a first for me and a surprise along the Smith River bank at Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park. Â\n\nJedediah Smith State Park is interconnected with Redwoods National Park.Â Although separate entities, the two are, for practical purposes, linked together. Â\n\nEnglish Daisy (Bellis perennis L.)\n\nThis is an attractive little daisy with a large number of ray flowers and a dense group of disc flowers.Â As you might guess from the common name, itâs an introduced species from Europe and the Mediterranean.30 Â\n\nThe plant produces underground stems (rhizomes) and spreads in that manner.\n\nBaccharis halimifolia L.\n\nSea-Myrtle (Baccharis halimifolia L.)\n\nEver since our collection trips to the Mississippi Gulf Coast during graduate school days, Iâve been familiar with the genus Baccharis although Iâm surprised Iâve managed to photograph and identify three different species during my travels: B. halimifolia,Â B. pilularis, and B. salicina.Â There are 21 species in the Flora.31Â The flowers in Baccharis are all discoid but I was unable to get this in bloom.\n\nI think of these as mostly shrubs or shrub-like plants and I tend to think of them in moist soils.Â Iâve photographed this species twice and both have been in damp soil: Lake George State Forest and Archbold Biological Station.\n\nBaccharis pilularis de Candolle\n\nCoyotebrush (Baccharis pilularis de Candolle)\n\nThis was not in particularly moist woods like those of the Mississippi Gulf Coast.Â It was in rather well drained soil on the trail to Glen Camp at Point Reyes National Seashore.Â The leaves are much thicker than the previous species (and smaller) but at least I was able to get a photo in bloom. Â\n\nWhat you see sticking out of the disc flowers are the stigma (bilobed) and style.Â Therefore, this is a female shrub.Â Male flowers are on a separate plant.\n\nBaccharis salicina Torr. & A. Gray\n\nWillow Baccharis (Baccharis salicina Torr. & A.Gray)\n\nYou can see from the leaves where the plant derives its common name.Â The only hint of non-willow like trait are the erose (notched or toothed) margins of the leaves.\n\nWillow Baccharis (Baccharis salicina Torr. & A.Gray)\n\nI photographed this species in two locations: Big Bend and Santa Cruz Island.\n\nEricameria nauseosa (Pallax ex Pursh) G.L.Nesom & G.I. Baird\n\nRubber Rabbitbrush (Ericameria nauseosa (Pallax ex Pursh) G.L.Nesom & G.I. Baird)\n\nThis is a western genus through and through32 and E. nauseosa is a complex species with 21 varieties33. From the common name, you may infer the sap of the plant is rubbery and the U.S. Forest Service states that âRabbitbrush was first tested as a source of high quality rubber during World War II.â\n\nRubber Rabbitbrush (Ericameria nauseosa (Pallax ex Pursh) G.L.Nesom & G.I. Baird)\n\nThe first photo shows the plant in seed.Â This shows the plant in bloom with disc flowers.Â The U.S. Forest Service also states that when you crush the leaves, you either get a pineapple smell (to some people) or foul or rubbery smell to others, hence the specific name.\n\nRubber Rabbitbrush (Ericameria nauseosa (Pallax ex Pursh) G.L.Nesom & G.I. Baird)\n\nHere you can see a close up of the plant in seed.Â The seeds contain a very hair pappus (modified calyx). Â\n\nI photographed these at Mesa Verde National Park.Â Ever since minoring in anthropology at Ole Miss, Iâve always wished to see Mesa Verde.Â In particular, the Cliff Palace.Â Dr. Kohler was an expert on Meso-American culture (and quite a character) who taught me how to make arrowheads out of glass and how to appreciate the mysteries of Mesa Verde.Â To this date, no one has a complete explanation for the abandonment of the cliffs by the tribes associated with Mesa Verde.\n\nCliff Palace from Mesa Top Loop Road, October 2016\n\nAt the time, Cliff Palace was closed to the public.Â I would like to go back during the holidays.Â I understand park personnel place lanterns in all the windows and doors at night.\n\nEricameria suffructicosa (Nuttall) G.L.Nesom\n\nSinglehead Goldenbush (Ericameria suffruticosa (Nuttall) G.L. Nesom)\n\nUnlike E. nauseosa, E. suffruticosa has both ray and disc flowers although you may find very few ray flowers or none at all on the bush.\n\nSinglehead Goldenbush (Ericameria suffruticosa (Nuttall) G.L. Nesom)\n\nAlthough it is not quite a single disc or single ray flower, there are very few flowers in a head.Â This was growing along the Rim Road at Crater Lake.\n\nI donât know if the size of the plant has to do with the harsh environment on the Rim Road or if simply it is smaller than rubber rabbit brush.\n\nAmphiachyris dracunculoides (de Candolle) Nuttall\n\nFalse Annual Broomweed (Amphiachyris dracunculoides (de Candolle) Nuttall)\n\nI was on my way to a campsite at Lost Maples State Natural Area near Vanderpool, Texas when I came across masses of this plant along the trail. At first, I couldnât make anything of it, it was so intertwined and connected.\n\nFalse Annual Broomweed (Amphiachyris dracunculoides (de Candolle) Nuttall)\n\nThe leaves were incredibly small and the stems incredibly thin.Â The flowers were the only showy thing about the plant and they were small enough you had to look twice to see if it was in bloom.\n\nThis was September 2016 so it was not unexpected to see a lot of aster family members in bloom - they tend to predominate in the fall - but it took a real close look to see it was indeed a composite. Â\n\nThere are only two species in Flora of North America: A. dracunculoides and A. amoena.Â Both have a terpene smell (again, think camphor) when you crush any of the leaves, stems or flowers34(no I did not). Â\n\nIt was later, after the trip, I was able to find the plant in Ajilvsgiâs excellent Wildflowers of Texas.35\n\nMost of my identifications come after the trip.Â I sort my photos by destination and then pull any books on the region I may have.Â If I donât have books of the region, I check the internet for plant checklists of the region and eventually, when I think I have an identification, I pull up photos of the species on the web.Â It works pretty well for me. Â\n\nGutierrezia sarothrae (Pursh) Britton & Rusby\n\nBroom Snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae (Pursh) Britton & Rusby)\n\nI was on the last leg of my 9.7 mile hike on the West Rim Trail at Grand Canyon National Park, South Rim when I turned a corner and found this alongside the trail.Â All I could make out was a yellow and green mass.\n\nBroom Snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae (Pursh) Britton & Rusby)\n\nAs I got closer, I could make out ray flowers and disc flowers but couldnât get a real feel for how they were organized.\n\nBroom Snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae (Pursh) Britton & Rusby)\n\nIn essence, there are only a few ray and few disc flowers per head.Â At first, I thought I had another singlehead goldenbush (Ericameria suffructicosa) but the leaves were different. Â\n\nThis made my second trip to the south rim.Â It was this trip I photographed a fantastic sunrise with Lookout Studio in the background.\n\nSeriocarpus tortifolius (Michx.) Nees\n\nWhitetop Aster (Seriocarpus tortifolius (Michx.) Nees)\n\nIt was August 2016 when I took this photo at Torreya State Park near Bristol, Florida so this aster was a little past its prime.Â The good news is I was able to get a photo of it in seed and in bloom. Â\n\nProbably no other genus of plants has undergone such a revision as the genus Aster.Â In the 1974 printing of The New Britton and Brown Illustrated Flora of the Northeastern United States and Adjacent Canada (which I much depended on in grad school), the author estimates 250 species of Aster in North America and lists 67 species for northeastern U.S. and Canada.36Â\n\nI collected 12 species of Aster in Tishomingo during my days at Ole Miss.37\n\nToday, all but two species (A. alpinus and A. tataricus) have been moved to other genera.38Â In reality, that probably makes a lot of sense.Â Aster gave me fits in identification because it seems a loose aggregation of plants with somewhat similar qualities. Â\n\nSolidago multiradiata Aiton\n\nNorthern Goldenrod (Solidago multiradiata Aiton)\n\nWhen I was a kid growing up, my grandmother on my motherâs side suffered from hay fever.Â She, like most people, assumed it was from goldenrods.Â She would have me pull up any goldenrod found anywhere near her house.Â Unfortunately for her, it was not goldenrod but ragweed (Ambrosia) that was the cause of her hay fever and it was in abundance in a ditch alongside her house.Â\n\nLike the genus Aster, Solidago has undergone significant revision since I was in graduate school but nothing like that of Aster.Â Flora of North America currently lists 77 species.39 I was able to collect 11 species in Tishomingo.40\n\nThis seems to be one of the more common species in the western U.S. and Canada.Â I photographed it in Yellowstone, and several places in British Columbia.\n\nNorthern Goldenrod (Solidago multiradiata Aiton)\n\nThere are ray and disc flowers in each head and most of the leaves are basal.Â Stem leaves do occur when the plant is in bloom.41\n\nSolidago curtisii Torrey & A. Gray\n\nMountain Decumbent Goldenrod (Solidago curtisii Torrey & A.Gray)\n\nThe term decumbent means the plant often falls over and the the upper portion of the plant begins to rise again. This was photographed in Cloudland Canyon State Park in northern Georgia. Â\n\nMountain Decumbent Goldenrod (Solidago curtisii Torrey & A.Gray)\n\nYou can just make out a little pubescence on the leaves. Â\n\nSolidago stricta Aiton\n\nWand Goldenrod (Solidago stricta Aiton)\n\nItâs funny about plants.Â Sometimes, you are out photographing and you run across a single species.Â As you continue, you run into it again, and again, and again.Â That one species can dominate the genera in that area.Â Other times, you may run across three or four different species of the same genus in one place. Â\n\nIn the case of S. stricta, this was the only species of goldenrod in Kissimmee Prairie State Park. Â\n\nWhatâs interesting about this species is the very needle-like leaves on the stem and the close adherence of the heads to the long axis of the stem.\n\nWand Goldenrod (Solidago stricta Aiton)\n\nYou can see why it might deserve the common name of wand.\n\nStenotus acaulis (Nuttall) Nuttall\n\nStemless Goldenweed (Stenotus acaulis (Nuttall) Nuttall)\n\nWell, virtually stemless, anyway (the term acaulis means without stem).Â The stems that support the head of flowers is really short.Â There are both ray and disc flowers present.Â This genus has undergone several revisions.Â At one time it as in the genus Chrysopsis and later it was placed in the genus Haplopappus.42Â Nuttall seems to have had the last word.Â\n\nAs you can see, itâs in a pretty dry looking environment - also very hot due to thermal vents at the Upper Geyser Basin of Yellowstone.\n\nChrysothamnus greenei (A. Gray) Greene\n\nRabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus greenei (A. Gray) Greene)\n\nThe identification of this is compliments of the naturalist at Great Sand Dunes National Park.Â Otherwise, I would not have been able to make heads or tails out of this.Â It has a naked sagebrush look to me.\n\nRabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus greenei (A. Gray) Greene)\n\nThe greenei comes from the name of the botanist but it does indeed have green stems.Â There were no flowers on the plant when I took the photo but Flora has it with only disc flowers.43\n\nIf you remember, there was another genus of plants referred to as rabbitbrush: Ericameria.Â It seems to be a popular common name for several genera of plants.\n\nTownsendia incana Nuttall\n\nSilvery Townsendia (Townsendia incana Nuttall)\n\nI really like this flower.Â It makes bare minimum of leaves and puts a lot of energy into large flowers which really stand out in an arid environment.Â I had never encountered the genus before and since my western travels, I now have two species: this and T.Â exscapa.\n\nI found T. incana on the roadside of Capitol Gorge Road at Capitol Reef National Park.Â Iâm sure people thought me nuts for pulling off the road as soon as I could and walking back in the heat of the day for the photo.Â It wouldnât be the firstÂ people thought me crazy and Iâm sure it will not be the last.\n\nTownsendia exscapa (Richardson) Porter\n\nStemless Townsendia (Townsendia exscapa (Richardson) Porter)\n\nIf anything, this is even more attractive than T. incana.Â I was hiking the Ridgeline Trail in Theodore Roosevelt National Park when I noticed this along side the trail.Â At first, when I glanced down, I thought it was a cactus in bloom.Â A closer examination revealed it was a composite.Â I like how there is a tinge of pink in the unopened flowers.\n\nChaetopappa effusa (A. Gray) Shinners\n\nSpreading Leastdaisy (Chaetopappa effusa (A. Gray) Shinners)\n\nFlora of North America reports eight species of this genus in North America, all of which are found in Texas and with five of the eight restricted to Texas.44Â C. effuse is one of those restricted to Texas.Â Iâm not in 100% agreement with the description of the species provided by Flora but after reading the other seven descriptions, C. effusa is the best choice.Â On that, I guess you can say Iâm 90% sure this is the correct species.Â\n\nMy real difference with the description is based on the number of ray and disc flowers.Â Flora reports 6-9 ray flowers and 4-7 disc flowers.45Â As you can see, both fall below that number in this flower.Â However, the other descriptions donât match too well either. Â\n\nSpreading Leastdaisy (Chaetopappa effusa (A. Gray) Shinners)\n\nWhat does match the description is the leaf structure and type.Â Itâs pretty distinct. Â\n\nIn any case, I found this while hiking the East/West Trail at Lost Maples State Natural Area near Vanderpool, Texas.Â Those flowers really stood out amid the tangled mass of leaves.\n\nPityopsis graminifolia (Michx.) Nuttall\n\nGolden Aster (Pityopsis graminifolia (Michx.) Nuttall)\n\nThe term graminifolia refers to the grass-like leaves along the stem.Â They really are about the length and width of a grass blade but unlike grasses which are two-ranked on a stem, these leaves are individual and alternately arranged on the stem.\n\nGolden Aster (Pityopsis graminifolia (Michx.) Nuttall)\n\nThe stem and leaves are covered in silvery hairs which adds to the grass-like appearance.Â Iâve photographed this in several locations: Cloudland Canyons State Park, Kissimmee Prairie Preserve State Park, and Myakka River State Park. Â\n\nLeave it to me to overdo a hike.Â I was hiking the five mile West Rim Trail Loop at Cloudland Canyons State Park, enjoying the wildflowers (like this golden aster) and the scenery.Â I visited two waterfalls and was making my way back to my starting point at my cabin.Â Every cabin on the trail was marked except for guess which one?Â I walked past my cabin for another mile before I realized my mistake and had to cut across the trail and back down the park road to find the cabin again. Â\n\nHeterotheca villosa (Pursh) Shinners\n\nHairy Goldaster (Heterotheca villosa (Pursh) Shinners)Â\n\nThere are 17 species of Heterotheca in the Flora46 and nine varieties of H. villosa and of those nine varieties, they vary significantly in leaf shape, size, pubescence and just about every other character you can think of.47Â In other words, itâs a pain to identify, but I think Iâm OK on this.\n\nHeterotheca is mostly a western species.Â At least it is now.Â I collected two species in Tishomingo: H. mariana and H. nervosa.48Â Those have been removed from the genus.Â H. nervosa is now Pityopsis graminifolia var. nervosa (I thought it looked familiar) and H. mariana is now Chrysopsis mariana. Â\n\nI thought I was losing my mind with this genus because everything looked like it belonged to what I knew as Heterotheca and it wasnât.Â Reclassification can be a real pain once youâve been away from the field of study for any length of time.\n\nIâve photographed it in various locations and in each location, the plant looks a little different from the previous. Â\n\nErigeron concinnus (Hooker & Arnott) Torrey & A. Gray\n\nTidy Fleabane (Erigeron concinnus (Hooker & Arnott) Torrey & A. Gray)\n\nThis genus is collectively referred to as the fleabanes.Â Iâve never tried it as a flea repellent but you can give it a try. Â\n\nItâs a large genus with 173 species reported in North America.49Â A lot of them look very similar to each other and you have to be rather careful in trying to identify them in the field or with photographs so my identifications are best guesses based on location and plant checklists of the area as well as matching images with different guides and the internet. Â\n\nI like the common name of this one because it does grow quite tidily in a group or clump.\n\nTidy Fleabane (Erigeron concinnus (Hooker & Arnott) Torrey & A. Gray)\n\nBoth the stems and leaves may be densely hairy and even glandular.Â When I think of the genus, I often think of a large number of ray flowers with a fairly flat head of disc flowers.Â In this case, the disc flowers form more of a cone.Â I also find the petals can vary from white to pink to slightly blue in different species. Â\n\nThis particular species seems to be more western in distribution50 and I photographed it on the north rim of the Grand Canyon.\n\nErigeron foliosus Nuttall\n\nLeafy Fleabane (Erigeron foliosus Nuttall)\n\nThis plant is restricted to the state of California.51Â I photographed it at Point Reyes National Seashore in September of 2016.Â I found it on the trail to Chimney Rock at the historic lifeboat station near Point Reyes Light.Â The leaves are very distinct for fleabanes and they look leathery.Â\n\nLeafy Fleabane (Erigeron foliosus Nuttall)\n\nTo be honest, I didnât recognize it as a fleabane at first.Â It had more Aster characteristics to me, but as I pointed out previously, that genus has mostly been replaced.Â I also like the blue tint of the flowers on this one.Â The rays were rather long and overall, the flower heads were much larger than what I think of fleabanes.\n\nMost of Chimney Rock was closed off to the public.Â Recent earthquakes in the area had weakened the cliffs and the park service was afraid people would fall into the sea. Â\n\nErigeron philadelphicus L.\n\nPhiladelphia Fleabane (Erigeron philadelphicus L.)\n\nThis has to be the most widely distributed fleabane in North America.Â Itâs not reported in Alaska, Arizona nor Utah, but otherwise, it blankets the country.52Â It was also the very first fleabane I ever collected and still the most familiar to me. Â\n\nPhiladelphia Fleabane (Erigeron philadelphicus L.)\n\nItâs this plant to which I compare all other fleabanes.Â What is so distinctive to me about this plant is the almost needle-like ray flowers.Â Sometimes the plant is quite hairy.Â If you are going to run into a fleabane, this is probably the one.Â Look for it along roadsides, fields, and disturbed areas.\n\nErigeron quercifolius L.\n\nOakleaf Fleabane (Erigeron quercifolius L.)\n\nI suppose if you squint, the leaves do have a vague resemblance to member of oak genus.\n\nGambelâs Oak (Quercus gambelii Nuttall)\n\nOakleaf Fleabane (Erigeron quercifolius L.)\n\nÂ This is reported to be a plant of the coastal plain of the southeast.Â Itâs reported in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia.53\n\nI photographed this particular one at Lake George State Forest in Florida.Â Florida, as a state, is mostly coastal plain.Â\n\nErigeron pulchellus Michaux\n\nHairy Fleabane (Erigeron pulchellus Michaux)\n\nThis is widely distributed in the eastern U.S. and Canada54 and also one of the more common ones you may encounter.Â Unfortunately, the day I photographed these, it was after a night of heavy rainfall, and like me, they looked a little drowned. Â\n\nHairy Fleabane (Erigeron pulchellus Michaux)\n\nThe leaves are mostly basal and the stems are quite hairy. Â\n\nHairy Fleabane (Erigeron pulchellus Michaux)\n\nEven with the beating by the rain the night before, some of the seeds on the head were still in place.Â These were taken on the Deep Creek Trail in the Smokies.\n\nErigeron peregrinus (Banks ex Pursh) Greene\n\nWandering Fleabane (Erigeron peregrinus (Banks ex Pursh) Greene)\n\nThis is strictly a western Canadian species except for Washington state.55Â I photographed it on the Black Forest trail in The Bugaboos in August of 2051.Â For some reason, I failed to take any photos of the leaves.Â Iâll chalk it up to disorientation due to altitude. Â\n\nBlack Forest Peak, The Bugaboos, British Columbia\n\nErigeron glacialis (Nuttall) A. Nelson\n\nSubalpine Fleabane (Erigeron glacialis (Nuttall) A. Nelson)\n\nI originally misidentified this as E. peregrinus until I was able to look in Flora of North America and find E. peregrinus is not found in Oregon.56Â After a little reading and searching, I realized it is E. glacialis - I think.Â At least, itâs found in Oregon where I photographed this.\n\nSubalpine Fleabane (Erigeron glacialis (Nuttall) A. Nelson)\n\nThis was all around the Castle Crest Wildflower Trail at Crater Lake. Â\n\nErigeron glabellus Nuttall\n\nSmooth Fleabane (Erigeron glabellus Nuttall)\n\nI photographed this in two places out west: Grand Teton and Lake Louise, Alberta.Â The Alberta plants were a little bedraggled.Â It had rained the night before.Â This photo is from Signal Mountain, Grand Teton and it was a beautiful sunny day, so the flower was happy.\n\nThe rays of the head of flowers reminds me of Philadelphia fleabane. Â\n\nErigeron glaucus Ker Gawler\n\nSeaside Daisy (Erigeron glaucus Ker Gawler)\n\nI had never seen a growth form like this on Erigeron, but it was California. Â\n\nSeaside Daisy (Erigeron glaucus Ker Gawler)\n\nThe seaside part of the name certainly applies since I photographed it on the Lands End Trail in San Francisco.Â On a different trip, I photographed it again on Twin Peaks in San Francisco. Â\n\nErigeron annuus (L.) Persoon\n\nDaisy Fleabane (Erigeron annuus (L.) Persoon)\n\nThis is another common species in the eastern U.S. and another one I had previously collected at Tishomingo.57Â This was photographed along the Deep Creek Trail in the Smokies in 2016.Â Itâs a prolific bloomer with numerous heads per plant.Â The needle-like rays remind me also of E. philadelphicus.\n\nErigeron sionis Cronquist\n\nZion Fleabane (Erigeron sionis Cronquist)\n\nFlora of North America lists this as of conservation concern.58Â The plant is native to only southern Utah and it is found within Zion National Park from which it derives its name.Â This was growing along the roadside of the park. Â\n\nEurybia integrifolia (Nuttall) G.L. Nesom\n\nThickstem Aster (Eurybia integrifolia (Nuttall) G.L. Nesom)\n\nAt one time, this was identified as Aster integrifolius but G.L. Nesom made major revisions to the genus Aster and place this in the genus Eurybia.Â It is, indeed, thick stemmed.Â Otherwise, thereâs not much to this but it could be due to the harsh environmental conditions.Â The photo was taken at an overlook of the Upper Falls of the Yellowstone.\n\nThickstem Aster (Eurybia integrifolia (Nuttall) G.L. Nesom)\n\nThis shows the bloom a little better.\n\nEurybia chlorolepis (E.S. Burgess) G.L. Nesom\n\nMountain Wood Aster (Eurybia chlorolepis (E.S. Burgess) G.L. Nesom)\n\nThis was a Cloudland Canyon find along the West Rim Trail of the park.Â The leaves were quite large and yet the flowers a little small for the size of the leaves of the plant. Â\n\nDieteria canescens (Pursh) Nuttall\n\nHoary Aster (Dieteria canescens (Pursh) Nuttall)\n\nThis was originally considered one of the many species of Aster.Â It was then placed in the genus Machaeranthera, and now is has landed in the genus Dieteria with 10 varieties listed in Flora of North America.59Â Regardless, itâs a pretty flower. Â\n\nHoary Aster (Dieteria canescens (Pursh) Nuttall)\n\nThe involucre surrounding the head of ray and disc flowers is rather robust and the leaves are linear.Â I found this in several locations along the north rim of the Grand Canyon.\n\nNotice how coarse and rough the bracts of the involucre are (just beneath the ray flowers).Â The leaves are also toothed as well as in-folded.Â The infolding is probably to retard water loss during the hot summer months.\n\nGrindelia squarrosa (Pursh) Dunal\n\nCurly-top Gumweed (Grindelia squarrosa (Pursh) Dunal)\n\nIt looks as though this bloom is not fully open but in reality, sometimes it has large ray flowers and sometimes it doesnât.Â What you are seeing here are only the disc flowers.Â The common name perhaps gives you an idea it tends to be rather glandular along the stems, leaves, and involucres providing a sticky residue.\n\nCurly-top Gumweed (Grindelia squarrosa (Pursh) Dunal)\n\nThe involucre tips recurve to give it a hooked appearance.Â My exposure to this plant was on the north rim of the Grand Canyon.Â Where it grew, it grew abundantly. Â\n\nExcept for a couple of species, Grindelia is mostly western in distribution.60\n\nGrindelia hirsutula Hooker & Arnott\n\nPacific Gumplant(Grindelia hirsutula Hooker & Arnott)\n\nMy next exposure to Grindelia (at least it was familiar to me now) was at the lighthouse at Point Reyes National Seashore.Â This was growing along the âroadâ to the lighthouse from the parking lot. Â\n\nPacific Gumplant(Grindelia hirsutula Hooker & Arnott)\n\nAs I wrote early, I have a real reticence to photograph and try to identify members of the aster family but when I saw that this plant crawled along the ground and then saw the recurved involucres, I figured how hard could it be to identify?Â As it turned out, not very hard.\n\nWhen I visited the lighthouse in September of 2016, it was in need of repair.\n\nPoint Reyes Lighthouse - Point Reyes National Seashore\n\nThe good news is that it is undergoing an extensive renovation.Â It was due to reopen in the early summer of 2019 but that has been pushed back until December 31, 2019 (National Park Service).Â They beat their deadline.Â It reopened to the public in November of 2019.\n\nSymphyotrichum patens (Aiton) G.L. Neson\n\nÂ Â Late Purple Aster (Symphyotrichum patens (Aiton) G.L. Neson)\n\nYou are about to get a run of G.L. Neson as the authority for the naming of a plant.Â When I was collecting and identifying back in 1974-1977, this genus had one questionable species, but in 1994, Nesom re-established the genus and placed within the genus many species that were once in the genus Aster (Wikipedia). Â\n\nAs I mentioned before, I had previously met Arthur Cronquist, the then expert on the Asteraceae, when in graduate school.Â It seems Nesom, who did his graduate work at UNC Chapel Hill - perhaps the best school for taxonomy in the U.S. - has now become the expert in the family (Wikipedia).Â The torch has been passed. Â\n\nI havenât read any of his papers for his justification for re-establishing the gneus Symphyotrichum,Â but they all still look like Aster to me. Â\n\nÂ\n\nLate Purple Aster (Symphyotrichum patens (Aiton) G.L. Neson)\n\nThis is an eastern species and as the common name indicates, it a late bloomer in the fall of the year.Â There are three varieties, all eastern in distribution.61\n\nThese particular photos were made at Cloudland Canyons State Park in northern Georgia.\n\nSymphyotrichum adnatum (Nuttall) G.L. Nesom\n\nScaleleaf Aster (Symphyotrichum adnatum (Nuttall) G.L. Nesom)\n\nA lot of the asters are late bloomers and this one was photographed in October of 2017 at Kissimmee Prairie Preserve State Park in Florida. The scales are small enough they donât show on the photograph at all. Â\n\nThis is a very delicate aster and it was growing mostly in the ditches alongside the road into the park.\n\nÂ\n\nSymphyotrichum ericoides (L.) G. L. Nesom\n\nWhite Heath Aster (Symphyotrichum ericoides (L.) G.L. Nesom)\n\nThis was along the East/West Trail of Lost Maples State Natural Area near Vanderpool, Texas.Â I photographed it in September of 2016. Â\n\nWhite Heath Aster (Symphyotrichum ericoides (L.) G.L. Nesom)\n\nI probably would not have bothered except the leaf structure was unique enough to give me pause.Â I figured I could identify it based on the leaves and the pubescence on the stem and leaves - and itâs location. Â\n\nAs it happens, location was not a big help in the identification. Â It is widely distributed across the U.S. and Canada.62\n\nSymphyotrichum cordifolium (L.) G.L. Nesom\n\nHeart-leafed Aster (Symphyotrichum cordifolium (L.) G.L. Nesom)\n\nI would probably describe the leaves as clasping arrow-head shaped but Iâll go with heart-leafed since it sounds nicer.Â These were roadside on the road from Cherokee, N.C. to Gatlinburg, Tennessee across Newfound Gap.Â\n\nÂ Â\n\nNewfound Gap, of course, was a low point, relatively speaking, that allowed a path to go through the Smokies.Â\n\nItâs also part of the Appalachian Trail which begins in north Georgia at Springer Mountain and goes to Katahdin, Maine. Â The trail is 2,200 miles in length.Â When you reach Newfound Gap, you only have 1,972 miles to go. Â\n\nSymphyotrichum retroflexum (Linley ex de Candolle) G.L. Nesom\n\nRigid Whitetop Aster (Symphyotrichum retroflexum (Lindley ex de Candolle) G.L. Nesom)\n\nIn spite of the common name, it does come in blue.Â Again, this was a roadside bloomer in the Smokies.\n\nSymphyotrichum elliottii (Torrey & A. Gray) G.L. Nesom\n\nElliottâs Aster (Symphyotrichum elliottii (Torrey & A. Gray) G.L. Nesom)\n\nThis was among the alligators in the Big Cypress Preserve in Florida.Â I had to use a telephoto to get the shot since the gator was a wee bit close.\n\nSymphyotrichum foliaceum (Lindley ex de Candolle) G.L. Nesom\n\nLeafybract Aster (Symphyotrichum foliaceum (Lindley ex de Candolle) G.L. Nesom)\n\nThis was a stunner, particularly where it was found - British Columbia and Alberta in, for them, summer but for me early spring. Â\n\nI first saw it growing along the shore of Lake Louise, then Eva Lake in The Bugaboos.Â We had just started the hike when we got a grizzly warning and were hurriedly evacuated by helicopter.Â\n\nEva Lake, Prior to the Grizzly Evacuation\n\nThe rays of the head of flowers have some of the most intense purple Iâve seen in a plant.\n\nSenecio integerrinus Nuttall\n\nWestern Groundsel (Senecio integerrimus Nuttall)\n\nI was first introduced to the genus Senecio with my work at Tishomingo State Park.Â There was one species that bloomed early in the spring and it was always a treat to find for three springs at the park. Â\n\nTherefore, I was excited when I went out west and found Senecio out there.Â However, there came a period of doubt on my identifications.Â Plants that I would have guaranteed you were the genus Senecio were listed in the genus Packera. Â\n\nI later learned that Senecio had undergone a major revision and many species I knew as Senecio were now placed in the genus Packera.Â I guess you really do never stop learning. Â\n\nWestern Groundsel (Senecio integerrimus Nuttall)\n\nThereâs not much I donât like about this genus.Â Many members of the genus have a basal rosette of leaves and the leaves are often well differentiated between species.Â The stem leaves can be quite different from the basal leaves and the flowers were easy to dissect and discern characteristics.Â Whatâs not to love?\n\nIâve photographed this in two locations: Yellowstone and Black Canyon of the Gunnison.\n\nSenecio triangularis Hooker\n\nArrowleaf Ragwort (Senecio triangularis Hooker)\n\nThe leaves are very distinctive in this species.Â The head of flowers simply looks like Senecio.Â\n\nArrowleaf Ragwort (Senecio triangularis Hooker)\n\nAgain, I photographed this plant in two different locations: Crater Lake and The Bugaboos, British Columbia. Â\n\nThere are two common names associated with Senecio: groundsel and ragwort.Â Groundsel possible comes from Middle English which refers to swallow (Dictionary.com) which is associated with poultices.Â Ragwort, I can only suppose.Â âwortâ means plant and these can get a little ragged after a hard rain.\n\nSenecio serra Hooker\n\nTall Groundsel (Senecio serra Hooker)\n\nThis has to be one of the most unusual Senecio Iâve come across in my studies and my trips.Â Iâve never seen an array of flowers like this.Â Usually, with Senecio, the heads of flowers are rather sparse. Â\n\nI donât know where they got the âtallâ idea.Â These were all pretty short in size but it could be due to habitat. Â\n\nPackera anonyma (Alph Wood) W. A. Weber & Ã LÃ¶ve\n\nSmallâs Packera (Packera anonyma (Alph Wood) W. A. Weber & Ã LÃ¶ve)\n\nThis has several synonyms under the genus Senecio and I suspect I have collected it under the older names.Â It seems very familiar to me as a Senecio.Â\n\nSmallâs Packera (Packera anonyma (Alph Wood) W. A. Weber & Ã LÃ¶ve)\n\nI photographed this around the campsite at High Falls State Park near Jackson, Georgia. Â\n\nPackera aurea (L.) Ã LÃ¶ve & D. LÃ¶ve\n\nGolden Ragwort (Packera aurea (L.) Ã LÃ¶ve & D. LÃ¶ve)\n\nThis, at one time, was Senecio aureus and was one of those I collected at Tishomingo.63Â It is still one of my favorites.Â This is definitely an eastern species64 and easily recognized by its leaves.\n\nI always look for this in wooded areas with moist soil.Â\n\nPhotographs were taken on the Wolfden Loop of the Pine Mountain Trail near Warm Springs, Georgia and the Smokemont Loop Trail in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.Â Â\n\nPackera glabella (Poiret) C. Jeffrey\n\nButterweed (Packera glabella (Poiret) C. Jeffrey)\n\nButterweed is another common name for Packera/Senecio species.Â I think it has to do with the color of the flowers.Â I came across this one along the roadside of Nature Coast bike trail near Manatee Springs, Florida. Â\n\nButterweed (Packera glabella (Poiret) C. Jeffrey)\n\nThis is a pretty tall plant.Â I think I remember it reaching 1 1/2-2 feet in height.Â The stems are interesting and it looks as though there are lines running down the length of the stems.\n\nPackera multilobata (Torrey & A. Gray) W. A. Weber & Ã LÃ¶veÂ\n\nUinta Groundsel (Packera multilobata (Torrey & A. Gray) W. A. Weber & Ã LÃ¶ve)\n\nMy first encounter with this was at Dead Horse Point State Park in Utah.Â I later ran into it again at Zion and then in 2018 at Capitol Reef.Â Itâs concentrated in eight states of the southwest: California, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, Colorado, and Idaho. Â\n\nWhat stands out to me with this plant are the really deeply pinnately divided leaves. Â\n\nUinta Groundsel (Packera multilobata (Torrey & A. Gray) W. A. Weber & Ã LÃ¶ve)\n\nI have no idea as to how to pronounce Uinta but it is a common name in the desert southwest.Â The U.S. Forest Service says it is from the Ute word which means pine tree or pine forest.\n\nPackera obovata (Muhlenberg ex Willdenow) W. A. Weber & Ã LÃ¶ve\n\nRound-leaf Groundsel (Packera obovata (Muhlenberg ex Willdenow) W. A. Weber & Ã LÃ¶ve)\n\nThe basal leaves are round and are distinctly different from the stem leaves of the plant.Â This was in wet woods near Brandywine Falls at Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Â\n\nPackera pauciflora (Pursh) Ã LÃ¶ve & D. LÃ¶ve\n\nRayless Alpine Groundsel (Packera pauciflora (Pursh) Ã LÃ¶ve & D. LÃ¶ve)\n\nI really had no idea as to the genus when I first stumbled across this.Â I probably had a touch of altitude sickness at the time and for a while, I couldnât discern the leaves of the plant.Â Later, I found them but then when I examined the head of flowers, I was even more confused.Â Rayless Alpine Groundsel (Packera pauciflora (Pursh) Ã LÃ¶ve & D. LÃ¶ve)\n\nThatâs a very deep purple for any flower.Â I assume the flowers were not open.\n\nRayless Alpine Groundsel (Packera pauciflora (Pursh) Ã LÃ¶ve & D. LÃ¶ve)\n\nHere the flowers are fully open.Â The story is these have no rays.Â They are all disc flowers.Â I didnât know that at the time and it took me quite a while to pin down a name on these.\n\nRayless Alpine Groundsel (Packera pauciflora (Pursh) Ã LÃ¶ve & D. LÃ¶ve)\n\nI photographed these at Dead Elk Lake (very descriptive) in The Bugaboos, British Columbia. Â\n\nIt seems a shame to name such a pretty lake, Dead Elk Lake. Â\n\nPackera tridenticulata (Rydberg) W. A. Weber & Ã LÃ¶ve\n\nThree-toothed Groundsel (Packera tridenticulata (Rydberg) W. A. Weber & Ã LÃ¶ve)\n\nI thought I would show you why it is called three-toothed groundsel.Â If you look at the tips of the leaves, there are three small lobes.\n\nThree-toothed Groundsel (Packera tridenticulata (Rydberg) W. A. Weber & Ã LÃ¶ve)\n\nAgain, these are more typical of Packera/Senecio flowers with a few rays and more than a few disc flowers. Â\n\nThis was on the Medano Pass Primitive Road of Great Sand Dunes National Park. Â\n\nIf you drive the Medano Pass Primitive Road, make sure (1) you have four-wheel drive (2) a portable air pump to re-inflate your tires and (3) plenty of water in case you get stranded. Â\n\nEmilia sonchifolia (L.) de Candolle\n\nLavender Tasselflower (Emilia sonchifolia (L.) de Candolle)\n\nThe first time I saw this was in my yard.Â It took me a while to identify it since Flora of North America65Â reports it as a pan-tropical weed from Asia.Â I like the color of the disc flowers - there are no ray flowers.\n\nKey to identification of this species is the leaf. Â\n\nLavender Tasselflower (Emilia sonchifolia (L.) de Candolle)\n\nThe leaf almost looks perfoliate but it is actually termed âclaspingâ the stem. You can see where the base of the leaf is open around the stem.\n\nLavender Tasselflower (Emilia sonchifolia (L.) de Candolle)\n\nThe achenes have a fine pappus attached to the top of the achene and you can see the similarity to dandelions.\n\nEmilia fosbergii Nicolson\n\nRed Tassleflower (Emilia fosbergii Nicolson)\n\nWhen my dog Rocky was alive, he always wanted to see new sights and travel new paths.Â He would vary his walks around the neighborhood, one day heading east, another day south, another day....Â One of his favorite walks was by the Boys and Girls Club in my neighborhood.Â At the intersection of the street I saw this spot of red color.Â I had already photographed E. sonchifolia and at first I thought this was the same.Â However, the leaf structure is significantly different.\n\nRed Tassleflower (Emilia fosbergii Nicolson)\n\nEvery time we walked past the place, I kept tabs on the plant.Â Every so often, the landowner would mow but this kept coming back after each mow.Â Itâs a hardy little weed. It is also introduced from Asia like E. sonchifolia.66 Â\n\nArnoglossum floridanum (A. Gray) H. Robinson\n\nFlorida Indian Plantain (Arnoglossum floridanum (A. Gray) H. Robinson)\n\nThere are eight species of Arnoglossum in the Flora and two are exclusive to Florida: A. floridanum and A. album which is restricted to two counties in Florida.67\n\nFlorida Indian Plantain (Arnoglossum floridanum (A. Gray) H. Robinson)\n\nFrom the first photo, you can see stem leaves but there is also a basal rosette at the base of the stem.Â The basal rosette of leaves definitely looks like some species of plantain.\n\nFlorida Indian Plantain (Arnoglossum floridanum (A. Gray) H. Robinson)\n\nThis had already bloomed (disc flowers only) and had already dispersed most of its seed.Â This was quite abundant along the Sink Hole Trail at Silver Springs State Park.Â You can see the papas attached to achenes.\n\nTetradymia canescens de Candolle\n\nHorsebrush(Tetradymia canescens de Candolle)\n\nThis is a western genus with 10 species in North America.68Â They are all shrubs.Â\n\nHorsebrush(Tetradymia canescens de Candolle)\n\nThe leaves have a pubescence on the leaves giving a silver color.\n\nI much appreciate the NPS labeling the plant on their nature trail at Great Sand Dunes National Park.\n\nTetradymia axillaris A. Nelson\n\nCotton Thorn (Tetradymia axillaris A. Nelson)\n\nThis plant is very anti-social.Â Those are some of the longest thorns Iâve seen on a plant.Â This was on a trail near Jumbo Rocks campground at Joshua Tree National Park.\n\nPetasites frigidus(L.) Fries\n\nColtsfoot (Petasites frigidus (L.) Fries)\n\nI have no idea why this is called coltsfoot.Â You canât spend too much time in the west before you start hearing about this plant from some naturalist.Â For a while, I was never able to catch it in bloom. Â\n\nThere are heads of flowers that are all staminate and other heads that are all pistillate.Â There is only one species in North America but there are four varieties.69\n\nColtsfoot (Petasites frigidus (L.) Fries)\n\nI finally found some that were just about to bloom.\n\nColtsfoot (Petasites frigidus (L.) Fries)\n\nAnd finally - success!\n\nColtsfoot (Petasites frigidus (L.) Fries)\n\nTo be honest, I canât determine if these are ray or disc flowers from the photo and I didnât make any notation when I took the image.Â I also have no idea if this is staminate or pistillate in nature.\n\nMelampodium leucanthum Torrey & A. Gray\n\nBlackfoot Daisy (Melampodium leucanthum Torrey & A. Gray)\n\nThis was photographed along The Windows Trail at Big Bend in September of 2016.Â It was a startling white. Â\n\nBlackfoot Daisy (Melampodium leucanthum Torrey & A. Gray)\n\nOther than the bloom, what attracted me was the decussate arrangement of the leaves to maximize sun absorption. Â\n\nThe Windows Trail - Big Bend National Park\n\nRudbeckia hirta L.\n\nBlack-eyed Susan (Rudbeckia hirta L.)\n\nI was surprised to see 23 species of Rubeckia listed in Flora of North America,70 especially since Iâve only collected three.71Â This old friend is the most widespread species in North America.72Â\n\nIt was common along the roadsides of Mississippi and was probably one of the first composites I learned to identify.Â Iâve pretty much seen it everywhere in my travels and often donât photograph it but this cluster was particularly attractive to me.\n\nÂ Ratibida columnifera (Nuttall) Wooton & Standley\n\nPrairie Coneflower (Ratibida columnifera (Nuttall) Wooten & Stanley)\n\nThere are four species of Ratibida in North America and R. columnifera is the most wide spread.73Â\n\nWhat I find fascinating about this particular flower is the variations you can find in form and color.Â The first photo was at Devilâs Tower.\n\nPrairie Coneflower (Ratibida columnifera (Nuttall) Wooten & Stanley)\n\nThis photo was taken at Lost Maples State Natural Area in Texas.Â Regardless, cone flowers are noted for the cone-like receptacles that project above the involucre. Â\n\nIâve seen a lot of places that sell wildflower seeds with coneflowers as one of the seeds in the packet, so I guess itâs a popular sell.Â I can see why.\n\nPrairie Coneflower (Ratibida columnifera (Nuttall) Wooten & Stanley)\n\nI think I prefer the dark maroon colored ray flowers.Â Also note the very small disc flowers atop the cone.\n\nZinnia acerosa (de Candolle) A. Gray\n\nDesert Zinnia (Zinnia acerosa (de Candolle) A. Gray)\n\nOne of the houses our family lived in Morton, Mississippi was a home owned and rented out by Mr. Lawler.Â Dad worked for the Mississippi Highway Department and we moved all over the state - sometimes three times in one year.Â We stayed at the gray Lawler House for a few years and as a consequence, Dad planted flowers in front of the large picture window at the front of the house.\n\nHe worked the seasons in that flower bed.Â In spring, he planted nasturtiums.Â In summer and fall, we had zinnias.Â I first learned to plant seed and impatiently wait for them to sprout.Â He then taught me the importance of separating those seedlings too close together. Â\n\nZinnas, as a consequence, have a lock on my memory bank.Â I was therefore pleasantly surprised to find there were wild zinnas.Â This was photographed at Saguaro National Park, Ricon Mountain District outside of Tucson.\n\nDesert Zinnia (Zinnia acerosa (de Candolle) A. Gray)\n\nUnlike domesticated zinnas, these have very small leaves for water retention and there is a conservation in the number of ray flowers.Â In reality, this doesnât look anything like the domesticated form.\n\nThere are five species in North America and four of those are western.Â Z. peurviana is most likely western but has been naturalized in the southeastern U.S.Â Z. violacea is not native but widely distributed throughout the southeastern U.S.74\n\nBack to gardening.Â On the side of the house which was situated on a sloping hill, Dad allowed me to plant a vegetable garden.Â I assume he was humoring me since a sloping hill of clay is not real good gardening terrain.Â Be that as it may, I planted butter beans (known outside the south as lima beans).Â They grew.Â He eventually had to âstickâ the beans to allow the runners of the beans to have a place to go.Â For some reason, the beans were prolific producers. Â\n\nDad had planted a garden at the base of the hill with much better soil and sunlight but my beans out performed his (or so he said).Â He kept saying the 5 or 6 beans I planted out produced his two rows.Â In reality, I donât think we got but one âmessâ of beans off my vines, but he was trying to encourage me.\n\nBerlandiera subacaulis (Nuttall) Nuttall\n\nFlorida Greeneyes (Berlandiera subacualis (Nuttall) Nuttall)\n\nI had just begun my bike trip from Fanning Springs State Park on my way to Trenton, Florida via the Nature Coast Trail when I saw this growing along the bikeway.Â I immediately stopped and got a photograph. Â\n\nWhat attracted my attention was the green center (disc flowers) of this composite with the yellow rays.Â Normally, you donât see green in disc flowers.Â What is occurring in this photograph is the unopened disc flowers are green.Â Those that have opened are the normal yellow.\n\nFlorida Greeneyes (Berlandiera subacualis (Nuttall) Nuttall)\n\nThe common name is very appropriate. Itâs only reported in the state of Florida.75\n\nEchinacea angustifolia de Candolle\n\nPurple Coneflower (Echinacea angustifolia de Candolle)\n\nEchinacea was one of those genera I was supposed to find during my Tishomingo days.Â Try as I might, I never found it within the confines of the park.Â After graduation, I ended up for a short time in Montana and then returned to be a park manager at Golden Memorial State Park outside of Walnut Grove, Mississippi. Â\n\nAs managers, we often traveled to a different park so the managers could get a feel for the variety of parks in the state.Â One such visit was to Tombigbee State Park outside of Tupelo, Mississippi.Â Guess what I found growing all over the park?Â It wasnât this species but it was Echinacea.Â Coincidentally, the common name of the one in Mississippi was also purple coneflower.\n\nPurple Coneflower (Echinacea angustifolia de Candolle)\n\nThis particular species is midwestern in distribution.76Â I first photographed it at Mount Rushmore in July of 2013 and then later the same month and year at Devilâs Tower, Wyoming.\n\nBalsamorhiza sagittata (Pursh) Nuttall\n\nArrow-leaved Balsamroot (Balsamorhiza sagittata (Pursh) Nuttall)\n\nIâve written about my reluctance of photographing and identifying members of the aster family.Â I had no such compunction with this species.Â Itâs big, itâs showy, and it has very distinctive characteristics.Â I figured I could identify it fairly easily.Â I was correct. Â\n\nThe genus Balsamorhiza is a western species with 12 species in North America but this is the only one with a single head of flowers with arrowhead-shaped leaves.77Â Itâs also a pretty good indicator of spring. Â\n\nArrow-leaved Balsamroot (Balsamorhiza sagittata (Pursh) Nuttall)\n\nYou can also see it from a distance.Â On one trip, I was traveling up Lake Chelan to Stehekin, Washington aboard the Lady Express.Â There are three ways into Stehekin: walk, fly into their small airport, or by boat.Â From the boat, I kept noticing these yellow patches on the sides of the mountains that surround the lake. Â\n\nI only had a small backpacking camera with me and the zoom feature wasnât enough for me to zero in but I vowed to find out what they were once ashore. Â\n\nLake Chelan on the Way to Stehekin, Washington\n\nTwo days later I was hiking the Lakeshore Trail at Stehekin and found my yellow flowers seen from the Lady Express.\n\nThe roots and seeds are considered edible (Wikipedia).\n\nVerbesina virginica L.\n\nWhite Crownbeard (Verbesina virginica L.)\n\nI knew I had seen this plant before.Â It looked just too familiar.Â I kept racking my brain about it.Â It took a while but it finally came to me.Â I had collected it at Tishomingo78 and, believe it or not, I remembered the genus.Â I have no idea how I did that.Â Itâs been 42 years ago that I did my graduate work in plants but every so often, a name comes back to me.\n\nWhite Crownbeard (Verbesina virginica L.)\n\nNotice the stem of the plant is winged (leaf-like ridges along the stem). Â\n\nWhite Crownbeard (Verbesina virginica L.)\n\nThe flowers are very delicate looking and almost a pure white.Â There are not many ray flowers and also just a few disc flowers per head.\n\nI first found it in my neighborhood which was really strange.Â My area is not a typical habitat for the plant.Â Where I found it, a neighbor typically placed bulk trash for pickup by the city.Â I suspect the neighbor had it either in some wildflower seeds or it was found in some mulch he purchased. Â\n\nI have since photographed it in Lost Maples State Natural Area near Vanderpool, Texas and at Myakka River State Park near Sarasota, Florida.\n\nThose ray flowers are a very pure white!\n\nEnceliopsis nudicaulis (A. Gray) A. Nelson\n\nNaked Stem Sunrays (Enceliopsis nudicaulis (A.Gray) A. Nelson)\n\nI found this little beauty on Chimney Rock Trail at Capitol Reef National Park. Â\n\nYears ago, when I went to work as a botanist/plant ecologist for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in Miles City, Montana (a short-lived job) I had to come up with some method of determining the density of plants.Â To be honest, I had never done that type of analysis and so I started to read up on the subject (they hired me in the winter so I had a lot of reading time). Â\n\nOne method very popular is the line transect method.Â I couldnât quite understand how that would work particularly since you would stretch a line over some area and identify and count the plants that touched the line.Â I kept defaulting to my experience in the southeastern U.S. where you would end up with three or four plants touching the same point on a line due to the massive quantity of vegetation in the south.\n\nIt finally dawned on me the line transect method was devised for the western U.S.Â You might through out a line for a transect and it maybe would have one or two plants that hit the line.Â Plants are much fewer and farther between in the west. Â\n\nIt was especially brought home with the BLM when they leased land for cattle grazing.Â It might take 10 acres of land to feed one cow out west because of the sparseness of the vegetation.\n\nNaked Stem Sunrays (Enceliopsis nudicaulis (A.Gray) A. Nelson)\n\nThe ânakedâ part comes from no leaves on the stem.Â Also note the abundance of very short hairs on the stem and the involucre, giving a âfrostyâ appearance.\n\nPhoebanthus grandiflorus (Torrey & A. Gray) S.F. Blake\n\nFlorida False Sunflower(Phoebanthus grandiflorus (Torrey & A. Gray) S.F. Blake)\n\nThere are two species of this plant in North America: P. grandiflorus and P. tenuifolius. The difference is basically in the width of the leaves.Â P. grandiflorus leaves are 3-7 mm wide and P. tenuifoliusÂ are 0.5-2 mm wide.Â P. grandiflorus is found only in Florida whereas P. tenuifolius is found in Florida and Alabama.79\n\nFlorida False Sunflower(Phoebanthus grandiflorus (Torrey & A. Gray) S.F. Blake)\n\nMy guess is these are at least 5mm in width.Â These photos were taken at Myakka River State Park near Sarasota, Florida.\n\nEncelia farinosa A. Gray ex Torrey\n\nBrittlebush (Encelia farinosa A. Gray ex Torrey)\n\nThere are eight species in North America and they are all found in the southwestern U.S.80\n\nBrittlebush (Encelia farinosa A. Gray ex Torrey)\n\nUnfortunately, I didnât capture this in bloom.Â It has large heads of yellow ray and disc flowers.Â The California Native Plant Society and Flora of North America81 both report fragrant leaves but donât provide any information as to the aroma.\n\nThis was photographed at the Desert Discovery Nature Trail (which had it labeled) at Saguaro National Park, Tuscon Mountain District.\n\nEncelia californica Nuttall\n\nBush Sunflower (Encelia californica Nuttall)\n\nIf you ever visit the Channel Islands National Park, I highly recommend you stop in at the visitor center in Ventura, California.Â I also highly recommend you first make your reservations for the boat to the islands six months in advance. Â\n\nWhile at the visitor center, be sure to walk through their wildflower garden.Â They label most plants and I learned what to look for in the Channel Islands based on the vegetation they had in the garden.\n\nThis particular plant is quite large and spreading.Â Itâs unusual to see sunflower type flowers on a shrub.Â The plant is found in coastal scrub of California.82\n\nGeraea canescens Torrey & A. Gray\n\nDesert Sunflower (Geraea canescens Torrey & A. Gray)\n\nThis is reported in four states: Arizona, California, Utah and Nevada.83Â I photographed it in Death Valley along the roadside.Â It certainly fits with the common name.Â\n\nDesert Sunflower (Geraea canescens Torrey & A. Gray)\n\nPerhaps, as interesting as the flower are the leaves with the very dense pubescence covering both sides and the stems.Â As I look at this photo, I now realize I missed another wildflower (white composite) just to the left of the main stem.Â Sometimes I get so focused on one thing and donât get the big picture.\n\nMelanthera nivea (L.) Small\n\nSnow Squarestem (Melanthera nivea (L.) Small)\n\nWell, the white flowers represent snow and the stems are definitely square, so the common name is appropriate.Â There are three species in the Flora: M. nivea (seven states including Florida) M. angustifolia (Florida only) and M. parvifolia (Florida only).84 Â\n\nSnow Squarestem (Melanthera nivea (L.) Small)\n\nThere typically are no ray flowers and, as you see, this is composed of all disc flowers.Â I like how the stigmas of the pistil curl backwards on themselves.\n\nIâve found this in two locations in Florida: Secret Garden Nature Center in Fort Lauderdale and Bahia Honda State Park. Normally, if I were to go based on location alone, this would be M. parvifolia.Â Itâs only found in the Florida Keys, particularly in Big Pine Key where you find Bahia Honda. Â\n\nHowever, the description for M. parvifolia states the heads of flowers are born singly at the tips of stems.Â The description for M. nivea states the heads of flowers are born in the axils of modified leaves.85Â The image shows the latter case.Â Such can be the distinction between two species.\n\nSphagneticola trilobata (L.) Pruski\n\nWedelia (Sphagneticola trilobata (L.) Pruski)\n\nConfusingly, there is a genus of plants Wedelia.Â The common name for this plant is Wedelia and it is in the genus Sphagneticola. Â\n\nThis was the first flower I probably learned when I came to Florida because it was everywhere in yards and roadsides.Â Itâs only reported in the state of Florida and its suggested it is a subtropical or tropical New World plant that has escaped.86\n\nÂ\n\nWedelia (Sphagneticola trilobata (L.) Pruski)\n\nI think a lot of people began to use it as a ground cover.Â It works well for that but can get out of control.Â The trilobata comes from the three lobes on some but not all of the leaves.\n\nEclipta prostrata (L.) L.\n\nFalse Daisy (Eclipta prosrtata (L.) L.)\n\nI collected this in Tishomingo back when it went by Eclipta alba.87Â Believe it or not, there are ray flowers on this head.Â They are simply very short and very small.Â The disc flowers are obvious in the center. Â\n\nFalse Daisy (Eclipta prostrata (L.) L.)\n\nThe leaves and stems are described as scabrellous.88Â In essence, the hairs on the stems and leaves life flat for the most part and appear as tiny scales. Â\n\nThis was photographed at Archbold Biological Station near Venus, Florida.Â However, it is widespread throughout the eastern U.S. and southwestern U.S.89Â\n\nBorrichia arborescens (L.) de Candolle\n\nSea Oxeye Daisy (Borrichia arborescens (L.) de Candolle)\n\nThis was forming mats at Bahia Honda State Park at Big Pine Key.Â The leaves and stems are very fleshy.\n\nSea Oxeye Daisy (Borrichia arborescens (L.) de Candolle)\n\nIn this photo, you can see salt crystals on the leaves.Â The plant was growing on the Atlantic side of the park.Â It is found only in the Florida Keys.90\n\nBorrichia frutescens (L.) de Candolle\n\nSea Oxeye Daisy (Borrichia frutescens (L.) de Candolle)\n\nThese, on the other hand, were growing upright, not in mats, and were smaller in size.Â\n\nSea Oxeye Daisy (Borrichia frutescens (L.) de Candolle)\n\nAlthough both (B. arborescens and B. frutescens) were growing in the same general location, there was a distinct difference in the colors of the foliage.Â Flora suggests this grows more in salt marsh or brackish water.91Â I remember it growing along a path towards the ocean in the same area as B. arborescens that could have been described as brackish when tides over flowed the area.\n\nCalyptocarpus vialis Lessing\n\nHorsemint (Calyptocarpus vialis Lessing)\n\nYou really have to be observant to see this plant.Â It grows like a ground cover here in Florida but more individually elsewhere in the U.S.Â The flowers are very tiny with just a few ray and disc flowers. Â\n\nThere is only one species in Flora of North America and that is restricted to five states: Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas.92\n\nI was used to seeing it in Florida along my walks with Rocky.Â I was very surprised when I found in growing in my campsite at Lost Maples State Natural Area in Texas.\n\nHelianthus annuus L.\n\nCommon Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.)\n\nThereâs absolutely nothing common about sunflowers.Â They always give a thrill when you see them and itâs even more fun to watch them track the sun over a dayâs time.\n\nThere are 52 species of Helianthus in the Flora93 and during my Tishomingo days, I collected four of those.94Â None have the impact of H. annuus.Â Itâs found in all 48 contiguous states and most of Canada.95\n\nViguiera stenoloba S.F. Blake\n\nSkeletonleaf Goldeneye (Viguiera stenoloba S.F. Blake)\n\nThis was growing outside the lodge at Big Bend National Park.Â It was shrub size but the flowers were relatively small in comparison to the size of the shrub.\n\nSkeletonleaf Goldeneye (Viguiera stenoloba S.F. Blake)\n\nI assume the common name refers to the very narrow, filament-like leaves on the plant.\n\nTetragonotheca helianthoides L.\n\nPineland Ginseng, Squarehead (Tetragonotheca helianthoides L.)\n\nIâm not sure where the âginsengâ part comes in but the âpinelandâ and âsquareheadâ is dead on the money.Â This is a really unusual head for a composite, at least to me. Â\n\nThere are four species reported in Flora of North America and three of those are exclusive to Texas.Â T. helianthoides is found in the southeastern U.S. but not Texas.96\n\nPineland Ginseng, Squarehead (Tetragonotheca helianthoides L.)Â\n\nIt is the involucral bractss that give the name âsquarehead.âÂ I photographed this along the Sand Hill Trail at Silver Springs State Park, Florida.\n\nCoreopsis gigantea (Kellogg) H.M. Hall\n\nGiant Coreopsis (Coreopsis gigantea (Kellogg) H.M. Hall)\n\nIâve been fond of the genus Coreopsis since my Tishomingo days.Â For some reason, the genus stands out to me and I can recognize it unlike many members of the aster family.Â I have no idea why but it sticks with me.\n\nThis was a big surprise.Â Iâve seen members of the aster family in shrub size before but this was jaw dropping.\n\nGiant Coreopsis (Coreopsis gigantea (Kellogg) H.M. Hall)\n\nThis is restricted to California and Baja California.97Â The leaves are lobed and the lobes are referred to as filiform (or threadlike).\n\nGiant Coreopsis (Coreopsis gigantea (Kellogg) H.M. Hall)\n\nI will have to admit I did not recognize it as a Coreopsis.Â The flowers donât have the usual features that seem to key me into the genus.Â This was photographed on Santa Cruz Island in the Channel Islands National Park.Â There were quite a few scattered all over the island.\n\nCoreopsis gladiata Walter\n\nTickseed (Coreopsis gladiata Walter)\n\nThis flower I immediately identified to the genus Coreopsis. It ticks all the boxes in my mind for the plant. Â\n\nTickseed (Coreopsis gladiata Walter)\n\nThe one unusual feature to me was the orange âringâ around the disc flowers.Â\n\nFrom my reading of Flora of North America, I think there is still some controversy over the genus.Â The 28 species listed are divided into eight sections.98\n\nFor example, for C. gladiata, the Flora states âAs here circumscribed, Coreopsis gladiataÂ includes plants that others (without agreement among themselves) have treated as distinct species and/or varieties:....â (My emphasis.)99\n\nThis was growing in the prairie of Kissimmee Prairie Preserve State Park.Â\n\nBidens pilosa L.\n\nSpanish Needles (Bidens pilosa L.)\n\nWhen I moved to Florida in 1985 to take up a teaching position at (then) Broward Community College, this was called Bidens alba.Â Somewhere in the in between years, it was changed to B. pilosa. Â\n\nThis is pretty much considered a weed in south Florida but I try to encourage it whenever I can in my yard. Â\n\nSpanish Needles (Bidens pilosa L.)\n\nThere arenât that many ray or disc flowers but what few are present really do show off the plant. Â\n\nSpanish Needles (Bidens pilosa L.)\n\nWhen fruit develops, the achenes have two large retrorsely (pointing backwards) barbed awns.Â There are 25 species of Bidens listed in Flora of North America.100\n\nFlaveria linearis Lagasca\n\nCoastal Plain Yellowtops (Flaveria linearis Lagasca)\n\nThis typically has only disc flowers and only a few of those per head.Â The linearis comes from the linear-shaped leaves of the plant. Â\n\nOne interesting feature of the genus is that different species exhibit different forms of photosynthesis.101Â There are three basic forms of photosynthesis: the Calvin Cycle or C3 pathway, the C-4 pathway and finally Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM Photosynthesis).Â You could add a fourth version as a C3-C4 intermediate pathway.Â Flaveria liners apparently does the C3-C4 intermediate pathway (Plant Phyiology, 1998)\n\nThis was photographed on the loop road of Old Tamiami Trail, Big Cypress Preserve.\n\nLayia glandulosa (Hooker) Hooker & Arnott\n\nWhite Layia (Layia glandulosa (Hooker) Hooker & Arnott)\n\nT"
