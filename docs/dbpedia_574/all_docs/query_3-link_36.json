Americans. It is still often used as a wild food.\n\nKnown Hazards\n\nAlthough no specific mention of toxicity for this species has been found, at least some members of this genus are known to contain furanocoumarins, particularly psoralen and angelicin. These compounds can be found in low concentrations in many common foods including citrus fruirs, celery, parsley and parsnips. Ingestion or skin application of these compounds in larger quantities can cause skin photosensitization followed by hyperpigmentation[\n\n65\n\nTitle\n\nA Colour Atlas of Poisonous Plants.\n\nPublication\n\nAuthor\n\nFrohne.

If doing this, and seed stocks are in short supply, sow the seed in early spring around 5 - 10mm deep and place a moderate sized clear glass or plastic jar over the seed to help protect it from predation. Remove the jar once the plant is growing well.\n\nAlternatively, sow the soaked seed in early to mid spring in a greenhouse. Either sow the seed in individual pots or pot up the young seedlings as soon as possible in order to avoid root disturbance. Grow them on in the pots until planting out in their final positions. It is usually impossible to transplant this species without fatal damage to the root[\n\n200\n\nTitle\n\nThe New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. 1992.\n\nPublication\n\nAuthor\n\nHuxley.
