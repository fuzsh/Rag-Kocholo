Aids to Identification: Tall beak-rush is a grass-like plant 1-2 m tall with rather coarse leaves. Members of this family can be difficult to identify without careful examination of microscopic features and knowledge of general groups. Among the sedge genera with tubercled achenes (a tubercle is the persistent style base which remains on the achene like a little crown or horn); Rhynchospora differs in that its achenes are subtended by slender perianth bristles. Within the genus, R. macrostachya is distinguished from other Maine species by its large vegetative and reproductive parts - leaves 2-3 mm wide, achenes 3.5-5.5 mm topped by a tubercle over 1 cm in length.
