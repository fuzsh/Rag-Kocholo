        "text": "Sketch O’The Week\n\nSketch o’the Week- Ray Charles!\n\nWe continue our new “famous blind black musicians” series this week with the late, great Ray Charles! Actually we really could do a series of famous blind black musicians if we wanted to. Ronnie Milsap, Reverend Gary Davis, Blind Willie McTell, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Blind Blake, Blind Boy Fuller, Blind Willie Johnson, Blind John Davis, Art Tatum, The Blind Boys of Alabama, The Blind Boys of Mississippi… that would keep me busy for a couple of months! I think we’ll cap it off with Brother Ray, though. This sketch is based on a caricature of him in one of the panels from “The Blues Brothers”… READ MORE\n\nSketch o’the Week- Stevie Wonder!\n\nBetter late than never! “I just called… to say… I sketched you!” I’m taking an extended break from doing TV sitcoms cast sketches and doing some other subjects, so feel free to make some suggestions! Thanks to subscriber Stu Miller, who suggested I draw Stevie. I can’t believe I missed doing him back when I did my “Rock Icons” series. He’s easily one of the greatest musicians and songwriters in the history of pop music. An incredible talent. READ MORE\n\nSketch o’the Week: Good Times!\n\nClick here if you are interested in this original sketch DYN-O-MITE! It’s yet another 70’s sitcom sketch with the cast of “Good Times”: Jimmie Walker, Ja’Net Du Bois, Bern Nadette Stanis, John Amos, Esther Rolle and Ralph Carter! “Good Times” is another Norman Lear show, spun off from “Maude” with was spun off from “All in the Family”… that’s a lot of spinning. Esther Rolle’s character Florida Evans was a housekeeper for Maude and was married to a NYC firefighter named Henry, but the characters and their family dynamic was changed considerably for the new show. They became poor and lived in a Chicago housing… READ MORE\n\nSketch o’the Week: Piano Men!\n\nWe are taking a quick break from our 70’s sitcom series with this sketch of rock keyboard virtuosos Elton John and Billy Joel. We take a quick breather from our 70’s sitcom sketches to bring you caricatures of two of the greatest rock and roll keyboard virtuosos ever! The guitar is arguably the most prevalent instrument in rock music, but a handful of great rock/pop musicians built their careers around the piano. Elton John and Billy Joel are among the best of them. I did this sketch as a commission, but I thought I’d share it here. The Lovely Anna and I saw these two… READ MORE\n\nSketch o’the Week: Mary Tyler Moore!\n\nIt’s another episode of our 70’s sitcom show with our sketch of the original cast of “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” Ted Knight, Ed Asner, Gavin MacLeod, Betty White, Mary Tyler Moore and Georgia Engel. This show has a special significance around here, since it was set in Minneapolis. Minnesotans and especially Minneapolis area residents have always claimed the ground breaking title character Mary Richards, the single, independent, successful career woman played by Mary Tyler Moore, as “one of us.” My sister-in-law lives just a few blocks from the house whose exteriors were used for the show. I’ve been past in many times. Of course… READ MORE\n\nSketch o’the Week: Barney Miller!\n\nHang on, Bernice… it’s Wednesday again! Time for another “Sketch o’the Week!”. Back when I was doing a sketch series of fictional TV detectives I only deviated from “serious” characters once… drawing Abe Vigoda as Sargent Philip K. Fish from “Barney Miller”. That show was another great example of a 70’s sitcom set almost entirely in one small room/set that relied on the writing and character interaction to provide stories and laughs. “Barney Miller” was one of the best examples of making that format work incredibly well. It was one of my favorite shows to watch in syndication back in the 80’s. So, this week… READ MORE\n\nSketch o’the Week- The Jeffersons!\n\nWe’re back to our usual “Sketch o’ the Week” insanity, and the continuation of our “classic TV sitcoms” theme. This week’s sketch is of the two main stars of “The Jeffersons”, Sherman Hemsley and Isabel Sanford! “The Jeffersons” was a spin-off of “All in the Family”, and actually ran for more seasons (11) than “All in the Family” (9). It was ground breaking for being based on a black family that was portrayed as successful and wealthy, and for being the first TV series to prominently feature a married interracial couple. Norman Lear claimed in his autobiography that he got the idea to move the… READ MORE\n\nSketch o’the Week- Norman Lear!\n\nConsidering more than a few of the classic 1970’s sitcoms I have been/will be drawing the casts of were created/produced by the man, I had to draw legendary television producer and screenwriter Norman Lear, who just recently passed away at age 101. It seemed like when you were watching a sitcom in the 1970’s, Norman Lear’s name was listed in the credits more often than not. The man was a true television legend, having produced, wrote, created, or developed over 100 TV shows, a number of which are considered among the greatest of their genre. “All in the Family”, “Sanford and Son”, “Maude”, “Good Times”, “The… READ MORE"
