        "text": "In her stand-up, Wanda Sykes periodically argues with the roll of fat around her stomach, which she calls Esther, after Esther Rolle, the actress who played the mom in “Good Times.”\n\nEsther, a cantankerous sort with a deep voice and an appetite that could match the plant in “Little Shop of Horrors,” is both foil and id. When one of Sykes’s children made an impolite comment about the size of her belly, Esther lashes out: “Break her little wrists!” Sykes, the responsible half of this splendid double act, would never think of such a thing.\n\nMany know Sykes from “Curb Your Enthusiasm” or “black-ish,” where, like Esther, she is extremely funny in a fairly limited (and often disgruntled) role. Or perhaps as a pioneer, since she has been the first African-American woman to do a whole lot of things in comedy, including perform at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner (she was also the first out lesbian to do so) and conceive and star in her own prime-time sitcom, “Wanda at Large.”\n\nBut to understand the full range of her singular gifts, to learn why she has secured her place in the comedy elite, you must look to her far too obscure stand-up career, where Esther has been a critical character for more than a decade. Since the late 1990s, Sykes has produced a few superb specials (“Tongue Untied,” “I’ma Be Me”), one absolute classic (the 2016 “What Happened … Ms. Sykes?”); and a new hour debuting Tuesday on Netflix, “Not Normal,” that is, by her standards, just fine.\n\nSykes’s first big break was as a writer, on “The Chris Rock Show” on HBO (where she also occasionally performed), and you can detect some similarities with Rock in the way she sets up a premise, the swagger of her umbrage and even some phrases. (She wrote a book called “Yeah, I Said It,” one of his best-known refrains.)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
