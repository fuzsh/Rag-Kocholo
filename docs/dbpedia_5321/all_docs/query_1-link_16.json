        "text": "Best known for the role of Florida Evans on the 1970s sitcoms Maude (1972) and Good Times (1974), African-American actress Esther Rolle proved to be as spirited and iron-willed off-camera as well. The gap-toothed actress with the gravelly voice was born in Pompano Beach, Florida, the 10th child of 18 born to Caribbean farming immigrants. Her first important work came with the Negro Ensemble Company and over the years would earn a solid careworn reputation in such theater plays as \"The Blacks\", \"Blues for Mister Charlie\", \"The Amen Corner\", \"A Raisin in the Sun\" and \"A Member of the Wedding\". Ironically, her father insisted she promise him that she would never become a servant or maid in real life. She didn't, and however Esther would have her biggest successes playing just those types of roles. She caught the attention of television producer Norman Lear while performing on stage who cast her in the Maude (1972) supporting role in 1972. Audiences loved her so much as the feisty domestic who stood her ground, and then some, against her volatile and liberal-minded employer Maude Findley (Bea Arthur), that Esther earned her own spin-off series with Good Times (1974). Compelled to fight racial stereotypes, she insisted before accepting the series that a strong father figure be central in the show (actor John Amos). And while she still played the role of a lower middle-class maid, the show's emphasis was to be on her home and family life, not her outside work. Still, Esther left the show for one season when she was unhappy about the negative role model perpetuated by Jimmie 'JJ' Walker's jive-talking character J.J., but later returned after the producers assured her that more responsibility would be taken. In other assignments, she won an Emmy Award for the television movie Mein deutscher Soldat (1978) and gained further respect for her work in Maya Angelou's I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1979) and for her film work in Miss Daisy und ihr Chauffeur (1989) and Rosewood Burning (1997). Two of her sisters, Estelle Evans and Rosanna Carter, were also character actresses. Afflicted with diabetes, Esther's health failed in the 1990s and toward the end of her life she was on kidney dialysis. The actress, who was divorced and had no children, died nine days after her 78th birthday on November 17, 1998.\n\nLouis Gossett Jr. was one of the most respected and beloved actors on stage, screen and television and was also an accomplished writer, producer and director. Off-screen, he was a social activist, educator, and author dedicated to enriching the lives of others. He was the first African-American to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his unforgettable performance as drill Sergeant Emil Foley in \"An Officer and a Gentleman\".\n\nAmong his other awards were an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor for his portrayal of Fiddler in the groundbreaking ABC series \"Roots\", a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role for \"The Josephine Baker Story\" and a Golden Globe for \"An Officer and a Gentleman\". He was nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards, three Golden Globes, one Academy Award, five Images Awards, two Daytime Emmy Awards and in 1992 received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He received numerous other honors throughout his illustrious career.\n\nHis film debut was in the 1961 classic movie \"A Raisin in the Sun\" with Sidney Poitier. Other film credits include \"The Deep,\" \"Blue Chips,\" \"Daddy's Little Girls,\" Tyler Perry's \"Why Did I Get Married Too?,\" \"Firewalker,\" \"Jaws-3D,\" \"Enemy Mine\" and \"Iron Eagle\" 1-4, among many others. Television credits include \"Extant,\" \"Madam Secretary,\" \"Boardwalk Empire,\" \"Family Guy\", and \"ER\", among dozens of others.\n\nGossett authored the bestselling autobiography \"An Actor and a Gentleman\", recounting the challenges and triumphs of his 50+ year career. Gossett was recognized as much for his humanitarian efforts as for his accomplishments as an actor. In 2006, he founded The Eracism Foundation which is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to eradicating racism. The foundation provides young adults with tools to live a racially diverse and culturally inclusive life. Programs focus on fostering cultural diversity, historical enrichment, education and anti-violence initiatives.\n\nGossett was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, and made his stage debut when he was 17 years old in \"Take a Giant Step\", which was selected as one of the 10 best Broadway shows of 1953 by the New York Times. He had two sons and resided in Malibu until his death in Santa Monica, California, in 2024, aged 87.\n\nRon Masak (MAY-SACK) was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of a salesman/musician (Floyd Lewis Masak, of Bohemian Czech descent), and a mother (Mildred Alice Rudy, of Irish descent), who was a merchandise buyer. Ron attended Chicago City College, and studied theater at both the CCC and the Drama Guild. He made his acting debut with the Drama Guild in Chicago in Stalag 17 in 1954.\n\nDuring the course of his career, he starred in 25 feature films and guest starred in some 350 television shows. Perhaps the most beloved character was that of Sheriff Mort Metzger on Mord ist ihr Hobby (1984). He was seen and heard in hundred of television and radio commercials. He was nicknamed the \"King of Commercials\" by columnist James Bacon.\n\nTrained in the classics, he proved to be equally at home on stage or screen with Shakespeare or slapstick. He played everything from Stanley Kowalski in 'A Streetcar Named Desire' and Sakini in 'Teahouse of the August Moon' to Will Stockdale in 'No Time For Sergeants', and Antony in 'Julius Caesar'. As further proof of his versatility, in one production of 'Mr. Roberts', he played Ensign Pulver, and, in another production, he portrayed the title character himself.\n\nIn his hometown of Chicago, he was resident leading man at The Candlelight Dinner Playhouse from 1962 to 1966, never missing a single performance. The U.S. Army provided Masak with a platform from which to display his all-around talents for performing, writing and directing. In 1960-61, he toured the world doing vocal impressions in the all-Army show entitled 'Rolling Along' and never missed a show.\n\nMasak continued to demonstrate his range of talent in such films as Ice Station Zebra, Daddy's Gone A-Hunting, Tora! Tora! Tora!, A Time For Dying, Harper Valley PTA, Cops & Roberts and The Man From Clover Grove. It was during Clover Grove that Ron added credits as a lyric writer, as he wrote and sang the title song. He played his first big screen villain starring in No Code of Conduct. Among his many television roles, he starred as Charley Wilson on Love Thy Neighbor, as Count Dracula on The Monkees, and was submitted for an Emmy nomination for one of his ten appearances on Police Story. He was seen on Magnum P.I., Webster, The Law and Harry McGraw, and Columbo. His movies of the week include The Neighborhood, In the Glitter Palace, Pleasure Cove, Once An Eagle, and Nightmare in Chicago.\n\nHis variety work included emceeing hundreds of shows for, among others, Kenny Rogers, Diahann Carroll, Alabama, Billy Crystal, The Steve Garvey Classics, Tony Orlando, The Lennon Sisters, Trini Lopez, Marilyn McCoo, Billy Davis, Connie Stevens, as well as the Michael Landon Classics and the Beau Bridges Classics.\n\nMasak starred in Second Effort (with Vince Lombardi), Time Management (with James Whitmore), How to Control Your Time (with Burgess Meredith), and Ya Gotta Believe (with Tommy Lasorda, which Masak wrote and directed). He was a sought-after motivational speaker. He traveled across the USA as spokesman for a major brewing company and for 15 years was the voice of the Vlasic Pickle stork. Masak played Lou Costello in commercials for Bran News, McDonald's, and Tropicana Orange Juice. Frequently seen on the talk and game show circuit, he was a celebrity panelist on such game shows as Password, Tattletales, Crosswits, Liar's Club, Showoffs and Match Game. He was a regular panelist on To Tell the Truth.\n\nHe devoted his time and energy working with many charities. For eight years, he was the LA host for the Jerry Lewis Telethon and recipient of MDA's first Humanitarian of the Year Award. He served as field announcer for the Special Olympics in support of Special needs children, and was named Man of the Year by Volunteers Assisting Cancer Stricken Families. In addition, he contributed time to work with Multiple Sclerosis, Cystic Fibrosis, and Breast Cancer awareness groups and hosted charity golf tournaments for among others, Childhelp USA, for whom he was a worldwide ambassador.\n\nHe and his wife Kay had six children and ten grandchildren.\n\nMaidie Norman was born Maidie Ruth Gamble on October 16, 1912, in Villa Rica, Georgia, to Louis and Lila Gamble. She received a B.A. from Bennett College in 1934 and a master's degree from Columbia University three years later. She also attended the Actors Lab in Hollywood from 1946 to 1949.\n\nNorman first appeared on film in The Peanut Man in 1947. Throughout the fifties-not a good time for film roles for black women-she appeared in a number of films, such as Bright Road (1953) with Dorothy Dandridge and Harry Belafonte and Herzen im Fieber (1953); About Mrs. Leslie and Susan Slept Here in 1954; and 1956's Written on the Wind. These were often servant roles, with a special fifties blandness. Still, Norman was skillful and professional in her execution of them. In 1962, she got a chance to chew up the scenery with Bette Davis and Joan Crawford in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\n\nIn 1968-69, Norman was an artist-in-residence at Stanford University and, throughout the seventies, she was lecturer, director, and acting teacher at UCLA. At the same time, Norman was highly visible on television, appearing in Mannix, Adam 12, Streets of San Francisco, Kung Fu, The Jeffersons, and others. She was also part of the cast of Roots: The Next Generation in 1979.\n\nNorman was a founding member of the American Negro Theater West; in 1977, she was inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame; and an award in her name is presented each year for outstanding research by an undergraduate in Black Theater at UCLA. She died on May 6, 1998.\n\nCharlotte Rae was born Charlotte Rae Lubotsky in 1926, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the middle daughter of three sisters, between Beverly and Mimi. Her parents, Esther (nee Ottenstein) and Meyer Lubotsky, were Russian Jewish immigrants. Her father owned an automobile tire business. Her mother had been a childhood friend of Milwaukee-reared Golda Meir, future Prime Minister of Israel.\n\nRae wanted to be a dramatic actress, but eventually wound up being a comedienne, all because of her stand-up comedy routines. Her family moved to the village of Shorewood, Wisconsin (Milwaukee County) in 1936. After graduating from Shorewood High School, she attended Northwestern University, where she met future actress Cloris Leachman; the two would be lifelong friends. She dropped out of college and moved to New York City, and began a career as a stage actress, performing in such plays as \"Pickwick\", for which she was nominated in 1966 for Best Featured Actress in a Musical, and, in 1969, for Best Actress in a Play for \"Morning, Noon and Night\". She co-starred with Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis in Wagen 54, bitte melden (1961). She would live there until 1974 when she moved to Southern California.\n\nShe was nominated for an Emmy Award for her supporting role in Die Ballkönigin (1975). After guest-starring on numerous shows, including Norman Lear's Es bleibt in der Familie (1971) and Good Times (1974), Lear hired her old friend to co-star on Noch Fragen Arnold? (1978) as Gary Coleman's housekeeper, \"Edna Garrett\". Within a year, she gained popularity with her character, which eventually led her to having her own series, The Facts of Life (1979). Between Norman Lear and NBC, they gave her the green-light to star in her own show, which focused primarily on the housekeeper of an all-girls school. The spinoff series featured newcomers including Kim Fields as \"Tootie\" and Lisa Whelchel as rich spoiled brat \"Blair Warner\".\n\nBefore then, she approached young Mindy Cohn at Westlake School in Los Angeles, and suggested that she take the role of smart \"Natalie Green\", a character Rae created for her and named after one of her best friends from high school. Cohn stayed on the show for eight seasons. Rae left the show in 1986 reportedly owing to a health issue. She reportedly created the role of \"Beverly\" for her old friend, Cloris Leachman, to play on The Facts of Life (1979) after she left the show.\n\nShe returned to the stage. In 1992, she was the voice of \"Aunt Christine Figg\" in Tom und Jerry: Der Film (1992) and appeared in \"The Vagina Monologues\" in New York. In 2000, she starred as \"Berthe\" in the Paper Mill Playhouse production of \"Pippin\". In 2007, she appeared in a cabaret show at the Plush Room in San Francisco for several performances. In the 2008 movie, Leg dich nicht mit Zohan an (2008), she played a mature woman who has a fling with Adam Sandler's character. On February 18, 2009, she appeared in a small role as \"Mrs. Ford\" on the \"I Heart Mom\" episode.\n\nRae's older sister, Beverly, died from pancreatic cancer in 1998, while Rae's ex-husband of 35 years, John Strauss, died in 2011, following a long battle with Parkinson's disease. A pancreatic cancer survivor, Rae continued to act while making guest appearances everywhere, especially TV Land, where her show, The Facts of Life (1979), won the 2011 award for Pop Culture Icon.\n\nCharlotte Rae died on August 5, 2018 at her home in Los Angeles, aged 92, from bone cancer, which had been diagnosed a year earlier. She also suffered from asthma and scoliosis, and had been fitted with a pacemaker.\n\nMichael D. Roberts was born on December 25, 1947 in Brooklyn, New York. A wealthy Manhattan furniture designer gave the generous gift of cribs, blankets, toys and a year supply of milk to the first ten babies of post war veterans born on Christmas Day; and Michael was one of them.\n\nAt twelve years old Michael had his first major stage appearance in a theatre production at his local church. It was then that his passion for acting was born. In high school Michael enrolled in the drama program, and after graduating attended Los Angeles City College where he continued his study in the dramatic arts. Later, Michael attended USIU School of Performing Arts in San Diego and in his final year of study attended the prestigious California Institute of the Arts.\n\nOne of Michael's first television appearances was on The Flip Wilson Show (1971). Through the 1970s he appeared on such popular television shows as, Good Times (1974) and The Incredible Hulk (1979).\n\nOne of Michael's most memorable roles was the jive-talking street-hustler, \"Rooster\", on the hit TV series Baretta, (1975). A role that garnered high accolades for Michael in Hollywood and the adoration of many fans. Into the1980s Michael's career showed no signs of slowing; with guest starring roles on B.J. and the Bear (1980), Bosom Buddies (1981), The Fall Guy (1982) and the season premiere of Knight Rider (1982).\n\nIt was in 1984 that Michael starred in the science fiction adventure The Ice Pirates along side actors Ron Perlman (Sons of Anarchy), Anjelica Huston (The Adams Family) and Robert Urich (Vega$). In 1988 Michael landed the roll of Vern in the Oscar winning film Rain Man directed by Barry Levinson and starring Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman.\n\nThrough the 1990s and into the 2000s Michael's prolific acting career continued with guest star appearances on Seinfeld (1996) and Friends (2000). In 2005 Michael co-starred in the high-octane drama, Hostage, starring Bruce Willis.\n\nIn 2012, Michael was cast as \"Bernard\" in the television show, The First Family, from producer Byron Allen; also starring, Jackee Harry (Sister Sister, 227), Gladys Knight and John Witherspoon (Friday, The Wayans Bros).\n\nMichael lives in Los Angeles, with his wife, actress Pamela Roberts and their 2 children.\n\nCarl Weathers was born on January 14, 1948, in New Orleans, Louisiana. A famous and successful football star at San Diego State, he played with the Oakland Raiders and retired from the sport in 1974, in order to give full attention to his goal: to be a real actor.\n\nWeathers first played small parts in two blaxploitation flicks, Friday Foster - Im Netz der Schwarzen Spinne (1975) (in which he played \"Yarbro\") and Bucktown (1975) (playing \"Hambone\"), both made in 1975 and directed by Arthur Marks. However, his big break came the following year when producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff chose him to play \"Apollo Creed\" in the blockbuster \"sleeper\" Rocky (1976) (real-life boxing legend Ken Norton was originally signed for the part, but it eventually went to Weathers). He went on to play \"Creed\" in three other \"Rocky\" movies, and the characters' adversarial relationship eventually evolved into a warm friendship. After Creed's death in Rocky IV - Der Kampf des Jahrhunderts (1985), Weathers met with producer Joel Silver and agreed to play an important supporting role in Predator (1987), an action film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nThe following year, Silver produced Action Jackson (1988), a first starring role for Weathers, but it performed poorly at the box office and was panned by the critics.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Weathers starred in four In der Hitze der Nacht (1988) two-hour TV specials that were much better received by critics and viewers alike. In 1996, he played the part of \"Chubbs Peterson\" in the blockbuster Adam Sandler comedy Happy Gilmore - Ein Champ zum Verlieben (1996). He returned to his \"action roots\" in two TV-movies with Hulk Hogan: Attack on Devil's Island (1997) and Shadow Warriors II: Hunt for the Death Merchant (1999).\n\nIn addition to his acting career, Weathers is also a member of the Big Brothers Association and the U.S. Olympic Committee, handling the career of athletes of various sports such as gymnastics, wrestling, swimming and judo."
