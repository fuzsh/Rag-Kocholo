        "text": "Ja’Net DuBois, who played the sassy Willona Woods in the hit 1970s television show “Good Times” and sang the theme song to another hit show, “The Jeffersons,” died on Monday at her home in Glendale, Calif.\n\nHer death was confirmed by her daughter Kesha Gupta-Fields.\n\nMs. DuBois’s family said she was 74, although public records indicate she may have been older.\n\n“Good Times,” seen from 1974 to 1979 on CBS, was one of the first sitcoms with a predominantly black cast and was noteworthy for featuring a two-parent home. Ms. DuBois’s character, Willona, was the single neighbor of Florida Evans (played by Esther Rolle), the matriarch of the show’s family.\n\nWillona was stylish and outspoken, but she also had a big heart. She did not hesitate to take in Penny, an abused child played by a young Janet Jackson.\n\nWhile she was taping “Good Times,” Ms. DuBois told Norman Lear, an executive producer and one of the show’s creators, that she wanted to branch out. Mr. Lear suggested she work on the theme song to another of his shows, “The Jeffersons,” a spinoff of his biggest hit, “All in the Family,” Ms. Gupta-Fields said. (“Good Times” was a spinoff of “Maude,” itself also a spinoff of “All in the Family.”)\n\nAfter speaking to her mother about her own family’s aspirations to move up in life, she wrote “Movin’ On Up” with Jeff Barry. She also sang it over the show’s opening credits.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
