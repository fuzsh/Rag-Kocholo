        "text": "Maidie Norman was born Maidie Ruth Gamble on October 16, 1912, in Villa Rica, Georgia, to Louis and Lila Gamble. She received a B.A. from Bennett College in 1934 and a master's degree from Columbia University three years later. She also attended the Actors Lab in Hollywood from 1946 to 1949.\n\nNorman first appeared on film in The Peanut Man in 1947. Throughout the fifties-not a good time for film roles for black women-she appeared in a number of films, such as Bright Road (1953) with Dorothy Dandridge and Harry Belafonte and Herzen im Fieber (1953); About Mrs. Leslie and Susan Slept Here in 1954; and 1956's Written on the Wind. These were often servant roles, with a special fifties blandness. Still, Norman was skillful and professional in her execution of them. In 1962, she got a chance to chew up the scenery with Bette Davis and Joan Crawford in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\n\nIn 1968-69, Norman was an artist-in-residence at Stanford University and, throughout the seventies, she was lecturer, director, and acting teacher at UCLA. At the same time, Norman was highly visible on television, appearing in Mannix, Adam 12, Streets of San Francisco, Kung Fu, The Jeffersons, and others. She was also part of the cast of Roots: The Next Generation in 1979.\n\nNorman was a founding member of the American Negro Theater West; in 1977, she was inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame; and an award in her name is presented each year for outstanding research by an undergraduate in Black Theater at UCLA. She died on May 6, 1998.\n\n1930s and 1940s film actress Louise Beavers was merely one of a dominant gallery of plus-sized and plus-talented African-American character actresses forced to endure blatant, discouraging and demeaning stereotypes during Depression-era and WWII Hollywood.\n\nIt wasn't until Louise's triumphant role in Fannie Hurst's classic soaper Imitation of Life (1934) that a film of major significance offered a black role of meaning, substance and humanity. Louise's servile role as housekeeper Delilah, who works for single white mother Claudette Colbert, was a poignant and touching, three-dimensional character that had its own dramatic story. Brilliantly handling the heartbreaking co-plot of an appeasing single parent whose light-skinned daughter (played by Fredi Washington) went to cruel and desperate lengths to pass for white. While Louise certainly championed in the role and managed to steal the lion's share of reviews right from under the film's superstar, the movie triggered major controversy and just as many complaints as compliments from black and white viewers. This certainly did not help what could have been a major, positive shift in black filmmaking. Instead, for the next two or more decades Louise was again forced back to secondary status.\n\nMs. Beavers was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on March 8, 1902 and moved with her family to the Los Angeles area at age 11. A student at Pasadena High School and a choir member at her local church, her mother, a voice teacher, trained Louise for the concert stage but instead the young girl joined an all-female minstrel company called \"Lady Minstrels\" and even hooked up for a time on the vaudeville circuit. A nursing career once entertained was quickly aborted in favor of acting. Her first break of sorts was earning a living as a personal maid and assistant to Paramount star Leatrice Joy (and later actress Lilyan Tashman). By 1924 she was performing as an extra or walk-on in between her chores. A talent agent spotted her and gave her a more noticeable role in Onkel Toms HÃ¼tte (1927). She went on to gain even more visibility, but was invariably stuck in the background cooking or cleaning after the leads. Despite this her beaming smile and good nature paid off.\n\nFollowing scene-grabbing maid roles to such stars as Mary Pickford in Coquette (1929) Linda Watkins in Good Sport (1931), Mae West in Sie tat ihm unrecht (1933), Constance Bennett in What Price Hollywood? (1932) and Jean Harlow in Sexbombe (1933), Louise received the role of her career. Her poignant story line and final death scene deserved an Oscar nomination and many insiders took her snub as deliberate and prejudicial. Five years later her close friend Hattie McDaniel would become the first black actor to not only earn an Oscar nomination but capture the coveted trophy as well for her subordinate role in Vom Winde verweht (1939).\n\nDespite their individual triumphs, both ladies continued in stereotyped roles. Occasionally Louise was rewarded with such Hollywood \"A\" treats as Ein ideales Paar (1939) with Carole Lombard, Musik, Musik (1942) starring Bing Crosby, and especially Nur meiner Frau zuliebe (1948) with Cary Grant and Myrna Loy. In The Jackie Robinson Story (1950), she offered lovely moments as the baseball star's mother.\n\nAlthough film offers dried up in the 1950s, Louise managed to transfer her talents to the new TV medium, and was one of a number of character actresses hired to play the wise-cracking, problem-solving maid Beulah (1950) during its run. \"Beulah\" was one of the first sitcoms to star a black actor. She also had a recurring role in Disney's \"The Swamp Fox\". In 1957, she made her professional stage debut in San Francisco with the short-lived play \"Praise House\" as a caregiver who extols the Bible through song. Her last few films, which included Die GÃ¶ttin (1958), FrÃ¼chte einer Leidenschaft (1960) and the Bob Hope comedy So eine AffÃ¤re (1960) were typical stereotypes and unmemorable.\n\nA long time bachelor lady who finally married in the 1950s, the short, heavyset actress was plagued by health issues in later years, her obesity and diabetes in particular. She lost her fight on October 26, 1962, at age 60 following a heart attack. In 1976 she was posthumously inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame.\n\nTheresa Harris appeared with more stars of the Golden Era of Hollywood than anyone else. She sang, she danced, she appeared in movies and TV. She graced the screen with her magnetic presence and most times stole scenes from the top stars of the day every chance she got and made a lot of dull films worthwhile. Although stereotyped by receiving only maid roles, Theresa stepped outside the stereotype any chance she got, to show she was glamorous, classy, beautiful, and a true actress. While she often played maids, she always showed dignity, grace, and demanded respect. Theresa didn't exactly fit the mammy/maid stereotype fore she was a petite beauty, a stark contrast from Louise Beavers and Hattie McDaniel, and Theresa was one of the very few black women to not fit that stereotype on screen.\n\nThere were quite a few movies in which Theresa got a chance to let her light shine and make you forget her maid costume and see her as a talented actress. In the pre-Code classic Baby Face (1933), she and Barbara Stanwyck had equal screentime, which was rare between black and white actors at that time. Playing Chico, Stanwyck's friend and co-worker, Harris gave a moving and memorable performance that contributed to the film becoming one of the essentials of the classic genre. Theresa was allowed to be sexy, glamorous, and her own person, not simply a servant who jumped at her employer's every beck and call, a rarity for a black actress in a maid part in the 1930s, and a true friendship was shared between Stanwyck and Harris' characters, another rarity. In Professional Sweetheart (1933), Harris played a spunky, sexy maid who teaches Ginger Rogers a thing or two about being \"hot\", and ends up replacing Rogers as a singer, singing a hot song on the radio that turns on the white male listeners, another shocker and rarity at the time for a black actress. But pre-Code movies usually pushed the envelope, which shows in both 'Baby Face' and 'Professional Sweetheart'. Though Theresa played maid roles most of her movie career, she had showed moments of excellence in many other films such as Ganovenbraut (1933), Black Moon (1934), Gangsters on the Loose (1937), Jezebel - die boshafte Lady (1938), The Toy Wife (1938), Tell No Tales (1939), Buck Benny Rides Again (1940), Love Thy Neighbor (1940), BlÃ¼ten im Staub (1941), Katzenmenschen (1942), and Ich folgte einem Zombie (1943), among others.\n\nTheresa was a versatile talent; besides acting, she could sing beautifully and dance divinely, when she had the chance in such movies as Sie nannten ihn Thunderbolt (1929), 'Baby Face', 'Professional Sweetheart', Mississippi-Melodie (1936), 'Buck Benny Rides Again', What's Buzzin', Cousin? (1943), and Die lockende Venus (1953). When Theresa got the chance to show her beauty and sex appeal, it was often with her screen boyfriend, Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson; they were dynamic on screen together in 'Buck Benny Rides Again' and 'What's Buzzin', Cousin?'. In the former, they sing and dance tap, classical, Spanish, and swing in a musical number, \"My, My\".\n\nTheresa Harris was perhaps the hardest-working woman in Hollywood, appearing in close to 90 films, working at every major studio with most of the big stars. She was respected by studio executives, producers, directors, and co-workers alike, who sometimes went out of their way to get her more lines and screentime. Harris married a doctor and retired from the movies in the late 1950s, living comfortably after having carefully invested the money she made during her career in the films. She was a patient woman who never gave up hope that there would come a time when she would be able to play more than just maid parts. Nevertheless, in every role, she displayed class, dignity, beauty, and true acting talent, not simply the old stereotypes associated with black actors at that time.\n\nCarmen Hayward was born in Los Angeles to Ann Frazier, a licensed vocational nurse and Joseph Hayward, a plasterer from Louisiana. Her parents broke up, and at five she moved with her mother and younger sister to Louisville, Ky., her mother's hometown, where she enjoyed the support of a huge extended family. There she learned to sing in front of an audience. A career move for Ann took her with her girls to Washington, D.C. where Carmen started junior high school. Later, as an A student at Roosevelt High school she was President of the Thespians Club exploring theater. Returning to LA, she reunited with her father, graduated from Dorsey High School, and enrolled in LA City College becoming a theater major. She received a scholarship to U.S. International University's School of Performing and Visual Arts, performing in musical theatre production; and, then transferred to UCLA majoring in theater where she performed in main stage musical productions. With an AA, a BA degree, and classes at Inner City Cultural Center in hand, she started to work as a singer and actress in movies, television, public service announcements, and on stage. She starred in Tide's \"Old Fashioned Woman\" commercial; and toured nationally in a featured Singer/Dancer duo for Burt Bacharach and Anthony Newley.\n\nTaking occasional breaks from performing, Carmen Hayward studied television/film production, and broadcasting at UCLA extension and USC which led to work in : Advertising, Publicity and Promotion for ABC Television, and ABC Motion Pictures; Development at Taft Entertainment Television; as well as special events for the City of Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department and the Constitutional Rights Foundation. She also served as a producer for N-Vision Media Productions, developing a techno-thriller feature film, \"Silent Deception.\" In recent years, Carmen began producing digital theatrical productions. As Artistic Director of the Drama Guild at FAME Church Los Angeles, she partnered with Ethiopian-Canadian novelist, Ainalem Tebeje, to create a Reader's Theatre production entitled, \"My Love Story, in Broken English\" and performed as the \"Narrator.\" She also wrote and directed \"Civil Unrest Monologues,\" a multi-media stage production, performing the role of \"Jackie Broxton.\"\n\nCarmen is married to Jeff Stetson, a television writer/producer and playwright. They have one son, Anwar Stetson, a sports journalist.\n\nA gifted veteran character actress, Starletta DuPois has breathed life into a bevy of unforgettable roles both onstage and onscreen. Starletta is recognized from her roles in many cult classics including Friday After Next with Ice Cube and Mike Epps, Big Momma's House with Martin Lawrence, and Oliver Stone's South Central. She was recently seen in the faith based film Mosaic, the inspirational drama Boarding House, and the screen adaptation of the popular book True To The Game.

However millions around the world still remember her playing the late Whitney Houston's mother in Waiting To Exhale. On television her resume is equally as impressive. Small screen highlights include: Lost, Cold Case, Any Day Now, Strapped, The Carmichael Show, The Rich & The Ruthless, and the Lifetime movie Michael Jackson: Searching for Neverland where she played Jackson family matriarch Katherine Jackson.\n\nHer theater roots run deep and have garnered her numerous recognitions starting with her Tony Nomination for The Mighty Gents and a NAACP Theater Award nomination for Miss Evers Boys at the Mark Taper Forum. She has also done a ton of regional theater including Intimate Apparel, King Hedley II, and Before It Hits Home at St Louis Black Rep where she received The Woodie Award, named for her theatrical mentor and dear friend Woodie King Jr. She also has the distinction of originating the role of Bernice in August Wilson's The Piano Lesson directed by Lloyd Richards.\n\nAnother unique and remarkable feat is that fact that she has played all three female characters in Lorraine Hansberry's A Raisin In The Sun. Not only did she receive an NAACP Image Award for her portrayal of Ruth Younger in the landmark PBS American Playhouse production opposite Danny Glover, she was awarded Best Actress award for playing Lena Younger at the Royal Exchange in London, England. Her work has also been lauded by the Los Angeles Women's Theater Festival which gave her their Eternity Award, and is the recipient of not one but two Living Legend Awards: one from The Giving Back Corporation and the second from the National Black Theater Festival in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.\n\nA Philadelphia native, Starletta holds a B.S. in Biology from the University of Maryland Eastern Shore and an MFA from UCLA in Theater Arts where she graduated magna cum laude. A lifelong philanthropist she has a passion for mentoring aspiring artists, Starletta has proudly served as an adjunct professor at USC. This unstoppable talent has successfully toured the solo play Order My Steps and is hard at work on her autobiographical solo play which will be premiering onstage in the very near future.\n\nStarletta lives in Los Angeles, California and is the proud mother of an incredible young musician named Deandre.\n\nDonzaleigh Abernathy won the Tanne Foundation 2012 Artist Award for her work as an actress and for her script, \"Birmingham Sunday.\" She starred for four years in over 60 Episodes as a Series Regular on Lifetime Television's critically acclaimed dramatic series, \"Any Day Now.\" She received recognition from Film Critic Roger Ebert for her performance in the Warner Bros. film, \"Gods And Generals.\" She starred as the leading lady in the Emmy and Golden Globe winning HBO Film, \"Don King-Only in America,\" opposite Ving Rhames.

Her life is profiled in the books \"Fearless Women\" and \"No Mountain High Enough - Secrets of Successful African American Women.\"\n\nBest known for the role of Florida Evans on the 1970s sitcoms Maude (1972) and Good Times (1974), African-American actress Esther Rolle proved to be as spirited and iron-willed off-camera as well. The gap-toothed actress with the gravelly voice was born in Pompano Beach, Florida, the 10th child of 18 born to Caribbean farming immigrants. Her first important work came with the Negro Ensemble Company and over the years would earn a solid careworn reputation in such theater plays as \"The Blacks\", \"Blues for Mister Charlie\", \"The Amen Corner\", \"A Raisin in the Sun\" and \"A Member of the Wedding\". Ironically, her father insisted she promise him that she would never become a servant or maid in real life. She didn't, and however Esther would have her biggest successes playing just those types of roles. She caught the attention of television producer Norman Lear while performing on stage who cast her in the Maude (1972) supporting role in 1972. Audiences loved her so much as the feisty domestic who stood her ground, and then some, against her volatile and liberal-minded employer Maude Findley (Bea Arthur), that Esther earned her own spin-off series with Good Times (1974). Compelled to fight racial stereotypes, she insisted before accepting the series that a strong father figure be central in the show (actor John Amos). And while she still played the role of a lower middle-class maid, the show's emphasis was to be on her home and family life, not her outside work. Still, Esther left the show for one season when she was unhappy about the negative role model perpetuated by Jimmie 'JJ' Walker's jive-talking character J.J., but later returned after the producers assured her that more responsibility would be taken. In other assignments, she won an Emmy Award for the television movie Mein deutscher Soldat (1978) and gained further respect for her work in Maya Angelou's I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1979) and for her film work in Miss Daisy und ihr Chauffeur (1989) and Rosewood Burning (1997). Two of her sisters, Estelle Evans and Rosanna Carter, were also character actresses. Afflicted with diabetes, Esther's health failed in the 1990s and toward the end of her life she was on kidney dialysis. The actress, who was divorced and had no children, died nine days after her 78th birthday on November 17, 1998.\n\nThe 'Real' Billie\n\nLillian--aka \"Billie\"--Yarbo. A forgotten name, to be sure (at least ever since the 1949 release of Stern vom Broadway (1949), featuring Yarbo's final onscreen appearance, uncredited as were the great majority, in a career spanning not quite 15 years), yet the face that goes with that name will likely prove familiar to connoisseurs of Hollywood's \"Golden Age.\"\n\nYarbo (nÃ©e Yarbough) was an African-American actress, comedienne, dancer and singer, of both stage and screen. Born in Washington, D.C. on Friday, March 17, 1905, parents unknown (although it should be noted there is a \"Yarbough, George; fireman,\" listed in the 1904, -05 and -06 D.C. Directories), Billie eventually made her way to New York, as did both her mother and at least one sister--though exactly when this happened and whether they made this pilgrimage all at once or separately and at different times remains unclear. By her early twenties, Yarbo--credited, prior to 1928, as Billie Yarbough--was a rising star, both in Harlem night spots and on the Broadway stage. Her early stage work, occasionally likened to that of her contemporary, Josephine Baker, was embraced by audiences and critics alike, beginning in the late 1920s and continuing until her 1936 screen debut.\n\nIndeed, just a few years prior to launching his own screenwriting career, a young Charles Brackett, writing of Yarbo's breakout performance in the Broadway revue, \"Keep Shufflin,'\" registered his most emphatic 'thumbs up' in the March 10 New Yorker: \"There is a Miss Billie Yarbough, who must have been designed by Covarrubias and must be seen.\" Granted, the Covarrubias reference may have been entirely lost on a sizable portion of TNY's readership; nonetheless, the near-simultaneous publication of both Vyvyan Donner's eye-catching New York Times caricature / caption and Ibee's characteristically terse yet unambiguously positive Variety blurb makes a compelling case that Billie's time had indeed come.\n\nYet despite what seemed a thriving stage career, both as a highly acclaimed dancer and, at the very least, a hugely self-assured singer (\"To hell with Billie Holiday,\" as Yarbo later admonished jazz trumpeter Buck Clayton, \"come down and listen to me--the real Billie!\"), it is strictly her film work--undeniably more lucrative but affording relatively little margin for creativity or self-expression--for which Yarbo's face has come to be remembered. She appeared in at least two films in 1936 and another the following year before getting great notices and her first onscreen credit in the otherwise indifferently received Warren William vehicle, Wives Under Suspicion (1938). For that performance and her equally acclaimed turn in director Frank Capra's star-studded, award-winning comedy, LebenskÃ¼nstler (1938), Yarbo was judged the year's best Negro comic actress by Pittsburgh Courier film critic Earl J. Morris. (In 1939, she was officially awarded that same distinction by the short-lived, Hollywood-based Sepia Theatrical Writers Guild). Indeed, even prior to 1938, the then thoroughly anonymous Yarbo--in Alfred L. Werker's much-rewritten Big Town Girl (1937)--managed to catch the eye of one discerning Philadelphia Inquirer critic, the suitably inquisitive Mildred Martin:\n\n\"... and a Negro lassie--inexcusably omitted from the cast list--renders yeoman service and considerable comedy as the \"countess' \" maid\".\n\nAwards and critical plaudits aside, and notwithstanding the career-building intentions ascribed to her erstwhile director King Vidor (following Yarbo's sophomore screen turn, appearing uncredited alongside Barbara Stanwyck in Stella Dallas (1937)), Yarbo continued to be routinely cast in bit parts, primarily as a maid, cook or otherwise low-skilled worker, often uncredited, appearing in close to 50 films between 1936 and 1949.\n\nOne melancholy footnote:\n\nIn the fall of 1943, amidst an otherwise setback-laden half-decade (with her immediate family beset by both sudden death and serious illness), a potentially career-altering opportunity for Billie--appearing in a straight dramatic role alongside Canada Lee, under Orson Welles's direction, in what most likely would have become the definitive screen version of Richard Wright's \"Native Son\"--fell by the wayside when Welles proved unavailable. Not quite one month later, a near fatal car crash added injury to insult, putting Yarbo out of commission for the first half of 1944, and setting the stage for an uncharacteristically light workload over the remaining five years of her screen career; going out much as it had come in--i.e. with an almost entirely uncredited whimper.\n\nAs if to add one final insult, said career concluded with this onetime must-see musical comedy wunderkind--forever denied the opportunity to translate her own unique, exhilarating and much-lauded skill set from stage to screen--reduced to portraying the maid of the celebrated but considerably less distinctive stage-AND-screen musical comedy star Marilyn Miller (as portrayed by June Haver, no less; a movies-only song-'n'-dance star of decidedly lesser proportions then either Yarbo or Miller, who nonetheless, in the course of her own relatively short-lived, nondescript career, achieved far greater fame than Billie Yarbough ever would).\n\nThelma McQueen attended public school in Augusta, Georgia and graduated from high school in Long Island, New York. She studied dance with Katherine Dunham, Geoffrey Holder, and Janet Collins. She danced with the Venezuela Jones Negro Youth Group. The \"Butterfly\" stage name, which does describe her constantly moving arms, actually derives from dancing the \"Butterfly Ballet\" in a 1935 production of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\". Her stage debut was in \"Brown Sugar,\" directed by George Abbott for whom she did several other stage shows. In 1939 she appeared as the shop girls' assistant Lulu in Die Frauen (1939) and in her most famous role, the irresponsible, whiny Prissy of Vom Winde verweht (1939) (\"Oh, Miss Scarlett, I don't know nuthin' 'bout birthin' babies\").\n\nTwo other notable appearances among her string of silly maid parts were in San Franzisko Lilly (1945) and Solange ein Herz schlÃ¤gt (1945). From 1947 to 1951, she was a regular on the radio show \"Beulah\" and then in the TV version 1950-52.\n\nIn 1980, a Greyhound Bus Lines guard mistook her for a pickpocket and handled her roughly, throwing her against a bench and cracking several of her ribs. She sued for assault, and after several years of litigation, she was awarded $60,000. She chose to live very frugally on the money and retired to a small town outside Augusta, Georgia, where she lived in anonymity in a modest one-bedroom cottage.\n\nOn the night of Dec. 22, 1995, a fire broke out in her home, and she was found by firefighters lying on the sidewalk outside with severe burns over 70 percent of her body. She said her clothes caught fire while she was trying to light a kerosene heater in her cottage, which was destroyed by the fire. She was taken to Augusta Regional Medical Center, where she died at age 84.\n\nDorothy Jean Dandridge was born on November 9, 1922 in Cleveland, Ohio, to Ruby Dandridge (nÃ©e Ruby Jean Butler), an entertainer, and Cyril H. Dandridge, a cabinet maker and minister. Under the prodding of her mother, Dorothy and her sister Vivian Dandridge began performing publicly, usually in black Baptist churches throughout the country. Her mother would often join her daughters on stage. As the depression worsened, Dorothy and her family picked up and moved to Los Angeles where they had hopes of finding better work, perhaps in film. Her first film was in the Marx Brothers comedy, Das GroÃe Rennen (1937). It was only a bit part but Dandridge hoped it would blossom into something better. She only appeared in another film in 1940, in Four Shall Die (1940).\n\nMeanwhile, she dropped out of high school and became part of a musical trio which performed with the orchestra of Jimmie Lunceford. During the late 30s, she dated music composer Phil Moore, who was instrumental in launching her career as a nightclub singer and big band vocalist.\n\nHer next few screen roles in the early 1940s tended to be small stereotypical roles of black girls or princesses - such as Bahama Passage (1941) and Drums of the Congo (1942), She was the singing star of the western themed all-black-cast \"soundie\" (short musical) Cow-Cow Boogie (1942) and appeared in movies that showcased her talents as actress and singer, like Hit Parade of 1943 (1943) as the vocalist of Count Basie's Band, and twice as the vocalist of Louis Armstrong's Band in Pillow to Post (1945) and Atlantic City (1944).\n\nThose brought her headline acts in the nation's finest hotel nightclubs in New York, Miami, Chicago and Las Vegas. She may have been allowed to sing in these fine hotels but, because of racism, she couldn't have a room in any of them. It was reported that one hotel drained its swimming pool to keep her from enjoying that amenity.\n\nIn 1954, she appeared in the all-black production of Carmen Jones (1954) in the title role. She was so superb in that picture that she garnered an Academy Award nomination but lost to Grace Kelly in Ein MÃ¤dchen vom Lande (1954). She did not get another movie role until Tamango (1958), an Italian film. She did six more films, including, most notably, HeiÃe Erde (1957) and Porgy und Bess (1959). The last movie in which she would ever appear was The Murder Men (1962) (1961).\n\nDandridge faded quickly after that, due to an ill-considered marriage to Jack Dennison (her first husband was Harold Nicholas), poor investments, financial woes, and alcoholism.\n\nShe was found dead in her apartment at 8495 Fountain Avenue, West Hollywood, on September 8, 1965, aged 42, from barbiturate poisoning. She left $2.14 in her bank account, and a handwritten letter: \"In case of my death - whoever discovers it - Don't remove anything I have on - scarf, gown, or underwear. Cremate me right away - if I have any money, furniture, give it to my mother, Ruby Dandridge - She will know what to do.\". She was cremated and her ashes were interred in the Freedom Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.\n\nShe was posthumously awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6719 Hollywood Blvd. on January 18, 1983.\n\nNina Mae McKinney is known as the seductress \"Chick\" from Hallelujah (1929), the first all-black, all-sound musical. Even though she was acknowledged as a great actress, singer and dancer by audiences in the U.S. and Europe, today she is mostly forgotten. She certainly had the looks, enthusiasm, and acting talent to succeed. But as she and other black women of her time learned, there wasn't much work for a black woman other than as a maid, \"mammy\" figure, or prostitute. Hollywood was scared to take a chance on an attractive black woman, to make her into a glamorous sex symbol as they would with an attractive white actress. There would be no true glamorous black female sex symbol until Lena Horne's arrival in 1942. Nina learned, as did other black actresses, that there was little success to be had after an initial big splash.\n\nMcKinney was born in 1913 in the small town of Lancaster, South Carolina, eventually to become an international figure as an actress, singer and band leader. Her given name was Nannie Mayme McKinney. Her parents, Hal and Georgia McKinney, moved from Lancaster to New York City and left the child with her great-aunt, Carrie Sanders. \"Aunt Carrie\" lived in a small apartment in the backyard of Col. Leroy Springs, father of businessman and flying ace Elliott White Springs. Aunt Carrie worked as a cook and housekeeper for the Springs family. As soon as Nannie Mayme was old enough she ran errands for Lena Jones Springs, who gave her a bicycle to ride to the post office to pick up the mail. Nannie Mayme's first public performances were riding stunts, or \"cutting capers\", as amazed bystanders called it. She appeared in plays at the black Lancaster Industrial School (founded by Springs), where she quickly learned the lines of the entire cast.\n\nAt about age 13 she headed for New York to stay with her mother, Georgia Crawford McKinney. Choosing Nina Mae as her stage name, she managed to get a job as a chorus girl in the Broadway play \"Blackbirds\". Her lively performance caught the attention of MGM producer/director King Vidor, who gave her a starring role in Hallelujah (1929). It was the first all-black sound musical features, even though many theaters billed the film as \"a story of murder and redemption in the Deep South.\" This melodrama was not widely acclaimed at the time, but movie historians now see it as an interesting introduction to black theater (one critic described it as having \"a crude power\").\n\nNina was signed by MGM to a five-year contract, but in that period she made only two films, Safe in Hell (1931) and Die Ã¶ffentliche Meinung (1935) (in which she didn't even appear on screen; she dubbed Jean Harlow's songs). Hollywood could accept black character actresses like Hattie McDaniel and Butterfly McQueen having a close relationship with white characters in a film, but would not allow a beautiful black actress the same natural role. However, her first film gave her the opportunity to appear in a number of all-black cast or black-themed films, including Bosambo (1935) with Paul Robeson, Dark Waters (1944) and Pinky (1949) (as Rozelia), which is considered her finest film.\n\nShe had much more success on stage. She played Jeanne Eagels' role in \"Rain\" at Harlem's famed Apollo Theatre. She proved that she could well have become one of America's enduring performers--she had the talent, the beauty, and the star power, but she realized that the doors to real success were permanently barred to her in Hollywood. She soon left the U.S. for Europe. She made film and stage appearances all over the Continent, from Paris and London to Dublin and Budapest, and became known as \"The Black Garbo\".\n\nWhen war broke out in Europe she returned to New York, where she married jazz musician Jimmy Monroe and put together a band and toured the country. In the 1950s and 1960s she lived in Athens, Greece, where she was known as the \"Queen of Night Life.\" In the late 1960s she came back to New York but did not perform, and died in New York City in 1967, at age 54, of a heart attack. Her death went virtually unnoticed; trade papers such as Variety and black publications such as Jet and Ebony didn't even print an obituary, and one newspaper that did only called her an \"entertainer\" and didn't name the church where the funeral would be held.\n\nNot everyone forgot her, though; in her home town of Lancaster, South Carolina, on a wall across from the Courthouse, is a mural with portraits of famous people from Lancaster. Among them two faces stand out. One is former President Andrew Jackson. The other is Nina.\n\nSAG Award and Critics Choice Award winner for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, Lorraine Toussaint shocked audiences on the smash hit Netflix original series \"Orange is the New Black\" as the viciously seductive inmate Vee. Toussaint's thrilling performance has won her glowing reviews from the likes of TV Guide and Vanity Fair, stirring the Emmy buzz for her outstanding performance. Toussaint also received praise for her performance in the Academy Award-nominated feature film \"Selma.\" Up next, Toussaint will star in the new Fox series \"Rosewood\", alongside Morris Chestnut, which premieres this fall.\n\nBorn in Trinidad, Toussaint and her mother moved to Brooklyn, NY, where she was raised, when she was ten years old. Growing up, she watched a lot of television while she waited for her mother to return from work, and this sparked her interest in acting. Toussaint begged her mother to enroll her in acting school, and her search led to her studying theater at New York's renowned High School of Performing Arts. After graduation, she enrolled in the Juilliard School's drama division, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. On her graduation day, she landed her first paying job as Lady Macbeth with \"Shakespeare & Company.\"\n\nToussaint spent the first 12 years of her career acting on stage in New York City before moving to Los Angeles. Her first television appearance was in 1983 in \"The Face of Rage.\" Toussaint's biggest career boost has come from her co-starring role opposite Annie Potts in the TV series \"Any Day Now,\" which earned Toussaint an NAACP Image Award nomination for best actress in a drama series, a TV Guide Award nomination for Best Actress in a Drama Series, and the Wiley A. Branton Award from the National Bar Association.\n\nAmong Toussaint's TV credits were recurring roles on several popular television shows, such as NBC's drama series \"Friday Night Lights,\" TNT's \"Saving Grace,\" \"Law & Order,\" and ABC's hit \"Ugly Betty.\" She has also had several guest appearances on the hit television shows \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,\" \"Grey's Anatomy,\" and the drama thriller \"Scandal\" opposite Kerry Washington.\n\nNo stranger to the silver screen, Touissant's first film role was opposite Burt Reynolds in the crime comedy \"Breaking In.\" Touissant has also appeared in \"Dangerous Minds,\" \"The Soloist,\" and Ava DuVernay's \"Middle of Nowhere,\" in which her performance was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female. Up next, Toussaint stars as Salome Whitmore in the upcoming period drama \"Sophie and the Rising Sun,\" written and directed by Maggie Greenwald. Toussaint will also play Anthony Mackie's mother in the upcoming Seth Rogen comedy \"X-Mas,\" scheduled for theaters this November.\n\nToussaint and her daughter split their time between New York and Los Angeles."
