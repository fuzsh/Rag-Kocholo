        "text": "Black actors were typecast even prior to gaining starring roles that skyrocketed their careers. They were booked for minuscule parts that saw less than ten minutes of screen time, and if it exceeded that, they were “the help” (i.e., maids, butlers) in box office films or popular television productions.\n\nMany had to work tirelessly to flatten the box they were closed in, opting to play loving wives and mothers, businesswomen, singers, and so on. We may know Esther Rolle as Florida Evans on Norman Lear’s hit Seventies show Good Times—the God-fearing wife and mother who stood by her beliefs of “making it out” the Ghetto in the most truthful way possible, but Rolle was more than that.\n\nWe witnessed, on live TV or through reruns, Theresa Merritt play Eloise “Mama” Curtis on the 1974 ABC series That’s My Mama—a widow who aims to convince her son to leave the bachelor lifestyle behind and settle down, but Merritt was more than that.\n\nNell Carter had a voice that demanded attention when she belted out a tune, but we know her as Nell Harper—a no-nonsense housekeeper who served as a mother to a police chief’s three daughters, but Carter was more than that.\n\nThese actresses and countless others paved the way for our favorite legends like Viola Davis, Taraji P. Henson, Regina King, Angela Bassett, and more.\n\nFor Black History Month, let’s highlight Rolle, Merritt, and Carter and their versatile careers.\n\nEsther Rolle\n\nShort bio: Born on November 8, 1920, Esther Elizabeth Rolle started her career as a dancer who worked her way to the stage. Rolle’s theater debut was in 1962.\n\nPopular role: Florida Evans (Good Times, 1974 -1979). The series was a spin-off of Maude, where the character of Florida was born (she was Maude’s housekeeper).\n\nOther roles: Ruth (Summer of My German Soldier, 1978), which garnered an Emmy win. Colleen Jensen (The Incredible Hulk, 1979), Grandma Rose (Poltergeist: The Legacy, 1998), plus more.\n\nNon-acting related projects: Rolle released an album titled The Garden of My Mind in 1975.\n\nTheresa Merritt\n\nShort bio: Born on September 24, 1922, Theresa Merritt Hines began her career in various theatrical productions before going to television and film.\n\nPopular role: Ma Rainey (Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, the original 1984 Broadway play), which gave her a Tony Award nomination. Eloise “Mama” Curtis (That’s My Mama, 1974-1975) and Aunt Em (The Wiz, 1978).\n\nOther roles: Faye (The Love Boat, 1983), Ruth Titus (Law & Order, 1997), Grandma Sarah (Sesame Street, 1997), plus more.\n\nNell Carter\n\nShort bio: Born on September 13, 1948, Nell Ruth Hardy began her career on Broadway with a voice like no other. She also changed her surname to Carter and landed her first role in 1971.\n\nPopular role: Nell Harper (Gimmie A Break!, 1981-1987), which gave her both Golden Globe and Emmy Award nominations.
