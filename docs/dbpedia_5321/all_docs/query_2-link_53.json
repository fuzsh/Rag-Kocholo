        "text": "The Good Times cast came into our living rooms in the 1970s and stood out as a beacon of humor, heart and social commentary. Created by Eric Monte and Mike Evans, with Norman Lear as executive producer, the show first aired on February 8, 1974, and quickly became a cultural phenomenon that resonated with audiences for its portrayal of a Black family navigating the challenges of inner-city life. Running for six seasons until August 1, 1979, the show’s success was marked not only by its popularity, but also by the enduring impact it had on the landscape of television.\n\nGood Times was a spin-off of the popular series Maude and centered around the Evans family, who lived in the Cabrini-Green housing projects of Chicago. The show dealt with real-life issues like poverty, racism, and the struggle for upward mobility, all while infusing humor into the narrative. The main characters included James Evans, portrayed by John Amos, his wife Florida Evans, played by Esther Rolle, and their three children – J.J., Thelma, and Michael, portrayed by Jimmie Walker, BernNadette Stanis and Ralph Carter.\n\nThe show garnered critical acclaim for its authentic portrayal of African American life, earning a devoted fanbase. Its unique blend of comedy and social commentary set it apart from other sitcoms of the time, making Good Times a trailblazer in depicting the challenges faced by Black families in America.\n\nThe Evans family became a symbol of resilience and unity, resonating with viewers of all backgrounds.\n\nDid you know? Good Times was a spin-off of a spin-off. It was a spin-off of Maude, which was itself a spin-off of All in the Family. And a young Janet Jackson joined the cast in the fifth season.\n\nGood Times cast then and now\n\nJohn Amos as James Evans\n\nBorn in 1939, in Newark, New Jersey, John Amos portrayed James Evans, the patriarch of the Evans family. His strong, no-nonsense demeanor and unwavering commitment to his family made him a beloved character on the show.\n\nPrior to joining the Good Times cast, Amos played the role of Gordy, the weatherman in the The Mary Tyler Moore Show. He was on that show for three seasons, then he landed the recurring role of the sporadically-unemployed husband of maid Florida Evans (played by Esther Rolle) on Norman Lear’s Maude. The two characters were such a hit that Lear used them as the parental leads in the spin-off Good Times.\n\nAfter Good Times, Amos continue to act and appeared in several movies including Die Hard 2 and Coming to America. He was most recently seen in 2023’s The Last Rifleman.\n\nDid you know? Amos was not happy when Good Times shifted away from his character and more toward the silly antics of his on-screen son JJ, the aimless, egotistical, jive-talking teenager. Amos started to clash with higher-ups and in 1976 he was released from the series. His character was killed in an off-camera car accident.\n\nEsther Rolle as Florida Evans\n\nBorn in 1920, in Pompano Beach, Florida, Esther Rolle played Florida Evans in the Good Times cast.

Carter told ABC, “I was fortunate to be in the explosion, not only of the African American theater in the 1970s but into that wave of consciousness and beautiful television productions that featured African American artists. I’m very grateful for the people who taught me along the way.\n\nAfter Good Times, Carter returned to the theater. In fact, in 1989 Carter reunited with his former co-star John Amos on the stage in the production of Pass is the Pass. Today, Carter is the vice president of the Audience Development Committee, an organization dedicated to celebrating the contributions of African Americans to the theater world.\n\nDid you know?
