I think in a past life I must have been poor and lived in the ghetto because I feel at home watching this show. On a side note the building that “Good Times” takes place in is called “Cabrini–Green” this is also the same building that the movie “Candyman” takes place in.\n\nhere is my favorite moment on “Good Times“, Florida Evans is dealing with her husband’s death and finally break down.\n\nLearn more about this amazing person on IMDB.com"
