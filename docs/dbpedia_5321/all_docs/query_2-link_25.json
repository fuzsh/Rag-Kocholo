        "text": "One of the greatest TV sitcoms of the 70‚Äôs is Good Times. We‚Äôve all seen Good Times. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre black or white, we‚Äôve all seen it. The show wasn‚Äôt just great for its time but it is still relevant to this day. You can still watch reruns of Good Times to this day! You can name every episode, quote every line, sing every lyric to the theme song and off course know all the characters and the catchphrases. It was a great show (one of my favorites) that shaped black history and culture. We‚Äôve never seen a black two parent family household on TV trying to make ends meet until we saw Good Times. It addressed real issues and showed a family that had good morals and Christian values. Good Times was more realistic to us growing up in black neighborhoods. The show has had a tremendous impact on all of our lives and childhood rather you‚Äôre young or old. You will stop everything you‚Äôre doing to watch an episode of Good Times. It was that legendary and iconic. The show taught me gratitude. Seeing a family that was poor and struggling yet they were calling it good times. Everyone could laugh at JJ, learn something from little Michael and every guy has fallen in love with Thelma (she‚Äôs just that beautiful). Everyone could relate to James‚Äô parenting method and Florida‚Äôs calm ways. Everyone knew someone like Willona who gossiped and everyone has a Bookman who can be a pain in the butt and a bother. We cannot deny the fact that the show changed our lives and the world. But one thing we cannot deny is the toxicity that was on the set, behind the scenes. Watching a documentary today on Good Times taught me that everything wasn‚Äôt peaches and cream like it appeared on the show. Matter of fact the cast was dysfunctional which caused the great show to decline. Let‚Äôs learn what Good Times can teach us about leadership.\n\nTraits And Signs Of A Dysfunctional Team Heading For Decline (Modeled After The Good Times Cast)‚Ä¶\n\n1. The Need For Control\n\nGood Times was apparently supposed to be a spinoff of a show called, Maude. I‚Äôve never seen the show before. But basically Good Times was going to be for Esther Rolle (Florida), the show was going to be about her. The show was originally intended for to show a black single mother raising her kids (similar to what later What‚Äôs Happening would be about). But Esther wasn‚Äôt doing the show unless she had a husband and the kids‚Äô had a father. John Amos (James) then became the dad. This show was basically Esther‚Äôs show and I believe she let that power get to her head. She wanted to then control everything. Which almost resulted in Ja‚ÄôNet DuBois not being Willona. Esther got upset because she didn‚Äôt get to do the hiring. She originally didn‚Äôt want Ja‚ÄôNet DuBois to be on the show. Pride sunk in and she wanted to control how things were done. Just because the show was written around her being the lead character doesn‚Äôt mean she could make the leadership decisions. When we always have to be in control we can mess things up for us or for the good of the overall team.\n\n2. Jealousy\n\nAfter the first episode of Good Times, JJ‚Äôs saying ‚ÄúDYNOMITE‚Äù became popular. The writers saw the audiences‚Äô reaction and it stuck. It became the catchphrase of the show resulting in JJ (Jimmie Walker) being the main character; ‚Äúthe star of the show.‚Äù With young Walker having a moment to shine, jealousy began to arouse between the cast. Esther (Florida) and John (James) became envious of Jimmie (JJ) because the show no longer became about them. Which resulted in John later walking away after season 3.\n\n3. Debates Without Resolve\n\nWe have to learn how to argue effectively. Arguing effectively means we talk about something and it ends in a mutual decision or favorable result. Good Times was a black sitcom written by white writers. Of course the writers couldn‚Äôt relate to the characters because of a difference in racial and cultural background/upbringing. John Amos (James) didn‚Äôt like the direction of the show, he went against it and he was asked to leave. Esther Rolle (Florida) who later left the show because she demanded more money and they refused to give her more. She eventually came back for the last season. The fact that the writers couldn‚Äôt agree caused them to lose the two parents (who were extremely vital to the show).\n\n4. Failure To Connect\n\nAn interview with Jimmie Walker revealed that the cast did absolutely NOTHING together. Besides recording the show, off the camera they had NOTHING to do with each other! They never talked! There was no genuine relationship. Jimmie (JJ) didn‚Äôt have Esther‚Äôs (Florida) or John‚Äôs (James) phone number. He hung out with Bern Nadette Stanis (Thelma) once she recalls. He said not a word to Janet Jackson (Penny) claiming he doesn‚Äôt talk to kids. And Ja‚ÄôNet DuBois (Willona) believed Jimmie (JJ) didn‚Äôt like her. Maybe Jimmie was the problem. Was he becoming cocky and arrogant? Were they intimidated by his success? What if they were all mad and jealous of him? Who knows? The real question is: How do you work with people you don‚Äôt talk to or connect with? Teammates should build relationships with each other if they want longevity in working together.\n\n5. Grasping For Survival\n\nAfter John (James) left the show (end of season 3), Good Times‚Äô ratings went down. When John left the show, the show died. Esther (Florida) couldn‚Äôt do it on her own. So then they got Moses Gunn to play Carl who became Florida‚Äôs love interest. Carl‚Äôs job was to take James‚Äô role and that was an epic fail. Then when Esther left the show, Jimmie (JJ) became a father figure to his siblings Thelma and Michael, and the audience didn‚Äôt like a mature grown-up JJ. So they gave Willona more opportunity and they allowed Johnny Brown (Bookman) to be in the show more. It was terrible. Then they got Janet Jackson (Penny) to be Willona‚Äôs adopted daughter. They wanted Willona to replace Florida in a motherly way. Then Esther (Florida) came back and Thelma got married to Keith (played by Ben Powers). The writers of Good Times did everything to keep the show alive but after season 3 the show was already flatlining. They were trying to save something that was already over. Ratings could‚Äôve went higher if they dealt with the toxic relationships before things got worst.\n\nLeaders we can learn something from the cast of Good Times. The show was great but the leadership was terrible. If everything rises and falls on leadership the reason for the show‚Äôs failure was the people on the team. They were a team but they didn‚Äôt know how to be team players. It was every man for himself. Selfishness, pride and jealousy was at the core root of their failure. Instead of completing each other they were competing with each other. The problem with them was they didn‚Äôt understand that everyone‚Äôs role and contribution was significant. Everyone had a part to play (big or small) which made the show a success. But when they got wrapped up into titles and who was greater they failed.\n\nBecause they failed to address/ solve minor issues beforehand it ended in a predictable major destruction. If they would‚Äôve humbled themselves, connected with other, recognized each other‚Äôs value and had a conversation the show could‚Äôve lasted longer and been a greater success; even their relationships with each other would‚Äôve been better. No doubt the show was successful (I‚Äôm not bashing your favorite show) but the leadership wasn‚Äôt good. Let‚Äôs learn from this guys.\n\nHubris, the need for control, jealousy, debate without resolve, failure to connect and recognize value and grasping for survival when it‚Äôs too late will cause your team to be dysfunctional and head for decline. Now let‚Äôs go watch an episode of Good Times. üòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nThe Documentary I Watched: üëáüëáüëá"
