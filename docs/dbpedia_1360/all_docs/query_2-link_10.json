        "text": "Ox is the second in the 12-year cycle of the Chinese zodiac sign. Years of the Ox include 1913, 1925, 1937, 1949, 1961, 1973, 1985, 1997, 2009, 2021, 2033...\n\nOxen used to be capable farming tools in an agricultural society, which attach to the symbol of diligence, persistence, and honesty. In Chinese culture, Ox is a faithful friend that made great contributions to the development of the society. Like the ox, people born in the Year of the Ox are industrious, cautious, hold their faith firmly, and always glad to offer help.\n\nIt is said that Ox ranks the second among the Chinese zodiacs because it helped the Rat but was later tricked by it. The myth goes that the Jade Emperor declared the order of zodiac signs would be based on the arrival orders of 12 animals. Ox could have arrived the first but it kindly gave a ride to Rat. However, when arriving, Rat just jumped to the terminus ahead of Ox, and thus Ox lost the first place\n\nEarthly Branch of Birth Year: Chou\n\nWu Xing (The Five Elements): Tu (Earth)\n\nYin Yang: Yin\n\nWant to know more about your love compatibility with your partner? Just fill the names and birth dates of both persons and you can test if you are true soulmates.\n\nBest Matches: Rat, Snake, Rooster\n\nThe best match of the Ox is the Rat as they can complement with each other, while the Ox and the Snake have the same beliefs and are deeply attracted by each other. The Ox and the Rooster are easy to get along well with each other and find common hobbies so that they can enjoy life together.\n\nBad Matches: Tiger, Dragon, Horse, Sheep\n\nThe Ox should be cautious if meeting partners with zodiacs of Tiger, Dragon, Horse, and Sheep because they may have different values, and quarrels may be frequent in daily life. Different life styles also bring a lot of conflicts.\n\nHow to Get along with Oxen\n\nMost Ox people will give their heart and soul when falling in love with somebody but won't let a relationship come to light until it’s stable, which means their partner should be more patient. They prefer a mature partner and never want to get along with flirtatious people. So sometimes they may choose to wait for a long time to find a soulmate rather than build a relationship quickly. What’s more, the Oxen cherish the family and it is necessary to win recognition of their family members."
