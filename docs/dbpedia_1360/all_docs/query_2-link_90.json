        "text": "Life expectancy is calculated using a statistical tool called a life table. A life table is generated from current age- and sex-specific death rates in a given population. The resulting values are used to estimate the likelihood of someone in a hypothetical population dying before their next birthday.\n\nCalculating a person’s life expectancy is based on death patterns in the population and assumes that current death rates will persist throughout that person’s life.\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) publishes life tables and calculates life expectancy for the Australian population and for some groups of the population (ABS 2022). These measures are based on 3 years of data to reduce the effect of variations in death rates from year to year.\n\nLife expectancy is related to the average age at death within a population and is inversely related to the population death rates at that time; that is, the lower the death rates the greater the life expectancy. It varies between population groups and over time. High life expectancy is often associated with low infant and child death rates, an ageing population and access to high quality health care.\n\nDifferences in life expectancy over time may be due to changes in the patterns of death due to certain conditions. For example, in 1922, infectious disease accounted for 15% of all deaths in Australia and on average people dying from these diseases were 27 years old. By comparison, in 2022, infectious diseases (excluding COVID-19) accounted for less than 2% of deaths and the average age at death for these diseases was 80 years.
