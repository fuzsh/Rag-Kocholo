        "text": "While most records of the Department of State relate in some way to the planning and implementation of American foreign policy and relations, the files include documentation relating to individuals. Some series of records particularly lend themselves to use in genealogical study. Those records are primarily found in the following two record groups.\n\nRecord Group 59: General Records of the Department of State\n\nRecord Group 84: Records of Foreign Service Posts of the Department of State\n\nRecord Group 59: General Records of the Department of State\n\nThere are files in this record group relating both to people who served as officials in government service and to individual persons.\n\nI. Individuals\n\nName Card Index. For each segment of the Department's central file there are cards, which serve as a finding aid for communications to, from, or about private persons or organizations. Researchers cannot rely on the name cards to locate all documents relating to or mentioning a given individual. While the name index is an important tool and can assist with indentifying documents and files of interest, the coverage is limited. Name cards do not exist for every name mentioned in the records, or there may only be one card leading to a file with many documents. To locate all pertinent documentation, one must determine the file designation most likely to contain records of interest and then make a document-by-document search. While this can be laborious, it will result in the most comprehensive results. The cards are divided into segments matching those of the records to which they relate:\n\n1906-10: Numerical and Minor File\n\n1910-29: Central Decimal File\n\n1930-39: Central Decimal File\n\n1940-44: Central Decimal File\n\n1945-49: Central Decimal File\n\n1950-54: Central Decimal File\n\n1955-59: Central Decimal File\n\n1960-January 1963: Central Decimal File\n\nFebruary-December 1963: Subject-Numeric File\n\n1964-66: Subject-Numeric File\n\n1967-69: Subject-Numeric File\n\n1970-73: Subject-Numeric File\n\nThe Name Cards for 1910-1959 are available for research. The Name Cards for 1960-1973 are classified and are not available to researchers. NARA reference staff can perform very limited searches in the classified index for researchers.\n\nPassport Applications\n\nThe Department of State is responsible for issuing passports. Except for brief periods during the Civil War (August 19, 1861 to March 17, 1862) and World War I (1915-1922), U.S. citizens did not require passports for travel overseas until 1941. Since then, American citizens traveling overseas have been required to hold passports. The National Archives holds passport applications only to March 1925. Passport applications after that date remain in the custody of the Department of State.\n\nSee more information about passports and passport applications\n\nThe following series of passport applications in this record group have been digitized by a partner and are available at all NARA facilities. Those with a highlighted entry number are available through the Catalog, albeit without the search capability provided by the partner.\n\nFor information about gaining access to passport applications retained by the Department of State, see here.\n\nVisa Applications\n\nThe Department of State issues visas to foreigners traveling to the United States. Except for a brief time during the Civil War (1861-1865), before World War I, alien visitors did not require visas passports in order to enter the United States. The practice of requiring all aliens to obtain visas from U.S. officials abroad before departure for the United States began in 1917 as a war measure during World War I, and has continued since then.\n\nThere is one series of Visa Case Files covering the period 1914-1940. It is divided into three chronological segments: 1914-1923, 1924-1932, and 1933-1940, each arranged alphabetically by name. With the exception of precedent cases and files that contain policy material, individual case files for 1914-23 and 1924-32 have been destroyed. Visa case files since 1940 have not been preserved.\n\nFor more information about Department of State visa records and related records of other agencies, please see this reference report.\n\nBirth Reports\n\nAmericans giving birth overseas often reported that event to the local American diplomatic or consular establishment, which would complete the requisite form and send it to the Department of State. The National Archives holds a separate collection of those reports for the 1910-49 period. Earlier reports might be among the Department's central files; later reports remain in the custody of the Department of State.\n\nThe 1910-49 reports have been digitized and are available at all NARA facilities.\n\nFor information about gaining access to birth reports retained by the Department of State, see here; for Panama Canal Zone birth records, see here.\n\nMarriage Reports\n\nAmericans marrying overseas often reported that event to the local American diplomatic or consular establishment, which would complete the requisite form and send it to the Department of State. The National Archives holds a separate collection of those reports for the 1910-49 period. Earlier reports might be among the Department's central files; later reports remain in the custody of the Department of State.\n\nThe 1910-49 reports, maintained in the central file of the Passport Office, have been digitized and are available at all NARA facilities.\n\nAdditional records are found in the series \"Certificates of Witness to Marriage, 1925-1987.\"\n\nFor information about gaining access to marriage reports retained by the Department of State, see here.\n\nDeath Notices and Reports\n\nSince at least 1835, one of the duties of consular officers has been to report to the Department of State information about U.S. citizens who have died within their consular districts. Files with this information have been transferred to the National Archives. The records in the National Archives date through 1974. Reports of deaths from 1975 and later remain in the custody of the Department of State.\n\nThe records in the National Archives vary over time as the Department’s recordkeeping practices changed.\n\n1789-1906. The death reports submitted to the Department are filed among the Consular Despatches. Those records are arranged by the name of the city in which the consulate was located and thereunder chronologically. The Consular Despatches have all been microfilmed and that microfilm is now available online. To locate reports you must know the source (post), date, and despatch number. There are various findings to help:\n\n♦1789-1827. No finding aids.\n\n♦1828-1906. (a) Registers. The “Registers of Consular Despatches” are divided into two basic period: 1828-1870 (38 volumes) and 1870-1906 (14 volumes). The 1870-1906 records are available on rolls 19-32 of National Archives Microfilm Publication M17: Registers of Correspondence of the Department of State, 1870-1906. The register lists by post the incoming despatches and their subjects.\n\n(b) Other records: The “Record of Death Notices of U.S. Citizens Abroad, 1835-1855,” is a one volume, chronologically arranged listing of the death notices sent by the Department of State to a U.S. newspaper for publication. The “Notices of Deaths of U.S. Citizens Abroad, 1857-1922” is a 34 volume, chronologically arranged compilation of the form notices sent by the Department of State to newspapers reporting the deaths of U.S. citizens in foreign countries. The notices in the latter series contain the name of the deceased, the place and date of death, the consulate reporting the death, and the number and date of the despatch reporting the death. Both of these series are among the digitized records noted below.\n\n1906-1910. Reports of deaths abroad are filed in the Numerical and Minor Files. The reports are NOT among the digitized files noted below. There are two finding aids to these records that will assist with locating death reports:\n\n(a) The primary finding aid to the records is the Card Index. That index is arranged in one alphabetical run. The index card will indicate the file designation of the person carded.\n\n(b) The “Notices of Deaths of U.S. Citizens Abroad, 1857-1922,” noted above, can also assist in locating death reports in this time period.\n\nFor more information on the Numerical and Minor Files and the Card Index and links to the online resources, see here.\n\n1910-1963. The death reports are in the Central Decimal File. These records are among the digitized records noted below. There are two finding aids that will assist with locating death reports:\n\n(a) 1910-1963. The Name Card index will indicate the file designation of the person carded. If there is no entry, there is no death report.\n\n(b) For the period through 1922, the “Notices of Deaths of U.S. Citizens Abroad, 1857-1922,” noted above, can also assist in locating death reports.\n\n1963-1974. Death reports were filed apart from the central files. They are arranged by year and thereunder in rough alphabetical order. To locate a report, it is necessary to know the year as well as the name of the deceased. These records are among the digitized records noted below.\n\nThe records have been digitized and are available at all NARA facilities.\n\nFor information about gaining access to death reports retained by the Department of State, see here\n\nfor Panama Canal Zone death records, see here\n\nRecords on Military Personnel Buried Overseas\n\nAmerican Battle Monuments Commission\n\n2300 Clarendon Blvd, Suite 500\n\nArlington, VA 22201\n\nhttps://www.abmc.gov/\n\nRecords on Active Duty Military Personnel\n\nDeaths of active-duty military personnel are reported to the Department of Defense.

Arranged alphabetically by name of applicant. The files may contain applications, letters of recommendation, appointment papers, and related documentation. A list of the names is here.\n\nCard Records of Appointments Made, 1776-1968. Beginning in 1789, the Secretary of State prepared the civil commissions of U.S. officials appointed by the President, affixed the Great Seal to such documents, and kept records for such appointments. For the period 1776 to 1968, there are record cards for each person appointed and commissioned. The cards indicate the date(s) of appointment and type of position. The cards are arranged in the following time periods: 1776-1933, 1934-1953, 1954-1960, and 1961-1968.\n\nService Record Cards, 1890-1939.

Those reports, especially near the beginning or end of a person's service in an overseas position, sometimes include personal information about the officer or his subordinates. All of these records have been microfilmed.\n\n1906-1910: The Numerical and Minor Files include documentation relating to the service of diplomatic and consular officials. References to the pertinent file(s) are found in the Card Index to the Numerical and Minor Files or on the first page of the Purport Lists for the \"123\" files described under the heading on the 1910-63 records.\n\n1910-1963: Within the Central Decimal File, the file category \"123\" contains personnel-type documentation on individuals serving in the Foreign Service. Some files for the period through 1944 are arranged according to a cutter file number made up of a combination of letters and numbers (i.e. \"123 St 41\"); other earlier and all later files are simply arranged alphabetically by name (i.e. \"123 Stewart, Nathaniel B.\"). Other file categories of an administrative nature may include documentation on personnel, too.\n\n1963-1973: Within the Subject-Numeric File, there are two basic files containing personnel-type documentation on individuals serving in the Foreign Service.
