        "text": "Meucci & Bell in association with The Tank Present\n\nBotte di Ferro\n\nBy Ben Gassman\n\nDirected by Tara Elliott\n\nJULY 16 - 30, 2021 @ 8PM\n\nperformed al fresco at\n\nThe Good Fork Restaurant\n\nEXTENDED TO JULY 30TH!\n\nBotte di Ferro is a new play about the slippage between friendship, love, and lust, tangled in phone lines and served over pizza.\n\nIn Italian, a botte di ferro is literally an iron barrel, but idiomatically it refers to absolute protection, a safe, quasi-sacred place. The play examines a fraught and complex romance between two outer-borough New Yorkers as such a space. Her (an elementary school teacher from South-Brooklyn who self-publishes children’s books and summers in the Hamptons) and Him (a chef from Eastern-Queens who climbs a long ladder of kitchen jobs to his own place) met as kids in summer camp. As their lives diverge, prodded by different cultural-familial frameworks, they continue returning to each other in search of the best versions of themselves.\n\nDrifting into the magic of memory, the story begins and ends at Pizzeria Botte di Ferro in Naples, ruminating on the power of place and the relationship between origin and authenticity. Botte di Ferro asks how we care for the people who have hurt us and what happens when we set aside preconceptions and look at what’s in front of us?\n\nTARA M.
