        "text": "When I was in sixth grade, I made a decision that changed the course of my life. I decided not to try out for the middle school swim team. I know that might not sound like a big deal, but it was. As a grade schooler I was a standout swimmer — strong shoulders and back, and well-muscled legs that powered me through the water with ease and speed. I was disciplined, obsessive. My form was excellent. My coach saw potential.\n\nHad I stuck with it, my life might have turned out pretty different. I might have been a popular jock rather than a lonely weirdo. I might have become a varsity athlete who won admission to a top college rather than a barely graduated teenager who had to take remedial math at a community college to scrape my way into a not-very-competitive school.\n\nI have been thinking about this decision a lot lately, because many of us have been forced, regardless of whether we want to, to think about children and the decisions we allow them to make, and what it might mean for them to regret those decisions. I am speaking, of course, about the ongoing war over transgender and gender-nonconforming children.\n\nFor people on the right who oppose gender transition at any age, the argument is simple: There are two genders, and people who think they are a different sex or gender than the one they were assigned at birth are delusional; indulging that delusion is wrong. Biological reality requires all people to simply live with the gender associated with their birth sex. (Unless they are intersex, in which case it is evidently OK for parents and doctors to decide and surgically alter a child’s body to conform with that decision without the child’s consent or even knowledge.)\n\nFor those liberals and progressives who fret about the rapidly changing gender landscape, the agonized argument over gender-affirming care for children is different. As this thinking goes, there is a small category of people who were born in the wrong bodies, and those individuals are entitled to express their identities. But when children say they are one of these people, we must be extremely careful and rigorous in being absolutely certain that their gender identities have been unearthed and verified through a lengthy medical and psychiatric inquiry before they are validated by social, legal and medical interventions. We must be sure that this is the pure expression of an immutable self, not simply the adoption of a fad or the byproduct of autism or bipolar disorder. The possibility that children might make irreversible decisions on this particular question that they later regret is, for many people, simply intolerable. Transition, to borrow a phrase, should be safe, legal and rare.\n\nWe allow children to make irreversible decisions about their lives all the time, ideally with the guidance and support of the communities that care for them. Sometimes they regret those decisions. The stakes vary, but they are real. So what are we saying, really, when we worry that a child will regret this particular decision, the decision to transition? And how is it different, really, from the decision I made to quit competitive swimming? To many people — I am guessing most — this question is absurd. How could you possibly compare something as fundamental and consequential to one’s life as gender to something that seems comparatively trivial, competitive sport?\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
