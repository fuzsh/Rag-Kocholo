CHARLES EARLE FUNK, LITT.D. ASSOCIATE EDITORS RONALD S. KAIN, PHILIP COAN, HELEN READY BIRD FUNK & WAGNALLS COMPANY NEW YORK AND LONDON 1939 COPYRIGHT, 1939, BY FUNK & WAGNALLS COMPANY [Printed in the United States of America] PREFACE ELSEWHERE in this issue of THE NEW INTERNATIONAL YEAR BOOK is recorded the death, after a short illness, of its late Editor, DR. FRANK H. VIZETELLY. The plan and organization of this YEAR BOOK, however, had been so fully developed by him that the present Editor has had little to do except to carry the work to its completion. Whatever the degree to which this record has reached the high standards set in former years is therefore due to the genius of its late Editor and to the loyal co-operation of his associates and staff. No change in the editorial policy has been made except in the reduction of the length of certain articles of less general interest in order to provide additional space in which to record the many surprising events of the year. As in previous years, the YEAR BOOK covers the outstanding events and developments in all fields of interest during 1938: Sports and Spanish Literature; Botany and Boy Scouts; Theology and Geol- ogy ; Military Progress and Peace Conferences — whatever the year has produced in agriculture, art, science, law, medicine, philosophy, politics, or other activity that our large staff of contributors and ed- itors has considered to be worthy of note is recorded herein. Economic and industrial conditions in the United States showed little change, either for the better or for the worse, during the first half of the year. But, in the words of MR. PHILIP COAN, whose de- partment embraces each of the 48 States and the United States as a whole : \"The return of economic adversity, which began in 1937, made itself felt throughout the Nation in 1938. The Federal Government had recourse anew to widespread dispensations of public money. While business, under this stimulus, improved from June until early December, the year closed without defi- nite indication as to whether the gain could be maintained without persistent administration of the stimulant. Legislation in the field of social planning, though less abundant than in most of the previ- ous five years, included the enactment of a system for Federal regulation of wages and hours of em- ployment in interstate industries — another and a potentially important Federal intervention in social and economic relations. Dissension within the Tennessee Valley Authority led Congress to investigate the conduct and policies of this foremost of the Federal ventures into the field of economic production. \"Elections to the 76th Congress brought about an altered alignment both among the lawgivers and among the people of the United States ; the popular votes cast in the State primary elections and in the general election of November 8 not only strengthened the Republicans and anti- Administration Democrats in Congress, at the cost of the New Deal's supporters, but also made evident a consider- able popular shift away from the liberalism of the Administration. The proposals and policies of President Roosevelt had won ample support in each of three previous elections to Congress ; the turn of this long-persistent tide of sentiment, as seen in the vote of 1938, rendered the elections the most im- portant domestic occurrence of the year. Since the apparent change in the people's views might affect the conduct of the Nation's affairs for some time to come, the articles on the United States and on the individual States give the election somewhat extended treatment, as a matter fundamental to the com- prehension of events to come.\" Full treatment of each phase suggested in those two brief paragraphs may be found under appropri- ate headings within this summary of the year. In addition, the separate activities in Engineering, in Mining, in the various fields of industry — Agriculture, Aviation, Automobile, Steel, Textile — in Fi- nance and Banking, both at home and abroad, are each covered under the respective headings. Labor disputes during 1938 were fewer in number and of far less serious nature than in the previous year. The reduction was due in part to ameliorated conditions of labor, in part to the passage of the Wages and Hours Act, and in part to a definite swing in public opinion against methods, such as the \"sit- down\" strikes, employed by labor in recent disputes. As MR. Louis M. HACKER points out in his review of Labor and kindred topics, the newspaper headlines gave more attention to disputes within the ranks of labor in 1938 than to disputes between labor and employer. The world at large, however, was in unrest almost from the beginning of the year. Great Britain, with its large interests extending over the entire globe, was kept continually agitated in the effort to maintain undisturbed trade relations and to keep the numerous foreign fires from spreading into a general conflagration. To that end she made concession upon concession, but whether in so doing she sacrificed her prestige was still a moot point at the end of the year, though her diplomatic efforts ap- peared then likely to be successful. The events which caused the major disturbances are thus sum- marized by MR. RONALD S. KAIN, Associate Editor in charge : \"Outstanding developments of the year in Europe were Germany's annexation of Austria in March ; the Munich accord of September 30; the subsequent partition of large areas of Czecho- Slovakia among Germany, Poland, and Hungary, with the remnants of the republic becoming a satellite of the Reich ; the consequent establishment of unquestioned German economic and military predominance in central and eastern Europe; the strengthening of the Rome-Berlin axis; the steady progress of Franco's Insurgent armies, with Italp-German support, in the Spanish civil war; the tightening of the Anglo-French alliance ; Prime Minister Chamberlain's effort to appease the dictators by giving Hitler a free hand in eastern and central Europe, withholding aid from the Spanish Loyalists, and rec- ognizing Italy's sovereignty over Ethiopia ; the Anglo-Italian accord ; the tension created between v PREFACE Italy and France by the Italian agitation, launched November 30, for greater territorial and other concessions. Also the triumph of the radical wing of the Nazi party in Germany, followed by vio- lent attacks upon the Jews and acceleration of the collectivist reorganization of the Reich for mili- tary and social purposes; the replacement of the Popular Front's rule in France by Daladier's middle-of-the-road government; the resignation of Anthony Eden as British Foreign Secretary in protest against the Chamberlain appeasement policy; and the Anglo-Irish settlement. \"In China the Japanese invaders made marked progress without administering a knockout blow to Gen. Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist regime. Nippon's expansion on the Asiatic mainland was de- flected southward by the determined opposition encountered from Soviet troops in the August clashes at Changkufeng and by the Anglo-French capitulation to Hitler at Munich. In October, Japan defied Britain by capturing Canton and isolating Hong Kong. France's possessions in Indo-China were en- dangered. The Arab revolt in Palestine offered another threat to the British Empire's security. \"In the New World, 1938 witnessed the strengthening of inter-American solidarity at the Lima Conference ; the Mexican oil expropriations ; abortive Nazi-Fascist revolts in Brazil and Chile ; the victory of the Popular Front in the Chilean presidential election ; the final settlement of the Chaco Dispute ; and the conclusion of the Anglo-American and Canadian-American trade pacts. In all coun- tries the growing world chaos caused increased armament expenditures. The world spent some 16 bil- lion dollars on arms and munitions during 1938.\" We welcome among the new contributors to the YEAR BOOK, MR. DOUGLAS HASKELL, contributing editor of The Architectural Review, who has supplied the article on ARCHITECTURE; MR. G. Ross HENNINGER, editor, American Institute of Electrical Engineers, who has presented the articles on electrical engineering; MR. CHARLES S. HUGHES, formerly of the U.S. Shipping Board, who has prepared the various articles on mineral production ; MR. II. CHARLES RAWLINS, editor of Sport, who has covered all branches of athletic competitions, and MR. WALTER H. BEAL of the U.S. De- partment of Agriculture, who has developed the articles FERTILIZERS and SOILS. As in the past, the co-operation of the officers of the various Departments of the United States Government and of their allied Bureaus, and of the officers of other Governments who have supplied valued information concerning their respective countries, is gratefully acknowledged. Appreciative thanks are also tendered to the officers of numerous Corporations, Companies, Associations, and Insti- tutions who have contributed material that guarantees the accuracy of their respective interests. And finally, once again we pay a warm tribute of appreciation to the members of the editorial staff who have worked loyally, harmoniously, and efficiently under trying conditions toward the completion of this work. The surviving Editor cannot express too warmly his personal thanks to each and espe- cially to his two Associates, MR. RONALD S. KAIN and Miss HELEN READY BIRD, through whose ex- perience and industry it has been again possible for this YEAR BOOK to take a proud place among its predecessors in the homes, the colleges, the libraries, and the newspaper offices of the country.

An American pharmacol- ogist, died in Baltimore, Md., May 26, 1938. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, May 19, 1857, he attended the University of Michigan from 1876 to 1879 when he became principal of the high school at La Porte, Ind., and superintendent of the public schools there in 1880. He returned to the University in 1882 and took his degree of Ph.B. in the following year. Upon graduation he did graduate work at Johns Hopkins University, and in 1884 went abroad, where he studied at the universities of Leipzig, Strassburg (M.D., 1888), Heidelberg, Vienna, Berne, Wurzburg, and Berlin. Returning to the United States in 1891, he was appointed lecturer and professor of materia medica and therapeutics at the University of Michigan. He remained there until 1893 when he was invited to become the first professor of pharmacology at Johns Hopkins. In 1932 he was retired as professor emeritus and then became the director of the Laboratory of Endo- crine Research, where he worked until shortly be- fore his death. One of the earliest workers on hormones, in 1895 he began his researches that resulted in the isolation of the hormone which later enabled other scientists to obtain the pure crystalline hormone. Subsequently, he successfully isolated the external secretion of a tropical toad to obtain epinephrine. In 1926 he succeeded in isolating the hormone of insulin. These achievements classed him as of the first rank in science, and in 1927 he was awarded the Willard Gibbs Medal of the American Chemi- cal Society in recognition of the scientific achieve- ments by which he became accepted as the \"chief of the forces of science in creating human happi- ness.\" Considered the foremost authority on the chem- istry of the ductless glands and known as the \"Father of American Pharmacology,\" Dr. Abel was associate editor of the Journal of Experimen- tal Medicine from 1896 to 1905, when, with Dr. C. A. Herter, he founded the Journal of Biological Chemistry. He edited this until 1909 when he founded the Journal of Pharmacology and Experi- mental Therapeutics. In 1932 he retired as emeri- tus. He organized and founded the American So- ciety of Biological Chemists in 1906 (president, 1908) and the American Society of Pharmacolo- gy and Experimental Therapeutics (president, 1908), and in 1932 was elected president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. A day or two before he died he was elect- ed to membership in the Royal Society, London. His lectures—Mellon, Harvey, Kober, and Wil- lard Gibbs— all dealt with internal secretions, and 1 his writings with the subjects of his various re- searches. He was awarded the Research Corpora- tion Prize (1925), the gold medal of the Society of Apothecaries, London (1928), the Philip A. Con- ne medal of the New York Chemists' Club (1932), and the Kober medal (1934). ABKHAZIAN AUTONOMOUS SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLIC. See GEORGIAN SO- VIET SOCIALIST REPUBLIC. ABYSSINIA (ETHIOPIA).

A membership organization founded in 1926 for the purpose of furthering the idea of education as a continuing process throughout life. During the last decade the Association has served as a clearing house of information concerning adult education activities ; has assisted enterprises al- ready in operation; has helped organizations and groups to initiate activities ; and has conducted or sponsored studies and demonstrations. Over 70 books and pamphlets on methods and practice in adult education have been published by the As- sociation or issued under its sponsorship. The An- nual Report of the Director of the Association is published in May of each year; the Journal of Adult Education (the official organ of the Asso- ciation) is issued in October, January, April, and June. Support for the activities of the Association has been derived from membership fees and from grants made by the Carnegie Corporation of New York. During 1936-37 a change was made in the pro- gram of the Association. Emphasis formerly placed upon experimentation and demonstration was shift- ed to a study program. The Association is con- ducting over a five-year period a study of the social significance of adult education in the United States in order to discover the meaning and esti- mate the worth of adult education as a social move- ment among the other social movements. Studies published in 1938 were : The Music of the People, by Willem van de Wall ; Women in Two Worlds, by Mary L. Ely and Eve Chapell; Man-Made Culture, by Frank Ernest Hill; The Public Library — A People's University, by Alvin Johnson ; Outposts of the Public School, by Wat- son Dickerman; Parents in Perplexity, by Jean Carter; Everyman's Drama, by Jean Carter and Jess Ogden; Rural America Reads, by Marion Humble. The 1938 annual meeting was held in May at Asbury Park, N. J. The following officers were elected : John H. Finley, president ; James E. Rus- sell, honorary chairman ; Alvin Johnson, chair- man ; Linda A. Eastman, Hans Kohn, Alexander Meiklejohn, Agnes Seasongpod, John W. Stude- baker, vice-presidents ; Jennie M. Flexner, secre- tary, and Harold Stonier, treasurer. Headquarters : 60 East 42d St., New York City. Director, Morse A. Cartwright. See LIBRARY PROGRESS. ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE, AMERI- CAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE. An organization found- ed in 1848 to advance science to give a stronger and more general impulse and systematic direction to scientific research, and to procure for the labors of scientific men increased facilities and wider useful- ness. On Sept. 30, 1938, its membership included 19,347 co-operating individuals. As a general asso- ciation of the numerous American societies for the advancement of the special sciences, it consisted of 167 autonomous and independent associated scien- tific societies, 32 being local academies of science. The Association holds two meetings during the year, one in the summer and the regular annual meeting in December. The last summer meeting was held in Ottawa, June 27 to July 2, 1938, with an attendance of about 1800. The next meeting, the 103d, was held in Rich- mond, Va., Dec. 27 to 31, 1938. Although the reg- istered attendance was about 2500, it is estimated that approximately 5000 were in attendance at the various sessions. About 40 affiliated and associated organizations met with the Association together with its 15 sections in connection with the Rich- mond meeting. Of the 1700 papers presented at the various sessions of the sections and societies, the prize of $1000 for describing a noteworthy contribu- tion to science was awarded to Dr. Norman R. F. Maier of the University of Michigan for a paper on \"Experimentally Produced Neurotic Behavior in the Rat.\" At this meeting Dr. Charles F. Code, of the Mayo Foundation of the University of Min- nesota, read his paper on \"The Blood Histamine in Normal and Certain Abnormal Conditions\" for which he received the Theobald Smith Award in medical sciences consisting of a bronze medal and a prize of $1000. The official organ of the Association is the week- ly journal, Science. In addition it issues The Sci^ entific Monthly, an illustrated magazine of timely articles of general interest by eminent men of sci- ence. The permanent endowment of the Associa- tion, the income from which is employed to advance scientific research, amounted on Sept. 30, 1938, to about $242,550. The president of the Association for 1938 was Dr. Wesley C. Mitchell, Columbia University. The president-elect for 1939 is Dr. Walter B. Cannon, professor of physiology, Harvard University. The ADVENTISTS AERONAUTICS other officers for 1939 were: General secretary, Otis W. Caldwell; treasurer, John L. Wirt; per- manent secretary, F. R. Moulton. Headquarters are in the Smithsonian Institution Building, Wash- ington, D. C ADVENTISTS. In America the Advent Movement owed its origin to William Miller (1782-1849), who from 1831 taught not only that Christ was coming in person, power, and glory, but that such an advent was at hand and that the date might he fixed with some definiteness. For the early history of the Movement see THE NEW IN- TERNATIONAL ENCYCLOPEDIA, vol. i, pp. 158 ft. Advent Christian Church. This Church holds simply to the general imminence of Christ's return but takes the position that the day cannot be de- termined. Headquarters of the general conference are at 160 Warren Street, Boston, Mass. Seventh-Day Adventists. This denomination, which is the largest of the Adventist group, em- braces 10 union conferences in the United States and Canada. It believes that the seventh day of the week, from sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday, is the Sabbath established by God's law and that immersion is the only proper form of baptism. On the basis of Biblical prophecy, including the proph- ecy of Christ himself, it teaches the imminence of Christ's second coming, and the end of this world. The statistical report of the denomination for 1937 indicated 2508 churches in the North Amer- ican division, 1033 ordained ministers, and 164,490 church members ; Sabbath schools, which num- bered 2978, had a membership of 151,003. Total contributions from all sources in 1937 amounted to $8,350,325.41 for the North American Division, and $4,262,854.21 for the other divisions. The foreign divisions, including the Australasian, Central European, Chinese, Far Eastern, Inter- American, Northern European, Southern African, South American, Southern Asian, Southern Euro- pean, and Union of Soviet Socialist Republic divi- sions, consisted of 5880 churches, 1452 ordained ministers, 288,268 church members, and 10,342 Sabbath schools, with an enrollment of 402,386. Throughout the world there was an increase in membership of 14,619 over 1936. The work was conducted in 385 countries and islands by 69 union conferences, 145 local conferences, and 333 mission field organizations, employing 28,029 evangelistic and institutional laborers, who are using in their work 714 languages and dialects. The denomination maintains in the United States and Canada 129 educational institutions, which in 1937-38 had an enrollment of 19,271 students. There also are maintained in foreign countries 1 14 educa- tional institutions with an enrollment of 12,799 stu- dents. The denomination has 19 publishing houses in North America and 56 in other countries. The principal periodicals are the Advent Review and Sabbath Herald, Signs of the Times, The Watch- man Magazine, The Canadian Watchman, Life and Health, Health, Liberty. In all there are 310 periodicals published by the denomination, in 55 languages. Literature in all forms is issued in 194 languages, sales of which, in 1937, aggregated $4,066,181.07. The headquarters of the General Conference are at Takoma Park, Washington, D. C. ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON EDU- CATION. See EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. -ffiGEAN ISLANDS, ITALIAN. The islands of Rhodes (Rodi), Castelrosso (Castellrizo), and the Dodecanese group between the island of Crete and Turkey in Asia. Total area, 977 square miles ; total population (June 30, 1936), 140,948, compared with 134,384 (1933), of whom about 90 per cent were Greeks. Rhodes, the capital, had 27,466 inhabitants. Grapes, tobacco, oranges, olives, and vegetables are the main agricultural products. The manufacture of oriental carpets, wine, olive oil, pottery, and tiles are important industries. Production in metric tons was: Barley, 2400 (1934); olive oil, 1100 (1937-38 estimate) ; tobacco, 100 (1934). In 1935, 660,427 gallons of wine were produced. In 1936, imports were valued at 111,030,000 lire; exports, 13,193,000 lire (lira averaged $0.0729 for 1936). There is a weekly air-mail service from Brindisi and Athens to Rhodes. In 1937 there were 391 miles of roads. For the financial year 1934-35 the budget was 48,000,000 lire; State contribution, 3,000,000 lire (lira averaged $0.0825 for 1935).

In a year when the shifting tides of national and international politics were to leave their mark on almost every field of endeavor, air transport progress was more affected than ever before by its intimate association with governmental agencies. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the North Atlantic where the air lines of five nations continued preliminaries to the establishment of regular scheduled transport. The long-projected plans for an airship service between Germany and the United States, for ex- ample, failed of realization solely because of the ina vail ability of American helium. Otherwise the Zeppelin Company was completely ready for serv- ice. The LZ-130, initially intended to be an almost exact sister ship of the ill-fated Hindenburg, was substantially redesigned and rebuilt at Friedrichs- hafen to permit the use of helium rather than the slightly more efficient hydrogen. A request for 19,- 800,000 cu. ft. of helium was entered with the U.S. government in accordance with the terms of the helium export law which Congress had amended after the Hindenburg crash to permit sale for any \"non-military\" use. Germany's new airship termi- nal at Frankfort was ready for service. A prelimi- nary schedule for a summer's demonstration flight was announced. Then Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes refused to approve the export, doubt- ing that Germany wanted helium solely for non- military use. On September 14 the LZ-130 was christened Graf Zeppelin and, inflated with hydro- gen, started through a series of flight tests. The request for helium was from time to time renewed in Washington. Permission was even sought to fly the ship with its hydrogen charge to the United States. But at the year's end the anti-Nazi senti- ment in the United States had so increased that helium export seemed more remote than ever. That same sentiment was at least a contributing element to the situation which minimized the effec- tiveness of the elaborate program of transatlantic airplane flights carried out by Germany during the summer. Deutsche Lufthansa, Germany's official air trust, announced in May that it would once more demonstrate the catapulted mail-plane tech- nique as it had done in 1936 and 1937 — this time with a program of 28 crossings. It also expressed itself as being ready to begin immediately on a scheduled transatlantic mail service. July 21 the mother ship Schwab cnland anchored off the Azores and fired the Diesel -powered seaplane Nord- meer down its catapult. Some 17 hours, 42 minutes later it swung in over the mother ship Friesenland AERONAUTICS AERONAUTICS anchored in Long Island Sound, The following Monday the Nordmeer began its return flight to Horta. Meanwhile, the Nordwind, a sister ship, had come in from the Azores. From then until the middle of October one ship arrived after a west- ward crossing every Monday morning and another took off eastward every Monday evening. Not con- tent with that the Germans sent Capt. Alfred Henke on a non-stop flight from Berlin to Floyd Bennett Field, L. I., on August 11, in a big four- engined Focke-Wulf Condor land transport chris- tened the Brandenburg. Finishing the 3985-mile journey with three companions in just under 25 hours, Captain Henke took off August 13 on a re- turn crossing. This time with favoring winds he reached Tempelhof, Berlin's huge airport, in 19 hours, 54 minutes. Meanwhile, on the catapult pro- gram Capt. Joachim Blankenburg made headlines on August 1 by completing his 100th airplane cross- ing of the North or South Atlantic. On September 12 a third seaplane of a somewhat newer model, the Nordstern, flew into New York in the record time of 13 hours, 35 minutes. Great Britain's transatlantic program of 1938 was characteristically severely curtailed by the Air Ministry's preoccupation with its armament pro- gram. After announcing no less than six projected flights in three different types of aircraft, the Brit- ish actually terminated their efforts after a single round-trip crossing. That one, however, was tech- nologically of great interest. On July 20 the unique pick-a-back combination of the flying boat Maia and the seaplane Mercury took off together from the harbor at Foynes, Ireland. After reaching an altitude of 3000 feet the two ships uncoupled and the Maia returned to its base. Twenty hours, 19 minutes later the Mercury splashed to a landing at Montreal, delivering a half-ton load of mail, news- papers, and news-reels. The same day it came to Port Washington, L. I. July 27 it was once more back at Southampton after a homeward flight which included four stops made necessary by the ship's limited capacity when launched without the assistance of the Maia. Capt. D. C. T. Bennett, ac- companied only by a radio man, piloted throughout the trip. The French, likewise distracted by concern over the condition of their air aim, also fell far short of an announced program of six round-trip crossings. After extensive rebuilding the Lieutenant de Va\\s- seau Paris — huge six-engined Latecoere flying boat originally launched in 1934 — took off August 18 from Biscarosse, near Bordeaux, but soon turned back due to propeller trouble. August 23 it took off once more, landed at Lisbon, then pushed on to the Azores. After several days' delay due to weather, it took off August 30 and completed a 22- hour, 48-minute crossing to Port Washington, L. I. On September 6 it started homeward, reaching Biscarosse after a flight \"without incident\" on Sep- tember 9. Further crossings were indefinitely post- poned by the crisis in European affairs which lead to the pact of Munich. Save for the continued regular crossings between the United States and Bermuda by flying boats of Pan American Airways and Imperial Airways this completed air-line efforts in the North Atlantic. While such flights continued to command fair pub- lic interest they cannot be said to have markedly advanced the actual establishment of scheduled service. Actually, what real progress was made toward that goal took place elsewhere. In Seattle, Wash., the first of 41-ton flying boats which the Poeinj; Airplane Cp. is twitying for the American Airways made its first test flight on June 8, and late in November was announced as due for delivery to the air line on December 25. The second ship of the six was at that time under- going final assembly and the remaining four were well advanced. In the same factory the year's end also saw the first of three big Boeing landplanes destined for Pan American Airways reach com- pletion. The initial trial flight was made on De- cember 31. Equipped with superchargers not only for each of the four engines, but for the cabin as well, these planes were designed for long flights at altitudes up to 25,000 feet. Both of these new Boeing types, flying boat and seaplane, were expected to play an active part in the North Atlantic during 1939. In fact, delivery of two or three of the flying boats was expected to mean the immediate opening of scheduled operation for the transport of mail, passengers, and express between the United States, and at least, England. In England the De Havilland aircraft works completed some five big fpur-engined landplanes of the Albatross type, which are also scheduled for experimental crossings to Canada. The first of the ships to be tested suffered an accident during load-carrying tests when its unique plywood con- struction failed, with the spectacular result that the entire rear end of the fuselage broke off after a landing. But the weak spot was detected and strengthened on the remaining planes. Also being made ready for 1939 Atlantic work was a Short Brothers Empire boat redesigned to permit an in- creased gross-loading from 42,000 to 48,000 Ib. At the year's end came word that the Short Brothers had also started work on three huge landplanes of 71,000 Ib. gross and three flying boats of 74,000 Ib. gross. In France the Latecoere Co. completed designs for a flying boat of 146,000 Ib. gross loading, and the Potez Co. was far enough advanced on the de- velopment of its six-engined flying boat that it built a one-third scale model — itself large enough to be flown as an ordinary airplane. Thus the lack of airplanes of large enough di- mensions to carry transatlantic loads of mail, pas- sengers, and express was being actively fought on at least three fronts. During October it was learned that the American Export (Steamship) Co. had not only completed plans for survey flights in 1939, looking toward air-line operations to the Mediterranean area to supplement its steamship service ; it had also worked out an agreement with Pan American Airways, setting up spheres of At- lantic exploitation for both companies. By its terms it is understood that Pan American will have spe- cial rights to operate to England and Scandinavia ; American Export Airlines will have similar privi- leges in the Mediterranean. To the countries be- tween those areas both companies are to share equally. American Export was also able to com- plete a working arrangement with Italy's air trust, Ala Littoria, similar to that existing for some time between Pan American Airways and Imperial Airways. The North Atlantic was, of course, only one small part of the international air-transport picture. Across the South Atlantic, Germany and France continued to operate weekly mail flights and both prepared to institute supplementary passenger service in the near future. Significantly both Great Britain and Italy sent missions to Latin America during the year to work out details for setting up transport services across the South Atlantic some- time in 19^9, Jn fa Pacific, P*n American Air- nnl'CLAS D( 4 TRANSPORT Tins tfiant 40-passen^er transport rnadr its first lest flight in Innc and v\\as to be delivered to the I'nited Air Lines in January. 1Y.W Cl\\dc H.

On January 12 the Sikorsky flying boat Samoan Clipper took off from Pago Pago, American Samoa, on the last leg of a flight to New Zealand which would have inaugurated a regular air express service between Auckland and Honolu- lu. A few miles to the south-westward the ship suddenly burst into flames and crashed into the sea. Instantly killed with his seven fellow crew- members was Capt. Edwin C. Musick (q.v.), Pan American Airways' oldest pilot and trail-blazer for the long 8000-mile route between California and Hong Kong. On July 29 the Hawaii Clipper left Guam bound for Manila. At 12: 11 a.m. (N. Y. time) a radio message consisting of a routine re- port of its 565 miles from Manila position was re- ceived at Guam ; a few minutes later the Guam op- erator was unable to renew contact. No further certain trace was ever afterward found of the plane, Captain Terletsky, his crew of eight, and six pas- sengers. On the world's international overland air routes there were few important 'route extensions. Ger- many continued survey flights for a service to China and Japan via Afghanistan. Great Britain made final preparations for a flying-boat service between Australia and New Zealand. Germans and Americans operating in Latin America slightly in- creased their networks. Pan American Airways started a program of survey flights between Seattle and Juncau, Alaska, using a Sikorsky amphibian, flying an all- water route. All over the world the generalization was true that all the major international air lines carried more traffic in faster and more comfortable planes than they had the previous year. Imperial Airways completed a program, begun the year before, of re- placing its landplane equipment with luxurious four-engined flying boats of the Short Empire class. As a result, flying time was materially re- duced all over the system and routes could be re- located to eliminate several crossings of non- British territory. London to Alexandria became a two-day, all-air journey; Alexandria to South Africa was reduced to four days, the route being shifted to the east coast and the African terminal being shifted from Capetown to Durban; from Alexandria to Calcutta new schedules were set at three days which brought the total London to Cal- cutta time down to five days, with a further three days' flight all that was required to put mail and passengers into Australia. By October, Imperial had also put into service the first of her Armstrong- Whitworth four-engined Ensign landplanes on the London-Paris run, and had begun service tests on its first De Havilland Albatross ; both these ships had been considerably delayed by the press of mili- tary business in British factories, and were badly needed on Imperial's services to European capitals. The comparative obsolescence of Imperial's equip- ment prior to these deliveries had, in fact, aroused so much criticism in Parliament that in November, 1937, His Majesty's government appointed a board of inquiry headed by Lord Cadman which in April issued a complete report on Imperial, finding many things to criticize, but also in many ways defending the company's management. Probably the most significant British transport development of the year, however, was the exten- sion of the \"Empire Air Mail Plan\" to all Imperial routes ; by this plan all first-class letters weighing less than half an ounce dispatched from England to any portion of the empire reached by Imperial planes were carried by plane as a matter of course and without extra postage. Such a plan had been used by the air lines of several Scandinavian coun- tries since 1926 and had been used on Imperial and British Airways lines to the Continent since 1936. During 1938 England's number two company, British Airways, rose swiftly in prominence. Op- erating routes to Scandinavia, Germany, and Pans, it continued to purchase high-performance Lock- heed transports from the United States and stead- ily increased its patronage. In August it was this line which so dramatically carried Prime Minister Chamberlain to Germany for his three conferences with Hitler. The Cadman report had recommended that British Airways be definitely recognized as His Majesty's \"chosen instrument\" for develop- ment of British lines to the continent while Im- perial concentrated on lines to various parts of the British Empire. Also during the year British Air- ways was selected to make surveys for and project a route to South America for 1939. Thus matters stood until late November when Sir Arthur Kingsley Wood, appointed Secretary for Air in May, announced a plan to combine Im- perial and British Airways into a single corpora- tion, largely government-owned and directed. Shareholders in the two extant companies were to be reimbursed on a \"fair and reasonable\" basis, but at the year's end the ideal had not yet been com- pletely accepted and had been attacked as \"Tory Socialism.\" It seemed certain, however, to go through as a part of Britain's determination to maintain a leading position in world air transport. Air France continued to operate its long services to South America and to French Indo- China, cut- ting running time on the latter service to a six- day schedule to match Imperial Airways through the use of Dewoitine type 338 air liners. On its Eu- ropean services it also speeded schedules through the use of Bloch-type 220 transports, low-winged twin-engined monoplanes which cruise at 200 m.p.h. while carrying 16 passengers. As a result of this im- proved service, Air France took a marked leader- ship over the British in London-Paris traffic. The Royal Netherlands Airline continued to justify its reputation as \"the most thoroughly Americanized air line in Europe.\" Adding steadily to its fleet of Douglas transports, it, too, slashed flying time to its eastern terminal in the Dutch East Indies. Late in the year it added to this long route an extension to Port Darwin, Australia. It also made very substantial progress in its services in Dutch Guiana. At the year's end it was planning an almost complete relocation of its Asiatic serv- ices. Under the new set-up the Netherlands intend to cut straight across Europe from Germany to Basra, thence to Colombo, Ceylon, off the southern tip of India, thence to Batavia ; flying day and night they will cut their five-and-a-half -day trip to two and a half. Part and parcel of the plan is the use of four-engined landplanes presumably of the new Douglas DC-4 type, although corresponding Ger- man equipment was also being considered. Germany's Lufthansa improved its services through the widespread substitution of four-en- gined Junkers Ju 90s (40 passengers) and Focke- Wulf Condors (26 passengers) on their main lines in place of earlier Junkers models. A new Dornier Do 26 four-engined flying boat was flight tested and put into service on the South Atlantic run. The huge field at Tempelhof, undoubtedly the world's most magnificent air terminal, continued to be en- larged and improved under an extensive govern- mental works program. Domestic Transport. The air lines within the AERONAUTICS ASRONAUTICS United States once more flew more miles and handled more passenger and mail traffic than all the rest of the world combined. Continuing the efforts begun after a series of bad accidents during the winter of 1936-37 the lines drove on to new levels of safety. For the year 1938 the safety-index rose to 22,445,019 passenger-miles per passenger fatality compared with an over-all figure for 1937 of 11,915,079. The endeavors of the U.S. Department of Com- merce to improve its nation-wide system of radio beams were being continued aggressively by the new Civil Aeronautics Authority which took office August 22. The same new Authority included a semi-independent safety board charged not only with investigating all accidents but with suggesting new safety measures as well. Partly at its instiga- tion, the air lines met in Chicago in September and adopted an inter-line agreement whose sole purpose was to insure safer flying through winter months. Competitive schedules were relaxed to permit cruising at only 50 per cent of rated engine h.p., thus relieving strain on power plants and flying personnel. Competing air lines operating from the same airport agreed to dispatch planes under weather conditions approved by all the lines af- fected, thus eliminating psychological pressure upon dispatchers of individual lines to approve flights under hazardous conditions \"just to beat the opposition.\" The lines also agreed on the free exchange of technical information concerning op- erations, navigation, and engineering. Individually, each air line adopted many new safety precautions and several of them carried on extensive research activities which produced grati- fying results during the year. American Airlines extended its astounding safety record to three years and more than 400,000,000 passenger miles withou* a fatality. United Air Lines was instru- mental in developing a device (demonstrated pub- licly for the first time in October) which furnishes the pilot for the first time with a reading of his height not above sea level but above the actual terrain over which he is flying. A joint project of United Air Lines, Bell Telephone Laboratories, and Western Electric, the new \"terrain clearance indicator\" promises to become one of the most use- ful aids to safe air navigation developed since the radio beacon appeared during the late 1920's. Other noteworthy safety devices demonstrated during 1938 were an automatic radio compass developed by the Sperry Co., and the Radio Corporation of America ; a device to give the pilot warning of an approaching wing stall developed by the National Advisory Committee of Aeronautics ; a new meth- od of studying propeller vibrations developed by the Hamilton Standard Division of the United Air- craft Corporation. A bitter air-line rate-war threatened seriously in the early months of the year when several air lines adopted extreme measures for the stimulation of winter traffic. United Air Lines, and then almost every air line in the country, offered to carry the wife of any air-line traveler free in a drive to elimi- nate the \"family fear\" argument encountered so frequently by air-line salesmen. With more direct effect upon the general rate structure, Northwest Air Lines slashed its fares between Chicago and the Twin Cities and between Chicago and the northern Pacific coast States so severely that round-trip tariffs fell to less than two cents per passenger-mile. Western Air Express also made heavy reductions, especially in round-trip rates. United Air Lines cut its fares to the northwest to levels which competed with the Northwest Air Lines' tariffs. T.W.A. had previously announced a winter bargain reduction of 15 per cent For some weeks it looked as though the whole tariff struc- ture was headed toward a revolutionary overhaul. Then the normal seasonal increase of travel toward the end of spring seemed to head off the trouble. Most of the \"educational\" offers were repegged at levels somewhere between the extreme lows and the normals of 1937. Traffic as a whole gained as satisfactorily as might be expected in the face of a nation-wide busi- ness recession. Although the early summer months failed by a small margin to reach 1937 figures, the traffic totals for the first 10 months reached 397,- 000,000 passenger-miles compared with 355,000,000 for the corresponding period of 1937, an increase of about 12 per cent. Express pound-mileage ran slightly below 1937 levels, yet the actual number of shipments had increased and with it the income netted from such operations by the air lines. Air mail continued to set new records for each succeeding month. An approximate estimate for the first 10 months showed a total ton-mileage of 6,150,000 ton-miles compared with 5,500,000 ton- miles for the corresponding period of 1937. One feature of the mail-traffic year was a spectacular air-mail week observed during May. Led by Post- master-General Farley, every post office in the country displayed special posters, arranged news- paper articles, public speakers' programs, school essay contests, etc. — all in observance of the twen- tieth anniversary of the opening of the country's air-mail service. Another important air-mail mile-stone was passed during April when Congress enacted the Experimental Air Mail Act. By its terms the Post Office was able late in the summer to call for bids on a unique mail route between Baltimore and West Virginia in which the mail plane called at numer- ous small towns, picked up sacks of air mail, and dropped others — all without landing. In November the Post Office also asked for bids on a shuttle service between the Camden airport and the roof of Philadelphia's new post-office building to be carried out by autogiro, thus attacking the im- portant problem of expediting air-mail service in large cities whose airports lie in remote suburbs. Also on the post-office docket for approaching months were the establishment of some five very short air-mail routes, with stops at every possible town, in the Rocky Mountain region. But the most fundamental development in do- mestic American air transport derived from the passage by Congress of an act creating a new Civil Aeronautics Authority to control all phases of this country's non-military flying. By its terms, the regulatory functions heretofore carried out by the Bureau of Air Commerce within the Department of Commerce, the Post Office, and the Interstate Commerce Commission were transferred to a new independent body. It had some resemblance to quasi-judicial commissions previously existing in other fields, but with the difference that in addition to a commission of five men headed by a chairman, whose functions would be largely quasi-judicial, there was appointed an administrator whose duty it would be to carry out the regulations which the Authority would pass and to maintain and con- struct Federal aids to air navigation. Also separate from the Authority itself was the safety board of three members, mentioned above. To this new Authority was assigned not only that control over civil aviation which derives from AERONAUTICS AERONAUTICS the issuance of certificates to pilots, ground per- sonnel, and aircraft, but a complete control of air- line economics. Thenceforth, the establishment of an air line may only be carried out after the Author- ity has granted a certificate of public convenience and necessity (air lines already operating when the act was passed were to be automatically issued such certificates substantially equivalent to continu- ing franchises). Thereafter it lay within the Au- thority's power to determine (indirectly) what each line might charge for passengers and express and what payments should be made to each con- tractor by the Post Office for the transport of mail (although the Post Office retains control of the designation of which routes should carry mail and at what frequency). The new Authority was also given control over air-line issuance of financial obligations, the power to forbid the discontinuance of an air line, and the permission to veto any air-line merger or pooling agreement it considered against the public interest. Airports. The steady increase in airplane traf- fic and in the use of large high-performance equip- ment and the near prospect of blind landing opera- tions made the air-terminal problem a critical one in many large American cities. Fortunately, the WPA continued to expend large sums on airport projects. On December 3 a resume of such work showed that of 191 regular air-line ports-of-call in the United States, 169 had been improved through relief funds. However, the questions of mainte- nance and acquisition of additional land had become so burdensome to many cities that an increasing sentiment was making itself felt in Washington for Federal participation in such expenditures, along the lines of the Federal assistance to state highway departments. As a result the Act creating the new Civil Aeronautics Authority specifically directed that body to survey the problem and submit its recommendations to Congress by Feb. 1, 1939. Meanwhile, several long squabbles having to do with major air terminals were finally resolved dur- ing the year. The question of a site for Washing- ton's air terminal was settled in November when Army dredges began pumping earth fill into a site at Gravelly Point, 2 miles down the Potomac from the present Washington- Hoover airport but still within a 10-minute drive of the city's business district. A joint project of the WPA, the Army Engineers, and the Civil Aeronautics Authority, the new field is to be opened for traffic in 1940. In addition to a system of long runways, big hangars, and a pretentious administration building, the new field is to have buildings ample to house the big personnel of the Aeronautics Authority. New York City, which for more than a decade has resented the fact that its air travelers must use the Newark Municipal Airport, moved swiftly toward comple- tion of a big land and marine air terminal at North Beach, on the northern shore of Long Island, not far from the site of the World's Fair, scheduled to open in May, 1939. Involving the placement of a colossal amount of filling material and the con- struction of seven huge hangars and two adminis- tration buildings, North Beach when finished will have cost the city and the WPA something in the neighborhood of $25,000,000. But it will be located within 25 minutes of mid-town New York via the new Triborough Bridge and will definitely move the bulk of air-line operations from Newark. By December, the country's three largest domestic operators had signed leases for hangar occupancy and Pan American Airways was negotiating for facilities to be used as a transatlantic terminal. On the Pacific slope, San Francisco saw the completion of extensive improvements on its own Mills field and on the Oakland airport across the bay. Meanwhile, the grounds of its World's Fair, built up off Yerba Buena Island and reached by the San Francisco-Oakland Bridge, were carefully planned to serve ultimately as a combined land and marine terminal for the city. Pan American Airways had already moved its transpacific ter- minal to one of the Fair buildings, where Fair visitors will be able to watch maintenance opera- tion on the big clippers through glass partitions. Several of the other Fair buildings, instead of be- ing mere temporary structures, had been built as huge hangars which after the Fair closes can be directly converted to air-line use. Even Los An- geles, which has had a half-dozen rival candidates for designation as the city's air terminal, seemed settled at the year's end on a plan to concentrate its air-line operations at the Los Angeles Municipal Airport (Mines Field). Individual Exploits. Although the day seems now definitely passed when individual airmen can hope to influence profoundly the development of aviation, a number of individuals did stand out dur- ing 1938 through their aeronautical achievements. Perhaps most spectacular of all was the round- the-world flight carried out in July by Howard Hughes, the young movie producer and sportsman, who in previous years set still-extant American records for the transcontinental crossing and for landplane speed over a 3-kilometer course. On Sun- day evening, July 10, Hughes, accompanied by four companions, each a specialist in some field of practical aviation, lifted his heavily loaded Lock- heed 14 transport plane off Floyd Bennett Field, L. T. Flying day and night, stopping only for quick refueling at Paris, Moscow, Omsk, Yakutsk, Fairbanks, and Minneapolis, Hughes and his crew landed back at Floyd Bennett Thursday afternoon after an absence of only 91 hours, 8 minutes. The triumph, as Hughes himself was first to say, was one of careful preparation and organization over a period of almost three years. Nearly as spectacular, yet almost incredibly con- trasted in planning and execution, was the feat of Douglas Corrigan who, the week following Hughes' journey, slipped out of Floyd Bennett Field in a nine-year-old Curtiss Robin, equipped with large extra fuel tanks but lacking radio and all but the most rudimentary of flight instruments. Field attendants thought he was merely bound on a return flight to Los Angeles from which he had flown non-stop the preceding week. Regardless, he astounded the world by appearing in Ireland, July 18, with a very few gallons of fuel remaining in his tanks and the boldest excuse an airman ever offered for violating countless rules ^and regu- lations; he had somehow, he said, misread his compass and, being above the clouds, had had no inkling of the fact that he was not flying to Cali- fornia. The flight (and the story) so intrigued the public that the reception he received upon his re- turn to America was the most elaborate since that accorded Lindbergh in 1927. Officials meted out only the most nominal of punishments. A third outstanding American flight was that started from San Diego, June 2, by Richard Arch- bold, young scientist on the staff of the American Museum of Natural History. With a Consolidated flying boat similar to the standard patrol bomber of the American Navy, Archbold and his crew flew rum-stop to Honolulu. June 7 they crossed directly to Wake Island, omitting the call at Midway, AERONAUTICS 8 AERONAUTICS scheduled by Pan American transpacific clippers. On June 9 they pioneered a 2300-mile crossing to the North Coast of Dutch Guinea. A few weeks later Archbold put his ship in service on a long two-year program of exploration of the remote mountainous interior of that island, now one of the few remaining areas in the world which is still occupied by tribes with a pure Stone-Age culture. Another American flight, less individualistic in tone yet none the less of great significance, was a \"Good-will\" flight of six big \"flying fortress\" Boe- ing bombers of the U.S. Army Air Corps to Ar- gentine and return. At 12 : 55 a.m., February 17, Lieut. Col. Robert Olds led the squadron off the Miami, Fla., Municipal Airport. At 4 : 30 p.m. the same day they landed at Lima, Peru, 2695 miles away. After a six-hour stop for refueling, five of the squadron flew southward to Santiago, Chile, then swung eastward to land at Buenos Aires at 11 : 10 the following morning. The sixth plane, held at Lima by minor mechanical trouble, cut directly southeastward to arrive soon after the rest of the squadron. The return trip, with three stops, was carried out late in February without in- cident. Twenty-five officers and 24 enlisted men took part in the expedition. In Europe, the airmen of Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Russia were active in post- ing new records in the many categories recognized as official by the Federation Aeronautique Interna- tionale. Most of their record breaking was natu- rally done on aircraft produced under government contract for national air forces or for air lines closely associated with national governments. Con- sequently their feats are personal only in a minor degree. Three flights stood out : October 7 the pick-a-back combination of Mer- cury and Maia took off from Dundee, Scotland, and uncoupled. Two days later the Mercury, again with Capt. D. C. T. Bennett at the controls, land- ed on Alexander Bay, Orange River, South Africa, 6045 miles away. That set a new international rec- ord for seaplanes. On November 8 three single-engined Vickers \"Wellesley\" bombers took off from Ismailia, Egypt, swung southwestward across Arabia, In- dia, and the Dutch East Indies. One of the three paused briefly at Koepang, 6600 miles from the point of take-off. The other two landed at Port Darwin, Australia, their preannounced goal, 7162 miles from Ismailia. Thus all three broke the former mark of 6306 miles set during 1937 by the Russians on a transpolar flight to California. Squadron leader R. Kellett, RAF, was in com- mand of the squadron during the flight. In October Lieut. Col Mario Pezzi of the Italian Air Force climbed to an altitude above the Gui- donia airport near Rome of 56,000 ft., thus eclips- ing the record set in 1937 by the late Squadron Leader Adams of the RAF. Of technological in- terest was the fact that his single-engined Ca- proni biplane was equipped with a supercharged cockpit enclosure, the first ever used for such a record attempt. Women fliers seemed less active in record-break- ing attempts than formerly. Outstanding feminine achievement of the year was the winning of the Bendix transcontinental speed race, September 2, by Miss Jacqueline Cochran, flying a single-seater Seversky monoplane, similar to the newest pur- suits in service squadrons of the U.S. Army Air Corps. Flashing ahead of a field of nine other en- trants, she was forced to fly at altitudes between 16,000 and 22,000 feet to cross above a wide area of bad weather and reached Cleveland after an elapsed time of 8 hours, 10 minutes, 31 seconds, slightly over the record, but still excellent time. After a quick refueling she pushed on to Floyd Bennett Field, L. I., to set a new woman's trans- continental mark of 10 hours, 12 minutes, and 55 seconds. Private-Owner Airplanes. The manufacture of airplanes for non-transport non-military users remained at approximately the same numerical to- tal as that reached in 1937— about 1500, although the trend toward small planes (selling between $1250 and $2000) resulted in a substantial decrease in the total dollar value of this class of airplane production. Toward the year's end, proponents of non-scheduled flying for business and of flying for sport's sake were considerably heartened by the action of the Civil Aeronautics Authority in creat- ing a separate division charged with its general en- couragement and support. Even more encouraging was talk in Washington that the United States might finally agree to some plan of subsidizing pri- vate flight training as part of a new air-defense pro- gram. Throughout the year American pilots carried out numerous novel flights to demonstrate the utility of the modern 50-h.p. \"flivver\" plane. In May, during Air Mail Week, one Piper Cub was flown non-stop from Miami to New York and re- turn, refuel ings being effected at several points by hauling gasoline in cans from automobiles travel- ing along beneath the plane. During that same week, literally hundreds of planes of this and larger non-transport types were used in special feeder - line demonstrations to stimulate air-mail interest in some 1100 towns off the regular air-line network. In September another Piper Cub was kept aloft (with automobile refueling) for 103 hours over Syracuse, N. Y. In November a crew kept still another Cub in the air over Southern California for 218 hours, 23 minutes, pilots actually being changed during flight via a rope ladder. Far more significant than any of these refueling projects was the flight early in December of one Johnny Jones from Los Angeles Municipal Airport to Roosevelt Field, L. I., non-stop flight without refueling of 2785 miles. The plane used was an Aeronca powered with a 50-h.p. Continental en- gine and fitted with extra tanks to give a total fuel capacity of some 148 gallons. Jones, an ex-vaude- ville dancer turned airplane salesman, told report- ers he had made his flight \"to show you don't need a million dollars to fly, just a third down and easy payments.\" The total cost of his transcontinental trip was only $24.75. Military Aviation. As never before military air armaments played a part in the world's affairs. Active aerial warfare continued in Spain and Chi- na, featured by extensive use with ground troops and the continued bombing of open cities as well as of purely military objectives. Later in the year the Royal Air Force was also called into action in Palestine, where the British were encountering great difficulties with the Arabs. But it was the terrifying potentialities of air power in a war between the powers of Western Europe which really brought the question of air armaments to a new prominence. This is hardly the place for an analysis of the many complex fac- tors which led to and determined the character of the pact signed at Munich, but there is little doubt that the air squadrons built up during the past half-decade by the Axial Powers played a large AERONAUTICS AFGHANISTAN part among them. Estimates of the air strength of the nations involved were as different as they were numerous. But a consensus of the more conserva- tive analyses would fix the \"first-line\" strength of Germany and Italy combined at at least 6500 mod- ern planes of full effectiveness in major warfare. Against these England could have put about 3000 similar planes into the air, France another 1500, Czecho-Slovakia and Rumania a few hundreds at most. Russia remained an almost unknown factor, although it seemed certain that the majority of planes she does possess could not measure up to the quality of the better planes of the Western European Powers. In any case, Prime Minister Chamberlain's \"peace in our time\" was evidently coupled with no dream in his mind that Britain could afford to slow up her rearmament program. Far from it. At the end of the year Parliament had acceded to a budget for the RAF for the fiscal year of 1939 of no less than $1,000,000,000, compared to some $600,000,000 expended during 1938. France, while still bitterly struggling with its labor problem, was preparing to speed the immediate production of an additional 3000 \"first-line\" military planes by the end of next year. The largest press ever built, for fabrication of sheet-metal parts, was completed in an American factory and shipped to France for use in aircraft manufacture. The Axial Powers were continuing the smooth flow of quantity production. By November the scramble by each nation to provide itself with an air force \"equal to any pos- sible combination of air forces that might be brought against it\" had spread to the United States. Here Assistant Secretary of War Louis Johnson, speaking with apparent White House approval, talked of putting the American aeronautical in- dustry upon a mass-production basis immediately, and of building up die Army Air Corps from a current strength of about 1500 planes to some 9000, the Navy meanwhile presumably building up to its currently allotted 3000. Political observers were not in complete agreement as to whether the Con- gress, due to assemble Jan. 3, 1939, would under- write the huge expenses of such a program. But it did seem certain that America would in 1939 very much accelerate its military and naval air pro- gram. Airplane Design. Trends in landplane trans- port throughout the world were definitely toward the big four-engined carrier accommodating from 30 to 40 passengers. In Germany such planes built by Junkers and Focke-Wulf actually entered serv- ice on Lufthansa's European routes. In England Imperial Airways took delivery of the first models of fleets of huge Armstrong-Whitworth \"Ensigns\" and De Havilland Albatrosses. In the United States the giant 40-passenger Douglas DC-4 trans- port made its first test flight in June, was tested at gross weights up to 65,000 lb., and was due for delivery to United Air Lines for first service test in January. The first 32-passenger Boeing 307 was also nearing completion. Of equal interest with the question of air-trans- port size was that of the advisability of pushing long-range transport operations up into \"substrato- sphere\" levels between 20,000 and 25,000 feet. As has been mentioned earlier, Pan American Air- ways was to take delivery early in 1939 of three four-engined Boeing landplanes equipped with su- perchargers to keep cabin pressures and oxygen- content equivalent to those prevailing at 6000^3000- foot levels. An even more positive indication of progress in this direction was the publicity given to a year of high-level research finished in 1938 by the U.S. Army Air Corps upon a specially super-charged Lockheed transport. So successful was this work in producing solutions for the nu- merous mechanical problems involved that the Col- lier Trophy \"for the most important contribution to American aviation demonstrated during the pre- vious year\" was awarded to the U.S. Army Air Corps for the period of 1937. Perhaps the most progressive airplane design to appear during the year was that of the twin-engined pusher combat fighter delivered to the U.S. Army Air Corps by the Bell Aircraft Co. of Buffalo, N. Y. Armed with two rapid-fire cannon and several machine guns and capable of speeds to match the best pursuits, this new plane promised to revolutionize concepts of aerial defense against bomber attack. Also of considerable significance was the world-wide renewal of interest in rotary- wing aircraft of all types. Germany and Italy had successful helicopters flying throughout the year. Both America and England produced \"gyroplanes,\" modifications of the autogiro. Military authorities, led by the U.S. Army Air Corps, undertook tests of the autogiro as a substitute for captive bal- loons in artillery spotting. In the closing minutes of its 1938 session the U.S. Congress authorized, but did not appropriate for, a proposed $2,000,000 program of rotary-wing experimentation. AFGHANISTAN, af-gan'I-stan ; -stan'. A central Asian monarchy, bounded by the U.S.S.R., Iran, and India. Area (estimated), 245,000 square miles; population (latest estimate), 12,000,000. Chief towns: Kabul (capital), 80,000 inhabitants; Kandahar, 60,000 ; Herat, 30,000 ; Mazar-i-Sharif , 20,000. Persian and Pashto are the main languages spoken. Islam is the predominant religion. Free elementary and secondary schools exist throughout the country ; for higher education there are various technical, art, commercial, and medical schools, and Kabul University. Production and Trade. Cereals, fruits, and vegetables are grown in the irrigated plains and valleys. Castor-oil, madder, and asafetida plants are plentiful. The Afghanistan fat-tailed sheep fur- nish the main meat food, the grease from the tails being used as a butter substitute, while the wool and skins are used for wearing apparel. In 1936 it was estimated that 6800 metric tons of wool were pro- duced. Copper, lead, iron, crude oil, lapis lazuli, and gold are the chief mineral products. Kabul con- tains factories, owned and supervised by the state, for making buttons, matches, leather, and boots ; a factory for making arms, ammunition, and cloth- ing for the army ; and a mint. The chief imports are cotton goods, sugar, dyes, hardware, leather, and silver treasure ; exports con- sist mainly of lamb skins, timber, fruits, skins, and raw wool. Trade is mainly with the U.S.S.R., In- dia, and Iran. The chief routes to India are from Kabul through the Khyber Pass to Peshawar and from Kandahar to the railway terminal at Chaman in Baluchistan. Goods are transported mainly by camels and pack-horses but certain roads are used by automobiles during dry weather. In 1937 there were 1561 miles of roads. There are telephone sys- tems in the larger towns, telegraphic communica- tions linking Kabul and Kandahar with Peshawar and Chaman, and a wireless station able to com- municate with India and Eastern Europe. Government. The budget for 1937-38 was esti- mated to balance at 150,000,000 Afghan rupees. Afghanistan is a constitutional monarchy, with legislative power vested in a parliament comprising AFRICA 10 AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT the King, a senate of 40 members appointed by the King for life, and a national assembly of 120 elected members. King, Mohammed Zahir Shah (suc- ceeded, Nov. 8, 1933). History. A revolt against Mohammed Zahir Shah's regime was organised during 1938 among the warlike tribes of Waziristan on the Indian side of the Afghan-Indian frontier by a Syrian Mo- hammedan priest named Sayid Mohammed Sadi. The priest was related to the father-in-law of the deposed King Amanullah of Afghanistan, then in exile in Rome, and was believed to be acting on Amanullah's behalf. He preached a holy war against the reigning Afghan dynasty and on June 20 crossed the border into Afghanistan with some hundreds of armed followers. His force was several times dispersed by Afghan troops and airplanes, but reassembled and gave the Afghan military au- thorities much trouble before it was finally crushed in a battle in the Gomal valley near Jalalabad on June 24. The rebel forces at this battle totaled about 2000 tribesmen. The priest, known also as the Shami Pir, soon afterward surrendered to the British military authorities in the Northwest Fron- tier Province of India and was repatriated to Syria. Peace was soon restored in Afghanistan. A number of new military airplanes received from Italy and Great Britain early in the year aided the Afghan army in suppressing the revolt. To finance the further modernization of the army and other projects forming part of the government's westernization program, strict control of foreign exchange transactions was established in 1938 and the export of gold and silver in any form was pro- hibited. Pending the establishment of a State Bank, the Afghan National Bank was placed in control of exchange transactions. The government's hope of revenues from newly explored oil deposits were dashed in June when the Inland Exploration Co., owned by the Seaboard Oil Co. and other United States interests, surrendered the oil concession ob- tained early in 1937. The company reported that its explorations indicated \"excellent oil possibili- ties\" but that world conditions made their ex- ploitation inadvisable. A protocol extending for another 10 years the treaty of friendship and non-aggression signed by Turkey and Afghanistan in 1928 was ratified by the Turkish National Assembly on June 23, 1938. AFRICA.

Prominent developments in the Amer- ican experiment station system during 1938 in- cluded expanding activities, with increased funds and facilities, and extension and strengthening of co-operative relations of the stations with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and with other agencies interested in agricultural research. There was greater stabilization and adjustment of re- search projects and programs making for more efficient use of funds, facilities, and personnel in solving fundamental and long-time problems of wide common interest as well as special prob- lems of more immediate regional or local concern. The research programs of the experiment sta- tions included approximately 8500 research proj- ects embracing a wide range of agricultural and rural-life problems including land use; soil and water conservation; pasture improvement; crop adjustment; economical production, distribution, marketing, and use of plant and animal products ; improvement of the quality of such products ; protection against animal and plant diseases, in- sects, and other pests; tenancy, taxation, and other matters affecting the efficiency of farm busi- ness management and the betterment of the rural home and rural life. The stations continued to work closely with other agencies, with each other in regional groups, and with the Department of Agriculture individually and in regional and na- tional groups in efforts to plan and co-ordinate attacks on major problems. Financial support derived from all sources for the experiment stations aggregated $19,848,068 for the year ended June 30, 1938, compared to $17,- 694,250 in 1937 and $18,056,000 in 1931, the previous high. Of the total, the United States Government provided $6,232,500 which included, under the Hatch, Adams, and Purnell Acts, $90,- 000 for each State, $22,500 for Alaska, $50,000 for Hawaii, and $40,000 for Puerto Rico. The $1,800,- 000 provided under the Bankhead-Jones Act of 1935 was allotted on the basis of rural population. An increment of $300,000 was to bring the Bank- head-Jones fund total in 1938-39 to $2,100,000. The research projects included 505 supported with Adams funds, 695 with Bankhead-Jones funds, and 1660 with Purnell funds. Merger of the Federal and Territorial stations in Hawaii was completed during the year, the institution also receiving $2066 as final direct Federal appropriations, $81,620 from Territorial and other funds, and it conducted re- search under sugar processing tax fund allotments amounting to $79,906. The Puerto Rico College Station at Rio Piedras received $36,414 of Bank- head-Jones funds and $140,977 from the Insular government and other sources. The work in Puerto Rico was supplemented by the Federal station at Mayaguez, which increased its service as an out- post of the Department in the Tropics and also made important contributions to the improvement of agriculture in the island. Gifts and bequests of land and funds for agri- cultural research were made to several stations. The Maryland University and Station received from Charles E. McManus, farm properties about 18 miles north of Baltimore and valued at more than $1,000,000, a herd of Ayrshire cattle, other livestock, and over 100,000 chickens. The property or proceeds therefrom were to be used solely for the benefit of agriculture. A trust endowment of $500,000 for agricultural and chemurgic research was made to the Michigan station by the Horace H. Rackham and Mary A. Rackham Foundation of Detroit, the income to be used for developing new uses for farm products. Income from a gift o"
