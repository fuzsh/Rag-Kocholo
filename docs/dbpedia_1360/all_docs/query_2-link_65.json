        "text": "Fraudulent Third Party Websites\n\nThe Department of Health has received increased number of calls about third-party vendors selling birth, death, marriage and divorce certificates. These companies charge customers high fees to “process” or “help apply” for certificates issued from the Department of Health. If you have ordered through one of these third-party companies and would like to file a consumer complaint, please call the State of Nevada Attorney General Bureau of Consumer Protection at (702) 486-3132 or toll free at (888) 434-9989. For more information please visit their website at the Bureau of Consumer Protection.\n\nWho Can Order a Record?\n\nThe Office of Vital Records requires proof of relationship to ensure the State Registrar is satisfied that applicants for a birth or death record have a direct and tangible interest in the recorded matter pursuant to Nevada law.\n\nWho is eligible and what proof is required?\n\nAcceptable Identification List\n\nMarriage and Divorce Records\n\nPlease note that marriage and divorce records are held at the county level. For certified copies of marriage certificates, you must write to the County Recorder in the county where the license was purchased. For divorce records, you must write to the County Clerk in the county where the divorce was granted."
