The design takes inspiration from historic maps in the Archives which chart the development of Philadelphia’s streets and conversion of natural waterways to sewers.\n\nThe primary Archives document displayed is a redlining map of Philadelphia, created by a private company and shared with the City in 1944. Archives documents at the beginning of the piece tell viewers the story of housing discrimination through the 1960s. As the mural moves into the research room, viewers move back in time, with stories of resistance to housing discrimination making way for stories of resistance to slavery.\n\nTo learn more, download the free app.\n\nApple app store Google Play store\n\nPhotographs\n\nThe Department of Records has over two million photographs dating back to 1855.
