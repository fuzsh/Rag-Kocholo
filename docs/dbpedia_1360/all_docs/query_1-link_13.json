        "text": "Mateo Ferro is a first-generation Colombian-American actor, singer, and rapper born in Silver Spring.\n\nMateo visited MCM’s studios recently to discuss his career and his most recent song inspired by his family.\n\nThe Montgomery County native broke onto the scene at 16 when he booked an open-call audition in Washington DC to star in the Grammy winning Latin hip-hop musical In the Heights at The Kennedy Center. Following his breakout success, he packed his belongings and moved to New York City by himself at the age of 16.\n\nIn 2018, Ferro made his on-screen debut on the Netflix series Manifest. He found continued success on stage and screen.\n\nThe New York Times, The Hollywood Reporter, and Vulture, among others, have acclaimed his performances on Broadway, Off-Broadway, films, and television. In 2021, Ferro began releasing his music in English and Spanish, proving a success in both his career parallels."
