        "text": "Written by Noelle Simeon\n\nIn 2002 you could find my friends and me cruising around the San Fernando Valley, blasting music from bands like Korn, Disturbed, and Lacuna Coil. Lacuna Coil stood out from the rest, with full orchestras and Christina Scabbia‘s operatic voice carrying over the heavy guitars and double kicks. Comalies seemed to capture restlessness and depth more than any American band at the time. In short, we loved them for their uniqueness, and we weren’t the only ones. That album launched Lacuna Coil from Europe to the U.S., and we were ready. You just had to be there, man.\n\nTwenty years later, thru countless heartbreaks, celebrations, a Pandemic, and all life have to offer, Lacuna Coil is transporting us back to 2002 but making it modern. “This is not a reboot, a spin-off, or anything like that,” Christina explains. “We just wanted to give these songs a 2022 dress and see that this guy or girl born Twenty years ago would still look fucking slick in 2022.” And slick they are.\n\nComalies XX takes what we love about the original songs and metalizes it. Some of my favorite tracks, such as “Tight Rope,” “Angel’s Punishment,” and “Unspoken,” which only had Scabbia singing along with Andrea Ferro, sound better on their “XX” versions with Andrea’s screaming vocals. I’m not the biggest fan of screamo metal, but there is a weight it adds to the songs.\n\nHits “Swamped XX” and “Heaven’s a Lie XX” trade out the synthesizers for heavier guitars & bass rips and a new drum solo in “Heaven’s a Lie XX.” Though some might miss the synths, I like the new fuller and more layered sound.\n\nI will admit that “The Prophet Said XX” is not as ethereal as its original counterpart, but maybe that’s intentional. Perhaps the prophet will be less forgiving in 2022.\n\n“Aeon XX,” “Daylight Dancer XX,” “Humane XX,” and “The Ghost Woman and the Hunter XX” have grown in the last 20 years, and they are even better than when they were younger. They are angrier, but not without the intention and clarity that comes with age. There’s a sharper grit underneath that flows in these songs and is heard throughout the rest of the album.\n\nEven though the original will remain in my top 25, Comalies XX pumps up the album in the right ways. It’s the perfect nu-nostalgic metal album to scream along with.\n\nComalies XX dropped on Friday, October 14th. Get your copy now!"
