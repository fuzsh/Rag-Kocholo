        "text": "When it comes to Andrea Ferro, owner/master creative director of Ferro Hair Art. He always expects “Hair artistry at it’s best”. Born in Southern Italy, trained in Milan as well as across Europe and North America. Andrea is reaching 30 years in the industry and yet still feels his creative journey has just become.\n\nHis Philosophy to a perfect hair cut, “Anyone can cut hair but not everyone can sculpt hair” – “The hair should be sculpted to the head shape like a fine tailored suit”. Andrea is also a Master Colorist and believes the perfect cut can only be complimented by a perfect dimensional color.\n\nAs an educator for 20 years, he truly believes in continuous education for himself and his team. “Expanding knowledge is key to maintaining the highest level of technical and creative balance. That’s how we’ve succeeded in building an exceptional reputation within our community and beauty industry."
