Roberts is a surname of English and Welsh origin, deriving from the given name Robert, meaning "fame bright" – from the Germanic elements "hrod" meaning fame and "beraht" meaning bright. It is a patronymic surname which literally means "descendant of Robert". Thus, the surnames meaning can be interpreted as "son / daughter of Robert", depending on the sex of the person bearing it. The surname is common in North Wales and elsewhere in the United Kingdom. It may also be an Anglicization of the French surname Robert, commonly adopted by Quebec emigrants.
