Day to day, this means I am working primarily with Azure, but also with AWS. So each day I’m building infrastructure, automating deployments with tools such as Powershell and Terraform and generally all things Cloud.\n\nBefore that I spent several years with companies such as WEX Inc which is where I honed my Cloud skills working on some pretty massive AWS deployments. As well as that I enjoyed a lot of exposure to multiple companies infrastrcture, both cloud and on-prem with Engineer and Sys Admin roles at companies such as DXC and Unisys.\n\nOutside of my day job I’m a dad to two amazing girls and an even more amazing wife, living in Auckland, NZ after leaving the UK 12 years ago. I used to be a “semi-professional” racing driver, which means I was doing it seriously enough to to try and make it a career, but I wasn’t being paid for it haha! I won 3 British Karting titles before moving into cars, racing in the UK and the USA, and in general just being a motorsport fan. As well as that I’m now an avid runner, completing my first Half Marathon in 2020 and now trying to talk myself into entering an IronMan Triathlon!!!\n\nI hope you find the blog topics useful and any feedback is always appreciated!\n\nAndy"
