        "text": "PLAINSONG: Following Amelia\n\n2022 has been a remarkable year in the history of Plainsong. March saw the publication of Ian Claytonâs book, In Search Of Plainsong, which chronicles the formation of the band in late 1971, followed by its demise in December 1972. In July, Iain and Andyâs long time manager and producer, Sandy Roberton, who had helmed all of the Plainsong material in 1972, died unexpectedly after a short illness. Just a month ago, Cherry Red Records released a box set of most, if not all, of the recordings by the original band, with other supporting material. There is a 44-page booklet alongside 6 CDs of newly mastered material.\n\nShort tour announced: This tour is a short outing in celebration of all of the above. Iain and Andy will be collaborating on songs from the In Search Of Amelia Earhart record, mostly reworked in 2020, along with other material from their shared catalogue, and some solo performances taken from their individual careers. Should be fun. Dates are on the 'Upcoming Gigs' Page.>>> [November 2022]\n\nPLAINSONG: Following Amelia\n\nExciting news for Plainsong fans, this 6CD Box Set has now been released.\n\n118-track, 6CD box set from the legendary British country rock/folk rock band Plainsong.\n\nFeatures a 50th anniversary re-issue of their 1972 debut album ‘In Search Of Amelia Earhart’, digitally remastered from the original reel-to-reel master tapes. This Box Set contains over 50% previously unreleased material, including: several rare 1970s BBC recordings, the full original 1972 Folk Fairport concert in Amsterdam, and excerpts from the very first concert by the reformed Plainsong in Mayrhofen, Austria in 1993.\n\nLINK to Cherry Red pre-order page. [October 2022]\n\nSANDY ROBERTON:\n\nThis afternoon I heard that Sandy Roberton died in hospital in London, yesterday. He was my manager, my publisher, my producer, and above all, my friend over 54 years.Â\n\nHis is not necessarily a well known name outside of the music industry, but this linked biography, taken from his own businessâs website, shows the breadth of his influence, over nearly 60 years of relentless good work. I met Sandy in 1968, after he had made contact with us in Liverpool, asking if we wanted representation... s MORE OF ANDY'S TRIBUTE TO SANDY ROBERTON HERE.\n\n[28 July 2022]\n\nIan McKellen\n\nDuring the 60s/70s & 80s, Andy worked in theatre, notably the Liverpool Everyman and The Royal Court in London. In 1979 he wrote a song for Martin Sherman's play BENT the first openly gay play to appear in the West End. The play featured Ian McKellen. The play's setting of homosexuals and love in a Nazi death camp was shocking for many theatre-goers at the time and uncovered a previously little-examined area of Nazi brutality. We have added a page which contains photos of the production (courtesy of Ian McKellen's website - thanks Keith) and some of Andy's recollections from the time. McKellen is touring in 2019 in a celebration of his 80th Birthday. Read more about BENT HERE.\n\n[15th December 2018]\n\nSeasonal Gigs\n\nAndy is busy in the build up to the Christmas Festvities with The 40th Anniversary performance of Sir Henry at Rawlinson End at The Bloomsbury Theatre in London on the 7th December. He's also in downtown Brighton with Hank Wangford & Brad Breath on the 10th at The Greys pub in Southover Street. And finally he will be seeing out the old year with Mike Berry and the Outlaws at the George Payne pub also in Brighton on New Year's eve (31st). More details on the Upcoming Gigs page.\n\nCHECK OUT ALL THE GIGS HERE. [26th November 2018]\n\nLast Tuesday, I heard from Mike Evans that Bryan Dodson had died.\n\nWhen we formed Liverpool Scene in 1966, we named ourselves after the recent book, and for our earliest gigs we were a 5-piece outfit, with Adrian Henri, Roger McGough, Mike Evans, Mike Hart, and me. Then Roger backed out because the Scaffold had revived their fortunes, and stardom beckoned. We first added Percy Jones, who was a friend of mine at Liverpool University, on bass, and then in 1967 we found Bryan, and he became our permanent drummer. READ MORE HERE [11th March 2018]\n\n'I spent the summer with Monika and Monika spent the summer with me'.\n\nRoger McGough’s magical, iconic tale of love was published in 1967 and subsequently scored and released on record with music by composer and guitarist Andy Roberts. Now, for the 50th anniversary, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra’s new music group, Ensemble 10/10, will play Andy Robert’s original arrangements as McGough reads his epic poem, and will also feature more of his classic poetry set alongside other music.\n\nYou can see the dates on the Upcoming Gigs page HERE.

Andy is quoted as saying in the Press Release, “This has to be put out there as a Plainsong project.

[16 January 2013]\n\nGLEN SHERLEY\n\nWe documented Andy's affection for Glen Sherley's music on this website some years ago and have a page (link below) dedicated to the Glen Sherley story. Johnny Cash spotted Glen Sherley at Folsom Prison as a talented musician and songwriter and performed a song written by Sherley on the Folsom live album and subsequently fought to have him released. BBC Radio4 ran a programme recently highlighting Johnny Cash's work within the prison system in the States and in particular his work to try to get Sherley released. You can hear this programme on the BBC's iPlayer. HERE.

As well as Plainsong and several of Andy Roberts solo albums, Bob also played with The Sutherland Brothers (Lifeboat), Marc Ellington and on Allan Taylor's album The Lady.

See the Upcoming Gigs page for more information and the Music page for photos [ here ]. [29 August 2012]\n\nADRIAN HENRI website\n\nA long time in the making, we are pleased to announce a new website dedicated to the memory of Adrian Henri, Painter, Poet and frontman for the poetry & rock band The Liverpool Scene. John Peel called Adrian “one of the great non-singers of our time. ” The live performances of The Liverpool Scene were legendary and they were one of the hardest working bands playing the college circuit, and in 1969 supported Led Zeppelin on a UK tour. Find out more about Adrian at <www.adrianhenri.com>\n\nPLAINSONG\n\nThe dates for this year's Plainsong tour are firming up and we've added known venues to the Upcoming Gigs page [ here ]. The tour will take in several UK and European Festivals and visit venues across the UK between August and September. 2012 is the 40th anniversary of Andy Roberts and Iain Matthews forming Plainsong and the release of the legendary ‘Amelia Earhart’ album.Â\n\nPLAINSONG\n\n2012 will be the 40th anniversary of Andy Roberts and Iain Matthews forming Plainsong with Dave Richards and Bob Ronga and also the release of the legendary ‘Amelia Earhart’ album.Â\n\nTo celebrate, the band will be releasing a live studio album, ‘Fat Lady Singing’ (on the Blue Rose label) and touring Europe in August and September.Â The sad news is that this will be a farewell tour for Plainsong, as it has become harder to pin down the four current members in one place, let alone schedule dates for touring.Â Â For those fans who have loved Plainsong’s unique sound for forty years and those who have never seen Iain, Andy, Griff and Julian perform together, next year’s tour represents a final chance to say goodbye to what Melody Maker described as “quite simply and without hype: a supergroup”.\n\nSHINDIG music magazine\n\nAndy is featured in the latest edition of SHINDIG talking about his early solo career and \"groundbreaking fusion of jazz, rock, R&B, poetry and performance, The Liverpool Scene (who) were one of the truly unique bands to emerge from the incredible creative melting pot of the late '60s.\" Andy chats with Colin Hall and Jeff Penczak.\n\nANDY AND HIS BIG COUNTRY CLUB GRETSCH\n\nâIn the week that sees the start of the more regular outings for Hank Wangford and Brad Breath (weâve done a few one-offs over the summer, nothing more) I thought Iâd set down a few musings that might be of interest, and slightly relevant! Now bear with me...\n\nREAD MORE HERE\n\nTribute to the 96...\n\nYou will have seen that once again, we have added our tribute to the 96 Liverpool football fans who lost their lives at Hillsborough on 15th April 1989 and their families. This year marks the 21st anniversary of the disaster.\n\nThe poem 'The Bell' was written by Adrian Henri, a life-long Liverpool FC supporter, in the days that followed the tragedy, and the performance reading is accompanied by Andy on guitar. Adrian Henri's partner, Catherine Marcangeli, has given permission for the poem to be reproduced on the website."
