        "text": "Her contemporary classical album CONTINUUM, released in February 2022 on Signum Records, was written during the year of the coronavirus lockdowns (2020-2021) as a musical diary depicting the profound effect on our emotions, our lives, and nature around us. The title track features a narrative written and recorded for the album by the distinguished actor Adjoa Andoh, an extremely moving monologue evoking the emotional journey of that year. Conducted by Jessica Cottis at Abbey Road Studios and produced by Jonathan Allen, it features Grace Davidson, Clio Gould (Leader), Elena Urioste, Nicholas McCarthy, Justin Pearson, Anthony Pike and the Oculus Ensemble. The album reached No.1 in the iTunes Classical Album Top 40 Charts, No.3 in the Official Classical Top 20 and was Scala Radio’s Album of The Week. In 2021, she formed the Oculus Ensemble to record the album, a versatile chamber orchestra made up of musicians of exceptional talent that she has worked with over many years both in the studio and on the concert platform. The Oculus Ensemble will feature on her next album on Signum Records released in 2023.\n\nHer affinity for evocative, eclectic scores and versatility as an orchestrator enables bespoke soundscapes, ever-changing styles and genres created for the brief. She is equally at home writing for solitary, haunting solo instruments as the dramatic power of full orchestra. Her album Haunted By The Secret on Universal’s dark Chappell Noir label, had two nominations for Best Score Production Music Track in The Production Music Awards, winning with her track Game Of Trust.\n\nFor the Concert platform, her commissions have ranged from percussion quartet to full orchestra and choir, with performances at high-profile venues such as the Royal Albert Hall, St.Martin-in-the-Fields, St.David’s Hall Cardiff, Snape Maltings, Henley Festival, Newbury Spring Festival, Hong Kong Arts Festival, Carnegie Hall’s Weill Recital Hall, Spain’s International Music Festival Pórtico do Paraíso etc. The diverse range of musicians and instruments she has been fortunate to write for are a constant source of creative inspiration and include; Dame Evelyn Glennie, Barbara Thompson, Grace Davidson, Elena Urioste, Claire Moore, Clio Gould, Nicholas McCarthy, Rebeca Omordia, Her Ensemble, 4-Mality, The Locrian Ensemble of London, Justin Pearson, The Safri Duo, contemporary urban dance company Union Dance and many others."
