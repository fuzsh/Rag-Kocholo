        "text": "Very proud to have been a small part of our latest release, String Formations. Delivering Fracture Sounds' first proper String Library after we dipped our toes in with Trails. The feedback so far has been wonderful and we're pleased to offer this at a fair price point to composers during what is a difficult time for the wider industry. This library really sets a foundation stone for the innovations and products we have planed over the next 18 months, and I really can't wait to deliver them to you all!\n\nA small little non-work related achievement... I recently completed the Birmingham Great Run (Half Marathon) and raised nearly Â£1000 for the MSA Trust, a charity that has helped support my mother through her MSA diagnosis and helps spread awareness for this little known illness. Thank you to everyone who donated and supported! As I work remotely from home and sit at my desk all day, running has helped me immensely in keeping active and level headed. Now wondering whether to sign up for a Marathon next year! Donations are still live here if you wish to support: https://lnkd.in/eAPmvc6s\n\nHow time flies! Celebrating 1 Year since I joined Fracture Sounds today. We've achieved so much as a team this year, it's mind blowing! - Added over 10'000 customers to our community - Launched our free sample libraries brand, Blueprint - Created new connections and collaborations for exciting new projects in the future - Best Woodwind Library 2023 for Dan Keen Petrichor (Sample Library Review) We've got such an exciting year ahead of sound innovations for composers, and the biggest sample libraries the company has released yet.\n\nA year ago I thought I'd quite happily be a one company man, working my way up slowly through a business I was entirely happy with. But circumstances led to an opportunity to take a leap and join a much smaller project with more influence on how the company is run and what products are made by the amazing team of dedicated individuals we have, and I couldn't be happier. Here's to 2024 being even more special.\n\nBlack Friday is always a massive day and I've been planning it with the Fracture Sounds team since I started in February. Months of work in the studio and in the office by the development team culminated in the biggest sales day in the history of the company. Its a great way to see out the year (though we've got one more product to go!). Check out our deals and find out about our recent collaboration with my ol'sample pal Dan Keen here: https://lnkd.in/ePcjxSmc\n\nI've had the privilege of working on some of the best free sample libraries in LABS and Pianobook during my time at Spitfire Audio. When I joined Fracture Sounds in February, one of my focuses was building our community in order to increase our online presence and notoriety as a brand, driving a sustainable sales stream. So I'm really proud to combine all my experience so far and pile it into our new series, Blueprint! We're taking a slightly different approach to other companies with our range by having them closely tied to commercial releases. Giving new customers a flavour of the tools and programming quality exhibited in our main line of instruments... our Blueprint. A huge thanks goes to Native Instruments and Lea Edwards for working with us on this one to deliver it in the free Kontakt Player 7, meaning everyone can access the library for free! Looking forward to bringing more Blueprint releases in the future and delivering the exciting range of products we have in store for 2024 and beyond! https://lnkd.in/dimQhsd5\n\nWe're often searching for new ways to market our products and give customers more context and insight into our sample libraries. A difficult aspect of selling sample libraries is the lack of demoing for our customers. That's why they often want as much information as possible, from detailed descriptions on our product pages, to informative walkthroughs, and unbiased reviews from 3rd party industry experts. But how can we go further? How can we pull back the curtain to show customers exactly what we've done, and tell them why we've done it, in a way that's accessible to folks who haven't nessesarily made a sample library before? Well that's the challenge that Dan Keen and I set ourselves when planning this small documentary. So here it is... How did we do?"
