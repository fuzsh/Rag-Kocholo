        "text": "Music Inspired by Astronomy, Organized by Topic\n\nAn Annotated Listing by Andrew Fraknoi\n\n© copyright 2019 by Andrew Fraknoi. All rights reserved. Used with permission.\n\nConnections between astronomy and music have been proposed since the time of the ancient Greeks. This annotated listing of both classical and popular music inspired by astronomy restricts itself to music that has connections to real science -- not just an astronomical term or two in the title or lyrics. For example, we do not list Gustav Holst’s popular symphonic suite The Planets, because it draws its inspiration from the astrological, and not astronomical, characteristics of the worlds in the solar system. Similarly, songs like Soundgarden’s “Black Hole Sun” or the Beatles’ “Across the Universe” just don’t contain enough serious astronomy to make it into our guide. When possible, we give links to a CD and a YouTube recording or explanation for each piece. The music is arranged in categories by astronomical topic, from asteroids to Venus. Additions to this list are most welcome (as long as they follow the above guidelines); please send them to the author at: fraknoi {at} fhda {dot} edu\n\nAsteroids\n\nAstronomers\n\nClassical\n\nPopular Music\n\nAstronomy in General\n\nClassical\n\nPopular Music\n\nBlack Holes\n\nClassical\n\nPopular Music\n\nCalendar, Time, Seasons\n\nClassical\n\nPopular Music\n\nComets\n\nClassical\n\nAlso see Glenn McClure’s Rosetta under Space Travel.\n\nPopular Music\n\nConstellations\n\nClassical\n\nPopular Music\n\nCosmology\n\nClassical"
