Find out more about the other English qualifications that we accept.\n\nContextual admissions\n\nWhen you apply to Brighton we want to hear about who you are. Grades are never the whole picture; we're interested in things like creativity, resourcefulness, persistence and the capacity to think big and find new ways of doing things. And we recognise that not everyone has the same background. That's why we treat everyone who applies as an individual. We recognise many qualifications and we care about all of your achievements and the experiences you've had that set you apart.\n\nFind out more\n\nYear 1\n\nIn the first year you will study creative studio techniques together with the physical properties of sound which will inform other work on the course. You will be working on creative projects, aimed at opening up new possibilities through an engagement with new audio technologies to develop creative strategies as used in contemporary music and sound art practices. In addition to industry standard production software like Logic Pro, Protools and Ableton Live, we emphasise creative work with musical programming environments such as Pure Data and Max/MSP in order to enable the design of musical interfaces, installations, or systems based on individual creative projects.\n\nThe first year covers a wide field: from sound synthesis and acoustics, perception of sound and music analysis, to musical composition and instrument design. Various project assignments will encourage you to reflect upon your own practice and develop creative projects that you will present to your fellow students. You will also write an essay on a topic of your choice related to the course profile areas. Embedded in the course curriculum are tasks and methods that provide you with transferable skills, such as project development, management and presentation skills, and academic writing.\n\nModules\n\nPractice 1: Introduction to Sound\n\nThrough establishing a solid basis in the understanding of sound from a phenomenological and psychoacoustic perspective, this module will encourage you to increase the level of experimentation in your composition exercises. By exploring diverse soundscapes, listening to and analysing important musical works of the past 70 years, you will widen the scope of their own compositional approaches. New technical skills will be contextualised within diverse aesthetic and historic musical approaches. The aim is to conduct an extensive ear training and increase your compositional portfolio.\n\nPractice 2: Sound as Material – Perception and Experimentation\n\nThis module will introduce you to creative applications and techniques relating to work in sound studios, loop based music and sound installations. You will also be introduced to the nature of sound, synthesis, psychoacoustics, audio programming and compositional techniques. You will be encouraged to present work in the context of public performances and collaborations with external music organisations.\n\nPractice 3: Sound Organisation\n\nThis module will introduce you to a variety of creative approaches to the concept of sound organisation as it is applied in contemporary sound art practices. You will engage with techniques for gathering of materials, customization of technical skills, conceptualization, listening and composition, and methods for organizing sound in both virtual and physical spaces.\n\nPractice 4: Creative Audio Systems\n\nIn this module you will examine music and sound synthesis in the context of contemporary arts and performance by focusing on three key topics: iterative or generative music; new interfaces for musical expression (NIME) and interactive sound installations; and Network Music and Human-Computer Interaction. You will work in groups to research, develop and critique your projects.\n\nHCS 1: Programme Profile Introduction\n\nThis module will introduce you to the profile of the Digital Music and Sound Arts programme. Taught as interrelated lectures and seminars, you will develop your knowledge of the wide and complex field of artistic sound practice and gain an understanding of its practical, conceptual, cultural and aesthetic implications. You will explore the experimental music and sound works in the cultural context in which they emerged in the 20th / 21st Century. You will practice presentation skills through presenting you own work.\n\nHCS 2: Experimental Sound and Music in Contemporary Culture\n\nThis module will continue exploring the experimental music and sound works of the 20th and the 21st centuries, the aesthetic concepts that underpinned them, and the cultural context in which they emerged. This is introduced through individual key topics. You will also be introduced to research methodologies and academic writing. You will select a topic of your own choice and will be guided through the research methodologies and writing practices required for producing an academic text.\n\nYear 2\n\nIn the second year you develop skills and knowledge in three key areas:\n\ncomposition and sound design for the moving image\n\nsound art\n\nnew media.\n\nTheoretical modules support practical work where you will do sound design for films or other screen-based forms and sound art in its various manifestations. Students typically work on composition and sound design for the moving image and new media (film, TV, video, internet, games), radio, multi-channel sound, audio programming, digital instrument design, interactive sound installations and other sound arts practices.\n\nYou will take an option module, where you choose from subjects such as photography, moving image, creative writing, architecture, design or various others. In the second semester of this year you will start one-to-one tutorials with your dedicated tutor, supporting you in the first stages of your final research essay, which links strongly to the final practice-based project in the third year.\n\nModules\n\nPractice 5 and 6: Sound for Screen\n\nHCS 3: Sound/Music and the Moving Image\n\nPractice 7: Sound Arts Practice\n\nPractice 8: Final Project and Research Essay Proposals\n\nHCS 4: Theory and History of Sound Art\n\nOptions*\n\nVisual Diary\n\nCreative Curiosity\n\nBook Arts\n\nLand and Sea: Drawing on Location\n\nDrawing from the Landscape\n\nDrawing in the Expanded Field\n\nCreative Writing for Performance\n\nArtistic Anatomy\n\nCreative Use of the Camera\n\nSoundworks\n\nFilm Festivals\n\nVideogames Cultures\n\n*Option modules are indicative and may change, depending on timetabling and staff availability.\n\nFinal year\n\nIn your final year, you will work more independently than in previous years. This year consists of the following elements:\n\na research essay written in the first semester\n\na practical project in the second semester\n\nthe completion of a professional practice in the second semester\n\nthe development of your final project in the first semester.\n\nThe practical project is an intensive process where all the professional skills (practical, intellectual, organisational and production management) gained during the course of studies are condensed into one well developed, documented and presented final project, that will be publicly exhibited during the degree show in June. Your final year will involve one-to-one tutorials, study groups, seminars, lectures and professional practice sessions. All years attend creative studio techniques and audio seminar sessions and benefit from ongoing technical workshops.\n\nModule\n\nPractice 9: Final Project Development\n\nProfessional Practice\n\nHCS 5: Final Research Essay\n\nPractice 10: Final Project\n\nThe fees listed here are for the first year of full-time study if you start your course in the academic year 2024–25.\n\nYou will pay fees for each year of your course.
