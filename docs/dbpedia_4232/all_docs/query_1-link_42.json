        "text": "Christopher Roberts is a composer and musician who draws from the classical, jazz, and Pacific Rim musical traditions. He studied music in New York at the Juilliard School, where he earned master’s and doctoral degrees in both composition and double bass. Following the focus and intensity of the conservatory environment, he shouldered his bass and went to live in Papua New Guinea on a quest to understand natural prosody in music. He then traveled to Taiwan on a Fulbright grant to study the Chinese classical qin, which inadvertently led to research of the island’s aboriginal music. He taught composition, theory, and double bass for a number of years at Soochow University in Taipei and is now the music program director at Whatcom Community College in Bellingham.\n\nArtist Support Program 2007: Trio for Deep Voices, contemporary chamber pieces for three double basses."
