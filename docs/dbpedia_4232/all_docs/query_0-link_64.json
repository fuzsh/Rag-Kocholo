Whilst some witnesses are seemingly paralysed by fear, others step in. Some escape unscathed while others pay a heavy price for their courage...\n\n*Grierson Nominated*\n\n\"Exceptional film\" - The Guardian\n\n1×60' for BBC Two (2011)\n\nProduction Company: BBC Worldwide\n\nDirected by: Jaclyn Parry\n\nProduced by: Meredith Chambers\n\nEditing by: Christy Hanna\n\nLike many children who are taken into foster care, Maisie has suffered abuse and neglect almost all her life.
