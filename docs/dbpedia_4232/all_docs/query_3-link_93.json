        "text": "WICKHAM’S CAY II, Tortola, VI- Two well-respected men in West Indies and Leeward Islands cricket, Sir Anderson Montgomery Everton Roberts [Andy] of Antigua and Mr Elquemedo Tonito Willett, MBE of Nevis, are the first to be outfitted with the Leeward Islands Cricket Board (LICB) Gold Jacket.\n\nThe auspicious occasion took place at the Moorings Dinning Hall on Tortola on December 6, 2022, when two familiar persons in the Virgin Islands, Arsen Brent Defraitas and Mr Maxford Pipe, were also honoured for their contribution to Leeward Islands cricket.\n\nPersons traveled from Antigua, St Kitts and Nevis, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and the US Virgin Islands to be part of the inaugural LICB Gold Jacket Awards Ceremony hosted by the BVI Cricket Association (BVICA).\n\nSir Andy\n\nSir Anderson Montgomery Everton Roberts is a former Antiguan first-class cricketer who is considered the father of modern West Indian fast bowling. Roberts played Test cricket for the West Indies, twice taking seven wickets in a Test innings. Arriving in England in 1972, he played first-class cricket for Hampshire County Cricket Club and then later for Leicestershire County Cricket Club.\n\nRoberts, 71, was the first Antiguan to play Test cricket for the West Indies, thus leading the way for many of his famous countrymen including Sir Vivian Richards, Richie Richardson and Curtly Ambrose. In 2009, Roberts was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.\n\nElquemedo Tonito Willett MBE\n\nMr Elquemedo Tonito Willett MBE, 69, is a former West Indian international cricketer who played in five Test matches in 1973 and 1974.\n\nHe made his first-class debut for Leeward Islands in 1970-71 at the age of 17, and played his last match in the 1988-89 season. He took 8 for 73 (his best innings figures) and 3 for 44 for the West Indians against Glamorgan in 1973.\n\nDuring New Zealand's tour of the West Indies in 1972, Willett was considered the best of the many left-arm finger-spinners the New Zealanders faced.\n\nWillett was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to sport.\n\nBoth men expressed gratitude for being honoured by LICB.\n\nDeFreitas & Pipe Honoured\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Arsen Brent Defraitas and Mr Maxford Pipe were honoured for representing the [British] Virgin Islands at the regional level of the sport. They were all present with the exception of Pipe who was away due to a death in the family.\n\nAmong those present to witness and cheer for the honourees were Premier and Minister of Finance Dr the Honourable Natalio D. Wheatley (R7), Cricket West Indies (CWI) President Hon Ricky Skerritt, and LICB President Mr Enoch Lewis.\n\nBVI Cricket Association President Mr Vajendra Bharrat was applauded for hosting the ‘high quality’ event."
