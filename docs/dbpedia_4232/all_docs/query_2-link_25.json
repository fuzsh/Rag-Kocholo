        "text": "Nonesuch released Nashville in April of 1997. Recorded in Nashville and produced by Wayne Horvitz with members of Allison Krauss' Union Station band - mandolin player Adam Steffey and banjo player Ron Block - the project also features her brother and Lyle Lovett's bass player Viktor Krauss, dobro great Jerry Douglas, vocalist Robin Holcomb and Pat Bergeson on harmonica. \"Comprising acoustic instrumental folk tunes with unpredictable stylistic accents, Nashville boasts a dreamy, seductive grandeur. The backing mandolin/dobro/bass interplay simmers - Frisell himself picks and strings and most of all floats, laying out liquid tones that settle over the melodies like heat haze on a swampy, swimmerless lake.\" wrote the LA Weekly. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution summed it up simply as, \"Frisell's nod to Nashville is Americana at its best.\"\n\nIn January of 1998 Frisell's next project Gone, Just Like A Train came out. On this exceptionally melodic and rhythmically vital instrumental collection of original compositions, Frisell is joined by Viktor Krauss and by Jim Keltner, all star drummer of choice for Bob Dylan, Ry Cooder, T-Bone Burnett, George Harrison, John Lennon and The Traveling Wilburys. The Rocket in Seattle wrote that \"Frisell has managed to pull together an ad hoc super trio of musicians from drastically different pasts, and they manage to assemble a machine of colossal proportions: part skewered jazz, part roadside folk blues, part gritty rock..Gone presents Frisell at a creative apex. He's integrated a thoroughly unique understanding of so much American Music. And it's all gift-wrapped in a lean, unimposing trio framework that conveys sheer genius in a million directions. It flies with shining power.\" Produced by Lee Townsend, the album proved to be one of Frisell's most celebrated and popular to date.\n\nGood Dog, Happy Man, brims full of Frisell's shimmering original compositions. Here he is reunited with the Gone Just Like a Train rhythm section of Viktor Krauss on bass and Jim Keltner on drums and joined by Wayne Horvitz on Hammond B3 organ, multi-instrumentalist/slide guitarist Greg Leisz (known for his work with Joni Mitchell, K.D. Lang, Emmy Lou Harris, Beck and Jimmie Dale Gilmore, among others) plus special guest Ry Cooder on the traditional folk song \"Shenendoah\". Produced by Lee Townsend, Good Dog, Happy Man celebrates Frisell's emergence as a composer who has created a genre unto himself. The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote: \"The 12 breathtakingly beautiful originals on Good Dog, Happy Man resist every obvious classification. Frisell's been doing the undefinable for years - creating revelatory music from threadbare accompaniment; finding vital contexts for jazz improvisation that are worlds away from bebop; burying shiny nuggets of melody beneath a gauzy lace-like surface. Frisell manages to evoke big worlds with stark single notes and foreboding sustained tones, conjuring a richly textured atmosphere that is both understated and undeniable. No matter what you call it.\"\n\n\"Bill Frisell makes such consistently great records that it would be easy to take the guitarist for granted. That would be sad, since no one refracts age-old Americana through a cutting-edge prism with the warm-hearted, fleet-minded individuality of Frisell. With Good Dog, Happy Man, he has crafted one of his earthiest essays yet. Backed by an ultra-hip band, Frisell has forged originals whose folky melodies and big-sky grooves make them seem like old friends in snazzy new clothes.\" - Billboard.\n\nBill's solo album, Ghost Town was called described as \"moody, articulate music is a milestone in the career of a true innovator - enchanting as anything he has done and a clear window into his muse\" CMJ. With producer Lee Townsend, Frisell has created a sonic tapestry that weaves in and out of original material and cover songs, some recorded in multiple layers, others recorded nakedly solo. According to Billboard, \"Ghost Town sounds like a classic already\".\n\nFor Frisell's acclaimed CD Blues Dream, released on Nonesuch in early 2001, the New Quartet of Greg Leisz, David Piltch and Kenny Wollesen is joined by a horn section of Ron Miles (trumpet), Billy Drewes (alto saxophone) and Curtis Fowlkes (trombone). In many ways it represents a culmination of the strands running through many of the recordings in Frisell's catalogue, combining the homespun lyricism of Good Dog, Happy Man, Gone Just Like a Train and Nashville with the orchestral timbres of Quartet and the expanded tonal palette and harmonic sophistication afforded by a larger group (i.e. The Sweetest Punch, This Land and Before We Were Born.) Produced by Lee Townsend, it has been described as \"A rich, eclectic masterpiece.\" Blair Jackson, Mix Magazine.\n\nThe Autumn of 2001 saw the Nonesuch release of Bill Frisell with Dave Holland and Elvin Jones, on which Bill was joined by two jazz legends to interpret a number of the most enduring compositions from his songbook as well as Henry Manicini's \"Moon River\" and Stephen Foster's \"Hard Times\" in another Townsend-produced set. \"Holland and Jones warm well to the folk-inflected material, complimenting the guitarist's offbeat charm and unerring taste with their muscular authority.\" Billboard.\n\nThe Willies is Frisell's characteristically inimitable and modern take on bluegrass and country blues with Danny Barnes (from The Bad Livers) on banjo and guitar and Keith Lowe, (known for his work with Fiona Apple, David Sylvian, Kelly Joe Phelps and Wayne Horvitz) on bass. Produced by Lee Townsend and released in June, 2002 on Nonesuch, the material consists of such traditional songs as \"Cluck Old Hen\", \"John Hardy\", \"Single Girl\", \"Sugar Baby\", \"Blackberry Blossom\", \"Sitting on Top of the World\", \"Good Night Irene\", \"Cold, Cold Heart\" and a number of Frisell's original compositions. John Cratchley, in The Wire described it as follows: \"This is music that you feel you have known yet you have never heard before, like some treasured memory of an event that hasn't happened yet . - It is firmly rooted in the simplest of musical gestures yet manages to build, intricate layer by intricate layer into a manifestation of cultural timelessness - . This is composition of the highest order masquerading as back-porch rambling.\"\n\nFrisell's encounters with such Malian musicians as singer and guitarist Boubacar Traore and percussionist Sidiki Camara, who has played with many of Mali's most renowned performers, left him eager to further explore the commonalities of African and American roots musics. His grammy-nominated 2003 Nonesuch release, The Intercontinentals, produced by Lee Townsend, is evidence of those impulses. In late 2001, Frisell assembled an intriguing quartet with Brazilian composer, singer, guitarist and percussionist Vinicius Cantuária, Greek-Macedonian musician Christos Govetas on oud, bouzouki and vocals and Mali's Camara on percussion and vocals. The debut concerts at Seattle's Earshot Festival created quite a stir. Downbeat described the group's music as possessing \"fine webs of guitar interlacings, swaying momentum, dense textures and rhythmic urgency.\" The group was soon expanded to include Greg Leisz (on pedal steel and various slide guitars) and Jenny Scheinman (violin). The material on the album consists of Frisell compositions plus songs by Boubacar Traore, Cantuaria, Gilberto Gil and Govetas. It is an album that combines Frisell's own brand of American roots music and his unmistakable improvisational style with the influences of Brazilian, Greek and Malian sounds. The Washington Post called it, \"A remarkable achievement - a hybrid that somehow both respects and transcends the styles involved..... with a sort of earthy, relaxed feeling - it's country music from the global village.\" Post\n\nFrisell's 2004 Nonesuch release, Unspeakable, featuring his long-time rhythm section of Tony Scherr and Kenny Wollesen as well as percussionist Don Alias, horn arrangements by Steven Bernstein, and Frisell's string writing for the 858 strings of Jenny Scheinman, Eyvind Kang and Hank Roberts is \"a revisiting of an old friendship that stretches back 20 years: a partnership with producer Hal Willner. Taking fragments of obscure vinyl records as a launching point, the duo traverses a landscape that passes, in an almost hallucinatory way, through myriad styles.\" - Billboard. The Observer describes it this way: \"The brilliant 53-year old guitarist embraces a jazzy kind of post-rock whose most immediate point of reference is the electric Miles Davis. It's a multi-textured, multi-hued disc that never sees Frisell sacrifice his impeccable technique, or neglect the deep structure of his songs, but never sees him forget to have fun either.\" And the Sunday Independent had this to say about it: Unspeakable radiates the kind of authority that only absolute confidence in the primacy of melody and feel in music can confer.\" It won a Grammy award in 2005 for Best Contemporary Jazz recording.\n\nEast/West is a double-live CD featuring Frisell's two working trios. \"West\" features Bill's trio with Viktor Krauss and Kenny Wollesen and was recorded at Yoshi's in Oakland. \"East\" features Frisell's other working trio with Tony Scherr and Kenny Wollesen. It was recorded at the Village Vanguard in New York City. Further East/Further West offers additional material by these two trios available in download format only. Produced by Lee Townsend, Salon.com described it as follows.\n\n\"The two trios are vastly different. In general terms, the Krauss trio works by accumulation and aims to mesmerize, while the Scherr trio operates much closer to traditional jazz... Wolleson, essentially a groove player in the Krauss trio (and a monstrously good one), becomes an interactive, improvising presence in the Scherr trio..... In both settings Frisell is a wonder.... For any skeptics of modern jazz, this should be required listening... one of the best of his career.\"\n\nHis album, Bill Frisell, Ron Carter, Paul Motian (Nonesuch), a collaboration with two musicians who Bill considers to be true mentors and inspirations, represents a personal milestone for him. All About Jazzdescribed it as \"A gorgeous, restrained meeting of the minds, this recording embodies fine, subtle improvisations from three of today's most iconic players.\"\n\nHistory, Mystery, nominated for a Grammy award in Best Instrumental Jazz category and featuring an octet of strings, horns and rhythm section with some of his closest music collaborators, it explores a fuller palette of compositional colors and timbres than any Frisell has previously written for. \"The whole album stands as yet another testament to the man's place at the very epicenter of modern American music.\" - BBC.\n\nThe recent collection titled The Best of Bill Frisell, Vol 1: Folk Songs is the first in a series of compilations, this one drawn from Frisell's catalog spotlighting his idiosyncratic excursions into country and traditional folk.\n\nDisfarmer features long-time colleagues Greg Leisz, Jenny Scheinman and Viktor Krauss and was inspired by the photographer Mike Disfarmer. \"Frisell's pacing is magnificent, and the album sweeps along with purpose like a gorgeous, spacious epic. It is full of sounds that suggest settings and characters, including the mysterious eccentric who inspired the recording.\" - The Houston Chronicle\n\nAfter 22 years of a fruitful relationship with Nonesuch records dating from the late '80's, Frisell has embarked on an exciting new chapter with the Savoy Label Group. For his first album for the label, Beautiful Dreamers features a trio Eyvind Kang on viola and Rudy Royston on drums. The material consists of a number of Frisell originals plus interpretations of such classic songs as \"It's Nobody's Fault But Mine\", \"Tea for Two\", \"Goin' Out of My Head\", \"Keep on the Sunnyside\" and a rousing rendition of Benny Goodman's \"Benny's Bugle\". \"This record doesn't really sound much like jazz as much as compelling, emotionally resonant, genre-free music. Sure, it swings in places, and there's some fiery improvisation. But after decades of trodding such a brave and singular path, maybe Frisell deserves his own genre. How about 'friz'?\" Financial Times (London).\n\nFrisell's second album for Savoy Jazz, Sign of Life, with his 858 Quartet featuring Jenny Scheinman (violin), Eyvind Kang (viola) and Hank Roberts (cello) finds him exploring chamber-group dynamics and interplay on a set of all-Frisell original material in a seamless concoction of all composition and improvisation. \"Of the many families of musicians that nourish Frisell's music, the 858 Quartet is among the most satisfying yet least recorded. So make the most of this endlessly varied, gloriously inventive music ... Most of all, it's music retains that classic Frisell feel of melancholic optimism... and in its humility and generosity stands prouder and than music that swaggers and brags.\" Jazzwise (UK)\n\nIn 2011, Frisell assembled a trusted ensemble consisting of Greg Leisz (guitars), Jenny Scheinman (violin), Tony Scherr (bass) and Kenny Wollesen (drums) to record his take on the classic songs of John Lennon. The project had long been in the worksâ€”one could go as far back as the first time he heard the Beatles at the age of 13. Fast forward a few decades and Frisell was asked to put together a performance in honor of Lennon as part of a special event in Paris. The arrangements and interpretations came to fruition with this project on All We Are Saying... (Savoy Jazz) \"This is a glorious hymn to the art of playing together, of which Lennon would surely approve.\" - The Independent (London)\n\nFrisell’s debut release for OKeh/Sony Masterworks, Big Sur, featured music commissioned by the Monterey Jazz Festival and composed at the Glen Deven Ranch in Big Sur, for strings, guitar and drums in a quintet comprised of long-time musical associates Jenny Scheinman, Eyvind Kang, Hank Roberts and Rudy Royston. \"As the title implies, Big Sur is about the rugged sweep of California coastline that runs south of the Monterey Peninsula, with a sound that often courts the majestic, this suite-like work attempts to evoke an experience, a sense of place... The sound of these pieces convincingly suggests a blush of discovery bound by larger purpose... What’s striking about Big Sur is its determined strength of melody, along with its shrewd marshaling of resources. It merges two of Mr. Frisell’s recent bands: his 858 Quartet, essentially a string ensemble, and Beautiful Dreamers, a hardier post-bop trio. ... it’s not an album that hangs on the guitar playing in general, deriving more purpose from chamber-like actions. The big picture is the point, and as usual, credit is due to Lee Townsend, Mr. Frisell’s longtime producer.”…. The New York Times.\n\nAlways on the lookout for opportunities to \"dig around for where I'm coming from,\" Frisell’s Grammy nominated GUITAR IN THE SPACE AGE!, is an homage to the inspirational popular music of his formative years made in the wake of the birth of the Fender Telecaster guitar - (1951, the same year as Frisell’s own birth) - that, he recalls, \"got me super fired-up\" about his instrument of choice. Frisell and his band mates explore material on the Okeh/Sony Masterworks release associated with The Beach Boys, Junior Wells, Pete Seeger, The Byrds, Duane Eddy, The Ventures, The Kinks, Chet Atkins, Link Wray, Speedy West & Jimmy Bryant, The Astronauts, Merle Travis, Johnny Smith and others, as well as original material by Frisell. Jazz Times describes the album as \"representing a terrific leap of imagination, offering fresh takes on signature guitar sounds that still resonate throughout pop culture.\"\"\n\n“Frisell has had a lot of practice putting high concept into a humble package. Long hailed as one of the most distinctive and original improvising guitarists of our time, he has also earned a reputation for teasing out thematic connections with his music... He has drawn recent, long-form inspiration from the rural portrait photography of Mike Disfarmer and the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927… There’s a reason that Jazz at Lincoln Center had him program a series called Roots of Americana.” New York Times\n\nFrisell’s third album for Okeh/Sony is the Grammy-nominated When You Wish Upon a Star, a project that germinated at Lincoln Center during Bill’s two-year appointment as guest curator for Lincoln Center’s Roots of Americana series. It features Frisell with vocalist Petra Haden, Eyvind Kang (viola), Thomas Morgan (bass) and Rudy Royston (drums) performing Frisell’s arrangements and interpretations of Music from Film and Television. “an album that, in its own inherent diversity and performed by a stellar group that features, for the first time, a vocalist in his lineup, ranks not only as one of the guitarist’s best albums in recent years, but one of his best recordings ever.” All About Jazz\n\nSmall Town, Frisell’s 2017 duo album with bassist Thomas Morgan was recorded at the suitably intimate and venerable Village Vanguard in New York City and released on ECM records with a second volume to follow in 2019. \"Bill Frisell is our greatest living jazz guitarist. Thomas Morgan is the most gifted bassist to enter jazz in the new millennium. In the minimalist duo format of Small Town, Frisell's glittering, spellbinding sound and his bold imaginative acts stand clear.\"\n\nBill’s solo album Music IS, was released in 2018 on OKeh/Sony Music Masterworks. Recorded at Tucker Martine’s Flora Recording and Playback studio in Portland and produced by longtime collaborator Lee Townsend, all of the compositions on Music IS were written by Frisell, some of them brand new, others being solo adaptations of now classic original compositions he had previously recorded. The focus of Music IS is on the telling of musical stories from Frisell’s original and inimitable perspective. Some of the interpretations are naked, exposed and truly solo, while others are more orchestrated through overdubbed layering and the use of Frisell's unparalleled approach to looping. The end result is Frisell at his most distilled and fully realized. \"More than many of his undeniably milestone recordings, the exceptional Music ISdeserves consideration as both a career high point and a masterpiece of solo guitar.” - All About Jazz\n\nHARMONY is Frisell’s debut album with Blue Note Records, released in 2019 and produced by Lee Townsend. The New York Times describes the album as follows: “The eminent guitarist improvises in smoky ringlets of melody, drawing the influence of classic jazz guitar into a palette based on early American folk music. He has been a noted bandleader since the 1980’s, but has never released an album for Blue Note Records, jazz’ most illustrious label. That will change with HARMONY, which finds Frisell playing smoldering original compositions along with a few covers alongside vocalist Petra Haden, cellist Hank Roberts and guitarist and bassist Luke Bergman.”\n\nValentine, released in 2020 on Blue Note Records, is a trio album with Thomas Morgan (bass) and Rudy Royston (drums) and produced by Lee Townsend, that has been hailed as “a masterpiece” by Downbeat. “They consistently and strikingly play as one, voices intertwined, completing phrases as if sharing a single thought…Even overdubs are so perfect that everything feels utterly organic…the performances represent jazz playing at its most sublime.”\n\nWilliam Richard Frisell\n\n1951\n\nBorn in Baltimore, Maryland, March 18\n\nMoved with his parents to Denver, Colorado\n\n1953\n\nBill's brother Robert Benjamin was born (June 3)\n\n1955\n\nBuilt his first guitar out of a piece of cardboard and some rubber bands for strings after being inspired by Jimmy, leader of the Mousekateers on the Mickey Mouse Club TV show.\n\n1960\n\nBegan study of the clarinet.
