        "text": "MUSIC\n\nOrgan Music\n\nLike many soap operas at the time, Another World was originally produced with live accompanying organ music. Organ music was used primarily at the beginning and end of scenes, including customized motifs for the female characters and couples. Irna Phillips wanted Charles Paul (with whom she had worked on As The World Turns and had commissioned to write the show's opening theme) to be the show's organist. But as soaps were still taped live, Paul wouldn't have been able to make it back from the NBC studios (where AW aired at 3:00) to the CBS studios to play for The Secret Storm (which aired at 4:00) in time. Instead, Clarke Morgan was hired as organist, from May 4, 1964 to December 28, 1968. However, Clarke's music was used until February 5, 1969. After his death, Chet Kingsbury and Al Finelli took turns at the keyboard, until Kingsbury was selected and remained until 1974.\n\nAnother World creator, Irna Phillips had this to say in her manuscript, \"All My Worlds,\" about the use of organ music on soap operas.\n\n\"I suppose now is as good a time as any to admit that I alone am responsible for introducing in radio serials something that has come to annoy me and has annoyed many listeners and viewers -- organ music as a background. I know for a certainty that organ music is the one element most people immediately associate with the serial. Why did I turn to the organ for background music? The Guiding Light was the first program to use this music, and the explanation, in this instance, is logical. Mary, the daughter of Doctor Rutledge, was the organist in his church. Often during scenes in the minister's study, Mary could be heard practicing. It soon became obvious to me that organ music did much to help set the mood for a scene. That must have been obvious to other serial writers and sponsor, for within a short time many programs were punctuated by organ music. I rue the day I ever turned to the organ.\"\n\nRecorded Music\n\nBy 1974, the show transitioned to recorded music, much of which was provided by Score Productions, a musical production company specializing in background music and themes that was started in 1963 by music producer Robert A. Israel (who composed the show's third theme).\n\nDiegetic music featured popular music played over the radio and jukeboxes within the story. According to soap historian Elena Levine, there is little evidence of the use of recorded popular music on tv shows before the 1970s. AW's use of \"The Sweetheart of Sigma Chi\" (Pat and Tom's theme) in 1964 may be the first use of a recorded song used as diegetic music within a tv show.\n\nMusic composers include James Dunne and Rock Rhodes.\n\nFrom the 1970s until 1987, certain scenes had specific musical accompaniments depending on the content. These included when something mysterious or sinister was happening on screen. A hypnotic arrangement was played while a character was having flashbacks.\n\nPreview Music\n\nFrom 1979 - September 1981, a hypnotic piano motif (sometimes accompanied by low strings) played as key scenes of that day's episode ran, which was followed by the regular \"Opening Sequence.\" From September 1981 to 1983, the Fourth Theme song played during the previews. It should be noted that, while previews were not included with every episode, they usually included three or four scenes that were noteworthy or important to the overall storylines.\n\nOpening Theme Songs\n\nThe Original Opening Theme Song ran from 1964-1966 with the Original Opening Sequence. The introduction began with chords played on a Hammond organ. Then three piano notes were played, followed by an ascending, arpeggio and chromatic melody line as the organ chords swelled to an intense and exciting close. The introduction was dropped in 1966 and only featured the main melody during the opening sequence.\n\nThe Second Theme ran from 1966-1975 and was written by Charles Paul. The theme was a sweeping, beautiful composition with lush instrumentation and an uplifting melody featuring the organ, and a full orchestra and celeste solo during the mid-section. The celeste gave the piece a lovely, tranquil quality befitting moments of joy, declarations of love, and wedding ceremonies. The Third Theme ran from spring 1975 - September 4, 1981 and was composed by Robert A. Israel, who was owner and president of Score Productions, Inc. The composition featured a full orchestra with a gorgeous melody played three times. The third includes the piano with a slight variation of the main melody and chord progressions. These two theme songs were used during the opening sequence of Interlocking Rings.\n\nThe second theme is available on the album, \"Original Themes From the Great Soap Operas\" (Columbia House/Realm Records, 1977). This record is out of print, but copies may exist at flea markets and such.\n\nThe Fourth Theme song debuted with the Block Letters opening sequence and played from September 7, 1981 - March 27, 1987. The theme music was written by composer Jonathan L. Segal. This piece was majestic and included a catchy main melody. The introduction featured brass instruments, then led to the primary melody being played by strings and then the trumpets. The mid-section prominently featured trumpets and french horns with harmonies played by the other wind instruments. The composition also features the main melody being played three times before its closing chords. This theme is available on \"Television Theme Recordings\" by Steve Gelfand (Popular Culture, Inc, 1984).\n\nOn March 27, 1987, Crystal Gayle and Gary Morris introduced the song, \"Another World (You Take Me Away To),\" was written by John Leffler and Ralph Shuckett, where they appeared as themselves to perform at Felicia's restaurant TOPS.\n\nThe Fifth Theme Song was an instrumental version of, \"Another World (You Take Me Away To).\" From March 30 - October 23, 1987 the song (sometimes including the lyrics) played during the Block Letters opening sequence. The original song, as sung by Crystal Gayle and Gary Morris, debuted as the opening theme on October 26, 1987 and was played until March 1, 1996 during the Computer Enhanced opening sequence.\n\nThe Gayle/Morris theme song is available on Crystal Gayle's \"What if We Fall in Love?\" (1987) and \"Crystal Gayle: Duets\" (2000), and on Gary Morris's \"Gary Morris Greatest Hits Vol. II\" (1990). The chorus used for the opening segment was available for download from Sound America, under \"Themes.\"\n\nThe Sixth and Final Theme was a slightly jazzy, fast-paced, industrial tune used with the MTV Style opening sequence. The song was written by Dominic Messinger.\n\nCouples/Character Theme Songs\n\nTom Baxter and Pat Randolph: The Sweetheart of Sigma Chi, written by Byron D. Stokes and F.

Occasionally the lyrical version would be used.\n\n(2) The \"Rock\" Instrumental, which started on July 26, 1988, was played about 90%-95% of the time.\n\n(3) Special music is played to commemorate special events during regular and special episodes.\n\nFor about two years from 1987-1989, an instrumental version of the theme song was played occasionally.\n\nFrom March 4, 1996 - June 25, 1999, a new jazzy end theme was played during the end credits on a recurring basis.\n\nSpecial end music for regular episodes has included the following:\n\nCast singing \"Silent Night,\" with Bill Wolff extending holiday wishes on behalf of cast and crew (December 25, 1969)\n\nSound effects of a stormy night, with no music (February 4, 1972)\n\nTo commemorate the show's 10th Anniversary.

After all the scenes are chosen, the Associate Director will work closely with the Editor to piece the montage together to make it look warm and loving, or scary, or whatever it needs to be, afterward, the music director will add appropriate music to enhance the montage. Some times if editing to the beat in a particular musical piece is important, we will put the music in before editing the video in. The producer has the final word on the montage before it is put into the show.\" (Karen Thomas, AW Editor, for the AWHP, 1997)\n\nSingers\n\nProfessional\n\nDawn Rollo. Dawn performed at TOPS.\n\nDean Frame. Dean was a professional singer who went on to do concerts and make albums and music videos.

Tracy was an enormously successful singer who toured and cut albums.\n\nDanny Fargo. Danny wrote songs for his girlfriends. One of them, \"Under The Moon With You,\" hit the airwaves and was performed by Marcella Martin (as girlfriend Flo Murray). It was a musical collaboration between Agnes Nixon and organist Clarke Morgan (once a musical director). Other songs written by Danny Fargo included: \"In All the World,\" and a slow, dreamy song called, \"My Love For You.\"\n\nLyrics to \"Under The Moon With You\"\n\nUnder the moon with you\n\nOne night in June with you\n\nI want to be soon with you\n\nUnder the moon with you.\n\nA blanket of blue above\n\nA sweetheart for me to love\n\nHey Baby, I'm thinking of\n\nThe moon and my turtledove...\n\nWhen the moon casts its light upon us\n\nThat's when we two can make hay\n\nWith the Man in the Moon smiling on us\n\nAnd that's why I always say\n\nI want to be soon with you\n\nOne night in June with you\n\nUnder the moon with you\n\nUnder the moon...\n\nIn June with you.\n\nAmateur\n\nDonna.

Toni sings in her church choir.\n\nIn the summer of 1991, the show hosted a contest to determine who would become Dean Frame's backup band. Eight hundred tapes were submitted from rock groups wanting to be on the show. Viewers phoned a 1-800 number to vote for their favorite group. \"Goodtime Gyspy\" by Stalker was played on July 16, 1991. Also played that day was a song called \"One Mind\" which was performed by a band named Senyaka. Melodic Rock band Rascal won against the two other bands in the finals, Wild August and Tamela. Dean's backup band, Rascal were portrayed by: Sean Ashley, Lisa Bekker, Chris Howell, and Jeff Warren. On the show they sang \"Days Gone By\" and performed the music for \"Ladykiller.\" The song, \"Ladykiller\" was written by John Leffler and John Siegler, performed by Ricky Paull Goldin (Dean Frame) and Rascal, and produced by John Leffler Music. The video for \"Ladykiller\" took twenty-three hours to tape and cost almost as much to produce as an entire episode of the show.\n\nIntermission and Show Bumpers\n\nDuring intermission (around the show's half-way mark) and show bumpers (between commercials) music was briefly played while the Opening Logo was shown. The music played was primarily the introduction of the opening theme songs, variations of the themes, or completely different melodies. From January 1975-September 4, 1981 a brief melody on string instruments was played. Other times, a piano struck nine notes with chords played on strings. From 1987-1996, the end of the theme song's chorus with Gary Morris and Crystal Gayle singing, \"'Cause when I'm with you. You take me away to Another World\" was used. From 1996-1999, the last few bars of the opening theme song was played.\n\nPopular Music\n\nOver the years, many popular songs were played during scenes, which served many purposes including: couples and character themes, accompanying music for social occasions such as parties and weddings, background music at popular hangouts, montages, and background music to compliment particular scenes. In some cases, this was an effort to attract younger viewers, particularly during school breaks. The Popular Song List has been compiled to be as comprehensive as possible and encompass the show's entire run. However, it is by no means complete and will continue to grow through ongoing research.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nOn September 28, 1979, Pink Floyd taped their song \"One of My Turns,\" from their 1979 album, \"The Wall.\" At the song's beginning, Trudy Young performs a monologue while a television plays in the background in the studio. Part of the television broadcast that was captured was an episode of that day's episode of Another World. The scene is possibly with Charles Cioffi who played Kirk Laverty (1979), but the other man is unknown at this time. Some dialogue is audible; most noteably, \"Mrs. Bancroft,\" who was Iris while she was married to Brian Bancroft."
