        "text": "Reading Time: 2 minutes\n\nWest Indies fast bowling great Sir Andy Roberts is to receive an honorary degree from the University of the West Indies (UWI) for his outstanding contributions to regional and international development.\n\nHe is among 14 Caribbean nationals who will receive honorary degrees at the Five Islands Campus on October 10.\n\nRoberts, who turned 70 in January, played 47 Test matches for the West Indies between 1974 and 1983 and took 202 wickets at an average of 25.61. From the 1970s to early 1980s, Roberts was a member of a West Indies bowling attack that included Joel Garner, Michael Holding and Colin Croft and who were known across the world as the Furious Foursome.\n\nWhile a member of a virtually invincible West Indies team, Roberts won the Prudential World Cup in 1975 and 1979. The West Indies have not won the ICC World Cup since even though the team won the ICCT20 World Cup in 2012 and 2016.\n\nSir Andy Roberts was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Nation (KCN) by the Antiguan and Barbudan government in February 2014.\n\nHe was inducted into the United States Cricket Hall of Fame in 2005 and, in 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.\n\nAfter retirement, he contributed to the development of West Indies cricket as an administrator overseeing the preparation of pitches and he worked with Bangladesh’s fast bowlers in 2001 and again in 2005.\n\nUnquestionably passionate about the regional team, the legendary fast bowler is also known for being outspoken and has been critical of the administration of Cricket West Indies and some of their players.\n\nIn January, Roberts was especially critical of Jason Holder, whom he said was a ‘damn good player’ was ‘lost’ as West Indies captain.\n\n“I think Jason Holder as a captain on the field is lost. I don’t think he’s aware what is going on the field because if I win a toss as a captain and before lunch on a green top pitch I am having a man on the point boundary then I am lost,” Sir Andy famously said.\n\n“That’s the first thing. His field placing [leaves] a lot to be desired and I believe the time should come where he takes instructions from the coaches who can see the game better than he can.”\n\nSpeaking more broadly, he said he does not believe the West Indies bowlers work hard enough at their craft and is the reason there are not more consistent during matches."
