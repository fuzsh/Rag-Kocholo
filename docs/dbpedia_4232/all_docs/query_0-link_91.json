        "text": "EXCELLENCE IN MUSIC EDUCATION FOR EVERY LEVEL AND INTEREST\n\nThe 2022-2023 academic year marked 50 years of music education at Humber College. What began as a single three-year diploma program 50 years ago has grown to an ecosystem of five credential and non-credential offerings that foster excellence in music at every level. Click a tile below to learn about your study options.\n\nThe next 50 years are set to be just as bright for Humber Music students, with all five offerings moving to the Humber Cultural Hub in fall 2024. The most significant investment in arts and cultural programming in Humber’s history, the Hub includes modern purpose-built performance and rehearsal spaces for the music programs. Learn more at humber.ca/CulturalHub or see the sidebar for information about the new music facilities.\n\nMore About Community Music\n\nThe Community Music School (CMS) provides accessible music education to children and youth in the GTA. Founded in 1980 and operating out of Humber’s Lakeshore Campus, the School offers weekly private lessons and small-group classes to children and youth of all musical experience levels.\n\nOver the past 40-plus years, CMS has established an international reputation as a leader in jazz and children’s music education, helping thousands of students develop their talent and pursue their aspirations in music."
