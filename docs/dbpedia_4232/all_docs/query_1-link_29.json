        "text": "Navona Records is proud to present RESTLESS NATION: THE MUSIC OF ANDY TEIRSTEIN. A student of Leonard Bernstein and Henry Brant, Teirstein’s music has been described by The New York Times as “magically atmospheric” and “tumultuously exuberant,” with “shifts from dark, earthy urgency to floating purity.” Featuring master soloists Marco Ambrosini (nyckelharpa) and Yair Dalal (oud), this new collection takes inspiration from the composer’s many travels directing the global initiative Translucent Borders, with musical influences from Bedouin singing, Scandinavian folk music, and his roots as a folk fiddle and banjo player. Letter from Woody is an orchestral reimagining of a letter the iconic folk balladeer Woody Guthrie wrote to his lover and future wife, the dancer Marjorie Mazia, in the 1940s, with hints of Guthrie’s songs and an introduction for harmonica. Restless Nation for string quartet, reflective of an upended country with a powerful Appalachian roots tradition, recalls the year Teirstein’s family embarked on a home-schooling expedition through America; it evokes the excitement, wonder, and challenges encountered on this journey. RESTLESS NATION: THE MUSIC OF ANDY TEIRSTEIN celebrates Teirstein’s diverse and compelling work.\n\nAzazme Songs: Suite for String Quartet, Oud and Dulcimer\n\nRecorded December 6, 2018 at New York University James L.

Each movement reflects different aspects of the adventure from the children’s perspective: the open road, the sounds of insects and night animals, rambunctious and reflective moments, wilderness, and the journey home. Now, in this pandemic moment, the restless energy resonates with a sense of wanting to move in conflicting directions: inward toward the surety of solitude, and outward with the persistent hope to connect in an irreconcilable, endlessly fascinating world.\n\nThe altered tuning of the first violin, borrowed from Arkansas fiddlers, is audible in the final (sixth) movement, driven by a fiddle tune called “The Hangman’s Reel.” Restless Nation was commissioned and premiered by the Cassatt Quartet at Symphony Space in New York City.\n\nThe folk influences in Secrets of the North and Azazme Songs are evident in the instrumentation and modalities, as played by the two master soloists, Marco Ambrosini (Nyckelharpa) and Yair Dalal (Oud). The composer explores here what is earthy, anonymous, and the collective imagination of communities over time. Secrets of the North is inspired by a short story by Isak Dinesen, The Sailor Boy’s Tale. An old Sami woman turns into a hawk and helps a boy. In this suite version, we hear the distinctive sound of the nyckelharpa (key fiddle). The larger piece is composed for narrator, string quartet, nyckelharpa, mouthbow, and concertina. The music strives to achieve a sense of what is ethereal and yet wild and raw—elements that are inherent in Scandinavian folk music.\n\nThe suite of tunes Azazme Songs was composed after a four-day trek with the Walidi family of the Azazme Bedouins across the Aravah desert, close to the Israel/Egypt border. The caravan was organized by Yair Dalal and the Walidis. At each meal, ouds and violins were taken down from the camels and played. The songs are known as “Hjennies,” old tunes the camel drivers sing to themselves on their journeys across the Aravah. The gently repeating themes are steeped in the maqamat Rast and Bayati. Azazme Songs is not intended as authentic transcription, but as the musical offering of a beginner, impressions gleaned from listening around the fire after walking across an ancient landscape, filled with the sense of time unbound. The Appalachian lap dulcimer is used here as a sound evoked by the Bedouin Sumsumia, a strummed psaltery-like instrument.\n\nIn 1942, folk balladeer Woody Guthrie was asked to play for the Martha Graham Dance Company in a piece entitled “Folksay.” But Guthrie had difficulty singing his songs the same way each time, and so was paired up with one of the dancers, Marjorie Mazia, in order to learn to count an equal number of beats between verses. The two were immediately drawn to one another, and Woody began to woo her away from her husband in Philadelphia. When Marjorie became pregnant with Woody’s child, she retreated to consider her options. Woody wrote her a series of letters, each one a school composition book. Letter from Woody is inspired by one of these notebook letters. An extended version of this piece includes text for actor/folk singer and dancer. The piece draws on traditional American folk string bowings and energies. Thanks to the BMI/Woody Guthrie Foundation and to the NYU Center for Ballet and the Arts for support, and to Nora Guthrie and Woody Guthrie Publications, for inviting the composer to the Woody Guthrie archives.\n\n— Andy Teirstein"
