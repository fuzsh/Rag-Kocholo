        "text": "Selected and Reviewed by ANDREW EALES\n\nFind out more: ABOUT PIANODAO REVIEWS\n\nThere are several reasons why I rarely review children’s method books. An important one is that I have found my views about a new method resource can change considerably after spending a year or two using it.\n\nTime and again, though, I have found myself returning to Pauline Hall’s Piano Time, a series which has remained popular with my students and delivered positive results for nearly three decades. Children using this series with me have enjoyed learning and practising, developed confident reading skills, healthy playing technique, nascent creativity, and imaginative engagement.\n\nThere are shortcomings with any method book, of course, and it’s important for all teachers to recognise the weaknesses in their chosen series. Only then can we deliver effective teaching and identify necessary supplementary materials. For more advice, read my article The Problem with Method Books, which explores the issue in depth.\n\nIn the meantime, Oxford University Press have just published fully updated Third Editions of the three core books in the Piano Time series, along with an unexpectedly useful book of accompaniments. With brand new illustrations throughout, a host of fresh new pieces, freely downloadable audio, and gentle tweaks to further facilitate smooth progression, this is a very significant update, so there’s never been a better time to rediscover Piano Time.\n\nHaving used the series for so long, I feel appropriately qualified to unpack the revision for existing users, and encourage potential newcomers to have a look at this landmark best-seller afresh.\n\nContinue reading Rediscovering Piano Time\n\nLiving & Playing Beyond the Notes\n\nWritten by ANDREW EALES\n\nADHD, or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, has become a hot topic of discussion in recent years, the apparent explosion of both child and adult diagnoses much commented on in the media and society at large.\n\nThis article has been cowritten with my wife Louise, who has three decades clinical experience working with children, and latterly adults, who have ADHD. She is now an advanced practitioner at ADHD 360, a leading private ADHD diagnosis and treatment clinic.\n\nFor my part, I have lived with this condition for a lifetime, only belatedly recognised and formally diagnosed in my fifties. ADHD has had a huge impact on my piano journey.\n\nOur shared aim is to provide pianists and educators with a unique, relevant, and practical perspective which combines Louise’s clinical expertise with my personal experience, and which specifically addresses the challenges those with ADHD face in the practice room, piano lesson and at live events.\n\nThe article which follows addresses many common questions, explaining what ADHD is, its causes, history, the signs and symptoms. We then go on to apply this to piano practice, lessons and performance, offering strategies to help those with ADHD and their teachers. Finally, Louise outlines the process of diagnosis and available medications.\n\nContinue reading ADHD • A Pianist’s Guide\n\nSelected and Reviewed by ANDREW EALES\n\nFind out more: ABOUT PIANODAO REVIEWS\n\nIt can be overwhelming keeping track of all the latest and best piano education resources from one year to the next, so I am happy to publish this year’s annual Pianodao roundup.\n\nRead on for my list of some of the most essential educational resources and piano publications of recent months and years. I have included a couple of my own alongside top titles written by leading educators and musicians from around the world.\n\nBetween them, these resources deliver the material we rely on to cover core skills development, essential repertoire, and teacher support resources.\n\nAnd to complement these physical publications, my friend Garreth Brooke has kindly written this companion piece for Pianodao: Essential Online Piano Education Resources.\n\nFor more information and tips on each publication, simply click on the titles. You can also right-click to open in a new tab. And you may want to consider bookmarking this page for future reference.\n\nContinue reading Essential Piano Education Resources 2024-25\n\nSelected and reviewed by ANDREW EALES\n\nFind out more: ABOUT PIANODAO REVIEWS\n\nThe slower pace of the summer break is a great time to catch up with music that has been waiting patiently in my review backlog, and this week I have been enjoying the elementary to intermediate pieces in the latest book from Anna Robinson, the fabulously named Pooches at the Piano.\n\nYou may remember Anna Robinson from my previous reviews of her intermediate collection Notes from a Neighbourhood (read the review) and easier Cats on the Keys (reviewed here). The new Pooches at the Piano offers a progressive selection of compositions that are suitable from Grades 0 – 3.\n\nA British-born pianist and teacher now based in Melbourne, Australia, her pieces are inspired by the legacy of the great Walter Carroll, and as he did a century or so ago, she writes imaginative tunes that are as rich in pedagogic content as they are inspiring to play.\n\nPooches at the Piano can be seen as a companion volume to Cats on the Keys, and as with that collection it is inspired in part by her own pet pooch, Lily, who is featured in the photograph above, admiring the book.\n\nFor me, one of the highlights of Notes on a Neighbourhood was the opening piece Dizzy Dog, which was dedicated to Lily, “who loves to roly-poly to chromatic scales”. It’s great to have a whole collection with a canine theme, so let’s find out more…\n\nContinue reading Pooches at the Piano\n\nSelected and reviewed by ANDREW EALES\n\nFind out more: ABOUT PIANODAO REVIEWS\n\nSergei Prokofiev (1891-1953) is unquestionably among the great composers of the solo piano repertoire, as well as one of the most important innovators. As Maurice Hinson and Wesley Roberts assert (in their Guide to the Pianist’s Repertoire, fourth edition, 2014):\n\n“Prokofiev developed an individual, percussive style, which was probably the most signifiant innovation in piano technique since Chopin. His percussive manner is uniquely blended with a lyric element frequently accompanied by strong dissonance, yet his basic arsenal of figuration stems directly from the nineteenth century. Influences of Russian folk song are evident in his melodies and energetic rhythms.”\n\nTo this impressive list of qualities, I think we must also add Prokofiev’s contrapuntal genius, clarity of musical texture, profound affinity with the instrument, biting wit, and of course remember that he composed some of the twentieth century’s most remarkably memorable and widely recognised melodies.\n\nWith the relaxing of copyright restrictions, we can happily anticipate that the available catalogue of Prokofiev piano music in print will rapidly grow in the coming months, raising the quality and increasing the choice of editions, as well as improving access to the composer’s less well-known pieces.\n\nDominated by the nine Sonatas, this astonishing body of work also includes more than 100 smaller pieces, as well as the composer’s transcriptions of his famous orchestral works. Edition Peters have been quick to reissue legacy editions, but perhaps more significantly, Henle have begun to bring out brand new scholarly urtext editions of the most significant pieces, so far including the Seventh Sonata and the virtuosic Toccata Op.11.\n\nAmong these releases, Henle’s new edition of the seminal masterpiece Visions Fugitives Op.22 is the subject of this review…\n\nContinue reading Prokofiev • Visions fugitives\n\nPianodao Reflections • A Pause for Thought\n\nWritten by ANDREW EALES\n\nRecently, my wife Louise had a minor kitchen accident which resulted in her breaking my favourite tea cup. As she tells the story:\n\n“So I broke Andrew’s favourite teacup.\n\nI felt I should make him a new one in pottery class.\n\nIt lists a little bit but it works!\n\nAndrew said that it’s the best thing that anyone has given him. He then went on to say that most people would’ve given up and started again once they noticed the listing.\n\nClearly I’m not most people!”\n\nAs you can see from the photo, my new cup is a thing of great beauty! But as Louise admits, it’s hardly perfect from a functional point of view. The listing perhaps doesn’t look serious, but when pouring tea into the cup it’s quite obvious that when one side is full to the brim, the other is but two-thirds full.\n\nThe beauty of my new mug is in its imperfection, its quirkiness, its vibrant personality, and its energy.\n\nContinue reading Beauty Within Imperfection\n\nSelected and reviewed by ANDREW EALES\n\nFind out more: ABOUT PIANODAO REVIEWS\n\nI have been a fan of Adrian Lord’s music since he sent me his Piano Meditations collection a couple of years ago, which I reviewed here. His follow up, Piano Postcards, impressed me still more, and has already proven popular with adult students.\n\nAlthough self-published, Lord’s music books are among the most luxuriant I have ever seen, and are an aesthetic delight in every sense, right down to the packaging he personally sends them in (which students and friends of mine have also commented on, so it’s not just me!).\n\nThe latest book to arrive in the usual metallic blue padded envelope, Elements is an anthology of ten pieces, bringing together the two easiest from each of Lord’s previous books and adding in two new compositions. The aim has been to produce an easier collection, accessible and suited to intermediate players.\n\nContinue reading Adrian Lord • Elements"
