        "text": "New Delhi:\n\nBorn in Antigua in the West Indies, Andy Roberts was one of the most prolific fast-bowlers of his time. The 6 feet 2 inches cricketer made his Test debut against England in 1974 and is currently in the news for claiming that the West Indies Cricket Board is clueless about the sport and the players.\n\nRead: Roberts suggests resignation from WICB president, CEO\n\nRoberts, along with Michael Holding, Joel Garner and Malcolm Marshall, was a potent force that contributed to the rise of West Indies in the sport in the 1970's. The use of dual-paced bouncers made him a force to reckon with as the batsman could never really judge the speed of the bouncers that Roberts bowled with accuracy.\n\nRoberts however was best known for being the first Antiguan to make it to the West Indies team and paved the way for many others like Viv Richards, Richie Richardson and Curtly Ambrose. His final Test match was against India in 1983 and has since been part of cricket off the field, actively.\n\nAs an administrator, he has prepared world-class pitches and has been very vocal about the falling standards of cricket in the Caribbean. His call for West Indies Cricket Board president Julian Hunte and his general critique of the board stems from the same concern."
