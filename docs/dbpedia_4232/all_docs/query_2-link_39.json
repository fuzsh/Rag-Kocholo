This play contains discussions of sex, consumption of alcoholic beverages, references to drug use, and profanity.\n\nDownload Program\n\nThese performances include post-show discussions featuring Baltimore Center Stage dramaturgy and artistic staff and visiting experts.\n\nMYLH in Baltimore: How can we support our immigrant communities?\n\nThe issues explored in Miss You Like Hell are not isolated to the stage or even to America's southern border. For this AfterThoughts, please join direct service providers from the Esperanza Center to learn about the work they do to support immigrant communities right here in Baltimore, and find out ways that you can contribute.\n\nThese performances include post-show discussions featuring Baltimore Center Stage dramaturgy and artistic staff and visiting experts.\n\nLove You Like Hell: Latinx Joy as resistance\n\nIn today's world, telling stories of love, joy, and healing in the face of oppressive structures is a radical act. This revolutionary joy flourishes onstage in Miss You Like Hell, and it exists throughout many other kinds of art-making in our community too. Join us in a conversation with Homie House Press' Adriana Monsalve, and other DMV-based art-makers and shakers engaging in these subversive acts of joy.\n\nThese performances include post-show discussions featuring Baltimore Center Stage dramaturgy and artistic staff and visiting experts.\n\nMore than Mexico: Expanding the immigration conversation\n\nMiss You Like Hell focuses on one particular story of immigration in America, but the whole story is much broader and much more complicated. Join us for a conversation about the intersecting experiences of folks from different immigrant communities as we begin to think about how these experiences diverge from each other, why some narratives get more attention than others, and where we might find opportunities for solidarity.\n\nBaltimore Center Stage: debut.
