Then in August 1967 - only days before his premature death - Cillaâs (and Beatlesâ) manager, Brian Epstein, engineered her switch to television with her own eponymous variety show. Here, Sir Cliff Richard celebrates the star as she made this move into presenting with the innovative and hugely successful BBC One series, Cilla.\n\nIt was a ground-breaking live TV series for Saturday nights. Light entertainment and reality elements were hosted with Cillaâs sense of humour, infectious personality and warm connection with big name guests and the public. With big opening and closing numbers and duets with music guests, it featured interviews, link-ups with the public in their own home using new technology, Vox Pops on the streets, comedy sketches plus, at one point, a fully scripted mini-play with Cilla taking a main role. Sir Paul McCartney even contacted Cilla to record a song, Step Inside Love, he composed specially for her to welcome audiences to each broadcast.\n\nGuests included Johnny Mathis, Andy Williams, Charles Aznavour, Tom Jones, Ringo Starr, Lulu, Sandie Shaw, Twiggy, Matt Monro, Sacha Distel, Dusty Springfield, Ethel Merman, The Shadows, The Wombles, Phil Everly, Marc Bolan and Ronnie Corbett. The showâs immediate success marked the beginning of a new phase of her professional life, making her one of Britainâs top-rated television entertainers. Regularly commanding audiences between 18 - 22 million, it ran for 66 shows across eight series until it ended in 1976. Decades later, ITV made Cilla the Queen of Saturday Night TV once again with Surprise Surprise and Blind Date.\n\nContributors include Jimmy Tarbuck, her son Robert Willis, Gillian Reynolds, Joe Brown, Sir Tim Rice, George Layton, Bob Harris, Tony Blackburn, Hank Marvin, Mike Batt, and arranger and musician Mike Vickers, bringing their memories and appreciation of Cillaâs talent, alongside archive clips and musical numbers from the seriesâ many unseen or heard since original transmission and believed lost. Sir Cliff was a close friend and appeared on her show many times, singing together and helping the country choose the Song For Europe.\n\nSir Cliff Richard says: âToo many people that we love pass on, but fortunately, people like Cilla leave behind something that will remain in our memories forever. For me, it was a joy and a pleasure and an honour to have known Cilla personally and be in close touch with her constantly. So Cilla, God bless you, rest in peace, and just remember we are going to be screaming about you forever.â\n\nRobert Willis, Cillaâs son, says: â60 years ago, my mother - Cilla Black - began her illustrious career in show business. She was a trailblazer for women in pop music and television. I am thrilled we are celebrating her milestone anniversary with Cilla at the BBC, narrated by my mother's dear friend Sir Cliff Richard. Many of you will fondly recall my mother's Saturday night variety show 'Cilla'. The new documentary reflects on this incredibly special time in her life when she made the transition from chart-topping pop singer to much-loved star of TV. These ground-breaking shows were top telly viewing watched by over 18 million viewers each week. I hope everyone enjoys this heart-warming trip down memory lane which will be broadcast this Christmas on BBC Radio 2. My sincere thanks to Sir Cliff and my motherâs friends who contributed to this very special tribute.â\n\nPresenter: Sir Cliff Richard\n\nProducer: Mark Simpson\n\nA BBC Audio production.\n\nKA\n\nTony Blackburnâs Sounds of Soul\n\nTuesday 26 December, 12-2pm\n\nIf youâre looking for a well needed antidote to all that Christmas Music then look no further.

Tapioca symbolises one of many puddings that came to Europe from âthe coloniesâ and was embraced and customised in the UK.\n\nTuesday: Summer Pudding\n\nSummer Pudding, the supposedly quintessentially English dessert (mixed berries encased in juice-soaked stale bread), began life as a symbol of health food for weight-conscious American women over a century ago. Itâs an invention from Victorian times, originally called âhydropathic puddingâ. Key ingredients: berries, sugar and stale bread. The changing variety of berries charts the growth of global trading and capitalism.\n\nWednesday: CrÃ¨me BrÃ»lÃ©e\n\nCrÃ¨me BrÃ»lÃ©e (meaning burnt cream) is a pudding thought of as a French creation (1697), but its surprising back story saw British food historians claim it was a creation by the chefs at Trinity College, Cambridge (founded in 1546), prompting French academics to then cite their version from the early 1500s. French aristocracyâs fervent embracing of CrÃ¨me BrÃ»lÃ©e as a wealth and status symbol put this pudding on the international map, but it was soon abandoned by the French post-Revolution.\n\nThursday: Pavlova\n\nPavlova is a much-disputed national symbol claimed by rival neighbours. A crisp meringue with whipped cream and fruit, it has become a source of pride and national identity for New Zealand and Australia, with both claiming its creation with disputed historical citations. For both, it is their Christmas dessert. But the pavlova actually symbolises the re-writing of historyâ¦\n\nFriday: Christmas Pudding\n\nChristmas pudding, a British icon. Initially seen as a medieval religious symbol, it now owes much of its modern prominence to Charles Dickens. Exported as Empire Pudding, it is loved by many around the Commonwealth.

Carols, it seemed, had failed the Victorian humour test and all but a few were driven out of churches. However, these carols have found a new home in pubs around Sheffield and South Yorkshire where the tradition has survived intact.\n\nAccording to international carol singing expert, the musicologist Dr Ian Russell, Professor Emeritus of the University of Aberdeen, the movement is proving increasingly popular, spreading across county lines to other parts of the UK and abroad. The tradition of carol composing is flourishing there too, with over thirty charted versions of While Shepherds Watched, as well as revivals of once lost examples.\n\nElizabeth Alker sets out in search of lost carols, a thriving and binding social phenomenon, speaking with Dr. Russell, local punters and folk musicians like Kate Rusby, one of a number of musicians who are enabling this hidden tradition to flourish.\n\nEC\n\nSara Mohr-Pietschâs Hygge Christmas\n\nSunday 24 December, 7pm â 9pm\n\nSara Mohr-Pietsch presents two hours of intimate, eclectic and beautiful festive music with a Scandinavian twist, evoking the famous Danish feeling of âhygge.â\n\nHer playlist includes tracks by Norwegian jazz pianist Bugge Wesseltoft, Swedish mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter, folk group Lodestar Trio, Norwegian trumpeter Tine Thing Helseth, Concerto Copenhagen and the Danish String Quartet.\n\nEC\n\nRadio 3 at Ronnieâs\n\nSunday 24 December, 9pm â 10.30pm\n\nGeorgia Mann visits Ronnie Scott's in London for an evening of the best Christmas jazz.

Fleming's personal life and impressive career in Naval Intelligence put him at the heart of critical movements in world history, whilst providing rich inspiration for his fiction.\n\nExceptionally well connected, and widely travelled, from the US and Soviet Russia to his beloved Jamaica, Ian had access to the most powerful political figures at a time of profound change. Nicholas Shakespeare's fascinating biography, with unprecedented access to the Fleming family papers, uncovers new material and throws new light on an extraordinary man. Ian Fleming would strive all his life to throw off the shadows of his gifted older brother, and be a complete man, but ultimately was then overshadowed by his own famous creation.\n\nAbridger - Rowan Routh\n\nProducer - Pauline Harris\n\nRB2\n\nWomanâs Hour\n\nMonday 25 December, 10am â 11am\n\nWe take a seasonal deep dive on the sprout to tell you why every woman needs them in her life.\n\nThe Britsâ love-hate relationship with the veg is well known, but did you know this humble member of the brassica family is in fact a veritable superfood that can bring health benefits to women?\n\nThe brussel sprout is rich in coumestrol, a type of phytonutrient that can help regulate the hormone estrogen.\n\nAnita Rani finds out how these mini cabbages came to our shores from Afghanistan via Belgium and how it became a Christmas day staple.\n\nWeâll be hearing from sprout farmers, pickers and scientists, not to mention getting some cooking tips from the nationâs favourite chefs, as well as listenersâ tips about how they like to eat theirs.\n\nAnd yes, it is true that they donât taste like they used to.
