        "text": "Thanks to Andrew Shaw for pointing me to a delightful edition of the Smith and Sniff podcast (this link starts at about 42:43, which is where the relevant portion begins) in which motoring journalist/broadcaster Richard Porter describes his recent experience meeting the Pet Shop Boys with fellow motoring enthusiast and PSB fan Jason Barlow. Porter was already in my list of celebrity fans of the Pet Shop Boys outside of music, but Barlow wasn't, so I've now added him. Thanks again, Andrew!\n\nEarlier today I received a delightful email from Marverine Cole, a British television news anchor and TV personality, with a great many programs and appearances to her credit. As a dedicated fan of the Pet Shop Boys, she wrote to express her fondness for my website, which pleased me greatly. Upon my request, she also gave me permission to include her in my list of celebrity PSB fans outside the field of music, to which I've now added her. Thanks so much, Marverine!\n\nThanks to John McFadden for letting me know that Olly Alexander recently performed \"The Loving Kind\" with the reformed Girls Aloud at Brighton Pride, a performance that you can see on YouTube. I've made note of this fact in the pre-existing entry for that song and Girls Aloud on my page devoted to Tennant-Lowe songs performed by other artists. Incidentally, as John reminded me, this is the third song composed entirely or in part by the Pet Shop Boys that Alexander has been known to perform, the other two being \"Dreamland\" (which he co-wrote) and \"It's a Sin.\"\n\nThanks to Andrew Shaw for clueing me in on the fact (with the requisite evidence) that actress Kate Beckinsale is a fan of the Pet Shop Boys. I've therefore added her to my list of celebrity PSB fans outside the field of music. Just the other day I added Pedro Pascal and Russell Tovey to that list as well, but I got distracted by something else and forgot to mention it here. The shared occasion that triggers all three of these additions is their enthusiastically self-documented attendance at the Boys' recent concerts at London's Royal Opera House.\n\nThanks to Catherine Walters for letting me know that \"What Have I Done to Deserve This?\" can be heard in Episode 3 of the new Netflix series The Decameron. I've now noted this fact in the entry for that song at #30 in my list of Pet Shop Boys songs that have been used in films and \"non-musical\" TV shows.\n\nThanks as well to Gary Beaven from Nottingham for telling me that \"Shopping\" is (perhaps ignorantly but predictably) being used in trailers for the U.K. TV series The High Street Shops We Loved and Lost. Since they're trailers, I'm citing this usage in my entry for the song at #2 in my list of PSB songs that have been used in TV commercials.\n\nThe Pet Shop Boys' website has just announced that they will be performing a special \"intimate\" one-night-only show at Funny Girls cabaret bar in Chris's hometown of Blackpool on Friday, September 6. Tickets go on sale this coming Thursday. I could be wrong, but this just might be the first time the Boys have ever performed at a venue best known for drag shows. Not that there's anything wrong with that. At any rate, I've updated my PSB Concert Tours page with this latest show.\n\nI've terminated my poll this past week on rating the tracks from Nonetheless and its associated singles, and I've posted the final results. I've also updated my overall Rating Project page so that you can see how these recent songs rank alongside all the other Pet Shop Boys tracks. Thanks so much to everyone who voted in this survey! I really appreciate it!\n\nThanks to Steve N. for sharing his observation that there appear to be a number of intriguing parallels between the PSB song \"Sense of Time\" and George Orwell's dystopian novel 1984. I've outlined a few of the best examples in a new final bullet-point annotation to my commentary on that song.\n\nAlso, several people have asked whether I plan to make any updates to my page devoted to \"Bullet for Narcissus\" in the wake of the attempted assassination of Donald Trump over the weekend. I did precisely that via a new first annotation to that song shortly after this even occurred; I just didn't feel right \"calling it out\" right away. I don't wish to go into any further detail about it.\n\nThanks to Lucia Rodriguez Agusti (whose name I've added to my Thank You page) for letting me know that there appears to have been a change in the color pattern configuration for Super in Apple Music. So I've modified my footnote on that subject to document the apparent fact that at least some of those patterns are subject to change.\n\nThanks to Jens Boldt for pointing out something Neil said on television recently about \"Dancing Star\" that inspires me (at Jens's suggestion) to change what I had already written about that song in my \"What it's about\" list. In short, I'm changing a more obvious \"about\" statement by Neil about that song to a more interesting one. And if you would like to see this television segment yourself, it's available on YouTube. (The pertinent statement is at about the 2:58 mark.)\n\nI think I've waited long enough to run a new \"Rating Project\" poll on Nonetheless and its singles. (If there are any additional single bonus tracks, I'll just another poll down the road for them.) So please take a minute or two to make your choices on my home page, assigning a rating of 0 to 10 to each Nonetheless track and its single bonus tracks as they compare to all other Pet Shop Boys songs. I'm looking forward to seeing and posting the final results about a week or so from now!\n\nThanks to David Wong for telling me about the 1989 song \"Manchester\" by the U.K. indie band The Times, which doesn't actually mention the Pet Shop Boys by name but comes teasingly close to doing so, clearly alluding to them several times. I've therefore noted it in the concluding \"honorable mentions\" section of my list of tracks that mention \"Pet Shop Boys.\"\n\nHappy Independence Day to my fellow Americans!\n\nThanks to Zazou2 (Laura C.A. Moloney-Kenny) for letting me know that the title line of \"What Have I Done to Deserve This?\"—not the Pet Shop Boys' original, but a sung-spoken \"quotation\" by a couple of characters—can be heard in a 2019 episode of the short-lived U.S. animated series Bless the Harts. I've now noted this in the entry for that song at #30 in my list of PSB songs that have been used in films and \"non-musical\" TV shows.\n\nThanks to Dave F for letting me know that \"Dancing Star\" has been used during television coverage of the Tour de France cycling race. I've therefore updated the song's entry at #106 in my list of PSB songs used in non-musical films and TV shows.\n\nAnd thanks to Nigel Brand for catching a typing error right here on this page, now corrected!\n\nThanks to Jarek Staszkowian for informing me that \"Domino Dancing\" is being used in new Lexus commercials on Polish television and radio. I've therefore created a new entry for this song at #13 in my list of Pet Shop Boys songs that have been used in TV commercials. And if you would like to see this commercial for yourself, it's available on YouTube.\n\nThanks to Dave F. for telling me that snippets of \"It's a Sin\" can be heard (\"stereotypically,\" as he rightly put it) toward the end of recent commercials promoting the upcoming documentary Adam Lambert: Out, Loud & Proud, set to debut June 19 on ITV1 in the U.K. I've noted this in the entry for that song at #11 in my list of Pet Shop Boys songs that have been used in television commercials.\n\nThanks to Milane F for suggesting that I add \"Being Boring\" to my list of PSB songs with \"extra lyrics\" by virtue of its \"New Version\" on the Furthermore bonus disc. Actually, Milane wasn't the first to propose this—Nigel Brand had done so a few weeks ago—but I was extremely busy and distracted at the time and set his recommendation aside, only to forget it. So thanks as well plus an apology to Nigel!\n\nThanks to Sebastian J.C. for raising a good point that has inspired me to slightly modify what I say in one of my strange but true incidents involving the Pet Shop Boys, specifically the one in which \"Pet Shop Boys\" is used as an insult on a TV show. Sebastian pointed out that since the television show in question is executive-produced by an openly gay man, any anti-gay slur would reflect more on the character than on the show's writers and creators.\n\nHaving had roughly six weeks to fully \"absorb\" it, I'm now prepared to assign Nonetheless its place in my list of the Pet Shop Boys' studio albums in descending order of how much I love them. Just a reminder—a low ranking doesn't mean I dislike the album; it only means I don't like or love it as much as the ones ranked above it. And one other thing: this list is not carved in stone. My opinions change over time, so Nonetheless may move up or down in the list. (To take a couple of specific examples, I now rank both Bilingual and Actually higher than I did when I first posted this list twenty-odd years ago.)\n\nThanks to Nigel Brand for reminding me that I'm incredibly overdue making necessary updates to my page devoted to \"Jack and Jill Party\" to reflect the death of Pete Burns in 2016. Although I've long been aware of his passing, the fact that what I had written about that song needed a few related adjustments slipped by me. That oversight is now rectified."
