        "text": "Andy is a degree educated engineer, musician and composer who joined Abbey Road Studios back in 1991 and has just celebrated 30 wonderful years (so far!) at the studio. He studied engineering at Spirit Studios in Manchester for many years recording various Factory Records bands in the late '80s.\n\nIn his pre-studio life, Andy was a classically trained musician and composer, but also the bass player in the feted 1990â€™s pop glam rock band The Trash Can Junkies who featured heavily (and humorously) in the critically acclaimed book Hell Bent for Leather by Seb Hunter, that was turned into a short comedy film starring Tim McInnery and cast.\n\nAndy is one of the world's foremost mastering and restoration engineers, with four Gramophone awards and two Grammy nominations to his name as well as numerous other accolades and awards. A pioneer of digital restoration processes and using state-of-the-art technology like CEDAR (much of which he helped in the process of early development), Andrew has applied his skills and knowledge to working on recordings as early as 1897 on 78 records to vinyl, tape, CD, DVD, SACD, Bluray and filmscores through to modern 7.1 surround sound audio restorations for classical, jazz, spoken word and all genres of pop music.\n\nAs a surround mastering engineer he has also worked on CD and DVD projects for some of the biggest names in the pop and rock world including numerous projects for David Bowie, Jimmy Page, Coldplay, Kylie Minogue, U2, The Cure, Robbie Williams, Radiohead, The Bee Gees, The Who, Simple Minds and The Beatles.

In the classical world he has worked exclusively on a series of recordings with the world famous cellist Mtislav Rostropovich and on a musical audio history of EMI Classics, the complete recordings of Maria Callas and The Centenary Box, for which he was Grammy-nominated.\n\nHe has recently worked with Snow Patrol and Kasabian on film projects, with the director Mel Brooks on the London cast CD soundtrack of The Young Frankenstein and with the composer on the 2018 filmscore release of Yardie and film The Bees, where the audio for the first time has been mastered â€˜pre film editâ€™. He was delighted to complete a 5.1 mix of the classic album Hemispheres by Rush in its 40th anniversary edition, as well as mastering all the surround streams for SACDs of every Rush album ever recorded, as this is a band he loves.\n\nAndy is a world expert in audio restoration and also forensic restoration work and has worked with the British police, the UK government as well as business clients as a respected engineer in cleaning up audio for legal and private investigations. He regularly gives expert lectures to industry groups around the world namely in the USA, Hong Kong, Berlin and the UK, talking about audio restoration, the mastering process and the state of the art restoration technologies involved, for which Abbey Road is a pioneering alumni.
