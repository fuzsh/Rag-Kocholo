        "text": "Blog Archives\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber\n\nSir Andrew Lloyd Webber has written some of the most commercially successful musicals of the last quarter of the 20th century. Among his most popular shows are “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat” (1967), “Jesus Christ Superstar” (1971), “Evita” (1974), “Cats” (1981), “The Phantom of the Opera” (1986), and “Sunset Boulevard” (1993). Lloyd Webber’s gift for melody has spawned such classic musical theater songs as “Memory” and “Music of the Night.”\n\nLloyd Webber was born in London on March 22, 1948. His father was a faculty member at the Royal College of Music and his mother was a piano teacher. Andrew showed musical aptitude at a very young age, and, while still a youth, composed short musical entertainments for his family.\n\nHis first musical was “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat” (1967). With lyricist Tim Rice, Lloyd Webber created an eclectic score to accompany the Old Testament story of Joseph and his brothers. Musical numbers ranged in style from Elvis-style rock to calypso and soft rock ballads. Joseph’s two big songs, “Any Dream Will Do” and “Close Every Door,” became hit singles.\n\n“Jesus Christ Superstar” (1971), another collaboration with Rice, began life as a double album. Concert tours of the “rock opera” followed, and ultimately, a stage version emerged. “Superstar,” the story of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ as seen through the eyes of Pontius Pilate, garnered seven Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Score. Mary Magdalene’s song “I Don’t Know How to Love Him” became a pop standard. The 1973 film version starred Ted Neeley and Carl Anderson.\n\n“Evita” (1974), based on the life of Eva Peron, also began as a concept album. Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin starred in the Broadway version. The show received numerous Tony Awards, including Best Actress (LuPone). For the 1996 film which starred Madonna and Antonio Banderas, Lloyd Webber wrote a new song, “You Must Love Me.” The song earned an Academy Award for the composer.\n\n“Cats” (1981), based on T. S. Eliot’s Old Possum’s Book of Practical “Cats,” is Lloyd Webber’s longest-running show in both London’s West End and on Broadway. … Like “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,” “Cats” contains songs written in a variety of musical styles. “Memory,” the show’s climactic number, is a sentimental ballad, which has been championed by singers Elaine Paige and Barbra Streisand, among others.\n\n“Song and Dance” (1982) consisted of two parts: “Tell Me on a Sunday,” a one-woman show, and “Variations,” a set of variations on Paganini’s famous caprice for cello and rock band. Variations was written for Andrew’s cello-playing brother Julian.\n\n“Starlight Express” (1984), a train epic with music, followed. The cast of the high-tech fantasy dash around the ramp-enhanced theater on roller skates. Rock, blues, and country elements are apparent in the amplified score. A 90-minute version of “Starlight Express” opened in 1993 at the Las Vegas Hilton, the first major legitimate stage production to play in the famed gambling city.\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber\n\nKey Shows\n\nv\"Bombay Dreams\"\n\n\"Cats\"\n\n\"Evita\"\n\n\"Jesus Christ Superstar\"\n\n\"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\"\n\n\"The Phantom of the Opera\"\n\n\"Starlight Express\"\n\n\"Sunset Boulevard\"\n\nRelated Artists\n\nPatti LuPone\n\nCameron Mackintosh\n\nTrevor Nunn\n\nMandy Patinkin\n\nHarold Prince\n\nTim Rice\n\nBen Vereen\n\nRobin Wagner\n\n“The Phantom of the Opera” (1986) is perhaps Lloyd Webber’s best-known work. Based on Gaston Leroux’s novel, the musical included the songs “Music of the Night,” “All I Ask of You,” “The Phantom of the Opera,” and “Think of Me.” Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, then Lloyd Webber’s wife, starred in the original production. “Phantom” is indicative of a trend in the late 1980s toward a “sung-through” musical — one in which spoken dialogue is limited and often replaced by operatic recitative (speech-singing). The lavish sets, impressive special effects, and hauntingly beautiful musical score have made the show one of the most popular musicals worldwide.\n\nHis first musical was “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.\n\n“Aspects of Love” (1989) launched the career of its male lead, Michael Ball. The sung-through musical was an adaptation of David Garnett’s tale of intergenerational love and included the ballad “Love Changes Everything.” The show played for over three years in London, but its 1990 Broadway run lasted only 377 performances.\n\n“Sunset Boulevard” (1993), based on the film of the same name, included some spectacularly romantic music. Two songs, “With One Look” and “As if We Never Said Goodbye,” both of which are sung by the lead character Norma Desmond, have entered the repertories of singers as diverse as Kiri TeKenawa and Barbra Streisand. As with “The Phantom of the Opera,” “Sunset Boulevard” includes elaborate and impressive sets. John Napier’s grandiose staircase is as much a character in the musical as are any of the humans. The London production starred Patti LuPone, while the Los Angeles and New York productions featured Glenn Close. Betty Buckley succeeded both LuPone and Close in their respective runs.\n\n“Whistle Down the Wind” (1998), inspired by the film of the same name, is set in Louisiana in 1959. A collaboration with Jim Steinman, the score includes typically romantic love songs and explosive rock music. In addition to his musical theater works, Lloyd Webber has also written concert works. “Variations” also exists in a version for cello and orchestra. “Requiem” (1985), written for Lloyd Webber’s father, included the memorable duet “Pie Jesu.”\n\nWith his impressive array of commercially and artistically successful shows, Lloyd Webber is one of the most important composers for the musical theater in the last decades of the 20th century. Both his innate gift for melody and his ability to create music, which live up to the dazzling special effects characteristic of so many of his shows, have contributed immensely to his worldwide success.\n\nSource: Excerpted from ST.

By the mid-’20s he had established a reputation as a leading composer in the modern idiom. He was eager to make opera a popular form, accessible to the widest audience, and was also politically aware, wanting his work to have social significance. In collaboration with Bertolt Brecht he composed “Little Mahagonny” (later expanded to become “The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny”) and then achieved success with “The Threepenny Opera” (1928). Although a massive hit in Germany, the show failed in the USA in 1933, but was well received when it was revived in 1954-55. It has since been continually restaged all over the world. The show’s best-known song, “Mack the Knife,” became a standard in the repertoires of numerous singers. Weill and his wife, singer Lotte Lenya, emigrated to the USA in 1935. En route, he spent some time in England, working with Desmond Carter and Reginald Arkell on the musical satire, “A Kingdom for a Cow,” which was presented at the Savoy Theatre.\n\nOn arriving in the USA, he formed a working association with Group Theater, the influential left-wing drama company that was home to such rising talents as Lee J. Cobb, John Garfield, Clifford Odet, Frances Farmer, and Elia Kazan. He also wrote scores for the theater, including “Johnny Johnson” (1936, with Paul Green), “The Eternal Road” (1937, Franz Werfel), and “Knickerbocker Holiday” (1938, with Maxwell Anderson). The last show starred the nonsinging actor Walter Huston, but ironically his version of “September Song” proved to one of the most memorable and enduring moments in popular music. In 1941 Weill collaborated with Ira Gershwin (lyrics) and Moss Hart (book) for “Lady in the Dark,” which starred Gertrude Lawrence, and featured “My Ship,” “The Saga of Jenny,” and “One Life to Live.” Two years later came “One Touch of Venus” (Ogden Nash and S.J. Perelman), in which the lovely “Speak Low” was introduced by Mary Martin and Kenny Baker. This was followed by “The Firebrand of Florence” (1945, Ira Gershwin and Edwin Justus Mayer), “Street Scene” (1947, Langston Hughes and Elmer Rice), “Down in the Valley” (1948, a 20-minute folk opera for radio), “Love Life” (1948, Alan Jay Lerner), and “Lost in the Stars” (1949, Anderson).\n\nKurt Weill\n\nKey Shows\n\n\"Happy End\"\n\n\"Lady in the Dark\"\n\n\"Lost in the Stars\"\n\n\"One Touch of Venus\"\n\n\"Street Scene\"\n\nRelated Artists\n\nIra Gershwin\n\nMoss Hart\n\nMary Martin\n\nWeill and his wife, singer Lotte Lenya, emigrated to the USA in 1935.\n\nWeill was working on “Huckleberry Finn,” an adaptation of Mark Twain’s celebrated novel, when he died in 1950. In 1995, a new production of “The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny” was presented by the English National Opera at the Coliseum in London. In the following year Weill and Lerner’s 1948 “Love Life” received its “first production outside the USA for 48 years.” The show’s European premiere took place at the Grand Theatre Leeds. In 1999, Weill’s “Der Silbersee” (The Silverlake) was presented by the Broomhill Opera at the new refurbished Wilton’s Music Hall in London in a translation by the popular UK impressionist Rory Bremner. Also in 1999, the opera “He Who Says Yes/He Who Says No,” by Weill and Brecht, was presented Off-Off Broadway.\n\nFURTHER READING:\n\nTHE DAYS GROW SHORT: THE LIFE AND MUSIC OF KURT WEILL, Ronald Saunders.\n\nKURT WEILL: COMPOSER IN A DIVIDED WORLD, Ronald Taylor.\n\nSPEAK LOW (WHEN YOU SPEAK LOVE): THE LETTERS OF KURT WEILL AND LOTTE LENYA, Lys Symonette and Kim Kowalke, eds.\n\nSource: Biographical information provided by MUZE. Excerpted from the ENCYCLOPEDIA OF POPULAR MUSIC, edited by Colin Larkin. © 2004 MUZE UK Ltd.\n\nPhoto credits: Photofest\n\nJule Styne\n\nBrilliant, prolific tunesmith who, over the course of a nearly 75-year long career, composed 2,000 songs, published 1,500 of them, and had somewhere around 200 of them become enormous hits or later song standards.\n\nJule (pronounced JOO-lee) Styne was playing solo piano with the Chicago Symphony at age eight, worked during the Jazz Age in bands, which also featured the up-and-coming likes of Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, and Charlie Spivak, and entered films in the 1930s as an arranger and vocal coach for Alice Faye and Shirley Temple at 20th Century-Fox. Styne next worked for Republic Pictures on melodies for various B musicals, and in the early ’40s began his famous, though never exclusive, partnership with lyricist Sammy Cahn. Some of Styne and Cahn’s biggest hits during the ’40s and ’50s were sumptuous romantic ballads, many of which Frank Sinatra helped propel to the top of the weekly Hit Parade. One example was the lovely “I Fall in Love Too Easily” from the film ANCHORS AWEIGH (1945), while another, the lush title song from the feature THREE COINS IN THE FOUNTAIN, also won an Oscar as Best Song in 1954.\n\nThe early Styne songs, full of wartime longing and nostalgia, often seem atypically softer and gentler than his later sharp, showbizzy Broadway anthems like “Everything’s Coming Up Roses” and “Let Me Entertain You” from “Gypsy” (1959), or “Don’t Rain on My Parade” from “Funny Girl” (1964). Even a later ballad like “People” (from “Funny Girl”), which became a song standard for Barbra Streisand, has more brass than, say, “It’s Magic,” a rich number from the film ROMANCE ON THE HIGH SEAS (1948), which became another signature tune for an equally feisty song stylist, Doris Day. Still, the sense of rhythmic and melodic flow remained a constant, as did the craftsmanship of a song’s syncopation and drive as well as the sensitivity to lyrics and emotion. If Styne often did not have the star clout on Broadway in the ’50s that Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin, and Cole Porter did a generation earlier, it was partly because, as he himself realized, “I am the greatest collaborator there is,” often letting a show’s star or a musical’s lyricist set much of the tone for his work.\n\nAlthough Styne wrote a number of classic songs especially for film, including “(It Seems to Me) I’ve Heard that Song Before” from “Youth on Parade” (1942) and “I’ll Walk Alone” from TONIGHT AND EVERY NIGHT (1945) and lent his talent for infectious, buoyant melodies to such film scores as ANCHORS AWEIGH (1945), THE KID FROM BROOKLYN (1946), and IT HAPPENED IN BROOKLYN (1947), he preferred writing for the stage. He first took a crack at writing a full Broadway score with “High Button Shoes” (1947) — the result, with choreography by Jerome Robbins, was a Broadway landmark. His encore triumph came in collaboration with snappy, witty lyricist Leo Robin, “Gentleman Prefer Blondes” (1949), which gave Carol Channing an enduring theme song with the delicious “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend.”\n\nJule Styne\n\nKey Shows\n\n\"Bells Are Ringing\"\n\n\"Do Re Mi\"\n\n\"Funny Girl\"\n\n\"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\"\n\n\"Gypsy\"\n\n\"Hallelujah, Baby!\"\n\n\"Peter Pan\"\n\n\"Sugar\"\n\nRelated Artists\n\nCarol Channing\n\nMarvin Hamlisch\n\nAngela Lansbury\n\nArthur Laurents\n\nMary Martin\n\nDavid Merrick\n\nCole Porter\n\nChita Rivera\n\nJerome Robbins\n\nStephen Sondheim\n\nBarbra Streisand\n\nElaine Stritch\n\nHe first took a crack at writing a full Broadway score with “High Button Shoes.”\n\nStyne would collaborate with Robin on the bright score for the Betty Grable film MEET ME AFTER THE SHOW (1951) and the less successful feature remake MY SISTER EILEEN (1955) and would create tunes with Cahn for THE WEST POINT STORY (1950), but around mid-decade he firmly decided to commit his songwriting energies to Broadway rather than to film. His work with Cahn came to an end as a result, but a recurring collaboration with the playful, inventive duo of Betty Comden and Adolph Green began with a revue “Two on the Aisle” (1951) and would later include the charming “Bells Are Ringing” (1956). Through the late ’60s, Styne’s genius for writing slam-bang Broadway hits for strong leading women came to the fore; one not only links Channing with “Gentleman” and Streisand with “Funny Girl,” but also Judy Holliday with “Bells,” Mary Martin with “Peter Pan” (1954), featuring the famous “Never Never Land”) and Ethel Merman with “Gypsy” (1959), which includes the powerhouse anthem “Rose’s Turn.”\n\nAlthough Styne always felt he had more creative freedom on Broadway, most of his major musicals were eventually adapted for the big screen. Beginning in 1957 with a musicalization of RUGGLES OF RED GAP, he also began writing (and later producing) TV musical programs as well. The ’60s had its leaner moments (“Do Re Mi,” “Subways Are for Sleeping,” both 1960 Broadway shows), but, besides “Funny Girl,” this era also saw Styne finally win Tony Awards for his high energy “Hallelujah, Baby!” (1967). He continued with shows like “Sugar” (1972) and “Lorelei” (1974) and created tunes for the Broadway musical rendition of “The Red Shoes” (1993) less than two years before he died.\n\nA stocky, feisty man much loved in showbiz circles for his sputtered, incomplete sentences, his wit, adaptability and showmanship, Styne was a lively interview subject and sometime performer up until the end. The creator of songs ranging from the joyous “Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!” and “Make Someone Happy” to the heartbreaking melancholy of “Guess I’ll Hang My Tears Out to Dry” to the triumph of “Just in Time” received many deserved honors before his death at age 88.\n\nSource: Excerpted from Baseline.

When Strouse graduated from the Eastman School of Music he intended to make a career in the classical field, and studied for a time with Aaron Copland. After meeting lyricist Lee Adams in 1949 he changed course, and during the early ’50s they contributed songs to revues at the popular Green Mansions summer resort, and in 1956 they had some numbers interpolated into the Off-Broadway shows “The Littlest Revue” and “Shoestring ’57.” Their big break came in 1960 with “Bye Bye Birdie,” which is often cited as the first musical to acknowledge the existence of rock ‘n’ roll. It starred Dick Van Dyke and Chita Rivera and ran for 607 performances. The witty and tuneful score included “Kids!”, “A Lot of Livin’ to Do,” and “‘Put on a Happy Face.” Ironically, two years earlier, Strouse, with Fred Tobias, had written a bona fide rock ‘n’ roll hit, “Born Too Late,” which the Poni-Tails took to number 7 on the U.S. chart. As for Strouse and Adams’ shows, “All American” (1962), a musical about college football, failed to score heavily, but “Golden Boy” (1964) lasted for 569 performances on the sheer strength of Sammy Davis Jr.’s appeal. “It’s a Bird, It’s a Plane, It’s Superman” (1966), which was based on the syndicated comic strip, came down to earth with a bump after only 129 performances.\n\nIt was four years before Strouse and Adams took off again with “Applause,” their second big hit, which ran for over two years, and, like “Golden Boy,” had a gilt-edged box office star in Lauren Bacall. In 1971 Strouse wrote his own lyrics for “Six” — which ran for eight — performances, that is, Off Broadway. The composer collaborated once again with Adams for “I and Albert” in 1972 — presented in London only — but audiences there were definitely not amused. Strouse’s hit of a lifetime came five years later — but not in collaboration with Lee Adams. Martin Charnin provided the lyrics for another Strouse show that was based, like “It’s a Bird, It’s a Plane,” on a comic strip — in this case, “Little Orphan Annie.” Together with librettist Thomas Meehan they turned it into “Annie” (1977), the hottest Broadway ticket of the ’70s, which ran for 2,377 performances. Since then, Strouse has had a string of flops — and some real beauties at that: “A Broadway Musical” (one performance), “Flowers for Algernon” (London 28 performances) — adapted for New York as “Charley and Algernon” (17), “Bring Back Birdie” (four), “Dance a Little Closer” (one), “Mayor” (268, but still a failure), “Rags” (four), “Lyle” (did not reach Broadway), “Annie 2,” the follow-up to his megahit (closed in Washington), and “Nick & Nora” (nine). In 1991, the 1986 disaster, “Rags” — which has a truly delectable score — was revived Off Broadway, and two years later a scaled-down version of “Annie 2,” retitled “Annie Warbucks,” was also presented there.\n\nCharles Strouse\n\nKey Shows\n\n\"Annie\"\n\n\"All American\"\n\n\"Applause\"\n\n\"Bring Back Birdie\"\n\n\"Bye Bye Birdie\"\n\n\"Golden Boy\"\n\n\"Mayor\"\n\n\"Rags\"\n\nRelated Artists\n\nLee Adams\n\nComden and Green\n\nGower Champion\n\nArthur Laurents\n\nJoshua Logan\n\nChita Rivera\n\nStephen Schwartz\n\nIt was four years before Strouse and Adams took off again with “Applause,” their second big hit.\n\nDuring the remainder of the ’90s Strouse hosted “An Evening with Charles Strouse” in the renowned “Lyrics and Lyricists” series and at “Lincoln Center, as well as working on a variety of projects reported to include a musical adaptation of Theodore Dreiser’s 1924 novel, AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY (with Adams) and a new musical based on the film comedy, THE NIGHT THEY RAIDED MINSKY’S (with Susan Birkenhead). There were also several projects honoring his previous works, such as the revues “Simply Strouse” at New York’s Rainbow & Stars (1996) and Barbara Siman’s “A Lot of Living!” at London’s Jermyn Street Theatre (August 1997), with Dave Willetts, Bonnie Langford, Joanna John, and Chris Coleman. Cabaret performer Jason Graae also released a “sensational” collection of Strouse’s songs on YOU’RE NEVER FULLY DRESSED WITHOUT A SMILE. His career honors have included three Tony Awards for his work on “Bye Bye Birdie,” “Applause,” and “Annie,” a Grammy for the “Annie” original cast album, and an Emmy for the song “Let’s Settle Down” (with Adams) from the 1996 television version of “Bye Bye Birdie.” Strouse has also composed several operas, a piano concerto, various chamber music, and several film scores, including BONNIE AND CLYDE (1967), THE NIGHT THEY RAIDED MINSKY’S (1968), THERE WAS A CROOKED MAN (1970), JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT (1980), and ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN (1989). The concerto for piano and orchestra, which he wrote when he was in his twenties, finally received its world premiere in October 1995 when Barbara Irvine played it with the Maryland Symphony Orchestra. In 1998, the piece was included in a program called “The Other Side of Broadway,” in which Irvine also previewed works by Harvey Schmidt (“The Fantasticks”) and David Shire (“Big”).\n\nSource: Biographical information provided by MUZE.

The son of a schoolteacher turned motion picture producer, Stone was raised in L.A., and after heading east for schooling, began his career in live TV. He went on to script such well-received motion pictures as CHARADE (1963) and FATHER GOOSE (1964, for which he won an Academy Award) and has provided the book for several Broadway musicals, notably “1776” (1969) and “Woman of the Year” (1981).\n\nStone’s theatrical work began in 1958 when his play, “Friend of the Family,” was produced in St. Louis. By 1961, he had written the book for the unsuccessful Broadway musical “Kean.” His second venture, “Skyscraper” (1965), also didn’t fare well at the box office. His first real success was “1776,” an unlikely but powerful musical about the creation and signing of the Declaration of Independence. Winning the Tony as Best Musical, it had a healthy run on Broadway and was a modest success in London. Stone adapted Clifford Odets’ “The Flowering Peach,” about Noah and the ark, as a musical vehicle for Danny Kaye, with a score by Richard Rodgers. He later adapted the classic 1959 Billy Wilder film SOME LIKE IT HOT as “Sugar” (1972), which earned mixed reviews, and turned the 1942 Tracy-Hepburn comedy WOMAN OF THE YEAR into a 1981 star vehicle for Lauren Bacall. His polish of the book for “My One and Only” (1983) helped solidify Tommy Tune’s reputation, and Stone reportedly did uncredited work on Tune’s staging of “Grand Hotel” in 1990. He and Tune again collaborated on the award-winning “The Will Rogers Follies” in 1992, and Stone wrote the poorly reviewed “Titanic” in 1997.\n\nPeter Stone\n\nKey Shows\n\n\"My One and Only\"\n\n\"1776\"\n\n\"Sugar\"\n\n\"Titanic\"\n\n\"Two by Two\"\n\n\"The Will Rodgers Follies\"\n\n\"Woman of the Year\"\n\nRelated Artists\n\nKander and Ebb\n\nJoshua Logan\n\nDavid Merrick\n\nBrian Stokes Mitchell\n\nRobert Morse\n\nBernadette Peters\n\nRichard Rodgers\n\nJule Styne\n\nTommy Tune\n\nTony Walton\n\nHis first real success was “1776.”\n\nIn motion pictures, Stone was a success almost immediately. His first produced screenplay, CHARADE (1963), which he also novelized, was a mystery with romance that paired Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. It offered more twists, turns, and surprises than one might think a movie could hold as a bevy of unsavory characters try to discover where Hepburn’s deceased husband hid $250,000. Oddly, Stone won the Academy Award for his next screenplay, FATHER GOOSE, again starring Grant as a beach bum turned lookout for the Australians during World War II who doubles as a guardian of schoolgirls. Although the 1964 film was well received, it garnered neither the critical acclaim of CHARADE nor the box office success. Stone continued to excel at adaptations, with the musical SWEET CHARITY (1969) and THE TAKING OF PELHAM 1-2-3 (1980), based on the mystery novel about a nefarious gang who hijack a subway train. Later came WHY WOULD I LIE? (1980), which put Treat Williams as a social worker trying to unite a youth with his ex-con mother. Stone took a long sojourn from the big screen until JUST CAUSE (1995), which starred Sean Connery as a famed law professor trying to prove Blair Underwood innocent of a crime for which he was convicted.\n\nThe writer’s small-screen work dates back to an episode of STUDIO ONE (CBS, 1956), and also includes episodes of THE DEFENDERS (CBS, 1961-62). Stone was involved in the creation of the TV adaptation of ADAM’S RIB (ABC, 1973-74), a sitcom based on the 1949 Tracy-Hepburn classic, and IVAN THE TERRIBLE (CBS, 1976), a short-lived but witty series with Lou Jacobi as the head of an extended Moscow. Stone also adapted George Bernard Shaw’s ANDROCLES AND THE LION (NBC, 1968) and penned GRAND LARCENY, a 1989 syndicated TV movie about a female master thief. Stone has also appeared on talk shows and retrospectives, and was a frequent panelist on the PBS show THE WEEK IN REVIEW.\n\nSource: Excerpted from Baseline.

He continued to be a major force in the shaping of this genre into the 1980s.\n\nAmerican composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim is mainly known for his stage works, which include “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum” (1962); “Anyone Can Whistle” (1964); “Company” (1970); “Follies” (1971); and “A Little Night Music” (1973). He is known for his collaborations with Leonard Bernstein as lyricist for “West Side Story” (1957) and “Candide” (1974), and with Richard Rogers on “Do I Hear a Waltz” (1965). Sondheim’s partnership with the director/producer Hal Prince resulted in Tony Awards for Best Musical Scores for three consecutive years (1971-1973), and “Pacific Overtures” (1976) was hailed as a landmark in American musical theater because of its masterful use of traditional Japanese theater elements. In 1984, Sondheim paired himself with James Lapine to put together “Sunday in the Park with George,” a musical inspired by a Georges Seurat painting.\n\nSondheim was born into a prosperous business family on March 22, 1930. He studied piano for two years while very young and continued his interest in the musical stage throughout his education. Sondheim’s parents divorced in 1942 and his mother took up residence in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, close to the summertime residence of Oscar Hammerstein II. As a friend of Hammerstein’s son, Sondheim was able to ask the famous librettist for an evaluation of his first stage work, a high school production produced at the age of 15. Hammerstein’s critical evaluation of “By George” initiated a four-year relationship that was decisive in formulating the young artist’s style. As Hammerstein’s personal assistant, Sondheim gained entry into the world of professional theater.\n\nWhile attending Williams College he performed duties in the preparation and rehearsals of the Rogers and Hammerstein productions of “South Pacific” and “The King and I.” Upon graduation he won the Hutchinson Prize, which enabled him to study composition at Princeton University with Milton Babbitt.\n\nSondheim began his professional career in television by writing scripts for the TOPPER and THE LAST WORD series and incidental music for the Broadway musical “Girls of Summer.” Shortly thereafter he made the acquaintance of Arthur Laurents, who introduced him to Jerome Robbins and Leonard Bernstein as the possible lyricist for “West Side Story,” which was produced in 1957. The young songwriter found himself involved in one of the most successful shows ever produced on Broadway. Sondheim followed this success by collaborating on the Broadway production of “Gypsy” in 1959, distinguishing himself as one of the great young talents in American musical theater.\n\nIntent on broadening his talents, Sondheim sought productions where he could use his musical as well as lyrical expertise. He produced “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum” in 1962 … a bawdy farce based on the plays of Plautus. The show had an impressive run of almost 1,000 performances, won the Tony Award for Best Musical, and was made into a successful film in 1966.\n\nSondheim followed with two less successful ventures: “Anyone Can Whistle” (1964) and “Do I Hear a Waltz” (1965). Although both failed commercially, Sondheim contributed songs of high quality.\n\nIn 1970 Sondheim produced “Company,” which once again won him unanimous praise from the critics. The production was awarded the Drama Critics and Tony Awards for Best Musical of the season, and Sondheim received awards for the best composer and best lyricist. One critic commented that “Company” “is absolutely first rate … the freshest … in years … This is a wonderful musical score, the one that Broadway has long needed. …” The following year Sondheim produced “Follies,” a retrospective of the “Ziegfield Follies,” in which the composer blended the nostalgia of popular songs of the past with his own style of sentimental ballad. He was awarded both the Drama Critics and Outer Critics Circle Awards for Best Musical of 1971.\n\nIn “A Little Night Music” (1973) Sondheim exposed his strong background in classical music. It was described by critics as reminiscent of Mahler, Strauss, Ravel, Liszt, and Rachmaninoff. Another Tony Award winner, “A Little Night Music” also included his first commercial hit song, “Send in the Clowns.”\n\nNoteworthy as a relentless innovator, Sondheim collaborated with Hal Prince on “Pacific Overtures” (1976). In an attempt to relate the westernization of Japan with the commercialized present, Sondheim fused the unlikely elements of Haiku poetry, Japanese pentatonic scales, and Kabuki theater with contemporary stage techniques in a production that was hailed as a successful Broadway hit. He followed this with “Sweeney Todd” (1979), the melodramatic story of the demon barber of Fleet Street who conspired with the neighborhood baker to supply her with sufficient barbershop victims for her meat pies. Less funny than tragic, “Sweeney Todd” explored the dark side of the 19th-century English social system.\n\nSondheim’s talent derived from his ability to cross genres of music and theater to offer Broadway audiences works of remarkable craft on unexpected subjects that challenged and tested the form of the American musical. Sondheim explored issues of contemporary life; marriage and relationships in “Company”; madness and the human condition in “Anyone Can Whistle”; nostalgia and sentiment in “Follies”; Western imperialism in “Pacific Overtures”; and injustice and revenge in “Sweeney Todd.”\n\nStephen Sondheim\n\nKey Shows\n\n\"Assassins\"\n\n\"Candide\"\n\n\"Company\"\n\n\"Follies\"\n\n\"A Funny Thing Happended on the Way to the Forum\"\n\n\"Gypsy\"\n\n\"Into the Woods\"\n\n\"A Little Night Music\"\n\n\"Merrily We Roll Along\"\n\n\"Pacific Overtures\"\n\n\"Passion\"\n\n\"Sunday in the Park with George\"\n\n\"Sweeney Todd\"\n\n\"West Side Story\"\n\nRelated Artists\n\nBoris Aronson\n\nMichael Bennett\n\nLeonard Bernstein\n\nOscar Hammerstein II\n\nNathan Lane\n\nAngela Lansbury\n\nJames Lapine\n\nArthur Laurents\n\nEthel Merman\n\nDavid Merrick\n\nZero Mostel\n\nMandy Patinkin\n\nHarold Prince\n\nBernadette Peters\n\nChita Rivera\n\nJerome Robbins\n\nJule Styne\n\nSondheim avoided filler in his lyrics and concentrated on direct impact through verbal interplay. His lyrics were witty without his ever sacrificing integrity for superficially clever rhyme. Similarly, he maintained his musical individuality even while operating in the adopted Eastern musical style of “Pacific Overtures.” Sondheim’s consistent ability to merge words and music that hint at the deeper personality beneath the prototype character distinguished him as a composer of rare ingenuity and talent.\n\n“Side by Side by Sondheim,” a musical tribute to the artist, was successfully produced in 1976. Sondheim’s later works included the film score for REDS (1981) and “Sunday in the Park with George” (1984), which won a 1985 Pulitzer Prize. “Into the Woods” was another musical hit on Broadway in 1987.\n\nSondheim participated on the council of the Dramatists Guild and served as its president from 1973 to 1981. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1983. He won the 1990 Academy Award for Best Original Song for “Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man)” from the movie DICK TRACY.\n\nSondheim composed the music for the ABC television presentation TIME WARNER PRESENTS THE EARTH DAY SPECIAL (1990). In 1992, he declined a National Medal of Arts Award, from the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nOn July 4, 2000, Sondheim was given the Praemium Imperiale award by the Japan Art Association. He was honored for his work in film and theater.\n\nSource: Excerpted from ENCYCLOPEDIA OF WORLD BIOGRAPHY, 2ND ED. 17 VOLS., Gale Research, © 1998 Gale Research.

However, his talents as a songwriter gradually drew him to Broadway where, in collaboration with Eubie Blake, he achieved a major breakthrough. Before Sissle and Blake, it was rare for a black entertainer to gain acceptance along the “Great White Way,” but the success of their 1921 show, “Shuffle Along,” changed all that. “Shuffle Along” starred Florence Mills, and among its memorable tunes were “In Honeysuckle Time,” “Love Will Find a Way,” and the hit of the show, “I’m Just Wild About Harry.”\n\nNoble Sissle\n\nKey Shows\n\n\"The Chocolate Dandies\"\n\n\"Elsie\"\n\n\"Harlem Cavalcade\"\n\n\"Shuffle Along\"\n\nRelated Artists\n\nEubie Blake\n\nGeorge Gershwin\n\nGeorge White\n\nIn this and succeeding shows, such as “Chocolate Dandies,” the collaborators presented a succession of songs, dances, and sketches that were attuned to the new musical sounds of the day — unlike most other Broadway shows, which, also performed by all-black casts, had ignored ragtime and the emergence of jazz. In these and later years Sissle led a number of fine orchestras that featured some of the best musicians available, among them Sidney Bechet, Otto “Toby” Hardwicke, Tommy Ladnier, and Buster Bailey. In the late ’20s Sissle led a band in Paris and London and during the ’30s led successful bands in New York and elsewhere in the USA. He continued touring during the ’40s and ’50s but gradually directed his attention to music publishing.\n\nFURTHER READING:\n\nREMINISCING WITH NOBLE SISSLE AND EUBIE BLAKE, Robert Kimball and William Bolcom.\n\nSource: Biographical information provided by MUZE.

He worked as a record producer for RCA Records before deciding to make a career as a songwriter. In 1969 he contributed the title song to Leonard Gershe’s play “Butterflies Are Free,” which ran on Broadway for more than 1,000 performances, and was filmed in 1972. In 1971, Schwartz had a smash hit with his rock-pop score for the off-Broadway “biblical” musical “Godspell,” which ran for over 2,500 performances in New York, and featured the hit song “Day by Day.” He also produced the Grammy-winning original cast album. Later that year, Schwartz collaborated with Leonard Bernstein on additional text for Bernstein’s “‘theater piece,” “Mass,” which was commissioned for the opening of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. During the early ’70s, Schwartz enjoyed more success with “Pippin” (1972), which had another agreeable song, “Magic Do,” and “The Magic Show” (1974). Each show ran for nearly five years in New York. Subsequently, he seemed to lose the magic formula. “The Baker’s Wife” (1976) closed out of town although it has since become something of a cult item, and “Working” (1978), “Rags” (1986), and “Children of Eden” (London 1991), could only manage 132 performances between them.\n\nHe contributed the title song to Leonard Gershe’s play “Butterflies Are Free.”\n\nStephen Schwartz\n\nKey Shows\n\n\"Fosse\"\n\n\"Godspell\"\n\n\"Pippin\"\n\n\"Wicked\"\n\nRelated Artists\n\nLeonard Bernstein\n\nBob Fosse\n\nJoel Grey\n\nAnn Reinking\n\nBen Vereen\n\nTony Walton\n\nSchwartz turned his attention to the screen, and collaborated profitably with Alan Menken on the Walt Disney animated features POCAHONTAS (1995) and THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME (1996). For POCAHONTAS, the duo won Oscars for Original Musical or Comedy Score and Original Song – “Colors of the Wind” (Schwartz was also given an ASCAP award for Most Performed Motion Picture Song) — and were nominated for their work on THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. In 1999 Schwartz won another Oscar for one of his songs, “When You Believe,” from the DreamWorks animated Bible epic, THE PRINCE OF EGYPT. Having successfully demoed his material for some years, in 1997 he released a compelling album on which he sang all nonshow songs, with the exception of “The Hardest Part of Love,” from “Children of Eden.”\n\nSource: Biographical information provided by MUZE.

Despite this early interest in music, he went on to study architecture and law at Yale. In 1934 he practiced as an architect in New York City, but studied piano and composition in his spare time. This was a fortunate decision because by the following year, with work opportunities diminishing with the depression, he was obliged to turn more and more to his second-string activity for support. Much of the music Rome was writing at this time was socially conscious and was thus of little interest to Tin Pan Alley. Nevertheless, he was engaged to write a revue for the International Garment Workers’ Union. To everyone’s surprise, the revue, “Pins and Needles” (1937), staged for members of the union, became a popular success and one song, “Sunday in the Park,” established a life outside of the show. Rome was now much sought-after, although his next show displayed similarly political concerns.\n\nRome’s work consistently demonstrated an awareness of social issues.\n\nHarold Rome\n\nKey Shows\n\n\"Call Me Mister\"\n\n\"Destry Rides Again\"\n\n\"Fanny\"\n\n\"Pins and Needles\"\n\n\"Wish You Were Here\"\n\nRelated Artists\n\nMichael Kidd\n\nJoshua Logan\n\nDavid Merrick\n\nBarbra Streisand\n\nThis was “Sing out the News” (1939) and, once again, there was a universally accepted hit song, “F.D.R. Jones.” In the early ’40s Rome wrote songs for several revues and shows, but it was not until after the end of World War II that he had his first major success. This was “Call Me Mister” (1946), from which came “South America, Take It Away.” More revues followed until his first fully fledged musical show, “Wish You Were Here,” in 1952. Two years later he wrote “Fanny,” his most popular Broadway show, which included “Love Is a Very Light Thing.” This was followed by “Destry Rides Again” (1959) and “I Can Get It for You Wholesale” (1962), in which Barbra Streisand made her Broadway debut. In the mid-’60s Rome showed that the social conscience that had marked his early work was still intact when he wrote “The Zulu and the Zayda” (1965), which dealt with racial and religious intolerance. In 1970 he wrote “Scarlett,” based upon the novel GONE WITH THE WIND, for a Japanese production in Tokyo. More than with any other American composer in the field of mainstream popular music, Rome’s work consistently demonstrated an awareness of social issues, often to the extent that it kept him from the massive successes enjoyed by many of his contemporaries. He was also a gifted painter and a dedicated art collector.\n\nSource: Biographical information provided by MUZE.

By the time he was four he had begun to pick out tunes from “The Merry Widow” on the piano and ten years later he wrote his first song, “My Auto Show Girl.” Soon he began to compose songs for amateur productions. While attending Columbia College he was honored to be the first freshman ever to write the score for the annual varsity show.\n\nAt Columbia, Rodgers met Lorenz Hart and the two became collaborators for the next 20 years. The vastly different life styles and temperaments of the men made them seem unlikely associates, with the disciplined and meticulous Rodgers playing “Teacher to Hart’s Errant Schoolboy,” as Bobby Short described it. It was “a case of love at first sight,” however, and the two formed a successful Broadway partnership until shortly before Hart’s death in 1943. Some of their hit songs included “My Funny Valentine,” “The Most Beautiful Girl in the World,” “Manhattan,” “Thou Swell,” “Johnny One Note,” “Blue Moon,” “The Lady Is a Tramp,” and “Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered.”\n\nIn 1943, Rodgers teamed up with another Columbia friend, Oscar Hammerstein II, forming one of the best known songwriting teams in the history of the American musical. Their first collaboration was the Pulitzer Prize winning play, “Oklahoma!” This innovative play was the first ever to fully integrate music and dance into the plot. Critics praised the songs for their appropriateness to the mood and character of the play. Several of the songs became popular hits, especially, “Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'” and “People Will Say We’re in Love.”\n\nRodgers and Hammerstein proceeded to produce a continuous stream of Broadway hits until Hammerstein’s death in 1960. Many of the plays were adapted as motion pictures, the most profitable being THE SOUND OF MUSIC. Some of their best-loved songs included: “June Is Bustin’ Out All Over” and “If I Loved You” from “Carousel”; “I Enjoy Being a Girl” from “Flower Drum Song”; “Getting to Know You” from “The King and I”; “Some Enchanted Evening” and “I’m Gonna Wash that Man Right Outta My Hair” from “South Pacific”; and “My Favorite Things” and “Edelweiss” from “The Sound of Music.”\n\nRichard Rodgers\n\nKey Shows\n\n\"Allegro\"\n\n\"Annie Get Your Gun\"\n\n\"The Boys from Syracuse\"\n\n\"By Jupiter\"\n\n\"Carousel\"\n\n\"A Connecticut Yankee\"\n\n\"Flower Drum Song\"\n\n\"Garrick Gaieties\"\n\n\"Jumbo\"\n\n\"The King and I\"\n\n\"No Strings\"\n\n\"Oklahoma!\"\n\n\"On Your Toes\"\n\n\"Pal Joey\"\n\n\"The Sound of Music\"\n\n\"South Pacific\"\n\n\"State Fair\"\n\nRelated Artists\n\nIrving Berlin\n\nAlfred Drake\n\nDorothy Fields\n\nOscar Hammerstein II\n\nLorenz Hart\n\nGene Kelly\n\nJoshua Logan\n\nMary Martin\n\nEthel Merman\n\nJohn Raitt\n\nPeter Stoneex:\n\nRobin Wagnerex:\n\nThough Hammerstein’s passing left him without a permanent lyricist, Rodgers continued on his own, composing works for television and the stage. He served as his own lyricist for “No Strings” in 1962.\n\nCommenting on his work, Rodgers told Mary Tanenbaum, “I guess I am proudest of ‘Carousel,’ because I like the score best and what the show has to say — based, of course, on the ‘Liliom’ of Molnar — about a man who really didn’t know how to love his wife and child until too late. …”\n\nRodgers’ autobiography, MUSICAL STAGES, contains anecdotes about the composer’s experiences writing Broadway musicals. Margo Jefferson remarked that “in his implacably good-tempered, judiciously written autobiography, Richard Rodgers emerges as all of a piece: a man who knew what he wanted, who got it through a dedication to work that has been total but dispassionate, and one whose supreme gifts as a writer of popular songs remain a mystery — above all to himself.” Mel Gussow reflected, “What makes this book a special pleasure are the reminiscences of those thriving days when songwriting seemed like the headiest occupation in the world.”\n\nSource: Excerpted from CONTEMPORARY AUTHORS ONLINE, Gale Group, © 2003 Gale Group.

Their first produced musicals were drawn from Biblical themes: “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dream Coat” (1967) and “Jesus Christ Superstar” (1969). Rice and Lloyd Webber pioneered the use of concept albums in raising both money for and public awareness of their music. The apotheosis of their collaboration was “Evita” (1979), a pop opera about Argentina’s first lady, Eva Peron that was a success both in London and in New York and earned Rice two Tony Awards. After nearly a decade and a half, it was finally filmed in 1996 with Madonna in the lead.\n\nFollowing “Evita,” Rice and Lloyd Webber went their separate ways creatively (except for the 1986 operetta “Cricket” commissioned for presentation before Queen Elizabeth II). Rice collaborated with composer Stephen Oliver on the medieval story “Blondel” (1983) and later wrote “Chess” (1985) with pop artists Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Anderson (of ABBA). The latter went through several incarnations, beginning as a concept album and later staged in London by Michael Bennett and Trevor Nunn and in New York by Nunn. While the pop score produced the hit singles “One Night in Bangkok” and “I Know Him So Well” in England, “Chess” failed to capture the American public’s attention, partly because its use of a chess match as a metaphor for the Cold War seemed dated by its 1988 American premiere.\n\nTim Rice\n\nKey Shows\n\n\"Aida\"\n\n\"Beauty and the Beast\"\n\n\"Evita\"\n\n\"Jesus Christ Superstar\"\n\n\"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\"\n\n\"The Lion King\"\n\nRelated Artists\n\nPatti LuPone\n\nTrevor Nunn\n\nMandy Patinkin\n\nJulie Taymor\n\nBen Vereen\n\nRobin Wagner\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber\n\nRice had contributed lyrics to several songs used in features including “Hearts Not Diamonds” (music by Marvin Hamlisch) in THE FAN (1981) and “All Time High” (music by John Barry) in OCTOPUSSY (1983). In 1992, he was selected to help augment the score for Disney’s animated feature ALADDIN after lyricist Howard Ashman had succumbed to AIDS. Collaborating with composer Alan Menken, Rice provided the words for the Oscar-winning “A Whole New World.” He and Menken further collaborated on the stage version of Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast” (1993). Rice then teamed with Elton John for the songs for Disney’s THE LION KING (1994), for which he received his second Oscar for “Can You Feel the Love Tonight?” Rice picked up a third Oscar for the ballad “You Must Love Me” written for Madonna to sing in EVITA (1996). The song also marked the first collaboration between Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber in over a decade.\n\nSource: Excerpted from Baseline. BaselineStudioSystems — A Hollywood Media Corp.

His best work set standards of sophistication and wit seldom matched in the popular musical theater.\n\nCole Porter was born in Peru, Indiana, on June 9, 1891, the son of a pharmacist. His mother was as determined that her only son become a creative artist as his wealthy midwestern pioneer grandfather was that he enter business or farming. Kate Cole’s influence proved stronger, and Porter received considerable musical training as a child. By 1901 he had composed a onesong “operetta” entitled “The Song of the Birds”; then he produced a piano piece, “The Bobolink Waltz,” which his mother published in Chicago.\n\nPorter attended Worcester Academy, where he composed the class song of 1909. At Yale (1909-1913) he wrote music and collaborated on lyrics for the scores of several amateur shows presented by his fraternity and the Yale Dramatic Association. Porter then entered Harvard Law School; almost at once, however, he changed his course of study to music. Before leaving Harvard he collaborated on a comic operetta, “See America First” (1916), which became his first show produced on Broadway. It was a complete disaster.\n\nIn 1917 Porter was in France, and for some months during 1918-1919 he served in the French Foreign Legion. After this he studied composition briefly with the composer Vincent d’Indy in Paris. Returning to New York, he contributed songs to the Broadway production “Hitchy-Koo of 1919,” his first success, and married the wealthy socialite Linda Lee.\n\nThe Porters began a lifetime of traveling on a grand scale; they became famous for their lavish parties and the circle of celebrities in which they moved. Porter contributed songs to various stage shows and films and in 1923 composed a ballet, “Within the Quota,” which was performed in Paris and New York. Songs such as “Let’s Do It” (1928), “What Is This Thing Called Love” (1929), “You Do Something to Me” (1929), and “Love for Sale” (1930) established him as a creator of worldly, witty, occasionally risqué lyrics with unusual melodic lines to match.\n\nCole Porter\n\nKey Shows\n\n\"Anything Goes\"\n\n\"Can-Can\"\n\n\"Du Barry Was a Lady\"\n\n\"Fifty Million Frenchmen\"\n\n\"Gay Divorce\"\n\n\"High Society\"\n\n\"Jubilee\"\n\n\"Kiss Me, Kate\"\n\n\"Leave It to Me!\"\n\n\"Mexican Hayride\"\n\n\"Panama Hattie\"\n\n\"Silk Stockings\"\n\n\"Red, Hot and Blue\"\n\n\"Paris\"\n\nRelated Artists\n\nAlfred Drake\n\nDorothy Fields\n\nMoss Hart\n\nGeorge Kaufman\n\nMichael Kidd\n\nGene Kelly\n\nBert Lahr\n\nMary Martin\n\nEthel Merman\n\nChita Rivera\n\nGwen Verdon\n\nTony Walton\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s Porter provided full scores for a number of bright Broadway and Hollywood productions, among them “Anything Goes” (1934), “Jubilee” (1935), “Rosalie” (1937), “Panama Hattie” (1940), and “Kiss Me, Kate” (1948). These scores and others of the period abound with his characteristic songs: “Night and Day,” “I Get a Kick out of You,” “You’re the Top,” “Anything Goes,” “Begin the Beguine,” “Just One of Those Things,” “Don’t Fence Me In,” “In the Still of the Night,” and “So in Love.”\n\nSerious injuries in a riding accident in 1937 plagued Porter for the remainder of his life. A series of operations led, in 1958, to the amputation of his right leg. In his last years he produced one big Broadway success (“Can-Can,” 1953). He died on October 15, 1964, in Santa Monica, California.\n\nPorter’s songs show an elegance of expression and a cool detachment that seem to epitomize a kind of sophistication peculiar to the 1930s. He was also an authentically talented creator of original melodies. Like George Gershwin, he frequently disregarded the accepted formulas of the conventional popular song (usually a rigid 32-measure framework) and turned out pieces of charm and distinction.\n\nSource: Excerpted from ENCYCLOPEDIA OF WORLD BIOGRAPHY, 2ND ED. 17 VOLS., Gale Research, © 1998 Gale Research.

In the late 1940s Logan directed and co-authored two of Broadway’s most popular productions — “Mister Roberts,” written with Thomas Heggen, and “South Pacific,” for which he shared a Pulitzer Prize in drama with Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein. His many other director’s credits include the Broadway shows “Annie Get Your Gun” and “The World of Suzie Wong” and the films BUS STOP and CAMELOT. Logan worked in theater and film throughout his career, showing talent from the time he was a young student at Princeton University. He acted on stage before achieving his first major success as a director with “I Married an Angel,” in 1938; he also produced several shows. For many years Logan struggled with manic-depressive illness, and late in life he toured the country to offer encouragement to fellow sufferers. In addition to plays, his writings include the screen adaptation of MISTER ROBERTS; its sequel, ENSIGN PULVER; and the autobiographies JOSH: MY UP AND DOWN, IN AND OUT LIFE and MOVIE STARS, REAL PEOPLE, AND ME.\n\nIn his first book of memoirs, JOSH: MY UP AND DOWN, IN AND OUT LIFE, Logan “re-creates an era that has almost entirely disappeared — a time when New York was the center of America’s theatrical universe and a nude male torso on a Broadway stage was a subject of controversy,” John Houseman commented.\n\nIn the book he discussed his associations with such theatrical giants as Margaret Sullavan, Henry Fonda, James Stewart, William Inge, David Merrick, Oscar Hammerstein, Richard Rodgers, Mary Martin, Helen Hayes, and Ethel Merman. Also included is a reminiscence of the great master of the theater, Stanislavsky, under whom Logan studied in Russia after graduating from Princeton. Logan was also extremely candid in discussing the two nervous breakdowns that were linked to his career.\n\nJoshua Logan\n\nKey Shows\n\n\"All American\"\n\n\"Annie Get Your Gun\"\n\n\"Fanny\"\n\n\"South Pacific\"\n\n\"Wish You Were Here\"\n\nRelated Artists\n\nAgnes de Mille\n\nOscar Hammerstein II\n\nMary Martin\n\nDavid Merrick\n\nRichard Rodgers\n\nHarold Rome\n\nCharles Strouse\n\nMOVIE STARS, REAL PEOPLE, AND ME begins where the first book left off, and covers Logan’s 1956 direction of the film, PICNIC, to the time of the memoir’s publication, although not chronologically.

Much of it is gossipy and inconsequential; much of it is funny and bawdy; much of it is impassioned and illuminating. Mr. Logan’s emotions are usually at high pitch and catch the reader up. The pages whizz by.”\n\nSource: Excerpted from CONTEMPORARY AUTHORS ONLINE, Gale Group, © 2001 Gale Group.

He studied piano as a child, appearing with the Berlin Symphony Orchestra in 1917. In 1924, he visited the USA, but was unable to find work in a classical environment. Instead, he eked out a living playing piano in restaurants and bars, then roamed throughout the USA, tackling a variety of jobs, including boxing, prospecting, and cowpunching. As a young teenager he had written songs, and he resumed this activity in New York in the early ’30s. Later in the decade he contributed to various musical shows, and in 1942 began to collaborate with lyricist Alan Jay Lerner. Their first Broadway score was for “What’s Up?” in 1943, which was followed two year later with “The Day Before Spring.” From that point onward, they wrote the music and lyrics (Lerner also contributed the librettos) for some of the most memorable productions in the history of the American musical theater. They had their first hit in 1947 with “Brigadoon,” from which came “The Heather on the Hill,” “From This Day On,” and “Almost Like Being in Love,” and the association was renewed in 1951 with “Paint Your Wagon,” containing such lovely songs as “They Call the Wind Maria,” “I Talk to the Trees,” and “Wand’rin’ Star.”\n\nIn 1956, the team had a major triumph with the legendary “My Fair Lady,” which ran on Broadway for 2,717 performances. The score included such lasting favorites as “On the Street Where You Live,” “Get Me to the Church on Time,” “With a Little Bit of Luck,” “Wouldn’t It Be Loverly?,” “The Rain in Spain,” “Why Can’t the English?”, “I’m an Ordinary Man,” and “I Could Have Danced All Night.”\n\nFrederick Loewe\n\nKey Shows\n\n\"Brigadoon\"\n\n\"Cameot\"\n\n\"Gigi\"\n\n\"My Fair Lady\"\n\n\"Paint Your Wagon\"\n\nRelated Artists\n\nJulie Andrews\n\nKitty Carlisle Hart\n\nMoss Hart\n\nMichael Kidd\n\nAlan Jay Lerner\n\nAgnes de Mille\n\nAfter the huge success of “My Fair Lady,” Lerner and Loewe were invited to write the script, music, and lyrics for a musical film, and while Lerner was enthusiastic about the idea, Loewe was somewhat reluctant. Eventually he agreed, and together they created the incomparable “Gigi” (1958), one of the final flourishes of the old-style Hollywood musical. The magnificent score included “Thank Heaven for Little Girls,” “I’m Glad I’m Not Young Anymore,” “I Remember It Well,” “The Night They Invented Champagne,” and the charming title song. After being hospitalized with serious heart trouble, Loewe collaborated with Lerner on “Camelot,” which opened in 1960, and ran for over two years. Although the show’s preproduction was marred with problems, the result was another success, with such outstanding songs as “If Ever I Would Leave You” and “How to Handle a Woman.” Afterward, Loewe decided to retire, emerging briefly in the early ’70s to work with Lerner on two unsuccessful projects — a stage adaptation of “Gigi” and the film THE LITTLE PRINCE.\n\nSource: Biographical information provided by MUZE.

His father, who had been an accompanist for the soprano Lilli Lehmann, gave his children a strong musical upbringing. (Frank’s older brother, Arthur, became a pianist, critic, and educator.) But even as a child Frank was aggressively lowbrow: his first lyrics were set to the rhythms of the elevated trains, and he took pride in winning third prize in a citywide harmonica contest. Years later, the Loesser family would remark that Frank’s songs were “very nice, but of course they’re not music.”\n\nBored with formal education (he flunked out of the City College of New York in 1925, his first year), Loesser tried newspaper work, cartooning, advertising, press agentry, and radio writing. His great pleasure, though, was writing verses for others’ music, a few of them performed in Lions Clubs and other inauspicious places. These were difficult years. Loesser occasionally sold songs, but his first show, the “Illustrators’ Revue” (1936), closed in four nights. For a time he resorted to such jobs as screwing the tops onto insecticide bottles.\n\nIn 1935, Loesser performed in a club with a singer called Lynn Garland (born Mary Alice Blankenbaker). They were married on Oct. 19, 1936; they had two children. In 1936, Loesser signed a contract with Universal Films and left for Hollywood, a year later switching to Paramount. He remained in Hollywood until World War II, his reputation as a fine lyricist (at least for novelty numbers) rising very quickly. Among the dozens of songs for which Loesser provided the words in those years were “Two Sleepy People” and “Heart and Soul,” with Hoagy Carmichael; “Blue Nightfall,” “Dancing on a Dime,” and “The Lady’s in Love with You,” with Burton Lane; and such others as “Snug as a Bug in a Rug,” “Sand in My Shoes,” “Jingle, Jangle, Jingle,” and “The Boys in the Back Room.”\n\nDuring World War II, Loesser served in the Army air force but continued to contribute timely lyrics (such as the winsome “They’re Either Too Young or Too Old”) for films and for isolated songs expressive of the new wartime sensibility. Seizing on the watchcry of Pearl Harbor, Loesser wrote “Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition,” which came to be to World War II what “Over There” had been to World War I. Shortly thereafter came the moving “Ballad of Rodger Young” and the characteristic Loesser “gripe” song “What Do You Do in the Infantry?” Not only was Loesser suiting his lyrics to the mood of the times, but he was now doing so to his own music, following Jerome Kern’s advice: “Your lyrics make the writing of melody a cinch.”\n\nAfter the war, Loesser returned to writing for films and for Tin Pan Alley, now exclusively his own collaborator. Among his songs from those years are “What Are You Doing New Year’s Eve?”, “On a Slow Boat to China,” and, for the film NEPTUNE’S DAUGHTER, “Baby, It’s Cold Outside,” which won him the 1949 Academy Award for best song. In RED, HOT, AND BLUE (1949) he made his only screen appearance. Despite these successes, Loesser wanted “to create situations” rather than songs: “Songwriting is a little thing and I settled for a big thing.” The “big thing” was the Broadway musical, and Loesser never again wrote single songs. His “Where’s Charley?” (1948), which ran over two years, surprised those who had doubted Loesser’s ability to craft an integrated musical score on his first try. But “Where’s Charley?” paled in comparison to his “Guys and Dolls” (1950), universally recognized as among the greatest of all Broadway musicals. Loesser found the eccentric idioms of the Damon Runyon characters (in Abe Burrows’ script) ideal for his colloquial lyrical style, but the great accomplishment was suiting each song to the character who performs it; the songs here are as important as the book in depicting character and propelling plot.\n\nAfter the war, Loesser returned to writing for films and for Tin Pan Alley.\n\nLoesser never doubted that he could amuse, but he felt that touching an audience required more dexterity. His next endeavors moved him in that direction. In 1952 came his only complete film score, composed for Samuel Goldwyn’s HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN; its romantic ballads and children’s songs have the ardor and Old World charm of the film. Then, returning to Broadway, he created his most ambitious work, “The Most Happy Fella” (1956). This musical, for which Loesser wrote the book (based on Sidney Howard’s play “They Knew What They Wanted”) and more than 40 musical numbers, is an unparalleled mixture of Puccinean aria, folk song, and Broadway show tune. “Mr. Loesser has now come about as close to opera as the rules of Broadway permit,” was Brooks Atkinson’s verdict in THE NEW YORK TIMES. “He has told everything of vital importance in terms of dramatic music.” In 1957, Loesser and his wife were divorced. On Apr. 30, 1959, he married Jo Sullivan (born Elizabeth Josephine Sullivan), who had played the female lead in “Most Happy Fella”; they had two children.\n\nLoesser was proud of having surpassed his status as “songwriter,” and he had considerable affection for his next musical, the gentle “Greenwillow” (1960), though its commercial failure distressed him sorely. In fact, he had but one more success, “How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying” (1961), which marked a return to the wisecracking idiom of “Guys and Dolls.” It was his first attempt at light satire. Though decidedly not in the lyrical vein that Loesser craved, the show suited his knack for parody and character song, and it suited the 1960s: it became the longest-running of any of Loesser’s shows and only the fourth musical to win a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nFrank Loesser\n\nKey Shows\n\n\"Canterbury Tales\"\n\n\"Greenwillow\"\n\n\"Guys and Dolls\"\n\n\"How to Succeed in Business\"\n\n\"The Most Happy Fella\"\n\n\"Where's Charley?\"\n\nRelated Artists\n\nGeorge Abbott\n\nBob Fosse\n\nMichael Kidd\n\nRobert Morse\n\nIt was also his last work to reach Broadway: “Pleasures and Palaces” (1965) closed out of town, while “Señor Indiscretion,” barely completed at the time of Loesser’s death, has not yet had a professional production. Loesser devoted much of his last years to publishing and production, introducing several new talents to Broadway. He died in New York City.\n\nUnquestionably Frank Loesser achieved what every artist most covets: the esteem of his colleagues. Richard Rodgers called him “a man for all theater seasons,” while Bob Fosse regarded “Guys and Dolls” as simply “the greatest American musical of all time.” Nonprofessionals are likely to remember Loesser as the composer-lyricist of hundreds of enduring songs and five full scores, music with a trademark combination of tenderness, toughness, and fun. Paddy Chayefsky remarked that “he introduced reality and sanity into the musical comedy,” but he never forgot that he was foremost an entertainer.\n\n— John D.

A list of their hits all but defines the genre: “Brigadoon,” “Paint Your Wagon,” “Camelot,” the movie musical GIGI, and their biggest triumph, “My Fair Lady.”\n\n“My Fair Lady” opened on Broadway in 1956 to rapturous notices and packed houses.\n\nThe tuneful adaptation of George Bernard Shaw’s “Pygmalion,” “My Fair Lady” opened on Broadway in 1956 to rapturous notices and packed houses. Brooks Atkinson of THE NEW YORK TIMES, for one, proclaimed “My Fair Lady” as “the most civilized play of its time and one of the finest of the century.” On the occasion of Lerner’s death, William A. Henry III of TIME remembered how these classic lyrics “consistently matched [“Pygmalion”‘s] wit, verve and acerbic class consciousness.”\n\nAlan Jay Lerner\n\nKey Shows\n\n\"Brigadoon\"\n\n\"Camelot\"\n\n\"Gigi\"\n\n\"My Fair Lady\"\n\n\"On a Clear Day You Can See Forever\"\n\n\"Paint Your Wagon\"\n\nRelated Artists\n\nJulie Andrews\n\nLeonard Bernstein\n\nAgnes de Mille\n\nMoss Hart\n\nMichael Kidd\n\nFrederick Loewe\n\nIn the 1970s, after Loewe fell ill, Lerner continued writing with composers including Andre Previn and Charles Strouse, but such subsequent musicals as “Coco” and “Dance a Little Closer” never quite caught on with critics and playgoers. In 1978 Lerner produced his autobiography, ON THE STREET WHERE I LIVE. By then he had quite a story to tell — the lyricist had been married a total of eight times — but as NEW YORK TIMES critic Mel Gussow noted, “The book is more professional than personal.” He continued that the volume’s delights include a look at Lerner and Loewe’s labors with “My Fair Lady”: “dashing off ‘The Rain in Spain’ in 10 minutes, agonizing over ‘I Could Have Danced All Night’ … and agreeing to eliminate ‘With a Little Bit O’ Luck’ until it stopped the show at its first performance in New Haven.”\n\nSource: Excerpted from CONTEMPORARY AUTHORS ONLINE, Gale Group, © 2001 Gale Group.

Arthur Laurents was barely 21 when he wrote his first radio play “Now Playing Tomorrow” in 1939. He went on to write episodes of “Dr. Christian,” “The Thin Man,” and numerous originals. During W.W. II, he wrote “Armed Service Forces Present” as well as “This Is Your FBI.”\n\nLaurents began his directing career with his play “Invitation to a March.”\n\nLaurents’ first play, “Home of the Brave,” was a hard-hitting look at the plight of a Jewish GI during the War and opened on Broadway in 1945 and in London (as “The Way Back”) in 1946. “The Bird Cage” followed in 1950, then “The Time of the Cuckoo” (1952) and “A Clearing in the Woods” (1957). In 1957 also came “West Side Story,” with music by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim. Originally conceived by Jerome Robbins (who directed and choreographed) as a twist on “Romeo and Juliet” using Jews and Catholics (and called “East Side Story”), it was transformed by Laurents and Bernstein into the tale of Polish-American Romeo and Puerto Rican Juliet, while their respective gangs fight a street war. Laurents followed this with the book for “Gypsy” (1959), based on the memoirs by Gypsy Rose Lee. The show reteamed Laurents, Robbins, and Sondheim (Jule Styne wrote the bouncy score) and gave Ethel Merman what was arguably her greatest stage triumph.\n\nArthur Laurents\n\nKey Shows\n\n\"Do I Hear A Waltz?\"\n\n\"Gypsy\"\n\n\"La Cage aux Folles\"\n\n\"West Side Story\"\n\nRelated Artists\n\nLeonard Bernstein\n\nHarvey Fierstein\n\nJerry Herman\n\nAngela Lansbury\n\nEthel Merman\n\nHarold Prince\n\nJerome Robbins\n\nStephen Sondheim\n\nBarbra Streisand\n\nJule Styne\n\nLaurents began his directing career with his play “Invitation to a March” (1960), that featured incidental music by Sondheim. In 1962, Laurents directed (but did not write) the musical “I Can Get It for You Wholesale,” about the garment district. The cast included Lillian Roth, Elliot Gould, and a newcomer, Barbra Streisand, who played the secretary Yetta Marmelstein and nightly stopped the show with her one number. Laurents wrote the book for and directed the Sondheim musical “Anyone Can Whistle” (1964), which has developed a cult following. It also marked the musical theater debut of Lee Remick and Angela Lansbury. He turned his own play “The Time of the Cuckoo” into the musical “Do I Hear A Waltz?” (1965), which set Sondheim’s lyrics to Rodgers’ music. Although he was nominated for Tony Awards for “West Side Story” and “Gypsy,” Laurents did not win until “Hallelujah, Baby!” in 1967.\n\nHis ongoing work in the theater tapered off slightly in the ’70s while he concentrated on features. He directed Lansbury in the 1974 London premiere of “Gypsy” (and its subsequent Broadway incarnation the following year) and, in 1979, he directed and co-wrote Phyllis Newman’s one-woman show, “The Madwoman of Central Park West.” Laurents did not direct again until he helmed the musical version of “La Cage aux Folles” (1983), which, unlike the film on which it was based, expressed the outrage of the Albin character when his lover’s son tries to cast him aside. (This development may be a reflection of the influence of Laurents, book writer Harvey Fierstein and others involved in the production who are openly gay.) Laurents won a Tony Award for his direction of the musical. In 1989, Laurents again oversaw a revival of “Gypsy,” headed by Tyne Daly. Two years later, he wrote the book and directed the ill-advised stage musical “Nick and Nora,” inspired by the characters featured in “The Thin Man.”\n\nLaurents’ career in Hollywood as a screenwriter has almost been separate from his career in the theater, although he has sometimes been involved in the adaptation of his plays and musicals. His first screen credit was a shared one on THE SNAKE PIT (1948), a harrowing study of mental illness starring Olivia de Havilland. Laurents then adapted Patrick Hamilton’s play “Rope” (also 1948) for Alfred Hitchcock, which was loosely based on the Leopold-Loeb case. Other adaptations include ANNA LUCASTA (1949, with Philip Yordan), ANASTASIA (1956), based on the play about a woman who may or may not be the surviving daughter of the executed Russian Czar, and BONJOUR TRISTESSE (1958).\n\nLaurents co-wrote most of the feature adaptations of his stage work, beginning with 1949’s HOME OF THE BRAVE, which altered his original story that centered on a Jewish soldier to that of a black soldier. With Ernest Lehman, he adapted WEST SIDE STORY (1961), with Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer, and with Leonard Spigelgass, he wrote GYPSY (1962), that featured a non-singing Rosalind Russell and Wood. He also worked on the screen version of “The Time of the Cuckoo” which became David Lean’s SUMMERTIME (1965). In 1973, Laurents adapted his own novel, “The Way We Were,” the story of the romance between a Jewish woman and a WASP gent broken apart by cultural and political differences. The result, starring Streisand and Robert Redford, was a throw-back to the classic “women’s pictures” and was a huge box-office success. Laurents followed with THE TURNING POINT (1977), which he also produced with its director Herbert Ross. Also a critical and commercial success, the film told the tale of two fortyish women, one an aging ballet star (Anne Bancroft), the other (Shirley MacLaine) who gave up dancing to raise a family and have a life of regrets.\n\nLaurents has merely dabbled in TV. He wrote the 1967 NBC special THE LIGHT FANTASTIC; OR, HOW TO TELL YOUR PAST, PRESENT AND MAYBE FUTURE THROUGH SOCIAL DANCING, and he oversaw the adaptation of GYPSY (CBS, 1993) for Bette Midler.\n\nSource: Excerpted from Baseline.

Larson lived in poverty, waited tables, and worked seven years to bring his rock opera “Rent” to the stage — only to collapse and die the night before previews were to open at the Off-Broadway New York Theater Workshop. The show’s initial five-week run sold out within 24 hours of opening night, and the play became an enormous critical and popular success. In addition, “Rent” achieved Larson’s ambition of updating musical theater and making it socially and personally relevant to a younger audience. NEWSDAY’s Linda Winer called it “the first original breakthrough rock musical since ‘Hair.'” The fresh, provocative, and exuberant show — and Larson’s heartbreaking story — quickly became Broadway legend. “The show features, among forty well-sung numbers, three songs that are as passionate, unpretentious and powerful as anything I’ve heard in musical theatre for more than a decade,” John Lahr wrote in THE NEW YORKER. “His songs have urgency — a sense of mourning and mystery which insists on seizing the moment. … Larson’s … talent and his big heart are impossible to miss. His songs spill over with feeling and ideas; his work is both juicy and haunting.”\n\nLarson lived his childhood amidst drama clubs and music lessons.\n\nLarson lived his childhood amidst drama clubs and music lessons. He played the tuba in high school and attended Adelphi University in Garden City, New York. Although he graduated with dreams of becoming an actor, Stephen Sondheim encouraged him to focus on composing. Larson was a Sondheim disciple and his early work suggested his future success. He won the Richard Rodgers Studio Production Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters for a workshop version of “Rent,” and a Rodgers Development Grant for a futuristic rock musical called “Suburbia.” He also earned a Stephen Sondheim Award from the American Music Theater Festival; composed the eclectic rock-to-ragtime score for a musical called “J.P. Morgan Saves the Nation”; and performed a rock monologue called “Tick, Tick, Boom” at the New York Theater Workshop and other stages.\n\n“Rent” is based on the classic Puccini opera “La Bohème.” The musical is set in a dingy, dishevelled loft apartment in New York’s East Village and depicts “young … artists struggling to celebrate life in the shadow of drugs, poverty and AIDS,” Jonathan Wiederhorn wrote in ROLLING STONE. Larson’s score blends pop, dance, dance, salsa, rhythm and blues, gospel, and rock music, while his characters update those of Puccini: Rodolfo, the lovelorn poet, is resurrected in punk-rocker Roger; Marcello the painter becomes Mark the videographer; Mimi trades tuberculosis for HIV. “In both productions,” Wiederhorn noted, “the main characters are threatened with eviction and burn their written work to stay warm.” Larson, however, leavens the lost dreams and lives with his show’s “emphasis on love, friendship, and survival.”\n\nAs the debut of “Rent” approached, Larson lived in poverty similar to that endured by his characters. He stopped working in a SoHo diner only two months before the play opened and dreamed of earning enough money to afford cable TV. Ten days before he died, Larson sold some of his books to get money for a movie ticket. “It’s both tragic and ironic that Larson … never saw ticket holders enjoy his show,” Wiederhorn wrote. “Even more uncanny are the parallels between Larson’s life and his characters’ — many of whom cling to life knowing that it could end at any moment.”\n\nJonathan Larson\n\nKey Shows\n\n\"Rent\"\n\nRelated Artists\n\nStephen Sondheim\n\nLarson is survived by his parents, Allan and Nanette Larson of New Mexico, and his sister, Julie McCollum of Los Angeles. “For Mr. Larson’s parents and sister and friends, opening night was glorious and heartbreaking,” Mel Gussow wrote in THE NEW YORK TIMES. “‘It’s the best and worst moment of my life,’ said his sister. ‘This play was Jonathan. It is totally my brother.'”\n\nSource: Excerpted from NEWSMAKERS 1997, ISSUE 4, Gale Research, © 1997 Gale Research.

Eventually, Lapine headed East when he accepted a position teaching design at the Yale School of Drama. With encouragement from some of his students, he adapted and staged Gertrude Stein’s play “Photograph,” which caught the attention of a producer who moved the show to Off-Broadway in 1977. Flush from winning an special OBIE, Lapine staged his “Twelve Dreams,” inspired by a case study of Carl Jung, as a work in progress. Two years later, he garnered attention and acclaim for his breakthrough stage comedy “Table Settings,” about a zany Jewish-American family. Lapine subsequently collaborated with composer William Finn on “March of the Falsettos,” a sort of sequel to Finn’s earlier “In Trousers.” Centered on Marvin, a divorced father who has “come out” as a gay man, the musical tackled darker themes than the typical stage fare. From its opening number (“Four Jews in a Room Bitching”) through to the poignant closing number (“Father to Son”), the show ultimately explored what makes a family. While Lapine went on to other fruitful collaborations, he and Finn revisited the characters of Marvin, his neurotic wife Trina, his son Jason, the psychiatrist Mendel, and Marvin’s lover Whizzer in a sequel “Falsettoland” (1990). This time the creators opted to introduce the more serious specter of AIDS. A moving and powerful study of love as well as a paean to family, “Falsettoland” won a strong following.\n\nJames Lapine\n\nKey Shows\n\n\"Falsettos\"\n\n\"Into the Woods\"\n\n\"Passion\"\n\n\"Sunday in the Park with George\"\n\nRelated Artists\n\nMandy Patinkin\n\nBernadette Peters\n\nStephen Sondheim\n\nDirector-choreographer Graciela Daniele hit on the idea of combining the two relatively short shows into one evening marking the birth of “Falsettos.” Lapine and Finn reworked the material slightly and with some of the same cast (Michael Rupert, Stephen Bogardus, Chip Zien) from the earlier productions, took the show to Broadway in 1992, where it won Tony Awards for its book and score. In between these productions, Lapine also struck up an artistically profitable association with composer Stephen Sondheim. Beginning in 1983, the duo began work on “Sunday in the Park with George,” a project that found its inspiration in the unusual, Georges Seraut’s pointillistic masterpiece “A Sunday on the Island of La Grand Jatte-1884.” The collaborators fashioned a piece that spanned some 100 years, with act one culminating in a recreation of the famous painting and act two a contemporary send-up of the art world. “Sunday in the Park with George” was not a crowd-pleasing show in the vein of its contemporary “La Cage aux Folles” as it challenged audiences to examine the creation and nature of art as well as its acceptance by the masses. Cited by the Pulitzer committee for the award in drama in 1985, the show proved only a modest success, although it was preserved in a TV production that aired originally on Showtime and later PBS.\n\nLapine and Sondheim again turned to odd material for their next collaboration “Into the Woods” (1987). Although seemingly inspired by fairy tales, the show owed much to Bruno Bettleheim’s THE USES OF ENCHANTMENT as the musical explored the darker territories of responsibility for one’s actions that lay behind the “happily ever after” ideal. Effectively mounted by Lapine and well-cast with actor-singers, “Into the Woods” proved to be the pair’s most successful collaboration (to date), earning the Best Book and Best Score Tony Awards. It too was filmed (this time with Lapine at the helm) for airing on PBS’ AMERICAN PLAYHOUSE in 1991.\n\nAs a follow-up Sondheim and Lapine originally intended to produce to separate one-act musicals, which would serve as commentary on society’s preoccupation with beauty. “Muscle” was to focus on bodybuilders while “Passion,” based on a Ettore Scola’s “Passione d’Amore,” which in turn was an adaptation of an obscure Italian novel, would deal with the obsessive love of an unattractive woman. As the work progressed, however, Sondheim and Lapine found their focus drawn to “Passion,” which evolved into a full-length intermissionless show about the many faces of love. In his staging, Lapine stripped the material to its bare essentials but brought a painter’s eye to the details. Featuring a star-making performance by Donna Murphy, “Passion” received strong reviews and several accolades including the Best Musical Tony, but ultimately proved too cerebral and remote for audiences more accustomed to the spectacles of British imports like “Cats” and “Miss Saigon” or the live-action version of Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast.” (Ironically, Lapine was tapped to direct the stage version of another Disney animated feature “The Hunchback of Notre Dame” in 1999.)\n\nLapine became a noted stager of dramatic works, including Shakespeare.\n\nIn addition to his work in the musical theater, Lapine became a noted stager of dramatic works, including Shakespeare. He enjoyed a spectacular success with a 1982 production of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” starring William Hurt as Oberon. (The production was telecast on PBS.) He also reteamed with Mandy Patinkin for “The Winter’s Tale” in 1989, and undertook the staging of the revised version of “The Diary of Anne Frank” in 1997. While he stumbled with the Broadway production of David Henry Hwang’s “Golden Child” the following year, he was back in top form as co-conceiver and director of “Dirty Blonde” (1999), a comedy-drama that was part biography of Mae West and a mediation on fame and fandom. When the show moved to Broadway in May 2000, the reviews were nearly all raves.\n\nLike many stage directors, Lapine ventured into the realm of filmmaking. In 1991, working from a script by his wife Sarah Kernochan, he helmed IMPROMPTU, a romantic romp set in the 19th-century and featuring a roundelay of relationships among such figures as George Sand, Franz Liszt, and Eugene Delacroix. The film inverted some of the conventions of period pieces and proved a pleasurable debut. Lapine’s follow-up also demonstrated his flair with actors and his ability to mix drama and comedy. LIFE WITH MIKEY (1993) was a comedy vehicle for TV star Michael J. Fox, who portrayed a struggling talent agent whose attempt to turn a pickpocket into a child star reinvigorates his love for his work. Although he guided TV productions of INTO THE WOODS and PASSION, Lapine did not tackle a full-out feature-length project again until 1999’s made-for-cable EARTHLY POSSESSIONS (HBO), which again showed his flair for handling actors.\n\nSource: Excerpted from Baseline.

Harry Truman, who was the U.S. President at the time of Kern’s death, was quoted as saying in David Ewen’s book, COMPOSERS FOR THE AMERICAN MUSICAL THEATRE: “[Kern’s] melodies will live in our voices and warm our hearts for many years to come. … The man who gave them to us earned a lasting place in his nation’s history.” In 1946 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released a lavish musical film biography of Kern, TILL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY, with appearances by Judy Garland, Frank Sinatra, Lena Horne, and other stars. The centennial of Kern’s birth was celebrated in 1985, which saw the issuing of a U.S. Postage stamp in his honor, as well as the release of more recordings and performances of his music. “Show Boat,” the most enduring of his works, continues to enjoy Broadway revivals. There is no sign that Kern’s legacy is in danger of fading.\n\nJerome Kern\n\nKey Shows\n\n\"The Cat and the Fiddle\"\n\n\"Girl from Utah\"\n\n\"Oh, Boy!\"\n\n\"Oh, Lady!

He studied piano with his mother and in high school was often asked to play piano and organ and compose music for school theatrical productions. In 1902, at the age of 17, he tried his hand at a business career working for his father, who owned a merchandizing house. But the young Kern’s enthusiasm for music led to his ordering 200 pianos from an Italian dealer instead of two — the number he was supposed to purchase. This action almost cost his father his business, and to Kern’s relief, it was agreed that he should pursue a career in music.\n\nKern enrolled in the New York College of Music in 1902 and in 1903 went abroad to study music in Germany. He took up permanent residence in London, where he began writing songs for British musical hall productions. A year later, he returned to New York, taking jobs with music publishers — first the Lyceum Publishing Company and then Shapiro-Remick. At this time, British productions dominated Broadway. Kern was hired in 1904 to adapt one of these shows, “Mr. Wix of Wickham,” for the Broadway stage by “Americanizing” some of the numbers and by writing some additional songs of his own.\n\nA year later, Kern took a job at another music publisher, T. B. Harms & Co. — which eventually became the publisher of his own works –and continued writing musical interpolations for British shows. Ewen noted that “almost a hundred of his songs were heard this way, in approximately thirty musicals. … [This] apprenticeship prepared him for giant tasks and acievements that lay before him.”\n\nIn 1915 Kern began writing musicals for the Princess Theatre in New York.\n\nThe 1910s were a productive and noteworthy period for Kern. He married an English woman, Eva Leale, in 1910 and in 1914 had his first hit, “The Girl from Utah” — another adaptation of a British show. In 1915 Kern began writing musicals for the Princess Theatre in New York. These productions, “Nobody Home,” “Very Good Eddie,” “Oh Boy!,” and “Oh Lady! Lady!!,” were distinguished by a new approach to musical theater, developed by Kern in collaboration with librettist Guy Bolton, and, beginning in 1917, the talents of lyricist P. G. Wodehouse.\n\nThe musical revue format, with unrelated numbers strung together, was replaced by a more coherent story, more sophisticated songs, and characters that were more believable and realistic. The transformation of the Broadway musical did not happen overnight, however, and Kern also wrote the music for more conventional shows, including “Leave It to Jane,” “Sally,” which included the popular “Look for the Silver Lining,” and “Sunny.”\n\nKern wrote his most important work, “Show Boat,” in 1927 with lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II. The production, which included the songs “Ol’ Man River,” “Can’t Help Lovin’ Dat Man,” and “Make Believe,” is notable for the richness of its music and its influence on other Broadway composers, who saw it as a model of writing for the musical stage. Today some believe it reflects racist attitudes; protesters tried to ban a 1993 revival in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, but the production went on to great success and re-opened on Broadway in 1994.\n\nA close examination of “Show Boat” reveals that it is actually quite progressive for a show that was written in 1927. The plot, involving a woman who is prohibited from performing on the show boat because she is bi-racial and is married to a white man, is compelling, as is the song “Ol’ Man River,” which is the complete antithesis of the more upbeat tunes popular at a time when many whites did not wish to acknowledge their injustice to African Americans. “Show Boat” was made into a film musical three times — in 1929, 1936, and 1951. In 1954 it became part of the New York City Opera’s standard repertory — the first musical to be adopted by an opera company.\n\nThe 1930s saw a string of Kern musicals: “The Cat and the Fiddle”; “Music in the Air”; “Roberta,” which was made into a film starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in 1935 and which included the song “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes”; the Astaire/Rogers film musical SWING TIME, featuring “A Fine Romance” and the Oscar-winning “The Way You Look Tonight”; and VERY WARM FOR MAY, which was a flop but from which the song “All the Things You Are” — perhaps Kern’s best song, if not the best popular song by any composer — survives.\n\nIn the 1940s Kern moved to Hollywood and devoted the rest of his career to writing music for films. He contributed the songs “The Last Time I Saw Paris” to LADY, BE GOOD, “Dearly Beloved” to YOU WERE NEVER LOVELIER, and “Long Ago and Far Away” to COVER GIRL. He died in New York in 1945; his last score was for the film CENTENNIAL SUMMER, which was released in 1946.\n\nMost of Kern’s manuscripts were assumed for decades to be lost. But in 1982 hundreds of manuscripts by Kern and other Broadway composers were found in a warehouse in Secaucus, New Jersey. In an article in THE NEW YORK TIMES on March 10, 1987, the year that the manuscripts were inventoried after having been moved to Manhattan, Kern scholar John McGlinn was quoted as saying that the discovery was “like opening the tomb of King Tut. There are major works here that had been presumed lost forever; shows that were never revived and were assumed to have vanished off the face of the earth.” Included among the findings were the complete scores for “Very Good Eddie,” “Leave It to Jane,” and “Sunny,” and the original manuscripts of “Ol’ Man River,” “Can’t Help Lovin’ Dat Man,” and music that was cut from “Show Boat” after the 1927 production. This “lost” music was added to a 1988 recording of “Show Boat,” restoring the musical to its original glory.\n\nSource: Excerpted from CONTEMPORARY MUSICIANS, VOLUME 13, Gale Research, © 1994 Gale Research.

He had some successes in the early ’50s with various lyricists before meeting Fred Ebb (b. April 8, 1932, New York, USA) in 1962. Ebb had already dabbled with lyric writing, and had collaborated with Jerry Herman on some songs for the short-lived musical “A to Z” (1960). Among Kander and Ebb’s first efforts were “My Coloring Book” and “I Don’t Care Much,” both of which were recorded by Barbra Streisand. The new team made their Broadway debut in 1965 with the score for “Flora, the Red Menace,” which included an eye-catching, Tony Award-winning performance by Liza Minnelli, who would subsequently perform much of their work, and become indelibly associated with them.\n\nIn 1991 they were inducted into the New York Theater Hall of Fame.\n\nAlthough “Flora” was relatively unsuccessful, Kander and Ebb were invited to write the score for “Cabaret” (1966), which starred Joel Grey and Jill Haworth, and won seven Tony Awards, including best score.They wrote two additional songs, “Money, Money” and “Mein Herr,” for the 1972 film version, in which Liza Minnelli gave a sensational performance and won an Oscar. The television special produced by Ebb for Minnelli, LIZA WITH A Z, also won an Emmy award, with a Grammy later going to the recorded highlights album. Ebb’s television work continued with the production of OL’ BLUE EYES IS BACK (1972) for Frank Sinatra. Other Broadway shows followed, including “The Happy Time,” “Zorba,” “70,” “Girls,” and “Chicago,” which opened in 1975 and ran for 923 performances. In the same year, the duo wrote some songs for the film FUNNY LADY, which starred Barbra Streisand, and followed this with music for two Minnelli films, A MATTER OF TIME (1976) and NEW YORK, NEW YORK (1977). The theme from the latter became an enormous, enduring hit for Frank Sinatra in 1980. Back on Broadway, Kander and Ebb wrote scores for “The Act” (1977) with Minnelli, “Woman of the Year” (1981), which starred Lauren Bacall, and “The Rink” (1984), yet another Minnelli (and Chita Rivera) vehicle. In 1991 they were inducted into the New York Theater Hall of Fame, and a revue, “And the World Goes ‘Round,” which celebrated some 30 of their songs, opened Off Broadway and ran for nearly a year. Another musical anthology, “Sing Happy,” played on the London Fringe in the following year. In 1993 their spectacular musical “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” starring Chita Rivera, won several Tony Awards in New York following its transfer from the West End.\n\nJohn Kander and Fred Ebb\n\nKey Shows\n\n\"Cabaret\"\n\n\"Chicago\"\n\n\"The Happy Time\"\n\n\"Kiss of the Spider Woman\"\n\n\"Woman of the Year\"\n\n\"Zorba\"\n\nRelated Artists\n\nBoris Aronson\n\nBob Fosse\n\nJoel Grey\n\nHarold Prince\n\nBebe Neuwirth\n\nJerry Orbach\n\nAnn Reinking\n\nChita Rivera\n\nPeter Stone\n\nGwen Verdon\n\nDuring the 1996-97 Broadway season, a superb concert version of the 20-year-old “Chicago” won six Tonys, while “Steel Pier,” a new Kander and Ebb musical about a dance marathon held in Atlantic City in 1933 at the height of the depression, failed to convert any of its 11 nominations, and closed after only two months. In 1996, the songwriters were among the recipients of the Stage Directors & Choreographers Foundation’s 12th annual Mr. Abbott Awards. It was an appropriate gesture, because George Abbott directed Kander and Ebb’s first Broadway musical, “Flora, the Red Menace.” The two men were also recipients of Kennedy Center Honors in 1998.Apart from their work together, both Kander and Ebb have enjoyed successful independent careers. Kander has written music for film soundtracks, including KRAMER VS. KRAMER (1980), and Ebb has continued to produce and co-produce numerous television specials, including GYPSY IN MY SOUL (1976) and BARYSHNIKOV ON BROADWAY (1980).\n\nFURTHER READING:\n\nCOLORED LIGHTS: FORTY YEARS OF WORDS AND MUSIC, John Kander and Fred Ebb with Greg Lawrence.\n\nSHOW BIZ, COLLABORATION, AND ALL THAT JAZZ, John Kander and Fred Ebb with Greg Lawrence.\n\nSource: Biographical information provided by MUZE.

After high school, he started to train as a designer, but had second thoughts, and studied drama at the University of Miami. By the mid-’50s, he was playing piano in New York clubs and writing material for several well-known entertainers. During the late ’50s and early ’60s, he worked on a number of off-Broadway musical shows, the first of which was “I Feel Wonderful” (1954), and had several songs in the revue “Nightcap,” which ran for nearly a year. He also wrote the book, music and lyrics [for] — and directed — “Parade” (1960), and in the same year contributed the opening number, “Best Gold,” to the short-lived “A to Z.” In 1961, after writing some songs for the 13-performance flop, “Madame Aphrodite,” he enjoyed his first real success with his score for the Broadway musical “Milk and Honey,” which ran for 543 performances. He had a smash hit three years later with “Hello, Dolly!” (“Before the Parade Passes By,” “It Only Takes a Moment,” “It Takes a Woman,” “Put on Your Sunday Clothes,” “Elegance”), which stayed at the St. James Theater in New York for nearly seven years. The show — with its Grammy-winning title number — gave Carol Channing her greatest role, and has been constantly revived ever since.\n\nJerry Herman\n\nKey Shows\n\n\"The Grand Tour\"\n\n\"Hello, Dolly!\"\n\n\"La Cage aux Folles\"\n\n\"Mack & Mabel\"\n\n\"Mame\"\n\n\"Milk and Honey\"\n\nRelated Artists\n\nCarol Channing\n\nHarvey Fierstein\n\nGower Champion\n\nAngela Lansbury\n\nArthur Laurents\n\nJoel Grey\n\nEthel Merman\n\nDavid Merrick\n\nIn 1966, Herman had another triumph with “Mame,” which is generally considered to be his best score. Once again, there was a marvelous title song, which was accompanied by other delights such as “If He Should Walk Into My Life,” “We Need a Little Christmas,” “Open a New Window,” “Bosom Buddies,” and “It’s Today.” Since then, his infrequent, but classy scores have included “Dear World” (“And I Was Beautiful,” “The Spring of Next Year,” 1969), “Mack & Mabel” (“I Won’t Send Roses,” “When Mabel Comes in the Room,” “Movies Were Movies,” 1974), “The Grand Tour” (1979), and “La Cage aux Folles” (“Song on the Sand [La Da Da Da],” “With You on My Arm,” “I Am What I Am”). The latter show opened in 1983, and ran for 1,176 performances in New York. Herman won a Grammy for the “Mame” cast album, and Tony Awards for his work on “Hello, Dolly!” and “La Cage aux Folles.” There was some controversy when Herman’s “old fashioned” music and lyrics for the latter show triumphed over Stephen Sondheim’s typically contemporary score for “Sunday in the Park with George.” Herman has been inducted into the Theater Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. The latter organization honored him with their Johnny Mercer Award in 1987, and in 1996, he received a lifetime achievement award from the Hollywood Press Club. Herman occasionally presents an evening devoted to his own songs, and many shows have been staged in tribute to him over the years, including “Jerry’s Girls,” which played on Broadway in 1986.\n\nIn 1993, Herman left New York to live in Bel Air on the West Coast, but denied rumors of retirement, explaining that his 10-year absence had been due to lack of inspiration: “Nothing has come along that is fresh and interesting.” Revivals of his earlier works, with which he is usually closely involved, are constantly circulating. In the early ’90s, these included U.S. regional productions of “La Cage aux Folles” and “Mame,” as well as a 30th anniversary international tour of “Hello, Dolly!”, complete with its original leading lady, Carol Channing, which reached Broadway in October 1995.\n\nHe enjoyed his first real success with his score for the Broadway musical “Milk and Honey,”\n\nTwo months later, Herman’s personal favorite of all his own shows, “Mack & Mabel,” made its West End debut. Herman’s “dry” spell finally came to an end in December 1996, when the two-hour musical, MRS. SANTA CLAUS, was transmitted on CBS television. The composer’s first creative contribution to the medium, it starred the original Auntie Mame, Angela Lansbury. Among the highlights of Herman’s score were “Almost Young,” “We Don’t Go Together,” “He Needs Me,” “Avenue A,” and “Whistle.” There was no mention of his recent triple bypass and other health problems when in 1998 Herman was joined by old friends Lee Roy Reams and Florence Lacey on stage at the Booth Theater in New York, playing and singing a mixture of his familiar and not so w"
