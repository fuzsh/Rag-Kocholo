        "text": "Message Board Archives\n\nOnly Cricket Captain We Had\n\nRaggs\n\nto built a winning team and then rebuild it, is Clive Loyld. I read Andy Roberts saying recently that the Big Cat stumble upon the four fast men nuclear head war weapon but I don't believe that.\n\nLarr Pullo\n\nIn reply to Raggs\n\nAndy does just talk for talk sake sometimes...\n\nsudden\n\ntoo many people confuse happenstance with Lloyd's genius\n\nwhile Lloyd molded and perhaps developed a v good team a lot of that can be attributed to the period.\n\nLarr Pullo\n\nIn reply to sudden\n\nNo Empire was ever built through \"happenstance\".\n\nsudden\n\nIn reply to Larr Pullo\n\nnot true at all.\n\ntaking advantage of what was available (happenstance) and molding and developing it, which Lloyd did, is a sign of v good leadership for which he should be commended\n\nStumpCam\n\nIn reply to sudden\n\nSo, like Lloyd, Sammy took advantage of what was available??\n\nStumpCam\n\nIn reply to sudden\n\nSo, like Lloyd, Sammy took advantage of what was available??\n\nHow come Lara couldnt take advantage of Ambrose, Walsh etc??!\n\nSnoopDog\n\nIn reply to StumpCam\n\nSo, like Lloyd, Sammy took advantage of what was available??\n\nLloyd wasn't a specialist captain, unlike the clapper.\n\nRaggs\n\nLara etc...can't build nothing to defend nothing. Ambrose, Walsh, King, Dillion etc...etc...Jacobs, Chanderpaul enough talent was there to mould and build upon. maybe not to be world champs but compete and give oppositions a real tussle.\n\nIf The Big Cat was purring now he'll get some milk outta de black coffee.\n\nInHindsight\n\nA lot of what Lloyd got happened by chance and cannot truly be attributed to him.\n\nNot all tho.\n\nHe wasn't any genius.\n\ncamos\n\nI have criticized a lot of things Lloyd did, but as captain he was almost perfect, no other has come close!\n\nDukes\n\nA lot of what Lloyd got happened by chance and cannot truly be attributed to him.\n\nIs the above statement based on your personal knowledge or from your perusal of the media.\n\nThe reason I ask is because I was very close to Clive from between 1973 to 1983 when I left the UK and I certainly did not get that impression.\n\nJOJO\n\nIn reply to sudden\n\ntaking advantage of what was available (happenstance) and molding and developing it, which Lloyd did, is a sign of v good leadership for which he should be commended\n\nCorrect. Thats why I do not subscribe to the notion that certain leaders failed because their ideas and policies were ahead of its time. Leaders have to know and understand what time  it is and adjust accordingly.\n\nVoopsandOut\n\nI am not fighting any battles for Lara but how was the team ranked during his captaincy? Was it as low as we are right now? i think that the mark of good leadership is being constantly able to get the best out of whatever resources you have. Lloyd had great resources and he did not squander them. Can we say that we are getting the best out of what we have right now?\n\nFuzzyWuzzy\n\nIn reply to VoopsandOut\n\nWould you say after the 5 - 1 drubbing by Australia in 1975/76 that we had great resources? If yes why they were so badly beaten? If no, who gets the credit for turning them into great resources?\n\nI feel Kerry Packer org.had a lot to do with it. The hard nosed businessman who gave them Dennis Waight must get some credit of turning good amateurs into good professionals.\n\nLloyd must be credited for buying into that vision and the rest is history. Btw. It helped that he like Worrell was seen as a father figure to the young guns. Btw I agree with Andy that Lloyd didn't go anywhere seeking out fast bowling talent, it just happened to be around.\n\nLarr Pullo\n\nIn reply to FuzzyWuzzy\n\nReally? Lloyd could have ignored a Holding who got hammered in the one FC game that he played against Guyana, but he had a discerning eye and saw the raw material rife for developing. So alyuh kill that shite that talent just \"happened\" to be around.\n\nsudden\n\nIn reply to JOJO\n\nExactly\n\ncamos\n\nIn reply to Larr Pullo\n\nAdd to that there was a feeling of justice, people believed if they were good enough, they would be picked.\n\nFuzzyWuzzy\n\nIn reply to Larr Pullo\n\nLloyd felt the same \"thing \" about Michael Worrell and recently Jason Holder\n\nHolding thing is am anomaly\n\nLloyd was roundly criticized by greenidge after Australia drubbing\n\ncamos\n\nIn reply to FuzzyWuzzy\n\nLloyd was roundly criticized by greenidge after Australia drubbing\n\nthe greenidge Viv had to open for?\n\nDrapsey\n\nIn reply to Larr Pullo\n\nReally? Lloyd could have ignored a Holding who got hammered in the one FC game that he played against Guyana, but he had a discerning eye and saw the raw material rife for developing. So alyuh kill that shite that talent just \"happened\" to be around.\n\nThere was also that game at Sabina Park where some writer or the other thought Lloyd menacingly advanced towards Holding after he was peppered with a few bouncers, one landing in the rib cage. According to him (the writer) that was what (the incident, that is) got him the pick for the OZ tour.\n\nFuzzyWuzzy\n\nIn reply to camos\n\nYes that same greenidge who went on to be a great.\n\nDidn't viv not open for Lawrenc Rowe and Alvin kalicharran?\n\nsudden\n\nIn reply to FuzzyWuzzy\n\nDisappointed in you to pay that guy any attention. Tell him to post more than 2 sentences\n\ncamos\n\nIn reply to FuzzyWuzzy\n\nDidn't viv not open for Lawrenc Rowe and Alvin kalicharran?\n\nboth guys were #3 and #4 not openers, greenidge was supposed to accompany Freddo!\n\nDukes\n\nIn reply to FuzzyWuzzy\n\nBtw I agree with Andy that Lloyd didn't go anywhere seeking out fast bowling talent, it just happened to be around.\n\nI will mention one name and ask you to tell this message board about that person.\n\nBALFOUR PATRICK PATTERSON\n\nWhen IGNORANCE IS BLISS......................................\n\nsudden\n\nIn reply to Dukes\n\nDo you disagree with Roberts, Dukes?\n\nRaggs\n\nso the critics may want to say that Clive Loyld couldn't get a tune of this current crop? I surely think he could.\n\nFuzzyWuzzy\n\nIn reply to Dukes\n\nCondescension is your stock in trade but was Patterson a member of the famed four prong?\n\nAnd getting 1 right proves the case?\n\nSo when did he loose this skill, cause we can't reproduce a four prong.\n\nDukes\n\nIn reply to sudden\n\nDo you disagree with Roberts, Dukes?\n\nVEHEMENTLY BUT I understand his bitterness and feel sorry for him.\n\nDukes\n\nIn reply to FuzzyWuzzy\n\nwas Patterson a member of the famed four prong?\n\nThat is a non-sequitur and is a distraction.\n\nthe statement below I attribute to you and is quite clearly wrong.\n\nBtw I agree with Andy that Lloyd didn't go anywhere seeking out fast bowling talent,\n\nThe statement below is clearly an attempt to quantify a qualitative reality which some might see as moving the goalpost.\n\nAnd getting 1 right proves the case?\n\nI am a virgin.\n\nBut you just had a baby\n\nI only had sex once\n\nThat is my analogy to your contributions.\n\nHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nsudden\n\nIn reply to Dukes\n\nwhat about these statements?\n\nwhile Lloyd molded and perhaps developed a v good team a lot of that can be attributed to the period.\n\ntaking advantage of what was available (happenstance) and molding and developing it, which Lloyd did, is a sign of v good leadership for which he should be commended\n\nDukes\n\nIn reply to sudden\n\nYOU ARE BEING LAWYERLY IN TRYING TO TEASE OUT SPECIFIC STATEMENTS THAT ARE TRUE AND LEAVE OUT THE GENERAL THRUST OF HIS STATEMENT.\n\nWhat I vehemently disagree with Andy about is his attempt to downgrade the important role that Clive Lloyd played in developing, nurturing and introducing the concept that you play your best four bowlers and if they all happened to be fast bowlers then so be it.\n\nAndy Roberts and Clive Lloyd were very good friends between 1974 and 1983 but Andy became resentful following the defeat in the 1983 World Cup Final when words were exchanged and then on the subsequent tour of India later that year when he responded to being dropped like a petulant child and refused to speak to Clive.Mikey Holding who was and remains a close friend of both men, dances around this topic like the ballerina that his action mimics.\n\nDukes\n\nDUP{LICATE\n\nsudden\n\nIn reply to Dukes\n\nin your own way you said the same thing i did\n\ni didnt know about Andy and Clive's falling out but i do believe Andy's statement is not false on the face of it\n\nhubert\n\nA popular Trini saying is' cockroach aint bizness in a folw fight. Not being a Trini I will venture to say the following.\n\nAfter the infamous loss to India who chased down over 400 to win the 3rd Test at QPO in 1976, Clive Lloyd vowed to turn to\n\npace as his main weapon against all comers.\n\nRoberts who was rested for that Test as three specialists spinners were used, as well as the final Test ,another famous one at Sabina Park.\n\nEnter young Wayne 'Diamond' Daniel all but 20 years old to partner with Holding at Bina.\n\nHe learned a lot after that 5-1 drubbing at the hands of Lilian Thomson and friends in a few months before.\n\nLloyd was good to his word in charting a pace bettery. Croft and Garner came to the fore the following year and replaced Holding who missed the entire\n\nPakistan series and the rest is history.\n\nLloyd was instrumental in Patrick Patterson's development as he got him a contract with Lancashire and led to his attachment in Tasmania as he developed\n\nin body,pace and experience. This after Jamaica put him aside after his initial games.\n\nIf C Hubert Lloyd did not exactly beat the bushes looking for Pacers as one George Headley did, he was quick to get promising ones at the forefront.\n\nThat is undeniable. As they like to say .'give Jack his jacket'. A new day dawned in West Indies cricket. Lloyd had a plan, a vision ,committed to it\n\nand carried it through to brilliant fulfilment.\n\nWhat a legacy !\n\nWe yearn for someone else to emerge in similar vein."
