You can help by expanding it with reliably sourced entries.\n\nThe following list contains scores or songs which are the primary theme music of a television series or miniseries. They are sorted alphabetically by the television series' title. Any themes, scores, or songs which are billed under a different name than their respective television series' title are shown in parentheses, except in cases where they are officially billed as \"Theme from [Series' Name]\", \"[Series' Name] Theme\", etc., which are omitted. This list does not include television series whose broadcast run was less than ten episodes (i.e. a \"failed\" series) unless officially designated as a television miniseries. In cases where more than one piece of music was used for the main theme during the broadcast run of a television series (Baywatch, Happy Days, Starsky & Hutch, for example), only the most widely recognized score is listed.[1][2][3]\n\n0 – 9\n\n[edit]\n\n100 Things To Do Before High School (\"Brand New Day\") – Isabela Moner[4]\n\n12 O'Clock High - Dominic Frontiere\n\n2 Broke Girls (\"Second Chance\") - Peter Bjorn and John\n\n2Point4Children - Howard Goodall\n\n2000 Malibu Road – James Newton Howard\n\n21 Jump Street – composed by Liam Sternberg; performed by Holly Robinson\n\n227 (\"There's No Place Like Home\") – Ray Colcord, performed by Marla Gibbs\n\n24 – Sean Callery\n\n240-Robert – Mike Post and Pete Carpenter\n\n3-2-1 Contact – Tom Anthony\n\n3-2-1 Penguins!
