        "text": "Recent other film and television work includes drama series such as Our House, The Drowning, Hollington Drive, Dark Money, and Prey, while her documentary work includes The Great British School Swap, feature documentary She’s French (Chalfont Productions), the RTS winning Behind Closed Doors: Through The Eyes of The Child for BBC2, BBC mental health documentary Girls On The Edge, and Channel 4’s moving and insightful Can Cannabis Save Our Son? featuring Gogglebox stars Steph and Dom Parker; a documentary which looks at the effects of medical Marijuana on epilepsy.\n\nSarah is a graduate of the National Film and Television School. Prior to this, Sarah gained a degree in English Literature at Oxford University, which is where she developed her love for narrative and drama. Subsequently she studied contemporary and electronic music composition at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. Though trained initially as a classical harpist and pianist, her music and sonic installations explore a wide variety of genres and musical techniques, both traditional and experimental. Her innovative use of electronics is nowhere better demonstrated than in her score for Humans, although her writing often fuses electronics with acoustic instruments and she is skilled at orchestration. Whether composing with melodic lyricism or crafting a subtle textural underscore, drama and storytelling is always at the core of what Sarah creates.\n\nBeyond her television work, Sarah has scored a number of award winning short films which have been selected at numerous international festivals across the world including Cannes, Paris, Milan, Toronto, Palm Springs, LA, London, New York, Edinburgh, Berlin, Cologne, Talca, Leipzig, Ozu and Rio, to name a few. She also works extensively with projection artist Rupert Newman, creating light and sound installations both in the UK and abroad. Her Installation work with him has included an interactive installation for Bombay Sapphire Gin in London, lighting up the Four Seasons in Florence, Italy, a Sarah Haywood designed wedding at the Vaux le Vicomte Chateux in France, and lighting up a 48 foot ski jump in Cortina, Italy. London exhibits have taken place at prestigious venues including The Tramshed, The Hospital Club, The House of St. Barnabas, The Rook and Raven Gallery in Soho, The Crate in Notting Hill, and The Royal College of Art."
