        "text": "Andrew March was born in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, United Kingdom in 1973. In 1992, he was accepted at the Royal College of Music to study composition with Jeremy Dale Roberts. He graduated in 1996, gaining a Bachelor of Music degree with honors.\n\nIn 1998, his orchestral piece Marine – à travers les arbres (Marine – through the trees) received first prize in the first ever Masterprize International Composing Competition. This orchestral work has since received a total of 13 international live performances, including the London Symphony Orchestra, the Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra and the European Union Youth Orchestra under Vladimir Ashkenazy. For his first commission, Andrew wrote a challenging work: A Stirring in the Heaven lies, which was premiered in December 2000 by the London Symphony Orchestra at the Barbican Hall.\n\nMarch has written a considerable amount of choral music, mostly a cappella. In December 2005, the chapel choir of Corpus Christi College in Cambridge recorded and released a commercial CD containing 7 of his unaccompanied motets. March’s music has been recorded by the BBC, the European Broadcasting Union and for EMI Classics Debut Series at Abbey Road Studios in London. Selected works have been published and are available from Walton Music Corporation (and Hal Leonard), the Royal School of Church Music, and in the case of Marine – à travers les arbres, from Chester Novello."
