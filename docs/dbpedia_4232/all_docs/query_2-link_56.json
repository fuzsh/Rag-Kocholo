Music and Mind. 100 Units.\n\nThis course explores research on music in the mind and brain sciences as it has developed over the past three decades. During this time, we have come to an increasingly refined understanding of the ways the brain processes sound. It remains the case, however, that not all sound is music, and in this course we will investigate how musical sound is organized to make it musical, and how this organization reflects the capacities of the human mind. Interactive lectures (Mondays and Wednesdays) and discussion sections (Fridays) will engage both scientific and humanistic literature. Among the topics the class will engage are the origins and functions of music, absolute pitch, music and memory, how music shapes emotional responses, movement and music, connections between music and images, and the relationship between music and language.\n\nInstructor(s): Lawrence Zbikowski\n\nEquivalent Course(s): SIGN 26066\n\nMUSI 21800.

Oral Performance and Gender from the Middle Ages to Slam Poetry. 100 Units.\n\nItalian culture has been continuously enriched by oral artistic practices. While the written page has allowed these practices to endure over time, they were also, and often primarily, transmitted through the bodies of performers. Is it possible to reconstruct the voices beyond the page? How does thinking about performance enhance our understanding of the artistic product and, moreover, of the society where this product originated? What are the political implications of the binary division between the written page and the human voice? Why are oral practices largely excluded from the literary canon? Is there a correlation between marginalized oral practices and queerness? The content of this course will consist of various Italian oral practices, ranging from the courtly lyric poetry of the Middle Ages to the contemporary spoken word scene. Additionally, the course will focus on female and queer voices, with the goal of tracing a parallel between the ephemerality of performances and the marginalization of communities. The course will integrate artistic content with theoretical material on the topic of voice, as well as insights from feminist and queer studies, media studies, and performance theory. At the end of the course, students will produce their own creative project with the purpose of answering the following question: how does thinking about performance from a practical point of view help to inform our understanding of performance from a theoretical perspective?\n\nInstructor(s): Alessandro Minnucci Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): Class will be conducted in English with a separate discussion section available for students seeking credit for the Italian major/minor. Readings will be in Italian and in English.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): TAPS 20223, GNSE 24125, ITAL 23125\n\nMUSI 23221. Music in the Indian Ocean. 100 Units.\n\nIn this course, we gather sound and music to afford new ways to understand the history and culture of a geographical region. Instead of an area study, we concern ourselves with listening to sound worlds, local and global. We balance the reading of primary and secondary sources-the writings of travelers and practitioners alongside theoretical treatises and modern ethnomusicological scholarship-with the different listening practices, especially collections and assemblages of recorded sound and film. Each student will develop her or his own means of entering different sound worlds. Accordingly, students with varying degrees of musical background will be able to navigate the Indian Ocean World in ways suitable to their own backgrounds and interests. Students from the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Divinity are welcome. Both College students and graduate students may register for the course, with the only distinction being in the scope of the final project.\n\nInstructor(s): Phil Bohlman Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RLST 28221, SALC 33221, RLVC 33221, SALC 23221, MUSI 33221\n\nMUSI 23300. Introduction to the Social and Cultural Study of Music. 100 Units.\n\nThis course provides an introduction to ethnomusicology and related disciplines with an emphasis on the methods and contemporary practice of social and cultural analysis. The course reviews a broad selection of writing on non-Western, popular, vernacular, and \"world-music\" genres from a historical and theoretical perspective, clarifying key analytical terms (i.e., \"culture,\" \"subculture,\" \"style,\" \"ritual,\" \"globalization\") and methods (i.e., ethnography, semiotics, psychoanalysis, Marxism). In the last part of the course, students learn and develop component skills of fieldwork documentation and ethnographic writing.\n\nTerms Offered: Spring\n\nMUSI 23321. Bollywood Beats: Music and Sound in Popular Hindi Cinema. 100 Units.\n\nThis course explores the music and sound of popular Hindi cinema from aesthetic, social, cultural, economic, historical, and political perspectives. Students will be introduced to the musical conventions and practices of the genre, and to changes in Bollywood musical style over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries. We will watch select films with keen attention to music's imbrication with cinematic visuality, narrative, technology, and dance, and with consideration of issues like emplacement, gender, caste, religion, capitalism, nationalism, and transnationalism. Bollywood is a cosmopolitan music, drawing from and contributing to a range of regional and international music practices; we also venture into some of those streams.\n\nInstructor(s): Anna Schultz Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): SALC 33321, SALC 23321, CMST 23321, MUSI 33321, CMST 33321\n\nMUSI 23322. Setting Sound Standards: Music, Media, and Censorship in South Asia. 100 Units.\n\nThis course aims to introduce students to various musical and performance traditions in South Asia and their evolution within regimes of institutional, legal and media censorship. The course aims to understand how media environments and cultures of censorship are in some ways fundamental to shaping performance cultures in South Asia in the twentieth century. How do traditions of musical performance entrenched in the politics of caste, communalism, religion, sexuality and gender interact with regimes of censorship and new media? How do the latter remake and unmake said traditions? Be it the mid-century ban on film music by All India Radio to reflect the aspirations of a newly-emerging nation or the appropriation and urbanization of 'folk' musical practices within the recording studios in Nepal by upper-caste, upper-class male performers- censorship and media infrastructures have been integral to the current ontologies of diverse musical genres in South Asia. Through the analysis of a variety of primary and secondary texts on performance and musical aesthetics, media and music ethnographies, reception and production histories as well as critical listening/viewing exercises, this course seeks to complicate mainstream Euro-American narratives that tend to posit media-modernities as global and uniform. We will seek to understand how South Asian musical cultures and sound practices enter into a creative interplay with musical discourses and media-materialities emerging in the West.\n\nInstructor(s): Ronit Ghosh Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MADD 10325, SALC 25325, TAPS 20215\n\nMUSI 23324. The Human Form in Contemporary Art. 100 Units.\n\nIn a present where humanity faces planetary challenges with an unprecedented urgency, the human form - what Marx calls our \"genus-being\" (Gattungswesen) - has become a focus for artistic production of all sorts. The thesis of the class is this: Contemporary art is an actualization of the human form that doesn't presuppose the form, doesn't take it for granted, but instead troubles the form and poses it as a question. The class considers presentations of the form in performance art (Tino Sehgal, Anne Imhof, Wu Tsang), sculpture (Kara Walker, Cai Guo-Qiang, Cecilia Vicuña), writing (Friederike Mayröcker, Layli Long Soldier, Tracie Morris), sound (Maria Chavez, Christina Kubisch, Samson Young), and painting (Michael Armitage, Tammy Nguyen, Mark Bradford). The class contextualizes these artists with theoretical work by Sylvia Wynter, Donna Haraway, Bruno Latour, Peter Sloterdijk, Dipesh Chakrabarty, Jane Bennett, Achille Mbembe, Eva Horn, and Emanuele Coccia. Readings and discussion in English.\n\nInstructor(s): Florian Klinger Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARTH 23324, CMLT 23324, GRMN 23324\n\nMUSI 23410. Music of the Middle East. 100 Units.\n\nHistorically one of the most complex and contested regions in the world, Israel/Palestine has a music culture that bears witness to processes of connection and separation. The politics of music in Israel/Palestine grow from conflicted beliefs about authenticity and ownership, the sounds of difference and sameness. The sacred and the secular intersect, and boundaries of practice and genre both divide and unite. Local practices have never been independent of global movement, be it in diaspora, pilgrimage, or the distant residence of refugees. The musical landscape of the region, therefore, has shifted throughout history, accessible primarily through the archaeology of music scholarship. In this proseminar we shall look at specific moments when the musics of Israel/Palestine converged, responding to and shaping historical change and conflict. We shall explore musical repertories and practices of all kinds, whether sacred or secular, vernacular or élite.\n\nInstructor(s): Erol Koymen Terms Offered: Winter. Israel/Palestine\n\nPrerequisite(s): 100-level music course or consent of instructor.\n\nNote(s): Students in the College and graduate students from Humanities, Social Sciences, and the Divinity School will all be welcome. The course will intersect with the Center for Middle Eastern Studies and the Greenberg Center for Jewish Studies. The ability to read music is not a prerequisite, though familiarity with some way of understanding and discussing sound in its many contexts will be helpful.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): JWSC 23410, MUSI 33410\n\nMUSI 23509. Eurovision. 100 Units.\n\nEach May since 1956 popular musicians and fans from Europe gather in a European metropolis to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC), a competitive spectacle in which musicians from one nation compete against one another. Organized, funded, and broadcast by the European Broadcasting Union, the largest conglomerate of national radio and television networks in the world, the ESC is extensively participatory, creating its own communities of fans, musicians, musical producers, and ordinary citizens, who join together at all levels of society to interact with the politics and historical narratives of Europe. From the moment of heightened Cold War conflict at the birth of ESC to the refugee crisis and the rise of right-wing nationalism in the present, ESC has generated public discourse that not only reflects European and global politics, but provides a conduit for local and national citizenries to respond and shape such public discourse about gender and sexuality. The weekly work for the course draws students from across the College into the counterpoint of history and politics with aesthetics and popular culture. Each week will be divided into two parts, the first dedicated to reading and discussion of texts about European history and politics from World War II to the present, the second to interaction with music. Students will experience the ESC through close readings of individual songs and growing familiarity with individual nations with a participatory final project.\n\nInstructor(s): P.

Performing the U.S. Supreme Court. 100 Units.\n\nHow do American Supreme Court justices engage with performance? How do performing artists engage with the United States Supreme Court? This class explores the intersections between music, theater, dance, and \"the highest court of the land.\" We will discuss how the court has defined \"performance\" in various intellectual property and arts-related opinions. We will analyze recent justices' own performances in the courtroom, at the Washington National Opera, and on the salsa dance floor. And we will watch, listen to, and interpret songs, operas, plays, and films that set the text of Supreme Court opinions. By the end of the quarter, students should understand how performance shapes the making and the memory of American law, and how law shapes the concept and the content of artistic performance. Weekly readings and screenings will include excerpts from secondary sources, Supreme Court oral arguments and opinions, and musical and theatrical performances. To gain experience both reading law and presenting in public, students will perform a short spoken, danced, and/or musical setting of a Supreme Court opinion (this can be an existing artistic setting or one of students' own devising), and will write a five-page paper analyzing how their chosen artistic setting inflects the judicial rhetoric of the opinion.\n\nInstructor(s): C. Dowd Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): TAPS 20240\n\nMUSI 23706. Music of South Asia. 100 Units.\n\nThe course explores some of the music traditions that hail from South Asia-a region defined by the countries of India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Afghanistan, Maldives, and their diasporas. The course will study music and some of its inextricably linked forms of dance and theatre through the lens of ethnomusicology, where music is considered in its social and cultural contexts. Students will develop tools to listen, analyze, watch, and participate in South Asian forms of music-making, using case-study based inquiries as guides along the way.\n\nInstructor(s): Anna Schultz\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RLST 27700, SALC 20800, SALC 30800, MUSI 33706\n\nMUSI 23804. Rock. 100 Units.\n\nThis course has as its focus the varied social agents, discourses, processes and institutions that contribute to current and historical understandings of rock. Issues of musical style, questions of historiography, the technologies and techniques of audio recording, the structures of the recording industry, the status of so-called subcultures and mainstreams, and the politics of gender, race and sexuality are among the items which our readings, class discussions and assignments will explore. As such, the inculcation of an \"appreciation\" of rock, the transmission of a canon and the validation of individual musical tastes are projects that are antithetical to our inquiry. Students will also be encouraged, through select readings and listening assignments, to contextualize rock within a broad ﬁeld of twentieth- and twenty-ﬁrst century music-making and attendant social, political and economic processes.\n\nInstructor(s): Travis Jackson\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MUSI 33804\n\nMUSI 24080. New Musical Development: Writing Team. 100 Units.\n\nThis class explores and replicates the professional theatrical process of new musical development, beginning with the concept for a show and ending with its premiere performance as an invited staged reading. Students will serve as book writers, lyricists, composers (Writing Team), and/or directors, music directors, actors, singers, and dramaturgs (Artistic Team) as they work together to craft and polish a new and viable work of musical theater. This class studies the art and theory behind theatrical storytelling, songwriting, directing, and originating new roles as actors, and students will work on their feet each week to bring their unique perspectives and skills to the creation of a new musical script, score, and performance. Creators with any amount of material towards a new musical (a full-length draft, a portion of a script and score, OR an outline) are encouraged to submit their work to selmegreen@uchicago.edu and lbdanzig@uchicago.edu beginning in Spring Quarter 2024, before this course is offered in Fall 2024.

Making and Meaning in the American Musical. 100 Units.\n\nThe history of the American musical in the 20th century is paradoxical. While the genre is often denigrated as staging lyrical utopias of romance and adventure allowing audiences to escape depressing quotidian realities, many musicals did seek to engage some of the most pressing social issues of their day. In this course, we will look-and listen-closely to four differing musicals from the 20th century, studying their creative origins, while also analyzing their complex social meanings revealed through the story, music, lyrics, staging, and dance. An Excursion to a professionally staged Musical later in the quarter is planned.\n\nInstructor(s): Thomas Christensen\n\nEquivalent Course(s): TAPS 28467, SIGN 26009\n\nMUSI 24422.

Students will analyze and discuss character development and dramatic structure across musical theater scripts, scores, and songs, and they will apply these lessons to their own writing. Students will develop treatments and excerpts towards new works of musical theater, and as individuals or in teams they will write, workshop, and present ten-minute musicals at the end of the quarter. No prior experience in script writing or songwriting is required.\n\nInstructor(s): S. Elmegreen Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): TAPS 21810\n\nMUSI 24520. Richard Wagner's Ring of the Nibelung in Performance. 100 Units.\n\nThis seminar, open to undergraduates and beginning graduate students, serves as a critical introduction to and intensive exploration of Richard Wagner's 19th century tetralogy. In addition to critical readings (e.g., by Wagner, Adorno, Nietzsche, Badiou, Dahlhaus, et al.) and screenings of a host of productions, we will travel downtown to Lyric Opera to attend performances of the Ring cycle in David Pountney's new production. Our discussions of the Chicago production will be supplemented by conversations with members of the Lyric Opera production team, including Anthony Freud, Lyric Opera's General Director. No previous knowledge is required although a curiosity about opera, German culture, media history, and/or theater & performance studies will be essential.\n\nInstructor(s): David Levin Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MUSI 32520, CMST 32119, FNDL 23419, GRMN 33419, GRMN 23419, CMST 22119\n\nMUSI 24722. Music and Environment. 100 Units.\n\nOver the last four centuries, how have the creators and practitioners of Western art music imagined nature as a recurring other-a foil to the art and artifice of our human world? This course is a trans-historical survey of the multifaceted relationships between musical creators, audiences, and the natural world. Over the 10-week course we will explore humankind's evolving relationship with the environment, calling upon a diverse array of composers, performers, and artists. While music offers a space in which to contemplate our relationship with nature, the natural world has long offered an opportunity for artists to expand their horizons, suggesting new sonic resources, new ways of performing, and new understandings of temporality. The course is organized in three large modules: listening to the environment, representing the environment, and speaking for the environment. The first introduces a set of listening practices-deep listening and soundwalks-to explore how these listening practices open up a range of possibilities for the interpenetration of natural sounds within musical performances, and musical performances in outdoor spaces. The second module turns our focus toward transliterations of natural phenomena and animal sounds, mediated through instrumental or electronic renderings. The final module examines the ways in which music can engage with, critique, and perform (or fail to perform) environmental activism.\n\nInstructor(s): Clay Mettens Terms Offered: Spring\n\nMUSI 24820. Video Game Music Production and Sound Design. 100 Units.\n\nThe advent of video game soundtrack releases and live game music concerts substantiate the importance of music and sound in games, not just as accompaniments but as essential aspects of the gaming experience. This production course surveys the history of sound effects, music, and design in games beginning with the bleeps and bloops of the 1970s and concluding with the ambient, nonlinear soundscape of many contemporary games. Following the timeline media theorist Karen Collins presents in her documentary Beep, this course will explore electronic sound technologies including virtual analog synthesis, frequency modulation, bit reduction, General MIDI, and sample-based production. Each student will compose a game soundtrack demo for their final project. This course welcomes students who are both new to and experienced in sound production; the complexity of each assignment can be adjusted based on experience.\n\nInstructor(s): Takashi Shallow Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MADD 24820\n\nMUSI 24822. Video Game Music and Sound. 100 Units.\n\nFrom 8-bit audio tracks to orchestral concerts of video game music, from the percussive clicks of keyboards and controllers to menu noises, sound is tightly tied to the experience of playing video games. In this course, we'll explore how game music and sound interact with narrative, the embodiment of play, and musical environments outside of the games themselves. Our engagement with game music and sound will be mostly analytical, but there will be an opportunity for a creative final project for those students who might be interested. No prior music courses are required, although some familiarity with musical terminology and experience playing video games may prove useful.\n\nInstructor(s): Will Myers Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MADD 14822\n\nMUSI 25020. Opera Across Media. 100 Units.\n\nOpen to all undergraduates. Over the course of the last hundred and twenty years, opera and cinema have been sounded and seen together again and again. Where opera is commonly associated with extravagant performance and production, cinema is popularly associated realism. Yet their encounter not only proves these assumptions wrong but produces some extraordinary third kinds-media hybrids. It also produces some extraordinary love affairs. Thomas Edison wanted a film of his to be \"a grand opera,\" and Federico Fellini and Woody Allen wanted opera to saturate their films. Thinking about these mutual attractions, \"Opera across Media\" explores different operatic and cinematic repertories as well as other media forms. Among films to be studied are Pabst's Threepenny Opera (1931), Visconti's Senso (1954), Powell and Pressburger's Tales of Hoffmann (1951), Zeffirelli's La traviata (1981), De Mille's Carmen (1915), Losey's Don Giovanni (1979), Bergman's The Magic Flute (1975), and Fellini's E la nave va (1983). No prior background in music performance, theory, or notation is needed. Students may write papers based on their own skills and interests relevant to the course. Required work includes attendance at all screenings and classes; weekly postings on Canvas about readings and viewings; attendances at a Met HD broadcast and a Lyric Opera live opera; a short \"think piece\" midway through the course; and a final term paper of 8-10 pages.\n\nInstructor(s): Martha Feldman Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): Open to all undergraduates\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MADD 13020, SIGN 26058, GNSE 25020, TAPS 26516, CMST 24617, ITAL 25020\n\nMUSI 25100. Analysis of Music of the Classical Period. 100 Units.\n\nThis course focuses on the compositional norms of the \"galant\" and \"high classical\" styles of the eighteenth century, especially the instrumental music of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. We will approach this repertoire from different angles, engaging literature on Formenlehre, schema theory, rhythm and meter, and topic theory. Ultimately, we will explore how conventions and deviations thereof participate in the construction of musical meaning and expression.\n\nInstructor(s): Various Terms Offered: Winter\n\nPrerequisite(s): MUSI 15300 or equivalent\n\nNote(s): This course is typically offered in alternate years.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MUSI 30809\n\nMUSI 25200. Analysis of Nineteenth-Century Music. 100 Units.\n\nThis course focuses on the tonal language of nineteenth-century European composers, including Schubert, Chopin, Brahms, and Wagner. Students confront analytical problems posed by these and other composers' increasing uses of chromaticism and extended forms through both traditional (classical) models of tonal harmony and form, as well as alternative approaches specifically tailored to this repertory. We will also address the ways in which these analytical perspectives might impinge on or influence matters of performance; students with a performance background will be invited to propose a final project that involves both performance and analysis.\n\nTerms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): MUSI 15300 or equivalent\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MUSI 35200\n\nMUSI 25300. Analysis of Twentieth-Century Music. 100 Units.\n\nThis course introduces theoretical and analytical approaches to twentieth-century music. The core of the course involves learning a new theoretical apparatus-often called \"set theory\"-and exploring how best to apply that apparatus analytically to pieces by composers such as Schoenberg, Bartók, and Stravinsky. We also explore the relevance of the theoretical models to music outside of the high-modernist canon, including some jazz. The course provides an opportunity to confront some foundational questions regarding what it means to \"theorize about music.\"\n\nInstructor(s): Various Terms Offered: Various\n\nPrerequisite(s): MUSI 15300 or equivalent\n\nNote(s): This course typically is offered in alternate years.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MUSI 35300\n\nMUSI 25421. Bach Yesterday and Today. 100 Units.\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach is somewhat of a cipher, one whose image and meaning has changed remarkably over the centuries. In this class, we will look at many of these shifting images of the famous Leipzig composer. Was he the pious Thomaskantor dutifully churning out his cantatas and passions or the intellectual wizard of an abstract and dying fugal art? A belated hero of German nationalism, or a universal icon of musical humanity celebrated by many as the greatest composer of all time? We will do a fair amount of readings that reflect many of these changing views of Bach. But we will also spend much of our time listening to-and studying-his music, seeing what clues he has offered to help us understand this most enigmatic of composers. While an advanced understanding of music theory is not a prerequisite for this course, it will be important that you can read music and helpful to have a foundational understanding of harmony and counterpoint.\n\nInstructor(s): Thomas Christensen Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GRMN 25422\n\nMUSI 25422. Hearing Popular Music. 100 Units.\n\nFor decades, popular music has been the soundtrack to many Americans' lives. This class explores the structure, function, and impact of a range of vernacular musics from the 20th and 21st centuries. Our approach to popular music will be by turns historical, analytical, and sociological. Students will learn about formal designs of pop songs, from verse-chorus to much more elaborate structures, along with antecedents in the Great American Songbook tradition. Students will learn to analyze the harmonic and melodic conventions in various genres, and also spend significant time with groove analysis and design. Finally, the class will interrogate the sociological relevance of vernacular musics, weaving in discussions of relevant social issues from radio play to popularity, and from subcultural appeal to racial identity. This class is open to anyone who listens carefully and with passion, and who wants to grow their ability to write about music. Experience as a practitioner of any type of music and/or a passing knowledge of music theory will be helpful, but it is not necessary to read notated music for this course.\n\nInstructor(s): Jennifer Iverson Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MADD 12422, SIGN 26090\n\nMUSI 25622. Listening to Flamenco. 100 Units.\n\nAlluring dance, virtuosic guitar playing, and deep song. This course provides and introduction to the history and theory of flamenco-developed by the oft-marginalized gitano people (Spanish Roma) and recognized as World Heritage Treasure by UNESCO. Students will learn to describe musical and choreographic techniques and to distinguish between the different subgenres that constitute flamenco. Through a study of the music and complementary readings, we will learn about gitano culture and explore issues of identity, representation, class, gender, and ethnicity.\n\nInstructor(s): Olga Sanchez Kisielewska Terms Offered: Winter\n\nNote(s): Knowledge of Spanish and/or ability to read music will be helpful but is not required.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): SPAN 25622, SPAN 35622, MUSI 35622\n\nMUSI 25721. Music of the Black Radical Tradition. 100 Units.\n\nBlack artists are often written out of the history of musical experimentalism. John Cage's place in the canon is secure, but what of Cecil Taylor's? Or Anthony Braxton's? Or Matana Roberts's? Labels like \"jazz\" or \"free jazz\" segregate these artists from white experimentalists, suggesting that their music is best understood within a narrowly racialized genre category, rather than as part of the experimental mainstream, with its assumed whiteness, institutional support, and inbuilt prestige. This course redresses this imbalance by centering the music of Black radical composers in the latter half of the twentieth century. We will study the music of a wide range of composers, including many associated with the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM), one of the most venerable musical collectives of the twentieth century, rooted right here in Chicago's South Side. The course will tack between studies of the music's sounds and its historical, political, and ideological contexts. We will develop critical and analytical language for engaging the often-bracing sound worlds of those composers while building out a contextual understanding of their work as at once capaciously experimental and situated in a political context of resistance.\n\nInstructor(s): Steve Rings Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CRES 25721\n\nMUSI 25722. The Musical Interface: Constraint and Creativity. 100 Units.\n\nMusic-making involves constraint: the layout of a keyboard or guitar, the poetic systems of an epic storyteller, the practice techniques of a singer who cultivates a certain sound, or even the lines of code that an algorithmic music-maker strings together. New technologies bring new rules, as well as new ways to break the rules: autotuned vocals are no longer derided, and tools like Melodyne are now a standard part of music production. Constraint, then, produces creativity-but how does this look with particular instruments and traditions? How do artists make the most of their tools? In this hands-on class, we will explore the interface through the concepts of affordance, interval systems, algorithms, and generalizable schemas. You won't just analyze art: you will also produce it and discuss your experiences with each type of interface. Our topics will include electronic music constructed on digital audio workstations and through code, the piano keyboard, the harmonica, Korean p'ansori sung storytelling, streaming platforms and recommendation algorithms, and the Italian solfeggio tradition. This class includes a creative final project in the sonic medium of your choice.\n\nInstructor(s): Andrew White Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MADD 25722\n\nMUSI 26100. Introduction to Composition. 100 Units.\n\nDesigned for beginning composers to practice and hone the nuances of their musical craft, this course introduces some of the fundamentals of music composition through a series of exercises as well as several larger creative projects. Professional musicians will perform students' exercises and compositions. This is primarily a creative, composing course. Through a combination of composition assignments, listening, discussion, analysis, and reading, we will explore and practice the fundamental aspects of music composition. Repertoire study, harmony, counterpoint, rhythm, orchestration, timbre, form, transformation, and several other pertinent essentials are included in the curriculum. This laboratory-style, practical course is interactive and discussion-based.\n\nTerms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): Any two quarters of music theory, inclusive of 14300 and 15153, or permission from the instructor\n\nMUSI 26200. Advanced Composition. 100 Units.\n\nThis course is a continuation of MUSI 261: Introduction to Composition, and an opportunity to go deeper into creative work. The focus will be on writing new pieces while also learning about various techniques and aesthetics, with special attention on music of the last hundred years. The new works will be performed and recorded by professional musicians, with demonstrations of instruments as well. Students are encouraged to bring their own existing interests into discussions and projects, while also incorporating newly acquired ideas and inspirations. There will also be focused attention on analysis of more recent repertoire for a variety of instrumentations and configurations, addressing new ways of thinking about harmony, melody, form, timbre, orchestration, rhythm, improvisation, notation, technology, theatricality, and concept. Students will also attend rehearsals and performances of the Chicago Center for Contemporary Composition and other events on campus.\n\nNote(s): Enrollment is open to students who have taken Introduction to Composition or have permission of the instructor.\n\nMUSI 26521. Introduction to Sonic Arts. 100 Units.\n\nThis course provides a historical, theoretical, and practical introduction to aesthetic technologies of sound. Open to students in Music, DOVA, TAPS, and MAAD, this course is geared toward a broad spectrum of creators including material musicians, mixed-media artists, dramaturges, game designers, etc. who use sound in their artistic practice. The course will include a historical overview of the porous relationship between sound and music from the birth of electricity, futurism, and Dada to recent conceptions and innovations of the sonic arts in computer music, intermedia, installations, gaming, and performance art.\n\nMUSI 26618. Electronic Music: Composing with Sound. 100 Units.\n\nElectronic Music I presents an open environment for creativity and expression through composition in the electronic music studio. The course provides students with a background in the fundamentals of sound and acoustics, covers the theory and practice of digital signal processing for audio, and introduces the recording studio as a powerful compositional tool. The course culminates in a concert of original student works presented in multi-channel surround sound. Enrollment gives students access to the Electronic Music Studio in the Department of Music. No prior knowledge of electronic music is necessary.\n\nInstructor(s): TBD\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MADD 24618, MUSI 36618\n\nMUSI 26715. 16th Century Counterpoint. 100 Units.\n\nThis class explores sixteenth century counterpoint through the lens of species counterpoint training as codified in the eighteenth century. Students will produce compositions and exercises for two and three voices, with a brief excursion into four voice counterpoint. The class will develop a critical ear and a mind towards good counterpoint with in-class critique and discussion. Each class will also be devoted to discussing counterpoint in repertoire from medieval to present, focusing on sixteenth century masterworks, in tandem with assignments in which students complete brief lines of missing voices in existing repertoire, comparing their own solutions with the original. We also compare and discuss famous examples of student counterpoint from Mozart, Beethoven, and others.\n\nInstructor(s): James Kallembach Terms Offered: Winter\n\nPrerequisite(s): MUSI 153 or equivalent\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MUSI 36720\n\nMUSI 26718.

In this course, we will study current and historical approaches to the performative use of hardware and software environments in music, and will follow the practice as it continues to redefine music composition and improvisation in the 21st century. Study will be repertoire-based, drawing from the work of artists ranging from David Tudor to Herbie Hancock to Grandmaster Flash to Kaija Saariaho.\n\nInstructor(s): TBD\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MUSI 36718, MADD 16718\n\nMUSI 26725. Staging Richard Wagner's Ring of the Nibelung in the 21st Century. 100 Units.\n\nThis team-taught course explores the challenges of staging Richard Wagner's sprawling 19th-century tetralogy The Ring of the Nibelung in the 21st century. The course will offer an introduction to The Ring, including its complicated place in history (including its reception and production history), and how it has been thought about in recent musicology and critical theory. But first and foremost, we will be exploring how the piece is being staged today. To that end, we will explore four productions of the tetralogy that are currently being prepared at leading opera houses around the world - in Munich, London, Berlin, and Oslo - speaking, via Zoom, with artistic directors and the production teams about their ideas and ambitions. What are the interpretive challenges and opportunities in staging this mammoth work? How do these productions seek to engage the tetralogy's exceedingly complicated aesthetic ambitions, political baggage, and production history? And how do specific geographical, cultural, and historical conditions affect the artistic project of each production? Our discussions will encompass a range of fields, approaches, and topics. Among the themes we plan to examine are the aspiration to aesthetic totalization, the politics of community, the relationship between canonicity and critique, the notion of distress or emergency (the German term is Not), and some astonishingly lurid fantasies of family life-mostly of family dissolution. Moreover, we will approach the questi\n\nInstructor(s): David Levin, Hedda Høgåsen-Hallesby Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): TAPS 36518, GRMN 26725, MUSI 36725, TAPS 26518, GRMN 36725\n\nMUSI 26780. Caribbean Music, Performance, and Popular Culture in the Age of Precarity: 1990 to the Present. 100 Units.\n\nThis course explores the concept of precarity and its influence on artistic and cultural expressions within contemporary Caribbean popular culture, primarily from the 1990s to the present day. Precarity is broadly defined as the feeling or experience of instability resulting from various social, economic, political, and environmental factors, including structural adjustments, climate change (such as hurricanes and earthquakes), and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, among others. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of art in shaping popular responses to precarity, including significant events like mass protests, the Black Lives Matter and George Floyd protests, uprisings against the deportation of Haitians in the Dominican Republic, as well as interrelated international movements like #LifeinLeggings and #Metoo. The course delves into how Caribbean performance and popular music have engaged with these issues, with a focus on music genres like dancehall, wylers, soca, reggaetón, and the individual artistic works of Caribbean artists such as LaVaughn Belle, Helen Ceballos, Joiri Minaya, and others. These artists use their work to explore themes of precarity and to envision potential alternatives to the contemporary challenges of insecurity, touching on issues related to gender, sexuality, and race.\n\nInstructor(s): Jessica Baker and Danielle Roper Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): SPAN 26780, RDIN 36780, RDIN 26780, MUSI 36780, SPAN 36780\n\nMUSI 26817.

Divas, Idols, Material Girls: Gender and Sexuality in Music Videos. 100 Units.\n\nThe stark black and white of Madonna's \"Vogue\" and the pinks and sparkles of \"Material Girl.\" The explosive surprise releases of Beyoncé's BEYONCÉ and Lemonade visual albums. The lavish cinematic spectacle of Taylor Swift's \"Bad Blood\" and the fanbait intertextuality of SM Entertainment's Aespa. Since MTV's advent in 1981, hit music videos have made a number of pop songs inextricable from iconic imagery and choreography; ubiquitous digital devices and the rise of platforms like YouTube and TikTok have only increased pop music's audiovisuality. Looking at and listening to female pop icons raises fraught questions of agency, representation, race, sexuality/sexualization, bodies, commodification, and capital. In this course, students will gain a vocabulary for talking about both the audio and visual parameters of music video, and they will use this vocabulary to engage with critical frameworks for examining meaning, circulation, and reception in contemporary music videos. Assignments across the course will allow students to experiment with a range of writing and media genres, including critical close readings, micro-reception histories, thinkpieces, podcast episodes, and video essays.\n\nInstructor(s): Paula Harper Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MADD 14723, GNSE 20135\n\nMUSI 27523.
