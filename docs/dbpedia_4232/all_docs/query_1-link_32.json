        "text": "Who or what inspired you to take up composing, and pursue a career in music?\n\nI always liked composing in a relatively small-scale sense as a teenager, but it was a particular teacher’s musicianship classes at my town’s weekend music centre that really fired me on: I remember him introducing us to John Cage’s 4’33 and me stroppily complaining that it wasn’t music before the lightbulb moment hit.\n\nWho or what were the most significant influences on your musical life and career as a composer?\n\nAt York University: my composition tutor Roger Marsh, the tenor and musicologist John Potter and the composer Bill Brooks, as well as countless fellow students who have gone onto have awesome careers, including Anna Meredith, Laura Moody, Emily Hall, and my Juice colleagues Sarah Dacey and Anna Snow. The producer/beatboxer/songwriter MaJiKer. My bandmates in You Are Wolf, Sam Hall and Peter Ashwell.\n\nElsewhere: Bjork, Meredith Monk, Brian Wilson, Laurie Anderson, Tom Waits, Damon Albarn, Lisa Knapp. Traditional vocal musics from around the world.\n\nWhat have been the greatest challenges/frustrations of your career so far?\n\nJuggling all the different facets of my work. I often think that if I just concentrated on one thing, I’d be far more successful at it, but I know that wouldn’t satisfy me.\n\nWhat are the special challenges/pleasures of working on a commissioned piece?\n\nBeing able to tailor something to specific players/singers – it’s actually what I mostly do, and am grateful for being able to work in that way. The challenge is hoping that you have created something that your commissioner is happy with (not always the case)…\n\nOf which works are you most proud?\n\nMy community chamber opera ‘Woodwose’, which drew together many of my interests: folk music and lore, writing (I wrote the libretto), community music, improvisation, and music-theatre. My two ‘You Are Wolf’ albums, Hawk to the Hunting Gone and Keld.\n\nHow would you characterise your compositional language?\n\nVoices and words and stories. Loops and improv. Landscape. Focused on texture more than harmony. Far too modal, because folk songs have lodged themselves in me.\n\nHow do you work?\n\nIn my study in South London, for up to three hours, mostly in the morning. I use manuscript paper, a Nord Electro 2 keyboard, Logic Pro, and Sibelius.\n\nWho are your favourite musicians/composers?\n\nApart the influences above, Messaien, Britten, Stravinsky. Alasdair Roberts.\n\nAs a musician, what is your definition of success?\n\nMaking music for enough of a living is the main thing.\n\nWhat do you consider to be the most important ideas and concepts to impart to aspiring musicians?\n\nSay yes to most things, until you’re in a position to say no, and then recommend others for those things instead. Collaborate widely. Be hugely proactive. Put on your own gigs, start your own hubs/websites/record labels. Connect people and celebrate the success of others. Throw all the things you’re interested in into your work and don’t worry about trying to fit in a box.\n\nWhere would you like to be in 10 years’ time?\n\nWith five/six more novels under my belt, and maybe another big music-theatre work or two. In my dream cabin in Scotland.\n\nWhat is your idea of perfect happiness?\n\nSkimming stones on a Scottish loch with no midges and sunshine.\n\nWhat is your most treasured possession?\n\nA copy of my first novel, Swansong.\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing most?\n\nSwimming outside.\n\nWhat is your present state of mind?\n\nFull of all the things I need to do, but mostly trying to work out when next to go swimming."
