        "text": "Every Wednesday we show you a great scene from film history you may remember, you may not — and then we break it down for you.\n\nThe details are key to the success of 24 Hour Party People (2002). Michael Winterbottom sketches the rise and fall of Manchester's Factory Records label (Joy Division, New Order, Happy Mondays) from the birth of punk all the way to '90s electronica. The narrative project is wildly ambitious, but Winterbottom's mixture of realism and self-reflexive comedy allow him to fluidly traverse 15 very busy years of British youth culture. And late in the film, what one could easily dismiss as an extended establishing shot actually draws out an important theme — how art and ambition can set in motion a sprawling, unpredictable chain of events.\n\nImmediately following a scene chronicling the corporate takeover of the record company is an overhead, nighttime shot of the Manchester cityscape. It's set to the intro of \"Hallelujah\" by Happy Mondays, one of the biggest anthems of the \"Madchester\" era. This juxtaposition itself is moving, but the effect is compounded by a voiceover: Label boss Tony Wilson's (Steve Coogan) poetic and absurd ruminations on the city he helped transform. He explains the downfall of his empire by way of a humble-brag about his civic pride.\n\nThe version of the song that plays is Paul Oakenfold and Andrew Weatherall's \"Club Mix,\" and represents both Northern English idiosyncrasies and the steady boom of the new DJ age. The track is a jumble of Gregorian chants, thumping beats, soul diva cries, and the vaguely-in-key surreal associations of a Mancunian hooligan. Many earlier scenes are manic and very much character-driven. Here, the scope is widened, the pace slackened. It's a poignant moment — celebrating both community and creative self-actualization — in an irony-obsessed production. It plays like a final hit, the last breathtaking, expansive moment before the comedown. As the music continues, we follow Tony into his club's closing party. He wanders around aloof, distanced from the now much-younger dancers, saying a few hellos and goodbyes as the party rages around him. And finally, he makes a typically anarchic and pretentious farewell speech from the DJ booth.\n\nThe scene was a favorite of the real, late Tony Wilson. While Winterbottom tells the Factory story predominantly as a comedy of errors, the fleeting aerial shots reinforce the idea that this Manchester is a new and improved city, one where culture and nightlife lead the way forward. Grant Gee's 2007 documentary Joy Division concludes with some similar skyline footage, driving home how music can have larger-than-life effects. It really is one of the best tales in rock history."
