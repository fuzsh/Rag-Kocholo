        "text": "Factory Records emerged in the punk moment of the late 1970s and was the heart of Manchester’s music scene until its collapse in the early 1990s. Like his Mancunian contemporaries, the Buzzcocks, Factory cofounder Anthony H. Wilson (who presided over the influential pop music television program So It Goes) learned from the Sex Pistols, then struck off in a quite different direction, aided by graphic artist Peter Saville, whose neoclassic designs gave Factory packaging a signature. First came the Durutti Column’s quietly arty guitar-based mood music. Then came the edgy electronic pop of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and the sonorous, doom-laden anxieties of Joy Division, given shape and tone by the city’s preeminent producer, Martin Hannett. Joy Division’s biggest hit, “Love Will Tear Us Apart” (1980), was released after singer Ian Curtis’s suicide. The survivors reemerged as New Order, who provided the soundtrack to Factory’s other great project of the 1980s, the Hacienda, the club where dance music was coupled with postpunk. From that arty mélange came Simply Red, the Happy Mondays, the Stone Roses, and the manic-depressive rants of the Smiths, though only the Happy Mondays recorded on Factory."
