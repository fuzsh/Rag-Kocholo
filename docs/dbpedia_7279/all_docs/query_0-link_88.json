A low flat rate for the rest of the world.\n\nSize: 69 cm x 102 cm (27 in x 40 in)\n\nA guaranteed original one sheet movie poster from 2002 for Michael Winterbottom's biographical music scene comedy drama \"24 Hour Party People\" starring Steve Coogan, Paddy Considine, Danny Cunningham, Sean Harris, Shirley Henderson, Lennie James, Andy Serkis and John Simm.\n\nTony Wilson was so inspired by a Sex Pistols gig that he started his own punk music nights in his home city, opened a record label and signed the first band's contract in his own blood. The city? Manchester. The label? Factory Records. The band? Joy Division.\n\nThe Madchester scene of the 1980's and '90's is now mythical. Joy Division, The Happy Mondays, New Order and The Hacienda Club have all entered British musical culture folklore. This wonderful portrayal of the era toys with the age superbly and was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 2002 Cannes Festival.\n\nThis fantastic single-sided poster has never been folded and is in superb condition. It will look amazing framed and on the wall of any music fan!\n\nBy the way, even though Factory Records had been bankrupt for a decade, the film has its own Factory Records catalogue number, FAC 401!\n\nWe only sell guaranteed original movie posters. We do not sell reproductions."
