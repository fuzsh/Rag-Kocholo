        "text": "CYOTF (Human)\n\n24 Hour Party People?\n\nOriginally posted to writing.com\n\n\"No one will need sleep for at least 24 hours. I want some worldwide partying!\"\n\nKevin and Jennifer suddenly didn't feel tired at all, and judging by the cheering the girls were doing, neither did they.\n\nKevin sighed. \"Come on, girls, just because you don't have to sleep doesn't mean you have to act wild. You already got enough stimulation at the concert.\"\n\n\"But Jason wants us to party!\" whined Annie.\n\n\"Honey, he just said he wanted worldwide partying,\" pointed out Jennifer. \"He didn't say everyone had to do it. Why don't you watch a movie or something?\"\n\n\"But Jason's still talking!\" Annie gestured toward the TV.\n\n\"Once he's done,\" Jennifer said firmly. \"You should, uh, keep yourselves occupied for the next couple of hours.\"\n\n\"Then can we go out somewhere?\" asked Candi from the bed. \"Like for pancakes?\"\n\n\"We'll see,\" said Kevin. He looked at the TV briefly, but Jason seemed to be saying nothing of consequence. Jennifer poked his arm, and the two left that bedroom in search of the master bedroom.\n\n\"Do you think they'll be okay?\" asked Jennifer as they got halfway down the hall.\n\n\"Well, if there's another major change, I think we'll know about it,\" Kevin said, glancing upward at an \"ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM GOD\" speaker that graced one of the hallway walls.\n\nThey finally found a giant room that was clearly intended to be the master bedroom, with an enormous round bed as the centerpiece. Doing some quick exploring, Kevin found that the attached bathroom featured a shower stall big enough for a crowd, and Jennifer found a walk-in closet about the size of their previous bedroom, which was full of skimpy outfits that looked like they'd perfectly fit her altered body. Of course, the bedroom itself, the closet, and the bathroom all had their own speakers.\n\nThey kissed over by the bed. Jennifer admitted, \"Being turned into horny teenagers -- actually, looking a lot better than we did when we were teenagers before -- it's not the worst thing that could have happened.\"\n\n\"I'm just wondering how far things are going to go,\" said Kevin, reaching around to unhook Jennifer's skimpy top and let her enlarged breasts free.\n\n\"Actually, you know what I'm wondering?\" Jennifer asked.\n\n\"No, what?\"\n\nJennifer replied...\n\nWhat do you do now?\n\n\"Why haven't we heard from Kimmi's parents yet?\" added\n\nTitle suggestions for new chapters. Please feel free to use them or create your own below.\n\n\"If we'll get any more special privileges from you being at tonight's concert.\""
