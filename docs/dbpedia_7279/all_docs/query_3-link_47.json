        "text": "When the news broke—“CLEVELAND KIDNAPPING VICTIMS FREE”—Rachel Maddow wasn’t sure she had much to add. It was the kind of story that cable news loves: three women had been abducted and held hostage for years, until a garrulous local man named Charles Ramsey helped kick down the door of the house where they were kept. (In the interview that made him a star, Ramsey reported that a neighbor had told him, “You got some big testicles to pull this off, bro.”) Maddow is a cable-news star: the defining voice of MSNBC, which makes her, surely, the most influential liberal pundit in the country. But “The Rachel Maddow Show,” which airs every weeknight at nine, is known for even-tempered political discussion, not for screaming headlines. Maddow plays the cheerful docent, often taking viewers on a tour of the conservative movement, where she invariably finds something that inspires her not to anger but to joyful incredulity. Although her analysis is reliably liberal, she likes to surprise viewers with obscure historical anecdotes and nimble shifts in tone; the elections in Iran, apparently, were both “geostrategically important” and “amazeballs.”\n\n“I don’t know what to do about the Cleveland thing,” Maddow said. She was standing in front of a whiteboard that had a list of twenty-nine possible topics for that night’s show, starting with “Flake, Ayotte waffle on guns” and ending with “Emergency contraception case before a judge today.” This was her daily afternoon meeting, held in a scruffy corner of the fourth floor of Rockefeller Center, beneath a low dropped ceiling. “We don’t do crime, but it’s an interesting story,” she said, as much to herself as to the two dozen producers and researchers clustered around her. “We have a few decisions to make about who we are as a show.”\n\nThe decisions that Maddow makes go a long way toward defining what MSNBC is, too. Phil Griffin, the president, calls Maddow “our quarterback,” the person who sets the tone for the network. A few years ago, MSNBC had a different quarterback: Keith Olbermann, a former ESPN anchor who rose to fame during the Bush years, delivering urbane, fuguelike denunciations of a President who was sometimes known, on his show, as “you, sir.” Olbermann and MSNBC agreed to a no-fault divorce in early 2011, and Griffin has spent the past two and a half years reinventing the network in Maddow’s image. At almost any time of the day, you can turn it on and encounter someone whose liberalism is earnest, upbeat, and perhaps a little wonky. Melissa Harris-Perry, one of the network’s rising stars, is a Tulane professor who rallies her followers on Twitter with the hashtag #Nerdland.\n\nThis may not sound like a recipe for televisual success, but the 2012 election season was a triumph for MSNBC, whose viewers were treated to vigorous defenses of the Obama Presidency and skeptical, often gleeful reports on the various Republicans who wanted to end it. The network helped determine the political agenda, pushing niche liberal stories into the mainstream—“recalibrating what counts as normal,” as Maddow puts it. MSNBC raised the alarm about voter-identification laws; the Reverend Al Sharpton, who hosts a six-o’clock show, drew attention to the killing of Trayvon Martin. That fall, for the first time, Maddow regularly beat Sean Hannity, her Fox News rival, among viewers aged twenty-five to fifty-four, known collectively in cable news as “the demographic” or “the demo,” because it is the group that advertisers pay to reach.\n\nThis year, the cable-news ratings went back to normal—or, in the case of MSNBC, worse than normal. In May, MSNBC found itself in fourth place, drawing fewer viewers than Fox News, CNN, and even HLN, CNN’s crime-obsessed corporate sibling. At times, the political climate has been inhospitable: this spring, when Washington was consumed with allegations about the attack on the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi and possible abuses at the I.R.S., MSNBC’s anchors seemed torn between explaining why these seeming scandals weren’t scandalous and ignoring them completely. Neither strategy gave viewers an urgent reason to tune in. But MSNBC has also been hurt by an unusual problem for a cable news network to have: too much news. Especially in a non-election year, “news” and “politics” often aren’t synonymous, and many of the year’s biggest events, like the Boston Marathon bombings, didn’t lend themselves to stories of conservative villainy and liberal perseverance. What does a network built on political punditry have to say about a kidnapping?\n\nThat night, Maddow began her show by reassuring her audience, and herself, that there was no shame in covering the news from Cleveland. “If you are glued to your TV on this one, there’s no reason to feel guilty about that,” she said. “This is a genuinely transfixing and dramatic human story.” She talked, intelligently but rather dryly, about the politicization of human trafficking with Todd Clear, the dean of the Rutgers School of Criminal Justice. (On CNN, Anderson Cooper had an exclusive interview with Ramsey, the neighbor turned folk hero. “You got to have some cojones, bro,” Ramsey said. “That’s all it’s about: it’s about cojones, on this planet.”) Then, sounding slightly relieved, she returned to regular programming: the congressional special election in South Carolina, which she called “the Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride of American off-year electoral politics.”\n\nGriffin, the MSNBC president, says that despite the ratings he is staying patient, which can’t be easy. He has a jock’s self-confidence and aversion to indecision; in a number of ways, he is an unlikely leader for a network that is so moderate in temperament, if not in ideology. He maintains that this year’s low ratings are a natural by-product of the election cycle, which means that the solution is a little bit of tinkering and a lot of waiting. “I want to be better next year, better the year after, and by 2016 I want to be firing on all cylinders,” he says. Certainly, the race to elect Obama’s successor will draw viewers back to MSNBC. But it’s less clear that its parent company, Comcast, will be impressed by a programming strategy that bears fruit only every fourth year.\n\nThe lack of political excitement this year has laid bare the audacity of Griffin’s strategy: in the cable-news format, traditionally dominated by hot-type bulletins and feisty arguments, MSNBC is hoping to succeed by doing something a little bit cooler. (The bookers often recruit guests from magazines, including this one; I have appeared on the network a handful of times.) Griffin wants MSNBC to be known as the home of “thoughtful people who can talk about ideas”—although he concedes that those “thoughtful people” tend to share a political alignment. For decades, conservatives used the phrase “liberal media” as a term of abuse, aimed at putatively nonpartisan platforms like public radio and the Times. Now there exists an avowedly liberal media outlet, an underdog competitor to Fox News, devoted almost entirely to progressive politics. The most pressing task, for Griffin and for the people he likes to call “our talent,” is to figure out what, exactly, the liberal media is supposed to do.\n\nEarlier this year, while Griffin was still accepting congratulations on a triumphant 2012, he decided that the future of MSNBC was Chris Hayes, a thirty-four-year-old former reporter for The Nation. Hayes is a protégé of Maddow; if she is a hip, erudite professor of politics, he is a smart and eager grad student, compressing his knowledge into enthusiastic bursts. Hayes was the host of a two-hour weekend morning show called “Up with Chris Hayes,” on which guests, seated before a heap of Danish, were often permitted to wax seminarial. During one episode, he spent twenty minutes talking to the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt about the “alchemical mix of nature and nurture” that turns people into partisans—a discussion that at times resembled a gentle chastisement of MSNBC itself.\n\nHayes’s promotion was supposed to affirm the network’s new direction. The host he replaced was Ed Schultz, a fifty-nine-year-old veteran of conservative talk radio who has remade himself as a fiery liberal populist. (He begins each broadcast by saying, “This is ‘The Ed Show’—let’s get to work.”) Schultz, at eight o’clock, was a modest success; he attracted fewer viewers than Bill O’Reilly, on Fox News, but usually more than Anderson Cooper, on CNN. Still, his audience skewed old, and his blunt style didn’t quite fit the network’s new brand, so he was exiled to weekends, where news programs coexist with “caught on camera” compilations and prison-life documentaries.\n\n“I’m building for the future,” Griffin said, not long after the switch. He was sitting in his office, reviewing a series of promotional clips that highlighted Hayes and the network’s other stars. “You’ve got a young guy who’s incredibly smart, who’s got a following,” he said. “We’re making a bet that this is what our audience wants.” Hayes is burdened by a squawky voice and a determination to cram fifteen minutes of facts into an eight-minute segment. But he is exactly the kind of host liberals—especially liberals who hate cable news—should love: a passionate but open-minded advocate, happy to help viewers pick through the thicket of arguments over health-care premiums in California. Maddow, who used Hayes as her most frequent guest host, says that he is a much better interviewer than she is; his eagerness to ask questions sometimes camouflages the truth that, more than most of his peers, he is interested in the answers.\n\nStill, Hayes might be best known, especially among conservatives, for a broadcast before Memorial Day last year, on which he led a nuanced discussion about the use of the word “hero” to describe any member of the military who dies in service:\n\nIt seems to me that it is so rhetorically proximate to justifications for more war. And I don’t want to, obviously, desecrate or disrespect the memory of anyone that’s fallen. And obviously there are individual circumstances in which there is genuine and tremendous heroism: hail of gunfire, and rescuing fellow-soldiers, and things like that. But it seems to me that we marshal this word in a way that is problematic. But maybe I’m wrong about that.\n\nIndignant responses spread from conservative blogs to NBC’s “Today,” on which Matt Lauer talked to a panel of offended commentators. The next day, Hayes issued an unconditional apology—even on a liberal network, no pundit can afford to be considered insufficiently respectful of dead soldiers on Memorial Day.\n\nSo far, Hayes has avoided doing anything so controversial in his new slot. In fact, Griffin might not mind if he inspired a bit more conservative vituperation. “All In with Chris Hayes,” his prime-time show, had its début on April 1st, with an audience that started small and has stayed small. While O’Reilly regularly attracts nearly three million viewers, Hayes in his first three months averaged only five hundred and eighty-eight thousand, putting him behind virtually every other cable news program broadcast in or near prime time. The poor performance of “All In” has also hurt the shows that follow; Maddow, though she remains the network’s strongest performer, has earned some of her lowest ratings since the Bush era.\n\nIn person, Hayes is taller and more physically imposing than he seems on television—he is a former stage actor, and despite the squeak in his voice he hasn’t lost his knack for vocal projection. One day this spring, he was in his office at Rockefeller Center, a small room overlooking Sixth Avenue, with a few laundered shirts hanging from a bookcase. “All In” was nearly two months old, and he had already trained himself to tune out the daily ratings updates, which arrive on computers and BlackBerrys throughout Rockefeller Center every weekday at four. “Obviously, the numbers are bad right now,” he said. But television ratings are notoriously noisy, distorted by imperfect monitoring and by the imperfect science of statistical extrapolation, so he was on guard against drawing lessons from a strong Thursday, or a weak Monday. “Looking at day-to-day ratings tickles the worst instincts human beings have on causal inference,” he said, sounding as if he were a rat, describing his own lab. “It creates cargo cult. It creates rain dances. It’s, like, Oh, my God, the number’s good today. What did we do yesterday? Well, we danced, and it rained. So let’s dance!”\n\nIt had been a slow day, and as the producers gathered for the afternoon staff meeting Hayes allowed himself some optimism. “I liked last night’s show a lot,” he said. “Of the last five or six shows we’ve done, about half of them I’ve unreservedly liked.” For a host like Hayes, a slow news day can be a blessing, because it gives him a chance to set the agenda of his own show, and to indulge in the kind of drawn-out discussions that get cut when news breaks.\n\nThen, at 7:03 p.m. Eastern time, a tornado touched down just west of Oklahoma City. It was one of those nights when cable news reverts to its roots as a kind of for-profit emergency broadcast system. On Fox News, the producers often seem thrilled to have an excuse to put a bright-red “ALERT” banner on the bottom of the screen, and CNN never looks more alive than when one of its anchors is standing outside, in close proximity to some sort of emergency vehicle. MSNBC’s aesthetic is more restrained, with muted colors (Maddow’s show is signified by an affable light-blue strip across the top of the screen) and a minimum of text; there is almost never a news crawl across the bottom. A natural disaster is an unwelcome imposition: it’s raining, so they have to dance.\n\nAs Hayes began his show, at eight, it quickly became clear that he would be talking about nothing besides the weather. Ezra Klein, one of the night’s guests, was excused from his chair at four minutes past the hour, as producers in the control room started scrambling to book interviews with storm experts and local officials; they reached a police sergeant on his cell phone, then rushed to put him on the air before he lost his signal. Cable-news hosts have been known to solemnify their disaster commentary with theological asides, but Hayes’s prayer was strictly secular: “We’re all crossing our fingers.” He talked briefly with Irwin Redlener, a disaster-preparedness expert, and then curtailed the conversation to check in with KFOR, the local NBC affiliate. Finally, off-camera, Hayes arched backward in his chair and exhaled. The tornado turned out to be the widest one ever documented in America, killing eight people and injuring more than a hundred. Near the end of the hour, an e-mail arrived on the BlackBerrys of all the show’s producers, with a simple instruction: “Don’t leave.”\n\nIn the aftermath of the tornado, Griffin told the Times that breaking news wasn’t an important part of his network’s identity. “We’re not the place for that,” he said. This sounded like heresy: what was the purpose of a twenty-four-hour news network if not to cover breaking news? But Griffin is right that “news” means many things now. MSNBC is known for a particular form of analysis, as specialized in its way as ESPN’s “SportsCenter”—a program that tends not to be preëmpted by extreme weather phenomena or grisly trials. For now, though, MSNBC can’t afford to be the only cable news network that ignores an unfolding disaster. On the night of the tornado, Hayes attracted nearly seven hundred thousand viewers, while Cooper earned more than a million. You might take this disparity as proof that it’s futile for MSNBC to compete with CNN on tornado coverage. But, if you looked at Hayes’s ratings for the month, you would notice something else: that night’s broadcast attracted his biggest audience in nearly two weeks—since the night of another tornado, three times as deadly.\n\nTwenty years ago, cable news really meant “news.” CNN, which launched in 1980, was built on never-ending coverage of current events, and thrived during periods of extended drama, such as the first Gulf War. In 1996, two new cable news networks were created, each promising to deliver even more news than CNN. MSNBC, the result of an ostentatious collaboration between NBC and Microsoft, began broadcasting on July 15, 1996, promising viewers “the future of news from the people you know.” That first evening, on a program called “InterNight,” Tom Brokaw interviewed President Clinton, choosing from among more than seven thousand questions that viewers had submitted, mostly via dial-up modem. The network’s initial lineup also included a program that might have reflected its era too faithfully: “The Site,” a nightly technology report hosted by Soledad O’Brien, who was joined by what she said was “the first real-time, computer-generated cyber-journalist”—a wisecracking, purple-haired, espresso-making wraith that called itself Dev Null.\n\nFox News began broadcasting three months later, on October 7th, looking much the same as it does now. On its first night, viewers were introduced to a flinty, self-assured host named Bill O’Reilly, a veteran of the syndicated tabloid show “Inside Edition,” who established himself as the network’s most popular personality and, by the turn of the century, the format’s definitive star. There was “straight” news—the network has always argued that its daytime reporting should be considered separately from its nighttime opinion shows. But, from the start, what made Fox News different was its sensibility, rather than its scoops. In a sense, Roger Ailes, Fox’s chairman, presides over a cable meta-news network: Fox News programming functions as an ongoing critique of what the rest of the news media is or isn’t covering. “Fair and Balanced,” the network’s slogan, is a brilliant provocation: it gets liberals to sneer at Fox News, but the more vigorously liberals defend the news establishment the more liberal that establishment seems. In 2008, when Sarah Palin’s many detractors rushed to speak up for Katie Couric, they only confirmed her suspicions about the “lamestream media.”\n\nFox News eclipsed CNN as the top-rated cable news network in January, 2002, and it has remained in front ever since. On Fox, the anchors and commentators can seem like protagonists, doing battle with the “pinheads”—one of O’Reilly’s favorite terms—who just don’t get it. This battle needn’t be explicitly ideological: the network has always had a weakness for titillating legal stories and for celebrity misbehavior. But if the CNN approach emphasizes reporters chasing news around the world, the Fox News approach suggests that the real news is being made right in the studio, by the hosts themselves. Even viewers who don’t share O’Reilly’s concerns about, say, the secularization of America might stick around to watch him present his list of “anti-Easter municipalities.”\n\nLast year, on Election Night, as MSNBC and its preferred Presidential candidate were celebrating, things got chaotic at the Fox News studio. Karl Rove, the Republican strategist, was working as a contributor, and when the network announced that Obama had won he objected. “I think this is premature,” Rove said.\n\n“That’s awkward,” Megyn Kelly, the anchor, said, laughing. A large banner on the screen read “BARACK OBAMA RE-ELECTED PRESIDENT.” Then Kelly walked down the hall to the “Decision Desk,” where a team of statisticians firmly rebutted Rove’s speculation.\n\nThis episode was widely described as a “meltdown,” proof that Fox News was having trouble with an inconvenient truth. But it made Kelly look intrepid and independent, bolstering her credibility. (Last month, Fox News announced that she would be moving to prime time.) And it was surely the only thing that happened that night on any cable news network that anyone now remembers—the only moment that could be described as great television.\n\nGriffin calls MSNBC’s first ten years “the lost decade.” One of the only early successes was a televised broadcast of Don Imus’s radio show, a cantankerous but nonpartisan program that remained a staple until 2007, when Imus referred to the Rutgers women’s basketball team as “some nappy-headed hos,” and was fired. (He now appears on the Fox Business Network.) The network started to find its voice in 1999, with the arrival of an excitable and obsessive political analyst named Chris Matthews. His show, “Hardball with Chris Matthews,” was a bridge between the old, news-obsessed MSNBC and its current, opinion-driven incarnation, and for years it appeared every weekday afternoon at five. Among his idealistic colleagues, Matthews is something of an anomaly: a political veteran and an unapologetic insider, with a boyish love for old-fashioned politicians. In the nineteen-eighties, he worked for Tip O’Neill, the Democratic Speaker of the House, but he almost never mentions it, unless he finds himself within earshot of someone who doesn’t know, or might have forgotten. Matthews is one of the few MSNBC personalities who were there for the 2000 election, and surely the only one who’s nostalgic for it. “The best television we ever did was the recount,” he says. “It’s not speeches, it’s not debates, it’s not campaign ads—politics is in the back room, with each side working its edge.”\n\nDuring those “lost” years, MSNBC didn’t seem so liberal, and neither did Matthews: he was a Democrat, perhaps, but one who was offended by Bill Clinton’s misbehavior, wary of Hillary Clinton’s rise, and unimpressed by Al Gore. (In 2000, he voted for George W. Bush.) As Fox News grew, MSNBC often found itself trying, with little success, to poach Fox’s viewers by echoing its point of view. In 2002, the network rebranded itself “America’s NewsChannel,” and it hired conservative hosts like Pat Buchanan, Alan Keyes, and Michael Savage. In 2003, it fired Phil Donahue, who was then its most outspoken liberal host and an increasingly strident opponent of the Iraq war. The executives were trying to match the message to the medium: they guessed, not unreasonably, that talk television, like talk radio, might be a politically particular form. Perhaps liberals simply preferred the gentler, less argumentative approach of, say, public radio. And so maybe a successful cable news network, in the Fox News era, would have to be assertive, sometimes combative, and generally conservative.\n\nAround the time that Donahue was fired, the network hired Olbermann, and soon afterward Griffin, a veteran NBC and MSNBC executive, was named president of the network. Everyone agrees that what happened next was part of no master plan: Olbermann began delivering impassioned monologues, initially over the objections of management, that expressed the growing anger and dismay of liberal America. In Bush’s second term, the network stopped trying to imitate Fox News and started trying to fight back. Olbermann was effective in goading O’Reilly because he had a similar store of bluster and self-regard—if some liberals viewed him as a bully, at least he was their bully, bullying the bigger bully.\n\nOn September 7, 2007, for the first time, Olbermann beat O’Reilly in “the demographic.” O’Reilly soon reclaimed his lead, and his total audience was always substantially bigger. (Fox News would be even more successful if its audience weren’t so old.) But the ratings success confirmed the wisdom of MSNBC’s new direction. The next year, MSNBC gave the nine-o’clock hour to Maddow, a frequent guest of Olbermann’s, and although her style was different, her politics were pretty much the same. MSNBC had become, essentially, a liberal network. In 2010, it adopted a provocative slogan of its own, “Lean Forward,” which slyly suggests a political orientation without spelling it out.\n\nEven Matthews, these days, is given to passionate denunciations of the Republican Party—although he is quick to argue that what has changed is the political landscape, not him. During the primaries in 2008, Matthews said that, when Obama spoke, “I felt a thrill going up my leg.” The remark has haunted Matthews, though it accurately captures the slightly giddy sensibility that is central to his appeal. “Everybody makes fun of me for the ‘thrill up the leg,’ ” he says now. “I’ve got to tell you something: it still works, once in a while—when he talks about our country, when he talks about race.”\n\nMaddow’s success may have made the network more willing to let Olbermann leave, in 2011. There had been a series of public disagreements, including a brief suspension, after he was found to have made donations to political candidates, which was against network rules. Although Olbermann hasn’t said much about MSNBC since his departure (he declined to comment for this story), he has apparently followed the network’s fortunes. Last month, he retweeted a comment about MSNBC’s “impressive” ratings, adding, “This is sarcasm, yes?” Asked if he was criticizing Maddow, he offered a brusque clarification: “It’s about the collapse of that network. I don’t know anything about her anymore; she hasn’t bothered to speak to me since I left.”\n\nOver the years, the evolution of MSNBC has annoyed some people at NBC News, which wanted to keep presenting itself as nonpartisan. During the 2008 campaign, Tom Brokaw intervened to insure that MSNBC’s hosts would serve as commentators, not as anchors, during NBC’s election coverage. And earlier this year Brokaw renewed his complaints: on “The Daily Show,” he reminisced about the time he spent reporting the Watergate story, and suggested that a pundit like Matthews might skip the reporting and rush to speculate. But viewers these days seem to understand that Brian Williams and Rachel Maddow have different jobs, at different networks. This summer, Chuck Todd and Andrea Mitchell, two NBC News correspondents who are also MSNBC hosts, criticized NBC for its involvement in a proposed miniseries about Hillary Clinton. Todd called it “a total nightmare for NBC News”—which is more or less what some people were saying about MSNBC when it first embraced its liberal identity, during the Bush years.\n\nOn May 23rd, President Obama delivered an hour-long speech at the National Defense University, at Fort McNair, during which he declared the end of the war on terror, and promised, in its place, “persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists.” Fox News wasn’t impressed: that night, one of its headlines read “OBAMA GIVES SPEECH TO DISTRACT AMERICANS.” Maddow, by contrast, devoted her entire show to the speech, telling her viewers, “This is a big deal, what happened today.” She provided a granular history of America’s evolving and sometimes contradictory responses to terror, and talked with her guests about which policies, exactly, might change if Obama prevailed upon Congress to repeal the 2001 resolution that authorized the use of military force against terrorists. When the broadcast was over, she walked back to the cluster of cubicles where her staff sits and scrawled an apology on the whiteboard: “I’m sorry about tonight’s show.” Then she changed out of her salt-and-pepper blazer, rubbed most of the makeup off her face, and took a car down to a cheap Japanese restaurant she likes, in the East Village, where, over a few mugs of Sapporo, she talked about what had gone wrong.\n\n“I thought it was going to be a hearts-and-minds speech,” she said. “It was a policy speech, which blew my mind and got me all excited, which made me overreach.” Her opening monologue, known as a “write-through,” had lasted fourteen minutes, and it took her so long to compose that she hadn’t had enough time to work on the interview segments—which had felt, to her, rather abstract and formless. “If you believe that national security ought to have more populist appeal,” she said, “then every time you do a national-security story without populist appeal you’re ruining that project.” Luckily, it was only Thursday, which meant that she had a chance to do it all over again the next day. “Yeah, yeah,” she said, chuckling. “I’ll fix it.”\n\nMaddow’s show is built around a startling proposition: that cable news can be interesting, even addictive, without being contentious. She is guided by a simple mission statement: “Try to increase the amount of useful information in the world.” When she brings in guests, they are usually political allies, sympathetic observers, or friendly experts; the disagreements are generally over strategy, rather than ideology, and they are almost always polite. (She lost one of her most heterodox regular guests in 2010, when she asked Rand Paul one too many questions about his view of the 1965 Civil Rights Act.) Opposing viewpoints are acknowledged, but usually in brief video clips, or dismissive summaries; she has no interest in verbal altercations. Maddow often explains her position in a way that makes it hard to imagine how anyone could disagree—a triumph of rhetoric, but a failure of imagination. One night, covering the argument over a proposed abortion law in North Carolina, she framed it as a debate between pro-choice “people” and pro-life “lobbyists.”\n\nOne of the biggest differences between MSNBC and Fox News is that MSNBC is run by a man who doesn’t take any special interest in politics. “I would be surprised if Phil votes,” Maddow says, exaggerating only slightly. “And, if he does vote, I have no idea who he votes for—he’s a business guy.” She considers this a blessing, because it means that Griffin values her for the viewers she attracts, not for her ideology. “I know I’m never going to get freakin’ talking points from Phil,” she says. “Can you imagine? Like, what would they be? ‘Use more exclamation points! Go! Go! Go!’ ”\n\nGriffin seems to enjoy being regarded as a mercenary among the monks, a career television executive who built a network populated by liberal true believers. His management strategy involves a certain tolerance for the unexpected: he finds hosts and executive producers he trusts, and then gives their programs a great deal of autonomy. Though he checks in often with producers, he typically wants to talk television, not politics. It was Griffin who encouraged Maddow to talk about the Cleveland kidnappings, by means of a friendly phone call to her executive producer, Bill Wolff; he told Wolff that, although this was essentially a local crime story, Maddow’s viewers would be happy to hear about it, as long as they were convinced that she thought it was important.\n\nUnlike Fox News, MSNBC makes no distinction between news and opinion programs—every anchor, Griffin says, is free to express her or his opinion. Even so, the programming is remarkably consistent in its political orientation. The only exception is Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman and the star of “Morning Joe,” which airs from six until nine—and Scarborough is a moderate by modern standards. He is, for instance, a supporter of stricter gun regulations; Hannity calls him Liberal Joe. Virtually every other show belongs to hosts who unstintingly support Obama and the Democrats, with only minor points of disagreement. (Hayes criticizes Obama for his drone killings and surveillance programs, and often conducts friendly interviews with Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who collaborated with Edward Snowden. Melissa Harris-Perry, who appears on weekends at 10 a.m., nearly always defends Obama, and called Greenwald a “jerk.”) Conservatives are far less visible on MSNBC than liberals are on Fox News, and the right-leaning guests who do appear are typically critics of the conservative movement: Steve Schmidt, the Republican strategist, who says that his party is too tolerant of “nuts” and “kooks”; Josh Barro, an advocate for Republican reform who describes himself as a “neoliberal”; Abby Huntsman, the daughter of the failed Presidential candidate Jon, who has described the G.O.P. as a party of “non-inclusion.” The over-all impression is that your average Republican or conservative is simply too fanatical to be part of polite discourse.\n\nThe main differences between the shows are matters of sensibility and emphasis. While most of the hosts provide in-depth analysis, the early-evening programs focus more on sharp-elbowed politics. The four-o’clock hour belongs to Martin Bashir, a British journalist with a prosecutorial demeanor who recently suggested that the National Rifle Association “deserves to be equated with Hitler, on the issue of firearms.” At six o’clock is Sharpton, doing nightly battle against the “immoral” Republican agenda—and, occasionally, against his own teleprompter. One clip, widely circulated online, shows him saying, in his marvellously resonant voice, “Resist, we much—we must, and we will much, about that, be committed.”\n\nThere are three hours of prime-time programming—repeated back to back, for the benefit of West Coast viewers—and the third is by far the strangest. Lawrence O’Donnell, following Hayes and Maddow, enlivens his broadcast with eruptions of bitter mirth. He is a former producer on “The West Wing” and an occasional actor, and he seems to view his program as a theatrical production, driven by passions that even he can’t always fully explain. One night, inspired by some nasty online messages about a Cheerios commercial that depicted a mixed-race family, he delivered a heartfelt tribute to his favorite cereal. “It is now more important than ever for us Cheerios fans to unite,” he said. “Not in rage, against that sick minority of haters who spread their bile anonymously on the Internet, but in love.” Intentional or not, the moment was probably the year’s best satire of cable news.\n\nThe rise of MSNBC—and, for that matter, Fox News—is impossible to imagine without two distinct but simultaneous changes. With the proliferation of cable channels, American television got more fragmented. And, at about the same time, our politics got more polarized—which is to say, more coherent. Where once the two parties were historically contingent, geographically specific coalitions, now they have broadly consistent tendencies: “Republican” means “conservative,” more or less, and “Democrat” means “liberal.” This makes it much easier to choose sides, and much harder not to, because nearly any political conflict can be slotted into this framework. It’s difficult to keep fact separate from opinion when you believe that one side has its facts wrong, and it’s impossible to make judgments about newsworthiness without recourse to an underlying sense of what’s important.\n\nMSNBC and Fox News often express their differing political priorities by covering different stories: Fox viewers, for instance, have learned an awful lot about the exploits of the New Black Panther Party, while MSNBC viewers were treated to a series of concerned segments about that Cheerios commercial, including an interview with one of the actors. For an outlet like NPR News, which considers itself above the fray, this polarization amounts to a mortal threat—if NPR were to hire lots of conservative reporters and producers, to balance out its many liberals, it would quickly cease sounding like NPR. But, for a twenty-four-hour news network, polarization is enormously helpful, because it transforms the chaos of politics into a drama of good ideas against bad ones, enlightenment against ignorance.\n\nThis is how the world looks to a partisan, although “partisan,” like “fundamentalist” or “hipster,” is more often an accusation than a declaration. The situation can be especially vexing for liberals, who are generally less willing than conservatives to define themselves in ideological terms—which helps explain why there are so many more proudly “conservative” politicians than proudly “liberal” ones. (“Progressive,” a term that can seem more pragmatic and less ideological, may help change this. We’ll know things are different when we see a major Democratic politician straining, Romney-like, to be considered “severely” progressive.) It helps explain, too, why partisanship is such a ticklish subject at MSNBC.\n\nHayes believes that the term “partisan” isn’t particularly useful in this era, because the current Republican Party is a historical anomaly: it’s “the most extreme party, along an ideological line, since the Republican Party of the Civil War and Reconstruction,” he says, although he hastens to add that that Republican Party was “awesome.” The idea, widespread at the network, is that today’s Republicans are so unreasonable, and so cynical, that a thoughtful observer has no choice but to oppose their agenda. “There is no mirror image between the two parties, in terms of whether or not they think policy is worth developing,” Maddow says. “If you’re looking for governance, I don’t think they have governing ideas.” Of course, partisans always think they are reasonable people afflicted by unreasonable opponents—and sometimes they are right. There is nevertheless a tension between MSNBC’s twin commitments to thoughtful analysis and passionate advocacy. “There’s places where polarization is really necessary,” Hayes says. “The stuff we’re doing on voting rights—it’s, like, yeah, that should be polarized. There’s people who want to stop people from voting. Those people are wrong. They need to be defeated.”\n\nCompared with the major networks’ nightly news broadcasts, which routinely reach six or seven million viewers each, the cable-news audience is laughably small. O’Reilly generally draws about half as many viewers as the lowest-rated network newscast, and MSNBC’s ratings lag well behind those of, say, the Food Network or Syfy. But the opinion-driven model of cable news is appealing to executives, partly because it’s so cheap—the main expense is the host’s salary. And, because of cable bundling, in which viewers are forced to pay a flat rate for a standard package of a few hundred channels, it’s nearly impossible for a cable news network like MSNBC to lose money, even if only a couple of hundred thousand viewers in “the demographic” are watching. When the bundling system eventually disintegrates, the networks will have to recalculate. Still, MSNBC earned more than $200 million in profits last year, on revenues of $442.5 million. Fox News, which has many more viewers, and CNN, which charges much higher rates to advertisers and cable companies, are even more profitable.\n\nThere is another potential model, and it’s the one that critics of the genre typically say they want: one defined not by spectacle or opinion but by in-depth reporting. Viewers may get more of that from Al Jazeera, the Qatari news network, which launched its American incarnation last week. Earlier this year, at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Ehab al-Shihabi, a top Al Jazeera executive, promised that the new network would focus on investigative journalism. “It’s not about celebrity, it’s not about talent,” he said. “It is about the news itself.”\n\nSitting next to him, and looking very skeptical, was Lawrence O’Donnell. “Every discussion I’ve ever participated in, in this area and this subject, always forgets that PBS exists,” he said. “And what is also forgotten is how many people are choosing—freely choosing—not to watch ‘NewsHour.’ ”\n\nThese days, MSNBC’s main competition is CNN, which announced in January that it had a new president: Jeff Zucker, formerly of NBC, where he had been Griffin’s best friend, colleague, and, in later years, boss. After the announcement, Griffin declared war, in the pages of The New Republic. “All I know is I kicked CNN’s ass without Jeff Zucker,” he said. “Now I gotta kick his ass, too.”\n\nHe speaks in milder but equally firm terms today. “They’re a commodity,” he likes to say of CNN—a utility, providing a service without inspiring much love. “We’re a community.” But often, this year, the commodity won. Even in an opinion-driven era, breaking news draws a crowd, especially in years not divisible by four, and viewers turned to CNN not just for tornado coverage but for the Boston Marathon bombings and the exploding fertilizer plant in Texas. Meanwhile, Nancy Grace, on HLN, feasted on the lurid murder trial of Jodi Arias, which MSNBC ignored. There are also signs that CNN is entering the crowded field of political analysis. Next month, it is launching a new version of the political-debate program “Crossfire,” pitting two former Obama advisers, Stephanie Cutter and Van Jones, against Newt Gingrich and S. E. Cupp, a commentator who was previously the only thoroughgoing conservative at MSNBC.\n\nOne explanation for MSNBC’s struggles is that the network is trying to do something nearly impossible: it is a cable news network for people who don’t like cable news, and may not even like television. Many of the network’s stars seem to fit this description: until recently, Maddow didn’t own a television, and Hayes concedes that his viewing habits tend toward basketball, not political discussion. (Like most people with a serious interest in politics, they get their political news mainly online.) Ailes, despite his political engagement, tends to hire hosts who are television people—Kelly is a lawyer turned local news reporter. Griffin has gone the opposite direction, stocking his network with activists, academics, writers, and politicians. Within MSNBC, this focus on ideas, rather than on entertainment, is a point of pride, something that sets it apart from its lower-brow competition. It might also be a reason that its earnest political discussions aren’t attracting a larger audience.\n\nThis problem is particularly acute for Hayes, who occupies what is traditionally television’s most popular time slot. “Chances are, if you are watching this program, you or someone you love might be a hipster,” he said, during one recent broadcast—joking, but also underscoring the challenge he faces. “Up,” on the weekends, could afford to be digressive, but on “All In” he has to rally the troops. He does fewer in-depth segments on world politics, and he tries to leaven policy discussions, one of his strengths, with minor but irresistible items. He knew, for instance, that viewers would enjoy hearing about Rob Ford, the hot-tempered mayor of Toronto, who was said to be the star of an iPhone video in which someone who looked like him smoked something that looked like crack cocaine. “It’s a fantastic, entertaining story, and it’s got great tape,” Hayes said, although that great tape didn’t include the iPhone video, which never surfaced. But on an average night Hayes remains, by the standards of prime-time cable news, shockingly radical. He has a tendency, for example, to express himself in the language of the academic left, as during a recent Father’s Day segment, which turned into a miniature seminar on the social construction of gender. “This is the great gift of feminism to men,” he said, standing in front of a photograph of a feminist march. “It took a sledgehammer to the most stultifying parts of patriarchy, including the vision of fatherhood in which dads were expected to be distant, stoic, removed creatures from their kids’ lives.”\n\nHayes is popular at MSNBC, but even people rooting for his success wonder how long he will be given to fix the show. Griffin has every incentive not to rush him: if Hayes fails, the decision to give him Schultz’s slot will seem like an unforced error, proof that the network still hasn’t figured out its new identity. One of the truisms of cable news is that a network depends on just a handful of big personalities: each “show” is essentially a single person, or a few people, sitting at a desk. When people talk about the dominance of Fox News, they are talking largely about the dominance of O’Reilly, without whom the network might never have dethroned CNN. In an odd way, this takes some pressure off Hayes, because it suggests that it would be futile for him to radically overhaul his program. Still, he says, he talks to Griffin every day, and meets with him once a week, to review focus-group data.\n\nHayes wouldn’t say exactly what the data were telling him, but in recent months he has often adopted a more vehement tone, and this summer he occasionally indulged in one of Olbermann’s favorite pastimes: baiting his higher-rated rival. One night, after playing a clip of Bill O’Reilly holding forth about crime and drugs and out-of-wedlock births in African-American communities, Hayes accused him of delivering a “cheap, crack-like high” to his “old, fearful white audience.” Another time, Hayes referred to House Republicans as “a bunch of really ideologically zealous teen-agers—teen-agers who have just discovered politics, and view politics as a means of self-expression.” Frowning into the camera, he tapped his desk to emphasize each word. “Get. It. Together,” he said, doing a pretty good impression of a traditional cable-news host.\n\nDespite the ratings trouble, Maddow and Hayes have remained close; his handoff to her, at nine o’clock, is the warmest and often the funniest on the network. On June 10th, he made one conspicuous change to the show: after more than two months of open-collared broadcasts, he wore a tie. During the handoff, Maddow smiled mischievously and raised her eyebrows. “Chris,” she said, “am I allowed to congratulate you on the tie?”\n\nHe grinned and reddened slightly. “Yes,” he said. “I’m all grown up.”\n\nEvery July, Griffin convenes the MSNBC staff to wish the network happy birthday, and to wish for many more. This year’s celebration wasn’t particularly celebratory: on an overcast afternoon, about a hundred of his employees gathered around the bar at Brasserie Ruhlman, an old-fashioned Rockefeller Center restaurant. Griffin tried his best to sound upbeat: he commended the team for its work during last year’s election, and he urged everyone not to worry too much about the ratings.\n\nThere have been signs, though, that Griffin is recalculating. For much of this summer, the biggest story in cable news was the trial of George Zimmerman, the Florida man who killed Trayvon Martin. The network might have been expected to treat the case delicately: Sharpton, who had served as an advocate for Martin’s family, had come to seem more like a participant than like an observer, and Zimmerman has a lawsuit pending against NBC Universal, over a deceptively edited version of his 911 call that was broadcast on “Today.” Instead, MSNBC jumped into the fray, with gavel-to-gavel courtroom coverage and untold hours of legal analysis and speculation; some weeks, Sharpton seemed like the network’s biggest star. The coverage also underscored MSNBC’s increasingly close relationship with African-American viewers, who now make up about thirty per cent of its prime-time audience. After the acquittal, CNN got most of the scoops, including the first interview with a juror, but it was MSNBC that more effectively channelled the anguish and anger of black America. During one broadcast, Harris-Perry appeared to be choking back tears.\n\nGriffin seems to be distancing his network slightly from the wonkish identity of earlier this year. He is talking with Alec Baldwin about hosting a show at ten o’clock on Friday nights, and, more significant, he recently asked Ed Schultz to return to weekdays, this time at five o’clock, taking over for Chris Matthews. The seven-o’clock hour has long been a rerun of “Hardball”; starting this week, it will be a first broadcast, and Griffin hopes that this will consolidate Matthews’s audience, increasing his ratings. “Ed’s voice was missed,” Griffin says, although he concedes that he could have made this change in March, instead of dispatching Schultz to the weekend. “In the big scheme of things, yeah,” he says. “But I’m not kicking myself.”\n\nThe seven-o’clock rerun of “Hardball” drew about as many viewers as Hayes does at eight. If Matthews pulls ahead, he might start seeming less like a lead-in and more like a potential replacement—a relatively painless way to end the Chris Hayes experiment. Griffin says he’s not thinking about telling the rookie Chris and the veteran Chris to trade places. “I mean, look, I’m never going to say never,” he says. “But Chris Matthews has been at seven o’clock a long time.”\n\nIf nothing else, this year’s volatile ratings have demonstrated that even a highly evolved cable news network remains hostage, most nights, to whatever happens to be in the headlines. In order to sustain the thoughtful discussions, MSNBC needs the crude partisan drama that has been in short supply this year: the most important job of an avowedly liberal media outlet, it seems, is to argue against conservatives. Griffin seems eager for this brutally slow political season to be over, giving way to the protracted run-up to the 2014 midterm elections. “Generally, Labor Day is really New Year’s,” he said. “The new year begins.” ♦"
