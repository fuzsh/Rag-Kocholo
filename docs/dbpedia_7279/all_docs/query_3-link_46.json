        "text": "In front of a small crowd in Manchester, The Sex Pistols performed their legendary 1977 gig which was to change the music world forever. Watching that night was Tony Wilson, a Cambridge educated local news reporter who realised that the music world was on the brink of a big change, and he was destined to orchestrate it. Strange in a way that he was chosen as the focus for the film because as he himself admits, he isn't a genius, Shaun Ryder from the Happy Mondays is. Wilson has been described as the 'Where's Wally' of the era because although he didn't directly produce any of the groundbreaking music, he had a part in it from start to finish.\n\n24 Hour Party People could have been shot from the perspective of many people, such as Shaun Ryder, Ian Curtis or Martin Hannett, but Tony Wilson, played by spoof chat show host Steve Coogan aka Alan Partridge is the central role. Coogan fits well into the part, partly because his acting can span many characters so well. When Wilson isn't signing runners up of 'Battle of the Bands' competitions (The Happy Mondays came last) he was covering irreverent news stories for Granada TV, such as hang gliding and ducks that can round up sheep, his unique style brings some real comical moments to these sections.\n\nDirector Michael Winterbottom (Welcome To Sarajevo (1997), Claim, The (2001)) opts for a biopic style with occasional dialogue to the audience, for example in the opening Sex Pistols gig in the Free Trade Hall he points out Mick Hucknell, The Buzzcocks, Martin Hannett and the band he would later produce for, Joy Division (later to become New Order). Other real life stars from the time are also pointed out throughout the film.\n\nThe story in its own right is worthy of a film script whichever angle it is shot from, the concept of making money was never the important issue, it was more of a vehicle to push the music forward, that was the central important thing that brought like minded people together and created the 'Madchester' scene. The Ha√ßienda became a mecca for clubbers and was one of the most famous clubs in the world.\n\nAs in real life, 24 Hour Party People tends to lose focus towards the end, which is probably intentional to reflect the shift towards the emerging rave, guns and drugs culture. It was never going to last, but it didn't need to, the work was done and proved to be a catalyst, influencing musicians the world over.\n\nMy only criticism is that other bands of the same movement (not associated with Factory Records) weren't mentioned - such as The Smiths and The Stone Roses, this is obviously intentional, probably due to the fact that Tony Wilson doesn't see them as having the same sort of genius quality as The Happy Mondays. That aside, from start to finish the film is a disorganised, anarchical mishmash of history in the making, with an inevitably outstanding soundtrack - an incredible story.\n\nAuthor : John Harbisher Of Cinema.com"
