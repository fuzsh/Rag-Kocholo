        "text": "New Order's album ''Power, Corruption and Lies'' would make just as fitting a title for the magnificent ode to Factory Records, ''24 Hour Party People,'' which tracks the rise and fall of that postpunk label.\n\nFactory Records was the home of New Order and the flamboyantly self-destructive Happy Mondays, whose hot-to-the-touch song gives the film its title. The intersecting point of both these groups, and the story that comes in between, is the film's central figure: the Factory Records co-founder and journalist turned postpunk impresario, Tony Wilson, played with a stinging, unctuous vitality by Steve Coogan.\n\nDirected by Michael Winterbottom and written by Frank Cottrell Boyce, the picture is digressive rather than discursive -- an illustrated history as related by Mr. Wilson. Every time he opens his mouth, it's a roaming, hilarious monologue about Factory, by which he means himself. In some ways, it's a power-pop docu-comedy version of ''The Kid Stays in the Picture,'' the story of a man recreating the world around him in his own image. And like the mogul Robert Evans, Mr. Wilson's talent is taste; for a brief period, he had unerring nostrils.\n\nUnlike ''Kid,'' Mr. Wilson's mordant flights of self-glorification are constantly shot down by other witnesses in cameos by the people he's talked about. Mr. Boyce's script has a ruthless and magical tic -- after many of the episodes, the story is refuted on screen. After Mr. Wilson's take on the affair his wife, Lindsay, had with Howard Devoto of the Buzzcocks, the real Mr. Devoto smirks into the camera and shakes his head. (Shirley Henderson's intelligent portrayal of Lindsay Wilson underscores what a bratty boys' club the postpunk movement was.) Mr. Boyce has found a way to unleash these realizations, which feel like the fabled moment of truth just before an Ecstasy rush dies out. Mr. Wilson's prattle is a deluded honesty that's compulsive and drug-fueled.\n\n''People'' can maintain its bleary-eyed momentum because of the inventiveness of the cinematographer, Robby Müller, who imposes a rough griminess on the material. Mr. Winterbottom and Mr. Müller use the photography to contradict Mr. Wilson's own romanticized version of the events. ''Print the legend,'' Mr. Wilson says at one point, both quoting John Ford and laying the foundation for his own often fact-free fabulous fabulism.\n\nAnd this movie is just that -- fabulous. For one thing, the director and cinematographer use that line to frame the film; the gritty, curious roving of the camera is a late 70's corollary to the elegiac realization of ''The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,'' from which the quotation comes. Mr. Winterbottom's most consistent talent is matching his visual approach to the tone of the story; taking a journey through his filmography is like watching Jay Gatsby tossing shirts on the bed, looking for the right one to set off an ensemble.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
