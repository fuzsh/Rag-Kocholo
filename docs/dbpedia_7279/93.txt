“Loud, hilarious, and enormously entertaining, 24 Hour Party People makes you want to toss current FM radio out on its pre-fab, corporate-sponsored backside.”

—The Austin Chronicle

Tony Wilson (a never-better Steve Coogan) starts a record label, and with acts like Joy Division and the Happy Mondays, changes music forever. Director Michael Winterbottom chronicles Factory Records through the decline and fall of its musical empire, from “God Save the Queen” to pills ‘n’ thrills, 24 HOUR PARTY is a funny, cheeky, smart-arsed look at the self-made legends, bullshit artists, and relics of a bygone era, celebrating its 20th Anniversary. Screening in 35mm.
