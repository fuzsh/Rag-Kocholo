WKSU

WKSU (89.7 FM) – branded 89.7 WKSU – is a non-commercial educational radio station licensed to serve Kent, Ohio, and primarily serving the Akron metropolitan area. WKSU also reaches much of Greater Cleveland, and extends throughout Northeast Ohio with two low-power broadcast relay stations and four full-power repeaters. Owned by Kent State University, WKSU broadcasts a mix of public radio and classical music, and serves as the local affiliate for NPR, American Public Media, and Public Radio International. Besides a standard analog transmission, WKSU broadcasts over four HD Radio channels, and is available online. The WKSU studios are located on the campus of Kent State University, while the station transmitter is in Copley. Radio operations within Kent State University can be traced back to 1940 with the establishment of the Kent State Radio Workshop, a division of the university's School of Speech. The Radio Workshop entered into a partnership with WADC to air a series of 15-minute long radio dramas produced by the Workshop on Tuesday afternoons; this began on March 3, 1940 with the program Lunch Room Nocturne, performed at the WADC studios in Tallmadge. Studios were eventually constructed on the university campus for the Radio Workshop that were comparable to that of a licensed radio station; the Radio Workshop also assumed production of a weekly radio program by Kent State faculty members from WTAM in Cleveland, that program was also moved to WADC. One of the last programs offered on WADC was an adaptation of the play Arsenic and Old Lace by the university's theater department on November 31, 1942. Read more at Wikipedia...
