        "text": "TOPIC: \"Let's talk about the responsibility of being a trusted local source of journalism. This year, WKSU marks 70 years since it first went on the air, a long history of serving Northeast Ohio. WKSU has evolved over that time growing from one small transmitter in 1950 to five powerful transmitters and two translators (essentially small transmitters) connecting the people in the 22 counties the station reaches with the information they need. Information comes in from a variety of sources including local reporting from a team of experienced WKSU journalists who live in the region and work every day to better understand and cover the stories that matter to our audience. We combine that with news from around the country and the world from NPR and a variety of other programming choices through four different programming streams that WKSU offers. Our goal, always, is to present balanced, thoughtful objective programming thatâs engaged with our audience and helps them to better understand the world around them\".\n\nAndrew joined WKSU News in 2014. He oversees the daily operations of the WKSU news department and its reporters and hosts, coordinates daily coverage, and serves as editor. His commitment is to help foster reporting that marks the best of what public radio has to offer: a mix of first-rate journalism with great storytelling. His responsibilities also include long-term strategic planning for news coverage in Northeast Ohio that serves WKSUâs audience via on-air, online, by social media and through emerging technologies. Andrew also serves as a back-up local host for Morning Edition, Here and Now and All Things Considered.\n\nBefore joining the staff of WKSU, Andrew was assistant news director at WBGO-FM in Newark, NJ. Along with his management duties there, he also anchored afternoon drive time news, reported on local and regional stories and hosted a monthly call-in program with then-Newark Mayor Cory Booker, among others. Prior to joining the staff at WBGO in 1998, he worked as a freelance reporter/producer in the New York metropolitan area. He was also a stringer for a number of networks including NPR, ABC Radio and AP Radio.\n\nDuring his time at WKSU, the station's newsroom has been honored with dozens of awards from Ohio Associated Press Media Editors, Ohio Excellence in Journalism Awards, the Ohio chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists, Public Radio News Directors Inc. (PRNDI), RTDNA Edward R. Murrow Awards. Andrew himself has been recognized with a number of awards, including, nationally, from PRNDI and, in the New Jersey/New York area, from the New Jersey Associated Press Broadcasters Association, the New Jersey Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists and others. He served twice as president of the New Jersey Associated Press Broadcasters Association. He is currently a member of the board of the Akron Press Club.\n\nAndrew was born in Louisville, KY, and holds the commission of Colonel in the Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels. He and his family now live in Hudson.\n\nSave the dateâ¦..\n\nMay 16, 2020, will be the District 6650 Conference held at the Kent Conference Center in Jackson Township!
