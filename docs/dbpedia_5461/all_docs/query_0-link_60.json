        "text": "Kent State University and the University of Akron have announced starting Tuesday afternoon, all in-person classes will be moved online to prevent the spread of COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nMiami University, the University of Toledo, the University of Akron, University of Cincinnati and other colleges around the state have similarly suspended face-to-face classes.\n\nKent State president Todd Diacon sent an email to the community with the following schedule:\n\nMarch 16-20: Classes will be held via remote instruction.\n\nMarch 23-29: Spring break will occur as scheduled.\n\nMarch 30-April 10: Classes will be held via remote instruction.\n\nApril 13: Face-to-face classes will resume.\n\nUniversity of Akron President Gary Miller sent an email with a similar schedule:\n\n\"No classes will be held the rest of this week or next week to allow faculty time to develop their plans for migrating their courses to on-line instruction when the University returns from spring break on March 30,\" the email reads. \"We’re convinced we can offer a quality online experience for students but believe that it is prudent to have the time to properly prepare that coursework. Not holding classes between now and March 30, when spring break concludes, will give the faculty and staff the needed time to be prepared and make sure students have the ability to access online offerings.\"\n\nCoronavirus In Ohio: Live Coverage\n\nAt Kent State, students are encouraged to go home, but residence and dining halls will remain open. The Warren Student Recreation and Wellness Center will be closed until April 13, and all events on campus are canceled until April 12. All university-sponsored travel is also canceled until in-person classes resume.\n\nUniversity of Akron is canceling all events until April 20, and its residence halls will also remain open.\n\nKent State and University of Akron are the most recent colleges to follow a national trend to help stop the spread of COVID-19. Ohio State University announced Monday it would suspend in-person classes through the end of the month.\n\nAfter health officials confirmed three cases of coronavirus in Cuyahoga County, Gov. Mike DeWine held a press conference Tuesday asking all colleges and universities to move classes online.\n\nFifteen people are currently being tested, according to the Ohio Department of Health. No cases have been confirmed on Kent State or University of Akron's campuses.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, two students from Solon High School and four students from Hawken Upper School in Gates Mills were in self-quarantine after health officials determined they had contact with one of the three confirmed cases in Ohio.\n\nThe Ohio Department of Health makes the following recommendations to protect yourself from illness:\n\nWash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; dry hands with a clean towel or air dry hands.\n\nUse alcohol-based hand sanitizer when soap and water are unavailable.\n\nCover your mouth with a tissue or sleeve when sneezing or coughing. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.\n\nStay home when you are sick.\n\nAvoid contact with people who are sick.\n\nOhio's coronavirus call center is open to answer questions from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily. The hotline number is 1-833-4-ASK-ODH or 1-833-427-5634."
