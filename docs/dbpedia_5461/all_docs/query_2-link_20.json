        "text": "The local media landscape of Northeast Ohio reflects the alarming trends faced by newsrooms across the country. With financial and journalistic resources continuing to shrink, the gap between news organizations in Northeast Ohio and the diverse needs of consumers continues to widen, often at the unfortunate expense of residents seeking basic information to navigate daily life.\n\nThere is an opportunity for innovation in our local news and information ecosystem, and for the local philanthropic community to help support more collaborative news ecosystems. Here are the initiatives the foundation has undertaken so far.\n\nAmerican Journalism Project/Signal Cleveland: On Nov. 9, 2021, a coalition of Cleveland-based organizations and the American Journalism Project (AJP) announced they were partnering to launch an independent, community-led, nonprofit newsroom serving Cleveland (Associated Press story). With an anticipated staff of 25 at launch, the new organization will be one of the largest local nonprofit news startups in the country. The coalition of philanthropies, which has raised over $5.8 million to date for the organization, includes the Cleveland Foundation, the John S. And James L. Knight Foundation, Sisters of Charity Foundation of Cleveland, Visible Voice Charitable Fund, The Center for Community Solutions, The Char and Chuck Fowler Family Foundation, and AJP. Signal Cleveland officially launched in October 2022 under the direction of editor-in-chief Lila Mills. In December 2022, AJP announced the hiring of Rita McNeil Danish as the Signal Ohio CEO. Signal Akron was announced in 2023 and there are additional cities in the pipeline for 2024 and beyond.\n\nEnvironmental Justice Local Journalism Collaborative: In February 2021, we partnered with Black Environmental Leaders (BEL), The Center for Community Solutions and The George Gund Foundation to issue an open call for ideas to test, refine and/or build out an environmental justice reporting project in Greater Cleveland to elevate Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) leaders and organizations taking action to improve the health of our communities, our climate, our environment and our democracy. As we’ve seen all too clearly over the past year, COVID has laid bare the disproportionate impacts experienced by BIPOC communities, according to data from the CDC analyzed by the New York Times. Three winning collaborative projects received $10,000 each in microgrant support. The aim of this commitment is to continue the spirit of collaboration in our evolving information ecosystem. Projects include:\n\nAsk The Land Environmental Reporting Initiative\n\nPartners: Collaborative NewsLab @ Kent State University, The Land, Northeast Ohio Solutions Journalism Collaborative, ideastream, WKSU, La Mega Media\n\nThe collaborative will utilize two-way texting to give voice to underrepresented communities in shaping local news coverage. Through relationships with neighborhood-based organizations and other community partners, Ask The Land will recruit neighborhood residents to enroll in texting conversations, source environmental justice stories directly from these communities at the grassroots level, provide local news coverage about environmental issues for residents and stakeholders in these communities in an easily accessible way, and provide members of the community with a place to ask questions and seek support and advice about the environmental justice and equity issues that affect them.\n\nFarmers markets, nutrition assistance programs serve as oases in Cleveland's food deserts\n\nBold plan emerges to improve east side’s lakefront access\n\nLocal gardeners find inspiration and show off their green thumbs at GardenWalk Cleveland\n\nGardenWalk Cleveland invites you to stop and smell the flowers this weekend\n\nForming an Emerald Necklace\n\nPartners: A Greater Buckeye, Korey Smerk, Black Valve Media, Cleveland Documenters\n\nThe collaborative will produce a series of weekly short features over the course of 12 weeks that will culminate in a documentary highlighting the environmental struggles and resiliency of the Buckeye-Woodland and Buckeye-Shaker neighborhoods. These shorts will primarily feature work creating greenspaces of all sizes, addressing food apartheid, reducing invisible boundaries, as well as connecting with initiatives outside of the neighborhood that address environmental issues.\n\nHealing Spaces\n\nPartners: Cleveland Documenters, Neighborhood Connections, Black Girl Media, WOVU, A Greater Buckeye\n\nThe collaborative will utilize Cleveland Documenters to talk with community leaders who have activated vacant land in their neighborhoods and, by doing so, tended to their community’s need for beautiful spaces that feed the soul. This project will be done in three phases: a listening survey; reporting; and transformation. Cleveland Documenters will begin by surveying their neighbors, Neighbor Up members and other Cleveland residents about their environmental justice concerns. A team of Cleveland Documenters will then conduct video interviews with community gardeners talking about their work and its history, successes and challenges, and what the future holds. They will also take the learnings from the surveys and transform a vacant lot into a vibrant community space; they will share videos, talkbacks, and other communications from this space as well as others throughout the summer via publishing partner A Greater Buckeye and with media partner WOVU. The project will close with the showing of a short documentary in the fall.\n\nCity Bureau, Documenters.org & Cleveland Documenters: Chicago-based City Bureau brings journalists and communities together in a collaborative spirit to produce media that is impactful, equitable and responsive to the public. In December 2019, City Bureau co-founders Andrea Hart and Darryl Holliday presented to a packed house at The City Club of Cleveland, in addition to hosting public newsroom events in Cleveland and Akron to vet next steps with local journalists and community members. The pair were in Northeast Ohio to debut the City Scrapers pilot we brought to the area in partnership with Akron Community Foundation. Using tools and technologies developed for Documenters.org, the City Bureau team compiled a detailed list of all governmental bodies that host public meetings in Cleveland and Akron (city governments) as well as Cuyahoga and Summit (county governments). The team gathered more than 150 city- and county-level government bodies that host recurring meetings that are open to the public. These meetings are where citizens can directly interface with elected officials about their needs and concerns, often before any vote is taken. By standardizing and sharing meeting locations, dates, times and official records for each of those agencies through its free, easy-to-browse website – Documenters.org – City Bureau makes it easier than ever to monitor and analyze local decisions, trace community impact and spark policy discussions.\n\nIn May 2020, Neighborhood Connections announced the launch of a one-year pilot of Cleveland Documenters, in partnership with City Bureau and with support from the Cleveland Foundation and the Visible Voice Charitable Fund of the Cleveland Foundation. Neighborhood Connections will recruit, train and pay Greater Clevelanders to document official committee meetings of the Cuyahoga County and City of Cleveland governments and contribute to a communal pool of public knowledge. Residents will sign up to be trained and paid $16/hour to document these meetings and publish content on Documenters.org. In August, Lawrence Caswell was hired as the field coordinator, and helped lead a group of more than 80 participants in a session on how to become a Cleveland Documenter. The Documenters program became fully operational in November, handing out nearly 150 meeting assignments in its first three months, while providing a searchable database of more than 70 public agencies.\n\nNortheast Ohio Solutions Journalism Network Collaborative: The foundation helped Northeast Ohio secure $100,000 from Solutions Journalism Network for a local news collaborative. The group – which now includes more than 20 newsrooms across Cleveland and Akron –has been meeting regularly and has selected both a coordinator (former Plain Dealer reporter Sharon Broussard) and an editorial focus (domestic violence). The pandemic forced the collaborative to pivot its focus, and the group has focused on COVID-19 from a solutions-oriented lens on community recovery and resiliency efforts. To provide increased capacity for participating media, we have also funded a two-year Report for America position in 2020, which will provide a reporter who will work across Northeast Ohio newsrooms in service of the broader collaborative. This position is already paying dividends, as evidenced by the fact that a story on census completion during COVID-19 appeared across five different news outlets: FreshWater, ideastream, Scene, Cleveland.com and Euclid Observer. The Northeast Ohio Solutions Journalism Collaborative has also launched social media properties to keep the community informed of its work across the network.\n\nReimagining Journalism Series @ The City Club: Starting in 2020, the foundation has sponsored a series of forums at The City Club of Cleveland about the changing face of journalism in our region:\n\nLocal Journalism in Crisis: A conversation with NPR Media Correspondent David Folkenflik on the intersection of local journalism, free speech, an educated citizenry, and democracy.\n\nA Community Vision for Local News: A conversation with Karen Rundlet (director of journalism at Knight Foundation) and John Thornton (Texas Tribune founder, American Journalism Project co-founder) regarding their perspectives on the state of local journalism in America.\n\nNew Kids on the Block in Greater Cleveland: A discussion with the leadership of four start-up efforts – Sharon Broussard (Northeast Ohio Solutions Journalism), Ron Calhoun (The Cleveland Observer), Julian Khan (A Greater Buckeye) and Ken Schneck (The Buckeye Flame) – as they share their aspirations and contributions to Greater Cleveland’s changing media landscape.\n\nCommunity Information Needs Collaborative: In October 2019, we partnered with Akron Community Foundation, The Center for Community Solutions, The George Gund Foundation and the Knight Foundation to issue a RFP to provide up to $110,000 for several microgrants to journalist and resident media-maker projects in Akron and Cleveland. Stemming from our research with the Knight Foundation, a pair of workshop convenings, and our exploration of best practices in other communities, our goal was to incentivize collaborative local journalism projects that address community information needs and support new and innovative partnerships among legacy, start-up and citizen journalists in Northeast Ohio. The selected projects include more than 20 legacy outlets, hyper-local publications and resident media makers tackling basic information needs such as infant mortality, witness protection and rights, literacy, eviction, safety and food insecurity. Projects include:\n\nBlack maternal health & infant mortality\n\nThis project will use restorative journalism by empowering women in Cleveland to tell their first-person narrative via a number of channels, including written stories, radio and photography.\n\nBeauty for Ashes: Stories of Maternal Hope\n\nWitness protection and rights\n\nThis collaboration will help close a gap in understanding about the safety and rights of those who witness crime, while pushing for solutions that could promote a safer system in Cleveland.

It will strive to better connect residents to food and other key resources around health and well-being.\n\nThe Real Cleveland Food Experience\n\nEviction\n\nThis collaborative will tackle the issue of eviction and tenant rights in Akron and Cleveland across a number of communication platforms from the perspective of both tenants and landlords, ultimately producing a tenant’s guide in both English and Spanish.

In late April of 2019, we collaborated with the Knight Foundation to debut original research on the local news and information ecosystem in Northeast Ohio. Our analysis of the local news and information ecosystems in Cleveland and Akron assessed local information needs, gaps in access and infrastructure, and assets that the Knight Foundation, the Cleveland Foundation, and our partners might leverage toward building collaborative solutions. This analysis was rooted in the understanding that both foundations – Cleveland and Knight – are already making considerable investments in community well being that address a wide variety of local issues, and that a stronger local news and information is critical to making those efforts effective.\n\nFreshWater Cleveland: As part of FreshWater’s “On the Ground” reporting series, we supported a community correspondent program for the Fairfax neighborhood, designed to lift up local voices by equipping, training and mentoring residents to become community storytellers. Neighborhood leaders identified four residents to participate in the pilot program, led by resident Charlotte Morgan. After completing their classroom instruction and meeting their mentors, the correspondents have begun producing stories:\n\nEverybody in the pool! Fairfax lifeguard promotes benefits of swimming\n\nCaring and sharing: Manna House offers safety and services in Fairfax neighborhood\n\nFairfax boxing coach gives back by developing champions, inside the ring and out\n\nEye on Ohio: The mission of Eye on Ohio is to promote the public good by pursuing in-depth, underreported and high-impact journalism which exposes injustice and explores its consequences.

Last year, Eye on Ohio reported 13 in-depth public service stories that were picked up across the state. The Cleveland Foundation has provided funding for the following in-depth original stories over the past six months via freelance journalists based in Northeast Ohio:\n\nDown But Not Out in East Cleveland\n\nHidden Charges: What’s on Your Electric Bill?\n\nWhy Did Utility Bills Go Up As Electricity Prices Went Down?\n\nHow Have Deregulation and Extra Fees Affected Your Energy Bill?\n\nA quarter of Cuyahoga County homes have no internet access — why that matters and how it’s changing\n\nWOVU: WOVU 95.9 FM-LP is a community radio station that is an enterprise of Burten, Bell, Carr Development Inc., the nonprofit community development corporation serving Cleveland’s Central and Kinsman neighborhoods.
