        "text": "On March 1, 2023 as I collected receipts for my 2022 income taxes, I rediscovered old family files of cherished photos from my childhood. Underneath these files at the bottom of the bin, and on its own, I found one single, old postcard. Looking at the addressed side, I quickly recognized the loopy handwriting addressed with my childhood nickname, Laurie. Focusing on the address, I was startled to read writing I hadn’t seen in 53 years. It was a February 22, 1970 postcard from Allison!\n\nMemories flooded back as I read the postcard. Allison was inviting me to visit Kent State,\n\n“Why don’t you come up for a weekend, Laurie. I’m sure you can train or bus both ways.”\n\nBack in 1970 Allison’s postcard lifted me up from my mundane 9th grade life and I welcomed the opportunity to visit Allison where she was a freshman attending Kent State University. Over the next few weeks we planned for me to take a train to Kent, Ohio and visit Allison over the April 24-26, 1970 weekend.\n\n53 years later it is amazing to have this postcard literally fall in my lap, especially since I had not seen the postcard or read it since 1970. And what a postcard! It included Allison’s music suggestions, her play list, reflecting those times when we were groovin’ to the best rock n roll ever.\n\nPlease read my account of that memorable weekend in April 1970 when I visited Allison at Kent State and hung out with her for the very last time.\n\nVisiting Allison at Kent State\n\nIt’s April 23rd and Allison’s birthday. I’m in my bedroom in Pittsburgh. I am fidgety and sleepless as tomorrow I am going to visit my big sister at college, just the two of us together for the weekend at Kent State. She had been at Kent since the previous fall but this was my first solo visit to her, my first taste of teenage freedom.\n\nMy parents give me permission to skip junior high school that Friday to take the afternoon train from Pittsburgh west to Kent, Ohio. This was no small thing as the Krauses follow the rules and school is most important to them. It will be my first time traveling on my own.\n\nThe plan is for us to celebrate over the weekend together as my 15th birthday and Allison’s 19th occur in close succession. Going to plan, on Sunday our parents will meet us in Kent for a double birthday dinner, then I will join them for the return drive to Churchill, our residential area in Pittsburgh.\n\nEver since the previous autumn of 1969 when Allison moved out of the house at 18 to start college at Kent State University in the honors program, we sorely missed her energy and were all a little lost. Contact with Allison had been curtailed to weekly long-distance phone calls, infrequent letters in the mail and short visits when she was on break. Our family of four was now a family of three and none of us had adjusted to the new configuration yet.\n\nMy folks were struggling because their eldest child had grown up and left home. Although it was their dream to send their kids to college, having them walk out the door and leave was another matter.\n\nMy experience after Allison left for college was complicated by our family’s recent move from Wheaton, Maryland. Maryland had entered the 1970’s but Pittsburgh was hanging back by a decade or two. I wasn’t happy shifting back in time. On top of missing Allison and becoming the sole kid living at home, I felt on my own in an unfamiliar world, disconnected from my friends and our “with it” life back in Wheaton. Allison only made a pitstop in Pittsburgh, going straight to Kent after setting up her bedroom. I was jealous of her freedom.\n\nAh, but this morning I begin to feel the dream of what was before me for the weekend. How I was going to be set free from the confines of this uncomfortable new life, released from the repugnant, behind-the-times school system enforcing “no jeans” dress codes and the use of thick wooden paddles to punish students. The best I could hope for in Pittsburgh was to turn on my radio and if I was lucky hear the Beatles, Janis Joplin, Steppenwolf, the Jefferson Airplane and Jimi Hendrix, but only on FM. Today I was going to rejoin Allison, her friends and the rest of the Baby Boomers responding to the trumpets of tumultuous change, and a call for peace, blaring across the U.S.\n\nThe move to Churchill came about because Dad was transferred from his position in Maryland back to Westinghouse headquarters. Over the summer we returned to the same Pittsburgh neighborhood where we made our home in 1962, except this time to a new house just around the corner from our old one.\n\nInstead of attending the now legendary Woodstock festival and grooving with more than half a million young people in upstate New York, Allison and I were packing our belongings, forced to leave our comfortable teenage world in Maryland and the buzz of D.C. Television and newspaper headlines around the world heralded Woodstock. We also learned that President Nixon was watching the festival intently, rattled by the size and peaceful energy of this monumental gathering. To my parents, it didn’t matter that their kids didn’t want to move back to Pittsburgh or that we wanted to attend the get-together of the century.\n\nWe were living through extreme events that August. Just a week before Woodstock, headlines blasted coverage of Charles Manson and the Tate-LaBianca murders. The press fed off the gory, chilling news of actress Sharon Tate’s killing, she and her unborn child and three guests brutally murdered in L.A. These tragic killings shook America to its core and the public was fed via TV and newspapers that it was the 60’s counterculture that prompted Manson’s murders. Parents were worried for the safety of their teenagers. This made an impression on me and Allison, and we began to understand cultural tensions that were gaining momentum at this time and would later touch our family in profound ways.\n\nBefore 1970 our parents were part of the “silent majority,” which meant they were inclined to go along silently in political matters outside of their personal lives. Nixon depended on this acquiescence. With two daughters and no sons, the Vietnam war didn’t touch our family directly but Allison and I were all in, wishing to protect our friends and our compatriots. Then on December 1, 1969, at President Nixon’s direction, the U.S. Selection Service instituted two lotteries to determine those who were to serve in the Vietnam war – the dreaded draft.\n\nWe saw firsthand how Allison’s friends, young men her age of 18, were forced to participate in the draft, mostly against their will. U.S. laws didn’t permit anyone under 21 to vote or even drink hard liquor yet they set up this lottery to send 18-plus year-old American boys to their deaths. Young men under 21 had no avenue to have their voices heard about Vietnam or participate in an election to vote against it. These lethal dichotomies struck us to our core.\n\nThat August from the crowds at Woodstock and in the streets across the country we saw how young people were sick and tired of taking this BS. Then with the Manson murders as their vehicle, the media and law enforcement vilified us and our counter-cultural world, calling us “dirty hippies.” Even at this young age we understood that there were deeper political forces working to scapegoat young people.\n\nAs we loaded our life into boxes and said sad goodbyes to our friends, Allison explained to me how this chapter ending was about more than just moving and leaving our peeps. She clued me in about the change taking place across the United States and in our own home. This was bigger than us. I could always count on my sister to shine a light on what really mattered. And it wasn’t just because she was four years older than me. She inherently understood things far beyond her sphere of knowledge and experience.\n\nIn Maryland, Allison and I had finally begun to find support, love and a closeness that we hadn’t felt elsewhere. Maybe it was because we were attending an experimental public school and thrived in the cosmopolitan atmosphere. Or it might have been the times and the people we were running with, but growing up in Wheaton was a high point for us both.\n\nNow it is seven months later and I’m still licking my wounds. I am thankful this trip to Kent has arrived. The thought of a weekend with Allison is already lifting my spirits. It is a welcome change to be living life again, instead of waiting and counting the days.\n\nI hear Mom remind me through my closed bedroom door, “Laurie, you better get a move on or we’ll be late.” I chuckle. With my parents involved, there is absolutely no chance of me arriving late for the train. Even though it takes only half an hour tops to drive downtown to the train station, they want to leave two hours ahead of time. Arriving early is a way of life for my family, at least 15 minutes with 30 even better. Closing my suitcase, I am stoked to get going and start my weekend of independence with Allison at Kent State NOW.\n\nDriving downtown to the train station, Dad’s at the wheel of his forest green ‘67 Chrysler Newport with Mom seated across from him in the front seat. Each workday Dad drove a lengthy daily commute to his Westinghouse job. His car was just about the only place he was permitted to smoke cigarettes unabated. Called “the ashtray,” today it smells like cigarettes and Dad’s cologne, Old Spice. I’m in the backseat in my usual spot, sitting behind Dad, just outside his line of sight in the rearview mirror. L.B. (Lazy Bones) my dog sits in Allison’s spot at the car window across from me, looking out.\n\nWho sat where in the car had been a source of family strife, especially since over the years as a family we spent so much time riding around together in this car. Until recently, Allison sat behind Mom. Even though Allison was away at college, I stayed in the same spot behind Dad – won from our long-fought turf wars for dominance. In the end Allison and I settled for an imaginary line down the center on the back seat and an oath, “You stay on your side, I stay on mine.”\n\nHeading to the Parkway, we drive by our old house on Beulah Road. We lived in Churchill the first time from 1962 to early ‘67. That house represented so much to my parents. How they had made it on their own, fulfilling and living the American Dream. Working at Westinghouse, saving their money and being able to buy a brand-new home in the hillside of their coveted bedroom-community suburb.\n\nLooking out the window of the car during our ride to the train station, the massive forest surrounding the Westinghouse Research Center flies by. Even though for years our house faced the fenced and heavily wooded green space surrounding the Westinghouse R&D facilities, none of us except Dad was ever permitted to set one foot on that property.\n\nDriving on the Parkway we are lucky it is clear with no back-up traffic at the Squirrel Hill Tunnel. That’s the area of Pittsburgh considered the Jewish section. My parents were not interested in moving there, choosing instead Churchill with far fewer Jewish people in the mix. They wanted to buy new construction situated closer to the Westinghouse headquarters for Dad.\n\nComing into downtown, I see Pittsburgh’s emblematic steel mills and smoke stacks on the river. I gaze at the gigantic rust-colored structures with smoke and fire emitting from steel-mill activity along the banks of the Monongahela River. To me it looks more like industrial art until I remember all the pollution that freely pours out of the mill chimneys into the air we breathe. It creates the black “ring around the collar” on my father’s white business shirts.\n\nLess than a half hour later we arrive at the train station in downtown Pittsburgh. As Dad parks the car, I’m already raring to go. I wait in line to purchase the train ticket that is my 15th birthday present and I’m beyond excited to take my pass to freedom. For my parents, this moment is bittersweet and their mixed feelings are written all over their faces. They’re happy to see me off yet they dread the return to the empty house this weekend. I think they are secretly wishing they could join me – at least that’s how Mom looks. Even though it makes no sense, they’re worried I’ll never come home again and will leave like Allison left. To me it seems they are holding on too tight. I remind them we’ll be together on Sunday for our birthday supper as I kiss and hug them both goodbye thinking, “I’m free.”\n\nBoarding the train and the near-empty car, I select a seat by the window on the right facing west. As the train moves forward, I watch Pittsburgh’s steel mills that line the river valleys turn into farm land and forests of rolling hills. It is a three-hour trip west to Kent.\n\nEver since I can remember Allison admired Kent State and told us, “That’s where I want to go to college.” As youngsters in Cleveland during the late 50’s and early 60’s, on fair-weathered Sunday afternoons our family would take long drives through the beautiful countryside south, where Kent was located. Allison’s first choice for college had become a reality so here I am on a train, on my way solo to meet Allison living her college dream.\n\nI remember the last time we were all in Kent in the fall of 1969 to take Allison to campus. With L.B. in tow, we drove to Kent State to move her into a dormitory to begin her studies. On the trip from Pittsburgh, Allison was bursting at the seams; she couldn’t wait to begin her adult life of independence and this new chapter.\n\nArriving on campus, we moved her belongings into Metcalf Hall located in an outer region of the Kent State campus. Allison wasn’t happy about being so far out or sharing a room with three other young women – she had never shared her bedroom before and treasured her privacy. Right after the holidays in the new year, Allison finagled her move to another dormitory room at the center of campus, a single in Engleman Hall. I will be staying with her there for the weekend, just the two of us in her dorm room.\n\nI think about how grateful I am we began forging our peaceful sisterly bonds back in Wheaton. We attended an experimental public school system that mixed grades in classes, enabled free thinking and offered an open campus. I was in junior high but at John F. Kennedy High School, Allison benefited from a full-blown ‘60’s experiment with innovations in teaching, in particular fostering independence. In this fertile and positive environment, we found solidarity easier to nurture between us. We made peace with each other, leaving behind our family-taught ways of bickering and bullying.\n\nAllison turned me on to pot a year earlier, but not without a lot of coaxing and negotiation. Over chats in our neighboring woods behind the Glenmont shopping center with friends my age who also had older brothers and sisters, we suspected our older siblings were smoking marijuana, and probably taking L.S.D. and mushrooms.\n\nAmong my friends, I was nominated to ask Allison to help us get some. I knew for sure she was getting high and we all felt Allison to be the most approachable among our siblings.\n\nNot long after our conversation in the woods, I knocked on Allison’s bedroom door and she let me in. With Jimi Hendrix’s Are You Experienced? playing on her record player, an album we bought together, I asked her if she would turn me on. She was caught off guard. I told her I knew she was smoking marijuana, that I was asking for me and my friends, younger sisters of her friends, and that we would pay for it. Allison said she’d have to think about it and get back to me.\n\nDays later, still not hearing back, I asked Allison if she had made her decision. In her room, away from our parents, she told me, “I’m not going to be able to help you.” I was crestfallen and really pissed, knowing Allison was my only shot.\n\nI told her if she didn’t help me, I’d be forced to go elsewhere to score. That if I was busted or had trouble from a stranger, she’d get it from our parents, even worse than me. I told her I needed her experience and connections. She knew I was right and grudgingly acquiesced. Then, ever the negotiator, she insisted I go in with her on a water pipe she found at the smoke shop at Wheaton Plaza. Later that week we bought that pipe made of amber glass with a carved wooden bowl elegantly packaged in a box lined with cobalt blue fabric.\n\nIt felt like a sacred ceremony when Allison turned me on to marijuana in her bedroom. Adding water to the pipe, Allison’s eyes sparkled with anticipation and generosity as she filled the wooden bowl with keef, powdered hash composed of raw cannabinoids. One of the finest grades of marijuana available then, and probably still. Using the water pipe, we toked up together and I got high on the first try.\n\nSpeeding west on the railroad tracks, I remember how there are still issues to be navigated and healed but I am looking forward to getting stoned with my sister again.\n\nAs the Kent, Ohio train stop nears, I gather my suitcase and stare out the window anticipating our magnificent weekend. When the train slows to a stop, I step off into the center of town. As I stand on the sidewalk, the cars whizz by in late day traffic and I search faces of pedestrians for Allison. Her statuesque presence and electric energy are nowhere to be found. Over my shoulder I notice the Cuyahoga River and remember Dad’s stories about how just last summer the river caught fire, fed by decades of dumped toxic waste.\n\nThen I see Allison rushing toward me, arriving out of breath and with a big smile and hug hello. “Sorry I’m late” she explains and adds, “I had a class and came here as soon as I got out.”\n\nEven though it’s late April, we’re both still wearing our winter coats because spring has barely sprung. The weather is cold and damp with few lilacs nearing bloom. We walk together through town toward the Kent State University campus. Passing by the Kent Stage, the town cinema and night club, we see the movie Woodstock written on the marquee and smile. Allison shares, “Tomorrow night we are thinking of going to see Woodstock, the movie” and asks if I want to join her and her boyfriend Barry. You bet I want to go!\n\nWoodstock was a big deal for us and just about every young person across the U.S. Nine months earlier in August of ’69, the outdoor concert was held in upstate New York over three days of peace, love and harmony set to the best rock ‘n roll of our generation. An audience of more than half a million revelers, people just like us, camped out in nature and immersed themselves in the intoxicating music. They all took care of each other and shared a deep sense of community and mutual support that would define the hopes of this era. Woodstock broke the ground for a period of peaceful self-expression that would be remembered for decades to come. But even though Allison had graduated high school and was 18 years old, she was not allowed to attend Woodstock. She had been grounded and forbidden by my mom.\n\nIt happened one day when Mom was unexpectedly home early from work. When she delivered clean, folded laundry to Allison’s unattended room she found what she considered “a rat’s nest.” It wasn’t dirty, just messy with her bed unmade, but this was unacceptable in our house. Mom decided to clean it up and discovered what no parent wished to find: pot, LSD, mescaline, our amber glass water pipe – and the clincher, birth control pills.\n\nAt 14, I was too young to consider Woodstock and never bothered to ask. That afternoon when Mom went into Allison’s room, I was home and heard it all from my bedroom next door. I waited for Allison on our front stoop, to warn her. When she came home from her job at the Hecht Company department store, she was struck and paralyzed by the news. She wanted to know all the details about how Mom went through her room and found everything. Taking a minute to gain her bearings, Allison courageously headed inside to face the music. Before Dad arrived from work that night, Allison had made a deal with Mom. She would not go to Woodstock and was grounded in exchange for Mom not telling Dad about her findings.\n\nWith Woodstock never to be for us, watching Woodstock the movie was the next best thing.\n\nEven though it had been cold and damp from weeks of rain, on our walk across campus to Allison’s dorm I am enthralled to be in a world I had never experienced before. Young people older than me, long hairs and many more straights, dart about on campus, bustling off to their classes and getting on with their lives. I see Kent State has a large faction of jocks and straights but my eyes are trained on the freaks populating the campus, and there are many. My imagination takes off as I pretend I’m older and one of them.\n\nArriving at Allison’s dormitory, I enter her accommodations and drop my bag. In her new digs there is a small sink in the corner and I feel like we are in a Vincent Van Gogh painting. A poster of Odilon Redon’s Evocation of Roussel decorates her walls along with peace posters. Academic books, esoteric studies such as the Tibetan Book of the Dead, candles and tokens of peace are stacked high on her bookcase.\n\nLater that evening Allison and I walk across the campus to hang out with Allison’s boyfriend Barry Levine at his dorm. Allison and Barry had fallen in love at Kent State that autumn and had become inseparable ever since. My parents and I had met with Barry several times and were very fond of his dry sense of humor, gentleness and how happy he made Allison. That first night, feeling all grown up hanging in the men’s dorm, I get high with my sister and Barry and feel part of it all. Even though I’m just 15 years old, I am grooving on the Kent State University campus as I play pool in my Landlubber bellbottom jeans and tie-dye t-shirt. Life is sweet!\n\nSaturday night the wait line for the Woodstock movie winds around the block and it’s a peaceful and happy crowd. Allison doesn’t mention until afterwards how earlier in Kent folks standing in line for Woodstock had been attacked by unruly people cruising by in cars, throwing stuff at those waiting, getting ticket holders wet and freaked out as they yelled “dirty hippies.”\n\nWoodstock does not disappoint. We’ve never experienced a movie like this before, and it’s not just because we’re high. This was a new kind of concert film that had just emerged as an artform, and it was out to the public in what seemed like minutes, too. Folks in the audience are standing up, dancing to the music and clapping along, and we join right in.\n\nWoodstock spoke directly to our generation, capturing the groove of our age. It crystalized the magnificence of what a time it was, a time of peace, love and understanding. The music captured that promising energy and carried us in hope and solidarity for the future. We needed it later in our struggle when the cultural and political repression began to gain momentum. But that night with Allison and Barry, it was all inspiration; I will never forget it.\n\nCelebrating Earth Day April 22, 1970\n\nWaking up on Sunday in Allison’s dorm room, the dread has already set in. My great weekend escape from my parents’ home into college life is coming to a close too quickly. As I pack my bag for the return to Pittsburgh, Allison says it’s fine for me to take her April 24th copy of the Daily Kent Stater college newspaper, so I stuff it into my bag.\n\nAround noon Mom and Dad arrive and our visit turns into a birthday celebration. On March 22nd I had turned 15 and last week, on April 23rd, it was Allison’s 19th birthday. We enjoy a loving birthday dinner together with the family and Barry at the Brown Derby, one of the best restaurants near Kent State.\n\nFor the Krauses this birthday dinner signified a rare moment of peace at the dinner table. Over the last few years, so many meals turned into a raging battlefield between Allison and Dad, especially over the Vietnam War and what Dad did for a living. Not so at our dinner together this night. Everyone is on their best behavior, desperately wishing to create loving memories of our family gathered together in peace.\n\nAllison and Barry share their news. Their studies at Kent State have been a disappointment. They don’t want to continue their courses there for another year and have made applications to transfer to S.U.N.Y. at Buffalo, not far away. To them Kent State is behind the times, stifling and too regimented. Both have been accepted to attend so Allison and Barry are planning their sophomore year at S.U.N.Y. in the fall of 1970. My parents’ reactions are positive. They are okay with Allison transferring because they don’t want her to drop out of college.\n\nAfter dinner we drive Allison and Barry back to campus and my weekend visit comes to a close. With my father at the wheel, we head back to Pittsburgh. It’s April 26, 1970 and it is the last time we see Allison alive.\n\nThat night back in my bedroom in the family home, I unpack my bag and settle in to read the Daily Kent Stater. On the cover is an amazing structure of a geodesic dome erected on the Kent State University Commons days earlier, for the first Earth Day. The article says it was built in homage to Buckminster Fuller, an American architect, designer, inventor and visionary. Fuller is now remembered as a wildly popular counter-cultural figure because of his early embrace of environmentalism and egalitarian futurism, but at the time he was at the height of his public fame yet marked subversive by the authorities. The Ecosphere at Kent State is an initiative led by Kent State architecture students hoping to spend the night inside their newly constructed dome, a structure built on sacred geometry. I’m fascinated by Bucky’s prescience but note that the dome was nowhere to be found by the time I arrived on campus.\n\nAllison and I had separately honored the first Earth Day just days earlier on April 22, 1970 when young people around the world focused on protecting Gaia and developing strategies to heal our planet. Earth Day efforts were mostly ignored by those in authority wishing to maintain the status quo. They were wholly unsympathetic to these first activities in the environmental movement and coined the phrase “The environment is a dirty word.” Dirty indeed, especially with the Cuyahoga River on fire in Ohio and the first big oil spill in Santa Barbara taking place just months before.\n\nHeadlines were full of environmental disasters by the end of the 1960’s. The previous June the Cuyahoga River flowing south from Lake Erie caught on fire following decades of chemical and oil spills. Prior to this, millions of gallons of crude oil leaked from a blowout of an oil drilling platform off the Santa Barbara coast. Extinction threats were drawing public attention, including the bald eagle, the national symbol of the U.S.A., and of course the whales. In response to this devastation, former Wisconsin governor and senator Gaylord Nelson founded and inspired the first Earth Day in 1970 which galvanized over 2,000 universities and 20 million Americans across the country, as well as participants around the world. Kent State was one of the universities taking part.\n\nAllison’s first Earth Day on her Kent State campus was far more eventful than mine. Even in Pittsburgh, my suburban junior high school had a mini teach-in but I opted to join adults and college students at a city-wide Earth Day event. Nearly a 1,000 residents of Pittsburgh gathered on Flagstaff Hill in Oakland, adjoining the Carnegie Mellon University campus. It was a teach-in filled with inspiring speakers, festive music and folks with tables hawking their grassroots causes, all of us honoring the EARTH. I learned a lot about what I could do as an average young person to fight the problems of environmental degradation, and this was long before these issues permeated popular culture. We honored Gaia that day.\n\nOver the weekend Allison mentioned she had attempted to hear Ralph Nader, the keynote speaker at Kent State University on the first Earth Day. The Daily Kent Stater I am reading grabs my attention, “One of the first things Nader said when he stood at the podium in University Auditorium was: ‘Don’t you have a gymnasium here?’ He was addressing more than 1,500 students in a room that seats only a thousand. Those who could not fit in the auditorium waited in Wills Gym and listened to WKSU radio broadcast Nader’s remarks over the loud speaker. The whole evening smacked of poor planning and poor coordination. It was an embarrassment for the university and a cause for anger on the part of concerned students who wanted to hear the consumers’ crusader’s remarks in person… Police estimated that more than 4,000 persons who wanted to hear the speech by Ralph Nader in University Auditorium Wednesday night had to be turned away.” It was obvious that Kent State University wished to censor Nader and eclipse his impact.\n\nAs environmental activists raised their voices across America on that first Earth Day in 1970, the Nixon administration and leadership at universities like Kent State took detailed notes on the young people who were making change. Although we were oblivious at the time, there is not vast documentation about the unprecedented level of surveillance of students ramping up in this period. Those in charge had also been busy infiltrating counter-cultural organizations to gather intelligence, spy on and harass those who dared to care about the environment. The CIA was driving much of this in their CHAOS program directed against young people and those who stood against war and for the environment, two issues often linked at the time. There was a burgeoning movement to confront corporations that polluted the Earth and the powers that be were not going to stand by and watch. Surveillance was the precursor to repression as environmental protests eventually led to demands for corporate accountability. Our actions were deeply threatening and in response the suppression of protest was nefarious and palpable.\n\nAdditionally, a seismic political event was taking place. Nixon had established the draft lottery, the first policy for compulsory service since WWII, essentially trapping young people to fight in the Vietnam War. This Daily Kent Stater reported Nixon’s announcement to end the deferments that had exempted those attending college, married students and workers – all categories that until this point provided ways to avoid the draft. This unwanted news reverberated across U.S. campuses, including Kent State.\n\nBack then peaceful U.S. college students were trying to take every avenue to get out of serving in Vietnam, while President Nixon was finding every way he could to limit their ability to defer their service. The Daily Kent Stater reported: “The White House explained in a fact sheet accompanying the President’s message to Congress that as of Thursday, [April 23rd and Allison’s birthday] students already attending college, or junior or community college, or an approved technical school, continue to be eligible for student deferment. Those planning to enroll in the future, however, will not be eligible for student deferment.”\n\nReading my newspaper from the weekend visit with Allison, I savor the memories of our bittersweet slice of life together on campus that April weekend. At this point I have no idea what is in store for Allison and my family, or how what is about to happen will affect us for the rest of our lives.\n\n—\n\nREAD MORE EXCERPTS to understand our view of what happened to Allison Krause in the May 4, 1970 Kent State massacre:\n\nMay 1, 1970 with Allison Krause at Kent State University https://bit.ly/3ViLlBm\n\nMay 2, 1970 with Allison Krause at Kent State University https://bit.ly/3Hy3vcv\n\nMay 3, 1970 with Allison Krause at Kent State University https://bit.ly/3Vv3oUN\n\nMay 4, 1970 with Allison Krause at Kent State University https://bit.ly/3ARaFoJ\n\nIn the summer of 2021, with help from writing coach Karmen Ross, I recorded stories of my life related to the Kent State massacre. These chapters document growing up with Allison and our family’s views related to Allison’s slaughter at 19 years old in the May 4, 1970 Kent State massacre. – Laurel Krause\n\nOver the years from her friends’ accounts, I learned what Allison was doing on that Sunday before she died. But no one tells it better than Barry Levine, Allison’s boyfriend who was with her that day.\n\n“Sunday was a peaceful day, the sun was warm and the breeze gentle. Allison spent the day quietly strolling the campus, sometimes laughing and joking, sometimes seriously discussing the past two days of disturbances on the campus. It was late afternoon when we decided to walk to the front campus and fraternize with some guardsmen.\n\n“Upon arriving, one particular guardsman caught our eye, he stood quietly alone, a flower in his gun barrel. Taking me by my arm, Allison walked over to him. His name was Meyers, and unlike many of the soldiers we had met that day, Meyers wore a pleasant smile, and when he spoke, he did so with a gentle compassion. He said he did not want to be guarding the campus, but when asked why he didn’t leave, he looked at the ground and shyly said he couldn’t.\n\n“Disturbed at the pleasant rapport one of his men was enjoying with us, an officer slowly strolled over and placed his arm around Meyers’ shoulder. As we watched inquisitively, Meyers’ face tightened up, his back straightened and his smile completely disappeared. The officer, yelling in Meyers’ ear, ordered him to identify himself and his division. Meyers did so, and as we watched the fear swell in the young guardsman’s eyes, the officer began –\n\nO: Doesn’t your division have target practice next week, Meyers?\n\nM: Yes, sir.\n\nO: Are you going there with that silly flower?\n\nM: No, sir.\n\nO: Then what is it doing in your rifle barrel?\n\nM: It was a gift, sir.\n\nO: Do you always accept gifts Meyers?\n\nM: No, sir.\n\nO: Then why did you accept this one?\n\nM: No answer\n\nO: (Holding out his hand) What are you going to do with it Meyers?\n\nM: (Feebly begins to remove the flower.)\n\nO: That’s better Meyers, now straighten up and start acting like a soldier and forget all this peace stuff.\n\n“Realizing the officer would merely throw the flower away, Allison grabbed it from his hand and gave him a look of disgust, but he only turned his back. As the officer walked away, Allison called after him, ‘What’s the matter with peace? Flowers are better than bullets!’”\n\nEarlier that Sunday Governor Rhodes held his infamous press conference at the Kent fire station, setting a belligerent tone intended to generate disdain toward protesters on campus. Rhodes had been in a tight race running for the Senate with the primary just days away so he calculated his best shot was to show he supported law and order, and was willing to stand with Nixon against the student protesters. Kent State students would pay the price.\n\nGovernor Rhodes’ speech that day:\n\n“We’ve seen here at the city of Kent especially, probably the most vicious form of campus-oriented violence yet perpetrated by dissident groups… they make definite plans of burning, destroying, and throwing rocks at police and at the National Guard and the Highway Patrol. …this is when we’re going to use every part of the law enforcement agency of Ohio to drive them out of Kent. We are going to eradicate the problem. We’re not going to treat the symptoms. …and these people just move from one campus to the other and terrorize the community. They’re worse than the brown shirts and the communist element and also the night riders and the vigilantes. They’re the worst type of people that we harbor in America. Now I want to say this. They are not going to take over [the] campus. I think that we’re up against the strongest, well-trained, militant, revolutionary group that has ever assembled in America.”\n\nBy Sunday there is a large, imposing and angry military presence on campus and in town. Helicopters circle overhead, townspeople deputized as proxy police harass students, and state troopers and the Ohio National Guard deploy in large numbers.\n\nKent State University does nothing to inform the students of what is taking place and University President Robert I. White is out of town, offering no leadership. It seems that Kent State University has handed over control to the National Guard and other military forces and has gone belly up in a quickly escalating situation.\n\nThe guardsmen had just come from a protracted wildcat strike with the Akron Teamsters over long hours and the story was promulgated that the guardsmen were exhausted and agitated. We later learn that since the strike ended days before President Nixon’s Cambodia speech, troops of guardsmen were sequestered in neighboring school yards not far from Kent State, bivouacking over a number of nights.\n\nThe son of a high-ranking guardsman explained to me years later that in the midst of the Akron wildcat strike, the Ohio National Guardsmen had been “federalized” and placed under the command of President Nixon. In order to maintain the guardsmen in their federalized role, senior command was required to keep this entire Ohio National Guard troop on duty. They are kept active near and around Kent.\n\nThe events on the night of May 3rd begin with a rally at President White’s home on campus. Within minutes the mayor announces a curfew, followed by Governor Rhodes declaring martial law and creating the pretense for mass arrests. Many students later describe the next few hours as an invasion of their campus, with a feeling that the war had come home. A deep anxiety sets over the university and surrounding communities. The helicopters beat overhead with their searchlights scanning and tank-like people carriers rolling onto campus. There are thousands of guardsmen and state police. The military presence completely overwhelms the number of students. Those returning to campus from the weekend away arrive home to a military-occupied war zone.\n\nMany living in town are blocked from getting home. There are guns everywhere, the National Guard are armed with M1’s that had been used to fight in the Korean War. Some of the guardsmen had actually fought in Korea and were not just the young Ohio National Guard described in the newspapers.\n\nThe guardsmen were a mixed group but it is important to note that it was only in 2021 when a few guardsmen finally came forward to tell their truth about what happened at Kent State. ONG Captain Ron Snyder shared his Kent State story more than 50 years later and his self-justifying views had not changed, “It was a riot; we had to contain the enemy.” Remarkably, Snyder still works as a security guard at Kent State University, a lifetime of employment rewarded for his suppression of students in 1970.\n\nThere were also guardsmen who were the same age as the students. Some worked other jobs in town, and many grew up and were friends with students. The guardsman named Meyers involving Allison and the flower attended college at nearby University of Akron. Many guardsmen enlisted as a way to get out of the draft, their own version of draft dodging. Certainly a critical mass of them did not want to be there. Others were scared. But there was not a uniform response among them, and many were aggressive and resentful throughout the weekend’s events. The state police were another matter; they genuinely despised the students and were described as nasty. Additionally, there were the undercovers and participants from COINTELPRO, the armed, covert division of the FBI and CIA operating in domestically. COINTELPRO had a well-documented central role in opposing the civil rights movement, most prominently in its suppression of the Black Panthers. Governor Rhodes’ brown shirt speech was part of this orchestrated campaign and threw a flame into the tinder box at just the “right” time. He deliberately echoed Nixon’s own incendiary words that the students were “bums” to stoke this fire.\n\nMass arrests take place that night, with accompanying police abuse. Sixty-eight people are penned in the local jail in crowded cells already filled with mentally unstable prisoners. A number of students are stabbed with police bayonets, and not provided medical care. Others are brutalized by police for simply attempting to enter their homes. Word trickles out about the violence on campus and parents begin to frantically call their children; local people hide away in their homes. Students are terrified as angry guardsmen with bayonets chase after them in the night.\n\nRumors circulate that KSU President Robert White will be addressing the school that night, so the students peacefully assemble at his house on campus. Anxious to hear from President White they wait and wait, but White refuses to meet with them. The Ohio National Guard stand ready to use tear gas against the crowd should it get unruly.\n\nWith White’s refusal to meet the students, they move their demands into the street in front of the president’s home, peacefully sitting down in a main intersection between the campus and town. The authorities do nothing to diffuse the tension in any way and merely escalate the blunt force of the military presence.\n\nThe military forces then engage. Two Sikorsky helicopters fly low above the students gathered in front of White’s house, buzzing them with search lights sweeping over the dark campus. On the ground national guardsmen carrying M1’s with fixed bayonets herd students from President White’s home all the way across campus to Tri Towers dormitory, a long distance away. Students are pushed the whole way by menacing guardsmen muttering violent, deadly threats. Panic mounts. They injure several students with bayonets in the process. The horror of it all sets in. The war has indeed come home.\n\nThe students arrive at the Tri Towers dormitory desperate to enter and get away from the guardsmen, and Allison is among them. The doors and windows to the dormitory are all locked. It seems no one can get to safety away from the guardsmen with their bayonets coming up from behind.\n\nLance Kinz is a fellow student and acquaintance of Allison’s; he shares what he sees that night.\n\n“The guardsmen were getting closer and closer. And there were helicopters and it was very, you know, frightening for people and surreal and I remember going to the dormitory and the doors were locked, and there was a group of people, and, the RA whatever they’re called wouldn’t let this group come in. Even though a number of us lived in the dormitory, and the guardsmen were closing in close and the helicopters were above and only I was standing coincidentally next to Allison, and, only because she broke down. She was so frightened. She was screaming and crying that we were going to get hurt, that they were going to hurt us. And she pleaded and she was so upset. And only because of her pleas that this guy eventually – just opened it – opened the door and we just rushed in with the guardsmen right behind us. And then we were safe. And it was only because of her being so frightened and speaking up.”\n\nAllison gets in but Barry does not. She cries and screams because Barry has been left outside the locked doors with the guard quickly approaching. Almost out of control, she yells for them to open the doors to let him in. The resident assistant acquiesces and Barry makes it in with others, escaping injury from the guardsmen.\n\nThat night dormitory RA’s tell the students to stay away from the windows and keep their drapes closed. Students remove mattresses from their beds and place them against windows for safety from rifle fire. They come together to sleep in numbers. RA’s command: don’t move around, stay in your room. Stay down.\n\nAllison sleeps that night in a friend’s room in Tri Towers. It is her last night.\n\n—\n\nREAD MORE EXCERPTS to understand our view of what happened to Allison Krause in the May 4, 1970 Kent State massacre:\n\nMay 4, 1970 with Allison Krause at Kent State University https://bit.ly/3ARaFoJ\n\nIn the summer of 2021, with help from writing coach Karmen Ross, I recorded stories of my life related to the Kent State massacre. These chapters document growing up with Allison and our family’s views related to Allison’s slaughter at 19 years old in the May 4, 1970 Kent State massacre. – Laurel Krause\n\nThe next morning on Saturday, May 2nd my parents have a long, serious discussion with Allison over the phone. Dad speaks to her, with Mom offering her input on a phone extension. They are blowing their stacks. Dad wants to know about Allison’s involvement in last night’s mayhem in downtown Kent. Allison tells my parents she wasn’t involved at all, that she’s not a drinker and hadn’t gone to the bars. She promises to stay on campus and out of trouble.\n\nDad’s concern for Allison as an anti-war protester accelerated when she started college at Kent State. On TV he saw reports of mounting violence against peaceful protest, particularly in D.C.; he knew Allison was demonstrating and didn’t want her hurt. In October and November 1969, resistance to Nixon’s Vietnam war swelled. Dad worried as he watched Nixon taunt college students, including his daughter, knowing it would lead to trouble. He didn’t want her protesting and told her so.\n\nAllison would not be commanded by my father. She felt it was her place to resist the war, along with her friends, as part of the generation being forced to fight in Vietnam, and now Cambodia. Allison’s integrity was everything to her and she lived out her commitment to peace and to the principles of freedom and sovereignty that she believed ought to define our country, and the world. The “hippies” were so maligned during this period but what I know from up close is that Allison truly believed in love – love animated through action, the underlying theme of the 1960’s. She loved life and loved people and she was going to be part of the generation that broke the legacy of war and death we were seeing all around us. And I believe she did this in her own way, and paid a huge price. My sister was valiant and fierce, and above all dedicated to non-violence. Allison stood for peace.\n\nDad began to see how on TV the demonization of protesters was helping to suppress young people’s freedom of expression, and how this might go on to endanger Allison at Kent State. He saw how the “dirty” and “dangerous” hippie was a trope fervently promoted by Nixon’s administration to make the anti-war protesters appear to be a fringe group of violent lunatics and communists. This coordinated suppression of peaceful Baby Boomers would later become part of public policy and the basis of criminal prosecutions, Kent State included.\n\nIn the days leading to these events, President Nixon, Vice President Spiro Agnew and even California governor Ronald Reagan spoke out publicly against young people, demonizing them and their protest movement. Often serving as unaccountable mouthpieces, the media perpetuated these distortions, mainlining their messages to middle America and bolstering the war in Vietnam.\n\nAt the time of the Moratorium, President Richard Nixon said, “Now, I understand that there has been, and continues to be, opposition to the war in Vietnam on the campuses and also in the nation. As far as this kind of activity is concerned, we expect it; however, under no circumstances will I be affected whatever by it.” Outrageously, Nixon left no doubt that he would refuse to change course in the face of this groundswell of anti-war protest.\n\nIn the fall of 1969 Allison collected money to support anti-war efforts and marched for peace on the Kent State campus. November 1969 brought the historic March on Washington, including the March on Death, as the Moratoriums to End the Vietnam War gained momentum.\n\nAllison traveled by bus from Ohio to D.C. to participate in the Moratorium with her friends. The atmosphere was electric and would go down in the history books as the largest American citizen assembly to date. Hundreds of thousands of protesters arrived in D.C. for the March on Death and half a million assembled for the November 15, 1969 Moratorium Day, taking their demands to the White House. At the National Mall, Allison connected with her high school Maryland friends and heard speeches from Dr. Benjamin Spock, Dick Gregory, David T. Dellinger, Mrs. Coretta Scott King, Dr. Timothy Leary, Leonard Bernstein, Senators George Mc Govern, Charles Goodell and Eugene McCarthy, Abbie Hoffman and Jerry C. Ruben. Music enlivened the crowds as they were uplifted by Peter, Paul and Mary, Arlo Guthrie and Pete Seeger. Seeger led everyone in a 10-minute rendition of John Lennon’s “Give Peace a Chance” and then directly called on President Nixon to end the Vietnam war. It was a heady and hopeful time.\n\nD.C. Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam, November 15, 1969\n\nOn this first weekend in May 1970, now half a year after the Moratoriums and with nothing but military escalation to show for the anti-war efforts, there is widespread outrage among the American public. However, on Saturday The New York Times propagates a story about Nixon’s April 30th Cambodia speech being well-received, saying Americans were “positive” in response, in a ratio of six to one. They cover Nixon saying, “President Nixon referred today to some campus radicals who violently oppose his Vietnam policies as ‘bums’ and, in contrast, he said American soldiers were ‘the greatest’.” Nixon went out of his way to smear anti-war protesters, among them my sister.\n\nIn our phone call that Saturday, Dad reminds Allison how she defied him in November by going to the March on Washington against his wishes. Allison retorts, “Yes, and I didn’t get arrested or in any trouble either.” She promises she’ll be careful, adding how she’s not a radical and hadn’t even joined Students for a Democratic Society, a campus group that opposed the Vietnam War. As she ends her chat with my parents, Allison repeats that she won’t be going to town and that she’d protect herself.\n\nAt the end of the call I speak with Allison, squeezing in a moment to chat, encouraging her to stay safe. I’m worried for her, wishing I could somehow be close to her on campus again. She tells me, “I’m going to be okay.” I never speak to her again.\n\nEver since the bar closings on Friday night, students detect a mounting Ohio National Guard presence outside the campus gates. This is extremely unsettling as in the past, the National Guard, usually under command of the governor, have only been brought in for extreme situations. Now guardsmen are coming in numbers to bivouack in public school yards in the areas surrounding Kent.\n\nExercising their constitutional right to assemble, Kent State students gather before dusk on Saturday for a protest at the ROTC building. The ROTC is targeted in order to object to the Reserved Officers Training Corps programs that were a pipeline to the Vietnam war, and also to expose Kent State’s research into military-grade liquid crystals for combat weaponry. The burning of ROTC buildings had become a recurring theme at universities across America as the draft escalated and the response to the war became more desperate. Kent State’s decrepit wooden structure is already slated for demolition, thus of limited value, but it is chosen for its symbolism.\n\nA small group of less than 100 students gather near the ROTC building, an old, stand-alone structure, and attempt to set it alight. The building does not catch fire easily as it had been raining for weeks prior. After several attempts to get it going, the structure finally ignites. From sources present at the fire, I was told that there were again unfamiliar faces in the crowd. The hippies were by no means a majority on campus and they tended to run in the same circles, so they knew each other well. Many students came to believe that informants wearing hippie clothes and longhair wigs were present among them at the ROTC that night and may have been the force behind the final ignition. There is now a well-established record of the extent of government infiltration and surveillance during the Vietnam era, and the involvement of plants during the ROTC incident would not have been unusual. FOIA documents, first-person testimonies, radio interviews and legal proceedings later established the extent of infiltration and surveillance deployed by the Nixon administration. We now know that the CIA CHAOS program was used against anti-war protesters at Kent State, as authorities claimed they needed to rout out campus radicals from other schools, who simply weren’t there. The CIA’s surveillance plots were not new to university leadership mostly because Kent State had been a CIA recruiting school since at least the 1950’s.\n\nWhether related to policing for drugs or anti-war monitoring, there had been mounting tension at Kent State over government agents suspected of walking among them. One student shared later that she heard law enforcement walkie-talkies near the ROTC building blast the message, “The fire isn’t going yet” to the Kent fire brigade. Much later the flames burn a curtain through a broken window and the fire takes off after a series of failed attempts.\n\nThe Kent State ROTC building burns down. Whether it is the students or undercovers who set it afire we will probably never know, but we do know the fire fighters, the Ohio National Guard and the state troopers who arrived on campus once the fire got going made sure no one put it out quickly. The authorities were completely hands off in addressing the flames.\n\nThe Ohio National Guard watch and wait for the ROTC building to be engulfed. When it comes time to put out the fire, the firemen “discover” their thick fire hoses have been cut by fire axes “made available” at the fire truck and, notably, a machete – an uncommon tool in Ohio. Questions abound: who cut the fire hoses and where did a machete come from?\n\nWord of the Kent State ROTC fire spreads quickly around town and then across the nation. In newspaper headlines overnight, Kent State protesters become violent, out-of-control campus radicals and troublemakers with no redeeming qualities. The press play right into the hands of the government and there is very little dispassionate reporting.\n\nAfter the ROTC burns down, the atmosphere on campus becomes more militarized. Despite this, the students maintain a determined calm and the next day starts off peacefully.\n\n—\n\nREAD MORE EXCERPTS to understand our view of what happened to Allison Krause in the May 4, 1970 Kent State massacre:\n\nMay 3, 1970 with Allison Krause at Kent State University https://bit.ly/3Vv3oUN\n\nMay 4, 1970 with Allison Krause at Kent State University https://bit.ly/3ARaFoJ\n\n— A quote from Stephanie Danes Smith, career officer of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), named by KSU President Beverly Warren to chair the Kent Massacre 50th anniversary Commemoration Advisory Committee for May 4, 2020\n\nBy Mike Alewitz, May 21, 2019\n\nFull disclosure: I was a student antiwar and socialist protester who witnessed the bloodshed of May 4, 1970, when friends and fellow activists were gunned down by Ohio National Guardsmen at Kent State University.\n\nThe appointment of a former CIA kingpin, Stephanie Danes Smith, is an affront to the memory of the martyrs of the Kent and Jackson State Massacres and the millions of people that protested the war in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to a KSU press release, Danes Smith, now an associate professor in Kent’s School of Journalism and Mass Communication, “will be a leader in creating, planning and executing all commemoration events, as well as overseeing plans and work with the May 4th Task Force, May 4 families and survivors and Kent State students, staff and faculty.”\n\nDanes Smith has been tasked to “work with the President’s Office and other groups to execute national and global May 4 projects for the commemoration.”\n\nWHO IS CIA OPERATIVE STEPHANIE SMITH?\n\nStephanie Danes Smith was a high-level supervisor of the CIA who retired in 2011, after 25 years of loyal service to the agency.\n\nAccording to the university, “As a Senior Intelligence Service executive in the CIA, Danes Smith led thousands of employees; designed and managed programs worth several billion dollars; interacted regularly with Congress; and traveled extensively, including throughout two war zones (Afghanistan and Iraq). She was selected as a member of CIA’s Senior Intelligence Service in 2000 and achieved its highest rank.”\n\nDanes Smith served as Executive Director for Administration at the National Security Council under National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice.\n\nIn 2003 she was a part of the leadership team when Rice, Vice President Dick Cheney and Attorney General John Ashcroft planned out and implemented the use of waterboarding, sleep deprivation, forced nudity, sexual assault and other methods of torture used extensively against innocent civilians in Iraq and other locations.\n\nAfter assisting Rice, Danes Smith was suddenly elevated to Director of the CIA Directorate of Support, the largest section of the CIA, under Executive Director Kyle “Dusty” Foggo.\n\n“I was promoted at a speed that astounded even me…in the process, I came to live by a standard, ‘Get there first and clean up your road kill later,’ Danes Smith said. “If you had observed me during a typical work day, you would never have been able to tell I was a Christian woman,” she added.\n\nIn 2008, Dusty Foggo was indicted for illegally steering millions of dollars in CIA contracts to a friend. In the course the investigation, it turns out that he had his mistress (alleged to be Danes Smith) hired to a $100,000 a year job, which explains Danes Smith’s sudden good fortune. She avoided prison by turning state’s evidence against Foggo, after he dumped her for another mistress.\n\nDanes Smith seems remarkably lucky at landing plum jobs – including a professorship at Kent, without having the usually required PhD.\n\nAfter Foggo was cleared out, Danes Smith ended up at the Counterterrorism Communications Center where she reported to Undersecretary Karen Hughes who “was responsible for trying to polish the image of the US overseas in the wake of the Iraq war and the damaging Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal.”\n\nAnd Amy Reynolds, dean of the College of Communication and Information, has the temerity to describe Danes Smith as someone who “cares deeply about what May 4 means to Kent State, to history, to the First Amendment, to activism, to civil discourse, to our students and to the future.”\n\nDanes Smith’s job was cleaning up after the torturers. Out of all the faculty, staff and students that have shown themselves to value human life, this is the person that outgoing President Beverly Warren and incoming President Todd A. Diacon chose to head the commemoration honoring those that fell fighting for peace.\n\nThere is nothing accidental about the appointment – it is a message to all that Kent State University is going to spend a year sanitizing the events of May 4, 1970.\n\nWHAT IS THE CIA?\n\nIf doing public relations for torturers doesn’t creep you out, it’s worth reviewing what the CIA really does – not the fictional TV version where the good guys capture evil terrorists, but the real story of billions of our tax dollars going to fund death squads, fundamentalist militias and militarist thugs. Stephanie Smith decided to spend her career glorifying them.\n\nIn all the world, few organizations are as feared and hated as the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Its sole purpose is to protect global profits for the US ruling class – it is unmatched as a ruthless, terrorist organization.\n\nThe CIA has not only been directly responsible for the torture and death of untold thousands of innocent people, it trains and installs the most sadistic henchmen of the world’s bloodiest dictators.\n\nThe CIA’s grisly history includes the overthrow of democratically elected governments in places like Iran, Guatemala, Indonesia and the Congo – and the installation and buttressing of the world’s most brutal torture states.\n\nToday, as US warships steam towards Iran, it useful to consider Operation Ajax. This was a US organized coup that replaced the democratically-elected leader of Iran, Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh, because of his plans to nationalize the oil industry. Mossadegh was replaced with the Shah, ushering in decades of mass torture. Covert operations and inhuman sanctions continue to this day.\n\nThe CIA orchestrated direct military assaults in numerous countries, including the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba. During the Vietnam War, the CIA initiated Operation Phoenix, a program that targeted thousands of Vietnamese civilians for assassination, rape, kidnapping and torture.\n\nThe CIA has targeted numerous popular leaders for extralegal assassination, including Fidel Castro, Rafael Trujillo and Patrice Lumumba.\n\nIn Central America, the CIA was involved in cocaine trafficking to benefit the right-wing terrorist Contras in Nicaragua and promoted fascist Death Squads in El Salvador and Honduras.\n\nCongressional hearings in 1976, revealed that the CIA had been bribing journalists and editors for years.\n\nAs we can see by the numerous coups being orchestrated right now in Venezuela, the dirty tricks of the CIA have never stopped – they went on under Smith’s tenure and they are going on now.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED AT KENT\n\nOn May 4, 1970, forty-nine years ago, at Kent State University, National Guardsmen fired a barrage of 67 bullets – killing four students and wounding nine more.\n\nIn some ways, the atmosphere leading up to the bloodshed is similar to today – with an isolated and increasingly unhinged President engaged in undermining the press and lying to the public.\n\nOn April 30th of that year, President Richard Nixon announced the invasion of Cambodia – a major escalation of the war in Southeast Asia. His action sparked widespread outrage. At Kent State, a series of protests, rallies and events took place, including the torching of the ROTC building, a dilapidated wooden structure scheduled for demolition, under suspicious circumstances.\n\nUsing that event as a pretext, Governor James Rhodes ordered the Ohio National Guard to occupy the campus. Over the next two days, students were chased, bayoneted and clubbed by guardsmen, tear gas inundated the campus and helicopters with searchlights hovered overhead at night.\n\nNixon branded the student protesters as “bums.” Rhodes called them “worse than the brown shirts…we will use whatever force necessary to drive them out of Kent!” These inflammatory remarks laid the groundwork for repression.\n\nOn May 4, we gathered to protest the war and the military occupation of our university. Guardsmen, armed with live ammunition and firing tear-gas canisters, advanced on the peaceful group. We ran away, but the Guard continued the barrage.\n\nOur gathering was dispersed, and the soldiers began to march away. Suddenly, without provocation, a group of Guardsmen spun around and fired their weapons.\n\nWe looked about in disbelief – the victims were unarmed and nowhere near the troops. Allison Krause, who had proudly marched in previous demonstrations, was 330 feet away from the nearest Guardsman, when she was fatally gunned down. A friend, Sandy Scheuer, was 390 feet away, walking to class. She was shot through the neck and killed. Another friend, Robbie Stamps, was almost 500 feet away when wounded.\n\nFour young people lay dead: Allison Krause, Bill Schroeder, Sandy Scheuer and Jeffrey Miller. Among the nine wounded, Dean Kahler was paralyzed for life.\n\nThe killings at Kent were followed ten days later with a police barrage of bullets into a dormitory at Jackson State in Mississippi. James Earl Green and Phillip Lafayette Gibbs were gunned down and an unknown number of others were wounded. The African-American victims at Jackson did not receive the same attention as Kent.\n\nGOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT\n\nTo this day, the extent of government involvement in the massacre has never been fully explored. Among the many photos of May 4 are those of a paid FBI informant, Terry Norman, holding a pistol – he is in the crowd. His presence has never been fully explained – the truth of the massacre at Kent remains hidden in the fog of war.\n\nFor 49 years the truth has been covered up by the KSU administration, the state and federal governments. This has been a bipartisan effort including both Democratic and Republican politicians at the highest levels of government.\n\nThe ROTC building was burned under mysterious circumstances. An armed FBI informant was present. As was later revealed, the FBI was conducting massive and widespread disruption of the anti-war movement through its COINTELPRO program. We know that Lyndon B. Johnson authorized the CIA to undertake its own program of spying on US citizens – Operation Chaos.\n\nThe failure to seriously investigate these circumstances constitutes a cover up. We can and should demand an impartial investigation into these events – it’s never too late. We may never know all, but the struggle to find the truth will serve to educate and act as a brake for similar repression.\n\nThe warmakers and their academic-administrative toadies fear the truth. They want to continue the coverup of the killings at Kent and Jackson. They want to rewrite the history of US atrocities in Vietnam and around the world – so they may continue to advance their own economic policies of global plunder.\n\nThey require the ongoing massacre of the truth.\n\nTHE DEBATE AT KENT\n\nAlthough the press has not yet covered it, there are plenty of people outraged about the appointment of Stephanie Smith. This is not just about the individual – it is about what she represents.\n\nNot only have the events of one day, May 4, been covered up – the larger history of Kent has been re-written as well. The mass anti-war movement, which mobilized thousands of KSU students, along with millions more across the country, has been largely removed from the commemoration programs, exhibits, books and articles.\n\nThe demands of our movement: Bring the troops home now! War machine off campus! Free all political prisoners! Money for jobs and education, not war! These and other slogans that expressed our aspirations have been disappeared.\n\nThe history of militant student anti-war protest has been airbrushed away. The murders have become a “tragic event” devoid of political content. The commemoration is not about honoring the martyrs that fought against imperialist slaughter – instead it is about looking inward, learning to communicate and having prayers to prevent such unfortunate events in the future.\n\n“Don’t Mourn – Organize”has become “Mourn – Don’t Organize.”\n\nThe attempts to suppress and coopt history are hardly unexpected. In capitalist America, colleges and universities are tied to the government through webs of personnel, research, funding, etc. The idea that the KSU administration is an agent of change is wishful thinking.\n\nMAY 4 TASK FORCE\n\nFor many years, the May 4 Task Force (M4TF), a student group, organized the yearly commemorations – at times waging important struggles to preserve the memory of the massacre, such as opposing the building of a gymnasium over the shooting site. They did much to educate the student body and keep the memory of May 4 alive.\n\nHowever, M4TF largely excluded representatives from the mass anti-war organizations – the Student Mobilization Committee Against the War (SMC) was the country’s largest antiwar group and constituted the left wing of the movement – demanding immediate and complete withdrawal of all US forces from Southeast Asia.\n\nThe Cleveland Area Peace Action Coalition (CAPAC), the National Peace Action Coalition (NPAC), the New Mobilization Coalition (MOBE) were the central organizations that organized the mass demonstrations and reached out to the working class in trade unions, in the oppressed nationalities and into the armed forces.\n\nThese coalitions, that organized millions of people into anti-imperialist actions, were marginalized and excluded from May 4 events and history.\n\nFantasy histories were invented to fit the needs of a corporate education. One was that Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and a small group of radicals heroically led a rebellion against the war. It’s true that SDS was a group of radical-minded activists with many dedicated individuals. It called the first march on Washington against the war in 1964 – an important action that broke with the generally pacifist anti-war movement by naming a specific imperialist war.\n\nBut 1964 was the last time that SDS, as a national organization, supported a unified national demonstration – opting instead for small-group civil disobedience and individual acts of resistance.\n\nDespite its national abstention, at Kent there were many SDSers that, as individuals, played an invaluable role in educating and mobilizing for mass demonstrations like the 1969 Moratoriums that resulted in thousands of KSU students participating in marches and rallies.\n\nBut by creating this mythological history, it removes the participation of thousands of Kent students from antiwar actions. It attempts to make us observers, instead of participants.\n\nBefore the shootings on May 4, thousands of KSU marched in anti-war and civil liberties demonstrations. They, and millions like them, changed the course of history.\n\nTHE DEMOCRATIC PARTY\n\nThe leading figure in the M4TF over the past decades is Alan Canfora, who was shot in the wrist on May 4. He was famously seen waving a black flag at the Guardsmen. Canfora deserves credit for his many years of work on behalf of the M4TF, the families and victims of the shooting.\n\nCanfora is a longtime Democratic Party official in Barberton, Ohio – a Clinton supporter in the center-right of the party. Regarding the development of a left wing in the party, he states his views forthrightly on his Facebook page:\n\n“Putin and his bitches: Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump and Jill Stein. All hail Putin, mastermind of world politics, now it’s clear he owns Bernie, The Donald and Jill.”\n\nThrough longevity and consistent self-promotion, Canfora established himself as the leading voice of M4TF, along with his sister Roseann “Chic” Canfora, an adjunct professor and colleague of Stephanie Smith in the School of Journalism, as well as a small coterie of liberal supporters of Democratic Party candidates.\n\nMore than anything, this grouping is insistent that any questioning about possible covert governmental involvement in the massacre be dismissed as conspiratorialist – because it raises the responsibility of the Democratic Party in the decades-long cover-up.\n\nNone of this has ever mattered much until now. I believe they are making a profound mistake by aligning themselves with the CIA and KSU administration.\n\nThe M4TF, which previously had a symbiotic relationship with KSU, has now relinquished complete control of the commemoration and handed it over to the administration. For their part, the administration is attempting to co-opt a handful of M4TF activists – rewarding them with invitations to dine with President Beverly Warren and the trustees, attend meetings, be part of a corporate speaker’s bureau and get some public attaboys.\n\nIt was after taking control of the commemoration, and with key M4TF leaders on board, Warren promptly named CIA agent Danes Smith to head up the commemoration.\n\nKSU is attempting to promote itself as a leading research institution – the appointment of Smith is a message to corporate, military and government officials that KSU is open for business and will not be bothered by pesky remembrances of the antiwar movement.\n\nSTONEWALLING AND EXCUSES\n\nTo date, KSU administrators have not responded to demands that Smith be dumped – leaving defense of the CIA to the Democratic Party clique. Despite very fundamental political disagreements, it saddens me to see some of these activists left holding the bag to defend the CIA, no small task. So far, the justifications of those that defend the CIA operative are these:\n\nJustification: You don’t know her, I do, and she is a good person.\n\nNot all CIA officials are right-wing ideologues. The CIA has often adopted a mantle of progressive politics, even expressing a wish to help groups – that is how they infiltrate unions, student groups and other left organizations. For example, this was how liberal feminist icon Gloria Steinem was recruited to spy on radical activists in Europe.\n\nThere are CIA snoops that are nice, personable and funny – just as there are generals, arms dealers and warmakers that seem nice, personable and funny. Henry Kissinger was considered a charmer in the 70s – he dated Hollywood starlets.\n\nJustification: You are not from Kent or have not been involved in the May 4 Task Force, so your opinion doesn’t matter.\n\nAfter the shootings in 1970, you could already see a cottage industry beginning to grow up around the massacre. There was the emergence of Kent “experts,” most of whom had been marginally involved in the antiwar movement, if at all.\n\nKnowledge of the on-the-ground May 4 events is important, but the broader context of the war and the antiwar movement is critical. Pandering to “experts” and baiting movement activists that have moved on with their lives and do not relate directly to the campus is counter-productive.\n\nTo their credit, and as recently documented in Tom Grace’s book about the Kent Massacre, many activists of the time became active in the emerging social movements of the 70s until today – working in solidarity with struggles in Central America, in the Iraq anti-war movement, in the feminist movement and a myriad of other social justice issues.\n\nMay 4 does not belong to any one group. The children in Cuba that named their school The Martyrs of Kent School are part of our movement. The people that participated in the Kent Truth Tribunal are part of it. The anti-war activists that sponsor Kent events around the country are part of it. The millions of people that protested the massacre over all these years are part of it.\n\nThe young person that got involved just yesterday is part of it – perhaps most importantly of all. The history of the working class and its allies belongs to the class as a whole.\n\nJustification: We’ve been part of the commemoration activities for a long time so you should trust us.\n\nThe history of the labor and other social movements has continually shown us that blind trust has no place in the movement or in the university. People change. Groups change. Regardless of past accomplishments, you should be judged by what you say and do now.\n\nJustification: I am a victim/survivor/family/witness, so I get to decide, and I like Stephanie Smith.\n\nNo, you are due consideration like everyone else.\n\nIn my travels as an agitprop muralist, I’ve seen the result of CIA initiated embargoes, sanctions, sabotage, dirty tricks and US military actions in places like Nicaragua, Cuba, Iraq and Palestine.\n\nHundreds of thousands of children and elderly have died for lack of medications because of economic sanctions. The mothers of Venezuela or Iran or a dozen other countries whose children suffer and die because of the CIA are also victims. The countless torture casualties in places like Nicaragua are victims. Would you tell them how nice the CIA lady is?\n\nThe martyrs of the anti-war and anti-racist movements deserve better than the grotesque mockery of a representative of the repressive apparatus officiating at the commemoration.\n\nThis will not go away. We would not be silenced in 1970 and we will not be silenced now.\n\nWhile it is unfortunate that some individuals have decided to align themselves with the KSU administration and the CIA, keep in mind that they are not responsible for the CIA recruitment on campus or the appointment of Danes Smith.\n\nIt is outgoing President Beverly Warren, incoming President Todd A. Diacon and the Board of Trustees that are responsible for this travesty and must be held to account.\n\nTHE 1970 NATIONAL STUDENT STRIKE\n\nThe KSU administration has purportedly earmarked $2m for an extensive, yearlong series of activities about May 4. It is unlikely that the festivities will honor the true legacy of the antiwar movement and how it transformed society.\n\nThe shootings at Kent sparked an unprecedented national student strike – hundreds of thousands of students stopped business as usual. At least 400 campuses were struck – many were occupied, and students began to form strike councils to take control of the universities.\n\nStudents began meeting, discussing, debating, creating and using their campuses as a base for organizing – reaching deep into the heart of the country with their anti-war message. We provided support to the thousands of active-duty anti-war GIs that became a key factor in ultimately compelling the US to withdraw from Southeast Asia.\n\nOn May 7, 1970, at a Washington, D. C. press conference, I gave a statement on behalf of the Kent Student Mobilization Committee (SMC), along with strike leaders from Berkeley, Wayne State, Case Western Reserve and Tufts. We called for it to be introduced and adopted in student strike councils across the nation. It read in part:\n\nWe call on the campus communities now in control of campus facilities to maintain that control and to preserve the broadest student-faculty unity in the face of all attempts to divide them.\n\nWe call on the campus communities that have not yet taken control of their campus facilities to do so and to join with their sisters and brothers across the country in utilizing the facilities to mobilize non-campus communities against the war.\n\nWe call on the united campus communities to reach out into all communities- into the neighborhoods, the labor unions, the Afro-American and other Third World organizations, the churches and synagogues, the women’s groups, the political associations, the military installations – and organize the new, united antiwar movement that will have the power to actually compel an end to the killing abroad as well as at home.\n\nThat proposal for mass actions and occupations stood in stark contrast to calls for individual resistance or toothless electoral activity. Instead, it advanced a national course of action to fundamentally challenge the power of the warmakers.\n\nWe were fighting for the empowerment of students and workers. That history is unlikely to be included in the 2020 May 4 events.\n\nTHE STRUGGLE AHEAD\n\nThe decade-long struggle over Vietnam proved that only a massive movement could end the war. Then, as now, peace did not come from a government that is without compassion or vision – wars and occupations cannot be ended by a timid and impotent legislature that continues to fund the war machine.\n\nToday, the “resistance” of Democratic Party officials is a toothless sound bite. The “progressive” candidates talk peace while voting to fund US military adventures abroad. They cover up their support to the war on workers abroad by giving lip service to some tepid reforms here at home.\n\nOver the next year, there will not only be numerous commemorative events about Kent. Millions of dollars were also allocated to the Pentagon by the Obama White House to commemorate the war in Vietnam. These millions will be utilized to obscure the truth about U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia and repression here at home.\n\nThe real history of the genocidal war will be suppressed. There will be little place for truth, or even facts. The unprecedented assault on Julian Assange should remind us how much the warmakers fear the truth.\n\nFifty years have passed, and the stakes facing working people are greater than at any time in human history. Today, along with rising nationalism and permanent war, we face nothing less than the extinction of our species in a carbon-based nightmare of climate change denial.\n\nAs in 1970, our hope for a more peaceful future lies with our own empowerment. Protests continue against US wars and occupations, environmental destruction, racism and sexism. Millions of immigrants have shed their invisibility in a great new movement for civil and human rights.\n\nOnly international solidarity can put an end to the insanity of corporate greed. Only working people can halt the warmakers, by organizing a massive movement to demand an end to the lies and an end to the bloodshed.\n\nThe way to honor the martyrs of Kent and Jackson is to end the cover up of the massacres and to continue the struggle for peace and social justice. The true memorial must be in the streets!\n\nEND ALL U.S. WARS AND OCCUPATIONS!\n\nHANDS OFF VENEZUELA AND IRAN!\n\nBRING ALL THE TROOPS HOME NOW!\n\nMONEY FOR EDUCATION, NOT WAR!\n\nWAR MACHINE OFF CAMPUS!\n\n– – – – – – – – – – – –\n\nMike Alewitz/ May 21, 2019\n\nMike Alewitz was the founder and Chairman of the Kent Student Mobilization Committee Against the War in Vietnam (SMC).

Smith from 2018\n\nMay 4, 2018, Kent, Ohio\n\nA speech for Allison Krause, one of the four students slaughtered at Kent State University on May 4, 1970, written and spoken by Idris Kabir Syed at the 48th commemoration\n\nThis year marks my 28th commemoration. I have spoken only once for a student, Jeffrey Miller. In my younger years as a student, I thought that Jeff was the one who I had the most in common with—like him, I considered myself a young revolutionary who deeply believed in activism and civil rights. I didn’t realize how much I have in common with Allison until this year.\n\nWhen Allison’s sister Laurel asked me to speak for her sister this year, I was honored and moved to tears. I realized immediately that she was entrusting me with something deeply important for her family. If there is one thing I have learned in my time working with the families of the victims of May 4th, it is that the trauma of that day lives on and has profoundly affected the families in myriads of ways, both negative and positive. My own family relationship with Kent State and May 4th (as both of my parents were on campus that fateful day) mirror this reality as well.\n\nMy relationship with the Krause family began when I was in high school. I worked for Allison’s cousin Marvin at Arabica coffee shop on Coventry in Cleveland Heights. I knew Marvin’s daughter, Allison’s cousin Jennifer and would run into her at Grateful Dead or Carlos Jones concerts and we had many mutual friends. When I went to Kent and got involved with the Task Force I met Doris, Allison’s mother, and was amazed at her grace. The first year that I met Laurel was for the 40th commemoration was not what I had hoped. It was my first year as faculty advisor when Laurel came to the last meeting of the Task Force before the 40th commemoration. In the parlance of today’s students, she was “aggro” and she let us know it. She demanded that the Task Force honor her family’s wishes and challenged us to not succumb to silencing their voices as she felt the University as a whole has done since 1970. I was stunned shocked into silence thinking we were trying to honor her and her family. I realized very quickly however, her concerns were completely valid, based in a historical relationship of trauma at Kent State University that is institutionalized here. It took me some time, but I discovered there was another, more appropriate term (which young people also use today) for Laurel, which is “woke.” Laurel is woke—woke in ways many of us don’t understand but need to recognize. I watched her tireless work with the Kent State Truth Tribunal, started by her and Emily Kunstler (daughter of the esteemed civil-rights attorney, William Kunstler) that year. That summer, I also watched countless video testimonies of people who had never quite felt comfortable sharing their story with the university, but opened themselves up to Laurel and Emily in ways that even surprised them. These stories are vital, and I hope that the University supports the efforts of the Truth Tribunal to continue to promote those stories being told. After the Obama/Holder/Perez refusal to re-open the Kent State case, Laurel then took the stories of her family and Truth Tribunal participants to the United Nations forcing the world stage to acknowledge America’s shame and murder. The Krause family is woke—whether Father Arthur, Mother Doris, Sister Laurel, or Cousin Jennifer—they were and are all woke in their own important ways. Today, I want to talk about how I think Allison was woke, and what we can still learn from her 48 years after her untimely murder.\n\nAllison was not at Kent in 1968; she was finishing her senior year of high school in Maryland. She was against the war in Vietnam but by no means a “radical or revolutionary.” I don’t know if she knew of the killings at Orangeburg, or much of what was happening with BUS/SDS at Kent State University. The seminal part of that year seemed to be when she started to volunteer at St. Elizabeth’s Psychiatric Hospital. In the book 13 Seconds: Confrontation at Kent State, her mother remembers:\n\n“’She used to help on a volunteer basis at St. Elizabeth’s Hospital there in Washington,’ said Doris Krause. ‘So few people could do it. She did it so well. As a mother, it was something I liked to see her do.” Allison would go off to St. Elizabeth’s, a mental hospital, and visit with the patients. Often she would play basketball with the men. They were patients that society had long for­gotten. They sat there in forlorn gloom, waiting for nothing, their eyes glazed, their lives a sea of silence. Some had not had visitors for as long as thirty years.’ Richard Jaworski would ask Allison to speak of her experiences at the hospital. She told the class that the inmates would let her shoot during the basketball games, leaving her undefended with the delight of her presence and interest. When a boy in class asked if it was not dangerous to work with the patients, she replied, ‘Love, they sense it. It calms them.’ The inmates were so grateful for her attention they never considered harm, she said.\n\n‘One day Allison returned home unusually happy; her eyes were aglow and she could not wait to tell her mother the wonderful thing that had happened at St. Elizabeth’s that day. A man had spoken to her! A man who had never spoken to anyone else for the longest time had spoken to her. It was one of the most exhilarating moments of her life. She felt that she had personally accomplished this.’”(Esterhas and Roberts, 1970)\n\nAllison started school at Kent State in the fall of 1969; her best friend was Bonnie Henry. She also met and fell in love with her boyfriend Barry Levine and they were together until her death the following spring. They attended the National Moratorium against the War in DC that November. While Allison attended one SDS meeting, with Bonnie and Barry, she was hardly impressed or convinced by their values and priorities. She was trying to understand the larger political atmosphere; again from 13 Seconds: Confrontation at Kent State,\n\n“At Kent the academic atmosphere and Allison’s searching curiosity pushed her deeper into the world of books. She read Kafka, the present Tom Wolfe, and Catch-22. Slowly her reading began to widen into the current political trends. She and Barry shared a political­ science class that friends say absorbed her. When the Black Panthers emerged in controversy, Allison applied her energies to satisfying her need to know. She began to believe that political repression was real and it frightened her. ‘She wanted to go to Canada and open an art gallery after school,’ Barry said. ‘We wanted to go there because of the growing political repression that we felt was increasing in this country. Things like the Chicago Seven, the Panthers, and the ineffectiveness of the Moratorium all led to her feeling of the coming and existing repression.’…When Spring came, Allison expressed her desire for the woods…’I wish there was some place where we could go and walk, some place with trees and flowers,’ she told Bonnie. ‘Some place away’…Things seemed to be going marvelously for Allison on her nineteenth birthday, on April 23. She was set for the summer and for Buffalo in the fall and most important, she had Barry. Her fifteen-year-old sister, Laurel, came up to visit her on her birthday and the following Sunday Arthur and Doris Krause drove up. Together with Barry, they ate at the Robin Hood restaurant just off campus. ‘She was so happy to get out for a meal,’ Doris Krause said. It was the last time they were to see their daughter alive.” (Esterhas and Roberts, 1970)\n\nThere are many stories and photos of Allison on May 4, 1970. Many of them are horrific and terrifying. I do not want to focus on those today. The one I think about most often is how, as she climbed the hill by the pagoda, she tore her small piece of wet cloth to help another student suffering from tear gas, shortly before she broke down in tears asking why the guard was treating them this way. Even to the end, Allison wanted to help others, to let people express themselves, whether through art or voicing dissent, she wanted to stand up for what she believed was right, fair and just. That was the way she was, woke.\n\nIn preparing for the speech, I asked Laurel if there was anything I could say for her family. She told me instead to listen to what Allison tells me and speak that truth. I went and sat at the bell late at night on April 23rd, and asked Allison how she felt on what would be her 67th birthday. She said she was sad, confused, angry, but still woke, still standing for truth and justice. She asked me a number of questions: “How could there be so many school shootings in 2018 alone? How could our society be as polarized, perhaps even worse than 48 years ago? How can so many Black people be openly killed and so few people care? How can we still be at war in the Middle East, and why don’t we care about the casualties, refugees and destruction these wars have produced? What are we doing to our mother Earth? When we will we ever learn that “flowers are better than bullets”? “Ah well.” she told me, “It is up you, Laurel, Jennifer, Samaria, and Emma Gonzalez to tell them now. I hope they finally listen.” I asked her “What can I do?” She gently reminded me with a loving smile, “Go and walk in the woods, make art, spend time with your family and mine, try to heal the wounds, love, and we will talk again.”\n\nIdris Kabir Syed, MFA, M.Ed.\n\nAssociate Professor and Faculty Advisor to the May 4th Task Force\n\nKent State University, Dept. Pan-African Studies\n\nOn May 4, 2016 at the 46th commemoration of the Kent State Massacre, Jennifer Schwartz stood for her cousin Allison Krause and offered this speech:\n\nAnother May 4th parent has died since last we gathered to commemorate this event. Another mother has left us before the truth is clear and justice is served. My aunt, Doris Krause, Allison’s mother, passed away peacefully under hospice care and in the arms of her sole surviving daughter Laurie on January 17th, just a few months ago. As she crossed over, she left behind decades of profound grief and struggle. Perhaps it is our world she now grieves. A world she taught her children to believe was just, civil, compassionate, and fair.\n\nAs I was growing up in Cleveland, my father, Doris’ nephew, used to council me, when I felt wronged by a friend or noted an injustice in the world, he used to say to me “Life isn’t fair.” And he knew. We all sat by feeling helpless as the Krause’s endured a very public grief, and extensive legal battles. Instead of receiving any formal acknowledgement of one of the gravest of misdeeds a government can inflict upon its citizens, they were subject to factually unfounded and prejudicial accusations thrust upon their daughter. In her eulogy for Aunt Doris, my cousin Laurie noted, “my mother lost a child. And that is perhaps the greatest burden of all. When we add to this how unnecessary Allison’s death was, the betrayal of it being carried out by a government meant to protect us, and the crushing pressure of the denial of accountability for now decades, I am truly astounded by the grace and fortitude with which Doris faced this legacy.”\n\nPlease join me in a moment of silence for Doris Levine Krause. May her memory be a blessing to us, may her struggle be released, may her quest for truth be carried forth.\n\nI never met my cousin Allison. I was a little nine month old learning to walk and run when she was stopped in her tracks by an M1 bullet right over there in the parking lot. So I have always been looking for the truth myself, searching for accounts that would provide clarity and do Allison and May 4th justice. It concerns me that this history be told and recorded accurately. Among the articles I have found was a 1971 piece, published in the National Review, by William F. Buckley.\n\nMr. Buckley noted that they found pebbles in her pocket. They called it evidence of her aggression, evidence of her crime. They called it evidence she wielded “missiles” of rock she had concealed in her pocket. Deadly? Really? That’s a sham. The classic, tawdry response: to blame the victim. What really had them shaking in their boots was not some rocks in the pocket of a college freshman with flowers in her hair, but that she wielded words of truth. She confronted their ethics, their judgement, and refused to accept President Nixon’s escalation of the war in Southeast Asia. She was one of many hundreds of thousands across the nation who took to the streets that weekend in May to protest. I could not be more proud of her. My cousin, Allison Krause, was a 19 year old honor’s student. Bright, compassionate, hard-working. She was killed that day as she raised her voice in opposition to a government that had gone morally astray. “They always point out that my daughter had gravel in her pockets,” said my aunt Doris, “that this was the rationale for killing her… why” she asked, “didn’t they throw gravel at her?”\n\nFor 46 years we’ve been parted from my cousin Allison. A lifetime! My lifetime. For 46 years we’ve sought answers. For 46 years the government’s been adept at denying culpability, avoiding responsibility and suppressing truth. For 46 years we’ve been lied to and brushed aside. We now know there was an order to shoot; we’ve heard it. Don’t tell us you were afraid for your lives with your loaded M1 rifles and your helmets and your high ground advantage. Don’t tell us you felt endangered when Governor Rhodes himself, your commander in chief, came to town to cheer you on and gave you carte blanche to “eradicate the problem.” For 46 years we’ve called for truth. My uncle Arthur led the legal battle for 10 years following May 4th. While we agreed to a settlement, we were not satisfied that truth was honored nor that justice was done. In a 1981 interview with J. Gregory Payne, my infuriated Uncle Arthur declared “We don’t want the damn money… we want the truth! We want the facts about how the four died. We aren’t afraid of the truth. We aren’t the ones who have been saying “no comment” for the past 10 years.” He went on: “I think we are all responsible for the killings at Kent. You can’t get away from the hatred being spread by national leaders during that time. That political period was one which bred hate and with Nixon and Rhodes fanning the fires you can expect killings as a result.” With all the hate speech going on these days by political leaders, I shudder to think what’s ahead, and like my cousin, I will not allow the hate to go unchallenged.\n\nAllison Beth Krause was the cherished first of two daughters born of Arthur and Doris Krause of Cleveland Heights, Ohio. She smiles at me whenever I see her, there in a handful of black and white photos. The impish seven year old girl sits there in a white dress and patent leather shoes next to her little sister Laurie, in the front row of a family portrait taken at my aunt and uncle’s 1958 wedding. I long to reach into the photographs and take her hands and play with her, hug her, know her.\n\nBack in those days in the early sixties, the Krause’s used to go on Sunday drives out in the country around Cleveland, often ending up at Kent, dining at the Robin Hood and enjoying the pastoral campus. Remarkably, at a very early age, Allison made her decision to attend college at Kent State University. She loved it here; she felt at home. She felt safe.\n\nIn a eulogy for my cousin, Richard Jaworski, one of her high school teachers at John F. Kennedy High School in Wheaton, Maryland, described her like this:\n\nConstantly she was surrounded by boys and girls who came not only to tell her their problems, but to laugh with her and bask in her quick wit and charm. Allison possessed a rare trait. She could move among many groups of students and always exhibit tolerance for the views of each group in which she participated. When baited by adults, some young people responded with anger and bitterness, if not violence. Allison expressed a passive, stoic quality, as if recognizing the injustice of name-calling, as if realizing the illness of the person filled with hate.”\n\nAs she found her political voice in high school, Allison joined other students who were opposed to the war in Vietnam, especially as friends got drafted. As a teenager, Allison participated in anti-war demonstrations. She knew that as an American she had a right to freedom of speech and a right to engage in peaceful assembly.\n\nShe entered Kent State University in the fall of 1969 where she quickly made friends, earned high marks in her studies, and met the love of her life, Barry Levine, another young student from New York who shared her values. Together they assembled with others on Friday May 1st on the commons to raise their voices against Nixon’s decision to escalate the war and send more troops into Cambodia. She spent that first weekend of May with friends, doing schoolwork, enjoying the first breath of spring and becoming increasingly concerned about the military presence on campus, now occupied by the National Guard.\n\nOn that beautiful, warm spring weekend Allison spent time outside, socializing with friends and talking with some guardsmen among the blooming lilacs. I have heard different accounts of this story, some say Allison placed a flower in the barrel of Guardsman Meyers’ rifle, others say the flower was already there. What is certain, is that guardsman’s smiling face is absolutely beaming in the photographs that have preserved that moment in time, with Allison, the flower, his rifle, and the irony and release of tension they all felt in that moment, as human beings who were on opposite sides of a conflict. And when Allison witnessed that guardsman’s superior come along and reprimand him there for having a silly flower in his gun barrel, Allison responded,\n\n“WHAT’S THE MATTER WITH PEACE? FLOWERS ARE BETTER THAN BULLETS!”\n\nThe next day Allison and Barry joined the increasingly tense voices on the commons as the students squared off with the heavily armed National Guard. In Payne’s May Day: Kent State, I found Barry’s accounting of these final moments of Allison’s life, which provides such insight into her character:\n\nAs we stood on the hill watching and waiting for the soldiers to make their move, Allison ripped in half the moistened cloth she had brought for protection against tear gas. Another dispersal order was given, yet no advance was made, so Allison felt safe in running a few yards to give a friend part of her already compromised cloth. She tore hers again and gave him half."
