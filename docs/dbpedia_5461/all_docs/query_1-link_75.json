        "text": "Peter Jedick's career as a best-selling author and historian spans several decades. On a national scale, he has authored four books and written for several magazines including America in World War II and Baseball America. As a local writer in Northeast Ohio, he has written for every major news organization including the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Cleveland Magazine, Sun Newspapers and The Cleveland Press. As the recipient of an Excellence in Journalism award from the Press Club of Cleveland, Jedick has been interviewed and recognized by numerous TV and radio shows. He also had a stint as an award-winning radio commentator for WKSU-FM, an NPR (National Public Radio) station. Jedick (peterjedick.com) is best known for his novel HIPPIES (Amazon), a fictional account of campus life surrounding the tragic events of the 1970 Kent State shootings. (hippiesbook.com) HIPPIES was well received on college campuses across the country when he addressed audiences at Harvard, Yale, Columbia and Ohio State University. Jedick was on the campus of Kent State when the tragedy occurred. Jedick's second novel, The West Tech Terrorist (Amazon), is a fictional account of life in Cleveland when the U.S. was on the brink of World War II. (westtechterrorist.com) The main character, Victor Blazek, is the sports editor of the his high school (West Tech) newspaper. He enlists the aid of his girl friend, Doris, to try and foil a sinister plot by Nazi sympathizers inside the school. But their attempt as amateur sleuths put both their lives in danger. His other two books are CLEVELAND: Where the East Coast Meets the Midwest and LEAGUE PARK, histories of Cleveland. (At the current time both of these non-fiction books are out of print.) But League Park is available on Amazon Kindle.\n\nActor and Narrator of 10+ years, classically trained, and the voice of 100+ articles for Mark Manson, best-selling author of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck. Connect with him @audionathan (FB/Tw) or @audio.nathan (IG).\n\nAfter selling all his possessions in 2010, Nathan spent years traveling to nearly every state and visiting over 20 countries, hearing countless, fascinating stories along the way.\n\nWhen he finally jumped into audiobooks in 2015, he discovered he still loved storiesâ€”only this time, he was giving them life.\n\nWhen not narrating, he hangs out with his Mexican rescue dog Paz (always training!), bakes bread, nerds out on Shakespeare, and hosts a podcast interviewing longtime working actors, where he shares their personal stories in hopes of mentoring the next generation of performers.\n\nTo stay informed of his future projects, as well as to download an exclusive, unpublished audiobook, visit https://audionathan.com/signup\n\nTo discuss a potential audiobook project or other work, send Nathan a message: https://audionathan.com/contact/"
