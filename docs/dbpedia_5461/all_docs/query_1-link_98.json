        "text": "In a year full of challenges, ideastream continued to implement its 2019–2021 Strategic Plan and further aligned ideastream’s strengths to better serve the community. To address a growing need for local journalism and the changing media landscape, ideastream conducted research in support of the development of a statewide public radio and digital news collaborative. When the collaborative is implemented, it will be the state’s largest newsroom and Ohio’s only daily statewide radio and digital news service. ideastream also began a collaboration with Kent State University’s public radio station, WKSU 89.7, to explore opportunities for growth and expansion of public media service in Northeast Ohio.\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic impacted lives across the globe, ideastream produced several content series and initiatives to keep the local community in-the-know. Across its broadcast and digital channels, ideastream provided important health updates, reported on the local impacts of the pandemic and shared Governor Mike DeWine’s COVID-19 briefings statewide. ideastream also offered educational resources to assist children, families and educators adapting to at-home learning. With in-person events canceled and many of Northeast Ohio’s iconic arts institutions closed, ideastream connected the community with engaging music and entertainment — offering a new daily classical music radio program, on-demand concert recordings and live digital performances that gave audiences access to local art and music.\n\nideastream embarked upon a new series of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives with its staff as our nation continued to struggle with legacies of injustice, racism and inequity. These efforts were implemented to help disrupt the vicious cycle of disinvestment and displacement that negatively impacts the vitality of communities of color. In addition, through its public media workforce collaborative, ideastream offered staff members professional opportunities to increase staff diversity and share best practices among regional public media stations.\n\nThanks to generous contributions from our members and supporters, ideastream was able to significantly increase its commitment to serving Northeast Ohio in a time of great need. On behalf of ideastream’s staff and board, thank you for helping ideastream expand community services and deliver innovative solutions. We’re here for you, and because of you.\n\nKevin E. Martin, President and CEO\n\nSandra Kiely Kolb, Board Chair\n\nRecognizing artists of color face barriers in the art world, ideastream’s Equity in Art series sought to amplify their work. Through this long-form digital series, ideastream profiled artists of various genres living and working in Northeast Ohio. FIVE IN-DEPTH MULTIMEDIA STORIES were produced for the project.\n\nOne story about Cleveland artist Charmaine Spencer was shared online nationally by PBS NewsHour.\n\nIn describing her art, Spencer said her sculpture expresses her joy and love for humanity while her social justice pieces express anger. Following the death of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer, she renewed her focus on art examining social issues.\n\nAs a sculptor, Spencer utilizes natural materials in her work. She aims to “put value back into things people see as valueless.”\n\nENGAGED LIVE\n\nDIGITAL AUDIENCES\n\nideastream hosted 12 livestreamed concerts on ideastream.org and Facebook Live. During the ongoing series Applause Performances and First Fridays, users engaged with musicians by commenting, sharing and reacting in real-time on Facebook.

Over the year, content created through the partnership reached over 18,800 digital users from 55 countries.\n\nAt a time when the Orchestra had to cancel in-person performances, ideastream and the Orchestra launched Lunchtime with The Cleveland Orchestra. The new weekday radio show connected listeners with musicians from the Orchestra and curated musical selections.\n\nThe Martin Luther King, Jr. Celebration Concert with The Cleveland Orchestra, aired in 153 markets, including each of the top 20 markets nationwide, making it available to 91% of U.S. television households.\n\nAs Americans faced a global pandemic, an election and political polarization, the One Small Step project brought people together. In collaboration with the national nonprofit StoryCorps, ideastream facilitated conversations between Ohioans with opposing political views.\n\nThe project resulted in 25 recorded conversations with 50 people that were shared online, broadcast on 90.3 WCPN and featured during a live digital event. ideastream was one of six stations across the U.S. chosen to lead in this initiative.\n\nThe live digital event, The Sound of Ideas Community Tour: One Small Step Across the Political Divide, received over 1,600 views on Facebook.\n\n“I don’t feel like you’re my polar opposite. I could see myself sitting down and having a longer conversation with you.”\n\nMaria Gigante, One Small Step Participant, Liberal\n\n“I echo what you said there. I’m very pleasantly surprised.”\n\nGail Larrow, One Small Step Participant, Conservative\n\nEvent Attendee Marshall A. commented, “Gail and Maria, great interview. Makes me proud to have you as fellow citizens!”\n\nSHARED STORIES FROM PUBLIC HOUSING\n\nHomes, a two-year reporting project, explored Cleveland’s Woodhill Homes, one of the oldest public housing developments in the nation.

In the second year of Homes, an in-person event, The Sound of Ideas Community Tour: Public Housing in Cleveland, and 16 multimedia stories were produced.\n\n86% OF WOODHILL HOMES RESIDENTS surveyed on-site reported learning something new about their neighborhood as a result of ideastream’s coverage. A Woodhill Homes resident commented, “If it’s on [the radio], it would mean what I said was worth hearing. It would have to be, I’d love it.”\n\nCONVENED COMMUNITY CONVERSATIONS\n\nThe Sound of Ideas, a weekday radio program on 90.3 WCPN, and The Sound of Ideas Community Tour, an event and livestream series, delivered a comprehensive analysis of news and offered explorations of community issues. In addition, ideastream broadcast The City Club of Cleveland’s City Club Forums live each week as the primary media partner.\n\n“I think ideastream may have lit a match that is going to start a fire of positive change.”\n\nSam McNulty, Cleveland Business Owner\n\n200 PEOPLE attended The Sound of Ideas Community Tour: Future of the West Side Market. The livestream of the event generated over 3,000 VIEWS.\n\nCOMMEMORATED THE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF THE KENT STATE UNIVERSITY SHOOTINGS\n\nThrough a series of reports, ideastream remembered the tragic events of May 4, 1970, when Ohio National Guard troops killed four students and wounded nine others during the course of an anti-war protest at Kent State University.\n\nIn response to one of ideastream’s stories, Nancy Tuttle [pictured above], the sister of William Schroeder, who was killed by guardsmen that day, said \"Thank you for this narrative. I was out of state and have had to piece together what happened when my brother was killed.\"\n\nThe 50th season of NewsDepth, ideastream’s instructional multimedia series for children, was unlike any other. Most of the season’s full-length episodes were produced, as usual, in ideastream’s studios. Though, as children transitioned to remote schooling during the pandemic, NewsDepth pivoted to at-home production. The series launched shortened online Backpack episodes that were specially formatted for at-home learning and online teaching.\n\nNewsDepth’s 50th season engaged 23% MORE USERS than the previous season.
