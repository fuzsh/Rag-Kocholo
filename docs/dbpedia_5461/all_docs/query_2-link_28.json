We Are Devo! and Wheels of Fortune: The Story of Rubber in Akron. Earlier this year David snapped up first place for the 2004 Ohio Associated Press award in Broadcast Writing. This practical and insightful journalist is an Akron Beacon Journal columnist (here), but he’s also shown versatility as a writer on MTVs Beavis and Butthead. David also contributes as a comentator for WKSU 89.7FM.\n\nCool Cleveland: At one time, Akron, Cleveland and Detroit were centers for innovation, industry and technology, sort of like the Silicon Valley of the early 1900s. Do you see Akrons historical technological competitiveness being leveraged in todays world economy? What happened?\n\nDavid Giffels: Im gonna steal a little from you. When I wrote Wheels of Fortune, I said that Akron was the Silicon Valley of its day; not only were the big industries settled in one place, they also became a magnet for other entrepreneurs. After about 20 years, they weeded each other out, and it became this monolith of industrial headquarters and manufacturing, and eventually, everyone became very complacent. By the post-war years, it wasnt necessary to invent anything new, since everything was already in place. And when that crumbled, no one had a model except for giant headquarters, a place where you would get a job in a factory that would pay really well. No one could come up with a creative way to make a living since that was all anyone knew. But what I saw with my peers at Akron University in the ’80s was this intense creativity; people writing about the industrial landscape, painting it and creating magazines. A lot of people look at this region as raw material for the future. I see potential right now for a creative approach, where we are not worrying about Akrons past and moving forward, and the deck is ready for someone to come in with their innovation. Akron has this world class polymer facility at the University, and Kent has this liquid-crystal facility, and they should be working together, but we havent figured out how to throw a net over it, keeping this really important intellectual base to retain these people in town after they graduate.\n\nWhats wrong with Northeast Ohio? Why cant we seem to catch up to the changing world?\n\nA lot of it is old-school mindset that even young people who grow up here have, including me. There are all these echoes that you pick up when you grow up here, and you begin to believe certain stereotypes about yourself; and Ive said many times that we have an inferiority complex. I look at it and its basically an insult to myself. Im sure I could have made a life somewhere else, so have I settled for second rate? And thats not true. I have a 4-minute commute, I have a house I could never afford in other markets, and I have things that I would struggle to get in other places. Plus, our thrift stores here rule…\n\nRead the Cool Cleveland Interview with David Giffels here\n\nElevate your marketing to new levels Dedicated Cool Cleveland readers recognize how the Cool Cleveland e-letter stands apart.

When they heard the Gravity Games had the ramps available at the reasonable cost of $35,000, the administration moved quickly to gain the approval from City Council to secure the ramps and figure the rest out later. The normal Cleveland process would have been to study the situation, costing more money, and then deciding that it either wasn’t feasible, or deciding too late to take advantage of the opportunity. But they did it right this time, and now, finally, they’ve installed the park (the administration’s press release repeatedly calls it the city’s “first” SK8 park, suggesting that we may see more…) right behind the Rock Hall on East Ninth Street. With fencing by Cleveland artist Raymond Bugelski, water fountains, bike racks and emergency 911 speakerphones, the SK8 park is an essential ingredient in making Downtown more liveable and cool. Congrats to Campbell, Cimperman, and all of City Council for finding the total cost of $311,402 to buy and install what we hope will be the first of many SK8 parks and participative sports facilities throughout Cleveland. Unfortunately, the press release is not on the city’s web site, and with an average of only one press release every three days, the Campbell administration doesn’t seem to be taking advantage of getting the word out on great accomplishments such as this awesome SK8 park. See the Mayor’s press releases here.\n\nArt volunteering is sexy!

You may want to join the Ohio Association of Railroad Passengers at their Train Festival 2004 from Fri 7/30 thru 8/1 in Uhrichsville, Ohio at the Dennison Railroad Depot Museum, near New Philadelphia, South of Canton. In addition to Festival activities such as eight operating passenger trains, several dozen pieces of railroad equipment on display (rare passenger coaches, miniature and model trains), and a railroad flea market, the OARP is also hosting a Summer Meeting & Family Outing from 9:30AM-noon on Sat 7/31, where you can learn about advocacy efforts to increase passenger rail in Ohio, get an update on what the Ohio Rail Development Commission and the Ohio & Lake Erie Regional Rail-Cleveland Hub are doing, and offer your own input on the State of Ohio’s draft Access Ohio transportation plan, which includes ideas for increased passenger rail. http://www.OhioansForPassengerRail.com\n\nStrike against privacy In a bizarrely narrow decision, the First Court of Appeals in Massachusetts ruled that a website and e-mail service provider did not violate the Wiretap Act, even though he surreptitiously copied and read the e-mail messages of customers who used his e-mail services. Branford Councilman ran a rare and out-of-print book site and offered e-mail accounts through his site. He would intercept messages to his customers from competitors such as Amazon.com so he could find out what his customers were looking for, thereby gaining a competitive advantage. But since he didn’t block the e-mail from reaching his customers, and since the mail passed through his hard drive storage, the court ruled that he didn’t interfere with messages “in transit.” See Wired\n\nLibrarians for intellectual freedom This website spells out readers’ intellectual freedom as expressed by the American Library Association’s Library Bill of Rights and Freedom to Read Statements.

Usually tapping private, foundation and corporate sources, the CMA has recently been seeking creative financing for their expected $225-300 million Rafael Vignoly renovation (“a dramatic makeover”) that would almost double the size of the Museum. Pointing out that Museum visitors generate over $21 million per year in economic stimulus to our region, they are asking the State for $25 million over four years. They are also looking for $2 million from the Feds for educational programs and $9 million over three years from the Federal Highway Administration for help in building an “intermodal” parking garage that would also house bikes and public transportation. See Plain Dealer here.\n\nCleve ranks high in arts Americans for the Arts released its first national Creative Industries Study, which finds that creative industry businesses, both nonprofit and for-profit, make up 4.3% of all U.S. businesses, and they employ 2.2% of all employees.

And “brain gain” sounds a little too pollyanna. “Youth Movement” is the official tag, soon to be accompanied by a logo (Akron’s Downtown already has a motto: “So Much, So Close”), and Akron Beacon Journal columnist David Giffels is serious about investigating how we can stop more of his young friends from leaving the region. The piece captures the dichotomy of a cool region unable to sell itself, and is filled with quotes from consultant Rebecca Ryan and Cool Cleveland’s Thomas Mulready, and is backed up with the kind of historical references one might expect from Giffels, who has written history books on both the city of Akron and the band Devo.

Roving reporters with laptops attached to video cameras connected wirelessly to the web, will be projecting live video feeds through wireless nodes to a high-speed backbone in Ashland, Oregon. Go to the web site, click on a still photo, and you’ll be connected to a live webcam from that location, as long as you have broadband and Quicktime 6 installed. Using stuff you can get at Circuit City, soon anyone will be able to broadcast to the web in what they’re calling “Community Event Embedded Reporting,” which is the result of a partnership between Apple Computer, Ashland Fiber Network, and Project A; its President and CEO Jim Treece offered, “People ask us why we are doing this.

He’s also a fashion photographer living and creating in the artist live/work space in the experimental Tower Press Building, where rent subsidies are available to artists who pass a juried review process.\n\nI caught up with Georgio who is a ground floor tenant. His studio is small but exceedingly spacious, with a room divider that separates his sleeping quarters from the rest of the studio. Inside, paintings and fashion design illustrations covered every inch of wall space, and this creative disarray gave the studio an exotic quality found in movies like “Casablanca” or “Girl with the Pearl Earring.” Behind the Japanese screen-like dividers, the bedroom area was absolutely hit; apparent clothing designs in various modes of completion cast among sheets and bolts of material, drawings and sketches formed an intertwining pyramid. Light flooded in from the outside, toasting the air in my mind’s version of this reality as I sat at a small table.\n\nCavana Faithwalker: How long have you been here and how did ya get in?\n\nGeorgio Sabino: Since June 2003 all the artists got juried to be here and “they” got a grant for this to happen; it’s all artists which is a wonderful thing: painting, sculpture, fashion design, filmmaking and other arts.\n\nFrom what I understand it’s subsidized but still very costly, since rents run from $625 for 600 square feet to $2200 for about 1,950 square feet\n\nIt’s expensive but it’s downtown, exposed brick, T-1 enabled, high ceilings, lots of light. You have that lifestyle you wished for, so it’s not bad.\n\nHave your thoughts turned to how to work with the business community. How to work with the Small Business Association. To get a model of how they make money.\n\nThe Mayor’s office is really accessible, and people like Joe Cimperman are available all the time. I go to COSE and I go to the Foundation Center. At COSE the conversation has been entrepreneurship in the arts. Stuff like how to write a business plan, what is the environment like, what would your niche be. I had an MBA workin’ for me to make sure we got positioned correctly for monies that were available at one time; trying to find grants, trying to write grants and looking for fellowships.\n\nHow do you see the arts scene here is Cleveland?\n\nWe are trying to develop a collecting public that will support the arts. My thought is, “Quit buying Monets unless you’re buying the original.” Why spend X amount of dollars on art work that is highly inflated? I mean, a lot of times you get a decent frame but you could own some really sensational local art by living artists. And not just Cleveland; in my opinion, we have regional and national artists as good as any you care to mention.\n\nRead Cav’s Corner with Georgio Sabino here.\n\nFabulous Revitalization Plan\n\nby Cool Cleveland contributor Bob Rhubart\n\nIf television teaches us anything, it’s that at moments of personal crisis, when our self-esteem tanks out, when our self confidence departs like air from a punctured balloon, when things have just gone pitifully, painfully stale, one should do whatever  or whoever  is necessary to land a spot on a TV makeover program. Given a general budget crisis, a school budget crisis, dysfunctional city government, disappointing sports teams and a faltering local economy, wed make an excellent makeover candidate. The question is, which makeover program is the best choice? Trading Spaces wont work. A bold new color scheme, some throw pillows, a couple of lamps, and some houseplants aint gonna cut it. Besides, we might get Pittsburgh as a trading partner, and thats just asking for trouble. We could end up with Steelers wallpaper and coffee table made from Iron City cans. And theyll get cute, of course, and move the sofa and refrigerator out to the porch, and fill the closet with leisure suits. And then well have to wait for them in the parking lot and explain things. Even worse, we could end up with Detroit. Besides, “Trading Spaces” is just redecorating. Redecoration doesnt get us to revitalization.\n\nMaybe we should try Extreme Makeover or The Swan. Imagine what a small army of plastic surgeons, cosmetic dentists, make-up artists, grooming consultants, stylists, fashion experts, and personal trainers could do for Clevelands sagging sense of self-worth  not to mention those little fleshy sandwich bags under our upper arms. Just a few short weeks of sucking meals through a straw while wrapped head-to-toe in gauze, and well be ready for that moment when the bandages come off, the designer frock goes on, and the once ugly duckling looks for the first time in weeks into a full length mirror and exclaims, Yo! Check out the rack!…\n\nRead Fabulous Revitalization Plan by Bob Rhubart here.\n\nInstant Karma\n\nQuik reviews of recent events\n\nGoing out this weekend?

Music Director Beth Hankins has succeeded in injecting the energy and excitement and passion of rock and roll into a traditionally staid high school orchestra program. Featuring eight electric Viper violins and cellos, custom-designed by Trans-Siberia Orchestra leader Mark Wood, along with rock drums, electric bass and guitar, synthesizer, plus a full string orchestra section, the huge ensemble floats like a flutterbye and stings like a snake on a repertoire that whipsaws from The Who’s Tommy to Vivaldi’s Winter… http://www.TheLakewoodProject.net\n\nRead the review of The Lakewood Project and view photos here\n\nMiami String Quartet @ Kent State’s Ludwig Recital Hall 6/30\n\nWhen Blossom Music Center opened in 1968, a partnership with Kent State University was also formed. Students would gain training in the visual and performing arts through variously configured programs. Kent/Blossom Music is the oldest of these collaborations, having just begun its 37th season.\n\nWednesday summertime evenings in Ludwig Recital Hall on the Kent campus boast a variety of musical ensembles. Based on opening night, these programs should definitely be added to the schedule of chamber music devotées in Northeast Ohio. It should be explained that there is a mixture of subscription and free concerts, many of them featuring musicians from the Cleveland Orchestra, as well as students in the music program. An added musical treat is the presence of the Miami String Quartet, new faculty artists-in-residence at KSU…\n\nRead the review by Cool Cleveland contributor Kelly Ferjutz here\n\nYr Turn\n\nCool Cleveland readers write\n\nSend your letters to: letters@coolcleveland.com\n\nOn the Cool Cleveland Interview of Barbara Byrd-Bennett Thank you for the excellent Barbara Byrd-Bennett interview. It renews my faith in this outstanding leader. She truly has a vision. She truly understands the place of Cleveland in the region. It is a shame that other regional leaders cannot (will not?) see and respond to this crisis. We must understand that the region dies if Cleveland dies. No suburb is strong enough to sustain the regional infrastructure. We are blessed with Barbara Byrd-Bennett’s presence in Cleveland. Thank you.\n\nfrom Cool Cleveland reader Larry Kendra eastecon@adelphia.net\n\nOn the Spencer Tunick installation Great to read about the experiences of Clevelanders (?) at Spencer’s installation last weekend. As one of the 4300 who posed in Melbourne, Australia in October 2001, I can relate to being nude in the cold for a long period of time, and of how the feelings, excitement and sheer exhilaration of taking part certainly overcome concerns about the temperature or being naked in public. In fact, I think being naked with that many other naked people, means you very quickly forget “nakedness” as an issue, but develop an awareness of the differences and similarities between “people”. One thing that Spencer’s work does demonstrate is that regardless of our differences, we are all part of a common humanity, with many more similarities than differences. Perhaps the world would learn a few of these lessons if Spencer could organise compulsory participation in such an installation for all Official delegates to the United Nations.\n\nfrom Australian Cool Cleveland reader Rob Stephenson r.stephenson@bendigo.latrobe.edu.au\n\nOn the Spencer Tunick installation Just thought you’d like to know that there was more than just one person who lost their clothes during the Spencer Tunick installation. Fortunately I found mine! 🙂 After the women only photo was taken, my friend and I headed back to the spot where we had disrobed. But amidst the crowd of naked women, and still clothed men, we could not find our clothes! When Spencer announced that it was time for the men to pose, one very generous and sympathetic man came up to us, disrobed, and handed each of us one of his sweatshirts, saying, “Here, wear these to stay warm while you are looking for your clothes. Just return my sweatshirts to this spot after you are dressed.” We were very appreciative of his kindness and respect.\n\nfrom Cool Cleveland reader Peg Ehrlinger ehrlinger@sbcglobal.net\n\nOn the Spencer Tunick installation Thanks for the great job you do with Cool Cleveland. Keeps me connected. Liked your report on Tunick’s Cleveland installation. I was there too and enjoyed the experience you describe of cold pavement turning warm as it gave back warmth to our naked skin. Also when every one dropped their clothes and marched off en masse, nude, towards E.9th I burst out laughing as at a punchline of a good joke, only this one was visual.\n\nfrom Cool Cleveland reader Jean Sommer jean_sommer@yahoo.com\n\nSend your letters to: letters@coolcleveland.com\n\nTop 5\n\nCool Cleveland uses Opticast tools to track which articles were clicked the most.
