        "text": "Dover native, Amanda Rabinowitz, local host of NPR’s “Morning Edition” on radio station WKSU 91.5 FM, will present a program at the Tuscarawas County Public Library in New Philadelphia at 6:30 p.m. Sept. 10 in the Tuscarawas County Public Library at 121 Fair Ave. NW.\n\nThe program is free. To reserve a seat call the library at 330-364-4474, Ext. 101. Information also is available at the website www.tusclibrary.org\n\nRabinowitz, who was recently named this year’s best anchor by Ohio Associated Press Broadcasters, will discuss what it is like to work in a NPR newsroom and highlight some of her most notable works.\n\nRecently, Rabinowitz took the time to answer several questions. Here’s what she had to say:\n\nFamily: Mother, Nancy Rabinowitz of Dover\n\nEducation: BA in communications and journalism from Ohio University; MA from the University of Akron in mass media and communications\n\nJob: “Morning Edition” host and reporter at WKSU Public Radio\n\nWhat is a typical day for you? Work and more work! I arrive at the radio station at 4 a.m. to begin preparing to host Morning Edition, which airs on WKSU from 5 to 9 a.m. Then, I work on news stories until about 1 p.m. . Two evenings a week, I teach an undergraduate radio production class at the University of Akron.\n\nWho or what influenced your decision to go into radio? I had an interest in television ever since a field trip to NBC Studios in New York when I was kid in New Jersey. My passion for radio was solidified when my mom encouraged me to apply for a reporter opening at WJER radio in Dover after my freshman year at Ohio University. They took a chance on an 18-year-old kid. The rest is history.\n\nWhat are some of the highlights of your career? The opportunity to report about significant issues affecting northeast Ohio, including heroin and prescription pill abuse. The greatest moment of my career so far was winning a national Edward R. Murrow award last year from the Radio Television Digital News Association for a story about prescription painkiller abuse in college sports. Being honored for your work is an incredible feeling, but even greater when you know it's for a story that helps raise awareness about a serious issue.\n\nIf you were not working for NPR what job would you like to have? My favorite thing to do is to discover new music and go to concerts. So, I would probably try to work in the music industry in some capacity.\n\nWhat is the title of the last book you read? “Bigger Than the Game: Restitching a Major League Life” by Dirk Hayhurst.\n\nHow do you relax? At home with my cats and some Netflix.\n\nPeople would be surprised to know? Despite being on the radio every morning for years, I have a major fear of public speaking!"
