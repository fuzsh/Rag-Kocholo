        "text": "On last week’s Radio Survivor show, my colleague Eric Klein did a fascinating interview with Eric Nuzum about the podcasting landscape. In the wide-ranging conversation, Nuzum talks about his college radio past at Kent State University in the mid-to-late 1980s.\n\nI love a college radio origin story, so it was fun to hear about his time at WKSR (which has subsequently morphed into an online station). He recounted the freedom they had at the station and some of the “dumb, goofy” stuff that he did, adding, “I was allowed to just play around,” explaining that it really helped him to learn about audio equipment and radio. Through that, he said, “I was building a pretty amazing arsenal of production technique.” That experimentation quickly led to work for Nuzum as an intern at the public radio station WKSU on campus, babysitting tapes late at night. Years later he became the Programming Director there at age 29, forging a path for later jobs at NPR and beyond.\n\nSaving Black College Radio History\n\nThis week’s Radio Survivor podcast was equally inspiring for college radio fans. Radio producer and archivist Jocelyn Robinson spoke with us about her HBCU Radio Station Archival Survey Project. As she travels around the country visiting college radio stations at Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Robinson is developing an understanding of the archival landscape. Most importantly, she’s learning a lot about the inherent challenges of college radio and is helping to forge connections between stations and archivists in order to preserve radio history.\n\nMore College Radio News\n\nEvents\n\nKVSC’s Trivia Weekend is Almost Here (KNSI)\n\nHistoric World Radio Day Event in Italy (College Radio Foundation)\n\nAuburn Feud Episode 1: Watch the Circle and WEGL 91.1 FM Compete (Eagle Eye TV)\n\nProfiles of Stations and Programming\n\nStudent Radio Advocates for More Usage (Webster Journal)\n\nNewsmarketToday Partners with 102.7 CHOP FM for Weekly Headlines Show (NewsmarketToday)\n\nSports Podcasts at University of Chicago (Robert Feder)\n\nStudent Radio Organizations\n\nStudent Radio Network Approaches Forty (Scoop News)\n\nCollege Radio History\n\nPodcast #232: Documenting and Preserving College Radio at HBCUs (Radio Survivor)\n\nChris Wallace Recalls College Radio Past (The Media Times)\n\nStudent’s KSLU Documentary Featured in Regional Media (St. Lawrence University)\n\nKSLU President Creates Documentary about SLU’s Student Radio Station (St. Lawrence County NNY360)\n\nKSLU Documentary: Charles Sirotek’s Most Excellent Analysis of Radio (YouTube)\n\nCollege Radio Alumni\n\nAsian Beat: Yaeji (The Daily Campus)\n\nThe Center Session: An Exclusive Evening with KLOS 95.5 Host Christian James Hand (Broadway World)\n\nRadio, Music Trailblazer David B.
