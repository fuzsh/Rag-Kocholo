        "text": "KENT, Ohio – Due to the coronavirus crisis, Kent State has canceled its weekend of in-person events commemorating the 50th anniversary of May 4, 1970 – when the Ohio National Guard opened fire on students during a Vietnam War protest, killing four students and injuring nine – and is instead holding a series of online events.\n\nThe virtual programs include videos, digital exhibits and other resources designed to teach people about the shootings and to honor the victims.\n\nThe cornerstone of the commemoration events will be a commemoration video that is set to go live at 12 p.m. on Monday, May 4.\n\nA recorded version of the “May 4th Voices” play, featuring actors including Tina Fey and her husband, Kent State alum Jeff Richmond, is airing on radio stations across the country over the next week. It will be broadcast on May 4 at 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. on WKSU-89.7 FM, and at 10 p.m. on WCPN-90.3 FM.\n\nA virtual candlelight vigil is online now at www.kent.edu/may4kentstate50/virtual-candlelight-vigil. The webpage includes a video of four candles flickering, one for each of the students killed. It also features a picture of the candles which can be saved and shared on social media.\n\nParticipants in the virtual candlelight vigil can post a picture of a lit candle, or of themselves holding a lit candle, to social media with the tag “#KentStateMay4.”\n\nSeveral online exhibits are now available, including an augmented reality experience and a collection of maps that includes oral histories about Kent State’s campus.\n\nDozens of videos are available to watch. Musicians - including David Crosby, Graham Nash, Jorma Kaukonen, Jerry Casale of Devo and Jesse Colin Young from the Youngbloods – reflect on the events of May 4 and how the event influenced their careers and music.\n\nThere’s videos from May 4, 1970 witnesses and survivors, videos about the May 4 Visitors Center, the walking tour and the National Historic Landmark dedication, and videos from past May 4 commemorations and historic footage.\n\nThe website includes the audio from the press conference held by six Kent State students after they met with President Richard Nixon on May 6, 1970, just two days after the shooting. It also features a recent video interview with Don Grant, who was one of the students involved."
