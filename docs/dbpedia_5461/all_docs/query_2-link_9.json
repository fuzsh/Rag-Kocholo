He was buried Tuesday at a cemetery about 100 feet from the front door of his home atop a hill with views of the Cascade Mountains.\n\nTroops killed four people and wounded nine at a May 4, 1970, demonstration against the Vietnam war.\n\nWhen Olds arrived the following year, he said his role was \"helping students find constructive ways of bringing about change.\"\n\nTim Watson, an attorney at the university who once was Olds' chauffeur as a graduate student, said Olds was known to mingle with students at rallies and sit-ins.\n\n\"He was the right president for the time,\" Watson said.\n\nAn ordained minister and former professional boxer and United Nations official, Olds left Kent State for Alaska Methodist University, now Pacific University, in Anchorage. He later won the Democratic nomination for a U.S. Senate seat in Alaska, but lost the general election.\n\nOlds held a master's of divinity from Garrett Evangelical Theological Seminary in Illinois, a master's of philosophy from Northwestern University and a doctoral degree in philosophy from Yale.\n\nHe was a consultant to President John F. Kennedy on the creation of the Peace Corps and played a role in the formation of VISTA, Volunteers in Service to America. While he chose to be ordained a Methodist minister, his parents raised him as a Quaker.\n\nOlds is survived by his wife, Eva, and two children.\n\nA memorial service is set for Saturday in Portland, Ore.\n\nHistory Channel filming May 4 documentary\n\nThe History Channel will be airing a documentary about the May 4 shootings, as the first episode of a series focusing on key events of the baby boomer generation.\n\nThe crew will be on campus throughout the week, filming and interviewing in various locations.\n\nJohn Mounier, director, producer and cameraman for the series, said May 4 was selected as the first event because of its significance.\n\n\"I mean, what a truly defining moment,\" he said..

Sandy Scheuer had jet-black hair, a freckled nose and a contagious laugh. We were both sophomores at Kent State University in the fall of 1968. [MORE]\n\nKevin C. Sheard, professor of law,\n\ndefended guardsmen in KSU deaths\n\nKevin C. Sheard, a retired law professor who helped provide counsel to Ohio National Guardsmen charged in the Kent State University shootings of May 4, 1970, died Friday at age 89.\n\nThe retired law professor, who taught at Cleveland State University's Cleveland Marshall College of Law for nearly 20 years, co-founded the John Adams Society in 1974 to provide free legal help to eight former guardsmen charged with violating the civil rights of 13 Kent students who were shot during an anti-war demonstration. Four of the students died. [MORE]\n\nWHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR KSU?\n\nA Protest, a Spy Program and a Campus in an Uproar\n\nThe protest was carefully orchestrated, planned for weeks by Students Against War during Friday evening meetings in a small classroom on the University of California campus at Santa Cruz.\n\nSo when the military recruiters arrived for the job fair, held in an old dining hall last April 5 - a now fateful day for a scandalized university - the students had their two-way radios in position, their cyclists checking the traffic as hundreds of demonstrators marched up the hilly roads of this campus on the Central Coast and a dozen moles stationed inside the building, reporting by cellphone to the growing crowd outside.\n\n\"Racist, sexist, antigay,\" the demonstrators recalled shouting. \"Hey, recruiters, go away!\"\n\nThings got messy. As the building filled, students storming in were blocked from entering. The recruiters left, some finding that the tires of their vehicles had been slashed. The protesters then occupied the recruiters' table and, in what witnesses described as a minor melee, an intern from the campus career center was injured.\n\nFast forward: The students had left campus for their winter vacation in mid-December when a report by MSNBC said the April protest had appeared on what the network said was a database from a Pentagon surveillance program. The protest was listed as a \"credible threat\" - to what is not clear to people around here - and was the only campus action among scores of other antimilitary demonstrations to receive the designation.

The report condemned both police and anti-war protesters for engaging in violent behavior.\n\n\"Students who bomb and burn are criminals.

Young people rallied against the Vietnam War, staging sit-ins at their college campuses and declaring \"Hell no, we won't go.\" But the war in Iraq, despite some similarities to the Vietnam conflict and growing discontent among the general population, appears not to have the same effect on people in their late teens and 20s.\n\n\"It seems like it's not in the forefront anymore. Just a blip on the news,\" said Raeann Veneziale, 24, of Brook Park, Ohio. \"It doesn't really affect day-to-day life.\"\n\nNeil May's experience during the Vietnam War couldn't be more different (Photo, right).\n\n\"I was a long-haired hippy rock 'n' roller,\" said May, now a charismatic Catholic priest.

The charges were the result of Airhart climbing an Army recruiters rock wall on Oct. 19 and hanging a banner advocating peace.

Like the fact that most of the dead bodies that I saw were women and children, innocent civilians. Also, most of my friends that were killed were killed by friendly fire from close air support. It is obvious that there is some hidden agenda behind Bush's motivation for going to war in Iraq, because they had nothing to do with the 9-11 attacks, and there were no weapons of mass destruction. We should know the real reasons that we are fighting and dying over there. At the very least, we should know that, be it a good or bad reason, it is important that we know why. If it is that crucial that it stays a secret, it is probably too crooked to be worth fighting for anyway.

On August 8, The Washington Post reported on Pentagon plans to have normal military troops intervene domestically in various crisis scenarios, despite the fact that the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 severely restricts the use of troops in domestic law enforcement. The long-range concern here is that introducing active-duty troops onto American streets could lead to military involvement in politics and eventually, under the cloak of some future crisis, to military government. In the meantime, worries arise about the transferability of skills that troops need in war zones where civil liberties and other niceties play little or no role, to political demonstrations on the streets of, say, Washington, D.C., or Cleveland. The article contains various reassurances that there’s no cause for alarm. But the Post got this story from “officers who drafted the plans.” Assuming the officers spoke to the reporter with the permission of their superiors, that means the military is floating the idea to see whether it actually bothers anyone.

[MORE]\n\nStudents party in peace\n\nProper planning, a police presence and cool, wet weather led to a quiet weekend at the University of Akron and Kent State University. Traditionally, the first weekend in May has led to wild parties and problems. In recent years, as police gave advance notification to students that they would prosecute anyone who broke the law, parties have been controlled. Akron police said 21 males and nine females were arrested on alcohol-related charges near the University of Akron but there were no injuries or property damage. Kent police said there were few problems at KSU.\n\nWanted: The Truth About The Kent State Killings\n\nTo this day, the definitive book about that terrible day has not been written. Certainly, some informative works have been published but they have concentrated only on some aspects. What we need is a book that fairly examines all the events. \"And yes, there are new materials\" to be found, especially in the invaluable and extensive May 4 collection at the Kent State library, says Nancy Birk, its Curator and University Archivist, citing as examples the US Department of Justice and Charles Thomas papers.\n\nThe May 4th Deaths: Kent State 30 Years Ago [May 4, 2000]\n\nABOUT THIS SITE In 2000, the student journalists who covered the events of May 1970 returned to Kent State to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the shootings. This website grew out of that gathering. Reader suggestions and comments are welcome. Thank you.\n\nEmail Webmaster."
