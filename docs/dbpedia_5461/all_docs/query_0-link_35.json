        "meta_description": "On this special Podcast today, you'll hear another two hour segment from the groundbreaking Progressive/alternative college radio program, FRESH AIR, captured on cassette tape on June 22, 1978.  I was a host on WKSU-FM's \"Fresh Air,\" the late night, student run program during the heyday of Northeastern Ohio's prevalence in rock and alternative musics in the 1970's and 80's.  Today's archival tape, restored and remastered by Dr. Woo,(a former Program Director of the show) is one of over 200 hours of tapes of this legendary program which aired from 1973 until 1981.  \r\n\r\nFresh Air was coming into it's own by the date of this tape, having recently moved from a midnight to 3 AM time slot to a 11PM to 6 AM spot almost every night. The program had debuted an \"Artist of the Week\" feature to better educate the audience (and the DJ's as well) as to the styles of music we were playing back then.  Artists like Brian Eno, Peter Hammill, Gong, and John Martyn were among those featured.\r\n\r\nThe show had begun printing it's bi-monthly \"Fresh Air Program Guide\" at the time and distributing it in record stores all over Northern Ohio. We had also added a weekly \"Import Album Premiere\" every Saturday night and had begun an interview/music program called the \"Industrial Wasteland\" with  many of the artists we played.  Fresh Air and WKSU also began co-sponsoring concerts with Kent State's \"All Campus Programming Board\" and other outside venues.  \r\n\r\nTo hear more of this groundbreaking program and it's innovative style of free form, progressive radio and the numerous interviews with those performers we played go to the link provided below:\r\nhttp://xerographicoppossum.blogspot.com/\r\n\r\nHere then, is the playlist from Fresh Air on June 22, 1978:\r\n\r\nSET #1:  \r\nDAVID GILMOUR-\"No Way\"-1st Solo LP/\r\nJEFF WAYNE/Various Artists- \"Horsell Common and the Heat Ray (Part 1)- War of the Worlds/\r\nROY BUCHANAN-\"You're Not Alone\"-You're Not Alone/\r\nJEFF WAYNE-\"Horsell Common and the Heat Ray (Part 2)-War of the Worlds/\r\n\r\nSET 2:  \r\nJIMI HENDRIX-\"Are You Experienced?\"/\r\nSTOMU YAMASHTA - \"Surfspin-Time is Here\"- Go Live in Paris/\r\nTHE DOORS-\" Not to Touch the Earth\"- Waiting for the Sun/\r\nTIN HUEY-\"Puppet Wipes\"-(EP)/\r\nPERE UBU-\"Cloud\"- Datapanik in the Year Zero(EP)/\r\nSYD BARRETT-\"Baby Lemonade\"-BARRETT\r\n\r\nSET #3:  \r\nEGG-\"Ennaegram\"-Civil Service/\r\nJUKKA TOLONEN-\"Witch Drum\"-Cross Section/\r\nALAN PARSONS PROJECT-\"Voyager &amp; What Goes Up\"- Pyramid/\r\nTHE STRAWBS-\"Ghosts\"-Ghosts/\r\nFAR EAST FAMILY BAND-\"Timeless Phase\"-Tenjukin/\r\n\r\nSET #4:  \r\nFRANK ZAPPA-\"Big Leg Emma\"-Zappa in New York/\r\nKEN NORDINE-\"The Videot\"-How Are Things in Your Town?/\r\nJOE BYRD-\"American Way of Love\"- The United States of America\"/\r\nTANGERINE DREAM-Part 1\"- Phaedra/\r\nTOM GLASER &amp; DOTTIE EVANS-\"Zoom a Little Zoom Rocket Ship\"-Space Songs \r\n(**played in the middle of the Phaedra Part 1 cut)\r\nTANGERINE DREAM-\"Part 2\"-Phaedra",
