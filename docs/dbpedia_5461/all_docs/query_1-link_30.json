        "text": "This article is about the university in Ohio. For the 1970 shootings of anti-war protesters, see Kent State shootings.\n\nKent State University (also known as Kent, Kent State, and KSU) is a public research university located in Kent, Ohio, United States. The university has eight campuses around the Northeast Ohio region with the main campus in Kent being the largest. Other campuses are located in Ashtabula, Burton, East Liverpool, Jackson Township, New Philadelphia, Salem, and Warren, Ohio.\n\nAs of September 2012, Kent State is one of the largest universities in Ohio with an enrollment of 42,513 students in the eight-campus system and 28,806 students at the main campus in Kent.[5] It is ranked by the Carnegie Foundation as one of the top 77 public research universities in the US and one of the top 76 in community engagement.[6] In 2010, Kent State was ranked as one of the top 200 universities in the world by Times Higher Education.[7] Kent State offers over 300 degree programs, among them 250 baccalaureate, 40 associate's, 50 master's, and 23 doctoral programs of study,[8] which include such notable programs as nursing, liquid crystals, business, history, library science, aeronautics, journalism and fashion design.\n\nThe university was established in 1910 as the Kent State Normal School as a teacher-training school. The first classes were held in 1912 at various locations and in temporary buildings in Kent. Since then, the university has grown to include several additional baccalaureate and graduate programs of study in the arts and sciences, research opportunities, as well as over 1,000 acres (405 ha) and 119 buildings on the Kent campus. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the university was known internationally for its student activism in opposition to US involvement in the Vietnam war, due mainly to the events of May 4, 1970.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly history[]\n\nWhat would become Kent State University was established in 1910 as an institution for training public school teachers. It was part of the Lowry Bill which also created a sister school in Bowling Green, Ohio – now known as Bowling Green State University. It was initially known under the working name of the Ohio State Normal College At Kent,[9] but was named Kent State Normal School in 1911 in honor of William S. Kent (son of Kent, Ohio, namesake Marvin Kent), who donated the 53 acres (21 ha) used for the original campus. As such, it is the only public university in Ohio named for an individual.[10][dubious – discuss] The first president was John Edward McGilvrey, who served from 1912 to 1926.[11] McGilvrey had an ambitious vision for the school as a large university, instructing architect George F. Hammond, who designed the original campus buildings, to produce a master plan.[12] Classes began in 1912 before any buildings had been completed at the campus in Kent. These classes were held at extension centers in 25 cities around the region. By May 1913, classes were being held on the campus in Kent with the opening of Merrill Hall.[13] The school graduated 34 students in its first commencement on July 29, 1914. In 1915, the school was renamed Kent State Normal College[14] due to the addition of four-year degrees. By then additional buildings had been added or were under construction. Kent State's enrollment growth was particularly notable during its summer terms. In 1924, the school's registration for summer classes was the largest of any teacher-training school in the United States.[13] In 1929, the state of Ohio changed the name to Kent State College as it allowed the school to establish a college of arts and sciences.[15]\n\nMcGilvrey's vision for Kent was not shared by many others outside the school, particularly at the state level and at other state schools. His efforts to have the state funding formula changed created opposition, particularly from Ohio State University and its president William Oxley Thompson. This resulted in a 1923 \"credit war\" where Ohio State refused Kent transfer credits and spread to several other schools taking similar action. It was this development – along with several other factors – which led to the firing of McGilvrey in January 1926.[13] McGilvrey was succeeded first by David Allen Anderson (1926–1928) and James Ozro Engleman from 1928 to 1938, though he continued to be involved with the school for several years as president emeritus and as head of alumni relations from 1934 to 1945.[11] He was present in Columbus on May 17, 1935, when Kent native Governor Martin L. Davey signed a bill that allowed Kent State and Bowling Green to add schools of business administration and graduate programs, giving them each university status.[13]\n\n1940s-1960s[]\n\nBeginning in 1944, the University was led by President George Bowman, who led until 1963. During his tenure, the student senate, faculty senate and graduate council were organized. Although it had served Stark County from the 1920s, in 1946, the University's first regional campus, the Stark Campus, was established in Canton, Ohio. In the fall of 1947, Bowman appointed Oscar W. Ritchie as a full-time faculty member. Ritchie's appointment to the faculty made him the first African American to serve on the faculty at Kent State and also made him the first African American professor to serve on the faculty of any state university in Ohio. In 1977, the former Student Union, which had been built in 1949, was rededicated as Oscar Ritchie Hall in his honor.[16] Recently renovated, Oscar Ritchie Hall currently houses the department of Pan-African Studies the Center of Pan-African Culture, the Henry Dumas Library, the Institute for African American Affairs, the Garrett Morgan Computer Lab and the African Community Theatre.[17]\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s saw continued growth in both enrollment and in the physical size of the campus. Several new dorms and academic buildings were built during this time, including the establishment of additional regional campuses in Warren (1954), Ashtabula (1957), New Philadelphia (1962), Salem (1962), Burton (1964), and East Liverpool, Ohio (1965).[18] In 1961, grounds superintendent Larry Wooddell and Biff Staples of the Davey Tree Expert Company released ten cages of black squirrels obtained from Victoria Park in London, Ontario, Canada, onto the Kent State campus. By 1964 their estimated population was around 150 and today they have spread in and around Kent and have become unofficial mascots of both the city and university. Since 1981, the annual Black Squirrel Festival is held every fall on campus.[19][20]\n\nIn 1965, chemistry professor Glenn H. Brown established the Liquid Crystal Institute,[21] a world leader in the research and development the multibillion-dollar liquid crystal industry.[22] James Fergasen invented and patented the basic liquid crystal in the 1970s[23] and ten liquid crystal companies have been spun off from the Institute.[24]\n\nIn 1967, Kent State became the first university to run an independent, student-operated Campus Bus Service. It was unique in that it provided jobs for students, receiving funding from student fees rather than bus fares. Campus Bus Service was the largest such operation in the country until it merged with the Portage Area Regional Transportation Authority in 2004.[25] 1969 saw the opening of a new Memorial Stadium on the far eastern edge of campus and the closure and dismantling of the old Memorial Stadium.\n\nKent State shootings[]\n\nMain article: Kent State shootings\n\nKent State gained international attention on May 4, 1970, when an Ohio Army National Guard unit fired at students during an anti-war protest on campus, killing four and wounding nine. The Guard had been called into Kent after several protests in and around campus had become violent, including a riot in downtown Kent and the burning of the ROTC building. The main cause of the protests was the United States' invasion of Cambodia during the Vietnam War.[26] The shootings caused an immediate closure of the campus with students and faculty given just 60 minutes to pack belongings. Around the country, many college campuses canceled classes or closed for fear of similar violent protests.[27] In Kent, schools were closed and the National Guard restricted entry into the city limits, patrolling the area until May 8. With the campus closed, faculty members came up with a variety of solutions — including holding classes in their homes, at public buildings and places, via telephone, or through the mail — to allow their students to complete the term, which was only a few weeks away at the time.[28] In 1971, the University established the Center for Peaceful Change, now known as the Center for Applied Conflict Management, as a \"living memorial\" to the students who had died. It offers degree programs in Peace and Conflict Studies[29] and Conflict Resolution and is one of the earliest such programs in the United States.\n\n1970s-1980s[]\n\nAlso in 1970, the university opened its 12-story library, moving from the previous home of Rockwell Hall to the tallest building in Portage County.[30] Dedicated in 1971, the library became a member of the Association of Research Libraries in 1973.[31] Kent State joined with the University of Akron and Youngstown State University in establishing the Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine in 1973. It was the world's first medical consortium.[32] Today it includes a college of pharmacy and Cleveland State University as an additional consortium member.[33]\n\nKent State was again in the national spotlight in 1977 when construction was set to begin on the Memorial Gym Annex, adjacent to the area where the Kent State shootings had occurred in 1970. Protesters organized a tent city in May, which lasted into July. Several attempts were made to block construction even after the end of the tent city, including an appeal to the United States Congress and the Department of the Interior to have the area declared a National Historic Landmark, which ended up being unsuccessful. Additional rallies were held that year, including one attended by Joan Baez on August 20. After several additional unsuccessful legal challenges, construction finally began on September 19 and was finished in 1979.[34]\n\n1990s-Present[]\n\nIn March 1991, Kent State once again made history by appointing Carol Cartwright as president of the University, the first female to hold such a position at any state university in Ohio.[35] In 1994, Kent State was named a \"Research University II\" by the Carnegie Foundation. Today it is classified as a Doctoral/Research University-Extensive.[36][37] Beginning in the late 1990s, the University began a series of building renovations and construction, which included the complete renovation of the historic original campus,[38] the construction of several new dormitories, a student recreation center, and additional academic buildings on the Kent Campus and at the regional campuses.[39] In September 2010, the university announced its largest student body ever, with a total enrollment of 41,365.[40]\n\nCampuses[]\n\nKent State University is an eight-campus system in northeastern Ohio, with the main administrative center in Kent. Within the Kent State University system, the main campus is officially referred to as the \"Kent Campus\".[41] The Kent Campus is a landscaped suburban environment, covering approximately 866 acres (3.5 km2) which house over 100 buildings, gardens, bike trails, and open greenery. There are also thousands of additional acres of bogs, marshes, and wildlife refuges adjacent to or near the campus.[41] While the university's official mascot is Flash the Golden Eagle, the campus also has an unofficial mascot in the Black Squirrel, which were brought to Kent in 1961 and can be found on and around the campus. The campus is divided into North, South, and East sections but many areas have come to be referred to as Front Campus, Residential Campus, and Science Row. The main hub of activity and central point is the Student Center and Risman Plaza, which is adjacent to the twelve-story main library. The university also operates the 18-hole Kent State Golf Course and Centennial Research Park just east of campus in Franklin Township and the 219-acre (0.9 km2) Kent State University Airport in Stow.\n\nRegional campuses[]\n\nIn addition to the Kent Campus, there are seven regional campuses. The system is one of the largest and oldest regional campus systems in the United States. The regional campuses provide a small, liberal-arts college feel as opposed to the large university feel of the Kent Campus. Students at the regional campuses can begin any of Kent State's majors at their respective campus and each campus offers its own unique programs and opportunities that may or may not be available in Kent. Regional campuses include:\n\nAshtabula[]\n\nMain article: Kent State University Ashtabula Campus\n\nThe Ashtabula Campus is made up of three buildings: Main Hall, a library, and a technology and art building. It is on a 125-acre (0.51 km2) site along the shores of Lake Erie in Ashtabula, Ohio. Kent State-Ashtabula is noted locally for its nursing program. Seventy-five percent (75%) of registered nurses working in Ashtabula County graduated with an Associate's degree in nursing from Kent State-Ashtabula.

The facility is a state-of-the-art, 4,500-square-foot (420 m2) space and includes a 50-person lecture room, 12-station computer lab with instructor station, and a fashion design studio fully outfitted with professional equipment. The NYC studio gives Kent State students the advantage of working within the heart of the fashion, dance and theater industry.[47]\n\nCleveland Urban Design Center[]\n\nKent State's Cleveland Urban Design Center is located at 1309 Euclid Ave in downtown Cleveland's Theater District neighborhood, just off of East 14th Street. The Urban Design Center was created in 1983 under the sponsorship of the Urban University Program, which supports the outreach and community service efforts of Ohio's state universities working in urban areas. Under its founding director, Foster Armstrong, the Center expanded on the existing outreach and public service activities of Kent State's architecture school, focusing primarily on historic preservation and the problems of Northeast Ohio's smaller towns and cities. In 2003, the CUDC began a collaboration with the Dresden University of Technology, Kent State's sister university in Germany, with a joint vision on the revitalization of the lower Cuyahoga Valley in Cleveland.
