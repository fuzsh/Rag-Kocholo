        "text": "Kent woos state delegates\n\nSept. 27, 1910 - Kent aggressively pursues one of the normal schools. Although there are many missteps, the city seals the deal with the now infamous Bluegill Dinner.\n\nCity leaders score victory\n\nNov. 25, 1910 - The City of Kent beats out 20 other Northeast Ohio communities and lands one of the state schools. Kent Normal School is named after William Kent, who donates his farm land to build the new training school.\n\nGroundwork laid for Regional Campuses\n\n1912 - Ironically, Kent State's first classes are not in Kent. Extension classes are offered in more than 20 centers throughout Northeast Ohio. Some become the basis of Kent State's Regional Campus system.\n\nBegun, this 'credit war' has\n\n1923 - Ohio State launches a \"credit war,\" refusing to honor transfer credits from Kent State. The Ohio State president is upset over President McGilvrey's battle to get Kent State equal funding with southern schools (i.e. Ohio State and Ohio University) and his campaign to transform the normal college into a university.\n\nCluff Hall?\n\n1926 - What is now Franklin Hall was once the William A. Cluff Teacher Training School. Cluff, a Board of Trustees member, left the university under controversy. The building's pediment still bears his name.\n\nTransitioning from normal school\n\n1929 - The Ohio General Assembly approves the addition of colleges of liberal arts and the awarding of degrees in arts and sciences at Kent State. Kent State Normal College becomes Kent State College.\n\n'Bachelor Hall'\n\n1930s - \"Bachelor Hall\" houses up to 10 needy students during the Depression. The farmhouse is a remnant of the old Kent Farm and is eventually demolished for Terrace Hall, which, in turn, is torn down for a parking lot. One alumna waited tables at the Robin Hood for 15 cents an hour.\n\nLegislature's 'crazy' idea\n\nMay 4, 1934 - With falling state revenues, the Ohio House makes an expedition to Kent State to decide if it should turn the college into a hospital for the mentally ill. Massive protest from school and local officials scraps the idea.\n\nKent State becomes a university\n\n1935 - Gov. Martin L. Davey, who helped bring a normal school to Kent, signs a bill that adds a school of business administration and graduate programs to Kent State. With this, Kent State College becomes Kent State University. Former President John E. McGilvrey is present at the signing.\n\nMcGilvrey gets a hall\n\n1939 - McGilvrey Hall becomes the first new classroom building in 12 years. The Work Progress Administration project comes late due to President James O. Engleman's scorn for President Roosevelt's New Deal.\n\nKent State enters WWII\n\n1940-1943 - Enrollment drops from 2,707 in 1940 to 777 in 1943 as students head to war. The faculty population goes from 131 in 1941 to 92 in 1943.\n\nWar affects campus life\n\n1942 - Varsity football is suspended after the 1942 season. A howitzer that stands on North campus as a memorial to the World War I dead is donated in a scrap metal drive.\n\nUniversity plans for war's end\n\n1944 - A university committee plans for the postwar boom. Indeed, this boom would come from rapid growth in student population and buildings, shifting the center of campus eastward over the course of 30 years.\n\nRitchie makes history\n\n1947 - Upon joining the Department of Sociology, alumnus Dr. Oscar Ritchie becomes the first African-American appointed to a faculty position at any state university in Ohio.\n\nStudent Union opens\n\n1949 - The Student Union opens its doors to students, offering pool tables, a bowling alley, cafeterias, lounges, a book store and a faculty dining room. The building is later renamed in Dr. Ritchie's honor.\n\n'Atomic Era' classes\n\n1950s - The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II ushers in the Atomic Age. \"Great Atomic Issues\" courses grapple with the ability of humanity to control physical forces for great destruction.\n\nWKSU signs on\n\n1950 - The Federal Communications Commission grants Kent State a construction permit for WKSU-FM, which signs on the air for five hours a day at 10 watts and a frequency of 88.7.\n\nArch marks campus growth\n\nThe class of 1956 donates the Terrace Arch at Terrace Drive, once the center of campus. As Kent State grows, activity shifts eastward toward the Kent Student Center and Library.\n\nMcGruder's firsts\n\n1963 - Robert McGruder, the first black editor at the Daily Kent Stater, graduates. During his career, he works at newspapers in Dayton, Detroit, Akron and Cleveland, where he becomes the first black reporter. He earns the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1984 and passes away from cancer in 2002.\n\nTragedy strikes\n\nMay 4, 1970 - Four Kent State students are killed and nine wounded during a demonstration protesting the U.S. invasion of Cambodia. The Center for Peaceful Change, now the Center for Applied Conflict Management, is established a year later as a living memorial to the students.\n\nPorthouse opens for performance\n\n1971 - Porthouse Theatre opens during the summer of 1971. Initially the theatre at Blossom Music Center in Cuyahoga Falls features student productions but becomes a professional repertory company during the mid-1980s.\n\nUniversity School closes\n\n1982 - The University School, a teachers' training school for many years, closes. Several years later, the building reopens as the Schwartz Center.\n\nMoving on out\n\n1988 - President Michael Schwartz moves into a new off-campus home. The historical Curtiss House, the official residence of presidents since the 1940s, begins its transformation into Williamson Alumni Center.\n\nFashionable school\n\n1983 - Shannon Rodgers and Jerry Silverman examine a piece from the Chinese collection modeled by Debbie Kister. Silverman and Rogers are the founding fathers of the School of Fashion Design and Merchandising and the Kent State University Museum.\n\nHigh honor achieved\n\n1994 - Kent State joins the ranks of the nation's top institutions of higher learning when it receives a Research University II designation from the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.\n\nRegional Academic Center Opens\n\n2012 - The university opens the state-of-the-art Regional Academic Center in Twinsburg, Ohio, making a college education more accessible to the citizens of Northeast Ohio.\n\nCollege of Podiatric Medicine Acquired\n\n2012 - The university establishes the Kent State University College of Podiatric Medicine in a friendly acquisition of Ohio's only podiatric medicine college. It is one of just nine accredited colleges of podiatric medicine nationwide.\n\nMajor Expansion Underway\n\n2012 - The university embarks on a historic, physical transformation of the flagship Kent Campus known as \"Foundation of Excellence: Building the Future.\" The major, multi-faceted initiative comprises new buildings and revitalized classroom, laboratory, studio, performing, living and studying spaces.\n\nMay 4 Visitors Center Opens\n\n2013 - The university opened a world-class, multimedia May 4 Visitors Center that places the events of May 4, 1970, in historical, political and social context.\n\nRising Town\n\n2013 - With the addition of a world-class hotel and conference center; new options for living, dining, shopping and parking; and with a scenic walkway that connects the city of Kent and the Kent Campus for the first time, Kent has earned a reputation as a rising college town â one of America's most vibrant and attractive destinations for students, visitors, businesses and area residents alike.\n\nWarren Named New President\n\n2014 - Beverly J. Warren, Ed.D., Ph.D., FACSM is named as the university's 12th president. Dr. Warren brings more than 25 years experience in higher education leadership.\n\nWhat's in a name?\n\nA look at where various campus buildings got their names .\n\nPart of the Kent community\n\nTake a look at the history of the city of Kent , home to Kent State University.
