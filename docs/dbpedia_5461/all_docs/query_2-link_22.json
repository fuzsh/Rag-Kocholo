Two friends, one, recently-turned landlord (Mike Good, vocals, rhythm guitar) and the other, recently-turned tenant of the house next door (Nathan Sterley, bass) decided one ethanol-tinged day that a Velvet Underground cover band might be something to unleash upon the townsfolk. Anyway, the Velvet Underground cover thing didn't last long. Some Stooges got thrown into the mix. Then some Townes Van Zandt. Kinks. Stones. Howlin' Wolf. Frank Black. Then Mike started ad-libbing songs about vegetarian drummers and a pawn shop chicken foot of dubious powers. Calamine Lotion was dead, and The Tenants kept rollin' on from that point. Donald Alan (also another literal tenant of the singer's for a time and the lead guitarist) got conscripted into the band at a local jam night after what may have been a few too many oat sodas. On drums, Joe Kidd of Simeon Soul Charger and Gruff at the Buzzer fame is the most recent addition to the band, following the departure of founding member, the original high hat-less badass, Hanger. The sound might be described as \"twangy-folky-bluesy-rock that occasionally gets a little fuzzy.\"\n\nThe members of The Tenants currently all reside in or right next to Akron, Ohio.\n\nRye Valley\n\nRye Valley is an Americana band from Northeast Ohio. Founding members Brett Auerbach and Landon Kearns met at an iconic NEOH open mic hosted at the Silver Swan Tavern. After nearly a decade of casual collaboration, Auerbach and Kearns joined forces in 2021 to create Rye Valley. Rye Valley showcases Auerbach’s original songwriting and Kearns talented multi-instrumentalism. They released their first EP in 2023 titled “Greetings from Rye Valley”. Additionally, Rye Valley released a live recorded album in 2023 titled “Rye Valley Live at Plastic Dino Records”. In Spring of 2024, Rye Valley dropped their first full length studio album with producer Tuck Mindrum titled “Miss River”. Many guest appearances are on the album including Tyler Lobdell (Ray), Jono Yowell, Erik Diaz, Jen Maurer, and Leigh Ann Merrill.\n\nJames McKeiver and The Starry Sky Band\n\nAn original folk-rock group out of Cleveland, Ohio steeped in the roots of American music. James (acoustic, vocals) has released 5 full length records, the last 3, starting in 2020 with Hills & Dreams, features his backing band the Starry Sky Band - Jay Kuebler (drums), Gary Heinrich Jr (electric guitar), Darren Hamm (bass). The band brings an energetic show that oscillates between country, folk, and rock & roll. Their latest release - The Storm Rages On was voted a top 10 record of the year for 2023 by the podcast Music Talks.\n\nGet to the show early for dinner and drinks from Paninoteca - open in The Rialto Living Room at 5pm!\n\nDoors: 7:00PM / Showtime: 7:30PM\n\nPurchase your tickets here!\n\nRSVP on Facebook!\n\nView Event →\n\nBrian Revels in The Rialto Living Room\n\nBrian Revels\n\nBrian Revels is energy and angst in a comet trail of music that is as perceptive as it is entertaining. His observations of Americana ring with authenticity. The new single from his band, Brian Revels & the Heat Lightning, \"All the Gold\" is an all-too-relatable ballad about being broke and in love; a love story wrapped in millennial dread. This 2nd release from the upcoming LP shows the maturation of a songwriter and band catching their stride. Brian Revels has spent 2 years building a family in upstate NY, nurturing a newfound sobriety, and the bandhas never sounded better.\n\nRevels is a wily veteran of the Atlanta, Georgia music scene, a multi-instrumentalist, and a natural-born storyteller with a poetic edge. Before forming his current ensemble, The Heat Lightning, he helped to build the folk trio, City Mouse, into a regional force, sharing stages with acts like The Steeldrivers, Parker Milsap, The Whiskey Gentry, and Faye Webster.\n\nBrian Revels & The Heat Lightning made their streaming debut on 2020’s “Jasper County Blues” which Immersive Atlanta called “a collection of stories set between the opening of saloon doors and the desperation of last call.”\n\nRevels draws from folk and blues and country and bluegrass, is an alternative to them all and a better man for their influences. The hole he’s worn in his guitar is not as large as the one he’s worn in his heart with the care of the lives he hopes he can redeem one song at a time. His timeless musicality will touch your soul with the drama, and the significance, of love lost and regained, of the human frailty that reduces and yet ennobles each of us.\n\nShowtime: 5:00 PM\n\nRSVP on Facebook!\n\nView Event →\n\nCLIFFS / SEA OF GHOSTS / COLLIDEASCOPE - 8/31/24\n\nCLIFFS\n\nSea of Ghosts\n\nCollideascope\n\nCollideascope, an Akron-area band that plays original music, is back!

An up-close-and-personal evening with Brian Lisik and Jeremy Porter, two of the Midwest’s finest rock-n-roll frontmen, as they strip down their songs and tell the stories behind them. Chances are nothing will get broken…but hey, ya never know.\n\nThis show also marks the kickoff of Lisik and Porter’s Solo Together fall tour, with stops scheduled throughout Ohio and Michigan.\n\nJeremy Porter is a Detroit, Michigan-based guitarist, singer/songwriter, and producer. He’s best known for fronting his Detroit Rock and Roll band Jeremy Porter and The Tucos, and touring solo-acoustic between Tucos’ album cycles.\n\nJP&T have toured the US, Canada, and the UK extensively, released four albums, and opened for the likes of everyone from Soul Asylum, Cracker, and American Aquarium to Lydia Loveless, Supersuckers, and Jesse Malin.\n\nAs a solo-artist, Jeremy strips his songs down to the bone, with an acoustic guitar and a voice, which lends itself perfectly to listening rooms, breweries, dive-bars, music-friendly grills, and small theatres. He’s played `em all and then some, balancing the entertainment/audience aspect with the craft of songwriting and performance, adjusting as he goes to fit the mood of the room.\n\nBrian Lisik conjured the ghosts of its collective musical past while making his latest studio album, appropriately dubbed Nu Wreckard. The short, smart, snotty and irreverent seven-song collection traverses an ocean of genres – from raw ‘50s rock and 90s grunge to campy ‘70s TV cop show sounds and features appearances by Lisik’s long-time bassist, vocalist and songwriting partner Steve Norgrove, saxophonist Ian Early (Cherry Poppin’ Daddies), and Akron rock legends The Bizarros.\n\nThe album follows Brian Lisik & Hard Legs’ 2022 release, the intentionally unvarnished live album Hotsy Totsy! American Songwriter placed “Monk,” a searingly profane non-single from that album, among its Top 24 songs of the year. Hotsy Totsy! was also named one of the Canton Repository’s “Best of 2022” releases.\n\nLisik has shared the stage with artists including Tim Easton, Waylon Payne, Wade Bowen, Ass Ponys, Jesse Malin, Chris Knight, Tommy Womack, Nicole Atkins, Patrick Sweany, Two Cow Garage, The Chamber Strings, Eddie Money, and Roger McGuinn.\n\nNo Depression called Lisik’s music “a winning formula of catchy phrasing, jangly guitar riffs and great pop hooks.” The Seattle Post Intelligencer said the songs make “A rough and tumble garage-y sound…soaked deep in an ocean of chunky guitars.” Music writer Lee Zimmerman said “Lisik writes songs that resonate almost immediately…sharp, smart and full of edgy intensity…bold, assertive and flush with full tilt rock ‘n’ roll.”\n\nhttps://brianlisik.com/\n\nhttps://www.thetucos.com/\n\nThe Rialto Living Room opens at 5pm!\n\nDoors: 7:00PM / Showtime: 7:30PM\n\nPurchase your tickets here!\n\nRSVP on Facebook!\n\nView Event →\n\nLee Miller Matsos EP Release Party/Chrissy Strong/Dustin Mayle in The Rialto Living Room\n\nLee Miller Matsos\n\nLee Miller Matsos is an opera and musical theater performer turned pop rock artist.

Her voice has a pungency that is part punk, part folk, part bluesy nightclub singer. Drawing upon roots rock, blues and folk, she tackles social issues, \"slices of life\" and of course, matters of the heart. Her unique style is anything but passive --reaching out and grabbing the listener by the ear and never letting go. She released her 3rd CD in 2023, Starz on the Water featuring the song \"Underground Winter Blues,\" which made the top 20 blues songs of 2023 on Y-103. \"Show Me\" and \"Jo and Ed's, Bar\" also from the CD will be released this Fall by Diamond Country Records of Nashville. An older version of \"Right Love Wrong Time\" from the CD was released by Canadian indie label RotoNoto. Her \"true story\" single, \"Don't Cry For Me,\" which details the life and times of a Vietnam Veteran, was also released earlier on Bastards of Protocol Records. Ms Wojnar is also a poet who has just published White Darkness: Poetic Tales of the Schizophrenic Experience, a collection of vivid, gut wrenching poetry based on 23 years experience of coping with Schizophrenia. She is active in the fight against stigma from mental health issues and in raising awareness of the realities of mental health and recovery. She has been regularly giving readings and presentations since the book was published in late 2023. Susan resides happily in Youngstown, Oh with her dear cat, Tia.\n\nMichael Sean McDonald\n\nCleveland songwriter Michael Sean McDonald’s music is filled with toe-tapping blues and heartfelt ballads that cover the full spectrum of the human experience.

Their music has also been played as promos, intros & outros on local internet radio.\n\nGoJo\n\nThe idea for the GoJo Band was hatched by Gordon Garrett and Joe Grace, so the name is a portmanteau of their first names. It's also shorter than \"Four IT guys and an Undertaker\", which is what they are.

All five are life-long musicians with varied musical backgrounds who bring their experiences together to make a joyful noise.\n\nGordon Garrett, bass player, has studied the instrument at the post-secondary level and toured in bands earlier in his career. His smooth and soulful proficiency helps form the backbone of the band. Gordon is often quoted saying, \"Music is the Language of the Soul\"!\n\nJoe Grace plays keyboards, sax, and sings.

He also appreciates many styles of music and the manner in which music is woven into the most vital aspects of our lives. He leads a dynamic worship team on Sunday mornings.

Drums are his original instrument, but he started to play guitar later in life and has loved it ever since. He and Joe initially performed together at an open mic event while on a business trip together in Virginia.\n\nBrian Eger, drummer and percussion, has been fascinated with the instrument(s) since hearing Wipeout as a lad. He has also played in a broad spectrum of music styles including reggae, alternative folk, and psychedelic blues rock.

It laid dormant for years until covid forced me to come to grips with my mortality and pursue the dreams I had as a child. I play a mix of covers, that I bend to fit me, with a few original songs peppered throughout sets. I dabble in disappointment, regret, and time lost as themes, for my original music. But i also have a goofy song about my cat, to help rise out of the darkness.

Evoking elements of '90s era grunge on songs such as Dark Day and Get By along with the straightforward early '50s Country sound of the title track, Sing When I'm Down and Tomorrow's too Soon, Doug draws inspiration from a wide range of song writers.\n\nRun Thomas Run\n\nGet to the show early for dinner and drinks from Paninoteca - open in The Rialto Living Room at 5pm!\n\nDoors: 7:00PM / Showtime: 7:30PM\n\nPurchase your tickets here!\n\nRSVP on Facebook!\n\nView Event →\n\nZach Hamlin in The Rialto Living Room\n\nZach Hamlin\n\nZach Hamlin is a local singer/songwriter with folk in his heart.

His music seamlessly melds contemporary pop sensibilities with the timeless allure of arena rock reminiscent of the golden eras of the 70s and 80s, resulting in a deeply resonant sound.\n\nCaleb Kopta draws inspiration from the giants of Rock and Roll who paved the way, channeling their influence into his own unique voice within the modern alternative rock scene. His compositions are a tapestry of honest, heartfelt lyrics, dynamic guitar craftsmanship, and an unwavering ambition to craft the perfect accompaniment to life's everyday stories.\n\nCaleb's passion for music has been a constant companion since his earliest memories. His journey, from attending concerts at a mere two months old to sharing stages with esteemed acts such as White Reaper, Punchline, Michigander, and Parachute, has been dedicated to forging resonant music that leaves a profound impact.\n\nEarning comparisons to iconic figures like The Killers, Bruce Springsteen, and Bleachers, Kopta effortlessly blends elements of Rock, New Wave, and Singer/Songwriter genres. His compositions feature robust, anthemic choruses that live within the intimate narratives they enfold.\n\nUnfazed by the geographical boundaries of his performances or the sonic territories he explores, Caleb Kopta epitomizes unwavering consistency. His dedication knows no bounds, epitomizing the very essence of Rock and Roll - a passionate creation that strikes a chord deep within.\n\nHaving garnered an impressive quarter of a million online streams, Caleb Kopta is poised to unveil his highly anticipated sophomore EP in the vibrant bloom of 2024, marking a pivotal chapter in his musical journey.\n\nMarcus Fakler\n\nI am an Akron-based musician who spent seven years writing and performing in Nashville in the mid to late 2010s. My musical evolution in that space culminated in the release of my self-produced album, Who Knows. It is a genre-bending work that explores tangled themes such as life's meaning, religion, mortality, and starting anew.\n\nOnce I closed the door on my Nashville life, I embarked on a new adventure through the Peace Corps in Senegal, where I pursued a different tone of life away from the chaos of self-definition. I met new people, explored new cultures, learned new languages, and reveled in the difficulty of the “here and now”.\n\nOnce I got back I continued to explore and create music with sound engineer and producer Nick Bullock, resulting in the album A Slight and Subtle Bending. This collection featured original songs and covers from some of my favorite bands and a pivot to a more traditionally indie sound.\n\nDespite my focus on music I also found fulfillment in a variety of other pursuits such as WWOOFing, construction work, and gardening. These experiences sparked questions about creativity and creation which lead me to draw inspiration for my new album, A Feeling of Once in a Lifetime.\n\nA Feeling of Once in a Lifetime is a meditation on inspiration, new relationships, and an artist’s relationship to creativity while trying to build a “normal life”. I explored my ebbs and flows and the ways in which I can be creative in a society where I must also make a living.\n\nChad Frey\n\nCelebrating 20 years of recording from his latest release AI : Acapellas & Instrumentals released on November 24 2023.

Brenden wanted to make ska, Jacob wanted to make new age music, so they combined forces to make neither. Mary Riley joined the band for the upcoming album Goldline my Coffin, in order to scream about the things that make a middle aged suburban woman angry.\n\nDeco Danger, released on June 30, 2023, is the third album by Phantom Lease. This collection of music was exclusively composed for an arcade game that had a fleeting existence of just one week. This ephemeral gem was showcased at an aluminum can exhibition in 2019.\n\nMemories of Happier and Less Complicated Times explores the world of fish and chips. It was released on June 30, 2022, the fiftieth anniversary of the final Arthur Treacher's Fish & Chips restaurant and first anniversary of Arthur Treacher's day in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. The title Memories of Happier and Less Complicated Times is taken from a quote by the owner of the restaurant. Due to the cultural impact of the album, Arthur Treacher's was able to open a second location in Ohio.\n\nThe album Home chronicles two evangelical grifters who conned Phantom Lease into writing music for their line of promotional videos about healthy eating. The album was governed by only two rules: songs should be a minute long and include a nylon string guitar part. Home was released on November 19, 2021.\n\nhttps://www.phantomlease.com/\n\nGOODMORNING VALENTINE\n\nIt was winter. Six Parts Seven had returned to Ohio after touring out to Washington State, to record \"Casually Smashed to Pieces.\"\n\nThere was down time between the recording and the actual release of that album in January 2007, and we were rehearsing, playing local shows, and collaborating, with most of us involved in other projects to keep the momentum going (Mike w/ Talons, Al w/ Beaten Awake), but the one we all came together over was recording an album with Joey Beltram, the songwriter behind Goodmorning Valentine, a local band we shared players with, a band we deeply admired.\n\nThe music on Kissing Distance came together over two weekend days. There were a lot of people around; 6P7 and GMV players coming and going from the Saint Ledger House. There were handles of whiskey, there was weed, stacks of Marlboro Reds for the ones still dragging butts. We all went 'dancing' at Thursday's, in Akron, Ohio, on Saturday night. Not sure how we were productive the following day. Chalk that one up to relative youth. Over those two days, songs were cut without any prior rehearsal time. None of us remember how the idea came up. In hindsight, it seems inevitable.\n\n\"Drunk from the Bottle,\" is the first of the one-take/one mic songs: an SM58 used for both vocal and guitar, making it impossible to over-think anything: You got the version, or you did not, that simple.\n\nHORSES 4K\n\nPlaying cowboy screensavers from the Pentium 2 era.\n\nPaninoteca will be closed this week! But The Living Room and Bar will be open for early cocktails!\n\nDoors: 7:00PM / Showtime: 7:30PM\n\nPurchase your tickets here!\n\nRSVP on Facebook!\n\nView Event →\n\nDOME TEST / ANNADALE / 1402 - 07/25/24\n\nDome Test\n\nAnnadale\n\n1402\n\nGet to the show early for dinner and drinks from Paninoteca - open in The Rialto Living Room at 5pm!\n\nDoors: 7:00PM / Showtime: 7:30PM\n\nPurchase your tickets here!\n\nRSVP on Facebook!\n\nView Event →\n\nSam Curfman in The Rialto Living Room\n\nSam Curfman\n\nSam Curfman is a prolific songwriter who has been active in Akron and Kent for more than ten years, performing both solo and with his band, Blue Radio.
