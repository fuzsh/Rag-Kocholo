Holding over $750 Billion in U.S. debt, China has become increasingly concerned that the American economy has become, “A basket case,” prompting Beijing officials to make the proactive decision to exchange their financial exposure for some media exposure.\n\nBased on early information from the China Cabinet (which is seldom used and mostly for show), the new event will be rebranded the “Far Easter Egg Hunt” and will feature traditional Chinese events including the Egg Roll, Spring Roll, and the recently unveiled Egg Drop…\n\nRead more from Soundbite Laureate Douglas O’Bryon here\n\nThis week’s most active post on BrewedFreshDaily.com\n\nEd Morrison explains “Some years ago, I was told by a reliable source, an advocate for greater collaboration among libraries had to return money to the local foundations. Nobody wanted to start a conversation on collaboration. Those days, hopefully, are coming to an end since East Cleveland library may team up with the Cuyahoga County system.” BFD readers comment:\n\nWell, there is actually a lot of collaboration going on between libraries – namely, the CLEVNET consortium, which allows 30 library systems across 9 counties in Northern Ohio to share resources (i.e., books and audiovisual media) while at the same time allowing them to preserve their own local character. There is not really anything quite like our particular flavor of library collaboration anywhere else in the country. comment by Christine Borne\n\nWhat’s the next level of collaboration? Why is the County not part of CLEVENET? This is all pretty confusing to me. comment by Ed Morrison\n\nRead and add your comment on the BFD post Library Collaboration\n\nGot a Handle on Your Carbon Footprint?\n\nThe Cleveland Carbon Fund Wants You\n\nThere’s nothing like a little guilt to force you into action.

Disparaging a person is also a tactic used by those harboring feelings of inferiority.\n\nThe easiest way to for a small-minded, insecure person to make themselves feel equal to someone who might be more successful, or seems to have a richer, fuller life, is to say something negative about the person… and the more negative, the better.\n\nIn the Black community, which is more rampantly homophobic than most, the simplest, and most direct way to accomplish this is by whispering that the person is gay — or perhaps more pejoratively, “a fag”…\n\nRead more from Mansfield B.
