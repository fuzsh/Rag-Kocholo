        "text": "Beacon Journal popular culture writer\n\nFor your recreational planning purposes …\n\nAkron returns. The independent film Akron, which was shown at the Cleveland International Film Festival, will be shown at the Nightlight at 7:30 p.m. Sept. 11 and 7 p.m. Sept. 12. Director Brian O’Donnell, a graduate of Walsh Jesuit High School, will also have a Q&A after each showing.\n\nMade in Akron and Wayne County, the film involves Benny Cruz (played by Matthew Frias) and Christopher Welling (Edmund Donovan), University of Akron students who fall for each other. What they do not know at first is that their families are connected by a long-ago tragedy. When that comes to the surface, their relationship changes.\n\nO’Donnell told me before the CIFF showings that he chose the title because “it was clear that the story was based in Akron. They were at the University of Akron, they lived in the suburbs of Akron. Other titles were maybe too poetic or maybe too leading, or too bland. They also tended to present only one aspect of what the film actually is. …\n\n“Akron seemed best to me, rooting it in a location in the Midwest, with a progressive storyline. It helps to let people know … a concept of Akron representing America, representing where we are now. How viewpoints and relationships have changed.”\n\nAdditional showings are possible, depending on the pre-sales for these.\n\n•\n\nBack to Ohio. Among those on media row during the Republican convention in Cleveland was Tom Ashbrook, host of NPR’s On Point. He’ll be back in the area on Sept. 15 to record an installment of On Point at Kent State University’s KIVA at 7 p.m. (The show will air the following morning.)\n\nAccording to WKSU (89.7-FM), which is hosting the program, the audience will be encouraged to participate in the discussion, which will focus on the younger generation and politics. Kent State students will be able to get in free. Other folks will have to pay $43.19, although that includes “an exclusive pre-show meet and greet” with Ashbrook, On Point staff and WKSU hosts. Also, hors d’oeuvres.\n\nYou can find more information and a link for tickets at wksu.org, in the Events tab.\n\n•\n\nTalking books. Two poets, a music critic and a best-selling social commentator make up the Main Event Speaker Series at the Akron-Summit County Public Library’s speaker series this fall in the main library.\n\nIt starts with “An Evening With Sarah Vowell” on Sept. 15. Vowell’s works include Lafayette in the Somewhat United States and Assassination Vacation.\n\nFollowing her is Rolling Stone columnist Rob Sheffield on Sept. 29; his latest book, Dreaming the Beatles: The Love Story of One Band and the Whole World, arrives on Oct. 25. Then there’s Billy Collins, the former U.S. poet laureate, on Oct. 15, and poet Jamaal May (The Big Book of Exit Strategies) on Nov. 2.\n\nAll talks are at 7 p.m., with free admission.\n\n•\n\nMore Moore. Dolemite, the cult film starring former Cleveland and Akron resident Rudy Ray Moore, will get a couple of showings on Aug. 6 at Cleveland’s Cedar Lee. At 9:30 p.m. or 11:59 p.m. you can see this tale of a Los Angeles pimp, his “all girl army of kung fu killers” and his battle with a gangster. Moore, a comedian who inspired both comics and rappers, died in 2008.\n\n•\n\nClassics change. On Monday, VH1 Classic will be rebranded MTV Classic and will focus on vintage programming from the older channel. At 6 a.m., MTV Classic will air the first hour from MTV’s debut in 1981, then offer a lineup including such shows as Daria and Beavis & Butthead, and pieces from Total Request Live."
