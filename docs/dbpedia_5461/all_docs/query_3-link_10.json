Last fall, WKSU and Ideastream Public Media announced plans to join forces to expand coverage for the region. Those plans will take effect at the end of March and will mean a change for listeners who currently get their NPR programming from WCPN in Cleveland. WCLV, Cleveland’s home for classical music, also will be affected and will be moving to a new location on the dial. As of March 28, those who currently listen to WCPN 90.3 FM will be able to find their favorite news, reporters, programs and NPR coverage at WKSU 89.7 FM, as well as on 104.9 FM and the network of stations that carry WKSU including 89.1 Thompson, 89.3 Wooster, 90.7 Norwalk, 91.5 New Philadelphia, 94.7 Mansfield and 95.7 Ashland. WCLV, Ideastream Public Media’s classical service, will move from 104.9 FM to 90.3 FM beginning March 28. This change will extend classical music to approximately 1 million additional listeners.
