        "text": "American technology company\n\nAnsys, Inc. is an American multinational company with its headquarters based in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. It develops and markets CAE/multiphysics engineering simulation software for product design, testing and operation and offers its products and services to customers worldwide.\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nOrigins[edit]\n\nAnsys was founded in 1970 as Swanson Analysis Systems, Inc. (SASI) by John Swanson. The idea for Ansys was first conceived by Swanson while working at the Westinghouse Astronuclear Laboratory in the 1960s.[2] At the time, engineers performed finite element analysis (FEA) by hand.[2] Westinghouse rejected Swanson's idea to automate FEA by developing general purpose engineering software, so Swanson left the company in 1969 to develop the software on his own.[2] He founded SASI the next year, working out of his farmhouse in Pittsburgh.[3][4]\n\nSwanson developed the initial ANSYS software on punch cards and used a mainframe computer that was rented by the hour.[2] Westinghouse hired him as a consultant, under the condition that any code he developed for Westinghouse could also be included in the Ansys product line.[3] Westinghouse became the first Ansys user.[3]\n\nSwanson sold his interest in the company to venture capitalists in 1994, and the company was renamed \"Ansys\" after the software. Ansys went public on NASDAQ in 1996. In the 2000s, the company acquired other engineering design companies, obtaining additional technology for fluid dynamics, electronics design, and physics analysis. Ansys became a component of the NASDAQ-100 index on December 23, 2019.[5]\n\nGrowth[edit]\n\nBy 1991, SASI had 153 employees and $29 million in annual revenue,[6] controlling 10 percent of the market for finite element analysis software.[6] According to The Engineering Design Revolution, the company became \"well-respected\" among engineering circles, but remained small.[7] In 1992, SASI acquired Compuflo, which marketed and developed fluid dynamics analysis software.[7] In 1994, Swanson sold his majority interest in the company to venture capitalist firm TA Associates.[3][6] Peter Smith was appointed CEO[7] and SASI was renamed after the software, Ansys, the following year.[3][6]\n\nAnsys went public in 1996, raising about $46 million in an initial public offering.[7] By 1997, Ansys had grown to $50.5 million in annual revenue.[8] In the late 1990s, Ansys shifted its business model[7] away from software licenses, and corresponding revenue declined.[7] However, revenue from services increased.[7] From 1996 to 2000, profits at Ansys grew an average of 160% per year.[6] In February 2000, Jim Cashman was appointed CEO.[7]\n\nCurrent CEO Ajei S. Gopal was appointed in early 2017.[9][10] In November 2020, South China Morning Post reported that Ansys software had been used for Chinese military research in the development of hypersonic missile technology.[11] In October 2022, Washington Post reviewed procurement documents and confirmed that Ansys technology had been acquired by seven Chinese entities present on either the export blacklist or with known links to Chinese missile technology.[12] Ansys said that it and its subsidiaries have no records of the indicated sales or shipments and suggested that piracy may have been involved.[12] In January 2024 Synopsys and Ansys announced a definitive agreement under which Synopsys would acquire Ansys in a deal valued at around $35 billion.[13][14]\n\nList of acquisitions[edit]\n\nYear announced Company Business Value (USD) References 1999 Centric Engineering Systems Fluid, structural, and thermal analysis Not disclosed [6] 2000 ICEM CFD Engineering Mesh simulations $12.4 million [6][15] 2001 Cadoe Computer-aided design Not disclosed [3][6][15] 2003 CFX Fluid dynamics simulation Not disclosed [6] 2005 Century Dynamics Hydrodynamics simulation tools $5 million [6] 2005 Harvard Thermal Inc.

Ansys also released its Probabilistic Design System and DesignXplorer software products, which both deal with probabilities and randomness of physical elements.[49] In 2009 version 12 was released with an overhauled second version of Workbench.[15][50] Ansys also began increasingly consolidating features into the Workbench software.[45]\n\nVersion 15 of Ansys was released in 2014.[45] It added a new features for composites, bolted connections, and better mesh tools.[45] In February 2015, version 16 introduced the AIM physics engine and Electronics Desktop, which is for semiconductor design.[51] The following year, version 17 introduced a new user interface and performance improvement for computing fluid dynamics problems.[52] In January 2017, Ansys released version 18.[53] Version 18 allowed users to collect real-world data from products and then incorporate that data into future simulations.[53] The Ansys Application Builder, which allows engineers to build, use, and sell custom engineering tools, was also introduced with version 18.[53]\n\nReleased in January 2020, Ansys R1 2020 updates Ansys' simulation process and data management (SPDM), materials information and electromagnetics product offerings.[54] In early 2020, the Ansys Academic Program surpassed one million student downloads.[55]\n\nIn May 2020, Ansys joined Microsoft, Dell and Lendlease on the steering committee of the Digital Twin Consortium, which aims to advance the use of digital twin technology.[56] The company collaborated with the US Army and L3Harris to advance the use of FACE technical standard.[57] In April, 2020, Samsung Foundry certified Ansys' RaptorH EM simulation solution for developing 2.5D/3D-ICs and systems-on-chip using Samsung's signoff flow.[58] In August, 2020, Ansys received TSMC certification for its SoIC 3D chip stacking technology.[59] In October, 2020, the company signed the agreement to acquire Analytical Graphics Inc. for $700 million.[60]\n\nIn 2021, Optimo Medical AG integrated their Optimeyes digital twin technology with Ansys Mechanical to create identical copies of cornea for surgical procedure testing purposes.[61] Ansys and Siemens Energy collaborated to improve additive manufacturing (AM) processes.[62] In May 2021, Ansys acquired Phoenix Integration, Inc. for an undisclosed amount.[39]\n\nIn November, 2021, the company was certified for Samsung's 3 nm and 4 nm Process Technologies.[63] The same year, Ansys acquired Zemax for an undisclosed amount.[40] The company began supporting Arm-based Graviton2 Processors, first time that Ansys' EDA semiconductor simulation solutions were made available on the Arm Neoverse architecture.[64] In partnership with Cornell University, Ansys developed simulating courses.[65]\n\nIn March 2022, the company announced collaboration with GlobalFoundries to address issues facing data centres.[66] In April, 2022, Ansys announced signing a definitive agreement to acquire OnScale to expand its cloud portfolio.[67]\n\nIn May, 2022, Ansys acquired Motor Design Limited (MDL) for an undisclosed amount.[41] In October, 2022, the company acquired C&R Technologies, a company that specialised in providing orbital thermal analysis.[43]\n\nIn December, 2022, Ansys announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire DYNAmore, which specialises in developing simulation solutions for the automotive industry.[44]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n[edit]"
