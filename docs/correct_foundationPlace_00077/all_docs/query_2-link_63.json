One tool that is being developed in industry for exclusion zone determination and LNG vapor dispersion modeling is computational fluid dynamics (CFD). This paper uses the ANSYS CFX CFD code to model LNG vapor dispersion in the atmosphere. Discussed are important parameters that are essential inputs to the ANSYS CFX simulations, including the atmospheric conditions, LNG evaporation rate and pool area, turbulence in the source term, ground surface temperature and roughness height, and effects of obstacles. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to illustrate uncertainties in the simulation results arising from the mesh size and source term turbulence intensity. In addition, a set of medium-scale LNG spill tests were performed at the Brayton Fire Training Field to collect data for validating the ANSYS CFX prediction results. A comparison of test data with simulation results demonstrated that CFX was able to describe the dense gas behavior of LNG vapor cloud, and its prediction results of downwind gas concentrations close to ground level were in approximate agreement with the test data.

The cylinder is treated as a rigid body and transverse displacements are obtained by use of a one degree of freedom spring damper system. 2-D as well as 3-D analysis is performed using air as the fluid. Reynolds number is varied from 40 to 16000 approx., covering the laminar and turbulent regimes of flow. The experimental results of (Khalak and Williamson, 1997) and other researchers are used for validation purposes.

For this purpose we have developed models of the fuel assembly of the VVER-440 reactor using the ANSYS CFX 10.0 CFD code. At first a 240 mm long part of a 60 degrees segment of the fuel pin bundle was modelled. Implementing this model a sensitivity study on the appropriate meshing was performed. Based on the development of the above described model, further models were developed: a 960moreÂ Â» mm long part of a 60-degree-segment and a full length part (2420 mm) of the fuel pin bundle segment. The calculations were run using constant coolant properties and several turbulence models. The impacts of choosing different turbulence models were investigated. The results of the above-mentioned investigations are presented in this paper.

B.; Drozdov, A. A.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods are widely used for centrifugal compressors design and flow analysis. The calculation results are dependent on the chosen software, turbulence models and solver settings. Two of the most widely applicable programs are NUMECA Fine Turbo and ANSYS CFX. The objects of the study were two different stages. CFD-calculations were made for a single blade channel and for full 360-degree flow paths. Stage 1 with 3D impeller and vaneless diffuser was tested experimentally. Its flow coefficient is 0.08 and loading factor is 0.74. For stage 1 calculations were performed with different grid quality, a different number of cells and different models of turbulence. The best results have demonstrated the Spalart-Allmaras model and mesh with 1.854 million cells. Stage 2 with return channel, vaneless diffuser and 3D impeller with flow coefficient 0.15 and loading factor 0.5 was designed by the known Universal Modeling Method. Its performances were calculated by the well identified Math model. Stage 2 performances by CFD calculations shift to higher flow rate in comparison with design performances. The same result was obtained for stage 1 in comparison with measured performances. Calculated loading factor is higher in both cases for a single blade channel. Loading factor performance calculated for full flow path (â360 degreesâ) by ANSYS CFX is in satisfactory agreement with the stage 2 design performance. Maximum efficiency is predicted accurately by the ANSYS CFX â360 degreesâ calculation. âSectorâ calculation is less accurate. Further research is needed to solve the problem of performances mismatch.\n\nSimulation of vortex-induced vibrations of a cylinder using ANSYS CFX rigid body solver\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIzhar, Abubakar; Qureshi, Arshad Hussain; Khushnood, Shahab\n\n2017-03-01\n\nThis article simulates the vortex-induced oscillations of a rigid circular cylinder with elastic support using the new ANSYS CFX rigid body solver. This solver requires no solid mesh to setup FSI (Fluid Structure Interaction) simulation. The two-way case was setup in CFX only. Specific mass of the cylinder and flow conditions were similar to previous experimental data with mass damping parameter equal to 0.04, specific mass of 1 and Reynolds number of 3800. Two dimensional simulations were setup. Both one-degree-of-freedom and two-degree-of-freedom cases were run and results were obtained for both cases with reasonable accuracy as compared with experimental results. Eight-figure XY trajectory and lock-in behavior were clearly captured. The obtained results were satisfactory.\n\nFluid-solid interaction: benchmarking of an external coupling of ANSYS with CFX for cardiovascular applications.\n\nPubMed\n\nHose, D R; Lawford, P V; Narracott, A J; Penrose, J M T; Jones, I P\n\n2003-01-01\n\nFluid-solid interaction is a primary feature of cardiovascular flows. There is increasing interest in the numerical solution of these systems as the extensive computational resource required for such studies becomes available. One form of coupling is an external weak coupling of separate solid and fluid mechanics codes. Information about the stress tensor and displacement vector at the wetted boundary is passed between the codes, and an iterative scheme is employed to move towards convergence of these parameters at each time step. This approach has the attraction that separate codes with the most extensive functionality for each of the separate phases can be selected, which might be important in the context of the complex rheology and contact mechanics that often feature in cardiovascular systems. Penrose and Staples describe a weak coupling of CFX for computational fluid mechanics to ANSYS for solid mechanics, based on a simple Jacobi iteration scheme. It is important to validate the coupled numerical solutions. An extensive analytical study of flow in elastic-walled tubes was carried out by Womersley in the late 1950s. This paper describes the performance of the coupling software for the straight elastic-walled tube, and compares the results with Womersley's analytical solutions. It also presents preliminary results demonstrating the application of the coupled software in the context of a stented vessel.\n\nBuoyancy Driven Coolant Mixing Studies of Natural Circulation Flows at the ROCOM Test Facility Using ANSYS CFX\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHohne, Thomas; Kliem, Soren; Rohde, Ulrich\n\n2006-07-01\n\nCoolant mixing in the cold leg, downcomer and the lower plenum of pressurized water reactors is an important phenomenon mitigating the reactivity insertion into the core. Therefore, mixing of the de-borated slugs with the ambient coolant in the reactor pressure vessel was investigated at the four loop 1:5 scaled ROCOM mixing test facility. Thermal hydraulics analyses showed, that weakly borated condensate can accumulate in particular in the pump loop seal of those loops, which do not receive safety injection. After refilling of the primary circuit, natural circulation in the stagnant loops can re-establish simultaneously and the de-borated slugs are shiftedmoreÂ Â» towards the reactor pressure vessel (RPV). In the ROCOM experiments, the length of the flow ramp and the initial density difference between the slugs and the ambient coolant was varied. From the test matrix experiments with 0 resp. 2% density difference between the de-borated slugs and the ambient coolant were used to validate the CFD software ANSYS CFX. To model the effects of turbulence on the mean flow a higher order Reynolds stress turbulence model was employed and a mesh consisting of 6.4 million hybrid elements was utilized. Only the experiments and CFD calculations with modeled density differences show a stratification in the downcomer. Depending on the degree of density differences the less dense slugs flow around the core barrel at the top of the downcomer. At the opposite side the lower borated coolant is entrained by the colder safety injection water and transported to the core. The validation proves that ANSYS CFX is able to simulate appropriately the flow field and mixing effects of coolant with different densities.

M.; Irwanto, M.; Leow, W. Z.; Amelia, A. R.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nA research has been conducted to find the optimum combination for DC fan air cooling system of photovoltaic (PV) panel. During normal operation of PV panel, it is estimated that only 15 % of solar radiation is converted into electrical energy. Meanwhile, the rest of the solar radiation is converted into heat energy which affects the performance of the PV panel. Therefore, the aim of this research is to investigate the performance power evaluation of DC fan cooling system for PV panel by using ANSYS CFX. The effect of airflow configuration of DC fan has been investigated. This is to analyze whether the airflow circulation of DC fan cause a change towards the maximum temperature of PV panel. Besides, the impact of varying number of DC fans attached at the back of PV panel is evaluated. The result of airflow circulation of DC fan has been discussed. Meanwhile, with the increment number of DC fans, the PV panel temperature drops significantly. As a conclusion, the optimum number of DC fans is two with the combination of inlet airflow.\n\nDetermination of the temperature distribution in a minichannel using ANSYS CFX and a procedure based on the Trefftz functions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMaciejewska, Beata; BÅasiak, SÅawomir; Piasecka, Magdalena\n\nThis work discusses the mathematical model for laminar-flow heat transfer in a minichannel. The boundary conditions in the form of temperature distributions on the outer sides of the channel walls were determined from experimental data. The data were collected from the experimental stand the essential part of which is a vertical minichannel 1.7 mm deep, 16 mm wide and 180 mm long, asymmetrically heated by a Haynes-230 alloy plate. Infrared thermography allowed determining temperature changes on the outer side of the minichannel walls. The problem was analysed numerically through either ANSYS CFX software or special calculation procedures based on the Finite Element Method and Trefftz functions in the thermal boundary layer. The Trefftz functions were used to construct the basis functions. Solutions to the governing differential equations were approximated with a linear combination of Trefftz-type basis functions. Unknown coefficients of the linear combination were calculated by minimising the functional. The results of the comparative analysis were represented in a graphical form and discussed.\n\nNumerical Performance Prediction of a Miniature Ramjet at Mach 4\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2012-09-01\n\nwith the computational fluids dynamic (CFD) code from ANSYS - CFX .

NUMBER\n\nA General Computational Approach for Magnetohydrodynamic Flows Using the CFX Code: Buoyant Flow Through a Vertical Square Channel\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDi Piazza, Ivan; Buehler, Leo\n\n2000-09-15\n\nThe buoyancy-driven magnetoconvection in the cross section of an infinitely long vertical square duct is investigated numerically using the CFX code package. The implementation of a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) problem in CFX is discussed, with particular reference to the Lorentz forces and the electric potential boundary conditions for arbitrary electrical conductivity of the walls. The method proposed is general and applies to arbitrary geometries with an arbitrary orientation of the magnetic field. Results for fully developed flow under various thermal boundary conditions are compared with asymptotic analytical solutions. The comparison shows that the asymptotic analysis is confirmed for highly conducting wallsmoreÂ Â» as high velocity jets occur at the side walls. For weakly conducting walls, the side layers become more conducting than the side walls, and strong electric currents flow within these layers parallel to the magnetic field. As a consequence, the velocity jets are suppressed, and the core solution is only corrected by the viscous forces near the wall. The implementation of MHD in CFX is achieved.Â«Â less\n\nApplication of CFX-10 to the Investigation of RPV Coolant Mixing in VVER Reactors\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMoretti, Fabio; Melideo, Daniele; Terzuoli, Fulvio\n\n2006-07-01\n\nCoolant mixing phenomena occurring in the pressure vessel of a nuclear reactor constitute one of the main objectives of investigation by researchers concerned with nuclear reactor safety. For instance, mixing plays a relevant role in reactivity-induced accidents initiated by de-boration or boron dilution events, followed by transport of a de-borated slug into the vessel of a pressurized water reactor. Another example is constituted by temperature mixing, which may sensitively affect the consequences of a pressurized thermal shock scenario. Predictive analysis of mixing phenomena is strongly improved by the availability of computational tools able to cope with the inherent three-dimensionality ofmoreÂ Â» such problem, like system codes with three-dimensional capabilities, and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes. The present paper deals with numerical analyses of coolant mixing in the reactor pressure vessel of a VVER-1000 reactor, performed by the ANSYS CFX-10 CFD code. In particular, the 'swirl' effect that has been observed to take place in the downcomer of such kind of reactor has been addressed, with the aim of assessing the capability of the codes to predict that effect, and to understand the reasons for its occurrence. Results have been compared against experimental data from V1000CT-2 Benchmark. Moreover, a boron mixing problem has been investigated, in the hypothesis that a de-borated slug, transported by natural circulation, enters the vessel. Sensitivity analyses have been conducted on some geometrical features, model parameters and boundary conditions.

The production of Î²-lactamase by Prevotella spp. is in turn associated with the expression of the genes cfxA and cfxA2. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of cfxA and cfxA2 in Prevotella strains by use of real-time PCR and to assess the performance of this molecular method for the direct detection of the genes in 87 clinical samples (pus and root canal exudates) from dentoalveolar infection. Production of Î²-lactamase by each isolate was determined using a nitrocefin disk. Î²-Lactamase production was seen in 31% of Prevotella isolates, while all isolates of other species were Î²-lactamase negative. The penicillin resistance of isolates strongly correlated with the production of Î²-lactamase. Real-time PCR was found to detect the cfxA and cfxA2 genes from at least five cells per reaction mixture (5 Ã 103 CFU/ml of pus). Using real-time PCR, the presence of cfxA and cfxA2 was evident for all 48 Î²-lactamase-positive Prevotella strains. In contrast, neither Î²-lactamase-negative Prevotella (n = 91) or non-Prevotella (n = 31) strains were positive for the genes. In this study, 31 of the 87 samples yielded Î²-lactamase-positive Prevotella results, and cfxA and cfxA2 were detected in all 31 samples. Of the 56 culture-negative samples, 8 (14%) were positive for cfxA and cfxA2 by the real-time PCR. This sensitive and specific molecular method offers a rapid clinical test for aiding in the selection of an appropriate antibiotic for treatment of dentoalveolar infection. Although penicillin remains largely effective in the treatment of dentoalveolar infection, Î²-lactamase-stable antibiotics should be considered in cases in which Î²-lactamase-positive Prevotella strains are involved.

This method aims to increase the reliability and the trust that can be placed into complex CFD simulations. The first step of this methodology, the code verification is presented in greater details. The CFD transport equations in steady state, transient and Arbitrary Eulerian Lagrangian (ALE, used for transient moving mesh) formulations in Ansys CFX are verified. It is shown that the expected spatial and temporal order of convergence are achieved for the steady state and the transient formulations. Unfortunately this is not completely the case for the ALE formulation. As for a lot of other commercial and in-house CFD codes, the temporal convergence of the velocity is limited to a first order where a second order would have been expected.\n\nTurning Vanes in Exhaust Duct Flow: Study for Energy Efficiency, Optimization and Pressure Drop Mitigation\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2014-09-01\n\nbend of ninety degrees and the application toward waste heat recovery devices.

The commercial Li/CFx units are not suitable for high-current and low-temperature applications because they are current limited and their maximum discharge rates decrease with decreasing temperature. The term \"Li/CFx\" refers to an anode made of lithium and a cathode made of a fluorinated carbonaceous material (typically graphite). In commercial cells, x typically ranges from 1.05 to 1.1. This cell composition makes it possible to attain specific energies up to 800 Wh/kg, but in order to prevent cell polarization and the consequent large loss of cell capacity, it is typically necessary to keep discharge currents below C/50 (where C is numerically equal to the current that, flowing during a charge or discharge time of one hour, would integrate to the nominal charge or discharge capacity of a cell). This limitation has been attributed to the low electronic conductivity of CFx for x approx. 1. To some extent, the limitation might be overcome by making cathodes thinner, and some battery manufacturers have obtained promising results using thin cathode structures in spiral configurations. The present approach includes not only making cathodes relatively thin [.2 mils (.0.051 mm)] but also using sub-fluorinated CFx cathode materials (x < 1) in conjunction with electrolytes formulated for use at low temperatures. The reason for choosing sub-fluorinated CFx cathode materials is that their electronic conductivities are high, relative to those for which x > 1. It was known from recent prior research that cells containing sub-fluorinated CFx cathodes (x between 0.33 and 0.66) are capable of retaining substantial portions of their nominal low-current specific energies when discharged at rates as high as 5C at room temperature.

A.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nDemand for alternative energy is growing due to decrease of fossil fuels sources. One of the promising and popular renewable energy technology is a photovoltaic (PV) technology. During the actual operation of PV cells, only around 15% of solar irradiance is converted to electricity, while the rest is converted into heat. The electrical efficiency decreases with the increment in PV panelâs temperature. This electrical energy is referring to the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Isc) and output power generate. This paper examines and discusses the PV panel with water and air cooling system. The air cooling system was installed at the back of PV panel while water cooling system at front surface. The analyses of both cooling systems were done by using ANSYS CFX and PSPICE software. The highest temperature of PV panel without cooling system is 66.3 Â°C. There is a decrement of 19.2% and 53.2% in temperature with the air and water cooling system applied to PV panel.\n\nAcoustic Model of the Remnant Bubble Cloud from Underwater Explosion\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2012-11-01\n\nfluid, bu g is the acceleration due to gravity, and C is the drag coefficient.

Here we demonstrate that the most energy-dense Li-CFx battery2 delivers a capacity exceeding the theoretical maximum of CFx with a solid electrolyte of Li3PS4 (LPS) that has dual functions: as the inert electrolyte at the anode and the active component at the cathode. Such a bi-functional electrolyte reconciles both inert and active characteristics through a synergistic dischargemoreÂ Â» mechanism of CFx and LPS. Li3PS4 is known as an inactive solid electrolyte with a broad electrochemical window over 5 V.3 The synergy at the cathode is through LiF, the discharge product of CFx, which activates the electrochemical discharge of LPS at a close electrochemical potential of CFx. Therefore, the solid-state Li-CFx batteries output 126.6% energy beyond their theoretic limits without compromising the stability of the cell voltage. The extra energy comes from the electrochemical discharge of LPS, the inert electrolyte. This bi-functional electrolyte revolutionizes the concept of conventional batteries and opens a new avenue for the design of batteries with an unprecedentedly high energy density.Â«Â less\n\nElectrolytes for Low-Temperature Operation of Li-CFx Cells\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSmart, Marshall C.; Whitacre, Jay F.; Bugga, Ratnakumar V.; Prakash, G. K. Surya; Bhalla, Pooja; Smith, Kiah\n\n2009-01-01\n\nA report describes a study of electrolyte compositions selected as candidates for improving the low-temperature performances of primary electrochemical cells that contain lithium anodes and fluorinated carbonaceous (CFx) cathodes. This study complements the developments reported in Additive for Low-Temperature Operation of Li-(CF)n Cells (NPO- 43579) and Li/CFx Cells Optimized for Low-Temperature Operation (NPO- 43585), which appear elsewhere in this issue of NASA Tech Briefs. Similar to lithium-based electrolytes described in several previous NASA Tech Briefs articles, each of these electrolytes consisted of a lithium salt dissolved in a nonaqueous solvent mixture. Each such mixture consisted of two or more of the following ingredients: propylene carbonate (PC); 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME); trifluoropropylene carbonate; bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) ether; diethyl carbonate; dimethyl carbonate; and ethyl methyl carbonate. The report describes the physical and chemical principles underlying the selection of the compositions (which were not optimized) and presents results of preliminary tests made to determine effects of the compositions upon the low-temperature capabilities of Li-CFx cells, relative to a baseline composition of LiBF4 at a concentration of 1.0 M in a solvent comprising equal volume parts of PC and DME.\n\nANSYS duplicate finite-element checker routine\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nOrtega, R.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nAn ANSYS finite-element code routine to check for duplicated elements within the volume of a three-dimensional (3D) finite-element mesh was developed.

Conventionally, a simplified 3-dimensional MCNP model is applied to calculate these parameters because of the cumbersomeness of modelling by hand. ANSYS has a function for converting the CAD `stp' format into an MCNP input in the geometry part. Using ANSYS and a 3- dimensional CAD file, a very detailed and sophisticated MCNP 3-dimensional model can be generated. The MCNP model is applied to evaluate the assembly weighting factor at the ex-core detector of SMART, and the result is compared with a simplified MCNP SMART model and assembly weighting factor calculated by DORT, which is a deterministic Sn code.\n\nAnalysis of composite plates by using mechanics of structure genome and comparison with ANSYS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhao, Banghua\n\nMotivated by a recently discovered concept, Structure Genome (SG) which is defined as the smallest mathematical building block of a structure, a new approach named Mechanics of Structure Genome (MSG) to model and analyze composite plates is introduced. MSG is implemented in a general-purpose code named SwiftComp(TM), which provides the constitutive models needed in structural analysis by homogenization and pointwise local fields by dehomogenization. To improve the user friendliness of SwiftComp(TM), a simple graphic user interface (GUI) based on ANSYS Mechanical APDL platform, called ANSYS-SwiftComp GUI is developed, which provides a convenient way to create some common SG models or arbitrary customized SG models in ANSYS and invoke SwiftComp(TM) to perform homogenization and dehomogenization. The global structural analysis can also be handled in ANSYS after homogenization, which could predict the global behavior and provide needed inputs for dehomogenization. To demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the MSG approach, several numerical cases are studied and compared using both MSG and ANSYS. In the ANSYS approach, 3D solid element models (ANSYS 3D approach) are used as reference models and the 2D shell element models created by ANSYS Composite PrepPost (ACP approach) are compared with the MSG approach. The results of the MSG approach agree well with the ANSYS 3D approach while being as efficient as the ACP approach. Therefore, the MSG approach provides an efficient and accurate new way to model composite plates.\n\nA Higher-Order Conservation Element Solution Element Method for Solving Hyperbolic Differential Equations on Unstructured Meshes\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2014-03-01\n\nUnclassified c.

In spite of considerable efforts, its numerical prediction still represents a challenge for CFD models in use in engineering. Aside commercial software, over the latter years the opensource software OpenFOAMR (OF) has emerged as a valid tool for prediction of complex industrial flows. In the present work, we simulate two flows representative of a class of situations occurring in industrial problems: the flow around sphere and that around a wall-mounted square cylinder at Re = 10000 . We compare the performance two different tools, namely OF and ANSYS CFX 15.0 (CFX) using different unstructured grids and turbulence models. The grids have been generated using SNAPPYHEXMESH and ANSYS ICEM CFD 15.0 with different near wall resolutions. The codes have been run in a RANS mode using k - É model (OF) and SST - k - Ï (CFX) with and without wall-layer models. OF has been also used in LES, WMLES and DES mode. Regarding the sphere, RANS models were not able to catch separation, while good prediction of separation and distribution of stresses over the surface were obtained using LES, WMLES and DES. Results for the second test case are currently under analysis.

Initial images were obtained by using CT angiography and 3D digital subtraction angiography in DICOM format. The image was processed by using MIMICS software, and the 3D fluid model (blood flow) and 3D solid model (wall) were generated. The subsequent output was exported to the ANSYS workbench software to generate the volumetric mesh for further hemodynamic study. The fluid model was defined and simulated in CFX software while the solid model was calculated in ANSYS software. The force data calculated firstly in the CFX software were transferred to the ANSYS software, and after receiving the force data, total mesh displacement data were calculated in the ANSYS software. Then, the mesh displacement data were transferred back to the CFX software. The data exchange was processed in workbench software. The results of simulation could be visualized in CFX-post.

During operation DFW will include solid main body as well as liquid coolant. Thus thermal and hydraulic analysis of the DFW was performed using conjugated heat transfer approach, in which heat transfer was resolved in both solid and liquid parts, and simultaneously fluid dynamics analysis was performed only in the liquid part. This approach includes interface between solid and liquid part of the systemAnalysis was performed using ANSYS CFX software. CFX software allows solution of heat transfer equations in solid and liquid part, and solution ofmoreÂ Â» the flow equations in the liquid part. Coolant flow in the DFW was assumed turbulent and was resolved using Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations with Shear Stress Transport turbulence model. Meshing was performed using CFX method available within ANSYS. The data cloud for thermal loading consisting of volumetric heating and surface heating was imported into CFX Volumetric heating source was generated using Attila software. Surface heating was obtained using radiation heat transfer analysis. Our results allowed us to identify areas of excessive heating. Proposals for cooling channel relocation were made.

This paper introduces the research on the coupling of Monte Carlo method and CFD method, specifically using TMCC and CFX. The methods of the coupling including the coupling approach, data transfer, mesh mapping and transient coupling scheme are studied firstly. The coupling of TMCC and CFX for the steady state calculations is studied and described for the single rod model and the 3 x 3 Rod Bundle model. The calculation results prove that the coupling method is feasiblemoreÂ Â» and the coupled calculation can be used for steady state calculations. However, the oscillation which occurs during the coupled calculation indicates that this method still needs to be improved for the accuracy. Then the coupling for the transient calculations is also studied and tested by two cases of the steady state and the lost of heat sink. The preliminary results of the transient coupled calculations indicates that the transient coupling with TMCC and CFX is able to simulate the transients but instabilities are occurring. It is also concluded that the transient coupling of TMCC and CFX needs to be improved due to the limitation of computational resource and the difference of time scales.

When the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) issues an affirmative determination on Standard 90.1, states are statutorily required to certify within two years that they have reviewed and updated the commercial provisions of their building energy code, with respect to energy efficiency, to meet or exceed the revised standard. This report provides a preliminarymoreÂ Â» qualitative analysis of all addenda to ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1-2010 (referred to as Standard 90.1-2010 or 2010 edition) that were included in ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1-2013 (referred to as Standard 90.1-2013 or 2013 edition).Â«Â less\n\nEffects of inlet boundary conditions, on the computed flow in the Turbine-99 draft tube, using OpenFOAM and CFX\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNilsson, H.; Cervantes, M. J.\n\n2012-11-01\n\nThe flow in the Turbine-99 Kaplan draft tube was thoroughly investigated at three workshops (1999, 2001, 2005), which aimed at determining the state of the art of draft tube simulations. The flow is challenging due to the different flow phenomena appearing simultaneously such as unsteadiness, separation, swirl, turbulence, and a strong adverse pressure gradient. The geometry and the experimentally determined inlet boundary conditions were provided to the Turbine-99 workshop participants. At the final workshop, angular resolved inlet velocity boundary conditions were provided. The rotating non-axi-symmetry of the inlet flow due to the runner blades was thus included. The effect of the rotating angular resolution was however not fully investigated at that workshop. The first purpose of this work is to further investigate this effect. Several different inlet boundary conditions are applied - the angular resolved experimental data distributed at the Turbine-99 workshop, the angular resolved results of a runner simulation with interpolated values using different resolution in the tangential and radial directions, and an axi-symmetric variant of the same numerical data. The second purpose of this work is to compare the results from the OpenFOAM and CFX CFD codes, using as similar settings as possible. The present results suggest that the experimental angular inlet boundary conditions proposed to the workshop are not adequate to simulate accurately the flow in the T-99 draft tube. The reason for this is that the experimental phase-averaged data has some important differences compared to the previously measured time-averaged data. Using the interpolated data from the runner simulation as inlet boundary condition however gives good results as long as the resolution of that data is sufficient. It is shown that the difference between the results using the angular-resolved and the corresponding symmetric inlet data is very small, suggesting that the importance of the angular\n\n[Design of Complex Cavity Structure in Air Route System of Automated Peritoneal Dialysis Machine].\n\nPubMed\n\nQuan, Xiaoliang\n\n2017-07-30\n\nThis paper introduced problems about Automated Peritoneal Dialysis machine(APD) that the lack of technical issues such as the structural design of the complex cavities.

(M&D) is under subcontract to Pacific Northwest National Laboratories (PNNL) to perform seismic analysis of the Hanford Site Double-Shell Tanks (DSTs) in support of a project entitled ''Double-Shell Tank (DSV Integrity Project-DST Thermal and Seismic Analyses)''. The overall scope of the project is to complete an up-to-date comprehensive analysis of record of the DST System at Hanford in support of Tri-Party Agreement Milestone M-48-14. The work described herein was performed in support of the seismic analysis of the DSTs. The thermal and operating loads analysis of the DSTs is documented in Rinker et al. (2004). ThemoreÂ Â» overall seismic analysis of the DSTs is being performed with the general-purpose finite element code ANSYS. The overall model used for the seismic analysis of the DSTs includes the DST structure, the contained waste, and the surrounding soil. The seismic analysis of the DSTs must address the fluid-structure interaction behavior and sloshing response of the primary tank and contained liquid. ANSYS has demonstrated capabilities for structural analysis, but the capabilities and limitations of ANSYS to perform fluid-structure interaction are less well understood. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the capabilities and investigate the limitations of ANSYS for performing a fluid-structure interaction analysis of the primary tank and contained waste. To this end, the ANSYS solutions are benchmarked against theoretical solutions appearing in BNL 1995, when such theoretical solutions exist. When theoretical solutions were not available, comparisons were made to theoretical solutions of similar problems and to the results from Dytran simulations. The capabilities and limitations of the finite element code Dytran for performing a fluid-structure interaction analysis of the primary tank and contained waste were explored in a parallel investigation (Abatt 2006). In conjunction with the results of the global ANSYS\n\nSimulation of Containment Atmosphere Mixing and Stratification Experiment in the ThAI Facility with a CFD Code\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBabic, Miroslav; Kljenak, Ivo; Mavko, Borut\n\n2006-07-01\n\nThe CFD code CFX4.4 was used to simulate an experiment in the ThAI facility, which was designed for investigation of thermal-hydraulic processes during a severe accident inside a Light Water Reactor containment. In the considered experiment, air was initially present in the vessel, and helium and steam were injected during different phases of the experiment at various mass flow rates and at different locations. The main purpose of the proposed work was to assess the capabilities of the CFD code to reproduce the atmosphere structure with a three-dimensional model, coupled with condensation models proposed by the authors. A three-dimensional modelmoreÂ Â» of the ThAI vessel for the CFX4.4 code was developed. The flow in the simulation domain was modeled as single-phase. Steam condensation on vessel walls was modeled as a sink of mass and energy using a correlation that was originally developed for an integral approach. A simple model of bulk phase change was also included. Calculated time-dependent variables together with temperature and volume fraction distributions at the end of different experiment phases are compared to experimental results.

The first method - numerical method, consists in determining the flow characteristics with the use of ANSYS CFX. A modeled poppet directional valve 3/2 3D CAD software - SolidWorks was used for this purpose. Based on the solid model that was developed, simulation studies of the air flow through the way valve in the software for computational fluid dynamics Ansys CFX were conducted. The second method - experimental, entailed conducting tests on a specially constructed test stand. The comparison of the test results obtained on the basis of both methods made it possible to determine the cross-correlation. High compatibility of the results confirms the usefulness of the numerical procedures. Thus, they might serve to determine the flow characteristics of directional valves as an alternative to a costly and time-consuming test stand.\n\nInvestigation of Transitional Flows on Compressor Blades in Cascade\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2011-09-01\n\nUU NSN 7540â01â280â5500 Standard Form 298 (Rev. 2â89) Prescribed by ANSI Std. 239â18 ii THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK iii Approved for...mesh was refined by adjusting the number of divisions in the âEdge Sizingâ menu and the growth rate in the âsizingâ section of the CFX Mesher.

The driver circuit, magnetic field, joule heating, and liner dynamics calculations are performed at each time step in sequence to couple these effects in the code. To obtain more realistic magnetic field results for a given drive coil geometry, 2D and 3D effects are incorporated into the 1D field calculation through use of correction factor table lookup approach. Commercial low-frequency electromagnetic fields solver, ANSYS Maxwell 3D, is used to solve the magnetic field profile for static liner condition at various liner radius in order to derive correction factors for the 1D field calculation in the code. The liner dynamics results from the code is verified to be in good agreement with the results from commercial explicit dynamics solver, ANSYS Explicit Dynamics, and previous liner experiment. The developed code is used to optimize the capacitor bank and driver coil design for better energy transfer and coupling. FRC gain calculations are also performed using the liner compression data from the code for the conceptual design of the reactor sized system for fusion energy gains.\n\nBuilding SAWE Capability as an ANSI Accredited Standards Developer\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCerro, Jeffrey A.; Davis, Ed; Peterson, Eric; Griffiths, William T.; Brooks, Andy; Stratton, Bonnie; Attar, Jose\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis paper presents a 2014 status of the Society of Allied Weight Engineers' process towards becoming an Accredited Standards Developer (ASD) under certification by the United States American National Standards Institute (ANSI).

The model implemented into the commercial CFD Code ANSYS CFX includes appropriate real gas relations based on the volume-corrected Peng-Robinson (PR) equation of state (EOS) for the flow field and a real gas extension of the laminar flamelet combustion model. The results indicate that the real gas relations have a considerably larger impact on the flow field than on the detailed flame structure. Generally, a realistic flame shape could be achieved for the real gas approach compared to experimental data from the Mascotte test rig V03 operated at ONERA when the differential diffusion processes were only considered within the flame zone.\n\nSandia/Stanford Unified Creep Plasticity Damage Model for ANSYS\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPierce, David M.; Vianco, Paul T.; Fossum, Arlo F.\n\n2006-09-03\n\nA unified creep plasticity (UCP) model was developed, based upon the time-dependent and time-independent deformation properties of the 95.5Sn-3.9Ag-0.6Cu (wt.%) soldier that were measured at Sandia. Then, a damage parameter, D, was added to the equation to develop the unified creep plasticity damage (UCPD) model. The parameter, D, was parameterized, using data obtained at Sandia from isothermal fatigue experiments on a double-lap shear test. The softwae was validated against a BGA solder joint exposed to thermal cycling. The UCPD model was put into the ANSYS finite element as a subroutine. So, the softwae is the subroutine for ANSYS 8.1.\n\nANSYS tools in modeling tires\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAli, Ashraf; Lovell, Michael\n\n1995-01-01\n\nThis presentation summarizes the capabilities in the ANSYS program that relate to the computational modeling of tires. The power and the difficulties associated with modeling nearly incompressible rubber-like materials using hyperelastic constitutive relationships are highlighted from a developer's point of view. The topics covered include a hyperelastic material constitutive model for rubber-like materials, a general overview of contact-friction capabilities, and the acoustic fluid-structure interaction problem for noise prediction.

The examples are independent of the analysis software used and allow the assessment of the automated delamination propagation in commercial finite element codes based on the virtual crack closure technique (VCCT). The examples selected are based on two-dimensional finite element models of Double Cantilever Beam (DCB), End-Notched Flexure (ENF), Mixed-Mode Bending (MMB) and Single Leg Bending (SLB) specimens. First, the quasi-static benchmark examples were recreated for each specimen using the current implementation of VCCT in ANSYS . Second, the delamination was allowed to propagate under quasi-static loading from its initial location using the automated procedure implemented in the finite element software. Third, the load-displacement relationship from a propagation analysis and the benchmark results were compared, and good agreement could be achieved by selecting the appropriate input parameters. The benchmarking procedure proved valuable by highlighting the issues associated with choosing the input parameters of the particular implementation. Overall the results are encouraging, but further assessment for three-dimensional solid models is required.\n\n[Finite Element Analysis of Intravascular Stent Based on ANSYS Software].\n\nPubMed\n\nShi, Gengqiang; Song, Xiaobing\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThis paper adopted UG8.0 to bulid the stent and blood vessel models. The models were then imported into the finite element analysis software ANSYS. The simulation results of ANSYS software showed that after endothelial stent implantation, the velocity of the blood was slow and the fluctuation of velocity was small, which meant the flow was relatively stable. When blood flowed through the endothelial stent, the pressure gradually became smaller, and the range of the pressure was not wide. The endothelial shear stress basically unchanged. In general, it can be concluded that the endothelial stents have little impact on the flow of blood and can fully realize its function.\n\nNumerical investigations of arc behaviour in gas metal arc welding using ANSYS CFX\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchnick, M.; Fuessel, U.; Hertel, M.; Spille-Kohoff, A.; Murphy, A. B.\n\n2011-06-01\n\nCurrent numerical models of gas metal arc welding (GMAW) are trying to combine magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) models of the arc and volume of fluid (VoF) models of metal transfer. They neglect vaporization and assume an argon atmosphere for the arc region, as it is common practice for models of gas tungsten arc welding. These models predict temperatures above 20 000 K and a temperature distribution similar to tungsten inert gas (TIG) arcs. However, current spectroscopic temperature measurements in GMAW arcs demonstrate much lower arc temperatures. In contrast to TIG arcs they found a central local minimum of the radial temperature distribution. The paper presents a GMAW arc model that considers metal vapour and which is in a very good agreement with experimentally observed temperatures. Furthermore, the model is able to predict the local central minimum in the radial temperature and the radial electric current density distributions for the first time. The axially symmetric model of the welding torch, the work piece, the wire and the arc (fluid domain) implements MHD as well as turbulent mixing and thermal demixing of metal vapour in argon. The mass fraction of iron vapour obtained from the simulation shows an accumulation in the arc core and another accumulation on the fringes of the arc at 2000 to 5000 K. The demixing effects lead to very low concentrations of iron between these two regions. Sensitive analyses demonstrate the influence of the transport and radiation properties of metal vapour, and the evaporation rate relative to the wire feed. Finally the model predictions are compared with the measuring results of ZieliÅska et al.\n\nPLASIM: A computer code for simulating charge exchange plasma propagation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRobinson, R.

It is intended for use by experienced users of ANSYS and CARES. Knowledge of compiling and linking FORTRAN programs is also required. Maximum use is made of existing routines (from other CARES interface programs and ANSYS routines) to extract the finite element results and prepare the neutral file for input to the reliability analysis. FORTRAN and machine language routines as described are used to read the ANSYS results file. Sub-element stresses are computed and written to a neutral file using FORTRAN subroutines which are nearly identical to those used in the NASCARES (MSC/NASTRAN to CARES) interface.\n\nPhysical mechanisms of longitudinal vortexes formation, appearance of zones with high heat fluxes and early transition in hypersonic flow over delta wing with blunted leading edges\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAlexandrov, S.

Physical mechanisms of longitudinal vortexes formation, appearance of abnormal zones with high heat fluxes and early laminar turbulent transition are studied. These phenomena were observed in many high-speed wind tunnel experiments; however they were understood only using the detailed analysis of numerical modeling results with the high resolution. Presented results allowed explaining experimental phenomena. ANSYS CFX code (the DAFE MIPT license) on the grid with 50 million nodes was used for the numerical modeling. The numerical method was verified by comparison calculated heat flux distributions on the wing surface with experimental data.\n\nWriting Material Safely Data Sheets Using the ANSI Standard.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nCroft, Suzanne D.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nPresents a history of the ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard for preparation of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), and provides a section-by-section guide to preparing MSDSs that comply with the standard.

Comparison of the results from the COMSOL model with the results from a pre-developed and validated ANSYS model ensured accuracy of the COMSOL model. Prediction of power Loss by both models was in close agreement (5-13% variation) and the predicted temperature profiles were similar. COMSOL provided a flexible model setup whereas ANSYS required coupling incompatible elements to transfer load between electromagnetic, fluid flow, and heat transport modules. Overall, both software packages provided the ability to solve multiphysics phenomena accurately.\n\nTotal Electron-Impact Ionization Cross-Sections of CFx and NFx (x = 1 - 3)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHuo, Winifred M.; Tarnovsky, Vladimir; Becker, Kurt H.; Kwak, Dochan (Technical Monitor)\n\n2001-01-01\n\nThe discrepancy between experimental and theoretical total electron-impact ionization cross sections for a group of fluorides, CFx, and NFx, (x = 1 - 3), is attributed to the inadequacies in previous theoretical models. Cross-sections calculated using a recently developed siBED (simulation Binary-Encounter-Dipole) model that takes into account the shielding of the long-range dipole potential between the scattering electron and target are in agreement with experimentation. The present study also carefully reanalyzed the previously reported experimental data to account for the possibility of incomplete collection of fragment ions and the presence of ion-pair formation channels. For NF3, our experimental and theoretical cross-sections compare well with the total ionization cross-sections recently reported by Haaland et al. in the region below dication formation.\n\nDesign Compliance Matrices to ANSI and OSHA\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBENDIXSEN, R.B.\n\n2000-04-03\n\nU.S. Department of Energy Letter 98-SFD-028 requested Fluor Daniel Hanford, Inc. to provide clarifications as to compliance with ANSI 57.1, 57.2, 57.9, and 29 CFR 1910.179 (OSHA), in the form of an item-by-item compliance matrix, for the CSB.

ACDOS2 is in ANSI FORTRAN IV, in order to make it readily adaptable elsewhere.\n\nANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1-2013 Determination of Energy Savings: Qualitative Analysis\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHalverson, Mark A.; Rosenberg, Michael I.; Hart, Philip R.\n\n2014-09-04\n\nThis report provides a final qualitative analysis of all addenda to ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1-2010 (referred to as Standard 90.1-2010 or 2010 edition) that were included in ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1-2013 (referred to as Standard 90.1-2013 or 2013 edition). All addenda in creating Standard 90.1-2013 were evaluated for their projected impact on energy efficiency. Each addendum was characterized as having a positive, neutral, or negative impact on overall building energy efficiency.\n\nNumerical Analysis of 2-D and 3-D MHD Flows Relevant to Fusion Applications\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nKhodak, Andrei\n\n2017-08-21\n\nHere, the analysis of many fusion applications such as liquid-metal blankets requires application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods for electrically conductive liquids in geometrically complex regions and in the presence of a strong magnetic field. A current state of the art general purpose CFD code allows modeling of the flow in complex geometric regions, with simultaneous conjugated heat transfer analysis in liquid and surrounding solid parts. Together with a magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) capability, the general purpose CFD code will be a valuab"
