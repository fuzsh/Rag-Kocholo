        "text": "#Product Trends\n\nAnsys launches all-in-one hub for simulation\n\nAnsys has announced the launch of the Ansys Developer portal to make tools for developers more accessible —the new digital space will better enable the Ansys ecosystem and connect users and Ansys experts in all areas of simulation.\n\nThe Ansys Developer portal brings together developer tools from the entire Ansys portfolio into a single hub with documentation, examples, guides, and use cases. The portal equips users to accelerate their work by extending simulation workflows across the Ansys portfolio. It also includes a community forum for customers, partners, and internal developers to collaborate, share ideas, ask questions, and suggest features while providing direct access to open-source initiatives like the PyAnsys project Python libraries.\n\nAnsys is committed to providing customers with the tools needed to speed innovation and achieve goals. By simplifying and streamlining the availability of this set of resources, Ansys is enabling engineers, architects, and developers to better design new solutions for automating repetitive and complex simulations and workflows across physics and engineering domains. Facilitating access to these resources through the portal will significantly reduce the time required to complete tasks and minimise the potential for errors. The portal is a key foundation for building new solutions in simulation, including those used to train artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) models.\n\nCustomers across all industries will benefit from the tools and support provided by the Ansys Developer portal. For example, Danfoss, a market-leading company delivering an extensive range of products and solutions across three business segments, is focused on empowering its customers to decarbonise through energy efficiency, machine productivity, low emissions, and electrification.\n\n“Ansys’ robust ecosystem of developer tools empowers our engineers to automate shared workflows, combine different tools, and democratise simulation for all team members to use,” said Jakob Harming, a lead system simulation engineer at Danfoss. “Having access to Ansys tools provides us with a common framework to easily create apps, set up and run simulations, and create reports. Additionally, having to learn only Python is a huge advantage since most graduates have a basic understanding of it.”\n\n“The Ansys Developer portal will bring our developer tools and enablement together, into a single environment for collaboration, shared learning, and innovation,” said Shane Emswiler, senior vice president of products at Ansys. “With this platform, we can grow and nurture Ansys’ developer ecosystem and greatly improve the experience by providing easier access to relevant tools, resources, and technical support.”\n\nwww.ansys.com"
