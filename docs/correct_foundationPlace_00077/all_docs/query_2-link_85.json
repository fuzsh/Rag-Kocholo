        "text": "Penn State Behrend’s class of 2022 is ready to make its mark on the world! We’re proud of our students and the things they’ve accomplished and learned while here at Behrend. Over the next several weeks, we’ll be introducing you to a few of our remarkable seniors who have overcome challenges, pioneered new technology, participated in important research projects, and left an impression at Penn State Behrend.\n\nToday, we’d like you to meet Breanna McClain.\n\nMajor: Marketing\n\nMinor: Communication Arts and Mass Media\n\nCertificates: Public Relations and Advertising\n\nHometown: Columbus, Pennsylvania\n\nScholarships: Joseph Defrees Scholarship\n\nOn choosing Behrend: I knew coming to a smaller campus would increase the possibility of having a positive relationship with my professors. I wanted to be known by name, not just be one of a number of students in a program.\n\nOn choosing her major: I chose my major because marketing is the creative side of business. I’ve always been a creative person, and I wanted to use these gifts to help advertise products, services, or events.\n\nProudest accomplishment at Behrend: My proudest accomplishment has been my ability to increase my GPA every semester. I have continued to improve academically, and I am very proud of my dedication to continue to do better.\n\nCampus involvement: I am the Vice President of Advertising in the American Marketing Association Club and am a Business Ambassador. I also was a part of the concert band whenever my schedule would allow it. I play the tenor saxophone.\n\nA really “wild” internship: I did an internship at the Erie Zoo where I helped with social media and event planning. I loved helping the zoo staff get ready for events and watching visitors enjoy them. I got to have some cool interactions with the animals, and a lot of them recognized me by the end of my internship, which made me feel pretty special. I have some great photos with the zoo’s male orangutan, “Joe,” who recently passed away. I was really upset to hear that news and am glad to have made some memories with him.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nAwards and recognitions: I recently received the Outstanding Marketing Student Award, and I made the Dean’s List every semester.\n\nWhat makes her unique: I have an eye for design. I can take information and make a visual that will better represent and communicate what needs to be shared.\n\nHer definition of the good life: My definition of living a good life is to treat everyone with kindness. If I can make someone else’s day a little brighter, I am satisfied that I am living the best possible life I can.\n\nHer passion: One of my passions is photography. I enjoy capturing the small things people might otherwise overlook. It has helped me see at the world differently because I used to miss these things like everyone else. Now, I take time to notice and appreciate things around me and want to help others do the same.\n\nAdvice for first-year students: My advice would be not to get lost in the stress of the world. Life is easier if you can think of at least one good thing that happened in your day. If you can find that one good thing, it can completely change your outlook on life.\n\nAfter graduation, Breanna plans to explore non-profit or for-profit organizational work in social media and event planning or pursue advertising work for a small marketing firm\n\nPenn State Behrend’s class of 2022 is ready to make its mark on the world! We’re proud of our students and the things they’ve accomplished and learned while here at Behrend. Over the next several weeks, we’ll be introducing you to a few of our remarkable seniors who have overcome challenges, pioneered new technology, participated in important research projects, and left an impression at Penn State Behrend.\n\nToday, we’d like you to meet Laura Gil.\n\nMajors: Business Economics, International Business and Management Information Systems\n\nHometown: Bogota, Colombia\n\nScholarships: Pathway to Success: Summer Start Scholarship, Erie Insurance Group Leadership Scholarship, PNC Leadership Scholarship, Benjamin A. and Carolyn A. Lane Open Doors Scholarship, and Pam and Greg Slusher Open Doors Scholarship.\n\nOn choosing her majors: My journey to three majors started when I saw the economic crisis that was happening in Venezuela and decided to major in Business Economics. After doing some research, I learned that there are many factors, even very small ones, that can affect a country’s economy, so I added International Business. Finally, I realized that I needed to understand how to better comprehend and portray data for other people to understand issues that happen globally, so I added Management Information Systems.\n\nProudest accomplishment at Behrend: Graduating with three majors in four years.\n\nCampus involvement: Student Government Association, Multicultural Council, Global Boarders, and Global Ambassadors.\n\nAwards and Recognitions: Behrend Excellence Award and the Ardeth and Norman Frisbey International Student Award, a Penn State award that recognizes undergraduate students who have contributed significantly to furthering international understanding.\n\nWhat makes her unique: I am very organized and driven to learn more about what is happening around the globe.\n\nGlobe-hopping: I have traveled to more than ten countries already!\n\nTop priority: Getting a doctoral degree.\n\nHer passion: Learning about how we are all connected through data.\n\nAdvice for first-year students: Get involved and start networking early on!\n\nOn overcoming obstacles: As an international student, I have faced many challenges to get to where I am, but I never let any of those stop me from reaching my goals.\n\nAfter graduation, Laura plans to attend graduate school and eventually earn a PhD.\n\nPenn State Behrend’s class of 2022 is ready to make its mark on the world! We’re proud of our students and the things they’ve accomplished and learned while here at Behrend. Over the next several weeks, we’ll be introducing you to a few of our remarkable seniors who have overcome challenges, pioneered new technology, participated in important research projects, and left an impression at Penn State Behrend.\n\nToday, we’d like you to meet Mike Binni.\n\nMajor: Marketing\n\nHometown: Canonsburg, Pennsylvania\n\nOn choosing Behrend: I wanted the Penn State degree and experience, but with smaller class sizes. I’ve been able to form great relationships with all of my professors, which I don’t think would’ve been possible at a larger school.\n\nOn the many paths of Marketing: I chose my major because it is a diverse degree that offers a lot of potential career paths, from data analysis to social media management to graphic design to sales.\n\nMVP on the mat: My proudest accomplishment at Behrend was being a two-time MVP on the varsity wrestling team.\n\nHe’s a people guy: I enjoy putting myself out there and talking to everyone. I just love to hear about other peoples’ lives and experiences. I think my extroverted personality makes me a natural for a career in sales.\n\nHighest priority in the coming years: First, I’d like to grow into an account managing role at Ansys Engineering Software Company, where I’ve accepted a sales position. Eventually, I want to move out of Pittsburgh for a couple of years, see the country, and learn more about who I am.\n\nPriorities, part II: My definition of a good life would be retiring at a young age so that I can spend time with my family and friends, and do something I’m really passionate about, like helping others, teaching, or mentoring.\n\nAdvice for first-year students: Put yourself out there and go to events and join clubs. Stay an extra couple of minutes after class to connect with your professors. Also, enjoy your time in college; it goes much faster than you can imagine.\n\nMike has accepted a position as a sales development representative with Anysys Engineering Software Company in Canonsburg.\n\nPenn State Behrend’s class of 2022 is ready to make its mark on the world! We’re proud of our students and the things they’ve accomplished and learned while here at Behrend. Over the next several weeks, we’ll be introducing you to a few of our remarkable seniors who have overcome challenges, pioneered new technology, participated in important research projects, and left an impression at Penn State Behrend.\n\nToday, we’d like you to meet Cara Harben.\n\nMajor: Software Engineering\n\nHometown: Attica, Ohio\n\nOn choosing Behrend: Two of the most important items on my college checklist were small class sizes and hands-on engagement. Behrend’s intimate classroom settings were instrumental in allowing me to feel connected to the course material and the faculty here. My labs have been more challenging than I ever imagined, too, but they have taught me vital skills that have left me better prepared for my career.\n\nOn switching gears: I always planned to go into medicine, but in my senior year of high school, I took a web design course and fell in love with programming. It completely flipped my plans upside down. I attended Google’s Computer Science Summer Institute before college, and it solidified my decision. I couldn’t be happier now.\n\nProudest accomplishments at Behrend: I’m fortunate to have had internships for the last three years at TechnipFMC in Erie and Northrop Grumman’s Space Systems division in California. As a member of Northrop’s intern council, I was able to pitch and start a support program for interns at my location to prevent discrimination in the workplace. That was my proudest moment during my academic career.\n\nCampus involvement: I am a member of Behrend Engineering Ambassadors, Phi Sigma Rho (engineering/science sorority), and the Cultural Cooking Club (CCC). We just made dumplings for CCC, and while the ones I made were not aesthetically pleasing, they sure were delicious.\n\nJava master: Being in this field has taught me the necessity of experimenting with different coffee brewing methods. I’m told I make a mean cup of coffee with my AeroPress, or so my partner says.\n\nWhat you’d be surprised to know about her: My hometown is a village of fewer than 800 people in the middle of nowhere.\n\nTake a moment to enjoy life: If you move too fast from one thing to the next, you’ll miss out on a lot of beautiful experiences. I like to stop and smell the flowers sometimes, whether by watching the sunset from the Burke parking garage, looking for the International Space Station on good nights, or cooking a good meal after a rough day. That’s what makes me happy.\n\nAdventures await I am ecstatic to have a clean slate to work with once my partner and I move to Colorado Springs this year. I’d really like to spend some time learning a new language and getting back into playing guitar. We’d also like to try backpacking!\n\nCultivating the next generation of engineers: Computer science outreach is what inspired me to become a software engineer. Currently, I am in the process of designing a program for a local middle school that teaches kids how to create their own Space Invaders style game in Scratch, which teaches kids to program through drag-and-drop code!\n\nAdvice for first-year students: Go to the career fair in your first year. Worst case scenario, you come out of it better equipped to face the next fair. In my case, I never thought I’d have an internship after my first year, but I did!\n\nParting thanks: My professors have been wonderful throughout my time here, and I’m grateful to them for their help, advice, and patience, especially Dr. Wen-Li Wang, associate professor of computer science and software engineering; Dr. Amed Sammoud, lecturer in computer science and software engineering; and Dr. Abdallah S. Abdallah Abousheaisha, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering.\n\nAfter graduation, Cara will be joining Progressive Insurance in Colorado Springs, Colorado, as a software developer.\n\nPenn State Behrend’s class of 2022 is ready to make its mark on the world! We’re proud of our students and the things they’ve accomplished and learned while here at Behrend. Over the next several weeks, we’ll be introducing you to a few of our remarkable seniors who have overcome challenges, pioneered new technology, participated in important research projects, and left an impression at Penn State Behrend.\n\nToday, we’d like you to meet Emily Wargo.\n\nMajor: Marketing\n\nMinors: Management Information Systems and Data Visualization\n\nHometown: Erie\n\nScholarships: Provost’s Award, Black Family Excellence and Opportunity Fund, and the Addison H. Gibson Foundation Grant.\n\nOn choosing her major: I was interested in Marketing because it offers a broad range of career opportunities. It’s a degree that pairs well with almost any minor or certificate. This allows you to customize your degree to specialize in whatever interests you.\n\nOn choosing her minors: I decided to add on a Management Information Systems minor after I took an MIS introductory class. I enjoyed the content and learned how technical skills can be used in the marketing field. I also took a Data Visualization course and learned that I enjoy working in Excel, especially creating graphs with data.\n\nCampus involvement: I was involved in many open houses and other events hosted by the Black School of Business. I represented the Marketing and MIS majors as a Business Ambassador and served on the executive board for the American Marketing Association (Behrend’s marketing club).\n\nHands-on learning: During my junior and senior years, I worked as a data visualization intern in the area of Corporate Strategy and External Engagement at Penn State Behrend. I worked to learn a visualization platform and create new processes for creating reports with research award data.\n\nWhat makes her unique: I’m resourceful. Whether it’s with cooking, collecting craft materials, or concisely taking notes, I like to keep things as logically organized as possible, while also consciously thinking about the resources being used, and allocating them in the best way. This applies to my personal relationships, as well, because I have a caring concern for others and enjoy pleasing those in a way that best suits everyone involved.\n\nTop priority: My highest priorities for the coming years are to pay off my student loans and travel. While at Behrend, I have had the chance to explore many outdoor hobbies including hiking, kayaking, and car camping. I’m looking forward to using these newfound skills to explore new places in the coming years.\n\nEmily has accepted a position as a Business Systems Analyst at TEKsystems contracted by PNC, following her graduation in May.\n\nPenn State Behrend’s class of 2022 is ready to make its mark on the world! We’re proud of our students and the things they’ve accomplished and learned while here at Behrend. Over the next several weeks, we’ll be introducing you to a few of our remarkable seniors who have overcome challenges, pioneered new technology, participated in important research projects, and left an impression at Penn State Behrend.\n\nToday, we’d like you to meet Grant Oishi:\n\nMajor: Nursing\n\nMinor: Biology\n\nHometown: State College, Pennsylvania\n\nScholarships: The Clark Family Scholarship and the Class of 1922 Memorial Scholarship, as well as several grants to aid in my undergraduate research.\n\nWhy did you choose Behrend? Initially I did not. I applied to the nursing program and the Schreyer Honors College at University Park but was not accepted. So, I did some research and found Behrend, which had a BSN nursing program and campus honors program. Erie also had a few major hospitals, which was a key factor, as I wanted the best clinical experiences. I applied and was accepted to the nursing and Behrend Honors Program.\n\nSerendipity: It turns out that not being able to attend the campus I thought I wanted to attend was one of the best things to happen to me. At Behrend, I immediately made connections with my peers and faculty, was able to easily get involved in clubs, and being so far from home, I was forced to grow as an individual.\n\nOn choosing nursing: I chose nursing for the reason most people do – I like helping people. It’s incredibly rewarding to care for someone and watch them improve, knowing that you played a role in their recovery. It’s also very humbling to have the responsibility of caring for individuals on some of the worst days of their lives. Nursing also involves a great deal of critical thinking, especially in the ICU. However, I have always enjoyed my science classes the most, which is why I have also pursued research and a minor in Biology.\n\nProudest accomplishments: I am proud of a lot of what I have done at Behrend, especially since so many things were new for me. I held executive board positions in multiple clubs, became a Schreyer scholar and completed a thesis, became a tutor, and won scholarships. But the thing I’ll carry with me are the relationships I made with students, staff, and faculty that have shaped my time at Behrend and the trajectory of my future.\n\nInvolvement: I am the treasurer of Scrubs Club, a pre-health club that exposes students to different disciplines within the field of healthcare through guest speakers, advising, and volunteer opportunities. I joined Cultural Cooking Club (CCC) my first year and have served as everything from secretary to president of the club. CCC’s mission is to explore the world and its many cultures through the lens of regional and national dishes.\n\nAwards: In 2019, I received the Evan Pugh Scholar Award, which is given to the top five juniors and seniors.\n\nDon’t give up: I eventually joined the Schreyer Honors College during my junior year, which proves that just because one path to your goal is blocked, doesn’t mean another one won’t open up.\n\nThe good life, defined: A good life involves happiness, fulfillment, and purpose in whatever forms those come in. Material possessions, recognition, and even your GPA often steal the spotlight, but at the end of the day, our close personal relationships are our greatest legacy and what I believe matter the most.\n\nHe’s a music man: Beyond science and medicine, I love music. I think it’s amazing that combinations of sound can have such a profound an effect on us and be so evocative. I’d like to learn how to play a few instruments now that I’ll have more free time.\n\nAdvice for new students: Get organized before the semester starts. Email your professor before the semester starts to ask if you actually need to buy the textbook for the class (most will be honest). Use Google Calendar (or something similar) to keep your schedule organized – it’s free, easy to use, and synchs across devices.\n\nFollowing his graduation in May, Grant plans to take time for a cross-country solo trip to explore more of the country and scout locations where he might want to live. He’ll then look for a nursing position in a critical care specialty, preferably trauma medicine. He plans to return to school in the future to work on a graduate degree in the sciences or as a nurse anesthetist.\n\nPenn State Behrend’s class of 2022 is ready to make its mark on the world! We’re proud of our students and the things they’ve accomplished and learned while here at Behrend. Over the next several weeks, we’ll be introducing you to a few of our remarkable seniors who have overcome challenges, pioneered new technology, participated in important research projects, and left an impression at Penn State Behrend.\n\nToday, we’d like you to meet: Katrina Stevenson.\n\nMajor: Electrical Engineering\n\nHometown: Cheswick, Pennsylvania\n\nOn choosing Behrend: I wanted to go somewhere away from my hometown, but close enough to go home on weekends. Behrend’s Electrical Engineering program also has a great reputation.\n\nOn choosing her major: I chose Electrical Engineering because it was the engineering discipline that I knew the least about, but was interested in.\n\nCampus involvement: I am involved in Behrend Engineering Ambassadors, Society of Women Engineers, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, and the Behrend STEM Mentoring Program.\n\nWhat you would be surprised to know about her: I love to be outdoors! I like to hunt, fish, kayak, hike, and just explore.\n\nHer definition of the good life: One in which you feel accomplished and keep learning. Most importantly, live your life on your terms – put yourself and your goals first and do what makes you happy.\n\nTop priority: Learning as much as I can! As I start my first full time job, I am looking forward to combining my internship experiences with everything I have learned in school and applying it to my position. Continuing to learn is important to me and it gives me a sense of accomplishment.\n\nAdvice for first-year students: You can still be successful if you struggle at the beginning. Don’t give up. Your GPA does not define you. Also, try to get industry experience through internships or co-ops as soon as possible.\n\nAfter her graduation in May, Katrina will begin working as a Product Development Electrical Engineer at Xylem Inc. in Seneca Falls, New York.\n\nPenn State Behrend’s class of 2022 is ready to make its mark on the world! We’re proud of our students and the things they’ve accomplished and learned while here at Behrend. Over the next several weeks, we’ll be introducing you to a few of our remarkable seniors who have overcome challenges, pioneered new technology, participated in important research projects, and left an impression at Penn State Behrend.\n\nToday, we’d like you to meet Jasmine Lewis:\n\nMajor: Psychology\n\nCertificates: Trauma Studies and Behavioral Health and Counseling Psychology\n\nHometown: Fairview, Pennsylvania\n\nScholarships: Behrend Excellence Scholarship.\n\nOn choosing her major: I initially chose Psychology because I wanted to become a therapist.\n\nProudest accomplishment at Behrend: You might expect me to say something related to academics, but I would say that I am most proud about meeting so many wonderful people and taking advantage of experiences that have helped me grow exponentially as a person from when I arrived here four years ago.\n\nCampus involvement: I was a member of the Student Government Association where I served as Secretary of Commuter Affairs and as an upper-class Senator. I was also a Welcome Week Guide for three years and a peer mentor in Belonging@Behrend and the college’s Behrend Excellent Student Transition Mentor Program.\n\nWhat makes her unique: I love volunteering and am especially adept at being a “people-mover” and getting things organized for events. Also, I have my purple belt in Goju-Ryu karate.\n\nSinging in the rain (and sun and clouds and…): I love to sing. If I could sing my way through life, I’d be the happiest woman on Earth.\n\nHer definition of the good life: To me, living the good life means looking at every opportunity, setback, or hurdle in a positive light. There is always something good to be found in every situation, and I live my life looking for positive notes in the things I do.\n\nWhat she’s passionate about: I am incredibly passionate about educating people on mental health and reducing the stigmas associated with it.\n\nAdvice for first-year students: The best thing I ever did was to look at the degree requirements for my major in my first year. I highly recommend working closely with your academic adviser and the amazing staff in the Academic and Career Planning Center to make sure you’re on track. Your “What If?” report is quite literally your best friend (aside from the schedule builder) when it comes to scheduling classes. Some classes I took ended up counting for two or three categories in my degree path. This tool saved me a lot of time and stress.\n\nJasmine has accepted a job with the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) of Erie County, after her graduation in May. She also was accepted into the Disney College Program, which she will participate in from mid-July through February 2023.\n\nPenn State Behrend’s class of 2022 is ready to make its mark on the world! We’re proud of our students and the things they’ve accomplished and learned while here at Behrend. Over the next several weeks, we’ll be introducing you to a few of our remarkable seniors who have overcome challenges, pioneered new technology, participated in important research projects, and left an impression at Penn State Behrend.\n\nToday, we’d like you to meet Taylor Love\n\nMajor: Dual Majoring in Project and Supply Chain Management (PSCM) and Management Information Systems (MIS)\n\nHometown: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nOn choosing Behrend: My dad went to Behrend, so we scheduled a visit and I fell in love. I immediately knew that it was where I was supposed to be.\n\nOn choosing her major: I was drawn to PSCM because of the uncertainty involved. I liked the idea that every day is a new challenge. I then fell into my MIS major after doing some MIS research and realizing I could easily dual major. MIS just seemed like a natural fit for me.\n\nProudest accomplishment at Behrend: I’ve done a lot in my four years at college, but I would have to say the privilege of tutoring other students is something I’m proud of having done. It’s one thing to be able to understand things on your own, but when you can translate that knowledge into helping others, it’s very fulfilling.\n\nCampus involvement: I participated in undergraduate research with Dr. Babajide Osatuyi, assistant professor of MIS, served as a peer tutor, and was an academic mentor for the Black School of Business. I was also a Business Ambassador and president of PSCM Club.\n\nRecognition: I was accepted into and presented my research work at two national conferences—Decision Sciences Institute and The Americas Conference on Information Systems.\n\nShe’s a people-person: I have an innate ability to connect with others. I love getting to know people and I think my personality is open and comforting.\n\nWhat you’d be surprised to know: I struggle a lot with my mental health. I think it’s a very common misconception that people who are deemed successful or high functioning don’t have these issues, but that is not the case. I have generalized anxiety disorder and it’s a battle I fight with myself every day, yet people don’t see it when they look at me.\n\nHer definition of the good life: To me, living a good life is about the journey. I try to live every day of my life as if the next one isn’t guaranteed. I’m big on listening to myself and doing what feels right. I do the things that make me feel fulfilled and I spend time with the people I love.\n\nTop priority: To not stretch myself too thin. I am notorious for taking on too much. I want to make sure the things I’m putting my energy into are things that I’m really passionate about.\n\nA student for life: I absolutely love to learn. I think that to live a well-rounded life, you have to constantly be learning. That doesn’t mean reading ten books a day, it can simply be introspection. I also love teaching others the things that I’ve learned. I think the true value of knowledge comes when you can share it with others.\n\nWhat she wishes she had known as a first-year student: I wish I realized that everything would unfold exactly how it was supposed to. I had this fear of failure and a need to prove myself in this new environment. It caused me a lot of stress, and I wish that I had known it would all work out.\n\nAfter graduation, Taylor will be working at American Eagle Outfitters in Pittsburgh as an Inventory Planning Teammate.\n\nPenn State Behrend’s class of 2022 is ready to make its mark on the world! We’re proud of our students and the things they’ve accomplished and learned while here at Behrend. Over the next several weeks, we’ll be introducing you to a few of our remarkable seniors who have overcome challenges, pioneered new technology, participated in important research projects, and left an impression at Penn State Behrend.\n\nToday, we’d like you to meet Marcus Jacobs:\n\nMajor: Dual majoring in Business Economics and International Business\n\nHometown: Mount Washington in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nScholarships: Bayard D. and Ethel M. Kunkle Scholarship, Pathway to Success: Summer Start Scholarship, Behrend Faculty and Staff Scholarship, and the Lawrence and Elizabeth Held Scholarship.\n\nWhy he chose Behrend: In a way, I didn’t. I originally went to a community college in Pittsburgh. There, I had the opportunity to tour several universities. Penn State’s University Park stood out to me, and I applied. Because I was a transfer student, I had to do a 2 + 2 program (two years at a Commonwealth campus and two years at University Park). I chose Behrend, but within three weeks of being here, I knew I wanted to stay.\n\nDecision made, period: The faculty relationships I had made in just a month, the energy that I experienced at Behrend, and the plethora of opportunities available made up my mind. I am a decisive person so when I decided that I was staying, that was that.\n\nOn Business Econ: Unlike many other schools, Behrend houses the Economics program in its business school, so there is a particular focus on the business applications of economics, which was of most interest to me. I have been particularly interested in the field of Behavioral Economics, which studies decisions being made in real-world situations that might not line up with the expectations set forth by the traditional Economic view.\n\nOn International Business: I.B. is a concurrent major that must be taken in combination with another business major. This allows you to get two degrees with just a few extra courses.\n\nCan talk and walk backwards: I have been a Lion Ambassador since the fall semester of my first year. In that time, I have served as historian and treasurer. I got to call Midnight Bingo twice, and I have given countless tours around the campus. I am very good at walking backward around campus.\n\nVirtual tour leads to research work: After spearheading a virtual tour of Behrend, I got involved with the college’s Virtual Augmented Reality (VAR) Lab, which is directed by Dr. Chris Shelton, assistant professor of clinical psychology. I’ve been working as a student researcher and project manager in the VAR Lab for the past year and a half.\n\nHike the gorge with Marcus: One of the projects I’m most proud of is a virtual hike through Wintergreen Gorge. I had the chance to work with all types of unique hardware and software while working on it, and my “office” was the great outdoors for several weeks in early summer. I even presented it at a Penn State Alumni Association WE ARE Weekend virtual event. I’m currently working on a four-seasons tour of Wintergreen Gorge.\n\nHe’s an idea guy who can take the lead: I really enjoy brainstorming. I love to think of visual improvements that I would like to see in the world and look at them from many different angles, then loop in a lot of different individuals to ensure a well-rounded solution. That is why I decided to pursue a graduate degree in project management. I’ve learned that the most fulfilling work for me is moving a project along, pushing it as far as I can before passing it on to those who come after me.\n\nThrill seeker: I have been skydiving and white-water rafting. (Watch us on the water in 360 here.) Also, the first time I ever went tent camping, it was along a 10-mile section of the Appalachian Trail in the mountains between Tennessee and North Carolina…in January…with a couple of friends as inexperienced as I was. I’m proud to say that I planned that trip, and it included a second and third day with an additional 16 miles of hiking (optimistic in hindsight, I know). I maintain that I’d have finished that trip if my friends hadn’t chickened out after one night in 26 degrees. We high-tailed it out of there that morning and caught a shuttle back to the car.\n\nHis definition of the good life: Surrounded by nature with the self-sufficient infrastructure around me that is necessary for comfortable off-the-grid living. Alaska, here I come!\n\nWhat he’s passionate about: My involvement in the VAR Lab at Behrend. I believe in our collective vision, and I believe that we provide value and fill a gap in the emerging immersive technologies space.\n\nAdvice for first-year students: Whenever I see this question asked of a senior or alumni, they say “get involved.” All can say is that I’ve been fairly involved since day one here, and I still feel like I ran out of time. So, yes, get involved, the sooner the better. And don’t be afraid to try something completely out of your wheelhouse. If I hadn’t, I might never have gotten involved in immersive experiences or mixed/extended reality (XR).\n\nMarcus is not quite done at Penn State. After his graduation in May, he will pursue a Master of Project Management degree, which is administered by Penn State Behrend through World Campus."
