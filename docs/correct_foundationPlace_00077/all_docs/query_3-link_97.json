Under the terms of the agreement, Ansys shareholders will receive $197.00 in cash and 0.3450 shares of Synopsys common stock for each Ansys share, representing an enterprise value of approximately $35 billion based on the closing price of Synopsys common stock on December 21, 20233. Bringing together Synopsys' pioneering semiconductor electronic design automation (EDA) with Ansys' broad simulation and analysis portfolio will create a leader in silicon to systems design solutions.\n\n\"The megatrends of AI, silicon proliferation and software-defined systems are requiring more compute performance and efficiency in the face of growing, systemic complexity. Bringing together Synopsys' industry-leading EDA solutions with Ansys' world-class simulation and analysis capabilities will enable us to deliver a holistic, powerful and seamlessly integrated silicon to systems approach to innovation to help maximize the capabilities of technology R&D teams across a broad range of industries,\" said Sassine Ghazi, President and CEO of Synopsys. \"This is the logical next step for our successful, seven-year partnership with Ansys and I look forward to working closely with Ajei and the talented Ansys team to realize the benefits of this combination for our customers, shareholders and employees.\"\n\n\"Since inception 37 years ago, Synopsys has been an innovation pioneer, central to world-changing semiconductor advances in computation, networking, and mobility, and now enabling the new era of 'pervasive intelligence',\" said Aart de Geus, Executive Chair and Founder of Synopsys. \"Joining forces with Ansys, a company we know well from our long-standing partnership, is the latest example of how Synopsys remains at the forefront. Our Board and management team carefully evaluated our top strategic options to lead and win in this fast-growing new wave of electronics and system design. The technology-broadening team-up with Ansys is an ideal, value-enhancing step for our company, our shareholders, and the innovative customers we serve.\"\n\n\"For more than 50 years, Ansys has enabled customers to design, develop and deliver cutting-edge products that are limited only by imagination. By joining forces with Synopsys, we will amplify our joint efforts to drive new levels of customer innovation,\" said Ajei Gopal, President and CEO of Ansys. \"This transformative combination brings together each company's highly complementary capabilities to meet the evolving needs of today's engineers and give them unprecedented insight into the performance of their products. Ansys has a strong foundation, as demonstrated by preliminary annual contract value (\"ACV\") results for Q4 that are expected to exceed the high end of our guidance, and I am confident that building on our partnership with Synopsys will position us well to deliver even greater value for our customers, partners and shareholders. The combined company will accelerate the development of our joint portfolio and deliver an increased level of innovation, which will benefit Ansys' traditional customers. I am proud of all that our employees do every day to make Ansys and our customers successful and look forward to the combined company achieving even greater heights in this next chapter.\"\n\nCompelling Rationale and Significant Value Creation\n\nCombining Leading Capabilities to Meet Customer Demand: The complexity of today's intelligent systems demands the integration of semiconductor design and simulation and analysis to ensure interconnected systems function properly in real-world settings. Combining Synopsys' EDA technology with Ansys' established simulation and analysis capabilities can provide customers a comprehensive, powerful and system-focused approach to innovation. All Ansys customers, including those outside of the semiconductor industry, can benefit from access to a comprehensive portfolio of products and technologies that will drive innovation.\n\nAccelerates Strategy and Growth in Attractive, Adjacent Areas: Synopsys and Ansys have highly complementary businesses and significant expansion opportunities. The combination will enhance Synopsys' Silicon to Systems strategy both across the core EDA segment and in highly attractive adjacent growth areas such as Automotive, Aerospace and Industrial, among others, where Ansys has an established presence and successful go-to-market experience.\n\nComplementary Fit: Synopsys and Ansys have had a successful and growing partnership since 2017, and share a culture built on integrity, execution excellence and empowering customers. Combining their highly complementary solutions is expected to provide customers with a broader, deeply integrated suite of software tools to solve their most difficult design challenges while also gaining valuable insights through model-based analysis of complex systems.\n\nMeaningfully Expands Total Addressable Market: Synopsys' total addressable market (TAM) is expected to increase by 1.5x to approximately $28 billion. This combined TAM is expected to grow at roughly an 11% CAGR4, driven by megatrends accelerating the need for the fusion of electronics and physics across industries.\n\nBolsters Synopsys' Strong Financial Position and Outlook: The combination is expected to strengthen Synopsys' financial profile. The combined company expects to continue its industry-leading, double-digit growth, which is expected to outpace TAM growth. The combination is expected to expand Synopsys' non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 125 basis points and unlevered free cash flow margins by approximately 75 basis points the first full year post-closing. The combination is expected to be accretive to non-GAAP EPS within the second full year post-closing and substantially accretive thereafter.\n\nStrong Balance Sheet Supporting Rapid Deleveraging: The combined company is expected to generate substantial and sustained free cash flow, which will enable rapid de-leveraging to less than 2x debt to Adjusted EBITDA within two years post-closing, with a long-term leverage target of less than 1x. Synopsys expects to maintain investment grade credit ratings given its strong cash flow generation and commitment to rapidly de-lever.\n\nDelivers Cost and Revenue Synergies: The combined company expects to achieve approximately $400 million of run-rate cost synergies by year three post-closing and approximately $400 million of run-rate revenue synergies by year four post-closing, growing to more than approximately $1 billion annually in the longer-term.\n\nTransaction Terms\n\nThe implied per share consideration of $390.19, based on the closing price of Synopsys common stock of $559.96 as of December 21, 2023, represents a premium of approximately 29% over Ansys' closing stock price on December 21, 20235 and a premium of approximately 35% to Ansys' 60-day volume-weighted average price for the period ending on the same date. Under the terms of the agreement, Ansys shareholders are expected to own approximately 16.5% of the combined company on a pro forma basis.\n\nSynopsys intends to fund the $19 billion6 of cash consideration through a combination of its cash on hand and debt financing. Synopsys has obtained $16 billion of fully committed debt financing.\n\nThe transaction is anticipated to close in the first half of 2025, subject to approval by Ansys shareholders, the receipt of required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\n\nAdvisors\n\nEvercore is serving as financial advisor to Synopsys and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP is serving as legal advisor. Qatalyst Partners LP is serving as financial advisor to Ansys and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Goodwin Procter LLP are serving as legal advisors.\n\nConference Call\n\nThe two companies will host a joint conference call on January 16, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. (ET) to discuss the announcement.

No offering of securities shall be made, except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\n\nThis document includes certain forward looking financial measures that are not in accordance with the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\").\n\nAdjusted EBITDA (\"Adj. EBITDA\") is calculated as GAAP Operating Income excluding depreciation and amortization, stock compensation, non-qualified deferred compensation plan, acquisition-related costs and restructuring charges\n\nFree Cash Flow (\"FCF\") is calculated as cash provided from operating activities less capital expenditures and capitalization of software development costs\n\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow (\"uFCF\") is calculated as Free Cash Flow excluding tax-effected cash net interest\n\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow Margin is calculated as Unlevered Free Cash Flow for a period divided by revenue for the same period\n\nNon-GAAP Earnings Per Share (\"EPS\") is calculated as GAAP net income excluding amortization of intangible assets, stock compensation, acquisition-related costs, restructuring charges, and legal matters, adjusted for the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates, divided by fully diluted outstanding shares\n\nNon-GAAP Operating Income is calculated as GAAP Operating Income, excluding amortization of intangible assets, stock compensation, non-qualified deferred compensation plan, acquisition-related costs and restructuring charges\n\nNon-GAAP Operating Margin is Non-GAAP Operating income for a period divided by revenue for the same period\n\nSynopsys and Ansys present non-GAAP financial measures to provide their investors with an additional tool to evaluate Synopsys' and Ansys' respective operating results in a manner that focuses on what Synopsys and Ansys each believe to be their respective core business operations and what Synopsys and Ansys each use to evaluate their respective business operations and for internal budgeting and resource allocation purposes. These non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, and management exercises judgment in determining which items should be excluded in the calculation of non-GAAP measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation from, as superior to or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, the corresponding GAAP financial measures.\n\nWhen possible with respect to non-GAAP financial measures presented with respect to historical periods, Synopsys and Ansys, respectively, provide a reconciliation of their historic non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely applicable GAAP financial measures in the documents filed by Synopsys and Ansys with the SEC. Synopsys and Ansys, respectively, are unable to provide a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP guidance measures to the corresponding GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis because doing so would not be possible without unreasonable effort due to, among other things, the potential variability and limited visibility of the excluded items and expectations as to the financial of performance of each of Synopsys and Ansys upon the completion of the mergers. For the same reasons, Synopsys and Ansys are each unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Synopsys and Ansys are presenting forward looking non-GAAP financial measures for illustrative purposes and may not report on this basis going forward.\n\nCombined company measures for historical periods are based on combining Synopsys' historical financial results and Ansys' historical or preliminary financial results, as applicable, without pro forma adjustments and are included for illustrative purposes in order to provide investors with estimates of what the combined company results could have been. Combined company estimates are not pro forma financial measures, are not prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and are not necessarily indicative of the results that actually would have been realized had Synopsys and Ansys been a single entity during the relevant periods.\n\nOther Key Business Metrics\n\nAnnual Contract Value (\"ACV\") is a key performance metric for Ansys and is useful to investors in assessing the strength and trajectory of the business. ACV is a supplemental metric to help evaluate the annual performance of the business. Over the life of the contract, ACV equals the total value realized from a customer. ACV is not impacted by the timing of license revenue recognition. ACV is used by Ansys' management in financial and operational decision-making and in setting sales targets used for compensation. ACV is not a replacement for, and should be viewed independently of, GAAP revenue and deferred revenue as ACV is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. There is no GAAP measure comparable to ACV.\n\nACV is composed of the following: 1) the annualized value of maintenance and subscription lease contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period, plus; 2) the value of perpetual license contracts with start dates during the period, plus; 3) the annualized value of fixed-term services contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period, plus; 4) the value of work performed during the period on fixed-deliverable services contracts.\n\n1 Compound annual growth rate from FY 2023 to 2028.\n\n2 Expected to be accretive in second full year post-close including cost synergies only, substantially accretive thereafter including cost and revenue synergies.\n\n3 The last trading day prior to media speculation regarding a potential transaction.\n\n4 Compound annual growth rate from FY 2023 to 2028.\n\n5 The last trading day prior to media speculation regarding a potential transaction.\n\n6 Includes the refinancing of Ansys' existing debt and transaction expenses.\n\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/synopsys-to-acquire-ansys-creating-a-leader-in-silicon-to-systems-design-solutions-302035724.html\n\nSOURCE Synopsys, Inc."
