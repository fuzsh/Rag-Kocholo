The eventual purpose of the effort is to develop a methodology that harmonizes RF-modeling and RF-testing protocol for use in RF exposure assessment. In this phase of the study, numerical and experimental data were collected from four laboratories for unloaded and loaded coil conditions. Only information about the geometry and resonance frequency of the physical coil was provided. Qualitatively good agreement across all teams was found. Subsequent phases of the study shall include a methodology on uncertainty analysis associated with the numerical and experimental methods that can be used in practice"
