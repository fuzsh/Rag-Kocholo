S.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nA large scale, general purpose finite element computer program, ANSYS, developed and marketed by Swanson Analysis Systems, Inc. is discussed. ANSYS was perhaps the first commercially available program to offer truly interactive finite element model generation. ANSYS's purpose is for solid modeling. This application is briefly discussed and illustrated.\n\nANSYS duplicate finite-element checker routine\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nOrtega, R.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nAn ANSYS finite-element code routine to check for duplicated elements within the volume of a three-dimensional (3D) finite-element mesh was developed. The routine developed is used for checking floating elements within a mesh, identically duplicated elements, and intersecting elements with a common face. A space shuttle main engine alternate turbopump development high pressure oxidizer turbopump finite-element model check using the developed subroutine is discussed. Finally, recommendations are provided for duplicate element checking of 3D finite-element models.\n\nVALIDATION OF ANSYS FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS SOFTWARE\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHAMM, E.R.\n\n2003-06-27\n\nThis document provides a record of the verification and Validation of the ANSYS Version 7.0 software that is installed on selected CH2M HILL computers. The issues addressed include: Software verification, installation, validation, configuration management and error reporting. The ANSYS{reg_sign} computer program is a large scale multi-purpose finite element program which may be used for solving several classes of engineering analysis. The analysis capabilities of ANSYS Full Mechanical Version 7.0 installed on selected CH2M Hill Hanford Group (CH2M HILL) Intel processor based computers include the ability to solve static and dynamic structural analyses, steady-state and transient heat transfer problems, mode-frequency andmoreÂ Â» buckling eigenvalue problems, static or time-varying magnetic analyses and various types of field and coupled-field applications. The program contains many special features which allow nonlinearities or secondary effects to be included in the solution, such as plasticity, large strain, hyperelasticity, creep, swelling, large deflections, contact, stress stiffening, temperature dependency, material anisotropy, and thermal radiation. The ANSYS program has been in commercial use since 1970, and has been used extensively in the aerospace, automotive, construction, electronic, energy services, manufacturing, nuclear, plastics, oil and steel industries.Â«Â less\n\n[Finite Element Analysis of Intravascular Stent Based on ANSYS Software].\n\nPubMed\n\nShi, Gengqiang; Song, Xiaobing\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThis paper adopted UG8.0 to bulid the stent and blood vessel models. The models were then imported into the finite element analysis software ANSYS. The simulation results of ANSYS software showed that after endothelial stent implantation, the velocity of the blood was slow and the fluctuation of velocity was small, which meant the flow was relatively stable. When blood flowed through the endothelial stent, the pressure gradually became smaller, and the range of the pressure was not wide. The endothelial shear stress basically unchanged. In general, it can be concluded that the endothelial stents have little impact on the flow of blood and can fully realize its function.\n\nNumerical modeling of continuous flow microwave heating: a critical comparison of COMSOL and ANSYS.\n\nPubMed\n\nSalvi, D; Boldor, Dorin; Ortego, J; Aita, G M; Sabliov, C M\n\n2010-01-01\n\nNumerical models were developed to simulate temperature profiles in Newtonian fluids during continuous flow microwave heating by one way coupling electromagnetism, fluid flow, and heat transport in ANSYS 8.0 and COMSOL Multiphysics v3.4. Comparison of the results from the COMSOL model with the results from a pre-developed and validated ANSYS model ensured accuracy of the COMSOL model. Prediction of power Loss by both models was in close agreement (5-13% variation) and the predicted temperature profiles were similar. COMSOL provided a flexible model setup whereas ANSYS required coupling incompatible elements to transfer load between electromagnetic, fluid flow, and heat transport modules. Overall, both software packages provided the ability to solve multiphysics phenomena accurately.\n\nA finite-element study of a piezoelectric/poroelastic sound package concept\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBatifol, C.; Zielinski, T. G.; Ichchou, M. N.; Galland, M.-A.\n\n2007-02-01\n\nThis paper presents a complete finite-element description of a hybrid passive/active sound package concept for acoustic insulation. The sandwich created includes a poroelastic core and piezoelectric patches to ensure high panel performance over the medium/high and low frequencies, respectively. All layers are modelled thanks to a Comsol environmentComsol is the new name of the finite element software previously called Femlab.. The piezoelectric/elastic and poroelastic/elastic coupling are fully considered. The study highlights the reliability of the model by comparing results with those obtained from the Ansys finite-element software and with analytical developments. The chosen shape functions and mesh convergence rate for each layer are discussed in terms of dynamic behaviour. Several layer configurations are then tested, with the aim of designing the panel and its hybrid functionality in an optimal manner. The differences in frequency responses are discussed from a physical perspective. Lastly, an initial experimental test shows the concept to be promising.\n\nDefinition of Availability Index of Deformed Building Constructions Using the Finite - Element Analysis Package\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShutova, M. N.; Skibin, G. M.; Evtushenko, S. I.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe paper is devoted to the problem of definition of availability index of deforming building construction in atypical cases. The authors revealed a real applicability of the finite-elements analyses package, such as ANSYS, for engineering testing calculations of building constructions and determination of the sites of increased stresses. It was determined that stresses increased up to 7.75 times in the sites with mechanical defects (for steel crane girder); also, the authors revealed the convergence of the calculation results between the finite element method and a usual decision using the strength of materials (in the limits 2-14% for steel truss frame). The equivalent stresses donât exceed the maximum permissible tension for this type of steel. The building constructions have a limited availability index.\n\nA Novel Arterial Constitutive Model in a Commercial Finite Element Package: Application to Balloon Angioplasty\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhao, Xuefeng; Liu, Yi; Zhang, Wei; Wang, Cong; Kassab, Ghassan S.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nRecently, a novel linearized constitutive model with a new strain measure that absorbs the material nonlinearity was validated for arteries. In this study, the linearized arterial stress-strain relationship is implemented into a finite element method package ANSYS, via the user subroutine USERMAT. The reference configuration is chosen to be the closed cylindrical tube (no-load state) rather than the open sector (zero-stress state). The residual strain is taken into account by analytic calculation and the incompressibility condition is enforced with Lagrange penalty method. Axisymmetric finite element analyses are conducted to demonstrate potential applications of this approach in a complex boundary value problem where angioplasty balloon interacts with the vessel wall. The model predictions of transmural circumferential and compressive radial stress distributions were also validated against an exponential-type Fung model, and the mean error was found to be within 6%.

Structural analyses of container ship's cargo holds are carried out for the balancing of their safety and capacity, as those ships are exposed to the high risk of structural damage during voyage. Two different design methodologies have been considered for the structural analysis of a container ship's cargo hold. One is rule-based methodology and the other is a more conventional software based analyses. The rule based analysis is done by DNV-GL's software POSEIDON and the conventional package based analysis is done by ANSYS structural module. Both methods have been applied to analyze some of the mechanical properties of the model such as total deformation, stress-strain distribution, Von Mises stress, Fatigue etc., following different design bases and approaches, to indicate some guidance's for further improvements in ship structural design.\n\n3-D Analysis of Flanged Joints Through Various Preload Methods Using ANSYS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMurugan, Jeyaraj Paul; Kurian, Thomas; Jayaprakash, Janardhan; Sreedharapanickar, Somanath\n\n2015-10-01\n\nFlanged joints are being employed in aerospace solid rocket motor hardware for the integration of various systems or subsystems. Hence, the design of flanged joints is very important in ensuring the integrity of motor while functioning. As these joints are subjected to higher loads due to internal pressure acting inside the motor chamber, an appropriate preload is required to be applied in this joint before subjecting it to the external load. Preload, also known as clamp load, is applied on the fastener and helps to hold the mating flanges together. Generally preload is simulated as a thermal load and the exact preload is obtained through number of iterations. Infact, more iterations are required when considering the material nonlinearity of the bolt. This way of simulation will take more computational time for generating the required preload. Now a days most commercial software packages use pretension elements for simulating the preload. This element does not require iterations for inducing the preload and it can be solved with single iteration. This approach takes less computational time and thus one can study the characteristics of the joint easily by varying the preload. When the structure contains more number of joints with different sizes of fasteners, pretension elements can be used compared to thermal load approach for simulating each size of fastener. This paper covers the details of analyses carried out simulating the preload through various options viz., preload through thermal, initial state command and pretension element etc. using ANSYS finite element package.\n\nAnalysis of composite plates by using mechanics of structure genome and comparison with ANSYS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhao, Banghua\n\nMotivated by a recently discovered concept, Structure Genome (SG) which is defined as the smallest mathematical building block of a structure, a new approach named Mechanics of Structure Genome (MSG) to model and analyze composite plates is introduced. MSG is implemented in a general-purpose code named SwiftComp(TM), which provides the constitutive models needed in structural analysis by homogenization and pointwise local fields by dehomogenization. To improve the user friendliness of SwiftComp(TM), a simple graphic user interface (GUI) based on ANSYS Mechanical APDL platform, called ANSYS-SwiftComp GUI is developed, which provides a convenient way to create some common SG models or arbitrary customized SG models in ANSYS and invoke SwiftComp(TM) to perform homogenization and dehomogenization. The global structural analysis can also be handled in ANSYS after homogenization, which could predict the global behavior and provide needed inputs for dehomogenization. To demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the MSG approach, several numerical cases are studied and compared using both MSG and ANSYS. In the ANSYS approach, 3D solid element models (ANSYS 3D approach) are used as reference models and the 2D shell element models created by ANSYS Composite PrepPost (ACP approach) are compared with the MSG approach. The results of the MSG approach agree well with the ANSYS 3D approach while being as efficient as the ACP approach. Therefore, the MSG approach provides an efficient and accurate new way to model composite plates.\n\nMaterials in Manufacturing and Packaging Systems as Sources of Elemental Impurities in Packaged Drug Products: A Literature Review.\n\nPubMed\n\nJenke, Dennis R; Stults, Cheryl L M; Paskiet, Diane M; Ball, Douglas J; Nagao, Lee M\n\nElemental impurities in drug products can arise from a number of different sources and via a number of different means, including the active pharmaceutical ingredient, excipients, the vehicle, and leaching of elemental entities that are present in the drug product's manufacturing or packaging systems. Thus, knowledge about the presence, level, and likelihood of leaching of elemental entities in manufacturing and packaging systems is relevant to understanding how these systems contribute to a drug product's total elemental impurity burden. To that end, a joint team from the Extractables and Leachables Safety Information Exchange (ELSIE) Consortium and the International Pharmaceutical Aerosol Consortium on Regulation and Science (IPAC-RS) has conducted a review of the available literature on elemental entities in pharmaceutically relevant polymers and the presence of these elemental entities in material extracts and/or drug products. This review article contains the information compiled from the available body of literature and considers two questions: (1) What elemental entities are present in the relevant polymers and materials and at what levels are they present? (2) To what extent are these elemental entities leached from these materials under conditions relevant to the manufacturing and storage/distribution of solution drug products? Conclusions drawn from the compiled data are as follows: (1) Elemental entities are present in the materials used to construct packaging and manufacturing systems as these materials either contain these elemental entities as additives or are exposed to elemental entities during their production. (2) Unless the elemental entities are parts of the materials themselves (for example, SiO 2 in glass) or intentionally added to the materials (for example, metal stearates in polymers), their incidental amounts in the materials are generally low. (3) When elemental entities are present in materials and systems, generally only a very small\n\nCeramic material life prediction: A program to translate ANSYS results to CARES/LIFE reliability analysis\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nVonhermann, Pieter; Pintz, Adam\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThis manual describes the use of the ANSCARES program to prepare a neutral file of FEM stress results taken from ANSYS Release 5.0, in the format needed by CARES/LIFE ceramics reliability program. It is intended for use by experienced users of ANSYS and CARES. Knowledge of compiling and linking FORTRAN programs is also required. Maximum use is made of existing routines (from other CARES interface programs and ANSYS routines) to extract the finite element results and prepare the neutral file for input to the reliability analysis. FORTRAN and machine language routines as described are used to read the ANSYS results file. Sub-element stresses are computed and written to a neutral file using FORTRAN subroutines which are nearly identical to those used in the NASCARES (MSC/NASTRAN to CARES) interface.\n\nInfluence of different materials on the thermal behavior of a CDIP-8 ceramic package\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWeide, Kirsten; Keck, Christian\n\n1999-08-01\n\nThe temperature distribution inside a package is determined by the heat transfer from the package to the ambient, depending on the heat conductivities of the different used materials. With the help of finite element simulations the thermal behavior of the package can be characterized. In precise simulations convection and radiation effects have to be taken into account. In this paper the influence of different materials like the ceramic, the pin and die attach material and adhesive material between the chip and the die attach on the thermal resistance of the ceramic package will be investigated. A finite element model of the ceramic package including a voltage regulator on the chip was created. The simulations were carried out with the finite element program ANSYS. An easy way to take the radiation effect into account, which normally is difficult to handle in the simulation, will be shown. The results of the simulations are verified by infrared measurements. A comparison of the thermal resistance between the best case and worst case for different package materials was done. The thermal conductivity of the ceramic material shows the strongest influence on the thermal resistance.\n\ncis-Acting elements important for retroviral RNA packaging specificity.\n\nPubMed\n\nBeasley, Benjamin E; Hu, Wei-Shau\n\n2002-05-01\n\nSpleen necrosis virus (SNV) proteins can package RNA from distantly related murine leukemia virus (MLV), whereas MLV proteins cannot package SNV RNA efficiently. We used this nonreciprocal recognition to investigate regions of packaging signals that influence viral RNA encapsidation specificity. Although the MLV and SNV packaging signals (Psi and E, respectively) do not contain significant sequence homology, they both contain a pair of hairpins. This hairpin pair was previously proposed to be the core element in MLV Psi. In the present study, MLV-based vectors were generated to contain chimeric SNV/MLV packaging signals in which the hairpins were replaced with the heterologous counterpart. The interactions between these chimeras and MLV or SNV proteins were examined by virus replication and RNA analyses. SNV proteins recognized all of the chimeras, indicating that these chimeras were functional. We found that replacing the hairpin pair did not drastically alter the ability of MLV proteins to package these chimeras. These results indicate that, despite the important role of the hairpin pair in RNA packaging, it is not the major motif responsible for the ability of MLV proteins to discriminate between the MLV and SNV packaging signals. To determine the role of sequences flanking the hairpins in RNA packaging specificity, vectors with swapped flanking regions were generated and evaluated. SNV proteins packaged all of these chimeras efficiently. In contrast, MLV proteins strongly favored chimeras with the MLV 5'-flanking regions. These data indicated that MLV Gag recognizes multiple elements in the viral packaging signal, including the hairpin structure and flanking regions.\n\nANSYS UIDL-Based CAE Development of Axial Support System for Optical Mirror\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYang, De-Hua; Shao, Liang\n\n2008-09-01\n\nThe Whiffle-tree type axial support mechanism is widely adopted by most relatively large optical mirrors. Based on the secondary developing tools offered by the commonly used Finite Element Anylysis (FEA) software ANSYS, ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL) is used for creating the mirror FEA model driven by parameters, and ANSYS User Interface Design Language (UIDL) for generating custom menu of interactive manner, whereby, the relatively independent dedicated Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) module is embedded in ANSYS for calculation and optimization of axial Whiffle-tree support of optical mirrors. An example is also described to illustrate the intuitive and effective usage of the dedicated module by boosting work efficiency and releasing related engineering knowledge of user. The philosophy of secondary-developed special module with commonly used software also suggests itself for product development in other industries.\n\nSandia/Stanford Unified Creep Plasticity Damage Model for ANSYS\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPierce, David M.; Vianco, Paul T.; Fossum, Arlo F.\n\n2006-09-03\n\nA unified creep plasticity (UCP) model was developed, based upon the time-dependent and time-independent deformation properties of the 95.5Sn-3.9Ag-0.6Cu (wt.%) soldier that were measured at Sandia. Then, a damage parameter, D, was added to the equation to develop the unified creep plasticity damage (UCPD) model. The parameter, D, was parameterized, using data obtained at Sandia from isothermal fatigue experiments on a double-lap shear test. The softwae was validated against a BGA solder joint exposed to thermal cycling. The UCPD model was put into the ANSYS finite element as a subroutine. So, the softwae is the subroutine for ANSYS 8.1.\n\nANSYS Modeling of Hydrostatic Stress Effects\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAllen, Phillip A.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nClassical metal plasticity theory assumes that hydrostatic pressure has no effect on the yield and postyield behavior of metals. Plasticity textbooks, from the earliest to the most modem, infer that there is no hydrostatic effect on the yielding of metals, and even modem finite element programs direct the user to assume the same. The object of this study is to use the von Mises and Drucker-Prager failure theory constitutive models in the finite element program ANSYS to see how well they model conditions of varying hydrostatic pressure. Data is presented for notched round bar (NRB) and \"L\" shaped tensile specimens. Similar results from finite element models in ABAQUS are shown for comparison. It is shown that when dealing with geometries having a high hydrostatic stress influence, constitutive models that have a functional dependence on hydrostatic stress are more accurate in predicting material behavior than those that are independent of hydrostatic stress.\n\nUSSAERO version D computer program development using ANSI standard FORTRAN 77 and DI-3000 graphics\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWiese, M.

The research target -the development method of modeling startup and shutdown transient of the micro linear piezo drive. This method is based on application software package ANSYS. The method embraces a detailed description of the calculation stages to determine the operating characteristics of the designed piezo drive. Based on the numerical solutions, the time characteristics of the designed piezo drive are determined.\n\nDetermining Permissible Oxygen and Water Vapor Transmission Rate for Non-Retort Military Ration Packaging\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2011-11-01\n\nOXYGEN AND WATER VAPOR TRANSMISSION RATE FOR NON- RETORT MILITARY RATION PACKAGING by Danielle Froio Alan Wright Nicole Favreau and Sarah...ANSI Std.

Three types of Aluminum alloys (5052-H32, 6061-T6 and 7075-T6) were selected for investigation of the structure under design loads. Finite element analysis (FEA) in design static load of 51 g was performed. The natural frequencies for five modes were estimated using modal analysis. In order to ensure that KufaSat could withstand with various conditions during launch, the Margin of safety was calculated. The results of deformation and Von Mises stress for linear buckling analysis were also performed. The comparison of data was done to select the optimum material for KufaSat structures.\n\nPrompt gamma neutron activation analysis of toxic elements in radioactive waste packages.\n\nPubMed\n\nMa, J-L; Carasco, C; Perot, B; Mauerhofer, E; Kettler, J; Havenith, A\n\n2012-07-01\n\nThe French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) and National Radioactive Waste Management Agency (ANDRA) are conducting an R&D program to improve the characterization of long-lived and medium activity (LL-MA) radioactive waste packages. In particular, the amount of toxic elements present in radioactive waste packages must be assessed before they can be accepted in repository facilities in order to avoid pollution of underground water reserves. To this aim, the Nuclear Measurement Laboratory of CEA-Cadarache has started to study the performances of Prompt Gamma Neutron Activation Analysis (PGNAA) for elements showing large capture cross sections such as mercury, cadmium, boron, and chromium. This paper reports a comparison between Monte Carlo calculations performed with the MCNPX computer code using the ENDF/B-VII.0 library and experimental gamma rays measured in the REGAIN PGNAA cell with small samples of nickel, lead, cadmium, arsenic, antimony, chromium, magnesium, zinc, boron, and lithium to verify the validity of a numerical model and gamma-ray production data. The measurement of a â¼20kg test sample of concrete containing toxic elements has also been performed, in collaboration with Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich, to validate the model in view of future performance studies for dense and large LL-MA waste packages.

This article will describe the work for the static analysis of a hull plate. We shall use the software package ANSYS Mechanical 14.5. The program is run on a computer with four Intel Xeon X5260 CPU processors at 3.33 GHz, 32 GB memory installed. In terms of software, the shared memory parallel version of ANSYS refers to running ANSYS across multiple cores on a SMP system. The distributed memory parallel version of ANSYS (Distributed ANSYS) refers to running ANSYS across multiple processors on SMP systems or DMP systems.\n\nNew ANSI standard for thyroid phantom\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nMallett, Michael W.; Bolch, Wesley E.; Fulmer, Philip C.; ...\n\n2015-08-01\n\nHere, a new ANSI standard titled âThyroid Phantom Used in Occupational Monitoringâ (Health Physics Society 2014) has been published. The standard establishes the criteria for acceptable design, fabrication, or modeling of a phantom suitable for calibrating in vivo monitoring systems to measure photon-emitting radionuclides deposited in the thyroid. The current thyroid phantom standard was drafted in 1973 (ANSI N44.3-1973), last reviewed in 1984, and a revision of the standard to cover a more modern approach was deemed warranted.\n\nDevelopment and testing of a numerical simulation method for thermally nonequilibrium dissociating flows in ANSYS Fluent\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShoev, G.

V.\n\n2016-03-01\n\nVarious issues of numerical simulation of supersonic gas flows with allowance for thermochemical nonequilibrium on the basis of fluid dynamic equations in the two-temperature approximation are discussed. The computational tool for modeling flows with thermochemical nonequilibrium is the commercial software package ANSYS Fluent with an additional userdefined open-code module. A comparative analysis of results obtained by various models of vibration-dissociation coupling in binary gas mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen is performed. Results of numerical simulations are compared with available experimental data.\n\nAnalysis of Vibrational Harmonic Response for Printing Double-Sheet Detecting System via ANSYS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGuo, Qiang; Cai, Ji-Fei; Wang, Yan; Zhang, Yang\n\nIn order to explore the influence of the harmonic response of system vibration upon the stability of the double-sheet detector system, the mathematical model of vibrational system is established via the mechanical dynamic theory. Vibrational system of double-sheet detector is studied by theoretical modeling, and the dynamic simulation to obtain the amplitude/phase frequency response curve of the system based on ANSYS is completed to make a comparison with the theoretical results. It is shown that the theoretical value is basically consistent with that calculated through ANSYS. Conclusion vibrational characteristics of double-sheet detection system is obtained quickly and accurately, and propound solving measures by some crucial factors, such as the harmonic load, mass and stiffness, which will affect the vibration of the system, contribute to the finite element method is applied to the complex multiple-degree-of-freedom system.\n\nANSYS simulation of the capacitance coupling of quartz tuning fork gyroscope\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Qing; Feng, Lihui; Zhao, Ke; Cui, Fang; Sun, Yu-nan\n\n2013-12-01\n\nCoupling error is one of the main error sources of the quartz tuning fork gyroscope. The mechanism of capacitance coupling error is analyzed in this article. Finite Element Method (FEM) is used to simulate the structure of the quartz tuning fork by ANSYS software. The voltage output induced by the capacitance coupling is simulated with the harmonic analysis and characteristics of electrical and mechanical parameters influenced by the capacitance coupling between drive electrodes and sense electrodes are discussed with the transient analysis.\n\nANSYS-Based Simulation and Optimization on Temperature Field of Amorphous Ingot Made by Water Quenching\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhao, W.; Sun, Z.; Tang, Z.; Liaw, P. K.; Li, J.; Liu, R. P.; Li, Gong\n\n2014-05-01\n\n2D finite element analysis was conducted on the temperature field to create an amorphous ingot by vacuum water quenching. An optimized analysis document was then written by ANSYS parametric design language, and the optimal design modules of ANSYS were used to study the inside diameter and wall thickness of the quartz tube, as well as the water temperature. The microstructure and the phase structure of the amorphous ingot were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, respectively. Results show that during the cooling process, the thinner wall thickness, smaller diameter of the ingot, or lower temperature of the water environment can result in higher cooling rate at a given temperature. Besides, the gap between the different cooling rates induced by wall thickness or diameter of the ingot narrows down as the temperature decreases, and the gap between the different cooling rates induced by temperature of the water environment remains constant. The process parameters in creating an amorphous ingot, which is optimized by the finite element analysis on the temperature field, are reliable.\n\nAerodynamic Analysis of a Canard Missile Configuration using ANSYS-CFX\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2011-12-01\n\nOF A CANARD MISSILE CONFIGURATION USING ANSYS - CFX by Hong Chuan Wee December 2011 Thesis Advisor: Maximilian Platzer Second Reader...DATES COVERED Masterâs Thesis 4.

Determination of structural behaviour under earthquake load is only possible in a laboratory environment with a specific scale, as carrying out structural experiments is difficult due to the evaluation of increased parameter numbers and because it requires an expensive laboratory setup. In an analytical study, structure was modelled using ANSYS Finite Element Package Program (2007), and its behaviour and crack development were revealed. When experimental difficulties are taken into consideration, analytical investigation of structure behaviour is more economic and much faster. At the end of the study, experimental results of structural behaviour and crack development were compared with analytical data. It was concluded that in a model structure retrofitted with FRP, the behaviour and cracking model can be determined without testing by determining the reasons for the points where analytical results are not converged with experimental data. Better understanding of structural behaviour is analytically enabled with the study.\n\nMethod to simulate and analyse induced stresses for laser crystal packaging technologies.\n\nPubMed\n\nRibes-Pleguezuelo, Pol; Zhang, Site; Beckert, Erik; Eberhardt, Ramona; Wyrowski, Frank; TÃ¼nnermann, Andreas\n\n2017-03-20\n\nA method to simulate induced stresses for a laser crystal packaging technique and the consequent study of birefringent effects inside the laser cavities has been developed. The method has been implemented by thermo-mechanical simulations implemented with ANSYS 17.0. ANSYS results were later imported in VirtualLab Fusion software where input/output beams in terms of wavelengths and polarization were analysed. The study has been built in the context of a low-stress soldering technique implemented for glass or crystal optics packaging's called the solderjet bumping technique. The outcome of the analysis showed almost no difference between the input and output laser beams for the laser cavity constructed with an yttrium aluminum garnet active laser crystal, a second harmonic generator beta-barium borate, and the output laser mirror made of fused silica assembled by the low-stress solderjet bumping technique.\n\nApplication of Benchmark Examples to Assess the Single and Mixed-Mode Static Delamination Propagation Capabilities in ANSYS\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKrueger, Ronald\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe application of benchmark examples for the assessment of quasi-static delamination propagation capabilities is demonstrated for ANSYS. The examples are independent of the analysis software used and allow the assessment of the automated delamination propagation in commercial finite element codes based on the virtual crack closure technique (VCCT). The examples selected are based on two-dimensional finite element models of Double Cantilever Beam (DCB), End-Notched Flexure (ENF), Mixed-Mode Bending (MMB) and Single Leg Bending (SLB) specimens. First, the quasi-static benchmark examples were recreated for each specimen using the current implementation of VCCT in ANSYS . Second, the delamination was allowed to propagate under quasi-static loading from its initial location using the automated procedure implemented in the finite element software. Third, the load-displacement relationship from a propagation analysis and the benchmark results were compared, and good agreement could be achieved by selecting the appropriate input parameters. The benchmarking procedure proved valuable by highlighting the issues associated with choosing the input parameters of the particular implementation. Overall the results are encouraging, but further assessment for three-dimensional solid models is required.\n\nStructural Performanceâs Optimally Analysing and Implementing Based on ANSYS Technology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHan, Na; Wang, Xuquan; Yue, Haifang; Sun, Jiandong; Wu, Yongchun\n\n2017-06-01\n\nComputer-aided Engineering (CAE) is a hotspot both in academic field and in modern engineering practice.

Calculation results show that the ablating form of the materials in different irritation is of diversity. The laser irradiated surface is a camber surface rather than a flat surface, which is on the lowest point and owns the highest power density. Research shows that the higher laser power density absorbed by material surface, the faster the irritation surface regressed.\n\nValidation of High Displacement Piezoelectric Actuator Finite Element Models\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTaleghani, B. K.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThe paper presents the results obtained by using NASTRAN(Registered Trademark) and ANSYS(Regitered Trademark) finite element codes to predict doming of the THUNDER piezoelectric actuators during the manufacturing process and subsequent straining due to an applied input voltage. To effectively use such devices in engineering applications, modeling and characterization are essential. Length, width, dome height, and thickness are important parameters for users of such devices. Therefore, finite element models were used to assess the effects of these parameters. NASTRAN(Registered Trademark) and ANSYS(Registered Trademark) used different methods for modeling piezoelectric effects. In NASTRAN(Registered Trademark), a thermal analogy was used to represent voltage at nodes as equivalent temperatures, while ANSYS(Registered Trademark) processed the voltage directly using piezoelectric finite elements. The results of finite element models were validated by using the experimental results.\n\nTemperature Field Simulation of Powder Sintering Process with ANSYS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHe, Hongxiu; Wang, Jun; Li, Shuting; Chen, Zhilong; Sun, Jinfeng; You, Ying\n\n2018-03-01\n\nAiming at the âspheroidization phenomenonâ in the laser sintering of metal powder and other quality problems of the forming parts due to the thermal effect, the finite element model of the three-dimensional transient metal powder was established by using the atomized iron powder as the research object. The simulation of the mobile heat source was realized by means of parametric design. The distribution of the temperature field during the sintering process under different laser power and different spot sizes was simulated by ANSYS software under the condition of fully considering the influence of heat conduction, thermal convection, thermal radiation and thermophysical parameters. The influence of these factors on the actual sintering process was also analyzed, which provides an effective way for forming quality control.\n\nAn open source software tool to assign the material properties of bone for ABAQUS finite element simulations.\n\nPubMed\n\nPegg, Elise C; Gill, Harinderjit S\n\n2016-09-06\n\nA new software tool to assign the material properties of bone to an ABAQUS finite element mesh was created and compared with Bonemat, a similar tool originally designed to work with Ansys finite element models. Our software tool (py_bonemat_abaqus) was written in Python, which is the chosen scripting language for ABAQUS. The purpose of this study was to compare the software packages in terms of the material assignment calculation and processing speed. Three element types were compared (linear hexahedral (C3D8), linear tetrahedral (C3D4) and quadratic tetrahedral elements (C3D10)), both individually and as part of a mesh. Comparisons were made using a CT scan of a hemi-pelvis as a test case. A small difference, of -0.05kPa on average, was found between Bonemat version 3.1 (the current version) and our Python package. Errors were found in the previous release of Bonemat (version 3.0 downloaded from www.biomedtown.org) during calculation of the quadratic tetrahedron Jacobian, and conversion of the apparent density to modulus when integrating over the Young×³s modulus field. These issues caused up to 2GPa error in the modulus assignment. For these reasons, we recommend users upgrade to the most recent release of Bonemat. Processing speeds were assessed for the three different element types. Our Python package took significantly longer (110s on average) to perform the calculations compared with the Bonemat software (10s). Nevertheless, the workflow advantages of the package and added functionality makes 'py_bonemat_abaqus' a useful tool for ABAQUS users. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The test problems involve direct transient analysis, nonlinear analysis, and static analysis. The experiences in using graphics software packages are also discussed. It was found that MSC/XL can be more useful if it can be improved to generate picture files of the analysis results and to extend its capabilities to support finite element codes other than MSC/NASTRAN. It was found that the current version of SDRC/I-DEAS (version VI) may have bugs in the module 'Data Loader'.\n\nHANFORD DST THERMAL & SEISMIC PROJECT ANSYS BENCHMARK ANALYSIS OF SEISMIC INDUCED FLUID STRUCTURE INTERACTION IN A HANFORD DOUBLE SHELL PRIMARY TANK\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMACKEY, T.C.\n\nM&D Professional Services, Inc. (M&D) is under subcontract to Pacific Northwest National Laboratories (PNNL) to perform seismic analysis of the Hanford Site Double-Shell Tanks (DSTs) in support of a project entitled ''Double-Shell Tank (DSV Integrity Project-DST Thermal and Seismic Analyses)''. The overall scope of the project is to complete an up-to-date comprehensive analysis of record of the DST System at Hanford in support of Tri-Party Agreement Milestone M-48-14. The work described herein was performed in support of the seismic analysis of the DSTs. The thermal and operating loads analysis of the DSTs is documented in Rinker et al. (2004). ThemoreÂ Â» overall seismic analysis of the DSTs is being performed with the general-purpose finite element code ANSYS. The overall model used for the seismic analysis of the DSTs includes the DST structure, the contained waste, and the surrounding soil. The seismic analysis of the DSTs must address the fluid-structure interaction behavior and sloshing response of the primary tank and contained liquid. ANSYS has demonstrated capabilities for structural analysis, but the capabilities and limitations of ANSYS to perform fluid-structure interaction are less well understood. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the capabilities and investigate the limitations of ANSYS for performing a fluid-structure interaction analysis of the primary tank and contained waste. To this end, the ANSYS solutions are benchmarked against theoretical solutions appearing in BNL 1995, when such theoretical solutions exist. When theoretical solutions were not available, comparisons were made to theoretical solutions of similar problems and to the results from Dytran simulations. The capabilities and limitations of the finite element code Dytran for performing a fluid-structure interaction analysis of the primary tank and contained waste were explored in a parallel investigation (Abatt 2006). In conjunction with the results of the global ANSYS\n\nOptimally analyzing and implementing of bolt fittings in steel structure based on ANSYS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHan, Na; Song, Shuangyang; Cui, Yan; Wu, Yongchun\n\n2018-03-01\n\nANSYS simulation software for its excellent performance become outstanding one in Computer-aided Engineering (CAE) family, it is committed to the innovation of engineering simulation to help users to shorten the design process.

Then, A optimally analyzing and implementing of bolt fittings in beam-column join of steel structure was implemented by ANSYS, which was display the cloud chart of XY-shear stress, the cloud chart of YZ-shear stress and the cloud chart of Y component of stress. Finally, ANSYS software simulating results was compared with the measured results by the experiment. The result of ANSYS simulating and analyzing is reliable, efficient and optical. In above process, a structural performance's numerical simulating and analyzing model were explored for engineering enterprises' practice.\n\nOn location of piezoelectric element in a smart-structure: numerical investigation and experiment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOshmarin, D.; Iurlov, M.\n\n2017-06-01\n\nIn this paper, based on some example problems it was demonstrated that in examining the possibilities of smart structure applications, the matter of considerable researchersâ concern is the problem of location of piezoelectric elements in the structure to allow effective realization of its smart functions in the framework of the specified strategy of structure control and target purposes (vibration damping, defectoscopy, etc.) The numerical and experimental investigations have shown that for structures with the elements made of piezoelectric materials, it is more convenient to use as a parameter, specifying the best location of the piezoelectric element for damping the vibrations at the prescribed frequency, the coefficient of electromechanical coupling, which is evaluated by the values of eigenfrequencies of the structure in the short-circuit and open-circuit regimes. The values of eigenfrequencies of vibrations are evaluated by solving the problem of natural vibrations of electromechanical systems by the finite element method using the applied ANSYS package. The investigation were conducted for a thin-walled aluminum shell in the form of half-cylinder.\n\nCeramic ball grid array package stress analysis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBadri, S. H. B. S.; Aziz, M. H. A.; Ong, N. R.; Sauli, Z.; Alcain, J. B.; Retnasamy, V.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThe ball grid array (BGA), a form of chip scale package (CSP), was developed as one of the most advanced surface mount devices, which may be assembled by an ordinary surface ball bumps are used instead of plated nickel and gold (Ni/Au) bumps. Assembly and reliability of the BGA's printed circuit board (PCB), which is soldered by conventional surface mount technology is considered in this study. The Ceramic Ball Grid Array (CBGA) is a rectangular ceramic package or square-shaped that will use the solder ball for external electrical connections instead of leads or wire for connections. The solder balls will be arranged in an array or grid at the bottom of the ceramic package body. In this study, ANSYS software is used to investigate the stress on the package for 2 balls and 4 balls of the CBGA package with the various force range of 1-3 Newton applied to the top of the die, top of the substrate and side of the substrate. The highest maximum stress was analyzed and the maximum equivalent stress was observed on the solder ball and the die. From the simulation result, the CBGA package with less solder balls experience higher stress compared to the package with many solder balls. Therefore, less number of solder ball on the CBGA package results higher stress and critically affect the reliability of the solder balls itself, substrate and die which can lead to the solder crack and also die crack.\n\nImproving finite element results in modeling heart valve mechanics.\n\nPubMed\n\nEarl, Emily; Mohammadi, Hadi\n\n2018-06-01\n\nFinite element analysis is a well-established computational tool which can be used for the analysis of soft tissue mechanics. Due to the structural complexity of the leaflet tissue of the heart valve, the currently available finite element models do not adequately represent the leaflet tissue. A method of addressing this issue is to implement computationally expensive finite element models, characterized by precise constitutive models including high-order and high-density mesh techniques. In this study, we introduce a novel numerical technique that enhances the results obtained from coarse mesh finite element models to provide accuracy comparable to that of fine mesh finite element models while maintaining a relatively low computational cost. Introduced in this study is a method by which the computational expense required to solve linear and nonlinear constitutive models, commonly used in heart valve mechanics simulations, is reduced while continuing to account for large and infinitesimal deformations. This continuum model is developed based on the least square algorithm procedure coupled with the finite difference method adhering to the assumption that the components of the strain tensor are available at all nodes of the finite element mesh model. The suggested numerical technique is easy to implement, practically efficient, and requires less computational time compared to currently available commercial finite element packages such as ANSYS and/or ABAQUS.\n\nApplications of ANSYS/Multiphysics at NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLoughlin, Jim\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThis viewgraph presentation reviews some of the uses that the ANSYS/Multiphysics system is used for at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.

Typically, continuum elements are used for the simulation of stents, for example the commercial FE software ANSYS offers a continuum element based on Auricchio's SMA model. Almost every stent geometry, however, is made up of long and slender components and can be modeled more efficiently, in the computational sense, with beam elements. Using the ANSYS user programmable material feature, we implement the free energy based SMA model developed by Mueller and Seelecke into the ANSYS beam element 188. Convergence behavior for both, beam and continuum formulations, is studied in terms of element and layer number, respectively. This is systematically illustrated first for the case of a straight cantilever beam under end loading, and subsequently for a section of a z-bend wire, a typical stent sub-geometry. It is shown that the computation times for the beam element are reduced to only one third of those of the continuum element, while both formulations display a comparable force/displacement response.\n\nANSI Standard: Complying with Background Noise Limits.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSchaffer, Mark E.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nDiscusses the new classroom acoustics standard, ANSI Standard S12.60, which specifies maximum sound level limits that are significantly lower than currently typical for classrooms.

Muzibur; Kamol, Rajia Sultana; Islam, Reyana\n\n2017-12-01\n\nShip is a complex geometry which undergoes a combination of loadings such as hydrostatic, hydrodynamic, wind, wave etc. at sea and thus adequate strength in a ship has always been one of the most challenging tasks for the ship designers. International Maritime Organization (IMO) and classification societies are providing the standards to ensure the adequacy of strength for the ship against all demands throughout its service life. Thus, structural analysis is needed to assess the overall strength of hull, and the means in this regard are based on finite element method which may be applied either local or global aspect of the ship. This paper is an attempt to carry out the structural analysis of a ship in global aspect using ANSYS software to locate the most stress concentration and deformed area, which will have ultimate effect on fatigue fracture.\n\nARI's Views on ANSI S12.60-2002.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nDarbeau, Michele\n\n2003-01-01\n\nStates the position of the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute (ARI) toward ANSI Standard 12.60, which addresses classroom acoustics.

A light weight material capable of holding and protecting the components inside the PLSS is required to demonstrate the viability of the flexible PLSS packaging concept. The material needs to distribute, dissipate, and absorb the impact energy of the PLSS falling on the lunar surface. It must also be very robust and function in the extreme lunar thermal vacuum environment for up to one hundred Extravehicular Activity (EVA) missions. This paper documents the performance requirements for selecting a foam protection material, and the methodologies for evaluating commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) foam protection materials. It also presents the materials properties test results and impact drop test results of the various foam materials evaluated in the study. The findings from this study suggest that a foam based flexible protection system is a viable solution for PLSS packaging. However, additional works are needed to optimize COTS foam properties or to develop a composite foam system that will meet all the performance requirements for the CSSE PLSS flexible packaging.\n\nA convenient and adaptable package of DNA sequence analysis programs for microcomputers.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPustell, J; Kafatos, F C\n\n1982-01-01\n\nWe describe a package of DNA data handling and analysis programs designed for microcomputers.

L.; Nunes-Pereira, Eduardo J.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe goal of this paper is to study in which extent the use of Zemax is suited for athermalization purposes. The research questions targeted in this paper are: what are the differences in the formulation of materials' thermal expansion between Zemax and Ansys; what is the impact on optical quality between both approaches; quantification of the differences between the two methodologies in terms of back focal length, spot radius and modulation transfer function (MTF). To quantify the differences between both approaches, it is used an objective working between -40Â°C and 110Â°C. Initially, only Zemax was used to evaluate the objective. Zemax considers a linear geometric expansion of every optical surface, which is here proved to not be the best approach to find a deformed geometry after a thermal load. The second approach is to create a 3D model and perform a finite element simulation in Ansys software. The input data is the thermal variation and the output is the deformed geometry of the lenses. Using SigFit software, it was possible to generate new mathematical equations of the deformed lenses and import this data into Zemax to start a new ray tracing. The new shape and location of lenses differs for both scenarios, and the difference in the focal plane shift is around 12%. The maximum spot radius difference is 27% and MTF relative error goes up to 16%. Zemax as a standalone software is valid if used as an initial guess for the optical designer. However, as a final stage for validation and detailed design, the approach containing Ansys and SigFit should be preferable.\n\nPerformance analysis of the node shell on a container door based on ANSYS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Qingzhou; Zhou, Yi; Hu, Changqing; Cheng, Jiamin; Zeng, Xiaochen\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe structure of thenode shell on a container door was designed and analyzed in this study. The model of the shell was developed with ANSYS. The grids of the model were divided based on the Hex dominant method, and the stress distribution and the temperature distribution of the shell were calculated based on FEA (Finite Element Analysis) method. The analysis results indicated thatthe location of the concave upward side has the highest stress which also lower than the strength limit of the material. The temperature of the magnet installation location was highest, therefore the glue for fixing the magnet must has high temperature resistance. The results provide the basis for the further optimization of the shell.\n\nExperience in Using a Finite Element Stress and Vibration Package on a Minicomputer,\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1982-01-01\n\nas the Gra’phics Oricntat.ed Interactive Finite Element Time Sharing Pacl’age ( GIFTS ).

A.\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThis paper presents the numerical simulation of epoxy molding compound (EMC) filling in multi flip-chip packages during encapsulation process. The empty and a group flip chip packages were considered in the mold cavity in order to study the flow profile of the EMC. SOLIDWORKS software was used for three-dimensional modeling and it was incorporated into fluid analysis software namely as ANSYS FLUENT. The volume of fluid (VOF) technique was used for capturing the flow front profiles and Power Law model was applied for its rheology model. The numerical result are compared and discussed with previous experimental and it was shown a good conformity for model validation. The prediction of flow front was observed and analyzed at different filling time.

Conventionally, a simplified 3-dimensional MCNP model is applied to calculate these parameters because of the cumbersomeness of modelling by hand. ANSYS has a function for converting the CAD `stp' format into an MCNP input in the geometry part. Using ANSYS and a 3- dimensional CAD file, a very detailed and sophisticated MCNP 3-dimensional model can be generated. The MCNP model is applied to evaluate the assembly weighting factor at the ex-core detector of SMART, and the result is compared with a simplified MCNP SMART model and assembly weighting factor calculated by DORT, which is a deterministic Sn code.\n\nAdvanced Software for Analysis of High-Speed Rolling-Element Bearings\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPoplawski, J. V.; Rumbarger, J. H.; Peters, S. M.; Galatis, H.; Flower, R.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nCOBRA-AHS is a package of advanced software for analysis of rigid or flexible shaft systems supported by rolling-element bearings operating at high speeds under complex mechanical and thermal loads. These loads can include centrifugal and thermal loads generated by motions of bearing components. COBRA-AHS offers several improvements over prior commercial bearing-analysis programs: It includes innovative probabilistic fatigue-life-estimating software that provides for computation of three-dimensional stress fields and incorporates stress-based (in contradistinction to prior load-based) mathematical models of fatigue life. It interacts automatically with the ANSYS finite-element code to generate finite-element models for estimating distributions of temperature and temperature-induced changes in dimensions in iterative thermal/dimensional analyses: thus, for example, it can be used to predict changes in clearances and thermal lockup.

Integration and packaging of optoelectronic devices holds the key to high-volume low-cost component manufacturing. The goal of this dissertation is to propose, study, and demonstrate various ways to integrate optoelectronic devices on a packaging platform to implement cost-effective, functional optical modules. Two types of hybrid integration techniques have been proposed: flip-chip solder bump bonding for high-density two-dimensional array packaging of surface-emitting devices, and solder preform bonding for fiber-coupled edge-emitting semiconductor devices. For flip-chip solder bump bonding, we developed a simple, inexpensive remetallization process called \"electroless plating\", which converts the aluminum bond pads of foundry-made complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) chips into solder-bondable and wire-bondable gold surfaces. We have applied for a patent on this remetallization technique. For fiber-pigtailed edge-emitting laser modules, we have studied the coupling characteristics of different types of lensed single-mode fibers including semispherically lensed fiber, cylindrically lensed fiber and conically lensed fiber. We have experimentally demonstrated 66% coupling efficiency with semispherically lensed fiber and 50% efficiency with conically lensed fibers. We have proposed and designed a packaging platform on which lensed fibers can be actively aligned to a laser and solder-attached reliably to the platform so that the alignment is retained. We have designed thin-film nichrome heaters on fused quartz platforms as local heat source to facilitate on-board solder alignment and attachment of fiber. The thermal performance of the heaters was simulated using finite element analysis tool ANSYS prior to fabrication. Using the heater's reworkability advantage, we have estimated the shift of the fiber due to\n\nPre-release plastic packaging of MEMS and IMEMS devices\n\nDOEpatents\n\nPeterson, Kenneth A.; Conley, William R.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nA method is disclosed for pre-release plastic packaging of MEMS and IMEMS devices. The method can include encapsulating the MEMS device in a transfer molded plastic package. Next, a perforation can be made in the package to provide access to the MEMS elements. The non-ablative material removal process can include wet etching, dry etching, mechanical machining, water jet cutting, and ultrasonic machining, or any combination thereof. Finally, the MEMS elements can be released by using either a wet etching or dry plasma etching process. The MEMS elements can be protected with a parylene protective coating. After releasing the MEMS elements, an anti-stiction coating can be applied. The perforating step can be applied to both sides of the device or package. A cover lid can be attached to the face of the package after releasing any MEMS elements. The cover lid can include a window for providing optical access. The method can be applied to any plastic packaged microelectronic device that requires access to the environment, including chemical, pressure, or temperature-sensitive microsensors; CCD chips, photocells, laser diodes, VCSEL's, and UV-EPROMS. The present method places the high-risk packaging steps ahead of the release of the fragile portions of the device. It also provides protection for the die in shipment between the molding house and the house that will release the MEMS elements and subsequently treat the surfaces.\n\nDevelopments in pesticide packaging and management of bulk herbicides as elements in a container reduction strategy\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBradley, D.\n\nPesticide packaging plays an important role in a broader area that can be called {open_quotes}Delivery Systems.{close_quotes} Delivery Systems can include all of the physical elements that enable a technical active ingredient or combination of ingredients to move from the manufacturing plant through the channels of distribution to the pesticide applicator, who generally further dilutes the product for use on a registered target pest or crop site. This article describes developments relating to three goals in pesticide packaging. Those goals are: reduction in the number of empty containers through the use of reusable containers, formulation modifications, and other container minimization approaches;moreÂ Â» recyling of empty containers for their material or energy value; and disposal of empty containers in accordance with environmentally sound and cost effective practices.Â«Â less\n\nDesign Compliance Matrices to ANSI and OSHA\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBENDIXSEN, R.B.\n\n2000-04-03\n\nU.S. Department of Energy Letter 98-SFD-028 requested Fluor Daniel Hanford, Inc. to provide clarifications as to compliance with ANSI 57.1, 57.2, 57.9, and 29 CFR 1910.179 (OSHA), in the form of an item-by-item compliance matrix, for the CSB.

Benchmark tests confirmed that this method works extremely well on incompressible earth model. Bangtsson & Lund (2008),however, showed that the transformation scheme would lead to incorrect results if compressible material parameters are used. Their study implies that Wu's method of stress transformation is inadequate to model the load induced deformation of a compressible earth under the framework of ABAQUS. In light of this, numerical experiments are carried out to find if there exist other methods that serve this purpose. All the tested methods are not satisfying as the results failed to converge through iterations, except at the elastic limit. Those tested methods will be outlined and the results will be presented. Possible reasons of failure will also be discussed. BÃ¤ngtsson, E., & Lund, B. (2008).

Abd\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAIM: This study aimed to compare the stresses generated by using two or four root form dental implants supporting mandibular overdentures that were retained with ball and locator attachments. METHODS: Under ANSYS environment, four 3D finite element models were prepared. These models simulated complete overdentures supported by two or four implants with either ball or locator attachments as a connection mechanism. The modelsâ components were created by CAD/CAM package then were imported to ANSYS. Load of 100 N was applied at the right premolar/molar region vertically and at an oblique angle of 110Â° from lingual direction. RESULTS: Within the conditions of this research, in all cases, it was found that cortical and cancellous bone regions were the least to be stressed. Also, the ball attachment produced higher stresses. CONCLUSION: Caps deformation and stresses are negligible in cases of using locator attachment in comparison to ball attachments. This may indicate longer lifetime and less repair/maintenance operations in implant overdentures retained by locator attachments. Although the study revealed that bone was insensitive to a number of implants or attachment type, it may be recommended to use two implants in the canine region than using four, where the locator attachments were found to be better.

M.; Jadaan, O. M.; Gyekenyesi, J. P.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThe desirable properties of ceramics at high temperatures have generated interest in their use for structural application such as in advanced turbine engine systems. Design lives for such systems can exceed 10,000 hours. The long life requirement necessitates subjecting the components to relatively low stresses. The combination of high temperatures and low stresses typically places failure for monolithic ceramics in the creep regime. The objective of this paper is to present a design methodology for predicting the lifetimes of structural components subjected to creep rupture conditions. This methodology utilizes commercially available finite element packages and takes into account the time-varying creep strain distributions (stress relaxation). The creep life, of a component is discretized into short time steps, during which the stress and strain distributions are assumed constant. The damage is calculated for each time step based on a modified Monkman-Grant creep rupture criterion. Failure is assumed to occur when the normalized accumulated damage at any point in the component is greater than or equal to unity. The corresponding time will be the creep rupture life for that component. Examples are chosen to demonstrate the Ceramics Analysis and Reliability Evaluation of Structures/CREEP (CARES/CREEP) integrated design program, which is written for the ANSYS finite element package. Depending on the component size and loading conditions, it was found that in real structures one of two competing failure modes (creep or slow crack growth) will dominate. Applications to benchmark problems and engine components are included.\n\nCreep Life of Ceramic Components Using a Finite-Element-Based Integrated Design Program (CARES/CREEP)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGyekenyesi, J.

For some retroviruses, engrafting Î¨ onto a heterologous RNA is sufficient to direct encapsidation. In contrast, HIV-1 RNA packaging requires 5' leader Î¨ elements plus poorly defined additional features. We previously defined minimal 5' leader sequences competitive with intact Î¨ for HIV-1 packaging, and here examined the potential roles of additional downstream elements. The findings confirmed that together, HIV-1 5' leader Î¨ sequences plus a nuclear export element are sufficient to specify packaging. However, RNAs trafficked using a heterologous export element did not compete well with RNAs using HIV-1's RRE. Furthermore, some RNA additions to well-packaged minimal vectors rendered them packaging-defective. These defects were rescued by extending gag sequences in their native context. To understand these packaging defects' causes, in vitro dimerization properties of RNAs containing minimal packaging elements were compared to RNAs with sequence extensions that were or were not compatible with packaging. In vitro dimerization was found to correlate with packaging phenotypes, suggesting that HIV-1 evolved to prevent 5' leader residues' base pairing with downstream residues and misfolding of the packaging signal. Our findings explain why gag sequences have been implicated in packaging and show that RRE's packaging contributions appear more specific than nuclear export alone. Paired with recent work showing that sequences upstream of Î¨ can dictate RNA folds, the current work explains how genetic context of minimal packaging elements contributes to HIV-1 RNA fate determination.

Kent; Greene, Emily A.; Pence, William\n\n1993-05-01\n\nFTOOLS, a highly modular collection of utilities for processing and analyzing data in the FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) format, has been developed in support of the HEASARC (High Energy Astrophysics Research Archive Center) at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Each utility performs a single simple task such as presentation of file contents, extraction of specific rows or columns, appending or merging tables, binning values in a column or selecting subsets of rows based on a boolean expression. Individual utilities can easily be chained together in scripts to achieve more complex operations such as the generation and displaying of spectra or light curves. The collection of utilities provides both generic processing and analysis utilities and utilities common to high energy astrophysics data sets. The FTOOLS software package is designed to be both compatible with IRAF and completely stand alone in a UNIX or VMS environment. The user interface is controlled by standard IRAF parameter files. The package is self documenting through the IRAF help facility and a stand alone help task. Software is written in ANSI C and FORTRAN to provide portability across most computer systems. The data format dependencies between hardware platforms are isolated through the FITSIO library package.\n\n[The study of noninvasive ventilator impeller based on ANSYS].\n\nPubMed\n\nHu, Zhaoyan; Lu, Pan; Xie, Haiming; Zhou, Yaxu\n\n2011-06-01\n\nAn impeller plays a significant role in the non-invasive ventilator.

In the LPCGDS process, pressurized compressed gas is accelerated to the critical velocity, which depends on length of the divergent section of nozzle, the propellant gas and particle characteristics, and the diameters ratio of the inlet and outer diameters. This paper presents finite element modeling (FEM) of powder stream in supersonic nozzle wherein adiabatic gas flow and expansion of gas occurs in uniform manner and the same is used to evaluate the resultant temperature and velocity contours during coating process. FEM analyses were performed using commercial finite volume package, ANSYS CFD FLUENT. The results are helpful to predict the characteristics of powder stream at the exit of the supersonic nozzle.\n\n[Establishment and validation of normal human L1-L5 lumbar three-dimensional finite element model].\n\nPubMed\n\nZhu, Zhenqi; Liu, Chenjun; Wang, Jiefu; Wang, Kaifeng; Huang, Zhixin; Wang, Weida; Liu, Haiying\n\n2014-10-14\n\nTo create and validate a L1-L5 lumbar three-dimensional finite element model. The L1-L5 lumbar spines of a male healthy volunteer were scanned with computed tomography (CT). And a L1-L5 lumbar three-dimensional finite element model was created with the aid of software packages of Mimics, Geomagic and Ansys. Then border conditions were set, unit type was determined, finite element mesh was divided and a model was established for loading and calculating. Average model stiffness under the conditions of flexion, extension, lateral bending and axial rotation was calculated and compared with the outcomes of former articles for validation.

In order to use the standard FEA software for simulation, an equivalent heat conduction coefficient is proposed and calculated to describe the heat transfer of the air trapped inside the insulated packaging container. The three-dimensional, insulated packaging container is regarded as a combination of six panels, and the heat flow at each side panel is a one-dimension diffusion process. The transit-thermal analysis was applied to simulate the heat transition process from ambient environment to inside the container. Field measurements were carried out to collect the temperature during transport, and the collected data were compared to the FEA simulation results. Insulated packaging containers are used to transport temperature-sensitive products such as vaccine and other pharmaceutical products. The container is usually made of an extruded polystyrene foam filled with gel packs. World Health Organization guidelines recommend that all vaccines except oral polio vaccine be distributed in an environment where the temperature ranges between +2 to +8 Â°C. The primary areas of concern in designing the packaging for vaccine are how much of the foam thickness and gel packs should be used in order to keep the temperature in a desired range, and how to prevent the vaccine from exposure to freezing temperatures. This study uses numerical simulation to predict temperature change within an insulated packaging container in vaccine cold chain. It is our hope that this simulation will provide the vaccine industries with an alternative engineering tool to validate vaccine packaging and project thermal equilibrium within the insulated packaging container.\n\nBoundary conditions for simulating large SAW devices using ANSYS.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeng, Dasong; Yu, Fengqi; Hu, Jian; Li, Peng\n\n2010-08-01\n\nIn this report, we propose improved substrate left and right boundary conditions for simulating SAW devices using ANSYS.
