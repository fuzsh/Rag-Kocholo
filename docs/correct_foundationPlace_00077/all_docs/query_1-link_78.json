It consists of three parts, described in sequence in the subsequent sections. The first addresses the search for an optimum cell topology, which satisfies the requirements for a successful bone tissue engineering scaffold. This step is illustrated in the upper box of FIG. 1 . The other two, depicted together in the box below, pertain to the design of the lattice material for static and fatigue failure.\n\nthe requirements for bone tissue regeneration that are account for in the present methodology include good osteoconductivity, high porosity to facilitate transport of nutrients and metabolic wastes, sufficient mechanical strength to support physiological loading conditions, and appropriate biodegradability (Kang et al., 2010; Hollister, 2005). These attributes are controlled by the pore microarchitecture, in particular by interconnectivity, porosity, pore size as well as pore topology. Pore topology describes geometric properties independent of cell size and shape, as well as invariant to stretching, bending and twisting. The cell architecture affects functional characteristics such as elastic modulus, permeability, and diffusivity (Chu et al., 2002). The latter describes mass transport conditions that in turn influence cell phenotype, tissue ingrowth, and nutrient settings.\n\nthe functions of mechanical support and tissue formation are antagonist. For example, while increased porosity and pore size facilitate bone ingrowth, larger pores might weaken the scaffold integrity and thus reduce its mechanical properties.\n\na match of the elastic modulus of the scaffold to that of the host bone has the undesired effect of penalizing the diffusivity and permeability of the scaffold, which need to be maximized for better cell migration and biological transport (Kang et al., 2010; Hollister, 2005).\n\nthe method proposed here solves the challenge of finding trade-off solutions of the pore geometries.\n\na novel type of implant which in contrast to current known implants made of either a fully solid or a foam material, consists of a lattice microstructure with non-homogeneous distribution of material properties.\n\na methodology based on multiscale mechanics and design optimization is introduced to synthesize a graded cellular implant that can minimize concurrently bone resorption and implant interface failure.\n\nthe method can contribute to the development of a new generation of orthopaedic implants with a graded cellular microstructure that will reduce the clinical consequences of current implants.\n\nthe procedure is applied to the design of a 2D left implanted femur with optimized gradients of relative density.\n\nthe optimized cellular implant is compared to a fully dense titanium implant and a homogeneous foam implant with a relative density of 50%.\n\nthe bone resorption and the maximum value of interface stress of the cellular implant is found to be over 70% and 50% less than the titanium implant while being 53% and 65% less than the foam implant.\n\na proof-of-concept of the graded cellular implant was fabricated by using rapid prototyping to assess the manufacturability of the design.\n\nRecent advances in additive manufacturing such as Electron-Beam Melting (EBM), Selective Laser Melting (SLM), Stereolithography Apparatus (SLA), and other rapid prototyping techniques, offer the possibility of novel bone-replacement implants with a controlled cellular microstructure (Parthasarathy et al., 2010; Heinl et al., 2008; Stamp et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2002; Murr et al., 2010).\n\ncellular components with tailored microstructures can be built with a high level of quality, accuracy and reliability.\n\nsuch manufacturing processes are capable of building graded cellular structures.\n\nthis feature is an asset for bone-replacement implants since the internal skeleton of the prosthesis can be designed to ease osseointegration as well as to match the local mechanical properties of the femoral bone.\n\ntopology, size, and relative density of the unit cell of the implant it is thus possible to: (a) fabricate implants which can provide mechanical properties mimicking those of the host bone; (b) manufacture three-dimensional structures with an interconnected porosity and pore sizes suitable to bone ingrowth and vascularization; and (c) customize implants for each patient by using CT scan data of the patient's bone.\n\nthe present disclosure proposes a systematic methodology for the design of bone-replacement implants with improved structural stability.\n\ntotal hip arthroplasty for example, but not limited to, an implant design with tailored gradients of lattice material that can simultaneously minimize bone resorption and bone-implant interface stress is disclosed.\n\nthe procedure that hinges on multiscale mechanics theory and multiobjective optimization is applied to the design of a bidimensional femoral hip implant with optimal graded cellular microstructure. Its biocompatibility performance is discussed herein.\n\nthe mechanical properties of a cellular structure depends on the relative density and the geometric parameters of the unit cell, as described, for example, by the expression of the Young's modulus:\n\nE* is the effective Young's modulus of the unit cell\n\nâ is the density of the unit cell\n\nE s and â s are the Young's modulus and density of the constitutive material, respectively.\n\nm has a value varying from 1 to 3 as determined by the mechanical failure mode of the unit cell\n\nC is a geometric constant of the unit cell.\n\nFIG. 2 summarizes the procedure 20 proposed here to design a cellular implant with controlled gradients of mechanical properties.\n\nthe method 20 integrates a multiscale mechanics approach to deal with the scale-dependent material structure and a multiobjective optimization strategy to handle the conflicting nature of bone resorption and implant interface failure.\n\nthe main steps identified by the numbers reported in the flow chart of FIG. 2 are described hereinbelow.\n\nthe first step 22 consists in processing CT-scan data of a patient bone to generate 24 a finite element model of the bone.\n\nthe design domain of the prosthesis is assumed to possess a 3D lattice microstructure, where the unit cell, i.e. the building block, can be of any arbitrary topology ( FIG. 2 ).\n\nthe microscopic parameters of the unit cell geometry and the macroscopic shape of the implant are the design variables of the vector b.\n\nthe unit cell is assumed to be locally periodic, and its field quantities, such as stress and strain, to vary smoothly through the implant.\n\nthe characteristic length of the unit cell in the cellular implant is assumed to be much smaller than the characteristic length of the macro dimensions of the implant.\n\nthe microstructure is replaced 26 with a homogeneous medium whose equivalent mechanical properties, in particular the homogenized stiffness tensor of each unit cell, are calculated through the asymptotic homogenization theory (Guedes et al., 1990; Hassani and Hinton, 1998; Fang et al., 2005; Zienkiewicz and Taylor, 2005).\n\nthe homogenized stiffness tensors are then used to construct the stiffness matrix which will be the input to the Finite Element (FE) solver 28 .\n\nFE Finite Element\n\na stress recovery procedure is used 32 . If the microscopic stress level is below a predefined failure criterion, the macroscopic stresses and strains representing the mechanical behavior of the implant are used to evaluate bone loss (m r (b)) and interface failure (F(b)) 34 .\n\nthe constraints are set on the average porosity of the cellular implant â (b), the mean pore size P , and the minimum thickness of cell walls t min . In particular, â (b) â 40% and 50 â m â P â 800 â m are selected to ease bone ingrowth [41, 42].\n\nthe thickness of the cell walls is selected to be greater than the minimum resolution t min offered by a given manufacturing process.\n\nt min is 100 â m and 70 â m respectively for SLM and SLA (Yang et al., 2002; Wang, 2005). If the solutions of the optimization have not converged, then the vector b of the design variables is updated to find the set of non-dominated solutions of the Pareto front ( 368 , 38 ). If the unit cell fails at microscale level, the cell walls will be iteratively increased to reduce the microscopic stresses 38 .\n\nthe deformation and failure mechanisms of a structure with heterogeneous material can occur at both the macroscopic and microscopic scales.\n\nthe heterogeneities are explicitly modeled at the microscale to guarantee high accuracy.\n\nthe computational effort can be very lengthy and time-consuming.\n\nthe microstructure can be replaced by a homogeneous medium, and the mathematical theory of homogenization can be used to characterize the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous media. As shown in FIG.\n\na body â â with a periodic microstructure subjected to the traction t at the traction boundary â t , a displacement d at the displacement boundary â d , and a body force f can be replaced by a homogenized body â with the prescribed external and traction boundaries applied to â â , without geometrical details and voids of the local coordinate system.\n\nthe homogenized properties and strength of a cellular structure can be obtained by performing either analytical or numerical or experimental approaches. Extensive efforts have been devoted to the derivation of the equivalent mechanical properties by structural analysis (Gibson and Ashby, 1999; Masters and Evans, 1996; Christensen, 2000; Wang and McDowell, 2004; Kumar and McDowell, 2004; Warren and Byskov, 2002; Chen and Huang, 1998). In these studies, the effective moduli and yield strength of a cellular material are generally modeled by assuming that the cell walls flex like beams. Despite the simplicity of this method in calculating the overall mechanical properties, the results are reliable only if the relative density is lower than 0.3 (Wang and Mcdowell, 2004). Furthermore, the actual stress distribution within the unit cell walls cannot be captured.\n\nthe asymptotic homogenization method is used in this work to deal with the multiscale analysis of the cellular implant. This technique is applied to calculate the homogeneous stiffness matrix of the unit cell for different values of relative density as well as to determine the microscopic stresses and strains (Guedes and Kituchi, 1990; Zienkiewicz and Taylor, 2005; Hollister and Kikuchi, 1992).\n\nthe asymptotic homogenization method has been widely used in topology optimization (Bends â e and Sigmund, 2003; Hassani and Hinton, 1998; D â aaz and Kikuchi, 1992; Suzuki and Kikuchi, 1991; Bends â e and Kikuchi, 1988) and hierarchical design of materials and structures (Coelho et al., 2008; Rodrigues et al., 2002; GonÃ§alves Coelho et al., 2011; Coelho et al., 2011).\n\na predefined unit cell topology with parametric geometry is considered as the microstructure of the implant; then, the optimization algorithm searches for the optimum unit cell geometry of the lattice to minimize the antagonist objective functions under a set of constraints.\n\nThis procedure is similar to the one developed by Bends â e and Kikuchi (1988) and is not limited to any cell topology.\n\nE ijkl is the local elasticity tensor that depends on the position within the representative volume element, i.e. E ijkl is equal to the elasticity tensor of the material located in the cell walls and it vanishes in the voids.\n\nM ijkl is the local structure tensor, which relates the macroscopic strains ( â ) to the local or microstructural strains ( â ) through the relation:\n\nâ ij is the Kronecker delta\n\nâ ij â kl is the microstructural strain corresponding to the component kl of macroscopic strain tensor ( â kl ).\n\nâ ij â kl is the solution of the following equation:\n\nâ ij l ( â ) is the virtual strain.\n\nâ kl can be an arbitrary macroscopic strain tensor. Considering the assumption of small deformation and linear material behavior, â kl may be written as a linear combination of unit strains. For a two-dimensional case, the unit strains are defined as:\n\nthe first task is to obtain the matrix M ijkl .\n\nthe unit strains are applied to each element of the FE model Periodicity of the strain field is ensured by imposing periodic boundary conditions on the RVE edges.\n\nthe direct method is selected to derive periodic boundary conditions.\n\nthe microscopic strain field ( â ij â kl ) inside the RVE is obtained by solving Eq. (4).\n\nthe results are substituted into Eq. (3b) to calculate the local structure tensor M ijkl for each element of the RVE.\n\nthe effective stiffness tensor E ijkl ij is obtained by calculating Eq. (2).\n\nthe steps described above are used to compute the homogenized stiffness tensor for each unit cell of the cellular hip implant ( FIG. 2 ). These tensors are used to construct the global stiffness matrix for the FE solver to obtain macroscopic stress and strain distribution within bone and implant. The values are then postprocessed to evaluate the objective functions of the multiobjective optimization problem.\n\nthe multiobjective optimization problem can be formulated as:\n\nthe amount of bone loss around the stem is determined by assessing the amount of bone that is underloaded. Bone can be considered locally underloaded when its local strain energy (U i ) per unit of bone mass ( â ), averaged over n loading cases\n\nthe resorbed bone mass fraction m r can be obtained from:\n\nâ m r â ( b ) 1 M â â ? â g â ( S â ( b ) ) â â â â V â â ? â indicates text missing or illegible when filed ( 7 )\n\nF(b) is the global interface function index\n\nâ i b of is the interface stress at the loading case i, depending on the design variable b\n\nâ is the interface area\n\nf( â ihu b ) is the local interface stress function, which is defined based on the multi-axial Hoffman failure criterion (Hoffman, 1967). This function is used to determine where local debonding might occur along the bone-implant interface (Pal et al., 2009).\n\nthe probability of local Interface failure f( â ) is given by:\n\nâ f â ( â ) 1 S ? â S c â â n 2 + ( 1 S ? - 1 S ? â ) â â n + 1 S ? 2 â â 2 â â ? â indicates text missing or illegible when filed ( 9 )\n\nthe bone density distribution can be obtained through a CT-scan data of bone and then used in Eq. (10) to find the effective mechanical properties of the bone, from which the local interface failure is determined via Eq. (9). Finally, the interface failure index, F(b), is evaluated by means of Eq. (8).\n\nFIG. 4 shows the geometry of the left femur considered in this work along with the appropriate loads and boundary conditions.\n\nthe grid depicts the domain of the implant to be designed with a lattice material of graded properties.\n\nthe load case represent daily static loading during stance phase of walking (Carter et al., 1989).\n\nthe distal end of the femur is fixed to avoid rigid body motion.\n\n20 GPa was considered as the Young's modulus of the cortical bone and 1.5 GPa for the proximal bone.\n\nthe Poisson's ratio is set to be 0.3.\n\nFIG. 5 shows the unit cell geometry used for the tessellation of the whole implant.\n\nthe gradients of material properties are governed by the lattice relative density, which as model variable is controlled by the cell size and wall thickness of the hollow square.\n\nTi6Al4V which is a biocompatible material commonly used in EBM, was considered. Its mechanical properties are the following: 900 MPa for the yield strength of the solid material, 120 GPa for Young's modulus, and 0.3 for Poisson's ratio.\n\nthe procedure or method 20 disclosed herein for the design of a graded cellular implant requires both multiscale analysis and multiobjective optimization, as shown in FIG. 2 .\n\nthe variables of the lattice model are the relative densities attributed to 130 sampling points, 26 rows along the prosthetic length and 5 columns along the radial direction, as shown in the right side of FIG. 4 .\n\nthe number of sampling points has been chosen to be 130 to limit the computational time required for the analysis and optimization, while providing a reasonable resolution for the relative density distribution. For a more refined density distribution, the number of sample points can be increased. Their values have been constrained in the range 0.1 â 1 to prevent elastic buckling from occurring in the unit cell prior to yielding.\n\nthe values of the relative density between the sampling points are obtained through linear interpolation.\n\nthe shape of the implant could be included in the vector b as a design variable ( FIG. 2 ).\n\nthe functions allow the values of the stiffness for a given relative density assigned to each sample point to be found for the finite element model of the implant. It is noted that the expressions of Young' moduli and Poisson's ratios in the x 1 and x 2 directions do not change since the cell thickness is uniform.\n\nthe non-dominated sorting genetic (NSGA-II) algorithm (Deb et al., 2002) is employed to solve the multiobjective optimization problem.\n\nthe strain energy within the bone and the stress distribution at the bone-implant interface is then calculated and used in Eqs. (7-8) to evaluate the objective functions.\n\nthe initial population is then sorted based on the non-domination front criterion.\n\na population of solutions, called parents are selected from the current population, based on their rank and crowding distance.\n\ngeneric operators are applied to the population of parents to create a population of off-springs.\n\nthe next population is produced by taking the best solutions from the combined population of parents and off-springs.\n\nthe optimization continues until the user-defined number of function evaluations reaches 25000 (Deb et al., 2002).\n\nthe stress recovery procedure is applied to verify whether the stresses are admissible.\n\nthe average macroscopic strain inside each unit cell is found.\n\nthe position of each unit cell within the implant is obtained after imposing a proper cell tessellation, which in this work has been set to be uniform.\n\nthe size of the unit cell is selected as small as possible to capture the relative distribution contour with higher resolution.\n\nthe square cell sizes for the cell wall thickness of either 70 or 100 â m have been selected respectively as 1.36 and 1.8 mm.\n\nthe values of relative density and macroscopic strain at these points are obtained from the relative density distribution and macroscopic strain field. For Gauss points located outside the implant border, the values are linearly extrapolated from those located at the neighboring points inside the implant domain. Using a Gaussian quadrature integration (Zienkiewicz and Taylor, 2005) the average relative density and macroscopic strain of each cell are calculated. The local stress distribution and the yield safety factor of each cell are obtained through the von Mises stress criterion. The procedure is applied to all unit cells of the selected optimal design located on the Pareto frontier and the minimum local safety factor of a cell is specified as design safety factor.\n\nFIG. 7 shows all the optimum solutions, i.e. the relative density distribution, for a hip stem implant with graded cellular material.\n\nthe x axis represents the amount of bone resorption for the implanted hip; on the y axis is the interface failure index.\n\nthree representative relative density distributions were examined: the extreme points.\n\na solution B characterized by a 50% weight factor For each solution, in FIG. 7 are given the following performance metrics: bone resorption (m r ), interface failure index (F(b)), maximum interface failure (f( â ) max ), average porosity of each stem ( â ), and design safety factor (SF) after implementing the stress recovery procedure.\n\nthe maximum interface failure f( â ) max is included since F(b), which quantifies only the overall effect of the implant stiffness on the interface stresses, is not sufficient to provide information on the probability of failure.\n\nthe porosity of solutions A, B, and C is greater than 40%, which is satisfactory for bone ingrowth (Bragdon et al., 2004).\n\nan increase is seen of the implant porosity from point C to A results in an implant stiffness decrease, which on one hand lowers bone loss and on the other hand enhances the risk of interface failure.\n\nsolution B is compared to C, a reduction of 8% of bone resorption is noted with a slight increase of the peak value of the interface failure.\n\nsolution B a significant increase (60%) of the peak value of interface failure is seen, which is still below the Hoffman failure strength, while a minor reduction (2%) of the amount of bone resorption is demonstrated.\n\nthe main benefit of solution A is the maximum porosity of the microstructure that can promote bone ingrowth.\n\nB might be the preferred solution with respect to low bone resorption and interface failure, other parameters should be taken into account for the selection of the best implant. These include patient's bone characteristics, the range of activity, age, and desired level of bone mass preservation after implantation.\n\nthe metrics of resorbed bone mass (m r ) and distribution of interface stress (f( â b )) of the optimal solution B were compared with those of i) a currently-used fully dense titanium stem and ii) a cellular implant with a uniformly distributed relative density of 50%.\n\nFIGS. 8 and 9 illustrate the results of the comparison.\n\nthe amount of bone resorption calculated through Eq. (7) is 67%, and the interface failure index F(b) obtained from Eq (8) is 1.33.\n\nthe maximum value of interface failure (0.51) occurs at the distal end of the implant.\n\nthis implant is much stiffer than the surrounding bone, thereby resulting in a higher amount of bone resorption.\n\nthe interface shear stress of the titanium implant at the proximal region is also compared with the one obtained by Kowalczyk for a 3D model (Kowalczyk, 2001).\n\nthe mean and the maximum values of interface shear stress for the 3D titanium implant in the work by Kowalczyk (2001) are 0.57 and 2.8 MPa, respectively. These values are 0.31 and 2.15 MPa respectively for the titanium implant in this paper.\n\nthe contribution to the higher level of shear stress in the 3D model of Kowalczyk is the distribution of shear force on a smaller area.\n\nthe implant and bone are bonded only at the proximal region, while in our work the whole bone-implant interface is bonded, which results in a decrease of the mean and the maximum values of interface shear stress.\n\nthe cellular implant with uniform relative density of 50% is approximately three times more flexible than the titanium stem.\n\nThis implant can qualitatively simulate the behavior of an implant made out of tantalum foam.\n\nthe amount of bone resorption and the interface failure index are about 34% and 2.87, respectively, and the interface failure is maximum (0.71) at the edge of proximal region.\n\nthe amount of bone resorption decreases by 50%, whereas the maximum interface failure increases about 40%. This shows that a decrease of the implant stiffness with uniform porosity distribution aiming at reducing bone resorption has the undesirable effect of increasing the risk of interface failure at the proximal region. This result confirms the findings of the previous work by Kulper and Huiskes (1992).\n\nFIGS. 8 c and 9 c show the results for the graded cellular implant B.\n\nIts bone resorption and interface failure index are 16% and 1.15 respectively.\n\nthe peak value of the local interface failure is 0.25.\n\nboth the amount of bone resorption and the interface failure peak decrease by 76% and 50%, respectively.\n\nthe decrease of bone resorption and interface failure peak is of 53% and 65%, respectively.\n\na graded cellular implant with optimized relative density distribution is thus capable of reducing concurrently both the conflicting objective functions.\n\nbone resorption reduces as a result of the cellular material which makes the implant more compliant; the interface stress, on the other hand, is minimized by the optimized gradients of cellular material.\n\nFIG. 10 shows the polypropylene prototype of solution B, which was manufactured with the 3D printer Objet Connex500TM. A uniform tessellation and a square unit cell of 1.8 mm size were assumed to draw the model. The cell geometry was calculated from the average relative density obtained from the method described in this paper. An STL file of the graded cellular Implant, solution B, was finally used for rapid prototyping.\n\nAn orthopaedic hip implant is expected to support dynamic forces generated by human activities.\n\nthe prosthesis is to be designed for fatigue under high cycle regime.\n\na methodology has been developed to design a novel hip implant made of a cellular material with a periodic microarchitecture (Khanoki and Pasini, 2012).\n\nthis implant is completely porous with a lattice microstructure displaying graded property distribution. The advantage of controlling the microarchitecture is twofold.\n\nthe overall implant can be designed to be more compliant, which reduces stress shielding and bone resorption (Behrens et al., 2008; Glassman et al., 2006; Huiskes et al., 1992; Pettersen et al., 2009).\n\nthe material porosity can be optimized to also reduce bone-implant interface stresses, thereby lowering implant micromotion. Although encouraging, these results have been obtained by applying a static loading regime to the implant, thus neglecting the impact of an applied cyclic loading that generally boosts the risk of fatigue failure.\n\nporous tantalum has been recently proved to be effective in facilitating bone ingrowth. For this reason, porous tantalum has been lately the object of studies aiming at characterizing its fatigue fracture mechanisms (Sevilla et al., 2007; Zardiackas et al., 2001). Similar to open cellular foams, porous tantalum has a random cellular microstructure which is typically imparted by the manufacturing process, which involves a chemical deposition of pure tantalum on carbon skeleton (Bobyn et al., 2004; Murr et al., 2010; Murr et al., 2009).\n\nthe joints are indeed the weakest parts of a cellular material, because stress peaks localize in those regions and thus severely reduce fatigue strength.\n\nthe geometry of the cell joints i.e. the locations where the struts converge, is designed to level out any curvature discontinuity (Abad et al., 2012)\n\nthe joint strength can be significantly increased, thereby improving the fatigue strength of the cellular material.\n\nAH Asymptotic Homogenization\n\nâ ij ( â ) is the virtual strain\n\nâ ij kl (u) is the microstructural strain corresponding to the component kl of the macroscopic strain tensor ( â kl )\n\nY c is the solid part of the cell\n\nE ijkl is the local elasticity tensor.\n\nâ â ij E ij â ? â M ? â ? â ? â â _ ? â n â â ? â indicates text missing or illegible when filed ( 4 )\n\nthe microscopic stress distribution â ij can, therefore, be related to the multiaxial macroscopic stress â ij by the following relation:\n\nâ â ij E ijkl â M k â ? â ? â ( E ? â ?

We selected 30% for the Kagome, because for a 50% relative density the base material almost completely fills the triangular voids, and thus the Kagome structure cannot be realized.\n\nthe multiaxial endurance limit of the cell can be obtained by scaling the yield surface with the coefficient given in equation (7).\n\nequation (8) can be inserted into equation (8) for the infinite-life design of cellular structures under multiaxial fatigue loading conditions.\n\nthe Table FIG. 11 ) lists the functions along with relative fitting parameters of the yield surfaces for the unit cells here under investigation.\n\na pyramid with an elliptical base is used to resemble the yield surface.\n\nF xy * ( FIG. 11) governs both the slenderness ratio and the inclination of the major axis of the elliptical base.\n\nFIG. 15( b ) For the Kagome cell ( FIG. 15( b ), the yield surface is approximated by a parallelogram, and m 1 and m 2 ( FIG. 11) are the slopes of the parallelogram lines, expressed as a function of the relative density.\n\nthe parameters â xx y , â yy y , â xy y ( FIG. 11 ) are the yield strength of the unit cell under uni-axial and shear stresses.\n\nFIGS. 16( a ) and 16 ( b ) show the variation of the yield strength as a function of relative density. When the material is fully dense, the yield strength is equal to that of its solid material.\n\na common feature in the plots of FIG. 16 is the abrupt decrease of the effective yield strength for decreasing values of relative density.\n\nFIG. 17 illustrates the methodological steps to design a graded cellular implant for infinite fatigue life.\n\nthe approach combines multiscale mechanics and multiobjective optimization.\n\nthe former deals with the scale-dependent material structure, where the local problem of the RVE is first solved, and then the effective elastic moduli and yield strength are obtained and used as homogenized properties of the macroscopic model of the implant.\n\nthe latter handles the conflicting nature of bone resorption and implant interface stress.\n\na fatigue failure theory can thus be embedded in the procedure to design the implant for infinite fatigue life.\n\nFIG. 17 A brief description of the main steps identified by the numbers in the flowchart is given in FIG. 17 .\n\nf( â ) is defined as the interface failure caused by shear stress, and is expressed as\n\nthe values of mean porosity and pore size are selected to ensure bone ingrowth (Bragdon et al., 2004; Harrysson et al., 2008), and the minimum thickness of the cell walls is determined by the resolution of the manufacturing process, i.e. the manufacturing limits.\n\nFIG. 18( a ) shows the geometry of the femur considered in this work along with the applied loads and boundary conditions.\n\nCT scan data of a 38-year-old male obtained through the visible human project (VHP) database of the national library of medicine (NLM, USA), is used to construct the 3D model of the femur.\n\nthe mid-frontal section of the femur is considered for the 2D model geometry.\n\na side plate is also considered for the 2D model.\n\nthe 2D model and the side plate have variable thickness such that the second moment of area about the out-of-plane axis of the 2D model does not differ from that of the 3D model (Huiskes et al., 1987; Weinans et al., 1992).\n\nthe apparent density â for each element of the FE model is then determined by the Hounsfield value (HU) measured from CT data.\n\nHU Hounsfield value\n\na linear relation between HU and apparent density is considered, where the maximum value of HU corresponds to the most dense region of the cortical bone, where the maximum value of apparent density is 2.0 g/cm 3 , and HU value of water and its apparent density are equal to zero. From the apparent density distribution, the effective elastic moduli of bone are obtained through the relation (Austman et al., 2008; Baca et al., 2008; Peng et al., 2006):\n\nAn isotropic material model is considered for the bone, as this simplification does not lead to a noticeable difference from those results obtained by assigning orthotropic material property to the bone (Baca et al., 2008; Peng et al., 2006).\n\nthe distal end of the femur is fixed to avoid rigid body motion, and three loading cases. 1, 2, and 3, representing the cyclic load during walking movements are applied to the hip joint and the abductor (Carter et al., 1989; PÃ©rez et al., 2010; Weinans et al., 1992).\n\nthe magnitudes and the direction of the hip joint (the abductor) forces are, respectively, for the different load cases: 1) 2317 N at 24Â° from vertical (702 N at 28Â° from vertical), 2) 1158 N at 15Â° from vertical (351 N at 8Â° from vertical), 3) 1548 N at 56Â° from vertical (468 N at 35Â° from vertical).\n\nANSYS Canonsburg, Pa. U.S.A\n\na 2D eight-node element type (Plane 82) is used since it can model curved boundaries with high accuracy.\n\nFIG. 18( b ) illustrates the model of a cementless prosthesis implanted into the femur.\n\nthe grid depicts the domain of the implant to be designed with a functionally graded lattice material.\n\nthe variable of the lattice model is the relative density attributed to 115 sampling points, 23 rows along the prosthetic length and 5 columns along the radial direction.\n\nthe values of relative density are constrained in the range 0.1 â 1 to prevent elastic buckling in the unit cell from occurring prior to yielding (Wang and McDowell, 2004).\n\nthe relative density distribution throughout the implant is obtained by linear interpolation between the corresponding values at the sampling points.\n\nthe homogenized stiffness matrix and the yield surfaces of each element are then computed from those values respectively illustrated in FIG. 11 .\n\nthe former is employed to assemble the global stiffness matrix for the Finite Element (FE) solver, and the latter is used to construct the Soderberg diagram for fatigue analysis.\n\nFE Finite Element\n\nthe implant Since the implant is designed to have a cellular microstructure with suitable pore size for bone ingrowth, it is assumed that the prosthesis and the surrounding bone are fully bonded (Khanoki and Pasini, 2012; Kowalczyk, 2001). This choice significantly decreases the computational cost required for the stability analysis based on a non-linear frictional contact model (Viceconti et al., 2000). Although bone ingrowth does not exist in a postoperative situation, it can appear later, if local mechanical stability is guaranteed. It is expected, however, that the minimization of interface stress reduces the risk of interface micromotion and instability (Kowalczyk, 2001).\n\nTi6Al4V Parthasarathy et al., 2010\n\nEBM Electron Beam Melting\n\nthe procedure illustrated in section 3 is applied for the fatigue design of the implant after having calculated the yield and fatigue strengths of the microstructure, as described in section 2.\n\nthe non-dominated sorting genetic (NSGA-II) algorithm (Deb et al., 2002) is here used.\n\nNSGA-II non-dominated sorting genetic\n\nparents Once the initial population is evaluated, a set of solutions, called parents, are selected based on their rank and crowding distance. Genetic operators are then applied to the population of parents to create a population of off-springs. Finally, the next population is produced by taking the best solutions from the combined population of parents and off-springs.\n\nthe optimization continues until the user-defined number of function evaluations reaches 25000 (Deb et al., 2002).\n\nthe computational cost required to run the optimization process in a single 2.4 GHz Intel processor was about 300,000 CPU seconds, 3 and a half days. Parallel computing with a PC cluster will considerably reduce the computational time, since each function evaluation can be performed independently.\n\nFIGS. 19( a ) and 19 ( b ) show all the optimum relative density distributions for a hip stem implant designed with square and Kagome cell topologies.\n\nthe x axis represents the amount of bone resorption for the implanted hip, and on the y axis is the interface failure index.\n\nKagome is a stretching dominated cell with higher mechanical strength compared to the square cell for a given relative density. This provides a wider range of relative density for the optimization search to choose the design variable from, and control the stress distribution at the interface. Moreover, lower values of relative density can be selected to increase the implant flexibility and reduce bone resorption.\n\nmechanical strength other physical parameters, such as pore shape, interconnectivity, permeability and diffusivity of the unit cell, should be taken into account for the selection of a proper lattice cell for bone tissue scaffolding (Hollister, 2005; Hollister et al., 2008; Kang et al., 2010; Reilly and Engler, 2010; Van Bael et al., 2012). Further research is required in the near future to address these aspects.\n\nAH is applied for the multiscale analysis of the cellular implants.\n\nthis method is quite effective in computing the stress and strain distribution at each scale, its accuracy needs to be investigated especially at regions where the underlying assumption, Y-periodicity of field quantities, is not satisfied. This can include regions with a high gradient of field quantities or in the vicinity of borders (Dumontet, 1986; Ghosh et al., 2001; Lefik and Schrefler, 1996; Raghavan and Ghosh, 2004; Takano et al., 2003; Yuan and Pagano, 2003).\n\nthe multilevel computational method can be used for the analysis of these critical regions (Ghosh et al., 2001; Raghavan and Ghosh, 2004).\n\nThis method decomposes the computational domain into two levels of hierarchy: a) the detailed cellular microstructure and b) the homogenized medium.\n\nthe region of interest composed of a cellular microstructure, is modeled by a fully detailed FE analysis; to assess the validity of the periodicity assumption the FE results are compared with those obtained from the homogenization method.\n\nthe following criterion can be defined to measure the departure from the periodicity conditions:\n\nthe function F is a function of ( â ij , â ij ) and can be defined, for example, as the average of the microscopic stress over the RVE.\n\nthe superscript FEA refers to the evaluation of the function F via a detailed finite element analysis of a given microstructure.\n\nthe macroscopic displacement solution obtained from the homogenized model, is imposed on the unit cell boundary of the detailed FE model, and the stress and strain distribution within the microstructure is obtained.\n\nthe superscript RVE corresponds to the computation of F for each RVE through the imposition to the unit cell of a macroscopic strain with periodic boundary conditions.\n\na) the average and b) the maximum value of von Mises stress over the unit cell are considered respectively to evaluate the validity of the periodicity condition at macroscale, and to assess the accuracy of AH in capturing the yield strength of the microstructure.\n\nFIG. 20 illustrates the macroscopic von Mises stress distribution throughout the square and Kagome lattice implants associated with the loading condition number 1 applied to the hip joint.\n\nthe mesh of the macroscopic elements at the vicinity of the implant border has been refined to capture the interface stresses with a higher resolution.\n\nthe stress and relative density distribution, shown in FIG. 20 corresponds to the solutions B in FIG. 19 .\n\nthe microstructures need to be constructed at the specified regions.\n\na 2 â 2 mm size is selected to satisfy the manufacturing constraint (t min â 0.1 mm for â 0.1) and to uniformly tessellate the regions with a 5 â 5 cells block,\n\nthe RVE has a rectangular shape with the same cell size as the square in the x direction.\n\nâ ij and W ij are the relative density and weight factors at each Gauss point, respectively.\n\nthe relative density at each Gauss point is obtained with respect to its local coordinates within the macroscopic element of the homogenized model ( FIG. 21 ).\n\nthe cell geometry can be constructed for both the square and Kagome lattices, as depicted in FIG. 20 .\n\nthe displacement of the macroscopic solution is then imposed on the boundary of the cells block (Raghavan and Ghosh, 2004), so as to calculate the stress distribution of the microstructure.\n\nthe average and the maximum von Mises stress for the unit cells is then computed and used in equation (13) to assess the validity and accuracy of the AH results.\n\nFIG. 22 illustrates the macroscopic strains distribution, â xx , â yy , â xy , over the regions proximal and closed to the boundary of the square and Kagome lattice implants.\n\nthe average macroscopic strain for each unit cell is computed; the strain tensor is used in equation (2) to obtain the microscopic strain distribution throughout the microstructure, from which the microscopic stresses are calculated via the constitutive equation of the base material.\n\nthe microscopic stress distribution of the unit cell located at the center of the block is compared with those obtained from a detailed FEA.\n\nthe stress distribution within the cell in the middle of the first column of FIG. 8 is considered.\n\nthe von Mises stress distribution of the unit cells, obtained by AH and by detailed FE analysis, are given in the Table ( FIG. 12 ).\n\nthe average and the maximum value of von Mises stress over the unit cells obtained by AH are also compared with the detailed FE analysis, and the relative errors, defined by equation (13), are illustrated in FIG. 12 .\n\nthe stress distribution at the microscopic level can be captured with a reasonable accuracy, particularly for those cells located in the middle of the block.\n\nthe average and the maximum value of von Mises stress can be estimated with an error of 0.98% and 7.1%, respectively.\n\na higher relative error for the microscopic stresses is anticipated as the Y-periodic assumption is not satisfied.\n\nthe relative error for the average and the maximum von Mises stress for the Kagome lattice located at the implant boundary is 3.8% and 18.6%, respectively.\n\nFIG. 23( a ) shows that for a fully dense implant, bone mass loss is about 71.4%.\n\nThis initial postoperative configuration of bone loss is in good agreement with that in literature (Huiskes et al., 1992; Weinans et al., 1992).\n\na high amount of bone resorption is found throughout the medial and lateral part of the femur around the fully dense stem.\n\nthe amount of initial postoperative bone loss of the square and Kagome lattice implants decreases, respectively, by 53.8% and 58%. This shows that the design of a flexible implant through a graded cellular material has the beneficial effect of improving the load-sharing capacity of the implant with the surrounding bone, thereby reducing bone resorption.\n\nFIG. 24 shows the distribution of the local shear interface failure, f( â ), around the fully dense titanium, square and Kagome lattice implants.\n\nf( â ) the maximum value of interface failure caused by any of three loading cases. Since the function f( â ) is the interface shear stress normalized with respect to the local shear strength of the bone, high probability of interface failure is expected for f( â ) â 1, whereas for f( â ) â 1 the risk of interface failure is low.\n\nthe maximum value of shear interface failure occurs at the distal end with magnitude of 0.96. This means that the shear stress is almost equal to the shear strength of the host bone, which may cause interface micromotion and prevent bone ingrowth.\n\nthe maximum shear interface failure reduces significantly of about 79% to 0.19 and 0.2, respectively.\n\nAn optimized graded distribution of the cellular microarchitecture can reduce the stress distribution at the implant interface.\n\nthe interface shear stress of fully dense titanium implant is also compared with those obtained in literature (Kuiper and Huiskes, 1992; 1996). We have that the interface shear stress varies from 3.8 MPa at the proximal region to the maximum value of 42 MPa at the distal end, which is in good agreement with the stress regime available in (Kuiper and Huiskes, 1992; 1996).\n\nthe fatigue analysis of the fully dense titanium implant shows that its safety factor is 4.95. Although this value is about two times higher than the corresponding value of the Kagome lattice implant, a safety factor of 2.3 for Kagome lattice implant can be still considered as a reasonably safe margin for the design against fatigue fracture.\n\na lattice with smooth cell geometry could be considered (Abad et al., 2012), or the implant core can be designed as fully dense.\n\nFIG. 25 shows the proof-of-concept implant with a uniform tessellation of unit cells with 2 mm size. Using the projection of the cell geometry in a 2D plane, the average relative density of each cell was computed from the method described above. The cubic cells with a uniform wall thickness were then used as a building block to construct the implant. Finally, an STL file of the graded cellular implant was used for rapid prototyping.\n\nthe supporting material deposited during the manufacturing process was washed out with a water jet, and a graded cellular implant with interconnected porosity respecting bone ingrowth requirements was fabricated. No sign of fracture or incomplete cell walls was observed, showing the structural integrity of the cellular implant.\n\na hip-joint implant with a graded lattice material can improve the load sharing capacity of the implant with the surrounding bone tissues as well as decrease the amount of bone resorption.\n\nthe implant microstructure has been designed against fatigue fracture to support cyclic loads in the hip joint.\n\nAsymptotic homogenization has been used for the multiscale analysis of the structure to obtain the stress distribution at the macro and micro scale, while the Soderberg fatigue criterion has been integrated in the procedure to design the implant for infinite fatigue life. The numerical results obtained have been validated via a detailed FE analysis.\n\nLandscapes\n\nHealth & Medical Sciences (AREA)\n\nEngineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nVeterinary Medicine (AREA)\n\nPublic Health (AREA)\n\nGeneral Health & Medical Sciences (AREA)\n\nAnimal Behavior & Ethology (AREA)\n\nLife Sciences & Earth Sciences (AREA)\n\nOral & Maxillofacial Surgery (AREA)\n\nOrthopedic Medicine & Surgery (AREA)\n\nChemical & Material Sciences (AREA)\n\nTransplantation (AREA)\n\nManufacturing & Machinery (AREA)\n\nTheoretical Computer Science (AREA)\n\nPhysics & Mathematics (AREA)\n\nVascular Medicine (AREA)\n\nHeart & Thoracic Surgery (AREA)\n\nBiomedical Technology (AREA)\n\nCardiology (AREA)\n\nEpidemiology (AREA)\n\nMaterials Engineering (AREA)\n\nEvolutionary Computation (AREA)\n\nComputer Hardware Design (AREA)\n\nGeneral Physics & Mathematics (AREA)\n\nGeometry (AREA)\n\nGeneral Engineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nDermatology (AREA)\n\nMedicinal Chemistry (AREA)\n\nDispersion Chemistry (AREA)\n\nMechanical Engineering (AREA)\n\nDentistry (AREA)\n\nProstheses (AREA)\n\nArchitecture (AREA)\n\nSoftware Systems (AREA)\n\nAbstract\n\nA methodology integrating multiscale analysis and design optimization to design a novel bone replacement implant made of a functionally graded cellular material that meets fatigue requirements imposed by cyclic loadings. The pore microarchitecture, described by interconnectivity, porosity, pore size as well as pore topology, is optimally designed for tissue regeneration and mechanical strength. The method can contribute to the development of a new generation of bone replacement implants with a graded cellular microstructure.\n\nDescription\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\nThis application is a continuation of International Patent Application No. PCT/CA2012/001191 filed Dec. 21, 2012 which claims priority on U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/579,758 filed Dec. 23, 2011, the contents of both of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\nThe present disclosure relates to the field of orthopaedic implants, and more particularly to methods and systems for designing orthopaedic implants, as well as the implants themselves produced in accordance with such design methods.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nRevision surgeries of total hip arthroplasty are often caused by a deficient mechanical biocompatibility of the implant. Mechanical biocompatibility is a general term that refers to the ability of the implant to harmonize its mechanical properties with those of the host bone. Two main culprits, among others, for revision surgery are bone-implant interface instability and bone resorption.\n\nCurrent orthopedic prostheses are generally made of uniform density, homogenous material such as 316L stainless steel, cobalt chromium alloys, titanium-based alloys and tantalum. Over the last few decades, the design of the orthopedic prostheses has been improved to achieve long-term fixation and easy osseointegration. Although technological advances have made current total hip arthroplasty successful, over 13% of the hip prostheses still require revision surgeries as a result of bone resorption and aseptic loosening of the implant (Kurtz et al., 2007). Revision surgery is a much more complex procedure than the first total hip arthroplasty (THA) due to bone degradation around the first implant. Bone degradation compromises bone ability to adequately secure the new implant.\n\nAlthough patient-related factors, such as sickle cell anaemia (Vichinsky et al., 1999), poor bone quality (Kobayashi et al., 2000), and high body mass index may predispose the patient to prosthetic failures, mechanical rather than medical factors are major causes of implant failure (Kowalcyk, 2001).\n\nCurrent orthopaedic implants are generally stiffer than the bone adjacent to the prosthesis. Due to its stiffness, an implant prevents the applied stress from being transferred to the adjacent bone, thereby resulting in bone resorption around the implant. This weakens the implant support, which leads to bone fracture and implant loosening. Over the last three decades, alternative implant designs have been proposed to reduce stress shielding and minimize the associated clinical consequences (Glassman et al., 2006). Recent implant designs have only been partially successful, as the solution of one problem has given rise to another one. For example, to overcome the mismatch between a stiff stem and the adjacent bone, composite and isoelastic hip stems were introduced (Adam et al., 2002; Trebse et al., 2005). The results of these studies showed an undesired increase of the shear stress between the implant and the bone, an outcome that increases the risk of interface motion (Harvey et al., 1999; Huiskes et al., 1992). These attempts help elucidate the conflicting nature of stress shielding and bone-implant interface stability, which remain a major challenge.\n\nThe conflict existing between stress shielding and interface shear stress have been identified in the seminal work of Kuiper and Huiskes (1992; 1997), who attempted to find a trade off design of a bidimensional hip implant. They showed that one solution to this issue is an implant whose material properties vary locally throughout the structure. A non-homogeneous distribution of elastic properties within the hip stem could contribute to minimizing the probability of interface failure while concurrently limiting the amount of bone loss. In their approach, however, the solution of the multi-objective problem has been simplified, reformulated and solved with a single objective optimization strategy. As a result the whole set of trade-off designs could not have been captured. Hedia et al. (2006; 2004) attempted to reconcile the conflicting nature of these objective functions by proposing to use three bioactive materials: hydroxyapatite, bioglass, and collagen, to design a graded cementless hip stem. Although their implant design reduced bone resorption and bone-implant interface stresses, the use of such bioactive materials have limitations due to their brittleness and insufficient strength when applied to load-bearing applications (Watari et al., 1997; Katti, 2004; Thompson and Hench, 1998). In a more recent study, Fraldi et al. (2010) applied a maximum stiffness topological optimization strategy to re-design a hip prostheses with the goal of reducing stress shielding in the femur. According to this method, elements with intermediate volume fraction (between 0 and 1) are penalized to limit their presence in the final solution. For regions with intermediate relative density, certain microstructures should be proposed to match those materials in terms of effective elastic properties. Laser micro-drilling is suggested to create the required micro-porosity, an option that can be used only on the implant surface, not throughout the implant.\n\nOther advances in total hip replacement have used a microstructural material over a fully dense material. Hip implants with porous tantalum have been proposed in knee and hip replacement surgery (Bobyn et al., 2004). Tantalum foam is an excellent material due to its biocompatibility, high volumetric porosity, and modulus of elasticity similar to that of bone. To create the tantalum foam, pure tantalum is chemically deposited on a carbon skeleton. Consequently, the microstructure of a tantalum foam implant has an almost uniform and random distribution of pore shape and size (Bobyn et al., 2004) throughout the implant. These material characteristics, however, have been demonstrated incapable of solving the conflicting nature of the physiological phenomena occurring in an implant (Kuiper and Huiskes, 1992; 1997). Whereas the reduced stiffness of the foam decreases bone resorption, the uniform distribution of cells has the undesired effect of increasing the interface stresses.\n\nTherefore, there is a need for improved methods and systems for designing orthopaedic implants, and for improved implants designed by such methods.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAccording to a broad aspect of the present invention there is provided a graded cellular implant for bone replacement having a non-homogeneous distribution of material properties. The bone replacement implant is defined by a plurality of unit cells. Each unit cell has a lattice microstructure and a cell topology, either closed and/or open as well as a pore geometry. The pore geometry is defined by pore size, pore shape and wall thickness. The cell topology is optimized to ease mass transport conditions that influence cell phenotype, tissue ingrowth, and nutrient settings, as well as exhibiting a predetermined density pattern in the bone implant that is obtained to minimize bone loss and interface failure when implanted.\n\nIn accordance with a first aspect, there is provided a method for designing a graded cellular bone implant having non-homogeneous distribution of material properties comprising the steps of: generating a finite element model of the implant comprising a plurality of unit cells defining a lattice microstructure; calculating a homogenized stiffness tensor for each unit cell; determining a homogenous medium for each unit cell having an equivalent homogenized stiffness tensor; determining the average macroscopic strains and stresses on the implant using the homogenized stiffness tensors by conducting a finite element analysis; generating a microscopic stress field for each unit cell using a stress recovery procedure conducted on the determined macroscopic strains and stresses; determining if the microscopic stress field of each unit cell is below a predefined failure criterion, and if so, performing a multiobjective optimization to minimize bone loss and interface failure by optimizing at least one constraint including average porosity, mean pore size and cell wall thickness for each unit cell: generating a model of the graded cellular bone implant combining the optimized microscopic stress field of each unit cell.\n\nThere is also provided a method for producing a prosthetic graded cellular bone implant having non-homogeneous distribution of material properties comprising the steps of: generating a finite element model of the implant comprising a plurality of unit cells defining a lattice microstructure; calculating a homogenized stiffness tensor for each unit cell; determining a homogenous medium for each unit cell having an equivalent homogenized stiffness tensor; determining the average macroscopic strains and stresses on the implant using the homogenized stiffness tensors by conducting a finite element analysis; generating a microscopic stress field for each unit cell using a stress recovery procedure conducted on the determined macroscopic strains and stresses; determining if the microscopic stress field of each unit cell is below a predefined failure criterion, and if so, performing a multiobjective optimization to minimize bone loss and interface failure by optimizing at least one constraint including average porosity, mean pore size and cell wall thickness for each unit cell; generating a model of the graded cellular implant combining the optimized microscopic stress field of each unit cell; and producing the prosthetic graded cellular bone implant from the model of the graded cellular implant.\n\nIn an embodiment, the bone implant is a hip implant, a knee implant, an elbow implant, a shoulder implant, a wrist implant, an ankle implant or a dental implant. In another embodiment, the porosity of the implant is greater than or equal to 40%. In a further embodiment, the mean pore size of the implant is between 50 Î¼m and 800 Î¼m. In another embodiment, the cell wall thickness of each unit cell is between 70 Î¼m and 100 Î¼m.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nReference will now be made to the accompanying drawings.\n\nFIG. 1 is a flow chart in block diagram form illustrating the design methodology for the cell topology and the graded cellular hip implant including the fatigue analysis of the lattice material\n\nFIG. 2( a) illustrates a flow chart illustrating the design of a graded cellular hip implant minimizing bone resorption and implant interface failure, in accordance with an embodiment; FIG. 2( b) illustrates the conceptual design for graded cellular bone implant according to an embodiment wherein a three-dimensional view (a), a three-dimensional half-section (b), and a cellular bone element (c) are viewed.\n\nFIG. 3 illustrates the homogenization concept of a cellular structure.\n\nFIG. 4 illustrates a 2D Finite element models of the femur (left) and the prosthesis implanted into the femur (right).\n\nFIG. 5 illustrates a 2D hollow square unit cell for given values of relative density.\n\nFIG. 6 illustrates a curve showing the effective Young's modulus of 2D square lattice versus relative density, where solution points obtained through homogenization theory are fitted with the least squares method.\n\nFIG. 7 illustrates the trade-off distributions of relative density for the optimized cellular implant in accordance with an embodiment.\n\nFIG. 8 illustrates the distribution of bone resorption around (a) fully dense titanium implant, (b) cellular implant with uniform relative density of 50%, (c) graded cellular implant, and (d) an enlarged view of the unit cell having different microscopic stress field.\n\nFIG. 9 illustrates the distribution of local interface failure around (a) fully dense titanium implant, (b) cellular implant with uniform relative density of 50%, (c) graded cellular implant.\n\nFIG. 10 illustrates a polypropylene model of the optimal graded cellular implant in accordance with an embodiment.\n\nFIG. 11 is a mathematical table of the yield surfaces as a function of relative density for square and Kagome unit cells.\n\nFIG. 12 is a table illustrating the comparison of microscopic stress distribution obtained by detailed FEA an AH for the unit cells located at the proximal region and dosed to the implant border.\n\nFIGS. 13( a) and (b) are graphs of the effective elastic constants as a function of relative density for the (a) square and (b) Kagome lattices.\n\nFIGS. 14( a) to (d) illustrate the yield surface of a square cell topology under combined multiaxial macroscopic stress state ( Ï xx, Ï yy and Ï xy) for a relative density Ï=50%.\n\nFIGS. 15( a) to (d) illustrate the yield surface of a Kagome cell topology under combined multiaxial macroscopic stress state ( Ï xx, Ï yy and Ï xy) for a relative density p=30%.\n\nFIGS. 16( a) and (b) are graphs of the yield strength as a function of relative density for (a) square and (b) Kagome.\n\nFIG. 17 is a flow chart illustrating the fatigue design methodology of a graded cellular hip implant.\n\nFIGS. 18( a) and (b) are side and section views of (a) 2D Finite element models of the femur and (b) the prosthesis implanted into the femur.\n\nFIGS. 19( a) and (b) are illustrations of trade-off distributions of relative density for the optimized cellular implant made of (a) square and (b) Kagome lattices.\n\nFIGS. 20( a) and (b) are magnified views of regions used to assess the accuracy and validity the AH model (left and middle) with respect to a detailed FE analysis of a 5Ã5 lattice microstructure (right).\n\nFIGS. 21( a) and (b) are illustrations of (a) 3Ã3 Gauss points in the RVE; (b) superposition of the RVE on the macroscopic mesh of the homogenized model.\n\nFIGS. 22( a) to (d) are graphs of the macroscopic strain distribution (solution B in FIGS. 19( a) and 19(b) as a result of load case 1 at (a) the proximal part and (b) the border of the square lattice implant, and (c) the proximal part and (d) the border of the Kagome lattice implant.\n\nFIGS. 23( a) to (c) are section views illustrating distribution of bone resorption around (a) fully dense titanium implant, (b) graded cellular implant with square topology (solution B)"
