        "text": "Nicholson Constructionâs Midwest team was recently awarded two additional contracts for the New Lock at the Soo. One contract is for the construction of a hybrid wall and the other is for anchor installation.\n\nThe Phase 3 New Lock is the largest portion of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' (USACE) seven-year, $1.3 billion-dollar project focused on construction of a new lock chamber at the Soo Locks in Sault Ste Marie, Michigan.\n\nThe Soo Locks lie on the St. Marys River and permit vessels to cross the 21-foot change in elevation along the St. Marys Falls Canal and connects shipping between Lake Superior and Lake Huron. Currently, almost 90% of the commodities transported through the Soo Locks are restricted to using the 1,200' x 110' Poe Lock. This project will construct a second Poe-sized lock in place of the existing, decommissioned Sabin Lock. One of the first steps required for construction of the new lock is creating water cutoff around the future excavation to allow efficient dewatering throughout construction.\n\nThe Kokosing Alberici Traylor (KAT) joint venture selected Nicholson Construction Company to assist in construction of the Unit 10 Hybrid Wall, a component of the cutoff system, which will tie together existing coffer cells with new cells being constructed for the project. Nicholson drilled in temporary casings to allow installation of the permanent pipe piles for the wall.\n\nThe KAT JV also awarded Nicholson the contract for permanent anchor installation which is required to stabilize the existing Davis Lock concrete monoliths in the dewatered state.\n\nIn addition to the hybrid wall and anchor installation contracts, Nicholson is also installing drilled shafts and a grout curtain under separate contracts.\n\nâOur work continues to grow at the New Lock at the Soo project because we have such a great team on site,â said Dan Thome, P.E., Senior Vice President of Nicholsonâs Midwest Region. âOur site crews doing what they do every day are our best salespeople.â\n\nThis portion of Nicholsonâs work is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nÂ\n\nâ\n\nNicholson Constructionâs Midwest team was recently awarded two additional contracts for the New Lock at the Soo.
