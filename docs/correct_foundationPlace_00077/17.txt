Nicholson Construction Company has moved their headquarters from Cuddy, Pennsylvania, to the Zenith Ridge II Building at Southpointe in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania.

Nicholsonâs corporate headquarters and shop have shared their location in Cuddy since 1978. The shop will continue to operate there, while the corporate headquarters will move just a few miles away to Southpointe, a major business park that is also home to Mylan, Ansys, EQT and Consol.

âOur ongoing success and growth have made this move possible,â said Steve Scherer, President of Nicholson Construction. âThe new location at Southpointe creates a perfect environment for our team to grow, collaborate and continue to be one of the leading geotechnical problem-solvers in the country.â

The new corporate office is home to the companyâs engineering design team, risk management and finance and also, the Mid-Atlantic regionâs engineering, project management and construction team.

Nicholsonâs employees moved into the new space for their first day of work on February 1. The companyâs address is 2400 Ansys Drive, Suite 303, Canonsburg, PA, 15317. All phone and fax numbers will remain the same.
