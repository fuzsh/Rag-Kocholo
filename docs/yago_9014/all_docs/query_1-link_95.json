        "text": "“I said, ‘It has to be something where I can use all my aspects and talents,’” Schwarzenegger told The Hollywood Reporter of signing on. “‘It has to be fun. It has to be action-packed. It has to be sweet. And we shouldn’t try to get around my age — let’s play my age.’”\n\nAlongside Schwarzenegger, FUBAR – which takes its name from the military acronym – also features Monica Barbaro (Chicago Justice, Top Gun: Maverick), Milan Carter (Dolemite is My Name), Fortune Feimster (The Mindy Project) and more.\n\nWhile we wait for news on a potential second season, read on for everything you need to know about FUBAR.\n\nMore like this\n\nFUBAR landed on Netflix on Thursday 25th May 2023.\n\nThe new series consists of eight episodes, which blend action, drama and comedy for a total binge-watch of a series.\n\nWho stars in FUBAR alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger?\n\nSchwarzenegger lends his acting talents to FUBAR, which marks his first major TV series role. But, of course, the longstanding icon has been known for a multitude of roles over the years, including – but not limited to – The Terminator, Conan the Barbarian, Collateral Damage and The Expendables.\n\nHe leads the cast as nearly-retired Luke Brunner who is forced to team up with his daughter as CIA partners, despite only just learning that they're each operatives and have been keeping it a secret for years. Starring as his daughter Emma is Monica Barbaro, who has had leading roles in UnREAL, Chicago Justice and The Good Cop.\n\nThe full cast list for FUBAR is as follows.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger as Luke Brunner\n\nMonica Barbaro as Emma Brunner\n\nJay Baruchel as Carter\n\nAparna Brielle as Tina\n\nAndy Buckley as Donnie\n\nMilan Carter as Barry\n\nFortune Feimster as Ruth 'Roo'\n\nBarbara Eve Harris as Dot\n\nGabriel Luna as Boro\n\nFabiana Udenio as Tally Brunner\n\nTravis Van Winkle as Aldon\n\nDevon Bostick as Oscar\n\nDavid Chinchilla as Cain Khan\n\nRachel Lynch as Romi\n\nStephanie Sy as Sandy\n\nScott Thompson as Dr Louis Pfeffer\n\nAdam Pally as The Great Dane\n\nFUBAR plot\n\nThe drama centres on Luke and Emma as they learn that the other is actually working as a CIA operative after years of keeping their jobs a secret. Luke is on the verge of retirement when he discovers the family secret but is forced to go back into the field for one last job, meaning he'll have to partner up with his daughter.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong? Well, with the natural father-daughter dynamic rearing its head at the most inconvenient of times, the pair have to learn to work together while also navigating those universal family dynamics that viewers will be able to relate to. All set against a global backdrop of spies, subterfuge and humour, FUBAR is both action-packed and hilarious.\n\nFUBAR trailer\n\nThere most certainly is! In it, we get a sense of the chaos to come as we see Schwarzenegger delivering punches to enemies, and Barbaro's Emma having to navigate having her father on the field with her.\n\nWatch the trailer below.\n\nFUBAR comes to Netflix on Thursday 25th May 2023. Sign up for Netflix from £4.99 a month. Netflix is also available on Sky Glass and Virgin Media Stream.\n\nTake a look at the rest of our Drama coverage, or find out what else is on with our TV Guide and Streaming Guide."
