        "text": "THE NONPROFIT WORLD’S WORST NIGHTMARE IS COMING TO SHOWCASE\n\nCanwest’s new comedy series The Foundation premieres September 13\n\nFull episodes and bonus features will be available at showcase.ca\n\nFor additional photography and press kit materials visit: www.canwesttvmedia.com\n\nFor immediate release\n\nTORONTO, July 20, 2009 – If you have ever questioned Angelina, Bono and Madonna’s charitable motives, meet Michael Valmont-Selkirk. With him, the face of philanthropy never looked so crooked. Premiering Sunday, September 13, Showcase launches The Foundation, a brand-new half-hour comedy set in the elite world of charity. The five-episode series airs Sundays at 10:40 pm ET/PT (immediately following Weeds).\n\nThe Foundation takes a satirical, often absurdist look at philanthropy. Set in a world where sincerity and sentimentality are superseded by egos and greed, the series tells the story of Michael Valmont-Selkirk, an irresponsible, corrupt man holding the reins of The R.J. Selkirk Foundation, a powerful not-for-profit organization. While on the surface The R.J. Selkirk Foundation exists to help raise awareness for various causes and of course funds, in reality, Michael’s primary motivation for helping is the cause dearest to his heart – himself.\n\nOver the course of the season, The Foundation tackles a myriad of causes. Michael spends a night on the street with the homeless, sends a wheelchair athlete on a cross-country fundraiser and makes a dying girl’s dreams come true. However, with plans fueled by his desire for power, personal prestige and money, things seldom go as planned and often end up with disastrous – albeit hilarious – results.\n\nMichael Valmont-Selkirk is played by well-known stand-up comedian Mike Wilmot. Winner of countless Canadian and international comedy awards, Mike’s previous on-screen work includes the award-winning independent feature It’s All Gone Pete Tong.\n\nThe series reunites Wilmot with his It’s All Gone Pete Tong Director, Michael Dowse. In addition to directing, Dowse serves as Executive Producer and co-creator of the series alongside Jennifer Wilson. An award-winning writer, producer and director, Dowse is also behind the cult classic FUBAR.\n\n“With the incredible direction of Mike Dowse and a phenomenal ensemble cast led by Mike Wilmot, we know we have a hit on our hands. Showcase viewers are going to love the hilarity and sarcasm-soaked attitude of this outrageous series,” said Tara Ellis, Vice President, Showcase and Drama Content, Canwest Broadcasting. “The Foundation is a welcomed addition to our remarkable roster of Gemini Award nominated original Canadian comedies.”\n\n\"Mike Wilmot is the funniest human alive. All I'm doing is harnessing this renewable energy source so our children's children can live in a funnier world,” Said Michael Dowse, Creator, Executive Producer, Writer and Director, The Foundation.\n\nThe series also stars Martin Sims as “Barry”, the scheming CFO of The Foundation, as well as Rebecca Northan as the do-good executive vice-president. Quebec star Yvan Ponton is “Réjean Lemelin”, Michael Valmont-Selkirk’s nemesis from another charity. Paul J. Spence (of FUBAR fame) plays the foundation’s spokesperson “Apollo”, a famous rock-opera meets Cirque de Soleil star.\n\nViewers can get more of the series on showcase.ca. In addition to streaming full episodes, the website will make five exclusive behind the scene clips available. These two minute clips showcase the characters’ take on the going-ons within the R.J. Selkirk Foundation. The clips will be available in the showcase.ca video centre at www.showcase.ca/video."
