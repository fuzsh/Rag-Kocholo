        "text": "by Alain Elliott\n\nStars: Mark Heap, Sean Verey, Danny Kirrane, Perry Fitzpatrick, Ewen MacIntosh | Written and Directed by Ben Kent\n\nUs Brits do comedy horror pretty well. Of course, everyone around the world knows about Shaun of the Dead but there’s along list of other great films in the sub genre. From Lesbian Vampire Killers to Severance to Doghouse to Inbred to Stitches to Sightseers. These cover all different types of comedy and horror too, so F.U.B.A.R does have plenty of competition (or good company).\n\nAs well as comedy horror, people from Britain are also known for being pretty good at ‘Stag do’s’ (bachelor parties) and F.U.B.A.R mixes both of these together. A group of friends and the father of the bride embark on a paint-ball war against the undead (well, people dressed up as zombies anyway) only things don’t go as planned – when do they in a horror movie! – but it doesn’t go the way I expected either. Which is a good thing.\n\nI seem to have said this about several movies from this year’s Frightfest but one of the best parts of F.U.B.A.R are the death scenes. Both original and gruesome, nothing is left to the imagination and I believe without any CGI (or at least very little). All with some very cool and gory-looking practical effects. Made even more impressive because most of the deaths or injuries are objects going in or through people’s body parts.\n\nThankfully, F.U.B.A.R’s other positive is its comedy. I’ve seen plenty of comedy horror movies where I have barely laughed. I knew they were comedies and I understood the ‘jokes’ but they just weren’t funny to me. Here, the characters seem like ordinary guys that anyone can relate to and understand their situation (well at least for the first third until deaths start occurring). They react to things exactly how I imagine many people would (with a bit more ridiculousness, this is a comedy movie after all)\n\nThe comedy dialogue are things I have said when I was younger with a group of friends. It all just felt very natural and the cast are all very good comedic actors. If you watch any U.K. TV then you will recognise the majority of the main cast. With Mark Heap (Friday Night Dinner) and Ewen MacIntosh (The Office) the most well known, but everyone is on top of the game, David Mumeni (playing Toby) and Tim Faraday (playing Sergeant Marshall) in particular, were the standouts. And despite many flaws, the characters that we are supposed to root for are pretty damn likeable.\n\nF.U.B.A.R starts off very well and the first twenty minutes are just very very funny. It does get lost a bit somewhere in the middle third but things pick up again for the finale. Part Tucker and Dale Vs Evil, part Severance, F.U.B.A.R is really entertaining and deserves to sit alongside the British horror comedies I mentioned previously. And it even surpasses most of them for me with number of laughs and amount of gore.\n\n**** 4/5"
