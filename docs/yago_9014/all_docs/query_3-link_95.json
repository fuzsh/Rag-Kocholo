        "text": "Synopsis\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger fans are on cloud nine as they get to hear some of his iconic lines – all that in one work – FUBAR, thanks to showrunner and producer Nick Santora.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger makes his scripted television debut with FUBAR. However, it's not just his return to television that has fans excited. FUBAR is filled with his famous catchphrase in True Lies, \"That's it, and that's all,\" to the memorable lines from The Predator and The Terminator, FUBAR is packed with references to Schwarzenegger's blockbuster films.\n\nThe series, now streaming on Netflix, offers fans a chance to relive these classic quotes.\n\nFUBAR showrunner and executive producer Nick Santora expressed his excitement about working on this “surreal project.” Growing up watching Schwarzenegger films, Santora felt privileged to create the actor's first scripted television project.\n\nIt's no wonder that this season is filled with nostalgic movie references, paying homage to Schwarzenegger's illustrious career.\n\nEpisode 1 – \"Take Your Daughter To Work Day\"\n\nIn the first episode, viewers are treated to an unmistakable homage to Schwarzenegger's role as The Terminator with “You can’t be true to two!”.\n\nEpisode 2 – “Stole Train”\n\nThis episode features the classic line, \"Get to the Choppa!\" from Predator. Hearing Schwarzenegger say those words again is sure to bring a smile to any fan's face.\n\nEpisode 4 – “Armed & Dane-gerous\"\n\nSchwarzenegger delivers a line reminiscent of his Terminator character, demanding, \"I need your wallet and your gun.\"\n\nEpisode 6 – “Royally Flushed”\n\nIt doesn't include a direct quote, but Arnie's line, \"You seem to be shocked to see me,\" invokes memories of his role as Mr. Freeze in Batman & Robin and his knack for ice-related one-liners.\n\nEpisode 8 – \"That's It & That's All\"\n\nHere, Schwarzenegger references the \"Choppa!\" once again, showcasing his signature delivery. The episode's title itself is a nod to his latest catchphrase in the series, which he attributes to the film Throw Momma From The Train.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow old is Arnold Schwarzenegger?\n\nAs of May 2023, he is 75 years old.\n\nWhere is Arnold Schwarzenegger from?\n\nHe was born in Thal, Styria, Austria.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
