        "text": "FUBAR is a 2002 Canadian mokumentary / comedy directed by Michael Dowse and starring Paul Spence and David Lawrence. It was Official Selection at the Sundance Film Festival, premiering in the prestigious ‘Park City at Midnight‘ category which previously launched the Blaire Witch Project. The movie – shot on a budget of $10,000 and almost entirely improvised – became a cult hit in Canada, and went on to spawn a sequel (Fubar II: Balls to the Wall) a TV series (Fubar: Age of Computer), and crossover projects with Trailer Park Boys.\n\nMcCann was lead sound designer and music editor on the film (as M.A. McCann), as well as appearing in the film as the documentary “sound guy”. The audio of the movie was intentionally designed to be rough and lofi, with a soundtrack packed with iconic metal / hard rock tracks from AC/DC, Iron Maiden, Girlschool, and a companion soundtrack that includes tracks from bands like Sum 41, The New Pornographers, No Means No and Sloan."
