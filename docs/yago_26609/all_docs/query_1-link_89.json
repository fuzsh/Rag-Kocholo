        "text": "2. • In the 15th century, the Iberian Peninsula was divided into five large territories: the Crown of Castile, the Crown of Aragon, the Kingdom of Navarre, the Kingdom of Portugal and the Islamic Kingdom of Granada. • In 1469, Ferdinand, son of the king •of Aragon, married Isabella, •sister of the king of Castile.\n\n3. • The Catholic Monarchs is the collective title used in history for Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon. Their marriage united both crowns under the same family. • The Catholic Monarchs governed their territories together, but each kingdom had its own laws and institutions. It was the beginnings of modern Spain. • Isabella died in 1504. Ferdinand remarried Germaine of Foix; he died in 1516. They are buried in the Royal Chapel, in Granada.\n\n4. • The Catholic Monarchs restored the royal authority in Spain. They created the Holy Brotherhood, a judicial police force for Spain. They reorganised the justice system and created the Royal Council, the highest judicial body. They also created a permanent and professional army.\n\n5. The Kings annexed the Kingdom of Navarre, conquered Melilla and Oran in North Africa and the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean. They also expelled the Muslims from Granada (1492).\n\n6. • The Kings wanted to end the Christian Reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula and conquer the Muslim kingdom of Granada. After ten years of many battles, the Granada War ended in 1492 when Emir Boabdil surrendered the keys of the Alhambra Palace in Granada to the Castilian Monarchs.\n\n7. The Catholic Monarchs wanted religious unification for their kingdoms so they founded the Tribunal of the Inquisition to prosecute heretics. The tribunal was known for its severe sentences and punishments. Ferdinand and Isabella ordered that all Jews be expelled from Spain or they were forced to convert to Catholicism.\n\n8. • They authorized the expedition of Christopher Columbus, who wanted to reach the Indies sailing westward through the Atlantic Ocean. • All the territories conquered in America belonged to the Castilian Crown and they were called Reinos de Indias or simply Las Indias. • October 12th 1492, Columbus landed in the island of Guanahaní (renamed San Salvador, nowadays Bahamas). He explored Caribbean Sea and sailed back to Spain after founding first spanish settlement in America called “Fuerta Navidad”.\n\n9. Isabella I Ferdinand III Isabella Joanna John Maria Catherine Alfonso of Portugal Philip the Handsome Margaret of Austria Manuel I of Portugal Arthur of Wales Important ties with Portugal, ensuring peace, future alliance and unification of all iberian kingdoms. Alliance with the Holy Roman Empire. Ties with the Habsburg dynasty. More strength in the tie with Portugal. After the death of Arthur of Wales, she married Henry VIII, King of England.\n\n10. The Monarchs' joint motto was “Tanto monta, monta tanto”. The motto was created by Antonio de Nebrija and was an allusion to the explanation of the equality of the monarchs: Tanto monta, monta tanto, Isabel como Fernando (\"It's one and the same, Isabella the same as Ferdinand\") Their symbol was el yugo y las flechas, a yoke and a fasces. A double yoke is worn by a team of oxen, emphasizing the couple's cooperation. Isabella's emblem of arrows showed the armed power of the crown. Y and F are the initials of Ysabel (archaic spelling) and Fernando."
