        "text": "With King Pedro III of Aragon as King of Sicily, the Kingdom of Sicily, as well as the duchies of Athens and Neopatria, were finally implemented more firmly into the Crown of Aragon.\n\nThe Crown of Aragon was a Composite Monarchy ruled by one king. A Composite Monarchy is when a monarch rules several different states in personal union and not a political union. The Habsburg Monarchy before it was centralized into the Austrian Empire is an example of a Composite Monarchy.\n\nThe Crown of Aragon originated by the dynastic union of the Kingdom of Aragon and the County of Barcelona and ended as a consequence of the War of the Spanish Succession. At the height of its power in the 14th and 15th centuries, the Crown of Aragon was a thalassocracy controlling a large portion of present-day eastern Spain, parts of what is now southern France, and a Mediterranean empire which included the Balearic Islands, Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia, Malta, Southern Italy (from 1442) and parts of Greece (until 1388).\n\nThe Greek possessions were permanently lost to Nerio I Acciaioli in 1388 and Sicily was dissociated in the hands of King Martin I from 1395 to 1409, but the Kingdom of Naples was added finally in 1442 by the conquest led by King Alfonso V of Aragon.\n\nThe King’s possessions outside of the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands were ruled by proxy through local elites as petty kingdoms, rather than subjected directly to a centralised government. They were more an economic part of the Crown of Aragon than a political one.\n\nIn 1410, King Martin I of Sicily died without living descendants or heirs. As a result, by the Pact of Caspe, Infante Fernando of Antequera from the Castilian dynasty of Trastámara, received the Crown of Aragon as King Fernando I of Aragon.\n\nLater, in 1469, King Fernando I of Aragon’s grandson, King Fernando II of Aragon (also King of Sicily), married Infanta Isabella of Castile, half-sister of King Enrique IV of Castile. Infanta Isabella became Queen of Castile and León after Enrique IV’s death in 1474.\n\nTheir marriage was a dynastic union which became the constituent event for the dawn of the Kingdom of Spain. At that point both the Castile and the Crown of Aragon (including the Kingdom of Sicily) remained distinct territories, each keeping its own traditional institutions, parliaments and laws.\n\nThe process of territorial consolidation was completed when their grandson King Carlos I of Spain, known as Emperor Charles V, in 1516 united all the kingdoms on the Iberian peninsula, save the Kingdoms of Portugal and the Algarve, under one monarch—his co-monarch and mother Queen Joanna I in confinement—thereby furthering the creation of the Spanish state, albeit a decentralised.\n\nThe Kingdom of Sicily, as part of the Crown of Aragon, was also inherited by Carlos I of Spain when he inherited all of the Crowns of Castile, Léon and Aragon.\n\nQueen Isabella I of Castile and King Fernando II of Aragon had seven children, five of whom survived to adulthood:\n\n1. Infanta Isabella (1470–1498) married firstly to Afonso, Prince of Portugal, no issue. Married secondly to King Manuel I of Portugal, had Miguel da Paz, who died before his second birthday.\n\n2. A son, miscarried on May 31, 1475 in Cebreros\n\n3. Infante Juan (1478–1497), Prince of Asturias. Married Archduchess Margaret of Austria, no surviving issue.\n\n4. Infanta Joanna (1479–1555), Queen of Castile. Married Archduke Philipp the Handsome, of Austria, Duke of Burgundy. had issue.\n\n5. Infanta Maria (1482–1517), married King Manuel I of Portugal, her sister’s widower, had issue.\n\n6. A daughter, stillborn twin sister of Infanta Maria. Born on July 1, 1482 at dawn.\n\n7. Infanta Catherine of Aragon (1485–1536), married, first, Arthur, Prince of Wales, no issue; secondly, his younger brother, King Henry VIII of England, had Henry, Duke of Cornwall and Queen Mary I of England.\n\nEmperor Charles V’s mother, Infanta Joanna of Castile, was the younger child of Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Fernando II of Aragon, the Catholic Monarchs of Spain and both were members of the House of Trastámara.\n\nInfanta Joanna had a fair complexion, brown eyes and her hair colour was between strawberry-blonde and auburn, like her mother and her sister Infanta Catherine.\n\nThe heir to both kingdoms was Infante Juan, Prince of Asturias, the only son of King Fernando II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile. He heir apparent to both their thrones for nearly his entire life.\n\nHe was briefly wed to Archduchess Margaret of Austria, daughter of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, Archduke of Austria, and Duchess Mary of Burgundy. Archduchess Margaret was the sister of Archduke Philipp of Austria, Duke of Burgundy, who was married to Infanta Juan’s sister, Infanta Joanna of Castile.\n\nArchduchess Margaret of Austria, aged 16, married Infante Juan on April 3, 1497 in Burgos Cathedral. It was a good marriage and Juan was devoted to Margaret. Infante Juan of Castile and Aragon, Prince of Asturias died on October 4, 1497 possibly from tuberculosis, but rumours circulated Juan had died of sexual over-exertion at age eighteen. Six months later, on April 2, 1498, the Princess of Asturias gave birth to their only child, a stillborn girl.\n\nConsequences\n\nInfante Juan’s death was followed closely by that of his sister Infanta Isabella in 1498, who was married to, as her second husband, King Manuel I of Portugal. Their Her only child, Infante Miguel de la Paz of Portugal, died in 1500.\n\nIn 1496, Infanta Joanna, at the age of sixteen, was betrothed to the eighteen year old Archduke Philipp of Austria, in the Low Countries. Archduke Philipp’s parents were Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, and his first wife, Duchess Mary of Burgundy. The marriage was one of a set of family alliances between the Habsburgs and the Trastámaras designed to strengthen both against growing French power.\n\nInfanta Joanna entered a proxy marriage at the Palacio de los Vivero in the city of Valladolid, Castile, where her parents had secretly married in 1469. In August 1496 Infanta Joanna left from the port of Laredo in northern Castile on the Atlantic’s Bay of Biscay. Except for 1506, when she saw her younger sister Infanta Catherine, the then Dowager Princess of Wales, she would not see her siblings again.\n\nThe formal marriage took place on October 20, 1496 in Lier, north of present-day Brussels. Between 1498 and 1507, she gave birth to six children, two boys and four girls, all of whom grew up to be either emperors or queens.\n\nWith the death of her older brother, Infante Juan, Prince of Asturias, the claims to the Spanish Kingdoms passed to his younger sister Infanta Joanna, and her husband Archduke Philipp the Handsome of Austria, and had himself and Infanta Joanna declared as ‘Princes of Castile’ which her parents saw as disrespectful towards his deceased brother-in-law.\n\n“King Alfonso XII of Castile”\n\nThe league of nobles controlling Infante Alfonso forced King Enrique IV with the 1464 Representation of Burgos to repudiate Infanta Joanna, Princess of Asturias due to her alleged illegitimacy and recognize Infante Alfonso of Castile, the King’s brother, as his official heir.\n\nInfante Alfonso then became Prince of Asturias. Enrique agreed to the compromise with the stipulation that Infante Alfonso someday marry Joanna, (his half-niece), to ensure that they both would receive the crown.\n\nNot long after this, King Enrique IV reneged on his promise and began to support his daughter’s claim once more. On June 5, 1465, the nobles in league against him conducted a ceremonial deposition-in-effigy of King Enrique IV outside the city of Avila and crowned Infante Alfonso as a rival king, Alfonso XII of Castile.\n\nThis event is known as the Farce of Ávila. Shortly thereafter, Alfonso began handing out land and titles as if he were already the uncontested ruler. A civil war began. The most notable clash was at the Second Battle of Olmedo in 1467, which concluded as a draw.\n\nDeath and burial\n\nHowever, in 1468 at the age of only 14, Infante Alfonso suddenly died. The cause of death is not known, but it likely to have been an illness such as consumption or plague (although it is rumored that he had been deliberately poisoned or had his throat slit by his enemies).\n\nInfanta Isabella of Castile was afraid of opposition to her marrying Infante Fernando of Aragon therefore Infanta Isabella eloped from the court of Enrique IV with the excuse of visiting her brother Alfonso’s tomb in Ávila.\n\nInfante Ferdinand of Aragon, on the other hand, crossed Castile in secret disguised as a servant. They married immediately upon reuniting on October 19, 1469 in the Palacio de los Vivero in the city of Valladolid.\n\nInfanta Isabella of Castile became Castile’s next monarch when King Enrique IV died in 1474.\n\nAfter the death of King Enrique IV, war broke out in Castile. Infanta Joanna was supported by Portugal, while the eventual winner, Queen Isabella I of Castile, had the support of Aragon. France initially supported Joanna, yet in 1476, after losing the Battle of Toro, France refused to help Joanna further and in 1478 signed a peace treaty with Isabella.\n\nInfante Fernando of Aragon became jure uxoris (by right of wife) King of Castile when Isabella succeeded her deceased brother in 1474. When Infante Fernando succeeded his father as King Fernando II of Aragon in 1479, the Crown of Castile and the various territories of the Crown of Aragon were united in a personal union. The Crown of Aragon that King Fernando II of Aragon inherited in 1479 included the kingdoms of Aragon, Valencia, Majorca, Sardinia, and Sicily, as well as the Principality of Catalonia.\n\nThe various states were not formally administered as a single unit, the Kingdom of Spain, but as separate political units under the same monarchs. (The legal merging of Aragon and Castile into a single Spain occurred under King Felipe V in 1707–1715).\n\nKing Enrique IV of Castile made a number of attempts throughout his reign to arrange a politically advantageous marriage for his much younger sister, Infanta Isabella of Castile. The first attempt was when the six-year-old Infanta Isabella was betrothed to Infante Fernando of Aragon, son of King Juan II of Aragon and Queen Blanche of Navarre. This arrangement, however, did not last long.\n\nIn 1465, an attempt was made to marry Isabella to King Afonso V of Portugal, King Enrique IV’s brother-in-law. Through the medium of the Queen and Count of Ledesma, a Portuguese alliance was made. Infanta Isabella, however, was wary of the marriage and refused to consent.\n\nAfter a few more attempts at politically aligned marriages which Infanta Isabella refused, she secretly agreed to marry her first betrothed, Infante Fernando of Aragon.\n\nOn October 18, 1469, the formal betrothal between Infanta Isabella of Castile and Infante Fernando of Aragon took place. Because Infanta Isabella and Infante Fernando were second cousins, they stood within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity and the marriage would not be legal unless a dispensation from the Pope was obtained.\n\nWith the help of the Valencian Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia (later Pope Alexander VI), Infanta Isabella and Infante Fernando were presented with a supposed papal bull by Pope Pius II (who had actually died in 1464), authorizing Infante Fernando to marry within the third degree of consanguinity, making their marriage legal.\n\nAt the time King Enrique IV’s heir was Infanta Isabella’s full brother, Infante Alfonso of Castile.\n\nIn early 1460s, Castilian nobles became dissatisfied with the rule of King Enrique IV and believed that Queen Joan’s child (Infanta Joanna, Princess of Asturias) had not been sired by Enrique IV.\n\nPropaganda and rumour, encouraged by the league of rebellious nobles, argued that her father was Beltrán de la Cueva, a royal favorite of low background whom Enrique had elevated to enormous power and who, as suggested by Alfonso de Palencia and others, may have been Joan’s lover.\n\nThis resulted in the name “Juana la Beltraneja”, which has stuck with the girl throughout history. If Joanna was illegitimate, the next in line was Infante Alfonso. If she was legitimate, then Alfonso and, ultimately, his famous sister Isabella were both usurpers. Considering Isabella’s impact on world history, this question has fascinated historians for centuries.\n\nThe Spanish Succession\n\nKing Fernando II of Aragon was the son of King Juan II of Aragon (whose family was a cadet branch of the House of Trastámara) by his second wife, Juana Enríquez, a daughter of Fadrique Enríquez and Mariana Fernández de Córdoba, 4th Lady of Casarrubios del Monte. Born in Torrelobatón, Juana Enríquez was a great-great-granddaughter of King Alfonso XI of Castile.\n\nThe marriage between Juana Enriquez and King Juan II of Aragon was arranged because King Juan II wished to ally himself with the powerful noble faction she belonged to, a faction which had major power in Castile at the time. They were engaged in 1443, but the marriage was delayed. The wedding finally took place in 1447.\n\nKing Fernando II of Aragon’s future wife, Infanta Isabella of Castile, was the daughter of King Juan II of Castile and his second wife, Infanta Isabella of Portugal, who was born as a scion of a collateral branch of the Aviz Dynasty that had ruled Portugal since 1385.\n\nInfanta Isabella of Portugal’s parents were Infante João, Constable of Portugal, the youngest surviving son of King João I of Portugal and his wife Philippa of Lancaster, the eldest child of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, and Blanche of Lancaster.\n\nInfanta Isabella of Portugal was married to King Juan II of Castile as his second wife. His first wife, Infanta Maria of Aragon, had given him four children, though only one, the future King Enrique IV of Castile, had survived into adulthood. Infanta Maria of Aragon was the daughter of King Fernando I of Aragon and Eleanor of Alburquerque.\n\nIncidentally, to complicate this already complicated genealogy, Infanta Constance of Castile (1354 – 1394) was a claimant to the Crown of Castile. She was the daughter of King Pedro I of Castile and María de Padilla, who was deposed and killed by his half-brother, King Enrique II of Castile. Constance of Castile married the English prince, John of Gaunt, as his second wife, who fought to obtain the throne of Castile in her name, but ultimately failed.\n\nInfanta Constance of Castile and her husband, John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, had a daughter, Catherine of Lancaster (1373 – 1418) she became Queen of Castile by marriage to King Enrique III of Castile, the first-born child of the recently crowned King Juan I of Castile and his wife Infanta Eleanor of Aragon, the only daughter of King Pedro IV of Aragon and his wife Eleanor of Sicily. King Juan I’s younger brother grew up to become King Fernando I of Aragon.\n\nArthur, Prince of Wales (September 19/20, 1486 – April 2, 1502), was the eldest son of King Henry VII of England and Elizabeth of York, and an older brother to the future King Henry VIII.\n\nHe was Duke of Cornwall from birth, and he was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester in 1489. As the heir apparent of his father, Arthur was viewed by contemporaries as the great hope of the newly established House of Tudor.\n\nHis mother, Elizabeth of York, was the daughter of the Yorkist king, Edward IV, and his birth cemented the union between the House of Lancaster and the House of York.\n\nHenry VII became King of England and Lord of Ireland upon defeating Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. In an effort to strengthen the Tudor claim to the throne, Henry decided on naming his firstborn son “Arthur” and having him born in Winchester – where the Legend of King Arthur originated – in order to emphasise the Welsh origin of the Tudors.\n\nOn this occasion, Camelot was identified as present-day Winchester, and his wife, Elizabeth of York, was sent to Saint Swithun’s Priory (today Winchester Cathedral Priory) in order to give birth there. Born at Saint Swithun’s Priory on the night of 19/20 September 1486 at about 1 am, Arthur was Henry and Elizabeth’s eldest child.\n\nYoung Arthur was viewed as “a living symbol” of not only the union between the House of Lancaster and the House of York, to which his mother belonged as the daughter of Edward IV, but also of the end of the Wars of the Roses. In the opinion of contemporaries, Arthur was the great hope of the newly established House of Tudor.\n\nHenry VII planned to marry Arthur to a daughter of the Catholic Monarchs, Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Fernando II of Aragon, in order to forge an Anglo-Spanish alliance against France.\n\nIt was suggested that the choice of marrying Arthur to Fernando and Isabella’s youngest daughter, Catherine (b. 1485), would be appropriate.\n\nThanks to negotiations by the Spanish ambassador Rodrigo González de la Puebla, the Treaty of Medina del Campo (March 27, 1489) provided that Arthur and Catherine would be married as soon as they reached canonical age; it also settled Catherine’s dowry at 200,000 crowns (the equivalent of £5 million in 2007).\n\nSince Arthur, not yet 14, was below the age of consent, a papal dispensation (i.e., waiver) allowing the marriage was issued in February 1497, and the pair were betrothed by proxy on August 25, 1497. Two years later, a marriage by proxy took place at Arthur’s Tickenhill Manor in Bewdley, near Worcester.\n\nThe young couple exchanged letters in Latin until September 20 , 1501, when Arthur, having attained the age of 15, was deemed old enough to be married. Catherine landed in England about two weeks later, on October 2, 1501, at Plymouth.\n\nThe next month, on November 4, 1501, the couple met for the first time at Dogmersfield in Hampshire. Arthur wrote to Catherine’s parents that he would be “a true and loving husband”; the couple soon discovered that they had mastered different pronunciations of Latin and so were unable to easily communicate. Five days later, on November 9, 1501, Catherine arrived in London.\n\nOn November 14, 1501, the marriage ceremony finally took place at Saint Paul’s Cathedral; both Arthur and Catherine wore white satin. The ceremony was conducted by Henry Deane, Archbishop of Canterbury, who was assisted by William Warham, Bishop of London.\n\nFollowing the ceremony, Arthur and Catherine left the Cathedral and headed for Baynard’s Castle, where they were entertained by “the best voiced children of the King’s chapel, who sang right sweetly with quaint harmony”.\n\nWhat followed was a bedding ceremony laid down by Arthur’s grandmother Lady Margaret Beaufort: the bed was sprinkled with holy water, after which Catherine was led away from the wedding feast by her ladies-in-waiting.\n\nShe was undressed, veiled and “reverently” laid in bed, while Arthur, “in his shirt, with a gown cast about him,” was escorted by his gentlemen into the bedchamber as viols and tabors played.\n\nThe Bishop of London blessed the bed, and prayed for the marriage to be fruitful, after which the couple were left alone. This is the only public bedding of a royal couple recorded in Britain in the 16th century.\n\nDeath\n\nAfter residing at Tickenhill Manor for a month, Arthur and Catherine headed for the Welsh Marches, where they established their household at Ludlow Castle. Arthur had been growing weaker since his wedding, and Henry VII thus seemed reluctant to allow Catherine to follow him, until ultimately ordering her to join her husband.\n\nArthur found it easy to govern Wales, as the border had become quiet after many centuries of warfare. In March 1502, Arthur and Catherine were afflicted by an unknown illness, “a malign vapour which proceeded from the air.”\n\nIt has been suggested that this illness was the mysterious English sweating sickness, tuberculosis (“consumption”), plague or influenza. While Catherine recovered, Arthur died on April 2, 1502 at Ludlow, six months short of his sixteenth birthday.\n\nNews of Arthur’s death reached Henry VII’s court late on April 4th. The King was awoken from his sleep by his confessor, who quoted Job by asking Henry “If we receive good things at the hands of God, why may we not endure evil things?”\n\nHe then told the king that “[his] dearest son hath departed to God,” and Henry burst into tears. “Grief-stricken and emotional,” he then had his wife brought into his chambers, so that they might “take the painful news together”.\n\nElizabeth reminded Henry that God had helped him become king and “had ever preserved him,” adding that they had been left with “yet a fair Prince and two fair princesses and that God is where he was, and [they were] both young enough.” Soon after leaving Henry’s bedchamber, Elizabeth collapsed and began to cry, while the ladies sent for the King, who hurriedly came and “relieved her.”\n\nOn April 8, a general procession took place for the salvation of Arthur’s soul. That night, a dirge was sung in St Paul’s Cathedral and every parish church in London. On April 23rd Arthur’s body, which had previously been embalmed, sprinkled with holy water and sheltered with a canopy, was carried out of Ludlow Castle and into the Parish Church of Ludlow by various noblemen and gentlemen.\n\nOn April 25, Arthur’s body was taken to Worcester Cathedral via the River Severn, in a “special wagon upholstered in black and drawn by six horses, also caparisoned in black.” As was customary, Catherine did not attend the funeral. The Earl of Surrey acted as chief mourner.\n\nAt the end of the ceremony, Sir William Uvedale, Sir Richard Croft and Arthur’s household ushers broke their staves of office and threw them into the Prince’s grave. During the funeral, Arthur’s own arms were shown alongside those of Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd and Brutus of Troy. Two years later, a chantry was erected over Arthur’s grave.\n\nDuring their brief marriage Catherine later firmly stated that the marriage had not been consummated.\n\nOne year after Arthur’s death, Henry VII renewed his efforts to seal a marital alliance with Spain by arranging for Catherine to marry Arthur’s younger brother Henry, who would ascend to the throne in 1509 as King Henry VIII.\n\nThe question over whether Arthur and Catherine had consummated their marriage was much later, and in a completely different political context, exploited by Henry VIII and his court.\n\nThis strategy was employed in order to cast doubt upon the validity of Catherine’s union with Henry VIII, eventually leading to the separation between the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nArthur Tudor (September 19/20 1486 – April 2, 1502) was Prince of Wales, Earl of Chester and Duke of Cornwall. As the eldest son and heir apparent of Henry VII of England, Arthur was viewed by contemporaries as the great hope of the newly established House of Tudor. His mother, Elizabeth of York, was the daughter of Edward IV, and his birth cemented the union between the House of Tudor and the House of York.\n\nHenry VII became King of England upon defeating Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. In an effort to strengthen the Tudor claim to the throne, Henry had royal genealogists trace his lineage back to the ancient British rulers and decided on naming his firstborn son after the legendary King Arthur.\n\nOn this occasion, Camelot was identified as present-day Winchester, and his wife, Elizabeth of York, was sent to Saint Swithun’s Priory (today Winchester Cathedral Priory) in order to give birth there. Born at Saint Swithun’s Priory on the night of 19/20 September 1486 at about 1 am, Arthur was Henry and Elizabeth’s eldest child. Arthur’s birth was anticipated by French and Italian humanists eager for the start of a “Virgilian golden age”. Sir Francis Bacon wrote that although the Prince was born one month premature, he was “strong and able”.\n\nYoung Prince Arthur was viewed as “a living symbol” of not only the union between the House of Tudor and the House of York, to which his mother belonged as the daughter of Edward IV, but also of the end of the Wars of the Roses. In the opinion of contemporaries, Arthur was the great hope of the newly established House of Tudor.\n\nArthur became Duke of Cornwall at birth. Four days after his birth, he was baptised at Winchester Cathedral by the Bishop of Worcester, John Alcock, which was immediately followed by his confirmation. John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby, William FitzAlan, 16th Earl of Arundel, Queen Elizabeth Woodville and Cecily of York served as godparents; the latter two, his grandmother and aunt, respectively, carried the prince during the ceremony.\n\nInitially, Arthur’s nursery in Farnham was headed by Elizabeth Darcy, who had served as chief nurse for Edward IV’s children, including Arthur’s own mother. After Arthur was created Prince of Wales in 1490, he was awarded a household structure at the behest of his father. Over the next thirteen years, Henry VII and Elizabeth would have six more children, of whom only three—Margaret, Henry and Mary—would reach adulthood. Arthur was especially close to his sister Margaret (b. 1489) and his brother Henry (b. 1491), with whom he shared a nursery.\n\nThe popular belief that Arthur was sickly during his lifetime stems from a misunderstanding of a 1502 letter, but there are no reports of Arthur being ill during his lifetime. Arthur grew up to be unusually tall for his age, and was considered handsome by the Spanish court: he had reddish hair, small eyes, a high-bridged nose, resembling his brother Henry, who was said to be “extremely handsome” by contemporaries. As described by historians Steven Gunn and Linda Monckton, Arthur had an “amiable and gentle” personality and was, overall, a “delicate lad”\n\nPlans for Arthur’s marriage began before his third birthday; he was installed as Prince of Wales two years later. At the age of eleven, he was formally betrothed to Catherine of Aragon, a daughter of the powerful Catholic Monarchs in Spain, Fernando II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, in an effort to forge an Anglo-Spanish alliance against France.\n\nArthur was well educated and, contrary to some modern belief, was in good health for the majority of his life. Soon after his marriage to Catherine in 1501, the couple took up residence at Ludlow Castle in Shropshire, where Arthur died six months later of an unknown ailment. Catherine later firmly stated that the marriage had not been consummated.\n\nOne year after Arthur’s death, Henry VII renewed his efforts of sealing a marital alliance with Spain by arranging for Catherine to marry Arthur’s younger brother Henry, Prince of Wales. Arthur’s untimely death paved the way for Henry to ascend to the throne in 1509 as King Henry VIII.\n\nWhether Arthur and Catherine consummated their six-month marriage was much later (and in a completely different political context) exploited by Henry VIII and his court. This strategy was employed in order to cast doubt upon the validity of Catherine’s union with Henry VIII, eventually leading to the separation between the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church."
