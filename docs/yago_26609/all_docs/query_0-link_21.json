        "text": "Queen Isabella I of Castile is the warrior queen that united Spain with her marriage to Ferdinand of Aragon and drove the Moors and the \"heretics\" out of Spain for good. Most of her reign was spent on military campaigns whereby Isabella was an active participant and incorporated her role as wife and mother into her role as military leader. Her unwavering devotion to her faith saw the spread of catholicism and her patronage of explorer Christopher Columbus's voyage and subsequent gold mining in the New World saw Spain became one of the first global superpowers and became a powerful player in European politics for the next century.\n\nIsabella was hero worshipped by her daughter Catalina and was an incredible influential on how Catalina would think and later act in the novel The Constant Princess. Isabella was also responsible for the death of Teddy Plantagenet and Perkin Warback as one the conditions of Catalina and Arthur's marriage was there would be no rivals to threaten Catalina's union with arthur or her claim to the English throne.\n\nThe Constant Princess[]\n\nIsabella is presented as the serenely calm and wise warrior queen that united Spain through her marriage and who her husband relies on as an equal and a counselor. Catalina is awestruck and completely swayed by her mother's opinions and actions and hopes to follow her mother's example.\n\nThe novel begins in 1491 Grenada as the Moors raid the military camp of Queen Isabella of Castile. The young infanta Catalina watches with adoration as her warrior mother gathers her army and puts out the flames caused by the night raid. Upon her mother’s return, Catalina assures her mother that she was not afraid as she is a Spanish Princess and Princess of Wales. Catalina’s parentage and titles are incredibly important to her, even as a young child, as she prepares for her destiny as Queen of England. The morning after the raid, the Spanish generals suggest retreating due to lack of supplies but Isabella pushes the army onwards to vanquish the Moors from their last foothold in Spain. Isabella resolves their lack of shelter by commanding they build a stone fortification using the natural resources of the barren countryside. Her king, Ferdinand of Aragon acquiesces and begins work on stone structure beneath the cliff were the Moors have held the Red Fort for two centuries. Isabella and Ferdinand keep building in the unrelenting heat and against all odds until they found the siege town of Sante Fe."
