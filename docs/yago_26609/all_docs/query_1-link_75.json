        "text": "Nathan Harris\n\nDr. Palmer\n\nHistory 3323\n\n4 May, 2017\n\nQueen Isabella I of Castile was not the first female ruler nor is she one of the most recognizable rules taught in the standard history classroom. During her time period, women took political power with criticism and had to prove themselves so much more than their male counterparts. Even in an area such as the Iberian peninsula where it is more acceptable to name a female heir women were viewed as weak, less intelligent, and unable to perform great tasks, none of which describe Isabella as she showed qualities of a true leader long before she took the throne. In her rise to power, she knew when to put on a well-behaved face and play politics but she also knew when to pick up her sword and show the warrior inside of her by taking charge and leading her people over their oppressors of the last 700 years. Without her significant contributions to the Spanish Empire it easy to see how not only modern Spain but how modern Europe as a whole would be changed with the loss of a great leader. She was able to make an effect that has lasted for over hundreds of years by being courageous, accepting what was expected of her as a woman, but also choosing her own path. Queen Isabella’s rule is an example of how someone in a confined role can break the mold and do more by doing the most she can from the role given to her.\n\nThroughout her rise to the thrown Queen Isabella, I of Castile faced many obstacles that would limit most king and queens but she used the obstacles to learn and establish power over her territory once she took control. She had a plan to be exceptional and be a marginal Queen people could look up to but she had to act average to achieve those goals. She had to work with her roles as a woman to be a great woman of the time by doing what was expected of her but doing it better and outthinking others to giver her what she wants after she wins them over by staying within her role. When she was born Isabella was third in line to take her father’s throne. After her first brother took control of Castile Isabella has given another brother which knocked her down to forth in line to the thrown. Even with the high death rate at the time, many families did not see three children consecutively and when the third heir came to the thrown they were usually too old or sick to lead effectively for many years. Despite growing up in a royal family Isabella and her family did not have much money because her older brother Henry IV withheld all the money their father left them and Castile was facing many economic problems making it hard to survive for many people of the area. Isabella, her mom, and her younger brother Alfonso moved to Arévalo in search for economic relief.\n\nIsabella, I did not always play by the rules she was upheld to she did what she thought was the best action for each situation. In the fifteenth century, Queens and women had a set of written and unspoken rules on the way they were meant to act in society by the way they conducted themselves, mannerisms, and dress. She had no problem coming off as disrespectful or unladylike if it meant submitting to males for the sake of tradition. Isabella was sent to Segovia to live in the Queen’s household where conditions improved but were still not ideal. Once she took over the crown she began to undo some of the problems caused by her brother which focused on his spending and lack of attention to crime. Henry had no ways to enforce the laws and Isabella I sought opportunity in his loss. Isabella used a group of men called the Hermandad to police Castile becoming the first ruler to very privatize the police system in the area. This led to people paying taxes to support the group and as more common citizens joined the force the that resembled the police force we still see in today’s forces. The much bigger issue at hand left by Henry IV was the economy, many were starving and resorted to a life of crime to survive. Isabella put to officials in charge of getting rid of the area’s theft problem. These men would end up removing 1,500 robbers. After Isabella reviewed the finances it appeared her brother tried to make some quick cash by selling royal estates for a price far below its value. Isabella’s advisors thought the best course of action would be to resale and revalue the properties. Isabella did not want to use a plan that drastically so instead she got the church involved. Women were not generally seen as ones to clean up crime or resolve economic issues, but Isabella and her advisors were able to prove to the people she could do more than what was expected of her. The Cardinal of Spain granted some properties as rewards and those not given a reward were restored at no cost any property sold below value was resold for the low price back to Queen Isabella I. Spain also suffered from an inflation problem as there were too many mints making to many coins driving down the value. Isabella monopolized the mints and established a standard for the value and quality of Spanish coins in her first year in power. By taking control over the economy people began to trust the economy and value of their currency under the reign of Queen Isabella I.\n\nDuring her time as Queen, she focused on taking power away from the nobles and unifying Spain for the betterment of the country. In her last decade as ruler managed to take over the territories of Alcántara, Calatrava, and Santiago by military order. These territories were used strictly as economic gains for the noblemen that ruled them but Queen Isabella I saw the strength in unification. Isabella and Ferdinand had the support of Spanish parliament that continually gave them support over the noblemen in order for the King and Queen to unify the large territories. Through this partnership with a generous parliament, the couple was able to rearrange the courts and justices to comply with their visions for the new unified Spain. Back in Castile Queen Isabella I was able to relieve the territory of the colossal debt left for her by her brother while also lowering the crime rate for a more peaceful and organized land. When the couple captured Granada they controlled the vast majority of the Spanish territory and were able to assert themselves as the most powerful leaders in Spain. It was only after the takeover of Granada that the Spanish people were able to see their country start to form under a new regime. After Alfonso died before he could take the throne Isabella was named Champion of the rebellion against her brother. Instead of continuing with war the two came to a compromise. Henry would name his sister his successor to the thrown. In this agreement, Isabella had to get consent from Henry to marry but Henry was not allowed to tell Isabella who she had to marry. Her gender limited her in this regard as even though she married the man she chooses instead of the man her brother arranged for her she still had to get approval from a male family member instead of just picking who she wanted from the start. “The marriage negotiations between Isabella and Ferdinand had to be conducted clandestinely, through secret messages… but she still had committed herself not to marry without his permission.”(Downey, 74) She made the right political choice as Ferdinand already had a large sector of Spain to inherit and sadly the Spanish parliament was only so generous because the two stood as a couple. If it was just Isabella she would have had more of a fight with parliament as they needed a king to sign off on many of the agreements made between the young king and parliament.\n\nWomen had very little say in who they married in the fifteenth century. That is especially true for women of royalty in order to boost relationships between families and territories. At the early age of six Isabella, I of Castile was almost used as a marriage chip in order to create better political relations for her brother the king. Not an uncommon practice of the time by any stretch of the imagination but plans fell through and she would not marry until the age of seventeen. Henry tried to marry off his sister in 1465 to King Alfonso V of Portugal, his own brother in law. Isabella did not think the marriage could work so she never gave her brother consent to marry her off to Alfonso so the arrangement fell through yet again. Henry IV needed an ally to move forward and at the time his best chance was with King John II of Aragon. The deal fell through but King Henry found a new deal with John II’s son Charles. Charles would partner with Henry for Isabell’a hand in marriage. Once King John II heard the news he was caught off guard because he wanted his youngest son Ferdinand to marry Isabella. He also heard that Charles wanted to take the kingdom away from his own father. Charles was thrown into prison by his father where he would die a few years later. This allowed for a partnership between the kings of Castile and Aragon when Isabella married King John II’s favorite son Ferdinand who was eighteen at the time. This marriage would become a key part of Isabella’s reign because any aristocratic women in this age needed a husband to be looked at respected and to keep rumors of sexually losing one’s morality away. This value is one that followed deep into the marriage as some people questioned who were the real parents of her children. “She took extreme measures to ensure no one would ever question the paternity of her children.”(Downey, 105) She even had a room of women to be ready to dance with any man that ask for her hand. Women with husbands are taken more seriously and single women who ruled are always questions and when they make a poor choice people always say she should lead with a man or a man should take her place. In a marriage two rulers have each other to fall back on, at least in the eyes of the public. The joint rule was unusual but accepted by the people Spain and people were ready to embrace it as they saw the powerful couple but behind closed doors thy rarely worked together just using each other to get what they want. It may have been called a joint rule but Isabella knew she was in control and Ferdinand would stay out of the way.\n\nIn a time where men were the dominant rulers in Europe and women were seen as figureheads, Isabella was able to rise above her marriage, keep control of her territory and rule as an equal to her husband. “I never heard of a queen who usurped this male privilege” Said Fedininand(Downey, 135)She was able to do this staying in the role of marriage everyone expected her to be in with a husband and a family with high morals but she was able to maneuver herself with these roles in order to gain more power and respect and people saw she was no ordinary queen. Within the first few years of marriage to no surprise, Isabella discovered Ferdinand was not faithful to her on multiple occasions. She did not let this destroy her she stayed strong and stayed with him because she knew the times dictated that she would need a male counterpart to open some doors so she could complete her agenda. This would have limited most women but she played the game her gender gave her and used her husband as key rather than a husband. After the subject was brought to light he spent much more time away from her and focused on the territory he commanded before the marriage this allowed Isabella to work and lead while he was away with other duties or other women. When people came looking Ferdinand they would find Isabella and once she got the conversation started she knows she could win them over and that they would listen to her advice and rule. Not that Ferdinand had much where else to hide before they were married he signed a prenup that forbade him from taking control of Isabella’s territory. Usually, when an heir so far down the line as Isabella takes over there is little to no expectations for them to make a name for themselves. Yet her family would never fail to see greatness in her as this prenup set Ferdinand up as nothing more than a figurehead of the land the powerful couple would take over. Instead of looking at her marriage as an excuse, Queen Isabella used the opportunity to focus on her kingdom as one ruler but with the resources of two. Many viewed this marriage as a way to connect two kingdoms which it did but the common people assumed Ferdinand would rule both. People of Spain were not excited about the idea of a woman ruler having this much power, at first. After the quick turnaround in Castile and other regions, Isabella commanded people were impressed about what the young queen had been doing for their local land and Spain in general. Between commanding her army to expand her kingdom or working with common people and other Spanish leaders to create laws that will help unify the country. After a while, people began to ask when Ferdinand would start to command like his wife. For appearance’s sake Ferdinand was a portrayed as the strong competent leader but the word around town has that Isabella is the real ruler while Ferdinand becomes a diplomatic figurehead with connections. This is a very rare glimpse of what it looks like when the female ruler comes off more dominant than the male leader. Many people of what would become a unified Spain were skeptical of how a married woman would rule and how effective she would be. Many people of the area were more accustomed to a women ruler than other parts of the countries but had very little experience under such leadership and no one had experienced a women leader as powerful as Isabella.\n\nA good skill of any leader is the ability to adapt, while Isabella was a strong and decisive leader she also knew how to work in various situations. No only was she able to work with her husband while also bringing fame to her own name but she was able to work with the people. Ferdinand and Isabella were looking for a way to connect with the people and understand their thought process so they would set aside time every Friday to listen to complaints and comments. She knew when to work with her husband in order to show an appearance or use connections to grow her reign and she knew when she had to rely on herself to make sure it was done correctly and her name was protected. It was Ferdinand in the first place that gave people the confidence of giving King Henry’s power to his sister because the people were more will to have two leaders rather than one woman leader who is unguided by man. She also needed him to get into the military game as people did not see her as a leader but with the two leaders, she gained a little trust at a time until she was the face of the army who took her family as she went from battlefield to battlefield to command her men. She became so vital to the army her officers had her give them orders as she was giving birth. Her decisions were very calculated and look for the larger picture, this time period did not like change so sometimes she would play the game of society in order to get into the door but take over once she was in.\n\nOver the next several centuries Spain will be in a race to become the world’s most successful empire, Queen Isabella I of Castile is the ruler who started it all. Without driving the Islamic people out of Granada there is little to no chance of Spanish unity. Her Grandson Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor will always be credited with the official unification of Spain. In reality, his grandmother created the foundation and lit the spark while he dotted the is and crossed the ts. If the country never unified Spain would be subject to more invasions and would eventually fall to a country looking to expand it’s brand. Without any intention of doing so, Isabella starts the race to colonization by financing Christopher Colombus’ journey to search for the Northwest passage. Instead, she finds herself with a new world of possibilities in which she can capitalize on the untapped potential that will help the economy and bring fame to the legacy she built with Spain. Without her investment and political guidance there is no telling how the world would look today if the eastern world never sailed west. The world would be a much lesser place if Isabella did what was expected of her as a woman and did not take on a new unconventional adventure to explore an unknown land. Spain gained so much through discovery and natural resources it is the gift that kept giving for hundreds of years and rivaled Great Britain who became one of the world’s greatest empires thanks to this discovery and the leadership of Isabella’s very own descendants Queen Mary of Scots who ruled with much more of an iron fist but still effective like Isabella.\n\nQueen Isabella I of Castile was devoutly Catholic a quality she did not take lightly as she stuck to her values, she admits she caused great destruction for the people she removed from her land but felt it was the right thing to do for her religion so she felt no remorse for it. She would enforce her religion on the people she ruled and upheld her religion by taking extreme measures, even killing others to protect the purity of her religion in her homeland. Many of her people called her Isabella the Catholic because of her outstanding commitment to faith. This plays into the common belief that women are driven by their morals and are suppose to be the moral lighthouses to their families or in this case her kingdom. She is able to use this common belief to her advantage as the people like to see her stand up for her religious values as a woman and as the number of Catholics grows and other religions are forced to leave the people she serves become more likely to support a Catholic queen. Her catholic upbringing can be most closely associated with her mother. Both parents raised her catholic but it was the time Isabella and her mother left Castile that her beliefs began to straighten. She would hold her religion close to her in good time and in bad. Isabella and Ferdinand were credited with completing the Reconquista, which ended a 770 year old battle for Spain as her army was finally able to defeat the Moors and take the Ottoman Empire out Spain. “Ferdinand moved quickly to make sure he was given full credit for the achievement.”(Downey 204) They took control of the Islamic people that invaded all those years ago. She did not stop there though, she also set to complete the Spanish Inquisition. At the time Spain was dominated by Catholics but still had a large Islamic and Jewish community. Queen Isabella I would not allow for this so to implement the inquisition she order for all non-Catholics to be converted removed or exiled. This violated the Treaty of Granada signed after she claimed it but eventually the treaty fell apart and Isabella stayed in power. Even after Jewish converted she remain skeptical and would sometimes kill them anyway if she believes they did not fully convert. Years later she would also demand that the native Americans also be converted or dealt with harshly. Isabella was stubborn when it came to her beliefs she would not sacrifice her beliefs for a better reign but she would sacrifice her rule to protect her faith. Many say this devotion to religion would limit a leader but I say not Isabella. She used her religion to keep her grounded and it connected her to the people she ruled. This allowed her to play the typical gender role of moral women and sneak into the hearts of her people which led to an easier reign.\n\nQueen Isabella I of Castile was not the first queen nor was she the first great queen but she was a pioneer in her own right. She became an exceptional women for her time not only because of the great accomplishments she achieved over her time as queen but in the way she achieved them. She achieved all these great things by being herself, staying true to her beliefs, and viewing herself as a leader and not just a woman that is supposed to fit into other peoples’ view of what she should be. She taught a lesson that still holds truth today by the way she handled herself and through her courageous acts. She was not defined by her marriage, the advisors around her, tradition, or standard view of how women were supposed to act she just lived and did what she taught was best based on her own agency. She left a legacy by staying true to herself, she should be looked up to not by her accomplishments but by the way was different. When what is expected of a group of people is different from what they are capable of those oppressed people must be different by being themselves.\n\nAnnotated Bibliography\n\n*”Columbus’ Letter to the King and Queen of Spain.” Christopher Columbus to Queen Isabella of Castile and King Ferdinand. 1494.\n\nFernández-Armesto, Felipe.
