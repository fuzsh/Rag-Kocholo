        "text": "The summer after her first year at GW – entirely online – Deseree Chacha spent three weeks in Tanzania, to visit her grandmother and other family members. “I am a first-generation Tanzanian-American, and I think of Tanzania as home,” she says. “I definitely have taken an international journey to the Elliott School.”\n\nChacha began her studies thinking she would major in psychology, yet even in the first year she found herself drawn to classes that focused on African history, culture, and politics. This interest crystalized as she traveled across Tanzania, from Dar es Salaam to Arusha to Zanzibar. By the time she returned to GW for sophomore year, she knew she would change course and study international affairs at the Elliott School.\n\n“I am the type of person who wants to take an academic route to learn more about my identity,” Chacha says. “The trip was the moment when I realized I could actually pursue this.”\n\nAs the oldest of three children, Chacha was sensitive to the financial burden her parents took on when she started her undergraduate studies. In November 2022, part of this burden was lifted when Chacha received a scholarship through the Elliott Equity Fund, established in spring 2022 to encourage students from all walks of life to pursue their dreams.\n\n“I was so elated to tell my parents I got this award. I knew this would relieve some of the pressure on my parents and even my siblings,” she says. And there is another dimension, as well. “This award shows that the Elliott School recognizes the need to take specific action in regards to equity.”\n\nThe field of international affairs benefits greatly from diversity among its ranks, says Rebecca\n\nBrown Thompson, MA ’91. Thompson, a member of the school’s Board of Advisors, went from\n\nthe Elliott School to a distinguished 28-year career as a Foreign Service Officer with the US State\n\nDepartment. Over the years, she continually sought to develop inclusive teams.\n\n“The more diversity we can bring to the table during policy deliberations, the more we can be\n\nconfident we’re developing foreign policy that is well thought out,” she said, and added, “When\n\nwe have diverse teams representing the United States overseas, it reflects the values of our\n\ncountry.”\n\nFor Thompson, the Elliott Equity Awards are one way to remove barriers to equity and inclusion\n\nand ensure that the “best and brightest students out there, no matter what their backgrounds,\n\nchoose the Elliott School.”\n\nThe view from inside the classroom mirrors Thompson’s experience in the field. “To resolve the most pressing challenges facing our interconnected world, we need to tap into the full measure of talent available, bringing to the debate the widest possible range of perspectives and ways of thinking,” says Elliott School Professor Jennifer Brinkerhoff.\n\nWith more than 40 percent of GW students qualifying for need-based aid, the Elliott Equity Fund Awards are a powerful game changer – for Deseree Chacha, her fellow awardees, and future award winners.\n\nOr, as Chacha puts it, “the advancement of diversity in international relations will greatly assist key advisors and global leaders to foster peace and unity.”\n\nVisit the Elliott Equity Fund webpage to learn more and donate today.\n\nJosué Rivera Rivera, an MIPP student at the Elliott School of International Affairs, has been accepted into the prestigious Cambridge International Security and Intelligence (ISI) program.\n\nSupervised by leading international security experts, the program’s purpose is to partner students with leading international security scholars while exploring enduring and emerging themes in international security. The ISI program is put on by the Cambridge Security Initiative in partnership with the Department of War Studies, King’s College, University of London. Josué is the first GW student to be accepted into the program.\n\nThe program is chaired by Sir Richard Dearlove, former Chief of the British Secret Intelligence Service and aims to provide students with an opportunity to work with leading international security scholars and practitioners, exploring both enduring and emerging themes in international security.\n\nThemes explored in the program include the challenges facing Western democracies from state and non-state actors, modern conceptions of transparency and state secrecy, and the role of intelligence and security agencies in a modern democratic society.\n\nThe program is modeled on the teaching offered at Cambridge University and includes small-group supervision of individual research projects by experts in the relevant fields. In addition, participants also attend the annual CSi conference exploring Intelligence and National Security in a Changing World.\n\nJosué credits his acceptance into the program to the resources available at the Elliott School, saying, “it’s proof of the amazing opportunities available here at the Elliott School and at GW. It starts with the amazing faculty. We have very talented professors and advisors.”\n\nWhen asked to reflect about his experience at the Elliott School, Josué shared his immense appreciation for the faculty, students, and access to global opportunities.\n\n“At Elliott, there are incredibly talented people who have a true sense of wanting to do good in the world and create change. That is inspiring.”\n\nHe advises students to “take advantage of the opportunities you already have here. Understand what you’re curious about and look for different perspectives.”\n\nThe Elliott School provides students with unique opportunities for global engagement both in Washington D.C. and abroad. The Office of Graduate Student Services offers resources to students through over 65 networking, informational, and skills-building events.\n\nTwo Elliott School graduate students recently traveled to Japan on a cultural exchange funded by the Japanese Foreign Ministry. The Kakehashi Project is a grassroots exchange program aimed at promoting greater understanding of Japanese politics, economics, society, culture, history, and foreign policy. In Japanese, the word Kakehashi means bridges—in this case, bridges between cultures.\n\nMimi MacKilligan, MA International Affairs ‘23, and Amanda Earls, MA Asian Studies ’23, traveled from Kanto to Kansai—two regions in central Japan—where they visited Tokyo and Osaka and the ancient capital of Nara.\n\nIn Tokyo, the group met with government officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and heard about Japan’s vision for regional relations known as FOIP (Free and Open Indo-Pacific), then headed to the Sasakawa Peace Foundation for a meeting.\n\nThey joined in the famous “Shibuya Scramble,” the busiest intersection in the world in downtown Tokyo where upwards of 3000 people cross the intersection during each light cycle.\n\nThe Tokyo tour included a trip to the Harajuku district known for its inspiring fashion trends from Cosplay to Gothic Lolita. The trendy shopping street is a people-watching mecca in Tokyo. “Visiting these new and old landmarks of Tokyo enriched my experience by also highlighting the mix of history and modernity that Tokyo is known for,” said Mimi of her time in Tokyo.\n\nRiding the Japanese bullet train, known as the Shinakansen, from Tokyo to Osaka traveling at speeds up to 186 miles per hour was an experience Amanda won’t soon forget: “The 320-mile ride from Tokyo to Osaka took less than two and a half hours, reigniting my hope that someday major cities in the U.S. will also be connected by high-speed rail,” she said.\n\nIn Osaka they spent time with students from Kindai University. They were treated to a sushi lunch including tuna from the university’s renowned Aquaculture Research Institute which has succeeded in farm raising a bluefin tuna, which, unlike salmon, is extremely difficult to do.\n\nAfter a two year hiatus due to Covid, the Kakehashi Program is back to a successful exchange. From Tokyo’s Imperial Palace, to musical and sumo demonstrations, to apple picking with a local family, the group’s trip was full and eventful. As Mimi says, the visit to Japan was “both overwhelming and yet it also exceeded every expectation I had … the whirlwind visit to Japan’s metropolis made a strong impression and impactful introduction to the Kakehashi Program.”\n\nFor more information about applying to Kakehashi, contact Elliott School’s Graduate Student Services office.\n\nIn case you missed it! The Elliott school recently hosted the Spring 2023 Student Org Fair. Students were able to go table to table and discover just what the 20 Elliott student orgs on campus have to offer. In addition to the more familiar orgs, three new student organizations have been recognized and added to the roster! These include the Onero Institute, the John Quincy Adams Society and the GW DC student Consortium on Women Peace and Security.\n\nThe Onero Institute is a youth-driven, nonprofit research organization that wants to develop the next generation of leaders and foreign affairs experts by actively bridging the divide between young people and the academic community and by better engaging youth and the world community on international issues. They offer support and a platform for aspiring young professionals to improve upon and share their work. The Onero Institute places special emphasis on creating intergenerational dialogues and discussing underrepresented and youth issues. This chapter of the Onero Institute seeks to engage the GW and Washington, D.C. communities with the aforementioned mission and strives to empower the voices of students and young people.\n\nThe John Quincy Adams Society (JQAS) is an international affairs-related student organization focused on building a new generation of U.S. leaders who understand the limits of power, will keep America out of unnecessary wars, and refrain from attempts at social engineering in countries halfway across the globe. JQAS at GW aims to help college students advance, both intellectually and professionally, while promoting a broader and more strategic conversation about America’s approach to international affairs.\n\nThe DC Student Consortium on Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) is a student-led organization that aims to—in collaboration with the US Civil Society Working Group on WPS (U.S. CSWG)—promote awareness of the implications of women and gender in security and foreign policy. They strive to ensure that policymakers around the globe are aware of the importance of gender issues in these disciplines and the need to institutionalize a feminist approach when solving critical issues surrounding peace and security.\n\nIt’s never too late to get involved with student organizations at the Elliott School. Check out these three new orgs or any of the other 17 Elliott School student organizations on campus. Getting involved with student organizations is an excellent opportunity to meet like-minded individuals that share a common interest. https://studentlife.gwu.edu/student-organizations\n\nWhen Elliott School of International Affairs senior Carla Dell’Angelica headed to the George\n\nWashington University from her hometown of Los Angeles, she had already decided to focus\n\nher career on advancing women’s rights around the world. In pursuit of this goal, she has taken\n\nclasses on women in Africa, women in Latin America, and on the anthropology of gender.\n\nCarla has held work-study jobs each semester to help fund her education. But this semester,\n\nCarla decided to take a risk. She accepted an unpaid internship with a non-profit that protects\n\nrights and promotes opportunities for women in Latin American nations. “Internships provide\n\nessential career experience, but they can be an added stress for students who, like me, usually\n\nspend the semester working a paid job to help make ends meet,” she explained in her\n\napplication for the award.\n\nOn November 14, Carla breathed a sigh of relief. She is one of 25 Elliott School students to\n\nreceive a new award supporting students dedicated to advancing the role of women in the field\n\nof international affairs. The I/WE Student Award, established by the International Women of\n\nElliott (I/WE) Executive Circle, provides assistance to students with financial need whose career\n\ngoals align with the group’s mission: to expand the role of women in the international affairs\n\nprofession.\n\nTo that end, all gifts to I/WE are dedicated to support graduate fellowships and undergraduate scholarships for Elliott students committed to the advancement of women in international affairs. There are no restrictions on eligibility, and applicants are asked to write about their interest in advancing women’s leadership in international affairs.\n\n“I’m extremely honored to receive this award to support my unpaid internship at the League of\n\nUnited Latin American Citizens,” Carla said. “It will allow me to focus on my studies and\n\ninternship, so that I can be the best candidate for my post-graduation job and future\n\nendeavors.”\n\nThe awards are competitive: more than 90 undergraduate and graduate students applied. The\n\nElliott School was able to offer awards to nearly a third of applicants, for a total of $118,300 in\n\nsupport. Those chosen are students who demonstrate a clear commitment to amplifying the\n\nvoices of women in the foreign policy space, as well as financial need.\n\nThe awards also are a milestone in the work of the I/WE Executive Circle and a landmark\n\nmoment for the Elliott School.\n\n“We are so thrilled to see our growing I/WE community champion the role of women in\n\ninternational affairs,” said Elliott School Dean Alyssa Ayres. “The I/WE Student Awards are\n\ncentral to this goal, with direct impact on the next generation. This is National Scholarship\n\nMonth, and we are delighted to be able to offer assistance to 25 outstanding Elliott School\n\nstudents – all thanks to the support of our I/WE members.”\n\nMembers of the International Women of Elliott Executive Circle, a group of more than two\n\ndozen leaders in international policy and economics, also had a chance to talk with this next\n\ngeneration of women leaders.\n\n“I was truly impressed with the quality of the applicants, and I particularly enjoyed learning\n\nabout the goals they have for their careers – especially the impact they hope to have on\n\nincreasing women’s participation in international affairs policymaking or bettering the\n\nlivelihoods of women all around the world,” noted Alexandra Garcia, MIPP ’14.\n\nTanya Haden, a graduate student concentrating on global communications, is one of 11\n\ngraduate students who received an I/WE fellowship. In her application, Tanya wrote that she\n\njoined an Asian-interest sorority as an undergraduate, “because I strongly believed in their\n\nwork to help women struggling with domestic violence.”\n\nAt the Elliott School, “I am learning how to advance the role of women in global society through\n\nmedia,” Tanya added. She plans to continue this pathway, earning a PhD and becoming a\n\nprofessor. “Media has consistently characterized women in a manner that reinforces archaic\n\ngender roles. I wish to use my position to inform women of how we can shape our global\n\nsociety to enhance gender equality.”\n\nContributions to the I/WE Awards build on GW’s commitment to opening doors to higher\n\neducation and make a world of difference for students to pursue their dreams at the Elliott\n\nSchool.\n\nSina Azodi is a lecturer at the Elliott School specializing in the Middle East. He is a non-resident Fellow at the Atlantic Council, and a PhD candidate in International Affairs. His research interests include international security, nuclear non-proliferation, and US-Iranian relations. Sina previously worked as a Research Assistant at Princeton University’s Program on Science and Global Security and Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Sina earned his BA and MA in International Affairs from the Elliott School of International Affairs at the George Washington University.\n\nYou received both your BA and MA from the Elliott School. Now, you teach here. What’s that like?\n\nWhen I was a student at GW, my dream was to come back to GW and teach here. So, it is really a great pleasure to be able to come back and teach to a great community of talented students.\n\nWere there any Elliott professors who influenced your decision to pursue a career in international affairs?\n\nI had several professors who played an important role in my intellectual foundation, but I am always grateful to Ambassador Skip Gnehm who was not only a fantastic professor but also a great mentor. I am always indebted to his kindness, and generosity. I’m also thankful to Professor Charles Glaser, who set the foundation of International Relations theory for me, in a sense converting me to a Realist!\n\nDo any significant moments stand out during your experience as a student at the Elliott School?\n\nThere are significant moments that stand out for me, but perhaps one that I will never forget is when I received my admission letter from ESIA for my undergraduate degree in 2007. George Washington University was the only school that I had applied to for my undergraduate education because I really wanted to attend GW. In retrospect, perhaps applying to only one school was not the smartest decision, but it was one of the most joyful moments in my life.\n\nYou are currently pursuing a Ph.D. while also teaching undergraduate and graduate courses here at Elliott. What is your area of research and specialization?\n\nMy dissertation focuses on the historical development of Iran’s nuclear program which began in the early days of the Cold War. Specifically, I look at the program from the angle of continuity, and how even after the 1979 revolution in Iran, the program continued because the factors that influence the program did not lose their significance to Iran’s decision makers. Overall, however, my focus is on US-Iranian relations and Iran’s foreign policy\n\nHow would you describe your philosophy of teaching? How was this philosophy influenced by your time as a student at Elliott?\n\nPerhaps the most important lesson I learned during my academic career has been the ability to think critically. I encourage both my undergraduate and graduate students to think critically and “out of the box.” As a student, I came to know and appreciate its impact on producing research. As a professor, I seek to encourage students to think for themselves and demonstrate the willingness and ability to bring new perspectives into the classroom. Another important aspect of teaching philosophy is to encourage students to engage with the lecture and the class. I believe that this is very effective both in producing knowledge and creating a positive experience.\n\nAny advice for Elliott students considering pursuing academia?\n\nMy only advice is to never give up trying and don’t get discouraged because being a student is not easy. There are many issues that a student must deal with, and the only solution is perseverance and determination to achieve one’s goals. I would also say that don’t try to plan too much, because there are many accidents along the path.\n\nAt a special speed-networking event held on October 19 at the Elliott School, 20 forward-\n\nthinking Elliott students had the opportunity to speak one-on-one with high-powered alumni\n\nwho serve on the Elliott School Board of Advisors.\n\nSpeed networking combines the speed-dating model with business networking – allowing for\n\nbrief, targeted conversations with a number of professionals. The Elliott students were asked to\n\nmeet in pairs with board members in five-minute intervals, forging connections with nearly a\n\ndozen executives – who also encouraged the students to stay in touch after the event.\n\nParticipation for students was first come first served; the eight undergraduates and 12 graduate\n\nstudents in the room had been the first to reply to an all-school invitation to the event.\n\nStudents had a range of reasons for participating. Professional development was number one,\n\nunderstandably. “It’s rare that you get a chance to speak with people that accomplished in their\n\nfields,” said one student.\n\nMedha Prasanna, a second-year graduate student, also was eager to gain deeper perspective\n\ninto the Elliott School. “I wanted to meet the people shaping the long-term vision of the\n\nschool,” she said.\n\nAt 11 a.m., students and board members gathered in the State Room on the seventh floor of\n\nthe Elliott School. There was an energetic buzz in the room as the students, in teams of two,\n\ntook seats next to individual board members, then, when the timer went, rotated to the next\n\nmember.\n\nAny anxiety – for students and board members alike – was quickly dispelled, according to Ethan\n\nVosper, a senior concentrating in security policy. “It was a very welcoming, experience. They did\n\na really good job of putting us at ease,” he said.\n\nThomas Nielsen, a graduate student who plans to start his career working in international\n\ntrade, was there to hear first-hand accounts of what an Elliott School degree can lead to,\n\nespecially from those in his field. “I got that,” he said. “A lot of the advice was related to my\n\ninterest in private-sector business. A majority of the members had done exactly that.”\n\nNielsen – a member of the GW Track and XC teams – found the speed-networking format\n\nespecially effective. “It eliminated the small-talk aspect of networking,” he said.\n\nWhat were the key takeaways from the event?\n\nFor senior Ethan Vosper, the “biggest thing [I learned] is not being afraid to put yourself out\n\nthere. When you’re a college student the idea of networking can be daunting, but don’t be\n\nafraid to reach out to a person whose work interests you.”\n\nIn a similar vein, board members encouraged students to approach their careers – and their job\n\nsearches – with open minds. “I was encouraged to take risks and apply for jobs that don’t\n\nnecessarily match up with the international affairs field and direction,” Nielsen said.\n\nAnother important piece of advice, according to the students: don’t underestimate the value of\n\nan international affairs degree; the world needs more individuals trained to work in an\n\ninterdisciplinary space.\n\nAs one board member told Vosper, “You can teach a person how to do the job, but you can’t\n\nteach a person to be interested in history.”\n\nNick DiMichele, MIPP ’21, was recently selected as a John S. McCain Strategic Defense Fellow, a one-year civilian fellowship program designed to pave the way for a career track toward senior leadership in the U.S. Department of Defense. The program provides rotations in the Office of the Secretary of Defense in order to gain vital experience and leadership capabilities and includes one-on-one mentoring with senior DoD leaders. Elliott School graduates have a good track record with the fellowship – 4 of the 29 recipients from the previous cohort are Elliott alumni, including Michael Choi, Christopher Riehl, Ryan Salzman, and Emilyn Tuomala.\n\nRead what Nick had to say about how the Elliott School prepared him for success.\n\nESIA: What will you be doing as a McCain Strategic Defense Fellow?\n\nND: I will work in the Pentagon for the Executive Services Directorate, specifically in the Classified Support Branch. My responsibilities in this role include handling, controlling, analyzing, and dispatching classified correspondence coming into and out of the department for the Secretary of Defense, Deputy Secretary of Defense, and Executive Secretary. This will be a tremendous rotational opportunity to see the department’s inner workings and how DoD conducts business. One of the greatest benefits of this fellowship is the ability to complete multiple rotational assignments to different components inside the department. For example, I plan on conducting a rotational assignment in the Strategy and Force Development office and the Europe and NATO office.\n\nThis fellowship extends beyond just conducting rotational assignments and learning how to do the job. McCain Fellows are offered $5,000 to use during the fellowship for professional development courses related to their duty position. Additionally, each McCain Fellow has the opportunity to receive a Senior Executive Service mentor to help guide and develop fellows. The foundation of this program is that the department wants to “build the bench” of next-generation national security leaders for DoD.\n\nESIA: What kind of job do you hope the fellowship will lead to in the future?\n\nND: My hope is that this fellowship will lead to a permanent position in DoD. With this fellowship, there is the opportunity to potentially convert into a full-time civilian employee inside the department, which is what I will be aiming for. However, I will be happy with any position supporting U.S. national security goals inside or outside the DoD.\n\nESIA: How did you find out about the fellowship?\n\nND: I heard about this fellowship from a friend. Once I researched the fellowship, I thought it was a phenomenal opportunity to break into the federal and national security sectors. This is just the third cohort for this fellowship, and I believe it is not as well known as others like the Presidential Management Fellowship. Publicizing and getting the word out about this opportunity is important because we need to build the bench of next-generation civil servants in the federal and national security apparatus.\n\nESIA: How did the Elliott School influence your professional choices and successes?\n\nND: I came off active duty in the Army in 2020 after a decade of service and knew I wanted to work in the foreign affairs and national security sector. When I came off active duty, I applied for the Elliott School because it is globally known as a premier school for international affairs. I quickly realized from speaking with the faculty at Elliott that there is significant overlap in international affairs and national security. One of the mottos of Elliott is to “educate the next generation of international leaders.” That motto is not just for show; Elliott lives it with the caliber of students admitted and the faculty teaching.\n\nI will also say that Elliott faculty from the policy realm helped me understand how to produce literature for a policymaker. I had to create the traditional longer papers for my classes, but a lot of the time, the professors wanted a two to three-page write-up summarizing information. When you begin working in the policy ecosystem, you realize that two to three-page memorandums are what drive processes forward. The Elliott School reinforced the idea of being able to give the Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF) when producing memos, which helped me understand what policymakers need to make decisions.\n\nESIA: Are there particular classes and professors who stand out in your mind? Who helped you on your career path?\n\nND: As I’ve said before, the caliber of faculty at Elliott is truly unmatched, but there were a few professors that really influenced me. Dr. Erwan Lagadec taught the course Strategic Challenges Facing NATO, and he set up a one-on-one mentoring session for me with the prior Deputy Secretary General of NATO, Rose Gottemoeller, who advised me on a paper I was writing. (Editor’s note: Ms. Gottemoeller is also an Elliott alumna, MA ’81.)\n\nDr. Jonathan Schroden taught the course Military Power and Effectiveness, in which he challenged us to think beyond the traditional understanding of planes, tanks, weapons, and personnel for what constitutes a country’s military power.\n\nDr. Michael O’Hanlon taught the course Who Will Rule the 21st Century, where he challenged us to make an argument for who or what will rule in the future.\n\nDr. Matthew Levinger and Dr. Lauren Van Metre were advisors for my thesis and helped guide my recommendation into practical terms. Dr. Levinger and Dr. Van Metre also set up one-on-one mentor sessions with Luke Coffey, an expert on the Republic of Georgia, and Lt. Gen (Ret.) Ben Hodges, who was the prior commanding general of the United States Army Europe. These mentor sessions helped me produce a grounded thesis on the Republic of Georgia and its relationship with NATO.\n\nThese are only a few of the many professors who were influential and helped set me up for success. The networks and expertise that the faculty bring to bear at the Elliott School are unmatched and truly remarkable. My time at Elliott, without question, helped set me up for success to work in the national security ecosystem.\n\nWhat made you choose GW?\n\nWhen I was making my college decision it was a question between staying in state or going all the way out to DC and in the end I chose GW mostly for academic reasons and for new opportunities. It was hard to choose to live so far away, but the city atmosphere was always exciting and there wasn’t a program that really catered to my interests in Seattle\n\nWhat school were you in between?\n\nI was in between the University of Washington and GW. I had two sisters that went there one just graduated with a public health degree and my other sister is a junior at the moment and she is studying psychology.\n\nAre you interested in Greek life?\n\nYes, both of my sisters went through the greek system in Washington and I think interested in joining greek life here.\n\nI’m pretty sure I want to join the panhellenic sororities. I don’t have a favorite yet but I’m interested to look into them and see which one I would like to be in, especially during formal recruitment in mid-January.\n\nWhat’s your favorite thing you have done in DC so far?\n\nI think the most exciting thing I have done was taking a White House tour. I actually had to contact my congressional representative about 3 months in advance to request the tour. I took a red eye here and went straight to the White House so it was pretty tiring, but it was really cool and I got lots of good photos.Also, going around Georgetown was super cute also there was a lot of shops and food, so that’s definitely some place you have to go if you are in DC\n\nWhat’s the best food you have had here?\n\nI have had the best food in Western Market. There is a shawarma spot I went to with my friends and it was super good. I had never tried it before and it was so delicious and at a good price too.\n\nWhat’s on your bucket list?\n\nIf there are more opportunities for activism, demonstrations and that sort of stuff it would be really interesting to be a part of.\n\nDo you have any favorite or interesting classes so far?\n\nI think my education here has been general so far just doing history, economics, French, and international affairs. French is definitely a challenge because at my high school we did not have our classes instructed in the french language, but here class is entirely in French. There is a learning curve, but it’s making me improve a lot in French and especially in speaking.\n\nI had also never taken an economics class before but so far it’s interesting. The math component is a nice break from the rest of my classes which are reading focused. Of course international affairs is the most interesting class because my professor Michael Brown is super passionate and engaging.\n\nAnything that surprised you now living as a student at GW?\n\nI definitely feel more connected with the city. While I was touring I thought that because I was on a college campus it would be very enclosed. However I actually feel I’m always leaving campus and finding new restaurants with new things to do. I love all of the beautiful architecture and monuments that have not gotten old yet.\n\nWhat is the social scene like at GW in your opinion?\n\nSome people say there are no parties at this school, however I have seen an article or two saying that this is a party school. In my experience it’s kinda in the middle, there’s definitely some night life but it’s not crazy. Because we are in the middle of the city there is a bit of a space limitation. I have signed up for George’s army and I am excited to watch basketball and other sports throughout the year.\n\nWhat future goals do you have in Washington?\n\nI currently have a federal work study job in the public affairs office of Elliot. I am still figuring out my concentration within international affairs at the moment so, I don’t quite know what internships I would like yet. I am considering a concentration in international development or international economics."
