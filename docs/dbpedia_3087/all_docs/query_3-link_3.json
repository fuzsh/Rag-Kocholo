Thomas Kail is director and executive producer, along with Adam Milch and Jennifer Todd who executive produces for Old 320 Sycamore and Ben Affleck and Matt Damon who executive produces for Pearl Street Films.[9] The score is composed by Rachel Portman and Jon Ehrlich.[10]\n\nCasting\n\n[edit]\n\nJoey King, Logan Lerman, Henry Lloyd-Hughes, Amit Rahav and Hadas Yaron were cast as siblings who grow up in Radom, Poland with Lerman's role of Addy Kurc based on Hunter's real-life grandfather.[11] Both King and Lerman have discussed having family members themselves who escaped The Holocaust.[12][13]\n\nMost of the characters are Polish Jews and these roles are mostly played by Jewish actors from the United States, Israel and England.[14] This is the second time that Yaron and Aloni have appeared as a couple, following their 2015–2021 work in the Israeli drama series Shtisel.[15] The role of Madame Lowbeer is portrayed by a non-Jewish actress, Marin Hinkle, who in real life is married to a Jewish man and raised their son Jewish.[16]\n\nFilming\n\n[edit]\n\nFilming took place from December 2022 and finished in spring 2023. Primarily filming took place in Bucharest, Romania with filming locations also including Málaga and Cádiz in Spain.[17]\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nThe series premiered on Hulu in the United States on March 28, 2024.[18]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 95% approval rating with an average rating of 8/10, based on 22 critic reviews. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Equal parts harrowing and life-affirming, We Were the Lucky Ones is a sensitively told tale of perseverance given tear-inducing heart by its wonderful ensemble.\"[19] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the limited series a \"generally favorable\" score of 80 out of 100, based on 13 critics.[20] RogerEbert.com concluded that \"We Were the Lucky Ones is a defiant and harrowing, soul shattering story—one that gives the full range of the horrors that occur when you’ve been displaced, unmoored, and dehumanized.\"[21] Aramide Tinibu of Variety also praised the series: \"Spending extended time with each member of the Kurcs allows the viewer to get into their psyche while absorbing differing perspectives and opinions instead of a monolithic overview of Holocaust survivors.\"[22]\n\nThe Jewish website Kveller praised the series as \"a visceral, touching, sweeping and profoundly human show, one of the best you’ll see all year, and the Jewish representation in it is deeply thoughtful, perhaps more than any show I’ve ever seen.\"[14] The Boston Globe concluded: \"So yes, the miniseries is challenging, and steeped in heartbreak, and unrelenting. But it joins a growing inventory of important, eye-opening, memorable, and timely TV takes on the Holocaust and World War II. Ultimately it is as rewarding as it is harrowing.\"[23]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nAward Date of ceremony Category Nominee(s) Result Ref.
