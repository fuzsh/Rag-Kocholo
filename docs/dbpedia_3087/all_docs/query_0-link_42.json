        "text": "Elliott Gould has said Donald Sutherland was “like my brother” as he paid tribute to his MASH co-star, who died Thursday at 88.\n\nIn an Instagram message posted hours ago, Gould wrote an emotional note wishing the actor goodbye. The pair co-starred in Robert Altman’s 1970 dark war comedy MASH, alongside the likes of Tom Skerritt and Sally Kellerman. They reteamed four years later for Irvin Kershner’s comedy S*P*Y*S.\n\n“Donald was a giant, not only physically but as a talent,” wrote Gould. “He was also enormously kind and generous.”\n\nHe recalled that the pair had become fathers to sons born just a week apart in December 1966 — actors Jason Gould and Kiefer Sutherland, the latter of whom was a twin alongside Rachel.\n\n“It’s not easy, losing the caliber of a human being and actor like Donald Sutherland, but this one really profoundly hurts because Donald was like my brother, and a big part of my own career.”\n\nSutherland died yesterday in Miami after a long illness. Alongside MASH, he starred in scores of films, including The Dirty Dozen, Klute, Animal House, Pride & Prejudice and The Hunger Games franchise andwon an Emmy and a Golden Globe for playing Russian Col. Mikhail Fetisov in HBO’s 1995 serial-killer thriller telepic Citizen X.\n\nThe 2017 Honorary Oscar recipient also is the father of veteran CAA Media Finance exec Roeg Sutherland."
