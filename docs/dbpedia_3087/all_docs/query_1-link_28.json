        "text": "THE SHORT VERDICT:\n\nNostalgic, fresh, and so full of feels, Twenty-Five, Twenty-One is the show that I didn’t know I needed, in my life.\n\nThe writing is thoughtful and tender, and combined with great casting and excellent delivery, our characters pop with so much life and heart, their relationships feel so raw and real, and their journeys feel so familiar and relatable, that I couldn’t get enough of it all.\n\nTo top it all off, the music is pitch perfect and excellently applied, making the already great feels land with extra oomph and amplification.\n\nSome lens adjustments are necessary (and so important!) – which I’ll talk more about shortly.\n\nTHE LONG VERDICT:\n\nI love this show right away, and I loved it all the way through to the end, through all the ups and downs that Show introduces for our characters.\n\nOne of my favorite things about this show, is how fresh it feels.\n\nMany dramas feel like they’re rehashing similar storylines and working to make them feel fresh. This doesn’t feel anything like that at all; this just feels fresh, all on its own. I love that.\n\nThe feels are so real, with this one.\n\nI found that I approached each episode with a mix of glee and dread; glee because I knew I was going to love it, and dread because.. I felt like the first experience of watching this show, was almost too precious to use up.\n\nBut I watched it anyway, and loved it anyway.\n\nIt’s fantastic. ❤️\n\nOST ALBUM: FOR YOUR LISTENING PLEASURE\n\nI really enjoyed the OST; the music has such a spot-on ’90s feel to it, and the music really served to immerse me in this drama world, so much so that I felt like I was right there with our characters.\n\nI really like Track 1, Starlight, and I also really, really enjoy Track 4, Your Existence. They both give me breezy yet heartfelt vibes, and they both feel perfectly suited to our story of growing up, along with all of its joys and foibles.\n\nHere’s the OST album, in case you’d like to listen to to it, while you read the review.\n\nAs an alternative, here’s a soothing piano cover of the OST. I personally really like it. ❤️\n\nMANAGING EXPECTATIONS / THE VIEWING LENS\n\nHere are a few things that I think would be helpful to keep in mind, to maximize your enjoyment of your watch:\n\n1. Think “coming-of-age” rather than “romance”\n\nI feel like this could be the single most important piece of advice I could give you, around adjusting your viewing lens.\n\nWhile there is romance in our story, Show is quick to give us multiple hints and indications that its main focus is our characters’ coming-of-age journeys, rather than their love lives per se.\n\nI think some viewers studiously chose to ignore Show’s hints and indications (which, to be fair, are served up quickly, starting from its early episodes), and ended up feeling very disappointed.\n\nOn the other hand, with the right lens on, and an understanding that there’s no guarantee that our characters will do well, or that they’ll be soulmates for life, I found the bright-eyed hopefulness of youth to be so pure, and so bright, that it just filled this drama world, and it made me smile, just to bear witness to it.\n\n2. You don’t need to know anything about fencing, to enjoy this show\n\nNeither do you need to have an active interest in sports, or sports dramas, either.\n\nI don’t have a specific interest in sports dramas (although that might be evolving, since I’ve very much enjoyed the last few sports-related shows I watched very well), and I knew nothing about fencing coming into this show, and yet, Show had me fully invested and on the edge of my seat, around all the fencing stuff.\n\nReally well done.\n\n3. Show is honest, for better or for worse.\n\nI think knowing to expect this, helps.\n\nThis show feels so honest, from the happy times to the sad times, and it’s one of my favorite things about it.\n\nThere’s no holding back on the joyful glee, and that’s also no sugarcoating the heartache. I felt like I was right there with our characters, feeling what they feel. I loved that.\n\nSTUFF I LIKED\n\nIt’s nostalgia magic for me\n\nThis show turned out to be lightning in a bottle, for me.\n\nThe way this show brings the magic of youth to three-dimensional, popping, throbbing life, is so, so precious, that it basically made me amenable to roll with Show, regardless of how this story turned out.\n\nI’ve never really thought of myself as being overly sentimental about my growing up years, but this show makes me feel like I’m reliving those years, and feeling the magic of it all, even though my growing up years weren’t exactly like those of our characters.\n\nYet, watching each episode felt kinda-sorta like revisiting my teenage years, and re-feeling all the feelings that come with being young, innocent and on the cusp of growing up.\n\nThat’s quite magical, to me, and I think that’s the reason I love this show so much.\n\nGeneral handling and execution\n\nOverall, I feel that the handling and execution that we get with this show, is really excellent.\n\nSometimes, I didn’t immediately see the wisdom or value in the execution decisions made for our story, but inevitably, I would come around by the end of the arc or the episode, to see why stuff is presented the way it is.\n\nHere’s the quickish spotlight on a few things that I thought Show did very well.\n\nIf you’re wary of spoilers, just skimming the headings in this section should give you a flavor for what I’m talking about.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nThe way Show works the IMF crisis into our story\n\nI’d been curious to see how Show would work with using the IMF crsis as a backdrop, without it feeling too suffocatingly like a history lesson, and Show does beautifully, on that front.\n\nI like how Show keeps its IMF focus mainly on our characters’ personal experiences, thus making it all that much more relatable, while giving us little nuggets of history here and there, like how the public had donated their personal gold belongings, to help the nation through the crisis.\n\nLike how Hee Do (Kim Tae Ri) couldn’t care less about the IMF, until it impacted her fencing dreams. And how Yi Jin’s (Nam Joo Hyuk) entire life has turned upside down, because his family’s gone bankrupt.\n\nThis keeps it relatable, and prevents it from overtaking the story.\n\nThe way Show works with two timelines\n\nI really like the premise, where our entire story is basically viewed in the mind’s eye of the protagonist’s daughter, as she goes through her mom’s diary, while going through a ballet slump herself.\n\nTo my eyes, the present day portion is important enough, that I don’t begrudge it its screen time – even though it’s the past timeline that had my heart.\n\nNot only does it show us that Hee Do’s understanding of her mother continues to evolve in the present, ie, it’s an ongoing, incomplete journey, it also creates this mirror effect, where Min Chae (Choi Myung Bin) in the present, goes through a similar grappling of her own, in the midst of a Big Event of the times, like Hee Do herself had done, in the past.\n\nThat mirror effect made this story all the more thought-provoking, I felt.\n\nThe way Show works with context\n\nGoing into episode 7, I’d been impatient to see how the Asian Games panned out, and had been all ready to watch that finals match from beginning to end.\n\nHowever, Show had other ideas, and, even though I’d been slightly disappointed at first, that we only see snippets of the finals match, I do think that it works out well, overall.\n\nIn choosing not to focus 100% on the finals match itself, Show chooses to give us more backstory on Hee Do and Dad (Baek Suk Kwang), and how she’d started fencing, and well, I just can’t seem to ever say no to context, heh.\n\nI loved that additional context that we got, and I do think that it helped to enrich my understanding of Hee Do’s frame of mind, during the competition, right up to the point where she was neck and neck with Yu Rim (Bona), and then upon her victory as well.\n\nAnd, even though there are times when I kind of wish that we’d stay in the 1990s instead of dipping back into the pandemic present, I stand by my belief that context is supreme, and therefore, I appreciate – in principle – the way Show takes us back to Min Chae and Present Day Hee Do.\n\nI like the way Show interweaves the lesson that Hee Do had learned from Dad, and draws it out now, so that Hee Do imparts that same wisdom to Min Chae. Even when I’m impatient to see my 1990s characters, I do like these threads that emphasize that Min Chae’s experience is more connected and similar to her mom’s than she realizes.\n\nI also appreciate the fact that, thanks to the diaries, Min Chae is now at a place where she feels able to express to her mom, why she wants to quit ballet.\n\nCompared to where we’d started, where Min Chae had wanted nothing more than to get far away from Mom, this is excellent progress.\n\nAnd – it’s all because she understands Mom’s context better now.\n\nI do really like the idea that the wisdom that Dad had passed to Hee Do, is now being passed to Min Chae. Dad seems like such a good, decent and nice man; I’m glad that his legacy is being honored, in this organic, earthy, from-the-lips-of-elders-to-the-hearts-of-children sort of way.\n\nThe bookending in episode 14\n\nI think it’s clever of Show to bookend episode 14 with that TV interview that Yi Jin does with Hee Do.\n\nGiven the context of the episode, it makes sense that Hee Do would have been too busy and preoccupied, to have written any diary entries, during this time.\n\nTo have Min Chae search for news on Yi Jin and Hee Do online, and discover that TV interview, which then segues us into the events of the episode, works really well.\n\nAnd then to have the events of the episode eventually segue back to the end of the TV interview, lends such a depth of poignance to everything we know about the relationship between Yi Jin and Hee Do.\n\nIt’s excellently framed and executed.\n\nThe preparation for heartache\n\nShow’s does a solid enough job, of getting me to see this as a coming-of-age journey for our characters, that I felt relatively prepared to deal with the heartache.\n\nPlus, there’s Min Chae, whose very existence – and her lack of familiarity with Yi Jin – is enough to warn us ahead of time, that there’s heartache built into Yi Jin and Hee Do’s love story.\n\nIn that sense, I feel like I’d been reasonably well prepared, for the turn that episode 14 takes, at least in terms of the love story between Yi Jin and Hee Do.\n\nIn a similar sort of way, Show prepares us, a little bit, for the separation to come, between Hee Do and Yu Rim, which is one of the relationships that matters most to me, in this drama world.\n\nHee Do mentioning in the TV interview, that her most challenging time, had been when she’d won gold in Madrid, which had been her match against Yu Rim.\n\nThat already prepares me, somewhat, for what happens with Yu Rim, this episode, which is helpful.\n\nKnowing that these events are coming for our characters, makes the scenes in February 2000 land with an extra layer of poignance. Seeing them laugh and play together, while knowing that this is the beginning of the end of an era, is a rather heart-pinching experience.\n\nI found myself trying to savor the camaraderie extra, because I knew that it would have to come to an end, before very long.\n\nAnd yet, through it all, I felt that knowing it was coming, was better than not knowing at all.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nKim Tae Ri as Hee Do\n\nEven though I have varying levels of affection for several of our other key actors in this show, like Nam Joo Hyuk, for example, I have to confess that it’s Kim Tae Ri who has my heart, in this show.\n\nThis is literally my favorite role of Kim Tae Ri’s that I’ve seen, to date. She is flat-out WONDERFUL, as Hee Do. I just LUFF her, so much.\n\nI know reactions are mixed about how convincing Kim Tae Ri is, as an 18-year-old high schooler, but I personally think she nails it. I am completely convinced that Hee Do is an unpolished, gawky teenager, who’s all limbs, and all heart.\n\nI love what an irrepressible bundle of flaily, gangly, chaotic energy she is, and how her feelings are as large as I would expect of any wide-eyed, innocent teenager who’s unacquainted with the worries, or the scary things, in the world.\n\nHee Do strikes me as someone that you just can’t keep down for too long, and I just love Hee Do’s energy and spirit.\n\nHer bright-eyed, hopeful, passionate approach to the world is wonderful and infectious. She’s so full of passion and enthusiasm, and her dreams are so big, and so pure.\n\nAnd I love how she’s instinctively empathetic as well. She’s all heart and hope, and I love that about her, so much.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE1. For a start, I love how simple Hee Do’s joys are.\n\nGetting to see her fencing idol on a Saturday, even if it’s from a distance, and getting to read her favorite comic book are enough to bring a gigantic smile to her face, and more than a simple bounce to her step, and I find that very innocent and endearing.\n\nHee Do’s shortsighted plans for a forced transfer also strike me as very teenagery. It amuses me that it doesn’t ever occur to her, that getting arrested in and of itself, could get in the way of her having a career in sports.\n\nHer outrageous plans were fun to watch, though, and in particular, I enjoyed that whole umbrella-fencing sequence, where she singlehandedly commands the attention of both petty gangs, and everyone stops fighting, just to see how she thwacks that one boy into submission.\n\nI found that very amusing, and also, I found it rather thrilling, to see her fencing skills and instincts at play.\n\nEven though Hee Do is supposed to be in a slump, it seems like there’s no problem whatsoever with her fencing performance, when she isn’t actively thinking about it, like during the umbrella-fencing thing, and also, when Coach Yang throws that apple into the air, and Hee Do pierces it right through, with her foil.\n\nShe does have a knack for fencing, it looks like, and I’m glad that she’s passionate enough about it, to pursue it this actively, despite being in a slump and not performing up to expectation.\n\nI love-love-LOVE that scene, where Hee Do floats that umbrella down to her idol Yu Rim, and then hugs herself in glee, at the thought that her idol is using the umbrella that she’s provided.\n\nIt’s so very pure, and so very cute. I love it.\n\nE2. I love how frank and unfiltered Hee Do is, not only with her own feelings, but also, when she talks with others. There is absolutely no guile about her, and when she attempts to be polite and hide her feelings a little bit, it’s not hard to see right through her, to her true heart.\n\nI love how nonchalant and devil-may-care Hee Do is, in terms of her transfer to her new school.\n\nShe’s happily curious about things, and will ask if she wants to know something, but she’s also not at all intimidated by her new surroundings and the new people around her.\n\nShe literally only cares about fencing and about being near her idol Yu Rim, and her joy at these two things, is so, so pure.\n\nAlso, the way she goofy-spazzes about Yu Rim, like she’s her total girl-crush, is very cute.\n\nE3. I love Hee Do’s passion for fencing, and her desire to do well. The fact that she’s the only one who asks Coach Yang (Kim Hye Eun) for help, says a lot about Hee Do and her ability to think differently from the average student athlete.\n\nI don’t know what it is, but I got a lot of vicarious satisfaction from watching Hee Do train hard, for the national team qualifier, under Coach Yang’s guidance.\n\nHer unquestioning obedience, even when she doesn’t understand the rationale behind something like learning the choreography for a pop song (heh), is very endearing.\n\nE4. I just love the can’t-get-me-down quality that just exudes out of Hee Do.\n\nShe might be peeved at Yi Jin, and she might be disillusioned with Yu Rim, but she’s still so effervescent, and so full of vim. I love her.\n\nI found myself really enjoying her partnership with Ji Woong (Choi Hyun Wook), as sudden as it was.\n\nI kinda love how Hee Do throws herself at the chance to learn dance from Ji Woong, and isn’t deterred, even though, at first, he looks like he wants nothing to do with her.\n\nI love that she manages to get his attention with the promise of a mutually beneficial deal, and I love how that eventually grows their connection, such that by the time Hee Do actually masters the choreography that Ji Woong teaches her, they feel like actual friends.\n\nAlso, I do love the detail, that Hee Do’s basically gained access to Ji Woong’s and Seung Wan’s (Lee Joo Myoung) secret hideout, which technically means that she’s more than just a regular friend now, right?\n\nI love how matter-of-fact Hee Do is about the whole thing, while still being openly appreciative of the space that Seung Wan’s made of the rooftop shed.\n\nI find it really endearing, that all episode long, we see Hee Do determinedly keeping up with all of Coach Yang’s instructions, even when she doesn’t understand why some of these instructions have been given.\n\nThat wholehearted dedication and unquestioning trust is very endearing to me.\n\nAnd when Coach Yang drums it into Hee Do that she’s lacking in strategic thinking, I have to love how Hee Do chooses to tackle the problem with Snooty Sunbae (Bang Eun Jung), who refuses to let her juniors train at night.\n\nIt’s freaking brilliant, the way Hee Do approaches Sunbae with such enthusiasm, to apologize, and to advocate for the entire team to train together in the evenings.\n\nWith everyone watching, Sunbae can’t bully Hee Do for it, and Hee Do basically gets a public go-ahead to train at night, whether Sunbae joins her or not. I love that.\n\nAnd the way Coach Yang has to stop herself from chuckling over this, as she overhears the whole thing, just makes it all even better. 😁\n\nE5. I loved watching Hee Do at the tryouts; her every win felt so vicariously thrilling to me.\n\nI also love her shrieks of jubilation at every positive milestone. I love this wild abandon about her. She doesn’t care whether anyone thinks her shrieks are appropriate or not, or well-mannered and ladylike or not.\n\nShe just expresses herself to the degree which she needs to, and I love that.\n\nIt’s really exciting to see her come up against traditionally better ranked competitors, and come out victorious.\n\nIn particular, I thought it was very savvy and strategic of her, to cede 5 points to Kim Jeong Hyeon, right off the bat, in order to analyze her fencing style.\n\nI love that in the end, Coach Yang’s faith in Hee Do, is the missing piece that helps to anchor Hee Do’s own faith in herself.\n\nIt’s true that she hasn’t built up enough faith in her own abilities, so it’s just really cool to see her grab onto Coach Yang’s faith in her as a stand-in, and ride that to victory. YESS.\n\nE5. On a different note, I like that Hee Do also remains steady and undisturbed, in the face of the coach’s very apparent bias in Yu Rim’s favor.\n\nYu Rim is the gold medalist, after all, and it feels like after Hee Do’s worked so hard to get into the team, she’s basically treated almost like some kind of second-class citizen, particularly when in context with Yu Rim the gold medalist.\n\nI like that Hee Do doesn’t allow that to get to her too much.\n\nIn fact, I really like that she always just looks for a way to cope and make herself happy, even when things don’t happen the way she’d like.\n\nLike when Yu Rim turns out to be the snorer between them, Hee Do doesn’t waste time angsting over it. Instead, she takes out one of Yi Jin’s broadcast recordings, and comforts herself by listening to that. I really like that about her.\n\nE7. It feels so significant, that the thing that propels Hee Do to victory, in this all-important match, is the reminder that Dad had imparted to her; that she fences for the joy of it, and not for anything else.\n\nThat truly is the thing that allows Hee Do to transcend the pressure of the moment – pressure which ultimately gets to Yu Rim – and win that milestone match. HUZZAH! 🤩\n\nI truly had my heart in my throat for Hee Do, not just out of wanting her to win, but from feeling vicariously, all the emotions of the moment, because I felt so invested in her journey.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nNam Joo Hyuk as Yi Jin\n\nI really enjoyed Nam Joo Hyuk as Yi Jin. It feels to me, like this role fits him like a glove.\n\nHe totally looks the part of a young man, who, up till recently, had grown up with all the comforts he could have ever wanted, and is now acquainting himself with the harsh reality of working multiple jobs in order to make rent.\n\nWhat he gives us, in Yi Jin, reminds me of his work in The Light in Your Eyes, and even The School Nurse Files.\n\nBoth of those were roles where I was genuinely impressed by his delivery, and felt that he was proving himself to be a more serious actor than one might first assume, if only looking at his fluffier, relatively easier roles like Start-Up, Weightlifting Kim Bok Joo, and School 2015.\n\nI really enjoyed Yi Jin as a character, and I really like the way Show helps us to get to know him, by showing us different facets to him, one at a time, until we get a fuller sense of him as a person.\n\nThe further we get into our story, the clearer it becomes, the kind of underlying angst that lies in Yi Jin’s story, and I really liked the way Nam Joo Hyuk delivers it all.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE1. I really like Yi Jin’s temperament, so far.\n\nHe doesn’t get riled up easily, like when the neighbor on his paper route makes a fuss about receiving his paper late, or when Hee Do tries to repair that copy of Full House, and fails so miserably.\n\nHe could have gotten upset both times, but instead, he remains calm as he apologizes to the neighbor and assures him that it’s just coz it’s his first day on the job, and that his paper would be on time going forward, and he chuckles over Hee Do’s desperate drawings, which she’s used to replace the ruined ones.\n\nPlus, there’s how he works to protect Hee Do at the nightclub, even though they are barely acquainted.\n\nI kinda love how he tells his so-called friend that the one good thing about his family going bankrupt, is how he gets to see people at their worst; that that so-called friend should have treated him this way from the start, so that he wouldn’t have been mistaken that they were friends.\n\nYES. I love how matter-of-fact that takedown is, and I love how Yi Jin doesn’t stoop to his friend’s way of doing things, just because he’s down and out.\n\nI love that earthy steeliness about him.\n\nE2. The flashbacks to Yi Jin’s happier, more carefree days, land so poignantly, in contrast to his current situation.\n\nWhat a rude shock it must be for him, to one day have the perfect life, and the next, to have that perfect life give way to his worst nightmare, pretty much.\n\nThat scene, where his father’s ex-associates are badgering him for information his father’s whereabouts, is so painful to watch.\n\nYi Jin looks so deeply pained, and so sad and so helpless, all at the same time.\n\nI felt so sorry for him, when he eked out that promise, to never be happy again, as a way to make up for the misery that these men are now in, because of his father.\n\nOof. That hurt to watch, seriously.\n\nPoor Yi Jin. He should never have been place in such a situation, because, honestly, what can he do?\n\nHe can’t give them back the money they lost, because he barely has any money himself, and he can’t tell them his father’s whereabouts, because he doesn’t actually know where his father is.\n\nNam Joo Hyuk does such a fantastic job of this scene. He made my heart break for Yi Jin, and he made Yi Jin’s dilemma feel so painfully, profoundly wretched. 💔\n\nE3. I have to love how quietly droll Yi Jin is, when Seung Wan suddenly changes her attitude towards him, and is all eager-to-please hoobae, her snooty landlady’s daughter persona completely forgotten.\n\nIt’s so in character for Yi Jin to be gently sardonic about it, without actually being nasty, and it’s so like him, to not take advantage of Seung Wan’s sudden desire to please, and still promise to keep to the shower timings that she’d requested earlier.\n\nIn fact, the way Yi Jin later threatens those boys who’ve been bullying his brother Yi Hyun (Choi Min Young), is pretty low-key as well.\n\nHe definitely makes his presence felt, and he does straight-up threaten to kill them, but his manner, as he does this, strikes me as quite tamped-down, and almost.. reasonable. I like that about him.\n\nAlso, it’s poignant and so very endearing, that when Little Bro asks Yi Jin not to get involved anymore, Yi Jin actually apologizes and says that he was wrong.\n\nI just love the idea of Yi Jin being a Big Brother who’ll listen to his little brother’s opinions, and give in to his little brother. 😍\n\nE3. I really love the conversation that Yi Jin has with Yu Rim after the Full House debacle (which was so great in itself); he’s just so reasonable about it all.\n\nWhen Yu Rim tells him not to get too close to Hee Do coz she doesn’t like Hee Do, I like how Yi Jin straight-up tells Yu Rim that she’s being childish.\n\nHe just has this way of being honest and matter-of-fact about things, without actually sounding offensive. It’s one of my favorite things about him.\n\nI love how he gently points out to Yu Rim that she’d liked him for his fancy sports car, and not for himself, and then deftly lifts her spirits, by reframing everything, so that her sense of annoyance at herself, gives way to a sense of anticipation of actually meeting her actual first love.\n\nThat’s so masterful, really, and I love how Yi Jin manages to navigate this delicate conversation so well, and without even looking like he has to think or try very hard, to do it.\n\nE3. The arc with Yi Jin’s father (Park Yoon Hee) had me with my heart in my throat, honestly.\n\nOn the one hand, Hee Do means well, in her enthusiastic, blustery sort of way, and I actually like the detail, that Yi Jin hides when she tells him to, without even thinking to question her judgment.\n\nOn the other hand, how heartbreaking, that the man that Yi Jin hides from, turns out to be his father, who’s on a rare trip to Seoul, to see his sons.\n\nI’m SO glad that Yi Jin manages to meet Dad after all, and have those few precious minutes with him.\n\nWith him feeling so burdened and alone in the world, I feel that it’s extra precious, that Yi Jin gets to feel, at least for a moment, that he’s the child, and not the adult.\n\nTheir short meeting lands so poignantly, to my eyes.\n\nThe way Yi Jin tries his best to be strong, but his sadness kind of leaking out anyway; the sheen of tears in his eyes; the crack in his voice.\n\nThe way Yi Jin seems to be trying to soak up every last second of Dad’s presence; the way Yi Jin brushes his tears away, and makes that promise to Dad, to reunite their family; it’s all so, so heart-achey and full of pathos.\n\nAw. I’m glad Yi Jin gets to hug Dad, and my heart can’t help but go out to Yi Jin, as he wipes away tears, even as he leans into Dad’s shoulder. Sweet, dear, strong, earnest boy. 😭❤️\n\nE5. It’s so poignant to see Yi Jin’s semblance of normalcy come crashing down on him.\n\nI feel for him, so much, that he feels the need to ditch everything and run away, with his brother Yi Hyun.\n\nI really do feel for how he’s having to grow up so fast. Where before, he could’ve been a carefree college kid who had only to worry about his exams, now he’s literally worrying for his entire family’s wellbeing.\n\nI like how Yi Jin throws himself into working at the fish market, even though he’s never done such work before. I like that he doesn’t have any qualms about working this type of laborious job, even though he’d lived the cushy life of a chaebol prince up till not that long ago.\n\nThat incident where Yi Hyun pretends not to know him at the fish market, though, is heartbreaking. It’s even sadder, when it’s contrasted with how proud Yi Hyun had been of his hyung, not that long ago.\n\nI credit Yi Jin for being so calm when confronting Yi Hyun about it, because I’m sure that anyone else in his place, would have been more than a little hurt and upset, and would have likely shown that.\n\nInstead, Yi Jin is restrained, even as he talks to Yi Hyun about it, and then, when Yi Hyun makes to storm away, Yi Jin stops him, saying that it’s cold, and leaves instead.\n\nOof. Yi Jin really is doing his best to be a good hyung.\n\nPerhaps because of this, it hurts even more, to hear Yi Jin admit to Uncle (Park Jung Pyo), that he thinks Yi Hyun is right; that he had wanted to run away himself, and had used Yi Hyun as an excuse.\n\nI really appreciate this about Yi Jin. He isn’t quick to point fingers or shift blame; in fact, he’s quick to examine himself and reflect on the true state of his heart.\n\nThat must be so hard to do, given how much Yi Jin has suffered lately, with all the creditors coming after him, through no fault of his own.\n\nE6. I’m glad to see Yi Jin make the decision to go back to Seoul. And I very much like his reason for choosing to go back: because he’s done running away. This feels mature and brave, and I’m glad that he has his family’s blessings, as he leaves Pohang.\n\nI’m also glad that Yi Hyun listens to Seung Wan’s radio DJ advice, and makes up with Yi Jin, as Yi Jin leaves for Seoul.\n\nThe way he puts that apology note, along with some music and a player, and what looks like nicotine gum, in Yi Jin’s things, feels quite perfect.\n\nIt’s matter-of-fact yet affectionate, and it not only communicates Yi Hyun’s apology, it also reminds Yi Jin not to neglect himself and the things that he loves, and to quit smoking. I like that.\n\nE9. I really appreciate the way Yi Jin works to protect both Hee Do and Yu Rim, in the course of making the documentary.\n\nThe fact that he says no to that sunbae (Yoon Joo Man) so firmly, even though it would be considered ill-mannered of him, to talk back to someone more senior, says a lot about how serious he is, in wanting to do his best by both Hee Do and Yu Rim.\n\nIt’s too bad that Sunbae is so adamant on creating some sense of Drama, in their documentary, that he ignores Yi Jin’s decision to NOT feature the simultaneous touch, and forces Yu Rim and Hee Do to execute it repeatedly, until Hee Do falls and twists her ankle. Gah. How awful.\n\nI hated Sunbae for taking things into his own hand, and even more, for treating both athletes with such condescension, just because they didn’t know any better but to follow his instructions.\n\nI’m so glad that Yi Jin comes running, and confronts Sunbae about it.\n\nThat comeback that he throws as Sunbae is so perfect, when Sunbae taunts him, asking if he’ll take responsibility for poor ratings.\n\n“I’ll take responsibility. But what if the athletes get injured? Will you take responsibility? How will you do that? They have competitions lined up starting next year. How will you take responsibility?”\n\nYES. Perfectly said, Yi Jin.\n\nE10. I find my heart going out to Yi Jin, as he is forced to navigate the politics of what it means to work in a corporate environment.\n\nThe fact that he’s expected to apologize for the comfort of the general population of colleagues, never mind whether he was right or wrong; the fact that he’s ribbed about his lack of a college degree; the fact that there’s pressure on him to do well, because he’s the first high school graduate whom the station has hired.\n\nIt’s a lot to carry on his shoulders, particularly on top of the family burdens that he holds, and it makes my heart pinch, to watch Yi Jin gather his fortitude, to do the necessary.\n\nI do really appreciate that beat when Dad calls, and they have a bit of a heart to heart conversation.\n\nI really like how Dad picks up quite quickly, on the fact that Yi Jin’s struggling, but working hard to take everything in his stride.\n\nIt means even more, I feel, that Dad picks up on this, even though Yi Jin doesn’t actively tell Dad anything about what he’s going through.\n\nI appreciate that even though Dad can’t make Yi Jin’s troubles go away, and neither can Dad really offer any solutions, the fact that Dad is understanding, and shares his own struggles, gives Yi Jin a sense of perspective.\n\nThat feels really important, given how confronting the struggles can be sometimes.\n\nAnd, it makes me glad that Dad is in touch with Yi Jin, even though they aren’t living together at the moment.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nHee Do and Yi Jin together\n\nI know some viewers struggled with the idea of Yi Jin and Hee Do becoming close, with him being 22, and Hee Do, still a high-schooler, at 18.\n\nHowever, I have to say that Show does such a great job of demonstrating the bond between them, from the time they meet, to how organically it grows into something bigger, stronger and deeper than they’d imagined, that I had zero difficulties with their age-gap connection.\n\nIn fact, one of the things I loved the most about the bond between Yi Jin and Hee Do, is how it defies definition and boundaries, pretty much all the way through.\n\nJust because it’s unusual for an 18-year-old to be close to a 22-year-old, doesn’t stop them from reaching out to each other, and understanding and supporting each other, in real and tangible, and very precious ways.\n\nIt’s so wholesome and pure, and I love it, so much.\n\nSure, things turn romantic between them eventually, but I just wanted to state for the record, that this relationship was wonderful and precious, long before it turned romantic.\n\nWatching these two people bond over the big and small things, gave me a lot of joy, and here are all of my resulting thoughts, in this next spoiler section.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE1. I love how different Hee Do and Yi Jin are, and how it shows up in their interactions.\n\nShe’s all bursts of pure, unfiltered emotional energy, like when she yells at him for breaking the peeing boy statue in her garden, and he’s all matter-of-fact groundedness.\n\nI love the way he seems to be consistently unruffled by her outbursts, and just homes in on the logical things, like checking her returned comics for snot, and telling her that her plan for transferring school sucks.\n\nPlus, I do love that he is so amused by her attempt to repair the comic book. He’s so good-natured. And, it does warm my heart, to think that he’s grown a little bit fond of the noisy, chaotic girl who’s inexplicably invaded his life from the most unexpected corners.\n\nI love that closing scene, where Hee Do yells after him with so much unadulterated joy, to tell him that she’s going to transfer schools after all, and keep fencing, and that she’d used the special right that only comes with her age, that he’d reminded her of.\n\nI love how delighted Hee Do looks, in this moment, and I also really like Yi Jin’s quietly muttered “congratulations,” as he cycles away.\n\nThat feels pitch perfect, because he’s happy for her, but at the same time, we’re reminded that his life isn’t rosy at all right now, and he’s got to keep working, to keep making ends meet.\n\nI’m really looking forward to watching how this unexpected connection between Hee Do and Yi Jin continues to grow.\n\nE2. I love-love-LOVE the interactions between Hee Do and Yi Jin. It all feels so natural and easy, almost as if it were all unscripted – even though I know it is.\n\nI really like how Yi Jin continues to be friendly with Hee Do, even though he’s in a really tough personal situation, and it would be easy to just withdraw into himself and just not talk to people. I actually really appreciate that detail about him.\n\nEven at his lowest, with all this responsibility bearing down on him, for being his family’s son, he makes it a point to visit Yu Rim, to make sure she’s ok, and when he runs into Hee Do, he makes it a point to connect with her, even though she makes it a point to avoid him, at least a little bit, for the fact that he knows Yu Rim.\n\nI love that Hee Do’s petty effort to distance herself from Yi Jin doesn’t last long at all, and that the moment he lets on that he’d heard her happy news about her transfer, in the morning, she completely opens up, with her cheeky-mischievous nature firmly back in place.\n\nI love that little detail, where he extends his hand to congratulate her, and she smacks it away, with a naughty grin, saying that she hadn’t heard him.\n\nThis feels so artless, carefree and innocent; I love it so much.\n\nI found the scene on the bus very cute, with her giving up the seat to him as a way to respect the elderly, then him saving her from a fall by grabbing her by the backpack – and then giving up the seat to her, as athlete protection.\n\nTee hee. They just this really good rhythm with each other, with the way they rib each other, without missing a beat.\n\nE2. I’d kind of thought that Hee Do being privy to this very private pain of Yi Jin’s, might put a damper on their relationship, but in true Hee Do fashion, she doesn’t allow this to get in the way of bonding with Yi Jin, and in true Yi Jin fashion, he doesn’t allow his personal situation to get in the way of being friends with Hee Do.\n\nThe way Hee Do navigates the conversation with Yi Jin, following this incident, feels so pitch perfect.\n\nShe remains unfiltered, and doesn’t shy away from talking about it, but the way she talks about it is – for her, anyway – quite gentle and tentative.\n\nPlus, I think it helps that Hee Doo naturally goes off on regular tangents, which inadvertently work to take the focus off Yi Jin’s situation, somewhat.\n\nI think, together, this has the effect of taking away the shame of the moment, for Yi Jin. Like, it’s ok to talk about it, because it’s nothing that shameful.\n\nI love that when Yi Jin says that he would like to turn back time, Hee Do thinks of the one thing that brings her pure, unadulterated joy, and takes Yi Jin to experience it.\n\nThe upside-down faucet fountain is such a simple thing, and it brings her so much joy; I love it. I love how it really doesn’t take much, to bring a smile to Hee Do’s face.\n\nI also love how Yi Jin keeps an open mind to this serving of happiness that Hee Do is offering him.\n\nInstead of snubbing the small happiness it represents, he gamely thinks of a way to take it to the next level, by turning on all the faucets, to make a medley of faucet fountains.\n\nHee Do’s wonder at Yi Jin’s ability to think big, and her accompanying cackle of happiness is so perfect. Hee.\n\nIt’s so great, to see them playing happily in the water like that. In that moment, it feels like all of Yi Jin’s troubles have melted away, and that’s precious.\n\nIn a similar sort of vein, I love Hee Do’s assertive proposal to Yi Jin, at the close of our episode.\n\nAfter they’re all wet and out of breath from running away from the security guard, Hee Do, eyes shining, grins breathlessly to Yi Jin, “Let’s do fun things together from time to time.”\n\n“Remember what you said to those men earlier today? You said you’ll never be happy again.”\n\n“I’m against that. The times took everything from you. You can’t give up on happiness. But you already gave your word to them.\n\nHow about this? From now on, when you hang out with me, you can be happy and keep it a secret. When it’s just us two, let’s be happy when we’re together, albeit temporarily. So this can be our little secret.”\n\nWhat a wonderful, perfect proposal, honestly. It’s so wonderfully earnest, and so innocently pure.\n\nI love that it brings a genuine smile of comfort, to Yi Jin’s face, and I can’t wait to see these two hanging out together, and spending happy times together, just like Hee Do promises. ❤️\n\nE3. Honestly, I am lapping up any little hint, that Yi Jin and Hee Do are growing closer. At this point, I’m not even looking for a romantic connection, really.\n\nI just love the idea of them being there for each other, and I actually really like the idea of their relationship not actually having a definition.\n\nLike that moment when Seung Wan asks Hee Do what kind of relationship she has with Yi Jin, I actually kinda love that Hee Do is stumped for a bit, because she and Yi Jin haven’t ever really stopped to define their relationship.\n\nThey’ve just.. bonded, in the moment, without the need for definitions, and that gives me an inordinate amount of satisfaction.\n\nI love the detail, that Yi Jin notices that the math quiz on the washroom door has changed, and makes it a point to solve it, and take note of the new answer, for Hee Do.\n\nIt’s the little things, y’all!\n\nThe fact that he thinks of Hee Do, in even this small thing, because he knows how this piece of information will make her life easier and smoother, gives me a case of the goofy grins.\n\nE3. It’s just like Hee Do, to run for hours, trying to find Yi Jin’s dad, the moment she realizes that the man she’d told Yi Jin to hide from, had been none other than his own father.\n\nEven on a regular day, it feels like Hee Do’s feelings are maybe too big to be housed in her heart, and therefore need to kind of burst out, a little bit.\n\nEven more so, in this moment, when she is terrified at the thought that she might have robbed Yi Jin of the rare, precious chance to see his father.\n\nDespite it being a difficult moment for Hee Do, I can’t help but kinda love how much she cares, and how consumed she is, by the need to help Yi Jin locate his father, even though she has no idea where or how to find him.\n\nI love that when Yi Jin spots her from the bus, he immediately knows what’s up, and why she’s running around like that.\n\nI love that when he gets off the bus and races to her, his first thought is for her wellbeing, because she’s been running around like a mad woman, without any proper shoes on.\n\nAll he can think about, is that she could have hurt herself. And all she can think about, is how she’d lost Yi Jin’s dad for him.\n\nAhhh. The mutual care and concern just fills my heart so. 🥰\n\nI have to love how, the moment Yi Jin tells Hee Do that she doesn’t have to feel sorry, because he did manage to meet his dad, she cries in relief, and then becomes quietly rueful, before swinging into this amazingly buoyant mood, because all is right in the world again.\n\nI love that about her. She feels everything in the moment, without holding back, and that’s why she’s able to move forward so completely.\n\nThe way Yi Jin rigs that three-legged set-up for them, so that he can get Hee Do home, is so cute.\n\nTee hee hee. I couldn’t help giggling at the sight of them stopping to bicker, with Hee Do grumbling that she feels like her shoulder’s about to pop from having her arm up around Yi Jin’s shoulder, and then three-legged hobbling home together.\n\nAhahaha. I luff these two together, so much. 😍😍\n\nE3. In that moment, when Hee Do tearfully tells Yi Jin, that she hasn’t managed to control the distance well between her and her opponent, and has expected too much from him and Yu Rim, I feel sorry for them both, because I feel for them both.\n\nYi Jin isn’t wrong, for not wanting to say that Yu Rim’s unequivocally in the wrong, and Hee Do isn’t wrong either, for not wanting to bow to unreasonable demands.\n\nGah. I hope that this doesn’t drive a wedge between them, because I love it when they get along. They’re supposed to be happy when they’re together, as Yi Jin says.\n\nE4. This episode, I’m struck by what a contrast we see, between Hee Do’s life, and Yi Jin’s life.\n\nWhile Hee Do has the freedom to throw herself into training with wild abandon, Yi Jin’s sober answer about gravity, during his job interview – which he fails, poor guy – really does give me pause.\n\nEven though Yi Jin is only 22 years old, he definitely looks and sounds rather jaded with life, particularly with his answer about how gravity is the only thing that he feels is unchanging.\n\nIt really speaks of how everything else in his life that has changed, and it also indicates to us, without really spelling it all out, just how hard all these changes have hit him, for him to get to a place where he seriously concludes that gravity is the only thing that doesn’t change, in this world.\n\nIt makes my heart go out to him, for all the things and people that he’s lost, during this upheaval in his life.\n\nI can understand why Yi Jin would drink himself tipsy, after failing the interview, and feeling patronized by his friend, on top of it.\n\nWhat I love about this situation is, that Yi Jin is still so amused by Hee Do while he’s drunk, and Hee Do, for all of her peevishness towards Yi Jin, doesn’t allow that to get in the way of her sitting down with him, and talking with him, and then later, coming back to cover him with a blanket (and that handwritten sign!), while he sleeps sitting out there on the street.\n\nIt’s all so wholesome.\n\nI love that Yi Jin tells Hee Do that she makes him smile, and I love that when Yi Jin tells her that he failed the interview, she immediately says that the company had made a mistake.\n\nAww. The loyalty!\n\nAnd, I have to love Hee Do’s entire attitude, about turning tragedies into comedies. Of everything that Hee Do’s ever said to Yi Jin, this is probably one of the most needful nuggets of wisdom.\n\nThe whole thing of Hee Do running away from the boy whom she’d umbrella’d into submission, and then getting picked up by Yi Jin in his fancy sports car, is so much fun.\n\nI love that Hee Do is so thrilled to discover that she’s so much faster, without the weights that she’s been wearing to and from school.\n\nAnd I love how she literally leaps into the car, when Yi Jin refuses to unlock it for her without an apology.\n\nI love even more, that in the end, Yi Jin admits that her sign, even though embarrassing, had succeeded in making him laugh – which means that ultimately, no apology is needed from Hee Do after all.\n\nALSO. I just love how delighted Hee Do is, at the rain, and how that is so contagious, that it puts Yi Jin in a good mood too, even though he’s literally getting his open-top car soaked in the rain.\n\nHee Do really is the sunshine in Yi Jin’s life, and I can see why he tells her, later in the episode, that she gives him hope.\n\nE4. I feel like this episode, we’re also starting to see the beginnings of hyperawareness between Yi Jin and Hee Do, though I’m not entirely sure if this translates into romantic feelings just yet.\n\nWe see a glimpse of it when Yi Jin drunkenly tells Hee Do that he’s happy to watch her up close (versus seeing their lives from a distance), but it’s much more apparent at the end of the episode.\n\nI think it’s super adorable, how Yi Jin shows up with banana milk for Hee Do, because he guesses that she’s doing night training, and wants to surprise her.\n\nAnd, I also think it’s cute how Hee Do invites him into the gym, and he starts asking all sort of questions about fencing – which spurs Hee Do to let him try on fencing gear.\n\nThe whole way Yi Jin watches Hee Do in such a studied manner, as she helps him with the finishing touches of his fencing gear, does look a lot like romantic hyperawareness, although we can’t be 100% sure of it just yet, at this point in our story.\n\nFor now, I can believe that Yi Jin himself isn’t sure what it is.\n\nAnd then there’s that beat, where Yi Jin manages to win by distracting Hee Do with that Full House bluff, and Hee Do seems to have a moment of hyperawareness of him, with her seeing him in a small bit of slo-mo glory.\n\nI personally think it’s too soon to say whether Hee Do is starting to feel stirrings of romantic interest in Yi Jin. Like with Yi Jin, I can believe that Hee Do herself doesn’t really know what this moment means either.\n\nI do, however, very much appreciate the honesty in their final conversation, this episode.\n\nHee Do: “See, I don’t get disappointed when my dreams don’t come true. I’m used to losing and failing.”\n\nYi Jin: “That’s called having mental fortitude. Everyone wants to be as strong-minded like you. They don’t want to be scared of losing and failing. Sometimes I wish I could take it from you. I think that explains why I miss you when I feel mentally weak.”\n\nOn that note, I just wanted to pause to say that while my subs say “I miss you,” the actual dialogue literally means “I want to see you.” So.. while the phrase 보고 싶어 (bogo sip-eo) is often translated as “I miss you” the literal meaning can be applied here as well, I think.\n\nIt makes sense to me, that when Yi Jin feels mentally weak or down, that he’d want to see Hee Do, because seeing her, in all her blithe can’t-get-me-down glory, is just the sort of thing to spur you on, isn’t it?\n\nYi Jin: “You are by far the most experienced fencer when it comes to losing. Those losses were blocks to build yourself stairs leading up. Think about it. Now you’ve got the highest staircase. Take your time to climb it and take whatever you want.”\n\nHee Do: “Why do you root for me? Even my mom doesn’t.”\n\nYi Jin: “Because you give me hope. And I want more for you.”\n\nIf I understand the dialogue correctly, I would translate Yi Jin’s last sentence as, “You make me hopeful. And that keeps making me greedy.”\n\nAlso, even though the whole lights-out vibe of the scene, with their conversation only lit by the dim light of the hit detector, leans atmospheric, it’s their earnest, wholesome attitudes towards each other, that really get me in the heart.\n\nI love that Yi Jin roots for Hee Do so earnestly, and I love that that gets to her. And I love that the act of rooting for her, gives him hope for himself too.\n\nI just love this idea that they are just two souls, spurring each other on to bigger, better and brighter things. It’s so pure. 🥰\n\nE5. I love that this episode, we revisit the conversation between Yi Jin and Hee Do at the gym, in the dark. I really like the added context.\n\nIn the last episode, I’d said that Yi Jin had said, “You make me hopeful. And that keeps making me greedy.”\n\nThis episode, we see that he goes on to add, “..the greed to want to do well too, myself.”\n\nI freaking love this idea, that seeing Hee Do work hard, makes Yi Jin want to work hard too, and seeing her accomplish something, makes him want to accomplish something too.\n\nNot only do I love this idea of them propelling each other forward towards bigger and brighter things, I also love this idea that Hee Do is the kind of person who naturally gets other people to do well.\n\nThis theme, of Yi Jin and Hee Do standing in solidarity with each other, runs through the entire episode, through all the various circumstances that we see them in, and I love it, so much.\n\nThe fact that Hee Do is spontaneously moved to present Yi Jin with the sword that he’d used earlier, says a lot about how much their bond means to her.\n\nE5. It moves me so much, that even though Yi Jin leaves so quickly that he doesn’t actually have time to pack everything properly, he still makes time to paint the inside of the sword handle blue, and label the handle, as a gift to Hee Do.\n\nAugh. Even during his own personal crisis, when his life is literally falling apart and changing before his eyes, he makes sure to congratulate Hee Do, and let her know that he knows she’s made it, and that he’s rooting for her.\n\nOof. My heart.\n\nE5. I find it so, so poignant, that through everything that they face, Hee Do and Yi Jin keep their focus on each other, to keep their spirits up and keep on keeping on.\n\nThe reveal, that Hee Do’s left a voice message for Yi Jin on his pager, and that he calls from a payphone, and regularly uses up all his change, so that he can listen to her encouraging words on repeat, is so heart-achey.\n\nMy heart goes out to him so much. It’s so clear that he’s suffering, and it’s also so clear, that Hee Do’s message to him is the only thing that’s making his days a little more bearable.\n\nI love that Yi Jin gets to see Hee Do’s face, because she places third in the competition and appears on TV. And I love that because of that, Yi Jin leaves a voice message for Hee Do too, on her pager.\n\nThat little scene of them both making a faucet sprinkler each, as they think about each other, is sweet, and it’s rather nice to see them share the screen, even if it’s clearly just a fantasy.\n\nHonestly, though, it’s the sight of Hee Do listening to Yi Jin’s message to her, and shedding a few tears, and then listening to his message on repeat, just like how he listens to her message on repeat, that really gets me in the heart.\n\nThis idea, that their words to each other mean so much; that their messages of encouragement are literally like a life-force of sorts, for the recipient, is something that I find really touching.\n\nAnd it’s such sweet relief, both to Hee Do and to me as well, to hear Yi Jin say that he’ll appear before her again, by the time Full House volume 15 comes out.\n\nThat promise is given in such a pure manner, and it’s received in, likewise, such a pure manner, that I’m just flailing about, at the idea of them reuniting soon.\n\nYes please, I’d like to see them actually together again, and soon.\n\nI don’t care about whether things turn romantic between them; I just dig their soul connection so much, that I just want them to be there for each other, through all the good times and the bad, to uphold and support each other, through it all. 🥲❤️\n\nE6. I’m so pleased the Yi Jin and Hee Do meet again this episode, and the drama of them managing to find each other in a crowd of protestors, is so great. I love it.\n\nI love the idea that when she sees Full House Volume 15, she knows to look around for him. I love that she spots him in the crowd, and I love that through all the shouts and chants, Yi Jin hears her voice, in the crowd.\n\nIt’s utterly moving and romantic – without it actually being romantic, if you know what I mean.\n\nHee Do and her relationship with her new boyfriend (cameo by Choi Tae Joon) is cringey and hilarious all at once, and I appreciate that Yi jin adapts himself to the situation so quickly.\n\nWhat I mean is, I do detect a note of disappointment in his face, when he realizes that Hee Do is seeing someone, but it doesn’t appear to get in the way of his connection with Hee Do.\n\nIt feels to me like he might have had some inclinations towards romance with Hee Do, but is not that fussed about shrugging them off, if that’s not something that’s possible.\n\nI like that this doesn’t seem to dilute his connection with Hee Do in the least, even though Protective Boyfriend does give Yi Jin a warning.\n\nThe moment Yi Jin appears with his red sports car, I had an inkling that there would be a narrative reason for it, and I honestly couldn’t love more, the reason that it turns out to be.\n\nOn a side note, I can’t help but notice how different Yu Rim’s reaction is, to seeing Yi Jin again, compared to Hee Do’s reaction. Hee Do was just happy and filled with wonder at seeing Yi Jin again, and in their conversations, there was no blame, only support and understanding.\n\nIn contrast, Yu Rim’s reaction is full of blame and anger, at how Yi Jin could have done that to her.\n\nThat’s a stark contrast, and I can’t help thinking that this is why Yi Jin’s bond with Hee Do is so strong, and this is why Yi Jin had missed Hee Do, and reached out to Hee Do, instead of Yu Rim.\n\nI love that when Yi Jin realizes that Hee Do’s stuck on the train and might miss the finals as a result, he rushes out there to get her, and make sure that she gets her chance at the finals.\n\nEven though, when Hee Do asks him who he’ll be rooting for, he tells her that he’ll root for Yu Rim, it’s so clear, from where we’re sitting, that the person he’s rooting for, is Hee Do.\n\nAlso, I love that this gives us a throwback to Hee Do’s first ride in Yi Jin’s car; it gives me all these warm feels, remembering all the meaningful bonding moments they’d spent together, before Yi Jin had moved away.\n\nI love that just like before, Yi Jin’s steadiness and ability to just home in on the important things, comes into play, and he’s able to take Hee Do from a state of anxious almost-panic, to being relaxed and at ease, in the moment.\n\nI like that, so much.\n\nI also love that they’re able to have some thoughtful, reflective conversation, even as Yi Jin rushes Hee Do to the finals.\n\nI like Yi Jin’s conviction, that even if he and Hee Do hadn’t known each other from before, that he’d have ended up driving her from the train station to the finals anyway. This earthy version of destiny feels nicely appealing, I have to say.\n\nIt’s so cool to me, that from their conversation in the car, where Yi Jin fake-interviews Hee Do, he’s able to provide such a perfect blurb of a report on camera, later,\n\n“Rather than planning to defeat Ko Yu Rim, she had a strong ambition to fence her way and promised to give her very best in the finals.”\n\nThat’s really exactly what Hee Do is about, even though she didn’t say it in exactly those words. The fact that Yi Jin understands her this well, gives me a great deal of gratification.\n\nE7. I find it so significant, that in her moment of victory, Hee Do’s gaze goes to Yi Jin, and not anyone else. I thought she might have looked to Coach Yang, perhaps, since Coach Yang was pivotal in getting Hee Do into the national team.\n\nBut no, Hee Do instinctively looks towards Yi Jin, and I do love that.\n\nI know that things aren’t romantic between them right now, so I’m not actually talking about that, specifically.\n\nI just love their bond so much, as label-free as it is.\n\nShe knows that he’s rooting for her, and that he’s deeply invested in her journey, and he knows that she knows, and there’s just something very moving to me, about that.\n\nThe silent, small smiles that they exchange, across that hall, while tears sheen in their eyes, feels so momentous to me. 🤩\n\nE8. This episode, we see Hee Do’s growing hyperawareness of Yi Jin, and for me, it’s quite thrilling, yet at the same time, sometimes a bit secondhand mortifying as well, heh. It’s those vicarious awkward teenage feels coming into play, y’know?\n\nWe see Hee Do’s hyperawareness of Yi Jin growing in degrees.\n\nFrom the way she can’t stop fixating on the voice recording between Yi Jin and Da Eun, to the way she gets all peeved at the couple stickers of Yi Jin and Min Young, to the way she goes out of her way to try to find out what each of them looks like, to the way she starts to feel self-conscious around Yi Jin, to the way she can’t help but say snarky things around Yi Jin, because she feels jealous, but doesn’t quite realize it.\n\nIt all feels so real and relatable, seriously.\n\nAt this point, with Yi Jin getting started in his career, and Hee Do still in high school, the distance between them does seem to be growing, even though they are only 4 years apart.\n\nIt’s hard for Hee Do to understand or empathize with Yi Jin’s work experiences, and I can also see why Hee Do would start to think that her interests are now childish, in comparison to what Yi Jin’s involved in now, being a reporter and all.\n\nSo far, it seems that it’s mainly Hee Do who’s starting to see Yi Jin in a different light.\n\nOn Yi Jin’s side of things, I think he still does see Hee Do the same way.\n\nAs in, I don’t think that this shift in his circumstances has caused him to look at Hee Do any differently. To him, she’s still a great friend and companion; someone who roots for him and is easy to get along with; someone who inspires him, just by being herself.\n\nBased on the experiences that he and Hee Do have shared, I can see why Yi Jin would feel comfortable enough with Hee Do, to engage in some level of skinship.\n\nLike the way he grabs her around the shoulders, when he wants ice cream, or the way he grabs her wrist, when he thinks they need to run, or the way he picks her up and carries her away from the sea of broken glass (squee, tho!).\n\nOr the way he leans in to clean ice cream off her face with his handkerchief, or the way he notices that she can’t reach the sweet and sour pork, and pushes the dish towards her, so that she can reach it.\n\nI completely see why this would discombobulate Hee Do and cause her to feel even more hyperaware of Yi Jin.\n\nAt the same time, I can see this being just a natural expression of Yi Jin’s affection for Hee Do. I do think that she’s special to him, though I don’t think Yi Jin actually has romance on his mind at the moment.\n\nPlus, with his family situation still heavy on his mind, I don’t think Yi Jin’s really in the space where he’s thinking about dating anyone, really.\n\nI did appreciate that beat, where we see Yi Jin visit a creditor, in an attempt to pay of at least part of his father’s debt.\n\nI’m so glad that the creditor ahjusshi speaks kindly to him, expresses regret at his past actions, and tells Yi Jin to be happy, instead of trying to keep that tragic promise from before.\n\nI hope that this will give Yi Jin a bit more peace of mind, so that he will feel less burdened, and more carefree.\n\nI also love the fact that Yi Jin moves back to his old room, because that places him in his old neighborhood, where Hee Do – and the rest of the gang, too, of course – is within easy reach. I like the idea of him having friends around him, rather than being alone in an apartment.\n\nE9. This episode, the primary source of secondhand mortification comes from Hee Do, cringing at the way she declares that she has to have Yi Jin – only to be told that he really isn’t Injeolmi.\n\nAck. How truly mortifying. 😝\n\nI can see why Hee Do would run away like that, after thrusting the rose him (though that was really funny, I have to admit), and I can also see why Hee Do would avoid him so studiously after.\n\nE9. Even though Show does call out Yi Jin later in the episode, for not keeping a proper distance between himself and his subject (which would be Hee Do), I really enjoyed the arc of him working on the documentary about her and Yu Rim.\n\nFor one thing, it creates a situation where Hee Do can’t avoid him the way she’s been doing, so studiously.\n\nNo matter how chagrined she is, at the thought of what she’s said to him, or how she feels about him, she has no choice but to face him, and that’s pretty great.\n\nI love that scene where Yi Jin confronts her in the gym, and asks her point-blank what’s going on, and why she’s avoiding him, and Hee Do blurts it all out in a bluster that grows more and more high-pitched, the more worked up she gets.\n\nHee Do: “I was humiliated, that was why.”\n\nYi Jin: “About what? What you said that day? You only said that because you mistook me for Injeolmi, who I am not. So what’s the problem? It wasn’t about me anyway.”\n\nHee Do: “Yes, it was. It was half about you. If Injeolmi had been someone else, I wouldn’t have said something that idiotic. It was because it was you that I said that. That’s why it was half about you.”\n\nYi Jin: “So? What was your plan? Were you planning to avoid me forever? Hoping we’d drift apart like this? What do you think of our relationship?”\n\nHee Do: “What do you think it is? Because of you, I’m so confused. I’m jealous of you. No. I like you. But I have an inferiority complex toward you. What does that sound like to you? You don’t know, do you? I don’t either.\n\nBut I ended up saying I had to have you. I must have lost my freaking mind. I want to crawl into a hole and die. My mind’s completely blank!\n\nI like being sure about things, but everything is unclear when I think about you. That’s why right now, I really hate you.”\n\nTee hee. It’s so adorably honest and confused and bemused, all at the same time, and I can’t help but feel even more fond of Hee Do, for being so endearingly genuine and vulnerable, even though the angst is killing her.\n\nI completely understand Yi Jin’s amused I-don’t-know-what-to-do-with-you face, in response to Hee Do’s confused babble of honest feelings.\n\nAt this point, it gives me a bit of a thrill, just to know that Hee Do inspires this kind of affectionate amused response in Yi Jin.\n\nI love that the thing that dissolves the awkwardness between them, is when Hee Do sees that Yi Jin needs a phone in a hurry to make his report, and acts quickly to offer him her house phone.\n\nIn this moment, all the awkwardness is gone, and all we see is the ease that’s typified their relationship for so long, and a genuine desire on Hee Do’s side, to be of help to Yi Jin.\n\nI do love that it’s a desire to help Yi Jin, that breaks down Hee Do’s self-consciousness.\n\nI also love how this seems to give Hee Do the courage she needs, to speak to the situation between them, and pronounce that there really isn’t an existing term that she can use, to describe their relationship.\n\nIt’s cute how she concludes that they can just come up with their own label, like cloud, rainbow or scissors. Haha. It kinda makes no sense, even though I get what she means.\n\nIt’s at about this point, where I feel like Yi Jin actually starts to put words to how he feels about his relationship with Hee Do.\n\nYi Jin: “Don’t avoid me like that again. I won’t forgive you.”\n\nHee Do: “I guess you hated it.”\n\nYi Jin: “The word “hate” doesn’t begin to describe it. You helped me get back on my feet numerous times. You should take on the responsibility.”\n\nAnd, just when I think Yi Jin’s going to say something more – Mom arrives back home, and tilts Yi Jin’s entire world, because he’d never realized that his boss at work, is actually Hee Do’s mom.\n\nHA. This is another case of secondhand mortification, though I have to admit, I’m more amused than actually mortified.\n\nAlthough Mom is mostly suspicious and businesslike, I do take Mom’s point, that Yi Jin being too close to Hee Do could prove troublesome, particularly if he worked in Sports.\n\nI was thinking about this, and I conclude that it really is true. It would actually be better in the long run, if Yi Jin worked in another area of news.\n\nAfter all, he can apply the same principles and learnings in areas other than sports, whereas Hee Do can’t actually move out of fencing, just to make things more palatable.\n\nI do think that if Yi Jin wants to protect his relationship with Hee Do in the long run, he ought to avoid working in Sports news.\n\nE9. I’m heartened to see Yi Jin pick Hee Do up in that princess carry when she hurts her ankle, to take her to see a doctor.\n\nNot only do I feel better about her getting her ankle looked at, I’m also glad for the alone time that she and Yi Jin get, while they’re in the car together.\n\nTheir conversation feels like a period of realization for Yi Jin, as we lead up to his final declaration at the end of the episode.\n\nThat he would’ve killed that sunbae, if Hee Do had really gotten hurt; that he feels sorry; that he should’ve been there with her.\n\nThat Hee Do always leads him to do what’s right, and leads him to a good place; that he’d done the right thing by interviewing the referee, because it had been for Hee Do – even though he should have done it for any other athlete.\n\nI love the innocent, pure, forthright tone of their conversation.\n\nHee Do: “That’s my definition of our relationship. Also known as a rainbow. Wait. You said it wasn’t a rainbow. You still haven’t said what it was if not a rainbow.”\n\nYi Jin: “Love. It’s love. I love you, Hee Do. I don’t need a rainbow.”\n\nI love that right there, in front of that rainbow – which kinda represents their relationship – he appears to come to the realization, right as he says it, that he loves Hee Do. Awww!\n\nThat is so sweet.\n\nI might be off on this, but right now, I don’t get an actively romantic vibe coming from Yi Jin, which some viewers might take issue with, but which I actually love.\n\nI love the idea that Yi Jin’s love for Hee Do doesn’t have to necessarily be romantic, in order to qualify as love. It’s bigger than that, and embraces all other types of love as well: platonic, familial, and the love between soulmates.\n\nI love the idea that, in this moment in time, he doesn’t need to know what kind of love it is, to conclude with certainty, that he loves Hee Do.\n\nBecause it’s true. Whatever form that love takes, he does love her, for sure. And I LOVE that. 🥰\n\nE10. I love that Hee Do’s response to Yi Jin’s statement, that he loves her, is full of wonder, and yet, also matter-of-fact, at the same time.\n\nShe’s full of wonder that someone is actually telling her that he loves her, and she’s matter of fact in the way that she answers.\n\nI love how clear-eyed and guileless she comes across, as she tells Yi Jin that her feelings for him aren’t that big. Guh. The combination of honesty and innocence is just so endearing, to me.\n\nI love that she doesn’t feel pressured to have similar feelings for Yi Jin, as I think many people might, in her shoes, particularly since she’s so new to the concept of love, that she’s still trying to figure out what it means.\n\nI love how, instead, she chooses to simply be honest. She’s honest about the wonder that she feels at his declaration, and she’s honest about her feelings for him not quite being the same as his feelings for her.\n\nAnd how absolutely wonderful, is Yi Jin’s response, that his feelings for her, have nothing to do with her feelings for him, and that he just likes her for who she is, and he’s content that him telling her how he feels about her, makes her a little happier.\n\nGah. That is the sweetest thing evar, and my heart is flailing in a heap, at just how sweet Yi Jin is.\n\nThat moment after, as they both smile contentedly side by side on the bridge, each soaking in their own feels, feels so precious and pure. Guh. I love it, so much. ❤️\n\nE10. From about the point where Hee Do joins Yi Jin on the beach, it feels like Hee Do’s suddenly growing very hyperaware of Yi Jin, in a way that she finds sudden and surprising.\n\nThe way Show has Yi Jin and Hee Do whispering to each other, out of necessity, because Yi Jin’s recording, is very clever and effective. I love how organic this situation of hyper-proximity comes about; it doesn’t feel manufactured at all.\n\nAnd, it makes a lot of sense to me, that being in such close proximity to Yi Jin, would make Hee Do experience the first tingles of hyper-awareness of him.\n\nWhat I appreciate about this scene, is that Yi Jin still gives off that matter-of-fact vibe, even when leaning in close to whisper in Hee Do’s ear.\n\nTo my eyes, it doesn’t feel at all like Yi Jin’s trying to take the opportunity to get closer to Hee Do, and I really like that.\n\nIf anything, it feels like Hee Do’s the one who’s feeling more in this situation than Yi Jin, and I really like how subtly this is brought across to us. It’s in Hee Do’s gaze, and the slight pause she takes to catch her breath, after Yi Jin whispers in her ear, that they should go get a drink.\n\nAnd it’s in her muttered remark in response, “Suddenly..?” (My subs say “My goodness,” but I feel that “suddenly” is a more accurate translation.) It’s subtle, but it’s there, and I like it.\n\nE11. I like that we see Hee Do talking so openly and matter-of-factly with Yi Jin, about her father, and her memories of him, as they play a stacking game with those shells. It makes even the delicate topic of her father’s death feel so down-to-earth.\n\nI really like the idea that talking about such things is, all in all, pretty normal for them; normal enough, that they’d be able to play a shell-stacking game, and flick each other’s foreheads, while talking about it. That makes me feel the strength of their bond.\n\nI also love the detail, that looking at the photos on the wall, makes Hee Do smile so much.\n\nYi Jin’s really brought her a lot of joy, and many memories, in organizing this trip. It’s so telling, that Hee Do would want that solo photo of Yi Jin, along with the group ones.\n\nAnd, I love the mirror effect that we get, at the end of the episode, when we see Yi Jin smiling at the same wall of photos, and then putting down his name for Hee Do’s solo photo, which she hadn’t even picked for herself.\n\nAhhh. That’s so reciprocal, and so sweet. I love it.\n\nE11. I have to love how Yi Jin is immediately concerned, the moment he sees Hee Do in tears, looking for the chairs that she thinks Mom has thrown out.\n\nI also love that beat, where Yi Jin is sobered by the realization that while Mom’s success has inspired him to do better, that success actually is tied up with Hee Do’s wounds.\n\nAnd in response, Hee Do doesn’t get upset, but is simply surprised, and considers with a bit of wonder, that the thing that had caused her emotional wounds, have actually managed to inspire Yi Jin.\n\nI LOVE how she says, with her eyes still puffy from crying, that that in itself is kinda nice. Aw. She’s so pure. I love her.\n\nThe thing is, though, I find myself feeling a niggling sense of foreboding, almost, as I watch Yi Jin and Hee Do spend time together, this episode.\n\nIt’s basically from the point at which he tells Hee Do that he’s now officially a Sports reporter, and is introducing himself to a promising fencing athlete.\n\nI know he says this in jest, and I know it doesn’t yet affect their relationship, but I can’t help but think that it will become a factor between them, and not too far in the future, either.\n\nThat thought makes all their present interactions, which are so carefree, pure and guileless, feel extra precious, because.. I can’t help thinking that something’s going to happen soon, that will soon make their interactions more guarded and careful. Sobs. 😩\n\nGah. I’m already wishing that Yi Jin had applied to be a reporter with some other department other than Sports. Hee Do’s mom had made a great point, when she’d told Yi Jin to stay away from Sports reporting. I wish he’d listened to her, and acted accordingly.\n\nE11. A big highlight for me, this episode, is how Yi Jin steals Hee Do and Yu Rim away, and takes them to Ji Woong’s concert. How great, that Yu Rim gets to attend the concert after all.\n\nAnd how awesome, that Yi Jin gets roped in to play guitar, during the encore. Gosh, I think I liked this more than watching Ji Woong’s performance.\n\nIt really is like Yi Jin’s reclaiming his high school innocence, a little bit, as he plays in the band, and then does that reading for Hee Do, in the broadcasting room.\n\nI totally get what Hee Do means, when she introduces herself to Yi Jin, and asks him to play with her. For once, it feels like she’s meeting the unburdened, youthful Yi Jin, at the point when he’s yet untainted by the grown-up worries of the world.\n\nE12. I did love the moment, though, when Yi Jin first hears Hee Do speak in French, and is stunned speechless. SHO CUTE! 🤩\n\nI love how Hee Do treats it like it’s no big deal, and just skips off, telling Yi Jin that she’s starving. Ahaha. I love how she’s got her priorities so firmly in place.\n\nThe attachment between Yi Jin and Hee Do is growing on both sides, which makes my earlier concern feel more relevant than ever.\n\nHee Do’s wistfulness at saying goodbye for Yi Jin, for the night, and her excuse that she needs to buy milk for Yu Rim, tells us how attached she’s getting, to Yi Jin.\n\nAnd Yi Jin’s fiery response to Hee Do’s ex-boyfriend, when Ex tests the waters, and tells Yi Jin that he can’t forget about Hee Do, tells us a lot about how strong Yi Jin’s feelings are, for Hee Do.\n\nThis is the moment where my heart can’t decide where to squee at how unbridled Yi Jin’s protectiveness is, around Hee Do, or worry that Yi Jin’s expressed feelings are going to become a stumbling block, both to his career, and to their relationship. 🙈\n\nNow that Hee Do’s heard it, though, I can see how her feelings for Yi Jin would be stirred even further.\n\nWhich is why it feels completely organic to me, that she would kiss Yi Jin, in our closing scene.\n\nWith the question of whether the world would end, once the year 2000 came around, and with just moments before that might occur, I completely understand why Hee Do would want to take her chances, and use her possible last moments, to kiss Yi Jin.\n\nThe kiss is sweet and innocent, and if I weren’t so concerned about how this would affect the future of their relationship, given the obvious conflict of interest on the professional side of things, I’d be melting a lot more, over this kiss.\n\nE13. One of the things that strikes me, this episode, is how openly Hee Do wears her heart on her sleeve, around Yi Jin. She’s so disarmingly frank, each time her feelings for him come up.\n\nLike, in the immediate aftermath of the kiss, when Yi Jin’s just staring at her, coz he’s so taken off-guard.\n\nShe doesn’t pretend that it didn’t happen, or that it had been a crazy mistake brought on by being on the cusp of the potential end of the world.\n\nThere’s none of that. Instead, she looks him right in the eye, and even with her gaze and her voice wavering just a touch, likely due to uncertainty, she tells him that it wasn’t a mistake.\n\nGuh. I love that she’s so honest, and doesn’t choose to make excuses, even when it would be easy and convenient to do so. How can I not love her? 😍\n\nPlus, the way she fixates on Yi Jin, and gets so distracted by thoughts of him, after the kiss, is so relatable. Ahhh. It really brings back the feels of what it’s like to be young and falling in love for the first time, and getting distracted by a boy for the first time. 😅\n\nE13. Augh. This episode was made up of so much angst – but it’s the type of angst that’s tortured, and full of heartfelt tension, and that’s underscored with notes of sweetness and longing. It was hard to watch, and yet I couldn’t get enough, if that makes sense.\n\nThat beat, where Hee Do gets cornered into calling Yi Jin, then crumples in chagrin, when the conversation turns out to be awkward, feels so real.\n\nAnd the barely-there tears in Hee Do’s eyes, make her feelings pop, all the more.\n\nShe doesn’t have to say anything, for me to know that her heart and mind are overcrowded with thoughts of Yi Jin, and that she feels it all, very acutely.\n\nOver on Yi Jin’s side of things, I can appreciate how stuck he feels, between his feelings for Hee Do, and his professional obligation, to keep an appropriate distance from her.\n\nCoach Yang telling Yi Jin all about what had happened between her and Hee Do’s mom, really colors it in so vividly, both for Yi Jin, and for us as viewers.\n\nFor one thing, it finally becomes clear why there is so much hurt and emotional baggage between Coach Yang and Mom.\n\nThere had been a very genuine friendship between them, before Mom’s professional obligations kicked in at a particularly unfortunate time for Coach Yang, who had been clueless about the inappropriateness of her conduct.\n\nGosh, no wonder there’s so much hurt hanging in the air between them, even now.\n\nAnd, how vividly poignant, that we – and most importantly Yi Jin! – can now easily imagine what might happen between Yi Jin and Hee Do, going forward.\n\nThis would have been true, even without the romantic element, since Yi Jin and Hee Do have been close for so long, and have loved each other, in their own ways, and been involved in each other’s lives, for so long.\n\nIt’s just now extra complicated, because they’ve developed romantic feelings for each other.\n\nAt the same time, it’s not like Yi Jin can easily get himself out of the sports desk, or get himself a different job, in the difficult economic climate of our story. He needs this paycheck, and can’t afford to lose it.\n\nBut he also loves Hee Do, and doesn’t want to lose her.\n\nPoor Yi Jin. I can totally see why he gets into such a depressed funk this episode, getting drunk every night, and generally looking like he hasn’t slept in years, with the way the dark circles under his eyes look like they’re multiplying into their second and third generations.\n\nWhat a conundrum we have, between our would-be lovebirds.\n\nYi Jin, so torn between his head and his heart, confronted so regularly by Hee Do, waiting outside his door, with her heart on her sleeve. Oh, what’s a boy to do?\n\nI didn’t know whether to laugh to cry, at that moment when Yi Jin instinctively stuffs those buns in his mouth, when he thinks Hee Do’s leaning in to kiss him again.\n\nAhaha. So much awkward. So much cringe. Eep. 🙈😅\n\nIt’s easy for me to say that Yi Jin should just come out and tell Hee Do what’s going on with him, but I suppose Yi Jin isn’t so sure yet, what to do about the situation, and whether it would ever be ok for him to love Hee Do openly.\n\nAfter all, he IS very young, and still very much a rookie at work. He has no idea whether he’ll be stuck at the sports desk forever, or if he’ll ever have another option, work-wise.\n\nI can see why he’d feel like he needed to back away from the situation, before he made things worse.\n\nThat wrong number drunken call that Yi Jin makes, which ends up going to Ji Woong, where he says that his heart is wavering, and that he wants his heart to waver, is so poignant.\n\nAhh. Finally, he’s saying how he feels, out loud, and even though he’s saying that he and Hee Do can’t have that kind of relationship, it still feels precious, that he articulates how he feels about her.\n\nE13. One of my favorite scenes this episode, is when Yi Jin observes Hee Do in the rest area outside the stadium, as she just goes about doing her thing.\n\nHee Do really is lovely, from the way she responds to that snarky athlete with good cheer and kindness, to the way she earnestly reflects on her matches for the day, and the way she is just generally so genial to everyone.\n\nI can totally see why Yi Jin wears that gentle, affectionate, smitten gaze, as he looks upon her loveliness. I can feel his heart swelling with appreciation, affection and pride, in that moment.\n\nOf course, the way Yi Jin gets all up in twist over Hee Do addressing someone else as “Oppa” when he’s just “Baek Yi Jin” is very amusing.\n\nThe way his attempt at a petty vengeful note has him sprawling on the stairs trying to hide from Hee Do, is just hilarious. 😂\n\nI can feel Yi Jin’s conflict wearing him down this entire episode, and so, by the end of the episode, when he tells Hee Do that they should try putting some distance between them, I can feel like he’s exhausted.\n\nBut it’s precisely because he’s exhausted, that I can totally see why he’d give in to his heart, and just go out there, and grab Hee Do for a kiss.\n\nThe way I see it, he’s been fighting himself for so long, that he’s worn out. And now, when he’s too tired to fight anymore, his heart – which still beats for Hee Do – is the one with more strength, to drive his decision.\n\nI don’t know what’s going to happen next, for Yi Jin and Hee Do, but dang, I really do feel a sense of vicarious release, with Yi Jin finally giving in to his heart like this.\n\nThe way he takes that cap off her and grabs her face in one fluid motion, and plants his lips on hers; the way he basically drinks her in and inhales her presence; the way he looks at her and tells her, raggedly,\n\n“You drive me crazy (Could also be translated as “This is crazy”). Fine. Let’s try this kind of love, Na Hee Do. I’m going to do everything I can with you. So prepare yourself.”\n\nIt’s all very heady and swoony, and I can’t help but want to sink into the romance of it all, while shooing away the cautionary thoughts coming from the more rational corner of my brain, that says that this, between a sports reporter and the athlete he covers, is highly inappropriate.\n\nWe’ll worry about that.. later. 🙈\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nBona as Yu Rim\n\nI’d last seen Bona in Girls’ Generation 1979, and liked her there, and I feel that she’s very well cast, as Yu Rim.\n\nThere’s a refined elegance about Bona, that’s threaded through with touches of fragility, and I feel like that works so well, for Yu Rim as a character.\n\nI actually liked Yu Rim right away, from the moment she’s introduced to us in episode 1.\n\nI liked that she’s focused and disciplined, and beyond that, I was intrigued by and drawn to the lashings of vulnerability and loneliness, which peek through her otherwise earnestly stoic surface.\n\nEven though Yu Rim says and does some rather unpleasant things at various points in our story, I never found her hateful, which, I feel, is credit to both the writing, and Bona’s delivery.\n\nOverall, I’d say it was very gratifying to witness Yu Rim’s journey of growth over the course of our story.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE2. For the record, I don’t dislike Yu Rim, even though she says some mean things this episode.\n\nI think Show does a solid job of showing us clues, that help us identify what’s going on with Yu Rim, underneath that prickly surface.\n\nLike that way she hesitates at the sight of her own shabby shoes, when Coach Yang casually mentions that the shoes she’d gotten off Hee Do, are branded.\n\nIt’s not hard to see that Yu Rim’s acting out of insecurity, and her default way of doing that, appears to be pushing away the source of that insecurity; in this case, Hee Do.\n\nAdditionally, Yu Rim’s under a great deal of pressure, as a gold medalist, who’s in the spotlight, and under the eye of the entire nation.\n\nThere’s a great deal that Yu Rim must feel she needs to live up to, and I’m sure she doesn’t feel like she’s quite the living legend that everyone thinks she is. So that pressure to live up to an image must also be weighing on her.\n\nOn top of that is the fact that, with Yu Jin’s family going bankrupt, she’s lost her key sponsor, and therefore has financial worries, on top of everything else.\n\nE8. Aw, I feel really bad for Yu Rim and her family situation, this episode.\n\nPoor Mom (Hur Ji Na). She must feel so lost.\n\nShe didn’t just get cheated of a chunk of money, since it sounds like the people who ran off, had been in charge of some savings collective for the neighbors. It sounds like she’s also now inherited their debt, since she’d signed surety for them, when they’d bought new machinery.\n\nGosh, that’s terrible. I can see why Yu Rim would feel so lost, too. She can’t do anything to help Mom, and she herself has fencing and school expenses that her stipend doesn’t quite cover.\n\nIt’s so poignant to realize that Yu Rim actually has a habit of crying alone at the indoor pool, where she dives in so that her tears are disguised by the pool water. Aw.\n\nI’m actually kind of glad that Hee Do sees this, because I’d really like things to become more cordial between Hee Do and Yu Rim, and an awareness of each other’s contexts, is the best place to start.\n\nE9. I’m really glad that Yu Rim’s conversation with Hee Do leads her to see her mom’s gift of a mobile phone, in a whole new light.\n\nI mean, Yu Rim’s not wrong to say that they’re tight for money, and therefore it would be wiser to return the phone, so that they don’t incur unnecessary expenses.\n\nBut, it’s also great that Yu Rim comes to realize that emotional wellbeing is so important in life as well, and I’m glad she puts that learning to work right away, by telling Mom that she really did want a mobile phone, and that she really likes the gift Mom gave her. Aw.\n\nThe tearful joy and comfort in Mom’s eyes, as she smiles in response, is so lovely. I really like Mom, and I want her to be happy.\n\nE10. I also appreciate the spotlight that Show shines on Yu Rim’s situation, where her parents buy her gifts that they clearly can’t afford. That’s a difficult one.\n\nYu Rim’s aware enough of the situation, to know how impractical these gifts are. And yet, her parents both want so earnestly to give her the best that they can give, while hoping so much, to see her smile and be happy, while receiving those gifts.\n\nIt’s a difficult position to be in, because, as Yu Rim’s found out the hard way, trying to do the practical thing, to help her parents save money, only hurts their feelings.\n\nAnd yet, if she simply smiles and accepts the gifts, the weight of her family situation just bears down on her all the more.\n\nE14. Things fall apart for Yu Rim so suddenly, that it feels as if her entire life is changed in an instant.\n\nI mean, I’m super relieved that Dad (Kim Dong Gyun) doesn’t die – Show really had me going there, for a bit – but the relief is short-lived, because the fallout of the accident comes so swiftly.\n\nIt feels like Yu Rim’s entire world comes crumbling down in that hospital hallway, as she realizes that her family’s struggles have just amplified exponentially.\n\nHonestly, it feels like Yu Rim makes the most practical choice for herself and her family, given the situation. There’s just so much financial and therefore mental and emotional strain on her parents, because of the accident, but also, because of their other debts.\n\nIf her changing her citizenship to play for another country could solve all of those troubles in one fell swoop, it’s hard to imagine her making a different decision, really.\n\nI’m glad that Yu Rim reaches out to Coach Yang for help, and I’m glad that Coach Yang is there for her, every step of the way.\n\nIn a situation where the rest of the country is quick to judge, and quick to feel betrayed, it feels needful, that Yu Rim has someone like Coach Yang in her corner; ready to help in practical ways, and without judgment as well.\n\nAnd that judgment proves to be so real, so quickly, this episode.\n\nIt really makes my heart go out to Yu Rim, in a big way. 😭\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nChoi Hyun Wook as Ji Woong\n\nI have to confess that it was only after finishing my watch, and writing this review, that I stumbled upon the fact that Choi Hyun Wook was also in Racket Boys, which I also very much enjoyed.\n\nThis legit blew my mind, because his character in Racket Boys, is so different from Ji Woong, that I couldn’t fathom that they were played by the same actor, even though both characters literally have the same face. 😅\n\nKudos to Choi Hyun Wook, for disappearing into both characters, so well!\n\nI have more to say about Ji Woong in the next section, but for now, I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed Ji Woong as a character.\n\nHis forthright, carefree personality was very endearing to me, and I just loved that underneath his swag, he’s a sweet, sincere, loyal marshmallow. ❤️\n\nYu Rim and Ji Woong together\n\nI have to admit, I wasn’t expecting a great deal to come out of Ji Woong’s crush on Yu Rim.\n\nI just rooted for this would-be couple, purely based on my affection for Ji Woong, because I just loved how he’s so unabashed about his crush on Yu Rim, and is so quick to jump on opportunities to talk to her, or look cool in front of her.\n\nI found it all very endearing, and couldn’t help but want him to succeed, in wooing his crush.\n\nSo color me happily surprised, to find that this little loveline turned out to be so heartfelt and sweet, in the end. ❤️\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE3. That whole thing where Ji Woong throws his history book at Hee Do, so that he can be punished alongside Yu Rim, is really quite endearing.\n\nAnd the way he asks the teacher to allow them to stand, because Yu Rim’s ankle injury is making it hard for her to kneel, is thoughtful and quite cute too.\n\nE4. I like the developing mutual awareness between Ji Woong and Yu Rim.\n\nJi Woong’s adorably upfront about the fact that he likes Yu Rim, and he definitely manages to make Yu Rim’s heart flutter a bit, with his cheesy-yet-serious lines, like how he was joking about not liking her that much.\n\nPfft. Boy’s got some moves, and those moves are actually making him some headway with Yu Rim.\n\nPlus, they also look like they had fun, dealing with the rain together, and giggling over how silly they both look.\n\nI do think they’d make a pretty cute couple.\n\nE7. Ji Woong is turning out to be quite the sweet and swoony suitor.\n\nThe way he gives that chocolate gold medal, and tells her not to be too down because she’s been a gold medalist since she was born, is just the most earnest, melty thing.\n\nHow could Yu Rim’s heart not wobble in the face of this earnest adoration? Even my heart’s wobbling vicariously, while watching. 😍😁\n\nE8. I’m glad for Yu Rim, that Ji Woong’s there to offer companionship and a listening ear, when she’s down.\n\nAnd of course, his heart-eyes for Yu Rim have gotta count for something. Who wouldn’t be flattered, to have Ji Woong putting them on a pedestal, and saying such cute and sweet things to them, on a regular basis?\n\nE10. Aw. I’m glad that Yu Rim reaches out to Ji Woong, like she’d promised previously, for a listening ear.\n\nJust like Dad with Yi Jin, Ji Woong can’t offer Yu Rim any real solutions, but again, just having someone to listen and understand, and express that understanding, along with some empathy, can really go a long way towards helping us cope.\n\nJi Woong asking Yu Rim for permission to confess his feelings, is so cute. I kinda love how cautious he is, to ask permission even to express how he feels about her.\n\nI mean, sure, it could come from a place of insecurity, but I prefer to think of it as him being extra respectful of Yu Rim’s preferences.\n\nE14. I really love Ji Woong’s response, when Yu Rim finally talks with him about her decision.\n\nIt’s a world-tilting decision for him for sure, particularly since he’s dating Yu Rim, and yet, he only tells her that it must have been a difficult decision to make, and that she’s cool and awesome, for making it.\n\nAw. Ji Woong’s a sweetheart.\n\nHonestly, from a practical standpoint, Yu Rim’s request, that she and Ji Woong not make any promises to each other that they can’t keep, is a reasonable albeit upsetting one.\n\nThe way Yu Rim lays everything out, and tells Ji Woong that she doesn’t know when she’ll be able to come back to Korea, or if she’d be able to come back at all, is heartbreakingly mature.\n\nThe fact that she doesn’t want Ji Woong to live just for her, is also heartbreakingly mature.\n\nIt makes me think of all that Yu Rim’s been through, to be able to look at things with such perspective, at her young age.\n\nAt the same time, I so appreciate Ji Woong’s passion, to not just give up on their relationship without even trying.\n\nI love the way Ji Woong rushes to the airport, when he hears from Seung Wan that Yu Rim’s leaving.\n\nGosh, the way he just tosses his skateboard aside and guttural-yeeellls her name, is so viscerally startling and moving, at the same time. There is so much youthful passion here, that I feel like it’s about to burst out of my screen and knock me right over.\n\nThe way Ji Woong informs Yu Rim that he’s going to be the selfish one now, and then gives her this spiel, is really so breathlessly melty:\n\n“I will wait for you, come to visit you, and I’ll endure no matter what. I won’t go out with anyone else. I’m not even going to look at anyone. So you shouldn’t see anyone else either. Don’t even make eye contact..\n\nEven if all you can give me is misery, I’m up for it. I’m fine as long as we’re in it together.”\n\nAhhh. It’s so moving, and I’m so, SO glad that Ji Woong gets to kiss his girl, before she gets on that plane.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nLee Joo Myoung as Seung Wan\n\nGiven how Seung Wan’s introduced as something of a secondary character, I am very pleasantly surprised by how awesome she turns out to be, and how much I love her.\n\nLee Joo Myoung plays Seung Wan with a droll sort of sensibility that I think fits Seung Wan perfectly, as a character, and I often found her deadpan sense of humor really funny.\n\nI loved Seung Wan not just because she’s smart; she’s passionate and opinionated, and not afraid to stand up for what she believes in.\n\nIn short, she’s a rock star. 🤩\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE3. I have to admit, I got a good amount of satisfaction from Seung Wan’s horrified realization that the tenant whom she’s been highhanded and short with, is none other than the very well-known, highly regarded Baek Yi Jin sunbae. Muahaha.\n\nThat was pretty funny.\n\nE10. This episode, I’m starting to see Seung Wan in a whole new light.\n\nThe thing that strikes me most, is how I love her extra, when she’s hosting her radio show.\n\nThe way she speaks is so full of heart and passion, and you can just tell that she’s spent a lot of time thinking about these things.\n\nIt makes me think that she’s made for greatness; that she really will end up changing the world.\n\nE12. Seung Wan’s decision to quit school is such an epic moment, in our story.\n\nThe school violence thing is something that we’ve seen simmering in Seung Wan for quite a while, so it’s not exactly shocking, when she ends up speaking up for Ji Woong, in Abusive Teacher’s face, and even calling the police, when he dares her to.\n\nIn that moment, I was so in awe of Seung Wan, for standing up for what she believes in, without showing any fear, even though it does feel like a scary situation from where I’m sitting.\n\nIt’s horrible that the police are actually on Abusive Teacher’s side, and that they say they can’t do anything, because even though corporal punishment is prohibited in schools, it’s the school that has the authority to manage that, not the police. Dang.\n\nI can literally feel Seung Wan’s frustration building, so when Abusive Teacher gives her that ultimatum, to either apologize publicly and promise not to broadcast anything on her radio channel ever again, or face expulsion, I’m not actually surprised that she chooses to leave school.\n\nIt’s still a huge decision, however, and I found myself catching my breath a little, at how decisive Seung Wan is about this, even though I kind of saw it coming.\n\nShe is so clear on her principles, her values, and her beliefs. And she’s willing to stand by them, even at the cost of dropping out of school.\n\nSeung Wan’s a rock star and a legend, and I am in awe of her.\n\nI also have every confidence that she’s going to go on to do amazing things with her life. And, even though she loses a year because she’s dropping out like this, I know she’s going to do great, at the GED and CSAT, when she gets to it.\n\nAnd, the price that she’s paid, in terms of losing an academic year, will reap much more intangible value, in the area of her character, I feel.\n\nI love that Seung Wan refuses to put a price on her character, and I have positive hope that her determination to stand by her values, will be the thing that enables her to change the world. 🤩\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nYu Rim and Hee Do together\n\nFrom the get-go in episode 1, I was really curious to see how Hee Do would get on with her fencing idol, Yu Rim, now that she’s finally in the same orbit as her.\n\nAnd whaddya know, this turned out to one of the most gripping relationships, in this drama world, for me.\n\nWithout giving too much away, let me just say that I loved the evolution of the connection between Hee Do and Yu Rim.\n\nThe way Show portrays all the various facets of this relationship, feels so honest and raw, that I found myself wholeheartedly invested in this relationship.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE2. The way Hee Do’s wide-eyed happy reverie, at the idea of becoming part of Yu Rim’s orbit, comes crashing down in the face of Yu Rim’s cold, distant sort of attitude, is so relatable.\n\nI felt like I could practically hear Hee Do’s heart come crashing down to the floor, when Yu Rim first gives her that cold put-down, about her being a nobody.\n\nE2. And, what an interesting nugget of information, that Yu Rim does know Hee Do’s name after all; that Hee Do had once beaten her at a competition, when she’d been at the height of being known as a fencing prodigy.\n\nI’d hazard a guess that this is also playing into Yu Rim’s decision to keep Hee Do at a distance. She’s definitely got some emotional baggage around this memory.\n\nI do love that Hee Do makes it a point to tell Yu Rim that it was an honor to spar against her, even though she knows that Yu Rim is unlikely to welcome the interaction.\n\nAnd, I love that when Yu Rim questions Hee Do on why Hee Do likes her in the first place, Hee Do’s ready with a string of reasons that are clearly well thought-through conclusions of a longtime fan, rather than a bunch of things that she just plucked out of the air, in the moment.\n\nI so love that when Yu Rim tells Hee Do that she’s wrong, Hee Do flat-out tells Yu Rim that she’s basically talking nonsense, because what does she know about Hee Do’s feelings? HA. I love that.\n\nAlso, how essentially kind of Hee Do, to point Yu Rim back to her ankle injury, and tell her to take care of herself instead. Even in the face of Yu Rim’s cold put-downs, Hee Do doesn’t resort to maliciousness.\n\nI’ve said it about a million times already by this point, but really, I love her. 🤩\n\nE3. I kinda love that the sight of Hee Do training so hard, indirectly spurs Yu Rim to put in more training time as well. This detail, that Hee Do is inadvertently inspiring her own fencing idol, is quite gratifying to me.\n\nAnd, when Annoying Sunbae comes"
