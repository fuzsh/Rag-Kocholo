        "text": "A 17-year-old’s perception of her father is forever altered on a three-day backpacking trip in India Donaldson’s excellent debut “ Good One,\" in theaters Friday.\n\nSomething happens. And then something doesn’t happen. But that’s more of the tear point on the already delicate fabric of a relationship that has been deteriorating from neglect for years.\n\nThe trip to the Catskills was envisioned as a joint family trip. Chris (James Le Gros) and his daughter Sam (newcomer Lily Collias) planned to go with Chris’s old friend Matt (Danny McCarthy) and his teenage son. But when they pull up to Matt’s place, there’s an argument taking place between the father and son, who retreats to the apartment as Matt stomps to Chris’s car. The teenage son is no longer joining them.\n\nDonaldson focuses her camera on Sam, whose face and deeply expressive eyes tell you everything you need to know: This is weird and it doesn’t feel right. Suddenly she’s on a boys trip with a pair of sad middle aged men who have known one another for decades and whose lives haven’t worked out the way they thought. Both are divorced. Chris has moved on and has a new baby. Matt is still in the early stages of having his life upended. And, boy, do they talk about their failed relationships, one of whom is obviously Sam’s mother. “I couldn’t make her happy.” “She was the one who started doing things first.” “I didn’t want to get divorced.”\n\nSam rolls her eyes a lot of the time; Other times she responds insightfully. The guys seem to half hear her, but also not. They long ago decided on their own narrative, their victimhood, and Sam is not going to change that with a bit of innocent truth.\n\nAre they always this honest with their disappointments, failures and shortcomings around their kids, you wonder? Or is this a new thing happening on this trip? Chris, in particular, has forgotten that Sam, as worldly and wise as she seems, is still ultimately just a kid. You sense that Sam has already started to realize that her father is as flawed as anyone; but on this trip, his full self is on display.\n\nAll of the acting is terrific and so naturalistic that it’s easy to forget that these are actors performing lines that they’ve memorized in front of a camera. Le Gros as the fastidious super camper, who freaks out about his daughter’s safety from bears when he discovers that Matt was eating in his tent, but does little later on; And McCarthy as a failed actor and now failed husband who can be charming and fun but is mostly annoying and gross. But the real breakout is Collias. Her face and presence, empathetic and knowing, carries the whole film in an unforgettable depiction of modern girlhood with all of the dreaminess, awkwardness and boredom.\n\nDonaldson, like Kelly Reichardt, has a keen eye for the smallest of details; A reaction, a wince, even a blank expression that says everything. She also knows when to turn away from the dialogue and the people and give the audience a nature break. One of many great decisions was to have Sam on her period during the trip, something she deals with silently behind trees and bushes as the guys wait impatiently.\n\nAt one point the guys are dreaming about what they’d do differently if they had a second chance at life. Matt would be a philosopher. Chris would own a bookstore. What about Sam, they ask. She responds that hopefully she still has a shot at deciding on this life. Indeed.\n\nThese stakes might seem comparatively small in a movie landscape of deadly tornadoes, apocalypses and multiverses colliding. But that’s what makes it so special. It is humanity, with all of its beauties and disappointments, as most of us experience it. And it’s one that will likely stay with you for some time.\n\n“Good One,” a Metrograph pictures release in limited theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for “language.” Running time: 90 minutes. Four stars out of four.\n\nLindsey Bahr, The Associated Press"
