(3.7.10)\n\nroman candle & from a basement on the hill join kill rock stars' catalog & xmas gifts\n\nthank you to maggie for sending us this huge news about roman candle (remastered and on vinyl in the u.s. for the first time) and from a basement on the hill joining their catalog! here is the press release about the news plus a free and rare download of \"cecilia/amanda\"!\n\n\"Kill Rock Stars is very excited to announce that on April 6th, 2010 we will be adding Elliott Smith’s Roman Candle and From a Basement on the Hill records to our catalog.\n\nRoman Candle is Elliott Smith’s first solo album and was originally released on Portland’s Cavity Search Records in 1994.\n\nRoman Candle had quite an impact on Slim Moon, Kill Rock Stars' founder: \"In 1994, I had been asked to be on this five-person solo-act tour called Pop Chord with Tammy Watson, Carrie Akre, Sean Croghan and Elliott Smith. The first night at the Crocodile in Seattle, I didn't pay too much attention and people talked all thru Elliott's set. Sean Croghan got up next and said \"all of you people who just talked through Elliott's set are bummed because you just misssed something very very special.\" The next night of the tour, at The Bottom Of The Hill in San Francisco, I listened very closely to Elliott's set, and it was basically one of those life-changing moments. Instead of watching the rest of the performers, I went out to the tour van and popped Roman Candle into the player, and listened to it on endless repeat for the rest of the evening and beyond. It completely blew my mind. I have never heard music as heartwrenchingly, gut-checkingly honest, intimate, and wise - before or since.\"\n\nRoman Candle has been remastered for the re-release by Larry Crane, editor of Tape Op Magazine and archivist for Elliott's family.\n\nLarry explains, “The intention that I had was to make the album more listenable. I felt that a lot of the guitar “squeaks” were jarring and very loud, and that many of the hard consonants and “S” sounds were jarring and scratchy sounding. I felt by reducing these noises that the music would become more inviting and the sound would serve the songs better. When I went to Roger Seibel's SAE Mastering, he proceeded to equalize the tracks a small amount and to make the volume slightly louder. We never tried to make this CD as loud as current, over-limited trends, but just to match the volume of the rest of Elliott’s KRS catalog in a graceful way. Please note that none of this album is “remixed” from the master tapes - it is still composed of the mixes Elliott created himself.”\n\nWe will also be releasing Roman Candle on vinyl for the first time in the U.S.\n\nFrom a Basement on the Hill was released posthumously in 2004 on ANTI- records.\n\nWith the addition of these two records Kill Rock Stars is now the home for all of Elliott Smith’s independent releases: Roman Candle, Elliott Smith, Either/Or, From a Basement on the Hill, and New Moon.\n\nTo celebrate the addition of these amazing records we are giving away a free, previously unreleased song entitled \"Cecilia/Amanda\". It was recorded at Jackpot! Recording Studio in 1997 by Larry Crane. An earlier version of this song was initially written and recorded by Elliott's high school band, Stranger Than Fiction, and was known as \"Time is Ours Now\". \"Cecilia/Amanda\" is a reworking of that song with almost completely different lyrics. Download/listen here: http://i.listentokrs.com/bands/elliottsmith/audio/CeciliaAmanda.mp3.\n\nOur Elliott Smith back catalog is also on sale until January 4th in our mail order (http://www.buyolympia.com/killrockstars) and on iTunes.\n\nalso check the official elliott smith store to buy elliott merchandise for your gift for your love ones or yourself for this holiday season! remember proceeds from the sale of the merchandise goes to the elliott smith memorial fund! to visit the elliott smith official store please go here: elliott smith official store.

(8.9.09)\n\nhappy birthday, 11 years and coming soon\n\nwe send our warmest prayers and thoughts out into the world on what would have been elliott's 40th birthday. it's hard to imagine that elliott was 29 when we started sweet adeline. elliott and his music is a blessing to so many people and in so many ways. 40 years ago we were so lucky that a wonderful person came to being. even though we think of elliott on the day he passed, this is the day i choose to reflect and celebrate his life on because it was the beginning of someone and something great. as always we send all our love to everyone on this day and we are happy to know that elliott's memory will not only last longer than 34 years...40 years..but it will last forever. thank you all for remembering elliott especially on this special day.\n\ni can't believe i missed this anniversary but on july 11th it was sweet adeline's 11th year on the web. i feel really bad because i never consider this site something i do or contribute to only but that it is a joint effort between all of elliott's fans and i really love trying to reconize that each year. thank you to everyone who has contributed to the site in so many ways. i appreciate your contribution, kindness and patience. thank you for all your support. i wish i could do more to thank you guys. yay! for 11 years.\n\nfinally, i hope to update the site with some recent news about guitar hero 5, elliott smith songbook and more. hopefully this weekend! xo (8.6.09)\n\n33 1/3 series xo book coming in april, larry crane interview, josie cotton, magnet's the over/under + more\n\noriginally listed on amazon.com with a release date in mid march, amazon.com recently sent me an email about shipping the new 33 1/3 book about elliott's record, 'xo,' saying its planning to ship in early/mid april! continuum is publishing the book and it is written by matthew lemay who has been a staff writer for pitchfork media for many years. here is a description of the book:\n\n\"many albums could be cited to support the claim that great suffering yields great art. elliott smith’s xo should not be one of them. smith’s 1998 major label debut defies the “tortured singer-songwriter” stereotype, and takes up this defiance as a central theme. at a time when smith was being groomed for a particular (and particularly condescending) brand of stardom, he produced a record that eviscerated one of the central assumptions of singersongwriterdom: that pain is beautiful. xo insists that romanticizing personal tragedy can only leave you “deaf and dumb and done.” and it backs up this claim with some of the most artful and intelligent music of its day. matthew lemay writes an original take on a widely beloved album, steering clear of the sensationalist suicide angles that have dogged most analysis of elliott smith's extraordinary work.\"\n\nif you would like to pick up the book, please check your local book store or you can order through amazon.com by going here: elliott smith's xo (33 1/3 series)\n\n- thank you to john and jake for sending a link to a new and really great/informative interview from glorious noise with larry crane about archiving elliott's music. the article features the latest information about where larry is at in archiving elliott's music, what he is archving, what his thoughts what the future might hold and much more!. it also includes an idea of what larry has gone through some rare photos of what larry has working with along with a special overseer to make sure the job gets done! to read the interview, please head over to glorious noise here: elliott smith's archives: the glono interview with larry crane.\n\n- matt from magnet magazine was kind enough to send in an email about a recent interview with josie cotton. josie is well know for her own music and the song, “johnny, are you queer?” she also owns satellite park where elliott recorded with david mcconnell while working on what would be 'from a basement on the hill' songs. the interview with josie brings up elliott and josie gives an idea of what elliott was doing, thinking and going through at the time while at her studio. to read the interview and the part about elliott, please follow this link to magnet magazine: q&a with josie cotton.\n\nmatt also mentioned that: \"...corey dubrowa, who's written extensively on elliott and his work, is doing a list of overrated/underrated songs.\" so check out to see which elliott songs makes the list by going to the magnet's feature: the over/under: elliott smith. thanks matt!\n\n- thanks to paul for sharing this: the professional skater dylan rieder chose \"coast to coast\" for his segment in alien workshop's \"mind field.\"\n\n- thanks to shaun for sending this link to a neat site about book inscriptions called the book incription project. he found a sweet one that is inscribed in autumn de wilde's elliott smith book. you can go here to check it out: through the eyes of of a girl.

here is collin with some awesome memories (p.s. click on the image on the left for a larger version of it):\n\n\"well, that was a long time ago, but i can tell you what i remember. my friend (now sister-in-law) sara harris, was a violinist and friend of garrick at lincoln hs. she had played on some earlier stranger than fiction thing, and she got us together. no, wait there's another connection! garrick and i were camp counselors together the previous summer (1987) so he may have just called me himself. anyway, the session itself took place in a basement of a house up in portland heights, near ainsworth school. a basement on a hill, as it were. it was probably jason hornick's parent's house. i remember meeting steve (not quite elliott to the real world yet) and he was kind of quiet and intense with a dry and opaque sense of humor. he was serious about the music, though, even though he didn't really have all the tools yet. and as you can hear from the tape, neither did i! ;) i only played on one track \"chinatown.\" i listened to the mix they had, which was pretty much everything but the cello, a couple times and then went into the recording room, which was a little closet under the stairs. there were no charts, and i just had to figure out it was in c minor. i just improvised over the song 2 or 3 times, and they used what they wanted. i guess they didn't have very good editing tools, because they didn't do much to save me from embarrassing myself with wrong notes and aimless noodling, but iI guess there are one or two good ideas in there. and that was that. one footnote: after graduating from college in 1991, i moved back to portland for a year, and got a job selling bread and coffee at le panier in old town. elliott was making sandwiches in back. i remembered him as steve, and he told me he was elliott now, and he really did seem to be much more comfortable with himself. we'd sometimes hang out on break, and he'd make humorous references that would blow right by me. it's a real shame he's gone now. good for him for getting some good music together before he went.\"\n\nthanks to elwin for emailing us at the the official elliott smith myspace page about a rare interview that they recently added to youtube. it features an interview with elliott that is circa 1998 and one of the earliest live performances of 'happiness.' i never even realized he played that song as early as 1998 other than seeing it in the dreamworks promo film, 'strange parallel. also there is a cool mention about elliott's first time ever playing at talent show (he covered the beatles' blackbird). anyway here is the video:\n\nthanks to packyourownchute for posting on sweet addy that larry crane recently added a blog entry to his tape log blog about how is in the middle archiving and cataloging elliott's music still. this quick entry talks about how larry cataloging 1.5 tb of music files, how he is going about organizing it and mr.toad helped with the transfers of the music and file system. it's really cool to know larry is still spending a lot of time working on elliott's music :)\n\nfinally, thank you to mitchell for letting us know elliott tops prolific magazine's '8 best get-over-a-break-up albums' list. elliott's 'from a basement on the hill' is their #1 pick. if you are interested in checking out the other artists on the list including why 'from a basement on the hill' is #1, please go here: prolific magazine (10.7.08)\n\nathens, greece, new brunswick, nj, fort wayne, in, lansing, il, & japan tribute updates!\n\nthank you to everyone for all the amazing updates with additional tribute shows. thank you again to everyone involved. we have an amazing list of shows in our tribute shows page if you want to check out the latest updates. i have other tribute shows to add this week too plus other news. please come back at least a couple more times this week to see new updates. thanks again to everyone who are putting these shows on and to fans who were kind enough to send an email in to share the news :)\n\nathens, greece: thanks to for glorybox posting a message via the official elliott smith myspace page that there is going to be a tribute in athens, greece on october 21st. the tribute is going to be at bios (peiraios 84, athens) and tickets will be sold for 3 euros and proceeds will be going to charity!
