        "text": "UPDATED with new release date: Sony said Tuesday that it will now open Miramax’s Here, the reteam of Forrest Gump filmmaker Robert Zemeckis and its stars Tom Hanks and Robin Wright, on November 1. It’s the only studio theatrical release going wide on that day after Samuel Goldwyn’s Liam Neeson title Absolution, Viva’s animated Hitpig and the George Huang-directed Luke Evans movie Weekend in Taipei. There’s been no buzz that Here will land a place at the fall’s film festival troika of Toronto, Venice and Telluride.\n\nPREVIOUSLY, June 21: Sony said Friday that its new film Here, reuniting the director, writer, and stars of the classic Forrest Gump, will open wide via TriStar Pictures on November 15.\n\nPreviously, the film had been scheduled for an exclusive run in Los Angeles in New York on that date, with a limited and wide release to follow on November 22 and November 27, respectively. Other titles set to open in its new frame include A24’s horror thriller Heretic starring Hugh Grant, on which we were first to report; Amazon’s holiday event film Red One starring Dwayne Johnson; and an untitled Christmas film from IFC Films.\n\nDirected by Robert Zemeckis, Here is billed as an original drama about multiple families and a special place they inhabit. The story travels through generations, capturing the human experience in its purest form. Eric Roth & Zemeckis adapted the screenplay from the acclaimed same-name graphic novel by Richard McGuire. Tom Hanks and Robin Wright star.\n\nRELATED DEADLINE VIDEO:\n\nZemeckis, Jack Rapke, Derek Hogue and Bill Block produced alongside EPs Jeremy Johns, Andrew Golov and Thom Zadra, with Paul Bettany, Kelly Reilly and Michelle Dockery rounding out the cast.\n\nMiramax holds international rights to the picture."
