        "text": "What is the application review process like?\n\nOnce you submit your application, it takes our office 1-2 weeks to process your application and materials. Once your application has been processed and completed, it is sent for review.\n\nYour application will be reviewed holistically, so all of your materials (i.e., resume, statement of purpose, letters of recommendation, transcripts, and test scores if applicable) will be considered in evaluating you for both admission and fellowships.\n\nHow do I check the status of my application materials?\n\nYou can check to see the status of your application by logging into your portal. If you’re logging in on a mobile device, you’ll need to scroll down to see your checklist. If you’re on a computer, your checklist should appear on the side of your screen.\n\nAs your application is processed and materials are received, we will update your checklist so that you can see which items have been received and which are still outstanding. A status of 100% complete does not indicate that all materials have been received, but that your application has been submitted.\n\nPlease note that “unknown school” or “high school transcripts” checklist items are a technical glitch, so if those are populating in your checklist, there’s nothing you need to worry about.\n\nHow do I submit documents once my application is submitted?\n\nYou can email the documents to us at [email protected]. Make sure they are in pdf format.\n\nDo you offer application fee waivers?\n\nThere are a variety of reasons that we offer application fee waivers. You can scroll down to the Application/Fee tab on this website for a list.\n\nTo request a fee waiver, wait until you’re ready to submit your application. Hit the “Submit and Pay” button, select “Fee Waiver” as your method of payment, and write in the reason for your request. Fee waiver requests typically take 1-2 business days to be reviewed. You’ll receive an email letting you know whether or not the waiver has been approved.\n\nCan I defer admission?\n\nWe suggest that you apply for the semester in which you intend to enroll. We do have a deferral process that you can follow (below) if certain unforeseen circumstances arise, though you’ll need to formally request a deferral, and approval is not guaranteed.\n\nYou can only request to defer admission if you’ve been admitted to a program, but if you apply and need to change the start term on your application for any reason, just email [email protected].\n\nThe granting of deferrals is rare, but may be granted for a limited number of reasons such as the following:\n\n1. Unique employment opportunity (including military orders)\n\n2. Special fellowship program (Boren, Fulbright, etc.)\n\n3. Family or medical emergency.\n\n4. International students unable to obtain an F-1 visa, as long as they submitted all I-20 documents by the stated Elliott School deadlines (maximum of 1 semester deferral)\n\nDeferral requests should be made in writing, to [email protected]. Please be aware, documentation will be required to support any request for a deferral and should be included in this email request. Students who cannot attend for reasons outside of the reasons above are encouraged to decline their offer of admission and reapply for a future semester.\n\nDeferral requests should be made no later than May 1st for those admitted to a fall semester and no later than December 1st for those admitted to a spring semester. Deferral requests after these dates will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Students admitted to any of our degree programs (M.A., M.I.P.P., M.I.S.) may only request a one-semester or a one-year deferral. Deferrals will not be approved for more than one year.\n\nIf a deferral is granted, in addition to the nonrefundable $500 enrollment deposit, students granted a one-year deferral must submit an additional nonrefundable $500 deposit. This deposit for those deferring to a fall semester will need to be made no later than May 30th, and for those deferring to a spring semester, the deposit should be made no later than December 30th. Active duty U.S. military personnel and veterans are not required to submit a deposit.\n\nA student's original Elliott School Fellowship decision will apply to the semester they defer to. This only applies to Elliott School Fellowships and America 2050 Fellowships; any other fellowships awarded will not defer with the student. Students who were not awarded an Elliott School Fellowship with their original admission will not be reconsidered for fellowships after deferring, and are encouraged to look for external sources of funding.\n\nThe deposit will be credited toward the student's first-semester tuition bill. However, should plans change and a student decides not to attend the Elliott School, they forfeit their deposit.\n\nPlease be aware that students admitted off the waitlist do not qualify for deferral approval.\n\nCan I reapply to the Elliott School?\n\nYes. You will need to submit a new application, but you may be able to use letters of recommendation and transcripts that you’ve already submitted from your previous Elliott School application.\n\nOnce you’ve created your new application, you can email [email protected] letting us know which materials you would like moved over.\n\nDo you offer spring admission?\n\nYes. We have both fall and spring application cycles for all programs*. The spring semester fellowship deadline is October 1st, and the spring semester begins in mid-January.\n\n*Please note that spring applicants to the M.A. in International Development Studies, M.A. in International Science and Technology Policy Studies, and M.A. in Middle East Studies programs must agree to complete the program over five semesters instead of four. This excludes summer sessions.\n\nWho are Elliott School students?\n\nElliott School students come from a wide variety of backgrounds. To view some of our current student profiles, you can check out our blog. Additionally, if you’d like to get in touch with current students and alumni, you can fill out this form.\n\nDo you admit undocumented applicants?\n\nCitizenship is not required for admission to Elliott School programs. Please visit our applying as an undocumented student page.\n\nWhat if I have personal life events or circumstances that have negatively impacted parts my application, such as past academic performance?\n\nIf you feel that personal life events or circumstances have negatively impacted parts of your application, feel free to include a Supplemental Statement (no more than one page) to explain the impact of the event or circumstances. The Supplemental Statement will be shared with our admissions committee to give context as part of our holistic admissions process.\n\nStudents submitting a Supplemental Statement should include the statement in the same PDF document as their Statement of Purpose, separating both documents by the title - Statement of Purpose and Supplemental Statement.\n\nShould I consider taking the GRE or GMAT even if it is not required for the Elliott School?\n\nThe GRE is not required for any Elliott School programs. Not sending scores won't negatively impact your application in any way.\n\nThe following Elliott School programs are test-blind, meaning that GRE/GMAT scores are not accepted and will not be considered in the review process. Please do not submit scores if you are applying for a test-blind program:\n\nM.A. in Asian Studies\n\nM.A. in Global Communication\n\nM.A. in International Affairs\n\nM.A. in International Development Studies\n\nM.A. in International Economic Policy\n\nM.A. in Middle East Studies\n\nMaster of International Policy and Practice (MIPP)\n\nMaster of International Studies (MIS)\n\nGraduate Certificate in Global Gender Policy\n\nGraduate Certificate in International Science and Technology Policy\n\nGraduate Certificate in Nuclear Policy\n\nThe following Elliott School programs are test-optional, meaning that we accept GRE/GMAT scores if you choose to send them:\n\nM.A. in International Science and Technology Policy\n\nM.A. in Security Policy Studies\n\nMost students choose not to send scores unless they're looking to offset weaker portions of the application or unless the had to take the exam already for another program and performed well. Your application will be evaluated holistically with or without GRE/GMAT scores.\n\nWhat is the average GPA for Elliott School students?\n\nThe average GPA of our most recent incoming class is 3.51. Please note that the Elliott School does not have a GPA requirement and that though 3.51 represents the average, students were admitted above and below it.\n\nDo you require a writing sample?\n\nWe do not require a writing sample. We require a 500-word statement of purpose (and for MIPP applicants, a second 500-word essay), and you can find the requirements under the Statement of Purpose tab on our prerequisites & materials page.\n\nWhat is your application process for transfer applicants?\n\nOur application process is the same for all applicants and we do not have a separate application process for transfer applicants. Please refer to our Prerequisites & Materials page for information about our application requirements.\n\nStudents are able to transfer up to 9 credits into Elliott School programs. Credits must not have been applied to other earned degrees.\n\nIf you’re admitted and choose to enroll, you can work with your academic advisor to figure out which credits will transfer.\n\nCan I obtain copies of my application materials, such as transcripts, statements of purpose, and recommendation letters?\n\nWe are unable to provide copies of application materials submitted to the Elliott School. All application materials become the property of the George Washington University once they have been submitted and will not be returned to the student.\n\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) protects the privacy of students' education records. Admissions records, including application materials and decision information, fall under the category of education records covered by FERPA.\n\nEligible students that wish to view application materials should submit to the University Registrar, Dean, Head of the academic department, or other appropriate official written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The University official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected.\n\nTo learn more about FERPA policies at GWU, you can visit the Office of the Registrar."
