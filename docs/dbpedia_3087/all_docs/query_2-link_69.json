        "text": "Things are beginning to unravel for Cate Blanchett in the first teaser for “Disclaimer,” a new limited series written and directed by Academy Award-winning filmmaker Alfonso Cuarón. Apple TV+ pulled the curtain back on the thriller Wednesday morning.\n\nBased on the novel of the same name from Renée Knight, “Disclaimer” stars Blanchett as Catherine Ravenscroft, a celebrated journalist who receives a novel from a mysterious source that threatens to expose her own dark past.\n\nThe tense teaser rolls through a group of striking images from the series, including Blanchett avoiding being hit by a car and a couple holding hands at a gloomy beach. Along with Blanchett, the series stars Kevin Kline, Sacha Baron Cohen, Kodi Smit-McPhee, “Squid Game” breakout Hoyeon, Lesley Manville, “Enola Holmes” actor Louis Partridge and Leila George. Cuarón, who last worked in television on the 2014 fantasy drama “Believe,” serves as writer and director for “Disclaimer.”\n\nThe series is produced by Esperanto Filmoj and Anonymous Content. Cuarón, Blanchett, Gabriela Rodriguez, David Levine, Steve Golin, Emmanuel Lubezki, Bruno Delbonnel, Donald Sabourin and Carlos Morales are executive producers. Knight, who wrote the 2015 novel the series is based on, serves as a co-executive producer. Finneas O’Connell composed the score.\n\n“Disclaimer” hits Apple TV+ on Oct. 11, debuting with its first two episodes. New episodes will be released every Friday through Nov. 15. Ahead of the streaming release, the series will bow several episodes at the Venice Film Festival in September for its world premiere.\n\nWatch the trailer below."
