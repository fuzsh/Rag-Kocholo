        "text": "Oh, for those innocent days of yore, when “The Hangover” was a malady and not a movie, when the words “Zach Galifianakis” were as alien as “Klaatu barada nikto.”\n\nIt seems like millennia since the binge comedy became the new normal. But here comes “21 and Over,” taking rude to a new level of crude, a post-racial romp through one epic night on one Asian American collegian’s twenty-first birthday.\n\nA couple of “Hangover” writers co-wrote and directed this sometimes inspired, often funny and occasionally psychotic pub crawl through the long dark night of Jeff Chang’s soul. Scott Moore and Jon Lucas hope we know that it’s not “ripping off” if you’re ripping yourself off.\n\nJeff Chang (Justin Chon from “Twilight”) is a catchphrase, a punchline and a punching bag, all in one.\n\nAs in “Just one beer, Jeff Chang.” And “Jeff Chang is a grown man and he made his own decisions,” to “I think we killed Jeff Chang.”\n\nHe’s the Ken Jeong character here, a wild-partying break from Asian stereotypes. All he may want to do is sleep in the night before a big internship interview. But his gonzo pal Miller (Miles Teller of “Project X”) and more responsible friend Casey (Skylar Astin of “Pitch Perfect”) want to do is get him blind drunk.\n\nAll they have to do is get him back to his apartment, sober and cleaned-up by the time the kid’s comically stern dad (Francois Chau) shows up. Which we guess, from the film’s opening scene, they won’t manage.\n\nBecause Miller and Casey are naked and branded, stalking across campus in the early morning light, muttering “This never happened” when we first meet them.\n\nThe night starts with beer, with Casey falling for Jeff Chang’s gal pal Nicole (Sarah Wright), and it staggers to a sorority house and a pep rally, from a progressive dorm drinking party concocted to resemble a multi-level video game (drink and compete your way to the roof) to the campus police station and infirmary.\n\nJeff Chang is passed out. Miller and Casey don’t remember his address. The night is their quest to get this student in a stupor back home, as Jeff Chang incoherently blurts out random needs like “Count CHOCULA.”\n\nLucas and Moore swap the homophobic riffs of “The Hangover” for comical jabs at race – stumbling into a Latina sorority, a minefield of Asian jokes and the odd Jew jab.\n\nThe dizzying drinking montage of how hapless Jeff Chang got into his stoned state is hilarious, cleverly cut and packed with deranged “Oh no he DIDN’T” moments.\n\nIt’s irresponsible as all get out, and “21 and Over” becomes a drag when a gun shows up, when Jeff Chang’s dark secret and Miller’s embarrassing revelation come out, when the drunken driving sight gag arrives.\n\nBut the bottom-line on this bottom-baring/bottom-branding farce is “Is it funny, on top of all the shocks?” And yes, it is. On a number of few occasions, all of them involving Jeff Chang.\n\nMPAA Rating: R for crude and sexual content, pervasive language, some graphic nudity, drugs and drinking\n\nCast: Miles Teller, Justin Chon, Jonathan Keltz, Skylar Astin\n\nCredits: Written and directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore. A Relativity release.\n\nRunning time: 1:30"
