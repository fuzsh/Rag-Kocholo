        "text": "Article: Keep the Things You Forgot: An Elliott Smith Oral History\n\nby Jayson Greene\n\nOctober 21, 2013 Photo by: Autumn de Wilde\n\nEver since he died, 10 years ago today, people have been clamoring to tell Elliott Smith's story for him: writers, poets, fellow musicians, his religiously devoted fans—anyone who felt the subliminal undertow of his songs. The urge is understandable. Smith’s music, with its forensic attention to mood, dredges some of our murkiest emotions to the surface and coaxes unnameable sensations into focus. When an artist has this gift, they stir powerful needs.\n\nSince the moment Smith began making solo recordings, beginning with the whispered, hyper-intimate 1994 collection Roman Candle, he has inspired fervent reactions. His story is dotted with followers, people who instinctively grasped the appeal of his music and felt themselves helplessly conscripted to his cause. They became storytellers for Elliott’s genius and originality, champions for someone allergic to championing himself.\n\nWhat follows is not an oral history of his life, but of his music; specifically, his solo career. The lines between life and music are tangled, of course, in ways that aren’t neatly prizable, and darker stories eventually creep into the frame at the edges. But the arc traced here begins with the emergence of That Voice: the flowering of his talent, the development of the intimate, inscrutable folk-pop he would mine for the rest of his career. That discovery dovetails with the dissolution of his first band, the loud-rocking Heatmiser. In some ways the development of the former triggered the latter. The story told here begins at this hinge point, as Smith begins exploring the possibilities of his fiercely intimate four-track solo recordings that would pull him away from Heatmiser and, eventually, into the national spotlight.\n\nFor those who knew him personally, the task of speaking for Elliott Smith wavers between privilege and burden. Many of the 18 people who spoke to me—bandmates, producers, managers, friends—emerged hesitantly, stepping gingerly over their own profound misgivings, issuing grave caveats. They’d been burned before, they warned me. They swore they’d never speak again. The story of their self-imposed silence, and their individual choices to break it or hold it, runs in powerful counterpoint to Smith’s own story. Some of the singer's closest associates have simply declined to go on record: Having been prodded multiple times, they have understandably snapped shut. Some are speaking now for the first time. The combination of profound ambivalence and fierce conviction in their voices, as they opened themselves up, was chastening.\n\nElliott Smith outside of Coffee People in Portland circa 1993. Photo by JJ Gonson.\n\nHeatmiser\n\nIn 1984, Elliott Smith—born Steven Paul Smith—moves to Portland from Duncanville, Texas, to live with his father, Gary Smith, and Gary’s wife Marta Greenwald. There, at Lincoln High School, he meets Tony Lash, future drummer of Heatmiser, and forms his first band, Stranger Than Fiction. Upon graduating, he goes off to Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts*, where he meets Neil Gust and forms an early version of Heatmiser. (*It is around this time that Steven Paul Smith begins going by “Elliott.”) When he returns to Portland after graduation, Gust, Smith, Lash, and bassist Brandt Peterson form the final version of that band.\n\nTONY LASH [high school friend; drummer, Heatmiser]: In the high school band, I played flute and Elliott played clarinet. He was funny, and we were both kind of nerdy. A friend of mine introduced us because we both liked Rush.\n\nElliott's songs were ridiculously complicated then. He had so many ideas and he hadn't really developed his arrangement skills, so the songs would start in one place and go through all these sections and then end arbitrarily. But having come from a prog background, it wasn't hard for me to negotiate all the time changes. We recorded our one really ambitious album when I was a senior and he was a junior; we definitely aimed high, even if the results weren't necessarily stellar.\n\nWe kept in touch while he was at Hampshire College; I stayed in Portland and went into record production, getting a job at a studio. Every summer we worked on some kind of a project. Then Elliott came back from college and we started playing together again as Heatmiser.\n\nHeatmiser circa 1993, from left: Brandt Peterson, Elliott Smith, Tony Lash, Neil Gust. Photo by JJ Gonson.\n\nJJ GONSON [manager, Heatmiser; girlfriend]: The first time I saw Heatmiser was in 1993, at X-Ray in Portland. I had this visceral response, which I've only had with a few bands. I was impressed by every single member. Elliott was clearly an uber-talented songwriter, Neil [Gust] was clearly an almost-as-talented songwriter, and they both had terrific singing voices and were really gifted guitar players. The drummer [Tony Lash] was excellent. There was not a slacker in Heatmiser.\n\nNeil and Elliott had very different guitar skills that complemented each other beautifully. In fact, when I met them, I would say that Neil was the more accomplished of the two. But Elliott had a natural aptitude that was unique. He could hear music and make it come out of his fingers in a way that most guitar players can't. He never stumbled. It was like there was a channel that went straight from his brain to his fingers, and that was immediately evident watching him play live. You only see that kind of skill level once in a while, so when you see it, you know it.\n\nTONY LASH: I have a lot of fond memories of that time. Portland still has an extremely vibrant music scene, but there was a bit more of a united, focused community with the bands and the people that came to see music then. La Luna, along with a few other places, was the epicenter of that, the place where the large shows happened. We definitely packed our shows, and people were really into it.\n\nHeatmiser at Portland's X-Ray Cafe in May 1992. From left: Brandt Peterson, Neil Gust, Elliott Smith. Photo by JJ Gonson.\n\nJJ GONSON: A phenomenal thing happened in Portland in the early 90s. At La Luna, someone had this idea to charge one dollar at the door to see three local bands every Monday night. The club capacity was maybe 1,000, and they got to keep the bar, but the bands could sell merchandise and they got 100% of the door. So every Monday night the bands were pretty much guaranteed at least $300—which was huge in 1993—and the shows had Heatmiser, Crackerbash, Pond, Hazel, the Dandy Warhols. It was all local. It sold out every Monday, because nobody had a job, really—this was the early 90s and there was no work. The bands would get their cash and, more importantly, they would have the experience of playing in front of 1,000 people who knew their songs. What you ended up with is these bands that perform really well.\n\nHeatmiser were just a phenomenal, rip-your-head-off-and-shove-it-up-your-ass rock band. I saw them hundreds of times. Elliott was so into it; in every photo I took of them onstage from that time, he's biting his lip. The thing I remember most vividly is that he always had this exact same rocking motion in his body language.\n\n[Both Neil and Elliott] were writing really good songs, but I immediately recognized that Elliott was writing in a way that maybe… appealed to me more personally? When they did that Yellow No. 5 EP, the song \"Idler\" might have been around when I started to go “whoa, whoa, whoa.” That really quiet, haunting thing. Also, at that point I was already hearing some of Roman Candle. It's just that I wasn't hearing it in the same way. I was hearing it at home.\n\nRoman Candle (1994)\n\nIn 1993, Smith moves in with JJ Gonson, at a house on Southeast 29th Avenue and Taylor Street in Portland. In the basement, he begins rehearsing and recording the music that would become his first solo release, Roman Candle*.*\n\nJJ GONSON: We were all kids, hanging out. There was a lot of Sonic the Hedgehog and sitting around. He and I had a very simpatico sense of humor and found a lot of similar interests in music; we'd just sit around and play together for hours and sing.\n\nFor a long time we were “just good friends,” and I remember seeing him leaning against an ex-girlfriend one time and thinking, \"Why is that bothering me? That shouldn't be bothering me.” I'd already worked with the band for awhile, and he wrote songs about feeling like he shouldn't be dating me, wanting to, and knowing that it wasn't the right thing to do. Neither of us would deal with it for a long time. And when we finally did, all of our friends were like, \"No! That's a really bad idea!\" [laughs] Was it a bad idea? I don't know. He was the love of my life in a lot of ways. I'm enormously grateful to have had that emotional experience. I think that everybody should be that in love with somebody, even if it has to come to an end.\n\nAt the Taylor Street house, he would sit upstairs playing for hours and hours and hours, working on the songs, and then he'd go downstairs for half an hour and put something down on tape. He didn't spend very much time in the \"studio,\" which was the basement. It was gross down there; he was perched on a stool surrounded by garbage. It wasn't like it was a couch and cappuccinos. I don't even think we had a washing machine. He was welcome to be down there by himself, nobody wanted to be down there.\n\nThe whole sound quality of Roman Candle is entirely based on the fact that he's using a low-quality microphone right up against his fingers. He doesn't even have an acoustic pickup—he's playing an acoustic guitar into a microphone.\n\nI had a copy of the finished cassette on me all the time and I was listening to it all the time. I had a lot of friends at Sub Pop and Matador and Cavity Search and all these record labels, and I was hanging out with them because I was promoting [Heatmiser], and I needed these labels to put their bands on tour with my band, but I didn’t burst into Cavity Search Records like, \"You have to play this! It's the best thing you've ever heard and you need to release it right now.\" I was probably just like, \"I've got this solo cassette by Elliott.\" \"What? Elliott does solo stuff?\" I put it on and their jaws dropped. They released it without changing a thing. That's Roman Candle.\n\nFrom left: Elliott Smith, Sam Coomes, Charlie Campbell, Julie Weiss, unknown, Janet Weiss, Nate Storm Snell, and Chris Brady, circa 1993. Photo by JJ Gonson.\n\nTONY LASH: We mixed Roman Candle in my basement—to the extent that you can mix off of a four-track cassette. It was so different from what Heatmiser was doing. I didn't have a sense right then that it was going to become his big thing. A lot more care was taken with recording his second solo record, but even then it seemed more like an extremely viable side project to me, with Heatmiser as the main focus.\n\nSLIM MOON [founder, Kill Rock Stars]: I didn't know Elliott at all, but we were both playing on this small tour of solo artists going down the West Coast. The first night was in Seattle, and I missed Elliott's set. The second night was at the Bottom of the Hill in San Francisco, and I was blown away by Elliott's set. So I went out to the car to listen to [Roman Candle] rather than staying for the rest of the show.\n\nI was just flabbergasted. It was so incredibly good. And really, really different from anything anybody else was doing. It was soft and gritty at the same time—a really rare combination. The song that blew me away was \"Last Call\", it's in my top 10 favorite songs to this day. It's the perfect song in terms of lyrics, melody, as a piece of poetry: \"You're a crisis/ You're an icicle/ You're a tongueless talker/ You don't care what you say/ You're a jaywalker and you just walk away.\" Those lines stick with me.\n\nThere's this little trick that he does in that song where he drops the tuning at the end. It almost feels like it's two songs edited together, except he would play it live and reach over and just turn the tuning peg as he played. It's not a studio trick. It impressed me that it was all done on a four-track, too, because the cheaper the production is, the less you can hide your flaws. Like, Lars [Ulrich] of Metallica is one of the worst drummers I've ever heard, but they hide it because they spend millions recording. [laughs]\n\nLARRY CRANE [owner, Jackpot! Recording Studio; producer/engineer; archivist for Smith's family]: I’m really supportive of the local music scene and everything, but I’m not always impressed by the quality of other people’s work. [laughs] But when I heard Roman Candle, I thought, \"Wow, that’s pretty good for the guy from Heatmiser.\" Initially, I thought Heatmiser were another crummy, wild guitar band that the grunge era brought up. But I started realizing, “Oh wait, they have songs.”\n\nMARGARET MITTLEMAN [manager]: Slim Moon fell in love with Elliott, and he told me I had to come down and see him. I don't remember what he played. I'm more of a vibe person, and Elliott's demeanor hit me right away, right in the stomach. He was just sitting in a chair in the corner, but he seemed so special in every way.\n\nWe talked after that show. My intent was just to help him. He wasn’t interested in a publishing contract or a manager. I was working at BMG Publishing, and one of our goals at the time was to sign things really inexpensively and just offer services. Anyway, he liked us, and he liked that we had done work with Beck, who was a recent artist I had signed. We developed a friendship.\n\nElliott Smith (1995)\n\nSmith records his self-titled record at friend Leslie Uppinghouse’s house, moving on from Cavity Search to Slim Moon’s Kill Rock Stars label. The album is released on July 25, 1995, accompanied by a larger promotional campaign.\n\nSLIM MOON: We talked about his ideas or hopes for the next step after Roman Candle, and he mentioned that he was interested in being on K Records. I knew [K owner] Calvin [Johnson], so over the next couple of months, I gave him a copy of the record, told him that Elliott was the real deal, and told him to come see him play. I never heard back from Calvin about that. To my knowledge, Elliott never heard from Calvin either. I talked to Elliott a while later and said, \"Would it be cool if Kill Rock Stars put out a 7\"?\"\n\nWe never did multi-record deals at Kill Rock Stars back then. We would just do one album, see how it went, and then discuss it again. Before we put out Elliott Smith, I looked at Soundscan, and it showed that half of the sales of Roman Candle had been in Portland, and he was basically unknown everywhere else. I figured that if anyone could be wildly popular in one town, then that could be replicated everywhere, all you have to do is get the word out. But Elliott Smith really didn't sell that well.\n\nPart of that was context: At Kill Rock Stars, everything that we had put out to that point was either a sort-of-loud, guitar-based, technically-interesting indie rock band like Unwound or godheadSilo or Universal Order of Armageddon, or it was associated with the Riot Grrrl scene, like Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, and Huggy Bear. And Elliott was really different. So when we sent this acoustic solo singer-songwriter record out to press and college radio, they just went, \"Oh, I don't get what this is supposed to be.” Reviewers wouldn't review it. It just got ignored. I don’t think they listened to it and passed on it, I think it just sat on their desk.\n\nAnd the other thing was this strong anti-singer-songwriter bias in the early 90s—because indie rock was still coming out of the punk tradition, it was anti-a lot of the things the 70s had been known for, including heartfelt singer-songwriters. So anybody with an acoustic guitar singing under their own name was instantly going to be compared to James Taylor, no matter what they sounded like. People just rolled their eyes, straight off. Maybe there were a couple other people, like Bill Callahan as Smog, and Lou Barlow as Sentridoh, who were doing that, but they were performing under band names. So it was bold of Elliott to perform under his own name.\n\nJJ GONSON: It was embarrassing to be doing acoustic music. Nobody did it. Everybody was rough. There was no pop going on at that time. Elliott and I used to play Peter Paul & Mary, Beatles, and Captain and Tennille covers together in the bedroom with the door closed, hoping nobody could hear us. I will never forget Neil laughing the first time Elliott played him a solo song, the part where his voice goes up on on “No Name #1”. Laughing. It was just shocking.\n\nI can't not acknowledge the fact that we are talking here about Portland, Oregon, in the 90s: This was O.H.—Original Hipster—so you had a lot of deeply ironic listening material like whale songs or Halloween Sound Effects records, or Tito Puente, or some Spanish movie soundtrack. And Portland itself is very rugged—there's a lot of Bad Company. [laughs]\n\nMARGARET MITTLEMAN: I remember one night we did karaoke with [Sleater-Kinney/Quasi's] Janet [Weiss] and [Smith bandmate] Sam [Coomes], and me and Janet did \"Ride Captain Ride\" together. Elliott might have done Rush.\n\nROB SCHNAPF [producer, Heatmiser’s Mic City Sons*, along with* Either/Or*,* XO*, and* Figure 8*; married to Margaret Mittleman*]: He actually did “Rock You Like a Hurricane” by the Scorpions. The look on Elliott’s face when he realized how high Klaus Meine’s voice is on that first note—the the realization of having miscalculated in public with a microphone in your hand—oh, it was good.\n\nJJ GONSON: We were huge Elvis Costello fans, too. I remember sitting with Neil and Elliott in the living room at their house with our heads down listening to Brutal Youth. Amazing record. When Elliott was on tour, I went to see Elvis Costello and he was fucking furious.\n\nHe would walk up behind me and put his arms around me and sing [the Carpenters'] \"Close to You\" to me. At one point when we were falling apart, he made me a beautiful cassette recording of the Cheap Trick song \"If You Want My Love\". I wish I knew where it was, but I don't.\n\nMARGARET MITTLEMAN: When I would tell the other bands I was working with that I was working with Elliott Smith, they’d be like, “Oh, why? That’s weird.” Eventually, of course, they became his biggest fans.\n\nBetween 1994 and 1996, Smith tours regularly as a solo artist while remaining the co-frontman of Heatmiser.\n\nSLIM MOON: A couple of the shows we played on that Roman Candle tour in 1994 were really poorly promoted, so we'd goof off, and Elliott would play a lot of Hank Williams and stuff. There was one show that was in a sports bar in Santa Cruz where there was no one there except the regulars, who were really bummed that we were bogarting their dartboard area. And I had really bad gas—I was farting up a storm. Elliott was cracking jokes about the smell in between songs, to the amusement of no one but me.\n\nMARGARET MITTLEMAN: Elliott’s first solo tour on the East Coast was painful because he was still becoming comfortable with performing alone—and not just alone, but alone to an empty room. He was nervous about it, and it used to make him… not feel good a lot. He dealt with a lot of stomach issues. So I'd always be the one telling him, “You can do it.” But whether it would be one person or five, somebody inevitably would discover him from that one experience, and the next time he went back, it was easier.\n\nROB SCHNAPF: He used to play these shows and he wouldn’t finish songs and he would just kind of give up, and Margaret would be like, \"Nope, you’re gonna go out there, you’ve gotta finish your songs, go back up the stairs.\" He'd say, \"What if someone’s talking?\" And she'd say, \"Who cares? You wanna do this, right? Well, this is what you’ve gotta do. You’re gonna be playing this bowling alley in Nebraska next. Good luck.\"\n\nMARY LOU LORD: [singer/songwriter; tourmate; KRS labelmate]: Slim really liked this kid. We were all together on a bill; me, Slim, and Elliott. I was backstage, just talking to everybody, and Slim said, “Mary Lou, you really need to go out and watch that guy.” I wasn't very interested; I had heard a million acoustic guitar guys, you know? But Slim was like, “No, Mary Lou, you really need to go and watch him.” In other words, “Shut the fuck up and get out there.”\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that his guitar was really crappy; I think it might have been the Le Domino he recorded Roman Candle on. I realized he was making that crappy guitar sound really good. By the third song, I had completely lost myself. I was sucked in. I immediately invited him on tour. And he mumbled, in his way, “OK, Mary Lou.”\n\nWatch Smith play \"The Biggest Lie\" live circa 1995; footage shot by Mary Lou Lord:\n\nSLIM MOON: The biggest bands that Kill Rock Stars ever put out each got their momentum in a different way. Sleater-Kinney's biggest momentum was from the press—that, second to Radiohead, they got more positive press than any other band in America in the 90s. With the Decemberists, it was the public: The indie rock record-buyers, the kids, went crazy for that band, but critics kind of shrugged at the time. When Elliott Smith came out, it was falling on deaf ears. But artists were reacting to it. So there was a Fugazi interview where they mentioned that they'd heard the record and liked it. And then John Doe took Elliott on tour, and Sebadoh took Elliott on tour, and in a Beastie Boys SPIN interview, they mentioned his record.\n\nLOU BARLOW [frontman, Sebadoh]: He opened solo for Sebadoh in ‘96, and it was at a time when no one really knew about him. We were at our peak at that point, and people just talked right through his set. It would make me really angry. I'd be like, \"What the hell are you doing talking through his set? It's Elliott Smith! He's great!\" I had that feeling like, “Someday you idiots will shut up and listen to him.” I remember telling him, \"People won't shut up, it's making me so angry.\" And he's like, \"I like it better this way. It makes me less self-conscious.\"\n\nSTEVEN DROZD [drummer/multi-instrumentalist, the Flaming Lips]: I met Elliott in '96. I was on that Sebadoh tour with Those Bastard Souls. I was very intimidated by him when I first met him. He just seemed like such a fucking serious dude. He was kind of a nobody back then, but he already had something about him. Between him and Lou Barlow, I was pretty struck. I treaded lightly.\n\nREBECCA GATES [singer/guitarist, the Spinanes]: We toured together for [The Spinanes’] Strand in 1996. I would never really sit down and play, except for during soundcheck and shows, but when we showed up anywhere, Elliott would just start playing guitar, whether he was writing, or practicing, or just playing covers. It wasn't like, \"Here I am, check me out!\" It was just to himself. He was someone who was always thinking about songwriting.\n\nWe were a pretty silly crew on tour. One time I was sitting shotgun in the van with my head in a book, and I heard all this snickering behind me. I turned around and [Elliott] had taken electric tape and made an Abe Lincoln beard on his face. And every time I kept turning around, more people had this electric tape facial hair.\n\nMARY LOU LORD: We both applied to South By Southwest around 1995 and we got turned down. So I said, \"Elliott, who are those assholes to tell us we can't play?\" I had this little busking amp I kept in my car at all times, just in case. So we drove down there and found a little place to play near the Driskill Hotel. I kind of wore the pants on that tour [laughs], and Elliott was like, \"I don't know about this, Mary Lou.\" And I was like, \"That's enough outta you. We're going to have our own little showcase out in front of this Kinko's.\"\n\nWe got a bunch of booze and started playing. I wish to god somebody had recorded this, because it was St. Patrick's Day, and Elliott was playing all kinds of Irish songs and Pogues songs. We'd take turns, and we played all night and got happily shit-faced. The people who actually had a showcase at Kill Rock Stars came by; Slim was there. It was one of the best nights of my life.\n\nSLIM MOON: It was particularly great at that time because her and Elliott had been touring together and were really tight. There was always a huge, huge circle of people around them.\n\nMIKE DOUGHTY [frontman, Soul Coughing]: I saw Elliott in New York with the Magnetic Fields on the same bill. No one had heard of either them. It was literally a life-changing show. I was like, \"I don't want to do Soul Coughing anymore. I want to do this—when I grow up, I want to be this man.\" I went out the next day to whatever groovy-people record store was closest and bought Roman Candle and Elliott Smith.\n\nThe thing that I always keep in mind is the hiss from the tape on Elliott Smith; those were not sounds that an engineer would be particularly proud of. And there's some lyrics from \"Christian Brothers\" that I want to put up in neon across the length of Metropolitan Ave. in Brooklyn: \"No bad dream fucker's gonna boss me around.\" I'm getting chills right now just saying that.\n\nI met him shortly after that. We were at [Manhattan venue] Brownie's and we were talking songwriting and records. At the time, he didn't do drugs, and I didn't drink, which kind of limited our hang. But I remember him saying, “Why are there no more drummers that just pound out the two and the four on the snare, like on old Sam Cooke records? Why do drummers have to be complicated?\" And you can hear that on his records and in his own drumming. He hit the snare on the two and the four and then hit a ride cymbal every once in a while for emphasis. He didn't need some crazy attention-drawing drum part to make the song a song.\n\nI just wanted to do something with him, and between Either/Or and XO, he came down to my studio. I sat him in front of a binaural head, which is this grey foam sculpture of a human head with two specialized microphones in each ear hole that has this incredibly realistic stereo effect. So we sat down in front of this ludicrous device and he sang two songs, which became other songs later—one was \"The record that plays over and over/ There's a kid in the story below\" lines from \"Bottle Up and Explode!\" The other one ended up as \"Going Nowhere”. I didn't have anything good to add to them, but I have these a cappella versions. I wish I knew where I put them.\n\nLOU BARLOW: I related to him in a lot of ways because when he was in the zone of performing acoustically, he was just hunched over. I mean, the guy didn't really ever look up. There was none of this, \"I'm a performer,\" you know? Almost no acknowledgement. There was almost an anger that I really related to.\n\nI remember he was soundchecking in Philadelphia at the Theatre of Living Arts. I would always watch his soundchecks, so I was sitting there, and he covered \"Thirteen\" by Big Star. It just brought me to tears. Music doesn't always bring me to tears; if I hear \"Love\" by John Lennon at a vulnerable moment it will bring me to tears. His version of \"Thirteen\" was devastating in that empty theater. I don’t think he even knew I was there.\n\nWatch Smith cover Big Star's \"Thirteen\" at a Sydney, Australia, show in 1999:\n\nDORIEN GARRY [friend, publicist at Girlie Action Media]: I first met him around 1995, when I was 17 or 18 and working the door at Maxwell’s. It was a Sunday night, and he was on tour with the Softies. Not very many people showed up to the gig. None of those guys had a place to stay, and I lived in kind of a halfway house for musicians in Jersey City at the time, so they stayed there for the night.\n\nTotally coincidentally, within the next six months or so, I got hired at Girlie Action to do publicity and I worked for him. I handled the college fanzine stuff, and we became pretty close during that short span of time. Elliott and I both collected and read fanzines.\n\nIn the beginning, that part was actually sort of fun for him, because it was like a game. It took a long time for him to develop a love-hate relationship with the press room. So he would tell me a list of fanzines that he wished some day would interview him, and then we’d see if we could make it happen. That was such a different time in the music industry. There was no internet; fanzines were our internet—and using the post office was our information superhighway, I guess. [laughs]\n\nBecause we were friends, he was able to tell me what he was and wasn't comfortable with. The more attention he got, the more troubled he got, and that’s when it got hard. The irony of it was that he was so open and honest with pretty much anybody who crossed his path, so it wasn't unlike him to tell a very personal, private story to a virtual stranger sitting next to him at a bar.\n\nBut it would infuriate him when people asked him what his lyrics were about. He really hated having to have an answer for what every character and every story was. Music was a way of channeling thoughts and feelings that were bigger than him into art, and he didn’t feel like he owed every single person an explanation of what everything was about.\n\nI mean, “Needle in the Hay” is obviously about drugs and despair. But I when I got to know him better, I learned that song was more about what was going on in the Pacific Northwest in the small music community in the early 90s and how badly drugs were infiltrating it.\n\nLARRY CRANE: His lyrics are parables and observations. The biggest mistake people make is assuming his songs are all confessional. It's his own life, but it's a lot of allegory. You see recurring characters in his songs.\n\nJJ GONSON: It always surprised me which pictures of mine that he loved. That one of people falling that's on the front of Elliott Smith—he loved that one, and I wouldn't have even noticed it.\n\nREBECCA GATES: When I sang backup vocals on \"St. Ides Heaven\", he was so focused on how he wanted things to sound. I have a weird way of singing harmonies sometimes and I just remember him remarking on that: \"Ah, I wouldn't have gone for that note, but it works great.” Maybe this has shifted now with digital recording, but the one thing that was really special about having those chances to record back then was that it didn't happen all the time. It was this really lovely space that you created.\n\nLOU BARLOW: When I would play Elliott's music in the house, my wife at the time was pissed. She's like, \"This sounds like Sebadoh! It sounds like your acoustic stuff!\" She was just livid about it. I couldn't really hear it, though; I heard much more of a folk tradition with him, and his music was more elaborate, where my stuff tended to be simpler.\n\nEither/Or (1997)\n\nEither/Or, Smith’s final album for Kill Rock Stars, is released on February 25, 1997. Portions of it are recorded at his then-girlfriend Joanna Bolme’s house; at Mary Lou Lord’s home studio; and in the basement of engineer/producer Larry Crane. Smith and Crane, after becoming friends, go onto build and open Jackpot! Recording Studio.\n\nLARRY CRANE: I kind of knew who Elliott was through Joanna [Bolme], because she worked at La Luna. We were throwing some random party, and everyone was sitting around the backyard having a barbecue. Joanna and Elliott were there, and that’s when I first remember showing them my home studio, and Elliott saying, \"Oh, I have the same tape deck as you, maybe I could come over here and do some vocals over that.\" The next thing I know, we were tracking the vocals for “Pictures of Me”. When we recorded that song, I remember turning to him and saying, “Oh, you like the Zombies?\"\n\nWe both wanted to go in on a studio together. I had this beat-up little Toyota pickup and we’d drive around Portland just looking through “For Rent” signs, listening to Simon & Garfunkel and the Left Banke. When we moved into the Jackpot! [Studio] space and started building it, we had a boombox with CDs and cassettes and we listened to all kinds of stuff: Television, the Saints. The only thing that drove him crazy was my obsession with Petula Clark. It didn’t really dawn on me for quite awhile that we were becoming friends.\n\nWe built the place in two weeks. Elliott was actually a professional mudder—he used to run around and do different jobs to do with mudding. And mudding is a pain in the ass. There's really an art to it, you have to be meticulous. I’m terrible at it. It was gonna be my studio, my business, my name, but he was gonna have a pro-rated deal. A lot of the people that helped do all the work—we had a big room, we had to put a wall up, paint, all that stuff—we just gave them recording time; you worked for an hour, you get an hour of recording time. We opened Jackpot! in February, 1997.\n\nRecording sessions were never really long and drawn out with him. Just three or four hours. If it wasn't going the right way, he'd say, \"Make a rough mix of it for me, and let's go get a drink.\" Back then, it felt more like college than work. There was also a lot of silly stuff. One day, he must have seen someone wearing a Big Dog sweatshirt—that brand—and he must have thought it was really funny, because for no reason, he kept going around the studio puffing his chest out and repeating, “I'm a big dog.” He wouldn’t stop until it cracked us up.\n\nSomething else funny: A friend dropped off a Casio guitar made out of rubber, and I was supposed to give it to someone but I kept it around. And Elliott loved that thing. He would always strap it on and play, like, Stevie Wonder's “Superstition”. You can actually hear it on \"Bled White”; it makes a neener-wheeee sound. He decided he had to bring it to L.A. to show Jon Brion.\n\nDORIEN GARRY: He's been turned into somewhat of an icon, but he was actually a total goofball most of the time. He would prank call me and leave me voicemails. This was before cell phones, so I'd come home and there'd be a message that was him basically doing a whole Jerky Boys skit on the answering machine.\n\nAnd he had a real thing about clowns—being fascinated and intrigued by clowns, trying not be scared of clowns. It was a constant joke: Clowns are weird. Clowns are cool. Clowns are rad. When I saw that story recently about the scary clown in Northampton who’s been terrorizing people, the first thing I thought was, “Man, I wish Elliott was here for this.”\n\nWe watched All That Jazz together once. It was the rare night where I convinced him to stay home with me and not go out. We both loved it. The main character, who's wreaking havoc on this dance community, is wearing this black leather armband. Halfway through the movie, Elliott's like, \"I really like that huge bracelet thing.\" I'm like, \"Yeah, it's pretty badass.\" And then the next day he's like, \"Do you know where I can go get a scrap of leather?\" So that's basically where the whole leather armband trend of the 90s came from—Elliott seeing All That Jazz.\n\nLARRY CRANE: We recorded a lot of cool stuff just incidentally. Someone would always be milling about, and then he'd just say, \"Hey, can you help me track this?\" That's actually how \"Miss Misery\" came about. He laid down the instrumental and then made a cassette of it. And then at some point he came back from out of town and said, “Hey, play us that one song.” And I’m like, “Which one?” But we put it up and he put all the vocals on it that day.\n\nWhenever we did an early version of a song, he would say “I need to send out a probe.\" So we'd leave a track open just for him to hear and sing along. He would look for the notes that needed harmonies, and then we’d roll the tape and he’d sing them. He was obsessive about stuff like that. When we were tracking vocals for “Pictures of Me\", I was amazed how many layers he built up. The music was all on two tracks, and the other six tracks ended up being vocals. I was like, \"That's a little excessive!\" [laughs]\n\nI’ve seen very few people that are solo multi-instrumentalist artists that can really work that way. It was very much like a Brian Wilson thing where he locked in. He would be playing a song on guitar and then he’d say, “Maybe this would be better on piano.” And in a split-second he walks over and starts playing it on piano.\n\nROB SCHNAPF: We recorded “Between the Bars”, “Angeles”, and “Say Yes” at [Schnapf and Rothrock’s Humboldt County, California, studio] the Shop. He would record one live take of vocal and guitar together, and then he would just double to it once we got it. It was just absurd. The guitar stuff isn’t even easy. It was ridiculous that he was able to just nail a vocal and guitar performance live, and he was able to double it live again. I mean, it’s not like he’s strumming G, C, D. There’s intricate little fills. It sounds so natural, and so simple—then you try to play it. And sing at the same time. He was just really good. Understated, but really good.\n\nI loved \"Angeles\". I was excited to be able to record it. We took that one organ note, which he had previously recorded, and looped it. It’s that one pedal tone, and it really felt like… something. I don’t always try to operate on the intellectual level; I like to keep it in the land of feelings and then think about it afterwards if I need to. Recording “Angeles” was a good feeling.\n\nLUKE WOOD [DreamWorks A&R]: The most available example of Elliott's skill as a writer, and his way with metaphor, is probably \"Between the Bars\". It works on three layers. It's about love, at first, or it seems to be; you could look at it literally, being about going out for a night out at the bars; the imagery could easily be about prison; and, of course, it's potentially about addiction. The clarity and continuity of thought is amazing—he can take a metaphor like that and sing about it for three minutes and never leave.\n\nJJ GONSON: He recorded Either/Or partly at my studio, which was a funny thing because, at that point, we weren't actually speaking to each other. But for months, he was next door to where I worked, so I could hear all these songs being made because my office shared a wall with where he was recording. It was hell. Good songs, though. Really good songs.\n\nMARY LOU LORD: Honestly, I don't even know which songs for Either/Or he recorded at my house. [laughs] We had a room set up at my place, and he basically had a studio in it. Whenever he would come over, he would disappear into it for hours and hours, and we wouldn't disturb him. There were a lot of times where it was like, you know, \"Where's Elliott?\" And that's what he'd be doing. It was constant. He did that wherever he was; it wasn't just at my house.\n\nJJ GONSON: That was around the time he was breaking away from Heatmiser. It's too bad, he wasn’t actually aware that you could have a conversation with somebody and say, \"Look, I want to do some music that isn't Heatmiser, so I want to do this.\" Instead, he would just shut down and not say anything. So it was all done in this very underhanded way. I don't want to be disparaging of him, but this is just unfortunately how he operated. And then when we split up, I kept trying to juggle his solo career with the band, but I didn't have any communication at that point because he wouldn't let me talk to his manager [Margaret Mittleman]. Or he wouldn't let her talk to me. Or something. And the fact that he and I had broken up and were tearing each other into tiny little pieces emotionally—or at least he was tearing me, I can't speak for him—didn't help.\n\nThe way I looked at it: I managed Heatmiser. It was my place as their manager to make sure that they had shows to make money, and that things were scheduled properly, and that the relationship went well with all of our representatives, our label, our booking agent. As he did more and more solo shows, he disconnected from me and from the band. And I know that there were times where Elliott had songs that he wasn't taking to the band because I lived with him.\n\nIt was hard for me as their manager because I knew there was something destructive going on, and I made a decision to support him as a musician and respect his wish that I didn't share this information. But I also knew that the band was done, because he wasn't willing to communicate. I couldn't make a rational decision about how best to manage that situation, so I just tried my best to keep things moving forward and get the bills and taxes paid.\n\nTony [Lash] and I were like: \"We just have to keep it friendly, keep moving, get this record done.\" Because they had signed a contract with Virgin Records and they had obligations to fulfill. They were supposed to be supporting a record, so they booked a tour, and then Elliott bailed, as I recall. We're like, \"What?!\" This was after he and I had broken up, and he said, \"I am prioritizing my solo career over the band.\" It was pretty shocking to everyone, because the band had worked really hard for a number of years. It could have been both.\n\nTONY LASH: It was almost mid-tour with Heatmiser when he really wanted to change up the sound of the band. This might've been the genesis of struggles between the two of us, because I was resistant to that, but it was mostly because, as a drummer, I liked playing rock stuff; playing quieter music wasn't really my strong point back then, so I was hesitant. He was immediately frustrated. During that whole time, I remember enjoying playing concerts less, but thinking the music was a lot better.\n\nI didn't pay a whole lot of attention to Either/Or, because he was recording and finishing it just as tensions were highest. I still haven't really listened to that album. We went down to California to shoot a video for \"Plainclothes Man\" and I drove around with him and he played it for me. I thought it was good, but there was just a lot of tension at that point.\n\nLOU BARLOW: Somehow, we ended up doing the overnight drive from Phoenix to San Diego together in his car when we were touring together. We just talked the whole time, and that was probably the closest I got to him at that point. At that time in Sebadoh, I was like, \"I gotta kick the drummer out. This sucks. He's a really good friend.\" He'd had some issues moving forward from Heatmiser because those were his buds, and going solo was a big change for him. We discussed changing and sometimes leaving your friends behind for the sake of moving forward creatively and artistically. He was a really smart guy.\n\nOn the cover of Either/Or, he's standing in front of this mirror, and I was there the night that picture was taken; our tour manager took that picture, and she also took an identical picture of Sebadoh, with the exact same angle. I've gotta find that somewhere.\n\nMARGARET MITTLEMAN: When he opened for Mark Eitzel from American Music Club at Brownies in New York in ‘97. He finally got the room to be quiet. That was the big challenge; there was this core audience that would sit up front and be quiet, but at the bar people would be talking and the cash register would be going. There was a Troubadour show where people asked the bar not to ring up anything on the cash register during his set. You could hear a pin drop. That was the first time I remember the vibe being different. People weren't just there to see this next big thing. It was, “I need to see this guy.”\n\nSLIM MOON: One of the side effects of his popularity as a solo artist, which also was a side effect of Heatmiser breaking up, was that Virgin no longer had this attitude like: \"It's fine if he does this little solo thing on the side because it's not very important.\" Now that they thought of his solo career as valuable, he was really unhappy with Virgin, so he wanted to leave and go elsewhere. My own perception was that although it kind of sucks to be stuck in a contract you signed a long time ago, when you're having success, it gives you some leverage. I felt like it was a good problem to have; he may have just felt like it was a problem.\n\nXO (1998)\n\nIn 1997, Elliott Smith is bought out of his Virgin contract by DreamWorks. He settles into Sunset Studio, on Sunset Boulevard—the studio where Rolling Stones' Exile on Main Street*,* Led Zeppelin II and IV*, and Beck's* Odelay were recorded , among others—with producers Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock to begin sessions for XO*, his DreamWorks debut. *\n\nLUKE WOOD: Someone gave me Roman Candle from Cavity Search when it came out. I was just starting to do A&R in the record business, and I remember being in my Volvo 240 in Silverlake, which is every bit the cliche it sounds like, sitting in front of my house playing the songs over and over again. It was the punkest record I had heard in so long. He played it on an acoustic guitar, but the lyrics were so intense, and his voice was so believable. At the time, if I remember correctly, he was listed under his birth name of Steven Smith. I called him up; I was working at Geffen Records at the time, and he was in Heatmiser. He was really sweet and very appreciative, but said, \"I'm cool, thank you very much.\" I didn't speak to him again until maybe 1997. By then, I was pretty much fanatical. Elliott Smith and Either/Or had come out, and both of those were my favorite records of those respective years. So when I went to DreamWorks to start my A&R career, Elliott was foremost on my mind.\n\nLENNY WARONKER [DreamWorks co-CEO]: Tom [Rothrock] and Rob [Schnapf] came to see me when we first started DreamWorks. They played us Elliott Smith, among other things. It was something from Either/Or, I think, and I said, \"What the hell is that?\" Just the sound of his double-tracked voice and the acoustic guitar was so unique—maybe there was some George Harrison in there, but what he was doing was uniquely his. And they said, \"No, that's not available.\"\n\nIt was pretty much predetermined that he was gonna move from Heatmiser, but there was still the Virgin/Capitol part, and Elliott had to sort of do that himself. He had a contractual obligation there, both as Heatmiser and as a solo artist. I had a meeting with Margaret and the President of Capitol Records, Gary Gersh, who was very cool. He didn't want to force somebody to stay with him. He knew how great Elliott was, and did what he could to keep him, but he didn't want to do it over a gun.\n\nLater on, Margaret, Elliott, and I met for lunch. The first 40 minutes of that meeting were really rough because he's so shy and doesn't say much. He had an orchestration book under his arm and I actually pointed to it said, \"What do you have there?\" That opened the conversation and then it was a good solid hour of talking about music and some of the artists that I had been associated with that really affected him. He was saying, \"I'm gonna start thinking about using an orchestra on my record.\" He was testing my response, I think. So I went into my Randy Newman and Van Dyke Parks speech about how interesting it is when you orchestrate and go beyond just rock, and I think that pushed some of his concerns aside. I mentioned the right artists, and he relaxed.\n\nMARGARET MITTLEMAN: It definitely started with Lenny. Elliott felt good knowing it was one of the top guys behind him, because it was a big, big jump.\n\nROB SCHNAPF: Here’s the thing about Either/Or: It could easily have been bigger-sounding. We could have blown it up more, but he wasn’t ready to do it just yet. He was heading that direction, though. Elliott never did anything he didn’t want to do. With XO, we didn’t have any specific conversation about it, but I could tell: He was just ready.\n\nTONY LASH: Maybe he kept things low-key in the beginning as a deliberate way to distinguish his solo material from Heatmiser. I can only speculate, but it seemed like that to me. So, freed from the constraints of Heatmiser, he could incorporate whatever he wanted into his songs.\n\nLENNY WARONKER: He never felt intimidated musically and he was quite open about things in the studio. We didn't stop by often, but when I was there, if I had a thought—even if it was bad—he would listen. It was almost like he was taking notes. I made some reference to the Beach Boys at one point, suggesting the possibility of adding an odd instrument, maybe a woodwind, and rather than either file it away or just go \"no,\" he was intrigued by it.\n\nThe harmonies and the vocal parts were so much more predominant on XO, and that gift, along with all the other gifts that he had, was a surprise. It shouldn't have been; you could tell from his earlier records that it was there, but not to that degree. He completely stepped up. I was so taken by what he was doing.\n\nHis stuff was always so precise. Most great songwriters are very economic, and he was, outside of Randy Newman... well, I shouldn't say it this way. But he was as good as it gets when you're talking about layers within lyrics. There was so much in it with so few words, and as fragile he sounded, he was in complete command.\n\nROB SCHNAPF: He was brisk in the studio. Speed was never the focus, but at the end of day one we had “Waltz #1” basically done. We came back the next day and added that big old bass drum to it, and added strings to it after that, but the meat of the song—vocals, everything—was done.\n\nSongs would just come up. Maybe they weren’t necessarily written in the studio, but they'd be written while we’re making the record. It’s hard for me to say exactly what the deal is, but in this case there was a convergence of inspiration and it made something happen. A lot of times, I think he had stuff kicking around for years. His dad had told me they were very similar in that way, because his dad was a painter. He was like, \"I work on a painting and then I put it away for 10 years, and all of a sudden I know how to finish it.\" So he carried bits around.\n\nTONY LASH: There was a song on XO that was probably the best song we did, as Harum Scarum, back in 1989 or 1990. He reworked it for XO, and turned it into \"Everybody Cares, Everybody Understands\". The old song was called \"Catholic\". That was surprising to me. I think he ended up doing more of that later, pulling out really old ideas and reworking them.\n\nLARRY CRANE: I was there when they did the horns and string overdubs on XO. They brought [string arrangers] Shelly Berg and Tom Halm in to flush out the ideas that Elliott had played out on a keyboard the week before. He gave them the MIDI files and talked to them about what he wanted, and they went and arranged it and played us these synthetic strings, as a mockup. Elliott was silent the whole time. Then we shake hands and say “OK, we’ll see you at the string session in a couple days.\" The minute we're back in the suite, Elliott turns to me and says, \"Oh man, I don't like what he added, but I don't want to offend the guy.\" And Tom [Rothrock] overheard that and was like, \"Wait a minute, what did you say to Larry!?\" So we march back there, and Elliott tells them what he doesn't like, and Shelly says, \"Yeah, you basically stripped it back to what you gave us in the first place.”\n\nI’m a lot more cavalier, I guess; if it’s a hired-gun arranger, and I have to change or throw away what they're doing, I don’t give a fuck—the only thing that matters is if the artist is happy and the record comes out as good as we can make it. I was blown away that he would even half-think that way. He just didn’t want to ever have an issue or conflict or bum other people out, but by doing that, ironically, he usually bummed people out anyway. He could be really stern with me, and he would be stubborn, within Heatmiser, about what he wanted.\n\nWatch the video for XO's \"Baby Britain\":\n\nAround this time, Smith contributes the original song “Miss Misery” to the Good Will Hunting soundtrack. Soon after XO sessions are underway, they are interrupted by the news that the track has been nominated for an Oscar.\n\nGUS VAN SANT [director, Good Will Hunting]: I knew about Heatmiser, and I saw them one time at Pine Street [later changed to La Luna], which was the center of a lot of alternative bands during the 80s. But I didn't really know too much about their music. Mostly I had these these two CDs from my friend Steve Birch, who worked for a lot of bands because he was an artist and designed covers. He’d picked up a bunch of CDs for me from this store called Locals Only around 1994, and Roman Candle was in the pile. Elliott’s music was something I just happened to put on at one point. It reminded me of Simon & Garfunkel. Although, before I met Elliott, someone said, “Don't mention Simon & Garfunkel to him.”\n\nAs I do with most films, I try and find some music that you could use throughout, not just a sampling of lots of different artists. And I thought it might be interesting to try that with Elliott. I told the editor, Pietro Scalia, who's now one of the most expensive editors in Hollywood, to try his music and it just worked. As soon as we decided we really did want it for sure, the next step was to ask Elliott whether that was OK. My boyfriend worked with Joanna in a bar, so he got me the number and I just called him up.\n\nLARRY CRANE: I was out running errands or doing something, and I come back around and Elliott goes, “Oh, Gus Van Sant came over and I played him that song we recorded.” And I’m just like, “What! I wasn’t here?!\"\n\nJJ GONSON: I remember hearing vaguely about Good Will Hunting, early on. I knew Gus was in town, I think. Elliott and I weren’t speaking much by then. He started dating Joanna and just as I was his world, she was now his world. I certainly didn't hang out with him. We were not friends at that point.\n\nLARRY CRANE: The studio asked if we had anything original and unreleased we could put in there, and we played them \"Miss Misery\", and they thought it was great. Later, I was in the middle of a session, and I got this phone call like, “This guy’s going to show up to grab the tape.” They put a guy on a plane in L.A., and he flew up, and got in a limo—it wasn’t just a goddamn cab, it was a *limo—*and pulled up in front of the studio later that same day. He grabs that one reel, jumps in the car, and goes back to the airport to fly back to L.A. What a joke.\n\nRob Schnapf and Tom [Rothrock] remixed the song down there, and then they basically had to pretend that it had been written for the movie in order to get an Oscar nomination. Elliott couldn't say it was actually tracked before he'd even heard of Good Will Hunting! It doesn’t matter now, you know? [laughs]\n\nSLIM MOON: Either/Or came out in February of '97, and Good Will Hunting came out later that year. But I had put out a lot of expensive records all in one year, and had kind of overdone it, and we were a small operation. It was just three of us in an apartment, and I didn't have any line of credit or anything. I had gotten myself in a situation where I owed the manufacturer of the records a tremendous amount of money, and it was going to be four months before I started to see money trickling in from all of it. I had really screwed up.\n\nSo I was in my bedroom at the Las Vegas Hilton, of all places, at the National Association of Recording Merchandisers convention—I wasn't there just gambling away the money that I didn't have [laughs]—when Elliott's publisher called me and said he'd been nominated for an Oscar. That saved our business.\n\nROB SCHNAPF: I remember going into the studios and doing vocals and piano on “Miss Misery” pretty early in on XO, and all of a sudden he gets nominated for an Oscar and it just changes everything. It became really hard for him because, for one, he’s playing everything, so he never has a break: Elliott plays drums, then plays bass, then plays guitar, then plays piano, then sings. And before that, he would have interviews from like 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. talking to people, international press, all over the place.\n\nMARGARET MITTLEMAN: All of a sudden, he had to do interviews for Us and People and all these magazines that wouldn’t have touched him. And they don't care who you are. They just want to talk about this one song. We were trying to focus on recording XO, but my memory of that time is all about just getting him to sit down in the lounge of Sunset Sound to do interviews.\n\nGUS VAN SANT: As soon as the nominations came out, all of us were assigned different campaign duties. Elliott played in a little club in TriBeCa near the Weinstein Company, which was partly organized by the movie promotion. It was just a simple thing, but it wasn't his own thing, so he was all nervous. He didn't really know what to wear, so he just put on some slacks. With his schedule, he didn't have a place to change, so he changed on the subway platform and got reprimanded by a cop.\n\nMARGARET MITTLEMAN: We had to go to Capitol Studios and rehearse with the orchestra for the Oscar performance. They were impressed with his knowledge working with an orchestra and writing out his piece. We had a trailer, which was a trip to him. We saw the stage and what the audience was going to look like; there were all the signs on the chairs saying who was going to sit where.\n\nThey were trying to figure out how he would come out, how to make him perform. They wanted him to sit on the set of stairs that everyone would walk up to get to the podium, and we tried that. They really wanted him to be the guy who comes out and sits on the stairs. I walked out to [Oscars producer] Gil Cates, kind of shaking and saying, “I’m sorry, that can’t happen. He’s not going to do that.” Elliott wouldn’t say anything, so I had to do all that, which was very stressful.\n\nROB SCHNAPF: It was scary because they were like, “We want you to play with a rope as a guitar strap.” “Nah, I don’t want to do that.” “Well that’s what we want you to do.” “Well, I don’t want to do that.” “I want you to sit on the steps.” “Nah, I don’t want to do that.” There was this feeling: “Well, we’re the Oscars, who are you?”\n\nLARRY CRANE: The Oscars people came to Margaret and said he’s only going to be playing a verse and a chorus, and Elliott was like, “I don’t want to do it then.\" Simple as that. So they said they’d just get someone else to play his song: “Here’s Billy Joel!” Or it’s Matt Damon in a top hat.\n\nMARGARET MITTLEMAN: The day of the ceremony, me, Rob, Joanna, and Elliott pulled up to where all the limos were pulling up, and I was trying to figure out how to get Elliott down the red carpet, which was chaotic. The four of us started to walk down one side, but Rob and I got pulled away, like, “This is the side you go on.” The photographers were just trying to figure Elliott out. Nobody knew who he was.\n\nGUS VAN SANT: He had a white suit, and it was kind of amazing. As soon as the curtains parted, I saw that the entire stage was decorated as the Titanic. I thought, \"Oh, I see.\" Hollywood was so excited that they had a movie that grossed a billion dollars and they were gonna show it. So Celine Dion had a full orchestra. Elliott had a little bit of an orchestra, too, but it was all very tiny in comparison. They used a lot of fog for the show, presumably because it was the Titanic, and it made me very sick—three hours of that stuff blowing on you and you just get a severe hangover.\n\nMARGARET MITTLEMAN: We met Matt Damon and Minnie Driver. Minnie started hanging out with him after that—I think they may have had a little thing for a while. I don’t know if it was anything serious, or if she just got into his music. Then there was the Governors Ball dinner that everybody goes to right after the whole event ends, which was pretty hilarious. We sat with Fay Wray, who was in the original King Kong. Elliott met that guy who played the detective in Jackie Brown, Robert Forster, too.\n\nBut the highlight of that event for Elliott was that Celine Dion made him feel comfortable, from backstage to onstage. It really was amazing. She made him really feel at home, like he was one of them.\n\nROB SCHNAPF: Celine Dion was really awesome to him. She really was.\n\nWatch Smith perform \"Miss Misery\" at the Oscars in 1998:\n\nLARRY CRANE: I knew it had no chance in hell of winning. I was hoping it would, but come on; it’s up against the song from Titanic. It’s funny, the woman I’m married to now was my friend at the time, and she came and picked me up and we went and watched the Oscars at La Luna. We had so much history with Elliott and Joanna there, and it was awesome because it was queer night at La Luna, so we went and watched it with all these wonderfully raging queens, who were like, “Oh look, there she is, oh my god, she’s beautiful!” whenever someone came onstage.\n\nGUS VAN SANT: The Oregonian wrote a really catty review of the Oscars saying they were boring, and that Elliott's appearance was “grunge lite.” They were just making fun of the whole thing. But through all the sort of showbiz-y stuff associated with the Oscars, he was happy that it was the one thing that his mother could tell her friends her son had done. He was a singer, yes, but now he'd been nominated for an Academy Award. He was really happy.\n\nWe mostly went our separate ways after that. I went to a show at the El Rey and, I think because I was a movie guy, I was always looked at like, \"What's this guy doing here? Who the fuck does he think he is?\" I didn't find a comforting home in his music crowd.\n\nREBECCA GATES: If one of your friends is suddenly performing on the Oscars, there's a sense that something's shifted: a shift in opportunities, a shift in who's paying attention. I just loved that he was hanging out with Celine Dion. He was like, \"Hey guys, you get so many weird gifts when you go the Oscars.\" He felt weird about it; it was a cool thing, but it was a weird thing. There's a part of being good friends where you try to keep things normalized. We just said, \"You looked hilarious up on stage. You did a good job, it was excellent.\"\n\nDORIEN GARRY: He had tremendously low self-esteem, so it was very awkward for him to all of a sudden be revered by so many strangers. Ultimately, I think that was the hardest and most confusing thing for him. He couldn't understand what the big deal was, I guess.\n\nMARGARET MITTLEMAN: There was definitely a pace with Elliott, like, “We’ll get there. Can we just take it a step at a time?” It was my job to get everybody on board with that. He eventually did everything he was supposed to do. Most of it he knew he wouldn’t like, but he did it. Lenny and Luke never really complained.\n\nLUKE WOOD: He was extremely reluctant about promotion in general, but it wasn't because he thought he was too good for it, or because he thought it was selling out. It was really because he felt like the music should speak for itself, and everything else was redundant and irrelevant and silly. “Why do I talk about ‘Waltz #2’? Listen to the song!” He really believed what the song meant to you is what it meant.\n\nI think what Elliott wanted out of his situation was the capital afforded from a major label, because there were things he wanted to do creatively. He tried to find the place that had the most patience and would fuck with him the least; he never wanted to feel like he was singing for his supper. I will say, I felt like he did enjoy the shows. He was reluctant occasionally, when the monitors weren't great or something else was off, because he was a perfectionist and that stuff would drive him crazy. But he'd often come back after a show with a smile on his face and say, \"That was fun tonight, I really enjoyed it.\"\n\nSTEVEN DROZD: We ended up doing some shows in Sweden together with Elliott playing with his full band around '99. I was in pretty bad shape at that point, but we just really hit it off, and next thing I knew we were getting drunk and playing acoustic guitars on his tour bus, driving through Sweden. As miserable as I was on tour at that time—I was really strung out and I couldn't get anything in Scandinavia, and I was going two or three days without really sleeping—he and I would drink whiskey and play Elton John and Big Star songs at four o'clock in the morning on the tour bus. It was incredible.\n\nHe and I did ecstasy on the tour bus one night and we were listening to Elton John's Greatest Hits. His favorite was actually \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\", so we played that one a lot. My favorite Elton John song is \"Daniel\"; my son is named Daniel and he's partly named after my wife's father, but also partly named after that song. So we get to that song and Elliott stops it, and I'm like, \"Hey, what are you doing?\" He says, \"Man, I never liked that fuckin' song. Who is this fuckin' Daniel guy, anyway.\" I try to tell him it's this character whose brother had been to Vietnam, and how they cut out the last verse because it was too weird, trying to sell him. He wasn't having any of it. \"I don't give a shit! Fuck 'Daniel', we're skipping 'Daniel.\"\n\nFigure 8 (2000)\n\nIn 1999, as touring for XO winds down, Smith begins working on what would eventually become its ambitious follow-up, Figure 8*.*\n\nAUTUMN DE WILDE [photographer, cover art and inserts for Figure 8*; director, “Son of Sam” video; author of the 2007 photo book* Elliott Smith]: We first met because I knew his manager, Margaret Mittleman. Later, we met on the street in New York and hung out that whole night. Someone had spray painted “freak” in a bunch of places in New York, and he thought it was funny, so the next morning, I took some pictures of him standing in front of the word “freak.” It was a very unofficial beginning. I was in no way pursuing work.\n\nPhotos by Autumn de Wilde\n\nA bunch of time passed and then my manager asked me to submit my portfolio, which was mostly photos of my friends, for Figure 8; I had a photo of Steve Malkmus from being on tour with them, and some photos of Beck, and probably the Eels. Then, at the back of that book was a photo of him, and he realized whose portfolio he was looking at.\n\nOne of my first questions was: “Do you want to change anything about how you're portrayed?” He immediately said, \"I feel like everybody thinks I just want to sit in little dark rooms and look depressed in my photos. There's never any color or light, but I love color so much.\" We talked about all the things he loved, like French New Wave. He was a cinephile and he had a great taste in movies.\n\nHe also mentioned being sick of his own clothes, so I said, \"Since this is accidentally your uniform because you didn’t want to dress up for photos, maybe we should put you in suits, but it should look like someone's suit who has been gambling for days and sleeping in it, the kind of suit that is a man’s uniform, not someone dressing up.\" I was really inspired by photos of the \"Forgotten Man\" during the Depression, when men were wearing the last suit that they had at the time, just trying not to starve to death. It's the kind of suit that is worn in the rain and shrinks on the body and becomes a second skin, which is different than someone who willfully dropped out.\n\nAt the time, I wasn’t thinking about the fact that he wore a suit in the \"Miss Misery\" video or at the Oscars. I was trying to come up with a way for him put on clothes that expressed an idea without feeling, like, “Elliott Smith is changing his image.\" He wasn’t worried about that, but I was. I didn’t want it to seem like I messed with something that didn't need messing with.\n\nIt soon became clear to me that I wasn’t dealing with someone who was worrying about how he looked, but rather someone who was making sure whatever it was we were doing was telling the right story: looking at what all these photos mean; not taking them if they don’t mean anything; making them have the right relationship with this record. That was the beginning of me feeling very lucky to be working with him.\n\nI was warned by Margaret that he probably only wanted to do the photoshoot for a few hours, and that I should try to get as many photos as I could. But we shot for like 12 hours. People always said that he didn’t like having his photo taken, but I think he didn’t like the process as it had been presented to him up until that point. With us, it was a creative process, and he really enjoyed it; it wasn’t just about 400 photos of Elliott Smith.\n\nLUKE WOOD: Elliott was living in my neighborhood in Silverlake at the time, and he demoed some of the Figure 8 songs at my house, because I had a small studio. He'd be there during the day while I was at work, and I would get to come home and hear these things as they came together, and literally look at his sketchpads of lyrics. Figure 8 is a very specific record. Just like XO, it's different lyrically and slightly more esoteric, but he had a real idea of what he wanted to say.\n\nIt was such a joy watching the thought he would put into small things as he wrote: Should it be \"to\" or should it be \"at?\" Should it be first-person or second-person? Should this be plural or singular? Where should I put the modifier? He would write five different versions of a sentence, only changing the modifier. His music was unbelievably well-thought-out.\n\n\"Son of Sam\" lyric sheet. Photo by Autumn de Wilde.\n\nAUTUMN DE WILDE: As far as the cover, I was trying to figure out how to bring color in without it feeling manufactured and artificial in his world. I said, “What if you are who you are, but you’re walking in front of something that doesn't match, like when you are having an argument with someone in front of a really colorful mural.” I grew up in L.A., so I had my first kiss with someone I loved in a parking lot of a Denny’s in Hollywood, and that became a symbol of our love. So I went out to take some pictures of locations.\n\nI went to a junior high down the street from the Figure 8 wall—well, now it's the Figure 8 wall; then it was The Sound Solutions wall. I have childhood memories of girls getting beat up in the parking lot of the McDonald's next to it. I took photos of a lot of murals and weird signs from Echo Park to Silverlake and asked him, \"What if this was our set?\" He loved that idea because it was like seeing something he saw every day and didn’t realize how amazing it was, which is a very Los Angeles thing: When you start narrowing your vision to one thing at a time, you start seeing little gems in the Los Angeles landscape.\n\nPhotos by Autumn de Wilde\n\nROB SCHNAPF: Figure 8 was recorded all over the place, not all at once. XO got really hard to do because of him playing everything, so for *Figure 8 * I said, \"When you have a batch of songs, let me go record them. We can do it in two-week spurts, that way it’s not this huge, epic burden on you.\" There was one batch where he did it all, another batch where Sam [Coomes] was more involved playing bass. Then we were in England at Abbey Road, and [drummer] Joey Waronker happened to be in town with R.E.M. and we cut a bunch of songs [with him].\n\nI had never been to Abbey Road before then, and I haven’t been back since. On one hand, it’s just a studio. But then I’m moving the U47 [microphone] around and I'm like, \"Wow, it’s got those pop filters just like in the Beatles book… oh, wait.\" All the same shit is in there. The whole week we were there there was this upright piano that sounded so familiar when you played it. I bugged the assistant and he would never tell me anything, but finally he relented and was like, “Uh, 'Penny Lane.'” And not only is it “Penny Lane”, it’s all those songs where you hear that tack piano—and not only Beatles stuff, like “Martha My Dear”. It’s also Odessey and Oracle and Pink Floyd and tons of others. When I got back home and started listening to records, I’m like, \"There’s that piano again.\" I have a picture of it on my refrigerator.\n\nAs it developed, I noticed that Figure 8 was less literal but more impressionistic lyrically and also texturally. There were parts of it that were a little more ethereal. For this record, I wanted to see what he would do with the Boomerang looper, which is a simple thing to make loops. I showed him how to use it and then all of a sudden I had all these little interlude pieces. So while Tom [Rothrock] and I were working on something that required Elliott, he’d be out making those loops, and we’d just use them as segues to get to different things. One turned into a song called “Dancing on the Highway”, which didn't make the record. It’s a really cool song.\n\nAUTUMN DE WILDE: He requested me to direct the \"Son of Sam\" video. I was shocked and I think DreamWorks was pretty shocked, too. I hadn’t directed a video before. To their credit, they rolled with it. It was inspired by La Jetée and The Red Balloon. I would never try to get rid of the sadness that was connected to his songs, but there is so much more in them—so much great poetry that represented abstract and direct ways of explaining how you feel to someone. Not everything was a diary. Some of it was role-playing, becoming other people and singing from their point of view.\n\nFor Elliott and I, the best part of this video was how funny it was trying to get this balloon to behave. If it was windy we were fucked, you know? I later found out that The Red Balloon had this giant puppeteering crane. Luckily, we did a test day. Somewhere, there is a clip of Elliott slapping his arms in dismay and being overwhelmed by the balloon hitting him in the face for like the 70th time. It was on one of those giant stairways in Echo Park that I think was in a Laurel and Hardy film, and he's at the top. He was just looking really pissed off, like he was gonna get in a fight with the balloon, and then laughing, and then angry again. The art director figured out you had to use fishing poles, and you can see it in one shot. At the end of the video, when the balloon dies, we all got really sad—and then we were laughing hysterically at how attached we had gotten to this badly behaved actor.\n\nTONY LASH: I didn't really dive into Figure 8 very deeply. I could feel the emotional remove when I heard it, and I really didn't like that. XO still seemed more emotionally engaged. I remember telling him that I thought \"Waltz #1\" was my favorite song on XO, and he was like, \"Yeah, that's the best one.\" That was a nice little re-bonding moment. Then the sound of Figure 8 was like: \"Here's a bunch of really good chord changes and notes.\" But it was missing that feeling of him directly engaging.\n\nDORIEN GARRY: That was the period where things got unhealthy for him physically. He had someone on his crew that was a bad influence. Not someone in his band, but someone who was working for him, who was notorious for getting musicians drugs and doing them with them. It was around the same time that the relationship he’d had cut him off from people for a while. I mean, I knew what a lot of that record was written about, and by that point everything felt so over the top and overwhelming that it was a little bit hard for me to just sit back and enjoy the music. Elliott definitely channelled whatever was wrong in his life or upsetting to him into his music like tenfold.\n\nLOU BARLOW: I saw him at a party in L.A., and he was actually a really good croquet player. I learned croquet from Elliott. Anyway, I said something like, \"I think I'm drinking too much.\" And he's like, \"Well, can you feel your liver?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"When you drink too much, you can feel your liver literally pulsing from your side.\" I was poking for it, trying to feel it, and he's like, \"Can you feel it?\" And I'm like, \"No! Where is it?\" He's showing me where it is and telling me when it gets really bad, it pops out the side. I think it's something his dad had told him. I was like, \"Man, I guess I'm really not that hardcore of a drinker—my liver isn't protruding from my chest.\"\n\nROB SCHNAPF: When he was on top of his game, none of that was happening. Did he drink? Yes. But when I go back and think about it, it started happening during Figure 8. It was not in the open. He was definitely not sharing it. But in retrospect, it explained some things.\n\nJJ GONSON: He wasn't doing any drugs or really drinking very much when we were together. A big part of what tore us apart was talking about wanting to do drugs. I was like, \"I just can't be around that.\" He didn't want me to tell him what not to do.\n\nDORIEN GARRY: There were a lot of people in Elliott's life during different times. I'm a lucky one in the sense that our friendship managed to stretch across many different phases, whereas a lot of people sort of got cut off or just were not part of it anymore. I maintained a friendship with him until he died. I mean, I live in Los Angeles now, and I'm not a fan of probably 75% of the people that call themselves Elliott's friends from L.A. I know the ones that are for real, who had healthy friendships with him. I'm always a little bit torn about speaking publicly about him—losing a friend like that is one of the most difficult things that's ever happened in my life. But if I don't do it, you know… the people who are eager and willing to talk are usually not the right people.\n\nFrom the very beginning, we had a sibling relationship. I met him when I was 18, and you don't really understand a lot of things in the world when you're 18. Emotionally, he was the most vulnerable person I'd ever met at that point. We took care of each other during not-so-fun times in our lives. I never cast judgment on him. I had to figure out a way to be concerned when there were moments to be concerned; there was a way to approach him about it, and a way not to. I think he appreciated the fact I was never going to do it the way he didn't want to hear.\n\nElliott wasn’t a typical alcoholic or drug addict in the sense that they try to keep it secret from people. He was very honest about what was going on. If there's one thing Elliott was not it's a liar. It was hard. I don't know which is worse: being deceived or having it just be all out in the open like that. It was very, very upsetting to know that somebody I cared about so much was doing something so stupid.\n\nMARGARET MITTLEMAN: As things got bigger, I probably talked to him less. My job had changed a little bit; I became a parent. I hired a friend who became my point person for Elliott. I would take the big-picture meetings with him, but as far as, like, \"Can you deliver this list of interviews he doesn't want to do, please?\" I stopped doing that. At the time, it was like “OK, you stress me out, and I’m stressing you out. Let’s have other people talk to each other and get our message across. I’ll deliver it to her, she’ll deliver it to you.” That just became easier, and I didn’t see anything wrong with that.\n\nBut somewhere in there, we lost him. I have my reasons and my thoughts of outside influences, where I feel like a parent, like, “Oh, if only they hadn’t met that person.” As if it were that person’s fault. There were a couple of people who I wish we hadn’t had in his circle at the time, in retrospect.\n\nI became blind to a lot of things. I didn’t know, but other people around me knew. The Rolling Stone[-sponsored tour] didn't seem super fun for him, but he seemed fine. He was doing everything he was supposed to do, but it was a corporate sponsor, you know? All these corporate people at the shows. Not Rolling Stone people, corporate people. They were nice, but it was different: It wasn't a fan, it wasn't me, it wasn't Rob. And then he did the European tour. I was supposed to go on a bunch of those dates, but I cancelled. He just was not pleasant, and I didn't want to be around it. I was supposed to go to Japan and I didn’t. I just wanted him to get through all of it. In hindsight, I see what was happening. He came home a mess.\n\nAUTUMN DE WILDE: His behavior was becoming more erratic. He’s not the first person I’ve experienced this with, where drugs overtake the personality after a certain point. That’s when you see that there is nobody who is enough of an individual to be an individual on drugs—even the most original person on earth, which I think he was. Some people hold onto their friends when they’re sick like that, and some people systematically try to destroy their relationships in order to not drag them down with them. I don’t know how much credit I should give him, but I felt like he systematically destroyed his relationship with anyone he really respected and cared about. Whatever was left of him did not want us around while he was totally down there.\n\nHe wasn’t really hiding anything, either, in my opinion. So that meant you were either there to condone it or you were not there to condone it. And I was not there to condone it. The people who are there to condone it—and this was a very common event—are disposable to someone like that, and they become enablers because they’re there for what they need.\n\nMARGARET MITTLEMAN: I thought it was time to get off DreamWorks. I met with Anti- [Records] at the time, because I had a good friend there and felt that he could earn money from other outside activities: Remember when the Gap was doing those commercials using musicians in the late 90s? There was interest in Elliott. And this big movie producer, Brad Silberling, was asking him to score a film. I just thought, \"There's a million other things you could be doing. You're gonna be fine.”\n\nWe had tried once to have an intervention in Chicago, [circa the Either/Or tour]. Oh my god. He hated us. He never let me forget what I did to him. We’d be having a great conversation, and it would just come up again out of nowhere. It totally reminds me of the child in him, or my own kids, how they hold onto one memory of mom and dad fighting at dinner. He never let me forget how betrayed he felt. He did agree to go. I think he felt the love and the concern, but you just don't do that to him. That’s what he was like: “I’m a different person. You could have dealt with it differently.”\n\nI visited him at the rehab place in Pasadena, maybe a month after. He finished up the leg of the tour to New York and then went. It was just weird. It felt like there was a difference between he and I.\n\nYears later, when he started hanging out with Jon Brion wanting to do work with Jon and not Rob is where the lines really got blurred. This would have been around 2001. I just wanted what was best for my husband and for Elliott. By then, he was a different person. Honestly, he wasn’t really nice to me. He came over one day during the Super Bowl—he used to spend every Super Bowl with us—and he looked like Pocahontas. He had long hair, in braids. I just didn’t know him anymore. His girlfriend Valerie [Deerin] came over—that’s another person that should have never been in his life—and he told Rob he wanted to work with Jon Brion.\n\nThat was heartbreaking. I didn’t like the delivery; I didn’t like his choice of day, because that was something we’d done together. That was the beginning of the end for me. He came over fucked up with my kids in the house, and I just shut down. I just wanted to protect my husband and my family and myself. And when I quit, that pissed him off. That’s the part that can make me cry. There was no closure. We never got to argue. We never got to hash it out. I was more like, “Just get out of here.” I never was invited to his funeral. His drug abuse had turned him into something he wasn’t when I knew him all these years.\n\nROB SCHNAPF: When it happened, he was all fucked up. I had already kind of told him I don’t approve: \"You want to smoke crack or whatever, that’s your free will, great. I don’t want to be around it. That’s my decision.\"\n\nDORIEN GARRY: At one point I probably hadn't heard from him for about four or five months—he wasn’t calling back, and it was pretty upsetting. The day after September 11th, I came back into the house to an answering message from him. He didn't sound like himself—I mean, everybody sounded weird after September 11th, but I knew that things were pretty dark for him at that point. But his message was asking if everyone was OK, talking about how he’s taken the train and gotten off at the World Trade Center, how he’d done it over a million times. That meant a lot to me. But then I couldn’t get a hold of him again for a long time. He was in a relationship that cut him off from a lot of people at the time. It was really terrible because I’d known him through some dark times already, but he always, always reached out.\n\nSCOTT BOOKER [manager, Flaming Lips; briefly managed Smith]: [The Flaming Lips] did a few dates in Europe with Elliott around '99, and we all got along really great. After that I got a call from him like, \"Hey, would you be interested in being my manager?\" I was like, \"Of course, who wouldn’t? You’re a genius.\" I didn’t really know what I was getting into. In our first conversation, he was like, \"I want off DreamWorks.\"\n\nHe didn’t want to record for them anymore because he was convinced that they had people following him, that they were breaking into his house, those kinds of things. Which we all know wasn’t true. But I’d be like, “Well, Elliott, I’m not gonna say I don’t believe you, but why don’t we get one of those cameras that you can buy for like five bucks and you take pictures of any car or person that is following you.” And he said, “Well, the cars have blank license plates.” I never said, \"I don’t believe you.\" I tried to be pragmatic and realistic. He even said to me, “Well, it’s probably not really there.”\n\nWhen the Flaming Lips played a show in L.A. one time, I remember him calling me saying, “DreamWorks are at my house, because my Flaming Lips backstage pass was upside down on the floor.\" I was like, \"Maybe you just dropped it.\" I was afraid to say those things, but I’d say it casually. And he was like, \"No, I remember putting it on my desk.” He’d have a very elaborate reason as to why. It just wasn’t worth arguing with him.\n\nEven though I didn’t think his reasons were sound, I thought I should still let the label know he’s uncomfortable being there and let them have a part of the decision as well. So I went and had a meeting with Lenny Waronker and Luke Wood. I said, \"Look, I don’t think this is a good idea for Elliott to not be on DreamWorks, and I know you guys love him, but for whatever reason, he’s uncomfortable with this. What do you guys wanna do?\"\n\nLenny came up with a pretty elegant solution. He was like, \"Let’s not say he’s off the label, let’s just let him put this next record out wherever he wants to, as long as it's not another major label.\" I thought that was very fair of them and I liked that they weren’t going to just drop him. It solved the dilemma of that moment.\n\nI mean, just think about me as the manager going into Lenny Waronker, this legendary, artist-friendly music-industry person I’ve looked up to my whole life, to go in and saying, \"I don’t think we should be on DreamWorks\"—a label that any band would want to be on. It was just funny. But to some degree, maybe that’s part of the reason why they agreed to it as well, because they’re artist-friendly. They know that it was something bigger than an artist being mad at his record label.\n\nLENNY WARONKER: I know Scott and I don't remember that [meeting]. I do remember that Scott was gonna get involved, which I thought might be nice because I liked him. But I don't remember anything like that.\n\nLUKE WOOD: Elliott was trying to find a place where he could be creative and happy. I think he felt somewhat restricted at a major label: having to do interviews, go on tour, have a commercial record. He didn't like that pressure. I deeply respected him as a musician and a friend. He spent a lot of time at my house. He knew my baby. It was a really difficult period. There's a reason I haven't talked about it for 10 years.\n\nFrom a Basement on the Hill (2004)\n\nIn 2001, Smith begins and ends a series of recording sessions with Jon Brion, which fall apart after Brion confronts him about his drug use and self-destructive behavior. By the fall of that year, he contacts producer David McConnell.\n\nDAVID MCCONNELL [producer; From a Basement on the Hill]: I had XO, which was given to me by a colleague, and I really enjoyed it. Well, half of it was great. Half of it I was like, “Well, great song, but I don’t know if I like the recording or the production.\" And then my friend Shon Sullivan [from McConnell’s L.A band Goldenboy], was playing with him live, and he invited me out to a show at the Wiltern Theater. I was blown away. It was probably one of the best shows I’ve ever seen in my life. So Shon introduced me to Elliott after the show briefly.\n\nA couple of months after that show, at the end of the Figure 8 tour, he had just started recording with Jon Brion but, for whatever reason, he wasn’t happy with that process, so he split ways with Jon and got in touch with me. When he called me he was actually in Big Bear, up in the mountains, and he was like, “Man, I want to start as soon as possible, can I come down tonight?”\n\nI could tell he was really itching to get into the studio and work with a new producer, someone who was gonna do things a little more experimentally. He wanted somebody who wasn’t so formulaic, who was willing to go down the path of discovery with him, and I guess he heard that maybe I would be that guy.\n\nSo I told him we should record in my private studio, because that’s where the more experimental equipment was. I told him he was welcome to stay in the house, too, because we had a guest room. The studio was beautiful; my ex-girlfriend actually owned the property, and it was almost like a compound, overlooking the Pacific Ocean. I had named it Satellite Park one day when I was walking around because it felt like I was on the moon or on an observatory somewhere.\n\nWhen he showed up, it was around 2 a.m., and he was in two cars; his girlfriend [Valerie Deerin] was driving one car and he was driving the other car, and both cars were full of all of his belongings. I mean everything from his apartment. I was thinking he was gonna show up with a suitcase and a backpack and a couple of guitars, but it was like five guitars, a giant keyboard, amps, and then five suitcases of clothes. He had toys, books, you name it. And then he had medication, and various other things.\n\nHe also brought all his his two-inch reels that he was working on at Jon’s house. So we drank a couple of beers and I gave him the tour of the place and everything, and then he goes, \"OK, there’s a song on here that I recorded by myself at Jon’s place that I want to keep, that I really like. Why don’t you just mix this song for me and I’ll be back in the morning.” Then he left. He was like, \"I’ve got some errands to run right now, I’ve got some stuff I gotta do.” Remember, this is 2 a.m.—well no, by now it’s 4 a.m., because we had talked about my philosophy on recording and producing for two hours.\n\nSo I put the reel on the machine and I started listening to the song, just by myself. And the first time I heard it, just pushing up the faders so I could hear the different instruments and his voice, I got the chills. It was one of the most haunting, beautiful songs I’d ever heard. It sounded nothing like the music I’d heard him do before. It sounded way more intricate, way more complex.\n\nIt reminded me of Rachmaninoff, but with lyrics, with a story. Sitting in there alone, I almost had an out-of-body experience because I knew that I was about to work on one of the best things I’d ever worked on in my life. So I spent the next three or four hours mixing the song, which was called \"True Love Is a Rose\". It's a shame because that song never ended up on the album. He wanted it to be on the album, it was one of his favorites.\n\nSo he finally got back, listened to my mix, loved it, and then he says, \"Let’s start recording another song.\" At this point he probably hasn’t slept in two days.\n\nThe next track we worked on was “Shooting Star”. He told me he wanted it to have this psychedelic intensity, to take elements of Hendrix and the Stooges, but create something that couldn’t be compared to anybody else. We slowed down the reel, just slightly, so it would have a euphoric, heavy, psychedelic persona.\n\n“Shooting Star” has three drum sets: We would do one drum take, and then we would double the drums, and then sometimes triple them. If you listen closely on headphones, you’ll hear the snare drums flailing, because there are three kits going on. He and I talked about that; I’d say \"Hey, you know, this sounds great, are you comfortable with having the snares slightly out of time?\" And he was like, \"Man, I love it.\" He wanted to embrace the human quality of this sound, that was very important for him.\n\nHe wanted \"Shooting Star\" to be the opening track then. \"Coast To Coast\", the opener on the album that got released, was another one we worked on together. He recorded the drum tracks at Sunset Sounds studio with Steven [Drozd], from the Flaming Lips, and the poet Nelson Gary’s part at the end. He had two drummers playing live at the same time on that, he told me, and he stood in the middle of the room pointing at each drummer to do the changes, like he was doing his own version of conducting.\n\nSTEVEN DROZD: I went to Los Angeles to visit my then-ex-girlfriend and now wife: We'd been broken up for a few years and she'd gotten into a serious relationship and then got out of the serious relationship and I was trying to win her back. I contacted Elliott, and he said, \"I know of this Suboxone doctor that's helped me greatly\"—which is this drug you take to get off opiates—\"and I'm doing some recording. Could you come down and play some drums?\"\n\nSo we just set up the two drum kits and played at the same time. I know that you can be a highly functioning drug addict depending on what drugs you're getting into, but to me, it didn't seem like he was affected at all. He was fucking in charge of the session. People think I played drums all over that record, but it really just ended up being one song.\n\nDAVID MCCONNELL: From that first night, he basically moved in and ended up living there with me for many months. And that’s when we did the bulk of the album. We’d be in my bedroom and he’d sit on the bed and play me songs really late at night. He played \"King's Crossing\" for me on his guitar one night, although that’s not a song we worked on together.\n\nHe brought his guitars, but the funny thing about Elliott is he had five of the same guitar, the Gibson ES-330. I never understood it, exactly. I was like, \"OK, that’s great, we can use those, but if you want this bigger guitar sound, I encourage you to check out the guitars that I have.\" On “Shooting Star”, he fell in love with this old 60s Telecaster I have. Most of the really big guitars you hear on that album are that Telly because this guitar just spits at you.\n\nHe was constantly testing me. He always asked me what my favorite albums were, and it was important that they weren’t ones that were super-produced, because his favorite records weren’t slick; they weren’t perfect. Elliott was very adamant not to use Pro Tools because he didn’t want to fix things. That was one of the important things I learned from working with him on that record: The technically-correct performance isn’t beautiful. It's the performance that can’t be replicated ever again.\n\nOne of the things that was really fun and worked well was, if we would double a guitar track, we would purposefully de-tune the guitar. So for the first track, we would make it a little bit sharp, and then for the second, we would make it a little bit flat. If you played one by itself it was kind of upsetting, but when they came together, all of a sudden you’d start smiling.\n\nI’d never see anyone use drugs like Elliott before. I knew I couldn’t give him an intervention, because he’d already warned me. I knew that I couldn’t say, \"Hey, you have to leave,\" because if he wasn’t with me, he’d end up somewhere else which could potentially be harmful. I knew that at my place I could at least watch him.\n\nI think I developed an anxiety disorder working with Elliott. He's one of the most complicated people I’ve ever known in my life. Every once in awhile we’d get in an argument, and he’d leave, and we wouldn’t talk for a week. Then he’d call me and say, \"This is stupid, let’s go get a beer and talk.\" That was how the pattern went. The next day he’d be back at my place. But I loved him like a brother. I wasn’t about to turn my back on him.\n\nIt got the point when he really needed his own place to finish the record, so I helped him put together his New Monkey studio, and then continued to work with him there. That went on for months and months, and then we kind of lost track. That was basically the last year of his life.\n\nLOU BARLOW: I was seeing him more often around that period, too. He was talking about not doing as many drugs. He had been through a really bad period and the spark was kind of coming back. He was in this really bizarre period where he was dressing like Willie Nelson—he would wear these strange silk pants with embroidery down the side and long, flowing shirts. But then he started to look like Elliott again.\n\nHe was accumulating so much gear at that time, too. He was on eBay constantly, managing a slew of auctions. This was for his studio, New Monkey, that he was building in North Hollywood. This guy who was playing drums in the Folk Implosion was also scheming heavily to be in Elliott's band and hanging around Elliott constantly. Every time he'd hang out with him, he'd come back with a different piece of equipment, like, \"Yeah, Elliott handed this to me.\" \"What? That's a $750 contraption for Christ's sake!\" All of this stuff of Elliott's started accumulating in my practice space. \"Wow! Where did you get that bass?\" \"Oh, Elliott gave it to me last night.\" \"Really? That's a $2,000 bass.\" He would just be really high and tell the guy, \"Yeah, you should take it.\"\n\nAUTUMN DE WILDE: As a photographer, I made a decision not to document that time period. That’s not the kind of artist I am. I don’t judge someone who does that at all, but that was not what I was there for. After that point, I was there as his friend until I wasn’t welcomed as his friend. I know he loved me a lot, and I loved him a lot, but it’s not the same person. Everybody who was a close friend basically had to say goodbye twice.\n\nJJ GONSON: I talked to him on the phone around '99, and he was a mess. I hadn't spoken with him in a very long time, because I had to say, \"I can't be in touch with you anymore.\" The last thing he said to me was, \"I'll write you a letter.\" Which of course he didn't do.\n\nHe burned every bridge that he crossed. He didn't just say, \"Look, I need a break.\" He took a machete, chopped you into tiny little pieces, poured battery acid on it, then added salt and set you on fire. He did this painful, painful ripping himself away from people thing to protect himself. He genuinely believed, I think, that he was doing the right thing for other people. He had convinced himself that the world was better off not having him in it, for other people.\n\nOn October 21, 2003, Smith dies in an L.A. hospital at age 34 after suffering two stab wounds to the chest.\n\nROB SCHNAPF: He had been calling me the week before [his death], and was like, \"Hey, I want to play you what I have for my record.\" I didn’t call him back. I didn’t know if I felt like dealing with it.\n\nWhen our son was born in 1999, we got a phone call in the hospital room around midnight. It was Elliott. He was like, \"Hey, would it be OK to come and hang out?\" So he came down and he was there all night. We wandered the hospital, just hanging out. It was really cool that he wanted to come share that special time with us. Sonny was born at eight in the morning; four years later, Elliott dies on [Sonny's] birthday. We were coming back from taking Sonny to see some big IMAX rocketship thing, and I get a phone call from Luke Wood saying, \"Hey, have you heard any rumors?\" I was like, \"No, why?\" He said, \"I just heard one that wasn’t good.\"\n\nMARGARET MITTLEMAN: I remember Sonny bopping around the backyard in his spacesuit. We were just having a f"
