        "text": "I find myself coming back to this movie, partly because Fish Tank is one of my favourite films ever but also because of the feeling of hope I get when remember it back. Its a combination of the endless close ups of Sasha Lanes ‘Star’, where she feels equal parts trapped by this group of runaways and in awe of the family they have created, and freewheeling wheeling and dealing bravado of Shia able to come back from any bullshit he does.\n\nI remember this feeling of anything is possible.\n\nAnd then I rewatch it…..\n\nThe film is 2 and a half hours long and operates as a repeated series of episodic mini stories. Each beginning as they unload from the bus at the new spot and ending inexplicably back on the bus, Star having gone on an adventure she won’t talk to anyone about. It’s the same again and again, each episodic adventure is interesting, then it reverts to the status quo until the van stops and it begins again.\n\nIt’s a movie that’s satisfying in its parts but as a whole in one sitting, it’s really not. And while I can talk about cause and effect and but/therefore scene transitions and protagonist driving versus being driven (pun intended) but I think that is a disservice to Andrea Arnold. I think its a film we need to view at its core and not at its face value, Andrea Arnold made something and we, or me, now grapples with it…\n\nHaving just watched it for the 4th time I realised a constant running motifs of animals, of Star saving them, gently helping them to safety. It’s in almost every episodic story, if not she helps a child, and for me that unlocks part of when Andrea Arnold may be trying to do.\n\nThese crew of traveling sales people do anything in their power to get a sale, they steal, they do drugs they are the epitome of white trash. Star stands out as the beacon of hope and love, but she is stuck in the cycle of the capitalist hellscape of America. Every either eking out a living or hoarding and protecting what they have, and very little in between.\n\nStar finds these gentle moments to show love to a helpless create before we recycle another day in search of a dollar. There’s sex in this film but its graphic and animalistic and never feels like love, but these moments do.\n\nWhen asked what her dreams are for the future, Star is confused and reveals she has never been asked that or seemingly ever thought about it. She then asks Shia and he has the same response but later reveals a bag of ‘treasure’ he has been stealing to fund whatever future holds. He doesn’t have a plan either, just a bag of shiny trinkets, which grips out of hope that maybe just maybe it will buy the future he my one day dream of. Untill then he has shiny things.\n\nThe hope comes in cycles then crushes you every time. Yet the animals play a bigger role as the movie draws to a close. Near the end of the films, Star get paid $1000 top have sex with an oil worker and then gets yelled at by Shia, she sits alone in a field and a bear approaches her. It’s a moment that feels like an enter into magical realism, maybe bears are out here, I Dono, but I don’t think so. The bear approaches here, its mouth open millimetres from stars face then slow walks away. It’s moment like so many others that doesn’t seem to build from or too anything but its a moment.\n\nA moment something that could hurt or take advantage of Star but doesn’t. It’s a moment where Star good deeds, come to fruition, a moment where in the presence of Bear she is safe. Cut to her saving a bee. And new girl being introduced to the crew. And a wash off positivity takes us to the end of the film.\n\nIn its final moments Star saves a turtle, and wade out into the water as ‘I am the saviour’ echos out into the night. She comes up for air and its silent, peaceful, then a firefly takes us into the credits. Star has found something resembling…\n\nLove.\n\nThe first time I watched it I became obsessed with unravelling it, creating a narrative justification for it all. When it made sense intellectually, I could put it away and move on.\n\nBut I couldn’t.\n\nI keep revisiting it. I keep tearing up, not at any particular moment. Just throughout it. The experience is just so emotional.\n\nI couldn’t unpack why until recently. After 10 years in a share house the owner has decided to move back in and kick us out and I realise I’ve never really had a place I call home, or a base, or somewhere I could go back to and feel whole. I still don’t. Home, is temporary.\n\nBut something in A Ghost Story makes me feel whole, seeing this plot of land, this building give so much joy and so much heartache but most of become vessel for a world of misguided purpose. Whether it in the future in a board room, in the past, or as a college student doing their best impression of their favourite philosopher.\n\nI grew up living in caravans at a dirt bike track in Alice Springs. At the time it just was what it was and I would avoid bringing girls around because well, my family lived in two caravans with a roof between them and shade cloth as walls. We had to walk 50 metres across rocks to the club room to shower and the kitchen was watered by a 20 litre jug filled up daily with a hose. It was what it was, but for me visiting friends felt, confusing, there was warmth and walls, and television reception and they were chatting up girls on MSN messenger. None of which I had. Home was temporary. And then I broke my back, my parents separated and I moved into a backpacker hostel. Home, was temporary.\n\nThat each new house, or caravan, or hospital, or backpacker hostel I have lived in throughout my 35 years living is a chance to rewrite a little piece of my life with the people in it. But home, as a construction, is temporary. However what this movie illuminates is that the moments are forever, the moments last, the moments matter, and really at the end of it all, its all we have.\n\nHome is temporary.\n\nI’ve gotta touch on some film craft of course. The frame size is gorgeously nostalgic without the film ever feeling too twee in its nostalgia. I love a sequence based structure of the narrative, these stories tie in through a theme yet the characters only exist in each particular sequence, we only get a glimpse but the glimpse builds to a whole. When directing this structure of almost separating an episode or a movie into reels, even if not written that way can create a certain energy for the audience. Finding the midpoint in a half hour of TV or the using the act break to your advantage.\n\nAlso this - the quietness on set is something I crave so fucking bad. The intimacy with the actors and the shorthand with the crew just settles the set and allow the best performance from everyone."
