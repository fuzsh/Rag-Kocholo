        "text": "Page talks with PEOPLE about how he felt 'so much better' acting on set following his transition\n\nThe characters on The Umbrella Academy have been through so much these past few seasons, but the show has also had a huge impact on the actors.\n\nSpeaking exclusively with PEOPLE, Elliot Page, who stars as Viktor Hargreeves on the hit Netflix series, noted that one of the biggest ways he’s grown as an actor in the past four seasons is by coming into his own since his transition.\n\nAfter the actor, 37, came out as a transgender in December 2020, Page's character was reintroduced to fans as Viktor Hargreeves in season 3, which Page says helped him feel “so much better” acting on set.\n\n“That's been the big shift for me is having a lot of my experience post coming out as trans, or even this last season having been on T for a bit,” Page adds. “The difference is so significant, and I love it. Hopefully, I'll continue to get to act and see how it impacts my work.”\n\nRelated: The Umbrella Academy Cast Reflect on Saying Goodbye to the Series: 'I Have Friends for Life' (Exclusive)\n\nSpecifically, in the final season, we see Viktor go through a lot of character growth as he confronts Reginald Hargreeves about past traumas.\n\n“As an actor shooting a scene like that and confronting Reginald Hargreeves in that way and that intensely is so satisfying,” Page explains. “It's just so juicy and so much of Viktor's journey is leading to that moment, his ability to express himself and to stand up for himself.”\n\nPage adds it was especially gratifying seeing the progress his character has made throughout the show. “To play this character and to know that where he started at the beginning of this whole show, just so folded in on himself, he hardly knew how to talk to people or connect with people and then now we really see him more solid in himself. He still has some stuff to deal with, like dude could probably work on some of those anger issues, but he's on his way. It felt really good to see him really step into himself and have a new sense of self-worth.”\n\nRelated: Emmy Raver-Lampman Shares How Playing a Mom on Umbrella Academy Prepared Her for Real-Life Motherhood (Exclusive)\n\nHis costar Emmy Raver-Lampman, who plays Viktor’s superhero sister Allison, adds that one of the best parts of the show was meeting fans who saw themselves represented in their characters.\n\n“Being in the show, I've had the opportunity of getting to meet so many of our incredible fans, and a lot of them are young women of color and young Black women and they've told me how much it means to them to see themselves in this show,” she says, adding, “And not just me, many see themselves in David [Castañeda], and in Ritu [Arya], and in Elliot. It's so important. Representation is so important.”\n\n“This show, which is based off a graphic novel that is traditionally not a family of color, casting diversely and then how that casting navigated all of our storylines and how it impacted the stories that were told in our show opened itself up to an incredibly vast viewership and an incredibly diverse viewership,” she adds.\n\n“I'm walking away so proud of this show and the fans that it has acquired because I was cast in it, and because Elliott was cast in it, and because David was cast in it, and Justin [H. Min], and Ritu, and every single person that is coming from a marginalized group of people.”\n\nAs the series comes to a close, Page hopes fans feel a sense of “closure” with the ending. “I just hope people are moved and feel connected to the siblings at the end and you're with us in that moment.”\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nThe fourth and final season of The Umbrella Academy premieres globally on Netflix on Aug. 8.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
