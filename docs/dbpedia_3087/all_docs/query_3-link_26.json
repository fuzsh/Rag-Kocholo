        "text": "Want to get to know someone on a deeper level? Playing a round of the classic \"21 Questions\" game is a great reason to ask all the right questions to get to know someone better, whether that person is your best friend or your crush.\n\nSo the next time you’re in need of a fun (and free!) game to play with friends or some icebreaker questions to ask on a first date, just pull up this list of 21 Questions game questions. We've rounded up the most interesting — and the silliest, and the flirtiest — questions to ask to help you spark great conversations about anything and everything. With fun questions like these at your fingertips, you'll literally never run out of things to talk about. (And if you're looking for more slumber party-heyday holdovers to keep you busy, we've got you covered with our favorite Never Have I Ever questions, Truth or Dare questions, and Would You Rather questions, too.)\n\nLet the games — and the conversation starters — begin!\n\nHow to Play the 21 Questions Game\n\nPlaying 21 Questions is super simple and straightforward, and you can play it with as many people as are in your group.\n\nIf you're playing with two people, you and the other person can simply take turns answering questions. You can also modify this by having one person answer several questions in a row (or all 21 questions) before reversing roles and having the other person answer questions. That said, if you’re playing 21 Questions during a date, especially an early-on one, it’s probably going to feel better and more natural to take turns answering. You don’t want one person to wind up hogging all the airwaves!\n\nIf you're playing in a group, the first player can choose a question from the following list of 21 questions to ask (and then some). Then, the group can go around one by one and answer that question, with the person who asked the question going last. After everyone answers, the next player chooses a question and everyone answers again, and so on.\n\nYou can set rules that allow each player to skip a turn (or multiple turns) if they don't feel comfortable with the question, or you can play in hard mode and make it mandatory to answer every single question. It’s ultimately up to you, but keep in mind that if anyone appears super hesitant to answer a specific question, it’s not kind to force them. Consider giving that person an out and keeping the game rolling. If a question comes around that you feel embarrassed to answer, you’ll be glad you set the precedent of letting others off the hook!\n\nNow, onto the list of questions! Ahead, you'll find more than 21 questions to ask (gotta account for those potential skips), including some additional flirty questions that are perfect if you happen to be playing with a crush.\n\n21 Questions List\n\nFrom deep questions that’ll spark an honest dialogue to unique and random questions we’re pretty sure your game-mates won’t have heard before, choose any 21 (or more) of the following queries for your 21 Questions game.\n\n1. What's the weirdest dream you've ever had?\n\n2. If you could travel to any time period in a time machine, what time period would you choose and why?\n\n3.
