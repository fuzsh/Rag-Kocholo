        "text": "Gone are the days of fake IDs and getting turned away at the bar.\n\nThe big 2-1 has finally arrived for Jeff Chang (Justin Chon), a straight-A student whose birthday falls on the eve of his medical school interview. Chang’s two best friends Casey (Skylar Astin) and Miller (Miles Teller) decide to pay him a surprise visit and take him out for his birthday. While Chang initially tries to make the responsible choice and celebrate another night instead, he eventually gives in and a night of debauchery ensues.\n\nAfter one too many drinks, Casey and Miller decide it’s time to get Chang to bed. The problem is that they can’t remember where he lives. The rest becomes a wild goose chase in the search for someone who might know Chang’s address. The guys endure being branded by a Latina sorority, mastering a series of drinking games and breaking Chang out of a mental institution so they can get him home before his tyrannical father picks him up for his interview in the morning.\n\n“21 and Over” is the directorial debut of Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, writers of “The Hangover.” Lucas and Moore seemed to have borrowed material from themselves, judging by strong comparisons in plot points. Similar to Chang’s scenario in “21 and Over,” Doug in “The Hangover” goes out with a group of guy friends to celebrate his bachelor party, things get out of control and his friends spend the remainder of the film trying to get him safely back for his wedding. “21 and Over” is different because it is specifically targeting college students as well as those looking to reminisce over their wild college days.\n\nMiles Teller, who recently received the special jury award at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival for his performance in “The Spectacular Now,” was the standout actor of the film. His portrayal of Miller was fully believable as he embodied the character. From his facial expressions to his delivery of snappy banter, every crude line that was made was followed by a sly wink. Teller’s performance of Miller made audiences laugh with him and also sympathize with his character.\n\nHe also demonstrated effortless on-screen camaraderie with co-star Skylar Astin. Astin wowed audiences in “Pitch Perfect” and did not disappoint in “21 and Over.” While he doesn’t get to show off his talents in this film, he plays off of Teller very well. Justin Chon of the “Twilight” saga was fun to watch but it was difficult to get past his stereotypical role.\n\nThe script is predictable, owing to the American perception of what constitutes a 21st birthday. It isn’t difficult to conclude that a film about being 21 and over will involve drinking and depravity. The specific problems that the characters get into aren’t as predictable, but seem to be more for shock value than anything else, as in the scene where Miller and Casey get their bare bottoms paddled.\n\nProblematic issues with the film also include its blatant racism and sexism. From the angry Latinas to the overbearing Asian father to the remarks about “ethnic Serbs,” many comments that are meant to be funny often come off as insensitive and rude.\n\nThe film takes full advantage of its R rating, including a scene where the guys pull off a teddy bear that was duct-taped to Chang’s penis. Other outrageous scenes include Chang vomiting while riding a mechanical bull in slow motion, as well as the moment that Casey and Miller leave the Latina sorority wearing nothing but a tube sock on their nether regions.\n\nA surprising facet is the film’s attempt to add an emotional layer. The three friends were close in high school but have slowly begun falling out of touch in college. Miller is crude and unapologetic, the epitome of a man-child. Casey is a straight-laced Stanford student bound for Wall Street and Chang is on the track to become a doctor. The characters’ uncertainties about graduation, growing apart from friends and the inevitable quarter-life crisis are relatable to the film’s target audience.\n\nBy making use of contemporary and youthful song choices such as “Tonight is the Night” by Outasight and “Young Blood” by The Naked and Famous, the party mood was evident and kept the audience seeing the film through beer goggles.\n\nThe jokes kept coming and audiences were laughing throughout. “21 and Over” is a good time, but much like a 21st birthday, it’s hard to remember much of it the next morning."
