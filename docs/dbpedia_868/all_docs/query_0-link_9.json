This material has been collated and presented in chronological order.\n\nIn perusing these narratives, the reader should bear in mind that while they recount in considerable detail the engagements in which our forces participated, certain underlying aspects of these operations must be kept in a secret category until after the end of the war.\n\nIt should be remembered also that the observation of men in battle are sometimes at variance. As a result, the reports of commanding officers may differ although they participated in the same action and shared a common purpose. In general, Combat Narratives represent a reasoned interpretation of these discrepancies. In those instances where views cannot be reconciled, extract from the conflicting evidence are reprinted. Thus, an effort has been made to provide accurate and, within the above-mentioned limitations, complete narratives with charts covering raids, combats, joint operations, and battles in which our Fleet have engaged in the current war. It is hoped that these narratives will afford a clear view of what has occurred, and form a basis for a broader understanding which will result in ever more successful operations.\n\nAdmiral, U.S.N.\n\nCommander in Chief, U.S. Fleet and Chief of Naval Operations.\n\nIII\n\nContents\n\nPage The landings in North Africa 1 The Moroccan expedition 6 Characteristics of the coast 7 Fixed defenses 8 Mobile defenses 10 The French naval forces 11 Organization of the United States Amphibious Force 11 Departure 13 The Atlantic crossing 15 The Battle of Casablanca 19 The attack on Mehdia and the Port Lyautey airfield 34 The attack on Safi 46 Attach on Fedala 55 The Algerian expedition 61 The attack on Oran and Arzeu 62 The attack on Algiers 70 Conclusion 78 Appendix I.

I retain and cherish the friendship of hundreds of French people in France and outside of France. I know your farms, your villages and your cities. I know your soldiers, professors and workmen. I know what a precious heritage of the French people are your homes, your culture and the principles of democracy in France.\n\nâI salute again and reiterate my faith in liberty, equality and fraternity. No two nations exist which are more united by historic and mutually friendly ties than the people of France and the United States.\n\nâAmericans, with the assistance of the United Nations, are striving for their own safe future as well as the restoration of the ideals, the liberties, and the democracy of all those who have lived under the tricolor.\n\nI\n\nâWe come among you to repulse the cruel invaders who would remove forever your rights of self-government, your rights to religious freedom, and your rights to live your own lives in peace and security.\n\nâWe come among you solely to defeat and rout your enemies. Have faith in our words. We do not want to cause you any harm.\n\nâWe assure you that, once the menace of Germany and Italy is removed from you, we shall quit your territory at once.\n\nâI am appealing to you and your realism, to your self-interest and national ideals.\n\nâDo not obstruct, I beg of you this great purpose.\n\nâHelp us where you are able, my friends, and we shall see again the glorious day when liberty and peace shall reign again on earth.\n\nâVive La France Ã©ternelle!â\n\nOperations in North Africa long antedated our entry into World War II. They had been limited, however, to Egypt and Libya. Their extension to preclude any Axis action in Morocco had been under discussion by the British high command for some time prior to 7 December 1941. The plan originally contemplated a landing of about 55,000 men in the vicinity of Casablanca. Upon our entry into the war the plan underwent several expansions. It was first enlarged to provide for landing not only near Casablanca but at Mehdia-Port Lyautey and Safi as well. It was thereafter further expanded to include the occupation of the entire North African coast as far as Tripolitania. This occupation would facilitate the safeguarding of Mediterranean convoys, thus enormously shortening the route to the Middle East and saving considerable tonnage previously employed in the route to the Middle East and saving considerable tonnage previously employed in the long passage around the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nThe various stages through which the project passed need not be examined. Agreement in principle was readily reached. The United States was to have charge of both the military and naval operations on the Atlantic coast of Morocco. Casablanca, therefore, became an essentially American objective[1]. Oran and Algiers, two cities the occupation of which was contemplated, were to be captured by a joint British and American force, of which the British were to supply all the naval units except a few transports. The landing forces were to be partly American, partly British. Logistics presented a formidable problem, but by July 1942, a plan was formulated providing in detail for an offensive in North Africa under American command, prior to December 1942.\n\n__________\n\n1 Consequently it will be treated more fully than the Mediterranean operations.\n\n2\n\nThe strategical purpose of the operations were stated by the Combined Chiefs of Staff to be as follows:\n\n(1) Establishment of firm and mutually supported lodgments in the Oran-Algiers-Tunis area on the north coast, in order that appropriate bases for continued and intensified air, ground and sea operations might be readily available.\n\n(2) Vigorous and rapid exploitation from lodgments obtained in order to acquire complete control of the entire area, including French Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, to facilitate effective air and ground operations against the enemy, and to create favorable conditions for extension of offensive operations to the east through Libya against the rear of Axis forces in the Western Desert.\n\n(3) Complete annihilation of Axis forces opposing the British forces in the Western Desert and intensification of air and sea operations against the Axis on the European continent.\n\nThe âconcept of United States participationâ issued by the Joint United States Chiefs of Staff called the following military and naval forces:\n\n(1) A Joint Expeditionary Force to seize and occupy the Atlantic coast of French Morocco.\n\n(2) United States forces required in conjunction with British forces to seize and occupy the Mediterranean coast of French North Africa.\n\n(3) Additional Army forces as required to complete the occupation of Northwest Africa.\n\n(4) Naval local defense forces and sea frontier forces for the Atlantic coast of French Morocco and naval personnel for naval base maintenance and harbor control at Oran.\n\n(5) The United States to be responsible for logistic support and requirements of all United States Forces.\n\nThe directive of the Joint United States Chief of Staff further provided that the United States should furnish the Commander in Chief, Allied Forces. This command was given to Lt. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, U.S. Army, then our Commanding General, European Theater of Operations. General Eisenhower had already established his headquarters in London. He was supplied with a combined United States-British staff. Later Maj. Gen. Mark W. Clark, U.S. Army, was appointed Deputy\n\n3\n\nCommander in Chief. Vice Admiral Bertram H. Ramsay, R.N., was selected initially to be General Eisenhowerâs principle naval subordinate but was replaced in mid-October by Admiral Sir Andrew Browne Cunningham R.N., who assumed the title âNaval Commander, Expeditionary Force.â The United States Navy was represented at Allied Force Headquarters by Rear Admiral Bernhard H. Bieri, Deputy Chief of Staff, United States Atlantic Fleet.\n\nThe extension of the original British plan to include action on the entire Barbary Coast had wider implications than were involved in the operationâs diversionary effect pm the Russian front. Allied strategy called for the formation and the gradual tightening of a ring around the Axis powers. The northern coast of the Mediterranean was an important segment of that ring and the occupation of French North Africa an essential prelude to the opening of a second front on the European continent. At the same time, countermeasures by the Axis would be forestalled.\n\nThat Germany might attempt to send forces across the Straits of Gibraltar was a possibility that could not be ignored. The threat to the South Atlantic area which would result from an Axis penetration into French Equatorial Africa made it imperative that access to that region be denied to our enemies at once. In this respect the attitude of Spain had to be taken into account.\n\nAlthough not a belligerent, Spain was watching Allied strategy in North Africa with lively interest. Rumors that General Franco might attempt an occupation of French Morocco in the event that Allied forces occupied Dakar had been current for some time. That Spain would not be adverse to enlarging her Moroccan colony was well known, nut her ability to do so without Axis cooperation was questionable. The possibility of an Hispano-Axis bargain was, however, serious enough to render it imperative that sufficient forces be stationed on the French-Spanish Moroccan border to forestall and Spanish move.\n\nAs can be seen, the contemplated operations had to be on a very large scale. We were undertaking possibly the most ambitious combined operation in the annals of warfare. Careful preparation and, above all, absolute secrecy were essential if the operation were to be successful at a cost that would not be appalling.\n\n4\n\nThe question of how much resistance the French North African colonies would offer was difficult to gauge.\n\nThe situation prevailing in the French Navy was a peculiar one. French naval officers have for generations been chosen largely from certain families, most of whom are Bretons and avowedly royalist. The traditions of âGrand Corpsâ are still very much alive. As a result French naval officers are inclined to think more in terms of the service than of the nation. The enlisted men, who like their superiors are mostly Bretons, have long been accustomed to follow the lead of their officers. Their ambition is to achieve a rating and retire with a pension. In order to do so, an unblemished record for discipline and subordination is necessary. Admiral Darlan was especially popular among the enlisted men because his efforts on their behalf at the time of armistice.\n\nThat the rank and file of the French Navy would resent any interference in French affairs, no matter how well intentioned, was a foregone conclusion among all competent observers. The traditional antipathy to the British, the âhereditary enemyâ had been revived by the attack on Dakar and Mers-el-KÃ©bir in 1940. British designs on Bizerte were suspected. The fact that Great Britain was now joined by the United States made little difference. It was generally accepted that Anglo-Saxon sea power was opposed to the French colonial system. The determined resistance the French naval units offered at Casablanca- and on the Algerian coast- was in marked contrast to the pro forma resistance offered by the land forces.\n\nThe situation in the French Army was slightly different in that it reflected the vies of the average Frenchman. Marshall PÃ©tain was personally popular and his relations with Reich were condoned on the ground that no other course was open to him. The senior officers were as a rule loyal to the Marshal, anxious to make a honorable show of resistance and inclined to be antiforeign. The junior officers and enlisted men, however, were inclined to look favorable on the Unites States. For this reason it was deemed advisable throughout the entire French African campaign to stress the American complexion of the expedition.\n\nThe government officials as a class were resentful of all interference and concerned about their salaries and pensions. The civil population was neutral and mainly interested in bettering its economic condition. The natives, including the indigenous troops, were apathetic.\n\nGenerally speaking it may be said that in North Africa, France was a\n\n5\n\nâhouse divided,â in which respect it reflected the political situation in European France.\n\nThe occupation of French North Africa was accomplished by means of simultaneous assaults on Casablanca, Oran and Algiers. General Eisenhower exercised command over all elements of the three attacking forces, with the exception of the permanent British naval units in the Mediterranean. These remained under the control of the British Admiralty.\n\nGeographically the three operations fall into two regions based on the seas to which they are related. From a military point of view those in the Mediterranean were primarily British and designed to supplement somewhat the British land operations proceeding from Egypt. On the other hand, the attack from the Atlantic to a certain extent owed its inception to the strategic needs of hemispheric defense. For purposed of clarity the Moroccan and Algerian expeditions will therefore be considered separately.\n\nTHE MOROCCAN EXPEDITION\n\nIn the Moroccan expedition the naval component was known as the Western Naval Task Force and was under the command of Rear Admiral Henry K. Hewitt, U.S.N. The Army component was known as the Western Task Force and was under the command of Maj, Gen. George S. Patton, U.S. Army. The mission assigned to the Naval Task Force was:\n\nâTo establish the Western [Army] Task Force on beachheads near Mehsia, Fedala and Safi, and support the subsequent coastal military operations in order to capture Casablanca as a base for further military and naval operations.â\n\nThe principle objective of the expedition was therefore the harbor of Casablanca, modern seaport on the Atlantic protected by an adequate breakwater and processing docks and other facilities. To accomplish the task it was considered advisable to occupy simultaneously three other harbors. The most important of these was Fedala, situated 14 miles northwest of Casablanca. Secondary landing places which were deemed necessary for the success of the operations were Mehdia, 65 miles north of Casablanca, and Safi, 125 miles south of Casablanca. The object of landing at Fedala and Safi was to facilitate the capture of Casablanca\n\n6\n\nfrom the land side. Mehdia was occupied because of the adjoining airfield at Port Lyautey.\n\nAlthough capable of being expressed in a few lines, the mission assigned to the Western Naval Task Force presented serious difficulties.\n\nCharacteristics of the coast.\n\nThe coast of Morocco is generally rocky with occasional long shelving beaches which require transport to lie a considerable distance from the shore. Rocky outcrops add to the difficulties of making safe landings. The number if possible landing places is relatively limited. Fully navigable rivers are nonexistent. Such harbors as exist are artificial. Intelligence reports, however, indicated that several practicable beaches were located in the vicinity of the ports to be occupied.\n\nThe beaches are subject to heavy ground swells, high surf, and a considerable tidal rise and fall which render debarkation operations extremely difficult[2]. A swell of 16 feet, which in breaking doubles in high, is not uncommon. Very high surf and swell are frequently observed in spite of fair local weather. Low pressure over the Azores moving towards southern Spain will cause a heavy surf off Morocco in about one day. A depression passing south of Iceland, on the other hand, will not be felt until 2 or 3 days later. The worst swell and surf, however, result from a depression in the area between Bermuda and Newfoundland. After a lag of about 36 hours, surf, accompanied by gale winds, may be expected along the Moroccan coast. The chances of these disturbances naturally increase with the approach of winter weather. In view of the late date chosen for the North American expedition the meteorological factor was one of the utmost importance. In fact, immediately after the debarkations a surf developed which, had it occurred a day or two sooner, would have immeasurably increased the hazards of the landing.\n\nPredictions require the continuous study of meteorological conditions over the entire Atlantic. The efficiency of the metrological service of the Navy contributed in no small degree to the success of the undertaking. In order that no source of information be neglected, five beacon submarines were dispatched to the Moroccan coast two days ahead of the main\n\n__________\n\n2 One of the probable reasons why our landings on the Moroccan beaches met with such light opposition was the fact that the French did not believe a landing through the surf possible and were expecting attacks on more sheltered spots, such as harors or, in the case of Media, a beach along the Sebou River.\n\n7\n\nbody. Among their duties was the prompt reporting of meteorological conditions.\n\nFixed defenses\n\nAlthough the French fortification plan was far from completed. The coastal area was protected by numerous fixed defenses. These consisted of (a) naval coast defense batteries, (b) emplaced army field artillery, (c) army or naval antiaircraft batteries, and (d) machine guns, usually mounted in pill boxes. The exact location and nature of all these batteries were not known in advance. The intelligence reports, however, proved remarkably accurate. Such slight inaccuracies as were discovered will be mentioned in dealing with operations. The defenses reported were as follows:\n\nMehdia.[3] â This town, situated at the mouth pf the Sebou River on the southern bank, had been fortified with two batteries. One, known as the Batterie Ponsot, consisted of two 138.6-mm. guns and was located halfway between the Kasba (walled native quarter) and the lighthouse. It commanded all sea approaches to the Sebou River. Estimated range: 18,000 meters. Another battery, known as the Batterie does Pases, consisted of two 75-mm. guns and was located on the riverâs edge below the Kasba.\n\nFedala[4].- This village, mainly a pleasure resort, 12 miles northeast if Casablanca, had been fortified with four batteries. (a) The Batterie Port Blondin was located at Chergui about 3 miles northeast of the harbor of Fedala. It consisted of four138.6-mm. Estimated range: 18,000 meters. (b) The Batterie du Port, located just southwest of where Cape Fedala starts to jut out, consisted of two 100-mm. guns with an estimated range of 14,000 meters. It dominated the small harbor of Fedala. (c) The Batterie des Passes, consisted of two 75-mm. guns, was located on the tip of Cape Fedala. (d) An army antiaircraft battery of four 75-mm. guns was located just south of the village alongside the railroad tracks.\n\nCasablanca area[5].- At the Table dâAukasha, a headland about 5 miles northeast of Casablanca, a battery of four guns had been mouthed. These were reported to be either 164.7-mm or 138.6-mm. guns. Three miles southwest of Casablanca the El Hank promontory juts out into the Atlantic. Here two batteries had been mounted. Battery No. I consisted of four\n\n__________\n\n3 See charts opposite pp. 19 and 35.\n\n4 See charts opposite pp. 24 and 25.\n\n5 See charts opposite pp.24 and 25.\n\n8\n\n194-mm. guns aligned northeast and southwest to the west of Point El Hank lighthouse. Battery No. 2 consisted of four 138.6-mm. guns spread in a line between Battery No. I and the tip of the point. These two batteries were formidable. The former was said to have a range of at least 23,500 meters, the latter a range of about 18,000 meters. The guns were mounted on a central pivots and could be trained both east and west. The fire control and magazines were modern.\n\nCasablanca Harbor[6].- The harbor of Casablanca is formed by two jetties located at right angles to each other, the JetÃ©e Delure and the JetÃ©e Transversale. The former extends along the ocean in a northeasternly directions for a distance of 2,600 meters. The entrance to the inner harbor is close to the 1,500 meter point on the JetÃ©e Declure, opposite the end of the JetÃ©e Transversale. The area thus enclosed is approximately bisected by a spacious wharf, the MÃ´le du Commerce. The outer harbor is formed by the coast, the JetÃ©e Transversale and the portion of the JetÃ©e Delure projecting beyond the entrance to the inner harbor. Two rocky outcroppins located near the coast about 1,300 meters from the JetÃ©e Transversale are within the red sector of the Roches Noires lighthouse.\n\nThe harbor area had been fortified with air raid protection mainly in view. On the JetÃ©e Delure, at the 1,000 meter point, a battery of four 40-mm. AA guns had been installed. Further along, at the 1,700 and 2,100 meter points, blockhouses had been constructed. They were believed to contain 37-mm. and 13.2-mm. machine guns. On the spur extending toward the JetÃ©e Transversale four 13.2-mm. AA machine guns had been mounted. At the angle formed by the JetÃ©e TRansversale and the shore two batteries had been mounted, each equipped with a searchlight. The westerly battery was believed to contain four 75-mm. AA guns, the easterly battery four 13.2-mm. AA guns. On the end of the JetÃ©e TRansversale a bettery of two 75-mm. guns and one 13.2-mm. AA gun had been mounted. On the roof of the adjoining Phosphate Building another battery of four 13.2-mm. AA guns in towers had been erected.\n\nThe uncompleted battleship Jean Bart, moored at the southeastern end of the MÃ´le du Commerce heading northwest, may be considered as part of the fixed defenses of Casablanca. Her normal armament consisted of eight 15-inch guns in two turrets (range 35,000 yards) of which only four had been installed, fifteen 6-inch guns, of which only five had been\n\n__________\n\n6 See charts opposite pp. 24 and 25.\n\n9\n\ninstalled, twelve 37-mm. guns and twenty-four 13.2-mm. AA machine guns.\n\nSafi.[7]- The harbor of Safi had been fortified by two Navy coast defense batteries, the Batterie Railleuse and the Batterie des Passes.\n\nThe Batterie Raileuse was located on the Pointe de la Tour, a promontory jutting our into the Atlantic 2 Â¾ miles northwest of Safi. Here the French had placed four 130-mm. guns on circular concrete emplacements. Estimated range: 19,000 yards; estimated rate of fire: 8 rounds per gun per minute. The fire of this battery was controlled by a fire control station equipped with a modern range finder. Four .50-caliber AA machine guns had also been mounted.\n\nThe Batterie des Passes consisted of two 75-mm. guns and was situated about 2,000 yards north of the city.\n\nAbout 2 miles south of Safi an army battery had been emplaced. It consisted of three 155-mm. guns. Its exact location was not determined until operations began.\n\nOther fixed defenses need not be considered as they played no appreciable part in the operations.\n\nMobile Defenses\n\nThe fixed defenses of the Moroccan coast were supplemented by mobile defenses drawn in Morocco was 13 infantry regiments, 8 cavalry regiments,[8] and 4 artillery regiments plus 3 batteries. The exact composition of the French land forces need not detain us.[9] Suffice to say these forces were variegated, colorful, and picturesque and could undoubtedly have put up a stiff resistance had they so desired. The only ones to do so were the professional soldiers of the Foreign Legion.\n\nThe artillery consisted of two regiments of African artillery, two regiments of Colonial artillery and three batteries of the Foreign Legion. Most of the field pieces were 75âs, but some were 65âs. In addition there was one regiment of antiaircraft artillery. These mobile units caused considerable trouble by compelling our transports to keep well out of range and by contesting the advance of the landing parties. They frequently\n\n__________\n\n7 See chart opposite p. 47.\n\n8 The famous Chasseurs dâAfrique have been motorized.\n\n9 A French infantry regiment normally consists of 3,120 men, a cavalry regiment of 1,140 men, an artillery regiment of 1,683 men. The strength of batteries varies. The 75âs usually have 98 men to a battery, the 105âs 108 men. The motorized batteries of 75-mm. guns muster about 170 men.\n\n10\n\nbolstered the fixed defenses by taking positions in emplacements usually prepared in advance. Owing to their mobility- some were motorized, others were horse-drawn- their location could not be determined beforehand.\n\nThe French air forces in Morocco were too inconsiderable to be able to affect operations. The total number of planes, both Army and Navy, in the area was estimated at 168. During the landing operations at Fedala and Mehdia some Italian planes were identified among those strafing the beaches. In addition to the air base at Port Lyautey, numerous air fields were scattered throughout Morocco, weakly defended by antiaircraft units.\n\nThe French naval forces\n\nIntelligence reports credited the French with the following vessels based on Casablanca.\n\nJean Bart, battleship 1\n\nGloire, Primauguet, light cruises 2\n\nAlbatros, Le Malin, Milan,[10] flotilla leaders 3\n\nAlcyon, Brestois, Fougueux, Frondeur, Simoun, TempÃªte, destroyers 6\n\nActÃ©on, ArchimÃ©de, Aurote, CÃ©res, ConquÃ©rant, Iris, MÃ©duse,\n\nOrphÃ©e, Pallas, PsychÃ©, Tonnant, VÃ©nus, submarines 12\n\nBoudeuse, sloop 1\n\nThis list, except for some unimportant errors in names, proved substantially correct.[11]\n\nThese vessels, with the exception of the Jean Bart, were in full commission and fully manned. Well-trained, well-equipped, thoroughly disciplined and the leadership is energetic and able,â is how one report summed up the situation.\n\nORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED STATES\n\nAMPHIBIOUS FORCE\n\nThe organization of the Amphibious Force command by Rear Admiral Hewitt, designated Task Force HOW[12], varied at different\n\n__________\n\n10 Considerable confusion has crept into the reports due to the similarity of these last two names.\n\n11 By the time our forces reached Casablanca, the Gloire and one submarine had been detached, one destroyer and two sloops added.\n\n12 Numbers identifying task forces have been omitted from all Combat Narratives in the interest of security. Navy flag names for the first letter of surnames of commanding officers have been substituted.\n\n11\n\ntimes as the operations progressed. Roughly speaking, the Task Force went through three states: (a) departure, (b) passage, (c) attack, the details of which will be found in Appendix I. The basic idea was the formation of a Covering Group to contain the French Fleet at Casablanca and, if necessary, the French units at Dakar, while three Attack Groups effected landings at Mehdia, Fedala, and Safi.\n\nThe expeditionary force which participated in these operations was built around two Army divisions, the Sixth and the Ninth. Both were reinforced by special detachments. This force was command devolved as soon as satisfactory beachheads were established.\n\nCare had been taken to make this force as letter-perfect in amphibious operations as circumstances permitted. The doctrine adopted by the United States Army was the result of tests conducted for a period of 3 years prior to the North African campaign. The unit chosen for these maneuvers was the First Division, United States Army.[13] During the winter of 1939-40 this division began its experimental work at Culebra Island, Puerto Rico, and continued it in northern waters. Gradually evolving principles which form the âbasic trainingâ of the Army.\n\nBriefly stated, the basic training, besides thorough physical conditioning, involved instruction in such details as the protection of critical items such as gas masks, rifles, and ammunition wile wading through surf, and the manner in which safe landings from boats to shore can be made. All Army contingents forming part of the Task Force had received this training prior to reporting to the transports. Whenever possible, as in the case of the Third Division which had been trained on the West Coast, this training was undergone on actual beaches. When this was not possible, a simulated landing was made. Automobiles riding over artificially undulating ground took the place of small boats. Beaches marked off were then occupied and unloading operations performed with as much realism as practicable.\n\nOnce at Hampton Roads the units were placed on transports and sent up Chesapeake Bay to Solomon Islands, where they remained on an average of 3 weeks performing actual landings. The training usually included three âdress rehearsals.â\n\n__________\n\n13 This division constituted the U.S. Army contingent in the Mediterranean landing which will be considered presently.\n\n12\n\nThe system adopted was undoubtedly the best that could be devised. It was deficient, however, in one important respect. No surf could be devised. It was deficient, however, in one important respect. No surf comparable to that encountered on the Moroccan coast was available. The heavy loss of landing craft which was the cause of so much trouble and anxiety had not been taken into consideration. No doctrine of boat salvage was perfected.[14] The North African landings had been scheduled perilously near the season of winter storms. In fact, one broke right after our landings were completed. Our unpreparedness to meet the meteorological risk was such that our avoidance of a costly failure has been described by many officers who participated as âprovidential.â\n\nDEPARTURE\n\nThe shipping problem was a difficult one. The Army contingent to be transported amounted to 1,920 officers and 35,385 men. The equipment and material were in proportion. Space had to be provided for 250 tanks. The landing craft were bulky and numerous. On 1 June 1942, there were but 8 ships assigned to and operating with the Amphibious Force, United States Atlantic Fleet. This number was gradually increased by assignment of newly constructed vessels, by the transfer of 5 ships from the West Coast and by the conversation of 11 ships during August and September, with the result that by 1 October 26 transports and 7 cargo ships had been assembled at Hampton Roads.\n\nBy 23 October loading operations were completed and the Task Force organization was put into effect. In order to avoid congestion, the Covering Group was dispatched to Casco Bay and the Air Group to Bermuda just before the main body sailed. The departure from the United States was set for 2 successive days. Detachment ONE, consisting of units assigned to the Mehdia and Safi landings, began threading its way through the swept channel at Hampton Roads about 1000 on 23 October.\n\nDetachment TWO, consisting of units intended for Fedala landings,\n\n__________\n\n14 âBoats that had been broached were abandoned at the critical time when a little judgement might have saved them, and having been abandoned to the mercy of the surf, soon were hopelessly battered to pieces. No doctrine had been laid down nor had men been instructed in the salvage of equipment that was undamaged and still serviceable.\n\nâTwo or three men with a few tools could have effectively salvaged enormous quantities of clocks, boat compasses, anchors, fire extinguishers, tools, propellers, etc. As it was, a few machine guns were saved but the lack of transportation facilitates and utter lack of guards to prevent pillaging at night by natives prevented any worthwhile efforts in this line.â (From report of a ranking officer.)\n\n13\n\nsortied 24 hours later. The Covering Force put sea from Casco Bay on 24 October. The air Group, however, did not leave Bermuda until the 25th.\n\nJust prior to sailing, the transport Harry Lee, fully combat-loaded, developed engine trouble. Her commanding officer, Capt. James W. Whitfield, performed the difficult task of transferring men and materials to the Calvert in the remarkably short time of 48 hours. With an escort consisting of the destroyers Boyle (Lt. Comdr. Eugene S. Karpe) and the Eberle (Lt. Comdr. Karl F. Poehlmann), the Calvert sailed from Hampton Roads on 25 October and joined the main body in mid-Atlantic on 30 October.[15]\n\nA picturesque touch was furnished by the S.S. Contessa. Considerable difficulty had been encountered finding a vessel of sufficiently light draft to negotiate the shallow, 12-mile passage up the Sebou River to Port Lyautey. Unless the planes our forces intended to land at that airport were to be immobilized through lack of gasoline and bombs, some means must be found to deliver these and other aviation supplies promptly. A survey of the available transports failed to disclose one that did not draw more than the channel depth, 17 feet. The Contessa, an old 5,5000-ton British-built fruit vessel, then en route to New York, was accordingly contacted by wireless and directed to Newport News. Although operated by the United States Maritime Commission, she flew the Honduran flag. Her captain, William H. John, was British, the first-mate Italian-American, the second mate Norwegian, the third mate American. The first engineer was British, the second German-American, the third Honduran. In her crew were Filipinos, Swedes, Danes, Estonians, Spaniards, Portuguese, Mexicans, Peruvians, Belgians, Brazilians, Finns, Arabs, and Australians.\n\nOn reaching Newport News the crew of the Contessa scattered before the vessel could be impressed into service and many men could not be reached. In order to man the ship, the jails of Norfolk were combed. With this motley crew her captain nevertheless volunteered to sail her unescorted over the submarine-infested Atlantic. A Reserve officer, Lieut. A.V. Leslie, was put on board as a âliaison officerâ with authority to assume command should the crew become obstreperous. The crew,\n\n__________\n\n15 This detachment was designated Task Group HOW 15.\n\n14\n\nhowever, proved exemplary. On 26 October the Contessa sailed indedendently from Hampton Roads.[16]\n\nThe largest armada in history was now on its way.\n\nTHE ATLANTIC CROSSING\n\nThe cruising formation of the Task Force[17] was normally as follows: The Protective Screen (consisting of the former Covering Group reinforced by additional destroyers) took station about 14 miles ahead of the convoy, the Air Group about 12 miles astern. The escort ships (Convoy Screen) formed an outer and an inner screen. The vessels of the outer screen maintained station approximately 10 miles ahead of the main body or at the extreme limits of visibility (about 8 miles) on the quarter or beam of the convoy. The vessels of the inner screen patrolled sectors approximately 6,500 yards ahead, 4,000 yards on the beam or 2,000 yards astern of the convoy. The convoy itself steamed in 9 columns preceded by the Augusta, the Force Flagship. The New York and the Texas headed the two outer columns. The escorting vessels not otherwise assigned were stationed around or among the transports with a line of lighter vessels to the rear to deal with trailing submarines.\n\nIn routing the Task Force across the Atlantic extreme care was taken to mystify the enemy as to the actual designation. Detachment ONE took an initial southerly course as if heading for the West Indies. When well clear of the coast this course was changed to east and later to north. Detachment TWO took a northeasterly course as if heading for the British Isles. The two groups effected their junction in the afternoon of 26 October. The Air Group proceeded northeast from Bermuda and joined the main body in the afternoon of 28 October, in approximately longitude 51áµ W., latitude 40áµ N. Here the course was changed sharply to the southeast, as if the ultimate destination were Dakar. This general\n\n__________\n\n16 The cruise of this vessel sounds like a story by Conrad. After a hectic voyage during which she lost her way, the Contessa turned up at Safi a few hours prior to that landing. She was thereupon headed up to Mehdia, escorted by the Cowie. Up the winding channel, over sand bars, past obstructions, the Contessa scraped her way in spite of dented plates and leaking steams. Two miles south of Port Lyautey she ran hard aground and, before she could be floated, the ebb tide swung her around until she was pointing down stream. She had accomplished her mission, however. Lighters were rushed out from the airport, which had just been occupied, and her invaluable cargo was safely disembarked.\n\n17 Unless otherwise specified, the term Task Force is applied to the Western Naval Task Force and the term Task Force Commander to Rear Admiral Hewitt.\n\n15\n\nsoutheasterly course, with slight variations necessitated by the fueling of the combat ships, was continued until a point was reached approximately due south of the Azores and west of Canary Islands. There the course was again changed to the northeast, in the general direction of the Straits of Gibraltar. Care was taken, however, to avoid possible unfriendly air searches from the Azores and the Canaries. Passing to the north of Madeira, the destroyers fueled again on 6 November, after which the entire Task Force proceeded to a point northeast of Casablanca, preparatory to separating according to objectives.\n\nOnce off soundings, the true destination of the expedition was revealed to the personnel, thereby putting an end to considerable speculation and arousing great enthusiasm. The âuseless chatterâ over the TBS that resulted brought a pointed admonition from Admiral Hewitt to whom it sounded âmore like a Chinese laundry at New Yearâs than a fleet going to war.â Other precautionary measures were taken in the interest of security. Nothing was to be thrown overboard during daylight. Bilges were not to be pumped until after twilight. All cans were to be well punctured before disposal.\n\nStringent regulations were adopted to deal with any craft sighting the Task Force. âNeutral merchant vessels and aircraft which are met at sea shall by their presence be considered as having established prima facie evidence of aiding the enemy,â read the instructions to the screen. All such vessels were to be boarded and set on the quickest course that would take them out of sight. If necessary to insure secrecy, they might be detained in an Allied port. Flagrant violations of the rules against unneutral service might lead to capture and even sinking. Aircraft were to be shot down.\n\nThe amount of drilling in small boat technique given the men during the crossing varied with the individual commanders. One ranking Army officer reported that on his transport âvery littleâ training was done en route and on the other âapparently less.â On the other hand, another officer noted that on his transport âall boat crews and soldiers familiarized themselves with the plan, harbor and facilities. Everyone rehearsed in their detailed duties.â\n\nRadio silence was strictly enforced, but at home the broadcasters were busy, so much so that many officers were afraid all their elaborate precautions would be nullified. When finally the magic word âCasablanca: came over the air âthe armchair jockeys who pontificate on the radio\n\n16\n\nand in the press to the menace of our lives and the detriment of our effortsâ were roundly denounced. âOne need not have the perspicacity of the Three Wise Men,â one irate officer reported, âto see that bit by bit injudicious admissions as to the location of likely operations have gone so far as to bring the name of Casablanca into the news. And here we are at sea, still hundreds of miles from our objective and the ocean lousy with U-bots.â No wonder the fleet zigzagged so continuously that its track looked like that âof a reeling drunk in the snow,â to quote one eye-witness. During one of these gyrations the Brooklyn was compelled to reverse engines to avoid colliding with the Hambleton. âI believe in a two-Navy ocean for you and me,â was the good-natured comment the cruiser made to the destroyer.\n\nOn 31 October a radio message was picked up. âGoing down slowly 35-06 North, 16-59 West. Many wounded and dying. Please send helpâ â a grim reminder of the serious business in hand.[18] In spite of frequent alarms no authenticated submarine attack was recorded. This is all the more remarkable and indicative of the efficacy of the protective measures adopted, as numerous enemy scouting lines had been formed across the route that was being traversed and the Task Force numbered no less than 99 vessels. One stationary line was reported along latitude 40áµ N., from Spain to the Azores. Another extended from the African coast westward to the Cape Verde Islands, thence south to Dakar. A third was said to extend initially from the west of the Azores to west of the Cape Verde Islands and to be retiring northeastward as the convoy approached. It is probable that the convoy was sighted by submarines as early as 25 October; yet no attacks developed.\n\nThe passage was an uneventful one. On 1 November, the Augusta radar spotted an unidentified aircraft crossing the convoy track from port to starboard, probably a clipper. On 2 November, the Doran reported that her number three magazine had been flooded, apparently with malicious intent. The saboteur, who was probably mentally deranged, was apprehended. On 3 November, a Ranger plane on antisubmarine patrol crashed. The personnel were rescued but the plane sank. On 4 November, the Miantonomah was forced to drop out because\n\n__________\n\n18 This distress signal undoubtedly was sent by the S.S Alaska (nor. Cgo. 5,681 tons), which was torpedoes about 1900Z, 30 October, at 35-06 N., 16-59 W., and sent distress signals on the 30th and 31st. When torpedoed, she had just picked up 55 survivors from the S.S President Doumer hit at 1865Z. The Alaska ultimately made port.\n\n17\n\nof excessive roll. The Raven was detailed to escort her, the two vessels to rejoin as soon as practicable. This was not until 4 days later. The voyage was drawing to an end, and as a result of the proximity of land, coastwise shipping was beginning to appear. On 5 November, a Portuguese streamer was sighted by the screen in time to be avoided by an emergency turn to port. The next day a Spanish streamer was picked up by the screen but, as she did not sight the convoy, was allowed to proceed. On 6 November fishing craft and coastal steamers were thereafter encountered. All were rounded up.\n\nAs the African coast was approached âthe progress of the political offensive fluctuated from day to day. One day it seemed that the French were going to resist, then word came that the Army and Air forces would not oppose us, and then that the attitude of the French Navy was in doubt. Everyone hoped that they would save their bullets for the Nazis, but French war psychology is completely inexplicable and we could take no chances.â\n\nOn the night of 6-7 November, weather dispatches from Cominch, the War Department and the beacon submarines[19] off the Moroccan coast were received. From these reports the fleet meteorologist was able to state that both wind and swell would decrease and that favorable weather conditions would prevail during the next 48 hours. The Force Commander therefore decided to put the attack plan in operation and signals to that effect were dispatched to all units. D-day Was set for 8 November and H-hour for 0400.[20]\n\nThe good fortune that had attended the expedition in its approach maneuvers was well summed up by one officer who reported as follows: âAgainst no other inhabited civilized coast could an approached have been made to a point within 16 miles of the main base, in darkness, using radar of all types, whistles and light maneuvering signals, fathometers and radio telephone without bringing down instant and strenuous oppositionâ¦ Without any intention to detract in the slightest from the success that was achieved, I must say seriously and emphatically that I do not believe\n\n__________\n\n19 Task Group HOW II consisted of: Barb(F), Lt.

A battle plan had accordingly been adopted in which targets were assigned to specific vessels of the Covering Group. That group now consisted of the Massachusetts (F), Tuscaloosa, Wichita; the destroyers Wainwright, Mayrant, Rhind, and Jenkins and the oiler Chemung. The Massachusetts had given the task of destroying the Jean Bart and the major caliber shore batteries. The forward turrets were to fire on the French battleship and the after turret on the heavier battery on Point El Hank. The Tuscaloosa had been assigned to submarines, cruisers, and other naval craft in Casablanca Harbor, in that priority. The Wichita was to open fire on the lighter battery on the tip of Point El Hank, then shift to submarines, cruisers, and other craft, thence to Table dâAukasha.[21] The destroyers were to provide antisubmarine screen for the heavy ships, destroy enemy submarines should they sortie, provide defense against air torpedo and bombing attacks, and destroy enemy light vessels and shore installations as might be directed.\n\nIn the event that the Task Force Commander should receive an indication of the surrender of the port of Casablanca, or of the desire of the armed forces therein for the peaceful entry of the American armed forces, the commander of the destroyers (Capt. Moon in the Wainwright) would, upon signal, proceed with utmost regard for the mine fields, enter the harbor, and take the necessary steps to immobilize French naval vessels and shore batteries. This special mission was never called into operation in view of the hostile attitude of the French forces.\n\nAdmiral Giffen was in command of the Covering Group, subject, however, to Admiral Hewitt who was in command of the entire Task Force. The various organizations and subdivisions of the Task Force have been criticized as unnecessarily complicated. Without going into that mooted question, it should be pointed out that the detailing of an appropriate force to deal with the French naval units, leaving the fire support units\n\n__________\n\n21 The Jean Bart was moored to the southeastern end of the MÃ´le du Commerce, the other vessels were berthed alog the JetÃ©e Delure.\n\nof the attack groups to give direct protection to the landings, was tactically sound and certainly proved effective. The French fleet was the main objective of the Covering Group, although in effecting its destruction that group inevitably came into contact with the shore defenses. The operations of the Covering Group, but they constituted a separate action designated to give indirect protection to the landing operations of all three attack groups by forestalling interference by the French naval units based on Casablanca.\n\nThe Battle of Casablanca falls into three phases. The first began with the opening moves for position and continued until the sortie by the French fleet which was completed at about 0830. The second phase is concerned mainly with the destruction of the French fleet, which was practically complete by 1300. The third and last phase is concerned with the engagement with the El Hank batteries and covers the period between 1300 until the retirement of the Covering Group at about 1600.\n\nFIRST PHASE\n\n7 November\n\n8 November\n\n0300 Casablanca receives second alert. 0610-0624 Nine planes launched. 0641-0642 Planes from Massachusetts encounter antiaircraft fire and hostile aircraft. 0702 Massachusetts open fire on enemy planes 0703 Gun flashes observed from El Hank and Jean Bart. 0704 Massachusetts opens fire on Jean Bart on first run. Tuscaloosa and Witchita follow. 0720 Massachusetts divides fire between El Hank and Jean Bart. 0741 Reserve run started. 0751 Wichita opens fire on Table dâAukasha 0818 Cruisers concentrate on harbor mouth 0833 Covering Group ceases firing.\n\nThe morning of 7 November found the Task Force proceeding in a general southeasterly direction. At 0655 the Southern Attack Group was\n\n20\n\nreleased and proceeded to its destination, Safi. Immediately thereafter the remaining groups changed course to 076.5áµ T., as if heading for the Straits of Gibraltar. At 1515 the North Attack Group was released and proceeded to its designation, Mehdia. At 1535 the Center Attack Group was released and, after some variations, ultimately settled down to a basic course of 145áµ T. In the meantime, the Covering Group, after a short run to the south, took an approximately parallel course of 144áµ T., which placed it about 10 miles to the southwest of the Center Attack Group is a position to cover it from any interference by the French fleet based on Casablanca. The plan called for the arrival of the three attack groups before their objectives about midnight when debarkation was to begin.\n\nAt 2215 the Covering Group changed course to 246áµ T. and proceeded to cover an irregular parallelogram designed to keep it between the Center Attack Group and Casablanca while debarkation was being effected and to bring it to a position to open fire on Casablanca at sunrise (0656) should it become necessary. After completing these four courses the Covering Group, at 0542 on the 8th took a course 245áµ T. and began the launching of planes. Between 0610 and 0624 nine planes had been launched as follows:\n\nANTISUBMARINE PATROL\n\nTuscaloosa\n\n2 SOC-3\n\nWichita\n\n1 SOC-3\n\nSPOTTING\n\nMassachusetts\n\n2 OS2U\n\nTuscaloosa\n\n2 SOC-3\n\nWichita 2 SOC-3\n\nThe normal formation of the Covering Group was as follows: The heavy ships proceeded in column, distance 1,000 yards, the Massachusetts (F) in the van, followed by the Tuscaloosa and the Witchita in that order. The heavy ships were screened by the four destroyer in a semicircular formation about 3,000 yards ahead of the flagship, the Wainwright and Mayrant to starboard, the Rhind and Jenkins to port.\n\nIn the meantime the French naval authorities at Casablanca had received a first alert shortly midnight, followed by a more serious one at about 0300 of the 8th. Nevertheless, no reconnaissance patrols were undertaken. Whatever routine patrols were maintained were so\n\n21\n\nineffective that our arrival off Casablanca was a distinct surprise. When, shortly before midnight on 7 November, our forces came within range of Point El Hank, the light was found burning. It was not extinguished until shortly after midnight.\n\nIt soon became apparent that the intelligence predictions to the effect that the French fleet and land batteries would offer considerable resistance were about to be realized. Intercepted messages from the Southern Attack Group thereupon began to maneuver itself into a position for the first run past Casablanca. At 0640, the course being 090áµ T, the group began closing the range.\n\nAt 0641 one of the spotting planes from the Massachusetts reported that it was under antiaircraft fire from the beach. One minute later the other plane reported that it had encountered hostile aircraft, followed at 0655 by a similar report from the first plane. At 0700 six fighter planes were observed ahead of the flagship at a very low altitude (about 1,200 feet) pursuing several of our SOC-3âs and one of our OS2Uâs. The order was therefore given to the flagship to engage the enemy aircraft.\n\nAt 0703 gun flashes were observed from the direction of El Hank and the Jean Bart, followed by several large splashes near the Massachusetts. Indeed, it is believed that the El Hank battery straddled the flagship on the first salvo. Five or six very large splashes, presumably from shells fired by the Jean Bart, were observed about 600 yards short, on the starboard bow of the flagship. The engagement, which up till then had been limited to aircraft, now became general. The cruisers had been previously directed to open fire when the flagship did so without further signal.\n\nOn the morning of 8 November the wind was from the southwest, force one to two; sea moderate with slight swell. In general, weather conditions were excellent except for surface haze, particularly near shore. As the morning wore on, however, sun glare and reflection added to the difficulty of spotting and observation. Little could be done to improve conditions insofar as sun glare was concerned except by staying to the\n\n22\n\nnortheast of the harbor, from which point the batteries of El Hank could not be bombarded.\n\nAt 0704 the main batteries of the flagship opened fire on the Jean Bart, range 24,400 yards, bearing 131.5áµ T. Thereafter, during the first run, the range to the Jean Bart varied from 23,200 yards at 0711, to 29,600 yards at 0740. During this period one hit on the Jean Bart, and two on the MÃ´le du Commerce were noted. No radar ranges or bearings were obtained since the fire control radars on the flagship became inoperative after the second or third salvo. Air spot was also uncertain during this period because of the smoke, antiaircraft fire, and enemy fighters. Indirect fire based on a bearing obtained on the El Hank Lighthouse was used. After about 15 minutes, however, the main battery of the Jean Bart ceased firing and did not fire again during the day.[22]\n\nAt 0720 the flagship divided her fire. Turret No. 3 shifted to the El Hank battery while the forward turrets continued firing at the Jean Bart. The range of Point El Hank at this time was 22,900 yards, bearing 173áµ T.\n\nDuring this opening period of the action the course of the Covering Group was 050áµ T. and thereafter, until 0730, speed varied from 20 to 27 knots. Various courses were steered, the mean course being 055áµ T. From 0730 until the end of the first run at 0741 the course was 090áµ T. Small changes in course and speed were made at frequent intervals in order to make it as difficult as possible for the enemy fire control. In general, course changes were made towards the last splashes (i.e., âchasing the splashesâ). Later, this became impracticable in views of the fact that the heavier ships, particularly the flagship, were often straddled.\n\nAt 0705 the Tuscaloosa opened fire on the submarine berthing area in Casablanca Harbor, and at 0719 she shifted fire to the shore batteries at Table dâAukasha, the opening range being 27,000 yards, minimum range 24,800 yards. Plane spot was used. After 20 minutes the batteries were silenced.\n\nThe Wichita opened fire at 0766 on El Hank, range 21,800 yards (using reduced charges) and at 0727 shifted fire (with full charges) to the submarine area in the harbor, range 27,000 yards.\n\nAt this stage of the operations enemy planes appeared in considerable numbers. At one time what were believed to be several French torpedo\n\n__________\n\n22 Turret No. 1, the only one containing guns, had become jammed.\n\n23\n\nplanes were observed. These, however, did not come within antiaircraft range and made no attacks.\n\nAt 0741 the course was changed to south, preparatory to a reverse run to the westward, and at 0748 the course was steadied at 270áµ T. The forward turrets of the Massachusetts resumed fire on the Jean Bart. The initial range was 26,000 yards. It varied thereafter from 25,000 yards at 0756 to 31,600 yards at 0828.\n\nAt 0803, the course being, then 280áµ T., the flagship resumed firing at Point El Hank with turret number three, initial range 24,000 yards, the range thereafter increasing to 28,900 yards at 0818 and decreasing to 27,400 yards at 0831. Between 0828 and 0833 three salvos frim all three turrets were fired at Point El Hank at a mean range of about 27,000 yards.\n\nThe Tuscaloosa commenced firing on a second run at 0759 on targets in the harbor (initial range 22,500 yards), shifting at 0810 to Point El Hank (range 28,000 yards). Firing ceased at 0823 as the harbor targets were then out of range.\n\nThe Wichita opened fire at Table dâAukasha at 0751, checked firing in a few minutes when a plane reported that the batteries there were not firing, and at 0806 resumed fire on the ships in the harbor, mean range 24,500 yards.\n\nBoth cruisers had been ordered at 0818 to concentrate on the harbor entrance after the planes had reported that the enemy submarines were preparing to sortie.\n\nNo hits were made on ships of the Covering Group during the first phase, although there were many splashes close aboard.\n\nAt 0830 a message was intercepted to the effect that the Army was encountering no resistance and that the Navy fire was damaging the city. Cease fire was therefore ordered at 0833 pending clarification of the situation. The Covering Group started to withdraw on course 340áµ T., although the secondary battery of the Jean Bart was firing what appeared to be two destroyers were observed standing out of Casablanca Harbor. The French were making a sortie frim Casablanca, thereby initiating the second phase of the battle.\n\n24\n\nDamage to Jean Bart, bow\n\nDamage to Jean Bart, stern\n\n0-44-566293 Faces p. 24\n\n0-44-566293 Faces p. 25\n\nWreck of the Frondeur\n\nThe Primauguet, Albatros, and Milan beached outside Casablanca\n\nThe outstanding event of the first phase had been the wrecking of the Jean Bart, which had been hit by 16-inch shells from the Massachusetts,[23] besides being struck by two small bombs. As a result her stern settled until she rested on the bottom.\n\nSECOND PHASE\n\n0610-0730 French submarines sortie. 0715-0745 French destroyers sortie. 0818 Augusta plane reports movement. 0820 Milan opens fire. 0843 Augusta opens fire, followed by Brooklyn. 0918 Massachusetts opens fire, followed by Wichita and Tuscaloosa. 0925 Massachusetts disables Milan and Fougueux. 1000 Primauguet sorties. Fougueux sinks. 1003-1021 French submarines attack. 1045 Boulonnais sinks. 1100\n\nMassachusetts withdraws to save ammunition.\n\nBrestois, Frondeur and Primauguet hit.\n\n1145\n\nCruisers of Covering Group sweep coast to southward.\n\nAlbatros damaged.\n\n1300 Cruisers rejoin Massachusetts and withdraw to northwest.\n\nThe second phase of the action was the destruction of the French naval units which sortied from Casablanca.\n\nThe French warships in Casablanca Harbor proved to be the battleship Jean Bart, the light cruiser Primauguet, the flotilla leaders (contretorpilleurs) Milan (F), Albatros, Le Malin, the destroyers Alcyon, Boulonnais, Brestois, Fougueux, Frondeur, Simoun, TempÃªte, the submarines Amazone, Amphitrite, Antiope, ConquÃ©rant, MÃ©duse, OrÃ©ade, OrphÃ©e, PsychÃ©, sidi-Ferruch, Sybille, Tonnant, and the sloops Commandant Delage Gracieuse, GrandiÃ©re.[24] They were under the command of Rear Admiral Gervais de Lafond.\n\nAs has been noted, the French fleet in the harbor had for some time been subject to a devastating bombardment. The Jean Bart had been wrecked by the fire of the Massachusetts. The submarines Amphitrite, PsychÃ© and OrÃ©ade had also been sunk at their moorings by the\n\n__________\n\n23 Two of these shells are known to have exploded. Two orders struck at such angles that the base of each was deformed and the fuze and explosive content forced out before detonation. However, one of these âdudsâ was the shells which jammed turret No. 1 in train and thus prevented the ship from firing for several crucial hours.\n\n24 Cf. intelligence report above.\n\n25\n\nbombardment. The flotilla leader Le Malin, while moored to the JetÃ©e Delure, was hit by a shell from the Massachusetts which struck the jetty, tunneled through, and entered the port side of the vessel without exploding, causing a bulge outward on the starboard side. The Le Malin did not sortie, nor did the destroyers Simoun and TempÃ©te, then undergoing repairs.\n\nBetween 0610 and 0730 the submarines Amazone, Antiope, ConquÃ©rant, MÃ©duse, OrphÃ©e, Sidi Ferruch, Sybille and Tonnant had sortied. The subsequent operations of these vessels cannot be definitely stated. Their ultimate fate is all that us known beyond doubt. The MÃ©duse was beached near Mazagan. The Tonnant reached Cadiz and was scuttled by her crew on 15 November. The Amazone and the Antiope managaged to make Dakar. The ConquÃ©rant, Sidi Ferruch and Sybille were never reported. The OrphÃ©e was the only submarine to return to Casablanca.\n\nBetween 0715 and 0745 the French destroyers put to sea and headed northeast in the following order: Destroyer Division II (Milan, Albatros), Destroyer Division 5 (Brestois, Boulonnais), Destroyer Division 2 (Fougueux, Frondeur, Alcyon). Each division was in column and the columns in echelon. The Primauguet did not sortie at this time.\n\nAt 0818 a plane from the Augusta reported the movement to the Task Force Commander, who relayed the information to the Covering Group at 0822 and to the Air Group 0840. At 0859 the Covering Group was ordered to head for Fedala, speed 27 knots, and at 0915 received orders to destroy the French vessels.\n\nIn the meantime the cruisers of the Center Fire Support (Augusta, Brooklyn) together with four destroyers (Wilkes, Swanson, Ludlow, Rowan) were streaming at 27 knots to intercept the oncoming French vessels.[25] At 0820 the Milan opened fire on the Wilkes. Her shots were short. At 0835 Destroyer Division TWO opened fire. The Augusta replied at 0843, followed at 0848 by the Brooklyn. Firing continued until 0904 at ranges from 13,000 to 24,000 yards. At 0855 the French destroyers temporarily reversed their course but soon returned to the attack, whereupon the Brooklyn resumed fire at 0909 and the Augusta\n\n__________\n\n25 No track chart of the French ship movements is available. The track chart of the Center Fire Support is too involved to reproduce. The evolutions of those vessels covered a small area and were designated to keep them within range of the French as long as possible without prejudice to the protection of the transport area.\n\n26\n\n0915. The French vessels broke the engagement about 0920 and headed back to Casablanca.\n\nOn the way they were engaged by the Covering Group. At 0918 the Massachusetts opened fire, followed by the Wichita at 0919 and the Tuscaloosa at 0925. The French returned the fire at once. Their fire control was excellent. The Massachusetts was hit twice, with slight damage. Another shell passed through the flagshipâs colors. These hits. However, may have come from El Hank battery.\n\nIt was during this period that the French sustained their first losses. At 0925 the Massachusetts reported that the flotilla leader with which she had been engaged was seen with only her bow out of water. This undoubtedly was the Milan, which had been hit by three shells below the water line and two or three near the bridge and had caught fire twice. She was ultimately (1400) beached near Roches Noires. The flagship then shifted to another target which appeared to be a destroyer. After three salvos the target completely disappeared. She was probably the Fougueux, which sank about 0930 in latitude 33áµ 42â N., longitude 07áµ 37â W. At 1016 the Covering Group ceased firing.\n\nAt this point the Center Fire Support reengaged the retreating enemy, the Brooklyn opening fire at 1015 and the Augusta at 1025. At 1030 the Covering Group resumed firing. A âmelee engagementâ with the French destroyers ensued during which, at 1045, the Brooklyn received her only hit by a shell which, although it did not explode, injured six men.\n\nAt this stage of the action the Primauguet sortied from Casablanca, rallied the Boulonnais, which had damaged her steering gear and had fallen behind, and proceeded once more up the coast toward Fedala with the other destroyers. The French vessels soon found themselves under the combined fire of the Covering Group and the Center Fire Support. Hits began to accumulate. At 1045 the Boulonnais sank in latitude 33áµ 40â N., longitude 07áµ 34â W., mainly as the result of fire from the Augusta. The remaining destroyers (Frondeur, Alcyon) formed on the Brestois. At about 1100 this vessel took a bad list and with difficulty managed to return to port where she capsized off the JetÃ©e Delure at 2400. The same fate befell the Frondeur which returned to port about the same time down by the stern. She sank at her berth during the night. It is impossible to assign the hits on these three vessels. Their destruction was\n\n27\n\nprobably the work of several ships. The color splashes reported by the French would so indicate.[26]\n\nAt 1102 the Center Fire Support ceased firing except for occasional long range shots by the Brooklyn.\n\nBy 1100 the Massachusetts had expanded 60 percent of her 16-inch ammunition and the preservation of the remainder was considered essential against a possible sortie by the Richelieu from Dakar. The cruisers of the Covering Group had expended an even higher percentage, but it was felt that their attendant upon further depletion of the flagshipâs main battery ammunition. Accordingly, at 1102, the commanding officer of the Tuscaloosa was ordered to take the Wichita and the Rhind under his command and close with the enemy light forces. At 1106 the flagship ceased firing and hauled away to the northward while the cruisers and the Rhind stood in and engaged the enemy vessels which were attempting to regain the harbor. Firing continued until 1142. It was while engaging the enemy at close quarters that the Wichita was hit by a French shell (1128) which injured 14 men.\n\nBy this time the only French vessels afloat were the Primauguet, Albatros and Alcyon. Shortly after 1100 the Primauguet was badly hit, five shells striking below the water line and an 8-inch shell in No. 3 turret. She came in and anchored off Roches Noires. (Between 1400 and 1700 she was bombed and strafed and her whole forward half wrecked. A direct hit on the bridge killed the captain, the executive officer and 7 other officers.) About one-half hour later (1130) the Albatros was hit by 2 shells, 1 of which was below the water line forward.[27] At 1145 she received 2 bomb hits amidships. Completely helpless, she asked for a tow. While being towed back to Casablanca she was shelled and strafed. She was eventually beached at Roches Noires. Of a crew of 200, 25 were reported killed and 80 wounded. The inly surface vessel to return safely to Casablanca was the destroyer Alcyon which made port about 1130.\n\nAt about noon the three sloops Commandant Delage, Grazieuse and GrandiÃ©re, which had remained in the harbor during the engagement,\n\n__________\n\n26 The color splash of the AP ammunition used by the Massachusetts and the Brooklyn was green, that of the Augusta red. The destroyers did not use color splashes. The bombardment ammunition of our cruisers was also free from color.\n\n27 The French timetable, from which these times are taken, only gives approximate times.\n\n28\n\nsortied to pick up the survivors of the Boulonnais, Fougueux, and Milan. While so doing they became engaged with the Augusta and the Brooklyn at 1326. The GraniÃ©re was slightly damaged by bombs at 1330.\n\nAt about 1145 a message was intercepted from the Task Force Commander stating that an enemy cruiser was laying a smoke screen southwest of Casablanca and heading down the coast. The cruisers of the Covering Group, screened by the Rhind, were order to sink her. No trace of this cruiser was found so at 1300 our cruiser headed back to rejoin the flagship.\n\nWith the withdrawal of the Covering Group the second phase of the battle ended. It had witnessed the practical annihilation of the French fleet.\n\nNOTE: The sortie of the French fleet had been the occasion for some submarine activity. At 1003, just after the course had been change from 250áµ T. to 230áµ T. (see tracked chart of Massachusetts), the wakes of four torpedoes were sighted by the executive officer of the Massachusetts about 60áµ on the port bow at a distance of less than 1,000 yards. By skillful maneuvering the flagship passed between numbers three and four in the spread, counting from the left. Number four torpedo passed a few feet outboard of the starboard paravane. All ran very shallow. It is believed that they were fired by a submarine at a range of between 4,000 and 5,000 yards. Emergency signals were made by flag hoist to the ships astern. After avoiding the torpedoes, the ship changed course to 240áµ T. At 1018 the course was changed to 090áµ T. in order to overtake what appeared to be a submarine on the surface and a ship on the port quarter. At 1021 another torpedo wake was sighted and passed about 100 yards to port. In the meantime, at 1010, an unsuccessful submarine attack was made on the Brooklyn. The wakes of four torpedoes were observed, as well as the bubbles from the tubes.\n\nTHIRD PHASE\n\n1326 Covering Group begins search for enemy vessels reported proceeding to Fedala. 1341 Massachusetts located one destroyer. El Hank open fire. 1355 Cruiser of Covering Group continued search, advancing to mouth of Casablanca Harbor. 1450 Land batteries at Casablanca compel retirement. 1558 Massachusetts fire salvo at El Hank, then retires with Covering Group.\n\n29\n\nThe third phase of the engagement began with a search for French units which were reported steaming along the coast with the probable intention of interfering with our landing operations. The action soon developed, however, into an attempt to silence the persistent batteries at Point El Hank which had maintained an intermittent fire during the entire battle. These batteries, as well as the other fixed defenses, were manned by naval personnel, which probably accounts for their determined resistance.\n\nAt 1302 a message was received from the Task Force Commander that two cruisers and a destroyer had been reported standing up the coast from Casablanca to Fedala. At this time the Covering Group cruisers and the Rhind had not yet rejoined from their sweep to the southwest in pursuit of another French cruiser which had been reported as having slipped through. At 1326 the Covering Group set course 080áµ T. toward Fedala and increased speed to 27 knots, At 1340 the Massachusetts opened fire in a light vessel, bearing 136áµ T., range 22,000 yards. If the French timetable is correct, the only vessel that could possibly have been in the neighborhood of Fedala was one of the three sloops. Only two salvos, however, were fired at this target, as the El Hank batteries opened at 1341 with excellent aim. All turrets were shifted accordingly to that target at 1345. The range was 19,000 yards, increasing gradually to 23,000 yards when firing ceased at 1350.\n\nAbout this time the Task Force Commander ordered the Covering Group to destroy before nightfall the light forces which appeared to be making sorties frim Casablanca. At 1355, accordingly, the cruisers, plus the Rhind, stood in toward the harbor, this time from the direction of Fedala in ordered to avoid gunfire from El Hank. An enemy vessel, undoubtedly the Brestois, was shelled near entrance at range of 17,000 yards. No gunfire was observed from the French ships but the shore batteries again forced retirement at about 1450. At that time two other enemy vessels were observed outside the harbor, near the entrance. One of them (obviously the Milan) was on fire, another (probably the Albtros) was beached.\n\nAt 1423 the Massachusetts received orders from the Task Force Commander to preserve ammunition for a possible sortie of the Richelieu from Dakar and, as a result, broke off the action. There were, however, several loaded 16-inch guns on the flagship and it was decided to unload them on Point El Hank. This was done at 1558 at a range of about\n\n30\n\n30,000 yards. After one ranging shot a six-gun salvo was fired. Although over, the Salvo apparently hit explosive or inflammable stores. As an unusually large explosion was noted.[28]\n\nShortly thereafter the flagship was joined by the cruisers and the group stood out to sea, thereby terminating the third phase of the battle.\n\nSummary\n\nThe performance of the Covering Group in clearing the way for the troop landing had been an outstanding one despite the failure of the radar to function properly on the larger units of the fleet. The concussion of the large caliber guns soon put the greater number of the radar range finders out of commission. As a result the expenditure of ammunition was much greater than had been anticipated.\n\nThe following table is illuminating.\n\nShip Battery Percent Expended Massachusetts\n\n16 inch\n\n5 inch\n\n67\n\n2.25\n\nTuscaloosa\n\n8 inch\n\n5 inch\n\n85\n\n1\n\nWichita\n\n8 inch\n\n5 inch\n\n83\n\n7\n\nWainwright\n\n8 inch\n\n5 inch\n\n25 Rhind 5 inch 8 Mayrant 5 inch 30 Jenkins 5 inch 6\n\nIt will be noted that the Massachusetts, Tuscaloosa, and Wichita had expended so great a portion of their heavy caliber ammunition that they would have been seriously embarrassed if compelled immediately to go into action against the larger units of the French Navy.\n\nA similar state of affairs existed on some of the other vessels of the fleet. The Brooklyn, which had been operating off Fedala, reported a total ammunition expenditure of 75 percent.\n\nThe performance of the French naval forces, both ships and batteries, throughout the entire engagement was excellent. Their gunnery was accurate, straddles being frequently made on the first salvo. That more hits were not scored on our vessels was due to the skill with which they\n\n__________\n\n28 As only AP 16- inch shells had been issued to the Massachusetts, the damage inflicted on shore batteries was less than that obtainable had HC shells been employed. The Massachusetts, however, had to be prepared to fight the Richelieu as well as the Jean Bart.\n\n31\n\nmaneuvered and to the high angle of fall of the French projectiles at long range.\n\nThe opinion of the officers of the Massachusetts, which had been principally engaged in the destruction of the Jean Bart, was that the French ship fired only five or six salvos.[29] In all probability she was receiving electric power from the shore, and fairly early in the engagements this power was temporarily cut off by a shell from the Massachusetts. During the engagement she put up a smoke screen generated from the dock and kept it over her throughout the day. As a result the Jean Bart was not definitely silenced until the afternoon of the 10th, when she was bombed 1,000-pound bombs, one of which struck her starboard side aft. In spite of the destruction wrought by these bombs, the vesselâs 15-inch guns and fire-control apparatus were still serviceable.\n\nToward the end of the first run the officers in the Massachusetts believed that the batteries at El Hank were out of commission but this supposition proved to be erroneous. The shells from the American vessels probably temporarily compelled the crew of the batteries to seek shelter. After our vessels ceased firing the French repaired whatever slight damage had been caused and continued firing whenever the American vessels came within range.\n\nIn the Battle of Casablanca our surface ships enjoyed excellent air support. The Ranger, accompanied by the Cleveland and screened by the Ellyson, Corry and Hobson, was operating off Casablanca. The Suwannee and Chenango, screened by the Forrest and Fitch, were in the same vicinity. The Suwannee conducted combat air and antisubmarine patrols for the carriers as well as for the ships off Fedala.\n\nAt 0615 the Ranger launched 18 fighter planes to neutralize the Rabat-Sale airport, and at 0635 17 scout bombers to attack submarines and surface ships at Casablanca and the batteries at El Hank and Table dâAukasha. At 0700 the Suwannee launched 8 TBFâs to destroy submarines and surface ships at Casablanca, while the Ranger sent 18 fighters to the same area. These planes supplemented the bombardment by our surface ships, and when the French vessels sortied our planes attacked\n\n__________\n\n29 In view of the fact that the Jean Bart had never had any target practice and could not use her larger range finder because of the neighboring building, her accuracy of fire was remarkable. Her rate of fire, however, was slow. So was that of the other French vessels.\n\n32\n\nthem with bombs and by strafing. The latter was particularly effective against the lighter vessels, and our airmen believed it played an important part in turning them back to the harbor. At 1252 the Task Force Commander ordered our planes to cease attacking the French warships in the harbor, but to continue attacks to cease attacks on those outside. At 1306 the Ranger launched planes to destroy enemy vessels standing out of the harbor, but with orders not to block the channel. An hour later 16 fighters were launched to attack the light forces which appeared to be making sorties.\n\nMeanwhile the shore batteries had been bombed repeatedly. By evening the Jean Bart had been hit at least once, and undetermined damage had been inflicted on other vessels. The Ranger alone had launched 205 flights, which âsecured complete air superiority and gravely damaged Vichy naval units and shire batteries in the Casablanca area, which was the center of the military defense of French Morocco.â\n\nIn closing this summary of the naval action of 8 November, it should be noted that the rank and file of the French Navy fought doggedly, courageously, and skillfully against heavy odds.[30] What is less obvious, however, is their motive for so doing. It is probably to be found in the high sense of professional honor that had always characterized the French naval service. Our forces had not heard the last of the French Navy. Two days later, on 10 November, the Gracieuse and Commandant Delage sortied again and started to shell our troops northeast of Casablanca. The Augusta, supported by the Edison and Rowan, engaged them, firing 10 salvos between 1139 and 1156, at ranges of 16,000 to 18,000 yards. The Commandant Delage was hit, whereupon the French sloops withdrew. This sortie may well have been for the purpose of enticing some of the American vessels within range of the guns of the Jean Bart, which were one more in working order.\n\n__________\n\n30 Unofficial estimates place the French losses at about 500 killed and 800 wounded. Among the seriously wounded was Rear Admiral Gervais de Lafond. The moral of the French naval forces has been summed up by one ranking officer as follows: âHonestly demands that the lassitude, notwithstanding their bravery, of the French, and the providential good luck attending the United States forces, be recognized as heavy contributing factors. No other enemy, equipped with air and submarines, would have failed to detect the approaching force by or before dark the day before their appearance off shore, or failing that, could have been alerted 6 hours before daylight by the presence of enemy ships 16 miles from his principle base, and failed to used his 11 submarines before daylight and his air force by or before daylight.â\n\nTHE ATTACK ON MEHDIA AND THE PORT LYAUTEY\n\nAIRFIELD (NORTHERN ATTACKS)[31]\n\nThe operations against Mehdia and the adjoining airfield at Port Lyautey had as their object the securing of that harbor and airfield with a view of employing them in the subsequent attack on Casablanca, 65 miles to the south.\n\nThe United States force engaged was the North Attack Group (Task Group HOW 8), Rear Admiral Kelly, consisting of the following units:\n\nFire Support: Texas (F), Savannah, Roe, Kearney, Ericson.\n\nTransports: Algorab, Henry T. Allen, Susan B. Anthony, Anne Arundel, George Clymer, Electra, Florence Nightingale. John Penn. A/S Screen and Minesweepers: Livermore, Eberle, Parker, Raven, Osprey.\n\nThe destroyer Dallas was on a special assignment to proceed up the Sebou River to Port Lyautey. The oiler Kennebec, with two specially constructed fire support craft on board, was attached to the Northern Attack Group. The seaplane tender Barnegat, Comdr. Felix L. Baker, joined from the United Kingdom on 7 November and was assigned to the Port Lyautey operation.\n\nThe functions of the naval force were to be as follows:\n\n(1) To land the troops at designated beaches at H-hour (0400).\n\n(2) To unload equipment and land same ashore.\n\n(3) To serve as fire support for the Army units ashore.\n\n(4) To screen and support the transport area and to maintain anti-surface, submarine and air patrols.\n\nThe Army contingent (Task Group ZEBRA) forming part of the Northern Attack Group was under the command of Brig. Gen. Lucian K. Truscott, Jr. and consisted of the following units:\n\nSixtieth Infantry, Ninth Division, reinforced.\n\nRanger Detachment, United States Army.\n\nOne light armored battalion combat team, Second Armored Division.\n\nTotal: 526 officers, 8,573 enlisted men, 65 light tanks.\n\nFollowing the general pattern of the campaign, command of the landing forces devolved on the Army as soon as satisfactory beachheads were established.\n\n__________\n\n31 See chart opposite p. 46\n\n34\n\n0-44-566293 Faces P. 35\n\n7 November\n\n1900 Roe detached to locate beacon submarine.\n\n2150 Roe retired after failing to locate submarine.\n\n2321 Northern Attack Group reaches transport area.\n\n8 November\n\n0200 Dallas embarks Ranger detachment and Fighting French detachment.\n\n0411 Fire support vessels take station.\n\n0515 First landing made\n\n0605 French open fire on landing parties.\n\n0607 Six planes launched.\n\n0629 Shore batteries at Mehdia open fire on Roe.

Kasba isolated.\n\nThe airfield of Port Lyautey is situated about 9 miles up the Sebou River at the end of a long bend. The town itself is about 2 miles further upstream. Port Lyautey was undefended except for some mobile artillery and antiaircraft guns. The river mouth at Mehdia, however, was defended by the two batteries previously mentioned. Besides these fixed defenses the French had mounted two field pieces on flatcars that could be moved up and down the south bank of the river as needed. A lagoon 3Â½ miles in length runs parallel to the coast and added considerably to the strength of the French position. The original plan of attack called for landings on five beaches and a run past the batteries of Mehdia and up the river by the Dallas.\n\n35\n\nAt 1900 on 7 November the destroyer Roe departed from the formation to locate the beacon submarine off the entrance of the river. Although she was challenged once, no action developed. In spite of a thorough searched the submarine could not be located. Due to shortage of time and the necessity of obtaining fixes, the search was discontinued shortly after 2150, and the Roe approached the mouth of the river and reported several fixes by voice radio to Admiral Kelly. This done, the Roe took station about 2,000 yards from the river jetties. At 2321 the transports arrived in the transport area located about 7 miles off the mouth of the river.\n\nOn Sunday, 8 November, weather conditions were: wind from the northeast, force 5 to 12 knots, partly cloudy, sea smooth.\n\nAt approximately 0200 on 8 November, the Dallas received on board the Ranger detachment from the transport Susan B. Anthony. Mr. RenÃ© Malavergne of the Fighting French, former chief pilot of the Sebou River, came on board with the Rangers preparatory to piloting the Dallas up the river, her mission being the capture of the airport at Port Lyautey.\n\nAt 0310 the Texas and the Savannah intercepted radio press reports from Washington announcing the landing of American and British forces in the vicinity of Oran and Algiers. The hour of the Algerian debarkations had been set 3 hours ahead of the Moroccan landings were delayed nearly until morning twilight in order to enable these attack groups to continue as long as possible the deception as to real destination. In spite of these announcements a complete surprise was effected.\n\nAt 0411 the destroyers of the Fire Support took their stations; the Roe to the south of the river mouth, the Kearny to the north of the river mouth, the Edison in reserve.\n\nIn the meantime the assault troops had been placed in the landing boats, the operation having been begun shortly after midnight. Three methods of debarkation had been provided for, depending upon weather conditions. In the first the ships were to anchor at their positions in the transport area. This was considered the ideal method but was not used became of the increasing wind. The second method provided that the ships should keep under way. Making a lee first to port then to starboard. The third method provided that the sips should anchor long enough to hoist out boats and lighters and then lie to with a lee to starboard. The second method was the one adopted.\n\nThe boats used in the North African landings represented the latest\n\n36\n\ndevelopments in amphibious equipment at the time, although many of the designs have since been suspended. The type used are too numerous to be described in detail, ranging all the way from small rubber boats with outboard motors and having a capacity of 7 men, to craft capable of carrying 120 men. All were flat-bottomed so as to permit running well up on the beaches. The larger ones were snub-nosed and equipped with ramps forward that lowered so as to form a runway for motor vehicles. Some type were armored and mounted 30- and 50- caliber machine guns. The specially constructed fire-support craft carried on the Kennebec, Merrimack, and Winooski were equipped with two multiple rocket projectors which permitted lobbing a shower of explosive on the enemy position immediately prior to the arrival of the assault troops.[32]\n\nOwning to the weight involved, loading had to be made into waterborne craft. This procedure proved troublesome and risky as the men, even those in the first waves, were carrying full equipment. The metal nets down which the men climbed into the boats were found to be slippery and frequently cut the hands. The rope nets stretched easily and occasionally fouled the propellers of the boats.\n\nThe Navy retained control of all boats during debarkation. In view of the many novel features of the landing craft employed, some Army reports have advanced the theory that the command of the landing boats should devolve on the Army as soon as they leave the side of the transports.\n\nThe debarkation plan called for the formation of wave of combat-loaded landing craft around the three easterly transports, the Henry T. Allen, the George Clymer and the Susan B. Anthony. Once assembled,\n\n__________\n\n32 In Morocco the landing were effected mainly by the following type:\n\nLCP (L). Landing Craft Personnel (Large). Displacement: 12,500 lbs. Dimensions: 36 ft. by 10 ft. 6 in. Draft: 3 ft. Capacity: 30 to 36 men or 6,700 to 8,100 lbs. cargo. Speed: 10 m.p.h. Endurance: 200 miles. Armament: two .30-caliber machine guns.\n\nLCP (R). Landing Craft Personnel (with ramp). Specifications same as above except for 2 inches additional beam and 42-inch ramp forward.\n\nLCS (L). Landing Craft Support (Large). Displacement: 25 long tons. Dimensions: 46 ft. 11 in. by 12 ft. Draft 3 ft. forward, 4 ft. aft. Capacity: Crew only, 1 officer and 11 enlisted men. Speed: 11.4 m.p.h. Endurance 70 miles. Armament: one 2-pdr.; twin .50 âcaliber MG; one 4â smoke mortar; 1 smoke apparatus. Armor: 6-, 9-, and 14-mm. non-magnetic. Propulsion: two 165-hp. Diesel engines.\n\nLCS (S). Landing Craft Support (Small). Displacement: 20,000 lbs. Dimensions: 36 ft. 6 in. by 10 ft. 9 in. Draft: 3 ft. Capacity: 3 or 4 in addition to crew of 6. Speed 16 m.p.h. Endurance: 60 miles at full speed. Armament: two .50-caliber and three .30-caliber MG. Armor: Â½ in.\n\nthe boats of the first wave were to form a controlled V behind each of three escort vesselsstationed at initial control points 1,000 yards from the transport area, the Osprey for the Anthony group, the Eberle for the Clymer group and the Raven for the Allen group. From these initial control points the groups were to proceed to final control points at designated lines of departure distant 10,500, 9,700 and 11,6000 yards respectively from the initial control points and approximately 5,000 yards from the shore. By H minus 25 the V headed by the Osprey was due on the northern line of departure and at H minus 20 the Eberle and her V on the enter and the Raven and her V on the southern line of departure. The run from the lines of departure to the beaches was to be made under the cover of Fire Support and the landing craft support boats.[33]\n\nThe succeeding waves were to follow at 10-minute intervals, each keeping the preceding waves in sight and exercising care not to âpile up.â This schedule, had it been maintained, would have landed the first wave at H-hour and the seventh wave at H plus 1 hour. The disembarkation operations, however, were attended with considerable delay and confusion owing to the darkness. As a result the first waves did not land until 0515, one hour and a half late.\n\nThe most southerly of the beaches chosen for the landings was clear of the lagoon. Here aerial reconnaissance had disclosed what seemed to be a concrete pill box. When this proved to be a tomb, that landing was countermanded. About one-half mile to the north another beach had been chosen. These two landings were accordingly consolidated. The main attack, however, was to be delivered immediately south of the Sebou River. Here a causeway leads from a bathing resort across the lagoon to Mehdia. Two landings were also to be made north of the river with the object of occupying two heights, one below the bend of the river and one at the bend. The two last-named landings were also consolidated at the last minute. These eliminations reduced the area to be attacked to three beaches, one 3 miles below the mouth of the Sebou River, one some 4 miles to the north of the river, and one close to the southern river jetty. The first two landings were practically unopposed so that the central attack at the river mouth is the only one we need consider. Here some of the sharpest fighting of the campaign occurred.\n\nAlthough the 10-minute schedule could not be maintained, 7 waves were successfully landed before the shore batteries compelled the retirement\n\n__________\n\n33 See diagram. This plan being typical, those for the other landings will be omitted.\n\n38\n\nof the transports to a position out of range. Eighteen boats were usually employed on each of the 7 waves, the total number of boats available on the transports being 162.\n\nThe action began at 0523 when a searchlight was observed near the Kasba,[34] followed by small arms fire. Mindful of the instructions not to precipitate a conflict with the French if it could possibly be avoided, the commander of the Task Force directed the Roe to ignore the fire. At approximately 0605 the Eberle reported that a shore battery had fired one salvo at the landing boats. The Eberle was thereupon ordered to return the fire. The searchlight was promptly extinguished. At 0607 the Savannah catapulted four planes, two for spotting and two for antisubmarine patrol. Two Texas planes were also put in the air. At 0629 enemy shore batteries opened fire on the Roe, the first salvo landing about 500 yards on the port bow. The row returned the fire, at a range of about 5,000 yards. Three more salvos were fired by the shore batteries, after which they ceased for about 10 minutes, then resumed firing, the salvos coming closer to the Roe, which immediately reversed course.\n\nAt approximately 0630, the Texas broadcast in French the first American Army communique in North Africa, consisting of two proclamations by General Eisenhower. The first was addressed to the French authorities in North Africa. The English translation is as follows:\n\n__________\n\n34 This name, although applicable only to the walled native quarter, strictly speaking, is used throughout the reports to designate the fortification of Mehdia.\n\n39\n\nâ âBy night, turn on a searchlight and direct it vertically toward the sky. I repeat, by night, turn on a searchlight and direct it vertically towards the sky.\n\nâ â Moreover, for reasons of military security, we are obliged to give you the following orders. Any refusal to follow them will be interpreted as proof of hostile intention on your part. Here are the orders:\n\nâ â âTo all naval and merchant marine units: First, stay where you are. Secondly, make no attempt to scuttle your vessels.\n\nâ â âTo Coast Guard units: Withdraw from the neighborhood of your cannon and your stations.\n\nâ â âTo Aviation Units: Do not take off. All airplanes mist remain in their usual places.\n\nâ â âGeneral Orders: In general you must obey all orders given to you by my officers.â\n\nâ âWe come, I repeat, as friends, not as enemies. We shall not be the first to fire. Follow exactly the orders which I have just given you. Thus you will avoid any possibility of a conflict, which could only be useful to our enemies. We summon you as comrades to the common fight against the invaders of France. The war has entered the phase of liberation.â â\n\nThe second proclamation was addressed to the people of North Africa. The English translation is as follows:\n\nâThe President of the United States has asked me as commanding officer of the American Expeditionary Forces to convey to all the people in Morocco and in North Africa the following message:\n\nâ âNo nation is more closely bound by historic ties and deep affection to the people of France and their friends than the United States of America.\n\nâ âAmericans are striving not only for their own safe future, but also for the restoration of the ideals, the liberties, and the democracy of all those who have lived under the Tricolor.\n\nâ âWe come among you to save you from conquerors who would remove forever your rights of self-government, your religious freedom, and your rights to live your own lives in peace.\n\nâ âWe come among you solely to destroy your enemies and not to harm you.\n\nâ âWe come among you with the assurance that we will leave just as soon as the menace of Germany and Italy is removed from you.\n\nâ âI am appealing to your sense of realism, self-interest and ideals. Do not obstruct this great purpose.\n\nâ âHelp us and the day of a world of peace will be hastened.â ââ\n\nIn spite of these attempts to explain our intentions to the French people of Morocco, French resistance continued. At 0652 the Savannah and the Roe were attacked by two French DeWoitine fighters. Enemy shell splashes from shore batteries began falling within 150 yards of the Savannah. The Roe was straddled by three salvos, and thereupon increased speed to 30 knots and commenced zigzagging. The nearest salvo\n\n40\n\nlanded about 50 yards astern. At 0710 orders were accordingly given the northern attack group for a general offensive.\n\nAt 0720 two enemy planes strafed the landing boats. The Kearny, Ericsson, and Osprey opened fire on them immediately. Aerial fighting rapidly increased in intensity. At 0730 the Savannah reported that 10 French fighter planes were in the air. The commander of the Task Group thereupon requested air support and by 0747 at least 20 F4Fâs had arrived in the area from the carriers.\n\nBy 0950 a beachhead had been established south of the river mouth. Progress from then on was arduous. The garrison of the Kasba, which consisted largely of the Foreign Legion, was contesting every inch of ground. By noon, however, the Army had advanced as far as the lighthouse, having crossed the causeway over the lagoon on the run. The small number of casualties suffered in that charge was due to the failure of the French to cover that approach. This may have been due to an inability to depress the guns sufficiently.\n\nIn the meantime the Dallas had received orders to attempt to run past the batteries at the river mouth, if not fired on, and at 1140 proceeded cautiously toward the jetties. No firing had been observed from the Kasba for several hours. The French batteries had been under fire from the Savannah intermittently ever since 0755. As the Dallas approached the mouth of the river the Kasba resumed firing. The Dallas thereupon turned and headed out. A second attempt at 1215 was equally unsuccessful. The Savannah continued to bombard both fixed defenses and mobile batteries until 1621, expending 892 rounds of 6-inch and 236 rounds of 5-inch ammunition, by which time the enemy batteries were definitely silenced.\n\nAt 1343 the Texas opened fire on ammunition dumps near Port Lyautey. Fifty-nine rounds of 14-inch bombardment ammunition were expended, apparently with only slight effect.\n\nAntisubmarine patrols reported no submarine activity. At sundown the Texas, Savannah, and a group of destroyers took up screening positions. No news had been received from the Army on shore although, as was subsequently learned, a detachment of about the Army on shore had succeeded in getting a foothold in the old Arab Kasba late in the afternoon.\n\nOn 9 November weather conditions were: wind northeast, strength 5-8 knots, partly cloudy, sea smooth, medium swell from the northwest. D plus 1 day was to witness a vigorous French counterattack. It began\n\n41\n\nwith the capture of the small detachment which had penetrated the Kasba.\n\nAt approximately 0750 plane spotters reported enemy tanks on the road coming from Rabat. The Savannah opened fire, putting three of the tanks out of action. The remainder thereupon retreated. The Savannah continued firing, causing the tanks to disperse. In the meantime, spotting planes reported that they were bombing these tanks with excellent results. At 1027 the Savannah ceased "
