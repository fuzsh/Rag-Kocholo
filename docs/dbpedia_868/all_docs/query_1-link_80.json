Nearly ten years later, the Angola wreck retained its powerful place in the American mind. When a train careened oﬀ a bridge in Ashtabula, Ohio, in 1876, the engineer of the Paciﬁc Express was said to have summoned up the previous disaster as the only way to understand the new incident. Thrown out of the window of his locomotive, the Columbia, as it tumbled into the Ashtabula River, the engineer was reported by his fellow trainmen to have muttered three words as he was pulled from a snow bank in a badly injured state: “Another Angola Horror.”1 That might have happened. Then again, perhaps those words were a dramatic twist inserted by a newspaper reporter or editor in 1876. The newspaper industry—like journalism itself—was still taking shape in the era of the Angola wreck and developing into the form we know today. Raw, direct-fromthe-scene coverage of news, and especially of tragedy, was prized enough that editors might take liberties with sequences of events, with the precise wording of quotations, with death tolls, so as to deliver to readers that unforgettable ﬁrst-person experience. The dispatches and illustrations from Angola and\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

Some audiences would learn of the wreck right away. Others would take weeks to hear of it. Mistakes would be made in the reporting of the wreck, and corrected—or not. In all cases, the brutality of Angola would be laid bare before the eyes of thousands of people, in gritty news accounts and illustrations. “Slaughter,” the headlines would read. “Horror,” they called it. One popular magazine with a national circulation ran a sketch of the dead victims of Angola, charred, mostly legless and armless, in a large-size picture on its front page. That was one important reason the memory of Angola haunted the nation a decade later. The day’s newspapers, and its oft-sensationalistic journalists, played a signiﬁcant role in turning the scenes at Angola into indelible images and phrases. Extensive coverage was devoted to the wreck’s grisliest details. Lengthy stories ﬁlled local newspapers and magazines from coast to coast for weeks in December 1867 and January 1868, and illustrations of scenes of the wreck—sparing no detail—appeared in such widely read national publications as Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper and Harper’s and Kelley’s magazines. The wreck was described in newspapers in cities as far away as London. “There have been as many persons killed in a Railway Accident before,” the Times of London observed shortly after the disaster, “but seldom have so many ghastly and appalling incidents been crowded into a catastrophe of the kind as at Angola.”2 But newspapers could not manufacture the level of interest that Angola commanded. The timing of the wreck at Big Sister Creek, not far from Lake Erie, caught many Americans at a moment in which they were especially attuned to disaster, and keenly aware of the fragility of life. Angola happened just two and a half years after the end of the Civil War—a time in which people were readjusting to peacetime and civilian life, imagining themselves once again secure. Major railroad accidents of the postwar period shattered this uncertain, nascent sense of security. The Angola wreck showed that the threat of unexpected, large-scale slaughter was powerful, pervasive, and perhaps unmanageable. The fact that so many of the victims’ corpses could not be identiﬁed—nineteen, according to the railroad, although the actual number was likely higher—added an ugly twist to this sense of vulnerability, and surely reawakened for many painful memories of the decimation of war. Two years after the conclusion of the Civil War, it was hardly as if Americans needed the reminder. The war, lasting from 1861 to 1865, had taken the lives of some 750,000 soldiers—or about one in ten white men of military age in 1860.3 The war came as a tidal crest of death in a century brimming with it. Infant mortality was high, many children died of illnesses and injuries, old people died of\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

To read a newspaper from the mid-nineteenth century is to be plunged into a world where sudden death was commonplace. Scalding, scarlet fever, horse kicks, childbirth, buggy accidents, seizures, falls, drowning, smallpox—notices of such deaths cluster thickly in the pages of newspapers, and many more were so routine as to go unmentioned. Set into this culture rife with mortality, the anticipation of—and the witnessing to—horriﬁc railroad wrecks gave Americans in the late 1860s another reason to feel less than safe. This sense of insecurity was magniﬁed by the fact that rail travel was becoming increasingly common for men and women across the country. Rail lines had been in operation for more than thirty years by the time of the Angola disaster. People from all over the country had traveled on railroads and become used to the experience. Railroads had reached into many of the settled areas of the country: by 1860, the nation’s 30,626 miles of track had pushed into thirty-one states and had extended almost as far as the edge of the westward frontier.4 A glimpse at the number and variety of Angola’s victims bears this fact out: adding the injured to the killed, the disaster affected 100 or more individuals, hailing from thirteen states and two countries, and representing a wide variety of social classes and professions—from bank presidents and lawyers, to shopkeepers and clerks, to housewives and the unemployed. It was a time in which passenger trains had become “culturally and psychically assimilated,” as historian Wolfgang Schivelbusch has put it, by most of the public.5 As for that train-riding public, it now included many women, children, and elderly people, in addition to the groups of youthful male travelers who had predominantly used the lines before the Civil War. Railroad accidents, when they occurred, now increasingly struck at populations Victorian-era society considered the most vulnerable. Increased mobility meant increased exposure to injury and death on the part of women, children, and elderly citizens who, whether at home or on the road, were supposed to be protected by somebody: if not a male family member, then an institution, a community, or a railroad company. A wreck in which a baby or virginal young woman was injured or killed was more than a shame; it was a breach of social trust. That happened at Angola, and many of those people who witnessed it— rescuers, other passengers, onlookers—were never the same afterward. These accidents not only hurt vulnerable classes of people, but did so in ways that were unseemly by being thoroughly public. To die or be badly injured in a railway wreck in the post–Civil War period was to have your name and identity exposed in the nation’s press—not once, but over and over again. People read of the corpses at Angola and learned that the clothes—indeed,\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

For women, especially, this was a sensation of exposure and violation that was frightening and new. The death of a young woman in a railroad accident—away from home, perhaps alone, at times in gruesome circumstances that often left the remains diﬃcult to recognize—was about as far as it was possible to get from the sort of “good death” in the conﬁnes of the household that was valued in the decades both before and right after the Civil War. For women and children this public nature of death on the rails was a shocking new reality, and a troubling sign of what modernity might mean for them. “A torn glove there!” ran one poem, written after the crash, about a maidenly young woman supposedly killed in the Angola accident. “In it still lingers, the shape of the ﬁngers; / That some one has pressed, may be, and caressed, / So slender and fair.”6 Daniel Chadeayne, whose wife and daughters were on the train that wrecked at Angola, wrote grimly from the scene of the accident to friends in Titusville, Pennsylvania, that he was particularly thankful that his female relations had “escaped so well out of such a general slaughter.”7 The Angola Horror also commanded enormous public attention because the wreck spoke directly to the ways in which Americans of the period viewed the railroads. Since the 1830s, men and women across the country had been dazzled by the success and expansion of the nation’s network of railways. At the same time, there was a realization that the railroads meant some aspect of danger, along with the mobility, opportunity, and excitement that the rail lines surely provided. As trains became more useful they ceased to be the light, slow-moving, insubstantial carriages that they had been in the early days of railroading in the country—a time in which a typical journey might be a pleasure excursion lasting only a few miles. Passengers were now traveling faster, over hundreds of miles of track, and in bigger groups on larger cars pulled by more massive locomotives. By the middle of the century, the reach and power of these new sorts of railroads aﬀected people beyond those who were riding as passengers. Railroads were shaping the communities, small and large, that they passed through along their routes. Many of these ripple eﬀects were positive; but there were negative ones, as well. There was, for instance, a dawning realization that the railroads could be vectors that allowed for the faster spread of contagious illness and disease, such as yellow fever, among other social ills.8 Still, most of the risk of the railroads fell to those riding the trains. The degree to which railroad travel had become more convenient and popular coincided with the extent to which, under hazardous conditions or with poor operation, these faster and heavier trains could be vehicles for brutal accidents. In the late 1860s, the realization of that fact was growing, and this created a potent combination of allure and fear where the ﬂedgling railroads were concerned. When railway accidents happened, they “reawaken[ed] the memory of the\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

Much had changed about the railroads, over the years. But some important factors had not. Decades after those ﬁrst historic, short-duration rides for passengers, many railroad trips still entailed anxiety-provoking sensations and experiences. And those anxieties were well founded. Wax candles and kerosene lamps for illumination, coal- and wood-burning stoves for heating cars, unreliable signaling mechanisms, ﬂawed and unpredictable iron rails and switches, outdated link-and-pin couplers—all of these were in everyday use on railroads in the United States in the 1860s, and most would remain so for years. George Westinghouse Jr., a young man of twenty-one living in Schenectady, New York, in 1867, had not yet invented the air brake that would revolutionize the production of locomotives and cars by making them capable of safe and eﬃcient stops controlled from the front of the train. Rudimentary hand brakes, operated by brakemen laboring in diﬃcult conditions on the tops and end platforms of cars, still were uniformly used. There was more. Trainmen typically had to meet no physical or intellectual criteria for employment. There were generally no tests, not even for hearing or the ability to discern one color from another (two ﬁtness tests that would be phased in for the ﬁrst time on American railroads in the 1870s and 1880s).10 Bridges on the railway routes, often poorly built and infrequently maintained, were so nerve-wracking in some cases that they were, in the words of Charles Dickens, “most agreeable when passed.”11 Passenger cars had little in the way of shock absorbers, and jolted and rattled along the rails so jarringly that doctors warned passengers about the damage they might do themselves with “railway spine.” As for car couplers, Ezra Miller had patented an automatic device in 1863 to replace the primitive link-and-pin system in use at the time, but many railroads did not take it up until the 1870s. Even then, many railroads opted for their own coupling systems, which led to an unsafe situation lasting for decades in which no coupler uniformity existed, meaning that connections between cars could be too loose, too tight, or otherwise faulty and unreliable.12 As a result, the death toll for employees as well as passengers was high. “All through my employment as a switchman,” wrote one railroader who worked coupling trains in this period, “[my sister] kept one clean sheet for the express purpose of wrapping up my mangled remains.”13 In addition to this risky hodgepodge of faulty technology and poor regulation, American trains operated under a fractured system of local times, without the structure and reliability of a national railroad standard time. Trains\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\n6 ]\n\nPROLOGUE\n\nCopyright © 2013.

This led to problems for people trying to track trains or plan their own travel. And because these discrepancies occurred over routes on which trains often still shared singletrack lines and limited turnouts and sidings, miscommunications and misunderstandings about the timing of arrivals and departures could lead to missed connections or much worse—including head-on collisions, called “meets,” as well as the deadly telescoping of trains by other trains. Reading about the events at Angola and seeing artists’ renderings of the scenes in Big Sister Creek both inspired and validated the public’s fears about how wrecks on the roads could play out for unsuspecting men, women, and children. Their anxieties ranged from the still-felt general uneasiness instilled by four years of war to the speciﬁc concern for the well-being of family members who boarded trains for business trips or family visits. In the popular art and literature of the period, their nervous anticipations were distilled, often to stunning eﬀect. One such illustration, “The Horrors of Travel,” appeared in Harper’s Weekly magazine in September 1865, two years before the wreck at Angola.

This illustration, called “The Horrors of Travel,” appeared in Harper’s Weekly magazine just months after the end of the Civil War. It depicted a specter-like figure of Death, riding a locomotive, chasing down innocent men and women. From Harper’s Weekly, September 23, 1865.\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

Accompanying this image in Harper’s, an editorial summed up the national mood. “During the present year Death appears to have set his mark upon the traveler,” it stated. “There has come to be a general feeling of insecurity and distrust, and every man or woman who steps out of a railway car or steamboat at the termination of their journey unhurt does so with a feeling of sensible relief.”15 By the 1870s, Walt Whitman would link the thrill and the nerve-wracking power of railroads together in poetry, writing of the locomotive’s “black cylindric body, golden brass and silvery steel” but also the “dense and murky clouds out-belching from thy smoke-stack.”16 Whitman made it clear that the locomotive had irrevocably changed the American landscape, in ways that were still being seen, felt, and measured. In this vein, in 1866, Louisa May Alcott turned the devastation of a train wreck into a plot device in Behind a Mask, a novella of deception and mistaken identity. In Alcott’s story, the protagonist, Jean Muir, receives news that a man important to her has been killed in a railroad smash-up. “The poor young gentleman is so wet, and crushed, and torn, no one would know him,” she is informed, “except for the uniform, and the white hand with the ring on it.”17 In an echo of the ﬁction, words such as these spoken by a messenger to Muir would appear in newspapers across the country after Angola, as readers absorbed bulletins from Buﬀalo and Big Sister Creek in which descriptions of artifacts were published in an eﬀort to match victims with their identities. The Buﬀalo Post of December 23, 1867, listed dozens of such items, from the lofty to the mundane, found among the ashes and wreckage in the creek bed after the disaster. Examples included a pair of silver ice-skates, a small gold ladies’ watch “without any inscription,” the metal end-cap of a surveyor’s staﬀ that had been carried aboard the train by a young engineer from Buﬀalo, and a bunch of keys, melted to a lump, but yet intact enough to see that “several of the keys [were] numbered 24.”18 Each of the items in the newspaper listings was a portrait of a life stopped abruptly. Each struck chords in the hearts of men and women who read such accounts with emotions of concern and fear, looking for answers. And so, for decades after 1867, Angola served as a watchword that conveyed to men and women the danger and unpredictability that came with the purchase of every train ticket.\n\nj BY THE CLOSE of the nineteenth century, the Angola derailment ranked\n\nwith a small handful of others—Ashtabula (1876), Camp Hill (1856), Chatsworth\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

Robert C. Reed, a railroad disaster historian of the mid-twentieth century, ranked Angola and Ashtabula as the two “most notorious railroad disasters” in the country’s history.19 Robert B. Shaw, another historian of train wrecks in America, wondered at the peculiar hold Angola exerted over the nation’s collective consciousness. “For some reasons not entirely clear,” Shaw wrote, “this accident secured a particularly strong hold upon the public imagination of that generation.”20 This was true despite the fact that Angola, deadly as it was, had claimed fewer total victims than other major wrecks.21 The generation of Americans that witnessed the Horror—embarking on the work of Reconstruction; only dimly anticipating the struggles between capital and labor and between industrial growth and regulation that would transpire in and through the Gilded Age and Progressive Era—bequeathed the facts of Angola, but not the vibrancy of its memory. The story faded in the late nineteenth century and ﬁrst decades of the twentieth. While the journal and newspaper accounts endured, the oral history of the wreck fell out of currency, not just in the nation but in the region of western New York where the wreck had happened. Now, in some ways, the incident at Big Sister Creek feels remote from our modern world. Technology, a fact of modern life with which people in the nineteenth century were just becoming acquainted, surrounds us in our daily lives in the twenty-ﬁrst. Details of the story might make it seem antique: the Victorian-era clothes the women wore, the car stoves at which the children warmed their hands, the jobs the men, just getting over the trauma of the Civil War, were looking forward to ﬁlling. A survey of these features could suggest a period drama, glimpsed vaguely through one of the tiny peephole windows that served as viewing stations on early trains. These elements can combine to create a sense that the narrative of Angola is a story of time gone by. But that conclusion deserves reconsideration. We know that, in witnessing the Angola Horror, men and women in the nineteenth century found themselves moved, in profound and telling ways. The force of the experience of Angola—whether that of a rescuer looking for survivors on the evening of the wreck or a reader of newspapers in a distant city—was strong, and, as noted earlier, that strength was not by any means the simple result of sensational journalism. People of the 1860s knew what fear and powerlessness felt like, and Angola became for them a talisman of the uneasy tension they lived with. We may be more used to the experience of high-speed transportation than the men and women aboard the New York Express, but we know some of their uneasiness. We know what it feels like to ponder the meaning of an individual\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

In this way, the heated, sometimes sensationalistic journalists of the Angola period did us more of a favor than we might have imagined. They brought characters to life—real people that we can relate to, and empathize with, today. Reading the news accounts of the wreck and studying the illustrations that appeared on full pages in the magazines that circulated around the country, we meet the men and women that were swept up in the events of December 18, 1867. Among the passengers, heroes, victims, and onlookers were Dr. Romaine J. Curtiss, the brilliant and troubled military surgeon, returned too soon to scenes of carnage and death; conductor Benjamin F. Sherman, an experienced railroader who did his best to fulﬁll his duties in dire circumstances; the young Westinghouse, pondering the mysteries inherent in stopping thousands of pounds of racing metal on a thin iron track; bright men like Elam Porter and Joseph Stocking Lewis, college graduates embarking on promising careers; average women like Christiana Gates Lang and Emma Hurlburt Fisher, who would have remained anonymous all their lives, perhaps, had they not been caught up in this terrible event. Angola is their story. By considering ﬁrstperson perspectives on the events of 1867, we are given the chance to engage with the worries, fears, hopes, and ambitions that average Americans felt and thought about so soon after the nation’s epic war. The two hundred or so passengers riding the train that cold December day did not consider themselves to be representative—yet the life stories that brought them to that point oﬀer striking insights into the time and place in which they lived. By looking at the Angola Horror, unquestionably a pivotal moment in American railroad history, from the perspectives of these people, we can explore the important legacies of this wreck from the standpoint of the history of the post–Civil War period. Angola also speaks to us directly as a story of average people caught up in a terriﬁc and unstoppable event. It oﬀers insight into what it is like for everyday people to become victims of the technologies with which they live— technologies they may not fully understand or know how to control. And this narrative addresses how the media both expresses and creates our experience, be it ﬁrsthand or as an observer at a distance. Further, the story of the Angola Horror calls attention to how and what individuals and communities remember and memorialize, and what they come to forget. For some 140 years, the victims of the Angola wreck never received a monument or memorial. That fact alone, set alongside the importance of the wreck in its own time, is worth thinking about.\n\nj\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\n10 ]\n\nPROLOGUE\n\n“ANOTHER ANGOLA,” the engineer at Ashtabula had mourned.

As it swayed forward, rumbling at speeds approaching thirty miles an hour over the ice-crusted tracks toward the city more than twenty miles away, the heads of its two hundred passengers were likely ﬁlled with memories of what they had left behind, and visions of what they were journeying toward. Some surely dreamed of love. Some, of business. Some perhaps let their thoughts stray to the holiday season, Christmas and New Year’s, that lay just a week in the future. Many of them were traveling long distances—the railroads let them do that now, even women and children, in ways that hadn’t been possible a generation or two before. They were pioneers, hesitant and ambivalent ones in some ways, but pioneers nonetheless. One of them wished he could leave his dreams behind. Sitting in his upholstered seat in the second-to-last car of the train, Josiah P. Hayward no doubt felt apprehensive, as did other passengers around him. Unlike those passengers, however, some of whom might still be relatively new to the experience of train journeying, Hayward was used to railroad travel; it was part of his job. But he was more tense than usual this weekday afternoon— and, as a result, he had taken a few unaccustomed precautions. Hayward’s fears had originated in a nightmare he had suﬀered six months earlier. The twenty-four-year-old Pennsylvanian, who worked as a station agent\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

As he slept, his mind ﬁlled with fearsome images.1 In his dream, Hayward saw himself standing in an unfamiliar place—a desert. Just as he began to examine his surroundings, Hayward heard a tremendous noise behind him: a “terriﬁc crash,” as if the gates of hell themselves had been unlocked. He turned to look, and found himself confronted with a piercingly bright light, so strong that it seemed “to reach to the very heavens.”2 What Hayward heard next was worse: screams. Dozens of them, mounting to the skies, pleading for relief—a wave of sound that was heartbreaking in its hopelessness. Hayward felt terriﬁed; he then looked around and saw, to his surprise, a man standing nearby who was dressed as a monk. “Where do the screams come from?” Hayward, in his dream, heard himself ask. “From Hell,” the monk answered. “What does it mean?” he persisted. “It means,” the monk responded, “you must instantly die.”3 Struggling awake, Hayward found himself bartering with the dreammonk in his state of semiconsciousness. More time, he begged. The monk considered, then told him he might have six months more before the dream would come to pass. At that moment, Hayward was shaken awake by Anna, who told him he had been thrashing wildly in his sleep. The death dream made a strong impression on both husband and wife.4 Hayward found himself returning to the episode often in conversation with friends and family, not just for days or weeks, but for months afterward. It would later become a tidbit seized upon by the day’s sensation-seeking journalists. It wasn’t like Josiah Hayward to feel so uncertain. He was the son of a farming family in the small community of North East, Pennsylvania, which had done well on the land; the Haywards had owned $3,200 in real estate and property by the Civil War. Young Josiah had been raised in an environment of practicality and common sense. As an employee of the Buﬀalo and Erie Railroad, he had been placed in a position of trust and responsibility. After the Civil War ended, Hayward had chosen the railroads for a career because he had seen their potential. Thousands of young men his age had done the same thing, looking to the railroads as a means to achieve success and status—far more attractive than the family farm for a good livelihood. The post–Civil War period had, in fact, been something of a soot-scented gold rush; by 1870, more American men would be working for the country’s railroads than in any other occupation.5 By 1900, railroads and industries supporting their operation, from locomotive manufacturers to producers of\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\nTROUBLED SLEEP\n\n[ 13\n\nCopyright © 2013.

A responsible employee, Hayward tried to shake the eﬀects of his vision, sticking to his daily routine and focusing on his job. When early on a mid-December afternoon it became clear that he would need to take a quick trip to Buﬀalo by train, he boarded the chuﬃng cars that stood waiting in the State Line station. But Hayward did not climb aboard the Buﬀalo and Erie’s New York Express without lingering trepidation. Perhaps in grim irony, perhaps in search of a good-luck token with which to counteract any bad fortune that awaited him—or perhaps just thinking of Anna, and the future—Hayward made a brief stop before mounting the iron steps to the second-last of the train’s passenger coaches. At the station window, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a few coins—ﬁfty cents’ worth. He plunked them down on the counter and took a small slip of paper from the agent in return. When he climbed into the car, Hayward had a $3,000 insurance policy ticket tucked inside his coat. It was the biggest one he could buy. HAYWARD’S JITTERS may have had as much to do with the time of year as with his nightmare. For winter, as railroad travelers in the 1860s liked to joke, was widely known to be “smash-up season.” Whether it was the icy and hazardous conditions, the dim light and shorter days, or the increased traﬃc due to the holiday season, no one knew for sure, but many travelers felt that more severe wrecks happened on the rails in the cold-weather months than at other times of year. Their own observations attested to the fact, which seemed to be borne out by the tallies of accidents and deaths that were reported in the pages of many newspapers and periodicals. It wasn’t just inexperienced passengers who held this opinion; educated types, including newspaper and magazine editors, shared this view. Railroads were considered newsy items to the era’s editors and reporters all year round, of course, but in the wintertime, such accounts seemed to crowd especially thickly onto the news pages in local papers. “The suicide, ﬁre, railroad and steamboat accident term is upon us, and we shall be glad when it subsides,” the Boston Herald stated in an editorial published in December 1867. “We truly are having a sup of horrors that taxes not only the full-face type of newspaper oﬃces, but strains also to its utmost tension the nervous systems of the strongest-hearted among us.”7 There was a lot of railroad track on which to ﬁx these concerns. By 1840, the nation had laid 3,000 miles of track, far more than the 1,818 miles in\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\n14 ]\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\noperation in Europe. Between 1850 and 1860, track mileage across the country had shot up at a rate four times that of the previous decade.8 Much of it lay in places in the country, like Pennsylvania and New York, where freezing weather, snow, and ice were factors for a good portion of the year. And so, in this same unforgiving winter of 1867–68, none other than Scientiﬁc American magazine called attention to “the fact noticed by journalists and observing newspaper readers, that certain months of the year are particularly proliﬁc of railroad casualties.”9 The magazine continued:\n\nCopyright © 2013. Cornell University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nThe periodic return of this smash-up season . . . is even predicted by enterprising journalists, and it must, so they aﬃrm, like the dog days, run through a certain course before it ﬁnally dies out. If, for causes beyond our ken, certain months of the year are peculiarly favored in this respect, it is evident that such a season is now upon us, for the record of the past few months shows a long list of railway casualties of all kinds and of all degrees of horror.10 Old superstitions, combined with questionable inductive reasoning, may have led some people to connect railroad crashes with a particular season. If so, that was hardly surprising, given that railroads had long been linked with superstitious beliefs and practices in the United States—from the way passengers and trainmen avoided trains bearing the number 13, to the ghost stories connected with dangerous places along the rails, to the way crew members marked the trackside graves of railroaders killed in the line of duty (the symbol of a broken wheel was often used to signify a trainman’s place of burial). Passengers may not always have voiced these ideas explicitly, but the way they spoke of and acted around the railroads, as well as the way they incorporated the imagery and culture of trains into their lives, revealed the uneasy mixture of their feelings. By 1867, many American men and women had ridden on trains. They had had enough contact with the railroads that they were beginning to feel capable of using them for their own various purposes, from work to visiting relations to traveling to school. But that did not mean that these men and women felt comfortable and at ease about the railroads on which they rode. To the contrary, Victorian railroads and their machines, which did not seem to obey the laws of nature in certain ways, were viewed by many men and women of the period as foreign, threatening—even slightly otherworldly.11 The public response to them— part fascination and embrace, part fear and rejection—found expression in such manners of thinking as the “smash-up season.” It found expression, at times, in black humor.\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\nTROUBLED SLEEP\n\n[ 15\n\nThis may explain why the Victorians frequently gave their locomotives colorful names, often borrowing them from mythology, literature, warfare, or the animal kingdom, or using them to sum up aims and ambitions.12 One midwestern railroad hopefully dubbed an early locomotive the “Pioneer.” The Buﬀalo and Erie Railroad and its predecessor line, the Buﬀalo & State Line, oﬀered riders the chance to settle in for journeys behind locomotives called Vixen, Vampire, Hecla, and Vulcan; newspapers of the day did not name the locomotive pulling the New York Express. (Later on in the decade, some railroad company executives, perhaps realizing more fully the power of public relations, began naming locomotives more sedately, with modest titles like the Charles H. Lee and the Dean Richmond.)13 Of course, if naming the beast didn’t work as a way of taming it, then there was always humor to fall back on. And so, in Mark Twain’s The Innocents Abroad, published in 1869, the author had his narrator refer to railway accidents in an oﬀhanded way that was nonetheless carefully pitched to the pressing concerns of the age. “No, they have no railroad accidents to speak of in France,” the narrator states in Twain’s novel. “But why? Because when one occurs, somebody has to hang for it!”14\n\nj\n\nCopyright © 2013. Cornell University Press.

Outside, temperatures across upstate New York and in northwestern Pennsylvania were frigid, and hadn’t risen above the freezing mark in nearly two weeks.15 In the city of Buﬀalo, much to the satisfaction of young men and women, sleighing had begun a little over a week earlier, on December 10, with the arrival of steady, thick snow. “Sleighing begins,” noted William Ives, the librarian for the city’s Young Men’s Association, in his weather journal.16 Area newspapers marveled that the sudden cold snap extended deep into the middle of the United States. “Good sleighing in Washington and Louisville, three hundred miles south of this latitude,” noted one, the Hamilton (Ont.) Evening Times.17 It had begun to feel like winter, and like Christmas. On board the four passenger coaches of the eastbound New York Express that Wednesday afternoon rode many men, women, and children who were on their way to visit family members and friends for the holidays. This in itself was a sign of the times: a generation or two before, the train might not have been so full of young women traveling toward reunions with family, of babies, of older people making journeys to visit grown children, of newlyweds. Railroads had made such trips—many of them all-day aﬀairs—possible, and aﬀordable, and, for the most part, safe. The express train as a result was\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

Rockefeller—while others were stuﬀed into the valises clutched by passengers. There was little room to move about, as each car contained a full complement of ﬁfty or so people; travelers crammed their belongings beneath their seats, or shoved them into overhead racks, hoping for the best. The Christmas holiday always had meaning, of course, but this year was special. Though the war between North and South had ended a little more than two years before, an undeniably wartime feeling still hung in the air, especially where holidays and family celebrations were concerned. So many men had served, and so many died: about 750,000 soldiers in all, from both sides of the conﬂict, and each of those deaths had torn a gaping hole in homes, families, and communities.19 Two years later, those wounds still ached. All over the country, people struggled to pick up the pieces of lives shattered by the war, to cope with the “debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war,” in the words of poet Walt Whitman, who voiced a realization many families knew all too well, that the slain soldiers were able to ﬁnd rest, in the soil of their early graves, long before their bereft loved ones could. “They themselves were fully at rest, they suﬀer’d not,” Whitman had written. “The living remain’d and suﬀer’d.”20 In the winter of 1867, however, that lingering sense of sorrow and loss was coupled with a new sensibility. It was one that suggested that perhaps the best and most productive way to celebrate Christmas was to do so as a uniﬁed nation, bonding together over a shared experience of hope. Godey’s Lady’s Book, in its issue that December 1867—a periodical some passengers on the New York Express may well have been reading—had argued for just this kind of transformative Christmas, a season that would bring citizens from all parts of the country together in a spirit of brotherhood and emotional unity.21 Christmas could become a moment that was more important, and perhaps more uniquely American, than even the Fourth of July. The magazine stated it this way: “To us—Americans—Christmas should be the glorious holiday of the year.”22 Despite these calls for unity and peace, the winter of 1867–1868 seemed to many to possess an odd, unsettled feeling. The nation, emerging from a bitter war that had made its citizens examine the ﬁrst principles of their democracy, was entering a new phase of its history. No one knew what that phase would look like. Bracing change was coupled with a contemplative, backward-gazing attitude beﬁtting a country that had just survived horriﬁc\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

In Christmastide editorials, newspapers including the Baltimore Sun urged readers to look not just to the future but to the past as well, as a way of understanding what the nation needed. “To the American people there is a reﬂection suggested by this festival which should admonish them of the duties they owe to each other,” an editorial in the Maryland newspaper stated. “The war . . . teaches still more eloquently the lessons of mercy and forgiveness.”23 For regular folk, this unsettled atmosphere expressed itself as a feeling that time was passing ever more quickly. Many other aspects of life—the railroads and communication through telegraphy, to take two examples—were also speeding up. As a result, time itself was proving trickier to handle. The railroads, opening up faster routes between distant points, had revealed problems with the country’s geography-based time measurement system. Under this system, individual towns and cities set their own local times without regard for their neighbors, or for travelers or businesses that communicated among various locales. The time dilemma added to the public’s feelings of dislocation and disorientation. Although an association of railroad superintendents had called for a standardized time system in the United States as early as 1849, by 1867 the development of such a system had still not happened.24 In Buﬀalo, the city’s main railroad depot erred on the safe side, oﬀering travelers three separate clocks, each showing a diﬀerent time. Two clocks provided the times used by the railroad lines serving the station; the third showed the city’s own “Buﬀalo time.”25 Helpful, perhaps—but far from perfect. Passengers on board the New York Express could hardly be blamed for keeping their own time that Wednesday afternoon, and many of them did. J. Frank Walker, the son of a prosperous Buﬀalo jeweler and watch purveyor, wore an elegant gold watch and chain on his vest.26 As if in agreement with these feelings of disturbance and displacement, the natural world in that cold-weather season seemed unsettled as well. Residents in outlying towns in the rural Southern Tier of New York reported spotting a panther near their homes and businesses several times that fall; it appeared to slink between various communities, now popping up in one, now showing its face in another. That was strange, for this area of the state, so long an unexplored wilderness, had stopped feeling like one years ago. The panther was a reminder that some element of the untamed remained. And there were other hints. The week before, on December 12, a strong easterly wind had kicked up along the Niagara River, escalating by midday to such strength that it pushed the water backward, lowering the surface of the river so that the riverbed lay exposed, confounding humans and ﬁsh alike. “Great was the consternation among the ﬁnny tribes,” one newspaper correspondent joked.27 Newspapers as far away as Philadelphia marveled over the “miraculous” occurrence, which\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\n18 ]\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\ngrounded boats and drew spectators to the scene. “In Buﬀalo Creek,” one paper reported, “all the vessels moored there were grounded, and the stream of water, in ordinary times pouring an immense volume over the rocks, one hundred and sixty-four feet high [at Niagara Falls], was reduced so low as to enable the bold adventurer to cross dry shod from the American side to Goat Island, a distance of eleven hundred feet.”28 Caused by a seiche, this event was an anomaly; it had happened one other time in the century, in 1848, and that was a springtime drying-up due to ice jams at the outlet of Lake Erie.29 The disappearance of the river in December was nearly unheard of. Even more troublingly, at 3 a.m. that Wednesday—twelve hours and ten minutes before the New York Express would pass through Angola—residents of the region were startled awake by the sensation of a small but unmistakable earthquake.30 The “distinct shock,” widely felt throughout Buﬀalo and as far away as Syracuse, passed after about “a minute and a half,” the Jamestown (N.Y.) Journal reported. But it left many residents feeling nervous and wary. Some people saw the earthquake as a sign from Providence, warning of death, judgment, heaven, or hell. “Verily, what are we coming to?” wondered the Buﬀalo Post.31 Another paper saw the temblor as a glimpse of the “awful grandeur” of an avenging God. “Very many fervently pious people supposed that the Judgment Day had actually arrived, and remained in a state of almost suspended animation for several seconds, expecting to hear ‘the last trumpet sound.’ . . . A dancing party suddenly broke up and departed for home and places to pray.”32 Ill at ease, even when the shaking stopped, people reached for their guns, their children, their spouses, and wondered.\n\nCopyright © 2013.

Angola was a through-point on this day’s schedule, not a station stop. Then there would be Buﬀalo, a little more than twenty miles beyond, with its Exchange Street depot near the city’s harbor—the station of the three clocks. Buﬀalo oﬀered the bustle of city life and an array of connections to points east: Rochester, Syracuse, Albany, New York City, the New England states. In addition to physical geography, the express train was surrounded as it moved through the winter scenery by an invisible terrain rich in American and railroading history. A year and a half before, the black-draped funeral train of Abraham Lincoln had passed along these tracks, following a thirteen-day\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

The trip included a day’s stop in Buﬀalo, where crowds turned out to view the president’s body; then, on April 27, 1865, Lincoln’s coﬃn had been loaded onto a catafalque car and transported by the Buﬀalo and Erie Railroad between Buﬀalo and Erie, Pennsylvania. The funeral train had passed through Angola at about 11:13 p.m., ten minutes behind a pilot engine that checked the track for obstructions.34 “This Pilot Engine and Funeral Train will have Exclusive Right to the Track over all other Trains upon the line,” directors of the Buﬀalo and Erie had warned the public and railway crews.35 People from the rural areas around the community of Angola had clustered near the tracks to see the body of the president make its slow journey home. During the four years before that moment, the same railroad tracks had delivered thousands of the sons of New York’s upstate regions to the front lines of combat in the Civil War, often with patriotic sendoﬀs at the area’s railway stations. “Marched down Main St to Church, where a Flag was raised on ﬁrst-Church,” wrote James Husted, a recruit who left Buﬀalo for the Union army’s Fort Runyon in northern Virginia in May 1861. “Street and buildings crowded with citizens, stores trimmed with Streamers of Red, White & Blue and Flags, marched to Depot followed by the immense concorse [sic]. Great time amongst the boys bidding their Friends goodbye which are repeated over and over again. . . . The last farewell is said and last kiss given and the Train moves slowly oﬀ leaving many a Sad Heart and moistened eye.”36 The history of the region wasn’t all grim. The city of Dunkirk, on the Buffalo and Erie’s route along Lake Erie southwest of Buﬀalo, was becoming a center of rail-related business activity. Soon the city would be home to the Brooks Locomotive Company. George Pullman, inventor of the sleeper car and founder of the Pullman Palace Car Company, had been born in nearby Brocton. The route of the express also passed through the hometowns of national leaders including William H. Seward, the current secretary of state, and Ely Parker, the Native American aide to General Ulysses S. Grant who helped the Union commander draft the documents of surrender at Appomattox. One of those on board the New York Express likely more aware of this historical backdrop to the day’s route was Benjamin F. Sherman, the train’s conductor. A bearded man with a receding hairline, thick eyebrows, and a kindly if beleaguered face, Sherman was making his routine rounds as the train headed toward the Angola station. He was in the last car of the train, talking to passengers, greeting friends, and answering questions. Just two months past his fortieth birthday, Sherman, a native of White Creek in Washington County, had made his career on the railroads of upstate New York since the early days of passenger service in 1851.

By the time the Civil War was over, Sherman was one of the best-known conductors on the road.37 When he boarded the train midway through its route earlier that afternoon in Erie, Sherman had loaded his pockets with the tools of his trade: his timetable, orders for the day’s travel for his section of the route, and a copy of the conductors’ “bible,” the slim book of rules and regulations governing his duties and responsibilities toward the train and its passengers. He also took his pocket watch, an important possession, since some of the local railroads could be single-track aﬀairs, and preventing accidents by keeping to a correct schedule was as much his job as the engineer’s. Now, Sherman worked his way through the cars of the train, talking to the people around him and keeping one eye on the ticking away of time.

Hands and faces felt grimy and soiled. Children—at least seven in the last two cars of the train alone—grew restless, then bad-tempered. The lucky ones slept; everyone else endured. About two hundred men, women, and children had boarded the express train that day. Many of these travelers had climbed into the cars at daybreak in Cleveland. Others had shivered while waiting at small local stops along the line in the cold morning air. By afternoon, they sat stolidly in the dim, watery light that ﬁlled the swaying coaches. Every now and then, those passengers sitting near the sides of the cars would crane their necks to gaze out of the frost-tinged “peephole” windows. There was not much to look at—mostly “panel, veneer, and daub,” as some travelers of the time had noted wryly. “All of the exhilarating eﬀect of buggy riding is lost in these cages,” one traveler had complained.38 And so they rode, and dreamed, and waited. In the second-last car of the train, a thirteen-year-old girl helped her mother care for her threeyear-old sister. Nearby, one of the smallest passengers in the last two cars, an infant named Minnie, snuggled in the arms of her mother, a young woman from Minnesota. In the train’s last car, a young couple from Grand Island, the Kents, no doubt sat close together, the shiny, unmarred gold bands on their left hands—if not their private glances and smiles—giving them away as the newest of newlyweds. Her ring bore two intertwined initials: “GDK to AFG.”39 In the same car, an eighteen-year-old from Rochester, Morgan Kedzie, would have looked forward to the reunion with family that waited for him at the end of a trip to visit an uncle in Iowa.40 Not far away, two attorneys—one from Boston, the other Cincinnati—surely ﬁngered the wedding bands they each carried with them in anticipation of the nuptial ceremonies that awaited them on Christmas Day. A Wisconsin newspaper editor was also on his way toward an East Coast wedding. And then there was Joseph Stocking Lewis, a passenger who likely would have been a shade cynical about all this romance aboard the New York Express. A bright and witty graduate of Williams College, at twenty-three years of age Lewis, who had spent the previous year running a tannery business in Pennsylvania, had only recently reported to his chums that his heart was still safely untethered to any young woman. This was due, joked the sandy-haired bachelor with the mischievous eyes and full lips, to his “not having as yet met with any of the ‘female persuasion’ whose attractions were strong enough to excite my breast [with] those emotions or intentions which would lead to anything ultimate.”41 But it was Christmastime; anything could happen. So perhaps even Lewis held out hope, hedging his phrase with those telling\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

He probably allowed himself to relax, in these seconds, by chatting a bit with John Vanderburg, the rear brakeman, who was pulling on his gloves and fastening his coat in preparation for heading out onto the platforms of the rear car and the second-last car. Around them, passengers dozed and shifted. As they did, something else was taking place underneath the last car of the train. For some distance, a single wheel on the train’s last truck—the framework that held the sets of wheels together—had been rolling along the tracks unevenly. To the casual observer, nothing might have been noticeable. But something in the wheel was ﬂawed; and behind it, in the axle that held together the rear wheels, a bend or curvature had formed. As the back wheels of the train moved over the rails—set four feet, ten inches apart, the Buﬀalo and Erie’s standard gauge—they did so in a way that didn’t precisely match the movements of the train’s other wheels. The rear wheels shuttled back and forth as they spun. The vibration could be measured in fractions of an inch— not enough to be felt, even, by anyone sitting in the cars above. The irregular wheel and axle had been enough to throw the truck of the last car oﬀ kilter as the train traveled the miles between Erie and Angola. Because the wheel did not roll over anything unusual at its moments of shuttle-like movement, it eventually shunted back into position. At 3:10 p.m., that changed. The wheel rolled through Angola, past the village’s station house, and over a frog, or juncture in the tracks, located about two hundred yards beyond the depot. As it passed over the frog, the ﬂaw in the wheel struck the place where the two strands of track separated. It jarred. Above, young Frank Walker’s gold watch ticked oﬀ the seconds. The Kents spoke in low tones. Babies fussed. Josiah Hayward pushed back the foul memory of his nightmare, over and over, as it stirred in the corners of his consciousness. Below them, the momentum of the wheel might have kept the circle of spinning metal on the track; it didn’t. With a jerking movement, the wheel rose and then fell oﬀ the track, thudding onto the wooden ties beneath. Passengers felt the lurch in their stomachs. There was now the thudding noise of iron wheels clattering along wooden ties. Ahead lay the Big Sister bridge, a low, brownish-gray smear against the horizon. The train moved toward it, still running at close to its thirty-mile-an-hour speed. Suddenly, in the air around them, they could hear the shriek of a whistle calling for “down brakes.” The train ﬂew out onto the bridge. For one moment, all hung in midair. The coal stoves crackled merrily, suspended for the briefest glimmer of time along with everything else in the cold December sky.\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nAngola at Dawn\n\nz W EDNESDAY , D ECEMBER 18, 1867 • 6–7 A .

All rights reserved.\n\nN ANGOLA, a rural settlement some twenty miles southwest of Buﬀalo\n\nin western New York state, people had become so accustomed to the trains by 1867 that they noticed them only when something went amiss: when a train was held up by bad weather, for instance, or running far behind schedule. Since the early 1850s, trains had been the backdrop to their lives. Even for those residents who didn’t work for the railroad or ship goods by train, the rail lines were of central importance. They had made the village what it was; they deﬁned its day-to-day existence. Every Angolan knew what it was like to halt a conversation in mid-sentence to wait for the shriek of a train to fade away. Many residents knew the movement of the Buﬀalo and Erie’s trains through the community, as well as those of other railroads, by the whistles alone; they could judge the speed of a passing train by its sound. “I am so accustomed to hear whistles,” said one Angolan employed by the railroads, “that I pay no attention to them unless I have some special business with the train.”1 That morning, as their clocks crept toward 7 a.m., there had been no reason to pay any special notice. In the village, residents were waking up within the walls of homes that had recently been framed out with native yellow pine, oak, and maple, cut down near the Big Sister ravine, hauled through the streets to Mill Street, and then shaped into boards in Henry Bundy’s Angola Steam and Water Power Mill.2 They shrugged into coats for farm chores, kindled ﬁres in the stoves in their kitchens. Angola was still mostly agricultural, though the railroad depot and the village’s commercial center were hubs of activity. In the\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013. Cornell University Press.

The hotel had recently been purchased by S. P. Imus, a former stagecoach driver for the Ohio Stage Company, who no doubt often told of how he had driven the last stagecoach passengers through the Angola area on February 22, 1852.3 Residents of Angola had chosen the area, a place along Lake Erie in the town of Evans that originally had been called “Evans Station,” because the location seemed pretty and relatively well-situated. Inland, yet close enough to Lake Erie to be out of the path of the worst of the lake’s winter storms, which tended to pass over the area, the village—which would be oﬃcially incorporated in 1873—oﬀered points of connection to the larger world beyond. As railroads were becoming increasingly common as modes of travel for average Americans, they were also tying these citizens’ hometowns—places like Angola—to an ever-broadening network of rail lines that had extended over much of the countryside by 1867. Railroads tied Angola to places both east and west—to Buﬀalo and Niagara Falls in one direction, Dunkirk, Erie, and Cleveland in another—and made its residents feel connected to the country’s past in the East, as well as with its blossoming westward future. As a sign of the urge for connectedness possessed by these men and women, lore had it that the village had chosen its name after the country in Africa—a place none of them would ever see, but one they could imagine. Angola had potential. It oﬀered, if not excitement, then capability. People in the village had learned to grab the circumstances handed them in life and make the most out of them—to take what came along and make it better. And in the Angola rail yard, two employees of the Buﬀalo and Erie Railroad were trying to do just that. J. M. Newton, station agent for the village, and James Mahar, a switchman for the railroad, were discussing a problem with the tracks that had cropped up during the night. Mahar had noticed it at dawn, when he had made his ﬁrst rounds of the day on the railroad property, a narrow strip of land between Commercial and Railroad streets in the village. A piece of rail not far from the station had snapped in two. Maybe it had been the cold; maybe the rail had just worn out. Though a process for turning pig iron into steel had been invented more than a decade before by Henry Bessemer, for most railroads in the 1860s—including the Buﬀalo and Erie—steel rails were still largely a curiosity. The new rails’ quality was uneven; they were expensive, to boot. As a result, as with many innovations involving railroads, even in these decades of steady expansion and the increasing familiarity of the public, the adoption of new technology lagged behind the invention process. Some railroads ﬁgured they would wait to see the new innovations thoroughly tested, and all\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

Others were just interested in the cheapest alternative—usually the older technology—in a day and age when the public’s susceptibility to the allure and glamour of the rails could often temporarily outweigh their anxiety and demands for safe practices. Thus, though steel rails were touted as “one of the most important inventions of the age,” by 1867 just 2,550 tons of these rails, at a costly $120 per ton, were being produced for railroads in the United States on an annual basis.4 Iron, however, they knew. Men like James Mahar, a native of Ireland who had spent years working for the railroads, had accumulated expertise in handling the temperamental qualities of iron rails: their deterioration under daily wear and tear, their inability to handle the heavier trains that were becoming more common, and their ﬁnicky behavior in very hot or cold temperatures. Repairs on broken and bent rails and other iron pieces—wheels, axles—were common in the winter, because “such failures were always greatest in cold weather.”5 This Wednesday morning, the problem of the broken rail was made more pressing by the fact that the village’s traﬃc was about to pick up for the day. The ﬁrst freight of the morning was due within the hour—a through train to Toledo. Mahar, thirty-one years old and a family man who lived in Angola with a wife and three children, had already had a diﬃcult morning. He had not had an easy time kindling blazing ﬁres in the stoves inside the wood-frame station house and freight house. That was another part of his duties, in addition to inspecting the rails and rail beds for ﬂaws and blockages. It was necessary to light ﬁres early so that the buildings would be heated for employees and passengers well before the sun came up.6 Now there was the rail problem to deal with. Mahar knew it was up to him to get the track in working order before the Toledo freight came through. The broken length of metal needed to be ripped out, and a new length driven in. Then the whole section of the track would need to be checked to make sure it was properly gauged. Railroad gauge, to within fractions of an inch, was of utmost importance. Most railroads set their own gauges—the Buﬀalo and Erie did, as did its neighboring lines—just as they set their own standard times. The wheels of incoming trains needed to be able to roll over the width of track that the railroads promised to provide: if a four-foot, teninch gauge was advertised, that’s what the railroad needed to maintain, or else safety could be compromised. Any alterations in the distance between the iron rails, whether by defective equipment or slipshod gauge calibration, could be enough to cause a derailment. Many railroad men of Mahar’s generation had seen such things happen, and nobody wanted to see a derailment or crash\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

The men in the Angola station knew that there was a chance the chief engineer of the Buﬀalo and Erie Railroad, Peter Emslie, would pass over the line that morning as part of his regular duties for the railroad. Emslie, a railroad veteran who had ridden the same length of track two years before during a test run for a locally built engine that had covered forty-two miles in a dazzling ninety-ﬁve minutes, had a keen eye for problems with the route he oversaw.7 Angola’s railroad employees were used to this task, because iron rails wore out fast, generally needing to be replaced every four to six months.8 But doing this repair in the midst of regular daytime traﬃc could pose a challenge. And, to make matters worse, the broken rail wasn’t on a straightaway, but at a frog in the track—a juncture where one rail curved in to join another—some six hundred feet past the depot building. Mahar and Newton talked about the repair that needed to be done. Then Mahar went to get his tools. Meanwhile, Newton walked into the depot, which was now starting to warm up. Twenty years old in 1867, the man who was likely the J. M. Newton later described in accident inquests was the son of a well-to-do Angola farmer who was one of the village’s more prominent citizens. He was young to be doing the job of station agent, but not strikingly so, at a time when some railroads were hiring telegraph operators as young as fourteen or ﬁfteen.9 Already, Newton had shown the sort of eye for meticulous detail that the railroads embraced. In his ofﬁce in the village’s station, just a few blocks down Main Street from his home on Pleasant Street, Newton scrupulously kept a log book into which he jotted his notes and observations on every train that passed through the village, whether it stopped in Angola or not. This sort of careful attention to detail was part of the reason Newton was good at his job. It was also one of the reasons this Wednesday morning was trying for him. There was the broken rail to worry about, and then there was also the problem that had cropped up with his station clock. The timepiece had bedeviled him for a week. Each day, Newton would wind the clock and check it against the Buﬀalo and Erie Railroad’s standard time. Each day, Newton’s clock lost a little. Not much: perhaps half a minute a day, or three-quarters of a minute. In any other setting, Newton wouldn’t have minded much about the discrepancy. But, as he and Mahar and the others working in the village for the Buﬀalo and Erie knew, the railroads succeeded and failed by accurate timekeeping. It was the image of dependability they sold the public, their way of maintaining safety standards, a ticket to proﬁt and success. Newton couldn’t be blamed if he felt a twinge of pressure. He knew he needed to make his clock work correctly, so that he could keep proper time throughout the long day to come. He began “regulating” the mechanism,\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\n28 ]\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nchecking it against the oﬃcial time reports from Buﬀalo, and tinkering with the works.10 With any luck, he would get it ﬁxed. And with a little more luck, this would be the most trying problem he had to deal with all day.\n\nj\n\nCopyright © 2013. Cornell University Press.

And, early on, that seemed possible. The village lay in a prime location in the town of Evans, a sprawling rural region along the Lake Erie shoreline some twenty miles southwest of Buﬀalo. Evans possessed a striking beauty. Its allure centered on the intersection of earth and water: numerous sandy beaches oﬀered easy access to the lake; wide creeks, including Eighteen Mile and Big Sister, wound through the uplands and let their ﬁsh-ﬁlled waters out into the lake in gentle bays. Along some areas of the shoreline, ancient bluﬀs ﬁlled with rich deposits of fossils towered eighty feet into the air, oﬀering peerless views of the Canadian coast across the water, Buﬀalo to the east, and Dunkirk to the west. Evans and Angola had been blessed with resources from the start. And people hurried to make the most of them. Though Evans was not carved out as a separate municipality until 1821, the area had been settled as early as 1804 by an innkeeper named Joel Harvey, who had crossed Eighteen Mile Creek—in these pre-railroad days, likely with boats and wagons—with an eye toward land to its west. Several families followed closely on Harvey’s heels. The ﬁrst birth in the town happened in 1811; the ﬁrst marriage occurred on June 28, 1815, when Persis Taylor wed Whiting Cash.11 Whiting Cash himself would die that December, in 1867, a seventy-ﬁve-year-old patriarch in the community, “one of our oldest citizens . . . who has been more or less identiﬁed with its entire history.”12 As the region grew in population, the geographic area of Angola—which would later be mapped out as about 1.4 square miles of territory set slightly back from the Lake Erie shoreline, 686 feet in elevation, and abutting Big Sister Creek—drew much of its settlement. The village, which took the name Angola for its oﬃcial title in the 1850s, soon became a center of population in the broad swath of land southwest of Buﬀalo. By 1860, the area around the creek was home to about forty-ﬁve families, some living in the commercial district abutting the railroad tracks, others in homes spread out in outlying sections that were still largely forested or open ﬁelds. Although many of its qualities and characteristics made it unique, Angola oﬀered, in this period of its history, a glimpse into the sorts of rugged little communities that were being used as through or stopping points by the burgeoning railroads, all over the country—and transformed in the process.\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

Together with its companion stream, Little Sister Creek, the creek formed half of the “Two Sisters” pair of waterways that helped irrigate parts of southern Erie County. The name of the larger body of water was deceptive: this “creek” was wide and could be deep and even dangerous, depending on the season. In the 1860s, Big Sister was located a quarter-mile or less from the Angola business district. It was described as “a shallow stream, at the ordinary level, bordered on the eastern side by a low ﬂat, thirty or forty rods wide, while its western bank rises with considerable abruptness to the level of the surrounding country.”13 The temperamental freshet ran high and wild in the spring and after rainstorms, iced over in the winter, and sometimes nearly dried out in summer. Drownings in its waters had been known to happen, especially in the spring and fall. From the time of the earliest settlements along its banks, Big Sister Creek had given mothers in the Angola area reason to worry. But while some settlers grumbled that nobody would ever settle in Angola for the farmland—which tended to be sandy loam or clay-pocked soil—others spoke rapturously about the beauty of Big Sister’s wooded banks, clear waters, and picturesque views. Joseph Bennett, who moved to Angola as a young man during this period, wrote in his journal that “no one would ever have settled here, as farmers—if the Western Prairies had been in market.”14 But Bennett, later a leader in shaping this area of southern Erie County in business, agricultural, educational, and spiritual concerns, also wrote about his delight in strapping on his ice skates and exploring the Big Sister waterway, where he found “about half a mile up . . . a bend around a beautiful ﬂat.”15 Bennett recorded his reaction to this pleasant natural scene: “Thought I never saw a more beautiful spot.”16 He was looking at roughly the place where Henry Bundy and later his three sons would operate a tool manufacturing concern and mills, which would produce both lumber and ﬂour; where a truss bridge would be erected over the waters of the creek, to connect Angola with the east. He was looking at the eventual route of the Buﬀalo and Erie’s 1867 New York Express. Though the creek helped draw settlement to Angola, ultimately it was the railroad that spurred the village’s steady growth from the late 1840s onward. Early settlers had been lured to the village ﬁrst by the planned route, then by the construction, of the Buﬀalo & State Line Railroad, which began taking shape in 1849. Among some Seneca populations of upstate New York, Angola became known as “Dyo-a-his-tah,” or “place of the depot.”17 Milling and the production of lumber for the growing urban areas of Buﬀalo became a proﬁtable business in Angola—which could ship material to Buﬀalo and other eastward points quickly and cheaply. The area’s natural resources suddenly were of value far beyond its borders.

The railroads were reshaping Angola, and its people, as they reshaped everything they touched. The railroads brought in numbers of men and women from surrounding areas—at least during the warmer months—who sought out Angola because of its sandy beaches and swimming coves. During the 1870s, observers would remark on the seasonal hubbub in the village, consisting of crowds of travelers arriving, trunks and valises in tow, for summer vacations in cottages and cabins along the lake. “Yes, sometimes when the afternoon train arrives,” local witnesses noted, “there is such a large crowd at the depot, that a person has to edge his way through.”18 People liked Angola, and many stayed. The community grew steadily throughout the Civil War, reaching about 320 residents by the early part of the 1860s and continuing to grow to more than 600 people by the early 1870s.19 Though it didn’t yet have a newspaper, Angola boasted a lively commercial strip along a broad Main Street. By 1867, Angola residents could visit, all within a few blocks, the First Congregational Church, the Angola Hotel (located to the rear of the station house next to the train tracks), the Big Sister–powered milling operations of resident Henry Bundy and his sons, S. L. Beckwith’s harness shop for leather goods, Mrs. I. S. Thompson’s shop for millinery and dresses, a saloon or two, a Masonic Hall, Cyrus Wilcox’s storefront business for boots and shoes, and Martin & Tiﬀt’s tin shop. There were also two dry goods stores, including one, Lyman Oatman and Sons, where Lyman, David, and Leroy Oatman swore that they provided only the “latest and most elegant designs” to Angolans, all at “Buﬀalo prices.”20 Because of all this energy and activity, by the 1860s people in Angola felt that they mattered. Many railroad communities in the Civil War period and afterward shared this feeling, the sense that because the railroad tied them to the larger world, they had a special importance and value not shared by other towns and villages that had been left oﬀ the railroad routes. The glamour and appeal of the nation’s railroads—linked to danger, it is true, but tantalizing nonetheless—rubbed oﬀ on even modest little places like Angola, touched by routes like the New York Express, which by its very name suggested that Angola was connected not just to familiar places like Buﬀalo, Erie, and Cleveland, but to faraway and imagined ones such as New York City. Likewise, places not linked to railroads became somewhat isolated during this time, as historians including Michael Freeman have shown, able only to observe the “useless spectacle” of the railroad, without participating in it.21 In the United States, railroads were often laid out along meandering pathways that did not look much like the ruler-straight roads typically found in\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\nA N G O L A AT D AW N\n\n[ 31\n\nCopyright © 2013.

The Buffalo and Erie Railroad tracks bisected the village’s center on a diagonal, also cutting across Big Sister Creek.\n\nEurope, particularly in England. American railroads generally curved their way through the landscape, diverting around obstacles, following natural changes and features in the terrain, and accommodating stops in many smaller settlements.22 This “natural” approach was one that early railroad companies debated with some diﬃculty.23 Should they make the railroads as simple and straightforward as possible—or should they make them less direct routes that took their time getting from place to place, but perhaps brought more communities into connection with the larger commercial and social world? Part of the decision-making process was often the political and economic pressure placed on railroaders to make sure that the lines traveled through—and thus opened up for development—certain areas of the landscape. In this sense, it was not surprising that Angola, which was already a settled area connected\n\nThe Angola Horror : The 1867 Train Wreck That Shocked the Nation and Transformed American Railroads, Cornell University Press,\n\n32 ]\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nto water and stagecoach routes, became a stopping point on the Buﬀalo and Erie’s route. Figuring out these knotty logistical problems contributed to the delays that kept many smaller railroads from opening in the time frames originally scheduled. In the end, each railroad made its own decision. The Buffalo and Erie, which sliced through Angola at a forty-ﬁve-degree angle on its Buﬀalo-to-Pennsylvania path, was more direct than many. At Angola, as at every point along these routes, the arrival of the railroad had important eﬀects. Finding themselves station stops or through-points, people in countless places like Angola arranged their daily lives and schedules around the trains. For those who had come to Angola on the railroads in the period after the late 1840s and 1850s, it was perhaps an easy transition to make. Many Angolans, whether they were longtime citizens or new arrivals, no doubt felt optimism about the presence of the railroads. They also knew that things were changing, and would go on doing so. And no one had any idea where those changes would end.\n\nCopyright © 2013. Cornell University Press.

Dr. Romaine J. Curtiss, twenty-seven years old, a Civil War veteran and a bachelor, was still relatively new to Angola, but he was already the focus of much of the village’s interest and attention. Two years before, shortly after the end of the war, Curtiss had arrived in the area. A native of Huron County in Ohio, he was on largely unfamiliar ground in Evans and Angola, which had gotten its ﬁrst resident doctor less than a decade before, in 1858.24 Before that moment, Curtiss’s experience in upstate New York had centered mostly on B"
