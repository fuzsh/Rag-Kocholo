Indigenous healers rubbed or scraped the eyes or eyelids to treat inflammation, corneal opacities, and even eye irritation from smoke. European settlers used harsh treatments, such as bleeding and blistering, when the eyes were inflamed or had loss of vision with a normal appearance (gutta serena). In New Spain, surgery for corneal opacity was performed in 1601 and cataract couching in 1611. North American physicians knew of contralateral loss of vision after trauma or surgery (sympathetic ophthalmia), which they called “sympathy.” To date, the earliest identified cataract couching by a surgeon trained in the New World was performed in 1769 by John Bartlett of Rhode Island. The American Revolution negatively affected ophthalmology, as loyalist surgeons were expelled and others were consumed with wartime activities. After the war, cataract extraction was imported to America in earnest and academic development resumed. Charles F Bartlett, the son of John, performed cataract extraction but was also a “rapacious privateer.” In 1801, a doctor in the frontier territory of Kentucky observed anticholinergic poisoning by Datura stramonium (Jimsonweed) and suggested that this agent be applied topically to dilate the pupil before cataract extraction. John Warren at Harvard preferred couching in the 1790s, but, after his son returned from European training, recommended treating angle closure glaucoma by lens extraction. Other eye procedures described or advertised in America before the 19th century included enucleation, resection of conjunctival lesions or periocular tumors, treatment of lacrimal fistula, and fitting of prosthetic eyes.\n\nKeywords: Ophthalmology history, cataract surgery\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe establishment of European colonies in the New World after 1492 brought about the proximity of indigenous, European, and African cultures, each with distinct approaches to medical care. Diseases such as smallpox, measles, scarlet fever, typhoid, cholera, diphtheria, and malaria were introduced to the Americas,1 where the native populations who lacked immunity suffered very high mortality rates. The Old World skills and techniques in every medical area, including ophthalmology, were gradually transferred to the Americas. In Europe, spectacles were used to correct refractive error and cataract couching was performed. European oculists and other surgeons traveled to the colonies, and early American settlers returned to Europe for training.\n\nWe present a review of some aspects of early North American ophthalmology not highlighted previously in the ophthalmology literature.2 –4 This review discusses the following: (1) Native American cultures, (2) particular eye ailments and treatments, and (3) surgeon biographies and early American universities. We define North America to include the areas of present-day Canada, the United States, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Greenland.\n\nA complete list of native American and European ophthalmic remedies during this period is beyond the scope of this work.5 The cases presented are merely illustrative examples of early American treatments.\n\nWe searched for terms such as eye, oculist, cataract, glaucoma, and retina in numerous databases: American newspapers,6 the Human Relations Area Files,7 the Colonial North American Project,8 American National Biography Online,9 the Dictionary of Canadian Biography,10 Hemeroteca Nacional Digital de México,11 Caribbean Newspapers (1718-1876),12 Early American Imprints (1639-1819),13,14 American Periodicals Series Online,15 Founders Online,16 Early English Books Online,17 and Gale Eighteenth Century Collections.18\n\nNative American Ophthalmology\n\nOverview\n\nSome information about Native American understanding of the eye comes from the reports of European settlers. Of course, these observers wrote from their own perspectives and may not have always understood what they were seeing. The Native Americans may have been influenced by earlier European settlers. Moreover, some eye diseases treated by the Natives, such as smallpox and trachoma, were not even thought to have existed in pre-Columbian America. These limitations notwithstanding, the reports provide some idea of the types of treatments typical among indigenous peoples. In multiple areas, corneal opacities and eyelid ailments were treated by scraping the eyes or eyelids. In total, 9 of the 12 (75%) Native American healers we identified were women. We did not find evidence that Native cultures had identified the crystalline lens.\n\nNative use of therapeutic phlebotomy (bloodletting) was not universal. The Nahuatl, Comanches, Maricopas, Montagnais, and tribes of Lower California performed therapeutic bleeding, but the Algonquins and certain Canadian tribes did not.1 In a few cases, the Native groups seemed to have learned of it from European settlers.1 When the Native Americans west of the Mississippi, did perform bleeding, “They seldom let blood in any considerable quantity, and never . . . until fainting is induced.”19\n\nThe mouth was one of the earliest medical tools, whether used to suck, lick, or blow. Some substances placed topically to treat eye disorders seem to be soothing, such as breast milk or coconut milk. Even today, the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties of milk or saliva have been the subject of scientific investigation. In other cases of indigenous medicine, chemically or physically abrasive substances, such as peppers or pieces of shells, were applied to the eyes, often with some mechanical scraping to dislodge opacities or cause bleeding. These remedies, used for both inflammation and corneal opacities, were intermediate between medicine and surgery. Often, the soothing substances were applied to inflamed eyes, whereas the harsh treatments were used to remove opacities. However, this pattern did not apply universally.\n\nMesoamerica and the Caribbean\n\nThe Nahuatl of Mesoamerica (which included the Aztecs) had anatomic terms for the eyelid (ixquatolli), eyebrow (ixquamolli), eye (ixtelolotli), and pupil (tixtotouh).20 Intraocular structures such as the crystalline lens were not described.20 Among the Aztecs of Mexico, wounds could be sutured and dressed.5\n\nFrancisco Hernández de Toledo was a physician who explored New Spain (in the region of present-day Mexico) from 1570 to 1577 and recorded the botanical life and its native uses. A variety of plants from New Spain and the Caribbean were applied to the eyes to treat inflammation. The tomato, a plant indigenous to the Americas, was considered by native healers to help with “blocked tear ducts and headaches.”21\n\nPhlebotomy (bloodletting) was used for both religious and medical purposes among the Nahuatl.5,22 Therapeutic cupping was also performed.5 Cupping involves heating a cup placed on the skin. When the cup cools, a vacuum is created to draw blood to the surface. Cupping is performed throughout the world to this day.23 The Nahuatl often practiced wet cupping, which involves the same procedure along with skin incisions, to allow blood to collect in the cup.5\n\nWomen healers often treated eye diseases among the Nahuatl.5,24 A Nahuatl healer, María Salome, treated red eyes by irrigating with cold water, along with an incantation demanding that the “snakes” (conjunctival vessels) stop “mistreating” the “enchanted mirror” (the eyes).5\n\nIn the Americas, a variety of preparations were used to treat “spots” or “films” on the eyes. These terms generally referred to a corneal opacities. Most of the preparations, such as coconut milk, were used topically. The indigenous recipe of New Spain called for the Mexican poppy to be applied with an unusual solvent (breast milk):21 “The Milk, with a Womans Milk that bore a Female, dropt into the Eyes, Cures their Inflammations.”25\n\nAmong the Huichol of northern Mexico, traditional curanderos (healers) treated trachoma by a ceremony which concluded by sucking blood and pus from the eyes and then spitting this out along with a ceremonial “crystal” which represented the disease.26\n\nThe capsicum peppers (the active ingredient in modern pepper spray) include both spicy and sweet species native to Central and South America. The spicy varieties contain capsaicin and are also known by the Nahuatl (Aztec) name chilli. Hernández noted of the chilli pepper quauhchilli, that “The Twigs bark’d take off spots and marks from the Eyes.” This shrub “was planted by the Indian Kings in their Gardens.”25 One wonders whether the twigs would have been used to scrape the corneas. The 1615 publication based on Hernández manuscripts noted merely that “the cortex of the new sprouts, applied to the eyes [aplicada a los ojos] resolves the clouds [nuebes].”27 Even if the material was simply laid on the unanesthetized eye, the mechanical effect of forceful eyelid closure might have removed corneal opacities.\n\nHenry Barham (circa 1670-1726) of England, who resided on Jamaica during the end of the 17th century, described “capsicum peppers” on Jamaica and reported that\n\nSome punish their slaves by putting the juice of these peppers into their eyes . . . and yet . . . some Indians will put it into their eyes before they go to strike fish, to make them see clearer.28\n\nCorneal opacities were treated by placing potentially abrasive substances on the eyes. The account of a French voyager to the Caribbean, initially published in 1658, described,\n\n. . . the Eye-stone . . . so cleer, transparent, and smooth: Some of them have red or blewish veins, which give them a very delightful lustre. Being put under the eye-lid, they roll about the ball of the eye . . . they strengthen and cleer the sight, and force thence the motes, or trash which might have fallen into it.29\n\nIn 1650, on the island of Dominica, one “Mr. du Parquet” was on the verge of traveling to France for treatment of a film on his eyes when a Carib arranged to have his wives perform a cure.30 The women “washed his eyes with cotton dipped into the juice of certain herbs. Then they wiped his eyes with their tongues,” and several days later, the “speck” fell off his eyes.30\n\nAccording to the cleric Hernando Ruiz de Alarcón, eye surgery was performed in 1629 by the Nahuatl in Atenango in the present-day area of Guerrero, southwest of Mexico City.31 For “dust and superfluities that obstruct my conjured crystal” (the eye), which was also called the “mirror,” the strong herb tlachichinoa, which means “incendiary” (and can correspond with Tournefortia capitate), was used to prick and rub the eyes until they bled.5\n\nIn Mesoamerica, liquid exuded by the mesquite or acacia tree, or water in which the shoots had been soaked, was placed in the eyes.21 The sap from the bark of the mesquite tree was used by a Nahuatl healer, Marta Mónica, to treat a painful inflammatory eye condition called “xoxouhqui coacihuiztli,” which has been translated as “blue-green pain.”24 The color has also been simply translated as “green.”5 The sap was collected on a “pearly head” which has been translated as the head of a pin5 or the index finger.24 The coated finger (or pin) was used to rub the patient’s eye until it bled.5,24 The eyelids were then anointed with tobacco, and chicken blood was placed in the eyes.5,24 Undoubtedly, some cases of eye pain would have been due to angle closure glaucoma. Did the characterization “xoxouhqui” imply a green pupil? The question is important because many cases of angle closure glaucoma appear to have a green pupil.32 –34 However, the translations are not explicit on this point. The range of use of mesquite for eye ailments extended northward to the American Southwest, including the Mescalero Apaches, Pimas, and Maricopas.1\n\nAn early 16th century Franciscan missionary recorded that the Nahuatl doctors “cure well . . . eye illnesses and cut the fleshy growth [cortar la carnaza] from them.”21 He specified that “The cataracts [Las cataratas] of the eyes have to be scraped and abraded [se han de raspar y raer]” with a root.21 Presumably this condition actually represented ocular surface opacities, such as pterygium. Alternatively, one could “scrape the inside of the eyelids [rasparse lo interior de los parparos]” with an herb.21 Bleeding and purging were also used. A branching lesion on the eye (presumably a pterygium) was removed by lifting with a thorn [“Lo enramado de los ojos, se ha de procurar cortar la telilla alzandola con alguna espina”].21 Then, mother’s milk was applied to the eyes.\n\nA 20th century Garifuna male doctor of Belize treated a woman with chronic eye inflammation and media opacity with “a plaster made out of egg, vinegar, flour, nutmeg, and alumn.”35 In general, for eye inflammation, he treated with eggshells finely ground.35\n\nMid-continental indigenous ophthalmology\n\nOne early 17th century observer in New York declared that “It is somewhat strange that among these most barbarous people, there are few or none cross-eyed, blind, crippled, lame, hunch-backed or limping men.”36 However, the Meskwakis were reported to have used liverwort (Hepatica acutiloba), presumably orally, to treat esotropia.1\n\nPoor vision represented a substantial handicap. In 1850, in the Missouri River valley, Thaddeus Culbertson, who described cases of apparent euthanasia among the natives, had heard of “. . . a blind Crow Indian having been taken to a battle in the hope that he might be killed . . .”37\n\nWomen played prominent medical roles in this region ( ).38 A woman’s breast milk was placed in the eyes by the Rappahannocks to treat sore eyes in children, granulated eyelids, or tearing eyes.1 The bark of the slippery elm (Ulmus fulva) was chewed by the Potawatomis and the product was placed on inflamed eyes.1\n\nOne observer noted of tribes west of the Mississippi “Affections of the eyes sometimes occur, but I have never known them to attempt cures by any manual operations. When highly inflamed, they blow decrepitated [roasted] salt into them . . .”19 Smoke from prairie fires frequently irritated the eyes. A “cold watery infusion for sore eyes” could be made with yellow root or sassafras.19\n\nA Comanche woman described rubbing the palpebral conjunctiva until it bled with a blade of rye grass to treat trachoma:\n\nYou . . . double it up and turn the eye lid over and scrape it . . . until it bleeds . . . until it finally comes off. It’s the eye lid that causes cataracts because those things rub on the eye and make them sores.39\n\nAmong the Pawnee of the 19th century, a male doctor poured mother’s milk into a man’s eyes and then wrapped a white cloth around a bullet: “He then carefully scraped the eye, then used his mouth, tongue and suction to remove the cataract.”40 Presumably, a corneal opacity was treated.\n\nThe Paiute Tribe of the region which became the western United States retained “eye scrapers.”41 We do not know the full range of conditions treated, but to treat a man with a “sty,” one woman healer “scraped his eye.”41\n\nSmoke was typically considered an eye irritant. The natives of the Great Plains were said to have conjunctival disorders from remaining in smoke-filled tipis.1 However, the Navajo placed herbs, including piñon, juniper, sage, and prickly pear cactus, over hot stones to create steam used to treat eye disorders.1\n\nThe Miami-Illinois natives of the Midwest used “For films on the eyes, a shell of all sorts of river shell fish, burned and pulverized, blown in the eye.”42 An additional case relating to both indigenous and European ophthalmology is noted below in the section on lacrimal fistula.\n\nNorthern indigenous ophthalmology\n\nAccording to a member of the Mi’kmaq of Eastern Canada, the native understanding involved the eye being hollow in the center. Any foreign body getting into the hollow portion would cause blindness. The eye was thought to be attached to the orbital bones by a posterior membrane and by a posterior muscle.43\n\nFor some eye diseases, the bridge of the nose was pierced without bleeding, somewhat akin to acupuncture.44 Father Gideon, an early 19th century missionary to Alaska, recorded that for some eye conditions, a sharpened bear bone was passed through the skin of the eyebrow and the nasal bridge, just missing the eye itself.44 The Chugach “Eskimos” treated eye inflammation by bleeding the temples.44\n\nGideon also noted that the Kodiak would fasten a live louse to a hair, lower the insect onto the eye, and “when the insect is observed to have attached itself securely to the film that has formed in the eye, it is then yanked out.” This procedure was repeated until the film was eliminated.44 Independent accounts confirm that this story circulated among the early Russian settlers,44 but we do not know whether it was true.\n\nThe Tlingit of Alaska used a more conventional treatment. Vines were heated, broken, and placed “close to a white spot in the eye” to remove the spot.45 Tlingit women sought and cultivated medicinal plants. One woman intended to heat deerberry leaves, cut them to size, and place them on her eye overnight because “in the morning the cataract comes right off.”46\n\nHans Egede, a missionary in Greenland, reported in 1741 that to treat pterygium or pseudopterygium, the Inuits “. . . make a little hook out of a sewing needle and thread it, and then with a knife rip skin or membranes off.”47 In 1752, an Inuit woman operated on her husband’s only eye, but the eye was penetrated, and he became totally blind.47\n\nEspecially in the Northern latitudes, the environmental concerns of snow and smoke blindness were particularly important. Native tribes of Alaska constructed snow goggles to reduce exposure to sunlight ( ).48 Among the Tlingit of Southeastern Alaska, snow blindness was common and was avoided by blackening the face or by a headband.49 Piercing of the skin without bleeding was used for snow blindness in parts of Alaska.44 On Nelson Island, Alaska, human milk was placed in the eyes for snow blindness.44 The Chandalar Kutchin and the Upper Tanana of Alaska cut the skin around the eyes for snow blindness.44 This procedure was usually performed by women.44 Some natives used a knife made of stone.44\n\nAmong the Pomo tribe of California, myopia was called ho saha (fire smoke) because it was attributed to irritation from the smoke of a sweat lodge.50 Therapy involved a “sucking doctor” who would suck the smoke from the eye.50\n\nGabriel Druilletes (1610-1681) of France served as a Jesuit missionary in New France.51 While on a hunting expedition with the native Montagnais (Inuu) in late 1643, at the age of 33 years, Father Druillettes’ eyes were bothered by the smoke in the lodges.51 He began stepping on the feet of others in the camp. Finally, he lost his sight altogether:\n\nThe Savages were surprised . . . when they saw that . . . he suffered such pain that his strength failed him. They consulted among themselves whether they should not wrap him up like a parcel, tie him on their sleds, and haul him like the rest of their baggage.\n\nAt this, Druillettes laughed and suggested they instead provide a child to guide him. Next,\n\nThey held an assembly concerning his disease . . . if he would submit to their remedies, he might be cured . . . Thereupon a woman who was selected to effect the cure, rose from her place and said to him: “Go out of the Cabin, my Father; open thine eyes, and look at the Sky.” . . . this fine oculist armed with a bit of knife blade, or of rusty iron, scraped his eyes till a little humor flowed from them. Never had the poor Father suffered so much. The hand of the operator was not as light as a feather, and she possessed no more skill than science.51\n\nDruillettes prayed and asked the natives to do the same. In the middle of the Mass, “a bright ray suddenly opened the eyes of the poor blind man” and he henceforth experienced no further pain or vision loss.51 Druillettes’ attribution of his condition to the effect of smoke might be accurate, but given the time outdoors in the snow, a solar keratopathy might have contributed.\n\nPacific Islands\n\nIn Hawaii, the treatment of a media opacity translated from the indigenous language as “cataracts” (but presumably actually corneal opacity) involved “gently scraping the surface of the cornea with a bit of soft kapa, soft kukae pua’a grass [Digitaria pruriens, itchy crabgrass], or soft sweet potato leaf which was twirled in the fingers across the eye.”52 Next, “juice from the popolo [Solanum nigrum, black nightshade] was dropped into the inflamed eye.”52 In addition, “masticated kukae pua’a might also be blown from the mouth across the eyeball.”52\n\nIn babies with “weak eyes,” mother’s milk was placed in the eyes or by blowing across the eyes the masticated leaf of a lele banana or the flower of an ‘ilima [Sida].52 Coconut milk was also used as an eye wash.52 Alonzo Chapin, a missionary in Hawaii in the 1830s, recorded frequent purulent ophthalmia, with opaque corneas, in all ages.52\n\nAn illustration of the surgery performed in the Pacific comes from the voyage of James Cook to Tonga in 1777. Cook described an operation done by “the natives of these islands”:\n\n. . . a woman was dressing the eyes of a young child, who seemed blind; the eyes being much inflamed, and a thin film spread over them. The instruments she used were two slender wooden probes, with which she had brushed the eye so as to make them bleed.53\n\nEye Diseases and Treatments\n\nReturn to Europe for care\n\nEarly European settlers sometimes returned to Europe for eye care. Christopher Columbus suffered from an eye ailment while in America. He was noted to have a disorder affecting the use of his legs on his first return from America in 1493. He experienced fever and vision loss on his second voyage to the Caribbean in 1494. On his third voyage in 1499, he experienced arthritis (“gota”) followed later while off the coast of Venezuela by bloodshot and painful eyes (which he described as “rompieron de sangre y con tantos dolores”).54 Columbus was bedridden during much of his time on Jamaica in 1503 and 1504 until his death in Spain in 1506.54 The modern differential diagnosis includes reactive arthritis with uveitis.54\n\nOther early eye patients also returned to Europe. The oculist Dawbigney Turberville (1612-1696) of Salisbury, England, treated the eye condition of a woman who returned from Jamaica. Turberville had expertise:\n\nIn knowing when the connate Cataract is fit to be Couched, in having a steady Hand, and skill to perform that Operation . . . his Fame brought multitudes to him . . . even from America . . . a young Woman coming out of a Boat, who as soon as she had set foot on Land, kneeled down and said these words . . . Oh Lord God, I pray thee, that I may find Dr. Turbervile living, and not make this long Voyage in vain . . . .She went to Salisbury, and . . . was perfectly cured; but her Joy did not last long, for in her return to Jamaica, of which Island her Husband was one of the principal Inhabitants, she died of the Small-Pox in London.55\n\nOther voyagers were more fortunate. The sovereigns of England and France held that their touch could cure the disease known as the “king’s evil,” which modern historians believe was caused by tuberculosis. Obviously, this cure was not available in America. An English writer of 1684 learned from one Mr Doublebrook that\n\na Woman who came from Virginia, whose Nose was almost eaten away with the Evil, and her Eyes consumed with that Humour, she being brought by him to the King to be Touched, immediately received benefit thereby, and returned to Virginia since, and as a token of Thanks to him, she sent him a Pair of Gloves, with a Letter, wherein she certified him that she was recovered from her Disease . . . .56\n\nEye inflammation medical treatment\n\nBefore the invention of the ophthalmoscope and slit lamp, all eye inflammations were generally diagnosed as ophthalmia57 or colloquially “sore eyes.” “Sore eyes” constituted 3% of all medical diagnoses recorded by Thomas Reide, a British Army surgeon near the St. Lawrence River from 1776 to 1787, and with an average regimental strength of 511 soldiers,58 we calculate that approximately 18% of the soldiers would have experienced this condition during a given 11-year period of service.\n\nNumerous systemic diseases could produce eye inflammation. Syphilis, even today a cause of uveitis, was probably introduced to Europe with the return of Columbus. Medical remedies from the New World, “Sassafras and Sarsaparilla” were used in Europe for “venereal disease.”59 Yellow fever epidemics were common through the end of the 18th century. This disorder involved “. . . head-ach . . . [in] the lower part of the forehead, the eye balls and their sockets” and “a remarkable inflammation in the tunica adnata [conjunctiva] . . .”60\n\nMedical use of mother’s milk was not restricted to the indigenous cultures. According to physician John Tennent (circa 1700-1748) of Williamsburg, who wrote a collection of home remedies, “Common Sore Eyes may be cur’d by washing them with Breast Milk, warm Sage Tea, or with Rose Water . . .”61\n\nTherapeutic phlebotomy was a mainstay of European medical treatment during this period. English physician Hans Sloane described multiple ophthalmic patients from his time on Jamaica in the 17th century. A 45-year-old cook “given to Drink” chronically had “inflam’d swell’d Eyes” which Sloane treated with “bleeding, purging, and blistering.”24 Sloane recounted that a turner cutting down a “Mansanillo Tree” had “the Milk spurted into his Eye” rendering it “sore and inflam’d” and “the Eyelids were so swell’d and glu’d together . . . that he could not open them.” Sloane ordered bleeding, purging and “order’d him to wet his Eye very often in cold water . . .” Irrigation remains a key part of the modern treatment for a chemical injury. The patient was “cured” in 3 days.24 Other authors agreed that if the “milk” of the “Manchenillo-Trees” fell “into the eye, it will cause an insupportable inflammation, and the party shall lose his sight for 9 days.29 The “Indians” of the Caribbean used the tree to “anoint their poison’d Arrows for Wars.”62\n\nTobacco (Nicotiana), a plant native to the Americas, was held by some to soothe the eyes. Limited medical use was documented among the natives. For instance, the Maya used tobacco to treat sore eyes.1 Many Native tribes, such as those in the Carolinas, smoked the plant.1 Some Native groups ingested tobacco or applied the juice or leaves externally.1 The European cultures were more enthusiastic about tobacco’s health benefits. One 1722 advertisement for “Cephalick and Opthalmick Tobacco” made from “the very best Virginia Tobacco” always\n\n. . . Restores ancient Sight, & preserves young Eyes, that by the Use of it, Persons . . . never come to wear Spectacles . . . It brings away Rheums & Humors that cause . . . Sore, Weak, Watery, & Dim Eyes . . . .63\n\nTuberville of England also “generally prescribd to all, shaving their Heads and taking Tobacco, which he had often known to do much good, and never any harm to the Eyes.”55 But not everyone was convinced. A 1716 tract advised that tobacco from “warm Virginia, or Bermuda’s fields fits only for your slaves; rejects the bane, which hurts the eyes; and stupefies the brain.”64\n\nSloane wrote that in Jamaica “Sore Eyes, inflam’d, and painful, are very ordinary here.” He observed “sometimes a Cataract to begin with an Inflammation there.” He recommended bleeding, purging, and “blistering in the Neck.” This treatment was successful, unless the inflammation came from “much Venery,” which had to be cured by “Abstinence” and medicines, such as “I used outwardly to drop into the Eyes . . . Rose-water, Lapis Calaminaris, & Tutia.” These medicines were recommended by others during this period.65 He also applied “lime juice,” which was not a classic English recipe.24\n\nSloane maintained a lifelong interest in ophthalmic conditions. He eventually acquired and published the recipe for an “ointment for sore eyes,” consisting of “prepared tutty” (an oxide of zinc), “blood stone” (a gem spotted or streaked with red), “succotrine aloes in fine powder” (a plant originally from the island of Socotra, in modern Yemen), and “prepared pearl,” mixed with “viper’s fat.”66 This recipe continued to be published in America even at the end of the 18th century.66\n\nSome native plants used medicinally by the indigenous peoples were adopted by the Europeans. A Dr Chisolm of Grenada in 1790 learned that the “Arrowawks” near Demerary in Dutch Guiana used a plant which the “Indians” called “Akuserunee” and which he called the “eye-root” was effective in “curing inflammations of the eyes.”67 One places one drop of the plant’s juice in the eye daily for 4 days. Chisolm used the remedy successfully in 2 patients in Grenada: “a porter negro, who had nearly lost the use of his eyes by the violence of the inflammation, the other a sailor . . .” Chisolm proposed the name Bignonia Ophthalmica.67\n\nFor fever with headache and “inflammation in the Eye,” Tennent advised to “bleed 10 Ounces . . . purge with the Decoction of Mallows, and 3 Spoonfuls of Syrrup of Peach Blossoms” and apply a “Poultis” of “Sage, Wormwood, and Rue” with nutmeg, and “Blister” near the site of the pain.61\n\nCorneal opacity: nonsurgical cures\n\nCorneal opacities in this era undoubtedly had multiple causes, such as pterygium, corneal edema, band keratopathy, and corneal scarring, from trauma or prior infection.\n\nSmallpox survivors were frequently left with scarring of the cornea or face. John Adams recorded the effect of smallpox:\n\nThere is a poor Man . . . is the most shocking sight . . . he is no more like a Man than he is like an Hog or an Horse—swelled to three times his size, black as bacon, blind as a stone.68\n\nBarham on Jamaica knew of islanders who successfully used “a sort of thyme” locally called “eye-bright,” “to take off the spots or films on the eyes that have come after the small-pox . . . by only dropping the milky juice into them.”28 It is not clear whether this plant was the same as Euphrasia, also called eyebright, which was a long-standing eye remedy in Europe.69 The traditional eyebright (Euphrasia) was discussed as a remedy for eye inflammation in the Medicina Britannica, republished in Philadelphia in 1751 by Benjamin Franklin. The editor of this American edition, botanist John Bartram of Philadelphia, noted that he had never seen Euphrasia growing in America, however, he had tried to sow it, and others had erroneously called other American plants by this name.70 Bartram might have had a particular interest in this type of medicine, as he wrote to Franklin, “My eye sight fails me very much,” and that he was turning over matters to his son for that reason in 1771.71 Franklin responded by mailing spectacles to Bartram.72 Whether Euphrasia really grew locally or not, medicines based on the plant were advertised. For instance, in the 1770s, physician John Sparhawk (1730-1803) of Philadelphia sold “Essentia euphragiæ,” to be given topically, which “. . . removes all Specks, Films, Mists, and Suffusions, cures all Runnings of watery and foul Humours . . .”73 Sparhawk advised in cases of “. . . Inflammation or Redness in the Eyes, to take off 10 or 12 Ounces of Blood.”73\n\nTennent, the Virginia physician, recommended,\n\nIn case a film shou’d grow over the Sight of the Eye, occasioned by a Blow, a sharp Humour, or other Accident, you may take it off . . . Dry Humane Dung in the Sun . . . and having reduced it to a very fine Powder, blow it thro’ a Quil Two or Three Times a Day into the Eye . . . .61\n\nWe learn more about corneal pathology from the settlement established when Lutherans from Salzburger emigrated to establish Ebenezer, Georgia, in 1734. One-third of the settlers died in the first 2 years.74 Two 20-year-old “blind boys” born in the early days of the settlement cooked, fetched water, and cleaned dishes under the supervision of a preceptor.75 In 1749, a “rich and well-known planter” near Charleston with poor vision for 2 years requested essentia dulcis ad oculos, an expensive eye ointment containing gold dust, which had already helped him to recover vision in one eye. The settlement pastor, Johann Martin Boltzius (1703-1765), declined to provide further ointment and suggested that the planter travel to visit the settlement’s doctor or surgeon.76\n\nBoltzius himself suffered a variety of symptoms which we might propose as coming from at least 2 conditions. Historians have long believed that Boltzius developed malaria at some point. As early as October 1736, Boltzius suffered from “severe dizziness and cramps.”77 At that time, he also wrote of “the fever that has befallen all of us.”77 He used “essentiam antihypochondriaca or spleen opening essence,” “pillulae purgantes,” and “balsamus cephalicus nervus” for these conditions.77 The medication for the spleen suggests that perhaps he already had malaria.\n\nMalaria can result in retinal hemorrhages and edema,78 but we believe that Boltzius suffered from an unrelated eye condition, possibly ocular rosacea. In the Winter of 1753, Boltzius began to get “inflammation” in the left eye.75 The eye “inflammation” was initially accompanied with “a head cold” in which “the head was full of fluid.” By May of 1754, the inflammation had subsided, and Boltzius described his left eye as having “a thin film over the eyeball,” and later as “covered with a white film.”75 Boltzius wrote that the worse eye was “just as sensitive as the healthy one,” perhaps to indicate that light perception was still present. Unfortunately, his surgeon Johann Ludwig Mayer (1715–1763) was too “timid” to operate.75,77 Boltzius was unable to write in his journal for some time.75 By the spring of 1755, medicines and “glasses” had been sent from Europe to help the pastor cope with his eye condition.75\n\nBy 1759, symptoms consistent with cerebral malaria were prominent: he had “dizziness,” both eyes were “cloudy,” he felt “pressure in them,” with his head “full of fluid.”75 He had occasional hearing loss, with “ringing and roaring of the ears” (tinnitus).75 His physician Christian Ernst Thilo (1708-1765), trained in Halle, recommended exercise and moderation.77 Boltzius submitted to bloodletting 4 times yearly. Thilo judged his blood to be “proper consistency, but every time a whitish film, like a powder, covers over what is collected in the bowl against the edge”75 (possibly due to leukocytosis). As the intended delivery of medicines to the settlement had not arrived for several years, they again requested medicines, including essentia dulcis.75 Thilo deemed treatment futile, and Boltzius feared that medicines might damage the right eye. His right eye was normally “clear” but became “cloudy like a glaucoma” when he had “catarrh” in his “nasal passages.”75 Glaucoma in much of the European ophthalmology literature of the 18th century had begun to specifically represent angle closure glaucoma.32–33 However, in a colloquial sense, Boltzius probably simply meant that the cornea appeared lighter. He also noted “rosiness or redness” of the face.75 In September 1762, he had an episode of fatigue, nose bleeding, fever, coughing.75 Herpetic keratitis is in the differential diagnosis and is known to be associated with malaria, although it usually occurs unilaterally. Rosacea could explain the facial skin changes, conjunctival injection followed by a corneal pannus over the left eye, and intermittent keratitis in the right eye. Cerebral malaria might account for the leukocytosis, vertigo, and tinnitus.\n\nCorneal and conjunctival surgery\n\nSurgery apparently for corneal opacity was performed in early New Spain ( ). Fray (Father) Lope de Cuellar had poor vision after a fall at the Temple of Yanhuitlán in Oaxaca in 1601.79 One eye had “a cloud which covered the entire pupil [una nube, que le cubría toda la niña],” perhaps a traumatic cataract, and was deemed untreatable.80 The other eye was found to have “a fleshy or raised opacity [una carnosidad o catarata levadiza],” which might have been a preexisting corneal lesion, such as a pterygium. The surgeon of the monastery picked at the fleshy material with a needle until Lope exclaimed that he could see the Rosary and thanked God. The surgeon said that he had missed a little tissue and continued to use his instrument. Unfortunately, he ruptured the eye (“reventó el ojo”). Although the patient lost all vision, he again thanked God with equanimity.80 Even centuries ago, the perfect was the enemy of the good.\n\nTable 1.\n\nYearSurgeon: comment1611Francisco Drago in Mexico “removed pterygia [extirpar carnosidades]”41761“Doctor Hugh Tomb . . . lately arrived from Ireland . . . was educated at the university of Edenburgh, and has practised in Physick, Surgery & Midwifry, for three years in Ireland . . . he engages to cure . . . filtrims on the eyes, commonly call’d Pearls . . .” Philadelphia821771James Graham: A woman from Bound Brook, New Jersey described Graham “curing my son of a film over his right eye, occasioned by the small-pox, so that he has now recovered his sight perfectly”831773Francis Mercier. “. . . undertakes to cure . . .

I, Mary Irons, of Queen’s county, Maryland, was afflicted with blindness for many years . . . Doctor Yeldall . . . brought me to the sight of one eye in a minute’s time, by taking off the film . . . .85\n\nA New York advertisement from 1778 read,\n\nFrederick Carle Pflag, Surgeon of the Hessian Grenadier Battallion De Lengercke . . . is ready to serve . . . as an Oculist . . . Those who have the misfortune to be wall-eyed, he will relieve by operation, by taking out the skin of the dark eye, in the newest and best fashion, without any pain, so that they may have immediately their sight again . . . He may be found in the camp of said battalion near Haerlem . . . .88\n\nAt the time, a “wall-eye” often referred to having one light and one dark eye. As Pflag proposed operating on the darker eye, perhaps he was resecting a conjunctival nevus or melanoma.\n\nPeter Degravers was a colorful surgeon who advertised in Jamaica in 1791.89 His ophthalmology text noted, “The disorders of the cornea are very common. The albugo and spots which grow on this membrane are produced by inflammations very ill attended to.”95 Degravers noted that smallpox was a frequent cause of corneal scarring. He continued, “The Pterygium is a rising, fleshy membrane, which . . . extends slowly from the conjunctiva to the cornea . . .”95 He added, “The pterygium, as well as an infinity of tumors, which grown under the eye-lids, may be extracted without the least danger to the organ . . .”95\n\nAngle closure glaucoma\n\nAngle closure glaucoma was probably more common historically when cataract surgery was not widely available. In the pre-ophthalmoscopic era, we might suspect that patients were having an attack of angle closure when they experienced acute or subacute loss of vision, pain, a red eye, mydriasis, and an anteriorly prominent lens. Indigenous Mesoamerican healers might have treated angle closure glaucoma, as described above.\n\nSloane recounted the 1688 story from Jamaica of “Dr Rook’s Wife,” 35 years old, who\n\nlost entirely the sight of one of her Eyes, and with the other could very hardly perceive any thing . . . The Pupil of one stood always wide open, and that of the other on looking at distance or near Objects, scarce alter’d, contracted or dilated its self . . .\n\nSloane “order’d her to be Bled by Cupping with Scarification in the Shoulders, to be blister’d in the Neck, to be purg’d . . .” He also ordered thyme, sage, rosemary, and millipedes, all by mouth. The use of millpedes was a favorite therapy of Robert Boyle, a friend of Sloane’s. Sloane reported that she eventually could “read Bibles of the smallest Print.”24 We cannot be certain of the diagnosis in this case of asymmetric myrdriasis. The vision loss seems more extreme than would be expected with an Adie’s tonic pupil. Sloane does not describe the pain and redness anticipated in angle closure glaucoma, but the description could be incomplete.\n\nJames Graham was the only practitioner who published the term “glaucoma” in the region during the 18th century. He lectured on glaucoma at the College of Philadelphia in 1773. Glaucoma had transitioned from the nonspecific concept of the light-colored eye of the ancient Greek authors by the 18th century to more specifically represent, in many works, the light green or gray pupil sometimes seen in angle closure glaucoma.32 –34\n\nFor surgeon Peter Degravers, “the glaucoma is an opacity of the vitreous body” which turns “a green color.”95 His description of a separate vitreous disorder (which he did not name) resembles angle closure glaucoma. The patients have eye pain, with “the pupil more dilated than ordinary, contracting but very little,” severe vision loss, occurring in both eyes simultaneously or sequentially.95 This pathology eventually could be observed “terminating always in an incurable glaucoma.”95 He did note that the expanding vitreous “brings the crystalline lens forward, and presses on the posterior part of the iris.”95 Degravers noted that the disorder could sometimes be cured, but he did not indicate how.95\n\nJohn Collins Warren at Harvard Medical School performed lens extraction and even a crude limited vitrectomy for what he called “Dislocation of the crystalline lens.”96 (His middle name is written to distinguish him from his father, also John Warren of Harvard.) These cases are consistent with angle closure glaucoma. Cataract extraction for angle closure glaucoma was performed by William Mackenzie of Scotland in 1833.33 Thus, lensectomy for angle closure glaucoma was performed in America well before the publication of Mackenzie’s text.\n\nJohn Collins Warren wrote, “About the year 1806, there occurred . . . the first case I had ever noticed, or seen described, of spontaneous dislocation of the crystalline lens.”97 The case involved “. . . a man of about forty, who was suddenly attacked with violent pain in his right eye, without any external cause.”96 Later, Warren added to the description of\n\n. . . a gentleman who had a very severe inflammation of one eye . . . the pupil neither dilated nor contracted . . . the slow progress of the disease, the opacity of the crystalline lens, its prominent position, and the semi-globular projection of the eye, led me to suspect that the crystalline lens was misplaced, and made a pressure on the iris.97\n\nHe also described the lens position as “near to the cornea”96 and recounted,\n\nWith the advice and aid of my father, I performed the operation of extraction by first opening the cornea, enlarging the aperture with the scissors, and then dissecting the crystalline lens from its adhesion to the iris. The patient was thus relieved from suffering, but, of course, could not recover his vision.97\n\nJohn Collins Warren described a number of cases of “lens dislocation” in 1816. One “Mr. G. was attacked with a severe pain in one of his eyes.”96 Warren noted “an immoveable pupil, in which lay the crystalline lens having its edge projected through the opening.”96 Warren offered lens extraction, but the patient declined, and was chronically troubled with pain until his death.96\n\nAlso under the heading of “Dislocation of the Crystalline Lens,” Warren added that a lady with “inflammation of the eye” had an “immoveable, and slightly dilated” pupil, with monthly recurrences of eye pain.96 Warren judged her symptoms to be too mild to offer lens extraction.96\n\nIn another case under this heading, Warren described a woman with sudden right eye pain, vision loss, inflammation, a tender eye, and a fixed dilated pupil. Warren “made a puncture in the cornea, introduced a probe, and found the crystalline lens pressing . . . on the cornea.”96 Warren then enlarged the wound with scissors and extracted the lens. This maneuver provided only temporary relief, but when the pain returned, Warren noted “the vitreous humour was projecting through the wound in the cornea.”96 When removing the prolapsed vitreous did not relieve the pain, Warren “passed a cataract knife into the cornea made a large crucial incision, gave vent to a considerable part of the discoloured vitreous humour and thus relieved her.”96 Warren’s description is consistent with a successful vitrectomy for malignant glaucoma.\n\nLater, Warren added,\n\nA number of years ago, I was called to a lady who had spontaneous dislocation of both lenses, known by dilatation and immobility of the pupil, prominence of the iris and cornea, and the severity of pain . . . I proposed the operation of extraction.97\n\nThe patient’s friends sought a second opinion. A second surgeon managed the case conservatively, and the patient lost both eyes.\n\nOf course, true dislocation of the lens can occur, with trauma, Marfan syndrome, pseudoexfoliation, or other conditions. But this large number of spontaneous cases in Warren’s practice, and the specific clinical descriptions, suggest angle closure glaucoma.\n\nThe lectures of Philip Syng Physick, who was appointed to the medical staff of the Pennsylvania Hospital in 1794, noted, “Cataract . . . is produced by an opacity of the crystalline lens or its capsule. It is sometimes accompanied with pain over the eye . . .”98 Pain accompanying cataract can be due to angle closure glaucoma, chronic uveitis, and phacolytic or phacoanaphylactic glaucoma.\n\nUnder the heading “Tapping the Eye” (paracentesis), Physick’s nephew John Syng Dorsey recorded,\n\nDropsy of the eye, or hydrophthalmy, sometimes renders it necessary to evacuate the aqueous humour, accumulated in too great quantity . . . if the eye-ball continues to augment in volume, and protrude from the socket, it becomes necessary to open the eye by a surgical operation . . . In several cases I have punctured the cornea by inserting the point of a sharp cataract knife through it, the evacuation of the aqueous humour although not sudden, was amply sufficient.81\n\nThe cases with protrusion could be an anterior staphyloma or descemetocele which could have originated with an infection which weakened the cornea or cases of angle closure or other types of glaucoma which had been poorly treated.\n\nDorsey continued, “Dr. Physick from an idea that gutta serena is in some cases occasioned by pressure upon the retina and optic nerve from an over secretion of aqueous humour has punctured the eye with a view to relieve this affection.”81 The procedure had mixed results. The term “gutta serena” suggests that the paracentesis was performed for elevated intraocular pressure in a normal appearing eye.\n\nLacrimal fistula\n\nIn the era before antibiotics and effective surgery, dacryocystitis would frequently produce a lacrimal fistula. The condition could be chronic, or associated with cellulitis, and other severe complications. Available remedies were rudimentary ( ).99–100\n\nTable 2.\n\nYearSurgeon and disorder1771James Graham, an itinerant. Patient Daniel Turner of Newark acknowledged “the cure . . . of a fistula lacrymalis of my left eye . . .”831774Samuel Clossey, in New York, lectured on anatomy relevant to lacrimal fistulaFrancis Mercier, an itinerant. “Undertakes to cure . . .

Fistula lacrymalis”891795John Warren lectured on surgery for lacrimal fistula in Cambridge\n\nSome idea of the severe disability in this era comes from the 1663 letter of Abigale Montague of Hadley, Massachusetts to John Winthrop, the Younger (1606-1676), Governor of the Connecticut Colony. Montague’s 7-year-old daughter had “a thistilow [fistula] just by the corner of her eye by ye side of her nose.”101 (Fistula was sometimes written “thistolow.”)102 For the first year, she had “a clear watery rume [discharge], twickling out of her eye, and it was so hot that it would make the skin to come off.”101 Eventually, the discharge thickened, and the dacryocystitis occluded the eye: “it gathered betwixt her nose and her eye to a great swelling in so much that her eye was blinded up,” followed by facial cellulitis:\n\nall that side of face & head was so swelled & in great pain that we were afraid she would have died: & then it broke on the side of her nose by her eye & run a pretty deal.\n\nShe eventually developed “ye purples [purpura],” possibly from sepsis. They dressed the opening of the fistula and after they placed a sponge on the fistula, it bled. They placed water in the fistula and “ye water came out at her nose & run down her throat in so much that it had liked to have strangled her.” Her overall condition deteriorated: “She was formerly very full but now lean & poor . . .” They placed “bees wax & butter” on the fistula, but it “would not stick” so they had to secure a cloth over the opening. The girl did her best to cope: “She is naturally very lively although she undergoes a great deal of misery.” Her mother requested to know if “sisapharilla [sarsaparilla] root” or “English barley boiled with cole herbs be good for her.”101\n\nSarsaparilla indicates Aralia nudicaulis but has been occasionally used to describe other American plants.1 Some native tribes made a lotion of the root to treat sore eyes.1 It might seem odd that the mother would ask the colonial governor a medical question. However, Winthrop wrote 2 scientific articles and mentioned the “Bark of a Tree” in Nova Scotia and New England, with “a liquid matter like Turpentine . . . of a very sanative nature, as I am informed by those, who . . . have often tried it.”103\n\nAntoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz (1695-1775) of France recorded his life in the early 1720s near Fort Rosalie, in the Louisiana territory. He experienced a “fistula lacrymalis . . . which discharged an humour, when pressed . . .”104 The French surgeon M St. Hilaire, who had practiced for a dozen years at the Hôtel Dieu at Paris, recommended cautery (“use the fire for it”) before the nasal bone “would become carious.”104 Before du Pratz could decide whether to have the operation, the Natchez leader (“Great Sun”) happened to see the swelling on the eye and sent a native healer. This physician pressed his “simples” (medicines) together in a ball, and placed the ball in water, in which du Pratz soaked his eye twice daily for 8 to 10 days ( ).38 The “fistula” resolved completely.104\n\nIn 1791, Peter Degravers advertised in Kingston, Jamaica, “Doctor Degravers is a safe operator for the Cataract and Fistula lacrymalis.”89 His 1788 treatise clarified that the term “fistula lacrymalis” was used in this period for any dacryocystitis (even those that had not yet developed a true fistula to the skin surface), whereas those with a true fistula were described as “a complete fistula lacrymalis.”95 For simple cases of dacryocystitis, Degravers recommended nasolacrimal massage (“press on the bag”) and irrigation (“make several luke-warm injections through one of the lachrymal points”).95 Second, Degravers mentioned the “silver probe” of Anel, which was introduced through the “superior lacrymal point” (upper canaliculus) into the nose.95 When learning to find the probe entering the nose, he advised the operator “to begin on dead bodies.”95 He also described passing the probe into the nose, through the “inferior orifice of the ductus ad nasum” (the valve of Hasner) and into the lacrimal sac.95 When probing and injections fail, the next step is “opening the bag by an incision.”95\n\nAt Harvard University, a student of (the elder) John Warren recorded in 1794 that\n\nThe operation for the fistula lachrymalis is performed upon the os unguis, this being a bone no thicker than a wafer—Often the instrument has passed a bougie [a flexible surgical probe] inserted for 6 or 8 weeks which prevents the bone from closing & filling up the aperture.105\n\nThis language is similar to that of English surgeon Samuel Sharp.106\n\nOrbital pathology and enucleation\n\nSome orbital masses were treated surgically in the New World ( ).81 After his return to England in October 1776, surgeon Frederick William Jericho advertised several cases of orbital pathology he treated in the Caribbean. Given the times we know Jericho to be in Europe, these treatments would have been performed between 1771 and 1776. This is the first surgical enucleation identified in the New World ( ):\n\n. . . Robert Dyett, Esq; of Montserrat, who had an Aneurism in his right eye, which extended the globe to such a degree, that he was in convulsions and the most excrutiating pain day and night . . . Doctor Jericho, who took out the whole globe of the eye, and in three weeks time made a perfect cure of him . . . .107\n\nIn another case, Jericho’s method of cure is unknown:\n\n. . . in the Island of Antigua, he performed a very surprising cure on a Lady of a fungus cancer, which had afflicted the right side of her nose and eye-lids; the disorder had been of ten years standing; she had been under the care of many of the faculty, without receiving any benefit, and was thought incurable . . . .107\n\nIn 1787, a “Doctor Stoddard” resected a congenital “incysted tumour called . . . an atheroma, from the matter contained in the cystis, or bag, resembling and being of the consistence of a soft pudding.”100 The mass was “cut out of his [the patient’s] forehead, right eye-brow and lid” and was “covering the orb of the eye and part of the temporal artery, both of which he [Stoddard] avoided cutting, though the adhesion was considerable.”100 The description is consistent with a dermoid cyst. The 41-year-old patient, John Brassee, of Livingston, New York, had refrained “from having it extirpated from a belief that it would be attended with sudden death.”100\n\nGutta serena\n\nBefore the invention of the ophthalmoscope in 1850, many posterior segment conditions resulted in loss of vision which did not respond to couching and in which the eyes appeared normal. These conditions would include primary open angle glaucoma, macular diseases, retinal detachment, retinal vascular diseases, optic neuritis, etc, and were sometimes known by the Greek terms amaurosis, if severe, or amblyopia, if mild.33,57 However, in the English colonies, the Latin term gutta serena seemed to prevail through the 18th century.\n\nSloane recounted that “Henry, a Negro, Overseer . . . much given to Venery [sex]” developed poor vision at near and far. His eyes appeared normal. Sloane recommended he be “very Chast” and “cup’d and scarified in the Shoulders, blister’d in the Neck.” He also prescribed millipedes by mouth. Eventually, the Overseer recovered his sight.24\n\nFollowing a “belly ache,” another overseer became “usually blind.” Sloane treated by bleeding, purging, and blistering “to remove the Obstruction of the Optic nerve . . . his Eyes having no outward visible Disease.”24\n\nOne 55-year-old man with jaundice, belly pain, and mental status changes “lost his Sight quite . . . although his Eyes look’d well and without blemish, for which I order’d him to be bled. I blister’d him in the Neck likewise . . .” Sloane noted that “This sort of Gutta Serena goes off in some Days, and they recover their Sight . . .”24\n\nIn areas where couching of cataracts was unavailable, whether one believed a case could be cured by couching was unimportant, and the decision to label a case “gutta serena” was not critical. Therefore, before couching entered the mainland colonies, “gutta serena” was sometimes used simply to mean poor eyesight. In the 1750s, the Pennsylvania Hospital reported cases in which both “Eyes disordered” and “Gutta Serena” were cured.108\n\nJames Graham understood that gutta serena was classically viewed as incurable, but he claimed to be able to cure it. Patient Theophilus Pierson of Newark testified,\n\nafter being afflicted with a severe and constant headach, and almost total blindness (my case being the gutta serena) above six years, I have . . . recovered my sight, and am perfectly cured of my headach, thro’ the means that Dr. Graham has applied . . . .83\n\nEye trauma\n\nThe penalty for causing eye injury in the American colonies depended on the status of the injured party. The Massachusetts law of 1672 specified that “if any man smite out the Eye or Tooth of his Man-servant or Maid-servant . . . he shall let them go free from his service . . .”109 In 1718, Pennsylvania law stipulated that anyone who “put out an Eye . . . of any of the King’s Subjects” with malice and premeditation “shall suffer Death.”110 In 1742, South Carolina law stipulated that if one “put out the Eye . . . or deprive any Slave of any Limb,” the slaveholder must “forfeit the Sum of One Hundred Pounds.”111\n\nBarham, the English settler in Jamaica, recorded the story of\n\ncaptain Pickering . . . had a stick with fire at the end of it darted at him, which happened to come just under the brow of his eye, and seemed to turn his eye out . . . an old negro man . . . took of this herb that hath the bluish or purple flower, and washed it, reduced the eye as well as he could to its place, and then laid on the bruised herbe, bound it up . . .\n\nThe next day, a surgeon “found it healed up to admiration.”28 The herb was known as Prunella, Alheal, or Pickering’s herb.24,28,62\n\nIn 1744, physician Cadwallader Colden of New York wrote about witch hazel (Hamamelis virginiana):\n\nI learned of the use of the Hamamelis from a Minister of the Church of England who officiates among the Mohawk Indians. He saw an almost total blindness occasioned by a blow cured by receiving the Warm Steam of a Decoction of the Bark of this Shrub through a Funnel upon this place. This was done by direction of a Mohawk Indian after other means had for a considerable time proved ineffectual. I have since experienced the benefit of it used in the same manner in an Inflammation of the eye from a blow.1\n\nMany soldiers injured or lost an eye during the American wars of the 18th century, including the Seven Years’ War, known in America as the French and Indian War (1756-1763). Thomas Webb (1725-1796) of England served British General James Wolfe as a young lieutenant on July 31, 1759 at the Battle of Montmorency, near the city of Quebec.112 Webb saw a flash of light as a musket ball passed through one of his right orbital bones, “burst the eyeball,”112 and then passed through his palate, and was swallowed. Believing Webb was dead, his fellow soldier said, “He needs no help; he is dead enough.” Webb found the strength to reply “No, I am not dead.” After his recovery, Webb wore a green patch over his missing right eye. He became a Methodist clergyman and returned to England in 1778.112 When his remains were moved in 1972, his identity was confirmed by the green eye patch.112\n\nDuring the American Revolution, officers known to lose an eye included Simeon Thayer and John Lamb. However, we have not found evidence that local surgeons were developing innovative treatments for eye trauma during this period. For instance, we are unaware of any American surgeons of this period suturing ruptured globes.\n\nSympathetic ophthalmia\n\nThe understanding that injury to one eye can later result in inflammation in the other eye is said to date from antiquity.113 We see this understanding reflected in the writings of early New World physicians.\n\nOn the Madeira Islands (on his journey to Jamaica), Sloane, the English physician, examined a 35- or 40-year-old clergyman who had been shot with “small Shot, which lighted about his Temples.” The patient subsequently lost vision completely in one eye, which had “a Cataract (which I saw) grown in it. The other Eye (which is usual, when one is hurt) decaying so much that he could scarce see any thing with it.” Sloane understood that eye trauma could cause contralateral loss of vision. Sloane postulated that the shot “in all likelihood had weakened the Eye, made a small breach or (lying near it) Compression of the Optick Nerve.” Sloane treated by bleeding and with millipedes, and “white vitriol water, outwardly dropt on the Eye, to eat away the Films as much as might be.”24\n\nIn 1778, John Jay, an attorney (and, later, the first Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court), described an ophthalmic case of James Jay, his physician brother:\n\nAbout five years ago [in 1773], a blind Frenchman, who had been maintained several years by the parish of Rye [New York], was brought to my brother. He had lost one eye fourteen, and the other five or six years. The sight of both eyes was equally opaque, and both equally useless. My brother chose to operate only on one at a time . . . He opened the one which had been blind fourteen years. The man recovered the sight of that eye, and requested the like operation on the other, but my brother declined it, on account of the connection, or sympathy, which he said subsisted between the two.114\n\nThe phrase “opened the eye” sounds like extraction, but was not typically used to specify extraction, and was often used to describe improving literal or figurative vision. As the attorney does not describe delivery of the lens, we suspect that this was a lay description of couching.\n\nHall Jackson of New Hampshire, who performed couching, wrote in a 1791 letter that he would not operate if either eye had vision, “but when wholly blind, nothing can be feared. The inflammation that sometimes happens after the operation in a diseased eye, might so effect the one not diseased as to deprive it of sight.”58\n\nIn May 1801, Peter Foissin, a student of “Physic” in Charleston wrote of a 25-year-old “negro man” who received a traumatic cataract in the right eye after “a blow with a whip.”115 The left eye “became affected with amaurosis, to the utter extinction of sight.” Foissin attributed the contralateral vision loss “Either from sympathy, effusion, or the excessive action of the rays of light.”115 Foissin wrote that the patient had an increase in “his venereal appetite” so that 3 women did not satisfy him.115 Also, the patient could sense objects near his body without touching them and had such a sharpening of his mental faculties that without sight he could now navigate the city and accomplish all his tasks well.\n\nThus, physicians in early America knew that trauma (or surgery) to one eye could cause contralateral vision loss, and from the cases of Jay and Foissin, we see that this process was sometimes described as “sympathy.”\n\nArtificial (prosthetic) eyes\n\nA handful of practitioners advertised prosthetic eyes in the American colonies ( ).116 –120 Naturally, those interested in beauty and aesthetics, such as surgeon James Graham, would be inclined to offer artificial eyes. The first advertisement after the Revolution came in 1790, in Charleston, from “Mons. De La Volatile . . . His artificial eyes are of a very beautiful assortment, brilliant black, languishing blue . . . with or without eyebrows.”118 De La Volatile also offered “bosoms of the most lovely constructions, with other inviting prominencies after nature, by which additions elderly ladies may pass for belles of five and twenty.”118\n\nTable 3.\n\nYearOculist name and comment1738“. . . artificial Eyes . . .

Surgeon, Dentist, and Oculist,” claimed to be “the only operator in America that substitutes or sets Artificial Eyes.”119 He practiced in Philadelphia (1788), New York (1791-1795), Hartford (1795), Springfield (1806)1792Raymond Frederick: New York and Baltimore. “puts in artificial eyes resembling the natural, and which give no pain nor lay the patients under any constraint”120\n\nRichard Cortlandt Skinner (d. 1834) trained in dentistry in London under Bartholomew Ruspini. After arriving in Philadelphia in 1788, Skinner asked Benjamin Franklin for a $20 loan to help get established.121 In 1791, he advertised in New York “Skinner, Surgeon-Dentist . . . Mr. Skinner substitutes artificial eyes in such a curious manner as to hide the deformity occasioned by the loss of an eye.”122 He charged 3 guineas to fit an artificial eye.123 In 1806, he wrote “Dr. Skinner . . . sets artificial Eyes . . . he will gratify curiosity by setting one in an orbit of his own Cranium or head” and claimed to have “the recommendations of several of the professors of the Columbia College.”124 Skinner’s work “A Treatise on the Human Teeth” is said to be the earliest American work on dentistry.123,125\n\nAlbinism\n\nA case of oculocutaneous albinism from America was presented in England: “In 1744, the child of a Negroe and a Negress about 5 years old, and born in Macondi in America, was brought before the academy.” The child\n\nwas perfectly white, with all the features of a black, all to his wooly hair and eye-brows, which were white: his eyes likewise constantly rolled in their sockets, and by exposing them to the light in a certain manner, the pupil appeared of a bright red, as did the choroides . . . he is weak-sighted . . . .126\n\nCataract couching\n\nIn North Carolina, it was reported of alligators that “The Gall [bile] is of excellent use in taking away the Cataract and Web growing in the eyes.”127 The earliest advertisement for cataract treatment in the English colonies was the 1754 notice of Margaret Powell of New York, who “undertakes the Cure of all Rhumatic Pains . . . and Cataracts of the Eyes . . .”128 We suspect that the treatment was nonsurgical. This advertisement is consistent with the prominent role of women oculists noted in the 17th and early 18th centuries in England.65\n\nIn Mexico City, cataract couching was practiced as early as 1611 by Francisco Drago.4 We covered early cataract surgery in Latin America in a previous review.4 In the English-speaking colonies, surgeon John Morphy performed a couching on Montserrat in 1751 ( ).3,87 -89,129 -133 Because the operation caused the patient “anguish,” he ran through the streets, and the cataract rose again. When the cataract spontaneously fell back into the vitreous a year later, the patient could finally see.3\n\nTable 4.\n\nYearsName: comment1751John Morphy: Montserrat1760–1764William Stork, Jamaica: Annapolis, Philadelphia, New York, Boston1770–1774James Graham: Williamsburg, Annapolis, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York.1770–1781Anthony Yeldall: Philadelphia, New York.1771–1791Frederick William Jericho: Extraction.

Died 1801\n\nThe method of couching was described in the lecture notes of John Warren’s student at Harvard University in 1794:\n\nCouching . . . by passing the instruments into the sclerotica about 1/6 part of an inch behind the cornea, and then looking for the point of the needle till it is observed immediately above the lens. The needle is then to be turned on its flat side downwards, and the lens to be depressed till it does not rise. The instrument then is to be withdrawn in the same manner as it was introduced—The wound then to be dressed superficially.105\n\nPlacing the couching needle 1/6 in (4.2 mm) posterior to the limbus results in pars plana entry.181 As the needle is observed just anterior to the lens, rather than the iris, the needle passed posterior to the iris. Thus, the general approach to couching had not changed since described by Celsus in the first century.181\n\nThe American Revolution from 1776 to 1783 was associated with a reduction in the number of eye surgeons and oculists in the colonies ( ). Even at the turn of the 19th century, only about one-third of the surgeons performed cataract extraction, as opposed to couching ( ).\n\nCataract extraction\n\nCataract extraction, especially of soft cataracts, had been occasionally performed since antiquity.182 In the early 1700s, John Thomas Woolhouse, Charles de Saint-Yves, and others, extracted lenses which accidentally subluxed into the anterior chamber during couching.183 But the popularization of planned cataract extraction in the modern era began with the presentation of Jacques Daviel in Paris in 1752.3\n\nAmerican physicians first learned of cataract extraction from books. In July 1766, the New Jersey Medical Society established a fee schedule (adopted formally in 1784) which set the price for “Couching or extracting the cataract [£3] . . . Cutting the Iris [£3] . . . Fistula Lachrymalis [£1, 10s].”184 The language of the entire fee schedule, including the order of the operations and the spelling, was taken from the 1761 surgical text of Samuel Sharp, from Guy’s Hospital in London.106 We doubt that American surgeons were actually performing cataract extraction or iridectomy in 1766.\n\nTen surgeons who performed cataract extraction were identified by 1801 ( to , ).81 The earliest identified surgeon to perform cataract extraction in the New World was Frederick William Jericho of Germany, who trained in Holland.3 Based on the record in Europe, it appears that his initial cataract surgeries in the Caribbean must have been between 1771 and 1776. On his return to England in 1776, Jericho provided recommendations from Antigua, St. Kitts, and Montserrat86,107 and noted,\n\nHe also performed the operation of the Cataract on a negro girl; who immediately after could distinguish objects clearly, and in a fortnight’s time able to go abroad and about her business . . . He also cured a Mulatto girl, who had long lost the use of both her hands, and was totally deprived of eye-sight, to both of which she was restored, and is now able to do the finest needlework. He has restored several in the Island of Antigua to their Sight by the operation of the cataract . . . .107\n\nThe incision pioneered by Jacques Daviel for cataract extraction involved a small inferior incision with a knife, followed by extension of the incision with right and left curved scissors. Others made the incision with a single knife which made entry and exit corneal incisions near the limbus, which were then connected by moving the knife. In the Americas, this type of incision was used by Jericho,3 Degravers,95 and John Warren at Harvard. In 1794, Warren’s student recorded the method of cataract extraction:\n\nAs by passing a sharp edged instrument into the cornea about 1/12 of an inch from its edge and out at the opposite side. The edge of the instrument is then passed obliquely downwards & outwards cutting thro’ the cornea which is left suspended like a flap—the lens is the pressed out thro’ the pupil.105\n\nAs Warren had no technique to evacuate the lens other than simple pressure, it is not surprising that he would have had poor outcomes with extraction and would have favored couching. Warren’s student recorded,\n\nThe former of these [i.e. couching, as opposed to extraction] is to be preferred on various accounts—The violence done to the pupil in forcing out the lens often injures it irreparably—and the cicatrix made by the latter is much greater and more injurious than that occasioned by the former. In both cases the dressings should be wet with aqua vegeto mineralis [lead subacetate solution] & the light excluded.105\n\nJericho noted that after the incision, muscular contraction might spontaneously cause lens expulsion.3 But if the lens was not expelled, Jericho had strategies beyond simple application of pressure. He elevated the cornea and performed a form of capsulorhexis:\n\n. . . the incised part of the cornea should be raised up by a surgeon’s needle, and when brought forth through the aperture and pupil, the capsule in which the lens is enclosed should be scraped or perforated; although it is much better to use a needle or a thin and sharp instrument ending in a point, which at its end is blunt on either side.185\n\nIf the lens breaks up, it is removed with a spoon, and posterior synechiae are carefully dissected:\n\nSometimes it happens that the lens leaves the eye in pieces . . . the surgeon will try to remove the remaining part of the lens from the eye with the thinnest of spoons, which does not always succeed, especially if the lens has coalesced in some part with the posterior surface of the uvea; when this happens the fragments should be carefully freed from their binds by seizing them with a small set of forceps and using the thinnest pair of scissors.185\n\nSimilar to Jericho, Degravers performed a form of capsulorhexis: using a “kystitome,” the operator “incises inferiorly, transversally, and at one cut, the capsule of the crystalline.”95\n\nPhilip Syng Physick, at the Pennsylvania Hospital from 1794 onward, performed extraction by placing the knife “1/12 of an inch within the sclerotica . . . and bring it out upon the opposite [side] of the cornea.”98 Then, he incised the anterior capsule: “. . . the needle is introduced and the capsule torn as much as possible” before expulsion of the lens.98 Physick’s teachings on eye surgery were recorded in Elements of Surgery, written by his nephew, John Syng Dorsey, published in 1813.98\n\nDatura stramonium\n\nDatura species native to Mexico fall within the family of nightshade plants which dilate the pupil. The mydriatic properties of the European counterpart, Atropa belladonna, had been known for centuries, but belladonna extracts were not widely used in European ophthalmology before the 19th century. Aztec healers used Datura species for a number of medical conditions and in divination rituals because in high doses they induce hallucinations.186 In 1676, native Datura stramonium, “which resembles the Thorny Apple of Peru” was consumed in a “boil’d Salad” by British soldiers who were attempting to suppress Bacon’s rebellion in Virginia.187 The soldiers were incapacitated for 11 days. The anecdote gave the plant its colloquial name “James-Town Weed”187 or jimsonweed.\n\nIn April 1801, Samuel Brown, a doctor in Lexington, Kentucky, treated a 2-year-old girl who behaved strangely, fell to the floor as if paralyzed, and developed fever, delirium, and “scarlet efflorescence over the whole body.”188 She alternated between weeping, screaming, laughter, and incoherence. The pupils were dilated, with “a remarkable squinting of the right eye, which, however, was not constant.”188 This observation probably reflects an intermittent esotropia, as partial cycloplegia induced excessive efforts at accommodation and therefore convergence. The doctor induced vomiting, which produced seeds of “the stramonium.” Over the next few days, he prescribed “rhubarb and pot-ash.” The child recovered. Brown proposed that poisoning with stramonium was probably common. He also asked “Would not the topical application of the stramonium, by its power of dilating the pupil, facilitate the extraction of the cataract?”188 Dilation with belladonna was just being introduced in Europe. It appears that this frontier American doctor thought of the idea independently.\n\nSurgical charges\n\nIn the available fee schedules, we see no price differential between cataract couching and extraction, even though the latter required more skill and training ( ).189 –191 Several surgeons offered a reduced fee when the surgery failed.\n\nTable 9.\n\nYearSurgeon(s)SurgeryPrice1766New Jersey Medical Society189“Couching or extracting the cataract”£3“Fistula Lachrymalis”£1, 10sCutting the Iris£31799William Baynham: Essex, Virginia92Unsuccessful surgery for “tumor in the left Eye . . . film in the right”$51800Nathan Smith: Cornish“extracting a tumor near an eye”$5“extracting an eye”$221801Charles F Bartlett: Newport“for extracting or couching the cataract”190$50Mason Fitch Cogswell: HartfordUnsuccessful operation for cataract.

The aim is not to present every surgeon’s biography exhaustively. Rather, we present the materials not previously highlighted or reported to our knowledge. Also, the early development of ophthalmology at academic institutions is presented.\n\nEarly American physicians, from 1687\n\nHans Sloane (1660-1753) of England practiced as a young physician on Jamaica in 1687 ( ).192 Sloane merged his own medical and scientific observations with those of previous naturalists, such as Francisco Hernández de Toledo. Although Jamaica was claimed by Spain after its exploration by Columbus in 1494, the British captured the island in 1655. Sloane reported that the Spanish abandoned the northern side of the island because in this region “Ants are said to have killed the Spanish Children by eating their Eyes when they were left in their Cradles . . .”24\n\nSloane recounted the histories of many ophthalmic patients on Jamaica.24 He had been told that the diseases and treatments would be substantially different in the New World. However, he soon found that his European medicines and cures were quite effective. Moreover, the patients had faith in his methods, complied well with treatment, and refrained from “judging harshly in case the Person died.”24\n\nTrader James Adair lived with the Natchez, the Chickasaw, and other native tribes between 1735 and 1750. Adair wrote of one interaction:\n\nFormerly, an old Nachee [Natchez] warrior who was blind of one eye, and very dim-sighted in the other, having heard of the surprising skill of the European oculists, fancied I could cure him . . . I had just drank a glass of rum when he came to undergo the operation. . . he observing my glass, said, it was best to defer it till the next day.—I told him I drank so on purpose.193\n\nAdair also gave the patient “several drinks of grogg.”193 Then, Adair\n\napplied my materia medica, blowing a quill full of fine burnt alum and Roman vitriol into his eye. Just as I was ready to repeat it, he bounded up out of his seemingly dead state, jumped about, and said, my songs and physic were not good.193\n\nBenjamin Franklin and the Pennsylvania Hospital in 1751\n\nAs with so much of early American life, ophthalmology was influenced by the leadership of Benjamin Franklin. Early settlers had to receive spectacles imported from England. Franklin’s Pennsylvania Gazette carried advertisements for these spectacles. Among the earliest to advertise spectacles was Franklin himself in 1738.194\n\nAvoidance of indoor smoke was one of the advantages claimed by Franklin for his stove or “Pennsylvanian Fire-Places.”195 Franklin noted, “Great and bright Fires do also very much contribute to damage the Eyes . . .”195 He also noted, “This Fire-place cures most smoaky Chimneys, and thereby preserves both the Eyes and Furniture.”195\n\nOne of Franklin’s greatest accomplishments was proving that lightning was electricity ( ).196 This realization allowed him to invent the lightning rod. Franklin noted, “Before I leave this Subject of Lightning, I may mention some other Similarities between the Effects of that and those of Electricity. Lightning has often been known to strike People blind.”197 Indeed, lightning strike can produce vision loss from cataract, optic neuropathy, or central nervous system injury.198 Franklin continued by describing his experiments affecting several animals “by the Electrical Shock.” He noted, “a Pullet [hen] struck dead in like Manner, being recover’d by repeated blowing into it’s Lungs . . . on Examination appear’d perfectly blind.”197 It seems that Franklin performed successful mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on a hen.\n\nIn 1752, Benjamin Franklin argued to physician Cadwallader Colden that light was a wave, rather than a particle, that proceeds to the eye:\n\nMay not all the Phaenomena of Light be more conveniently solved, by supposing Universal Space filled with a subtle elastic Fluid, which when at rest is not visible, but whose Vibrations affect that fine Sense the Eye . . . ? . . . why must we believe that luminous Particles leave the Sun and proceed to the Eye?199\n\nColden replied that as pointed out in “Sir Isaac Newton’s optics,” a particle theory could better explain how an opaque object obstructs the passage of light to the eye.200\n\nA petition presented to the Assembly of Pennsylvania in January 1750-1751 called for the establishment of a hospital, which led to the Pennsylvania Hospital.189 The petition was written by Franklin, although he was not a signatory.189 The petition noted the need to help those “deprived of Sight by Cataracts.”189 The result of these efforts was the establishment of the Pennsylvania Hospital, the first in the English colonies, in 1751 ( ).201 Franklin and physician Thomas Bond (1712-1784) are considered the hospital founders.201 As the hospital reports from the 1750s mention “Eyes disordered,” “Gutta serena,” and ophthalmia, but not cataract,108 it is not clear that the hospital was initially able to deliver on the promise made to the legislature.\n\nIn 1749, Franklin had helped to found the Academy of Philadelphia, later known as the College of Philadelphia, a predecessor of the University of Pennsylvania. This institution began offering medical training in the 1760s. The first professor of surgery was William Shippen, Jr (1736-1808, ).202 Shippen had first studied with his physician father and then traveled to Europe for additional training. While in London, the younger Shippen recorded in his diary on August 25, 1759 “. . . saw Mr. Way and Paul couch 2 men in old way by depression.”203 Lewis Way was the surgeon to Guy’s Hospital, and Joseph Paul was the surgeon to St. Thomas’ Hospital.203 Shippen watched John Hunter “extract a Steatomatous Tumor from [the] upper eyelid.”203 Shippen also read Percival Pott’s treatise on the Fistula Lachrymalis.203 On his return to Philadelphia, Shippen began offering private medical lectures in 1762. Notes from a student of Shippen’s 1766 lectures do not relate to anatomy or surgery of the eye, but the notes might be incomplete.204\n\n“Doctor [William] Shippen” was listed as the “Professor of Anatomy and Surgery” on the notice of the first medical graduation ceremonies of the College of Philadelphia on June 21, 1768.205 The notice began “This day . . . may be considered as having given birth to Medical Honours in America.”205 Ten students who had attended lectures at the Pennsylvania Hospital were awarded the “degree of Bachelor of Physick.”205 The ceremonies featured “A dispute, whether the Retina, or Tunica Choroides be the immediate seat of Vision.” One student correctly argued that the retina received the image, but another argued\n\nthat the Retina is incapable of the office ascribed to it, on account of its being easily permeable by the rays of light: and that the Choroid-coat, by its being opake, is the proper part for stopping the rays and receiving the picture of the object.205\n\nIn 1777, Shippen was appointed the Director of Hospitals for the Continental Army. In 1779, he ordered equipment including “1 case of couching instruments” from the apothecary general, Dr Andrew Craigee.150 A dispute ensued about whether these were for the use of the Army or him personally.150 Shippen was court-martialed for mismanagement but was narrowly acquitted.\n\nFranklin spent much of the prerevolutionary period in England on political assignments. At the end of 1776, he moved to Paris as the American ambassador to France. He mentioned his invention of “double spectacles” (bifocals) while in Paris in 1784206 and returned to America the next year.\n\nOculists from Europe (1761-1783)\n\nIn the colonial period, trained oculists migrated from Europe to the American colonies. One early cataract coucher was William Stork, who was the oculist to Augusta, the Princess of Wales from 1751 to 1754.3,207,208 After practicing in Yorkshire for several years,209 Stork advertised his services as an oculist in Kingston, Jamaica in 1760.3,210 In his later editing of Bartram’s botanical guide appended to his own journal, Stork cited Sloane’s work on Jamaica.211 Thus, Stork might have been inspired to follow Sloane’s example as an oculist on that island and would have been familiar with the ocular ailments and treatments described by Sloane. Stork arrived in Philadelphia in 1761 and then practiced in cities between Annapolis and Boston until 1764.3,212 Stork then promoted the settlement of Florida.3 The William Stork of Florida was indeed the “oculist.”213,214 Stork died there in 1768.3,213\n\nJames Graham (1745-1794) was another prominent European eye surgeon in colonial America ( ).215 Graham matriculated at the University of Edinburgh in 1761,216 where anatomy and surgery were taught by Alexander Monro, junior and senior.216 By the time Graham married in 1764, he had established an apothecary shop in Doncaster, England.216 Later in the 1760s, Graham spent time in the hospitals of Dublin and London.216\n\nGraham traveled to America, arriving at the end of the summer of 1769.216 In January 1770, he advertised a “Lecture on the Eye” in Annapolis.216 By August 1770, he was advertising treatment of disorders of the eyes and ears and of “female complaints” in New York.216,217\n\nIn May 1771, he “cured” 173 patients with “blindness, deafness, and female complaints” in Elizabethtown, New Jersey.218 It may seem unusual that a professed oculist and aurist would also attend to female complaints, but, as we will see, on his eventual return to England, Graham specialized in helping couples attain sexual pleasure and fertility. Hints of his subsequent career path can be found during his North American stay.\n\nAt the end of the summer of 1771, a theatrical competitor named Anthony Yeldall was attracting a great deal of attention in New York (see below). Perhaps for that reason, Graham relocated to Philadelphia in the fall219 and published testimonials of patients successfully treated for “fistula lachrymalis,” “gutta serena,” and “a film over his right eye” from smallpox.83 In April 1772, Graham published his first testimonial from a patient he couched, Mrs Mary Rivel, who had been “blind of both eyes for two years.”220,221 He next published the testimonial of a man “blind of both eyes with a confirmed Gutta Serena” who was now able to read.222 Given his interest in beauty, it is unsurprising he would fit prosthetic eyes:\n\nThose persons whose eyes are utterly perished, or sunk in their head, may have the deformity removed by artificial eyes, so curiously fixed and adapted to the orbits, as to have in appearance the beauties, motion, &c. of the natural eye in its healthy state.117\n\nAfter Graham’s departure, prosthetic eyes were not advertised again until 1790 ( ).\n\nGraham’s next advertisement noted that “. . . seven [of his patients] had lost their Sight by Beards of Rye, and other Grain, getting into their Eyes in Time of Harvest, of these, three only have perfectly recovered.”223 The report also mentioned 2 patients he couched: “. . . a Gentleman advanced in Years was couched in one Eye, but the Operation proved ineffectual.”223 He also couched the “Son of Mr. Thomas Walling . . . aged Eleven, and who, for upwards of three Years, had been totally blind of both Eyes, was instantly restored to the sight of both.”223\n\nAt the end of the summer of 1772, Graham announced that he was going to return to England in 1773, but that for a fee, he would instruct one student “regularly bred to the profession of physic or surgery” as an oculist and aurist.224 He treated “. . . squinting . . . blows or extraneous substances. . . tumours and excressences. . .”224 Graham announced visits to Lancaster, York, and Reading.225\n\nHe also announced a lecture on the eye at “the Doctor’s apartments” and invited the public as well as “the faculty” to attend.225 The lecture enjoyed some success because he was able to present it at “the College Hall” of the College of Philadelphia, however, it is not clear that the college endorsed or sponsored his talk.226 The lecture had 3 parts with “A Concert of Musick” during the intermissions.226 The first part consisted of anatomy, physiology, the pathway of light through the “Coats and humours of the Eye,” with “Refraction and reflection of the rays.”226 Graham addressed the “students in medicine and surgery” noting the “College of Philadelphia in the general field of literature, considered as equaling, and in the liberal profession of medicine as far surpassing, any other on the British continent of America.”226 The second part described the causes and cure of diseases such as “Cataract—Glaucoma—Gutta Serena—Inflammations . . . Films. . . Squinting . . . Short-sightedness—useful directions concerning spectacles . . .”226 Consistent with his ultimate career pathway, Graham provided an “Address to the ladies on the art of managing the eye . . . Beauty of a fine woman composed of numberless lesser beauties, of which the Eye is the chief.”226 This section seems to be a course on flirtatious glances and putting makeup on the eye. The third part of Graham’s lecture was about the “dignity and importance of physic and surgery” and noted “. . . the pleasures of the eye as being more refined or spiritual” than those of the other senses.226\n\nIn the Spring of 1773, he took a quick trip to Annapolis and Williamsburg.227 In Williamsburg, on May 5, 1773, a young legislator named Thomas Jefferson purchased “a ticket to Graham’s lecture on the eye.”228 Jefferson’s interest was probably intellectual rather than personal. He seemed to suffer little in the way of ophthalmic complaints. He did write in 1763 that “. . . the loss of the whites of my eyes, in the room of which I have got reds, which give me such exquisite pain that I have not attempted to read any thing . . .” and continued “[My] eyes still continue [as red a]s ever, and if they were to begin to mend now . . .”229 Not until 1789, did he need to purchase a “set of reading glasses.”230 In 1798, Jefferson wrote about “. . . a small cold which brought on an inflammation in the eyes . . .”231\n\nThe newspapers recorded that\n\n. . . Mrs. Cobb of Williamsburg, aged sixty-six, who for several years had been totally blind with a Cataract in each Eye, was couched by Dr. Graham . . . and in less than five minutes was restored to the blessing of sight in both Eyes.232\n\nThe report called “Mrs. Cobb . . . the first patient on whom the Doctor has operated in a Cataract.”232 In fact, Mrs Cobb was at least the fourth, if the newspapers were to be believed, but perhaps the message is that Graham had not performed many couchings. In addition, “The first patient with a Gutta Serena (a diease hitherto deemed incurable) was Miss Peggy Hay . . . She too was happily restored . . .”232\n\nGraham then traveled to Philadelphia and then New York.227,232 Here, he delivered his l"
