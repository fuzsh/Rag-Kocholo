First appearing in the 1900s, flourishing during the interwar and postwar periods, ...\n\nBakeries and Bakers\n\nBaking, one of the earliest businesses in Philadelphia, did not become a major part of the local economy until the late nineteenth century. It remained a viable industry throughout the region’s history, however, ranging from small neighborhood bakeries to large baking companies with national product distribution. Philadelphia supported several commercial bakers from the beginning. A ...\n\nBank of North America\n\nChartered May 26, 1781, by the Continental Congress under the Articles of Confederation, this enterprise was the first national and truly commercial bank in the United States.

Operating from its Parthenon-style building on Chestnut Street between Fourth and Fifth Streets in Philadelphia, the bank served as a reliable depository for federal money and provided a sound ...\n\nBanking\n\nGreater Philadelphia’s banking roots go deeper than those of any region in the country. By the late twentieth century, however, historic regulatory changes led to acquisitions by out-of-town giants and changed the face of the banking industry both locally and ...\n\nBarbershops and Barbers\n\nThroughout much of its modern American history, barbering has been derided as “servile” work, unfit for native-born, white citizens. As such, the profession has been dominated by marginalized groups. In the Philadelphia region, African Americans owned and operated the majority of barber shops during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Since then, waves of immigrant ...\n\nBook Publishing and Publishers\n\nBetween 1750 and 1800, Philadelphia became the center for book printing and publishing in the United States, surpassing New York and Boston.

As early as the eighteenth century, booksellers set up shop in the city, eager to serve a highly-educated population hungry for ...\n\nBrickmaking and Brickmakers\n\nThe city of Philadelphia was built with bricks, giving it an appearance many neighborhoods retained into the twenty-first century. An abundance of local clay allowed brickmaking to flourish and bricks to become the one of the most important building materials in the region. Because it could be accomplished with just a few rudimentary tools, brickmaking ...\n\nBrownfields Redevelopment\n\nFirst designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1995, the polluted tracts of land known as “brownfields” resulted from Greater Philadelphia’s industrial heritage.

Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the company grew to become one of the largest food companies of the twenty-first ...\n\nCanals\n\nCanals transformed the economic and geographic scope of Greater Philadelphia in the first half of the nineteenth century.

While ...\n\nChemical Industry\n\nSince the eighteenth century, chemical or chemical processing industries have been an important part of the economy of Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley region and have reflected larger trends in the industry. The earliest chemical companies manufactured products such as sulfuric acid and white lead pigments for local consumption, while other manufacturers, such as tanners, ...\n\nChemistry\n\nPhiladelphians used chemistry to enhance manufacturing, household practice, and artisan trades, mixing scholarly with practical aims from the outset. Furthermore, chemistry’s relationship to other scientific disciplines, including botany, geology, and medicine, made Philadelphians particularly keen to promote and diffuse chemical knowledge. Encouraged by widespread interest in chemistry between ...\n\nChild Labor\n\nYoung people have worked as long as families’ expenses have exceeded adults’ incomes. In the Philadelphia region’s preindustrial, industrial, and postindustrial eras, children sought work for the needed earnings it brought them and employers sought children for the lower pay they commanded. But the nature of youthful occupations changed along with the economy, and so ...\n\nChina Trade\n\nFirst pursued by the city’s merchants after the American Revolution, the China trade linked Philadelphians to the rest of the world through commerce.

The City Merchant chronicles the ...\n\nClocks and Clockmakers\n\nClockmaking in colonial and early republican Philadelphia and its environs was considered an intellectual profession requiring great artisanal skill and scientific knowledge. Among rural communities surrounding the city, the mathematical precision and mechanical intricacy of the profession put it at a superior rank to the crafts of blacksmithing and carpentry. Clockmakers like David Rittenhouse ...\n\nCo-Working Spaces\n\nIn the 2000s and 2010s, nearly 30 co-working spaces opened in the Philadelphia area.

To mine anthracite, or “hard coal,” on ...\n\nCoffeehouses\n\nPhiladelphia’s first coffeehouse opened in 1703, and by mid-century half a dozen operated within the city limits. Their purpose, however, changed in important ways as the eighteenth century progressed. Early coffeehouses primarily served the needs of traders and mariners, acting as crucial centers of commerce. In the decades following the American Revolution, however, some coffeehouse ...\n\nCommercial Museum\n\nOpened to the public in 1897, the Commercial Museum was the foremost source of international trade knowledge for American manufacturers at the turn of the twentieth century.

The late nineteenth century saw the emergence of the “contractor boss”—a construction magnate who wielded political power directly ...\n\nConvention Centers\n\nPhiladelphia-area residents and visitors have required places for large assemblies since the colonial era, and a variety of temporary and permanent facilities served this purpose in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Modern, multipurpose convention centers appeared in the late 1920s and have since grown in size and scope. By the early twenty-first century, many of the region’s cities, ...\n\nCordwainers Trial of 1806\n\nShoemaking, one of the most lucrative trades in Philadelphia during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, also proved to be one of the most contentious. Dissension within the trade worsened in the last decade of the eighteenth century and climaxed with the Philadelphia Cordwainers (shoemakers) Trial of 1806. This trial proved to be not only ...\n\nDeindustrialization\n\nThe Philadelphia region’s long-held reputation as the “workshop of the world,” though richly deserved, did not prevent it from suffering the same loss of manufacturing firms and jobs that devastated the economies of other manufacturing centers. Local products ranged widely, from locomotives and ships to silk hosiery, wool carpets, machine tools, hand tools, lighting fixtures, ...\n\nDepartment Stores\n\nAs department stores became central to retailing in American cities in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Philadelphia played a major role. Led by John Wanamaker, whose store was a national model, the giant \"Big Six\" stores on Market Street helped create a new consumer ...\n\nDiners\n\nWith its origins in late-nineteenth-century street vending and transient “quick lunch” operations such as horse-drawn food carts, the diner emerged as one of the most popular and successful restaurant genres in the United States.

Despite ...\n\nFilms (Feature)\n\nPhiladelphia’s association with the film industry dates back to its beginning, when the city’s Lubin Manufacturing Company created and distributed many of the first generation of silent films. After Lubin's early collapse, Philadelphia served as a setting for telling urban stories that needed local color and a unique ...\n\nFlaxseed and Linen\n\nIn the colonial era linen and flaxseed were fundamental to the mercantile life of Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley.

By 1750 the Delaware Valley produced such a surplus that its wheat and flour not only supplied the American market but also were exported to Europe, Africa, and the ...\n\nFood Processing\n\nFor most of Philadelphia's history, food processing was an important industry, pioneering new products and employing tens of thousands of workers. Many well known national corporations got their start as small businesses in Philadelphia.

The industry went into decline within the ...\n\nGreater Philadelphia Movement\n\nThe reform wave that swept through City Hall in the mid-twentieth century owed much of its power to the Greater Philadelphia Movement (GPM), a volunteer group of corporate leaders who believed the city’s scandalous political corruption threatened its economic future.

During the latter ...\n\nManufacturing Suburbs\n\nAlthough early industrialization in the eighteenth century took root mainly in urban centers, a substantial share of the Philadelphia region’s early manufacturing sprang up in small towns outside the young city.
