        "text": "Philadelphia is a village near Newbottle within the metropolitan area of the City of Sunderland. It grew as a mining village and was named by a local colliery owner after Philadelphia in North America, when the city was captured by the British army during the American War of Independence.\n\nNote: there was also once a colliery and village named Philadelphia in Murton Township, near North Shields.\n\nPhiladelphia is a village in Tyne and Wear, England. It lies on the A182 road between Newbottle and Shiney Row.\n\nHistory\n\nUnlike nearby Washington, it post-dates its namesake in the United States, being named during the American Revolutionary War by a local colliery owner to commemorate the British capture of the city. The village cricket field is named \"Bunker Hill\", after another famous battle in that war.\n\nPhiladelphia was the place of the 1815 Philadelphia train accident, the explosion of the boiler of an early steam locomotive. The number of deaths (16, other sources state 13) was the highest in a railway accident until 1842.\n\nText from Wikipedia, available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License (accessed: 28/09/2017).\n\nVisit the page: Philadelphia, Tyne and Wear for references and further details.
