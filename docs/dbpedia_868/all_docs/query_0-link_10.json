As part of this course, you will study with a renowned theatre critic and make frequent theatre visits. London is one of the most exciting theatre centers in the world, and this course has a focus on live performance, providing an incomparable opportunity to learn about a wide range of dramatic forms, acting styles, theatrical conventions, and playing spaces. Students attend three performances each week, produced by companies such as the National Theatre, the Royal Court, and Shakespeare’s Globe. We will also see a diverse selection of pieces staged not only in the historic theatres of the West End, but also in smaller fringe theatres. Class meetings will include presentations on the theatres we visit, analysis of plays, and discussions about the productions we have seen. Readings for the class will include selected plays and contextual material to prepare us for theatre viewing; written work will consist of responses to performances. Field trips are likely to include a backstage tour of the National Theatre, and possibly a visit to the theatre collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0159 Gender and Society\n\nThis course will introduce students to the ways in which sex, gender, and sexuality mark our bodies, influence our perceptions of self and others, organize families and work like, delimit opportunities for individuals and groups of people, as well as impact the terms of local and transnational economic exchange. We will explore the ways in which sex, gender, and sexuality work with other markers of difference and social status such as race, age, nationality, and ability to further demarcate possibilities, freedoms, choices, and opportunities available to people.\n\nFall or Spring\n\nAlso Offered As: GSWS 0002\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0160 Introduction to Sexuality Studies and Queer Theory\n\nThis course will introduce students to the historical and intellectual forces that led to the emergence of queer theory as a distinct field, as well as to recent and ongoing debates about gender, sexuality, embodiment, race, privacy, global power, and social norms. We will begin by tracing queer theory's conceptual heritage and prehistory in psychoanalysis, deconstruction and poststructuralism, the history of sexuality, gay and lesbian studies, woman-of-color feminism, the feminist sex wars, and the AIDS crisis. We will then study the key terms and concepts of the foundational queer work of the 1990s and early 2000s. Finally, we will turn to the new questions and issues that queer theory has addressed in roughly the past decade. Students will write several short papers.\n\nFall\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 0030, ENGL 2303, GSWS 0003\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0200 Slow-Reading Shakespeare with Paul Robeson High School\n\nIn this ABCS (Academically Based Community Service) course, we will read a single Shakespeare play slowly and carefully, through multiple methodologies and approaches, over the course of the semester. Students will also work on the same play with 10th graders at Robeson High School under the direction of their award-winning teacher, Ms Tiaw. “Slow reading” means an intensely detailed, iterative reading of the play through linguistic, cultural-historical, bibliographic, and performative lenses. We will gain a detailed knowledge of this play, but in doing so, we will also learn about Shakespeare’s style, dramaturgy, and theatrical context. Penn students will thereby become well-prepared to work with Robeson students as they work through a scene, or a piece of dialogue, or character motivations. The course will be a success if, through this work in tandem and in parallel, everyone in the Penn classroom and the Robeson classroom—both students and teachers—gains a deeper understanding of the play and of the benefits of the slow, patient, detailed exploration of a text. No previous experience with Shakespeare or with teaching is required. What is required is a serious commitment to the work of the class, including showing up to all sessions both at Penn and at Robeson. (Sessions at Robeson will meet during the same Penn time block so everyone will be free. There may be one or two events arranged outside this time.) If for some emergency reason you will be unable to do the work on a given day, you must commit to notifying Ms Tiaw and me with as much advance notice as possible.\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0201 Voting Writes: An ABCS Course\n\nIn this ABCS (Academically Based Community Service) course, Penn students will work with twelfth graders to write and discuss literature about the history and present tense of voting in our country. During the first of our twice-weekly class sessions, we’ll meet on campus to plan the next lesson. In the following session, we’ll bring this lesson to a high school classroom in West Philly. Sessions at the high school will meet during the same Penn time block so everyone will be free. Each week we’ll use a different poem or short essay (like Reginald Dwayne Betts’s poem about voting for Obama in a Nat Turner T-Shirt, Chanda Feldman’s poem about voter suppression among sharecroppers, and John Lewis’s graphic novel MARCH) as the model for our own creative writing about what voting means to us and what it has meant to our families before us. We’ll also talk about voting policies and structures of government in order to reflect on them in poems and prose. Penn students will gain teaching experience, creative writing techniques, and close reading skills. No previous teaching nor writing experience is required.\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0300 Medieval Worlds\n\nIn this freshman seminar, we will read a variety of premodern texts that try to take the whole world into account. We will trace the geographical imaginations and cultural encounters of early writers across different genres, from maps, to Islamic, Jewish, and Christian travel narratives, such as the account of John de Mandeville (one of Christopher Columbus's favorite writers); to monstrous encyclopedias and books of beasts, such as the \"Wonders of the East\"; to universal chronicles and Alexander the Great romances. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of current offerings.\n\nFall or Spring\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0301 First Year Seminar--Emotions\n\nThe field known as “History of the Emotions” has gained tremendous prominence in literary and cultural studies. But do emotions have a history? If so, what methods do we use for discovering and recounting that history? To what extent does history of the emotions borrow from other fields? These include all the fields that relate to what we call “emotions studies”: psychology, sociology, political theory, philosophy, and neuroscience. In this seminar we will explore some key methodologies and subject matters for history of the emotions. We’ll look at some philosophical reflections on emotion (including Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics, as well as more recent moral philosophers); we’ll also look at political theorists, including Thomas Hobbes; we’ll explore psychoanalytic perspectives, historical research, and some of the work of neuroscientists; and we will take these ideas into explorations of art, literature, and music. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: CLST 0015\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0303 First Year Seminar: National Epics\n\nIn this course we will consider texts that become \"national epics,\" texts that in some sense come to \"represent\" a nation. How and when might such imaginative texts emerge? Nations change, and old poems may no longer serve. Can the Song of Roland, once compulsory study for all schoolchildren in France, still be required reading today-- especially if I am French Muslim? What about El Cid in Spain? How do some texts-- such as the Mahabharata in India, or Journey to the West in China-- seem more adaptable than others? The course begins in western Europe, but then pivots across Eurasian space to become gradually more global. Most all of us have complex family histories: Chinese-American, French Canadian, Latino/a/x, Jewish American, Pennsylvania Dutch, Lenni Lenape. Some students may choose to investigate, for their final project, family histories (and hence their own, personal connection to \"national epics\").\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 0303\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0304 First Year Seminar: Dangerous Literature\n\nThis first-year seminar explores literary works that were called or perceived dangerous, revealing a literary history of censorship, prohibition, and book burning—be it for moral, political, or religious reasons. By studying dangerous literature closely and transhistorically, students will acquire knowledge about the texts as well as historical, aesthetic, and philosophical contexts from which they emerged. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0310 Reading the City (First-Year Seminar)\n\nThis first-year seminar will consider how nineteenth-century literature helped transform the city into the symbolic nerve center of modern social life, and it will follow the changing shapes of urbanism across contexts and into the present. To make sense of these conflicting meanings, we will examine what versions of the city take shape in fiction, poetry, social theory, photography, film, and contemporary writing and media. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 0310\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0320 First Year Seminar: Black Queer Traditions\n\nThis first-year seminar provides a critical introduction to Black Queer literature, art, and politics.

It considers how shifting definitions of queerness, under different guises and different terms, have shaped our understanding of sexual and gender identity today. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings\n\nAlso Offered As: GSWS 0333\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0340 First Year Seminar: Scenes of Teaching\n\nThis course will consider the theory and practice of pedagogy in a range of texts and films.

See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0350 First Year Seminar: Climate Fiction\n\nThis course introduces students to recent works of climatological science-fiction (cli-fi). See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0365 Spiegel-Wilks First-Year Seminar\n\nThe primary goal of the first-year seminar program is to provide every first-year student the opportunity for a direct personal encounter with a faculty member in a small setting devoted to a significant intellectual endeavor. Specific topics are posted at the beginning of each academic year. This Spiegel-Wilks seminar focuses exclusively on contemporary art.\n\nFall or Spring\n\nAlso Offered As: ARTH 0501\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0370 First Year Seminar: Fiction and Connectivity\n\nThis First Year Seminar explores the ways in which long narratives, from ancient epic to 21st-century TV serials, have always engaged their audiences by providing a sense of connection among individuals, and by modeling the relationship between individuals and society. This seminar will zero-in on this aspect of storytelling’s cultural function. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0372 First Year Seminar: Juvenilia\n\nThis course explores the childhood and adolescent writings of some of English literature’s most notable figures. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0375 Lyric Poetry and Life Writing\n\nWhat kind of life writing is poetry? When we say that the raw expression of thought and feeling is not art, but a poem is, what do we mean? What is gained (and what lost) when writers give poetic form to experiences and emotions? In this seminar, we’ll investigate that question by reading a series of modern poets alongside other forms of life writing that they produced, including, for example, letters and diaries, autobiographies and memoirs, essays and fiction. We’ll start with some quick case studies on Wordsworth, Whitman, and Dickinson. For the remainder of the semester, we’ll work intensively on Elizabeth Bishop, Robert Lowell, Ted Hughes, Sylvia Plath, Philip Larkin, Robert Frost, Langston Hughes, Audre Lorde, Bob Dylan, and Claudia Rankine.\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0376 First Year Seminar: The Short Story Cycle\n\nThis First Year Seminar examines some of the greatest short-stories from the 19th and 20th centuries, with special attention to writing of the modern period, vivid with new experiences and alive with stylistic experimentation. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0380 First Year Seminar: Modern American Poetry\n\nThis First Year Seminar examines innovations in modern American poetry, exploring a range of poetic voices from the 20th and 21st centuries. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0391 First Year Seminar: Dark Academia\n\nThis First-Year seminar explores the phenomenon of the ‘dark academia’ online aesthetic. What are the origins of this way of romanticizing the act of studying and the experience of university? What do its signifiers mean, and why are they used? What cultural and political currents run underneath the surface of that #darkacademia post? This course invites you to interrogate the myth of the academy itself to see what it can tell us about class, race, sexuality, and power in the hallowed halls of higher education. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0401 First-Year Seminar: Creative Writing\n\nFirst-Year Seminars will afford entering students who are considering literary and creative writing study as their focus the opportunity to explore a particular and limited subject with a professor whose current work lies in that area.

In particular, we will study how Latin American and Latinx artists engage with notions of identity, nation, and geo-political and geo-cultural borders, asking how we might study \"national\" theatres in an age of transnational globalization. Our consideration of plays, performances, and theoretical texts will situate Latin American and Latinx theatre and performance within the context of its politics, culture, and history.\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 2086, LALS 2860, THAR 2860\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0500 Benjamin Franklin Seminar: Classicism and Literature\n\nThis advanced seminar will examine the classical backgrounds to English poetry, in particular the Biblical and Greco-Roman antecedents to Renaissance lyric verse and verse drama (such as, preeminently, Shakespeare).

How and when might such imaginative texts emerge? Nations change, and old poems may no longer serve. Can the Song of Roland, once compulsory study for all schoolchildren in France, still be required reading today — especially if I am French Muslim? What about El Cid in Spain? How do some texts — such as the Mahabharata in India, or Journey to the West in China — seem more adaptable than others? The course begins in western Europe, but then pivots across Eurasian space to become gradually more global. Most all of us have complex family histories: Chinese-American, French Canadian, Latino/a/x, Jewish American, Pennsylvania Dutch, Lenni Lenape. Some students may choose to investigate, for their final project, family histories (and hence their own, personal connection to “national epics”).

Psychoanalysis is often called \"the talking cure\" because, as patients tell the analyst more and more about their lives (their thoughts, dreams, memories, hopes, fears, relationships, jobs, and fantasies), they start to recognize themselves in new ways, and this can help them overcome conflicts, impasses, bad feelings, and even psychiatric illnesses that have kept them from flourishing. Autobiographers do something similar as they remember, re-examine, and re-tell their lives - though one very important difference is that they do so, not privately in a psychoanalyst's office, but publicly in books that anyone may read. This seminar is a comparative exploration of these different ways of a re-telling a life. This seminar is usually team-taught by a humanities scholar and a practicing psychoanalyst.\n\nFall\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 3097, GSWS 3890\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0549 Writing About Art Seminar\n\nWhat does it mean to write about art? What are the historical origins of this undertaking? How does language mediate the intellectual, somatic, and cultural rapport between the viewing self and the physical object? As an initial response to these questions we will examine the writings of the Tuscan artist and critic Giorgio Vasari (1511-1574), the biographer of such renowned artists as Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, and Michelangelo. We will also read the letters of famous artists from the early modern period, and examine the theoretical forays of artists such as Albrecht DÃ?rer, who attempted to sketch the relationship between the memory and the imagination. Finally, we will look to examples of works of art for how we might read visual images as expressive of theories about what are is and what it can do.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ARTH 3510, GRMN 1302, ITAL 3610\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0575 The Novel and Marriage\n\nThe content of the course will vary from semester to semester.

We will explore the way in which artistic, technical, historical, and cultural conditions have shaped the development of computer animation. Topics will include the impact of early motion graphics experiments in the sixties, the contributions of university- and corporation-funded research, commercial production, and the rise of Pixar. We will consider the companies and personalities in computer animation who have shaped the art form and continue to influence it, the contributions to computer animation from visionaries around the world, and current day applications of animated imagery. Throughout the course, we will screen important works from the canon of computer animation, including the earliest computer-animated shorts, scenes from Beauty and the Beast, the first Pixar shorts, Toy Story, Final Fantasy and works done internationally to forward the art and the industry.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ARTH 3871, CIMS 3201, FNAR 3182\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0593 The Animation Of Disney\n\nNo organization has exerted as much influence on popular culture and the art form of animation as The Walt Disney Company. For decades, Disney films were the standard by which all other animated films were measured. This course will examine the biography and philosophy of founder Walt Disney, as well as The Walt Disney Company’s impact on animation art, storytelling and technology, the entertainment industry, and American popular culture. We will consider Disney's most influential early films, look at the 1960s when Disney’s importance in popular culture began to erode, and analyze the films that led to the Disney renaissance of the late 1980s/early 1990s. We will also assess the subsequent purchase of Pixar Animation Studios and the overall impact Pixar has had on Disney. The class will also look at recent trends and innovations, including live-action remakes and Disney+.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ARTH 3873, CIMS 3203, FNAR 3184\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0594 History of Children's TV\n\nThis course will survey the history of children’s television from the invention of television through the present, with an emphasis on series development and production, artistry, and the colorful personalities who built this industry.

We will discuss the history of animated cartoons that were made specifically for television, Saturday morning production, the rise of Japanese cartoons from the 1960s through Pokemon, and the growth of children’s cable channels in the 90s, as well as other landmark moments. We’ll also assess the impact of streaming platforms on television and the future of children’s media.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ARTH 3874, CIMS 3204, FNAR 3185\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0595 Global TV\n\nThis course explores a broad media landscape through new critical and conceptual approaches. It is designated as a Benjamin Franklin Seminar. This course maps the footprints of television at a global scale. Adopting comparative approaches, we will be studying TV's formation of national and global discourses, and thereby recognizing not only television's impact on processes of globalization, but also the ability of television to matter globally. Working through concepts of \"broadcasting,\" \"flow,\" \"circulation,\" and \"circumvention,\" the course examines the movement of (and blocks encountered by) television programs and signals across national borders and cultures. The course particularly focuses on how global television cultures have been transformed due to shifts from broadcasting technologies to (Internet) streaming services? Navigating from United States and Cuba to India and Egypt, the readings in the course illuminate how particular televisual genres, institutions, and reception practices emerged in various countries during specific historical periods. We shall be addressing a range of questions: what kind of global phenomenon is television? Can we study television in countries where we do not know the existing local languages? In what different ways (through what platforms, interfaces, and screens) do people in different continents access televisual content? What explains the growing transnational exports of Turkish and Korean TV dramas? What is the need to historically trace the infrastructural systems like satellites (and optical fiber cables) that made (and continue to make) transmission of television programming possible across the world? How do fans circumvent geo-blocking to watch live sporting events? Assignments include submitting weekly discussion questions and a final paper.

Emphasis will be placed on how pantomime was used by filmmaker Charles Chaplin between the years 1914–1940. We shall consider important moments in the history of European pantomime that preceded and influenced Chaplin, then concentrate on how the tradition coalesced in his silent films.\n\nAlso Offered As: CIMS 0596\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0599 Cinema and Civil Rights\n\nThis undergraduate seminar will examine key moments in the history of civil rights through a cinematic lens. Over the course of the semester, we will explore how filmmakers have depicted the lives, aspirations, and strategies of those who have struggled for equal rights; how different struggles have intersected with each other; what aesthetic strategies have been adopted to represent freedom and the denial of it; and how effective cinematic efforts to contribute to increased freedom have been as well as what criteria we use to evaluate success or failure in the first place. Each week, we will watch a film and read a series of texts that will be drawn from a variety of arenas, including histories of civil rights; civil rights pamphlets and speeches; filmmaker interviews; film and media theory; memoirs; and theories of race, gender and sexuality. Course requirements: mutual respect; completion of all readings and screenings; participation in class discussion; weekly online responses; a final project that can be a research paper, film, art project, or community-based initiative.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: AFRC 3930, ARTH 3930, CIMS 3930, GSWS 3930\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0700 Critical-Creative Approaches to Literature\n\nThis course enables students to think and write creatively as a means to the critical understanding of literary texts.

Seven years in the writing, the novel was recognized for its beauty and originality when it began appearing in serial form in a U.S. literary magazine, only to be confiscated when a court found it unprintably obscene. But because Joyce was stubborn and his patrons generous, Ulysses found its way into print in Paris in 1922, the wonder year of international modernism. Since then, it has inspired dozens of adaptations, prompted many hundreds of scholarly studies, and launched thousands of literary pilgrimages to Dublin, where readers retrace the steps of Joyce’s characters in their latter-day reenactment of Homer’s Odyssey. “Joyce’s Ulysses: Making Readings” is a Critical-Creative Approaches course. We’ll devote the first ten weeks of the semester to reading Joyce’s novel alongside selected criticism and adaptations in a variety of media. Discussion, mini-lectures, and student glosses will form the basis of this part of the course. We’ll spend the final month of the course collaboratively making readings of Ulysses—conceiving and producing hybrid creative-critical projects that engage with the novel in some way other than conventional analysis. You might co-write an apocryphal episode, complete with schema and annotations. You might produce a film or stage adaptation of an episode that benefits from your readings in Joyce criticism. Or you might devise some other approach entirely. Our co-instructor and primary consultant on the final projects will be Rob Berry, the artist behind Ulysses ‘Seen,’ the internationally acclaimed digital comics adaptation of Joyce’s novel.\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0775 Modern Children's Literature\n\nThis course studies the evolution and convolution of Children's Literature from the 19th to 21st centuries in order to best understand why these books are not just fabric of our youth, but of critical cultural, literary, and scholarly importance. As a Critical-Creative seminar, final assignments can be either critical analysis or a creative project.

Where adolescence fits into the equation. And why, as a fuzzily-boundaried genre, it has been unflaggingly best-selling, lauded and derided in equal measure, for nearly three hundred years. As a Critical-Creative seminar, final assignments can be either critical analysis or a creative project. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0783 Writing About Music (Critical-Creative Seminar)\n\nThis critical-creative seminar takes a dynamic and interdisciplinary look at the art of writing about music. When one writes about music what does one write about? Sound? Culture? Feeling (is feeling historical)? Technologies? Art? The course explores how one can approach the power of any of the above through writing, writing about record labels, cities, bands, musicians, and more. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 0783\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 0785 Queer Archives, Aesthetics, and Performance\n\nThis course focuses on questions of how to represent the queer past, which it approaches from several angles: through training in archival methods and in scholarly debates about historiographical ethics (or, in the words of David Halperin, \"how to do the history of homosexuality\"); through engagement with the work of artists who make archives central to their practice; and through lab-based training that aims to represent encounters with queer history through embodied performance.

This course explores the Bible as literature, considering such matters as the artistic arrangement and stylistic qualities of individual episodes as well as the larger thematic patterns of both the Old and New Testaments and the Apocrypha. A good part of the course is spent looking at the place of the Bible in cultural and literary history and the influence of such biblical figures as Adam and Eve, David, and Susanna on writers of poetry, drama, and fiction in the English and American literary traditions. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 1009 Classical Traditions\n\nA broad consideration of the ways in which writers and artists from the early modern era to the present day have responded to the classical tradition, borrowing from, imitating, questioning, and challenging their classical predecessors. Through modern reworkings of ancient epic, tragedy, biography, and lyric by authors ranging from Shakespeare and Racine to contemporary poets, painters, and filmmakers, we will ask what the terms \"classical\" and \"tradition\" might mean and will track the continuities and differences between antiquity and the modern world. Should we see ancient Greek and Roman culture as an inheritance, a valuable source of wealth bequeathed to the modern age? Or is there something wrong with that picture? How do ancient texts have to be adapted and transformed if they are to speak to modern conditions and concerns? This is an introductory-level course open to anyone who cares about the relationship between the present and the past.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: CLST 1700\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 1010 Old English\n\nThis course introduces students to the powerful and influential corpus of Old English literature.

Readings will be in Old English, and the first few weeks of the course will be devoted to mastering Old English prosody, vocabulary, and grammar (as well as a crash course on the early history of the English language). During the last few weeks we may read modern criticism of Old English poetry, or we will consider the modern poetic reception of Old English literature and explore theories and problems of translation, reading translations of Old English poems by Yeats, Auden, Tolkien, and Heaney.

This period was marked by major transformations, not only with respect to government, law, religious practice, intellectual life, England's relation to the Continent (during the 100 Years War), the organization of society (especially after the Black Death), the circulation of literary texts, and the status of authors. Topics may include medieval women writers, manuscript production, literatures of revolt, courtly culture, Crusades, cross-Channel influences, and religious controversy.

We will read a number of medieval and renaissance romance narratives, in verse and prose, beginning with the Arthurian romances (Malory's Morte D'Arthur, Sir Gawain And The Green Knight) and continuing with as many (and as much) of the great renaissance romances as time will allow: Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia, Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queen, and Lady Mary Wroth's Urania.

We will examine the links between modernity, the avant-garde, and various national modernisms that emerged alongside them. Resolutely transatlantic and open to French, Spanish, Italian, German, or Russian influences, this course assumes the very concept of Modernism to necessitate an international perspective focusing on the new in literature and the arts -- including film, the theatre, music, and the visual arts.

See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 1179 World Literature\n\nHow do we think 'the world' as such? Globalizing economic paradigms encourage one model that, while it connects distant regions with the ease of a finger-tap, also homogenizes the world, manufacturing patterns of sameness behind simulations of diversity. Our current world-political situation encourages another model, in which fundamental differences are held to warrant the consolidation of borders between Us and Them, \"our world\" and \"theirs.\" This course begins with the proposal that there are other ways to encounter the world, that are politically compelling, ethically important, and personally enriching--and that the study of literature can help tease out these new paths. Through the idea of World Literature, this course introduces students to the appreciation and critical analysis of literary texts, with the aim of navigating calls for universality or particularity (and perhaps both) in fiction and film. \"World literature\" here refers not merely to the usual definition of \"books written in places other than the US and Europe, \"but any form of cultural production that explores and pushes at the limits of a particular world, that steps between and beyond worlds, or that heralds the coming of new worlds still within us, waiting to be born. And though, as we read and discuss our texts, we will glide about in space and time from the inner landscape of a private mind to the reaches of the farthest galaxies, knowledge of languages other than English will not be required, and neither will any prior familiary with the literary humanities. In the company of drunken kings, botanical witches, ambisexual alien lifeforms, and storytellers who've lost their voice, we will reflect on, and collectively navigate, our encounters with the faraway and the familiar--and thus train to think through the challenges of concepts such as translation, narrative, and ideology. Texts include Kazuo Ishiguro, Ursula K. LeGuin, Salman Rushdie, Werner Herzog, Jamaica Kincaid, Russell Hoban, Hiroshi Teshigahara, Arundhathi Roy, and Abbas Kiarostami.\n\nFall or Spring\n\nAlso Offered As: CLST 1602, COML 1191\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 1180 The Art of Revolution\n\nThis course offers an international and multidisciplinary tour of revolutionary art from the 20th and 21st centuries, including cinema, literature, visual art, theater, and performance art.

The focus will be poetry, film, fiction and non fiction and at least two geographic areas spanning the Americas, South Asia, the Caribbean and Africa as they reflect the impact of colonial rule on the cultural representations of identity, nationalism, race, class and gender. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: CIMS 1190, COML 1190\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 1191 Community, Freedom, Violence: Writing the South Asian City\n\nThe South Asian city—as space, symbol, and memory—is the subject of this course. Through a range of readings in English and in translation, we will gain a sense for the history of the city and the ways in which it is a setting for protest and nostalgia, social transformation and solitary wandering. We will see reflections of the city in the detective novels sold in its train stations, the stories scribbled in its cafes, and films produced in its backlots. Readings will attempt to address urban spaces across South Asia through a range of works, which we will examine in the context of secondary readings, including histories and ethnological works that take up life in the modern city. Students will finish this course prepared to pursue projects dealing with the urban from multiple disciplinary perspectives. This course is suitable for anyone interested in the culture, society, or literature of South Asia, and assumes no background in South Asian languages.\n\nFall or Spring\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1121, SAST 1120, URBS 1120\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 1200 African-American Literature\n\nAn introduction to African-American literature, ranging across a wide spectrum of moments, methodologies, and ideological postures, from Reconstruction and the Harlem Renaissance to the Civil Rights Movement.

See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 1210 Literatures of Jazz\n\nThat modernism is steeped as much in the rituals of race as of innovation is most evident in the emergence of the music we have come to know as jazz, which results from collaborations and confrontations taking place both across and within the color line. In this course we will look at jazz and the literary representations it engendered in order to understand modern American culture. We will explore a dizzying variety of forms, including autobiography and album liner notes, biography, poetry, fiction, and cinema. We'll examine how race, gender, and class influenced the development of jazz music, and then will use jazz music to develop critical approaches to literary form. Students are not required to have a critical understanding of music. Class will involve visits from musicians and critics, as well as field trips to some of Philadelphia's most vibrant jazz venues. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: AFRC 1210\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 1220 Caribbean Literature\n\nThis course will introduce students to Caribbean literature.

We will examine literature, theater, visual art, and popular cultural forms, including murals, poster art, graffiti, guerrilla urban interventions, novels, poetry, short stories, and film. In each instance, we will study this work within its historical context and with close attention to the ways it illuminates class formation, racialization, and ideologies of gender and sexuality as they shape Latinx experience in the U.S. Topics addressed in the course will include immigration and border policy, revolutionary nationalism and its critique, anti-imperialist thought, Latinx feminisms, queer latinidades, ideology, identity formation, and social movements. While we will address key texts, historical events, and intellectual currents from the late 19th century and early 20th century, the course will focus primarily on literature and art from the 1960s to the present. All texts will be in English.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ARTH 2679, COML 1260, GSWS 1260, LALS 1260\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 1270 Asian American Literature\n\nAn overview of Asian American literature from its beginnings at the turn of the twentieth century to the present. This course covers a wide range of Asian American novels, plays, and poems, situating them in the contexts of American history and minority communities and considering the variety of formal strategies these different texts take. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ASAM 0103\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 1271 American Musical Theatre\n\nThe American musical is an unapologetically popular art form, but many of the works that come from this tradition have advanced and contributed to the canon of theatre as a whole. In this course we will focus on both music and texts to explore ways in which the musical builds on existing theatrical traditions, as well as alters and reshapes them. Finally, it is precisely because the musical is a popular theatrical form that we can discuss changing public tastes, and the financial pressures inherent in mounting a production. Beginning with early roots in operetta, we will survey the works of prominent writers in the American musical theatre, including Kern, Berlin, Gershwin, Porter, Rodgers, Hart, Hammerstein, Bernstein, Sondheim and others. Class lecture/discussions will be illustrated with recorded examples.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: CIMS 1271, THAR 1271\n\nMutually Exclusive: THAR 0271\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 1272 Topics in Asian American Literature and Culture\n\nThis seminar explores Asian American literature and culture intensively; specific course topics will vary from year to year. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\nAlso Offered As: ASAM 1210\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 1273 Dark Comedy in Theatre and Film\n\nThis course will examine the \"troublesome genre\" of dark comedy by looking at the ways in which theatre and film use comic and tragic structures and traditions to explore concepts and stories seemingly at odds with those traditions. Although not always organized chronologically in time, we will examine the formal and structural characteristics of tragicomedy by tracing its development, from some of its earliest roots in Roman comedy, to its manifestation in contemporary films and plays. Aside from close readings of plays and analysis of films, we will read selected critical essays and theory to enhance our understanding of how dark comedies subvert categories and expectations. We will look at how dark comedies affect audiences and read sections of plays aloud in class. Issues to be considered include comparing the way the genre translates across theatre and film (adaptation) and examining the unique placement of the genre at the heart of contemporary American culture. Students will have the opportunity to experiment with creating tragicomic effect through performance in their presentations. The class is a seminar, with required participation in discussions. Other assignments include an 8-10 page paper and a presentation. We will read plays by authors as diverse as Plautus, Anton Chekhov, and Lynn Nottage, and filmmakers including Charlie Chaplin, Sofia Coppola, and Bong Joon-ho.\n\nAlso Offered As: CIMS 1273, THAR 1273\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 1279 Women in Theatre and Performance\n\nWhat is feminist theatre? How do artists use live performance to provoke not only thought and feeling, but also social, personal, and political change? This course will examine a wide array of plays and performances by and about women; these pieces are, in turn, serious, hilarious, outrageous, poignant--and always provocative. Our focus will be on English-language works from the late 20th century to the present (#metoo) moment. We will read these performance texts and/or view them on stage/screen; we will also read essays that provide contextual background on feminist theatre theory and history. Throughout the semester, we will engage diverse perspectives on women and race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, and gender identity; the issues we encounter will also include marriage and motherhood, career and community, feminism and friendship, and patriarchy and power. The class will take full advantage of any related events occurring on campus or in the city, and will feature visits with guest speakers. Students will have the opportunity to pursue research on their own areas of interest (some recent examples are \"women in comedy,\" trans performance, drag kings, feminist directing, etc.).\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: GSWS 1279, THAR 1279\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 1289 Jewish Films and Literature\n\nFrom the 1922 silent film \"Hungry Hearts\" through the first \"talkie,\" \"The Jazz Singer,\" produced in 1927, and beyond \"Schindler's List,\" Jewish characters have confronted the problems of their Jewishness on the silver screen for a general American audience. Alongside this Hollywood tradition of Jewish film, Yiddish film blossomed from independent producers between 1911 and 1939, and interpreted literary masterpieces, from Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" to Sholom Aleichem's \"Teyve the Dairyman,\" primarily for an immigrant, urban Jewish audience. In this course, we will study a number of films and their literary sources (in fiction and drama), focusing on English language and Yiddish films within the framework of three dilemmas of interpretation: a) the different ways we \"read\" literature and film, b) the various ways that the media of fiction, drama, and film \"translate\" Jewish culture, and c) how these translations of Jewish culture affect and are affected by their implied audience.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1090, GRMN 1090, JWST 1090\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 1295 Italian History on the Table\n\n\"Mangia, mangia!\" is an expression commonly associated with the American stereotype of Italians, whose cuisine is popular throughout the world. But is the perceived Italian love of food the same in the United States and in Italy? Is it an issue of quantity or quality? Of socioeconomics, politics, education, health ...? Global, local or maybe, glocal? In this course, we will explore the role of food in Italian culture and in the shaping of the Italic identity, in Italy and abroad since antiquity. We will trace its evolution through literary documents, works of art, music and film, as well as family recipes and cooking tools; from ancient Rome to Dante and Boccaccio, to Stanley Tucci's Big Night; from court banquets to food trucks that, while always a feature at Italian fairs and open air markets, are now being \"Americanized\" under the influence of American cooking shows on Italian television. This course will be taught in English. It is an OBL (Object Based Learning) Course and will include class visits, in person and/or virtual, to the Penn Museum and to the Rare Book and Manuscript Library. It counts also as a credit for the minor in Global Medieval Studies.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ITAL 1920\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 1296 Black Italy: Transnational Identities and Narratives in Afro-Italian Literature\n\nThis course focuses on how the migration movements to Italy, mainly from the Maghreb and the Horn of Africa in the '80s and '90s contributed to change Italy's status and image. From a country of emigration to other parts of the world, Italy became - as many historians, geographers, and scholars have observed - an immigration site, playing a pivotal role in the African diaspora. In the shadow of Italy's colonialist heritage (a past that Italy still has not fully confronted), these phenomena of mass migration challenge, complicate, and develop the notion of Italian-ness and undermine the fixity of an Italian identity in favor of multicultural and transnational identities. This course focuses on several Black Italian artists, writers, filmmakers, and activists of Somali, Eritrean, Tunisian, Ethiopian, and Egyptian origins (e.g. migrants or children of immigrants who were born or raised in Italy and children of mixed-race unions) who contribute to broaden the definition of Italian-ness and to challenge its racial, social, and cultural boundaries. Students will analyze short stories, novels, documentaries, songs, blogs, journal articles by Igiaba Scego, Cristina Ali Farah, Gabriella Ghermandi, Medhin Paolos, Fred Kudjo Kuwornu, Amir Issaa, Amara Lakhous, Pap Khouma, and Kaha Mohamed Aden, among others. They describe their multicultural identities, their senses of belonging, their feelings for the place that is depriving them of foundational rights (such as citizenship or a legal status), their nostalgia for their homeland or the countries where their parents were born, their fights to find or create a social and literal space where being recognized not as foreigners or worse as \"clandestini.\" Their works offer an original, complex, and multilayered depiction of contemporary Italy and its social and cultural changes, where the African community is becoming larger and better represented. Some questions this course will ask include: what are the historical and geographical components of blackness in Italy? How, if at all, have these phenomena of migration changed Italian identity? How do black Italians live within the context of anti-blackness? How do these Italian writers and artists relate to African American histories and experiences of diaspora? How can African Italian literature contribute to a deeper understanding of the Black diaspora in Europe and elsewhere? The course will pursue answers to these questions by exploring issues of race, color, gender, class, nationality, identity, citizenship, social justice in post- colonial Italy while drawing on related disciplines such as Geography, Mediterranean Studies, Diaspora Studies, Post-Colonialism, and Media and Cultural Studies.

What is the nature of desire? This course introduces students to a long history of speculation about the meaning and nature of gender and sexuality -- a history fundamental to literary representation and the business of making meaning. We will consider theories from Aristophane's speech in Plato's Symposium to recent feminist and queer theory. Authors treated might include: Plato, Shakespeare, J. S. Mill, Mary Wollstonecraft, Sigmund Freud, Virginia Woolf, Simone de Beauvoir, Adrienne Rich, Audre Lorde, Michel Foucault, Gayle Rubin, Catherine MacKinnon, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Judith Butler, bell hooks, Leo Bersani, Gloria Anzaldua, David Halperin, Cherrie Moraga, Donna Haraway, Gayatri Spivak, Diana Fuss, Rosemary Hennesy, Chandra Tadpole Mohanty, and Susan Stryker.

More fundamentally, the course will introduce students to questions about the relation between identity and representation. We will attend in particular to intersections between gender, sexuality, race, class, and nation, and will choose from a rich vein of authors. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1310, GSWS 1310\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 1330 Writing Women, Part 1\n\nThis is a sophomore-level course designed for students who are curious about the literary and social history of women’s writing between 1660 and 1700. We’ll survey the work of influential writers of the time period who identified as female, and add a few texts by men writing about women. We’ll consider how women's writing participated in the many worlds from which women were excluded — the worlds of inherited literary tradition, formal education, commerce, religious debate, and contemporary politics, to name a few. The course focuses on authors resident in “Great Britain” (a national entity still under development during this time, as we shall see) between the Restoration of Charles II in 1660 and the turn of the eighteenth century. Another course, ENGL 1331, focuses on 1700-1790. Students may take one or both of these stand-alone courses. No prerequisites required. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\nAlso Offered As: GSWS 1330\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nENGL 1331 Writing Women, Part 2: Sexuality and Power, 1700-1799\n\n\"Sexuality and Power” is an intermediate-level course organized as a collaborative seminar. The eighteenth century (1700-1799) in Britain was an exciting time. Literacy's long-policed borders were being relaxed, and publication was allowed to flourish largely free of censorship. As the set of those allowed to participate in public discourse slowly expanded, new opportunities arose for literate women. We will focus on the work of important female-identified writers from the period. Students from all disciplines are welcome. There are no prerequisites. See the English Department's webs"
