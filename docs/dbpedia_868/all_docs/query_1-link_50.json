Judkins called for assistance, drove to the scene and parked his vehicle across the roadway to block traffic from approaching the area. At approximately the same time, ranger Tom Valenta arrived from the opposite direction, and the man with the gun - later identified as 28-year-old B.E.M. of Jackson Hole, Wyoming - started walking toward him. Valenta saw a visitor's vehicle pulling up behind him, so he backed his patrol car toward the visitor, forcing the visitor to back up out of immediate danger. B.E.M. then turned toward Judkins, who also backed his vehicle away from B.E.M.. B.E.M. turned once again and started towards Valenta, who'd backed up about 200' around the corner of the intersection. Valenta got out of his patrol car with his shotgun and took a defensive position behind the open door. He ordered B.E.M. to drop his gun (a 380 mm Luger pistol), but B.E.M. continued to advance, yelling repeatedly: \"I'm not going back to prison!\" At one point, he told Valenta: \"I'm going to kill you. You'd better shoot me now because I'm going to kill you.\" As he approached, B.E.M. pointed his weapon directly at Valenta; when he closed to within 20', Valenta fired one round from his shotgun, striking B.E.M. in the left side just below his chest. B.E.M. was flown to the University Medical Center in Las Vegas, where he died on the operating table. Shortly after the incident, the park received information via teletype which identified B.E.M. and advised that he and an accomplice named A.J.P. were wanted for murder and armed robbery in Wyoming, where the two had killed A.J.P.'s uncle by shooting and stabbing him. Both were considered to be armed and dangerous. A.J.P. was arrested at a casino by Las Vegas police later that night. Their vehicle was found in Barstow, California. (Newt Sikes, CR, LAME).\n\nFriday, March 17, 1989\n\n89-51 - Lake Mead - Fatality\n\nThe body of 42-year-old S.K. of Arcadia, California, was found in a vehicle at the Lake Mead Marina parking lot.

(LAME dispatch, via Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO).\n\nMonday, April 24, 1989\n\n89-72 - Lake Mead - Motor Vehicle Fatalities\n\nA motor vehicle accident on East Lake Mead Boulevard in the early hours of the 18th claimed the lives of two Las Vegas youths - K.M., 23, and J.L., who turned 24 that day. The driver, D.B., also of Las Vegas, was ejected from the vehicle during the accident and was not injured. D.B. evidently lost control of the vehicle due to excessive speed. (Lila Roybal, LAME, via Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO).\n\nWednesday, May 10, 1989\n\n89-84 - Lake Mead - Diving Fatality\n\nOn the morning of May 7th, D.D., 63, of Coronado, California, was diving with a friend in Ringbolt Rapids on Lake Mohave.

(Ann Betus, RAD/WRO).\n\nWednesday, May 10, 1989\n\n89-85 - Lake Mead - Boating Fatality\n\nOn the night of May 5th, six people were injured in an accident in Echo Bay when their boat hit a rock outcropping at a high rate of speed. B.G.F., 47, of San Bruno, California, later died of his injuries in a Las Vegas hospital. There was no evidence that alcohol was a contributing factor in the accident. (Ann Betus, RAD/WRO).\n\nFriday, May 12, 1989\n\n89-84 - Lake Mead - Follow-up on Diving Fatality\n\nPark rangers received a report of the entrapment of diver D.D. in Ringbolt Rapids via marine band radio shortly after the incident occurred, flew to the scene by helicopter and were in the water about 35 minutes after the report was received. They might have been able to save the victim, but the water was flowing at 22,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) and they couldn't get closer than 30 feet from him. The river flow was dropped to 8,000 cfs in order to allow the divers to safely make the recovery. (John Benjamin, GICA).\n\nMonday, May 15, 1989\n\n89-90 - Lake Mead - Fatal Shooting by Park Rangers\n\nOn the afternoon of May 13th, two park rangers responded to the report of an unoccupied drifting canoe in the Devil's Cove area of the park's Temple Bar District. When they exited their boat at a nearby beach camping area, they were confronted by a 33-year-old male with a large knife. The rangers tried to get him to drop his knife for 15 to 20 minutes, but were unsuccessful. As they climbed back into their boat, the man lunged at them with the knife. The two rangers then fired on and killed the man. No further information is available on the incident at present; a follow-up report will appear as soon as possible. (Capt. Ed Winkle, USPP, and dispatch, LAME).\n\nTuesday, May 16, 1989\n\n89-90 - Lake Mead - Follow-up on Fatal Shooting by Park Rangers\n\nOn the morning on May 13th, a fisherman saw a swamped canoe in Devil's Cove and reported it to the park. While rangers Don McBee (Lake Mead) and John Peterson (Grand Canyon) were en route by boat to the cove, two other fisherman in the area also spotted the canoe and recognized it as one which was owned by 33-year-old D.N. of Westoff, Texas, who had been living in a little shack in a narrow canyon near the cove since January. Noftser was known to rangers at Lake Mead. Sometime earlier this year, a family camping in the cove awoke to the sounds of D.N. loudly chanting at an altar near his hut and had complained to the park. Since D.N. had exceeded the 90-day limit on backcountry camping at Lake Mead, he had also been warned more than once that his permit had expired and that he would have to leave. The two fisherman found D.N. on shore and asked him if he wanted to go out fishing with them. D.N. joined them, but spent most of his time sleeping in the bottom of the boat. When he awoke, he began talking irrationally, then picked up a rifle he'd brought into the boat with him and took a shot at one of the fisherman, just barely missing him. At about this time, McBee and Peterson arrived on scene and approached the boat. Peterson took possession of the rifle, which was in plain view. The two boats headed toward shore side by side; when they neared the beach, the two fishermen jumped out and D.N. pulled out a hunting knife and began making threatening remarks to the rangers. Both rangers drew their weapons. The two rangers then spent over 20 minutes unsuccessfully trying to get D.N. to put down his knife, at the end of which time D.N. suddenly jumped into their boat. McBee was in the bow, D.N. was amidships, and Peterson was in the stern. The two rangers kept talking to him, but D.N. suddenly lunged toward the bow, telling McBee \"I'll cut your guts out.\" McBee fired six rounds at Noftser - four hit him directly, one grazed him and the sixth missed. D.N. fell back into the middle of the boat, then got up again and started toward McBee, who was reloading his empty revolver. Peterson fired twice at D.N., hitting him both times. A Flight For Life helicopter was called for medical assistance, but D.N. was pronounced dead on arrival. The Las Vegas Metro PD homicide unit is investigating the incident. Following the shooting, a check was made of D.N.'s shack. Investigators found sheets of notebook paper with strange inscriptions posted on the walls, a six month supply of canned food, several potted plants (possibly marijuana) and 1200 prescription pills which were identified as common medication for disturbed mental patients. D.N. had no known criminal record. (Newt Sikes, CR, IAME, via Herb Gercke, RfiD/WRO and directly to RAD/WASO).\n\nWednesday, May 31, 1989\n\n89-108 - Lake Mead - Drownings\n\nTwo separate drownings occurred in the park on the 30th - one at Boulder Beach, the other at Katheryn Swim Beach. I.C., 29, of Huntington Park, California, attempted to go swimming at Boulder after drinking heavily. He drowned in 3' of water as his companions watched. B.T., 19, of Bollingbrook, Illinois, was swimming with a group of five persons with inner tubes at Katheryn when he became separated from his tube. He was rescued and brought to a nearby hospital, but was pronounced dead six hours later. (Herb Gercke, FAD/TCRO, via CompuServe message to RAD/WASO).\n\nThursday, June 1, 1989\n\n89-109 - Lake Mead - MVA Fatality\n\nS.R., 31, of Las Vegas, Nevada, was towing a boat trailer along North Shore Road on May 30th when she entered a left turn, over-corrected, ran through a guard rail, and plunged down a 25-foot embankment. She died at the scene of head injuries. (CompuServe message from RAD/WRO).\n\nFriday, June 2, 1989\n\n89-90 - Lake Mead - Follow-up on Fatal Shooting by Park Rangers\n\nThe Board of Inquiry on the fatal shooting of D.N. at Devil's Cove on May 13th (see the 5/16 morning report) has ruled that park rangers Don McBee and Join Peterson acted within their authority and that the shooting was a justifiable homicide. (Lowell White, ARD/Cps, WRO, via CompuServe message to RAD/WASO).\n\nWednesday, July 5, 1989\n\n89-166 - Lake Mead - Waterskiing Fatality\n\nOn June 22nd, 70-year-old R.H. of Littletown, Colorado, was waterskiing on Lake Mead when he fell while coming to shore. He was medevaced to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival. (Telephone report from RAD/WRO).\n\nTuesday, July 18, 1989\n\n89-188 - Lake Mead - MVA with Multiple Fatalities\n\nWhile driving at a high rate of speed (70 - 80 mph) on North Shore Road on the evening of the 12th, R.N. of Las Vegas lost control of his pickup truck, hit an embankment, then hit a passenger car head on as he tried to regain control of his vehicle. R.N.'s passenger, 23-year-old C.L. of Las Vegas, was killed in the accident, as were all three people in the car - 24-year-old S.D. and his daughters S., one, and S., three, all of Las Vegas. R.N. is in fair to good condition at the University Medical Center in Las Vegas. Investigator's have determined that R.N. was driving under the influence of alcohol.

Other visitors reached him and brought him to shore, but it took another five minutes before someone with CPR skills arrived at the beach. CPR efforts failed, and Dominguez was later pronounced dead due to drowning.

As he approached an intersection with a beach access road, he saw a Ford crew cab pickup coming in his direction which appeared to be slowing to make a turn onto the access road. Instead of stopping to allow DeMunbrun to pass by, however, the driver of the pickup made a sudden turn across his path. DeMunbrun braked and pulled to the side of the road, but could not avoid a collision. The impact caused the pickup to overturn, and both vehicles suffered major damage. Neither DeMunbrun nor the three occupants of the pickup were injured, though. All four were wearing seatbelts, and the air bag in DeMunbrun's cruiser activated and provided him with further protection.

The caller said that one of their party was in diabetic shock and that several of them would be bringing the victim to Temple Bar in a 19 foot Sun-ray speedboat. Rangers Mike Ramirez and Jonathan Schafler went down to the dock at Temple Bar to await their arrival. When the boat failed to appear at the scheduled time, the rangers headed out in a 20 to 22 foot Boston Whaler to find them. Shortly thereafter, the two boats collided. One of the occupants of the Sun-ray, 28-year-old S.N., was fatally injured. Two others T.M.N., 30, of Ontario, California, and W.N., 34, of Chino, California received serious head injuries, and the operator of the boat L.M. of Bloomington, California received minor injuries. Ramirez and Schafler suffered only minor injuries. The rangers were able to transport all four to Temple Bar. The two with head injuries were taken via helicopter to Las Vegas; the third injured party was taken via ambulance to Kingman, Arizona. Although the night was dark, the Sun-ray was running at about 60 mph without lights except for a handheld flashlight. L.M. initially stated that he saw the Whaler and was heading toward it; he apparently misjudged the distance between the boats and was unable to correct in time. Because the accident involved the NPS, the park has asked the Nevada Department of Wildlife to investigate the incident. The Clark County coroner is investigating the fatality.

Mrs. R.G., the couple's three-year-old daughter and their six-year-old nephew all received second degree burns; Mr. R.G. and the couple's four-and-a-half-month-old son received first and second degree burns. All were taken by helicopter to the burn center at the University Medical Center in Las Vegas. The fire was extinguished by the marina's fire boat. The fire was caused by a faulty gas filler hose which let raw fuel into the engine and bilge of the vessel.

The accident, which took place within the view of their families on shore, occurred when one boat turned left in front of the second boat. Since the first boat did not have the appropriate lights working, the operator of the second boat did not see it and ran over the top of it. Both parties in the first boat the operator, J.H., 35, of Huntington Beach, California, and his passenger, D.O., 32, of Compton, California were killed instantly. The pair in the second boat were evacuated to a hospital; although their injuries are serious, they are not lifethreatening. D.O.'s body was found the next day by park divers. She was the sister of the second boat's operator. Factors involved in the accident include lack of proper lighting on the first boat, night time operation, excessive speed, and, possibly, consumption of alcohol.

He was found sitting in his pickup truck alongside the Hemennway Road in a state of extreme intoxication. He was given a series of field sobriety tests, all of which he failed. While being placed under arrest, he was asked if there were any valuables in his vehicle. G.H. told the ranger that he had two handguns behind the seat. The ranger retrieved the weapons, both of which had rounds in their magazines. Checks on the guns were negative. G.H. was taken into custody, and his mother later retrieved the truck. The handguns were left with the vehicle since they had not been used in a crime and were being turned over to a responsible party. G.H. pleaded guilty later that month to the under the influence charge and was fined $110. He pleaded no contest on the firearm possession charge and was fined $60 for that offense. G.H. lived at the time with his mother in Henderson, Nevada, about 20 miles from Las Vegas. The weapons found in the truck were the same models as those employed in the Killeen massacre.

At that time, the daughter of a volunteer in the park reported that the employee had sexually assaulted her in the Callville Bay fire house. While investigating this complaint, investigators learned of an earlier sexual assault complaint against the employee which had been handled informally. Written and verbal statements were taken from both victims, and the cases were presented to the United States attorney. At that office's request, the cases were transferred to the Clark County district attorney's office, and prosecution in state court was approved for two felony counts of sexual assault. In a plea bargain agreement, the employee agreed to plead guilty to the single count of open lewdness and the state agreed to dismiss the felony counts of sexual assault. The employee, who had earlier been terminated by the park, was sentenced to a year in the Clark County jail (suspended), an indeterminate probationary period not to exceed three years, mandatory counseling, and 240 hours of community service.

Upon discovery of the explosives, the park evacuated a portion of the nearby shoreline, restricted boat traffic in the area, and requested the assistance of the Navy team because of their expertise in diving and dealing with explosives. The Navy divers spent about two hours retrieving the dynamite from the lake; it was then taken to Nellis Air Force Base for disposal. The dynamite was apparently stolen from a construction site in Utah and brought to the Las Vegas area by a man hoping to sell it to gangs.

A joint investigation by rangers and Las Vegas and Boulder City police led to the clearance of 20 stolen vehicle cases and the recovery of numerous items of stolen property, including guns, televisions, and VCR's. Four vehicles were recovered in the park, and seven NPS auto burglaries were cleared. The three juveniles were each found guilty of multiple counts of grand larceny, possession and use of firearms, auto burglary, and firing into an occupied dwelling. They are presently serving sentences in the state juvenile facility in Elko, Nevada.

He had attempted to rescue the victim, but was unsuccessful due to the swift current and poor visibility. The victim's car and fishing gear were found, and he has been tentatively identified as Sompis Gingsumrong, 34, of Las Vegas. The search for his body continues but is being hampered by fast moving water and near zero visibility. [John Jones, LAME, 10/27]\n\nThursday, December 3, 1992\n\n92-630 - Lake Mead (Nevada) - Search\n\nOn Wednesday, November 25th, park visitors found 19-year-old C.N., a local resident, wandering around without food or water and in an advanced stage of hypothermia. C.N., who was wearing chaps and tennis shoes with spurs, told rangers that he and a companion had been on a horse trip from Katherine to Hoover Dam, a distance of about 60 miles, and that they had become separated. Rangers and sheriff's deputies began an air, ground and water search for C.N.'s companion. The effort was suspended after two days when further investigation revealed that C.N. was suffering from mental confusion and that he had left home on Monday on a solo 60-mile hike without water or food. Nighttime temperatures during the period were in the 30s. [Dave Hoover, LAME, 12/2]\n\nMonday, January 11, 1993\n\n92-674 - Lake Mead (Nevada) - Sexual Assault\n\nOn August 11th, the parents of a ten-year old female contacted rangers and reported that she had been sexually assaulted by G.H., a resident of the employee housing area where they all lived. Rangers Pat Donohue and Larry Hanneman responded; when they arrived, G.H. attempted to walk rapidly from the area but was apprehended by Hanneman. Investigation confirmed the allegations, and G.H. was arrested and charged with sexual assault and lewdness with a minor. On September 3rd, G.H. pled guilty to lewdness with a minor in a plea bargain agreement with the county district attorney. The sexual assault charge was dismissed. On November 3rd, G.H. was sentenced to five years in the state prison.

[Bud Walsh, LAME, 1/12]\n\nTuesday, February 2, 1993\n\n93-43 - Lake Mead (Nevada) - Pursuit; Felony Arrest\n\nOn the afternoon of January 26th, rangers received a report that two juveniles in a white Chevrolet van were attempting to solicit gasoline from park visitors, telling them that they were trying to get to the Grand Canyon. Ranger Joe Hayes subsequently located and attempted to stop the van on the Willow Beach access road, but the van sped up and headed south on U.S. 93 at speeds approaching 100 miles per hour. Hayes followed while summoning assistance. Mohave County sheriff's office and Arizona DPS officers were in the process of responding to assist Hayes when the van made a U-turn at milepost 35 - 23 miles after the pursuit began - and headed north on 93. The park aircraft joined the pursuit and provided aerial surveillance. At milepost four, park criminal investigator Mike Blandford and rangers Gary Sebade and John Black, assisted by Arizona DPS and Hoover Dam police officers, established a road block and set out strips of road spikes to puncture the van's tires. All traffic at Hoover Dam was stopped The 56-mile pursuit ended when the van ran over the spikes. The two juvenile occupants of the van, one female and one male, were taken into custody; both were runaways from the state of Nevada. The driver of the van is a 14-year-old gang member from Las Vegas who was awaiting sentencing for burglary and possession of a controlled substance. Both juveniles were booked into the juvenile detention facility in Mohave County, Arizona. The male driver was charged with felony fleeing to elude a police officer, operating a motor vehicle without the owner's consent, and multiple traffic offenses. The female was booked as a runaway juvenile. [Susan Warner, LAME, 2/1]\n\nFriday, February 12, 1993\n\n93-62 - Lake Mead (Nevada) - Pursuit\n\nRanger John Black made a traffic stop on a truck being operated in a reckless manner on Lakeshore Road at 6:30 p.m. on February 5th. The driver, D.L., 43, of Boulder City, smelled of an alcoholic beverage and could produce neither driver's license, registration nor insurance certificate. When Black told him to turn off the truck's ignition, D.L. instead floored the accelerator, turned off the truck's headlights and fled. Rangers pursued. The chase culminated in the Hemenway Campground when the truck was blocked after it pulled into a campsite. D.L. had to be removed from the vehicle by force and began struggling with rangers. Although Capstun was used, it appeared to have had no effect on D.L.. He was charged with operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol, attempting to elude a police officer, and numerous other traffic offenses. [Van Kuren, LAME, 2/10]\n\nFriday, February 19, 1993\n\n93-74 - Lake Mead (Nevada) - Assist; Burglary Arrests\n\nOn February 8th, park dispatch received a call from Citizens Utilities, a company that operates a microwave within the park near Willow Beach, reporting that a repairman at the site had observed a suspicious vehicle approaching the location after dark with its lights out. Several thefts of solar panels and electronic equipment with a cumulative value of $40,000 had occurred recently at the site. Rangers responded and detained two suspects, who were turned over to the county sheriff's office, which is investigating the burglaries. Physical evidence at the scene included tire tracks and shoe prints; together with the tools the suspects had in their possession, the sheriff's office had sufficient evidence to arrest the pair. The two are prime suspects in thefts of similar equipment from southern California and Montana.

C.K. died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. The death has been ruled a suicide. [John Jones, LAME, 2/24]\n\nTuesday, March 2, 1993\n\n93-92 - Lake Mead (Nevada) - Fatality\n\nVisitors reported seeing a body floating near the cliffs along the North Shore on February 27th. The body was eventually recovered and identified as that of J.M.S., 47, of Las Vegas. A cause of death has not yet been determined, but the presumption is that he died of natural or accidental causes. The location where he was found is a popular swimming area. There were no witnesses to the incident. [John Jones, LAME, 3/1]\n\nFriday, March 5, 1993\n\n93-101 - Lake Mead (Nevada) - Storm Impacts\n\nOn the evening of February 19th, major storms struck the Willow Beach and Katherine Landing areas. Willow Beach received 1.08 inches of rain within a one-hour period, and Katherine Landing received 2.30 inches over a two-hour period. Remote rain gauges \"alarmed\" at Willow Beach, indicating a minimum intensity of .44 inch in a three-minute period. Flood warning evacuation sirens were activated at the 60-unit trailer village, and ranger Kevin Hendricks coordinated the evacuation of 20 trailers and 33 persons. Approximately 18 inches of flood water rushed down Willow Beach Wash, cutting away access roads, drainage channels, and 175 feet of a five-foot- high retaining wall. No injuries were reported. The storm also damaged the Willow Beach access road, and roads and parking lots in Katherine. More than 3,200 square yards of asphalt roadway was lost in the two areas. Storm damage has been estimated at $136,000 for both areas. [Susan Warner, LAME, 3/4]\n\nTuesday, March 30, 1993\n\n93-151 - Lake Mead (Nevada) - Attempted Homicides\n\nAt about 4 p.m. on March 26th, W.I. and J.I., both 57, parked their mobile trailer at Boxcar Cove to go fishing. Their truck and mobile trailer were the only vehicles parked at the location. As W.I. left the trailer on an errand, an unknown male standing outside and to the right of the trailer's doorway immediately shot at him. The first shot missed; the second struck W.I. in his throat, then lodged under the skin on his shoulder. J.I. was struck three times by bullets fired through the trailer door as she attempted to retrieve her husband and close the door. The shooter made one more attempt to kill the couple by firing at them through another window in the mobile home, then fled the scene, escaping before rangers arrived. One of the bullets fired at J.I. entered her chest and exited through her back without hitting any vital organs; a second grazed her skull, and the third shattered a wrist. Doctors expect to release her from the hospital in a few days. W.I. was released, but will return in to have the bullet removed from his shoulder. The assailant is described as a white male between 22 and 25 years old, weighing 160 to 165 pounds and possessing an average build; he's clean shaven and has piercing blue, green or hazel eyes, a dark complexion, and a well-groomed, regular haircut. He was wearing a white tee shirt, a gray or blue unzipped jacket, and blue jeans. The weapon he used was a five- or six-shot revolver, which he fired from his right hand. No motor vehicle or boat was heard upon his getaway. [Mike Blandford, CI, LAME, 3/26]\n\nThursday, April 1, 1993\n\n93-151 - Lake Mead (Nevada) - Follow-up on Attempted Homicides\n\nThe suspect in the shooting of J.I. and W.I. is now in custody. The suspect, a citizen of Scotland, had been visiting this country for several months. When he missed his airplane flight home, he became depressed and drove a rental car to Boxcar Cove to commit suicide. When the I.s arrived, they interrupted his plans, and he took out his anger by shooting them. The man then drove to Barstow, California, where he turned himself in at that city's police department. Investigators Blandford and De Munbrun took his confession on March 30th and were to take him before the magistrate for arraignment yesterday. [Bud Inman, LAME, 3/31]\n\nThursday, April 8, 1993\n\n93-166 - Lake Mead (Nevada) - Diving Fatality\n\nJ.D., 41, of Rio Grando, New Mexico, and a friend spent the afternoon of April 3rd diving in about 50 feet of water 200 feet off the shore of Boulder Beach. While on their way back in, they decided to make one last dive to use up their oxygen. When J.D. failed to surface, his companion made several fruitless rescue dives, then reported the incident to rangers. A park dive team responded; they failed to find J.D.'s body that evening, but recovered it in 30 feet of water at noon the following day. It appears that J.D.'s air ran out, and that he drowned because he was unable to release his borrowed and unfamiliar weight belt. [Scotty Olson, LAME, 4/5]\n\nFriday, April 9, 1993\n\n93-174 - Lake Mead (Nevada) - Boating Fatality\n\nR.N., 34, and his cousin, T.Y., 28, both of Las Vegas, were boating on Lake Mohave early on the morning of April 8th when they decided to head up river. R.N. was at the helm, so T.Y. decided to take a nap. T.Y. awoke to a loud crash and found R.N. bent over the seat, with his legs wedged under the dash. The boat had apparently struck an object; the hull was seriously damaged, and the boat began to sink. R.N. was still conscious and complained that he could not feel his legs. T.Y., who had received minor injuries, was able to put a life jacket on R.N., drag him out of the boat, and bring him to the beach. Several Willow Beach concession maintenance workers arrived at about that time and told T.Y. that they would go nine miles up river to get help. By the time they returned, R.N. had expired. No efforts were made to resuscitate him. A joint investigation by the park and state wildlife officials is underway. [Terri Greene, LAME, 4/8]\n\nThursday, April 15, 1993\n\n93-184 - Lake Mead (Nevada) - Fuel Spill\n\nLate on the morning of April 12th, a 60-foot houseboat belonging to Cottonwood Cove Resort fell sideways off a trailer as efforts were being made to retrieve it from Lake Mohave. Between 100 and 200 gallons of fuel were spilled on the public launch ramp; about 50 gallons apparently reached the lake before a berm was put in place. Absorbent materials were deployed in the water, and fire engines from nearby Searchlight and from the park's Boulder District responded to assist the crew of the Cottonwood Cove engine. The area was closed to public use because of the danger from the fuel and because of the potential for an explosion - the cabin and bow of the boat were filled with gas fumes, while the electrical supply remained connected to a 12-volt battery. The boat was secured, however, and a crane was used to pull it back onto the trailer for removal. Clean-up cost the concessioner about $35,000. [Karen Whitney, LAME, 4/12 and 4/13]\n\nThursday, April 15, 1993\n\n93-185 - Lake Mead (Nevada) - Drug and Weapons Arrest\n\nRangers saw a boat operating erratically on the lake on the evening of April 11th. They stopped the vessel, and, during a consent search for weapons the operator said were on board, came upon 10.6 grams of crack cocaine and a small amount of marijuana. The weapons were found and identified as a 4- 10/.45 derringer and a sawed-off 12-gauge shotgun. The derringer was capable of firing shotgun shells. The boat, a 1977, 23-foot Sleek Craft cabin cruiser with a 454 Chevrolet engine, was seized, and asset seizure/forfeiture procedures have been initiated. [Karen Whitney, LAME, 4/12]\n\nFriday, April 16, 1993\n\n93-186 - Lake Mead (Nevada) - Special Events\n\nPreparations for possible incidents at Lake Mead associated with the verdict in the Rodney King case began on Friday, April 9th, with the arrival of a ten-member Western Region special events team. In addition to augmenting park patrols, team members will assist the Lake Mead staff in providing law enforcement support to Boulder City. Backup support also will be provided for Lake Mead rangers who will staff structural fire trucks in the event of civil disturbances in Las Vegas. Two other ten-member Western Region teams are on six-hour standby - one comprised of rangers, the other of Park Police officers. Las Vegas was the scene of major unrest following the earlier trial, and police intelligence indicates that another siege can be expected. Intelligence recently received from San Diego police indicates that gangs plan on travelling by caravan to Las Vegas to create trouble following the issuance of the verdict. On April 14th, the park received a mutual aid request from Boulder City Police Department to augment its night patrol operation. Rangers have accordingly teamed up with Boulder City officers in their patrol cars. The park is also expecting impacts from a large motorcycle rally named \"Hog Heaven II,\" which is being sponsored in Laughlin, Nevada, at the southern end of the park. The rally began yesterday and will continue through the 18th. Event organizers anticipate over 20,000 participants, including motorcycle enthusiasts and spectators. Gang members and their associates are expected to make up the largest number. Organizers arranged use of a county-administered park within Lake Mead's boundaries to provide camping space for the group. They also have arranged for various vendors and activities, including musical entertainment, games, events, and tatoo parlors. Different motorcycle clubs have reserved floors of rooms in the various Laughlin hotels and casinos (one group alone reserved 400 rooms in one property). Hotels are charging $1,000 per room cash deposit. Reports are that California Highway 62 between Palm Springs and Needles is bumper-to-bumper with motorcycles heading east towards Laughlin. Campgrounds at Katherine are nearly filled. Because many Metro Las Vegas officers have been reassigned to the city, there will be no jail facilities in the Laughlin area during the weekend; park personnel will therefore have to transport any prisoners from the southern end of the park to Las Vegas, a four hour round-trip. A planning meeting of cooperating law enforcement agencies was held yesterday in Bullhead City, Arizona - located across the river from Laughlin, Nevada - in preparation for the motorcycle rally. Incident commander Paul Henry attended along with the park's assistant chief ranger, criminal investigator and Park Police officer. Weekend plans are to cover both of the major visitor-use areas of the park. Four SET members will be assigned to Katherine Landing in the southern end of the park during the rally, leaving six members to augment the staff in the North Shore area. Las Vegas Metro police have also asked the park to help patrol the county-administered park within Lake Mead. [Capt.

A joint investigation between Las Vegas Metro police and park personnel is underway. Christmas Tree Pass Road is an unpaved road located on the Nevada side of Lake Mohave within the Katherine District of the recreation area. [Karen Whitney, LAME, 4/15]\n\nThursday, April 22, 1993\n\n93-186 - Lake Mead (Nevada) - Follow-up on Special Events\n\nNo significant incidents of civil unrest occurred in the park or surrounding area following the announcement of the verdict in the Rodney King trial on Saturday, and Western Region's special events team (SET) was accordingly demobilized the following day. During the period from April 10th through midnight on April 17th, 43 arrests, one drowning death, and 112 significant law enforcement incidents were recorded in the park, including weapons violations and seizures, drug possession, fugitive arrests, larcenies, burglaries, OUI incidents, and gang activity investigations. By comparison, the average is six arrests in a normal week. SET members assisted rangers in the Katherine District during the \"Hog Heaven II\" motorcycle gang rally on Saturday and assisted in 18 arrests within the park, nine of which were felonies. Some of the gangs seen wearing colors within the Katherine area were the Bar Hoppers, Iron Crossmen, Hell's Angels, and Vagos. All gangs left the area at the end of the weekend. All equipment purchased for this operation will be stored at Lake Mead as part of a national cache for use throughout the National Park System. Anyone needing items from this cache should contact WASO Ranger Activities for approval, and it will be shipped from Lake Mead. [Capt. Mike O'Neal, RAD/WRO, 4/19]\n\nThursday, April 22, 1993\n\n93-202 - Lake Mead (Nevada) - Probable Drowning\n\nH.K. and L.H. were boating on Lake Mead on April 4th when they got into a heated argument. H.K., 54, reportedly jumped overboard during the argument and swam away from the boat. L.H. did not immediately report the incident because he believed she was a strong swimmer and was not in danger. He did report her missing later that day, however, and a search was begun. Initial efforts were unsuccessful, but visitors reported her body floating in the lake on April 20th at a point several miles from where she'd last been seen. The coroner is conducting an investigation, but no foul play is thought to have occurred. Alcohol was reportedly a contributing factor. [Terry Greene, LAME, 4/21]\n\nTuesday, May 11, 1993\n\n93-242 - Lake Mead (Nevada) - Illegal Shooting\n\nOn May 7th, rangers found the bodies of 14 burros in the area of Scanlon Wash in the upper end of the park in the Gregg Basin. All had been shot, probably over the previous five days. Investigators climbed in and around ridges in the area on Saturday and found two more bodies. The area over which the animals were scattered is a mile and a half long and three- quarters mile wide; they were from a quarter to a half mile from the lakeshore. The animals were found individually and in small groups over three ridges. All had been shot by someone who was proficient with a high- powered rifle. Rangers hope to contact boaters who used the area last week to see if they can remember seeing anyone or hearing anything in that area during their visit. [Karen Whitney, PIO, LAME, 5/10]\n\nFriday, May 14, 1993\n\n93-256 - Lake Mead (Nevada) - Boating Accident\n\nC.F., wife of Zion superintendent D.F., was seriously injured in a boating accident near Temple Bar on the afternoon of May 11th. When one of the two houseboats being used for a federal managers meeting experienced engine problems, C.F., D.F., and D.M., a resource volunteer, went on 'waverunners' to make contact with the troubled boat. Upon returning, D.F. and C.F. boarded the lead houseboat from the rear. When C.F. attempted to mount the swim platform, her leg was sucked into the propeller. D.F. received minor lacerations while pulling her free. C.F. was given emergency treatment at the Temple Bar fuel docks, then evacuated by Flight for Life helicopter to University Medical Center in Las Vegas, where she underwent surgery. D.F. was treated and released. C.F.'s most serious injury was to her left knee; both bones in her left leg were broken and muscles and tissue were damaged. The surgeon reconnected ligaments to the knee and repaired the bone. C.F. was to undergo further surgery yesterday to flush the area against possible infection and close the wound. She was also treated for cuts in the left thigh, the lower left leg, the right foot, and the lower right calf. Her prognosis is good at this time - at best, her range of motion may be limited; at worst, she may require a knee replacement. She may be able to go home this weekend. [Karen Whitney, LAME, 5/13]\n\nThursday, May 20, 1993\n\n93-268 - Lake Mead (Nevada) - Boat Fire\n\nJust after 8 p.m. on May 18th, rangers received a report of a boat and man on fire at Las Vegas Bay Marina. When they arrived on scene, the boat was fully engulfed in flames, but had been pushed from its mooring slip into open water. The victim, G.B., 41, had third degree burns on his arms, legs, face and head; he was air evacuated to the University Medical Center burn unit, where he is currently listed in critical but stable condition. [Karen Whitney, LAME, 5/19]\n\nTuesday, May 25, 1993\n\n93-279 - Lake Mead (Nevada) - Attempted Homicide\n\nM.H., 35, of Henderson, Nevada, was arrested on May 23rd and charged with attempted murder following an assault on 32-year-old P.S. in Government Wash on May 21st. M.H. was charged with assaulting P.S. with an iron pipe and attempting to drown him by pushing his face under water. According to witnesses, the altercation began as a fist fight. P.S. received serious injuries to his face and skull from the pipe. [Karen Whitney, LAME, 5/24]\n\nWednesday, June 2, 1993\n\n93-304 - Lake Mead (Nevada) - Fatality; Unknown Cause\n\nOn May 31st, friends who went to visit L.G., 50, and R.L., 35, on their 25-foot cabin cruiser beached at Sandy Cove found L.G. dead and R.L. unconscious. Rangers and rescue personnel responded and began CPR on R.L.. She was then taken by Flight for Life to Valley Medical Center, where she was hospitalized in critical condition. An investigation into the incident is underway; foul play, however, has been ruled out. [Mike Blandford, LAME, 6/1]\n\nTuesday, June 8, 1993\n\n93-335 - Lake Mead (Nevada) - Jet Ski Fatality\n\nOn the afternoon of June 6th, a group of jet skiers were performing stunt maneuvers near Sandy Point when two skiers who were crossing boat wakes collided in mid-air. Responding paramedics determined that B.W., 26, of Fountain Valley, California, had suffered a shoulder dislocation. All vital signs were normal. B.W. was evacuated by a Department of Public Safety helicopter to the University Medical Center in Las Vegas, where he subsequently died of massive internal chest injuries. [Scot Olson, Dispatch, LAME, 6/7]\n\nTuesday, June 22, 1993\n\n93-382 - Lake Mead (Nevada/Arizona) - Poaching Conviction\n\nTwo Nevada hunters recently pled no contest to state charges of unlawfully taking an adult ram in the Willow Beach area on the Arizona side of the Colorado River last December. Rangers assisted Nevada, Arizona and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agents in the investigation, which revealed that the two had been hunting legally in Nevada, then crossed into Arizona by boat during the final days of the Nevada sheep season. Arizona hunters who were legally stalking a sheep saw it shot and became suspicious when the hunters gutted the animal quickly, then left the area without tagging the carcass. The site of the kill was later found by investigators and it was determined that the illegal hunters had gone to the extent of moving the gut pile to the Nevada side of the river. Descriptions of the pair provided by witnesses matched descriptions of two hunters who had checked a sheep in at a Nevada wildlife department office on the same day. Conviction on the criminal charges resulted in maximum fines against both men, one of whom had previously been a licensed guide in Nevada. Civil proceedings now in progress may result in a five-year revocation of hunting rights for both individuals and $10,000 in monetary restitution for the value of the 9 1/2- year-old, 167-point ram. [Susan Warner, LAME, 6/18]\n\nThursday, July 1, 1993\n\n93-429 - Lake Mead (Nevada) - Apparent Drowning\n\nR.L., 35, of Long Beach, California, was swimming with a group of 13 of his friends at Crappy Cove near Temple Bar on the night of June 26th when he lost his swimming trunks. He told his friends that he wasn't coming out of the water until he was given a pair of shorts; his friends, however, went back inside their houseboat and continued their party, which involved a great deal of alcohol. When they noticed his disappearance later that evening, they searched the area with boat lights without results. Rangers were notified of the incident the following morning and found R.L. in 14 feet of water, apparently a drowning victim. [Joel Walters, LAME, 6/28]\n\nFriday, July 2, 1993\n\n93-433 - Lake Mead (Nevada) - Drowning\n\nPark VIPs discovered the body of 23-year-old E.M. of Las Vegas in about twelve feet of water at Box Car Cove just after 1 p.m. on June 30th. E.M. was fully dressed in T-shirt, shorts and sneakers, and had apparently been submerged for six to eight hours. It's believed that he may have been boldering, lost his footing and fell into the lake. Identification was made by checking the license plate number on an abandoned vehicle which was found to be his. [Terry Green, LAME, 7/1]\n\nWednesday, July 7, 1993\n\n93-446 - Lake Mead (Nevada) - Drowning\n\nD.K., 60, of Las Vegas was with a group in the Boulder Beach area on July 4th when he went swimming in the lake. D.K., who had been drinking heavily, began struggling about 150 yards from shore, then disappeared under the lake's surface. When efforts to find him proved fruitless, D.K.'s companions contacted rangers. Ranger Malcolm Demunbrun and a Life Flight helicopter responded. The victim was located about ten minutes after Demunbrun arrived, but CPR efforts were unsuccessful.

Boulder Beach Engine Four personnel extricated two victims who were trapped in their vehicles. Three victims who were critically injured were transported by Flight for Life and DPS helicopters, and six others were treated and transported by park and Kingman, Arizona, ambulances. Total emergency units on scene consisted of two helicopters, the two park structural engines, one park rescue unit, the Kingman ambulance, and nine DPS and NPS patrol units.

[CRO, LAME, 7/7]\n\nWednesday, July 14, 1993\n\n93-475 - Lake Mead (Nevada/Arizona) - Drug Lab Seizure; Arrest\n\nOn July 3rd, rangers arrested D.M., 20, of Kingman, Arizona, for possession of drug manufacturing equipment which was found during a probable cause search of his vehicle at South Telephone Cove. A drug dog helped rangers to find a complete portable methamphetamine laboratory, including glassware, cooking reactor, drying system and filtering system. The lab, which was capable of producing up to one pound of methamphetamine per cooking, was unique in that it was operated from a battery park. Recipes and manufacturing instructions for LSD and DMT were also found. The lab is compact and can be operated booth indoors or outdoors.
