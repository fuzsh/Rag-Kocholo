Lombardi Award as Fordham's top male student-athlete, women's basketball's Asiah Dingle, recipient of the Claire and Jack Hobbs Award as Fordham's top female student-athlete, and head women's tennis coach Michael Sowter and head men's basketball coach Keith Urgo, who received the Iron Major Award as Fordham's Co-Coach of the Year.\n\nAdditionally, grad student linebacker Ryan Greenhagen received the Terence O'Donnell Award while DeMorat and senior wide receiver Fotis Kokosioulis were named football co-MVPs. Student manager Emma Kimble received the Kenneally Award and Academic Advisor Sister Anne Walsh was honored with a Celebration of Service award.\n\nThe Vincent T. Lombardi Award is presented to the Male Athlete of the Year for distinguished athletic achievements in the winning tradition of Vince Lombardi. The award honors the memory of one of Fordham's famed Seven Blocks of Granite, who is considered one of football's greatest coaches.\n\nDeMorat, who finished as the runner-up for the 2022 Walter Payton Award (NCAA FCS National Player of the Year), earned his third straight Patriot League Offensive Player of the Year award in 2022. Named to five All-America teams, he completed 326 of 499 passes (65.3%) for 4,891 yards and 56 touchdowns, setting the school single season record for passing yards and touchdowns (also a Patriot League record). He led the NCAA FCS in passing yards, passing yards/game (414.6), and total offense (411.6 yards/game) and was second in passing touchdowns and passing efficiency (180.7). DeMorat also set the school and Patriot League career records for completions (1,032) and passing yards (13,454).\n\nKokosioulis was named the team co-MVP along with DeMorat. A 2022 consensus All-American Kokosioulis had the greatest season for a wide receiver in Fordham history last fall. He set the school record for most receptions in a season (103) and tied the school mark for touchdown catches (14) while his 1,312 receiving yards was third best single season at Fordham.\n\nThe Claire & Jack Hobbs Memorial Award is presented to the Female Athlete of the Year who has achieved outstanding athletic accomplishments. The award is named in honor of the late Claire and Jack Hobbs. Jack was a 1938 graduate of Fordham College and a 1941 graduate of Fordham Law, and he and his wife were avid Fordham followers.\n\nDingle, the 2023 Atlantic 10 Co-Defensive Player of the Year, earned First Team All-Conference and All-Defensive Team honors in 2022-23. She led the Rams to their seventh WNIT postseason appearance as she led the Atlantic 10 in scoring (19.2 ppg) and steals (3.5/game). Dingle ranked fourth in the NCAA in steals/game and broke Fordham's long-standing single-season record for steals (111), setting a program single-game record of 10 steals against Saint Peter's.\n\nSowter picks up his first Iron Major award as the Fordham Coach of the Year after leading the women's tennis squad to its first ever Atlantic 10 title. The Rams defeated three-time defending champions VCU last Sunday to win the championship and move on to their first ever NCAA Championship appearance. Fordham will travel to Charlottesville, Virginia, on Friday to face Princeton in the first round.\n\nUrgo also earns his first Iron Major award in his first year as a head coach. It's not his only Coach of the Year honor as he was also named the Atlantic 10 Coach of the Year as well as the recipient of the Joe B. Hall Award, presented annually to the NCAA First Year Coach of the Year. He led the Rams to 25 wins this year, one shy of the school record, and a second place tie in the Atlantic 10 conference, Fordham's best ever finish\n\nThe night opened with a special recognition of members of the Fordham Community as Martha Hirst, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer at Fordham University, was presented with an honorary letter by Director of Athletics, Ed Kull.
