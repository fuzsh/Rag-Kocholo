        "text": "Fordham University, private, coeducational institution of higher learning in New York City, New York, U.S., and the nearby area. It is affiliated with the Jesuit order of the Roman Catholic Church. The university consists of the original Rose Hill campus in the north Bronx, the Lincoln Center campus in Manhattan, and the Westchester campus in West Harrison. Fordham College and the College of Business Administration (both at Rose Hill) and Fordham College at Lincoln Center are the core of the university’s undergraduate program. Fordham offers master’s and doctoral degree programs in education, the humanities, and the social sciences, and its School of Law awards a doctorate in jurisprudence. Important facilities include the Louis Calder Center–Biological Field Station in Armonk, New York, and the Hispanic Research Center. Total enrollment is approximately 14,500.\n\nFordham University was founded in 1841 by Bishop (later Archbishop) John Hughes. It was originally an all-male undergraduate college in the Bronx and was known as St. John’s College. The School of Law was added in 1905 and moved to Manhattan in 1906. In 1907 the university’s present name was adopted. Thomas More College, a Fordham-founded college for women, opened in 1964 and merged with the university 10 years later."
