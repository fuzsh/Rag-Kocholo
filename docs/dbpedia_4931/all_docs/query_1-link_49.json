        "text": "Actor Emma Watson is probably best known for her roles as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter series and Belle in the live-action Disney adaption of Beauty and the Beast.\n\nIn 2010, Watson joined the Brown University field hockey team. So she majored in English literature in the classroom and majored in kicking ass on the field.\n\nI probably can't list all of Denzel Washington's great movies, so I will leave it at saying he is one of the more recognizable faces in movies.\n\nWhile attending college at Fordham University, Washington played basketball as a guard while he was earning a BA in drama and journalism.\n\nKnown for roles from playing Dan in Roseanne to voicing Sully in Monsters, Inc., John Goodman has had quite the acting career.\n\nBefore he was a household name, he played college football at Southern Missouri State University as a lineman. His collegiate career never really happened due to injuries, so his focus went toward acting, and the rest is history.\n\nLeslie Jones was an SNL darling as far as cast members. Her career as a comedian has even led her to hosting her own shows like Supermarket Sweep.\n\nShe went to Chapman University on a basketball scholarship. Picturing Jones in the paint on defense, that must have been pretty intimidating, especially if she was ready to roast your entire life.\n\nFormer wrestler turned Hollywood movie star Dwayne Johnson has found profitable success on the big screen.\n\nJohnson played college football for the Miami Hurricanes and was on the 1991 national championship team. He went undrafted and tried the CFL, but his calling was in the wrestling ring, where he became \"The Rock\" for the millions...and millions of fans.\n\nI wouldn't have taken Keanu Reeves as a hockey player, but he played at De La Salle College as a goalie. I would hate to see what John Wick could do with an ice skate. Other than John Wick, Reeves has had a very successful acting career throughout his life, from Speed to The Matrix.\n\nIn 1996, Mahershala Ali attended St. Mary's College (CA) on a basketball scholarship. He lost interest in a sports career and turned to theater.\n\nAli has been taking on the film industry by storm since the late 2010s, starring in Moonlight, Green Book (for both films, he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), and is set to lead in Marvel's Blade.\n\n2 Chainz (Tauheed Epps) played basketball for Alabama State University.\n\nBest known for his solo rap career, which took of in 2012, under the name 2 Chainz, he has become one of the more recognizable names in the industry.\n\nJason Sudeikis is best known for his time as part of the SNL cast, but he is also an ex-athlete. He played basketball at Fort Scott Community College.\n\nOnce leaving basketball behind, he turned to improv comedy, which turned into an SNL spot, which then turned into great work in both TV and film.\n\nImagine this man throwing a javelin. Because that is exactly what he did at Oklahoma State University in the early '80s.\n\nWhen he was done throwing javelins, he went on to have an amazing career in country music and is one of the top best-selling artists of all time, having sold more than 170 million records.\n\nYou probably know him from Modern Family, but Ed O'Neill has had quite the career in athletics.\n\nBefore taking on hilarious dad roles, O'Neill played college football at Ohio University and Youngstown State (after transferring). He almost got a spot on the Pittsburgh Steelers roster in 1969, but was up against all-time great \"Mean\" Joe Greene at the same position.\n\nBest known for his roles in Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Everybody Hates Chris, Crews was actually a defensive end for Western Michigan University. He actually bounced around the NFL for a bit before ultimately taking on roles in TV and movies.\n\nBoth monsters from Monsters, Inc. made the list!\n\nBilly Crystal, a hardcore New York Yankee fan, made the baseball team at Marshall University, but never got the chance to play, and instead, attended Nassau Community College.\n\nChanning Tatum attended Glenville State College to play football but eventually dropped out.\n\nHe has found success in acting and is probably most known for his roles in the Magic Mike series and the 21 Jump Street reboot.\n\nBianca Crawford (Belair) was a track star at the University of Tennessee, where she earned All-SEC and All-American. She was also on the SEC's academic honor roll in 2011 and 2012.\n\nNow in the WWE, she is quickly becoming the biggest rising star in pro wrestling.\n\nWeathers played football as a defensive end for San Diego State University. He was good enough to make the NFL in 1970 as an undrafted free agent for the Oakland Raiders. Playing extras in movies eventually led to him becoming quite the star in the '80s.\n\nThe man's been involved in Star Wars, Predator, and Rocky...how can I not love him?"
