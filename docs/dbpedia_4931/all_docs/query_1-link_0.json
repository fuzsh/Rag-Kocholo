        "text": "There are tons of famous people who went to Fordham University. From politicians to athletes and beyond. Here are a few famous faces who attended the UWS school.\n\nAlan Alda\n\nThe award-winning actor was in the class of 1956 as an English major, and was on television before he graduated (performing with his father, Robert Alda). Alan Alda still lives on the Upper West Side, at the Park Millenium at 101 West 67th Street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDenzel Washington\n\nDenzel graduated from Fordham with a bachelors degree in theater in 1977. He served on the school’s board of trustees from 1994 to 2000. He is also known to make appearances on campus on occasion. And, the famous actor has gifted the school generous donations in excess of $2 million. Denzel Washington is also one of many celebrities who’ve purchased apartments at 15 Central Park West.\n\nAmanda Seyfried\n\nAmanda Seyfried was supposed to graduate in 2003, but when offered a role in Mean Girls, she left. That’s understandable.\n\nDylan McDermott\n\nDylan McDermott graduated as a drama major in 1983.\n\nFaith Evans\n\nFaith Evans studied marketing at Fordham in 1991. But, she left after a year to have her daughter with music producer Kiyamma Griffin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid Copperfield\n\nThe famous magician attended Fordham in 1975 at the Rose Hill Campus … for three weeks. Perhaps through an act of magic, he was still allowed to give a graduation speech to the class of 1999.\n\nSusan Lucci\n\nActress Susan Lucci attended Marymount and is a member of the Butler Society. Membership is given to students who have achieved the highest honors. She graduated in 1968.\n\nTaylor Schilling\n\nOrange is the New Black star Taylor Schilling graduated as a theater major in 2006. Afterwards, Schilling went to NYU, but dropped out after two years.\n\nLana Del Rey\n\nPhilosophy major Lana Del Ray graduated from Fordham in 2005. The singer was apparently a bit of a loner."
