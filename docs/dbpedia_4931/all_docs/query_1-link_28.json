        "text": "Fordham Admissions Information\n\nFordham University\n\nBronx, New York (map)\n\nFounded in 1841, Fordham University’s reputation as one of the nation’s top Jesuit universities endures to this day. Currently, the school is comprised of three campuses: Rose Hill, the Lincoln Center campus, and the Westchester campus. A majority of students are enrolled in the Rose Hill campus, which is conveniently located adjacent to the New York Botanical Gardens, the Bronx Zoo and Little Italy on Arthur Avenue. There are train and subway stations within walking distance to the Rose Hill campus which make travel into Manhattan an extremely short trip; in addition, the school offers free daily shuttles to the Lincoln Center campus.\n\nAlthough about 30% of students commute from surrounding areas, nearly 50% of students live in Fordham’s on-campus housing. In addition, the university features over 100 student organizations from Mimes and Mummers, one of the nation's oldest collegiate theatrical groups, to the top-ranked Fordham Debate Society. Furthermore, many students note that the Catholic foundation of the university creates an open forum for discussion of social and moral issues of the world today.\n\nBasic Info\n\nMain Address: East 441 Fordham Road, Thebaud Hall\n\nBronx, NY 10458 Phone Number: (718) 817-1000 Website: www.fordham.edu\n\nCharacteristics\n\nType of school: Private, Coed Type of school: Catholic, Jesuit Setting: Urban setting, Very large city; Residential campus Athletics: NCAA Division I, Intercollegiate, Intramural, Club, Scholarship Degrees offered: Bachelor's, Master's, Post-Master's Certificate, Doctoral Size of undergraduate student body: 7,950 Percent out-of-state: 52% Percent international: 3% Female to Male ratio: 55:45\n\nAcademic Life\n\nStudent to Professor ratio: 12:1 Most popular majors: Biological Sciences\n\nCommunication and Media Studies\n\nPolitical Science\n\nPsychology\n\nEnglish\n\nHistory\n\nEconomics\n\nInternational Political Economy\n\nMathematics\n\nChemistry Special study programs: Distance Learning\n\nDouble Major\n\nESL\n\nHonors Program\n\nIndependent Study\n\nInternships\n\nROTC, Air Force\n\nROTC, Army\n\nROTC, Navy\n\nStudent-Designed Major\n\nStudy Abroad\n\nTeacher Certification\n\nUnited Nations Semester\n\nVisiting/Exchange Student Program\n\nCampus Life\n\nFun Facts\n\nAdmissions Information\n\nWith an acceptance rate of 46% and successful applicants with an average high school GPA of 3.7, Fordham looks for well rounded, academically successful individuals. Much like the Jesuit academic approach, the Fordham application process is based not solely on individual components, but through a holistic review of each applicant.\n\nFactors that are most carefully considered by the admissions committee include: academic record, standardized test scores, letters of recommendation, essays and extra-curricular activities. Fordham offers a non-restrictive Early Action option for students who are interested in receiving an earlier decision. Since this is a smaller pool of applicants, students who choose this option have a slight advantage over Regular Decision applicants.\n\nAdmissions address: Admission Office\n\nEast 441 Fordham Road\n\nOffice of Undergraduate Admissions\n\nBronx, NY 10458-9993 Phone number: (718) 817-4000 Fax number: (718) 367-9404 Admissions Website: http://www.fordham.edu/admissions/ Email: enroll@fordham.edu Contact Person: Peter Farrell, Director of Admissions Number of first-year applications received: 18,161 Percent of applicants admitted: 50%\n\nApplication Information\n\nRegular application deadline: January 15 Early decision/action deadline: November 1 (Early Action) Accepts the Common Application?
