To that end, it reexamines the role that the Chicago school of economics played in developing and propounding a distinct vision of Adam Smith, not only within the profession of economics, but also for the broader American public in the twentieth century. I argue that the readings, teachings, and interpretations of Smith from Chicago economists across different generations are more than just superficial symbolism, claims of intellectual authority, or rhetorical window dressing. Chicago’s engagement with Smith’s ideas constitute important interpretive and substantive arguments about the essence of Smith’s contribution to economics and the role that Smith’s ideas could play in shaping public policy.\n\nType\n\nArticles\n\nInformation\n\nModern Intellectual History , Volume 17 , Issue 4 , December 2020 , pp. 1041 - 1068\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S147924431900009X [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © Cambridge University Press 2019\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.

Following Winch, Haakonssen's, Knud The Science of a Legislator: The Natural Jurisprudence of David Hume and Adam Smith (Cambridge, 1981)CrossRefGoogle Scholar; and Hont, Istvan and Ignatieff, Michael, eds., Wealth and Virtue: The Shaping of Political Economy in the Scottish Enlightenment (Cambridge, 1983)CrossRefGoogle Scholar, explicated the philosophical and natural jurisprudential foundations of Smith's politics. Fleischacker's, Samuel On Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations: A Philosophical Companion (Princeton, 2004)Google Scholar; Hanley's, Ryan Adam Smith and the Character of Virtue (Cambridge, 2009)CrossRefGoogle Scholar; and Rothschild's, Emma Economic Sentiments: Adam Smith, Condorcet, and the Enlightenment (Cambridge, MA and London, 2001)Google Scholar, are also significant contributions that forged a strong connection between Smith's political economy and moral philosophy. Works that have characterized Smith as a serious theorist of politics include Hont, Istvan's lectures on Politics in Commercial Society, ed. Kapossy, Béla and Sonenscher, Michael (Cambridge, MA and London, 2015)CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Herzog's, Lisa Inventing the Market: Smith, Hegel, and Political Theory (Oxford, 2013)CrossRefGoogle Scholar; and Sagar, Paul's recent book The Opinion of Mankind: Sociability and the Theory of the State from Hobbes to Smith (Princeton, 2018)Google Scholar.\n\n2\n\n2 Nicholas Phillipson characterizes Smith in such terms in his recent biography, Adam Smith: An Enlightened Life (New Haven, 2011).

It is believed that surviving student notes from Smith's Lectures on Jurisprudence contain some of the contents that would have appeared in the book on law and government.\n\n4\n\n4 The authoritative and detailed account on this subject is Fleischacker's, Samuel “Adam Smith's Reception among the American Founders,” William and Mary Quarterly 59/4 (2002), 897–924CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n5\n\n5 Bishop James Madison is believed to have taught the first course on political economy in America sometime in the 1780s. Madison used Smith's Wealth of Nations as the primary text, though the exact date at which he introduced it has been disputed.

See Steven G. Medema, “Adam Smith and the Chicago School,” in Emmet, The Elgar Companion to the Chicago School, 40–51. Medema draws up his account based on terms coined by in, Dierdre McCloskey “The Good Old Coase Theorem and the Good Old Chicago School: A Comment on Zerbe and Medema,” in Medema, Steven G., ed., Coasean Economics: Law and Economics and the New Institutional Economics (Dordrecht, 1998), 239–48Google Scholar. Other works that identify this generational break include Smith, “Adam Smith and the New Right”; and Jones, Daniel Stedman, Masters of the Universe: Hayek, Friedman, and the Birth of Neoliberal Politics (Princeton, 2012)Google Scholar. In more recent work, Medema expands on his previous framework by identifying two “turning points” across three generations of the Chicago school. Steven G.

Balisciano, “Hope for America: American Notions of Economic Planning between Pluralism and Neoclassicism, 1930–1950,” in ibid., 153–78. As Balisciano notes (at 155), “In this climate [after the Great Depression], planning developed as a flexible and fluid concept. Forward actions of all kinds were proposed beneath the banner of planning in order, it was hoped, to define, shape, and ultimately improve economic outcomes … Planning was a mirror for the pluralism of American society in the 1930s and thus defied precise definition. As such, it was also a mirror for the pluralism of American economics and American economists during those years.”\n\n24\n\n24 Balisciano, “Hope for America,” 156.\n\n25\n\n25 This is obviously a very simplistic account of the impact of the Cold War on academic economics.

Daniel Hammond, “The Development of Post-War Chicago Price Theory,” in Emmett, The Elgar Companion to the Chicago School, 7–24.\n\n28\n\n28 Milton Friedman's textbook on price theory describes the price mechanism in pieces: “Prices serve as guideposts to where resources are wanted most, and, in addition, prices provide the incentive for people to follow these guideposts. The use of factor prices to distribute the product makes it possible for other prices, namely product prices, to serve the functions of fixing standards and organizing production,” and “Prices … transmit information, they provide an incentive to users of resources to be guided by this information, and they provide an incentive to owners of resources to follow this information.” Friedman, Milton, Price Theory (Hawthorne, NY, 1962), 9–10Google Scholar. Glen Weyl, “Price Theory,” 1, offers the following contemporary definition: price theory is an “analysis that attempts to simplify a rich (high-dimensional heterogeneity, many agent, dynamics, etc.) and often incompletely specified model for the purposes of answering a simple (scalar or unidimensional) allocative question.”\n\n29\n\n29 Weyl, “Price Theory,” 26; Emmett, Ross B., “Introduction,” in Emmett, ed., The Elgar Companion to the Chicago School of Economics (Cheltenham and Northampton, 2010), 1–4Google Scholar, at 2–3.\n\n30\n\n30 Medema, “Chicago Price Theory and Chicago Law and Economics,” 154.\n\n31\n\n31 Jacob Viner, lecture on 17 June 1930 in Economics 301, printed in Jacob Viner: Lectures in Economics 301, ed.

In fact, Mark Blaug's monumental Economic Theory in Retrospect contains several pages of analysis centered on this “simple model in which only one factor of production is used to produce commodities.” See Blaug, Mark, Economic Theory in Retrospect, 4th edn (Cambridge, 1985), 38–9Google Scholar.\n\n34\n\n34 Viner, Lectures in Economics 301, 60.\n\n35\n\n35 Homer Jones, student notes, Econ 301: History of Economic Thought (winter 1934), Frank Knight Papers, Box 8, Folder 10, Special Collections Research Center (SCRC), University of Chicago.\n\n36\n\n36 Student notes (unnamed), Econ 301: Price and Distribution Theory (Summer 1938), Frank Knight Papers, Box 8, Folder 18, SCRC, University of Chicago.\n\n37\n\n37 Student notes dated 6 April 1933 (unnamed), Econ 304: Economic Theory and Social Policy (spring 1933), Frank Knight Papers, Box 8, Folder 4, SCRC, University of Chicago.\n\n38\n\n38 Ibid.\n\n39\n\n39 “The market price of every particular commodity is regulated by the proportion between the quantity which is actually brought to market, and the demand of those who are willing to pay the natural price of the commodity, or the whole value of the rent, labour, and profit, which must be paid in order to bring it thither.” Smith, WN, Book I, chapter 7, 8.\n\n40\n\n40 Jones, student notes, Econ 301: History of Economic Thought.\n\n41\n\n41 Student notes dated 11 April 1933 (unnamed), Economics 304: Economic Theory and Social Policy, Frank H.

Knight repeats this point a number of times: “I may point that a little by saying that I think that the change in name from ‘political economy’ to ‘economics’ is unfortunate.” Gladys Hamilton, a student in Knight's class in 1934, noted the following: “Economic science is political. The change of name was very unfortunate.

He devoted more effort to the presentation of his case for individual freedom than to exploring the possibilities of service through government … But even in his own day, Smith saw that self-interest and competition were sometimes treacherous to the public interest they were supposed to serve, and he was prepared to have government exercise some measure of control over them where the need could be shown and the competence of government for the task demonstrated.” Viner, “Adam Smith and Laissez-Faire,” 232.\n\n60\n\n60 Burgin, The Great Persuasion, 44.\n\n61\n\n61 Friedman's “The Methodology of Positive Economics” (often referred to as F1953 or F53) emphasized the importance of predictive capacity in judging economic theories and is arguably one of the most influential essays on economic methodology in the twentieth century.

Rothschild argues that that Smith's invisible hand is nothing more than a “mildly ironic joke” and something that Smith himself would not have readily accepted as a normatively desirable feature of economic and moral life.
