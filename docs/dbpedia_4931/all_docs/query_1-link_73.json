        "text": "New York Mets manager Willie Randolph delivered the keynote address to the Class of 2007 at Fordham University’s 162nd Commencement on the Rose Hill campus. Fordham University conferred honorary degrees to a television executive, an archbishop, the president of the New York Stock Exchange, a former justice on the South African Constitutional Court and the longtime general manager of the Metropolitan Opera at its 162nd Commencement on the Rose Hill campus.\n\nIn addition to Randolph, the other honorary degree recipients were: William F. Baker, chief executive officer of Educational Broadcasting Corporation, licensee of Thirteen/WNET New York and WLIW21 New York; John L. Damonti, M.S.W. (GSS ’85), president of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation and vice president of corporate philanthropy at the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company; Richard Goldstone, LL.B., former justice of the South African Constitutional Court; Catherine R. Kinney, president and co-chief operating officer of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE); His Excellency Archbishop Celestino Migliore, Apostolic Nuncio, Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations; and Joseph Volpe, senior vice president of Giuliani Partners LLC and former general manager of the Metropolitan Opera.\n\nRichard Goldstone served on the South African Constitutional Court from 1994 to 2003 and in the early 1990s chaired South Africa’s Commission of Inquiry Regarding Public Violence and Intimidation, which helped undermine the system of apartheid. Archbishop Celestino Migliore was nominated Apostolic Nuncio and Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations by Pope John Paul II in 2002. Since his ordination in 1977, he has championed the global fight against the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and campaigned against poverty.\n\nWilliam F. Baker has been at the head of the Educational Broadcasting Company since 1987. Under his leadership, Thirteen created The Charlie Rose Show discussion program, Religion & Ethics NewsWeekly, and the Peabody and Emmy award-winning local series City Arts and City Life. John L. Damonti, GSS ’85, has more than 20 years of experience working in the areas of health policy, community relations and philanthropy. He has been at Bristol-Myers Squibb since 1999, where he leads a major initiative known as Secure the Future, which is the largest corporate commitment of its kinds to address issues related to HIV/AIDS in Africa.\n\nCatherine R. Kinney oversees the New York Stock Exchange’s relationship with member firms and institutions, as well as its listings business and market operations. Willie Randolph was hired as manager of the Mets in 2004 after an accomplished playing and coaching career. In 2006, he guided the Mets to a league-best 97-65 record and the National League East Division title. His daughter, Ciara, a Fordham College at Rose Hill senior, will be among the graduates in May.\n\nJoseph Volpe spent 42 years at the Metropolitan Opera, the last 16 as its general manager. His tenure as general manager is the third longest in the Met’s 124-year history, and he has the distinction of being the only person to have risen through the company’s ranks to its highest executive post.#"
