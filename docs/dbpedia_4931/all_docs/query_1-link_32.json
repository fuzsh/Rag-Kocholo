        "text": "Throughout his life, and throughout his football rise, Joe Moglia’s name has always been tied to Fordham.\n\nIt served as the foundation for the 1967 graduate’s 25 years of coaching — even though he didn’t play collegiate football — that included seven seasons as Coastal Carolina’s head coach and one FCS National Coach of the Year Honor.\n\nIt served as the foundation for his business career when he stepped away from football and became the CEO and Chairman of TD Ameritrade.\n\nAnd before Fordham’s football game against Lehigh University on Oct. 7, the university will officially name its field Moglia Stadium at Jack Coffey Field.\n\n“I loved and always appreciated the education I got from Fordham,” Moglia said in the university’s release Friday. “I’m proud to have been able to have a positive impact on the lives of others, and that all traces back to Fordham. A big part of whatever success I’ve achieved across two career paths is because of the education that I received there.”\n\nFordham president Tania Tetlow added in the release that Moglia, who attended Fordham Prep before college, has always been “closely connected to Fordham and all this institution stands for.”\n\nMoglia also served as the defensive coordinator at Dartmouth, coached defense and special teams at Lafayette College, and also, worked at the high school level before leaving the coaching profession, working at Merrill Lynch for 17 years and then becoming a top executive at TD Ameritrade in 2001, according to the release.\n\nBut then he returned to coaching.\n\nHe held an unpaid position at Nebraska, and then he became head coach of the United Football League’s Omaha Nighthawks.\n\nThat proceeded perhaps the most surprising step of his coaching career, when Coastal Carolina then hired him as its head coach in 2011.\n\nMoglia compiled a 56-22 record across seven seasons before retiring in 2019.\n\nCoastal Carolina then hired him as its head coach in 2011, and he compiled a 56-22 record across seven seasons before retiring in 2019.\n\nHe still serves as a Chair of Athletics, Executive Director for Football and Executive Advisor for the President at the university."
