        "text": "ARHI 1100. Art History Introduction: World Art. (3 Credits)\n\nThis course is an introduction to the study of art history, approached from a global perspective. It reaches back to Cycladic art (c. 3300 to 1100 BCE) and ends with the present. Because most human societies have created art, this course looks at works created in Europe, the Americas, Asia, and Africa. And since art objects can and do move across cultural boundaries, it also looks at the cross-cultural transmission of artworks. Students will learn about how peoples across space and time created works of art and architecture in response to social crisis, as an aid to or container of ritual, and to express norms and ideals of gender. Students will come to understand how and why abstraction and naturalism emerged at different times and places.\n\nAttributes: FACC, FRFA, GLBL, INST, ISIN.\n\nMutually Exclusive: ARHI 1101.\n\nARHI 1101.

Modern Latin American Art. (4 Credits)\n\nIn modern period, Latin American nations, the by-product of European colonization, developed artistic traditions that grew out of their own distinct realities. This course looks at two great shaping forces of modern Latin American Art: nationalism, which called on visual art to both create a national identity and to reflect it; and modernism, an aesthetic movement that insisted on artistic autonomy. In more recent years, the political integrity of Latin American nations has been challenged by oppressive governments and imperialism, leading artists to seek new ways of expressing ideas and identity within and beyond the national sphere. We will also be seizing the many opportunities that New York offers to see Latin American art first hand at sites that include El Museo del Barrio, Sotheby's, and the Cecilia de Torres Gallery.

Global Modern Architecture. (4 Credits)\n\nWhat do we think of when we see such words as “modern,” “modernism,” and “modernity”—especially as they pertain to architecture and the built environment? How can we reinterpret and challenge existing views of these terms when we start from the regions of the world (sometimes called the non-west and the global south) that are home to the majority of the world's people? In this course, we'll examine the production of space in Asia, Africa, and Latin America from the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries as breaks from the past, yet inextricable from the colonial encounter.

Gods, Monsters, Heroes, and Mortals: Narrative in Greek Art. (4 Credits)\n\nIn this course, students will examine the development of storytelling on Greek painted pottery and sculpture. The course is structured thematically, rather than chronologically or by medium, and relies on the study of primary source material, ancient works of art, and literature. This class meets at the Metropolitan Museum of Art every Friday during the designated time of 1 to 2:15 p.m. and at Rose Hill on Tuesday.

Athens and Ancient Greece: Athens and Pericles in the Fifth Century BC \"Golden Age\". (4 Credits)\n\nLong remembered as a political and artistic highpoint in the western traditions of art, architecture, history, philosophy, politics and theatre, this course takes a holistic look at the challenges and opportunities of writing about 5th century BC Athens. Students will analyze a range of writing about Athens, and its most famous statesman, Pericles. Genres from modern scholarship on technical evidence (such as stone inscriptions and archaeological field reports) to 19th century poetry seeking to evoke a lost “golden age” of art and democracy will all inform students’ own writings. This wide range of modern texts and ancient evidence will allow us to consider all parts of Athenian society. A final project will require students to alter their writing for a more general audience, by devising, writing, and shooting a short animated film.

We will study monuments of architecture, sculpture, painting, and the minor arts ranging over more than a millennium and located throughout the Mediterranean. Particular attention will be paid to the social, political, and religious aspects of Greek art, and to how Greek art objects worked in the physical contexts of their display. Special emphasis will be placed on students learning to think and write as art historians.

Ancient Architecture and New York City. (4 Credits)\n\nThis course offers a survey of Egyptian, Greek, and Roman architecture. Students will study structures from the Old Kingdom pyramids to late antique churches, synagogues, and mosques. It uses the many buildings of New York City that draw on ancient architectural traditions to reconstruct how they worked in their own time, and why modern architects and publics still rely on these old formal vocabularies. The course will take two basic approaches to the buildings we encounter. 1) What did the building feel like to use, and what created these effects? 2) How did/does the building support or break down existing power structures? These questions will lead students to understand ancient architecture as a way of making and thinking that still has direct relevance to understanding key social issues of modern-day New York. Students taking the class should expect to spend significant time encountering New York architecture, from war memorials and arches to community spaces and parks. Sketching buildings will be required, but this is not a drawing class, and drawing skill will not be assessed.

Roman Art. (4 Credits)\n\nThis course is a survey of the art and architecture of Rome from the Republican and Hellenistic periods through the era of Constantine (fifth century BCE to fourth century CE). The course tries to understand why and how Roman art changed as Rome itself changed, from a small city-state republic to one of history's largest empires. The course covers the following themes in Roman art: the power of images in the ancient world; the place of monuments, artists, and patrons in Roman society; Roman ways of thinking about art and representation; art as a way to spread or resist Roman imperialism; and the influence of Roman art on almost every later artistic style or movement. The course takes as one of its primary pathways through this material the figure of Cleopatra, from Ptolemaic Egypt through Roman Imperial art to her appearances in contemporary film and media.\n\nAttributes: AHAM, CLAS, OCAH, OCST.\n\nARHI 2320. The Fall of Ancient Rome: A Material Culture Investigation. (4 Credits)\n\nAn interdisciplinary investigation of the period ca. 300—800 AD. The traditional model of Gibbon's \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" will be considered in the light of modern conceptions of \"Late Antiquity\" by scholars such as Peter Brown, who see this as a period of sometimes dramatic cultural and political transformation, defined by the growth of the vibrant new kingdoms of Western Europe, and the development of Christianity and Islam. Using the methodologies of Ancient History, Archaeology, Art History and Classics, the course will consider these two approaches through the lens of material culture. How and why did cities, sculpture, religious art, pottery, textiles, military equipment and luxury goods change during this period, and what do they all reveal about how and why Rome fell—if it did at all?.\n\nAttributes: AHAM, CLAS, MVAM, MVST, REST.\n\nARHI 2341. Medieval Desire and Devotion. (4 Credits)\n\nMedieval Europe was the site of a complex social network built on relationships that crisscrossed heaven and Earth. This course explores how people of divergent status—kings and clerics; men and women; rich and poor; Christians, Jews, and Muslims—used works of art and architecture to draw closer to those whose presence they desired most: God, the saints, and one another. Our investigations will range widely over the period: from the catacombs of late antique Italy to the cathedrals of high medieval France and England; from the courts of early medieval Germany to the cities of late medieval Spain and Flanders. Case studies will include churches, mosques, shrines, reliquaries, and devotional imagery in multiple media—sculpture, panel painting, book illumination—for contexts both public and private. Frequent comparisons between \"sacred\" objects associated with piety and \"secular\" objects associated with pleasure will provide a broader view of the manifold desires that shaped medieval society.

Illuminated Manuscripts. (4 Credits)\n\nBefore the invention of the printing press in the 15th century, every book was a precious, hand-produced object. Often these manuscripts were richly decorated with painting, called illumination. This course examines the development of manuscript illumination over the length of the Middle Ages in Europe (circa 300 to 1500). Issues examined include illuminated manuscripts and the establishment of the church, illumination and royal power, manuscripts and popular devotion, relations between Christians and Jews, and the role of the artist as illuminator. This course includes site visits. Note: Four-credit courses that meet for 150 minutes per week require three additional hours of class preparation per week on the part of the student in lieu of an additional hour of formal instruction.\n\nAttributes: AHAM, MVAM, MVST, OCAH, OCST.\n\nARHI 2365. Medieval Art and the Museum. (4 Credits)\n\nWorks of art from medieval Europe were not made to be seen in museums. The luxurious sculptures, paintings, and manuscripts of the Middle Ages (circa 400 to 1400) mostly were created for the eyes of kings, queens, or priests, and the makers and original users of these objects never could have imagined the diverse museumgoers of today in the U.S. But in the early 20th century, American collectors avidly pursued medieval artworks, amassing the collections that later would be donated to museums like the Cloisters, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Morgan Library & Museum. In this course, students learn about the development of European medieval art (from the end of the Roman Empire through the Gothic era); study the history of museums in Europe and the U.S., with a focus on medieval exhibitions; and consider the meanings medieval art holds for viewers in this country, where every royal or liturgical object serves as a relic of a geographically and temporally remote past. This course includes site visits.

Art and Science in the Middle Ages. (4 Credits)\n\nThis course investigates intersections of art and science from the Carolingian period through the 14th century and the historical role images played in the pursuit of epistemic truths. Science in the Middle Ages included a broad range of intellectual pursuits into both the supernatural and natural worlds, and scholars have classified these pursuits in various ways (i.e., experimental or theoretical science, practical science, magic, and natural philosophy). A particular focus of this course is placed on the assimilation of Greek and Islamic scientific advances in cartography, cosmology, and optical theory into the Latin theological tradition.

Northern Renaissance Art. (4 Credits)\n\nNorthern Renaissance art draws inspiration from the cultural and social developments of the early modern era (circa 1400-1600). Painters strove to depict the bustling energy of expanding cities, sculptors fabricated dynamic ensembles aimed at making tangible the subtleties of church doctrine, and illuminators and printmakers created precious and personal works that enhanced the domestic sphere. In this course we will explore such phenomena, considering how masters—including Jan van Eyck, Albrecht Dürer, and Hieronymus Bosch—experimented and innovated in an age of artistic revolution.

Gender and Sexuality in Renaissance Art. (4 Credits)\n\nThis course explores the role of gender and sexuality in the art of the European Renaissance. We will consider how the visual arts both constructed and reflected ideals of feminine and masculine identity, homosocial relations, and erotic desire. Investigating the roles and identities of women and men as patrons, creators, viewers, and subjects of early modern art, we will also consider discourses of feminism, gender, and sexuality both in the early modern period and in contemporary academic practice.

Renaissance Portraits. (4 Credits)\n\nIs a picture really worth a thousand words? What can the record of a person’s physical appearance tell us about his or her character, and the values of his or her society? During the Italian Renaissance, portraits were test-cases of artistic skill, tools in marriage negotiations, and vehicles for the expression of friendship and political power. This class will consider the role of portraiture in defining, communicating, and preserving individual identity. Examining the concepts of “portrait” and “self-fashioning” in both the literary and visual spheres, we will read authors including Castiglione and Machiavelli, and study artists including Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael.

Renaissance Centers. (4 Credits)\n\nCovering the period from 1400-1600, this course examines the concept of the \"Renaissance\" in artistic production and reception in a variety of European centers. We will consider the role that different forms of government and styles of social life played in the development of Renaissance art in Italy and in its reception outside the traditional \"centers\" of the Italian Renaissance art. The course aims both to offer a comprehensive survey of fifteenth and sixteenth century Italian art and to provide an in-depth analysis of particular centers, both urban and courtly. Topics that will be covered include antiquarianism, the role of religious institutions, private patronage, the impact of political change on artistic practice, and the concepts of \"center\" and \"periphery\" in defining the Renaissance.

(4 Credits)\n\nThis course surveys artistic developments in Europe in the Seventeenth Century and their relationship to the shifting political and intellectual landscape. The art of the Baroque is characterized by an interest in emotional appeal, visual immediacy, and the articulation of power. Major artists include Caravaggio, Bernini, Velázquez, Rubens, Poussin, Rembrandt, and Vermeer. The themes we will explore include the relationship of art production and reception to the political and religious environment, the development of national styles, the intersection of art, nature and science, and the emergence of academies as systems for artistic training and political control. In addition to introducing students to the visual arts of the Seventeenth Century, this course will emphasize the critical analysis of works of art and of art-historical scholarship.

Museums from Revolution to Restitution (1793-present). (4 Credits)\n\nThis course considers the past and future roles of museums in our global society. Beginning with the founding of the Louvre in the wake of the French Revolution, we will explore the relationships between museums, their collections, and their diverse publics—people who build them and work in them, the artists whose works they display, the audiences who visit them, and the communities they surround. Issues examined include theories of collecting; the practices and ethics of exhibition; empire and nation-building; colonial theft and restitution; and forms of institutional critique and anti-colonial action. This class will incorporate site visits to institutions in Manhattan and the Bronx.

Art and the Black Atlantic. (4 Credits)\n\nThis course considers the circulation of art and material culture between Africa, the Americas, and Europe from the early modern era to our current moment of globalization. Of central focus is the ways art makes space for understanding situations of diaspora, enslavement, empire, and redress that have shaped the Black Atlantic world. Students will engage a variety of works across media as well as literature on the conceptual and historical formation of the “Black Atlantic” to reflect on the ways members of the African diaspora have negotiated questions of belonging, retention, loss, and identity through artistic practice across time and space.

London Monuments: Power, Protest, and Public Space. (4 Credits)\n\nFor centuries, London was the seat of the British Empire, which spanned all corners of the globe and perpetrated devastating histories of colonialism, violence, and enslavement. Today, it is one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse cities in the world, a reality linked to its imperial past. In this course, students explore how these intertwined histories are made visible in the built environment, with specific focus on the city’s many monuments—from the statue-filled halls of Westminster Abbey to high-profile commissions by contemporary artists including Yinka Shonibare, Kara Walker, and Lubaina Himid. Why and for whom are monuments important? How have they been used to assert political and social power? And how do audiences and publics respond to, protest, and refuse their presence today? Put simply: What is at stake in the construction of a monument, or conversely, its toppling? We will examine these questions through a series of object-based case studies and in-person site visits in order to better understand the place of monuments in modern life: in relation to the afterlives of colonialism and slavery, and, more urgently, the promise of more equitable anti-colonial futures.

Although the term Asian American is itself relatively new, having emerged through activist movements in the 1960s, work by artists of Asian descent has long circulated in the Americas, from the 1565 opening of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon trade onward. This class explores the diverse histories of Asian American art in what is now known as the United States, across a range of topics and themes, including mercantile trade networks and “export art”; immigration, exclusion, and diaspora; Orientalism; World’s Fairs; modernism, abstraction, and postmodernism; and popular culture. Throughout, we will pay special attention to the work of Asian American artists in New York, both historical and contemporary, with visits to museums, galleries, and studios in the city.

Museum Architecture. (4 Credits)\n\nHow does architecture support (or undermine) the museum’s goals to display objects for the public and preserve these objects for the future? Is the museum building a monument or a type of public infrastructure, and who should pay for it? What new considerations for museum design have emerged in the face of climate change? In this course, we’ll explore these questions through a historical analysis of museum design, connecting the construction of cutting-edge spaces to a longer tradition of building public museums. We will pay special attention to museums in New York City, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim, the American Museum of Natural History, and the National Museum of the American Indian. We’ll also consider buildings that no longer exist, such as the former home of the American Folk Art Museum, and buildings that have housed the collections of multiple institutions, such as the Breuer building, to practice reading architecture to better understand museums and their varied missions.

Architecture and the Environment. (4 Credits)\n\nHow has the natural environment shaped the design of the human-made environment? How have buildings, in turn, been constructed to mitigate unwanted climatic effects and provide comfort to their inhabitants? Most pressingly, how should the construction industry respond to the climate crisis? In this class, we will examine the history of architecture not as a series of stylistic developments, but in relation to structural and mechanical technologies of climate control. We’ll trace how fossil fuels transformed how we build, and the complicated histories of passive design, alongside a discussion of how thinkers from ancient times to the present have connected climate with what it means to be human, to understand the politics, economics, and cultural features of environmentally responsive design.

Art and Architecture of Rome. (4 Credits)\n\n(Course to be offered as part of Fordham's study abroad program in Rome.) Rome once ruled the entire Mediterranean world, and its cultural legacy looms large in Western civilization. At the heart of this legacy is the city that gave its name to the ancient empire. For almost two thousand years, Rome has been more than a literal place—it is an icon of culture, expressing many different characters depending on the era. In the ancient world, the city epitomized the earthly splendor of Roman civilization. In the Medieval period, its political importance waned, and the city was reduced to a symbolic, spiritual center—the city's decaying pagan edifices signaling the triumph of Christianity. In the Renaissance, humanists and the papacy sought to reclaim the city's classical past and rework it into a new vision of the city as both spiritual and temporal \"caput mundi\" (head of the world). This course will examine the art, architecture, and culture of three epochs of the city's history—ancient, medieval and Renaissance/Baroque—through the lens of its monuments. Indoor class time will be minimal and our primary mode of exploration will be site visits.

Age of Cathedrals. (4 Credits)\n\nGothic cathedrals were the skyscrapers of the Middle Ages. These impossibly tall and profusely decorated buildings were center points for urban life in northern Europe between circa 1150 and 1400. This course explores the architectural innovations behind the Gothic style as well as the extensive adornment of Gothic structures (especially sculpture and stained glass) and objects that were used in them (such as illuminated manuscripts and metalwork) in relation to their sacred, political, social, and economic meanings. Issues examined include the technology of Gothic architecture, the use of images to shore up the power of the church, images and the social status of women, relations between Christians and Jews, and encounters between Europeans and Africans. Site visits will be included when possible.

Michelangelo. (4 Credits)\n\nThis course surveys the life, times, and works of Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564). We will trace his development from his origins in fifteenth-century Florence to his role as the leading artist of sixteenth-century Rome and his ultimate fate as the “divine” artist memorialized by Giorgio Vasari. Our primary goal is to examine his major projects in painting, sculpture, and architecture, and analyze the social, artistic, political, and religious context that informed their production and reception. Throughout the course, we will be attentive to the “myth of Michelangelo” promoted by his principal biographers, Giorgio Vasari and Ascanio Condivi, and by the artist himself. We will test their histories of Michelangelo’s career against evidence drawn from other sources, including contemporary documents and modern scholarship.

(4 Credits)\n\nUsing the art galleries, museums, and artists' studios in New York City as field sites, this course provides an introduction to the theoretical and practical aspects of contemporary art and exhibition design. In recent decades, enormous shifts have occurred in exhibition practices as art itself changed from objects on display, to protected images on the walls of the museum, to temporary installations outdoors, and eventually moved into virtual reality. We will study an array of contemporary exhibition, museum installations, art fairs, international biennials, and websites. During this seminar, we will examine how issues such as patronage, the art market, globalization, identity politics, and environmental and social justice issues have brought museums and other exhibition spaces into question. We will be meeting with a range of artists and art professionals. During the term students will create a virtual exhibition. The process of building this online exhibition will equip students with several skills, including writing for a public audience, the creation of effective and informative wall labels and educational programming, visual and digital literacy, and a basic understanding of copyright law and fair use guidelines.\n\nAttribute: AHMO.\n\nPrerequisites: ARHI 1101 or ARHI 1102 or ARHI 1103.\n\nARHI 4230. Art and Ethics: Articulating Function in the Visual Arts. (4 Credits)\n\nThis course will examine the inter-disciplinary dialogue between art and ethics. What exactly do the terms \"art\" and \"ethics\" denote... and connote? Can one nudge the terms together into some kind of binary concept, like \"ethical art\" or \"artful morality\" (!)? Or do these terms relate at some other, deeper level, with a common ontological foundation? In the course of the semester, we will consider the relationship between art and ethics, as they have surfaced in philosophy, in theology, in history, in the history of art, and in art criticism from antiquity to the present era.

Art and the Second World War. (4 Credits)\n\nThis upper-level art history seminar will examine the production, circulation, and reception of art about World War II in Europe, North America, and Asia. We will look at paintings, sculptures, posters, and architecture from Germany, Italy, Russia, Japan, and China from the 1930s and 1940s, and analyze them in relation to the ideologies of fascism, anti-fascism, and communism. We will also scrutinize images that represent the violent consequences of the global conflict, such as the Holocaust, the Nanking Massacre, comfort women (sex slaves managed by the imperial Japanese government), and the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Questions will include how we define propaganda and what it looks like; what kinds of messages art tried to propagate; what artistic styles and theories were employed; what our ethical responsibilities are in dealing with artworks that served to justify violence; and what we can learn from the art to be mindful about propaganda today. Through discussions of artworks from the most turbulent and globally devastating period of the 20th century, this class will consider the moral dimensions of art appreciation.
