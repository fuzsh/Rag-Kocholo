        "text": "Adam Smith is remembered today as the author of An Inquiry into the Natures and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. As a consequence, he is hailed globally as the founder of modern economics. Remarkable though this reputation is, there was more to Adam Smith than a single book.\n\nHis importance as a moral philosopher is now far better understood through recent study of The Theory of Moral Sentiments. His other works, on the nature of justice, science and the expressive arts, are also recognised as major contributions to Enlightenment thought.\n\nThere is also far more to the man than the selective use of the more contentious passages of The Wealth of Nations might suggest. As his other works show, Smith did not simply believe in the primacy of manâ€™s selfishness or in the purity of free markets. The ideas he explores and the conclusions he draws are far more complex, realistic and humane.\n\nOf the thousands of words Adam Smith wrote, perhaps one sentence best serves to express something of his own philosophy, and to temper the more extreme interpretations of his supposed legacy:"
