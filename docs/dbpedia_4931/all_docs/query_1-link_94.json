        "text": "At Fordham, you’ll receive a rigorous education in New York, one of the world’s greatest cities. Students choose from over 70 majors and minors and complete a core curriculum that spans science, literature, history, theology, philosophy, and the arts. Fordham has two residential campuses: Rose Hill, adjacent to the New York Botanical Garden and the Bronx Zoo; and Lincoln Center, in the cultural heart of Manhattan near Central Park. Fordham is a Jesuit university. That means our students are encouraged and prepared to strive for excellence in everything they do, care for others, and fight for justice.\n\nAt Fordham, community engagement helps forge the person you become. We hear it all the time from our alumni and current students: Fordham gives them the tools to make a positive change not only in themselves but also in the world around them. Learn more about how Fordham builds bridges between its campuses and neighboring communities through the Center for Community Engaged Learning."
