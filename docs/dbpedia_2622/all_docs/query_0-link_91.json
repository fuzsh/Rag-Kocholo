        "text": "When children are scared by a storm, afraid of the dark, or wake up from a bad dream, how can parents remind them of God’s protection and love? In Angels on Your Side: When You’re Feeling Scared best-selling children’s author Marty Machowski addresses children’s fears and anxieties with a simple, relatable story, reassuring them with the good news that God is always present and has sent his angels to protect us.\n\nIn this interview, we talk to Marty about some of the things that make this book very special.\n\nQ: Being afraid of the dark is a common childhood fear. What inspired you to write a book for children who are scared of the dark?\n\nDuring Christmas time, families will put an elf on the shelf who is watching over the behavior of the children leading up to Christmas. We all know, of course, that this fun tradition has no basis in reality. But God is watching over us, and he sends his angels as his agents in that endeavor. Few children know what the Bible teaches about angels. So, I decided to write a book to teach them about God’s ministering spirits.\n\nQ: Were you or any of your kids afraid of the dark when they were young? I’m sure you have some stories to share.\n\nMost children go through a time where they are afraid of the dark. I can remember my kids asking, “Can you leave a light on?” There is something about the dark that is scary. Conversely, there is something about the light that is reassuring. The Bible teaches that darkness hides evil while light exposes evil. When it comes to being alone, nobody likes the dark, where evil lurks.\n\nQ: There is something very special about Angels on Your Side. What makes it unique from any other book you have written?\n\nRommel Ruiz, the illustrator, used a 3-D format to highlight the supernatural side of the angels he depicted in the story. That makes this book different from any other I’ve written in the past.\n\nQ: Introduce us to the story told in Angels on Your Side.\n\nLogan goes to spend the night at his grandparents’ home when a thunderstorm blows in. The thunder and lightning scare Logan who calls out for his Grandpa. Grandpa comes in and comforts Logan with the truth that we don’t need to be afraid because God controls the storms and sends his angels to watch over us. But Logan doesn’t think angels are real. When Grandpa tells Logan that the Bible is full of stories about angels, Logan seizes the opportunity to ask Grandpa for a story and keep Grandpa close till the storm passes. It is in these Bible stories, retold by Grandpa, that Logan learns about God’s angels.\n\nQ: What stories from the Bible does Grandpa tell Logan? How is the last story that Grandpa tells different from the others?\n\nGrandpa tells three stories about God’s angel army. The first is the story of Elisha and the angels that appeared on the hills when King Aram came to attack (2 Kings 6). The second story is the day God’s angel army appeared to the shepherds to announce the birth of Christ (Luke 2). But the third story is about the day when God did not send his angels (Matthew 26). That of course, is the crucifixion of Jesus. Jesus could have called down God’s angel army in his defense. But he did not call them, and God the Father did not send them. Why didn’t Jesus call for help? He went to the cross willingly for our salvation. Jesus refused the angels so that he could take our punishment, and we could be saved.\n\nQ: What are some misconceptions kids (and even adults) have about angels? What does the Bible say about angels?\n\nWhen people think about angels, they often think of cupid-like creatures with bows and arrows that live on the clouds or they might picture women with wings. But God’s angels are mighty and are all depicted as men in Scripture. Angels are powerful messengers that can appear as glorious creatures with wings or appear as humans that seem like you or me. In fact, the Bible tells us that we should look for opportunities to show hospitality for some have welcomed angels as guests without even knowing (Hebrews 13:2).\n\nQ: Do you believe angels take a present and active part in our lives today?\n\nThere is no reason to think that God has retired his angel army. God’s angels are at work continually praising him in heaven, and they are on assignment to watch over and protect his children, just as they have from days of old.\n\nQ: What special connection do you have to Logan in the story?\n\nShortly after I wrote the book my son, Noah, and his wife, Emilee, had their first son and named him Logan. I chose a different name originally, but the editors liked the name, Logan, and changed the character’s name right about the time I learned that was my new grandson’s name. This August, I was able to read Angels on Your Side to my grandson, Logan, who is soon to be three years old. It was fun to share the story. He loved that he and Grandpa are both characters in the book!"
