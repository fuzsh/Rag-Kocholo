        "text": "Building a House United\n\nPEW RESEARCH CENTER, JUNE 2022\n\nThe Challenge We Face\n\nAs we separate into groups that increasingly do not even know, or interact with, people of differing opinions, we lose trust in our institutions, eroding the ability to govern ourselves and lowering the caliber of citizenship.\n\nThis growing trend coarsens public debate, produces policy gridlock, shrinks our capacity for goodwill, and harms our family and personal relationships. Effective self government depends precisely on what this type of polarization destroys.\n\nWe believe the American Experiment can survive and thrive for every American who contributes to the effort.\n\nWhere we go from here is up to us.\n\nThis is the driving force that fuels our mission.\n\nOur Mission\n\nBring Americans together to bridge the partisan divide and strengthen our democratic republic.\n\nOur Vision\n\nWe envision an America with respectful embrace of political disagreements, where civic friendship flourishes and competing perspectives strengthen our nation.\n\nEmbracing values of respect, humility, honesty, and responsible citizenship, our goal is not to change people’s views of issues, but to change their views of each other.\n\nOur Approach\n\nAs individuals, we try to understand the other side's point of view, even if we do not agree with it.\n\nIn our communities, we engage those we disagree with, looking for common ground and ways to work together.\n\nIn politics, we support principles that bring us together rather than divide us.\n\nThe Braver Angels Rule\n\nWe’re guided by the rule that Red and Blue leaders are equally represented at every level of organizational guidance. Our members range from working class to affluent and come from many backgrounds. Our constant striving is to be an organization reflective of the country we seek to serve.\n\nPrevious slide\n\nNext slide\n\nThe Braver Angels Way\n\nWe state our views freely and fully, without fear.\n\nWe treat people who disagree with us with honesty, dignity and respect.\n\nWe welcome opportunities to engage those with whom we disagree.\n\nWe believe all of us have blind spots and none of us are not worth talking to.\n\nWe seek to disagree accurately, avoiding exaggeration and stereotypes.\n\nWe look for common ground where it exists and, if possible, find ways to work together.\n\nWe believe that, in disagreements, both sides share and learn.\n\nIn Braver Angels, neither side is teaching the other or giving feedback on how to think or say things differently.\n\nIgniting a Civic Renewal Movement\n\nAmerica’s polarization crisis has been building for decades and is now deeply rooted in our major institutions. Turning the tide is an enormous task; it requires repair in citizen-to-citizen relationships in a nation of 260 million adults, as well as meaningful changes in the rules and practices of many of our major institutions.\n\nNo single organization, no matter how successful, will be powerful enough on its own to heal the divide. If our aim is truly to strengthen our democratic republic, our only practical strategy is to help ignite and shape what scholars and others call a social movement, and what we call a Civic Renewal Movement."
