        "text": "There is a rule in headlines, and joke that is hard to forget: if a headline ends in a question, the answer to that question is almost certainly ‘no’. Is this the next big thing? No. Can this one trick save your life? No. Did he really say this? No.\n\nSo, is Angels Before Man by rafael nicolás a quality angel book, the kind I a certified Angel Champ, can love? Well. It’s not no, but it’s not yes. It’s sort of a strange something else, and we’ll see where I land as I strangle these thoughts out.\n\nI should note, I got this book for free to review. I should also note I actually bought the book a few weeks before I received it. Does this mean my review is at all impacted? I don’t know, but it’s fittingly in between, fittingly funny for this odd book.\n\n…because the angels had only known goodness to be obedience, they did as told.\n\npg 307\n\nThe Premise and the Writing\n\nThe story of Angels Before Man is evident right in the title- Angels, Before Man. It is the story of Lucifer and his fall from grace according to the Bible. With that in mind, there is not much to the story to spoil beyond its different take on the tale: it is primarily from the perspective of Lucifer, from birth to fall, and also centers on a love story between him and Archangel Michael.\n\nThe book itself is split into two halves, with one being a gentle and sunny coming of age- Lucifer born, living in the society of Heaven and learning about himself as he grows close to Michael. The second half is very different, so much so the introduction to the book warns it is not necessary. I wonder how many people can stand to read only the first half of a book they have open before them, but the warning is sufficient: by the end, the paradise of the first half fully transforms into a bloody hellscape of violence and chaos. This is fitting, but it is a sharp contrast, and the two warring halves are where much of my conflict about the book lays.\n\nYou see, Angels Before Man is a great angel book, but I’m not sure it’s a good book book. The pacing is extremely slow and the story increasingly muddled. Part of this is the writing: it is extremely poetic to the degree I fear it is too poetic, with every scene bloated by rambling musings and fractured thoughts. By the end the writing resembles the broken mental state of Lucifer, and following what is going on is increasingly a chore. Yes, it reflects the emotions and some of the words are lovely, but no, it does not deliver the story particularly well. Much of the book is lost beneath this endless tide of vibes and stray thoughts, stretching out every scene and action.\n\nI don’t know if I am describing it well, which is the issue. I understand this kind of poetry/prose mix is simply not my cup of tea, but even for fans of the style I suspect the book lays it on too thick. It’s like wading through honey, to copy some of the poetic language: everything is slow and sweet, but hard to push through, and after a while it begins to all sound the same. Especially when all that fancy language is built around scenes where characters talk or action happens- it’s extremely easy to not know what is actually happening in scenes because everyone is so lost in thought. Words like this were made to be quoted in short form, but this is a full length novel, and the honey flow never stops. Let’s see if I can find an example:\n\n“But will you do as I say?” ‘Gabriel, the eternally youthful angel. He is too full of optimisn – spends all his time laying over the clouds with the wonder of someone who has just met the sky.’ Raphael remebered all those million times he’d awoken over his desk, having fainted from exaustion, with a blanket curiously draped over his shoulders. Gabriel had never admitted it was him, but Raphael caught him once, slipping out of the room after tucking a pillow beneath Raphael’s head. “Hm?” ‘He is the kindest angel, and one can’t be too kind, right? Perhaps he is correct. All will be well again. There is nothing to worry about.’\n\npg 275\n\nThis segment is squashed between the viewpoint of Lucifer, and that in itself is one of the largest issues. While the majority of the time the story is from Lucifer’s third person perspective, in later chapters it begins to freely hop about to various other characters, often in the middle of chapters. At points this is used to great effect to draw contrast between two conflicting scenes, but very often it will only be a for a paragraph or two then move on. There’s no scene break differentiating the jumps, making it sometimes unclear who we are following and what is happening. Worsening that, the book is full of- increasingly- thoughts. The thoughts are all written in single quote marks, often directly after double quotation mark dialogue. All of it then leads to many paragraphs where the writing feels like a slurry in a bad way rather than an artistic haze.\n\nAt plenty of points the prose is mighty fine though. There’s lots of lovely metaphors and flowey language, plenty of imagry in particular around fruit and flowers that lead to Heaven feeling as lush and grand as it is meant to. It can be a bit tiring if you aren’t wild about nonstop vivid prose, but usually it’s pretty and fitting. Heaven feels like the sort of place that justifies endless flittering prose, and we are in Heaven.\n\nLet’s talk about that more.\n\nPlot\n\nThis book is set in Heaven, where time has no meaning and nothing quite exists. Eden is God’s private garden where he sits upon his throne, and Earth is newly made and full of dinosaurs. There are thousands of angels who live happily in Heaven, filling endless days with anything at all: they discover what they are the angel of and do it, creating art, games, and music, harvesting food and brewing wine, playing games in the colousseum of relaxing in the bathhouse. Some go down to Earth on God’s order, or visit Eden to sing him praise, while others place stars across the sky. It is a true paradise, where everyone is happy and thankful to have been made and given such a life.\n\nLucifer is the newest born angel and he is beautiful. All angels clamour to just gaze upon him, which makes him frettfully shy. He is called the angel of beauty but knows this is not his true purpose, especially because he finds himself almost ashamed of his stunning appearence. He lives with Rosier, the angel of fruit, and befriends Asmodeus, the angel of friendship. All of Heaven is eager to get to know Lucifer, as this is before bad feelings properly have been invented. Lucifer’s coming of age, as it were, is the center of the first half of the novel: very little happens otherwise. It’s a slow, fluffy, slice of life in Heaven.\n\nWhile I found myself at times a bit miffed by the slowness, this part of the book is great. It’s everything, really: I love angels, I’m the chief and champ of loving angels, and this is what I wanted. Books about angels and angel society from the viewpoint of angels, people who aren’t people acting as people. You know? Does that make sense? The characters are not wholly distinct at points, but all very sweet, and all of Heaven feels warm and serene. It fits and it works, and it’s good.\n\nLucifer sees Archangel Michael one day and is immediatly fixated on him, wanting to get to know him. When Lucifer eventually embraces music and performance, leading all of Heaven in a song of worship, Michael notices him. The two meet and immediatly bond: Lucifer becomes the angel of worship, soon called to visit God every day, and Michael his closest friend. That closeness is a near obsession, but really more the first sparks within Lucifer of desire. Romance and sex do not yet exist, but Lucifer wants Michael in ways he can’t figure out and has no word for.\n\nThe book does though. I should note, and it’s fine, it is, but man: this is the horniest writing I’ve ever read. Boy. This book writes about fruit like it is sex, and in general brims with like. Wet, sloppy homoeroticism. Which is part of the point, but gee.\n\nThe same seraph held in his hand a new fruit, denser, crisp and gleaming beneath the relentless radiance of God. When he brought it to the cherub’s mouth, he anticipated the same motions as before. Instead, he found the newborn opening his mouth wantonly, willingly, blind, at the mere brush of fruit against his lips, still dadded with the juice of the previous one. There was no need for coaxing this time; the cherub closed his mouth around a bite and swallowed it whole.\n\npg 13\n\nThe primary story of the first half of the book is just Lucifer and then Michael, and their start of a sort of romance. It doesn’t look or feel much like romance in many ways, but then it is the first ever love story. So we can’t complain much. There is little that happens and little sign of trouble, and by the end it is a sweet novella with a cozy atmostphere.\n\nBut then we have the second part. It gets strange. It’s hard to really, again, draw out a direct plot and it takes a while for there to definitely be one. Lucifer begins to have troubling dreams of a monstrous beast and attacks his friend Rosier when waking up one day. He goes to pray, and God tells him he is the Beast and rips him apart. Lucifer is rendered mute and traumatized by the event, still growing closer to Michael. There begins to be signs of trouble and doubt within Lucifer, but it’s a slow burn. Lucifer’s shyness melted away thanks to Michael’s support, but he begins to instead become vain, staring at his reflection for hours and realizing how it gives him control over other angels.\n\nLucifer’s relationship with Michael continues to deepen, including kissing, though it is still an ill defined thing. Lucifer has been lacking in his once exobrient worship of God, who calls him to Eden. While there, Lucifer is still slightly defiant rather than full of love, and God berates him and then rapes him. Yes, it is not seen but a rather clear plot point which happens.\n\nLucifer is left deeply traumatized and begins to self mutilate, in general now on a sharp mental decline. He is extremely codependent on Michael and their relationship as he continues to show erring behaviour. At a party, he teaches one young angel to steal and begins thinking that is he so perfect he may be better than God. He steals a bird from Eden and gathers a number of angels, ordering them to kill it and feel that power. He begins to fully realize how much power he has in his beauty and how much control it gives him over others. He continues to invent sin, and various sins, at another party gathering his followers and teaching them about sex, which turns then into an orgy.\n\nMost everyone is worried about Lucifer’s behaviour, but no angel has ever been like this, so no one quite knows what to do. Michael adores Lucifer, but feels rather torn as he grows more erratic. Asmodeus runs from the orgy and attempts to rape Rosier, who accidentally tears him into bloody pieces. Lucifer gathers his followers and calls for revolution and that God is not a fair one and an angel as king would be better. He is pleased when his followers all agree he would make the best king, and he orders them to tear apart Heaven.\n\nHeaven descends into a mess of chaos and destruction and sin as a third of all angels follow Lucifer’s orders. What the majority do is unclear, as the rebels run rampent, but perhaps it is a case that they do nothing as violence has never existed before and they do not understand what is meant to be done about it.\n\nLucifer finds Michael and asks he join him, wanting Michael by his side forever, but Michael can’t believe what is happening and rejects him. Lucifer and his followers gather the archangels and continue to do wild violence. Night is over Heaven for the first time and it seems like God has abandoned them, but then it begins to rain blood. The rebels prepare weapons and to seize the throne of God. Lucifer lies that Michael has accepted his new reign, and hopes Michael will eventually come around once God is dead.\n\nLucifer and the rebels storm the throne of Heaven. It doesn’t go particularly well, especially when Michael appears to fight Lucifer. Michael cries, but does what he is told, cutting off Lucifer’s wings and throwing him down so that God can cast him away. The other rebels stand by and ask to fall and join Lucifer.\n\nGod declares that with this rebellion, Heaven as they knew it is over. He says he now plans to make humanity, and as punishment the angels will have to serve humans and never have Heaven again. On Earth, the fallen angels now lurk about. The End.\n\nYou can see the sharp contrast even in this pretty blurry summary of events. One is a daydream, one is a nightmare, though it takes a long time for the second part to properly devolve even into that. Unlike a lot of books, I don’t feel like the brutal violence was childish- often it feels like that, like an author wanting to bash out some teenage angst into acts of atrocity. But it still didn’t quite work for me either. As much as I wanted it to be a tragedy, the cast was warm but interchangable, and Lucifer was not a character I really mourned. It’s his journey in the end, and there’s sadness in that he once was so innocent and cute, but it was hard to feel fully connected to the characters through the haze of the thick prose. So I didn’t want bad things to happen to them, but when Phanuel’s face was being skinned, I couldn’t exactly cry over it.\n\nThe gore, violence, and rape are viseral and well suited for the heavy metaphors used around them, but a certain amount of it does feel more like shock value than any other value. I suppose because I could never get invested in the cast enough for it to be a tragedy, shock is the only thing that is left.\n\nOverall, and I think this is obvious, I feel very mixed about the second half of the book. Extremely mixed, and super lacking in the right words to sum it up. It happened, but much of it was formless. Lucifer and Michael’s relationship had many fine words in and around it, but in the end it felt static and lost to lyricism around it. Lucifer’s descent into sin was gradual, but still suddenly spurrned from nothing and at latter points used the very-hated trope of ‘voices in his head’ as his three other cherub faces apparently whispered evil thoughts. It took a long time to get to the climax, and though it was bloody it was also over fast and had surprisingly little to say at the end.\n\nI don’t really know about Angels Before Man. Part of me thinks the notion of it being two seperate parts should go further: two seperate books. One is the one I would recommend, which explores Angels, Before Man. The other I just wouldn’t, not because of the triggers but because it simply doesn’t work for me. I was excited and enjoyed reading a book like this, doing something new and doing it about angels, but the writing couldn’t deliver the story it wanted to tell, or a clear story in general. It’s a very pretty bunch of words though. Much of it may be better in small, quotable chunks.\n\nPASSING ANGEL THOUGHTS\n\n+Props for the snake in Eden and his little legs. Hehe. Basic detail but I loved him.\n\n+Cherubim have two sets of wings in the book of Ezekiel and in some places, but usually are placed in the highest sphere and have three sets. It just mildly bothered me because they are pretty much always three sets of wings and Lucifer has two. It’s not wrong! But!\n\n+I can’t help but hehehe at Good Angel parallels. They are such extremely different books but hey. Purple winged beauty angel has a coming of age with the first half being a slow slice of life and the second a faster and more violent tone shift."
