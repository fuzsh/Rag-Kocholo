        "text": "1997 single by LeAnn Rimes\n\n\"On the Side of Angels\" is a song written by Gary Burr and Gerry House, and recorded by American country music artist LeAnn Rimes. It was released in October 1997 as the second and final single from her album You Light Up My Life: Inspirational Songs. It was also later featured on her Greatest Hits (2003) album.\n\n\"On the Side of Angels\" was featured in the 1997 TV movie Holiday in Your Heart, which starred Rimes herself. Being in the movie caused the song to gain unexpected success and acknowledgement, which caused some to consider the song as an \"unofficial/promotional single\". The live performance of the song from the movie has been misinterpreted on YouTube, often circulating around with the label \"music video\".\n\n\"On the Side of Angels\" is a Christian love song. It is a slow ballad with very strong vocals and a powerful meaning.\n\nChart (1997-1998) Peak\n\nposition Canada Country Tracks (RPM)[1] 9 US Hot Country Songs (Billboard)[2] 4"
