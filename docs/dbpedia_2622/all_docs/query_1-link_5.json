Gordon gives his views on a range of topics, telling of some of the compelling evidence he has received from the dead It is the unique story of an equally unique man, one whose life bridges two worlds -this one and the next.\n\nGordon Higginson’s birth was ordained -by the spirit world. Now none would dispute that he is Britain’s best-known medium, one whose gifts include not only trance and clair­voyance, but the dramatic faculty of materialisation when the so-called dead literally appear in the seance-room to be reu­nited with loved ones.\n\nPresident of the Spiritualists’ National Union for over 20 years, countless hundreds of thousands across the United Kingdom have marvelled at his brilliant clairvoyance not only in Spiritualist churches, but in halls and theatres, including London’s famous Royal Albert Hall.\n\nJean Bassett author\n\nJean Bassett was a medium, Spiritualist Minister and holder of the Spiritualists' National Union's rarely-bestowed 'Fellowship Award'.
