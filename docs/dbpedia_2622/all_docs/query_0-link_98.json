        "text": "Throughout my time spent listening to music, I’ve always been one of those people to believe that oftentimes, less is indeed more. When I discovered post-rock, I soon found that minimalism was something to be celebrated, with a single note or sound able to evoke countless emotions based solely upon the way it is performed.\n\nWhile bands like Godspeed You! Black Emperor were instrumental (no pun intended) I’m helping me discover this fact, side projects of theirs like A Silver Mt. Zion almost expanded upon this idea, making their tunes almost more minimal and with more sparse vocals and instrumental throughout their discography.\n\nHowever, it was their first album, 2000’s He Has Left Us Alone But Shafts Of Light Sometimes Grace The Corner Of Our Rooms, that saw the band make a name for themselves in the world of music, with songs like ‘13 Angels Standing Guard Round The Side Of Your Bed’ showcasing their stunning ability to make gorgeous songs with very little.\n\nConsisting of slowly building vocals and almost nothing else, the ambient, lengthy track shows A Silver Mt. Zion at their best, explaining that they don’t need big, grandiose numbers to make you feel sincere emotion. Rather, this song uses the sound of musical sighs to almost evoke images of guardian angels protecting someone, making you wonder what else the band is capable of when the sounds are stripped back.\n\nIt might not be their most complex or intricate song, but it manages to be one of their most powerful and exciting songs, with many – like me – citing it as the song that truly made me appreciate the musical accomplishments of this stunning collective."
