        "text": "According to Benjamin D. Sommer, the three men who appeared in Abraham could be Yahweh himself manifesting in three bodies. He argued that this concept is congruent with Ancient Near East and biblical worldview.\n\nBelow is the entire excerpt of Sommer discussing the Hebrew texts of Genesis 18 and explaining that the three men could be Yahweh himself manifesting to people.\n\nSource: The Bodies of God and the World of Ancient Israel, by Benjamin D. Sommer. (Page 40-41) Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009.\n\n(The whole book can be accessed for free at https://archive.org/details/TheBodiesOfGodAndTheWorldOfAncientIsrael/page/n57/mode/1up)\n\nNote\n\nBenjamin D. Sommer is Professor in the Department of Bible and Ancient Semitic Languages at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.\n\nBenjamin D. Sommer is Professor of Bible at the Jewish Theological Seminary.\n\nThe following is what you stated: \"Reading through BH I come across the interpretation that Abraham saw the Lord and two angels in Gen18. My understanding of the text is that the three men were the Lord. I personally see no issue with God taking the form of one man, two or 100 men simultaneously.\"\n\nTo be \"blunt\" your understanding is seriously flawed. That is \"the three men were the Lord.\" The Bible is explicit in teaching that there is only one God who manifest Himself in three distinct persons. The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. The one God does not take the form of more than one man. Let me \"biblically\" explain why.\n\nIt's clear from Genesis 18:1 that the Lord appeared to Abraham, that's a given because that is what the text states. It is also clear that two men appeared with the Lord so there were three men who appeared to Abraham in the form of men.\n\nWhen we get to Genesis 18:33 the Lord departs from Abraham. At Genesis 19:1 two of the men are clearly identified as angels. The Hebrew word for \"messenger\" is \"malak.\" Angels, and I mean actual angels like Gabriel or Michael are messengers. Men are identified as \"angels\" from the word \"malak\" as well. Just read Malachi 3:1.\n\nNow, paraphrasing Genesis 19 we read (verse 4) \"the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house of Lot. Verse 5, they called out to Lot and ask him where are the men who came to you? At verse 9 the men pressed hard against Lot's door.\n\nAt verse 10, \"But the men/angels reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house. Verse 11, \"And they/the men/the angels struck the men who were trying to break into Lot's house with blindness, both small and great.\"\n\nAt verse 12-13 the men said to Lot to gather his relatives and get out of this place. Why? Verse 13, \"for we are about to destroy this place because their outcry is great before THE Lord that the Lord has sent us to destroy it.\n\nNotice verse 15, \"And when morning dawned the ANGELS urged Lot to get out of Dodge. It is inconceivable for these other two men who are clearly identified as angels to be two other Lords as you stated.\n\nAlso notice at verse 13, \"their outcry has become so great before the LORD/singular Lord, that the singular Lord has sent us to destroy it.\" If you continue reading the rest of Genesis 19 you come to verse 24. \"The the Lord (singular) rained on Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord (singular) out of heaven.\n\nAnd at verse 29, \"Thus it came about, when God/singular destroyed the cities of the valley, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.\"\n\nJust because the text may not use the word \"angels\" in Genesis 18 and uses the word \"men\" does not mean that two of the men are actual angels and one of the men is actually the Lord God in the person of the angel of the Lord, the preincarnate Jesus Christ. Look at it from Abraham's point of view. To him there were three men. At Genesis 16 to Hagar it was a man who appeared to her and she concluded that it was the Lord God. Also saying she remained alive after seeing Him. (Genesis 16:13).\n\nThe Question contains a preference for \"an answer from the Hebrew\".\n\nLet's examine, then, the relevant points of the Hebrew text of Genesis 18. I will provide the Hebrew of the relevant verses, followed by a word-from-word English translation (from right to left, like the Hebrew).\n\nוַיֹּאמְר֣וּ | אֵׄלָ֔ׄיׄוׄ| אַיֵּ֖ה| שָׂרָ֣ה| אִשְׁתֶּ֑ךָ| וַיֹּ֖אמֶר| הִנֵּ֥ה| בָאֹֽהֶל׃ 9 in the tent|here |and he said|your wife[?]|Sarah|where [is]|to him|And they said\n\nNotice that וַיֹּאמְר֣וּ (\"And they said\") is plural, and referred to all the \"three men\".\n\nBut, in the immediately following verse we read (I will only quote the initial part of the verse):\n\n10 וַיֹּ֗אמֶר| שׁ֣וֹב| אָשׁ֤וּב I will return |surely |And He said\n\nNotice that וַיֹּ֗אמֶר (\"And He said\") is singular, and referred to only One of the \"three men\".\n\nIn verses 11-12, it is said that Sarah, at the thought that, in her old age, she will conceive and bear child, laughs.\n\nIn verses 13-14-15 יְהוָ֖ה (the LORD) repeatedly is named, always with the verb in the singular.\n\nThen we have the critical verse 22:\n\n22 וַיִּפְנ֤וּ| מִשָּׁם֙| הָֽאֲנָשִׁ֔ים| וַיֵּלְכ֖וּ| סְדֹ֑מָה| וְאַ֨בְרָהָ֔ם| עוֹדֶ֥נּוּ| עֹמֵ֖ד| לִפְנֵ֥י |יְהוָֽה׃ LORD|before|stood|still|but Abraham|to Sodom|and went|the men|from there|And turned away\n\nVerse 22 does not specify how many are the \"men\" that \"turned away and went to Sodom\", but we are told that Abraham remained with the LORD.\n\nThis is in agreement with the fact that, at Genesis 19:1, two angels \"came to Sodom\".\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom the analysis of the relevant verses in Hebrew, it is confirmed that the \"three men\" of Gen 18:2 are the LORD and two angels (מַּלְאָכִ֤ים) that accompany the LORD and then go to Sodom."
