And, as best I can, I intend to be part of the answer rather than part of the problem\"\n\nYou gotta admire the guys courage...\n\nJanuary 20, 2020\n\nI have just finished reading the late John Smith’s autobiography “John Smith On The Side of The Angels” for the first time. Written in 1987 this is great read which I believe has a message that is still relevant today more than ever. John Smith was one of many people that helped shape my own desire to get into Social Work and help people. I can’t believe it has taken me so long to read such a great autobiography."
