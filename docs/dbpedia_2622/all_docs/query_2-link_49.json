        "text": "Is there one particular angel whose God-given assignment is serving me—just me?\n\nOne of the most common beliefs about angels is that each of us has a guardian angel. But the Bible does not explicitly state this. As far as I can determine, there are just two verses in the Bible that indicate there might be guardian angels in the world today: The first is Matthew 18:10 and the second is Acts 12:13-15. Now, those are the only two passages that I’m aware of that allude to the idea of guardian angels. But we cannot be sure. We do know, however, that God sends His angels to watch over us and help us in times of need.\n\nNow, we can’t know with absolute certainty whether or not each believer has a guardian angel; but we do know that God’s angels care about us and that they can intervene in our lives as they are called by God—and that’s a wonderful thought! The psalmist writes that all the angels rally for the protection of one saint. And there is biblical evidence that sometimes we entertain angels within the company we keep! Here are some biblical instances of when God sent angels to watch over His people.\n\nMatthew 18:10\n\nTake heed that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that in heaven their angels always see the face of My Father who is in heaven.\n\nActs 12:13-15\n\nAnd as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a girl named Rhoda came to answer. When she recognized Peter’s voice, because of her gladness she did not open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter stood before the gate. But they said to her, “You are beside yourself!” Yet she kept insisting that it was so. So they said, “It is his angel.”\n\nPsalm 91:11-12\n\nFor He shall give His angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways. In their hands they shall bear you up, lest you dash your foot against a stone.\n\nPsalm 34:4-7\n\nI sought the Lord, and He heard me, and delivered me from all my fears. They looked to Him and were radiant, and their faces were not ashamed. This poor man cried out, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles. The angel of the Lord encamps all around those who fear Him, and delivers them.\n\nHebrews 13:2\n\nDo not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some have unwittingly entertained angels.\n\nHebrews 1:14\n\nAre they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for those who will inherit salvation?\n\nMatthew 13:41\n\nThe Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and those who practice lawlessness."
