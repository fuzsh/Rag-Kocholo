        "text": "Diane was visiting in the home of some friends. Time passed quickly as each shared their various experiences of the past year. She ended up staying longer than she had planned and had to walk home alone. But she wasn’t afraid because it was a small town and she lived only a few blocks away. As she walked along under the tall elm trees, Diane whispered a prayer asking God to keep her safe from harm and danger.\n\nWhen she reached the alley, which was a shortcut to her house, she decided to take it. However, halfway down the alley, she noticed a man standing at the end, as though he were waiting for her. She became uneasy and began to pray again, asking for God’s protection. Instantly a comforting sense of quietness and security wrapped around her; she felt as though someone was walking with her. When Diane reached the end of the alley, she walked right past the man and arrived home safely.\n\nThe following day, Diane read in the paper that a young girl had been attacked in that same alley, just twenty minutes after she had been there. Overwhelmed by this tragedy and the fact that it could have been her, she began to weep.\n\nThanking the Lord for her safety and wanting to help the young woman who had been attacked, she decided to go to the police station. She told them her story and offered to help identify the assailant. The police asked if she would be willing to view a lineup, she agreed and immediately pointed out the man she had seen in the alley the night before.\n\nWhen the man was told he had been identified, he immediately broke down and confessed. The officer thanked Diane for her bravery and asked if there was anything they could do for her.\n\nDiane was curious as to why the assailant had not attacked her. When the policeman asked him, his answer stunned them all, “Because she wasn’t alone. She had two tall men walking on either side of her.”\n\nDo you believe in angels? I do. I believe that angels are real and are at work in our ordinary, everyday lives. I have personally sensed the presence of angels in my own life and have talked with many believers who share the same experience and belief. However, the most powerful evidence that angels exist is found in Scripture.\n\nThirty-four of the Bible’s sixty-six books talk about angels in detail.\n\nEvery New Testament writer confirms the existence of angels.\n\nThe word “angel” or “angels” occurs more than 300 times in Scripture.\n\nFrom beginning to end, the Bible validates the existence of angels:\n\nGenesis 3:24 “After God forced the man out of the garden, he placed angels and a sword of fire that flashed around in every direction on its eastern border. This kept people from getting to the tree of life.”\n\nRevelation 7:11 “All the angels were standing around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures. They all bowed down on their faces before the throne and worshipped God.”\n\nWhen we come to Jesus Christ in a personal relationship, He takes full responsibility for us. That means He takes care of us. And one of the ways that God cares for us is through the ministry of His angels.\n\nHebrews 1:14 “All the angels are spirits who serve God and are sent to help those who will receive salvation.”\n\nWhat an amazing and comfort-filled promise – that God sends His angels to encourage, protect and guide us on our life journey. As God’s messengers and our helpers, angels serve and honor Him through their praise and obedience as they carry out His will here on earth. As believers, we can count on the presence and power of angels at work in our lives.\n\nMary"
