        "text": "EnricoLange, we stand with you in prayer, asking our Heavenly Father for strong protection, intervention, and breakthrough for you and all those in need. We claim the promises of God, knowing that He is faithful to hear and answer our prayers.\n\nLet us remember the words of 2 Chronicles 7:14 (WEB), \"if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves, pray, seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.\" As we humble ourselves before God and seek His face, He promises to hear us and bring healing and restoration.\n\nHowever, we must ensure that our prayers are offered in the name of Jesus Christ, for it is only through Him that we have access to the Father. As Jesus Himself said in John 14:6 (WEB), \"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, except through me.\" If you have not yet placed your faith in Jesus Christ, we encourage you to do so, for He is the one and only mediator between God and man (1 Timothy 2:5).\n\nIn Psalm 91, we find powerful promises of God's protection. Let us claim these promises as we pray:\n\n\"He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of Yahweh, 'He is my refuge and my fortress; my God, in whom I trust.' For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler, and from the deadly pestilence. He will cover you with his feathers. Under his wings you will take refuge. His faithfulness is your shield and rampart. You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, nor of the arrow that flies by day, nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor of the destruction that wastes at noonday. A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand; but it will not come near you. Only with your eyes you will see, and you will see the reward of the wicked. Because you have made Yahweh your refuge, and the Most High your dwelling place, no evil shall happen to you, neither shall any plague come near your dwelling. For he will put his angels in charge of you, to guard you in all your ways. They will bear you up in their hands, so that you won't dash your foot against a stone\" (Psalm 91:1-12, WEB).\n\nFather God, we come before You in the mighty name of Jesus, asking for Your divine protection, intervention, and breakthrough in the lives of EnricoLange and all those in need. We trust in Your faithfulness and Your power to save. Bring healing, restoration, and hope to all those who call upon Your name. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.\n\nMay the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus (Philippians 4:7, WEB).\n\nPraying with and for you in Jesus.\n\nDo you Believe Jesus died for our sins, is Risen from the dead, is Preparing a place for us and is about to call us to join Him?\n\nAre you watching for Jesus in the Clouds of Glory? Jesus is about to call us to join Him!\n\nWe can do everything Jesus did and more! We can speak; sickness leave in Jesus! Be healed by Jesus stripes! I am healed by Jesus stripes! Amen! Thank You Lord Jesus!\n\nYou can copy and paste this to pray every day and share...\n\nThere is nothing that happens for us that is bad. All things work for our good in Jesus! Look at everything as good!\n\nSing through out your days Thank You Jesus, Praise You Jesus, Glory to You Lord Jesus or anything that is on your heart to sing to Jesus! It doesn't matter how we sound, Angels will join in with us and Jesus will join in with us as well as fight for us, knock down walls for us, open locks for us, save people for us, evil will flee from us, He heals us and He will over flow His Holy Peace in us.\n\nPraying for others on here and reading your Bible will help you tremendously.\n\nI wanted to commit suicide once, I even came up with a plan. Right before I headed out the door I posted a prayer on here and hoping there might be help from God one last time I opened the Bible and only read take no thought for your life. I read that before at least 100 times but never really could understand how. This time I took it to heart, all right God I will end my life by not thinking about it. I take no thought, I take no thought, I take no thought over and over and over again I take no thought was my only thought that day. All of a sudden I noticed something, Jesus showed up, all my pains were gone, no neck ache, no back pain, no leg pain from many many accidents I had over the years and no pain in my heart as my wife had left me. I started singing praises and thanks to Jesus and my life has never been the same. It is our obedience to God from His Holy Instructions that makes a difference to His Power of His Promises in our lives.\n\nBe a doer of Jesus friend, it really makes a difference! Thank You Lord Jesus!\n\nSearch the Bible for Jesus' Promises friend, do them and claim them in Jesus! Amen! Thank You Lord Jesus!\n\nPowerful healing promise hidden in Proverbs 3:7-8, I am not wise in my own eyes, I fear You Lord, I depart from evil, especially my own evil thoughts and my flesh is healed and my body is refreshed in Jesus.\n\nPraying for others especially in your situation will help you tremendously in yours friend.\n\nTake no thought for your life dear friend and Jesus will take thought for you. Sing praises and thanks to Jesus and He will overflow His Holy Spirit in you and so much more. He will fight for you and give you the desires of your heart.\n\nPray this prayer look up the verses and pray it again with your friends and family and let's mount up with wings as eagles and soar. Soar with me.\n\nLet Us Pray: God I ask in Jesus' name, bless me to grow closer to You. I long for a more intimate relationship with You. God I take You at Your Word, if I will draw closer to You, You will draw closer to me (James 4:8). Show me how to draw closer to You. Bless me daily to cast off and forsake my thoughts and ways for my life, and exchange them for Your thoughts and ways for my life. Let me think Your thoughts and dream Your dreams for my life. God bless me to live and walk in Your love, mercy and forgiveness (Isaiah 55:7). I confess, I will take no thought for my life. I will trust You Father God to take thought for me and take care of me (Mathew 6:25-34). I will not be wise in my own eyes, I will fear You Lord and depart from evil and my flesh will be healed and my body will be refreshed (Proverbs 3:7-8) daily. Thank You Jesus for Your Promises! Lord make me the Child of God You need me to be in Christ for all those around me and for the world to see (Psalms 128:3). Not by my might, nor by my power, but by Your Spirt Christ Jesus (Zechariah 4:6) this shall happen. And it will happen, it is happening now in Your timing, Power, Strength, Might, and Spirit, Christ Jesus. God all that I have asked of you in this prayer please do the same for all those I love, care about, and every faithful prayer warrior on this site. Thank You, Thank You, Thank You Lord Jesus, my Savior and Lord for answering this prayer with a Yes and Amen.\n\nBless us to sing praises and thanks to You Lord Jesus so You can fill us with the wine of the Spirit in Jesus Name, Amen."
