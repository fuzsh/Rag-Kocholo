        "text": "Having read the book, I think I can be helpful here. There's not really much that's patently wrong historically, and it's a highly readable book. The trouble, historically speaking is that it doesn't present anywhere near a full picture of the events; Shaara relied heavily on Longstreet and Chamberlain's memoirs, so the actions on the Union right on July 2nd and July 3rd don't show up, nor does much of the Lee-Longstreet controversy over the timing of Longstreet's attacks. Even on the Union left, you only see Chamberlain's role in the fight for Little Round Top; there was a full brigade up there, and you don't read a word about G.K. Warren's role in saving Little Round Top. Nor do you hear of the sledgehammer assault McLaws' division launched against the Union III Corps, and the desperate struggle to contain the breakthrough on that part of the line.\n\nI wouldn't say it has a particular bias; there's some Confederate romanticism, but the Union is portrayed pretty favorably.\n\nHistorically speaking, there are a few items: the movie quotes from Buford's actual June 30 late PM dispatch to Reynolds while the book has his character send a vague 'unworthy of a cavalry officer' message back \"expecting that Rebs may be coming this way\".\n\nBoth the book and the movie imply that the confrontation between Buford and Heth was a stand-up fight rather than more of a \"zone defense\" prolonged skirmish until Reynolds arrived.\n\nViperlord's post covers the second day.\n\nThe dramatic conversation between Stuart and Lee, in any version, most probably did not happen.\n\nShaara used literary license to put Chamberlain in position to observe Pickett's charge on the third day. The 20th ME, and its brigade, and the rest of the V Corps actually remained on the left.\n\nThe book follows the thinking that Lee planned to have Stuart come in behind the Union lines while the infantry attack went in. This is debatable.\n\nOther than that , this book is my single favorite piece of historical fiction. And in the movie, the campfire scene of July 2 - where Longstreet, Pickett, Armistead, and Kemper discuss Darwin - is hilarious.\n\nViper...please post Lee's order to JEB. Just for personal knowledge I would like to read it.\n\nYour polite request is my command.\n\n23, 1863-5 p. m.\n\nMajor General J. E. B. STUART,\n\nCommanding Cavalry:\n\nGENERAL: Your notes of 9 and 10. 30 a. m. to-day have just been received. As regards the purchase of tobacco for your men, supposing that Confederate money will not be taken, I am willing for your commissaries or quartermasters to purchase this tobacco and let the men get it from them, but I can have nothing seized by the men.\n\nIf General Hooker`s army remains inactive, you can leave two brigades to watch him, and withdraw with the three others, but should he not appear to be moving northward, I think you had better withdraw this side of the mountain to-morrow night, cross at Shepherdstown next day, and move over to Fredericktown.\n\nYou will, however, be able to judge whether you can pass around their army, without hinderance, doing them all the damage you can, and cross the river east of the mountains. In either case, after crossing the river, you must move on and feel the right of Ewell`s troops, collecting information, provisions, &c.\n\nGive instructions to the commander of the brigades left behind, to watch the flank and rear of the army, and (in the event of the enemy leaving their front) retire from the mountains west of the Shenandoah, leaving sufficient pickets to guard the passes, and bringing everything clean along the Valley, Closing upon the rear of the army. As regards the movements of the two brigades of the enemy moving toward Warrenton, the commander of the brigades to be left in the mountains must do what he can to counteract them, but I think the sooner you cross into Maryland, after to-morrow, the better.\n\nThe movements of Ewell`s corps are as stated in my former letter. Hill`s first division will reach the Potomac to-day, and Longstreet will follow to-morrow.\n\nBe watchful and circumspect in all your movements.\n\nI am, very respectfully and truly, yours,\n\nR. E. LEE,\n\nGeneral.\n\nThe order's so ambiguous that even if Stuart wasn't doing his job, you'd have a hard time building a case on this mess of an order. But the fact is, Lee, so far as we know, never expressed any displeasure with Stuart.\n\nJust to be proactive...here is the written order from Terry to Custer\n\nHeadquarters of the Department of Dakota (In the Field)\n\nCamp at Mouth of Rosebud River, Montana Territory June 22nd, 1876\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Custer,\n\n7th Calvary\n\nColonel: The Brigadier-General Commanding directs that, as soon as your regiment can be made ready for the march, you will proceed up the Rosebud in pursuit of the Indians whose trail was discovered by Major Reno a few days since. It is, impossible to give you any definite instructions in regard to this movement, and were it not impossible to do so the Department Commander places too much confidence in your zeal, energy, and ability to wish to impose upon you precise orders which might hamper your action when nearly in contact with the enemy. He will, however, indicate to you his own views of what your action should be, and he desires that you should conform to them unless you shall see sufficient reason for departing from them. He thinks that you should proceed up the Rosebud until you ascertain definitely the direction in which the trail above spoken of leads. Should it be found (as it appears almost certain that it will be found) to turn towards the Little Bighorn, he thinks that you should still proceed southward, perhaps as far as the headwaters of the Tongue, and then turn toward the Little Horn, feeling constantly, however, to your left, so as to preclude the escape of the Indians passing around your left flank.\n\nThe column of Colonel Gibbon is now in motion for the mouth of the Big Horn. As soon as it reaches that point will cross the Yellowstone and move up at least as far as the forks of the Big and Little Horns. Of course its future movements must be controlled by circumstances as they arise, but it is hoped that the Indians, if upon the Little Horn, may be so nearly inclosed by the two columns that their escape will be impossible. The Department Commander desires that on your way up the Rosebud you should thoroughly examine the upper part of Tullock's Creek, and that you should endeavor to send a scout through to Colonel Gibbon's command.\n\nThe supply-steamer will be pushed up the Big Horn as far as the forks of the river is found to be navigable for that distance, and the Department Commander, who will accompany the column of Colonel Gibbon, desires you to report to him there not later than the expiration of the time for which your troops are rationed, unless in the mean time you receive further orders.\n\nVery respectfully, Your obedient servant,\n\nE. W. Smith, Captain, 18th Infantry A. A. J. G."
