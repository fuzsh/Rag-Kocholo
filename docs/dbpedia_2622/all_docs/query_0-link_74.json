        "text": "It's pretty crazy to think that the Los Angeles Angels put together one of the most dominant wins in MLB history on Saturday over the Colorado Rockies and still somehow lost the series. Colorado definitely did not allow themselves to get down after the 24-run massacre and stayed poised on their home field.\n\nFor the Halos, this was definitely a massive blown opportunity as they should have gotten back on track after losing two straight games at home to the Los Angeles Dodgers. They still have been great and Saturday's win was the definition of everybody contributing as a group with Shohei Ohtani not even having to do much. However, the bats went cold at the beginning of Sunday's outing and they came up short in the 4-3 loss.\n\nAnd you guys definitely saw this coming... if LA dropped this series after such a dominant win on Saturday, they were certainly going to be on the wrong side of history.\n\n\"The Angels outscored the Rockies 32-12 over the course of the series, and the Rockiesâ€™ minus 20-run differential was the second-largest in major league history for a team that won a series. In 1897, the Louisville Colonels won a series against the Chicago Colts with a minus-23 run differential.\"\n\n(Via OC Register)\n\nThis 2023 LA squad is definitely deeper and has higher potential than groups of the past couple of years but this series does describe the Angels' issues in a way. When they are hot, they are able to beat any team in the league. However, they could always follow up the next day with a stone-cold offense and the struggles back in the mix.\n\nBut the important thing here is to not dwell on it. LA has done a great job of having a short-term memory this year when needed and they now have to focus on a new home series against the Chicago White Sox."
