On The Side Of The Angels

Neil:

What a man, what a job!

All these people

who look to us for justice: trust us!

What a boss to work for,

what a fine upstanding man he is,

I'll follow in his footsteps,

and do my level best

to earn a reputation like his.

I promise I'll proudly endure

the hardships I'll share

working with this man on the side of the angels.

My life will be selfless and pure,

like Upton Sinclair,

working with this man on the side of the angels.

We're marching forward,

incorruptible, he and I

battling with evil,

fighting 'til we drop,

what a way to die!

So give me your tired, your poor,

and scoundrels beware!

Here we stand in chorus,

he and I and Morris:

standing firm, side by side,

on the side of the angels!

Morris:

What a job, what a man,

what an office!

That line of poor and friendless: endless!

Call the Fire Department

there's another kitten up a tree.

Up goes Fiorello,

and everybody cheers.

But what does he use for a ladder?

Me!

Your life is an island of grief,

surrounded by woe,

when you choose to work on the side of the angels.

My hours of leisure are brief,

my wages are low

working with this man on the side of the angels.

That bench stays crowded,

it's a regular Wailing Wall.

penniless and helpless,

ignorant and scared,

he collects them all!

There's never a moment's relief,

but this much I know:

Each poor soul I see there

could be me there.

So, I stay with this man on the side of the angels.

Chorus:

(I no wanna go to jail,

tell me what I gotta do.

I got such a lotta trouble and grief,

I need relief

that's why I come to you)

Marie:

As long as he wants me, I know,

I'll always be here

working by his side on the side of the angels

Neil:

Wherever he sends me, I'll go,

my duty is clear

working with this man on the side of the angels!

Chorus:

(I'm in trouble with the law,

don't know what it's all about

I no got a lot of money to pay,

People they say,

you help me out.)

Morris:

Here's one more client

who's another financial gem

I've yet to see the meek

inheriting the earth,

but we inherit them?

Chorus:

(I was worried where to go,

so I talked to all my friends

Everybody say when you want the best

you go to Fiorello,

Sure, they say you're very smart,

but more than that,

they say you got a a heart,

just like the angels!)

Neil, Morris, Marie:

I know that he needs me, and so,

I'll make my career

working by his side, and proud to be allowed to.

Side by side with this man on the side of the angels!
