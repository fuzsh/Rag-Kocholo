Do you remember the ones that were shot in the head, that girl you burned alive, the ones struck down by lasers or the ones who drowned. The ones whose heads were blown off, your friends. All that despair you've felt, those gruesome scenes, you'll never forget them. And that... really touches me. „ ~ Mira talking to the survivors of the First Stage.\n\n“ Let's all have some fun together! „ ~ Mira to the survivors.\n\n“ Hahaaha! Just kidding! I lied about all that. ❤ „ ~ Mira repeatedly admitting she is making up absurd lies to explain the truth about the Borderlands while Arisu questions her.\n\nMira Kano (known as the Queen of Hearts) is one of the main antagonists of the Netflix show and manga series Alice in Borderland. She is a reference to the original Queen of Hearts from Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland.\n\nShe first appears as a high-ranking member of the Beach. Only at the very end of the First Stage she is revealed to be one of the Game Masters who are controlling everything from behind the scenes.\n\nIn the manga, it is revealed that after she arrived to the Borderlands, she became close friends with Keiichi Kuzuryu, Isao Shirabi and Ginji Kyuma, with them eventually deciding to become citizens to run the games and spend more time together.\n\nShe is portrayed by Riisa Naka. In the English dub, she is voiced by Elizabeth Neale.\n\nPersonality[]\n\n“ Life is... like a game. You should try to enjoy it. „ ~ Mira's last words to Arisu.\n\nMira is very calm and mysterious. She is usually smiling and looks amused most of the time. As a psychiatrist, Mira is interested in the human mind. In the Borderlands, she is always entertained with the games as she likes to discover more about the nature of humans, even if it is at the expense of others.\n\nInitially, while undercover at the Beach, she acts keeping to herself and not stepping into the foreground too much. Although from the beginning she shows signs of insensibility, she is then revealed to be quite sadistic. She enjoys thinking about all the horrible things that the players have gone through and is visibly excited by them. Mira talks about these things with an almost innocent glee, showing no empathy towards those who had to suffer. She is later revealed to be the creator of the Seven of Hearts game, specifically designed to mess with Arisu and his two best friends.\n\nMira is also a very skilled liar, manipulating Arisu's desire to know answers and his trauma in order to make him give up during the Queen of Hearts game. She is so gifted in psychological manipulation that she managed to trick Arisu in believing that the Borderlands and all its residents were created by his imagination and that she is actually his psychiatrist, treating him after the trauma of losing his two best friends.\n\nDespite all, in the end, Mira proves to be honorable and not really heartless. As a psychiatrist, Mira also enjoys seeing people being saved and maturing. Although she is very manipulative towards Arisu, she pushes him during the final game to see if he will mature and get over his trauma. She is genuinely moved (and even cries) when Arisu breaks up from her illusion of lies because of his love and wish to protect Usagi, who slit her own wrist to wake him up. After seeing Arisu's resolve, she accepts defeat and tells him that he must complete the game for Usagi. Although she knows she will die when the Queen of Hearts game is completed, she enjoys playing with Arisu until the very end and is happy when she wins the croquet game. She promises Arisu that he will have the answers that he is seeking soon and ultimately dies with a smile.\n\nBiography[]\n\nBackground[]\n\nMira was psychiatrist and neuroscientist in the real world. She was in Shibuya when a meteor hit the area and the event left her in a near-death state. This sent her to the Borderlands, but she arrived several months earlier than Arisu and the others. She survived and cleared all the games. After the last face card game of that cycle was cleared, she was given the choice to stay permanently in Borderlands or not. Mira accepted and became a citizen. She later helped to monitor the games and also to create her own, assuming the role of the Queen of Hearts.\n\nAlice in Borderland[]\n\nFirst Stage[]\n\nDuring the First Stage of the current cycle of the Borderlands, Mira and the other citizens (Game Masters) create the numbered card games and help to supervise them. They are also reponsible to watch and instruct the dealers (who are the organizers and main monitors of the games during this stage) in secret operation centers.\n\nIn this stage, Mira and Keiichi Kuzuryu (the King of Diamonds) decided to disguise themselves as players and infiltrated the Beach as executive members to watch the development of the players there. After Arisu and his two best friends (Chota and Karube) arrived at the Borderlands, Mira noticed how close the trio were, so she created the Seven of Hearts game specifically to mess with them.\n\nSome time later, Arisu and Usagi find the Beach, she welcomes them into Beach and helps to explain some of its rules. She oversees many activities and is often alongside the Hatter (the leader of the Beach) and the other executive members. During one of the executives' meetings, it is she who points out that neither the Ten of Hearts nor any of the face cards have appeared in any game venue. While discussing ways of beating the remaining games (especially the Ten of Hearts) she makes a very insesitive comment about how easy it is to clear a heart game as long as those who are playing with you are players that don't care about dying. She laughs and says that Arisu (who was traumatized after losing all his friends during the Seven of Hearts) knows what she is talking about so the Hatter should ask him for advice on how to win a heart game.\n\nAfter the Hatter is murdered, Mira and the other executive members reunite to discuss what to do next. Mira tells the others to keep the Hatter's death a secret from the rest of people in the Beach, in order to avoid them from being shaken by this. All of them are pressed by the militants to choose Morizono Aguni as the Hatter's successor instead of Kuzuryu, who is the number 2. Both Kuzuryu and Mira protest but then agree when Suguru Niragi threatens to shoot anyone who disagrees with Aguni becoming the new leader of the Beach.\n\nWhen the Beach is turned into the game venue for the Ten of Hearts (a Witch Hunt game), she is seen grabbing a phone and briefly acting as a player. She tries to stop Niragi from burning Momoka's friend (Asahi) alive, but when mass panic erupts as the militants start to kill everyone to find the witch, she discreetly leaves the scene. After the Ten of Hearts is cleared, she and Kuzuryu had left the Beach but stay close enough to watch the resort burning as result of the Witch Hunt. She tells Kuzuryu that they should be excited because the citizens will be playing in the next stage. Kuzuryu tells her that he wants his game to be fair.\n\nWhen Arisu, Usagi, Chishiya and Kuina find one of the control rooms of the game dealers, Mira appears on the screen and they realize that she is a Game Master. It is then that Mira shows her true nature to them. She reminds the players of all the deaths and suffering they went thorugh in the games while replaying several horrible scenes on screen and says that everything really excited her. She congratulates them on having found all the numbered cards. Mira gleefully announces that the Game Masters will reward the surviving players with even more games, where they will be able to win the face cards.\n\nSecond Stage[]\n\nDuring the Second Stage, Mira stays in the game avenue of her own game: the Queen of Hearts. She stays there waiting for players to come and play with her, so she isn't seen most of the time.\n\nAfter the King of Spades game is cleared, the only game left in the current cycle of the Borderlands is Mira's game. Arisu and Usagi go to play this game and find Mira in a garden. The game turns out to be a simple Croquet game in which the players just need to complete 3 rounds without giving up. They will be able to clear it regardless of winning or losing it, so it appears to be very simple at first. Mira adds that the use of weapons are also allowed. Arisu quickly loses the first round and then notices that Mira is making as much as possible to drag the game, making the second round last. Seeing Usagi slowly bleeding from her stab wounds she got fighting the King of Spades, Arisu tries to finish the round as soon as he can and ends up winning this time.\n\nAfter the second round, Mira claims to be tired and invites Arisu and Usagi to drink tea with her. Arisu and Usagi reluctantly accept to sit at the table with her, but neither of them drink the tea. Arisu starts to question her if they will be able to go back to the real world once this game is cleared and also about the truth of the Borderlands. When Arisu starts to think that Mira doesn't know anything, she confesses she knows the truth. However, instead of telling the true nature of Borderlands, Mira makes up lies. First, she tells them that they are actually in a simulation created by people a thousand years in the future. Then, she tells them that all of the players are actually androids with artificial memories and that they are playing for the enjoyment of wealthy people. On both instances, Mira ends up laughing and admitting she is lying upon seeing Arisu's and Usagi's surprised faces.\n\nMira then confesses that she is the one who made the Seven of Hearts game after noticing how close Arisu was to his two best friends. Infuriated by this, Arisu grabs his shotgun to kill her, but then he realizes that if Mira dies, the Queen of Hearts game will never be cleared. Instead, Arisu demands the truth again, so Mira tells him that the Borderlands aren't real, it is actually a world created by Arisu's imagination to cope with the trama of losing his two best friends in a car accident. She explains that the Borderlands along with all residents are Arisu's imagination and that she is his psychiatrist, treating him. With this lie, Mira manipulates Arisu's trauma and makes him see an illusion of himself being treated by Mira in a psychiatrist room. When Usagi shows up inside the illusion, Mira tells Arisu that she is just another patient with a similar trauma.\n\nBecause of the illusion, Mira almost succeeds in making Arisu give up. However, Usagi then reminds Arisu that he promised to risk his life for her and slits her own wrist with a piece of a broken cup of tea, hoping that Arisu's desire to protect her will wake him up. Initially, Arisu's doesn't respond as Usagi starts bleed profusely, so Mira thinks that she won. But when Arisu holds Usagi's hand and they promise to be with each other, Mira realizes she failed. Mira cries as she watches Arisu promising to protect Usagi and turning to her to play the last round of croquet. This breaks the illusion and they are all shown again at the tea table. Mira stands over Arisu, who holds an injured Usagi, offers him a handkerchief for him to put on Usagi's wound. Mira says that she was moved by Arisu and Usagi's love and tells Arisu that they should finish the game for Usagi. Arisu is surprised by Mira's change of heart.\n\nAccepting defeat, Mira doesn't try stall or use any other manipulation again. Despite knowing she will die once the last round is done, Mira gleefully plays with Arisu. She is very happy and celebrates when she wins the last round (also winning the overall croquet game). With the game cleared, Mira will soon be lasered for losing. In her final moments while waiting to die, Mira is questioned by Arisu again, so she promises him that he will have all the answers that he is seeking soon, no matter what choice he makes (stay or not in the Borderlands). Mira smiles at Arisu and tells him that life is like a game and he should try to enjoy his more. With these final words, a laser falls from the sky, hitting Mira and ending her life.\n\nQuotes[]\n\n“ Heart games let you toy with the hearts and feelings of others. If you bring along those that don't mind dying, you'll survive for sure. Even in the Seven of Hearts game that Arisu cleared. The same thing happened, didn't it? It's a game that doesn't even require you to use your brain! „ ~ Mira to the Hatter and Arisu during a meeting of executive members of the Beach.\n\n“ Is the truth really that important? You want to know for the sake of your deceased friends? Your poor thing. I can see that your deceased friends were very, very precious to you, weren't they? Incidentally, I made the Seven of Hearts game. I mean, you were so close, I just had to. „ ~ Mira tells Arisu that she created the Seven of Hearts game.\n\n“ While you were playing the games, didn't you also lose all interest in what happens in the world? Did you care about how the world works or what its grand purpose is? Did you care about any of that? Those things didn't matter anymore, didn't they? Then why does it even matter what the real truth is? „ ~ Mira to Arisu during the Queen of Hearts game.\n\n“ How magnificent. That was moving. Let's finish off this game... for her sake as well. „ ~ Mira accepts defeat after seeing Arisu's love for Usagi, who injured herself to wake him up.\n\n“ Yes! I won! „ ~ Mira when she wins the croquet game against Arisu.\n\n“ Arisu... You'll find out soon. You will be given two choices. No matter which one you pick, you'll know the answer. And you'll know what kind of person you are. You'll soon find out. „ ~ Mira to Arisu.\n\n[]\n\nMira Kanō on the Alice in Borderland Wiki\n\nNavigation[]"
