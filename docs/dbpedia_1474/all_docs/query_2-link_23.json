        "text": "Video games have evolved into one of the most popular forms of entertainment. In Europe, 25% of the population report playing video games weekly, and especially young adults spend much time in these ‘virtual worlds’ (IPSOS MediaCT, 2012). Many popular games contain high levels of violent imagery, with the killing or hurting of other characters being deeply engrained in the gameplay (Gentile et al., 2004; Krantz et al., 2017). Many recent studies have investigated whether such violent video games (VVGs) have adverse effects on real-world social behavior and empathy (Anderson et al., 2010). According to the influential general aggression model (Bushman and Anderson, 2002), VVGs should decrease the players’ empathy for the pain of others by desensitizing them to both virtual and real violence. Such desensitizing effects should in turn be reflected by decreased activity in brain areas underpinning empathy, such as the anterior insula (AI) and the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) (Lamm et al., 2011; Lamm et al., 2019). However, the evidence for this prediction is mixed. While some studies found that playing VVGs leads to emotional desensitization on the behavioral and neural level (Arriaga et al., 2011; Bartholow et al., 2006; Carnagey et al., 2007; Engelhardt et al., 2011; Staude-Müller et al., 2008), other studies failed to reveal such effects (Gao et al., 2017; Kühn et al., 2018; Szycik et al., 2017a; Szycik et al., 2017b). Conflicting results are also found on the level of systematic reviews (de Vrieze, 2018; Mathur and VanderWeele, 2019). Several meta-analyses suggest that VVGs exert small, yet consistent adverse effects on aggression and empathy (Anderson et al., 2010; Calvert et al., 2017; Greitemeyer and Mügge, 2014; Mathur and VanderWeele, 2019; Prescott et al., 2018). Other researchers contest these results, claiming that results are a product of selective reporting and biased analyses (Ferguson and Kilburn, 2010; Hilgard et al., 2017b).\n\nA key question is whether VVGs are causally responsible for low empathy, or whether less empathic individuals are more likely to play VVGs (Bushman and Anderson, 2015; Ferguson et al., 2008). Many studies have been quasi-experimental in nature, comparing the empathic responses of participants who habitually play VVGs with those of participants without VVG experience (Bartholow et al., 2005; Bartholow et al., 2006; Gentile et al., 2016; Krahé et al., 2011). Such designs provide limited information on the direction of the causal link between VVGs and decreased empathy. The existing experimental studies have nearly always used VVGs as an experimental manipulation shortly before measuring the outcomes of interest (Arriaga et al., 2011; Bushman and Anderson, 2009; Carnagey et al., 2007; Engelhardt et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2013; Staude-Müller et al., 2008). While these studies consistently report evidence for a desensitizing effect of violent games, they cannot disentangle the immediate effects of VVG play from those that have a persistent, long-term impact on individuals. Immediate VVG effects may encompass a wide range of processes, such as priming (Bushman, 1998), as well as stress-like responses such as increases in active fear and aggressive behaviors (Fanselow, 1994; Mobbs et al., 2007; Mobbs et al., 2009) that include generally increased sympathetic activity, release of stress hormones, heightened activation of involved brain structures, and cognitive-affective responses (e.g. deep reflection on the seen content, and changes in emotions and mood). Such responses can persist on a timescale of minutes to hours after aversive events such as VVG exposure, and have been shown to negatively affect social behavior (Nitschke et al., 2022). It is important to distinguish these immediate effects from longer-term adaptations that occur over days or weeks, such as habituation or memory consolidation processes. The general aggression model predicts that the repeated exposure to violence in the positive emotional context of videogames leads to the gradual extinction of aversive reactions, resulting in the long-term desensitization of players to real-world violence (Bushman and Anderson, 2009).\n\nIt is therefore essential to conduct experimental studies that can disentangle the long- and short-term effects of VVGs in participants without prior VVG experience. One first such study was conducted by Kühn et al., 2018, who found no significant effects of VVGs on empathy and its neural correlates. While this study was an important starting point, four important design features limited its conclusions. First, the researchers used very dissimilar games in the experimental group versus the control group, restricting the comparability of the two conditions. Second, while the participants of the experimental group were asked to play the violent game Grand Theft Auto V (Rockstar Studios) for 30 min per day over 2 months, the authors did not control the degree to which participants actually played the game. Third, the authors did not control that participants actually committed violent acts within the game, as the game offers a large amount of gameplay without violent content. Fourth, the absence of significant results was interpreted as evidence for the absence of VVG effects. However, the authors did not report the results of equivalence tests (Lakens et al., 2018) or Bayesian hypothesis tests (Keysers et al., 2020) that would support such claims conclusively (Hilgard et al., 2017a). In view of the many conflicting results reported by experimental research and even meta-analyses (de Vrieze, 2018; Mathur and VanderWeele, 2019), clearly differentiating between ‘absence of evidence’ and ‘evidence of absence’ is particularly important.\n\nTo test possible causal effects of VVGs on empathy and its neural correlates, we conducted an experimental prospective study, which addressed each of these limitations. Eighty-nine male participants with little to no prior VVG experience repeatedly played a modified version of Grand Theft Auto V over the course of 2 weeks. Participants in the experimental group played a highly violent version of the game and were tasked to kill as many other characters as possible. Participants of the control group played a version of the same game from which all violent content was removed, and were asked to perform a non-violent task (taking photographs of other characters). Before and after this gaming period, participants completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session during which we measured the behavioral and neural correlates of empathy for pain and emotional reactivity to violent images (see Figure 1 and Methods: Experimental fMRI sessions for details). We used Bayesian hypothesis tests to assess whether there were negative effects of VVGs on participants’ empathic behavior and neural responses. Hypothesis tests were performed by means of the Bayes factor (BF; Kass and Raftery, 1995). We followed the convention to report a BF>3 as evidence for the alternative hypothesis, a BF<1/3 as evidence for the null hypothesis, and a BF in the interval [1/3, 3] as inconclusive evidence for either hypothesis (Kass and Raftery, 1995; Keysers et al., 2020). We would like to emphasize, though, that the BF provides an easily interpretable continuous quantification of the evidence for and against hypotheses, and that a strict categorization of BFs into evidence for and against hypotheses is not necessary. Our aim was to provide conclusive evidence on the question whether VVGs can desensitize humans to the plight of others or not, within our carefully balanced experimental model.\n\nFigure 1\n\nInfluential theories of media violence predict that the repeated playing of VVGs results in decreased empathy for pain due to a desensitization to real-world violence (Anderson et al., 2010; Bushman and Anderson, 2002). Here, we report evidence against this hypothesis in relation to our specific setting. We found that participants who repeatedly played a highly violent game for 7 hr over the course of 2 weeks did not show decreased empathy for another person’s pain or decreased responses to violent imagery.\n\nOur findings contrast with several earlier studies that found a negative relationship between playing VVGs and empathic responses to violence. Importantly, the majority of these studies were quasi-experimental in nature, and therefore provide only limited evidence for a putative causal effect of violent gaming (Bartholow et al., 2005; Bartholow et al., 2006; Gentile et al., 2016; Krahé et al., 2011). Moreover, the few experimental studies that exist implemented designs investigating short-term carryover effects, as they had exposed participants to virtual violence rather immediately before measurements of their outcome variables of interest (Arriaga et al., 2011; Bushman and Anderson, 2009; Carnagey et al., 2007; Engelhardt et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2013; Staude-Müller et al., 2008). Together with the study of Kühn et al., 2018, our study is one of the first to investigate persistent effects of VVGs in participants without prior experience with them, enabling a clear assessment of the causality of VVG effects. Importantly, our study was designed to address several limitations of the study of Kühn et al.: We strictly controlled the amount of virtual violence actually experienced by participants, and used a non-violent version of the same game in the control condition; moreover, we applied a Bayesian analytical approach, which, together with our comparatively large sample size, enabled us from the outset to distinguish ‘absence of evidence’ from ‘evidence of absence’ of VVG effects. This approach yields consistent evidence from both behavioral and neural data that VVGs, to the extent and characteristics played in our interventional design, are not causally responsible for a persistent lack of empathy or emotional desensitization to violence.\n\nDespite the aforementioned strengths of our study, we also need to address several limitations. Our experimental design ensured that participants of the experimental group were exposed to a substantial amount of violent gameplay during gaming sessions (each participant ‘killed’ an average of 2845 other characters in a graphically violent way). However, the overall exposure to virtual violence was still very low when compared to the amount that is possible in the everyday life of typical VVG players. During our experiment, participants played for 7 hr over the course of 2 weeks. However, habitual gamers can play an average of 16 hr in the same time frame (Clement, 2021; Statista Research Department, 2022). Our results cannot preclude that longer and more intense exposure to VVGs could have negative causal effects on empathy. In particular, adolescents and children as well as persons with specific neuropsychiatric traits might be especially susceptible to long-term changes due to increased brain plasticity. However, empirically testing higher levels of violence with the same degree of control as realized in our study would reach the limits of practical feasibility. We thus believe that our results provide an important perspective on the size of VVG effects that could realistically be expected in experimental research.\n\nTo increase experimental control, we restricted our sample to young adult males who had minimal prior exposure to VVGs. It is possible that, due to this strict preselection criterion, our sample was drawn from a subpopulation that is particularly resistant to desensitization. An exploratory analysis provided strong evidence that our selection criterion did not result in particularly high levels of trait empathy in our sample, though. However, we cannot preclude that our sample was particularly resistant to VVG effects due to other, untested characteristics. Further research is needed to assess if our results generalize to samples with other characteristics that may be more representative for the general population.\n\nTo maximize the amount of violence that participants would be exposed to (and commit) in the game, we restricted the game’s objective to killing other characters, and incentivized this behavior with monetary rewards. This might have reduced the ecological validity of our operationalization of gaming, and it is possible that bigger effects could be seen when violent gameplay is more internally motivated, i.e., individuals who want to play the game may be differently affected than those that have merely accepted to be part of an experiment. Still, our results provide valid evidence that the mere exposure to virtual violence for 7 hr over 2 weeks is not sufficient to decrease empathy.\n\nIt should be noted that there are few studies that connect laboratory-based experimental investigations of empathy and emotional reactivity to real-world behavior and its measures. There are indications, however, that neuroscientifc empathy measures similar to the ones used here predict individual social behavior (e.g. donation, helping, or care-based behavior; Ashar et al., 2017; Hartmann et al., 2022; Hein et al., 2010; Tomova et al., 2017), and that they are also validated by their predictivity of mental or preclinical disorders characterized by deficits in empathy (Bird et al., 2010; Lamm et al., 2016, for review). That said, it is obvious that future research is needed that bridges and integrates laboratory and field-based measures and approaches, in order to inform us how changes (or their absence) in neural responses induced by VVG play are connected to real-life social emotions and behaviors (see Stijovic et al., 2023, for a recent example illustrating, in the domain of social isolation research, how a combined lab- and field-based study can be directly informed by prior laboratory-based neuroscience findings).\n\nOur study was designed to reliably detect an effect size of d=0.3, an effect even smaller than the lower estimate for VVG effects on empathy reported in Anderson et al., 2010. Our results provide substantial evidence that effects of this magnitude are not present in settings similar to our experimental design. These arguments notwithstanding, it needs to be noted that future studies with higher power may detect still smaller effects. Considering the high prevalence of VVG, even such small effects could be of high societal relevance (Funder and Ozer, 2019). For now, based on the current design and data, we can conclude that experimental long-term VVG effects on empathy are unlikely to be as large as previously reported.\n\nIt may be argued that the empathy for pain paradigm and the associated behavioral and neural responses are so robust and resistant to changes by external factors that this may explain the lack of evidence for the effects of VVG play. This argument however would contradict a wealth of findings illustrating malleability of empathic responses using this and related designs, including with placebo analgesia (Rütgen et al., 2021; Rütgen et al., 2015a; Rütgen et al., 2015b), an intervention that usually shows low to moderate effect sizes as well (see e.g. Hein and Singer, 2008; Jauniaux et al., 2019; Lamm et al., 2019, for review).\n\nLastly, and somewhat surprisingly, we found that the test-retest reliability of our neural covariates of empathy for pain were close to zero for all investigated ROIs. Knowing that an individual’s neural empathic response (blood oxygen level-dependent [BOLD] activity for seeing somebody else in pain vs. in no pain) was above or below average in the first session provides little to no information about their relative response in the second session. To the best of our knowledge, our study was the first one to present the empathy for pain paradigm to the same sample of participants after a longer time frame. Thus, this surprising result provides valuable information on the limitations of this task respectively the neural measurements acquired in it, and certainly demands further research to investigate the factors influencing fMRI reliability (see also Elliott et al., 2020; Kragel et al., 2021). We would like to emphasize, though, that a high test-retest reliability is not a precondition for the valid testing of group-level effects. For a group-level effect to be testable, it is only necessary that the mean of the dependent variable is consistently affected by the independent variable. It is not necessary that participants who show an above average level in the DV in one session also show an above average level in the second session, and vice versa. Otherwise, there would also be no point in independent-sample designs. Indeed, it has recently been discussed that highly robust cognitive tasks are bound to exhibit low test-retest reliability, as robust tasks are often characterized by low interindividual variation, and thus leave only little variance that can be explained by participant traits (Hedge et al., 2018). However, it must also be noted that low reliability does lead to lower power of repeated measures designs. As discussed above, the low reliability of the measured neural responses has resulted in suboptimal power of our tests on fMRI data.\n\nIn summary, our findings stand in contrast to claims that posit the playing of violent games as an essential factor for explaining decreases in empathy. If this is shown to generalize to when people play more often and over longer periods, the desensitization to violence described in prior reports using quasi-experimental designs might have been caused by third and pre-existing factors, such as education, socio-economic status, or mental health issues (DeCamp and Ferguson, 2017; Lemmens et al., 2006; Shao and Wang, 2019; Tortolero et al., 2014). Together with similar findings (Kühn et al., 2018), our results point out the limits to which VVGs can be held responsible for lacks of empathy, at least in highly controlled experimental settings that last for the 2 weeks of play implemented here. This is not to say, though, that there is no point in further investigating the complex relationships between violent media use and adverse social behavior. We propose that the design and analysis approach of the present study could act a reference of how future studies should be conducted, in order to increase the stringency and robustness of research in this domain. Together with our findings, such studies will aid in resolving the scientific controversy regarding the negative effects of VVGs (de Vrieze, 2018; Mathur and VanderWeele, 2019), and contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between violent media and emotion."
