        "text": "Once upon a time, there was a small British computer called the ZX Spectrum. It had chunky rubber keys and all the commands you could give to it were written right there on the keyboard. It inspired half of the coders that came out of Europe in the 1980s.\n\nWhen you turned the Spectrum on, there was nothing else to do but type in programs.\n\nWe didn’t start to code on our own right away—we learned by copying short programs from magazines, word by word. Even children’s magazines did their part. As soon as we learned to read uppercase letters, we were ready to jump into coding.\n\nWe learned the meaning of commands from books or parents—or even dumb luck (call it curiosity)—and pounded the knowledge into our heads (and computers) by typing in a program after program after program. OK, let’s be honest, 90% of them were games.\n\nThirty years later, there is another small British computer. No, I’m not talking about ZX Spectrum Next. As much as I love it, the Next is a new Spectrum for the old generation, not the new.\n\nThe Spectrum for the new generation is the Kano.\n\nSounds familiar? Yup, just like the 80s.\n\nKano is phenomenally successful. With over a million dollars raised, the first kit got massively funded on Kickstarter in 2013, becoming the most crowdfunded learning product at the time.\n\nTo date Kano shipped over 150,000 computers to 86 countries and the users shared over a hundred thousand drawing scripts like the house above, including modified versions and unique creations.\n\nDrawings are just the tip of the iceberg though—learning to draw with code is simply one of the educational features.\n\nTo fully explain Kano I have to rewind time, back to when I first opened the box it came in.\n\nA couple of months ago, Kano Computing sent me their Computer Kit Bundle, as part of an art collaboration I’m doing with them. The Bundle included their Computer Kit and Screen Kit ($150 each, or $285 for the Bundle), all of which are available from their webpage.\n\nThey’re called Kits because, like in the 80s, instead of buying an off-the-shelf computer, you buy a kit that you assemble yourself (and learn how things work along the way).\n\nWith all the pieces out of the box, you follow LEGO-like instructions to build your own computer.\n\nIt’s not exactly a masterpiece with hundreds of pieces—the chips and resistors are all in place already. In fact, the heart of the computer is a standard Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.\n\nSoon enough you end up with a computer you built yourself and hopefully your kids will care about it more than your taken-for-granted laptop which is daily liable for screen damage due to rage-quitting (true story … ah, kids).\n\nThe Brain, as Kano calls the computer part, clips on the back of the Screen for a nice, compact experience.\n\nOf course you could have gone with any other HDMI display as well, but the Screen Kit does match the bluetooth keyboard perfectly.\n\nHack Minecraft offers just creative mode, but it’s neat how you can jump from coding to testing your powers with a simple key press (the game is always running on the left, no messy compiling necessary).\n\nMore surprising lessons offered by Kano include Make Snake where you launch a game of snake from the command line (you learn how to use parameters such as --theme Jungle to modify the game’s appearance), and Terminal Quest, a text adventure where you navigate through the world using the cd command, look at things with ls and cat, move items with mv and so on. Really clever!\n\nLike Neo says in The Matrix, I didn’t come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it is going to begin.\n\nAfter Kano’s initial Kickstarter in 2013, the company launched another campaign one year ago for 3 new peripherals: Camera, Pixel Kit, and Speaker.\n\nThe Pixel Kit is the reason Kano contacted me in the first place. It continues the narrative of Computer Kit and brings the story from behind the screen into the real world.\n\nBut more about that in Part 2.\n\nThank you yet again for reading Retronator Magazine! Special thanks to Kano Computing for providing me with their awesome kits, as well as commissioning me to do apps and art for them. Some of you know I recently finished my Master’s degree in Education—it was in a program called Learning, Design and Technology. Basically I was in a program where we studied to design things exactly like the Kano. I’m doing my bit with Pixel Art Academy (an adventure game for learning how to draw), but I also always wished there’d exist an entertaining way to learn how computers work. I’m glad Kano is beating me to it. See you soon in Part 2!\n\nMay the pixels be with you,\n\n—Retro"
