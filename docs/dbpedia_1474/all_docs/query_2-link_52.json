You might have seen their adaptations or merchandise with their faces, even if you don’t play the games they’re in.\n\nMany factors make a video game character intriguing, from their backstory and character arc to their physical features and evolution within their games. While some receive attention for a certain period, some have been favorites for years.\n\nHere are some of the most popular video game characters and why they have been so well-loved for so long:\n\nOur Ranking Criteria\n\nIn addition to player feedback, game reviews, countless forum reviews, blogs, YouTube videos, fansites, and industry critics, we also used objective metrics like sales and users to make this list (read more). Some of these data sources include:\n\nSteam Charts\n\nMetacritic\n\nSteamDB\n\nCounting Down Top 50 Gaming Characters\n\nCommander Shepard from Mass Effect\n\nBioware first released Mass Effect in 2007, and Commander Shepard has remained iconic through various iterations and installments. He is so loved because players’ choices determine his destiny, enabling an indelible connection to the character. A fleshed-out protagonist in a top-notch game leads to legions of fans for many years.\n\nWhat Makes Him Great\n\nCommander of SSV Normandy: Shepard starts as an Executive Officer but later gains full command over the SSV Normandy SR-1, showing leadership qualities.\n\nIconic Quotes: Shepard has memorable lines like “I’m Commander Shepard, and this is my favorite store in the Citadel,” which have become part of gaming culture.\n\nEmotional Depth\n\nPersonal Tragedies: Depending on the background chosen, Shepard may have survived a slaver attack or grown up as an orphan, adding emotional layers to the character.\n\nEzio Auditore De Firenze from Assasin’s Creed\n\nA member of the Assassin order, Ezio Auditore De Firenze’s name translates to “Ezio, Listener from Florence” in Italian. This references his backstory from when his father was the head of Auditore International Bank.\n\nFun Fact: Roger Craig Smith, who voiced Ezio, has voiced Sonic the Hedgehog in numerous media and video games, Chris Redfield in the Resident Evil series, and Captain America in the 2010 Marvel Animated Universe.\n\nWhat Makes Him Great\n\nHis character arc is compelling – he goes from a carefree young nobleman to a dedicated assassin seeking vengeance for his family’s death. His development is complex and engaging.\n\nHe is charismatic and charming, making him a likeable protagonist. His confidence and wit endear him to players.\n\nHis parkour and free-running abilities allow for thrilling gameplay. Traversing Renaissance Italy by climbing buildings in fluid motions makes players feel like a true assassin.\n\nEarthworm Jim from Earthworm Jim\n\nEarthworm Jim is one of the most iconic video game characters of all time. The game was so well received that it was adapted into a TV series that ran for two seasons.\n\nEarthworm Jim became a superhero after he took refuge in a mysterious suit that gave him powers.\n\nThe game’s icon status is due to its gameplay and charming character names, like Princess What’s-Her-Name and Queen Slug-for-a-Butt.\n\nWhat Makes Him Great\n\nHis absurd and quirky character design stands out – he’s an earthworm in a specialized suit who battles evil. This weirdness makes him memorable.\n\nThe humor and parody elements poke fun at other video games and action tropes with slapstick comedy and surreal enemies.\n\nHis nonsensical backstory involves his super suit falling from space and allowing him to fight villains. This whimsical origin is funny.\n\nHis varied and over-the-top weapons like a blaster, rocket launcher, and explosive bubble gum keep gameplay exciting.\n\nThe grotesque and wacky enemy designs like evil living mucus and sinister lab cows add to the chaotic spirit.\n\nPit of Kid Icarus\n\nWhile he’s fun in the Super Smash Brothers franchise, we’re this high-five back to 1986 when our little angel first appeared in Kid Icarus on the NES.\n\nThe protagonist’s backstory made the game memorable, but more than that, it inspired the creators to take action gaming seriously, leading to the uber-popular Super Mario series.\n\nWhat Makes Him Great\n\nWith unwavering loyalty and devotion, Pit serves the goddess Palutena, willing to take on any task and protect her at all costs as her most trusted servant.\n\nMastering a diverse array of weaponry that includes bows, blades, claws, clubs, cannons and more, Pit adeptly adapts his combat skills to any battle situation he faces.\n\nPit’s rare angelic gift of flight, though limited, grants him exceptional aerial mobility, allowing him to deftly maneuver and platform in the sky.\n\nFargoth from Morrowind\n\nFargoth is the smarmy wood elf from the early moments in TES: Morrowind. He is too smarmy to not make the list. We wish we could steal his gold all the time.\n\nWhat Makes Him Great\n\nFargoth’s desperate and pleading request for help finding his lost ring makes him an immediately memorable character from the player’s first moments in Seyda Neen.\n\nPlayers are presented with an interesting moral dilemma right away in whether to return Fargoth’s ring or selfishly keep it, establishing player agency.\n\nBefriending Fargoth by returning his ring rewards the player with his eternal gratitude and discounts at Arrille’s Tradehouse through his friendship with the shopkeeper.\n\nMcCree from Overwatch\n\nOverwatch, a multiplayer first-person shot game, features Jesse McGree, an iconic main character. He is always seen with a Peacemaker and a cowboy hat. The character is known for his precision and realistic abilities. He has become well-loved by many for his idea of justice.\n\nWhat Makes Him Great\n\nMcCree’s complex backstory of being part of the notorious Deadlock Gang before joining the covert Blackwatch unit provides depth and internal moral conflict.\n\nMcCree’s expert marksmanship and gunslinging skills with his revolver Peacekeeper make him an extremely deadly and stylish damage-dealer.\n\nMcCree’s cowboy aesthetic complete with hat, spur, and poncho provides a memorable and mythic character design evocative of the American West.\n\nJonathan Irons from Call of Duty\n\nAlso known as CoD Kevin Spacey. He’s too much fun as a villain, not to mention.\n\nHis life’s principles and undying love for war make him memorable. Tom Hanks now plays the character.\n\nWhat Makes Him Great\n\nIrons’ gradual transition from seeming ally to the surprise revelation as the main villain provides an incredibly impactful and unexpected plot twist.\n\nIrons’ highly charismatic personality and public charm make him chillingly convincing when presenting his extremist views of forcibly removing world governments.\n\nIrons’ twisted ideology that politicians cause all war presents a nuanced antagonistic perspective that evokes some moral grayness.\n\nThe distinctive and evocative voice acting for Irons by Kevin Spacey brings weight, gravitas, and complexity to the character.\n\nHandsome Jack from Borderland 2\n\nSticking with the fun villain theme started by our friend Mr. Spacey, we have the big baddie from Borderlands 2 coming in hot.\n\nThe self-declared dictator of Pandora goes rogue and commits a slew of violent and heinous crimes after his daughter accidentally kills her mother and his wife. Borderland 2 has the “baddest” villain, so Handsome Jack is well-received by players.\n\nWhat Makes Him Great\n\nWith bombastic displays and larger-than-life ego, Jack embodies the narcissist’s penchant for flamboyant megalomania.\n\nJack’s unpredictable oscillation between affable charm and explosive murderous rage keeps players perturbed.\n\nJack’s iconic mask obscures his facial scars in mystery, exemplifying his dual personas.\n\nRayman from Rayman\n\nNo one knows what Rayman is. The limbless creature appeared in a game that was first launched in 1995 and quickly became popular.\n\nSince then, the character has undergone multiple changes, but the essence has remained the same.\n\nWhat Makes Him Great\n\nUnique and Memorable Design: Rayman’s limbless, floating body with hands, feet, and head adds a distinctive and memorable visual appeal.\n\nVersatile Abilities: Rayman’s iconic helicopter hair ability allows him to glide across large spaces, making for exciting gameplay mechanics.\n\nSymbolic White Ring: The white ring on Rayman’s chest symbolizes his connection to Betilla the Fairy and his source of new powers.\n\nDiddy Kong from Donkey Kong and Mario Kart\n\nDiddy Kong first appeared in Donkey Kong Country in 1995. He is the sidekick and best friend of Donkey Kong. He is also featured in the first few installments of the Mario franchise.\n\nWhat Makes Him Great\n\nMonkey Business Unleashed: Diddy Kong’s origins are shrouded in mystery, as he joins the legendary Donkey Kong as his plucky nephew and right-hand primate. Together, they embark on epic adventures through lush jungles and perilous caves.\n\nCultural Flair: Diddy’s name isn’t just catchy; it’s a nod to northern England slang for “small.” This intriguing reference hints at a world of cultural diversity, waiting to be explored.\n\nA Tail of Ingenuity: What sets Diddy apart from his Kong family counterparts is his magnificent tail. Not just a fashion statement, this prehensile appendage is a multitool, enabling him to hang from vines, grasp objects, and even thwart his foes with flair.\n\nUrdnot Wrex\n\nWe’re back in space! At least it isn’t procedurally generated space! That would be boring! If you don’t think the Krogan Mercenary should make this list, then you have to be the one to break the news to him. Shepard.\n\nMass Effect has had some memorable characters, and one of the most popular is Urdnot Wrex. Players love the bounty hunter and mercenary for many reasons.\n\nWhat Makes Him Great\n\nUnique Background and Skills: Urdnot Wrex stands out as one of the last Krogan Battlemasters, blending powerful biotic abilities with formidable weapon skills.\n\nLeadership and Clan Loyalty: Born into Clan Urdnot, Wrex quickly rose to prominence as a youth, becoming the youngest krogan to lead a tribe in a millennium.\n\nPersonal Growth and Betrayal: Wrex’s character undergoes significant development as he experiences betrayal from his own father, leading him to reevaluate the krogan culture.\n\nRyu Hayabusa from Ninja Gaiden\n\nAlso known as the Dragon Ninja, Ultimate Ninja, and Super Ninja, Ryu Hayabusa is as fit as a gameplay ninja. His modern-day costume, muscular build, and stoic features make him an intriguing character.\n\nWhat Makes Him Great\n\nMulti-Faceted Character: Ryu Hayabusa is a well-rounded character with a complex personality that evolves throughout the Ninja Gaiden series.\n\nIconic Appearance: Ryu’s Legendary Black Falcon outfit combines modern special ops aesthetics with traditional ninja elements, making him visually distinct and memorable.\n\nUnyielding Determination: Ryu’s backstory is filled with tragedy, including the murder of his best friend and the massacre of his clan. His determination and indomitable spirit to overcome adversity and seek vengeance resonate with players.\n\nSpyro from Spyro the Dragon\n\nThe game was initially created for Sony PlayStations, but thanks to its popularity, it’s now available on multiple platforms.\n\nThose who consider themselves hardcore gamers may be embarrassed to admit it, but Spyro the Dragon was entertaining and has made its way into everyone’s hearts.\n\nWhat Makes Him Great\n\nInnovative 3D Platformer: Spyro, as a character, represents the transition of video games from 2D to 3D during the PlayStation era, offering players a fresh and exciting gaming experience.\n\nCreative Development Process: The creation of Spyro was the result of a collaboration between Naughty Dog and Insomniac Games, with both studios aiming to capitalize on the burgeoning 3D gaming trend.\n\nAppeal to a Family-Friendly Audience: Spyro was designed with a colorful and Disney-like tone, catering to a family-friendly audience, and filling a gap in the PlayStation’s game library for such content.\n\nNathan Drake from Uncharted\n\nMany may only know him from the movie, but real fans know that Nathan Drake from the video game is iconic. A professional treasure hunter, he is extremely quick-witted, fierce, and incredibly lucky when facing danger.\n\nWhat Makes Him Great\n\nComplex Backstory: Nate’s background, marked by a childhood in an orphanage and a false claim of descent from Sir Francis Drake, adds depth to his character.\n\nExpertise and Resourcefulness: As a professional treasure hunter and deep-sea salvage expert, Nate showcases his resourcefulness and survival skills throughout the Uncharted series.\n\nPersonal Growth: Nate’s journey from a troubled orphanage upbringing to a renowned treasure hunter highlights his growth as a character.\n\nYou Should Know\n\nIn designing the protagonist for the Uncharted game, Naughty Dog wanted to draw inspiration from a diverse array of personalities, including Johnny Knoxville from ‘Jackass’, the suave and sophisticated Cary Grant, and the adventurous Indiana Jones portrayed by Harrison Ford.\n\nDespite the character’s lack of skill or not being well-equipped in the art of treasure hunting, coupled with his knack for risking his life (and others) over a more ordinary existence, it is evident that Naughty Dog has created a masterpiece in the form of Nathan Drake.\n\nDeckard Cain from Diablo\n\nAh, Deckard Cain. A character that embraces his archetype with a fervor unmatched in all of Sanctuary. Or at least in all of Tristram.\n\nVery few games manage to capture what Diablo has with Deckard Cain. A scholar and historian of Tristram, Cain is an all-knowing being. And he often knows more than he lets on. Gamers find him intriguing because of his phrasing and distinctive voice.\n\nWhat Makes Him Great\n\nIconic Presence: Deckard Cain is an iconic character in the Diablo series, having been a consistent presence since the beginning of the franchise.

She is an AI created by Aperture Science, the primary antagonist.\n\nWhile most characters become popular for their personality or story arc, GLaDOS is best known for her iconic voice (done by voice actress Ellen McLain).\n\nWhat Makes Her Great\n\nComplex Character Development: GLaDOS undergoes a fascinating transformation from a helpful AI to a menacing antagonist and eventually, a more complex character with shifting allegiances.
