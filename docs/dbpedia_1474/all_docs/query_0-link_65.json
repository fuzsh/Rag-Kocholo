        "text": "Mild spoilers follow.. you’ve been warned.\n\nTLDR: I liked it, I’ll of course preorder it as soon as I can and I’ll probably see it in Theater one more time. It isn’t perfect, though and as they say: I have notes.\n\nJust to level-set and address the most common comparison: I hated Kingdom of the Crystal Skull; until I didn’t. In recent re-watches Crystal Skull actually changed my mind about that film. I rather enjoy it, now. Crusade and Raiders battle for my number 1 ranking and the rest vary by mood, including this new installment, I suspect.\n\nDriving home from seeing Indiana Jones and The Dial of Destiny, I had a smile on my face. That is: right up until we found the Wallace Tunnel on I-10 in Mobile, Alabama was closed forcing a detour through downtown Mobile. In my opinion the downtown Mobile street layouts are more “gardened” than “engineered.” They just sort of happened over time, less as a result of planning and more out of a protracted timeline of necessity, repair and expansion.\n\nThis, I think might be an apt metaphor for about my first impressions of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.\n\nMobile isn’t my favorite place to visit. In many ways it is like its sister city, New Orleans. Parking is a pain, traffic is a consistent problem. There are million dollar homes with historical marker plates within a block of derelict shanty flop-houses. On any given night you have equal odds of an adventurous good time with colorful characters or becoming a crime statistic. In fact, you could almost imagine finding Indy in a back alley brawl or Delta River boat chase over information leading to some ancient relic from early Spanish occupation..\n\nRight before we came onto the tunnel, still smiling, I told my wife:\n\nI need to see it again to settle on a final ranking but just because Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny isn’t my favorite Indy movie doesn’t make it a bad film or even a bad final outing for Indy. From my top 5 flavors of Ice Cream, even the fifth ranked Ice Cream can hit the spot on a hot summer day. So did this last outing with Harrison Ford once again donning the fedora and whip in search of fortune and glory (or perhaps just closure and reconciliation).\n\nAs an Indy fan I’m inclined to defend this movie from the click-bait troll reviews that apparently make a living throwing shade at Lucasfilm and Disney leadership and made their collective minds up about this film a year ago before it was even in the can. By contrast, I write here from my phone in meeting-boredom and in organization of my own thoughts and could care less if another human ever reads it. These people don’t need me to defend their choices, so I’m honest and my opinions are my own.\n\nI like the Archimedes prop (alot, obviously) and the fetch-quest was cool. I even like Archimedes as a historical truth-finder similar in some ways to Indy. The Leads were fine. Indy was: Old-Ass ropey-but-strong and still-very laconic and wry Indy. Helena was a perfectly fine roguish co star, maybe a little hyperactive but a fine reflection of modern audiences in contrast to Indy’s pre-adderall generation.\n\nMild Spoilers\n\nFord is always great as Indy, even at this age. I suspect this is more that Indy is a facet of Harrison Ford’s personality than a character he’s actually playing. The horseback scene shown in the trailers is thrilling and the de-aged Indy sequence at the beginning is great. The de-aging tech still isn’t perfect but it also isn’t distracting, though don’t look too closely at the eyes. Eyes are still hard: being the window to the soul and all.\n\nMads Mikkelsen was great, liked seeing Antonio Banderas too.\n\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge and not-Short-Round were fine ensemble cast members.\n\nThough, I don’t think the film does a great job of making either character like-able. Early in the film Helena leaves old-man Indy in a way that earlier films would have rewarded with an insta-Karma booby-trap to the face. For the Teddy defenders out there: How would you feel if Short-Round killed people? Teddy murders a fool. Dude was a nazi and had it coming but still!? The modern story aesthetic Vis-à-vis the quality of human life doesn’t really map well here, in my opinion. I want my kid side-kicks to be edgy lovable scoundrels but Teddy? This makes Teddy too hardcore as a sidekick in my view. I’m just sayin’ that if Teddy’s hanging around my NYC apartment, I’m not leaving him alone with the pets.\n\nFWIW: My daughter really liked Helena’s character and style, so this might just be curmudgeonly 44 year old values talking.\n\nIf I’m honest most of the things that make this a good film and not a great film probably happened in the editing bay or might be the result of a last-minute restructure to the original script despite conflicting rumors on the subject. There are some odd ADR lines where a character is talking but apparently via ventriloquist skills because their mouth isn’t moving. The story structure is a little muddied too in that Archimedes’ Dial comes in three parts and you’d expect those parts to map cleanly over a three-act story structure. Instead, the final part - the little compass-like-whatcha-ma-call-it in the center of the dial just sort of “happens” without detailed explanation or much in the way of fanfare.\n\nMangold and the DP borrowed enough of the Indy style in terms of color palette and set-design and John Williams score does plenty to make this feel like a real Indiana Jones movie but some of the classic Spielberg hip-shots, shadows and framing are missing. ( Level-set, again: I’m not a Spielberg-only Stan - I hate what he did to Ready Player One) Some of the shadows and silhouettes are there but they aren’t allowed to breath. The camera pans and transitions also fail to evoke the old-timey Republic serials that are hallmarks of the franchise. There is a travel sequence. It was updated and probably shouldn’t have been.\n\nMostly, the pacing is a little odd. The middle of the movie had my eyes wandering from the screen. I feel like the transition through the third act resolution to the finale was rushed and left me a bit disoriented. It wasn’t a fatal flaw but I think in time this transition from the third act pinnacle to the finale will be divisive, maybe even an object lesson. The “Nuke the fridge” of story transitions.\n\nUltimately I like where they left it, the final scene was touching and nostalgic and worked for the characters.. and I’m happy to get one more outing from Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. Go see the movie.\n\nI previously let my disappointment in some of the modern Star Trek offerings known in what I think was a pretty fair set of opinions.\n\nPicard Season 3 is…. great. Not just great for Star Trek or great by comparison to the cookie cutter sludge factory of streaming television. Its an excellent show, especially if you are a TNG or DS9 fan.\n\nHow to summarized this without spoilers…Allegory? Metaphor? I’m not sure that I know the difference..\n\nImagine you go to a party where most of your pet peeves are on display.\n\nThere’s nowhere to park. The music is horrible; flapping its way through a separated speaker on a rattling shelf and filling the room - somehow both too shrill and too thump-y. The annoying and obnoxious close-talking guest that won’t let you get a word in edge-wise and keeps you cornered for the majority of the night. Someone’s snotty teenager keeps going back to the food-table after having sneezed on all of it during his 2nd-and-3rd trips to get at probably: bacteria-infested deviled eggs.\n\nThere is more than one Miller-light intoxicated redneck wearing Let’s Go Brandon attire and spoiling for a fight about something. There is more than one liberal-arts major hipster wearing a Rainbow Che Guevara shirt high on edibles and reeking of Body Odor that wasn’t within the masking ability of their homemade soap.\n\nThe Business Chads, sales-guy types are in the corner talking about their investment portfolios and island-hopping vacations between bursts of boisterous but totally unconvincing laughter. At least one of them will eat a bullet before Christmas.\n\nThen, on the last 1/3 of the evening it all turns around.\n\nYou reconnect with an old close friend from school and their delightful new spouse. You didn’t realize they’d moved nearby and you have a blast catching up, even make plans for coffee or drinks after work next week. While you were sequestered away talking about bygone years the rednecks passed out, the close talker realized he had dog shit on his shoes the whole night and goes home. The hipsters are couch-locked in amazement at the LEDs flickering over the pool and two of the Business Chads are filing out insurance paperwork: apparently one of the Karen’s backed into their new Mercedes, which was a Lease. Even the music and food improved as a Taco truck operator sees the crowd and decides to set up for service.\n\nThis, in a nutshell is Star Trek: Picard. Season 3 is a great TNG outing and it does the rare thing of improving the seasons that came before it by firing a concentrated tachyon beam of STTNG nostalgia right into your eyeballs. To say it sticks the landing is an understatement.\n\nI get it though: if you can’t endure Seasons 1 and 2, then just read their synopsis and skip right to the good part of the party. The tacos are worth it.\n\nI’ll be somewhat vague on details here so as not to spoil specific plot elements, though these stills may reveal story and character beats.\n\nBias up front: I was a kid in the 80’s, from Indiana. Stranger Things is high-grade, pure-cut nostalgia crack for someone like me.\n\nStranger Things Season 1 was an incredible achievement. In many ways it kicked off an entire genre of nostalgia-bait lookalike projects that often fell flat. In my opinion, Seasons 2 and 3 did a good job at character work, delivered some entertaining moments but lacked some of the thrill of the essential mystery of the first season. There is a formula to it and the formula gets to be pretty obvious.\n\nThat formula usually looks something like this:\n\nHey, Remember the 80s? -> Characters Pair off and Adventure -> Eleven screams and force-chokes a portal -> Roll Credits and Synth Track.\n\nDespite my love for the material I have to admit I’ve been giving my Netflix subscription the stink-eye lately. The subscription cost keeps creeping up while the utility and entertainment we get from Netflix keeps falling. I often see Netflix properties as Great-Value Brand knock-offs of better shows. They’ve hooked me and cancelled several series without providing adequate closure. To the point that I’m often hesitant to engage with newly buzzing series; defense against future rug-pulls.\n\nAs of episode 7, Stranger Things Season 4 is an incredible outing for the series. If they stick the landing, it may be the best yet. Netflix spared no expense, spending an average of $30 million per episode and it shows. After watching the series, I’m going to cut that Netflix subscription some slack.\n\nShot-blocking and composition are particularly inventive this season. There are some outstanding scene transitions, also in service of the story and designed to clue to viewer into plot details. Thematically, there is a two-sides motif that is often aided by the rotational transitions between Hawkins and the Upside Down. Low camera angles can establish hero shots or be used to put the viewer into the perspective of a child and they use this brilliantly. They often lean into zoom shots instead of dolly works, the zoom-pulls and pushes being a staple of 80’s horror.\n\nThe soundtrack is very good - and you guessed it: also services the story. You’ll notice Kate Bush climbed the iTunes chart to Number 1 this week in part thanks to in-story use of one of her songs.\n\nThe show explores the 80’s Satanic Panic and Parental overreaction. It also explores Bullying and the “Other-ification” of people, conformity and demagoguery. These things could be mirror-allegories for modern times but the Duffers are here to entertain, not preach - and it all lands without being overbearing.\n\nHonestly, after a month or so of force-feeding my eyeballs some truly laughable modern content: I found Stranger Things Season 4a to be a brilliant and refreshing departure. The writing is excellent, the old characters are even better and new characters really hit the spot. A new character, Eddie - immediately became one of my favorites. Argyle and his not-quite mystery-machine van are a nice addition, as well.\n\nMuch like the Purple Palm Tree Delight, Stranger Things Season 4 is a real treat.\n\nTwo great podcasts to check out:\n\nAs always, I’m a big fan of the guys over at Bald Move:\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dungeons-and-demogorgons-a-stranger-things-podcast/id1296708934\n\nThe Streaming Things Podcast is also quite entertaining:\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/streaming-things-a-stranger-things-podcast/id1291620241"
