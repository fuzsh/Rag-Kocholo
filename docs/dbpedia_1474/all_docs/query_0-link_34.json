        "text": "WARNING: This will have spoilers for the entire story of Mortal Kombat. Don't ruin it for yourselves, guys.\n\nWARNING: tl;dr takes place here... tons of it\n\nI didn’t know until now, but I’ve recently come to the realization that the storyline of two of the biggest and most well-known factions of Mortal Kombat, The Special Forces and the Black Dragon, are pretty unknown. These two influential groups have been intertwined since before the very beginning of the series and their fates will most likely lead into each other until the end.\n\nThe Special Forces was created in by the United States of America in order to oppose large organized crime syndicates and gangs, the Black Dragon in particular. For years they have kept not just America but the world safe from the destruction brought on by these criminals.\n\nMajor Jackson Briggs, or “Jax” for short, is a high ranking officer in the Special Forces. He is a cybernetically enhanced super soldier, but before he gained his infamous metal arms, the Special Forces had captured several Black Dragon members: No Face, Tasia, Tremor, and Jarek. They were able to make a prison break thanks to the help of Kano, the current leader of the Black Dragon clan. During an attempt to recapture the criminals, many of Jax's men were overpowered and slaughtered by Kano's band.\n\nJax hunted each and everyone of his men down and defeated them, using an experimental beta version of the famous cybernetic arms that he uses now. During the mission, Jax learned that Kano was using an artifact called the Eye of Chitian. This stone has the ability to transport people between dimensions and Jax followed Kano into an unknown dimension.\n\nYes, Jax was the first Earthrealm warrior of light to enter another realm.\n\nJax would face Kano and subdue him in battle, then arrest him and take the Eye of Chitian as evidence and a means to return home.\n\nDuring the events of the penultimate Mortal Kombat tournament, Kano had escaped the custody of the Special Forces. He had made his way onto a ship to Shang Tsung's island. Hearing that the island was filled with gold and treasures, he agreed to join the Mortal Kombat tournament in hopes to steal the treasure for his Clan.\n\nMeanwhile, Sonya Blade and her team had made their way onto the island in hot pursuit of Kano. During the events of the Eye of Chitian he had murdered her old partner (from ear to ear) and Ms. Blade had a grudge. She and her men were captured by Shang Tsung and Sonya would be forced to fight in the tournament or see her men die. Shang Tsung did not honor their deal, though, and had her entire unit murdered while she fought in the tournament.\n\nShang Tsung would eventually be defeated by the Shaolin warriror, Liu Kang, but he had an ace up his sleeve. The mighty four armed Shokan, Goro would attack. Kano would be forced to work together with his most hated adversary, Sonya, and her new teammate Johnny Cage for his life. After Goro's defeat, Shang Tsung's island would begin to crumble and Sonya and Kano would soon after be captured by Shang Tsung's forces.\n\nJax would pick up Johnny Cage later on and after not believing his story about Sonya would have him arrested. Soon Jax would get a message from Sonya, learning that she actually was working with Kano to escape Outworld and their newest threat. Jax would apologize to Cage by appearing at a commercial shoot with Cage warning people of Outworld. Kintaro would lead an attack on Jax and Cage in an attempt to silence the warnings, but Jax stopped Kintaro. Be3fore their fight could finish, Raiden appeared with Liu Kang, Kung Lao and the rest of the Warriors of Light.\n\nJax entered the final Mortal Kombat tournament in hopes of defeating Shao Khan and rescuing Sonya. In the ensuing battle, Jax would save Sonya and together they would defeat and arrest Kano. Liu Kang defeated Shao Khan and they would all escape Outworld, however Kano escaped capture. Jax attempted to warn the American government of Outworld, but they did not believe him. This would prove costly.\n\nShao Khan decided that a tournament was not worth it, since there was always a chance he would lose. He went for a more direct approach and decided to directly attack Earthrealm. His invasion claimed countless lives, but one escapee would be Kabal, one of the most loyal members of the Black Dragon Clan. He would escape Shao Khan's termination forces, but not without being gravely injured and his throat being slit open, forcing him to wear his respirator.\n\nBefore the invasion, Sonya and Jax decided to prepare for an attack by Outworld on their own, since the government did not believe them. They would survive the attack by Shao Khan and work with Raiden in order to face Shao Khan.\n\nKano decided to contact Shao Khan and fight for the winning team. He promised his knowledge of Earthrealm weaponry to Shao Khan and joined his army. Kano and Sonya would meet during the invasion on a rooftop and the battle would end with Sonya flinging Kano off of the roof to his death, Kano grabbing a lock of her hair as he fell.\n\nJax would finally be believed about Outworld and be made the leader of a new organization: The Outer world Investigation Agency.\n\nDuring Shinnok's attack on the Realms, Jarek escaped into Outworld, believing himself to be the last living member of the Black Dragon. Sonya and Jax would fight alongside Raiden again in order to stop Shinnok and defeat Jarek. Jax ended up meeting Jarek at a cliffside and killing him by tossing him over.\n\nNOTE: THE VIDEO SHOWN IS NOT COMPLETELY ACCURATE. JAREK WAS NOT ABLE TO KILL SONYA AT THE CLIFF AND IT IS UNKNOWN IF SHE WAS PRESENT AT JAREK'S DEATH\n\nJax and Sonya later would find a badly damaged Cyrax and work to revive him, reprogram him, and finally return his soul into his body. To show his appreciation, Cyrax would join the Special Forces and become a valuable ally.\n\nAround this time, Kabal would have been defeated and slain by a warriror named Mavado, a member of the Red Dragon Clan and his hookswords claimed.\n\nJax and Sonya would be called upon by Raiden once again to fight for Earthrealm. They met with Raiden in order to work together and stop the appearance of the Deadly Alliance, a new team of evil formed by the two powerful sorcerers Shang Tsung and Quan Chi. They had already killed Liu Kang and Shao Khan as their first acts and now planned to create a Soulnado that would rightly claim the world as their own.\n\nBoth agents had their own agenda. A traitor had been found in the Special Forces. Hsu Hao had his Red Dragon clan members to nuke the Special Forces base, killing dozens of men and causing agents Cyrax and Kenshi to go missing. Jax used the mission against the Deadly Alliance to find Hsu Hao and make him pay.\n\nMeanwhile, Sonya planned to go find Cyrax and Kenshi, while staying away from new Warrior of Light member Frost, who she really didn't like. Kano was promoted by Shao Khan into a general and was an excellent one indeed.\n\nSonya would fail in her mission, but Jax found Hsu Hao and brutally ripped his heart out as punishment for his attack.\n\nKano would be successful in pushing back Kitana's forces and defeating the army. He returned to his emperor in time to watch the Deadly Alliance murder him. Quick to see when it's time to flip sides, Kano pledged allegiance to his new leaders. They had him oversee the enslavement of a village and his cruelty would cause the warrior Li Mei to attack him in fury.\n\nThe battle against the Deadly Alliance would end terribly, though. The battle would kill Jax and Sonya, claiming their souls for the Dragon King, Onaga. Meanwhile the Deadly Alliance promised Mavado that if he would work with them, he would eb allowed to fight Kano. Mavado would win this battle and take Kano prisoner.\n\nAs Onaga reclaimed his throne, Kabal was dying. His battle with Mavado a long time ago left him weakened beyond belief, but he was taken care of by Havik. Havik wanted the Black Dragon to rise again in order to be a force of chaos. Kabal follwed his intruction and faced Mavado. He defeated the Red Dragon warrior and claimed his hookswords back. He defeated one of the stronger warriors of MK using twin blades BARE HANDED.\n\nKabal recruited two new warriors for his clan: Kira and Kobra.\n\nKira was a weapons dealer, who disguised herself as a man in order to sell to terrorists. Her identity was found out at one point and she fought her way out, defeating dozens of terrorists only to meet Kabal. He saw her deadly fighting abilities and her cunning ways and decided to recruit her in the Black Dragon. She hastily agreed.\n\nKobra was a martial artist who wasn't allowed to harm his partners in his school. He wanted to test if his abilities would help him in a real fight and started defeating gangs of New York, becoming a vigilante of sorts. This stopped when he began to kill. Kobra began to kill his victims and robbed people, sending new York into a craze. He was soon caught by the police and before they could imprison him, he was freed by Kabal and Kira. With little options left, Kobra oined the Black Dragon and followed Kabal and Kira to Outworld, where they worked under Havik for some time.\n\nKabal wanted to truly test these two as warriors and had them help in the battle against Onaga.\n\nAfter Onaga's defeat, Ermac worked alongside the spirit of Liu Kang to free their fallen allies, bringing Jax and Sonya back to life. Kabal was pleased with Kobra and Kira as Black Dragon members and they began to recruit more warriors.\n\nYears would pass and Taven would begin his battle to find himself and his family. Kobra and Kira met Taven briefly, ending with Taven defeating Kobra then later Kabal. Taven would later get captured by Sektor and saved by Sonya, who he would defeat. Taven later found Kano in a Red Dragon base, and he had been experimented on and tortured by them for some time in order to create a monster army.\n\nThe Special Forces and Black Dragon would all meet at the infamous Battle of Armageddon and all die. Sonya would be cut in half, Jax would die by a warrior's spear, Kano and Kira would fall to their deaths, Kabal and Kobra had unknown deaths, and Jarek died with shame and failure.\n\nAnd of course, Raiden would bring time back.\n\nWhat lies in store for the Special Forces and The Black Dragon? Who could ever know besides NRS? With the majority of both factions dead, there may not be much left for their rivalry. However there's always a new war threatening to unbalance the realms and that means there is also always hope. Maybe a new Special Forces will rise to combat the newest threat.\n\nWhile not particularly deep characters on their own, Sonya and Jax's friendly partnership and teamwork serves to make them a quite popular duo. Including their rivalry with Kano simply makes it deeper.\n\nKano is regarded as a very fun character, simply because of his bad attitude and of course his heavy inspiration from the late Trevor Goddard.\n\nKabal has gained infamy for being such a powerful character gameplay wise, however was not ever extremely important in the storyline of Mortal Kombat until the most recent edition.\n\nAnyway, the characters are all ingrained into the history of Mortal Kombat. While alone they are not truly important, together they create a \"special\" force that helps to carry this story.\n\ntl;dr: A look at the story of the rivalry between Special Forces and The Black Dragon.
