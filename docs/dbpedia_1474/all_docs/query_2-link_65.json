        "text": "I have tried many other games and Criminal Case is the only one that I have gained proficiency at in the way of the complexity of the cases, the variety of scenarios and the diversity of characters. I have Parkinson's disease and I find my brain benefiting from this game. I don't sleep more than 3-4 hours at a stretch and consequently I am up in the middle of the night playing. This allows me to play more over the span of a day than most people. I love recommending this game to family and friends. It relieves some of the stress that comes with everyday living and allows me to escape into a world that is highly organized and fun to play. I also liked the videos because I did download many other games that I was not aware of earlier. I'm going to keep my rating at 5 stars because I still like the game immensely but it just needs a little tweaking. Iâve been playing for over 3 years and now play Mysteries of the Past as well as Save the World. I just canât seem to get enough of Criminal Case. The roulette wheel is ingenious. Thank you so much.\n\nBoth me and my mom love to play this game. However I donât play all the time so I havenât been keeping up with all the episodes. My mom has and she has been able to play Pacific Bay, Worlds Edition, Mysteryâs of the Past all from one app. I got done with Grimsborough and want to move on to Pacific Bay but when I do I have to download a separate app to do so. I wouldnât mind this if all my progress like my level, my avatar, my pet, my money, and my rings came with me. They donât and I have to start over from square 1 again. Can you pls fix this to were those of us who want start at Grimsborough can play through the story without having to start as a rookie again every time we move to a new episode! Or at least put a progress sync or something in the other apps that will let us sync our progress from the other games. If people want to start at Pacific Bay fine, but donât punish those who want to start the story from the beginning! I have tried to email you about this problem twice already and got the same generic âCheck the FAQâ response. I want to continue to play this game as I love it, but I donât want to start over and get a tutorial when I know what to do. Pls listen to your fan base and do something about this!\n\nI have been playing these games for years, especially the first one created. I play it on my iPad mini. I have had so many issues with it crashing. I counted at least 25 videos that I watched to receive energy and I never received it. The screen would go black, gray or white and then crash. The same goes for watching videos for cash, but I only counted 12. There were 3 times that I spent $5000 on a round of investigation and it crashed while I was playing, so there went that money. I'm beyond frustrated. I have tried several times to follow the instructions given in the troubleshoot. It's horrible that they send you a message saying that this is going to be the only contact that you receive from us. What happened to talking to real people and getting help with a problem? I rarely play the games anymore. I've put so much time and effort into it that I'm torn. I really do not want to shut it down and lose all my progress. I definitely think this game and its makers/customer service has several issues to work on. Your players are committed to playing your game, please be committed to helping them when they have an outrageous number of errors.\n\nI tried playing it on my iPhone but it takes me back to near the beginning of the game. I can't even sync my devices to be at the same place in the game. Would love some help!"
