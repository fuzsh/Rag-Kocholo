        "text": "Page 71 →Three Mortal Kontroversy; or, Dispatches from the Console Wars\n\nAnxieties over video game violence stretch back to the golden age of the coin-operated arcade market, with Exidy’s Death Race (1976)—an unauthorized spin-off of the New World Pictures exploitation movie Death Race 2000 (Paul Bartel, 1975)—representing perhaps the most notable early case (Kocurek 2015a). However, as Ian Bogost (2015, 47, 49) notes, when games could make more reasonable claims to realism, and therefore inspire similar anxieties as film and television violence, such content’s entry into the home became increasingly targeted by moral entrepreneurs. Carly A. Kocurek (2015a, 14) suggests it is important not to flatly dismiss the arguments of “would-be moral reformers,” since “to argue that video games are not a legitimate source for serious social concern would be to argue against their cultural significance.” The crisis moment that specifically developed around Mortal Kombat and several other video games—reaching its height between the former’s September 1993 release to home consoles and the United States Congress’ July 1994 Page 72 →endorsement of the industry’s self-applied ratings system—has been previously chronicled by Steven L. Kent (2001), Blake J. Harris (2014), and others cited in this chapter. Since video of the full Senate hearings on video game violence is readily available in the C-SPAN (1993; 1994) online archives for the benefit of people with a few hours to kill, I will not rehash these hearings at length. Instead I will focus on their major rhetorical threads and how they resonated with voices that have been less explored in the wider debate, such as critics and readers of major gaming magazines.\n\nIn particular, I will posit that Mortal Kombat became the poster child for video game violence not only because its cinematic qualities corresponded with its huge popularity, but also because the game represented the related “threat” of disreputable arcade content’s entry into the private family sphere at a moment when an emerging generation of 16-bit home consoles like the SEGA Genesis (released in 1988–89) and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES; released in 1990–91) achieved widespread market penetration. The domestic infiltration of photorealistic violence that more closely approximated—but did not wholly reproduce—the audiovisual quality of arcade machines allowed home ports of the first two Mortal Kombat games to serve as a referendum on the technological capacities of the newly popular 16-bit consoles. The arcade war between MKI and SFII thus mapped onto the growing industrial battle between SEGA and Nintendo for dominance of the home market, while reviews of their respective ports weighed in on whether Mortal Kombat’s blood and gore was a mere gimmick or an integral part of gameplay quality. Furthermore, psychologists used Mortal Kombat in a panoply of media-effects studies that set the stage for later debates over first-person-shooter (FPS) games and other violent genres. Revisiting this controversy from multiple angles therefore reveals a set of anxieties over technological change that continue to have timely resonances to this day.\n\nArcade Violence Comes Home\n\nThe three video games singled out in the December 9, 1993, joint hearings of the U.S. Senate Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Government Regulation and Information and the Judiciary Subcommittee on Juvenile Justice—MKI, Night Trap, and Lethal Enforcers—had all premiered in October 1992, although only MKI and Lethal Enforcers began life in the coin-op market, where they generated little controversy. SEGA of America president Tom Kalinske recalls that parents had begun complainingPage 73 → about Genesis game content in March/April of 1992 and that there had been rumblings about supposed “subliminal messages” in SEGA’s rapidly edited television commercials (Kunkel 1993c, 35; Harris 2014, 405). But it was the impending Genesis port of MKI that led SEGA to create the Videogame Ratings Council (VRC) in May 1993, which would self-apply ratings to SEGA’s games and presumably serve as a model for wider industry adoption. Headed by Arthur Pober, former director of the Children’s Advertising Review Unit of the Council for Better Business Bureaus, the VRC created parental advisory labels modeled after the Motion Picture Association of America’s (MPAA) age-based classifications: GA (General Audiences), MA-13 (Mature Audiences over 13), and MA-17 (Mature Audiences over 17). The MPAA had, in fact, refused Kalinske’s initial request to include video games under their existing ratings system, as the movie industry did not want to take oversight of an additional medium outside their purview, and even threatened to sue SEGA for copyright infringement if they self-applied the extant MPAA ratings (Kunkel 1993c, 35; Harris 2014, 404–5, 423, 428–29). As I note below, however, it was the increasingly cinematic qualities of these video games that raised such concerns in the first place—and the fact that, much like the legal status of movies prior to Burstyn v. Wilson (1952),1 video games were not yet considered a form of “protected speech” under the First Amendment and therefore still subject to prior restraint.\n\nIt was not until the home console release of MKI on September 13, 1993 (dubbed “Mortal Monday” in publicity materials), that major publications began widely reporting on its violent content—with Sub-Zero’s Spine Rip and Kano’s Heart Rip fatalities earning the most notoriety in such coverage (see Gruson 1993; Cohen 1993; Elmer-Dewitt and Dickerson 1993). Because the blood and uncensored fatalities could be unlocked on SEGA ports only by inputting a not-so-secret “blood code,” this created a loophole for the default gameplay to get away with an MA-13 rating, not unlike the arcade cabinets’ DIP switch option for family-friendly locales. Nevertheless, on November 16, California’s attorney general, Daniel Lungren, held a press conference warning game companies to either clean up their content or face state bans from store shelves (Glionna 1993). The following day, U.S. senators Joseph Lieberman and Herbert Kohl announced their plans to introduce legislation that would force the industry to regulate itself or else face federal intervention within a year’s time, spurred into action after the nine-year-old son of Bill Andresen, Lieberman’s chief of staff, asked his father to buy him a copy of MKI (Kent 2001, 466–69; Harris 2014, 472–75).\n\nPage 74 →SEGA responded by agreeing with Lungren’s concerns and promoting its proactive establishment of the VRC as a guidance tool for parents—all talking points that SEGA’s vice president of marketing, Bill White, would repeat in his Senate testimony (C-SPAN 1993). But the editors and readers of Electronic Gaming Monthly were skeptical whether SEGA had done enough to educate the public about what its ratings meant, even in its own in-house magazine, SEGA Visions (Semrad 1994, 6; Wormdahl 1994, 16; “Sega Responds” 1994, 16, 18). Other readers hoped that the new ratings system would allow video games to incorporate more mature content beyond violence, such as sexual themes, but the editors of Electronic Games doubted that video games would be able to shake their predominant association with children’s entertainment, even alluding to Ralph Bakshi’s X-rated animated films (such as Fritz the Cat [1972]) as an example of how cartoonish forms and mature content had previously proved an awkward fit in another medium (Powell 1993, 8).\n\nMeanwhile, the irony that Mortal Kombat and its kin had not inspired outrage until brought beneath the roof of the family home, and the eyes of parents who didn’t frequent arcades, was not lost on some commentators: “Where were Mom and Dad and the Anti-Violence Coalition when Junior was slipping off to the arcade and spending dozens of dollars to rip out someone’s spinal cord?” (Carter and Carter 1993c; also see Kunkel 1993d, 46). Some skeptics thought that going after video games was little more than a convenient target to distract from the fact that other government efforts to curb violence, both in the media and on the streets, had largely failed (“Ratings” 1994; Harrington 1994; Kinder 1996, 26).2 Coming only a few years after the Parents Music Resource Center had convinced the Recording Industry Association of America to include “Parental Advisory” stickers on offending albums, and amid other outcries over the perceived raunchiness of early-1990s pop culture (e.g., The Simpsons [FOX, 1989–], Beavis & Butt-head [MTV, 1993–97], shock jock Howard Stern, and innumerable rock and hip-hop artists), Mortal Kombat and friends were easy objects for parental-cum-political outrage.\n\nDespite (or perhaps because of) the lack of adult supervision associated with such sites, American video arcades have long had a culturally “low” status as disreputable spaces, although these associations extend back to earlier sites of public gaming like pool halls and card rooms, and to sites of coin-operated entertainment like nickelodeons and casinos. According to Michael Ryan Skolnik and Steven Conway (2017, 4–9), these spaces all threatened social norms because they mixed diverse demographics of people, while the meritocracy of skilled gameplay could Page 75 →subvert many (but not all) existing social hierarchies. In mid-twentieth-century America, coin-operated businesses also had associations of being run by the mob, but by the rise of video game arcades in the recession-era 1970s, fears about economic precarity blamed arcades for enticing young men into wasting their time and money on frivolous leisure activities. Suspicions that arcades would drive youth toward petty crime to fund their video game habits were enjoined by fears that these spaces set apart from adult supervision would encourage child abductions and worse. Consequently, many arcades attempted to positively rebrand themselves as “family fun centers” to draw in a younger and more respectable clientele (Skolnik and Conway 2017, 5–6; Kocurek 2015a, 18, 26, 60, 94, 99, 106). Although the U.S. Supreme Court, in City of Mesquite v. Aladdin’s Castle, Inc. (1982), would strike down local efforts to restrict youth from entering arcades without adult supervision, arguing that young people’s freedom to consume video games was a (purchasable) form of free speech,3 lingering anxieties about the overall safety of such spaces encouraged arcade games to be ported onto consoles where children could play them under adult supervision, within the safety of the private home (Kocurek 2015a, 32, 113; Newman 2017, 99, 107, 158). Small wonder, then, that Craig Johnson of the Amusement and Music Operators Association was easily the most nonchalant of the industry representatives testifying at the December 1993 Senate hearing. He argued that the coin-op industry had no control over youth access to violent games, so arcade operators should not be held responsible for game designers’ bad taste; his only major objection was correcting the senators that Night Trap was never available in arcades to begin with (C-SPAN 1993).\n\nWhereas earlier electronic technologies like radio and television had been gradually incorporated into the domestic sphere (long gendered as a more “feminine” space than the “masculine” public sphere) through a focus on leisure as family bonding time (Spigel 1992), Bernadette Flynn (2003, 557–60, 565, 569) observes that most advertisements for home game consoles figured them as masculine “dream machines” whose associations with the boyzones of public play invaded the home to create a “third space” of exciting escapism from the domestic status quo (also see Newman 2017, 77, 80, 87). By the 1990s, earlier fears about video games as a uniquely dangerous medium in their own right had given way to comparisons between video games and other violent media, including media already common in the family home, such as movies and television (McKernan 2013, 317). Nevertheless, a recurring belief held that, unlike the “passively” consumed imagery of film and television,Page 76 → video games’ interactivity made their violent content particularly harmful to young gamers. In their deeply alarmist Senate testimonies (C-SPAN 1993), for example, psychologist Eugene Provenzo predicted that video games and television would soon converge into a “new type of television” verging on virtual reality, wherein interactive violence would become a ubiquitous part of the family home; while Marilyn Droz of the National Coalition Against Television Violence argued that rather than tallying the number of violent acts per hour, as the coalition did with television shows, video games required tallying acts of violence per minute.\n\nIt was therefore the longtime convention of video game interactivity, combined with a new generation of 16-bit consoles flooding the home market with increasingly arcade-quality graphics, that set the stage for this particular crisis moment. In other words, when the disreputable spaces of arcades threatened to collapse into the home via forms of violent content that had otherwise passed under parents’ radar, magical thinking about suspected media effects became that much more likely. One such seeming incitement to imitative violence, which was not already found in arcades, was the SEGA Activator peripheral (1993), an infrared full-body controller allowing the player to stand within an octagonal ring while real-life punches and kicks performed in their living room registered onscreen. Marketed for use with fighting games, the Options menu on the Genesis MKII port even lists the Activator as its default setting, though the device’s notoriously unresponsive interface meant it was never widely adopted. Worse still for parents concerned about verboten games entering their homes, new initiatives like the SEGA Channel (1994–98) and competing subscription-based services allowed games to be downloaded or played online via a household’s cable or phone modem (Harris 2014, 340, 423; Markoff 1994), potentially circumventing parental restrictions (at least until SEGA eventually introduced a ratings-based parental lock).4\n\nMuch like the 1980s “video nasties” moral panic and resulting censorship laws in Britain (Egan 2007; McKenna 2020), then, the growing adoption of a new home entertainment technology created the illusion that a sudden wave of filth and corruption, once restricted to urban spaces, was sweeping into “safe” family homes, with loudly voiced concerns over taboo content often superseding the underlying concerns over technological accessibility. And yet, despite this predominant focus on content, game designers were not directly called before the Senate subcommittees. Digital Pictures cofounder Tom Zito, for instance, attended the December hearing, but despite speaking up from the gallery to correct Page 77 →Senator Byron Dorgan’s mistaken impression that Zito was in absentia, he was still not called to submit a statement in defense of Night Trap (C-SPAN 1993). Because the senators had mistakenly conflated the major console makers with the developers of these third-party games, it was instead SEGA and Nintendo, the distributors of such games into the home, who were called to answer for their supposed sins. Whereas members of the gaming community certainly knew and celebrated designers like Mortal Kombat’s John Tobias and Ed Boon as auteurs responsible for the spectacular inclusion of playable violence, the non-gaming senators were ignorant of such distinctions between third-party game creators and first-party console creators.\n\nCinematic Qualities and Moral Alignments\n\nBefore delving into how SEGA’s and Nintendo’s respective corporate ethos inspired their responses to this controversy, we need to briefly examine the most salient trait that united the three most frequently targeted games. “Gone are the days when video games were just Pac-Man and other quaint characters,” Lieberman wrote to other members of Congress. “Advances in technology permit the latest video games to use real actors and actresses to depict murder, mutilation, and disfigurement in an extremely graphic manner. . . . Today’s graphic games may seem mild compared to the CD-ROM and virtual reality systems, which will change the market very soon” (Harris 2014, 474). Comparisons between cinema and the new photorealism of digital game violence were a common rhetorical means of arguing that these games were “not your father’s Pac-Man,” although the president of Acclaim Entertainment, which produced the Mortal Kombat home ports, downplayed such concerns: “We’re certainly not in the realm of creating film-quality realism” (Gruson 1993).\n\nThese games were all released during the 1989–95 period that Michele Pierson (2002, 48, 128) has called “the wonder years” of Hollywood special effects, when films like The Abyss (James Cameron, 1989), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), and Jurassic Park (Steven Spielberg, 1993) all combined the plasticity of computer-generated effects with the indexicality of photorealism, dazzling viewers with such new technological advances. While Mortal Kombat itself used more antiquated animation techniques (pixilation in combination with hand-drawn effects for the gore and supernatural elements), and would not rely on actual 3D modeling until MK4, its graphics rode a fine line between generating wonder Page 78 →and fear among those on opposite sides of what Gareth Schott (2016, 6) terms the “experience divide.” For Schott, this is the significant disparity between people’s opinions in whether video games can cause real-world violence; those with the least amount of experience playing video games are far more likely to ascribe harmful media effects to violent games than players who are intimately familiar with such games. I argue that the very uncanniness of Mortal Kombat’s pixilated sprites registered as that much more disturbing to moral reformers because pixilation’s treatment of live actors as posable objects, and its illusion of movement via dropped frames, create a “dehumanizing” effect that might also complement a game’s disturbing or dehumanizing themes (Ivins-Hulley 2013, 281; Perrott 2015, 124). It is no coincidence that violent games with more cartoonish sprites (such as the anime-inspired SFII) went barely mentioned during the Senate hearings, but some gamers were dismayed that footage from less violent games and genres was starting to be included in carelessly assembled news coverage of the controversy, seemingly made guilty by association (Raposa 1994, 12).\n\nAlthough Mortal Kombat’s photorealistic sprites have already been discussed in earlier chapters, Konami’s rail-shooter Lethal Enforcers used more rudimentary pixilation of photographed actors and backgrounds to provide realistic settings and enemies for its Dirty Harry–inspired (Don Siegel, 1971) light-gun action. Positioned as a Chicago cop, the player must shoot a seemingly endless series of weapon-toting enemies, and avoid hitting innocent bystanders, across several different shootout scenes: a bank holdup, a car chase, and so on (fig. 15). Lethal Enforcers inherited many of its movie-like traits from the coin-op laserdisc game Mad Dog McCree (American Laser Games, 1990), a rail-shooter using full-motion video to present the first-person-perspective story of a gunslinger cleaning up an Old West town. But whereas Mad Dog McCree has long, non-interactive periods of watching the FMV setup for each brief moment of actual gameplay, Lethal Enforcers uses its blocky and relatively unsophisticated animated sprites to create near-constant shooting action, a convention graphically improved upon in later rail-shooters like Atari’s Area 51 (1995). This may be why Lethal Enforcers earned an MA-17 rating when released on SEGA CD, while Mad Dog McCree’s port earned only an MA-13. The editor of Electronic Games also hypothesized that Mad Dog McCree’s Old West setting made its violence more palatable than Lethal Enforcers’ present-day urban settings (Kunkel 1993d, 46).5\n\nMuch like subsequent controversies over FPS games, critics singled out Lethal Enforcers for encouraging gun violence, although the game’s Page 79 →rough-edged law enforcement theme is more consistent with Dirty Harry’s right-wing gun fetishism and reworking of Old West–style justice in a modern guise. “As was the case with Kombat, nobody said a word about the arcade version of the game,” but now it is “guaranteed to be the next big hit on Capitol Hill,” the Washington Post opined (Carter and Carter 1993b). Whereas peripherals like the Lethal Enforcers light gun (“The Justifier”) were once attached to arcade cabinets, now this life-size plastic “weapon” was advertised for SEGA’s home consoles under the tagline “You won’t find a toy like this in any Cracker Jack box”—a shameless appeal to children, according to Herbert Kohl (C-SPAN 1993). Yet, I argue that rail-shooters are more properly “cinematic” than FPS games because players cannot actually control the camera movement as it moves along the predetermined “hard rail” like an amusement park ride, much as movie viewers are passively subject to the changes in angle and perspective determined by the director. With forward momentum along the rail permitted only by successfully clearing the screen of enemies, it is little surprise that the player’s trigger-happy progression seemed to outweigh any potentially redeeming themes of killing bad guys and making quick judgments to avoid shooting innocent civilians.\n\nThe most notorious game of the scandal, however, was Night Trap, an “interactive movie” originally developed by Digital Pictures for Hasbro’s NEMO (later renamed Control-Vision), an abandoned consolePage 80 → that would have used VHS tapes as cartridges for FMV gameplay. Designed to separate an ordinary VHS cassette’s magnetic tape into multiple video tracks through which the player could toggle (as compared to the random-access memory of laserdiscs and later CD-ROMs), this meant that gameplay was very limited beyond toggling between different, parallel-running audiovisual tracks. A spoof of already tongue-in-cheek horror movies such as the Slumber Party Massacre series (1982–90), Night Trap frames the player as an operative remotely conducting surveillance upon different rooms of a house where young women are endangered by black-clad, humanoid aliens attempting to harvest their blood. The player toggles between different camera feeds and remotely triggers traps to prevent the intruding aliens from catching the women, but because of the technological limitations of linear video, players can make only a few choices and must then passively watch the FMV action play out for long periods. Much like Mad Dog McCree’s FMV format, Night Trap lacks the constant interactivity of most games and thus made for an unsatisfying hybrid of cinema and video game.\n\nFilmed over three weeks in 1987 on a $1 million budget, Night Trap is far more hokey than horrific, but Sony nevertheless purchased the rights to it and three other “interactive movies” when the NEMO was abandoned. The 1991–92 introduction of the SEGA CD peripheral as an add-on to the 16-bit Genesis allowed Sony to finally bring Night Trap to market in fall 1992. But the fact that the Genesis base console could not run FMV at full screen, was limited to a 16-color palette vastly inferior to even VHS, and whose CD-ROM peripheral required long loading times, all added up to a title that would have quickly vanished were it not for the controversy ginned up by moralists who clearly had not even played the game (Perron 2008, 129–31; Donovan 2010, 184; Russell 2012, 73–75; Kocurek 2019). During the Senate hearings, for example, Byron Dorgan posited that Night Trap’s gameplay has a goal of killing women and should qualify as “child abuse” if minors were allowed to play it, while Marilyn Droz was convinced that the game trains young boys to commit sexual violence (C-SPAN 1993). But even some critics who recognized that the game’s goal was to actually save the women and stop the aliens still complained that it encouraged young men to take chauvinistic pleasure in rescuing scantily clad damsels in distress (Kinder 1996, 34–35). Although Night Trap was arguably the most controversial (and most literally cinematic) game of the three targeted titles, in the end it simply did not have Mortal Kombat’s wide reach, because it was only available on the relatively unpopular SEGA CD and Panasonic’s then-new 3DO Page 81 →console (1993). Unsurprisingly, then, when major retailers like Toys “R” Us, Kmart, Walmart, and Kay-Bee Toys all removed Night Trap from their shelves, Mortal Kombat remained on sale, under the excuse that it did not contain a comparable level of violence against “real female images” (“2 Toy” 1993).\n\nIronically, though, both Lethal Enforcers and Night Trap have prosocial narratives beneath their lurid spectacles of violence, with stopping crime or other evil as the main gameplay goals. The Mortal Kombat games, by contrast, may have Manichean framing narratives about the forces of good fighting against evil figures like Shang Tsung and Shao Kahn, but the fact that one can also choose to play and win the game as an “evil” character means that moral values are less narratively ingrained in gameplay itself. Again, it is possible to win Mortal Kombat without performing fatalities—and even the most nominally heroic character, Liu Kang, has a gore-free fatality move in each of the first two games (the screen does not go dark when he performs his Uppercut fatality in MKI, suggesting his moral righteousness). Moreover, in Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe (Midway, 2008), the crossover between Midway’s amoral universe and DC’s morally bound superheroes means that characters like Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman cannot perform fatalities, but rather “Heroic Brutality” finishing moves that beat the defeated opponent into submission while keeping them alive to face justice. The intersection of these two preexisting story worlds, then, highlights the different moral alignments in each and the fact that the Mortal Kombat games permit players the choice to engage in antisocial values but still remain victorious, unlike either Lethal Enforcers or Night Trap.\n\nMoral reformers may have accused video game designers of cynically peddling violence to children for the sake of industry profits, but many young gamers were far less convinced about Mortal Kombat’s potential to harm. While some youth were appalled by the violence, or angry that fighting games threatened to give all video games a bad name, others excused the games as harmless fantasy or as merely a symptom of wider trends in media violence (see “Youth Opinion” 1993; “Violence in Games” 1993, 12; “Video Violence” 1994, 12). John Tobias has since described Mortal Kombat as the product of an era when video games themselves were growing up and gaining older players (Hickey 2018, 178), although this metaphor of gaining maturity is undercut by the game’s own advertisements, such as one featuring the Raiden and Kano live actors emerging from the MKI cabinet’s screen to menace two children, beneath the tagline “So Real It Hurts!” The senators who convened the Page 82 →hearings repeatedly expressed concern that, even with the VRC ratings system, age-inappropriate games might still be advertised to children in magazines and on television, especially if third-party advertisers were not required to prominently display the ratings (C-SPAN 1993).\n\nMeanwhile, some Mortal Kombat fans were furious at the government’s censorship threats, but their responses did not help their own case. Electronic Gaming Monthly’s envelope art contest, for instance, asked readers to illustrate “what would happen if video game characters attended the video game violence hearing,” and the resulting submissions of blood-soaked fan art depict Mortal Kombat characters gloating over the senators’ headless corpses (“EGM!” 1994, 20). Several of the fighting games attempting to cash in on Mortal Kombat’s success went a step further, with a photo of Lieberman’s head superimposed onto one of the character sprites as a hidden fighter in BloodStorm (Incredible Technologies [U.S.], 1994), and Eternal Champions: Challenge from the Dark Side (SEGA [U.S.], 1995) including a hidden character named “The Senator,” whose special moves include throwing “red tape” and whose finishing moves include impaling his opponent atop the Washington Monument.\n\nOverall, the controversy predictably backfired by heightening sales of all three games, especially in the case of Night Trap, whose sales were previously very low due to its lack of engaging gameplay, limited availability on unpopular consoles, and absence of an in-built audience from a coin-op run. As Michel Foucault (1990, 18, 84, 104–5) has demonstrated, widespread public anxieties over supposedly deviant behavior, and attendant efforts to censor or repress offending material, usually incite a boom in public discourse that makes such behavior all the more likely. During the Victorian era, this included hysteria over the supposed “threat” of masturbation, and it is not difficult to see the heavily policed figure of the masturbating child inherited by the similarly nonproductive, onanistic finger-twiddling of the juvenile video gamer. Of course, one doesn’t have to be a Foucauldian to understand this logic; one needs only to have been a preteen gamer reacting to adult/parental pronouncements with greater curiosity and desire to engage with taboo materials than if such games had simply been left alone.\n\nIndustrial Bloodsport: SEGA vs. Nintendo\n\nPut on the congressional hot seat for disseminating such material into the home, industry leaders SEGA and Nintendo responded to the charges in ways reflecting their own increasing battle for market supremacy. Recall Page 83 →that SFII and MKI were already positioned as dueling warriors in the coin-op market even before this rivalry spilled over into the respective contest between 16-bit home consoles, which became open animosity during the December 1993 Senate hearings. SFII had been ported to the SNES in summer 1992, quickly becoming a best seller and acclaimed as perhaps the best fighting game yet released on the then-new console. Capcom’s licensing deal with Nintendo prevented a SEGA port from appearing until SFII: Champion Edition was released for Genesis in September 1993, several weeks after the home console release of MKI. This effectively meant that SFII became more closely associated with the SNES while MKI was more strongly linked to the Genesis, since SEGA’s inclusion of blood and gore meant that its ports were closer to the arcade experience than Nintendo’s ports. Even when the 1993 coin-op sequels MKII and Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers were ported in mid-1994, gaming magazines framed their release as a “war” for “crown[ing] the king of home fighting games” (“Special . . . Challengers” 1994, 128; also see Tummynator 1993, 56). “Both MKII and SSFII Turbo are machines from the same family, but they’re two different beasts,” read another metaphor. “While SSFII can be considered the roadster of fighting games, MKII is the muscle car” (Constant 1994, 10). Both franchises remained for many months at or near the top of 1993–94 best-seller charts for home consoles and would receive gaming magazine accolades as among those years’ best games.\n\nAs Kevin Flanagan (2017, 448–49) observes, technological limitations and third-party development mean that porting from arcade machine to home console is inevitably a process of adaptation and one that adheres to what adaptation studies terms the “fidelity paradigm.” For example, a given port’s closeness to “arcade-perfect” quality often receives superior reviews, and typically becomes the biggest selling iteration. In the battle between Nintendo and SEGA, however, Mortal Kombat tested not only the technical capacities of each 16-bit console but also each company’s corporate standards. Rather than following Capcom’s strategy of brand loyalty to Nintendo via delayed license, Acclaim, Mortal Kombat’s publisher for its home ports, licensed the game to both Nintendo and SEGA for the widely hyped “Mortal Monday” simultaneous release, following a blockbuster release strategy that SEGA had previously used for its Genesis release of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (SEGA, 1992). According to Blake J. Harris (2014, 88, 227, 274, 357–58, 447, 469), Acclaim’s decision set up the MKI release as a head-to-head contest over the technical merits of each console, especially at a time when Sonic 2’s success had Page 84 →already allowed SEGA to pull even with Nintendo’s market share. Having beaten Nintendo’s own 16-bit system to market by about two years, SEGA had touted the Genesis as a far more advanced system than the 8-bit NES, even as the Genesis’ faster processing capabilities were eventually outdone by the SNES’ greater graphical capabilities. Much as an earlier proprietary battle between Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out!! (Nintendo, 1987) for the 8-bit NES versus James “Buster” Douglas Knockout Boxing (Taito [JP], 1990) for the 16-bit Genesis had attempted to frame Douglas’s real-life defeat of Tyson as what SEGA would soon do to Nintendo, the simultaneous release of MKI on both the Genesis and SNES, backed by Acclaim’s $10 million advertising budget, would test each 16-bit console’s might.\n\nAnd yet Nintendo had already handicapped itself in this fight, as its company policy since 1985 had been to ensure not only effective gameplay design on its systems (the Nintendo “Seal of Quality” sported on game boxes) but also a family-friendly experience for its core gaming demographic of children. By contrast, SEGA’s move into the 16-bit era was promoted via a rebranded corporate image as a more rebellious and technologically advanced company with an older but hipper demographic of teens and young adults. As Harris (2014, 98, 142, 280, 310) notes, SEGA’s corporate ethos represented “freedom” as opposed to Nintendo’s tight control over its licensees, even if that meant that the quality of games released on SEGA consoles might be more mixed and could contain potentially risqué content. During the December 1993 Senate hearings, for example, Nintendo’s senior vice president Howard Lincoln forcefully asserted that games like Night Trap “will never appear on a Nintendo system” because children under fourteen remained its core users, whereas SEGA’s Bill White noted that the average Genesis user was nineteen years old and that 60 percent of SEGA CD owners were adults—hence the need for a voluntary ratings system that would do for video games what the MPAA ratings system had done for expanding permissible movie content (C-SPAN 1993). SEGA and Digital Pictures even suspected Nintendo of conspiracy to disrupt SEGA’s rising market share (Kent 2001, 466–67), to which Perrin Kaplan, Nintendo of America’s vice president of marketing and corporate affairs, has since admitted: “We actually leaked Night Trap to some press ahead of time. . . . It was basically to get more attention off of us because we wanted to remain as that wholesome company” (Klepek 2016).\n\nAcclaim had subcontracted development of the MKI home ports to Probe Software—with the exception of the SNES port being handled by Sculptured Software because of their greater familiarity with the SNES—andPage 85 → both studios consulted with each other over the challenges of porting a game whose photorealistic sprites rendered its overall size larger than normal for 16-bit cartridges (Kunkel 1993a, 54–55). (Due to their far smaller cartridge capacities, the 8-bit Nintendo Game Boy and SEGA Game Gear ports each lost a playable character.) Because these home consoles had only a fraction of the arcade board’s processing power, Probe and Sculptured were given access to the arcade assembly code, converting as much as possible for the 16-bit systems “while creating and optimizing the rest by hand, based on frame-by-frame analysis of the arcade game” (Myers 2018). Based on unfinished demos, advance word from the Winter 1993 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) suggested that the only major qualitative difference between the SNES and Genesis ports would be the lack of blood and gore in Nintendo’s versions, while also suggesting that a new controller might have to be developed to properly translate the game’s five-button coin-op interface (“Mortal Kombat” 1993, EGM, 88–89). In the SNES port, the blood sprites would be rendered gray for “sweat” instead of blood (though the Game Boy’s monochromatic display made this moot), and its gorier fatalities would be reanimated to less bloody effect. The company’s in-house magazine Nintendo Power attempted to positively spin these changes as “exclusive extra Finishing Moves”; for instance, instead of Raiden electrocuting his opponent’s head until it bursts in a fountain of blood, he now fries their body into a tastefully discrete pile of ash (“Mortal . . . Dangerous Conflict” 1993, 18). Sculptured Software—many of whose Utah-based employees were social conservatives who flatly refused to work on the project—would sketch out ideas for these bloodless finishing moves, send them to both Midway and Nintendo for approval, and then develop the animation by primarily adapting from existing sprites (Myers 2018).\n\nWith the threat of censorship marking MKI’s move into the supposedly “feminine” realm of domesticity, disgruntled (male) fans worried that “without the violence, MK will just be another poor Street Fighter clone” (Masui 1993, 12). They began writing thousands of letters, unsuccessfully trying to convince Nintendo to reconsider its stance, while Electronic Gaming Monthly editor Ed Semrad lambasted Nintendo for “playing God again” by delivering a game that would satisfy no one: still inherently violent in concept, and thus liable to offend parents, but sanitized to an extent that fans clearly knew what they were missing (Semrad 1993, 4). Lincoln indeed conceded in his Senate testimony that the decision to hold firm had come at significant cost (C-SPAN 1993). Although published estimates vary, the Genesis port of MKI is said to have outsold Page 86 →the SNES port by margins ranging from two- or five-to-one, and SEGA subsequently pulled ahead with 55 percent of total market share in home consoles (until later overtaken after the SNES hit Donkey Kong Country [Rare, 1994]) (Harris 2014, 472, 522).\n\nAll fighting games for SEGA consoles automatically received an MA-13 rating under the VRC, but as noted above, the Genesis and Game Gear ports of MKI would have likely received an MA-17 rating were it not for the absence of blood and fatalities in their default modes. Unlike most cheat codes, the Genesis port not-so-subtly teases the existence of the blood code in a pre-title screen alluding to the Shaolin martial-arts tournament’s “ethical code,” the combatants’ shared “code of honor,” and finally how “another type of code could be defined as an arbitrary system of symbols or letters . . . a secret code. Mortal Kombat adheres to many codes, but does it contain one?” The port’s co-publisher Arena Entertainment made the blood code available through their customer service line (much as SNK did with its first two Samurai Shodown [1993–94] ports for the Neo●Geo home console), and all of the major gaming magazines published it as well (“Mortal Kombat” 1993, SEGA Visions, 15, 23; Lee 1995, 14). It became so widely known that entering the blood code (ABACABB) to unlock what was also dubbed “Mode A” became nearly as second nature for Genesis players of my generation as switching on the console itself. One desperate fan who missed out, however, wrote in to Electronic Games requesting either the code itself or the price tag for an MKI coin-op cabinet (an estimated $1,200–3,000) (“Game Doctor” 1993, 28).\n\nMKI reviews thus framed the underlying differences between SNES and Genesis ports via questions about whether faithfully reproducing the arcade experience was linked to more closely emulating the quality of gameplay (a debate framed by each console’s technical capabilities) or the gimmickry of gore (a debate over the cultural value of Midway’s original coin-op game). Electronic Gaming Monthly’s reviewers, for example, gave higher scores to the Genesis port for being closer to the arcade’s overall gameplay (“Review . . . Genesis” 1993, 34), even if the SNES version looked graphically superior. The SNES port, meanwhile, was “an excellent reproduction in both looks and sounds,” but “the only thing this game really had going for it was the blood and fatalities,” therefore qualitatively paling in comparison to the SNES port of SFII (“Review . . . SNES” 1993, 26). Other reviews concurred that the Genesis port was faster and its controls more responsive—even if the need for a six-button controller was a common refrain—while the SNES version Page 87 →sported more faithfully reproduced character sprites and a richer color palette, albeit one where the color red was conspicuously absent.\n\nDissenting views suggested that the SNES port’s superior audiovisual quality would compensate for the lack of blood and noted that some of the arcade version’s combos and other gameplay strategies were missing from the Genesis port—partly due to the ports being rushed to market in time for the much-hyped “Mortal Monday” release date (“Video Game Gallery” 1993, 58–59; Larry 1993, 54–55; “Special . . . Kombat II” 1994, EGM2, 144). A reader letter to GamePro, for instance, argued that MKI’s fatalities became boring over time, so the SNES port’s audiovisual superiority ultimately made it the better game in the long run (Fielder 1994, 12). Meanwhile, an adjacent letter asks about the strange gray object that Kano holds in his hand (a crude censoring of the extracted heart from the imported animation) when performing his finishing move on the SNES; the editors coyly reply that the reader is “reading more into the image than what’s there . . . his closed fist” (Mendez 1994, 12). Reviews thus evinced a tension between reproducing the arcade version’s in-round gameplay or its gory, end-of-match spectacles, and although most gamers tended to veer toward the gore (as confirmed by respective sales numbers), many professional reviewers hedged on the side of overall gameplay (“Special . . . Kombat II” 1994, Electronic, 118).\n\nThe recurrent criticism of trying to play Mortal Kombat with the standard controllers for each 16-bit console further highlighted the functionality of each system. Some button combinations for special moves and fatalities were slightly different on the MKII Genesis port, for instance, since both the High Punch and Low Punch controls were conflated into a single button on the standard three-button controller, and the Genesis port of MK3 in fact requires a six-button controller to accommodate the added Run button. Meanwhile, third-party developers advertised new controllers aimed at either skilled gamers (e.g., arcade pads with a joystick and six full-size buttons) or novices (e.g., Innovation’s Mortal Kombat II Kontroller, with preprogrammed special moves “sure to give entry-level players a fighting chance against seasoned veterans”) (“Walking” 1994, 62). I would go so far as to suggest that the immense popularity of fighting games during the 16-bit era influenced the number of buttons on standard controllers for the subsequent generation of consoles, since the potential loss of functionality in the translation from arcade to home ports was acutely noticeable with this particular genre.\n\nPart of the hype over MKII’s home release concerned how much gore would survive its porting, and even two months before its release, gaming Page 88 →magazines were still speculating that a blood code would be required for the Genesis port and that fatalities would be altered for the SNES version (“Special . . . Kombat II” 1994, Electronic, 118).6 But when, under the cover of a new industry-wide ratings system, Nintendo released an uncensored SNES port of MKII in September 1994, the console-superiority debate was largely settled in favor of Nintendo (Harris 2014, 518–19). Hailed as a “near-perfect translation” from the arcade version, in terms of not only audiovisual quality but also the faithful inclusion of blood and gore, the SNES earned higher review scores than the Genesis port. The latter was still acclaimed as probably the best fighting game yet released on SEGA’s console, sporting better graphics than MKI, but technical limitations still meant a reduced palette of colors and sounds (“Review . . . Kombat II” 1994, 32). And in an inadvertent twist, the Genesis port of MKII is actually less gory than the SNES port, since the Genesis’ limited memory capacity meant that its version needed to sacrifice not only some character animation but also some of the gorier sprites. In fatalities where the defeated opponent is blown apart, for instance, there are less elaborate bursts of flesh, bones, and entrails, and these sprites vanish upon hitting the ground instead of remaining where they fall, as in the arcade and SNES versions. As a passing concession to the company’s old family-friendly policy, Nintendo Power now merely noted that MKII’s “Depictions of violence may turn off some players” (“Now Playing” 1994, 110).\n\nThe Birth of the ESRB and Other Media Effects\n\nEven if Nintendo had not yet rendered SEGA a comparable pile of bones and entrails, the stakes of the console war were clearly altered by Nintendo’s belated policy shift toward allowing more mature game content. During the December 1993 hearings, senators Lieberman, Kohl, and Dorgan had been more sympathetic to Nintendo’s internal censorship policy than to SEGA’s VRC initiative, with both Joseph Lieberman and Howard Lincoln agreeing that a ratings system could encourage unscrupulous designers to incorporate even more extreme content into their games under the “fig leaf” of corporate responsibility (C-SPAN 1993). Whereas SEGA was convinced to “leave content calls up to the ‘good judgment’ of game developers” and let the VRC do the rest (“Editorial” 1993, 8), Nintendo preemptively provided third-party developers and licensees with guidelines about ten content-related “Don’ts” in order to avoid wasting their time and money creating a game that would not gain Nintendo’s approval (Kunkel 1993e, 38). But chinks in Nintendo’s Page 89 →armor became all too visible when Bill White accused Lincoln of hypocrisy for selling the Nintendo Super Scope light-gun peripheral (which Lieberman said resembled “an assault weapon of some kind”) for use with unrated SNES games, including a home port of Midway’s Terminator 2 rail-shooter. The audience burst into incredulous laughter when Lincoln, attempting to contrast the Super Scope with Lethal Enforcers’ Justifier, referred to the SNES peripheral as simply for “target shooting and whatnot” (C-SPAN 1993).\n\nFollowing the Senate hearing, SEGA, Nintendo, and other companies began drafting an industry-wide ratings system at the January 1994 CES, but animosity between different companies and industry sectors delayed the process. Because of their tight competition, Nintendo did not want to adopt the existing VRC ratings developed by rival SEGA and initially walked away from the table. The Software Publishers Association also split from the console-based companies over disagreements about how to rate desktop computer games. As a compromise, the industry’s emergent lobbying group, the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA; renamed the Entertainment Software Association in 2003), announced a new age-based ratings system to be administered by the Electronic Software Rating Board (ESRB). Game designers were now required to submit video, storyboards, or scripts containing a game’s most objectionable content, plus a questionnaire asking developers to identify any content falling into potentially problematic categories, which would form the basis of the assigned rating (“Ratings” 1994; Leeds 1994; Kent 2001, 479–80; Harris 2014, 502).7 The need for an industry-wide system was made more acute by Panasonic’s creation of its own in-house rating system for its 3DO console, to say nothing of the rating systems concurrently being developed in Canada, Australia, and Europe—all major markets for SEGA, Nintendo, and other industry leaders (“Editorial” 1994, 8).8\n\nIn a follow-up Senate hearing on March 4, 1994, Jack Heistand, senior vice president of marketing at major game developer Electronic Arts, spoke on behalf of what would soon become the IDSA, updating the senators on the industry’s rapid progress in responding to their one-year timetable. According to Lieberman and Kohl, it was important that neither SEGA nor Nintendo should head the new ratings system out of potential conflicts of interest, whereas a coalition of independent game developers and informed citizens would be more impartial. Due to its steady sales numbers, Lieberman continued to single out MKI as a game that should be re-rated according to the new classifications (C-SPAN 1994). In fact, while the home port of MKI had moved SEGA to preemptivelyPage 91 → launch the VRC, Lieberman admitted that the announced September 1994 home release of MKII specifically motivated the timetable for the new industry-wide mandate (Harrington 1994).\n\nUnlike the December hearing, representatives from major retailers Toys “R” Us, Walmart, and Babbage’s were present at the March hearing to testify that they would not carry unrated games and would enforce age restrictions at point of sale, much as major movie theater chains seldom release unrated films or circumvent the MPAA’s recommendations for underage ticket buyers (C-SPAN 1994). Satisfied that commitments from these other points in the distribution chain would increase the proposed rating system’s efficacy, Congress endorsed the IDSA’s proposal in July 1994 and the ESRB went into full effect that September. Again, it was no coincidence that the ESRB and MKII’s home ports premiered the same month; the Genesis port of MKII, in fact, would be one of the few (and final) SEGA games awarded an MA-17 rating (fig. 16) by the newly defunct VRC. Yet, even after the ESRB took effect, SEGA briefly introduced a new “mature-oriented label, Deep Water,” whose logo of an ominously circling shark would appear on select SEGA products in addition to the ESRB’s M rating. The SEGA CD fighting game Eternal Champions: Challenge from the Dark Side, which features many elaborate fatalities (including “Cinekills,” or fatalities rendered as animated FMV cut-scenes), would be the first title with that short-lived designation (“Press Start” 1995, 50).\n\nAlthough the ESRB’s establishment would temporarily sate threats of government intervention, debates about Mortal Kombat remained alive in the pages of psychology and social science journals, with the series’ violence seemingly ready-made for use in media-effects studies—and thus setting up serious potential for confirmation bias. Wading through the voluminous media-effects research about video game violence is beyond the scope of this chapter,9 but I suggest that Mortal Kombat’s prominence in such research is due less to its inherent degree of violence than the preceding controversy and the games’ unintended utility for conducting such studies in the first place. Despite how the blood code in SEGA’s MKI port was intended to assuage parental concerns, the fact that the same game could be played with or without blood and gore ironically meant that these two modes could be used as experimental variables (Ballard and Wiest 1996; also see Kirsh 1998). Christopher Ferguson and John Kilburn (2010, 175) also suggest that the politicization of video game violence led to publication bias among social science journals toward printing studies that confirmed existing suspicions.\n\nPage 92 →Among critics of such research, one recurring concern is ambiguity over what sort of gameplay constitutes “violence” in the first place, with everything from Mortal Kombat and DOOM (id Software [U.S.], 1993) to Pac-Man (Namco, 1980) and Missile Command (Atari, 1980) having been deemed “violent” games in media-effects studies. This inconsistency means that “violent” content can become so broadly defined as to signify everything and nothing (Schott 2016, 21, 48; Markey and Ferguson 2017, 52–53, 76). Take, for instance, Eugene Provenzo’s surety at the December 1993 hearings that research on television violence could be logically extended to video games (C-SPAN 1993), even as his own published work (Provenzo 1991, 89) on video game violence’s potential effect on children is far more ambivalent. Compared to the variety of 8-bit NES games cited in his prior study, the more graphic violence of MKI and Night Trap had seemingly tipped his hand, even as the promise of high-profile television coverage perhaps produced its own “media effects” on his subsequent testimony. Regardless, so many past crisis moments have demonstrated how alarmism of the “Think of the children!” variety tends toward supplanting scientific rigor with emotional urgency, as was also the case here.\n\nAnother major problem with media-effects studies is the use of clinical or laboratory settings and protocols that bear little resemblance to actual gameplay contexts. At the risk of sounding flippant, it is not difficult to see how asking children, adolescents, or college students to play video games under the watchful eye of a psychologist—perhaps while hooked up to biometric sensors or with exit surveys looming—would potentially increase players’ “aggressive” thoughts! Measured “aggression” is, in fact, often mistakenly attributed to test subjects’ frustration over the artificiality of experimental protocols, such as being asked to play a game with which one is not already familiar and therefore not particularly skilled (Markey and Ferguson 2017, 66). Likewise, Gareth Schott (2016, 175–76) observes that the forward momentum built into game objectives, such as overcoming progressively difficult obstacles (e.g., AI-controlled opponents), is often mistaken for non-ludic, real-world aggression, despite the fact that the former is positively adaptive to the ludic system while the latter entails a maladaptive breaching of social norms. These biased interpretations help account for why, depending on the individual study, increased sensitization to violence (i.e., hostility) and desensitization to violence (i.e., lack of empathy) have both been observed—a paradox that had nevertheless left moral reformers with the impression that video game violence could only be harmful either way.\n\nPage 93 →As Amanda Phillips (2018, 138) argues, video games frequently combine whimsical ludic goals with images of death and dying, therefore creating a “mechropolitical” tension between “honoring the seriousness of death and the impulsion to play with and become its master.” Although some games thus invite the player and game to work in tandem to make death “fun,” even nonviolent games motivate players by providing opportunities for demonstrating their competence, autonomy, and other skills. Using Mortal Kombat as one such example, Andrew Przybylski, Richard Ryan, and C. Scott Rigby (2009) describe how the affects that are often mistaken for “aggression” actually reflect a given player’s desire for success within a prescribed ludic context, such as successfully defeating opponents, performing fatalities, or other goals that have no real-world value outside the intrinsic value of gameplay for its own sake. They go so far as to suggest that even as violent content can provide a slightly greater sense of immersion during the heat of gameplay, the presence of violent content does not correlate with one’s overall enjoyment of a given game and can, in fact, detract from one’s enjoyment if such violence outweighs the quality of underlying gameplay.10 Here we find echoes of the aforementioned critical debates about whether Mortal Kombat’s intrinsic gameplay outweighed the sheer spectacle of gore, but I suggest that the failure of so many Mortal Kombat clones (described in the following chapter) demonstrates how merely upping the ante on extreme violence failed to compensate players for the frustrations of inferior game design.\n\nEven with a player’s defeat, however, we can still find potential complications to media-effects arguments, since Rachael Hutchinson (2007, 295–96) observes that the fighting-game convention of returning to the Character Select screen after a loss works against long-term immersion. The repeated return to oneself as the pre-match, extradiegetic entity responsible for avatar selection creates a sense of aesthetic distance that may certainly run afoul of the latter-day games-as-art discourse by breaking the sensation of deep play. Yet this blatant interruption of in-match intensity also pushes back on claims about the supposedly imitative effects of video game violence, because such aesthetic distance repeatedly breaks the player’s transitory linkage with their violent avatar (also see Wenz 2014, 316).\n\nNevertheless, Mortal Kombat’s publicly controversial status had made the series’ increasing numbers of fans into alternate figures of anxiety and mockery. For every “Mortal Monday” television commercial featuring a chanting army of (pre)teens spontaneously assembling in the Page 94 →streets, there were tongue-in-cheek jokes like the May 1994 letter to Electronic Gaming Monthly that reproduces many stereotypes about deranged media fandom:\n\nWhen the arcade closes and I go home, my mom says I should “fatality” myself because I’m failing in high school. Ha! She doesn’t even know that I quit high school so that I could play Mortal Kombat more! I weigh 55 pounds and my Mortal Kombat buddies say I should eat more but I don’t have enough money because I spend it all on Mortal Kombat. I figured out this new fatality with Scorpion where he rips out your eyeballs and eats them, shoves his hand up your nose, and pulls out your brain. I have decided that when I’m older, I want to be a policeman so I can do that to people. (Chernicky 1994, 16)\n\nIn a more popular vein, a December 1995 episode of The Simpsons (Moore 1995) depicts Bart, America’s favorite preteen delinquent, caught shoplifting a cartridge of “Bonestorm”—an ultraviolent fighting game whose hulking, six-armed combatants and constant rain of blood and severed hands are obvious nods to Mortal Kombat (to say nothing of its titular allusion to the Mortal Kombat imitator BloodStorm [Incredible Technologies, 1994])—after his mother, Marge, deems it too violent to purchase for him. Playing upon older fears about arcades and video game addiction as supposed causes of petty crime, the episode crystallizes a lineage of anxieties about the corrupting influence of games with seemingly little to offer but extreme gore.\n\nUltimately, however, fighting games like Mortal Kombat would soon be displaced in the national conversation by the rise of FPS games—one of the most notorious of which, id Software’s DOOM, was released the very day after the December 1993 Senate hearings. In the immediate wake of the 1999 Columbine massacre and other school shootings, earlier concerns about rail-shooters like Lethal Enforcers shifted to FPS, whose 3D capacities and fully controllable avatars made them more easily scapegoated as “killing simulators” during a revived series of Senate hearings about video game violence. With video games again an easier political target than the underlying issues of unrestricted gun access and toxic masculinity, high-profile mass shootings obscured the underlying fact that, since 1992, violent crime in the United States has dropped by 42 percent while video game sales have increased 267 percent. According to Patrick Markey and Christopher Ferguson (2017, 99), this decline in real-world violence is less likely due to violent games providing already-violent people with a cathartic release of aggression and more likely Page 95 →attributable to increased video game usage keeping more young people preoccupied and out of trouble in the first place.\n\nAlthough such debates would continue, reframed around more recent “sandbox”-style action titles by U.S.-based studio Rockstar Games (e.g., the Grand Theft Auto [1997–] series) and others, the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association (2011) finally extended First Amendment protection to video games.11 Unlike the 1982 City of Mesquite v. Aladdin’s Castle ruling, this case focused less on youth access to games than on establishing the underlying game content as a form of protected speech. With the ESRB firmly in place as the industry’s voluntary (but de facto required) classification board, even extreme violence would no longer necessarily trigger government intervention. The very cinematic qualities that had made Mortal Kombat, Night Trap, and other video games so controversial in the early 1990s now had a ratings system and legal protection akin to that of cinema itself. And yet, even as a plethora of imitator games attempted to challenge Mortal Kombat’s crown with even more exaggerated violence and appeals to bad taste, the Mortal Kombat franchise itself went in increasingly transmedial directions that were tame enough not to run afoul of the very standards it had previously flouted—as we shall see in the final chapter."
