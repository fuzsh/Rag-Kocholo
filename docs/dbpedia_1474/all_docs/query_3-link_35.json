        "text": "of King of the Monsters II.\n\nSuper Geon is Godzilla, if Godzilla slimmed down, grew more spikes and started working out. He can beat you down with his tail, break your back on his shoulders or pull out his own horn to use as a sword or javelin. This is the guy we should call the next time King Ghidorah shows up.\n\nof the Tekken and SoulCalibur series.\n\nMany men have worn the mantle of Yoshimitsu and wielded the sword of the same name through these two series, but they all manage to hold the same mixture of poise and manic insanity. For all his skill in swordsmanship, he might decide at any moment to chuck the rules and physics out the window and start using his sword as a helicopter or pogo stick.\n\nof the Bloody Roar series.\n\nBakuryu is a ninja who can adopt man/animal hybrid form called a Zoanthrope. His particular animal to draw on is the mole. This isn't particularly impressive sounding until you see him in action. His newfound massive claws and burrowing ability added to his ninja talents make him a highly mobile force to be reckoned with that can cut you down in a hurry.\n\nof the Street Fighter series.\n\nZangief is not an easy character to learn, and I certainly haven't, but that doesn't diminish how badly this Russian freight train can mangle you if the player knows his business. This is a man who wrestles bears as a hobby and when he is crushing your skull like sparrows egg between his thighs, you will wonder why you were ever foolish enough to step up to him.\n\nof Injustice: Gods Among Us.\n\nThe main man Lobo rides into battle on his space hog strapped for war. With stogie in mouth, hook-chain and sawed-off in hands, and complete lack of respect for his opponent in place, he is ready for anything. A good thing to be in a world of superheroes gone mad.\n\nof the Mortal Kombat series.\n\nDrahmin was once a mortal man, but after his death and rebirth in the netherrealm he has become an oni, a demon. The more cunning partner of the Oni Destroyer Moloch, Drahmin has a metal club in place of one hand, and a constant cloud of rotflies surrounding him feeding on his rotten flesh. Drahmin is a gruesome opponent unafraid to bludgeon you into pulp and eat the remains. Respect.\n\nof Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.\n\nThe Sorcerer Supreme of Earth doesn't need to sully his fists on your face, because he has a spell for every purpose. Prepare to learn those spells yourself though, because he's going to be shouting them aloud at every opportunity. FLAMES OF THE FALTINE, DAGGERS OF DENAK, DAGGERS OF DENAK, EYE OF AGAMOTTOOOOO!\n\nof the Tekken series, Soulcalibur II and Playstation All-Stars.\n\nThe infamous head of the Mishima Zaibatsu, Heihachi struts into every situation with his customary swagger and contempt for others. He's stronger than men a quarter his age, and has seemingly unlocked the secret of eternal youth to boot. His family tree is more than a little twisted, but not for lack of his trying to prune it. He also has a bear for a best friend. Not a bad resume.\n\nof the Bloody Roar series.\n\nStun was once a normal mad scientist, but a betrayal by his partner left him as an unstable insectoid Zoanthrope. This instability requires him to drink blood regularly to survive, leaving him a cursed man. Setting this unfortunate business aside, Stun is a badass bugman who will beat you down, jack you with his horn and stomp your face in.\n\nof the Soulcalibur series.\n\nI like axes, particularly large ones. I also like bad guys. Never have the two been married so well as in the mighty Astaroth. A golem built by a dangerous cult, he has long since outgrown his creators, mostly by murdering them. He now wanders the earth indulging his cruelty, searching for Soul Edge and occasionally playing enforcer for more organized villains. He's living the dream, and it's inspiring.\n\nof Marvel vs. Capcom 3.\n\nEver wonder who teaches the innumerable henchmen in comic books their rudimentary to decent combat skills? It's this guy. I'm pretty sure he teaches the goons in video games and action movies too. Anyway, Taskmaster is blessed with what he calls \"Photographic Reflexes\". This means he can perfectly emulate any action he observes. Through vigorous study of some of the greatest in the world, he has swiftly grown to stand among them.\n\nof the Tekken series.\n\nSteve Fox is a boxer, which happens to be one of my favorite martial styles in fighting games. He makes boxing fun by bringing tons of positioning and spacing tricks, and more importantly, tons of knockout PUNCH. I like his name too.\n\nof the Street Fighter series.\n\nEdmond Honda is more than happy to remind you that a fat man can whip your ass, my ass, and every ass around. He came to the World Warrior tournament to prove Sumo is as strong as anything else, and he proved it by planting a hundred hand slaps in the opppositions faces.\n\nof Deadliest Warrior: Legends.\n\nWhether you're talking about her historically or in her various video game appearances, the Maid of Orleans is a force to be reckoned with. In DW she's as likely to put you down with a crossbow bolt to the face as she is to send your head tumbling from your shoulders with her blade. Vive la France!\n\nof many, many Dragonball Z games.\n\nVegeta is an asshole. Good guy? Bad guy? An asshole either way. He may perpetually be second banana to the golden boy Goku, but he's far more exciting and dynamic. His power is nothing to sneeze at either, with more than enough to blow up a few dozen planets and still fly home for lunch.\n\nof the Soulcalibur series.\n\nMitsurugi is a master swordsman who initially quested for Soul Edge to gain a weapon that could defeat the mighty Rifle. He never got it, but he figured out a way cut gunmen down without cursed uber weapons. Now he wanders the world looking for a foe who can challenge him. He hasn't been too successful, as his swordsmanship is unparalleled.\n\nof the Street Fighter series.\n\nThe brother of Ken and Ryu's master Gouken, Akuma wields the dark side of the Force, I mean the Satsui no Hadou. He spends his time searching for a challenge (fruitlessly usually) and occasionally tempting his adoptive nephew Ryu to join the dark side. Darth Akuma fears nothing, and serves no one.\n\nof Marvel vs. Capcom 3.\n\nMayor Haggar is an honest politician during the day, a ruthless pounder of gang members at night, and a suplexer of sharks at all times. I don't know that there's much more to say.\n\nof the Soulcalibur series.\n\nOnce the chosen of Hephaestus, Aeon was transformed into a Lizardman by the same cult that made Astaroth. Since that traumatic event Aeon has struggled both with trying to keep some of his humanity and his sense of good and evil. That aside, he's a badass lizardman with one or more axes who battles the best warriors the world can offer.\n\nof Injustice: Gods Among Us.\n\nBorn on a Monday.\n\nChristened on Tuesday.\n\nMarried on Wednesday.\n\nTook ill on Thursday.\n\nGrew Worse on Friday.\n\nDied on Saturday.\n\nBuried on Sunday. But that's not the end of Solomon Grundy.\n\nNothing is ever the end of Solomon Grundy, the immortal zombie who clashes with the Justice League on the regular. Props to him for being the first character I ever figured out a chain grab with as well.\n\nof Marvel vs. Capcom 3.\n\nWeskers image may have been damaged somewhat since his days of being a universally feared super villain in a world that didn't have super villains. Global Saturation and \"cheapness\" in MvC aside, Wesker is still pretty damn cool. I'm still gonna play him.\n\nof the Guilty Gear series.\n\nA time-displaced dude from our time, he battles the increasingly odd warriors of the distant future. He wields a kusari-gama that is exactly the length it needs to be, and endeavors to find a way back to the present. Well, his present. You know what I mean.\n\nof the Mortal Kombat series.\n\nThe original secret character of a series famed for secret characters, Reptile is the legendary green ninja. Acid spit, a hunger for flesh, crazy force ball things, invisibility and great martial skill all lie within his bag of tricks. He's slowly eschewed the trappings of his former human disguise as the games have gone on, only making him cooler.\n\nof the Guilty Gear series.\n\nAlso known as the Dr. Baldhead, Faust is a batshit insane former serial killer who does his best to redeem himself for his terrible actions. His methods of attack are just as mad as he is, whether he's using his giant scalpel as a pogo stick, popping out of dimensional doorways, diving with a massive needle, or dressing up as a little boy with a baseball bat. Pure deadly madness to be sure, but he's almost certain to heal you after he's done beating you.\n\nof Persona 4 Arena.\n\nNaoto has a fighting style specifically designed to screw with you. Traps, gunfire, quick jabs, and her persona Sakuna-Hikona's invisible attacks all conspire to whittle you down. And if whittling doesn't work, she has instant death traps. This detective knows how to bring down any foe.\n\nof Soulcalibur II and the Smash Bros. series.\n\nThe legendary boy in green is the posterchild for overpreparation. He comes to battle with sword, shield, bow, boomerang, magic, bombs, hookshot, and anything else he can find in a dusty ruin. Battling the greatest fighters of other worlds is just another adventure to him. And Link is the master of adventure.\n\nof Injustice: Gods Among Us.\n\nMy favorite member of the Bat Family, Barbara Gordon is Batgirl. An invaluable asset to Batman at most times, in Injustice Barbara is free to step to center stage to save the world from the mad heroes who oppress it. She's also free to pummel the Joker all day every day, which is pretty satisfying when you know their history. Fast, tricky, tough and dangerous at all ranges, Batgirl is no joke.\n\nof the Mortal Kombat series.\n\nKano is the wiliest, most treacherous, murderous knife enthusiast in Earthrealm or Outworld. If he can't stab you, he'll strangle you, if he can't do that he'll burn you with eye lasers, if that doesn't work he'll rip your heart out with his bare hands. If all else fails, he'll tear your skeleton out wholesale. Kano is consistently the wild card within the Mortal Kombat tournaments. A criminal arms dealer, a professional traitor, and a deadly killer, Kano is no one to toy with.\n\nof Persona 4 Arena.\n\nEveryone's favorite slightly dim chair-wielder comes into this list just shy of the top ten. He and his persona Take-Mikazuchi enter the fray with brash power and wild, bombastic attacks. Dropkicks, chair shots and lightning bolts abound when Kanji is around. He and his pal also share the best instant finish in the game with the Ultimate Brofist attack. Only Kanji could stumble into a tournament his friends have been dragged into and assume it's just a dream.\n\nof the Smash Bros. series.\n\nGanondorf is a man who has a lesson to teach us. When you get knocked down, when you get shot in the face with a light arrow, when a small child impales a blade into your head, you get back up. You get back on the horse, practice your dark magic, and find a pit to kick someone into. This is a lesson we can all take something from.\n\nof the Guilty Gear series.\n\nZappa isn't actually a very good fighter, or an aggressive man. The small army of ghosts that use him as a frat house are pretty violent though! There's somewhere between 5 and 30 ghosts hanging out inside the poor fellow, and they tend to take the steering wheel whenever someone who'll put up a decent fight is around. \"Zappa's\" fighting style is insane, riddled with supernatural effects and impossible body movements, making him a deeply unpredictable opponent. Zappa himself is only vaguely aware that something is wrong, mostly because he wakes up surrounded by unconscious bodies and covered in wounds. So he quests across the land searching for a doctor. Good luck Zappa.\n\nof the Street Fighter series.\n\nThe ultimate boxer in the fighting game universe, Balrog can and will punch anyone in the face. Doesn't matter who, doesn't matter where, he'll punch them. His punches are brutal, his footwork is good, and he keeps the boxing gloves on whether it's a street fight or not. That's class.\n\nof the Soulcalibur series.\n\nVoldo is a strange man. He is the guardian of his dead Master Vercci's dungeon-like vault. Every now and then he strikes out in search of Soul Edge to bring home to the ghost of his beloved master. Or maybe there is no ghost and he's completely mad. Or maybe he's completely mad either way. What is true is that Voldo has a unique, somewhat disturbing appearance and fighting style, a pair of razor sharp katars, and impressive battle awareness considering his eyes are always covered. Voldo is also the greatest senior citizen on this list that doesn't cheat with magic, clocking in at 67 years old. Judging by his prowess and um.... assets, age ain't nothin' but a number here.\n\nof the Mortal Kombat series.\n\nKano is a vicious criminal. Drahmin is a man-eating demon. Reptile is a lizard ninja of a dead race. Stryker shoots them all in the face and then goes back to work doing the real tough stuff, enforcing the law on the mean streets of NYC. He has no magic powers, no weapons of the gods, no infernal or celestial patron, no technology more advanced than what you can find in your local police station. But he beats people that have those advantages and more with a simple and effective style, and the tools of his trade. Stryker is the greatest Kombatant.\n\nof Persona 4 Arena.\n\nAha! Is this our champ? Not quite. Chie is the only person on this list who has proven capable of kicking tanks into low orbit, that's awesome. Chie is an upbeat martial arts fan with a good heart and a drive to protect the ones she loves. She and her persona Tomoe are fast hard-hitters, if not above being distracted by a nice steak bowl.\n\nVinny and Jeff approved ass-kicker.\n\nof Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: The Fighting Edition.\n\nNUMBER ONE, NUMBER ONE, NUMBER ONE\n\nIvan Ooze is the cheapest, bustedest fighting game character you can play as outside of Mugen. Combine his fighting prowess with the fantastic masterpiece of cinema he debuted in, and you have all that and a dumptruck of chips. This makes him rather obviously the best character ever as well. Alright, nah I'm just screwing with you. Ivan doesn't belong on this list, let's move onto the real King.\n\nof the Guilty Gear series.\n\nSlayer is who I would want to be if I was a fighting game character. Pure and simple. He has a fast, hard hitting combat style of his own creation, a punch that could flip a tank, an entire Assassin's Guild at his command, more class than you can fit in an oil tanker, an immortal, unkillable girlfriend, and a fine beard. He's also an ageless, hellishly strong vampire. He wins the battle just by getting up in the evening. Hail to the King."
