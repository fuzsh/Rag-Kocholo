        "text": "Late to the party here, but I would be super interested in a roleplaying focused game in the Mortal Kombat setting. The setting and characters are crazy, and I think it'd be super interesting if the playerbase held up, which is always the problem.\n\nA lot of people get hung up on the 'death' aspect since it's so integral to the video games, but... storywise characters hardly ever die. Obviously 'kombat' would still be a common thing, but... no more so than most superhero games, I would imagine, with the same result of characters usually being driven off or knocked out.\n\nI'm more interested in the stories and character relationships than anything. Making creative use of the setting and locations. Brutal fights, of course, are A+, but we wouldn't need to get hung up on systems or death, necessarily.\n\nUnless it were OCs-only, and the theme was that you could make as many as you want, but the game's a meat grinder that could kill them at any moment. That could be kind of interesting, but... I really just want to play Mileena or Sonya. <__<\n\nI really wish I knew how to make games, I'd totally work on this and another theme. Heck, I wish there was a way to just tool around with your own grid offline without having to buy server space, but it doesn't seem like it.\n\n@Ghost Like I said, death isn't even that necessary and probably wouldn't be that common. It's the gimmick of the games, but the in-game world only has occasional deaths that are almost never permanent. Heck, two of the main bad guys can just bring their henchmen straight back to life.\n\nDepends a little on whether fights are enforced by a system, or just roleplayed out, I guess, but on a consent based game, most fights will probably end without a character permanently dying.\n\nEDIT: Only occasional MAJOR CHARACTER deaths, I should say; nameless henchmen, bystanders, and members of warrior clans die gruesomely all the time.\n\nMK11 spoilers.\n\nStarting to wonder about specifics. Like, whether it should be set up more or less exactly where MK1 or 2 started, or if it should have the theme of the New Era that ended up being created at the end of MK11, in which case Shinnok might never have existed and the Netherrealm might be ruled by somebody else. That might also mean that at least Liu Kang and Raiden might not be around anymore either\n\nNo matter what, I'd be tempted to just toss the Chaos and Order Realms; though I'd hate to lose Havik."
