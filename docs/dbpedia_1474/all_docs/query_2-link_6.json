        "text": "Procedure\n\nParticipants were told that investigators were testing cognitive abilities in order to develop a new video game that would be distributed in the near future. After providing basic demographic information (age, nationality, gender), participants were randomly assigned to play a violent-sexist video game (i.e., GTA San Andreas or GTA Vice City; both rated 18+ for violent and sexual content), a violent-only video game (i.e., Half Life 1 or Half Life 2; both rated 16+ for violent action, but no sexual content or violence toward women), or a non-violent video game (i.e., Dream Pinball 3D or Q.U.B.E. 2; both rated 10+ with no violent or sexual content).\n\nHalf-Life is a first-person shooter video game where the player has the same visual perspective as the character. In both games used in this study (Half Life 1, Half Life 2), players fight in a post-apocalyptic future. Although there is a female co-protagonist (Alyx), she is portrayed in a non-sexual manner. In contrast, all female characters in GTA are portrayed in a sexual manner. By selecting video games that use different representation of women, it is possible to differentiate between sexual violence exposure (i.e., GTA) and exposure to violent games not involving sexism exposure (i.e., Half Life).\n\nDream Pinball 3D is a classic pinball simulation game featuring different tables to play on, while Q.U.B.E. 2 is a first-person puzzler in which the player has to solve an array of physics-based challenges.\n\nFor all the three video game conditions, participants first watched the introductory video of the game for about one minute, in order to familiarize themselves with the game. Next, they practiced by playing a preselected scene for 5 minutes. During the practice session, participants were taught how to control their character and how to interact with the game world. When the practice session ended, participants played the game alone for 25 minutes\n\nFor all the three games, participants were asked to pursue a specific goal or mission. We attempted to keep the mission as similar as possible for the violent-sexist and the violent-only games. For violent-sexist games (both GTA San Andreas and GTA Vice City), the mission was to destroy a rival criminal gang. Both missions started in a private-club, and then move through the streets of the city. During the gameplay, players were frequently exposed to female prostitutes and lap dancers; indeed, those are common elements in all the episodes of the GTA saga. For the violent-only games (both Half Life 1 and Half Life 2), players were asked to complete a mission whose goal was to destroy a group of enemies. The game’s action in both Half life 1 and Half life 2, takes place in a suburban area of the city, and then moves to a few abandoned buildings. For the neutral control games (both Dream Pinball 3D and Q.U.B.E. 2), the mission was simply to accumulate as many points as possible.\n\nAll games in all conditions were played at an intermediate level to avoid boredom (from the game being too easy) and frustration (from the game being too difficult).\n\nAfter gameplay, participants completed some video game manipulation checks. They were first asked to report the title of the video game they played, rated how violent, involving, and exciting they thought the game was (1 = not at all to 7 = extremely), and rated how sexualized the female figures in the game were (1 = not at all to 7 = extremely). Given the popularity of the GTA series among young people, we also measured how frequently they played the video game they were randomly assigned to play in this experiment (0 = never played before to 7 = every day).\n\nOne moderator was participant gender. As a possible second moderator, we measured how much participants identified with their video game character using the 6-item (e.g., “When I am playing, it feels as if I am my character” and “My character is an extension of myself”; 1 = completely disagree to 7 = completely agree) of the Player Identification Scale [26] (Cronbach α = .92).\n\nAs a possible mediator, we measured masculine beliefs. We used 12 items (e.g., “Boys should be encouraged to find a means of demonstrating physical prowess” and “It is OK for a guy to use any and all means to ‘convince’ a girl to have sex”; 1 = completely disagree to 7 = completely agree) from the revised Male Role Norms Inventory (MRNI-R; Cronbach α = .78) [27] Levant, Rankin, Williams, Hasan, & Smalley, 2010).\n\nThe dependent variable was how much empathy participants felt toward female violence victims. When people become desensitized to violence, they become numb to the pain and suffering of violence victims [28]. Participants were shown one of two photos (randomly determined) of an adolescent girl who had been physically beaten by an adolescent boy (see Figure A and Figure B in S1 Appendix). Participants rated whether they felt sympathetic, moved, compassionate, tender, warm, softhearted, disregarded (reverse-coded) and indifferent (reverse-coded) (see [29]) for her (1 = not at all to 7 = very much; Cronbach α = .83).\n\nAbout 2 weeks later, following the completion of the study, all participants were fully debriefed. No participants expressed suspicion about the true purpose of the study. In particular, none of the participants reported a link between video games and gender-based violence or sexism. The experimenter then disclosed the purpose of the study, and discussed the potentially harmful short-terms effects of violent and sexist video games on players. A group discussion followed.\n\nPrimary Results\n\nSince playing violent video games that are not necessarily sexist have been already shown to reduce feelings of empathy, we contrast coded the type of video game as follow: +1 = violent-sexist games, 0 = violent-only games, -1 = non-violent games. Data analysis revealed that the type of video game was positively associated with masculine beliefs (r = .203, p = .011). Participant gender (1 = male vs. 0 = female) was associated with both masculine beliefs (r = .507, p < .001) and identification with the game character (r = .241, p = .003). Mean comparison revealed that participant gender impacted the masculine beliefs such that male participants showed greater endorsement of masculine beliefs (M = 3.23, SD = 0.82) than female did (M = 2.44, SD = 0.52; t(152) = 7.25; p < .001; d = 1.15). Participant gender also influenced the identification with the game character such that boys identified more with the game character (M = 4.63, SD = 1.20) than girls (M = 3.96, SD = 1.45; t(152) = 3.05; p = .003; d = 0.50). Further, the level of identification with the game character was positively associated with masculine beliefs (r = .197, p = .014). Finally, masculine beliefs were negatively associated with empathy for female violence victims (r = -.348, p < .001; see ).\n\nTable 1\n\n123456781. Type of video game12. Masculine beliefs.203*13.

The first ANOVA found a significant effect for type of video game played on identification with the game character, F(2,152) = 6.06, p = .003, η2 = .073. Post-hoc comparisons using Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test indicated that participants who played a violent game identified with the character more than did participants who played a neutral game (d = 0.62, p = .003) or a violent-sexist game (d = 0.57, p = .04). No differences were found between the neutral and the violent-sexist games (p = .67).\n\nThe second ANOVA found a significant effect for type of video game played on masculine beliefs F(2,152) = 3.33, p = .038, η2 = .004. Post-hoc tests indicated that participants who played a violent-sexist game reported higher masculine beliefs than did participants who played a neutral game (d = 0.50, p = .03). No statistically differences were found between violent-sexist games and violent-only games (p = .24) or between violent-only and neutral games (p = .57) on masculine beliefs.\n\nThe third ANOVA found no significant effect for type of video game played on empathy for female violence victims (p = .31). Descriptive statistics by experimental conditions for each dependent variable are reported in .\n\nTable 2\n\nNeutral game (males n = 21; females n = 29)Violent-only game (males n = 25; females n = 30)Violent-sexist game (males n = 22; females n = 26)Identification with the game character3.89 (1.57)b4.76 (1.21)a4.12 (1.18)bMasculine beliefs2.62 (0.72)b2.77 (0.73)b3.02 (0.86)aEmpathy for female violence victims5.03 (0.95)a5.29 (0.92)a5.02 (1.16)a\n\nTo test our predictions, we then conducted a conditional process model by using the PROCESS macro Model 11 for SPSS with 1000 bootstrapping samples [24]. In this model, the type of video game played was entered as predictor, the identification with the game character as a moderator, masculine beliefs as the mediator, and empathy toward female violence victims as the outcome variable. We predicted that participants’ gender would moderate the effects of the identification with the game character on the relationship between the type of video game and masculinity beliefs. (see ). Participant age, video game violence rating, and frequency of video game play were also included as covariates.\n\nConsidering the moderated path from the type of video game to masculine beliefs, analyses revealed that the main effects of type of video game played, identification with the game character, participant gender, participant age, and frequency of gameplay were not significant (bs < .56, ts(140)<1.47, ps>.14), whereas the main effect of violence rating was significant (b = -.10, SE = .047, t(140) = -2.07, p = .039). The two-way interaction between type of video game played and participant gender was significant (b = -1.05, SE = .45, t(140) = -2.29, p = .023), whereas the interactions between type of video game played and identification with the game character (b = .02, SE = .065, t(140) = .32, p = .74) and between participant gender and identification with the game character (b = -.03, SE = .083, t(140) = .36, p = .71) were both nonsignificant. Crucially, all these effects were qualified by our predicted 3-way interaction between type of video game played, participant gender, and identification with the game character on masculine beliefs (b = .26, SE = .10, t(140) = 2.55, p = .011; see ).\n\nTable 3\n\nbSEpMasculine beliefsType of video game.229.273.40Participants’ gender.561.38.14Identification with the game character.063.049.20Age-.013.052.80Violence rating-.099.047.04Frequency of play.026.043.54Type of video game X Participants’ gender-1.05.457.02*Type of video game X Identification with the game character.021.065.74Participants’ gender X Identification with the game character.030.083.71Type of video game X Participants’ gender X Identification with the game character.265.103.01*Empathy for female violence victimsAge-.039.079.61Violence ratings.099.074.18Frequency of play.052.061.38Masculine beliefs-.465***.109.0001***\n\nFor male participants, simple slope analyses showed a significant positive relationship between identification with the game character and masculine beliefs for males who played with a violent-sexist game (b = .32, SE = .12, t(62) = 2.65, p = .009), but not for males who played violent-only game (b = .095, SE = .078, t(62) = 1.21, p = .23) or for males who played a nonviolent game (b = -.13, SE = .97, t(62) = -1.33, p = .18; see ). For female participants, there was no significant relationship between identification with the game character and masculine beliefs in any of the three video game conditions (bs < .082, ts(76)<1.81, ps>.075).\n\nThen, considering the path from masculine beliefs (i.e., the mediator variable) to empathy for female violence victims (i.e., the outcome variable), analyses revealed that masculine beliefs negatively impacted the dependent variable (b = -.45, SE = .11, t(146) = -4.17, p < .001).\n\nAs first support of our moderated mediational hypothesis, we found a significant indirect effect of the type of video game on empathy for female violence victims via increased masculine beliefs for males [-0.1846 (95% CI = -0.3984 to -0.0410)] but not for females [-0.0406 (95% CI = -0.1318 to 0.0097)] who played with a violent-sexist game. No effect was found for males [-0.0486 (95% CI = -0.1733 to 0.0363)] or females [-0.0294 (95% CI = -0.0799 to 0.0041)] in the violent-only game condition. Similarly, no indirect effect of type of video game on empathy was found for males [-0.0874 (95% CI = -0.0134 to 0.3363)] or females [-0.0181 (95% CI = -0.0783 to 0.286)] in the nonviolent game condition. Further, conditional indirect effects of type of video game on empathy for female violence victims were significant only for males in the violent-sexist game condition at values of identification with the game character greater than 4.2583 [-0.1920 (95% CI = -0.4668 to -0.0492] (see ). These results suggest that violent-sexist games decreased empathy for female violence victims for boys who strongly identified with the violent game character, and did so by increasing masculine beliefs."
