        "text": "Despite how utterly badass he is in the game, let's get one unfortunate fact out of the way right now. Miguel will never be a prominent character in the Tekken universe. His pitiful performance against Jin Kazama in the newest movie(leaked on youtube) is a good example. It was so lopsided it almost made me put Miguel on the Lame list. Yeah he got some decent shots in the beginning but Jin dominated most of the fight, and brutally demolished Miguel in the end. This is doubly shameful because the person playing miguel in that scene is one of the baddest MMA fighters out there(with a personal real life story that would make for a hell of a movie in it's own right). Still, in the actual game itself Miguel has a stylish look, and fighting style, and an engaging personal story of tragedy and badassery. And the creators of Tekken deserve some credit simply for doing something I never thought I would see in my lifetime. They created a hispanic character in a fighting game and he's NOT a luchador. Granted, they simply traded the luchador stereotype for the matador stereotype, but I will take progress anywhere I can find it man.\n\nI havn't played this game yet but I've seen mostly positive reviews so it's on my list. I will mostly base this entry off his comicbook portrayals. Technically Jackie Ecstacado is mostly Italian...but Jackie's earliest known ancestor Miguel Ecstacado is a full blooded spaniard. So Jackie's hispanic enough for me. It just goes to show that if you go back far enough in somebody's family tree you'll find that we all have a bit of some other race in us somewhere. Anyway, Jackie's badassery practically jumps the shark at times. I mean, what can you say about a guy who lost his virginity at the age of 14 to the police woman who was interrogating him? And right there on the interrogation desk no less. Wow. Ok. Nuff said. Actually there is one more thing worth saying. He knocked up Sara Pezzini. Respect bro. Respect.\n\nI almost put him on the lame list because despite a background story as a South American mercenary that SHOULD make him one of the most hardcore badasses in the Resident Evil franchise I seem to recall him being the only character in the series male AND female, adult and child, to nearly have an emotional breakdown during the zombie crisis. Despite that he performed respectably for the rest of the game, and his portrayal in the movies went a long way toward restoring his \"street cred\" even though they didn't even get a hispanic actor to play him. I was desperately hoping he would be the main protagonist of Resident Evil 5. Unsurprisingly I was dissapointed. I continue to hold out hope that Carlos will return as a main character in a future RE game. A good one. Not one of the remakes, or a crap addition to the franchise like that FPS-game they did a while back.\n\nHe proved himself to be a fairly badass dude in his various bossfights. He survives a protracted gun fight with Brad(A rather tough government agent), and the hero of the game Frank(A War Reporter who somehow goes on to become an unstoppable zombie-slaying machine). And he had some pretty smooth moves in his cut-scene fight with Brad. He also proves himself a skillful sniper in a later bossfight. It's a shame he gets taken out by a crazy butcher but hey, he had a good run up until then. Besides, as the villain of the story(and one pretty evil SOB, no matter how \"just\" he thought his cause was) Carlito's death was inevitable. Still, as far as villains go he was a pretty cool character all around. Like all the best villains he was just sympathetic enough that if the things he had done weren't so irredeemably evil you would almost be rooting for him.\n\nRam kicks ass. Go ahead. Put him up against ANYBODY from the Grand Theft Auto franchise and Ram won't just kill them. He'll kill them with fire. And style. And bullets. And possibly an exploding pinata. I'll never understand why his game wasn't a huge success. Apparently there was some race controversey surrounding the title when it first released, so my best guess is a bunch of pansy-ass videogame reviewers got their undies all twisted over the idea that if they admitted to enjoying a game that had them performing obscene amounts of violence against mexicans, everybody would think they were racist. The fact that the main character himself was mexican apparently never entered into the equation. Ram and his game were a victim of Political Correctness...just another reason I hate political correctness.\n\nI was initially turned off on this character because I thought he was supposed to be some glorified version of Che Guevera based on the cover art from the first game. Here's a quick history lesson for you. The real Che was a sadisticly murderous and incredibly racist sunuvabitch who spared nobody the worst of his brutality. Young or old, male or female, it made no difference to this bastard. He does not deserve to be glorified or idolized in any way, shape or form(as so many brain dead twits on college campuses and in hollywood were doing around the time this game first came out). Anyway, apparently that was just a marketing gimmick and the in-game Rico in no way resembled Che. So I gave him another look and much to my surprise it turned out this guy is one high flying hardcore super badass mofo. Now brace yourself, because the next thing I am about to say will knock your socks off...he's the MAIN character. He's the headline event. The star of the show. He's not a sidekick. He's not a secondary character. He's not the guy you play for one stage while the real hero is otherwise pre-occupied...he's the main freakin' event. Holy crap. EDIT: I have purchased and beaten JC2 and while I stand by my decision to put Rico on this list I gotta say i'm a tad dissapointed. Rico has something of a personality deficiency, unless \"Sociopath\" can be considered a personality trait. Rico's definitely an acrobatic army-killing, base-leveling Amry-Of-One. Sheer badassery earns him his place on this list, and you know you got a badass on your hands when you're talking about a guy who disarms 4 nuclear missiles in MID-AIR, while acrobaticlly flipping back and forth between them AND while shooting it out with a megalomaniacal midget. But is it too much to ask for Rico to actually have some real personality and storyline depth? The whole plot of the game pretty much amounts to \"All our problems can be solved by blowing shit up until our enemies come to us and then we blow them up too\". That's good enough for a Quentin Tarantino movie I guess, but I just crave more. Still, i'll take what I can get.\n\nSee? This is a perfect example. Hispanic characters get no respect. They won't even put a picture of Father Cortez here on Giantbomb? No respect I tellz ya, no respect. But that's fine, cuz I respect Father Cortez enough for everybody. This guy just kicks ass. He may be elderly, but that doesn't seem to slow him down in the least. He is one of the most well balanced characters in the Hunter the Reckoning series. His default crossbow weapon goes through vampires like a hot knife through butter, and they're amongst the toughest \"normal\" enemies in the games. He uses a Crusader Sword that looks like a ginormous crucifix for melee and has some sweet looking combos with it. He also rocks a rather stylish brown leather trenchcoat and has some of the best Edge powers in the series. In summary...he kicks ass.\n\nI THINK he's hispanic but havn't played the game yet so I don't know much about the character one way or the other. I am tentively placing him on this list for now until I get more information. EDIT: Ok, let's get this out of the way. From what I can tell NONE of the Farcry 2 protagonists have any kind of in-game character developement. That having been said Marty has a fairly interesting backstory. Interesting in the sense of being kinda...realistic. An overseas marriage that ends in divorce because he's always out being a mercenary in some new war. It's not particularly dazzling but it's still kind of interesting in the sense that you can beleive it pretty easily. The Farcry series seems to be trying to move away from the Sci-Fi elements of the first and get into gritty real world realism, and Marty's story does that. It's a shame that the game doesn't do anything with the individual stories of these characters. Anyway, Marty does stand out from the other Farcry 2 protagonists in one noteworthy way. He actually appears in one of the Farcry novels. I don't know if that's a claim to fame or a claim to shame, but either way it's a claim none of the others in the game get. So there ya have it.\n\nLike Miguel from Tekken, Mavado's never gonna be anybody who matters in the Mortal Kombat universe. Rest assured that if there is an animated or live action remake, Mavado will...at best...be a bit player background mook who gets mowed down with ease by the heroes. That having been said he has a pretty badass character design and in-game he performs very well. Also, he doesn't BLATANTLY conform to a single typical stereotype role for hispanic characters, although we narrowly dodged the bullet on that one. He was originally meant to be a matador in the character-design stage but the game developers ultimately scrapped that idea. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. I suppose a case can be made that he sort of conforms to the gangster stereotype being part of a illicit organization, but that's a bit of a stretch.\n\nI was kind of torn on where to put him. Cool list, or Lame list? But ultimately he IS a very fun character even if he is a bit...\"overly flamoyant\". And he's named after one of the most badass human beings(who happens to be a Spaniard) in real world history, Al Cid Campeador. Sadly Al Cid Margrace bears little to no resemblance to Al Cid Campeador, but i'll take the nod of acknowledgement Square Enix. Margrace does have one legitimate claim to cool. In the game where he's actually a playable character all of his rather silly and impractical skills make one thing abundantly clear. He is the consumate Lady's Man. And his concept art shows that he has a trio of identical triplets as his...ahem...\"personal escorts\". Good on you bro.\n\nThe game isn't even out yet, but I am trying to be optimistic. I am hoping that Angel will be a bonafide badass. Unlike the little twerp Carlos from Saints Row 2, Angel is a big bad mofo. Despite being Luchador-themed they had the good sense to omit the ridiculous mask, and he looks very physically imposing. I'm crossing my fingers on this one. C'mon Angel, don't dissapoint me! EDIT: Finally played the game. Loved it. Hulk Hogan is a lousy Voice Actor. That said I did thoroughly enjoy Angel's storyline. Even with the Luchador stuff. The over-the-top goofiness of Lucha Libre actually fits in the Saitns Row universe. Also...the dude trains by driving with tigers and lighting people on fire. But hell, he had me at \"Drives with Tigers\". That should totally be a new internet meme.\n\nAlthough Steve is a fairly minor character in the overall game he does get a surprising amount of developement and it turns out he's a pretty cool guy. Very down to earth, very normal. It's strange but in a game like Mass Effect that really makes him stand out. And they made him stand out in a good, fleshed out, likable way. I like that they managed to dodge every possible stereotype of a gay man, and they actually made me...as a heterosexual man who finds non-lesbian gay sex magnificently icky kinda want to see how his story would play out if romanced. Thank goodness for youtube. I really felt bad for him when he described how his husband died. Well done Bioware."
