        "text": "Scorpion\n\nMortal Kombat featured multiple great characters when it first arrived on ‘Mortal Monday’ waaaay back in 1993. Sub-Zero, Raiden, Johnny Cage, Liu Kang, Sonya Blade, Kano, Shang Tsung, Goro … to be fair, pretty much every one of these could have made it onto this list.\n\nHowever, Scorpion is perhaps the most well-known character from the franchise, and while some gamers may place others above him, few can deny that he is a genius creation.\n\nPlenty of factors make Scorpion such a terrific character. The spear. The fire-based special moves. The cool yellow-and-black costume. The face mask. The glowing eyes. The fatalities. The ‘get over here!’ line. The fact that he’s a ninja AND a demon.\n\nHow many other games had featured fire-breathing, skull-headed warriors before Mortal Kombat?\n\nThat’s right. He’s a one of a kind, and remains just as awesome today as he was back in ’93\n\nLink\n\nThe Legend of Zelda games are as popular today as ever, with Ocarina of Time still classed as one of the best yet. The hero of the series, of course, is Link: instantly-recognisable even to players who have never actually played one of his games, the character has been given a variety of forms as graphics have evolved.\n\nLink has been rendered as an 8-bit hero with a top-down perspective, a more realistic 3D sprite in Ocarina of Time , and then a controversially cartoonish, cel-shaded figure in The Wind Waker. He’s always fun to play as, with a nice range of skills and endless courage, and in Twilight Princess, he was able to transform into a wolf – always a great trick to make a video-game character even better.\n\nSamus\n\nWithout doubt, Samus is one of the gaming world’s most powerful female icons. The Metroid star was originally intended to be a man, until the development team at Nintendo decided to experiment and see how players would react to learning that the hero of the game they had just ploughed through was actually a woman.\n\nTheir decision paid off, and Samus has gone on to star in a multitude of games, and remains a strong, capable, bad-ass female lead who stays hidden under armour rather than sporting a skimpy outfit.\n\nRyu\n\nIt’s a testament to Capcom’s designers and developers that so many of their characters remain as well-loved by today’s gamers as by fans back in the days of the SNES. Ryu, like Chun-Li, Guile, Vega, Ken, E. Honda, Blanka, and so many others is still going strong in the series, popular enough to claim the cover-spot on the brand-new Street Fighter V.\n\nLike Chun-Li, Ryu has a distinctive look that gamers of different generations recognise immediately: the torn white keikogi; red headband and gloves; the black hair; and the fierce eyebrows. Despite starring in so many games, Ryu’s look has stayed pretty much identical, as have his moves.\n\nUnlike some Street Fighter characters, Ryu’s attacks are fairly easy to learn, making him a quality choice for newbies and veterans alike. His brutal rivalry with Sagat also gives him a little more depth, and always gives a versus match between the two an edge.\n\nSolid Snake\n\nWhile Solid Snake had appeared in two other games before Metal Gear Solid hit the PS1, this was really his introduction to millions of gamers. And what an introduction it was.\n\nFilled with more awesome moments, unique villains, and unforgettable scenes than you can shake a Stinger missile-launcher at, Metal Gear Solid spawned a huge franchise that still finds ways to innovate after nearly 20 years.\n\nSolid Snake is an amazing character to play as, thanks to: his gruff look and demeanour; his raspy voice; his huge range of survival and combat skills; and his James Bond-like ability to survive the most challenging situations.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog\n\nThis little blue hedgehog needs no introduction, but he’ll get one anyway: he first appeared in 1991, which means he’ll celebrate his 25th anniversary later this year, and was created to serve as Sega’s official mascot (as Alex Kidd wasn’t quite cool enough).\n\nNot only does he have a unique design, Sonic is also recognisable by his speed and agility. Racing through levels, performing loop-de-loops, grabbing gold rings – everyone knows the rules of his adventures, and his first games remain just as playable today as they were so many moons ago.\n\nWho can forget running through Green Hill Zone? Who can forget jumping on top of Doctor Robotnik’s egg-shaped head again and again, until his vehicle of choice begins to burn?\n\nClassic.\n\nMario\n\nOne of the biggest, most important characters ever created, in any medium, Mario has blazed a trail through the gaming industry. When he first appeared in 1981’s Donkey Kong, nobody could have known just how huge the character would go on to become – he was originally known simply as ‘Jumpman’, before being dubbed ‘Mr. Video’ and, finally, Mario.\n\nWhile he started life in side-scrolling 2D adventures, Mario has appeared in countless other types of game: racing; 3D platformers; brawlers; puzzlers, and more, all with impressive success. The character was also adapted for the big screen with the abysmal-but-watchable 1993 movie, Super Mario Bros.\n\nWhether gamers prefer to play Mario Kart with their friends or his solo outings, Mario is still going strong today, with the next game (what it is) awaited eagerly by fans.\n\nLara Croft\n\nLike Mario, Chun-Li, Ryu, and Scorpion, Lara Croft became popular enough to transition into live-action films (as well as comic books, toys, and more). However, Miss Croft is still very much at home on games consoles, with the recent Rise of the Tomb Raider continuing her rebooted adventures.\n\nLara Croft is a strong, intelligent, brave character who is always a joy to play as. While some of the games she appeared in over the years may not have been as good as others, she has remained hugely popular (due in no small part to her look, which has become less sexualised over the years). Like a female Indiana Jones, Lara is just as comfortable scaling walls or swimming through dark underwater caves as she is fighting the bad guys – the perfect person to send on wild quests for ancient treasure.\n\nIn 2013, Crystal Dynamics’ Tomb Raider rebooted the franchise, and followed a younger Lara through her first adventure. The game was widely-praised not just for its gameplay, but for giving the heroine more depth than ever before.\n\nWhich video game characters have we missed? Which are your favourites? Let us know!"
