        "text": "Well, how about that reveal, am I right? Anyway, I thought it would be good to start a thread sharing and showcasing the characters that have been confirmed so far. There are quite a few characters that were not playable during the event, but that were either proven or highly suggested to be playable in trailers or other areas of the event.\n\nScorpion, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Baraka, Sonya, Skarlet, and newcomer Geras were all playable and therefore confirmed.\n\nCharacters not playable in event but confirmed:\n\nLiu Kang: He can be seen in-gameplay during the first gameplay trailer. Here he is sporting an outfit very similar to his MKX revenant outfit. One clip shows that his revenant form now has skull-shaped fireballs, To me this shows that his revenant form has become more in-tune with the NetherRealm:\n\nWe also see a human, and very young looking version of Liu Kang alongside Kung Lao, obviously from the past timeline. Although he is never shown in gameplay, I would be surprised if this isn't a skin for him. It also seems like the past version of Liu Kang will have a role in story mode, including a direct confrontation with Kronika, who seems to have the upper hand on him. His outfit here looks like a variation on his MK3 leggings paired with a kind-of weird looking vest: and speaking of Kung Lao...\n\nKung Lao: We see a young, and very well-designed version of Kung Lao alongside Liu Kang. This version of Kung Lao has a totally new looking outfit, with a little bit of asymmetry, a cowl or headpiece underneath his hat, and a Mortal Kombat logo medal on his belt. Could this version of Liu Kang and Kung Lao come from a completely different timeline where Kung Lao is actually the MK champion? Or maybe Kung Lao just loves wearing that MK merch:\n\nThe BTS video also has clips of the young Shaolin Monks fighting their corrupted future selves, with Liu Kang seemingly having the upper hand over his, and Kung Lao saying he is sickened at the thought of becoming that. I think it's pretty cool to see Liu Kang and Kung Lao as pure-hearted good guys again. I just hope that this version of the pair have happy endings this time around.\n\nKronika: So I guess the leaks were true about the names of these characters. In the Behind the Scenes trailer, Kronika is confirmed to be the boss of this game, to have power over time, and an overseer of all of the events since MK1. She also seeks a perfect balance between good and evil, and descends when evil is \"irrevocably\" defeated with Shinnok at the end of MKX. According to the BTS video, her plot is to reset the timeline to the beginning and \"fold\" the timelines together.It looks like Kronika and Geras both confront Liu Kang and Kung Lao at the same time, possibly even together, although I thought the leaks stated the two of them didn't get along well.\n\nCassie Cage: Cassie Cage was shown in the BTS video, with a pretty different design and a new voice. She sounds a lot more serious here. Some people were speculating that this is actually a younger version of Sonya, but others have claimed to have seen the word \"Cage\" on her dog tags. Not to mention, this design is drastically different than anything Sonya has been seen in:\n\nKitana : Kitana, in her revenant form was shown in the BTS video. This appears to be story mode cut scene where her and Liu Kang witness dark Raiden fighting off demons in the Netherrealm. While she isn't shown in gameplay, this does seem to be a new design, not to mention that it appears to be her that Cassie is readying to fight when she is shown (\"Kitana... empress of the dead...\")\n\n:\n\nKabal???: This one, I'm not one hundred percent sure about. During the opening of the show while talking about the Kombat Kast, a figure can be seen zooming across the monitors for a split second. We can hear the host ask \"Was that Kab--\" before being cut off and told to wait for the Kombat Kast on the 1/30. This is unfortunately the best screenshot I have because there were only about 4 frames worth anything:\n\nTo me it looks like this figure is wearing tan-yellow pants, a sleeveless greenish vest, and something on his back. Combine that with a character who's special ability is quick dashes, and I land on Kabal, maybe with his hook swords tied to his back:\n\nShinnok: I do not believe Shinnok will be playable in this game, but he can be seen in the story mode prologue being tortured and decapitated (yet still alive) by Raiden. This is apparently right before the final scene of MKX in which he delivers Shinnok as a severed head to Liu Kang and Kitana. It is interesting from a story perspective though; apparently there is a certain \"truth\" that elder gods don't want them to know, but that Shinnok and Raiden could see from wearing the amulet. As a severed head, he is also confronted by Kronika, who seems to be sympathetic towards him. I wonder if she will interfere with the timeline and stop him from being delivered back to the Netherrealm somehow?\n\nSo far those are the only ones I have solid proof for. I do know that there was some more information included with the leaks, which are not proven credible, but we'll just have to wait to see the rest of it come to life. Anyways feel free to discuss and add other cool stuff from today's big reveal. There was so much to go through that I wouldn't be surprised if I missed something.\n\nUpdate!\n\nThanks to the Mortal Kombat Reddit, some Youtubers, and last but not least the users on this thread, there are a couple of extra characters spotted!\n\nFirst, Kitana's playability likelihood is strengthened thanks to this artwork of her in her living attire. This seems to suggest we will also see a version of Kitana before she became the corrupted empress of the NetherRealm. She is shown in the icon for the customization menu:\n\nJohnny Cage: I actually recall seeing him in the background of the special forces stage, but I thought he was just a generic special forces guy in sunglasses. With this closer look, I can now see it does indeed look like Johnny Cage. Although he is in the background, he does seem to be sporting a slightly new design with a new color palette. That, paired with the fact that background characters have been playable in the past, suggests he may be playable.\n\nBut if that's not enough, this screenshot was found showing this character apparently in-game facing off against Sub-Zero:\n\nKano: In one of the pro MK player versus sessions, one of the hosts cited that the character drinking whiskey in the background of the Black Dragon club is Kano. Upon closer inspection, this appears to be true:\n\nNormally I'd say this appears to be just a little background reference; however, the local multiplayer card also features a detailed portrait of Kano (and another look for Cassie Cage), which makes me think Kano may yet be playable in this game:\n\nNoob Saibot: This portrait of Noob was spotted on the towers in the MK11 demo. I believe this is not a direct character confirmation, and more of an icon for Kombat modifiers, similar to what MKX had. I would imagine that when you participate in a match with Kombat modifiers, you would get something like Noob's shadow attack interfering with the match. Keep in mind that if this is indeed true, it doesn't necessarily de-confirm the character as playable. I believe MKX had Cyrax's bombs as a modifier, and later had Cyrax available via one of Triborg's variations:\n\nSmoke(?): A grey ninja appears on one of the menu cards. Although this ninja is grey like Smoke, there is little else to suggest that this is indeed the character. Especially considering that Scorpion has some color variations that make him look similar to this:\n\nCyrax: Again, this one appears to be only a Kombat modifier; Sub-zero is seen being caught in one of Cyrax's green nets in a screenshot of the gameplay footage. Like MKX, I think this is just to add some flare to the matches. I do hope that Cyrax is in the base roster though; of all they Cybers, he is my personal favorite:\n\nLong time no posting here.\n\nI think there is a rather intuitive/logical way of guessing what characters are making the cut and which aren't. For years now, NRS hasn't done any 'surprise omissions'. MK:A had all characters ever, MK9 had a highly classic roster and MKX didn't deviate from that very much.\n\nChances of a character making the cut depends on three elemens:\n\n- does the audience like them?\n\n- does NRS like them?\n\n- does NRS think we expect them to be in (i.e. how many previous appearances have they had)?\n\nI'm counting here on a final roster of 25 base playable characters +6 DLCs.\n\nSonya, Raiden, Scorpion and (a) Sub-Zero have been in nearly every MK game and they are in this one, too. Same with Liu Kang, Kung Lao and Kitana. The latter three are all but confirmed to be in MK11. Rounding these out is Jax with the most reliable appearance record, so I believe there is a 90% chance of him being in the game. That would make 8 characters.\n\nThe next batch doesn't have as many appearances as the 'core group' but is hot on its heels: Kano, Reptile, Baraka, Mileena and Johnny Cage. I'm wagering at least 3/4 (+Baraka, who is already confirmed) of these will make the cut, if not all of them. Also consider that Sonya and Mileena being in the game are very good indicators of Kano's and Mileena's presence, since these two never appear in an MK game without their arch-enemy (though it doesn't hold true the other way around). Baraka has also never appeared in an MK game without Mileena. Anyway, adding 3 out of these 4 (+Baraka) would raise the total to 12. Mileena, Cage and Kano look like the most likely candidates.\n\nFrom the other MK1/2 alumni, Goro, Noob, Jade, Kintaro, Shang Tsung and Smoke are spottier to predict. NRS loves them some Goro even if players tend to be more on the fence. We know Shao Kahn is already in. Smoke is often treated as a part-character (as with Noob-Smoke or Triborg) and the rest's appearance record is more uneven. My impression is that Noob, Smoke and Jade at least have sizeable fan bases. Kintaro has never been in an MK game without Goro. If Goro is in, Kintaro's chances improve, but only very slightly, since already one 'former boss' character is in the game. Out of these 6, I think 2 or 3 more will get a spot. My bets are on Smoke (in some form), Jade and Noob (+Shao Kahn). That makes 16.\n\nThings get more depressing if we turn to the class of (U)MK3. I'm not going to list them exhaustively, but looking at the track record, Cyrax, Sektor, Kabal, Nightwolf, Ermac, Rain and Sindel stand a bit above the rest. Kabal is all but confirmed and I think 2 or 3 more characters from this era will join him. Oddly, in terms of playability, Kabal is historically in sync with Nightwolf and Sindel, so perhaps either one of them will get the nod (though correlation =/= causation). NRS love Ermac, and should Sektor be somehow confirmed, it's a dead certainty Cyrax is in (Sektor never appears without Cyrax). Rain has a big fan base. My bets: Ermac, Rain and Cyrax (in some capacity) +Kabal. That's 20.\n\nMK4 started the sad tradition of introducing new characters only to throw them into the garbage later, with Quan Chi as the sole exception, Tanya getting two more shots, and Shinnok getting rehabilitated in MKX. Discontent about no playable Fujin was big in the fan community, and Reiko has a sizeable fan base. I think Fujin has the biggest chance to make his return to the big stage (though I wouldn't count out Reiko or Tanya). That's 21.\n\nThe MK:DA and MK:D era brought us three reappearing characters: Kenshi, Li Mei and Bo' Rai Cho. NRS loves their drunken master and Kenshi seems to be liked by the audience. My bet: Kenshi and if not Kenshi, perhaps a surprise return of an unlikely character with an attempt to rehabilitate it. Who that might be is anyone's guess, though for sure it isn't going to be Hsu Hao. Perhaps a female character is the roster looks too male-oriented, or perhaps a character with a fan base, like Havik. Anyway, that makes 22.\n\nSkarlet was the only truly new MK9 character and she's in. That's 23.\n\nMKX actually succeeded at creating a batch of new characters that seem to have resonated with the audience. There is a very high chance Cassie is in the game. Looking at most picked characters in MKX online, Takeda stands out as a popular new kid, so I would peg him to be there, too. Erron Black was also popular right from the start. My conservative estimate is they will bring back 3 or 4 of those new faces, with the aforementioned three getting the nod. If they pick a fourth one, Tremor and Ferra/Tor stand out as unlikeliest, the former for being too close to Geras in his moveset, the latter because of their unpopularity (though NRS has been relentlessly foisting Bo' Rai Cho on us for years, too, so...). Triborg would be a neat way to have one spot held by three/four characters. Anyway, that would make 27.\n\nThis would mean there's room for 4 new faces, with two of them already held by Geras and Kronika. That leaves us with four unknown 2 newcomers (newkomers?). That's not unheard of for a fighting game in its 11th main instalment.\n\nAs to my personal hopes, that's a different story, and a pointless one at that.\n\nI've noticed that when predicting rosters and/or collecting facts about previous rosters, people have a tendancy to write off the first iteration of each game, and act like the updates are all that matters. When I hear things like, \"Jax has never missed a chapter\" or \"Mileena has never been in a game without Kitana\" ... I think there's a flaw in that logic. Because both of those statements aren't true.\n\nI understand that Jax got added to Unchained... but he wasn't in Deception. I understand that Kitana got added to Unchained, but she also wasn't in Deception. And even when they got added, neither of them were very fleshed out. They were added to 1 handheld port, using their existing models from MKDA, as a bit of bonus flavor to sell the game to people who had already played Deception to death. It's not like they were first string roster choices, available in the most played or the most accessible versions of the game.\n\nSame kind of logic often applies to games like UMK3, MKT & MK Gold. I admit, UMK3 was probably just as accessible, if not more accessible than MK3, but MK Gold was far from the most accessible version of 4. And in any case, none of them were the first string roster.\n\nI mean Scorpion HAS missed a game. Reptile has missed 2. Mileena has been in a game without Kitana. Kitana has been in a game without Mileena. Just because Unchained exists, doesn't mean that the roster choices made in Deception never existed. If you get my drift? *Shrug*\n\nIf anything I'd say games like Unchained, Gold, Ultimate or Trilogy help us predict patterns for potential DLC more than for the core rosters. They basically served the function of DLC before DLC existed.\n\nBut I'm rambling.\n\nI don't think Cyrax, Rain, Reptile & Shinnok have good odds, because I think the tower modifiers are a bad sign. Reptile is by far the most likely of the 4, and he's sat out 2 games before.\n\nI think Kano & Cage have decent odds, just based on the screen grabs we've seen. But. I personally don't need them.\n\nI'm up in the air on Mileena. I'd love to see her return, and I think she easily could. But I think she could easily sit too. She's sat more than once before, and her death was very deliberate in MKX."
