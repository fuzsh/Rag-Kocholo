        "text": "Mortal Kombat 2020 is out. Reception is mixed at best but even I can’t deny that the movie has so many video game nods that I chuckled more than a few times.\n\nAs a millennial who played both the first and second Mortal Kombat in arcades before purchasing both on Sega’s Genesis, performing the ABACABB blood code in MK1 (recalled here from memory). I moved on to MK 3 and ultimate MK3 on the SNES. Then MK Trilogy on the N64 and despite how negatively it’s talked about nowadays MK4 was crazy fun and those 3d fatalities were mind-blowing! The unreal tournament’s early 2000’s forums alongside ‘goodbags’, the announcement of MK5, its evolution into Deadly alliance, the excellence of unlocking the Krypt, MK Deception, MK Konquest, Midway’s bankruptcy, etc.\n\nIt has been a wild ride to be an MK fan experiencing the phenomenon in real-time. Once the series started skipping Nintendo platforms I kept up to speed via youtube and now thanks to the Switch I’m back with MK11, (which I recommend for the story but the microtransactions potentially mean I’m done with the series as a video game).\n\nI am pleased with Mortal Kombat 2020, was I expecting a Grammy winner? Nope!\n\nI was hoping for better than Mk Annihilation…\n\nThat I did get!\n\nTo celebrate the diversity of the series I’m counting down my favorite Black characters from the series to date!\n\nFIGHT!\n\nCyrax\n\nCyrax is a character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series, who made his debut in Mortal Kombat 3.\n\nMaking his debut in Mortal Kombat 3, Cyrax was one of the three cybernetic ninjas created by the Lin Kuei, in an effort to convert all members into unfeeling, cold-hearted, cybernetic assassins to improve their performance. Of all the three cyborgs, Cyrax appears to be specialized in Hand-to-Hand Combat. He was assigned to hunt down the renegade, former Lin Kuei member Sub-Zero as designated unit LK-4D4. Of the three cyborgs, he has become the first to recover his humanity. This is due to the efforts made by Sonya Blade and Jax Briggs. He has currently allied with them as a token of his appreciation. In the alternate timeline of MK 2011, he was automated and dutifully serves the Lin Kuei, but was visibly opposed to the process before being presumably automated against his will.\n\n~FIND OUT MORE HERE~\n\nJade\n\nJade first appeared as a secret, unplayable character in Mortal Kombat II, and made her official debut in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.\n\nJade is a childhood friend of Princess Kitana. While her motives were unclear, she served Shao Kahn alongside Kitana and Mileena as his personal assassin for most of her life.

She ultimately chose to join her friend and has since loyally assisted Kitana in her quest to free their native realm and restore its original beauty.\n\n~FIND OUT MORE HERE~\n\nJax\n\nMajor Jackson “Jax” Briggs (U.S.A.) is a cybernetically-enhanced soldier who is the leader of the Outer World Investigation Agency (O.I.A.), Earthrealm’s Special Forces unit, in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series.

In the Special Forces’ chain of command, he is Sonya Blade’s direct superior and the catalyzing force of Sonya’s impulsiveness. Jax is clear-headed, careful and always keeping a watch on what his men are doing. When the need arises, he is a beast on the battlefield with the attitude and ferocity of a lion. He unscrupulously makes use of the most advanced technology to improve both himself and his unit. He is responsible for the crime lord Kano’s disfigurement, forcing him to wear a metal plate over a portion of his face.
