        "text": "Yes, King Farouk could not rule Egypt as he should have. Aside from being a weak ruler who could not take a correct decision without Ahmed Pasha Hassenein, everyone was against him, including the royal family itself and the political class.\n\nHowever, history remembers that he could have easily squashed the officers' movement with his orders. But he was leaving Alexandria for good, and he told General Naguib that he wished that the officers would succeed in what he had failed to do. Naguib would know in a bitter that it was a cursed mission that would follow and follow his sons.\n\nMohamed Naguib and his sons in their house in Cairo\n\nin October 1952\n\nThe Free Officers Movement had a brief period of success. They overthrew the monarchy and implemented some progressive reforms. However, they soon became or rather Gamal Abdel Nasser launched a repressive dictatorship. It suppressed freedom of speech, jailed political opponents, and nationalized businesses.\n\nThey promised to bring democracy and social justice to Egypt, but they ultimately failed to deliver on their promises.\n\nThe story of the Free Officers Movement is a cautionary tale about the dangers of military coups. They may seem like a quick fix for a country's problems, but we know how it ended.\n\nEgypt in 1955 at some public meeting and from left to right starting with the officer\n\nlooking to the camera yet blurred: Zakaria Mohi El-Din then Gamal Salem then\n\nGamal Abdel Nasser then Abdel Hakim Amar and Salah Salem laughing\n\nFarouk knew that he had failed, and he actually left without a fight. This is a rare event in Egyptian history, as rulers typically do not admit that they are wrong, and they will not leave unless they are dead or killed.\n\nIronically, Farouk was one of the few Egyptian rulers who broke this cycle. He died in Rome a decade later, but he at least had the courage to step down when he realized that he was no longer fit to rule.\n\nIn any case, I feel like I am repeating myself here, but on the occasion of commemorating the Free Officers' coup, which we are still living with its impact, I decided to share with you some photos of Gamal Abdel Nasser and his comrades in colour as I have done above.\n\nNasser and his wife Tahia Kadem at their house in Cairo hours\n\nbefore the wedding of their daughter Hoda in 1964\n\nThat photo is from Hoda Abdel Nasser's family album\n\nRecently, historical photography fans in Egypt discovered that Getty Images had shared a cache of Kodachrome photos from Egypt. These photos are beautiful, and they offer a new perspective on Egypt's past. In a surprise, it seems that Hoda Abdel Nasser shared some of the family photos involving Nasser and her mother, the late first lady Tahia Kadem, with Getty Images.\n\nNasser and his first granddaughter Hala Sadek who was born in\n\nwinter 1970 so I assume that photo was taken before his death\n\nshortly.\n\nI used to see Egypt in the old days in black and white, but the Kodachrome photos are on another level. They are so vibrant and colourful, and they really bring history to life.\n\nThe General Nationalist Conference of 1969 in Cairo\n\nNasser left that legacy of endless conferences with bottomless talk\n\nI am one of those people who could never imagine what Gamal Abdel Nasser would look like in colour photos. He always appeared in my mind in the black-and-white version.\n\nNow I attack Nasser most of the time due to his internal political and economic policies but I have to say that his foreign policies were not all wrong especially when it comes to supporting African countries and other third world countries. Again we depend on that legacy in Africa now."
