        "text": "_\n\nJoin us as we take a look at what members of the aristocracy wore on their wedding day!\n\nTo mark the Prince and Princess of Wales' 13th wedding anniversary on April 29, 2024, we're taking a look at the best and worst royal wedding dresses in recent decades…\n\nKate Middleton donned a long-sleeve Alexander McQueen ivory satin and lace dress when she married Prince William on April 29, 2011, at Westminster Abbey and became the Duchess of Cambridge (and, later, the Princess of Wales). The gown, made by English designer Sarah Burton — the luxury fashion brand's creative director — also featured an eight-foot train. The lace appliqué on the bodice and skirt was hand-embroidered by workers at the Royal School of Needlework.\n\nKeep reading to see dozens more of the best royal wedding gowns in recent history…\n\nMORE: Follow Wonderwall on MSN for more fun celebrity & entertainment photo galleries and content\n\n_\n\nPrincess Beatrice of York married property developer Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi at The Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge in Windsor, England, on July 17, 2020.\n\nBut unlike most royal brides, instead of wearing a new bespoke designer dress on her wedding day, Princess Beatrice chose a vintage creation — an ivory Peau De Soie taffeta gown by Norman Hartnell that belonged to her grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II (the monarch memorably wore the dress to the 1962 London premiere of \"Lawrence of Arabia\").\n\nThe dress was altered — Beatrice added sheer organza puff sleeves and a new hemline — by the queen's personal designer and wardrobe maven, Angela Kelly, and British bridal designer Stewart Parvin.\n\nKeep reading for another look, plus details on that familiar-looking tiara…\n\nMORE: Royal engagement rings\n\n_\n\nOn her wedding day in July 2020, Princess Beatrice accessorized her vintage Norman Hartnell wedding dress with a classic veil topped with the Queen Mary Fringe Tiara — the same tiara that her grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, wore on her own wedding day in 1947. The monarch's daughter, Princess Anne, also wore the tiara at her 1973 wedding.\n\nMORE: Royal wedding tiaras\n\n_\n\nIn June 2021, the late Princess Diana's bridal attire went on display at London's Kensington Palace — where she lived while raising her sons — for the first time in more than 25 years as part of Historic Royal Palaces' \"Royal Style In The Making\" exhibition, which runs until Jan. 2, 2022. The dress, which was designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel for the former Lady Diana Spencer's July 1981 wedding, was last seen at the palace in 1995, though it later was put on display at Althorp, her childhood home where she is now buried. Keep reading to see the dress on Diana…\n\nMORE: Royal engagement rings\n\n_\n\nPrincess Diana's wedding dress, which was designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel for the former Lady Diana Spencer and Prince Charles's July 1981 nuptials, is one of the most iconic of all time. The ivory silk taffeta dress is covered in 10,000 mother of pearl sequins as well as panels of antique Carrickmacross lace that originally belonged to Britain's Queen Mary (ex-husband Charles's great-grandmother). Di accessorized with a 25-foot sequined train and the Spencer family tiara.\n\n_\n\nAhead of Princess Eugenie of York's wedding to Jack Brooksbank on Oct. 12, 2018, there was only one thing we knew for sure about her wedding gown: It would be from a Britain-based designer. On the big day, the bride delivered in a stunning white Peter Pilotto dress and a gorgeous Greville Emerald Kokoshnik Tiara.\n\nThe royal had opened up to British Vogue about her selection a month earlier, explaining that she knew exactly what she wanted to wear on her big day: \"[The dress] is the one thing that I was really decisive about. As soon as we announced the wedding, I knew the designer and the look straight away.\"\n\nThe beautiful dress included personal touches and symbols. \"The symbols are a Thistle for Scotland acknowledging the couple's fondness for Balmoral, a Shamrock for Ireland as a nod to the Bride's Ferguson family, the York Rose and ivy representing the couple's home [at Ivy Cottage at Kensington Palace],\" The Palace explained.\n\nHowever, the biggest surprise was that the bride opted to forgo a veil!\n\n_\n\nCamilla Parker Bowles became Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, when she married Prince Charles — who's now King Charles III — in 2005. For their blessing ceremony following a civil service, she wore a striking floor-length pale blue coat embroidered with gold designs atop a matching chiffon gown from designers Robinson Valentine, now known as Anna Valentine. The future Queen Camilla topped it all off with a gold feather headpiece by Philip Treacy.\n\n_\n\nBefore their religious blessing ceremony, Camilla Parker Bowles and Prince Charles — now King Charles III — legally tied the knot in a civil service at the Windsor Guildhall on April 9, 2005.\n\nFor that ceremony, the future Queen Camilla wore a short cream silk chiffon dress trimmed in Swiss-made appliqué discs under a matching oyster silk coat. Like her second wedding dress, the ensemble was designed by London label Robinson Valentine. Camilla accessorized with a diamond and gray pearl Prince of Wales brooch on her lapel and a French lace and feather-trimmed hat by milliner Philip Treacy.\n\n_\n\nOld Hollywood darling Grace Kelly became European royalty when she got hitched to Prince Rainier III of Monaco in 1956 in a gown designed by Hollywood costumer Helen Rose — who also designed memorable looks for Elizabeth Taylor (including her first wedding dress, when she married Conrad \"Nicky\" Hilton). This chic high-neck gown was made from 25 yards of taffeta and 125-year-old lace embroidered with pearls.\n\n_\n\nOn Nov. 20, 1947, Britain's Princess Elizabeth married Philip Mountbatten, Duke of Edinburgh — who was born Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark — in a silk and satin wedding gown sewn with thousands of seed pearls. Though she was royalty, the future Queen Elizabeth II still had to purchase the fabric with ration coupons since the wedding took place during England's recovery from World War II. Her ethereal train was star-patterned and inspired by a Botticelli painting from 1482.\n\n_\n\nHere's a closer look at the details on Queen Elizabeth II's wedding dress, which she wore with the Queen Mary Fringe Tiara when she married Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten, Duke of Edinburgh (later known as Prince Philip) at Westminster Abbey in London on Nov. 20, 1947.\n\n_\n\nMeghan Markle looked positively stunning in a wedding dress created by British designer Clare Waight Keller, the first female artistic director at French fashion house Givenchy, when she married Prince Harry on May 19, 2018. Keep reading to see it from another angle…\n\n_\n\nDuchess Meghan's white silk dress featured an open bateau neckline, three-quarter-length sleeves, a train and an underskirt made of triple silk organza. Her 5-meter-long veil featured an embroidered flower from each of the 53 countries of the British Commonwealth plus two of Meghan's favorites — wintersweet, which grows in front of Nottingham Cottage at Kensington Palace, where she lived with Prince Harry at the time, and the California poppy, the state flower of her home state. She secured her veil with Queen Mary's diamond bandeau tiara, which she borrowed from Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nMORE: See the best photos from Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan's wedding\n\n_\n\nCrown Princess Victoria of Sweden wore an ivory silk Pär Engsheden gown for her wedding to her personal trainer-turned-prince husband, Daniel Westling, in 2010.
