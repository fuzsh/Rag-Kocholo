        "text": "Venetia Anna Karkalemis OBITUARY\n\nVenetia Anna Karkalemis March 10, 1914 – June 17, 2017 Resident of Pleasanton, California Venetia Karkalemis passed away peacefully at home on Saturday surrounded by her loved ones. Her strong spirit, love of life, her cooking, readiness to laugh and joke and so much more, made her a joy to everyone that knew her. Born in Imbros, a small island of Greece, she left her native country with her Dad at the age of 14, and immigrated to Alexandria, Egypt. In Egypt, she met her husband and gave birth to her two sons, Yannis and Constantinos.\n\nBy trade she was a seamstress for the Royal Family of Egypt, Narriman Sadek, in the 1940s. Eventually she would follow her son, Constantinos and immigrate to the United States.\n\nFor many years she lived part of the time in Athens, Greece, and in California with her two sons, Constantinos and Yanni. She very proudly eventually became a US Citizen. She spoke fluently Greek, Arabic, French, Italian and English.\n\nVenetia is survived by her loving son, Constantinos Karkalemis, her grandson, Yanni and predeceased by her son, Yanni and her late husband, Pannoyotis. A special mention for all her caregivers over the years, especially, Patrick O’Meara, and many close, loving friends and relatives who visited frequently.\n\nFriends and family are invited to a viewing on Wednesday, June 28, 2017 from 11 am to Noon and funeral service from noon to 1 pm at Callaghan Mortuary, 3833 East Avenue, Livermore, CA 94550 with burial service following at Memory Gardens.\n\nA Celebration of Life will follow at the private home of her son."
