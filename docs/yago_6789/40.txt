Press photo with caption dated 14 February 1951. Photographer unknown, but it is most likely Studio Riad Shehata. This was one of the official engagement photographs sent to all news outlets around the world. “Future Queen of Egypt…Cairo, Egypt: Narriman Sadek, 17-year-old commoner who will marry the King of Egypt, poses in her engagement gown for an official picture. Egypt’s premier made the announcement of her engagement to King Farouk, 31, in a radio broadcast, and paid tribute to the King for selecting his wife from the ranks of the people.”
