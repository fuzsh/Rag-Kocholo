        "text": "John Henson, a son of Muppets creator Jim Henson, died on Friday at age 48. His sister said he suffered a \"massive heart attack\" at his home in Saugerties, New York. He was apparently playing in the snow, building an igloo with his daughter.\n\nThe Jim Henson Company said, \"It is with great sadness that we confirm that John Henson, son of Jim and Jane Henson and brother to Lisa, Cheryl, Brian and Heather, died at age 48 of a sudden massive heart attack on Friday, February 14, while at home with his daughter. John served as a shareholder and board member of The Jim Henson Company. He leaves two daughters, Katrina (15) and Sydney (10) and his wife Gyongyi. A private service is being planned.\"\n\nHenson was a puppeteer, playing Sweetums in Muppet Treasure Island and It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie.\n\nHis sister Cheryl Henson told the AP that he was an \"artist who also loved working the land.\""
