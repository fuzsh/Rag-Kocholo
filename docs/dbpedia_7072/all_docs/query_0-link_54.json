John served as a shareholder and board member of The Jim Henson Company. He leaves two daughters, Katrina (15) and Sydney (10) and his wife Gyongyi. A private service is being planned.\n\nJohn Henson was co-owner of the Jim Henson Company, but he also worked as a performer and craftsman as well. He was a company shareholder and board member.\n\nFor those that are familiar with Sweetums, he was the voice of him as well.\n\nJohn Henson played the role of Sweetums from the late 80s until 2005. Many that travel to Disney’s Hollywood Studios can enjoy his performance as Sweetums in MuppetVision 3D.\n\nA private service is being planned."
