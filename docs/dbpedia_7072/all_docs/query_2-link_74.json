        "text": "Photo provided courtesy of The Jim Henson Company\n\nEach month, our Journeys of Innovation series tells the stories of inventors or entrepreneurs who have made a positive difference in the world. This month, we focus on the journey of Jim Henson, who brought us the Muppets.\n\nJim Henson made his first puppet while still in high schoolâ€”and landed a spot on television because of it. Over the next 36 years, he used his knack for puppeteering, along with his strong ability to collaborate and unique sense of humor, to create a cast of unforgettable characters, leaving a legacy that is still entertaining audiences today.\n\nRead the story now.\n\nStay connected with the USPTO by subscribing to regular email updates.\n\nVisit our subscription center at www.uspto.gov/subscribe to update or change your email preferences.\n\nThis email was sent from an unmonitored mailbox.
