        "text": "According to a new report from the Wrap, the Jim Henson Company is selling its Los Angeles studio lot at 1416 La Brea Avenue as âpart of a much longer-term strategyâ to merge an undisclosed future location with its Jim Henson Creature Shop in Burbank, California. The building has headquartered the company since 2000, shortly after the release of the Sci-Fi Channelâs Farscape and Muppets From Space.\n\nBefore becoming ground zero for all things felt and googly-eyed, the historic lot served as Charlie Chaplin Studios from 1917-1953; it was then taken over by Red Skelton, whereupon it became the shooting location for multiple classic TV series, including The Adventures of Superman and Perry Mason. Grander still, the building went on to house A&M Studios from 1966-1999, where Nine Inch Nails recorded The Downward Spiral and U.S.A for Africa recorded charity single âWe Are the World.â\n\nAccording to the Wrap, when the Henson family first moved into the property, company CEO Lisa Henson described it as a âlovable hodge-podge of quirky, unusual spaces. There are unexpected elements in some of the offices, like original vaults and fish-tank-like bathrooms. Itâs not your typical corporate space, but itâs ideal for the Muppets.â Brian Henson, chairman of the Jim Henson Company, is also quoted as saying âwhen we heard the Chaplin lot was for sale, we had to have it. Itâs the perfect home for the Muppets and our particular brand of classy but eccentric entertainment.â Perhaps the iconic lotâs next buyer will share a similar sentiment."
