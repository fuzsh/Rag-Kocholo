We are thrilled that approximately half of our expanded museum space is dedicated to the Jim Henson Collection.\n\nThis interactive exhibition follows Henson’s prolific imagination chronologically, transporting visitors through environments that typified the master puppeteer’s world such as Jim’s Office and the Television Studio.\n\nIn addition to learning how Henson’s characters came to life and are still performed, visitors can view iconic puppets such as Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy.\n\nONGOING\n\nSee website for current dates and times\n\nNon-Members: $10.50, Members: FREE\n\nFantasy: Worlds of Myth and Magic\n\nThe Jim Henson Company\n\nMoPOP\n\n325 5th Avenue N\n\nSeattle, WA\n\nmopop.org/about-mopop/the-mopop-blog/posts/2022/november/artifact-spot-dark-crystal/\n\nThe Jim Henson Company has gifted MoPOP with a carefully selected group of artifacts from the Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, and our valiant curatorial wizards have gone above and beyond to create a space that immerses visitors in the fantasy world. The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, a prequel to The Dark Crystal (1982), tells the story of Brea, Deet, and Rian, three Gelfling in the land of Thra who discover the horrifying secret behind the evil Skeksis' power, then set out on an epic journey to ignite the fires of rebellion and save their world.\n\nOpen 10:00am–5:00pm\n\nOpen daily except Wednesdays\n\nCardboard Cinema: Robin Frohardt's Handmade Worlds\n\nMASS MoCA\n\n1040 MASS MoCA Way\n\nNorth Adams, MA\n\nmassmoca.org/event/cardboard-cinema/\n\nCardboard Cinema: Robin Frohardt’s Handmade Worlds is now on view in MASS MoCA’s Kidspace. This companion project to The Plastic Bag Store is an installation of handmade cardboard sets and puppets accompanied by Robin Frohardt’s animated short films. Known for her rich aesthetic and highly detailed constructions, Robin Frohardt is a theater and film director whose work uses recognizable materials, often trash, to create richly detailed worlds that consider the relationship between capitalism and the resulting environmental catastrophe. The tactile quality of cardboard, the low-fi animation effects, rich sound, and dynamic lighting combine to create a cinematic expression that defies the humbleness of the material. Frohardt began using cardboard with the Cardboard Institute of Technology, a collective of artists creating immersive cardboard environments in San Francisco in the early 2000s. Her first cardboard film “Fitzcardboardaldo” premiered in 2013 at the Telluride Film Festival.\n\nOpen six days a week, 10am–5pm\n\nClosed Tuesdays\n\nFree\n\nThe Jim Henson Exhibition\n\nMuseum of the Moving Image\n\nMuseum of the Moving Image\n\n36-01 35th Ave.\n\nAstoria, NY\n\nmovingimage.us/event/the-jim-henson-exhibition/\n\n718-777-6888\n\nThe Jim Henson Exhibition explores Henson's groundbreaking work for film and television and his transformative impact on popular culture. This new exhibition features approximately 300 objects to tell the story of how Henson and a talented team of designers, performers, and writers created an unparalleled body of work that continues to delight and inspire people of all ages. Among the highlights are nearly 50 puppets including Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Rowlf, Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Gobo Fraggle, and Wendell Porcupine; character sketches, storyboards, scripts, and photographs; and nearly 30 monitors with video clips from throughout his career and three large-scale video installations.\n\nONGOING\n\nSee website for current dates and times\n\n$9-$15\n\nDown in Fraggle Rock Special Exhibition\n\nCenter for Puppetry Arts\n\nCenter for Puppetry Arts\n\n1404 Spring Street NW at 18th\n\nAtlanta, GA\n\npuppet.org/programs/down-in-fraggle-rock/\n\nLet the Center for Puppetry Arts remind you that worries are always for another day with a visit to this new special exhibition. Take a deep dive into the Fraggle Rock universe with this behind-the-scenes look into the history and making of the 1980s Henson Company classic TV show Fraggle Rock, and the 2022 version of the series Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock. Classic characters from the original series including Sprocket, Red, Mokey, and the original Jr. Gorg, are joined by new characters featured in Fraggle Rock: Back to The Rock such as The Fraggle Troubadours and returning characters like The Ink Spots. Silly creatures, you won’t want to miss this one!\n\nOpen Tuesday through Sunday\n\nMuseum entry ends at 4:30pm\n\nNon-Members: $10.50, Members: FREE\n\nFrom Home/To Home\n\nSandglass Theater\n\nBrattleboro Museum & Art Center\n\n10 Vernon St\n\nBrattleboro, VT\n\nbrattleboromuseum.org/\n\nSandglass Theater’s work has often been influenced by the places that Sandglass' creators have lived. In 1986, we moved from Germany to Vermont, and new themes from local history, weather, and culture found their way into several of our productions. Two of these productions, in particular, strike us as signposts in current and vital community conversations. The first is All Weather Ballads, which we created in 2010. Our goal was to create songs and scenes about objects and phenomena in our local landscape and lore: ice fishing shanties, muddy roads, apple ladders, rooftops, and, of course, the wood pile. These iconic objects and activities are linked to the seasons, which come with their own history, but are, today, unpredictable. Fast forward to 2016. Sandglass embarks on a multi-year project about migration and refugees, titled Babylon. In this piece, there are again songs, which tell the stories of six refugees who are fleeing war and violence in Afghanistan, Syria, El Salvador, and Burundi, as well as a remembered European war of the mid-20th century (the characters are based on real people). There are also objects of significance: life vests, toys made in refugee camps, pages torn from a book. Again, objects hold our stories and help make them tactile. We pair these two productions during a time of welcoming new neighbors from other parts of the world. We hope this exhibit adds to our reflections about where we come from, where we are going, and who we are traveling with on this road and in this unique place.\n\nCircle of Water: Puppetry as an Agent of Change\n\nSandy Spieler and Laura Wilhelm\n\nHennepin History Museum\n\n2303 3rd Ave S\n\nMinneapolis, MN\n\nhennepinhistory.org/avada_portfolio/circle-of-water-puppetry-as-an-agent-of-change/\n\nIn 1983, a troupe of performers traveled down the Mississippi River from Brainerd, Minnesota to New Orleans, Louisiana in honor of water. A multi-faceted project spanning six months, the Circle of Water Circus honored the Mississippi River, fostered community, and raised awareness of the ecological distress of the river through the ancient tradition of puppetry. Produced by In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre (HOBT), the main attraction was a performance featuring 150 puppets and original music that explored the devastation of colonialism throughout the history of the region with an optimistic look towards the future. Forty years later, Hennepin History Museum pays tribute to this unique example of artistic activism in Circle of Water: Puppetry As An Agent of Change. This exhibit showcases a wide array of puppets alongside footage and music of the original show while presenting the experiences and perspectives of the performers.\n\nOpening Reception: Saturday, June 29 from 3 – 5 pm\n\nPay As You Can\n\nPuppetry NOW special exhibition featuring Raymond Carr\n\nRaymond Carr\n\nCenter for Puppetry Arts\n\n1404 Spring St NW\n\nAtlanta, GA\n\npuppet.org/programs/puppetry-now-special-exhibition-featuring-raymond-carr/\n\nThe Center for Puppetry Arts is excited to announce the return of Puppetry NOW for its fourth year. Puppetry NOW is a Center initiative that spotlights the work of contemporary artists and puppeteers of color. Experience puppetry, props, and behind-the-scenes photos from the work of Raymond Carr’s production company, Ninja Puppet Productions, as well as iconic, international puppets that Raymond has worked with over his impressive 20-year career.

Our new exhibit is \"Around the World with Puppets\" and is open Thursday to Sunday from 2 pm to 8 pm. This display features Puppets from all around the world - some in their Holiday finest, others in their traditional garb, but all of them playing together in Peace, Love, Hope and Harmony. We have Puppets on display from North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Australia, the Far East, the Middle East, the Near East, and everywhere on the globe from which we have puppets. We even have a rare, newly-donated Water Puppet from Vietnam.\n\nONGOING\n\nThursday - Sunday 2pm-8pm\n\nIn the Heart of the Beast Puppet Library\n\nAvalon Theater\n\n1500 E Lake St\n\nMinneapolis, MN\n\nhttps://hobt.org/puppet-library/\n\nHeart of the Beast is installing the twin cities first Puppet and Mask Lending Library at our very own Avalon Theater. The lending library will be a collection of puppets and masks on display, many of which will be available for check out like a book from a library, at no cost to the public. These puppets and masks can be utilized for protests, community events, school plays, personal celebrations and more. During library hours, the public can come for a visit or check out a puppet. Some of our puppets in the library will require puppeteers and/or transportation. For these puppets there will be a fee attached to pay our contracted puppeteers for their time transporting and performing at your event. When you visit the library we will indicate which puppets and masks require puppeteers. Puppeteers and transportation are always available for all puppets for an additional cost. You will be able to visit the puppet library during its hours of operation. The puppet library will be open every other Saturday from 10 am to 2 pm, on the first and third Saturday of the month. You can check our online calendar to confirm it’s open. During your visit you can check out a puppet with a volunteer or staff person working at the front desk. You will get a mini lesson in how to wear and operate the puppet or mask that you are borrowing. Puppets can be checked out for a maximum of two weeks at a time. If you want to return your puppet before then you can make arrangements with us.\n\nThe Helstien Collection\n\nFowler Museum at UCLA\n\nFowler Museum at UCLA\n\n308 Charles E Young Dr N\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\nfowler.ucla.edu/research\n\n310-825-4361\n\nSince the early tenth century BCE, historians, grammarians, priests, and poets have celebrated the art of puppetry in India. Deeply rooted in the Hindu tradition, shadow puppetry is a form of folk theater that is transmitted orally and performed by itinerant puppeteers and musicians who travel the vast countryside. Today, it is a fast-disappearing art, and its demise threatens the traditional tales, stories of local village life, and reworkings of the great Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata. This collection provides access to the field research materials of the late Dr. Melvyn Helstein, professor of theater arts at UCLA, who collected nearly six hundred puppets for the Museum’s collections. Materials include interviews with puppet makers from South India, transcriptions of plays, slides capturing the drama of these nighttime performances, several volumes of diapositives, and pen-and-ink illustrations of puppets.\n\nWednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday - 12pm-5pm\n\nThursday - 12pm-8pm\n\nFree\n\nThe (Aurora) Valentinetti Puppet Museum\n\nEvergreen Children's Theatre\n\nThe (Aurora) Valentinetti Puppet Museum\n\n280 Fourth Street\n\nBremerton, WA\n\nectandpuppets.org\n\n360-479-6226\n\nCelebrating its 21st year (2019), the Museum, a division of Evergreen Children’s Theatre, has a unique history in the NW and Puget Sound area. Situated in the center of Puget Sound, the Museum collections have been supported by local and international donors and collectors. Two large gifts from China and a third from Japan augment a collection nearing 2,000 items all received as gifts. The curator arranges changing exhibits throughout the year. Museum holdings are especially strong in Asian, American-Northwest, and Europe with current strengths in China, India, Indonesia, Burma (Myanmar), University of Washington, Mexico, and England. Nearly 30 countries are represented.\n\nThe Museum celebrates our namesake, Aurora Valentinetti’s designation as the University of Washington’s #Distinguished Teaching Legacy Award winner for 2018 presented by the #UWAA. This recognizes her 50-year teaching career and the influence she has made on generations of puppeteers.\n\nThursday-Friday 10:00am-4:00pm\n\nSaturday 12:00pm-4:00pm\n\nThe Bread and Puppet Museum\n\nBread and Puppet Theater\n\nThe Bread and Puppet Museum\n\n753 Heights Road\n\nGlover, VT\n\nbreadandpuppet.org/museum\n\n802-525-3031\n\nThe Bread and Puppet Museum is a massive accumulation of the puppets, masks, paintings and graphics of the Bread and Puppet Theater, housed in a 150-year-old barn in Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom, 25 miles south of the Canadian border. It is one of the largest collections of some of the biggest puppets and masks in the world. It was created in 1974 when Bread and Puppet Theater moved to this former dairy farm after a residency at Goddard College, and before that close to a decade in New York City. The museum is full to the brim; its population density is an expression not only of the accumulations of time but of the urgencies which inspired the making of so much stuff: the poverty of the poor, the arrogance of the war-mongers, the despair of the victims, and maybe even stronger than that, the glory of this whole god-given world. And naturally, all this will decay in due course.\n\nGrouped according to theme, color, or size, the puppets recreate dramatic scenes from bygone shows and form striking compositions with hand-printed banners and paper-mache reliefs. Over the years, the collection has expanded to fill two floors in the barn and now spills out into the woodshed, the Cheap Art bus across the road, and onto the walls of the Paper-Mache Cathedral behind the barn.\n\nThe museum is open June 1 to November 1, daily 10 am to 6:00 pm, and is also open before and after evening performances. There is a museum tour every Saturday at 6:00pm and Sunday at 1:00 pm during July and August. During the cold months, it is officially closed, but may be opened by appointment or chance.\n\nAdmission is free; donations are welcome"
