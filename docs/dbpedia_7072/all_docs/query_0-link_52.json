        "text": "Daughter of late \"Muppets\" creator Jim Henson, Cheryl Henson serves on the board of directors of the Jim Henson Company and leads the foundation in her father's name, which bestows grants in puppet theatre and advocates for the art form. It was founded in 1982. She is being honored with the second annual New Victory Arts Award.\n\nTartaglia (Avenue Q, ImaginOcean) hosts the 7 PM event that features performances by Irwin (Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?); Arias (Arias With a Twist) in a song directed by Basil Twist; cast members from The Little Prince; Ralph Leeâ€™s Mettawee River Theatre Company; Heather Henson and IBEX Puppetry; dancer/choreographer David Neumann; On the Lam Street Band; the Reduced Shakespeare Company; and \"Sesame Street\" characters Big Bird and Telly Monster.\n\n\"The New 42nd Street is honored that Cheryl Henson has agreed to accept the second annual New Victory Arts Award in recognition of her leadership, support and graceful advocacy of the works of puppeteers and their artistry,\" said New 42nd Street president Cora Cahan in a statement.\n\nThe New Victory Theater, which is run by New 42nd Street, offers a host of family-friendly programming, a sizeable portion of which includes puppet theatre.\n\nThe Henson Foundation has nurtured such artists as Julie Taymor (The Lion King, The Green Bird, Spider-Man), Basil Twist (Peter and Wendy, Symphonie Fantastique, Arias With a Twist) and Mabou Mines' Lee Breuer (Peter and Wendy), all of whom have presented work at the New Victory.\n\nThe foundation also oversaw the Henson International Festival of Puppet Theatre, which Cheryl Henson produced from 1992-2000."
