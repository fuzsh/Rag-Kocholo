        "text": "HOLLYWOOD, CA – Industrial Brothers and The Jim Henson Company are pleased to announce the greenlight of season two of Dot., the original animated series based on the popular children’s book by Randi Zuckerberg and produced by Industrial Brothers (creators of Top Wing, Yup Yups, Gummandos) in association with The Jim Henson Company (Splash and Bubbles, Word Party, Julie’s Green Room, Pajanimals, Dinosaur Train) and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nThe series stars the exuberant and tech-savvy Dot, an 8-year-old girl with a wild curiosity. She and her friends satisfy their imaginations by embarking on hilarious adventures while using technology to enhance their real-world experiences.\n\nThe first season of Dot. (52 x 11’) has been a top performing franchise since its debut in the U.S. on Sprout in September 2016, with all past episodes of the series streaming exclusively on Hulu. The series also currently airs on Canada’s CBC. Season two (26 x 11’) is anticipated to debut in fall 2018.\n\n“Dot. has demonstrated how technology can inspire and enhance all kinds of real world adventures, helping children and their parents find balance and navigate the digital age,” commented Halle Stanford, President of Television at The Jim Henson Company. “Our new season will continue to engage children in the U.S. on Sprout and Hulu, and around the world with our top-tier partners, sharing Dot’s enthusiasm to use tech to connect, play, capture moments, tell stories and most importantly, inspire curiosity.”\n\nMatthew Fernandes, Arthur Spanos, and Tammy Semen, of Industrial Brothers, Lisa Henson and Halle Stanford of The Jim Henson Company, and Zuckerberg will serve as Executive Producers on the new episodes. Yalda Uhls, director of creative community partnerships at Common Sense Media and a senior research scientist at UCLA’s Children’s Digital Media Center @ LA serves as curriculum consultant. The Jim Henson Company handles all media rights for Dot. outside of Canada and all consumer products rights for the property worldwide."
