        "text": "(I used to have a column called Do Not Pass Go, in which I talked about waiting on games to drop. This is the rebranded version of that column, henceforth called The Wish Wall.)\n\nWhile the Jim Henson Company has recently announced multiple licensing partners that will produce merchandise for the 30th anniversary of the movie Labyrinth, one of those products has been in the development for over a year: Jim Henson’s Labyrinth: The Board Game, which will be published this Summer by River Horse, best known as the publishers of The Hunt for Red October, Waterloo—Quelle Affaire!, and Terminator: Genisys board games.\n\nRiver Horse originally announced the game in July of 2015, and while the Facebook page that they created was booming with activity, little was revealed until April of this year, when the game board was revealed on their website…\n\n…and the game pieces were revealed on their Facebook album.\n\nAs you can see, it’s a lovely game just for the art value, even if it turns out to be a simple “roll and move” game. Recent images of game play, however, suggest that there is a lot going on in this game, so that veteran tabletop gamers might want this one to play, not just to admire.\n\nIf this one moves from the Wish Wall to my shelf, I’ll review it on Board of Life.\n\nPre-orders for Jim Henson’s Labyrinth: The Board Game are still open on River Horse’s website."
