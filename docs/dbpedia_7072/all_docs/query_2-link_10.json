        "text": "LOS ANGELES, June 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Jim Henson Company, an established leader in innovative and iconic entertainment, and The Operating Room, a Los Angeles based independent animation production company, are teaming up to develop a new CG/live- action hybrid series Adrenaline Lemmings, created by Alex Orrelle (Klaus, The Incredibles, Space Jam: A New Legacy), David M. Israel (Dynasty, 3rd Rock from the Sun, About a Boy), and Oded Turgeman (Summer Memories, Hawkmaster).\n\nAdrenaline Lemmings features four high-octane, stunt-loving Alaskan Lemmings who accidentally crash-land in the big city. While training for an X-Games-style competition where their danger-defying skills could earn them a trip back home, they learn to thrive in this unfamiliar environment and embrace its unusual animal society. The series is based on animated shorts by Alex Orrelle and J. P. Vine (Ron's Gone Wrong, Inside Out, The Good Dinosaur).\n\n\"We here at The Jim Henson Company have a special affinity for wild, subversive, and hilarious animal characters that both resonate with kid audiences and inspire them to leap outside their comfort zones to embrace new experiences,\" said Halle Stanford, President of Television at The Jim Henson Company. \"Adrenaline Lemmings allows us to branch out in older kids' animation with an exciting live action/CG hybrid look and do 'daring' physical character comedy for kids, in the tradition of some of our company's best-known productions.\"\n\n\"It was a childhood dream of mine to work with The Jim Henson Company, and as an adult it has been a goal of mine to work with Halle Stanford and her team. I'm so happy that the Lemmings have made it happen. I believe that our band of radical Lemmings will reach the hearts of kids all over the world,\" said Turgeman, who is also President of The Operating Room. \"We are thrilled to collaborate with The Jim Henson Company on Adrenaline Lemmings and look forward to turning these daring and quirky characters into a successful franchise together,\" added Roby Freireich, Founder and Partner of The Operating Room.\n\nAdrenaline Lemmings is a co-production of The Jim Henson Company and The Operating Room, with Lisa Henson and Halle Stanford executive producing for The Jim Henson Company, and Oded Turgeman and Roby Freireich for The Operating Room.
