        "text": "The Licensing Expo is the largest, most influential licensing trade show in the world.\n\nFor over 35 years, the Licensing Expo has connected the world’s biggest and most influential brands from the entertainment, apparel and fashion, art and design, publishing and gaming industries with manufacturers, licensees and retailers to foster licensing deals and help bring new products to life.\n\nThousands of major brands have earned their start in licensing at this show, which is held annually in Las Vegas.\n\nThe Jim Henson Company, a globally recognized brand in family entertainment, has looked to Absolute Exhibits for the past two years to design and build their custom exhibit rental at the Licensing Expo.\n\nConcept and Design\n\nBest known as creators of the world famous Muppets, The Jim Henson Company has remained an established leader in family entertainment for 60 years and is recognized worldwide as an innovator in puppetry, animatronics and digital animation.\n\nThe Jim Henson Company’s primary objective for Licensing Expo was to have a dominant presence on the trade show floor with unobstructed visibility to everyone and attract attendees with larger-than-life graphics and strategically placed product.\n\nOur team designed and fabricated the 20 x 30 foot custom island exhibit to incorporate large graphic branding, various lighting elements, multiple monitors showing new content, shelving and displays for new product lines, a hanging sign and multiple meeting areas.\n\n“Katie was heavily involved throughout the entire design process,” said Michael Pino, Senior Account Executive at Absolute Exhibits. “Her deep understanding of the company’s goals and attention to detail made her contributions incredibly valuable.”\n\nFrosted glass panels provided semi-private meeting spaces and high-resolution vinyl logos and front-lit graphics covered booth walls.\n\nA stacked tower display featured glass shelves to display new products and was topped with a backlit logo graphic.\n\nResults\n\nThe Jim Henson Company’s custom trade show booth design was clean, modern, aesthetically pleasing and functional for their specific needs.\n\nThe open footprint and large hanging sign increased the booth’s visibility and allowed for traffic to flow smoothly. Multiple meeting spaces also allowed booth staff to conduct scheduled and impromptu meetings at any time.\n\n“I have worked with Absolute Exhibits for two years in a row and each time has been a real pleasure,” said Katie Shaw, Global Consumer Products at The Jim Henson Company.\n\nFrom the booth design to graphics delivery and the finished product, it has been a smooth and easy process.\n\nOne of my main priorities in choosing a booth vendor was having accessible communication with the vendor. Every step of the way, the Project Managers were able to answer any questions or concerns I had in a timely manner.\n\nI would definitely recommend Absolute Exhibits to help make for a positive convention experience.”\n\nMichael Pino had the following to say:\n\n“Working with Katie and The Jim Henson Company has been such a pleasure. I appreciate the opportunity to provide them with the best product and service possible and I look forward to assisting them at next year’s show.”"
