        "text": "<strong>An</strong> <strong>Interview</strong> <strong>with</strong> <strong>Lisa</strong> <strong>Henson</strong> - <strong>2005</strong>1. How does the <strong>Company</strong>’s prolific history and – more specifically – <strong>Jim</strong> <strong>Henson</strong>’s legacy influence the choicesmade about management and new production?We have paid a lot of attention to taking care of <strong>Jim</strong> <strong>Henson</strong>’s legacy and the company itself is the most concretepart of that legacy. This is the company that he ran, and if somebody else were to come in and be assigned to bethe chairman of <strong>The</strong> <strong>Jim</strong> <strong>Henson</strong> <strong>Company</strong> and none of us were involved -well, I know it could happen, and we mayall think it’s a great idea in five or ten years, but right now I can’t even imagine, because its been such a closely heldcompany for all this time.Yet we don’t think of our job as just about history and the past. We try as hard as we can to make it about the newwork here, and the responsibility sits comfortably on our shoulders that the new work is going to fit <strong>with</strong> the oldwork. We don’t second guess ourselves or wonder if what we’re doing works for <strong>The</strong> <strong>Jim</strong> <strong>Henson</strong> <strong>Company</strong> becausewe know that it does. Unconsciously, I think both Brian and I as well as our siblings have a very natural understand ofwhat fits, what doesn’t fit, what would have been exciting for <strong>Jim</strong> <strong>Henson</strong> if he were alive today. <strong>The</strong>re isn’t a lot of‘What would <strong>Jim</strong> do’? <strong>The</strong>re is a balance between respecting where the company came from but understanding thatit’s moving forward.<strong>An</strong>d questions do come up sometimes. Like <strong>with</strong> computer animation. Why are the creators of the Muppets, <strong>The</strong> <strong>Jim</strong><strong>Henson</strong> <strong>Company</strong>, switching partially from puppetry to animation? Are we just being trendy? <strong>The</strong> truth is that thereis a historical interest in this area going all the way back to my father’s specific articulation of his desire to puppeteerCG characters. <strong>An</strong>d after years of research, he executed that vision in the MuppetVision 3*D movie at Disneyworld<strong>with</strong> the Waldo character. <strong>The</strong> puppeteered animation that we now do is really something that I believe he wouldhave accomplished over time through his intense desire to produce in that medium. It was something he fully envisionedbut the technology wasn’t entirely there for it yet.<strong>The</strong> company has continued to develop his idea, continued to plug away at it for visual effects, commercials andvideo games. <strong>An</strong>d now finally we have the <strong>Henson</strong> Digital Performance System that can puppeteer CG characters inreal time for television and film, for fully animated shows. But the theory of it was, I believe, completely articulatedby <strong>Jim</strong>. He was so interested in what was still to come in terms of technology. I spent weeks talking to him about interactivetechnology - trying to produce interactive programs at a time when it could not be done. His vision of whatthe company should be doing was extremely modern and futuristic and we are now using the exact the technologicalcapabilities right now that he wanted to have in 1989.2. With the <strong>Company</strong> currently celebrating its 50 th year, what do you see in the future for <strong>The</strong> <strong>Jim</strong> <strong>Henson</strong><strong>Company</strong> in the next 50 years, especially given the recent franchise sales?I think that the creation of the Bear in the Big Blue House franchise is a good model of how something original thatis not Muppets, that uses all the best of <strong>The</strong> <strong>Jim</strong> <strong>Henson</strong> <strong>Company</strong>’s talent in development, in performance and indesign, can take off pretty quickly. So our hope would be to not only work <strong>with</strong> the old franchises, but put a lot ofour efforts into developing new franchises, like Frances, based on the Russell Hoban books. Since these books areso well-known, like Bread and Jam for Frances and Bedtime for Frances, we think she and her family are an incrediblefranchise for the future. It’s a preschool property that Alex Rockwell is working on <strong>with</strong> Brian and a lot of familiar<strong>Henson</strong> faces are involved <strong>with</strong> it behind the scenes. What it looks like on the surface is animation, which is a wholedifferent way for us to watch new characters. But it is our puppeteered animation and uses all puppeteer talent forvoices and performance.In development we’re focusing on just two areas which are family entertainment and fantasty/sci-fi. But in all mediaand whether it be in puppetry, animation or live action, the focus will be on fun, innovative entertainment. People"
