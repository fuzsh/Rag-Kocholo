        "text": "Puppeteers of America is a national non-profit organization founded in 1937 to provide information, encourage performances, and build a community of people who celebrate puppet theatre. We support puppeteers and advance the art of puppetry by presenting knowledge, providing inspiration and promoting preservation. Knowledge. Inspiration. Preservation.\n\nThe specific purpose of Puppeteers of America, Inc. is educational. To instruct the public and raise awareness about puppetry as a means of communication, an extension of human expression, and as a performing art. This includes teaching the community about the importance of puppetry as well as enhancing the proficiency of the Art of Puppetry, both professional and amateur, by publications, educational materials, workshops, forums, conventions, festivals, panels, lectures, advisory services, and all other means and methods.\n\nPuppeteers of America has produced over 160 national and regional festivals to celebrate and share the art of puppetry. The organization publishes the quarterly magazine, The Puppetry Journal. Founded in 1949, The Puppetry Journal provides a continuing chronicle of contemporary puppetry.\n\nWe are proud that so many greats in the field like Jim Henson, Bil Baird, and Burr Tillstrom were active members providing leadership, advice and inspiration. We invite you to explore our website, learn more about this incredible art form, check out the benefits of membership, and join Puppeteers of America today.\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nEvery year members of Puppeteers of America have the opportunity to vote for three Board Members. Nine Board of Directors have the responsibility, along with Appointed Officers, to direct all policies and business of Puppeteers of America Inc. Every year after the new Board Members are elected, the nine Board of Directors choose one member to be President, Vice-President, Treasurer, and Secretary. The Board of Directors meet during the summer at a festival for the annual membership meeting, and they meet during the year by telephone/video conference call. Each year the Board of Directors approve a projected budget for the organization and approve budgets and staff for all national and regional festivals. The Board of Directors also approve the choice of all Appointed Officers. In 2020 and during 2021, the board was temporarily expanded to eleven Directors to support the organization in its COVID-19 response and related member support initiatives."
