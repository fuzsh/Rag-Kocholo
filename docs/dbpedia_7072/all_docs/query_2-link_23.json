In this presentation you will learn about the 4 main dimensions of Ikigai which are also believed to be the main reason for longevity of the people in Okinawa. In his latest book Frank Brueck transferred this ancient Asian concept to modern business and developed a model that helps leaders to find their way towards their own purpose in life. Find out which of 8 different leader types you belong to and how to develop towards your own Ikigai. Most importantly you can’t achieve it on your own, you will always need to consider how to integrate “What the World Needs” in what you do. Embracing the concept of Ikigai in your work will change what type of leader you already are – or you want to become. Although the term Ikigai is mostly used on an individual level only, you will learn that it can be applied a collective organisational level as well - with 8 different Ikigai Business Types.\n\nReference: Brueck, Frank (2020): IKIGAI for Leaders and Organisations – the way to individual and collective purpose and meaning.
