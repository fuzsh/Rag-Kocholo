        "text": "SAUGERTIES (AP) – John Henson, the son of the late Muppets creator Jim Henson, has died. He was 48.\n\nCheryl Henson said her brother died of a “massive heart attack” at his home in Saugerties on Friday. She said it happened after he had been building an igloo in the snow with his daughter.\n\nHenson followed in his famous father’s footsteps as a puppeteer, performing as Sweetums the ogre in several films, including “Muppet Treasure Island” and “It’s a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie.” He was also a shareholder and board member of the Jim Henson Company.\n\n“It is with great sadness that we confirm that John Henson, son of Jim and Jane Henson and brother to Lisa, Cheryl, Brian and Heather, died at age 48 of a sudden massive heart attack on Friday, February 14, while at home with his daughter,” the company said on its Facebook page.\n\n“John served as a shareholder and board member of The Jim Henson Company,” the company said. “He leaves two daughters, Katrina (15) and Sydney (10) and his wife Gyongyi. A private service is being planned.”\n\nHenson’s father, who started his television career as a puppeteer in 1954, died at 53 in 1990, according to the website Henson.com. His mother, Jane Nebel Henson, with who his father had created the Muppets in the early 1960s, a cast of characters for Sesame Street and later the Muppet Show, died last year at 78."
