        "text": "The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, a prequel series to the Jim Henson Company‘s groundbreaking 1982 feature The Dark Crystal, has landed at Netflix, with shooting slated to begin this fall. Feature helmer Louis Leterrier (Now You See Me, The Incredible Hulk) will executive produce the series and direct. Watch a teaser above.\n\nThe 10-episode fantasy adventure series takes place many years before the events of the film. The series will be shot in the UK and will star an ensemble of fantastical, state-of-the-art creatures created by Jim Henson’s Creature Shop and Brian Froud, the original feature’s conceptual designer.\n\nThe Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance will be a Netflix original series produced by the Jim Henson Company and executive produced by Letterier, Lisa Henson and Halle Stanford. Longtime Henson collaborator Rita Peruggi will serve as producer and Henson’s Blanca Lista will serve as a co-executive producer. Leading the writing are co-executive producers Jeffrey Addiss and Will Matthews (Life in a Year), and Javier Grillo-Marxuach (Lost, The 100).\n\n“The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance will combine the art of puppetry perfected by the Jim Henson Company, with Louis’ vision, powerful storytelling and a mix of cutting-edge digital imagery and visual effects,” said Cindy Holland, VP Original Content at Netflix. “I can’t wait for families around the world to see how we bring these unique characters to life.”\n\nSaid Lisa Henson, CEO of the Jim Henson Company: “Louis Leterrier is passionate about the world of The Dark Crystal and has an incredible creative vision for the series. He brings this passion to every facet of the production as he leads the talented team of artists and writers that are bringing this entire universe to life. Netflix has a deep respect for my father’s original work and the many people it inspired. They are the perfect partners to create this next epic chapter in The Dark Crystal story for new fans and the loyal fans who have waited so long for more adventures from this world.”"
