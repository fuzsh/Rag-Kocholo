        "text": "From their balcony seats, even the irascible Statler and Waldorf characters might like this news.\n\nThree years after selling the Jim Henson Company and its Muppets to a German media company for $680 million, Mr. Henson's family said yesterday that it was buying it back for a fraction of that amount.\n\nThe deal, valued at $89 million in cash and assets, gives the children of Mr. Henson, who died in 1990 at age 53, control of the company behind what is perhaps the most famous troupe of puppets in history.\n\nThe sale of the Jim Henson Company, which is based in Hollywood, by EM.TV and Merchandising of Munich is expected to be approved by United States and international regulators. All five of Mr. Henson's children are to have seats on the board.\n\n''We, as the five of us, did own and operate the company for 10 years, and we're enthusiastic about owning and operating it again,'' said Brian Henson, who with his sister Lisa, the head of Jim Henson Pictures, will serve in ''undetermined'' management positions.\n\nJim Henson's puppet creations first appeared on television in 1954. He once said in an interview that he modeled Kermit after himself, only the frog was ''a little snarkier.''\n\nAt the time of the Henson family's 2000 sale to EM.TV, then a highflying company that was a star of the New Market in Frankfurt before its stock crashed, there was hope that EM.TV's resources would allow the Muppets brand to expand even more, providing the backing for movies, television shows and other products. But after a year of ownership, EM.TV started trying to sell the rights to the Muppets to repay debt incurred in other ventures.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
