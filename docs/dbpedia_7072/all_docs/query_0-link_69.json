Krzykowski (“The Man Who Killed Hitler”) directs from the screenplay he adapted from John Gardner’s novel. Palisades Park Pictures, led by CEO Tamara Birkemoe, is launching international sales ahead of Cannes on the story of the legendary monster at the heart of the Beowulf epic poem who steps forward to tell his side of the tale.\n\nProduction is set to begin later this year in Europe. Jim Henson’s Creature Shop will handle practical creature work and design.\n\n“Grendel” is produced by Brian Henson and Vince Raisa for the Jim Henson Company, Krzykowski and Jay Glazer, who acquired the rights to the novel in 2020, Dennis Berardi and Jon D.

And we are most inspired when a character has a richly authentic personality, and can be sophisticated, thought-provoking, and believable. Grendel is the ultimate character, and will be brought to life using our Creature Shop’s cutting-edge practical techniques in combination with Dennis Berardi’s amazing digital effects.”\n\nBridges is repped by CAA, MGMT Entertainment, Special Artists Agency and Hirsch Wallerstein Hayum Matlof & Fishman; Bautista is repped by CAA, Meisner Entertainment Group, and Jackoway Austen Tyerman Wertheimer Mandelbaum Morris Bernstein Trattner Auerbach Hynick Jaime LeVine Sample & Klein; Cranston is repped by UTA and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole; Elliott is repped The Gersh Agency and Berwick & Kovacik; McKenzie is repped by UTA, Untitled Entertainment, Gail Cowan Management and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole; Turner is repped by Curtis Brown Group and Lisa Richards, and Felker Toczek Suddleson Abramson McGinnis & Ryan; Burnett is repped by Larry Jenkins of LJ Entertainment.
