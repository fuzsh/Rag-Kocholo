        "text": "Craig Bartlett (Dinosaur Train, Hey Arnold!) Joins as Writer\n\nHOLLYWOOD, Calif., June 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Jim Henson Company (Fraggle Rock, Apple TV+; The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, Netflix) and Paramount's Ananey Studios (Greenhouse Academy, Netflix; Spell Keepers, HBO Europe; Spyders, Nickelodeon International; Craft Party, CBBC) are introducing \"climate hope\" with The Season Keepers, a new 2D animated series for kids ages 6-12 and their families.\n\nThis modern-day fairy tale is inspired by Vivaldi's Four Seasons and welcomes viewers to connect to nature through a fantastical story filled with magical creatures. Twins Lia and Ben find their world and family unraveling when their parents' divorce sends them to their grandmother's small village for what's sure to be a snooze-fest of a spring holiday. Little do they know, they've landed in the middle of an epic battle between the seasons, where Lia discovers her gift to mediate between humans and The Nature Makers—a realm of magical creatures who are the guardians of nature itself. Lia must harness newfound powers and solidify her sibling bond with Ben to mend family rifts, save their grandmother from an eternal slumber, and stop a group of vengeful Nature Makers from plunging the world into a perpetual winter.\n\nFrequent Henson collaborator Craig Bartlett (Dinosaur Train, Sid the Science Kid) is attached as writer for the development of the series.\n\n\"From the minute Hila, Gili, and Shirley shared with us Bosmat Agayoff's gorgeous designs for her creation The Season Keepers, we knew this was the next fantasy world we wanted to explore at The Jim Henson Company,\" said Halle Stanford, President of Television at The Jim Henson Company. \"At its heart, The Season Keepers is about the healing of a family and of the natural world around them. And this series about climate hope is wrapped up in a luxurious whimsical world filled with magical and never-before-seen creatures. To work with this extraordinary creative team from Israel is an honor; and then handing the story reigns over to Craig Bartlett ensures this adventure will captivate kids for generations.\"\n\n\"We couldn't be more excited about joining forces with the legendary Jim Henson Company, responsible for some of the most loved and known kids shows. In this modern-day animated fairytale, a breathtaking journey will intertwine magic, adventure, and heart to inspire young viewers everywhere,\" said Orly Atlas-Katz, CEO Ananey Paramount & EVP Paramount Israel\n\nThe Season Keepers is created and designed by Bosmat Agayoff (Where is Anne Frank?, Barbie Dreamtopia).
