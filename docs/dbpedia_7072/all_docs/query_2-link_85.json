(Nasdaq:RHAT), the world's premier open source and Linux provider, today announced that Jim Henson's Creature ShopÃƒâeuro is using the Red Hat Linux operating system to power its award-winning Henson Digital Performance Studio (HDPS) and other digital design projects.\"Red Hat has provided the Creature Shop with a highly functional, easy-to-use operating system that also happens to be the production industry's de facto standard,\" said Steve Rosenbluth, control systems designer at Jim Henson's Creature Shop. \"In addition, we had no idea how much time we could save on management until we began using Red Hat Network. Now we spend our time getting work done rather than trying to get our systems and applications to work.\"With HDPS, the Academy Award-winning Jim Henson's Creature Shop has created the next generation of puppetry and computer graphics -- a system that makes a digital character as instantly performable as a puppet. The Company uses Red Hat Linux as the operating system on both the HDPS and the animatronic Henson Performance Control System (HPCS).In addition, Red Hat Network is utilized for crucial updates and management, and commercial applications certified on Red Hat Linux for its design needs. With Red Hat Linux powering its systems, Jim Henson's Creature Shop has completed successful design and performance work for major motion pictures, video games, Web events and other projects.\"Jim Henson's Creature Shop is changing the way digital production works, so it makes perfect sense that Red Hat Linux would be at the base of their innovative systems,\" said Mark de Visser, vice president of marketing at Red Hat. \"We're thrilled that the company which brought us Kermit and Ms. Piggy is using Red Hat technology, and we're glad to be part of this growing trend within the digital production industry.\"The HDPS was awarded the 2001 Computerworld Honors 21st Century Achievement Award for Media, Arts and Entertainment.
