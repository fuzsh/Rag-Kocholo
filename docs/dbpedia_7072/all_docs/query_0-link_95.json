        "text": "There's Bert and Ernie, Big Bird, Miss Piggy and the Cookie Monster.\n\nAnd, of course, there's Kermit the Frog.\n\nBut \"Jim Henson's Fantastic World,\" which opened Saturday and runs through May 12 at Lakeview Museum has much, much more: a collection of more than 100 storyboards, drawings, sketches and cartoons; photographs of Henson and his fellow creators at work; excerpts from early commercials as well as selections from video productions and experimental films.\n\nEach colorful detail, each artifact - like the display under glass of make-believe primitive tools used in Henson's film \"The Dark Crystal\" - add up to a picture of a man that's a little different from the way the master puppeteer is usually depicted.\n\nMore than a creator of the Muppets, however memorable, Henson was really something else: An artist engaged in a perpetual improvisation with technology, first in the form of television, later in the form of computer animation.\n\nAlthough Henson never lived to see the Internet, social media and blogging — he died in 1990 at the age of 53 from an infection-related organ failure — he is a figure who somehow seems to belong as much to the 21st century as to the 20th century.\n\n\"No question — Jim was very forward thinking and very interested in any developing technology,\" said Karen Falk, director of archives for the Jim Henson Company. She sits on the board of the Jim Henson Legacy and also curated the current exhibit.\n\n\"Television, to begin with,\" Falk continued. \"That was how he got into puppetry in the first place. But he was always on the cutting edge of whatever was happening. He was doing computer animation as early as 1970 for 'Sesame Street.' He had created a digital character that was performed using puppetry, using a motion capture system, in the late 1980s, for the Muppet Vision 3-DI movie at Walt Disney World. And that's the technology we've developed further, that we use in our program 'Sid the Science Kid,' which is on PBS Kids, and that's a motion capture, digital animation system. That was all long before Avatar, obviously.\"\n\nHad Henson lived long enough to embrace current technology, there's no doubt to what he would have done, Falk said.\n\n\"In fact, right before he died, he did a pilot for a show called 'Handmade Television,' \" Falk said. \"It was when the Sony Handicams first came out — the really small, hand-held video cameras. He saw citizen filmmakers out there making spontaneous entertainment. And he sent these guys out around the country with video cameras to make video. He didn't end up producing a show out of it, but the idea was very much a YouTube predecessor.\"\n\nThe Jim Henson Legacy, which together with Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibit, was begun after Henson's death in 1990 by his wife, Jane Henson. The exhibit last appeared at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry.\n\n\"The exhibit has been at various locations now,\" Jane Henson said. \"We've been really pleased at how many people have wanted to see it. We really didn't know if people would be interested in how Jim developed his work over the years. The crowds have been very good. I hope it does well in Peoria.\"\n\nOrganized chronologically and by theme, the exhibit describes Henson's early days at the University of Maryland, where he met his wife in a puppetry class and on the set of \"Sam and Friends,\" a five minute show that aired live on WRC-TV in Washington, D.C., in 1955. The show made Henson into a national figure, with appearances on \"The Arthur Godfrey Show,\" \"The Tonight Show\" and \"The Will Rogers, Jr. Show.\"\n\nIn many ways, the show prefigured \"Sesame Street.\" So did Henson's tongue-in-cheek television commercials for Wilkins Coffee and other products. Henson realized that, on television, closeups were possible, so his puppets were designed to change expression - a departure from what puppets had been earlier, Falk said.\n\nAlthough the exhibit looks at \"Sesame Street,\" \"The Muppet Show,\" \"Fraggle Rock,\" and the 1982 movie \"The Dark Crystal,\" it also includes some oddities. Among them is \"Time Piece,\" an eight-minute funny, dreamlike film about a man — played by Henson — who becomes unstuck in time, engaging in such antics as leaping off of a diving board and sprouting mechanical wings.\n\nIt's a movie where anything seems possible and seems to sum up Henson's philosophy.\n\n\"I believe we form our own lives, that we create our own reality and that everything works out for the best,\" Henson once said. \"I know I drive some people crazy with what seems like ridiculous optimism, but it has always worked out for me.\"\n\nGary Panetta can be reached at 686-3132 or gpanetta@pjstar.com.\n\n'Jim Henson's Fantastic World'\n\n- What: Drawings, cartoons, storyboards, video clips and Muppets by Jim Henson.\n\n- When: Through May 1.\n\n- Where: Lakeview Museum of Arts and Sciences.\n\n- Tickets: The museum gallery and store hours are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday; noon to 4 p.m. Sunday.
