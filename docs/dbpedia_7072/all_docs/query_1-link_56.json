        "text": "As part of the 2018 Spring Puppet Forum Series, the Ballard Institute and Museum of Puppetry at the University of Connecticut will present a discussion with Cheryl Henson, Leslee Asch, Lindsey âZâ Briggs, and Richard Termine titled Nurturing New Work for Puppet Theater: The Jim Henson Foundation on Thursday, Feb. 8, 2018 at 7 p.m. in the Ballard Institute Theater, located at 1 Royce Circle in Storrs Center.\n\nJoin Jim Henson Foundation President Cheryl Henson, board members Leslee Asch and Richard Termine (a Puppet Arts Program alumnus), and foundation manager Lindsey âZâ Briggs (also a Puppet Arts alumna) in a discussion about the foundation’s dynamic methods of supporting innovative new puppet productions across the United States.\n\nThe Jim Henson Foundation was founded in 1982 by Muppets creator Jim Henson to promote and develop the art of puppetry in the United States. Each year the Foundation introduces thousands of adults and families to the magic of puppet theater through grant-making and public awareness efforts. Since its inception, the Foundation has awarded over 900 grants to more than 300 American puppet artists for the creation and development of new work. As the only grant-making institution with a mission to promote puppetry in the United States, The Jim Henson Foundation has become a major advocate and resource for puppet artists.\n\nCheryl Henson is the President of The Jim Henson Foundation and a member of the Board of Directors of The Jim Henson Company. Cheryl was Executive Producer for the Henson International Festival of Puppet Theater.\n\nLeslee Asch has been a member of the Board of Directors of The Jim Henson Foundation since 1984. Leslee was Producing Director for the Henson International Festival of Puppet Theater.\n\nLindsey âZâ Briggs is the Foundation Manager of The Jim Henson Foundation, Co-Artistic Director of WonderSpark Puppets, and has been working as a professional puppeteer since 2004.\n\nRichard Termine has served as a trustee of The Jim Henson Foundation since 1987 and is currently its Vice President. He worked as a puppet designer and builder for The Jim Henson Company, and is currently a performing arts photographer who has photographed many of the worldâs leading performers and puppet artists.\n\nAdmission to this event is free (donations greatly appreciated!), and refreshments will be served. Come early, and experience our puppet exhibitions, as well as the video resources in our library nook. Visitors can park in the Storrs Center Garage located at 33 Royce Circle. Parking in the Storrs Center Garage is free for the first two hours and $1 per hour thereafter, with a daily maximum charge of $8. Forums will be broadcast via Facebook Live.
