        "text": "Jay Leno said his wife, Mavis Leno, is “doing well” after being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n“She’s fine. Everybody’s good. We’re doing well,” the former “Tonight Show” host told the Daily Mail Sunday while driving with a few friends.\n\nJay, 73, explained that he filed for a conservatorship over Mavis, 77, to “set up a will, in case something happens.”\n\nHe gave a thumbs-up to the cameraman as he drove away.\n\nMavis has not commented publicly on her diagnosis.\n\nIn court documents previously obtained by Page Six, Jay stated he was making the request to ensure Mavis was taken care of should he predecease her.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n“Jay is fully capable of continuing his support for Mavis’s physical and financial needs as he has throughout their marriage,” the documents stated.\n\n“Jay desires to execute an estate plan, including a revocable trust and will, which will provide for Mavis and Mavis’s brother and her sole living heir aside from Jay.”\n\nThe diagnosis hasn’t stopped the longtime couple from living their lives, as the stand-up comedian enjoyed a night out on the town just a couple of days after his conservatorship filing.\n\nJay brought his forever plus-one with him to his comedy show Sunday night at The Comedy & Magic Club in Hermosa Beach, Calif.\n\nPhotos obtained by Page Six show the pair standing outside of the club interacting with a couple of friends before a driver assists the philanthropist with her purse and helps her into the front seat of a waiting car.\n\nThe “Jay Leno’s Garage” star also made a solo outing over the weekend, but he appeared more somber while meeting with a few men near the airport.\n\nJay and Mavis have been married since 1980. They have no children."
