        "text": "Jay Leno has been declared the conservator of wife Mavis Leno’s estate amid the philanthropist’s battle with dementia.\n\nLeno, who filed his petition for the conservatorship in Los Angeles court in January, had his request granted during a hearing Tuesday, according to court documents obtained by USA TODAY.\n\n“The court finds from clear and convincing evidence that a conservatorship of the estate is necessary and appropriate in that (Mavis Leno) is unable to care for her financial affairs and is subject to undue influence,” the minute order read. “The conservatorship is the least restrictive alternative needed for the protection of (Mavis).”\n\nMavis consented to the ruling and did not “object to the conservatorship of the estate,” per the filing.\n\n“Everything you’re doing is right,” Judge Brenda J. Penny told Leno in court, according to People magazine. “I totally understand this is a difficult period.”\n\nLeno shared during the hearing that he is in the process of estate planning and reviewing Mavis’ will, the magazine reported.\n\nMavis' court-appointed attorney Ronald E. Ostrin had no comment when contacted by USA TODAY following the ruling. USA TODAY has reached out to a representative for Leno for comment.\n\nJay Leno petitions to be conservator of wife’s estate after dementia diagnosis\n\nIn January, Leno petitioned the L.A. court to become the conservator of wife Mavis’ estate to ensure her estate plan is correctly executed because she \"presently lacks the necessary capacity,\" according to court documents obtained by USA TODAY at the time. Leno did not seek conservatorship over his wife's person.\n\nMavis, 77, \"suffers from dementia, major neurocognitive disorder,\" her physician wrote in a doctor's capacity declaration, which also outlined the decline of her cognitive function.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Mavis has been progressively losing capacity and orientation to space and time for several years,\" according to the filing.\n\nLeno’s filing also stated the comedian's wish to manage Mavis' half of their shared property and her assets in a trust, which would provide for her, her brother and Leno. The couple does not have children, and she has no other siblings.\n\nBackground: Jay Leno petitions to be conservator of wife Mavis' estate after her dementia diagnosis\n\nMavis Leno 'sometimes does not know' husband Jay Leno amid dementia battle\n\nMore light was shed on the extent of Mavis’ battle with dementia when Ostrin shared additional information about her condition in court documents filed in California in March.\n\n\"According to her neurologist, Dr. Hart Cohen, (Mavis Leno) has advanced dementia (and) sometimes does not know her husband, Jay, nor her date of birth,\" according to the filing obtained by USA TODAY. \"She has a lot of disorientation, will ruminate about her parents who have both passed and her mother who died about 20 years ago.\"\n\nOstrin also said he interviewed Mavis in February and concluded that \"although it was clear she had cognitive impairment, she still has a charming personality and could communicate.\" During this time, she \"reposed great faith and confidence in\" her husband.\n\nMavis Leno: Jay Leno's wife 'sometimes does not know' him amid dementia battle\n\n\"According to Dr. Cohen, Mr. Leno loves his wife very much, and waited to bring this matter out of respect to her,\" Ostrin wrote in the filing. \"He said that Mr. Leno was 'such a nice man and treats (Mavis) like gold.'\"\n\nOstrin recommended that Leno’s conservatorship petition be approved, concluding that the TV host’s actions are \"necessary\" for his and Mavis' protection.\n\nContributing: Naledi Ushe and Brendan Morrow, USA TODAY"
