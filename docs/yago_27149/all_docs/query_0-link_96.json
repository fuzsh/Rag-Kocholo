        "text": "Jay Leno’s lawyer has shared updated information regarding the health of the comedian’s wife, Mavis Leno. Two months after filing for conservatorship over Mavis’ estate , new information is coming to light.\n\nThe decision to file for conservatorship comes after Mavis was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, a disease that causes “a slow decline in memory, thinking and reasoning skills.”\n\nAnd now, a new filing by Jay’s lawyers revealed Mavis’ mental acuity has gotten worse.\n\nIn the new filing obtained by People, it revealed that Mavis “sometimes does not know her husband, Jay, nor her date of birth.” The filing went on to say that Mavis “has a lot of disorientation, will ruminate about her parents who have both passed and her mother who died about 20 years ago.”\n\nHowever, regardless of her health battle, the filing says Mavis is still a “delightful person” with a “charming personality.”\n\nThe filing also refers to Mavis and Jay’s 44-year marriage, saying despite her memory loss, their marriage is still “long-term, loving and supportive,” adding that Jay remains “her protector and she trusts him.” People reports that Mavis’ neurologist is also quoted in the filing, saying Jay is “such a nice man and treats [Mavis] like gold.”\n\nThe filing adds that Mavis “does not object” and “consents” to the conservatorship, according to People.\n\nJust a month before filing for conservatorship over his wife’s estate, Jay Leno talked about being married to Mavis for 44 years in an interview with Piers Morgan.\n\nTMZ also reported that just days after filing for conservatorship, the husband and wife were seen out in Hollywood. Jay had a comedy show to perform and Mavis was right by his side."
