        "text": "Jay Leno’s wife, Mavis Leno, “sometimes does not know her husband […] nor her date of birth” amid her battle with Alzheimer’s disease, according to a new report related to the comedian’s conservatorship petition.\n\nPer the documents obtained by Page Six, her court-appointed counsel, Ronald Ostrin, revealed that, despite remaining in good spirits amid her “advanced dementia” diagnosis, her health continues to decline.\n\nAccording to her neurologist, Dr. Hart Cohen, the 77-year-old “has a lot of disorientation” and often ruminates “about her parents who have both passed.”\n\nDespite having clear “cognitive impairment,” Ostrin described Mavis as “a delightful person” with “a charming personality” who still can “communicate.”\n\n“She expressed a desire to vote and told me a little about her philanthropic work,” he said of their meeting. “She reposed great faith and confidence in Mr. Leno and relied on him for her protection and guidance.”\n\nAs for the couple’s dynamic, Ostrin said it’s clear that Jay and Mavis “have a long-term, loving and supportive relationship” with plenty of “resources” to give the former a “safe and least restrictive environment.”\n\n“Ms. Leno seemed very happy in their cozy environment,” Ostrin noted.\n\nIn terms of Jay’s conservatorship filing, Ostrin noted that Mavis “does not object” but rather “consents to it” and “wants” it, which is why he formally recommended that it be approved.\n\nJay, 73, filed for the conservatorship in January to set up a living trust for Mavis in case anything happened to him amid her own health issues.\n\nIn the new filing, Cohen explained that Jay “loves his wife very much” and waited to file the conservatorship until he felt it was necessary “out of respect to her.”\n\nAccording to the neurologist, Jay is “such a nice man and treats [Mavis] like gold.”\n\n“Based on my interaction with Mr. Leno, plus some research I have done, he seems to be a standup guy,” Ostrin doubled down. “And his private persona matches the public persona he projects.”\n\nThe former “Tonight Show” host explained to the Daily Mail in January that he filed for a conservatorship over the estate to “set up a will, in case something happens.”\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nHowever, he assured the outlet that his wife — whom he was spotted out on a date with just days prior — was “doing well.”\n\n“She’s fine. Everybody’s good. We’re doing well,” he said.\n\nThe couple wed in 1980 and share no children.\n\nIt is not clear when Mavis was diagnosed with the disease. A hearing for the conservatorship is set for April 9."
