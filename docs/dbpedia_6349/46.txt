Discover the Artistic Treasures of Staatsgalerie Stuttgart

Located in the heart of Stuttgart, Germany, the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart is a must-visit destination for art enthusiasts. This renowned art museum has a rich history dating back to its opening in 1843. However, it was the addition of the Neue Staatsgalerie in 1984 that truly transformed it into one of Europe's leading museums.

A Historical Gem

The Staatsgalerie Stuttgart is housed in two distinct buildings. The Alte Staatsgalerie, originally built in 1843, was severely damaged during World War II but was lovingly restored and reopened in 1948. This classicist building was not only a gallery but also served as the home of the Royal Art School.

The Architectural Marvel

The highlight of the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart is undoubtedly the Neue Staatsgalerie, designed by the renowned architect James Stirling. This architectural masterpiece, opened in 1984, is a sight to behold. Its unique design, with a series of connected galleries surrounding a central rotunda, is reminiscent of Schinkel's Altes Museum in Berlin.

A World-Class Art Collection

Step inside the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, and you'll be greeted by an impressive collection of art spanning centuries. The museum's collection includes works by renowned artists such as Pablo Picasso, Oskar Schlemmer, Joan Miró, and Joseph Beuys.
