        "text": "“Architecture is a thoughtful making of space” -- Louis I. Kahn If theories are a set of systems or suppositions that undergird how a certain thing operates, the theory of architecture, according to the architect Louis I. Kahn, must entail a thoughtful making of space. So, what then constitutes a “thoughtful making of space?” And a thoughtful making of space for whom? Many scholars, architects and thinkers have been trying to answer this question. The fundamental problem with answering this question lies in the nature of architecture as a “practical” rather than a theoretical discipline. What does it mean for space to be thoughtfully made – comfort, function, and aesthetics? All of these qualities are not merely architectural: Comfortable buildings can be designed by engineers who understand conventional and artificial ventilation; in a similar way, aesthetic edifices only need to be designed by those trained in the fine arts of composition and motif replication. Is there mere theory of architecture? It is an accepted norm that architects “make” things -- buildings, spaces, landscapes; yet, the difference between “simply making something” and “thoughtfully making something” is enormous. Unlike the natural sciences or mathematics, architectural can hardly be undergirded, explained, or experienced by a set of fixed ideas or suppositions. As the historian and theorist Stanford Anderson argues, architecture is “quasi-autonomous,” which may explain why any attempts to see architecture as something else often, if not always, fail. The prime example being that any architectural approaches that end, stylistically, with “-ism,” such as modernism, postmodernism, deconstructionism, to name a few. In this course, we will focus on this very quasi-autonomous quality of architecture in its capacity to “make space” thoughtfully.” In the spirit of skepticism, we will investigate the claims that (a) architectural theory exists and (b) the central elements of such claims are humans and their social relations. By oscillating between reading closely related ideas and oppositional ideas, students will be exposed to a selected range of concepts developed by philosophers, historians, and social theorists in their attempts to come to terms with what they believe to be architecture. These attempts are something we may call “architectural theory.” Chronologically, we will examine socio-cultural ideas in which architecture plays a role as either the source or the outcome. In this course, we will seek to understand architectural theory through the exploration of the economic, political, and cultural roles of architecture. Two sets of readings will be introduced for each topic: classic theoretical and philosophical writings, and writings specific to architecture.\n\nThis study explores the utilization of virtual reality (VR) in the field of architecture and Design, Virtual reality technology has had a transformative impact on architecture, revolutionizing the way buildings are designed, visualized, and experienced. VR enables architects to create immersive virtual environments that enhance design visualization and provide stakeholders with an accurate representation of the final product. The collaborative nature of VR facilitates effective communication among stakeholders, improves coordination, and actively involves clients in the design process but it is important to critically evaluate the claims made regarding its impact and potential benefits. While VR has undoubtedly brought changes to architecture, stating that it has revolutionized the entire design process may be an overstatement. The paper outlines several the future of VR in architecture holds immense potential including design visualization, collaborative design, client engagement, construction planning, and safety analysis. While these applications sound promising, it is important to consider the limitations and practicality of implementing VR in each of these areas. The effectiveness of VR in design visualization, for example, may depend on the quality and accuracy of the virtual environment, as well as the hardware and software used. The collaborative nature of VR is highlighted as a benefit, but it is necessary to recognize Suksrianusorn 1 that effective collaboration extends beyond virtual interactions. Non-verbal cues, physical presence, and in-person discussions play a significant role in understanding and resolving complex design issues. VR may also face challenges in terms of technological limitations, cost, and the need for specialized knowledge and training. While the advantages of VR in architecture are acknowledged, such as enhanced communication, improved decision-making, and exploration of innovative design solutions, it is crucial to approach its implementation with a critical mindset. VR should be considered as a tool among others in the design process, taking into account its limitations and the specific needs and goals of the architectural practice. VR has the potential to bring benefits to architecture, it is important to critically assess its impact and practicality. By understanding the limitations, addressing challenges, and integrating VR judiciously into the design process, architects can harness its potential and achieve meaningful transformations in architectural practice.\n\nThis article is now online at the website of the journal THE SIDE VIEW: https://thesideview.co/journal/finding-the-center/ In this article, I highlight American architect Christopher Alexander’s concept of “center,” which offers one way to identify the crux of his work, whether thinking or designing. Most broadly, a center is any spatial concentration or organized focus of more intense pattern or activity—for example, an intricate carpet pattern, an elegant entryway, a handsome arcade, a gracious building, or an animated plaza full of users finding pleasure in the place. Whatever its specific nature and scale, a center is a region of concentrated physical and experiential order that provides for an intense spatial and lived relatedness among things, people, situations, and events. A center is “an organized zone of space … which, because of its internal coherence, and because of its relation to context … forms a local zone of relative centeredness with respect to the other parts of space.\" A pivotal question for Alexander is how an understanding of centers might help architects to conceive of and actualize vigorous places and environments that sustain thriving human life."
