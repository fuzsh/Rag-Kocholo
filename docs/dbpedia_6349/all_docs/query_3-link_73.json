        "text": "Ten years ago this blog quoted Michael Crichton, a medic, a writer (Jurassic Park amongst others) and a thinker. A man who understands people and science, very well. Well, there is merit in just watching the passage of time. Endless climate catastrophe predictions prove to be wrong, and real wisdom acquires a patina of veracity. Which brings me back to Crichton (who died youngish – 66 – of lymphoma in 2008). Here is the full text of his speech from nearly 21 years ago, which is as astute and relevant now – even more so – than it was then. It’s a long post, but it’s worth it. It was given to the allegedly non-partisan Commonwealth Club of California.\n\nA very smart guy.\n\nI have been asked to talk about what I consider the most important challenge facing mankind, and I have a fundamental answer. The greatest challenge facing mankind is the challenge of distinguishing reality from fantasy, truth from propaganda. Perceiving the truth has always been a challenge to mankind, but in the information age (or as I think of it, the disinformation age) it takes on a special urgency and importance.\n\nWe must daily decide whether the threats we face are real, whether the solutions we are offered will do any good, whether the problems we’re told exist are in fact real problems, or non-problems. Every one of us has a sense of the world, and we all know that this sense is in part given to us by what other people and society tell us; in part generated by our emotional state, which we project outward; and in part by our genuine perceptions of reality. In short, our struggle to determine what is true is the struggle to decide which of our perceptions are genuine, and which are false because they are handed down, or sold to us, or generated by our own hopes and fears.\n\nAs an example of this challenge, I want to talk today about environmentalism. And in order not to be misunderstood, I want it perfectly clear that I believe it is incumbent on us to conduct our lives in a way that takes into account all the consequences of our actions, including the consequences to other people, and the consequences to the environment. I believe it is important to act in ways that are sympathetic to the environment, and I believe this will always be a need, carrying into the future. I believe the world has genuine problems and I believe it can and should be improved. But I also think that deciding what constitutes responsible action is immensely difficult, and the consequences of our actions are often difficult to know in advance. I think our past record of environmental action is discouraging, to put it mildly, because even our best intended efforts often go awry. But I think we do not recognize our past failures, and face them squarely. And I think I know why.\n\nI studied anthropology in college, and one of the things I learned was that certain human social structures always reappear. They can’t be eliminated from society. One of those structures is religion. Today it is said we live in a secular society in which many people—the best people, the most enlightened people—do not believe in any religion. But I think that you cannot eliminate religion from the psyche of mankind. If you suppress it in one form, it merely re-emerges in another form. You can not believe in God, but you still have to believe in something that gives meaning to your life, and shapes your sense of the world. Such a belief is religious.\n\nToday, one of the most powerful religions in the Western World is environmentalism. Environmentalism seems to be the religion of choice for urban atheists. Why do I say it’s a religion? Well, just look at the beliefs. If you look carefully, you see that environmentalism is in fact a perfect 21st century remapping of traditional Judeo-Christian beliefs and myths.\n\nThere’s an initial Eden, a paradise, a state of grace and unity with nature, there’s a fall from grace into a state of pollution as a result of eating from the tree of knowledge, and as a result of our actions there is a judgment day coming for us all. We are all energy sinners, doomed to die, unless we seek salvation, which is now called sustainability. Sustainability is salvation in the church of the environment. Just as organic food is its communion, that pesticide-free wafer that the right people with the right beliefs, imbibe.\n\nEden, the fall of man, the loss of grace, the coming doomsday—these are deeply held mythic structures. They are profoundly conservative beliefs. They may even be hard-wired in the brain, for all I know. I certainly don’t want to talk anybody out of them, as I don’t want to talk anybody out of a belief that Jesus Christ is the son of God who rose from the dead. But the reason I don’t want to talk anybody out of these beliefs is that I know that I can’t talk anybody out of them. These are not facts that can be argued. These are issues of faith.\n\nAnd so it is, sadly, with environmentalism. Increasingly it seems facts aren’t necessary, because the tenets of environmentalism are all about belief. It’s about whether you are going to be a sinner, or saved. Whether you are going to be one of the people on the side of salvation, or on the side of doom. Whether you are going to be one of us, or one of them.\n\nAm I exaggerating to make a point? I am afraid not. Because we know a lot more about the world than we did forty or fifty years ago. And what we know now is not so supportive of certain core environmental myths, yet the myths do not die. Let’s examine some of those beliefs.\n\nThere is no Eden. There never was. What was that Eden of the wonderful mythic past? Is it the time when infant mortality was 80%, when four children in five died of disease before the age of five? When one woman in six died in childbirth? When the average lifespan was 40, as it was in America a century ago. When plagues swept across the planet, killing millions in a stroke. Was it when millions starved to death? Is that when it was Eden?\n\nAnd what about indigenous peoples, living in a state of harmony with the Eden-like environment? Well, they never did. On this continent, the newly arrived people who crossed the land bridge almost immediately set about wiping out hundreds of species of large animals, and they did this several thousand years before the white man showed up, to accelerate the process. And what was the condition of life? Loving, peaceful, harmonious? Hardly: the early peoples of the New World lived in a state of constant warfare. Generations of hatred, tribal hatreds, constant battles. The warlike tribes of this continent are famous: the Comanche, Sioux, Apache, Mohawk, Aztecs, Toltec, Incas. Some of them practiced infanticide, and human sacrifice. And those tribes that were not fiercely warlike were exterminated, or learned to build their villages high in the cliffs to attain some measure of safety.\n\nHow about the human condition in the rest of the world? The Maori of New Zealand committed massacres regularly. The dyaks of Borneo were headhunters. The Polynesians, living in an environment as close to paradise as one can imagine, fought constantly, and created a society so hideously restrictive that you could lose your life if you stepped in the footprint of a chief. It was the Polynesians who gave us the very concept of taboo, as well as the word itself. The noble savage is a fantasy, and it was never true. That anyone still believes it, 200 years after Rousseau, shows the tenacity of religious myths, their ability to hang on in the face of centuries of factual contradiction.\n\nThere was even an academic movement, during the latter 20th century, that claimed that cannibalism was a white man’s invention to demonize the indigenous peoples. (Only academics could fight such a battle.) It was some thirty years before professors finally agreed that yes, cannibalism does indeed occur among human beings. Meanwhile, all during this time New Guinea highlanders in the 20th century continued to eat the brains of their enemies until they were finally made to understand that they risked kuru, a fatal neurological disease, when they did so.\n\nMore recently still the gentle Tasaday of the Philippines turned out to be a publicity stunt, a nonexistent tribe. And African pygmies have one of the highest murder rates on the planet.\n\nIn short, the romantic view of the natural world as a blissful Eden is only held by people who have no actual experience of nature. People who live in nature are not romantic about it at all. They may hold spiritual beliefs about the world around them, they may have a sense of the unity of nature or the aliveness of all things, but they still kill the animals and uproot the plants in order to eat, to live. If they don’t, they will die.\n\nAnd if you, even now, put yourself in nature even for a matter of days, you will quickly be disabused of all your romantic fantasies. Take a trek through the jungles of Borneo, and in short order you will have festering sores on your skin, you’ll have bugs all over your body, biting in your hair, crawling up your nose and into your ears, you’ll have infections and sickness and if you’re not with somebody who knows what they’re doing, you’ll quickly starve to death. But chances are that even in the jungles of Borneo you won’t experience nature so directly, because you will have covered your entire body with DEET and you will be doing everything you can to keep those bugs off you.\n\nThe truth is, almost nobody wants to experience real nature. What people want is to spend a week or two in a cabin in the woods, with screens on the windows. They want a simplified life for a while, without all their stuff. Or a nice river rafting trip for a few days, with somebody else doing the cooking. Nobody wants to go back to nature in any real way, and nobody does. It’s all talk-and as the years go on, and the world population grows increasingly urban, it’s uninformed talk. Farmers know what they’re talking about. City people don’t. It’s all fantasy.\n\nOne way to measure the prevalence of fantasy is to note the number of people who die because they haven’t the least knowledge of how nature really is. They stand beside wild animals, like buffalo, for a picture and get trampled to death; they climb a mountain in dicey weather without proper gear, and freeze to death. They drown in the surf on holiday because they can’t conceive the real power of what we blithely call “the force of nature.” They have seen the ocean. But they haven’t been in it.\n\nThe television generation expects nature to act the way they want it to be. They think all life experiences can be tivo-ed. The notion that the natural world obeys its own rules and doesn’t give a damn about your expectations comes as a massive shock. Well-to-do, educated people in an urban environment experience the ability to fashion their daily lives as they wish. They buy clothes that suit their taste, and decorate their apartments as they wish. Within limits, they can contrive a daily urban world that pleases them.\n\nBut the natural world is not so malleable. On the contrary, it will demand that you adapt to it-and if you don’t, you die. It is a harsh, powerful, and unforgiving world, that most urban westerners have never experienced.\n\nMany years ago I was trekking in the Karakorum mountains of northern Pakistan, when my group came to a river that we had to cross. It was a glacial river, freezing cold, and it was running very fast, but it wasn’t deep—maybe three feet at most. My guide set out ropes for people to hold as they crossed the river, and everybody proceeded, one at a time, with extreme care. I asked the guide what was the big deal about crossing a three-foot river. He said, well, supposing you fell and suffered a compound fracture. We were now four days trek from the last big town, where there was a radio. Even if the guide went back double time to get help, it’d still be at least three days before he could return with a helicopter. If a helicopter were available at all. And in three days, I’d probably be dead from my injuries. So that was why everybody was crossing carefully. Because out in nature a little slip could be deadly.\n\nBut let’s return to religion. If Eden is a fantasy that never existed, and mankind wasn’t ever noble and kind and loving, if we didn’t fall from grace, then what about the rest of the religious tenets? What about salvation, sustainability, and judgment day? What about the coming environmental doom from fossil fuels and global warming, if we all don’t get down on our knees and conserve every day?\n\nWell, it’s interesting. You may have noticed that something has been left off the doomsday list, lately. Although the preachers of environmentalism have been yelling about population for fifty years, over the last decade world population seems to be taking an unexpected turn. Fertility rates are falling almost everywhere. As a result, over the course of my lifetime the thoughtful predictions for total world population have gone from a high of 20 billion, to 15 billion, to 11 billion (which was the UN estimate around 1990) to now 9 billion, and soon, perhaps less. There are some who think that world population will peak in 2050 and then start to decline. There are some who predict we will have fewer people in 2100 than we do today. Is this a reason to rejoice, to say halleluiah? Certainly not. Without a pause, we now hear about the coming crisis of world economy from a shrinking population. We hear about the impending crisis of an aging population. Nobody anywhere will say that the core fears expressed for most of my life have turned out not to be true. As we have moved into the future, these doomsday visions vanished, like a mirage in the desert. They were never there—though they still appear, in the future. As mirages do.\n\nOkay, so, the preachers made a mistake. They got one prediction wrong; they’re human. So what. Unfortunately, it’s not just one prediction. It’s a whole slew of them. We are running out of oil. We are running out of all natural resources. Paul Ehrlich: 60 million Americans will die of starvation in the 1980s. Forty thousand species become extinct every year. Half of all species on the planet will be extinct by 2000. And on and on and on.\n\nWith so many past failures, you might think that environmental predictions would become more cautious. But not if it’s a religion. Remember, the nut on the sidewalk carrying the placard that predicts the end of the world doesn’t quit when the world doesn’t end on the day he expects. He just changes his placard, sets a new doomsday date, and goes back to walking the streets. One of the defining features of religion is that your beliefs are not troubled by facts, because they have nothing to do with facts.\n\nSo I can tell you some facts. I know you haven’t read any of what I am about to tell you in the newspaper, because newspapers literally don’t report them. I can tell you that DDT is not a carcinogen and did not cause birds to die and should never have been banned. I can tell you that the people who banned it knew that it wasn’t carcinogenic and banned it anyway. I can tell you that the DDT ban has caused the deaths of tens of millions of poor people, mostly children, whose deaths are directly attributable to a callous, technologically advanced western society that promoted the new cause of environmentalism by pushing a fantasy about a pesticide, and thus irrevocably harmed the third world. Banning DDT is one of the most disgraceful episodes in the twentieth century history of America. We knew better, and we did it anyway, and we let people around the world die and didn’t give a damn.\n\nI can tell you that second hand smoke is not a health hazard to anyone and never was, and the EPA has always known it. I can tell you that the evidence for global warming is far weaker than its proponents would ever admit. I can tell you the percentage the US land area that is taken by urbanization, including cities and roads, is 5%. I can tell you that the Sahara desert is shrinking, and the total ice of Antarctica is increasing. I can tell you that a blue-ribbon panel in Science magazine concluded that there is no known technology that will enable us to halt the rise of carbon dioxide in the 21st century. Not wind, not solar, not even nuclear. The panel concluded a totally new technology-like nuclear fusion-was necessary, otherwise nothing could be done and in the meantime all efforts would be a waste of time. They said that when the UN IPCC reports stated alternative technologies existed that could control greenhouse gases, the UN was wrong.\n\nI can, with a lot of time, give you the factual basis for these views, and I can cite the appropriate journal articles not in whacko magazines, but in the most prestigeous science journals, such as Science and Nature. But such references probably won’t impact more than a handful of you, because the beliefs of a religion are not dependant on facts, but rather are matters of faith. Unshakeable belief.\n\nMost of us have had some experience interacting with religious fundamentalists, and we understand that one of the problems with fundamentalists is that they have no perspective on themselves. They never recognize that their way of thinking is just one of many other possible ways of thinking, which may be equally useful or good. On the contrary, they believe their way is the right way, everyone else is wrong; they are in the business of salvation, and they want to help you to see things the right way. They want to help you be saved. They are totally rigid and totally uninterested in opposing points of view. In our modern complex world, fundamentalism is dangerous because of its rigidity and its imperviousness to other ideas.\n\nI want to argue that it is now time for us to make a major shift in our thinking about the environment, similar to the shift that occurred around the first Earth Day in 1970, when this awareness was first heightened. But this time around, we need to get environmentalism out of the sphere of religion. We need to stop the mythic fantasies, and we need to stop the doomsday predictions. We need to start doing hard science instead.\n\nThere are two reasons why I think we all need to get rid of the religion of environmentalism.\n\nFirst, we need an environmental movement, and such a movement is not very effective if it is conducted as a religion. We know from history that religions tend to kill people, and environmentalism has already killed somewhere between 10-30 million people since the 1970s. It’s not a good record. Environmentalism needs to be absolutely based in objective and verifiable science, it needs to be rational, and it needs to be flexible. And it needs to be apolitical. To mix environmental concerns with the frantic fantasies that people have about one political party or another is to miss the cold truth—that there is very little difference between the parties, except a difference in pandering rhetoric. The effort to promote effective legislation for the environment is not helped by thinking that the Democrats will save us and the Republicans won’t. Political history is more complicated than that. Never forget which president started the EPA: Richard Nixon. And never forget which president sold federal oil leases, allowing oil drilling in Santa Barbara: Lyndon Johnson. So get politics out of your thinking about the environment.\n\nThe second reason to abandon environmental religion is more pressing. Religions think they know it all, but the unhappy truth of the environment is that we are dealing with incredibly complex, evolving systems, and we usually are not certain how best to proceed. Those who are certain are demonstrating their personality type, or their belief system, not the state of their knowledge. Our record in the past, for example managing national parks, is humiliating. Our fifty-year effort at forest-fire suppression is a well-intentioned disaster from which our forests will never recover. We need to be humble, deeply humble, in the face of what we are trying to accomplish. We need to be trying various methods of accomplishing things. We need to be open-minded about assessing results of our efforts, and we need to be flexible about balancing needs. Religions are good at none of these things.\n\nHow will we manage to get environmentalism out of the clutches of religion, and back to a scientific discipline? There’s a simple answer: we must institute far more stringent requirements for what constitutes knowledge in the environmental realm. I am thoroughly sick of politicized so-called facts that simply aren’t true. It isn’t that these “facts” are exaggerations of an underlying truth. Nor is it that certain organizations are spinning their case to present it in the strongest way. Not at all—what more and more groups are doing is putting out is lies, pure and simple. Falsehoods that they know to be false.\n\nThis trend began with the DDT campaign, and it persists to this day. At this moment, the EPA is hopelessly politicized. In the wake of Carol Browner, it is probably better to shut it down and start over. What we need is a new organization much closer to the FDA. We need an organization that will be ruthless about acquiring verifiable results, that will fund identical research projects to more than one group, and that will make everybody in this field get honest fast.\n\nBecause in the end, science offers us the only way out of politics. And if we allow science to become politicized, then we are lost. We will enter the Internet version of the dark ages, an era of shifting fears and wild prejudices, transmitted to people who don’t know any better. That’s not a good future for the human race. That’s our past. So it’s time to abandon the religion of environmentalism, and return to the science of environmentalism, and base our public policy decisions firmly on that.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nDespite the horrors of Russia’s war on Ukraine, and the opportunity it has given weak Western leaders the chance to sound tough and refresh their old Cold War rhetoric, there is a point of view – which I share – that the real problem is the long term rival to our now enfeebled Western hegemony and mores – China.\n\nNot an original observation, but it’s currently obscured by the fog off war, which I imagine suits China just fine**.\n\nNot only are extremely dubious lateral flow tests and the useless but ubiquitous masks made in China (nice earners both), if you try and reduce your consumption of other Chinese goods on a point of principle, you will struggle. Some, like Apple, don’t even try. Why would they? If you’re a utilitarian/agnostic/pragmatist, you’ll find your slave labour at excitingly low salaries over in far Cathay. And why not?\n\nAny snapshot of China over the last 50 years might be relatively reassuring, but the big picture, over the spans of decades, is one of long term planning crushing all rivals. Like the Catholic Church, the Chinese state really does now think in centuries, even if Zhou Enlai’s alleged and entertaining assessment of the French Revolution – “it’s too early too say” – has been exposed as a misunderstanding.\n\nSo it seems smart to try and understand China better. There are whole university departments devoted to this, but the cultural and linguistic differences, the physical distances and the impenetrable state don’t help. We need a guide. Which is the point of this post.\n\nThe Knife has long been a fan of the polymath mathematician, musician, historian, economist, investor, journalist and magus of the Far East, David Goldman. Understanding China is his thing, and he frequently explains his thinking – just Google it.\n\nLast month provided a fantastic, erudite and fact filled podcast on this topic, in Law & Liberty. Here is the link and the transcript. There’s so much packed in here, but I thought that I would just list some fascinating excerpts, which give you a flavour. I’ve italicised some bits worthy of particular note, to me at least.\n\nThis issue is not going to go away. We need a coherent strategy, and fast. Like it or not, China doesn’t do friends….\n\nHong Kong has never been a Chinese city. It was a British city. It was founded by the British at the beginning of the opium trade. The majority of its population never wanted to be Chinese. So I think the biggest mistake Margaret Thatcher made in her glorious career was to cede Hong Kong and Kowloon to China when she didn’t have to. Most of the Chinese population hasn’t liked this. There is a significant independence movement in Hong Kong. From the Chinese standpoint, China’s like a Roach Motel. Once you go in, you don’t get out. The Chinese are always terrified that if one rebel province can secede, they’ll all secede. So they will use whatever measures they need to prevent that.\n\n2. Remember, China is not a country. We tend to think of it as a country. It is a heterogeneous empire with 200 languages spoken in 90 major ethnic groups, and always at risk of falling apart. The Chinese Empire, whoever runs it, whether it’s called an Imperial Dynasty or a Communist Party, lives in terror of a rebel province that will encourage other rebel provinces. So that’s why China will go to war over Taiwan\n\n3. Xi Jinping told this to Barack Obama during the APEC summit in 2015. There’s an old Chinese proverb: kill the chicken while the monkey watches. Well, the South China Sea is the chicken, and Taiwan is the monkey here. China is saying, “We’re willing to go to war over a bunch of empty atolls based on some glorious old map. Think of what we’ll do with Taiwan. Think of what we’ll do with Hong Kong.” So that’s China’s method of governance going back thousands of years. Sadly, there’s a continuity between what was always a very heterogeneous set of men who has a very cruel empire and what the Chinese are doing today. This is based on traditional Chinese governance. It’s not per se a function of Marxist-Leninist ideology.\n\n4. Every Chinese I’ve talked to, ranging from senior officials of the Foreign Ministry to taxi drivers, when asked, “What are you going to do about the Uighur problem,” has said, “We’re going to kill them all.” China has had a policy of exterminating what it considers unruly barbarians on its borders for a very long time. Their attitude towards the Uighurs is that they don’t want to assimilate into China. You get the traditional Chinese choice, which is column A, you become Chinese, column B, we kill you all, and there isn’t anything on the menu.\n\n5. The West has underestimated Asians for the past century and change. The Russians underestimated the Japanese during the 1905 war. The British underestimated the Japanese at Singapore. The French underestimated the Vietnamese at Dien Bien Phu. And I think we can say fairly that the American military in the ’60s underestimated the North Vietnamese Army. We simply have difficulty believing that a culture so different from ours, and one that was so impoverished and humiliated for such a long period of time could come back so quickly\n\n6. They’ve moved in the past 35 years nearly 600 million people from countryside to city. That’s the equivalent of the whole of Europe from the Ural Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean. Imagine building a new Glasgow, a new Rome, a new Lisbon, a new Helsinki. Build every city in Europe to accommodate that many people. That’s the biggest economic transformation in history.\n\nA lot to take in already, but Goldman makes three key explanatory points:\n\n7. China’s enormous wealth and population are based on fertilized river valleys which could produce eight times the caloric content per acre with rice that Western European or Middle Eastern cultures could produce with wheat. So enormous wealth, but also enormous susceptibility to flooding and famine. So massive infrastructure to control floods has been the foundation of the Chinese Empire. When we look at things like the $2 trillion Belt and Road Initiative where China proposed to build infrastructure all across the Eurasian continent and basically lock it in to the Chinese Empire, that is the old Chinese imperial model extended into an external policy.\n\n8. The second thing to understand about China is imperial bureaucracy. For thousands of years, the smartest kids in the provinces that sat and taken an examination to become government officials, used to be called the mandarin system. You can see pictures from over 2,000 years ago of young Chinese sitting in an examination hold taking the mandarin exam. This is now the university entrance exam, the Gaokao, which is taken by nearly 10 million Chinese every year. About six out of 10 of whom get to go to university. If you look at the math questions on that, I doubt one in 500 American high school seniors could answer them. I know a little math, and they made me sweat.\n\n9. Chinese society is based on the extended family. It’s hierarchical. The emperor is like the big paterfamilias of the nation, and he has smaller paterfamiliases under him. The foundation of the Chinese economy has always been an extended family farm led by one paterfamilias. So you’ve never had a civil society where people have peers. No Chinese has ever sat on a school board or a little league committee. Everything’s always come top down. There’s no sense of rights and obligations as we have under Roman law, no sense of the divine spark of the individual as we have under ancient Hebrew law. What you have is a set of loyalties to hierarchy. That, in a thumbnail, is what Confucianism is about. So the Chinese have no experience of self-governance. In place of democratic governance, you have a selection of supposedly the smartest people, or at least the best exam takers in the country\n\nDoesn’t sound too attractive for the average punter. It doesn’t sound like the UK, Europe or the USA either. But there’s more…\n\n10. The Chinese don’t have friends in Aristotle’s sense of political friendship where you have a peer group that governs a city, and you have to form friendships in order to solve governance problems and advance policies. Everything in China comes from the top, so the Chinese tend to kiss up and kick down. You don’t question the order that comes down from the top because it’s bad for your health. You could become a kidney donor real fast. And the people below you, you simply tell them what to do. You’re the paterfamilias. They owe you loyalty. You’re supposed to be benevolent under Confucian philosophy. But in fact, you have absolute control. As I’ve said, there is no subsidiarity. There is no civil society structure. Everything is up and down as opposed to parallel\n\n11. The whole idea that China was going to evolve into a Western style democracy simply because they got more prosperous ignores the fact that this is a culture that’s been around for 5,000 years, which operated radically differently from Judeo-Christian cultures. This is the purest form of paganism.\n\n12. The Chinese are probably the least spiritual people in the world. They believe in fate and themselves. When you say, “Well, what’s Chinese religion?” Well, you can say that there’s Buddhism, there’s some Daoism, there’s some household gods. But the Chinese really are down-to-earth pragmatic. How do I advance my family? How do I get rich?\n\n13. We got very complacent after we won the Cold War. We decided we were so powerful that we could rest on laurels and coast. We could, under the Clinton administration, turn NATO into a responsibility to protect kind of social work organization. Or the George W. Bush, we could go out to support democracy to the world. I think that was a big mistake.\n\n14. Every pharmaceutical company in the world is setting up shop in China because the data the Chinese have is a vast mine for researching new drugs, interactions, genetic defects, and so forth. The Chinese computer scientists aren’t any smarter than Google. I think Google’s probably the best computation company in the world. But if you think of artificial intelligence as the engine, data is the fuel. And China, where there’s no guarantee of personal data protection, has the biggest trove of data for medical research in the world.\n\nAs a surgeon, that’s beginning to remind me of the Pernkopf dilemma…\n\nWe shoot ourselves in the foot, a lot, when it comes to China:\n\n15. The problem is not so much that we don’t have smart people. It’s that the US tech sector made a conscious decision to become dependent on China for the production of hardware. And of course, the Chinese, who excluded Google and other US companies from the Chinese market, has spent vast amounts of money developing their own software, their own computation, and are now in position to compete with us in the software field, as well. I think this was terribly short-sighted.\n\n16. If you look at what our (in the USA) kids are doing, we graduate, I think, about 40,000 mechanical engineers a year. That’s not half what Germany does. A tiny fraction of China. The smartest kids aren’t going into manufacturing because the smartest companies aren’t investing in manufacturing. Really ambitious kids at US universities want to either go with a software or a Goldman Sachs, so they study mathematical finance or computer science. The danger is we end up being, if you pardon the expression, geeks in a new Roman Empire. I think we need a very strong signal from the government, including very strong tax incentives and, in rare cases, subsidies for manufacturing investment. We have to get our best talent thinking about manufacturing, particularly the kind of artificial intelligence, computer-driven manufacturing, which the Chinese call the fourth industrial revolution.\n\nIt’s not all doom and gloom, though, Goldman attempts to unpick the foreseeable future, and he retains faith in Western ingenuity and enterprise, if not the current modish idiotic political scene. Is China our enemy? Because if so, the much quoted but rarely read Sun Tzu can help us here:\n\nIt is more important to outthink your enemy, than to outfight him\n\nThe opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.\n\nThe supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.\n\nOne need not destroy one’s enemy. One need only destroy his willingness to engage.\n\nOK, handy advice, but back to Goldman. Does China hate us?\n\nIt’s like meeting a tiger in the jungle. A tiger isn’t wicked. It doesn’t hate you. It just looks at you and thinks protein source. China is the old pagan world. The concepts of good and evil don’t exist in the same way they exist in the Judeo-Christian worlds. Loyalty and obligation substitute for good and evil. So we will never be friends with China. It’ll take a very long time, if ever, for China to decide that the Judeo-Christian concept of human society is superior to theirs. They’ve been around for thousands of years, and they change very slowly. Our system is better. I believe in the sanctity of the individual as the highest good in society, and that’s entirely absent from the Chinese system. But the Chinese idea of, “Let’s have a meritocracy of the cleverest people who run everything from the top,” occasionally does better than the messy brawl of democracy, unfortunately.\n\nThis is not the time to have Joe Biden at the helm, or a bunch of EU technocrats. However, you play the hand with which you’ve been dealt. The first stage, which we have barely begun, is to understand with whom we are confronted. David Goldman is one who knows. The final word to him:\n\nThe energy and intelligence of the Chinese people is impressive. I am not a panda hugger. I’m not a Sinophile. I don’t like Chinese culture. I find it brutal, and from a Western standpoint, in many ways repugnant. But it’s nonetheless impressive, and underestimating it would be a terrible error.\n\n**This excellent piece from David Cameron’s old pal, Steve Hilton, appeared the day after this blog post. Recommended.\n\nPenicillin, the postage stamp, the TV, the steam engine (therefore the industrial revolution)…\n\n…we’re going to need a bigger list…\n\n…economics, geology, the telephone, the exploration of Africa, the tyre, most of the bicycle, logarithms, the theory of electromagnetic radiation, the laws of thermodynamics, the development of Far East trade and Hong Kong, the undersea telegraph cable, anaesthesia, large swathes of philosophy, numerous war heroes…. are you getting the picture yet?\n\nCorrect. Scotland, a small population in a largeish country, much of it barely inhabitable, certainly punched well above its weight. There’s a lot more than the ‘rapidly assembled from my head’ list that you have above. Many refer to it, rightly, as Scottish exceptionalism.\n\nSo what the hell happened?\n\nThe current Scottish establishment, almost entirely bereft of that kind of talent, like to drone on about such exceptionalism, but if you go to Scotland and examine the evidence in 2022, it’s not there. It is long gone.\n\nIt’s been replaced by a needy, vicious, hate filled and bigoted Nationalist political class, whose stupidity can be summed up by their obsession with pushing Gaelic – a language which virtually none of them speak – to the point where a dim SNP staffer used Google Translate to celebrate ‘Thermal Injuries Night’ on the 25th January just past.\n\nThe worst thing about this, is that the voters put them there. A lot of luck with constituencies, a lot of rigging the media and the public sector, a desperate coalition with the sleazy and moronic Greens, but still voted in, just.\n\nWhere is that spirit of Scottish exceptionalism?\n\nWell, The Knife has a theory. It was itself an exception. A prolonged one. Go along to the Science Museum in London, and marvel at the genius of James Watt, who essentially invented the Industrial Revolution. You may see this little sign by one of his mighty steam engines…\n\n“I am heart sick of this accursed country”, a place where he couldn’t move forward and have his work recognised. So he left, and never looked back. Just as Watt was leaving, Scotland was beginning to blossom, notably in literature and the Scottish Enlightenment. After that came the deluge.\n\nAdam Smith, James Hutton, David Hume, Lord Kelvin, James Maxwell, Walter Scott, John Logie Baird, James Chalmers, Alexander Graham Bell, David Stirling, James Simpson, Alexander Fleming, William Jardine, David Livingstone, Mungo Park, and many many more.\n\nWhat happened, and when? The supply of these talented people, acclaimed across the globe, appears to have dried up, unless you want to include various overrated actors and a slew of very bad writers.\n\nIt’s not too hard to say when this Golden Age began, there were glimmerings in the mid 18th century (well after the enduring 1707 Act of Union, hated by Nationalist idiots), by the early 19th century it was in full swing, right through till the end of the Second World War at least. When it ended is more contentious, as is identifying the guilty parties.\n\nConsider this, the famous but essentially useless Scot, Gordon Brown cynically developed a client state of voters in Scotland who would be dependent on government largesse for everything, and in his mind, would therefore always vote Labour. A cruel trick, which required to keep people in near poverty for it to work. He couldn’t see Salmond in his rear view mirror, basically playing the same card, but with tartan trimmings and a few middle class aspirations. Brown became Chancellor in 1997, so our closing date is before that.\n\nA small tale might help to clarify things. When the oil industry in the early 70’s was looking to ramp up the North Sea drilling, it needed a land base, which inevitably was going to bring huge prosperity with it. The best North Sea port, with terrific access and moorings is Dundee, at the mouth of the Tay estuary. A blessed spot, in fact. BP were in town looking at the prospects for laying pipelines from the rigs to the shore using giant drums from which the pipes were unrolled. A demonstration of the technology was taking place and there was considerable excitement. At which point a dock shop steward turned up and asked a subcontractor which union his men were with. The answer was that they were mostly not in any union. The immediate reaction was ‘everyone out’, the dock closed down for two days, BP took one look and headed north to the distinctly inferior Aberdeen facilities, and that city came to enjoy huge wealth and investment. It’s a true story, and one that should be properly explored and retold. Why would the city shoot itself in the foot, leading to years of relative neglect and poverty? Where was the spirit of James Watt? It was a Labour council and government at the time, busily creating their passive client state, and the mindset which Brown later came to exploit. The same mindset now gleefully manipulated by the irredeemably statist SNP.\n\nThis was the era of the Clydeside shipyard disputes. As this handy piece points out “By the late 19th century the Clyde shipyards were building the most sophisticated and technologically innovative iron and steel ships in the world.” – part of that Golden Age. But by the late 1950’s, union militancy, overt communism and foreign competition had made the same shipyards too much trouble to be worth it for employers. All this is bound up in the politics of the age, in particular the visceral and counterproductive hatred of Tories in parts of Scotland (see also 2022). Whatever you think of the politics, or the nobility of the ‘work in’ to keep the yards open, the fact is that the Golden Age was passing. The attitudes had changed.\n\nAs noted above, the bullish Gordon Brown, having displaced the nominally Scottish Blair, was completely blindsided by the aggression of the Nationalists and had his client state stolen from under his nose by Salmond, and kept there by Sturgeon, for whom the Covid pandemic was a perfect opportunity to more deeply embed that sense of dependency on the government (not the UK one), and combine it with a weird sense of entitlement. Billy Connolly saw it for what it was: “Braveheart is pure Australian shite. William Wallace was a spy, a thief, a blackmailer – a c**t basically. And people are swallowing it. It’s part of a new Scottish racism, which I loathe – this thing that everything horrible is English. It’s conducted by the great unread and the conceited w***ers at the SNP, those dreary little pr**ks in Parliament who rely on bigotry for support”. He wasn’t wrong.\n\nA dead end for Scottish exceptionalism. So, returning to the thesis of this short post, we have a period of about 200 years – the mid 18th to the mid 20th centuries, which everyone recognises as having shown Scotland – whilst part of the UK – as an extraordinarily productive and vibrant society. That died off in real terms 50 or more years ago, yet we’re still being urged to believe that these giants walk amongst us, and will lead an independent nation to freedom. The mind boggles.\n\nThese days Scotland often imports her intellectuals and ‘leaders’, so we get a crazy and lazy Canadian as the Greens’ head, absurdly with a voice in government, and an arrogant and profoundly politicised American, Devi Sridhar, as the ‘scientific’ mouthpiece for Sturgeon and Covid, promoting a completely unworkable and failed policy of Zero Covid. Yes, that actually happened.\n\nLord Kelvin (William Thomson, born in Northern Ireland, but a Scot in reality) was professor of Natural Philosopy at Glasgow University for 53 years, and in his second law of thermodynamics he stated that the entropy of isolated systems left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease, with entropy being the key word “a state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty”. This applies as much to society as it does to physics, I would suggest, and that is where Scotland is now, in a state of increasing, rudderless, entropy. There is no better recent example of this reckless and unserious chaos creation, than Sturgeon’s pandering to the tiny Green groups who keep her in power, by undermining what’s left of the North Sea oil and gas industry – a complete volte face from the pre-referendum plan, and an act of staggering gold medal stupidity considering Putin’s very predictable weaponising of fossil fuels. James Watt’s ‘accursed country’ is being born again.\n\nThis is a somewhat negative piece, but the evidence is all around us. Scottish exceptionalism died a long time ago. Don’t kid yourself otherwise. The voters are content with that for now, perhaps, but the game is up."
