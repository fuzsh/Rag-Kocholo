        "text": "Grosz was famous and feared in Germany as a powerful, political satirist on par with Goya and Daumier. In his drawings, most of which appeared as lithographs in satirical and political magazines with wide circulation, he vented his venomous feelings about the Germans, especially those in power. His hatred was based on aesthetics as well as politics. Even before WWI he had planned to publish a three-volume collection of photographs Ugliness of the Germans, but he never completed more than the early chapters. This is one of the rare drawings in which he expressed empathy, in this case the victims of Germanyâ€™s hyperinflation. Instead of his usual biting, caricature line and exaggeration, he used a haunting realism."
