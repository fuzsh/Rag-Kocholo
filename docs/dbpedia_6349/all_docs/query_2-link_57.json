        "text": "Competitive analysis\n\nfor brand development\n\nMentz hired us to develop an effective brand identity that sets the company’s positioning apart from competitors more effectively. After conducting extensive research on the competition, we analyzed all brand touch points from press release to trade show exhibition. Interviews with customers and employees provided insights into the strengths and potentials of the company and the industry overall. Megatrends also provided additional reinforcement for the future positioning.\n\nBrand identity and guiding principle\n\nWe used the results of our extensive research to streamline the strategic positioning and derive an inspiring, yet applicable identity for all business units - effectively summed up in our guiding principle: »Digital Pathfinders«.\n\nMobility app »Gullivr«\n\n»Gullivr« is a central service application by MENTZ – a solution that unifies a wide range of different mobility services in one app. In addition to classic features like route planning, incident reporting as well as ticket and profile management, we came up with other helpful services like weather-based route planning and personalised mobility profiles based on kilometres travelled and CO₂ emissions prevented.\n\nThe white label app uses the existing MENTZ design system as a default but can be adapted to the corporate design of each transportation company."
