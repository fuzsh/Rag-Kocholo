        "text": "Newly discovered and long lost works generally add a jolt to the Old Masters market and an array of paintings in the July evening auctions at Sotheby’s and Christie’s in London are worthy of attention, including a pair of portraits by Rembrandt, and pictures by Pieter Brueghel the Younger and Michael Sweerts. And there are others that return with new attributions, the newly cleaned, and the occasional work that just can’t seem to find a buyer no matter how often it appears with an increasingly lower estimate. Add in a smattering of still lifes and vedute plus some portraiture and you have a sale.\n\nAt Christie’s there are several works that are “fresh” – those attracting the most media attention are the Rembrandt portraits, more about them below. Let’s start with an Allegory of Spring by the perpetually market friendly Pieter Brueghel the Younger, a thoroughly capable and entertaining artist who made a career largely of reproducing his father’s works (this was the subject of a 2002 exhibition in Maastricht and Brussels, Brueghel Enterprises, for which there is an excellent catalogue). Indeed, there is a whole subsection of the Old Masters market devoted to works by the many Brueghels (Pieter the Elder, Pieter the Younger, Jan the Elder, Jan the Younger, etc.). The discolored varnish notwithstanding, the picture is a delight filled with numerous vignettes of spring time village life: eight workers tend a formal flower garden; three figures wrestle with sheep they’re shearing, while another carries a basket of newly shorn wool; across a stream in an open expanse before a row of thatched roof houses a dozen or so figures are dancing (though one seems to have been overserved – he’s tended by a woman as he vomits); there are pigs and ducks; a young figure fishing; and others going about their day.\n\nConceived as part of a series about the seasons, the original by Pieter the Elder from 1565 is in the Albertina in Vienna. There are some twenty autograph versions by Pieter the Younger; this one carries a £600,000-800,000 estimate. According to the sale catalogue: “Spring was evidently one of the more frequently requested seasons from Pieter the Younger as an individual painting. In the certificate for the painting by [leading Brueghel scholar] Dr. Klaus Ertz, dated 27 February 2018, confirming the attribution after first-hand examination, Dr. Ertz rates the present work among the most well preserved versions.” The quality, condition, and the fact this previously unpublished work has been in the same family for more than a century will likely result in a hefty price.\n\nAmong the more enigmatic of the “fresh” works is The Artist’s Studio with a Seamstress by the equally enigmatic Michael Sweerts, who began his career in Brussels before heading to Rome in the mid-seventeenth century, became religiously devout, went mad, and died on the Indian Ocean island of Goa while on a religious pilgrimage to China. The painting incorporates several typologies: the right includes an artist at his easel, a musician, and a few other individuals; the center is littered with numerous fragmentary sculptures from antiquity and by contemporary artists; and the left side shows a seamstress studiously working on the elaborately embroidered hem of a piece of fabric. The darkened varnish obscures and hides additional details including paintings hung high on the wall behind the key figures (likely depictions of Sweerts’ own paintings), and an anteroom with more staffage.\n\nSweerts painted other images of the artist’s studio (the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, and the Detroit Institute of Arts) along with the seamstress (Trustees of the Berkeley Will Trust, Berkeley Castle). According to the sale catalogue: “The [present] composition itself is familiar to us by virtue of a number of versions and copies, the best of which – in the Rau Foundation – has variously been described by scholars as by or after Sweerts.” This work at Christie’s, which is a masterpiece, should go into a public collection.\n\nThe powerful and small Rembrandt portraits were last sold 199 years ago – at Christie’s – and have remained in the same collection ever since. Dated 1635, they depict husband and wife Jan Willemsz. van der Pluym and Jaapgen Carels, distant relatives of the artist who were also his friends.\n\nEngland’s great houses are home to numerous gems, some of which are occasionally sold to pay for debts or fixing roofs, etc. While we don’t know the reason, the Marquess of Northampton is parting ways with an early crucifixion by Fra Angelico, the fifteen-century genius of Florentine painting. Against a gilt background we see the crucified Christ flanked by two airborne angels; Mary Magdalene kneels holding the base of the cross, with the Virgin Mary on one side and Saint John the Baptist on the other. The figure of the Baptist is particularly glorious. One can see the outline (incised into the surface) that surrounds the figure; he wears a gilt-trimmed blue floor-length tunic over which is a gilt-trimmed salmon-colored cloak with beautifully modeled shadowing. His face is an expression of beatific grief and his head is surrounded by a halo of radiating incised lines and circular punchwork.\n\nAnother country house, Ragley Hall, is selling a large oil on panel depiction of The Raising of Lazarus by the Dutch Mannerist painter Cornelis Corenlisz van Haarlem. The picture, dated 1602, was commissioned by Jan Matthijsz. Ban who is seen on the far right looking at the viewer and gesturing with his right hand to the standing Christ and with his left hand to the recumbent Lazarus. The figures typologically derive from Italian precedents (though none witnessing the miracle are seen holding their noses against the stench of the decomposing corpse as depicted by Italian artists including Giovanni di Paolo and Sebastiano del Piombo). The scene is grand and theatrical.\n\nA work making its auction debut is the elegant Portrait of Sophia Coymans (1636-1714), three-quarter-length, holding a twig with an orange, before a landscape, by the seventeenth century Dutch painter Bartholomeus van der Helst. The work has stayed within the family since it was commissioned. The young woman depicted wears an extraordinary dress whose details – shimmering silk and satin, delicate lacework, and intricate embroidery – are brilliantly rendered by this skilled portraitist.\n\nIn the “Oops” department: a decade ago New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art deaccessioned a bust-length portrait of a lady “attributed to” the early Netherlandish painter Hans Memling; the picture sold for $482,500. Though the work had been considered autograph for much of the twentieth century, the Met’s curator, Maryan Ainsworth, labeled it as “attributed to” the artist in the 1998 Van Eyck to Bruegel: Early Netherlandish Painting in The Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition catalogue. Now it returns without that price-killing qualifier and with a hefty estimate of £800,000-1.2 million.\n\nAnother work making a return engagement is a triptych depicting the Adoration of the Magi by the early sixteenth century painter known as the Master of the Antwerp Adoration. The period during which the as yet unidentified artist was active was the focus of a 2005-2006 exhibition in Antwerp and Maastricht, ExtravagAnt! A Forgotten Chapter of Antwerp Painting, 1500-1530 (for which there is an excellent, though hard to find catalogue). The picture was sold a decade ago for more than $530,000 to the present owner; it came back to auction on July 29, 2020, with an estimate of £300,000-500,000 and failed to sell. Now it’s back with a £150,000-250,000 estimate.\n\nOne last work at Christie’s that dazzles with details is a small oil on copper (some fourteen by ten inches) by Jan Brueghel the Elder that depicts Hell. The Dutch and Flemish depictions of the underworld – from Van Eyck, to Bosch, Brueghel, and others – often feature a cornucopia of tortured souls, various demons and monsters, metamorphosed figures, vertiginous landscapes, serpents, snakes, the occasional cauldron, fires, flying beasts, and other assorted oddities.\n\nMost have as a nominal focal point some Christian subject matter or classical mythology about which is embroidered the maniacal scenes; this picture is a rare exception. It’s just pure, unconditional hell.\n\nThere is less at Sotheby’s that catches my eye, but there are some standouts starting with a large, dramatic, and richly detailed Pentecost from about 1490 by an artist active in Bruges with the provisional name of The Master of the Baroncelli Portraits (which refers to the portraits of Pierantonio di Guaspare Bandini-Baroncelli and his wife Maria Bonciani today in the Ufizzi). The picture was sold at Christie’s on December 7, 2010, to the London-based dealer Jean-Luc Baroni, for nearly £4.2 million (against an estimate of £1.0-1.5 million), from whom it was acquired by the current seller. Now shorn of its discolored varnishes and dirt, it carries a £7-10 million estimate.\n\nThe Virgin is seated in the center surrounded by eleven apostles; in the lower register left and right, dressed in black, are male and female donors, respectively, who presumably commissioned the work. Unfortunately a full coat of arms, which would help identify the two patrons, is not visible. The scene is in the present day and there are vignettes through an open door and window to the town outside; a second door opens into another room. It’s a wonderful image.\n\nThough I’m not keen on Rubens (and even much less so El Greco, and don’t get me started on Renior), the roughly three- by four-foot Saint Sebastian tended by two angels is impressive and commanding. A slightly larger version (with two additional angels) can be found in Rome’s Galleria Corsini. The present work was misattributed when it was last sold, some fifteen years ago, as a work by the Rubens’ younger French contemporary, Laurent de la Hyre.\n\nAlso purchased by Jean-Luc Baroni in 2010 are the pair of Canalettos – Venice, a view of the Piazzetta with the southwest corner of the Doge’s Palace; Venice, a view of the quay of the Dogana – featured in the present sale. Baroni paid $3,890,500 in January 28, 2010 (the same sale had a glorious reliquary by Francesco di Vannuccio) and sold them to the collector that has put them back on the market where they’re estimated a £3-4 million. We’ll see if they break even (UPDATE: they didn’t).\n\nAlong with these two evening sales, there are ancillary auctions of Old Master drawings, lesser priced day sale paintings, sculpture and statuary, along with another trove of works from the Safra Collection sold without reserve.\n\nIt’s a lot to absorb.\n\nThe potential for Andy Warhol’s Shot Sage Blue Marilyn to sell for more than $200 million in Christie’s May 9, 2022, sale of “The Collection of Works from Thomas and Doris Ammann” has generated headlines globally and resurrected the deliciously peculiar story behind the painting’s title (more on that later).\n\nBut there are two other works in the sale that are noteworthy – a pair of paintings from 1961 by the American artist Robert Ryman, the jazz aficionado and one-time guard at New York’s Museum of Modern Art, whose “white paintings” dare, challenge, enthrall, and seduce human perception much like Donald Judd’s sculptures.\n\nThe two works, both untitled, are comprised of Ryman’s characteristic jumble of thickly painted narrow and short squiggly white lines. Peeking out under some of these white strokes are hints of underpaint in shades of green and ochre, a colorful foundation obscured through an evolutionary path to the white surface.\n\nSurprisingly, the compositions don’t seem chaotic; indeed, the aggregation of agitated brushstrokes is suggestive of a colony of bees moving about in a putatively random fashion but ultimately with a shared goal. An equilibrium for the chaos/calm. Another giveaway of the artist’s control and deliberate intent is the precision of the rendering and placement of his signature, which both identifies the author and is a functional element in the overall composition.\n\nThe first of the two works is intimate in scale – 12 x 12 inches. The oil on Bristol Board composition could be mistaken for an aerial image of a coastline. More than 85% of the board is covered with overlapping brushstrokes, nearly all white, but hints of the board and green underpaint peek through, and there are discreet passages in taupe, including the artist’s “RRyman61” signature. The composition (landmass) is bulbous and the pigments’ oils bleed into the board along the vertical border of the painted and unpainted areas. The oil-soaked passages suggest coastal shallows that presage the deep end.\n\nRyman’s career began in the late 1950s and by 1961 the foundation of his vision and path had been established with small scale works that juxtaposed paint, support, textures, volume, and void. While I don’t find this painting among the strongest from that era (there are several superb examples from the artist’s collection featured in the 1993 exhibition organized by the Tate and MoMA), it is solidly representative and authoritative in its own right. It carries an estimate of $1.5 – 2.0 million.\n\nThe second work is an oil on linen that measures roughly 5.5 feet by 5.5 feet. The composition is small square of vigorous white brushstrokes within a larger square of nearly imperceptible and wide white brushwork. The smaller square is lodged in the upper right corner of the work and occupies perhaps 40-45% of the overall composition. There are hints of green and ochre underpaint, and portions of the linen support poke through in places. It’s a masterful contrasting of paint textures, volume and void, and the precise “Ryman” signature at lower left completes the composition and brilliantly counterbalances the writhing network of paint in the upper right. The painting is estimated at $15 – 20 million.\n\nAs for Warhol’s Shot Sage Blue Marilyn, here’s the story behind its title as recounted in the sale catalogue:\n\nThis paintings (sic) also enters ‘Warhol-lore’ as one of the famous Shot Marilyns, a group of four paintings involved in an infamous event that took place at the Factory in the fall of 1964. Warhol had just completed a set of five 40 x 40 inch canvases of Marilyn (the four Shot Marilyns plus Turquoise Marilyn) using his new screening process, when he was visited by his friend Ray Johnson and a woman named Dorothy Podber. She was a sometime performance artist and the owner of outlandish pets including an ocelot which she took for walks around New York’s Central Park. She was also known as a photographer and when she entered the Factory and saw Andy silkscreening, she asked if she could shoot them. Assuming that she meant photograph his latest work, Warhol agreed. Podber promptly took a gun from purse and fired a single shot at the canvases leant up against the wall. She then put the gun back in her purse and left.\n\nThe sale takes place at Christie’s offices in New York. It should be entertaining.\n\n“You’re here to see the Caravaggio?” said the guard at Adam Williams Fine Art, a private art gallery on East 80th Street on Manhattan’s Upper East Side one block from the treasure-filled Metropolitan Museum of Art. Billed as one of the greatest Old Master painting discoveries in decades, one would have expected a line out the door to see the Judith and Holofernes by the famous 17th-century Italian artist, known for his revolutionary painting style and tempestuous personal life, which had been found in an attic in Toulouse, France on April 23, 2014, by the Toulouse-based auctioneer Marc Labarbe. It was publicly unveiled two years later.\n\nHowever, during my visit on the final day of the picture’s public viewing in New York (part of a multi-city media campaign), I was often the only person in the light-filled second floor room devoid of furniture save for a small writing desk and chair at one end and “the painting” at the other.\n\nI was glad for the luxury of having one-on-one time with this dramatic, gory and compelling composition rather than having to jostle with a scrum of noisy observers loudly opining about whether this is a real Caravaggio.\n\nEric Turquin, a representative for the firm handling the forthcoming June 27, 2019 auction in France of the painting, where it could sell for more than €150 million, indicated both surprise and disappointment with the lack of attendance. He lamented the absence of visits by museum curators, specifically mentioning the National Gallery of Art, a museum that he praised as one of the world’s best, but one he noted that lacked a Caravaggio.\n\nFor the past five years, since announcing the discovery of the painting, Turquin has been actively promoting the work as a “great original by Caravaggio,” as he says in a video on the website The Toulouse Caravaggio. The website includes testimonials from various experts about the painting’s veracity, though in his “report” about the picture, the Metropolitan’s Keith Christiansen opens with the following observation: “From the first time I saw the picture in May, 2015 and became convinced of its authorship, I also recognized that this was one of those pictures that would not achieve a consensus among specialists.”\n\nThe authorship of the work has been actively debated as attested to by dozens of media reports. Turquin has supporters who see the work as “autograph” in art world parlance, some have argued that this Judith is by the late 16th/early 17th-century Baroque Flemish painter/dealer Louis Finson who worked in France, while another school of thought holds that the work may be by Caravaggio and a contemporaneous or subsequent collaborator.\n\nThe downloadable 168-page auction catalogue, which covers everything from the iconography of the Israelite widow who decapitates the Assyrian general to technical specifications and the written evidence circumstantially linked to the work, makes a compelling case and is a worthy addition to any library of Italian Baroque painting, especially one focused on Caravaggio and those influenced by the painter.\n\nOn Thursday, June 27, 2019, the painting will be auctioned in Toulouse; the event will be live-streamed on The Toulouse Caravaggio website.\n\nA rare work in excellent condition by an as yet unidentified late 15th century Flemish master has been acquired by the Groeningemuseum in Bruges, Belgium. Saint Veronica with the Sudarium, (ca. 1500) by the Master of the Legend of Saint Ursula came to the Bruges institution via “an auction house in New York,” according to CODART, and, “It will go on display at the Groeningemuseum in March 2019.” The Flemish daily De Standard reports the sale was brokered by Sotheby’s and the purchase price was €570,000 plus an import tax of €34,000, all provided by the Museum Collection Fund.\n\nThe painting depicts Saint Veronica holding up a cloth with an image of Jesus on it. The apocryphal saint encountered Jesus in Jerusalem on what is now the via Dolorosa as he carried the cross to his crucifixion. She wiped the sweat from his face and his image miraculously appeared on the cloth. Saint Veronica does not appear in the New Testament; her name is likely a combination of vera (true) and ikon (image), and Jacobus Voragine made her story popular in the 13th century Golden Legend.\n\nThe panel painting, with its arched top, depicts the saint against a gilt background. Her elaborate clothing and headdress are bejeweled, and veils on either side of her head are animated in the wind. Christ is shown looking straight ahead at the viewer and is depicted in exacting detail.\n\nRKD – Netherlands Institute for Art History lists a comparable composition (above) in the Countess Durrieu Collection in Paris. There are subtle differences that may be due to overpaint that has been removed, however the Paris image measures 59 x 37 cm., substantially larger than the work purchased by the museum, which does not appear in the RKD inventory.\n\nA comparable, somewhat larger work appeared at Christie’s in New York in January 28, 2015, though the image of Christ is held aloft by two angels and the backdrop is the exposed red ground from whichthe gilding is largely gone. The painting was estimated at $250,000-350,000, and sold for $509,000 (hammer price + buyer’s fees).\n\nThis type of image is known as an acheiropoietos in Greek,” according to Martin Kemp, author of Christ to Coke: How Image Becomes Icon. “An acheiropoietos or non manufactum (not made by any hand) was an image that appeared miraculously, without any intervention by a human maker. No painting or other artifice was involved. The artifex (maker) was Christ himself.”\n\nThe Master of the Legend of Saint Ursula was active in the last quarter of the 15th century; his provisional name comes from the art historian Max J. Friedländer after an altarpiece showing scenes from the Life of Saint Ursula, appropriately enough, in the Groeningemuseum. His work shows the influence of both Rogier van der Weyden and Hans Memling. However, the museum’s former curator, Till-Holger Borchert, based on an examination of the panels’ underdrawings beginning in September 2002, concluded that it was the work of several distinct masters. By contrast, in 2004, the Bruges historian A. Janssens identified the artist as Pieter Casenbroot (1436-1504/1505) according to RKD – Netherlands Institute for Art History. At present there are only some dozen or so works attributed to this master (or masters).\n\nAn exquisite triptych from c. 1410, called “one of the finest examples of early German Gothic art still in private hands” was acquired by Rotterdam’s Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen at Sotheby’s December 5, 2018 Old Master Painting sale in London, according to the museum’s press release. The painting by the Master of Saint Veronica, Lot 6 in the sale, sold for a hammer price of £1.3 million (£1.57 million with fees-slightly more than $2 million), against a pre-sale estimate of £1.2-1.8 million. The museum’s release states that the acquisition was made possible by “a generous donation from the Rembrandt Association, Mondriaan Fund, the BankGiro Lottery, the Stichting Bevordering van Volkskracht, the Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds (also thanks to the Breeman Talle Fund), the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen Foundation and a number of private donations.”\n\nThe painting had been featured in the museum’s 2012 exhibition “The Road to Van Eyck” and had been high on exhibition curator Friso Lammertse’s acquisition list, who notes: “The painting shows in an incredibly beautiful way the elegance and refinement that is so typical of International Gothic. It is a key piece of this period, deeply moving, especially because of the sweetness in the central panel that contrasts strongly with the scene on the outside where a lonely Christ carries the cross.”\n\nThe Sotheby’s catalogue entry states:\n\nThis beautiful and intensely personal triptych was painted in Cologne around 1410. It is one of the earliest and most complete surviving works of art of its type, and certainly one of the finest examples of early German Gothic art still in private hands. In its refinement and exquisite detail it exemplifies the contemporary taste for beautiful courtly works of a small scale. Although the precise identity of its creator has not yet convincingly been determined, the Master of Saint Veronica was undoubtedly the most important of the painters who introduced this International Court style to Cologne at the beginning of the fifteenth century, thus laying the foundations for the Cologne school under the great Stefan Lochner a generation later.\n\nThe triptych, still intact, has the format of a portable altar, the inside panels framed, the reverse sides unframed for ease of transport. When closed the triptych shows a remarkably stark image of Christ on the path to Calvary. With the wings open, the central panel depicts the Virgin and Christ Child seated in a meadow, surrounded by six saints.\n\nUnusually, in this representation, Mary is both the Virgin of Humility – seated on the ground – and the Queen of Heaven, encircled by a host of angels with God the Father at the summit. The Virgin in the central panel is set against a gilded mandorla that dominates the painting. Her halo is particularly fine, and within it her crown decorated with pearls and jewels. The mandorla’s highly decorative quality is emphasised by intricate punch work of lines that radiate from a second halo. Brocade robes and decorative embellishments abound, particularly in the figures of the female saints, who are seated around her and all bear their traditional attributes. The four female saints are from left to right: Saint Barbara, holding a model of the tower in which she was incarcerated; Saint Christina of Bolsena, with one of the instruments of her torture; Saint Catherine, beside the wheel to which she was bound and the sword of her execution; and Mary Magdalen, her ointment jar held delicately between her fingers. The names of the two more prominent saints are spelt out in pearls on their crowns. Behind this quartet are Saint John the Evangelist and Saint John the Baptist.\n\nWhen open, the wings depict four scenes from the Passion, chosen deliberately to emphasise, on the left, Christ’s suffering, and on the right, his Resurrection. The Crowning with Thorns is surmounted by The Crucifixion; and, on the opposite side, The Resurrection is painted below The Ascension. The attributes of the male saints in the centre panel would seem to underscore this distinction between Christ’s mortality and his divinity. Saint John the Evangelist holds the chalice with its Eucharistic associations, while Saint John’s lamb is emblematic of Christ’s role as redeemer. The gesture of the Christ Child grasping the golden pearls of his mother’s rosary is at the centre of the painting and is emblematic of atonement. The iconographical intent behind this selection of Passion scenes and Saints would seem to be intensely personal, and may very well have been the specific choice of the patron for whom the triptych was painted. The penitential message of the altarpiece offers a message of both hope and salvation and thus echoes the writings of Thomas à Kempis, who encouraged his followers to ‘assume your cross and follow in Jesu’s footsteps, and you shall enter Eternal Life!’.\n\nThis exceptionally rare work is unanimously attributed to the Master of Saint Veronica. Almost nothing is known about the artist, only that he worked in Cologne in the early years of the fifteenth century. Although some attempts have been made to identify him with recorded Cologne masters, such as Herman de Cologne (fl. 1389–1417) or Herman Wynrich von Wesel (d. c. 1413) none has been successful. His name derives from a painting showing Saint Veronica holding the sudarium, originally displayed in the church of Saint Severin in Cologne and now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich. His work is distinguished by the singular characteristics of the physiognomy of his Saints with their demure, sloping, heavy-lidded eyes and pursed lips, and with the rich colours and decorative patterns of his designs. It has been suggested that he may have worked for a period as an apprentice in the workshop of Conrad von Soest (1370–1422) in Dortmund in Westphalia, for not only do the two artists share several distinctive facial features in their figures but they even have in common some aspects of their workshop practice such as punch marks. From Conrad von Soest it is thought that the Master of Saint Veronica may have introduced the colours ultramarine and lead tin yellow into German practice at this date. The scenes of the Crowning of Thorns, The Resurrection and The Ascension in the present work are derived from compositions of the analogous scenes in von Soest’s Niederwildungen Altarpiece of 1403, now in the Stadtkirche of Bad Wildungen.\n\nThis painting shares a number of features with other works attributed to the artist. The facial features of the Saints recall those of the small angels in the Master’s aforementioned eponymous panel in Munich. The scene of the Crowning with Thorns on the left wing adopts the tiled and chequered floor that we see in the same picture. The Master of Saint Veronica uses this device to give a strong sense of spatial recession, a practice rarely explored in this decorative style. The range of colours in the present work, particular the reds and warm pinks, bear close comparison with the Master of Saint Veronica’s Calvary today at the Wallraf Richartz Museum in Cologne (fig. 2).5 The scene on the wing of the triptych omits the throng around the Crucifix and instead centres on the figure of Christ. In pose and rendering, the treatment of the figure bears a strong similarity to the Cologne Calvary. In the present picture, it is particularly worth noting the thoughtful attention given to the gesture of the Virgin, who is shown holding the edge of her headdress as if about to dry her tears.\n\nA similar figure occurs in the artist’s Crucifixion today at the National Gallery of Art, Washington (above). The same air of tender devotion in which the relationship between the Virgin and Child is explored with particular charm occurs in another triptych, the so called Virgin with the Sweet-pea Blossom in Cologne.\n\nAlthough the Master of Saint Veronica was probably not a native of Cologne, his style and its courtly idiom was clearly perfectly in accord with the aspirations of the patrician classes in a city that had only recently entered a period of peace and stability. His works embodied the International Courtly Style that was elegant and worldly on the surface but was also able to convey the solemnity of its religious content. In the early 1400s Cologne society was concerned with displays of wealth and rank, spectacles of chivalry and the splendour of their churches. They were just as preoccupied with death, eternal punishment and the hope of salvation. Commissions of religious works of art such as this important triptych reconciled the conflicting concerns of profanity and penitence. The Master’s ductile handling of oil paint, the delicacy of his colouring and his softly modelled forms, all of which are exquisitely displayed in the present work, answered this need for a hugely decorative and chivalric style that nevertheless answered the spiritual conscience of the newly wealthy.\n\nA compositionally congested painting featuring a Madonna and (in the Italian Mannerist tradition her improbably large) Child by the 16th century Bolognese artist Nosadella, originally slated for the April 19, 2018 Old Masters sale at Christie’s in New York (but withdrawn), will come up for sale at the auction house’s London location during the July 5, 2018 evening sale. Update – this painting sold for £764,750 (hammer price plus the buyer’s premium – or $1,010,999) against an estimate of £350,000-550,000.\n\nBut, who is this artist?\n\nDetails about Giovanni Francesco Bezzi (c. 1530-1571), called Nosadella (after the street in Bologna on which he lived), are scant and few works survive (he worked mostly in fresco and all the works in that medium are believed to have been lost). He apparently studied with Pellegrino Tibaldi (1527-1596) and, according to some sources, frequently traveled and spent time in Rome. Attributions are based on two accepted works in Bologna, a Madonna and Saints of c.1550 in the Oratorio of Santa Maria della Vita and a Circumcision in Santa Maria Maggiore from the year of the artist’s death (the unfinished picture was completed by Prospero Fontana).\n\nCarlo Cesare Malvasia in Felsina Pittrice, 1678, states: “Those few works of him that are known . . . are distinguished by their good color . . . and are full of erudition. And if they are not . . . perfect and studied, they are perhaps more powerful, singular, and resolute.” The Allen Memorial Museum’s website states: “Nosadella seems to have progressed from a heavy, almost sculptural style indebted to Tibaldi’s idiosyncratic interpretation of Michelangelesque mannerism, to a more refined and naturalistic style in the 1560s, reflecting a more Florentine maniera. While there are some lingering similarities between Nosadella’s mature paintings and works by Tibaldi, they are generally more delicate than the latter’s compositions, which are crowded with powerful forms and taut energy. Nosadella’s paintings show a greater emphasis on linear, decorative qualities, more complex arrangements of drapery, and a greater sense of space within the composition.” Despite this stylistic distinction between Nosadella and Tibaldi, several works have alternatively been attributed to the two artists – and two works have a striking compositionally similarity to the picture at Christie’s.\n\nThe figure of the Madonna, with her head facing toward her right, and her right arm extended diagonally across the picture plane, appears in a couple of pictures – a Holy Family with Saint Catherine (above) at the Capodimonte in Naples given to Tibaldi and the other, a Holy Family with Saint Catherine (above) at the National Museum of Art of Romania, given to Nosadella.\n\nAttributions for other pictures have been debated and changed. The Princeton University Art Museum notes that their Annunciation (above), “once considered a work of the Bolognese master Pellegrino Tibaldi … has now been attributed to Giovanni Francesco Bezzi (called Nosadella), also active in Bologna.” A preparatory drawing by the artist held in a private collection helped secure the authorship.\n\nMeanwhile, the Indianapolis Museum of Art’s Holy Family with Saint John the Baptist (above) has had a bit of an identity crisis. In a 1981 article in Perceptions, Martha Levine Dunkelman compared the Indianapolis painting with the two accepted works in Bologna, and concluded on stylistic grounds that that “there is … little reason to connect the Indianapolis Holy Family to Nosadella” (academia.edu members can access this article). The article does make the case that picture should be given to Tibaldi, based in part on the aforementioned Capodimonte picture. Nevertheless, museum’s website now says the work is by Nosadella and states: “Ignored by the artist-biographer Giorgio Vasari and his contemporaries, Nosadella’s oeuvre has been reassessed only recently by scholars, who have been challenged to distinguish his pictures from those of his master, Pellegrino Tibaldi. Even the authorship of The Holy Family with Saint John the Baptist, now confidently attributed to Nosadella, has oscillated between master and student.”\n\nExamples of the artist’s work can be found at the Allen Memorial Museum at Oberlin University where in 1982 the eminent scholar of Italian Baroque art Richard E. Spear, the museum’s director at the time, facilitated the museum’s acquisition of an elaborate work, The Presentation in the Temple.\n\nThe Getty in Los Angeles has a Holy Family with Saints Anne, Catherine of Alexandria, and Mary Magdalene (above), which they acquired in 1985.\n\nNo telling where the Christie’s picture will end up, but learning about its author and his oeuvre provides insights into the evolution of scholarship and the vicissitudes of connoisseurship.\n\nA recently rediscovered early 17th century Dutch Caravaggesque genre painting and late 15th century Descent from the Cross by a German master have entered the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Dallas Museum of Art, respectively.\n\nDirck van Baburen’s Violin Player with a Wine Glass was featured on the cover of the Zurich, Switzerland-based auction house Koller’s September 22, 2017 Old Master Painting sale. The painting depicts a slightly inebriated musician with a chipped tooth and a glass of wine in his hand. According to the sale catalogue, the work had been in a private Swiss collection for “several generations.” Dr. Wayne E. Franits, who compiled the catalogue raisonné of the artist, authenticated the painting. Estimated at CHF 60,000-80,000, it sold for a hammer price of CHF 500,000 (CHF 595,000 with the buyer’s premium, or about $596,213). The picture appeared in March 2018 in Maastricht during TEFAF at the booth of the Amsterdam and Geneva-based dealer Salomon Lilian, from whom the Cleveland Museum purchased the work.\n\nPaintings by the artist, who died in 1624, one year after the completion of the Cleveland Violin Player, are rare. The catalogue raisonné chronicles “42 authentic paintings, 29 associated with the artist and/or his workshop, approximately 200 rejected works, 18 that are lost, and lastly, 5 drawings that have been linked to Van Baburen directly or related to his paintings.”\n\nThe Rijksmuseum’s biography of the artist states:\n\n“Most of Dirck van Baburen’s (ca. 1594/1595-1624) output is made up of history pieces and genre scenes. Around 1612, having studied under Paulus Moreelse in Utrecht, he visited Italy, remaining until about 1620. In Rome he was commissioned to decorate the San Pietro in Montorio chapel, which he completed with his friend and colleague David de Haen. Van Baburen’s work shows the influence of Caravaggio and the latter’s theatrical use of chiaroscuro. The Italian’s zoom-in effect, portraying subjects half-length, filling the picture, also inspired Van Baburen’s dramatic compositions. Back in Utrecht, he continued to paint in the same style, working closely with Hendrick ter Brugghen. Van Baburen, Ter Brugghen and Gerard van Honthorst became known as the Utrecht Caravaggists.”\n\nThe catalogue for the 1997-98 exhibition Masters of Light: Dutch Painters in Utrecht during the Golden Age (an excellent resource) notes: “Dirck van Baburen died a bachelor and was buried in the Buurkerk in February 1624. He may have been a victim of the plague, which killed hundreds of Utrecht inhabitants that year.”\n\nThe Descent from the Cross by the German master painter Derick Baegert (c. 1440–c. 1509), painted around 1480–1490, is a monumentally scaled panel that is, according the Dallas Museum of Art’s announcement:\n\n“an exceptional example of Baegert’s distinctive style, which reflects the transitional period between medieval and Renaissance painting. As the inaugural acquisition of the Marguerite and Robert Hoffman Fund for pre-1700 European Art, this masterpiece of Northern European painting is the first work of its kind to enter the DMA’s holdings and is the first work by this artist to enter a US museum [emphasis added].\n\n“Derick Baegert was a master of late Gothic painting, and The Descent from the Cross is a spectacular example of the technical and artistic acumen for which he was renowned during his lifetime and beyond,” said Nicole R. Myers, The Lillian and James H. Clark Curator of European Painting and Sculpture. “Beautifully preserved and stunning in its palette and details, The Descent drastically expands the ways we can share the history of medieval and Renaissance art with our audiences. It will be a powerful anchor in the galleries around which the Museum will continue to build its Old Master collection.”\n\nSuccessful throughout his lifetime, Baegert was the head of a family of painters and became the master of a large workshop in the Rhineland area of Germany during the last third of the 15th century and first third of the 16th century. While he borrowed elements from Netherlandish art, his style remained close to that of the late Gothic and reflects a transition from the late medieval period to the early Renaissance. The Descent from the Cross was likely inspired by models produced by such Northern Renaissance masters as Rogier van der Weyden (Brussels, 1400–1464), to whom the work was mistakenly attributed in the early 19th century. At over five feet tall and three feet wide, this impressive, monumentally scaled oil on panel painting illustrates the lowering of Christ’s body from the cross, a subject the artist painted many times. The panel is thought to be the inside right wing of a large altarpiece of unknown origin that depicted scenes from the Passion of Christ.\n\nA master of illusionistic realism, Baegert is known for highly expressive facial depiction and keen attention to minute details, which are evident in The Descent’s protagonists. Their faces possess the detail and individualism associated with portraiture. The Descent also features Baegert’s distinctive organization of space, in which figures are frequently placed on a shallow stage against a distant landscape without a middle ground. Renowned for his great technical virtuosity, Baegert adeptly used compositional elements such as sharply outlined figures and vibrant, contrasting colors to convey narrative drama and the emotional mood of the scene. In The Descent, luminous jewel tones contrast with Christ’s pale body to heighten the dramatic impact of the scene.\n\nBaegert’s paintings reside today in such major international institutions as the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza in Madrid, Alte Pinakotek in Munich, Musée royaux des Beaux-Arts de Belgique in Brussels, Museum für Kunst und Kulturgeschichte, Dortmund, and LWL-Museum für Kunst und Kultur in Munich, which now holds the largest collection of his work.\n\nA Dutch masterwork missing for more than 300 years has been acquired by the Frans Hals Museum in Haarlem, the Netherlands. Gerrit Berckheyde’s earliest known cityscape of his hometown of Haarlem – Gezicht op de Bakenessergracht met de brouwerij De Passer en de Valk (‘View on the Bakenessergracht with the De Passer en de Valk brewery’) of 1662 – has been acquired from a Swiss private collection. In this painting the focus is on one of Haarlem’s most important economic pillars of the 17th century: the beer brewery. Until now, it was believed that the artist’s views of Haarlem were first painted in 1665.\n\nBerckheyde, who became famous for his cityscapes of Amsterdam, the Hague, and especially his hometown of Haarlem, was baptized on June 6, 1638, and died almost sixty years to the day on June 10, 1698, when he drowned in Haarlem’s Brouwersvaart canal.\n\nMadrid’s Thyssen museum’s biography:\n\nHe trained with his elder brother, the architectural painter Job Berckheyde. Together they made a lengthy trip around Germany along the Rhine, visiting Cologne, Bonn, Mannheim and Heidelberg, the city where they worked for the Elector Palatine, Charles Louis. The Berckheyde brothers shared a house and probably a studio. Both worked on the genre of architectural paintings and influenced each other throughout their careers.\n\nGerrit Berckheyde specialised in the depiction of urban views whose accuracy recalls the work of Saenredam. He painted monuments and large buildings located in ample squares in compositions that convey a sense of spaciousness and clarity. He thus differs from the other leading Dutch painter of urban views, Jan van der Heyden, who preferred narrow, angular views seen from canals. Berckheyde’s paintings are marked by their topographical character, apart from those of the city of Cologne in which real buildings, depicted on the basis of sketches made at first-hand, are combined in an imaginary manner. Among his most frequently depicted themes is that of views of Haarlem, which provide a documentary record of the city at that period, and of the Amsterdam Town Hall. Like his brother, Berckheyde painted views of church interiors.\n\nFrom 1661 to 1681 the artist was a member of the society of rhetoricians in Haarlem known as De Wijngaardranken, while between 1691 and 1695 he was an official in the guild of Saint Luke. Despite not having an organized workshop or pupils Berckheyde’s work was extremely influential for other painters of urban views such as Timotheus de Graaf, Jan ten Compe and Isaac Ouwater.\n\nThe Rijksmuseum’s biography for the artist says Berckheyde also studied under Frans Hals, which makes the eponymous museum’s acquisition all the more poignant.\n\nThe cost of this acquisition is unknown, though prices for Berckheyde’s work at auction vary widely. Following the 2008-09 exhibition Pride of Place: Dutch Cityscapes of the Golden Age (at the Maurithuis, the Hague, and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC), A view of Haarlem from the northwest corner with the Kruispoort and St. Bavo’s Cathedral beyond (above), listed in the exhibition catalogue as “present whereabouts unknown” resurfaced at Christie’s in London at the December 7, 2010 sale of Old Masters. It blew through its £500,000-700,000 estimate to sell for £2,617,250.\n\nBy contrast, a scene of Haarlem’s Grote Markt (above) came up at Christie’s in London during the December 8, 2017 Old Masters sale. The work, according to a condition report: “On very close inspection, it appears that, while every element of the drawing and narrative detail remains intact, the overall clarity is compromised by the presence of widespread retouching.” The report goes on to say: “the cumulative effect of this retouching is a loss of definition and clarity, particularly in the sky and cobbled pavement.” The painting carried a £15,000-25,000 estimate and sold for a hammer price of £15,000 (£18,750 with the buyer’s premium). The painting resurfaced five months later at Dorotheum in Vienna at the April 24, 2018 Old Master Paintings auction with an estimate of €30,000-40,000. It failed to sell.\n\nThe painting’s history for the past 300 years has been largely a mystery. The museum’s press release states:\n\nAfter an entry in the beer brewery’s inventory in 1713, the painting Gezicht op de Bakenessergracht met de brouwerij De Passer en de Valk could not be traced, until recently, when it reappeared in a Swiss private collection. It is therefore unique that the Frans Hals Museum has been able to acquire this artwork and publicly display it for the first time. The coat of arms of De Passer en de Valk brewery, located on Bakenessergracht (‘the Bakenesser canal’), is depicted centrally, while the brewer is shown in the shade on the quay of the canal, together with his wife and employees.\n\nWith this beautifully balanced view of the Bakenessergracht, the young Berckheyde demonstrates his exceptional skills. Using his sense of light, form and rhythm, the painter creates great contrasts in his composition. While, on the sunny side of the canal, an ordinary maid silently dips her mop in the water, the shaded side is alive with activity. Beer barrels from the brewery are being loaded onto a boat, while the brewer gives the last instructions for transport. Haarlem was known for its many breweries, and that makes this seemingly casual glimpse of the city’s early modern industry extra appealing. What is remarkable is Berckheyde’s choice to place the brewer and his brewery in the shade and to have the light hit the ordinary servant girl on the right side.\n\nNumerous sources note that Berckheyde’s impression of Haarlem was influenced by Samuel Ampzing’s laudatory, topographical account of the city, Beschivinge ende Lof der Stad Haerlem (“Description and Praise of the City of Haarlem”), published in 1628, which “extolled Haarlem’s magnificent buildings, soaring towers and well-kept buildings, as well as her virtue and glory.”\n\nArtists flocked to Niagara Falls in the 19th century creating a legacy of images depicting the site’s raw natural power and beauty. The falls were painted from numerous vantages: up close; at great distance; and even beneath some of the cascades. Edward Hicks’ depiction is characterized by a dignified folksiness while Fredric Edwin Church created an iconic image that conveys all of the might and thunder with none of the sound. Surfacing at Artcurial’s March 21, 2018 auction of Old Master and 19th Century Paintings and Drawings in Paris is a small panel painting (perhaps from the early 1860s) by the peripatetic 19th century French painter François-Auguste Biard that is strikingly unusual; it shows two Native Americans being swept over the edge into the falls.\n\nBiard was born in Lyons in 1799 and studied in that town’s academy. He was in Paris by 1824 and was met with early success; his travels began in 1827 and took him from Spain to Egypt. His career got a major bump from Louis Philippe d’Orléans who was crowned King of the French in 1830. In 1833 the king purchased two paintings Biard exhibited at the Salon that year. The 1830s saw continued royal acquisitions, awards at the Salons, and finally in 1838 Biard received the Knight of the National Order of the Legion of Honor. In 1839 and 1840, the artist participated in an expedition to the Arctic, which continued to accrue benefits for the next decade.\n\nBiard is grouped by some as kindred spirit with the German Romanticists and the American Hudson River School for his verisimilitude, graphic depictions of wilderness and nature, and the piquancy of his genre painting. Some of his paintings are of a scale that’s almost cinematic and designed to dazzle, delight, enthrall and terrify the viewer.\n\nFive years ago, the Dallas Museum of Art purchased “Seasickness on an English Corvette,” which shows a ship listing to one side and crowded with passengers. A woman reading in the center seems oblivious to her surroundings and fellow travelers, many of whom are seasick (including the companion immediately to her right).\n\nA late-career painting came to auction in June 2017 at Sotheby’s in Paris. It’s also a maritime scene, but the passengers are in even greater distress; in the painting’s foreground we see them stranded on an ice floe grouped around a fire for warmth. Their damaged and sinking ship is in the painting’s middle, and several passengers can be seen frantically signaling to another ship upper middle right. The painting was estimated at € 20,000-30,000 and sold for € 37,500 (inclusive of the buyer’s premium).\n\nThe painting at Artcurial also came later in the artist’s career, though some fifteen years earlier than the shipwreck (above). It was done following a two year stint in Brazil to which Biard traveled from Paris in 1858. He was very popular with the country’s upper echelon, including the emperor, Dom Pedro II. His time there resulted in the 680-page book, published in 1862, Two Years in Brazil that featured 180 engravings based on his original work (this period of Biard’s life is the subject of the book Brazil Through French Eyes: A Nineteenth-Century Artist in the Tropics). He then went to North America and produced paintings on a variety of subjects from train travel to polar bear hunting and slavery.\n\nThe painting on offer in Paris is diminutive when compared with the other paintings shown above and doesn’t have the high finish normally associated with Biard’s work. What has yet to be determined: [1] does this depict an actual event? [2] if this depicts an actual event, is this something the artist was told about or actually witnessed? [3] if yes to the latter, is it a contemporaneous account painted en plein air? and, [4] is this a sketch for a more highly finished version or the only version he created?\n\nThere are several other paintings in the sale of worthy of attention such as Nicolas Tournier’s painting “Midas with donkey’s ears,” Michel Anguier’s Farnese Hercules-like bronze Agitated Neptune, an intriguing French Caravaggesque picture from 1630 depicting Three swordsmen sitting at a table, and several others, but it’s the Biard that I can’t get out of my mind.\n\nUPDATE: Bidding on the painting opened at $70 million. At $90 million the auctioneer announced he could sell the work. Bidding continued in $10 million increments past $200 million (the audience in the room gasped and applauded), then it got interesting. At $288 million, the bidding jumped to $300 million; at $332 million it jumped to $350 million; then $355 million to $370. After 19 minutes and two determined telephone bidders, there was an aggressive $30 million increment that took the picture to a $400 million hammer price ($450,312,500 with the buyer’s fees).\n\nORIGINAL POST: In 1958 a painting of Christ titled Salvator Mundi by the great renaissance master Leonardo da Vinci, the lead lot in Christie’s Post War and Contemporary Art sale in New York on November 15, 2017, was sold by Sotheby’s in London as a work by “Boltrafio” for £45. The picture, which was unveiled as a genuine Leonardo in 2011 at the National Gallery exhibition in London “Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan” following six years of study, is now slated to bring in something on the order of $100 million. Also included in the sale is an outstanding late work by Cy Twombly from the great Bacchus series of paintings, a declarative Franz Klinefrom 1960, an enormous late Andy Warhol based on Leonardo’s The Last Supper fresco in Milan, and the usual assortment of seven and eight figure auction staples by Basquiat and Rothko, as well as Calder, Grotjahn, Serra, etc.\n\nThe inclusion of the Leonardo is a clever bit of marketing and a recognition that the really big money in art auctions can be found at the Post War and Contemporary sales, and not necessarily at the Old Masters. These standing room only sales have become spectacles for “trophy art” buffered by monstrously heavy sale catalogues, breathy and slickly produced online video content, world tours for the top lots (this work was shown in Hong Kong, New York, London and San Francisco), and the post-sale whiff of (momentary) immortality for the successful buyer of the greatest lot. There’s also the Leonardo brand halo that anoints the Twomblys, et al., as art world peers. Sotheby’s and Christie’s have been engaging in cross-departmental sale pollination for several years, hoping to gin up interest in antiquities, Old Masters and other areas of collecting among the ultra-rich contemporary art set and this sale is the (current) apotheosis of this strategy.\n\nThe Leonardo is being sold off, according to the Times of London, “by the businessman Dmitry Rybolovlev as he continues to dismantle what was, for a short period, one of the most expensive private art collections ever assembled.” When the painting was shown at the National Gallery it was owned by R.W. Chandler, a consortium represented by Robert Simon, an art historian and private art dealer in Tuxedo Park, N.Y. The Times article continues: “Mr Rybolovlev, a Russian-born potash oligarch, acquired it during a billion-dollar buying spree over the past decade. In 2014 he and Elena Rybolovleva, his wife for 27 years, divorced and he was ordered to pay her $4.5 billion. That amount was reduced to $605 million before the pair reached an undisclosed settlement in 2015.”\n\nOh, but there’s more: “Also weighing on Mr Rybolovlev’s mind was a dispute with Yves Bouvier, the art dealer who helped him to procure his enviable collection. Mr Rybolovlev alleges that Mr Bouvier made him overpay as he assembled 40 of the world’s most sought-after works for about $2 billion. Mr Bouvier denies the allegation.” Apparently, Rybolovlev is going to lose millions on this: “Mr Rybolovlev is said to have bought it through Mr Bouvier in 2013 for $127.5 million, after it was sold through Sotheby’s in New York for less than $80 million. This year Mr Rybolovlev sold several masterpieces, allegedly for millions of pounds less than he had paid for them in deals conducted through Mr Bouvier. The sale included a Mark Rothko, a Paul Gauguin, a Pablo Picasso and an Auguste Rodin.”\n\nRybolovlev may have ultimately acquired the painting, but a year earlier in mid-2012 the Dallas Museum of Art (DMA) considered buying the work for a purported asking price in the region of $200 million. At the time, Brian Boucher writing for Art in America about the DMA’s interest interviewed New York-based Old Master dealer Richard Feigen, who said: “To me it is not a gripping masterpiece.” Boucher reported: ‘Salvator Mundi has been “very considerably overpainted,” according to the catalogue from the National Gallery’s exhibition, and subsequently “aggressively over-cleaned,” in addition to, at some point, suffering a split in the wood panel, resulting in some paint losses.’ At that time, Boucher indicated that the DMA was not the only museum that had considered the work. By the end of 2012, the proposed sale to the DMA had tanked.\n\nNormally, a painting that seems to be “shopped out” would be a risk at auction; however, this lot, according to the catalogue, has a third party guarantee: “This is a lot where Christie’s holds a direct financial guarantee interest that is backed by a third party’s irrevocable bid.” So, it will go home with someone; the question is, with whom?\n\nOn view through December 17 at the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza in Madrid, Spain, is the recently restored Giambattista Tiepolo painting The Death of Hyacinthus. According to the museum:\n\nIn conjunction with the celebration of the Museum’s 25th anniversary and to coincide with World Pride 2017 in Madrid, the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza is now presenting the results of the restoration and technical study of one of the most important and fascinating works in its collection and probably its greatest gay icon: The Death of Hyacinthus by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.\n\nFollowing its restoration in the Museum’s studios, the painting has now returned to its habitual location in Room 17, accompanied by a special display organised by the departments of Restoration and Old Master painting. This installation includes X-radiographs and infra-red reflectographs which show the most interesting aspects of the work undertaken, explain the methodology applied and reveal the outstanding quality of the painting. These images are accompanied by two preparatory drawings loaned by the Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart and a video of the entire restoration process which also explains the most important discoveries made during this restoration and study project and features interesting details from the painting.\n\nGiven the widespread interest in restoration projects of this type, with this new display the Museum is aiming to introduce visitors to the working methods used by restorers, which are essential for determining the appropriate treatments to be applied in each case and which also provide art historians with important information. Knowledge of the techniques and materials employed by artists is fundamental for deciding on the procedures to be adopted when halting the deterioration of a work of art. Furthermore, focusing on the most detailed aspects of the creation of a work also allows us to enter into the artist’s mind to some extent and that of his/her period and to understand the creative act and its context on the basis of more solid arguments.\n\nThe painting’s history\n\nThe Death of Hyacinthus (ca.1752-53) was commissioned by Baron Wilhelm Friedrich Schaumburg-Lippe, who lived in a town near Würzburg (Germany) where Tiepolo was employed with his sons Giovanni Domenico and Lorenzo from 1750 onwards on the decoration of the residence of the new Prince-Bishop, Carl Philipp von Greiffenclau. The painting seems to have an elegiac nature as a homage to the Baron’s lover, a young Spanish musician with whom he had lived in Venice and who had died in 1751.\n\nThe painting is inspired by an episode from Ovid’s Metamorphoses (Book X, 162-219): Apollo and his lover, the young and beautiful Hyacinthus, Prince of Sparta, were competing at throwing the discus when the latter was mortally wounded when struck on the head by the discus. In the classical account Hyacinthus was killed by his own clumsiness as he threw the discus during the competition but another version recounts that as it was thrown by Apollo, it was blown off course by Zephyrus, god of the west wind, who had been spurned by Hyacinthus in favour of Apollo. Unable to return him to life, Apollo immortalised the youth by making the hyacinth flower sprout from his blood on the ground.\n\nTiepolo depicts the scene on the basis of the Italian translation of Ovid’s text by Giovanni Andrea dell’Anguillara (Venice, 1561), in which the discus throwing is replaced by a tennis match, a fashionable sport among the nobility of the time. In the foreground we see the racquet and some balls cast on the ground and in the background a net that indicates the tennis court. Hyacinthus lies dying in front of the despairing Apollo, who feels responsible for the accident and whose gestures indicate the fateful outcome. Apollo had neglected his duties as a god to devote his time to his lover and Tiepolo reminds us of this by including two of his attributes: the lyre and the quiver with arrows, abandoned on the ground on the left while he shows Apollo himself as a youthful athlete with blonde hair and a laurel wreath. Behind them Hyacinthus’s father King Amyclas and his retinue watch the scene with sombre expressions. Numerous iconographical details emphasise the painting’s symbolic language, from the figure of the macaw, a symbol of courtship, to the mocking expression of the statue of Pan, protector of male sexuality, with Apollo’s hand covering his genitals and his thumb imitating the shape of an erection.\n\nThe composition of the central group was tried out in numerous preparatory sketches by both the artist and his son and assistant Giovanni Domenico. These studies play with the different positions adopted by the two principal figures, bringing them closer together or changing the poses. Other studies feature specific details that were subsequently carefully reproduced in the final version, like the figure of Hyacinthus and the depiction of the small putto in the drawings from the Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart on display in the exhibition.\n\nTechnical study and restoration\n\nThe restoration of The Death of Hyacinthus has essentially focused on the complex elimination of the superimposed layers of oxidised and yellowed varnishes which had accumulated over time. Cleaning the painting has recovered its visual unity and the richness of the original palette with its vibrant, subtly nuanced colours. The architectural features and figures are now also easier to read and the original pictorial depth can once again be properly appreciated. Taking micro-samples of the pigments has provided new information on them and allowed for the materials used by the artist and their state of conservation to be analysed, while gigapixel images and macrophotographs have revealed the tiniest alterations and details of the painting. Ultraviolet and infra-red images have similarly provided valuable information on the creation of the work and the artist’s methods.\n\nX-radiograph:\n\nAn X-radiograph of a painting shows the modifications introduced by the artist during the process of its creation. In The Death of Hyacinthus it can be seen that Tiepolo changed the position of the king, turning him to face the principal scene directly, which resulted in a modification of the folds of his clothing and the position of his arm. Behind this figure Tiepolo added a soldier and also changed the size and shape of both figures’ headwear. In the lower part of the composition it is evident that the straps of the quiver were originally longer. Unlike the other figures, the putto is not visible in the X-radiograph as it was painted with a type of pigment that can be easily penetrated by X-rays.\n\nTiepolo worked more confidently on the right part of the painting, locating the principal figures in a more emphatic manner and with hardly any changes. There are small modifications to the position of Hyacinthus’s arm and Apollo’s thumb, the position of which has been interpreted as an erotic reference. His knee, on which Cupid is leaning, was slightly moved, with the result that the latter’s left hand is suspended in the air. Tiepolo also changed the background motifs as the X-radiograph reveals what might be the sketch of a mountain as well as different architectural structures which he ultimately covered over with clouds or vegetation in order to create a greater sense of space.\n\nInfra-red reflectograph\n\nThis image reveals the preparatory drawing or study concealed by the paint layers and thus the changes introduced into the composition by the artist, some of them also visible on the Xradiograph. In this case it can be seen that the figure of Amyclas originally had a cloth headdress which was then replaced with a hat, while his right hand also reveals some corrections or changes with regard to the final position. The god Apollo appears in the preparatory drawing with some ornamental accessories such as an earring and a belt decorated with a pearl, which were subsequently covered over with brushstrokes of pigment. In addition, his left thumb was not originally superimposed over the figure of Pan as we see in the final painting and some lines of under-drawing are visible that locate Apollo’s knee in a more elevated position and in contact with Cupid’s left hand. Finally, Tiepolo made a slight change to the position of the drapery over Hyacinthus’s leg.\n\nANOTHER POST SALE UPDATE: The National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC has acquired the Casper Netscher featured in this sale, according to the Washington Post.\n\nPOST SALE UPDATE: Today’s sale brought in $17,932,000 (this total includes the buyer’s fees), with 83 of 111 lots selling. A decent opening for the group of paintings restituted to the heirs of Hans Ludwig Larsen with eight of the eleven selling – bidding in the room, the buyer of lot 6 (below) the van Goyen skating scene also picked up lot 3, a Wouvermann landscape, and lot 4, a Berchem landscape. The star lot, the Caspar Netscher, opened at $1 million, moved steadily to $3 million, then progressed at a slightly slower pace selling to an “Anonymous” bidder, as the sale results noted, for a hammer price of $4.4 million ($5,093,000), a world record for the artist. One telephone bidder (listed on the sale results as a “European Institution”) picked up lot 1, a Teniers peasant scene, lot 5, the small Brueghel (below), lot 8, the van Orley (below), lot 9, the Master of the Antwerp Adoration (below), lot 12, a Teniers Adam and Eve that soared past its $300,000 high estimate to hammer at $700,000 ($845,000 with the buyer’s premium), lot 13, another Teniers, lot 15, a Pieter Brueghel the Younger Payment of Tithes, that easily surpassed its $800,000 high estimate to hammer at $1.4 million ($1,685,000 with the buyer’s premium), and lot 22, a Studio of Rubens portrait.\n\nOther notable sales include lot 38, a Ruisdael Dunes by the Sea, which sold for 2-1/2 times its $600,000 high estimate to hammer at $1.5 million ($1,805,000 with fees), and lot 69, a Frans Francken II Temptation of Saint Anthony that went for five times its $30,000 high estimate to hammer at $150,000 ($185,000 with fees).\n\nORIGINAL POST: This elegant “Woman feeding a parrot was, until recently, among the most celebrated treasures of the Von der Heydt Museum in Wuppertal, recognized for decades as one of Caspar Netscher’s greatest paintings and one of the undisputed icons of Dutch genre painting of the Golden Age,” according to the catalogue notes for this lot in Christie’s June 4, 2014, sale of Old Master Paintings in NewYork. Restitution of works looted by the Nazis during World War II is an ongoing process and has brought to sale many works previously thought permanently off the market. No doubt there will be more. This work was restituted to the heirs of Hugo and Elisabeth Andriesse.\n\nOf this lot, Christie’s notes:\n\nBest-known today as a painter of exquisite, highly finished domestic interiors, Caspar Netscher in fact produced surprisingly few before abandoning the genre altogether around 1670 for the more lucrative field of portraiture. A Dutch painter of German origin, Netscher was probably born in Heidelberg in 1639. He trained first in Arnhem under Hendrik Coster, a little known still-life and portrait painter, before moving in 1654 to Deventer, where he entered the workshop of the greatest genre painter of the day, Gerard ter Borch. Netscher quickly learned Ter Borch’s technique of rendering the texture of costly materials, and he is known to have made very successful copies of his master’s most recent works: a signed copy of Ter Borch’s Parental Admonition (1654; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), dated 1655, is in Schloss Friedenstein, Gotha, for example. That such works were allowed to be fully signed by Netscher suggests the special place he held in his master’s studio.\n\n[…]\n\nAs [Marjorie] Wieseman [author of the catalogue raisonné of the artist’s paintings] observes, the birds were often associated with luxury and sensuality, and “their central role in scenes of women holding or feeding parrots hints at amorous or erotic elements.” Moreover, she adds, “a bird freed from its cage – in Netscher’s painting, lured away with a bit of sweet – was often a symbol of lost virginity, and was associated with an invitation to amorous dalliance,” a reading that seems hard to dispute in light of our young lady’s coquettish but bold and inviting gaze. Interestingly, Wayne Franits has cited instances in which “the presence of parrots…signifies the proper training of their mistresses.”\n\nA superb preparatory drawing for the painting, in pen and bistre wash over black chalk underdrawing, is in the British Museum … The drawing, which was in the collection of Gabriel Huquier in Paris in the 18th century, is fully signed and dated 1666. Like his teacher Ter Borch, Netscher was an active draftsman and about 45 sheets from his hand survive. As with the study for Woman feeding a parrot, most of his drawings are modelli or compositional designs.\n\nThis delightful rendering of a raucous carriage ride was also recently restituted, in this case to the heirs of Hans Ludwig Larsen, having been in the Stichting Nederlandsch Kunstbezit, The Netherlands, since January 15, 1946. From the lot notes:\n\nThis charming scene, showing a group of rowdy peasants en route to a wedding celebration, exemplifies the lighthearted and often humorous observations of everyday life for which Pieter Brueghel II was – and remains – renowned. Even in its small size, this vignette reveals a wealth of anecdotal detail: seven peasants have crowded into the rickety carriage, pressed together so that one at the front has to wrap his arms around his knees to fit inside, while the two nearest the viewer seem poised to fall backwards over the edge. At center, a particularly boisterous woman raises a wine jug high in the air, perhaps to keep it away from her obviously eager companion, who may have already had too much. Stumbling around the back of the cart, a man in a red cap with his back to the viewer rearranges the bridal gifts, aided by another fellow who moves a three-legged stool – a common motif in Brueghel’s paintings – out of the way. The cart, which might more usually have been drawn by a driver in an enclosed cab, is pulled by two sturdy horses that seem just to have felt the sting of their rider’s whip.\n\nAs with the previous lot, this work too was recently restituted to the heirs of Hans Ludwig Larsen, having also been in the collection of the the Stichting Nederlandsch Kunstbezit, The Netherlands, since July 8, 1946. From the catalogue:\n\nBeginning in the mid-14th century and lasting through the mid-19th century, Northern Europe experienced extraordinarily cold and long winters, and relatively cool summers, a period of climatic change known as the “Little Ice Age”. The resulting snows and frozen waterways had a significant effect on everyday life. The Dutch quickly adapted, inventing a variety of winter activities which could provide outdoor amusement despite the bitter cold. By the 17th century, winter landscapes filled with frolicking figures such as the present panel had become a beloved staple of Dutch Golden Age painting.\n\nHere, Van Goyen represents villagers skating on a frozen river beside a group of thatched houses. The town church is visible in the background, and charming vignettes abound. At far left, two children chase one another behind an elegantly dressed couple who may be their parents. Just to their right, four passengers huddle together for warmth inside a sleigh while the driver sits on the edge, watching his horse delicately negotiate its way across the ice. At right, another man bends over to adjust the straps on his skates, while at center, four men skate toward the viewer with varying levels of grace and skill. One of them rests a long, thin poll on his shoulder, which he could use both to keep his balance and to help himself out of the water if he should fall through the ice, a relatively common occurrence.\n\nThis, too, was restituted to the Larsen heirs, having been in the Stichting Nederlandsch Kunstbezit, The Netherlands, since January 15, 1946; it was confiscated by the German authorities following the occupation of The Netherlands, after May 1940.\n\nThe painting’s authorship is in dispute, Max Friedländer considers it autograph, as did Ludwig Baldass in 1930. However, JD Farmer:\n\nconsidered this painting to be the work of a clearly identifiable hand distinct from Van Orley, yet very close to him. This artist, whom he christened “The Brussels Master of 1520,” tends to paint his figures with idiosyncratic, at times awkward poses and may have led a small, independent workshop that produced paintings most reminiscent of Van Orley’s style of the late teens, while demonstrating a familiarity with the master’s work through the thirties. Farmer hypothesized that The Brussels Master of 1520 may have even been related to Van Orley, suggesting the artist’s brother, Evrard, as a plausible candidate.\n\nRaphael’s Spasimo di Sicilia (Prado, Madrid) serves as the chief form of inspiration:\n\nIndeed, there are strong parallels between this painting and Raphael’s design, which Van Orley would have encountered when its cartoon was sent to Brussels to be woven as a tapestry for Cardinal Bibbiana between 1516 and 1520. The most immediate source for the present painting, however, was surely Van Orley’s own interpretation of Raphael’s design as it appears in the Northern artist’s Christ Carrying the Cross cartoon, which he created for Margaret of Austria’s “square” Passion tapestries of c. 1520-1522 (Patrimonio Nacional, Madrid), and which was later rewoven for the Alba Passion tapestries of c. 1525-1528 (Museé Jacquemart-André, Paris). Van Orley also took inspiration from the work of Albrecht Dürer, with whom he was personally acquainted: in 1520, Van Orley hosted a dinner party with Dürer as his guest. As in Dürer’s Christ Carrying the Cross from the Large Passion prints of c. 1497-1500, in the present panel the main focus is not Christ’s interaction with the swooning Virgin, but rather the miracle of the Sudarium, the holy cloth held by St. Veronica.\n\nYet another work restituted to the Larsen heirs, having entered the Stichting Nederlandsch Kunstbezit, The Netherlands, on the same day as the previous lot, this painting was originally part of an altarpiece that was divided, with this panel cut down from it original rectangular format.\n\nWhen conceiving this composition, The Master of the Antwerp Adoration was likely inspired by Albrecht Dürer’s print of The Sojourn of the Holy Family in Egypt … from the Life of the Virgin series, begun in 1500. As in Dürer’s woodcut, the Virgin sits in the foreground attended by angels and embroidering a garment on her lap. Also similar is the bearded Saint Joseph at her left, carving out a long piece of wood. In Dürer’s print, Joseph is surrounded by jovial putti who frolic about, picking up the shavings and placing them into a basket. In the Larsen painting, it is the Christ Child himself who assumes this role.\n\nThe Master of the Antwerp Adoration has incorporated symbolic imagery in the painting in a manner typical of Netherlandish art of this period. The fanciful architecture in the background, together with the dense wood and columned structure on the right, suggest that the Holy Family resides within a hortus conclusus, that is, an enclosed, sacred precinct dedicated to the Virgin. Two angels fill silver pitchers with water from an elegant fountain in the courtyard, which together with the garden itself symbolize the immaculate purity of the Virgin. This imagery derives from the Song of Solomon as interpreted by Saint Bernard, who read the biblical love poem as an ode to the Virgin as the Bride of Christ. By the time panel was painted, the juxtaposition of the fountain, or “well of living waters”, the enclosed garden, and the Virgin was well-established in Netherlandish art. Indeed, it appears in Jan van Eyck’s famousMadonna at the Fountain of 1439 (Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp). In the present Holy Family in a garden, a peacock appears in front of the fountain. An exotic bird of paradise, it would have been understood in the artist’s time as a symbol of Christ’s immortality and the Resurrection. The cross formed by Saint Joseph’s plank and the wooden board beneath it is in no way accidental, but rather deliberately refers to Christ’s Passion. Likewise, the pincer in the foreground alludes to the tool that was used to remove the nails from the Cross after Christ’s death. Thus, within this everyday scene of familial tranquility and harmony, The Master of the Antwerp Adoration subtly alludes to Christ’s future sacrifice, creating a beautiful composition that rewards prolonged contemplation.\n\nFrom the lot notes:\n\nThe anonymous artist known as the Master of the Dominican Effigies is named for a panel showing Christ and the Virgin with seventeen Dominican saints and beati, or “blessed ones”, now in the Archivio di Santa Maria Novella, Florence. Recent scholarship has improved our understanding of this previously understudied painter, who appears to have been one of the most important figures in Florentine manuscript illumination in the second quarter of the 14th century. The Master’s style, which blends the influences of artists from the prior generation – such as Lippo di Benivieni and the Master of San Martino alla Palma – also looks to the work of some of his slightly older contemporaries, such as Bernardo Daddi and Jacopo del Casentino, resulting in what Professor Laurence Kanter describes as “an animated and highly personal expression of his own” (see L. Kanter et al., Painting and Illumination in Early Renaissance Florence, New York, 1994, pp. 56-57).\n\n[…]\n\nThe Master’s eponymous work can be dated to just after 1336 based on its inclusion of Maurice of Hungary, who had died that year, though the artist was certainly active well before then, probably from c. 1310. His last securely dated work is inscribed 1345, but a double-sided altarpiece in the Accademia, Florence (inv. 4633/4) may date to somewhat later. The present intimately-sized, portable triptych is a marvelous example of the miniaturist precision and narrative expression that characterizes the Master’s style. Datable to c. 1330, the triptych is a remarkable survival from an important phase of the artist’s career, showcasing his understanding of the achievements of Giotto and the founders of Tuscan painting.\n\nThis is a very entertaining genre picture is by the talented Gerard ter Borch. From the catalogue:\n\nLikely originating in the work of Jacob Duck, the theme of a soldier being tickled awake was treated once more by Ter Borch in a composition dated to around 1656-1657 and now in the Taft Museum, Cincinnati … although in that instance the culprit takes the form of an attractive young woman. While such amusing scenes were intended to delight viewers, they were probably also meant as cautionary reminders of the importance of maintaining military vigilance. Indeed, despite the peace with Spain, the Netherlands remained vulnerable in the 1650s, especially along the German border, where forces spreading Counter-Reformation doctrine needed to be kept in check."
