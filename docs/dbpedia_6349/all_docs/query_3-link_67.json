The duke very much liked the location and wanted to rest here far from the turmoil and disappointments of the world. This palace also has a series of so-called cavalier’s buildings – the resting place of the duke’s servants. Today it houses the Academy Castle Solitude.\n\nThis palace has strong Rococo and Neoclassical architecture. The most beautiful and notable feature of this palace is the White Hall (Weisse Saal).
