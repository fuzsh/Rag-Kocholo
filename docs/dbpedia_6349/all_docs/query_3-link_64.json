He studied architecture at the Architectural Association (AA) in London, receiving his diploma in architecture in 1977. He worked in the offices of several notable architects, including Douglas Stephen, Norman Foster and Richard Rogers, before founding his own firm, David Chipperfield Architects, in 1985.As a young architect Chipperfield championed the historically-attuned, place- specific work of continental architects such as Moneo, Snozzi and Siza through the 9H Gallery situated in the front room of his London office.\n\n5.  David Chipperfield established David ChipperfieldArchitects in 1985. He was Professor of Architecture at the StaatlicheAkademie der Bildenden Künste, Stuttgart from 1995 to 2001 and Norman R. FosterVisiting Professor of Architectural Design atYale University in 2011, and he has taught and lectured worldwide at schools of architecture in Austria, Italy, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In 2012 David Chipperfield curated the 13th InternationalArchitecture Exhibition of theVenice Biennale. CAREER\n\n7. Style and Philosophy  Chipperfield's buildings cannot be described as following one particular style, although his work is sometimes seen as a reaction against the more flamboyant projects of Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid or SantiagoCalatrava. In 2005, he told Christopher Hall of the NewYorkTimes, \"I'm very interested in doing buildings that people are fond of, but with each project I also try to push the boundaries, to make something familiar but different. I'm not so interested in convincing the architectural community that I'm a genius.\"\n\n8.  Known for his modernist and Brutalist design principles, British architect David Chipperfield has become renowned the world over for his visionary work—he was even knighted for his service to the world of architecture. His firm’s first major project was the linear River and Rowing Museum on the RiverThames, and from there he developed an oeuvre of civic buildings with a keen eye for space and functionality, including the renovation of the Neues Museum in Berlin, and the HepworthWakefield Gallery and theTurner Contemporary, both in the U.K. In addition to his architectural contributions, Chipperfield has also lectured on the subject in both the U.S. and Europe, enlightening a new generation of architects with his singular take on beautiful, functional structures.Take a spin through some of his most iconic buildings across the globe.

It was completed in just eleven months.The distinctive features of the 10,000 square meter building are three horizontal levels which overhang the terrace below by as much as fifteen meters, providing shade and an unobstructed view of the sea.The predominant color inside and out is white, with panels of white metal on the ceilings, floors of white resin, and exterior trim of white- painted stainless steel. Exterior accents are provided by planks of wood\n\n19. TheMuseumof ModernLiteraturein Marbach,Germany  The Museum of Modern Literature is located in the town of Marbach,Germany, the birthplace of the poet Schiller. and benefits from a panoramic view of the Neckar River. It is located next to the beaux-arts building of the national Schiller Museum, built in 1903, and a more modern building of the German Literary Archives, from the 1970s.Visitors enter through a pavilion on the top floor and descend to the reading rooms below.While the lighting on the interior is entirely artificial, to protect the manuscripts, each level has a terrace overlooking the countryside.The facades of concrete, glass and wood are designed to give the impression of both solidity and modernity.The building was awarded the Stirling Prize in 2007.\n\n22. TheDesMoinesPublic Library,Iowa(2002– 2006)  The Des Moines Public Library in Des Moines, Iowa, covers an area of 110,000 square feet, and cost 32.3 million dollars to construct.The two- story building has no front or back; instead it fans out into three wings. a glass tunnel allows passers-by to stroll through the library.

TheNeuesMuseum, Berlin(1997–2009)  In 1997 Chipperfield, along with Julian Harrap, won a competition for the reconstruction of the Neues Museum in Berlin, which had been severely damaged duringWorldWar II. His commission was to recreate the original volume of the museum, both by restoring original spaces and adding new spaces which would respect the historic structure of the building. Reinforced concrete was used for new galleries and the new central staircase, while recycled bricks were used in other spaces, particularly in the north wing and the south dome. In addition, some of the scars of the war on the buildings walls were preserved, as an essential part of its history.As Chipperfield explained, \"The new would reflect that which was lost, without imitating it.\"The building received the European Union Prize for ContemporaryArchitecture in 2011.\n\n32. TheHepworth Wakefieldgalleryin Wakefield,UK(2003– 2011)  The HepworthWakefield is a gallery devoted to the work of the sculptor Barbara Hepworth.

Its windows have views of the river, historic waterfront and the city skyline.The building's façade is clad with self-compacting pigmented concrete made on site, the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. The architects selected the material to emphasise the gallery's sculptural appearance."
