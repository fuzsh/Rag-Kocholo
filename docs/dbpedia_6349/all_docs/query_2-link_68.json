        "text": "1. in the\n\n2. As we began 2021, I thought of sharing a new monthly piece that captures the trials and tribulations of the Covid-19 pandemic that we had already endured through 2020. As TS Eliot wrote in Four Quartets: “For last year’s words belong to last year’s language And the next year’s words await another voice. To make an end is to make a beginning.” Although we have entered another new year, 2022, the fact that Covid has lingered so long, it is likely to leave some lasting changes in the way we live and work. When speaking of changes, how can we not think of Ovid’s Metamorphoses, full of legends and parables from Greek and Roman mythology that capture fantastical transformations in response to circumstances. Inspired by Ovid's Metamorphoses, here then is a compilation of my thoughts on the Covid pandemic and the changes that we were witnessing through 2021, when I shared these as monthly pieces on my blog. I decided to title it Ovid in the Time of Covid and I hope it will be a more tolerable way for us to remember these pandemic times. Time it was, when ill winds blew Through the city of Wuhan in eastern China; Another of the factory-to-the-world cities few Would have given a second thought to. How came it then, that people there were so afflicted With an illness that was said to be respiratory? In a matter of days, millions were infected Until they imposed a lockdown that was mandatory. At first, all anyone knew was that it was a new virus, But where it came from, none could say. They said it was like SARS and MERS and yet it was different As it rampaged through city and province, day after day. They said it all began in an animal food market Where creatures of all kind are each day slayed To be delighted in, as a feast upon the table; Now in home after home, people for deliverance prayed. Rumours spread like wildfire while we waited for the facts, And the virus carried upon the wind, here and everywhere, Wreaking Chaos in its path from China across the world; They said it would go away with the warmth of the summer air Stay away from each other they said, do not step out; Speak not too loud, if you must speak at all. The virus was on everyone’s lips and not always for the right reasons; Who could tell when, where, or who would be next to fall? (Inspired by Chaos in Ovid's Metamorphoses)\n\n3. Chaos ’twas called ; a rude unfeatured mass, A mere vast weight inert, discordant seeds Of ill-matched things in one huge heap compressed.\" – Chaos, Ovid’s Metamorphoses Book I, lines 9-11 \"The waves in search of foreign climes ; and men, Save their own shores, no other region knew.\" – Chaos, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Book I, lines 118-19 Chaos by George Frederic Watts (circa 1875), courtesy Wikimedia Commons.\n\n4. Chaos has visited before as we know only too well; Wars, plague and influenza, these we have already seen. Wreaking havoc in land after land, laying everyone low She goes by many names, this time she is Covid-19. Like the ones that came before she has us in her vice-like clutch, We should never forget why the pandemic began; Blaming each other and foreign lands don’t do much, Chaos is here because of the excesses of man. Meanwhile cities began to look like ghost towns, Emptied of life, day as deserted as night. But if you gazed upward at the sky and saw the shade of blue, O ne’er did the world see such a beautiful sight. They said dolphins returned to the lagoons in Venice And the birds sang louder across the world; Why then, did the air around the virus get murkier, And why did the rumours still swirl? People complained they couldn’t breathe or even smell, Scientists said that humans caught the virus from a bat; The symptoms were experienced but the fact still is It’s our asymptomatic lifestyles, and what we do about that. Those who could, worked and met on Zoom, For millions of others, it seemed the death-knell; Work from home became reality not just a trending hashtag The world had never seen a worse kind of living hell. Covid-19 on the other hand has crossed the seven seas; The virus no border knows, it doesn’t discriminate. Though the rich living in Elysian fields continue to lament The loss of freedom, and the restrictions they love to hate. The poor have no luxury of such thought for they are the chosen ones; With no work and nowhere to hide or go And with no room in hospitals and care homes either, Covid-19 simply seeks them out and deals her deathly blows. We know not how this will end nor when Suffice it to say that our lives we must amend Then and now, now as then.\n\n5. At first in the city of Wuhan, people stayed indoors Not knowing why or wherefore, this deadly virus came All they heard, all the time, was stay away, stay apart If you want to keep out of this virus’ deadly game. Soon people stopped meeting and greeting each other It was as if to do so would be a curse Don’t speak, don’t touch, stay away was the mantra Anything else would only make it worse. But nothing could stop Covid-19 from rampaging on It was in the air, in your breath, and it hung there for hours If you spoke too close, or too loudly, your words uttered it Without your ever meaning to send forth droplets and showers People simply caught it, and many never showed a sign Despite all the rules of social distancing It was indiscriminate, cruel, and unforgiving In fact, it was all the while, physical distancing. Back at offices, desks were set even farther apart And fist or elbow bumps replaced the handshake A smile or a nod was alright, from two metres away We’re back together, people thought, what difference does it make? But a difference was felt and experienced all the while To look someone in the eye, but speak through a mask ‘Twas hard to tell a smirk from a smile, O’, never for this did the world ask. People took to the internet, and over the cyber-waves Met, conversed and chatted about Covid-19; How it had changed their lives, yet how little it mattered Consoling themselves, perhaps believing this was always destined. Lockdowns suddenly meant more time on one’s hands But with every hour, work expanded to fill all that space Work from home became a trending hashtag, While the search for a vaccine, a global race. Across the world, there were no places to meet Restaurants and bars were closed for months Some shuttered forever, along with theatres And people wondered if they could step out, just this once. Shut inside their homes, they searched the internet desultorily To be sure, there were concerts, ballets and plays streaming Some exulted while others complained and groaned If this is what is meant to give our lives more meaning. People who worked in certain businesses were dismayed Their lives teetering on the edge of when The lockdown will end, or the vaccine be found And whether they will still have their jobs then For their work depended on people being able to meet Person-to-person and face-to-face Covid-19 had cast such a spell, a curse, There seemed little chance of reviving social grace. (Inspired by Diane and Acteon in Ovid's Metamorphoses)\n\n6. Enough, O comrades, for to-day of spoil Hath Fortune given: with blood of slaughtered beasts Our nets and weapons reek. To-morrow morn Aurora from her saffron car shall see The chase renewed.” - Actaeon in Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Book III, Lines 172-176 “Her beauties sidelong turned, with wrathful look Askance upon the intruder. Oh! for one Of all her arrows now! The neighbouring stream Supplied the want. With vengeful hand she dashed Against his manly cheek and o’er his brow The gathered drops, and terrible his doom Foreboding—” Go! ” she cried, ” and, if thy tongue “ Can shape the tale, tell how thou sawest once A Goddess naked!“ - Actaeon and Diana in Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Book III, Lines 217-225 “Poor fugitive! He flies the very followers whom his cheer Was wont to urge, along the very tracks Himself so oft pursuing trod! And ” Hold! “ He would have cried—” Actaeon I! your Lord! “ Do ye not know me? “—But the words refused His will. The baying of the eager hounds Rang deafening.” - Actaeon in Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Book III, Lines 269-276 Diana and Actaeon by Titian from Wikimedia Commons\n\n7. Through the raging pandemic, there were some Who paid no heed to all the warnings out there. ‘Twas beneath their dignity to wear masks or stay away Do we know any, that acted like they didn’t care? When this is all over and the pandemic ends When vaccines are here, and the pall of gloom is lifted We know not how many will remain our friends But we hope that many with better sense will be gifted. The Death of Actaeon by Titian; Image: Wikimedia Commons\n\n8. When first the ill winds from Wuhan blew Carrying with them, the strains of the coronavirus Few thought it was anything more than a flu And that with warmer weather, it would soon be behind us. The WHO warned that people should take heed Of new rules like mask wearing and social distancing But there were some who thought there was no need To sacrifice their freedoms for a phase that was only passing. Listen, to those who understand the science Listen, to those gasping for breath Can we not see the millions falling to the virus, Simply by being in company, by stealth? Pray listen to the voice of reason as it speaks From time-tested knowledge of what we know not Else all become easy prey, to disease Listen to the words of experience, it’s all we have got. The skies roiled with clouds of despair The winds carried the virus to newer lands The seas roared as if the virus was calling from its lair While the scientists toiled with their heads and their hands. There were some studying the cause of the virus And how it jumped from animals to man And others were creating vaccines to save us If only the world would stay home until then. Listen, to the wise folks conducting their clinical trials See hope rise like the morning sun Stages 1, 2 and 3, in tiny doses and vials Too bad, it still wouldn’t save everyone. Every now and then, the grumbling voices in the dark Would rise to celebrate their freedom and right to roam free Make no mistake, these were no cries of the lark These were those who simply refused to see. Try as they did to drown the voices of reason and hope They could not stop the steady march of science It was more than the unbelievers could cope with But this is not how the story ends For with entire families, kith and kin Cities, states and countries were affected The virus seemed to be more vicious on the darker of skin As they lived in neighbourhoods most congested. Like the search for a vaccine, orders too were a race Countries placed orders like there was no tomorrow Vaccine makers simply couldn’t keep pace They regretted it would cause more sorrow. The science skeptics were joined by the anti-vaxxers Who would wax eloquent on its imagined threats Prevention or poison, which you preferred Depended on who you listened to, only hastening the deaths. (Inspired by Deucalion and Pyrrha in Ovid's Metamorphoses)\n\n9. For I, believe me, if the wave Had whelmed thee, wife beloved, in that same wave Following had whelmed myself ! Oh, that I now That art paternal knew, to people fresh The Earth, and give to plastic clay a soul! Now in us twain alone remains the race Of mortals—so the Gods have willed. We two Survive, the sole example of Mankind.” Deucalion to Pyrrha in Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Book I, Lines 422-429 And “Oh,” they say, ” if ever prayer sincere Had power to bend or win the Gods, or soothe The wrath of Heaven, tell, Goddess dread, what art May mend this ruin of our race, and, kind As powerful, aid us in our sore distress!” Deucalion and Pyrrha in Ovid’s Metamorphoses Book I, Lines 440-445 “Then, not unmoved, the Goddess spake “Depart “My shrine, and, with veiled head and vest ungirt, Behind you fling your mighty Mother’s bones! … But, pondering long The hidden meaning of the oracular voice, Dark with mysterious phrase, Prometheus’ son Some comfort spies, and, cheerful, to the child Of Epimetheus— “Or my judgment fails, Or this mysterious bidding of the Gods May well be done—for Heaven commands no crime. Our mighty Mother is the Earth : — these stones Upon her surface strewn the Goddess calls, Methinks, her bones—’tis these she bids us fling.” Deucalion and Pyrrha in Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Book I, Lines 440-461 Deucalion and Pyrrha, a sketch by Peter Paul Rubens from Wikimedia Commons\n\n10. O listen, do listen to the voices of reason immense They can alleviate suffering and cure us all O listen to the advice that makes good sense And before the virus, we need not fall.

Deucalion and Pyrrha by Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione, Image: Wikimedia Commons\n\n11. ‘Tis been over a year now that The Covid-19 virus has ravaged the world Laying everyone low and flat In its path, through which it whirled Entire cities were forced into lockdown Not once, not twice, but time and again The poor were forced out of job and town While the rich it seems had plenty to gain. Like Daedalus, many said they would fight To be free and roam wherever they pleased In the markets the rich found their flight And they wove their dreams of golden fleece Poor ordinary folk, cramped into the city’s Nooks, crannies and crevices, teeming Consoled themselves with ditties That others thought was day-dreaming. The rich worked from home, or wherever they wished They lived their lives on the internet. The poor, whether they farmed or they fished Or worked in factories, you could always bet Had no choice but to get to work To earn their livelihoods If they were lucky to keep their work And look after their broods. And that is not all that they suffered For their employers were forced to down shutters If not because of a lockdown, one heard Then because there were no customers. Many were at the mercy of bosses And their plans of staying open Who, considering they were looking at losses, Were probably wondering when. The wealthy and privileged stayed home Cocooned in their nests, freshly feathered With the spoils of the stock-market boom Wondering when more would come their way, not whether. They made plans for their next generation scions And future growth trajectories Not realizing that consumer demand of days halcyon Came from people working in their factories. Meanwhile, scientists dazzled the world With their brilliance, and delighted over the world’s first Covid vaccines, But over the next few weeks, what unfurled Told of pharma companies’ and rich countries’ greed. Oh, we can’t possibly make many more At the rate that we first projected And we can’t send any to other shores Until our own are fully protected. (Inspired by Icarus from Ovid's Metamorphoses)\n\n12. Daedalus, at exile chafing now Too long, and yearning for his native shores, The Sea in Crete held prisoner. “Land and wave” He cried, ” deny me way! But Heaven above Lies open! Heaven shall bear me home! All else May Minos bar—he cannot bar the air!” The story of Icarus in Ovid’s Metamorphoses Book VIII, Lines 209-214 So spake he, and to arts unheard-of yet, Passing the force of Nature, bent his thought; And wings he framed, from short to longer quill With gradual slope expanding, – as the Swan Fits to his rustic pipe the unequal reeds, — With thread the longer binding and with wax The shorter, to such arch, as curves the wings Of very birds, inclined. The story of Icarus in Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Book VIII, Lines 215-222 Then he taught the boy Their use: and “Midway keep thy course,” he said “My Icarus, I warn thee! or, too low, The damps will clog thy pinions, or, too high, The heat relax them. Midway hold thy flight, Not dare too near to soar where Helice Shines dangerous, or Bootes, or the sword That decks Orion’s glittering belt. By mine Thy course direct!” The story of Icarus in Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Book VIII, Lines 230-238 The Flight of Icarus, by Jacob Peter Gowy (1635-37) from Wikimedia Commons\n\n13. Many poor countries haven’t received their vaccines While rich ones are flying full-steam ahead To protect their elderly and frail by all means Poor, coloured people, probably not yet. India has billions at home to inoculate And vaccines for the world galore The world’s richest country is in such a state Stars and stripes, they don’t mean much anymore. Blondel's decoration of the Rotunda Apollo at the Louvre, depicting The Fall of Icarus, Image: Wikimedia Commons\n\n14. Now, when the virus raged through many a land Gripping everyone it could touch, Such that few escaped its feverish hand People were bound to make much. They appealed to every person they met Oh, save us please, with whatever You have and can set To deliver us from this forever. The scientists invented miracles in their labs And had words of advice to proffer The world waited to receive vaccine jabs It seemed there simply wasn’t enough on offer. Meanwhile, hospitals were running out Of vital, life-giving, oxygen Prolonging the raging virus bout Nobody could say for how long, or when. We can’t breathe, said Indian patients on life-support Sending authorities into a tizzy Please send O2, cried doctors who were holding fort While chaos turned into a frenzy. Entire cities were gasping for breath Medicines and vaccines in short supply Seemed there was no hope but death From a virus mutant raging high. Virus? What virus, tis only a flu Said some leaders in high places Second wave? Not in India, cannot be true We drove it away said some with poker faces. No oxygen? What about the funds that we So carefully raised and disbursed? Of course, we care, can you not see It’s best you stay calm, lest it get worse. Meanwhile virtual conferences were on in full swing Meetings of leaders presiding over our fates Summer, autumn, winter, or spring Hoarding vaccines well beyond their use by dates. India, the world’s vaccine supplier Would now be funded by the Quad To make vaccines for countries, including the poorer Wouldn’t that be great, good god. It’s easy to throw money at the problem Much harder to share ingredients and know-how It’s each rich country first, As we all know by now. And as the leaders their images burnish, In love with their accomplishments Let us not our minds furnish With undue praise and compliments. (Inspired by Narcissus from Ovid's Metamorphoses)\n\n15. “All grace of form and colour, lily and rose Due blended :—and each charm, that ever moved The love of others, loves. Himself inspires His passion :—all he praises is his own. Wooing and wooed, the flame he yearns to raise… Yet finds, and burns for what he sees, though what He sees he fails to recognise, nor knows What error ’tis that cheats and fascinates His eyes.” The Story of Narcissus from Ovid’s Metamorphoses Book III, Lines 508-520 “The clearing wave that colour mock, nor more Endured it, but, as waxen torch dissolves Beneath the flame, or frost of morning hoar Melts in the breaking sun, so, passion-worn And with that inward fire consumed, his frame Wasted and faded into naught – nor charm Remained of lily and rose, nor strength, nor use Of limb, nor vestige of that form which moved” The Story of Narcissus in Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Book III, Lines 584-591 “And now they would have buried him The pile, the torch, were there – but where’s the corpse? A flower alone was all they found, whose heart Blazed golden ‘mid a circlet of white leaves.” The Story of Narcissus from Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Book III, Lines 610-613 Narcissus by Caravaggio (1594-96); Image: Wikimedia Commons\n\n16. For vain are populist leaders, who feign Care and devotion for their populace We know ‘tis only for electoral gain, And fear of falling from grace. Who knows what new flower will sprout From millions of lesser mortals’ funeral pyres And the tears that fell all about; Will it be the coronavyres? Echo and Narcissus by John William Waterhouse, Image: Wikimedia Commons\n\n17. Now, as the coronavirus ravaged the land, Another kind too was at sway The kind that never warns us and Only draws us towards the meteoric way Driven by greed and gluttony It makes us consume all we desire With never a thought for the progeny It is today, that we must climb higher. In the old days, man worked in factories Producing goods that we all needed Now, he tends to animals as an industry Fattening them for the overly well-fed. Our farms work for meat factories Let there be no doubt Wonder what people will do for stories When this pandemic is out. Little wonder, our rivers run dry And our forests are aflame Our land not to till for man, but why Oh why, for animals to tame. Earth scorching, ice caps melting And seas that rise ever higher Drown our cities unforgiving Leaping on the other side, are forest fires. Perhaps they will tell them of how Loudly the birds sang, when we Were indoors for months on end, and now, For fear of Covid and he, she, you and me. Perhaps they will tell them about Dolphins swimming in our waters Skies so blue we only dreamed about While cattle on our streets did saunter. These roamed free, but not the ones on ranches Fattened for the greed of man and slaughter For them, entire forests are mowed down in tranches What a drain they are on both land and water And the air, oh it will fill with methane And gases more poisonous than CO2 If we aren’t rightly weighing our losses and gain More pandemics like Covid will be ours to rue. Bedtime tales are all very well How the pandemic ends Depends, though no one can quite tell On who to whose will, bends. Man and earth, they must Have a new contract, Else all will be dust; There’s no better time to act. (Inspired by Phaeton in Ovid's Metamorphoses)\n\n18. Scarce uttered was the promise, when the youth Demands his father’s car, and, for one day, The rein and guidance of its winged steeds. Then rued the God his oath, and thrice and once Shaking his radiant head, ” Alas! thy speech “Proves mine too rash!” he cried, “Would yet my boon “ I could deny, for thou the one sole thing “ Hast asked I would not grant thee. O my son, “ Let me dissuade, if not refuse. Thy wish ” Is fraught with peril! ‘Tis no little thing” Thou seek’st, my Phaeton! a trust for heads “ And years like thine unfitting. Mortal, thou “ Immortal function dar’st affect, and more “ Than all Heaven’s Gods may venture. The story of Phaeton from Ovid’s Metamorphoses Book II, Lines 56-69 The ruin… Ganges warmed, And Phasis, and Danubius. All thy waves Alpheiis, boiled and bubbled, and thy banks, Spercheius, glowed. Tagus his golden freight Rolled melted to the sea… To the world’s utmost end Fled Nilus, burying deep in earth his head, Ne’er since to light restored; his mouths remain, Rivers no more, mere valleys, dry with dust. The Story of Phaeton from Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Book II, Lines 274-296 But loud he thunders, and, with right hand high Uplifted, on the hapless charioteer Lets fly the bolt of fire, and hurls him down Headlong at once from car and life, and quells The fires with fire more potent. Terror strikes The steeds, and backward hounding from their necks The yoke they dash, and spurn the broken reins … here what fragments else Strewed piecemeal of the car.

The middle kingdom from where the pandemic began Celebrates a hundred glorious years of its party While the rest of the world reels as the virus fans In successive waves, as it proves to be too crafty. The country is back on its feet again, and trade Too is healthy with demand soaring The growth is real and unlikely to fade While debt too is growing. Elsewhere too, countries are once again opening Their doors and stepping out While they also welcome those travelling Vaccinated and unlikely to catch a new bout This has caused many a conflict between The vaccinated and those in line The leaders and the largely unseen The unwell and those fine. In India, the numbers of cases are on the rise With our large population, it is to be expected With new daily cases at 50,000 is it any surprise That the virus is nowhere near defeated. In fact, more vaccines are needed than Manufacturers can supply It is not a question of if, but when The vaccination rate will fly. Like it has in several other countries From Israel and US to UK and Europe Helping them relax the travel freeze Bringing millions new hope. However, conflict continues to rumble Between political leaders of various stripe Those who don’t want covid mandates grumble While others shrug off those not their type. There are serious matters to do with work About returning to the office or not Companies keen to retain their work culture And those who don’t give a jot. Women who have lost their jobs or else Had to stay home for their children’s sake With schools and colleges shut There is simply too much at stake. The numbers of unemployed are rising While employers can’t find people They need, and if that’s not surprising There is the digital technology pull Meanwhile the virus lingers Long enough to keep people worried It attacks when one least expects it Vaccination, it has to be hurried. (Inspired by Pentheus from Ovid's Metamorphoses)\n\n20. ... or piecemeal torn I see thy scattered limbs; these woodland shades, Thy mother’s self, and all her sisters, red And reeking with thy gore! Thou hear’st thy fate! For well I know thy madness will deny The Deity his right. But, in that hour, Remember how a Seer, though blind, could see!” The Story of Pentheus from Ovid’s Metamorphoses Book III, Lines 622-633 “Time proved his truth, and what he spake fulfilled. For Liber comes, foretold. With festal mirth Of thronging crowds the fields resounds, the press Still thickens : wife and maiden, man and boy, Noble and churl, in those new rites to share, All emulous and eager. “Hold!” the voice Of Pentheus shouts, “what madness thus, what rage “ Misleads you, you from that old Snake who sprang Warriors from birth?” The Story of Pentheus from Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Book III, Lines 636-644 Agave’s glance was first To mark him: first, with frenzy fired her hand The thyrsus whirled, and, by a mother’s blow First wounded bled the son! “Io!” she yelled, “Io! help, sisters both! The Boar is here That wastes our fields! Help me the boar to slay!” With answering yell around him swarms the band Shrieking and striking! … Yet still he rears his trunk dismembered “See,” Mother! “he shrieks, “’tis I, thy son!” … Whirls scattered, so his body, limb from limb, By that mad rout lay piecemeal rent and torn. So, by that lesson taught, the maids of Thebes The might of Bacchus learned, till now unknown, And on his altars smoked their incense due.

Many a month flew by in every land From Wuhan in China to Europe and America; Yet time stood still, unmoved its frozen hand Similarly in Asia, Africa and Latin America. For, while people thought the virus gone, It was back in a new variant before long; And so it was that Covid-19 was born Several times, in waves, sweeping the world along People began to tire of all the tests, And keeping track of the daily new cases; They stayed home since it was best To avoid catching the virus, Or passing it on, Even if inadvertently; No one could think it gone Not even unwittingly. The world had to find names for the variants, For how else could anyone tell which was which; Alpha, beta, gamma, delta, The last one like a spell cast by a witch. It’s been galloping around the world Since being detected in India, March 2021 And infecting people in its whirl; Oh, it simply won’t leave folks alone. Vaccines are the only hope of keeping it at bay, But not all countries and people have the jab; So, we just stay home and stay away While pharma scientists work away at their labs. It has taken our freedoms away, Turned us into creatures of stone By the time it has had its way It would have worn us down to the bone. Countries are trying to find a way around it, Lockdowns are local, and restrictions eased; With every slight improvement in the numbers affected The general mood rises, thinking at last, peace. Till some new outbreak strikes terror in people’s hearts And crestfallen, they retreat into their shells Frozen in time and space; no, this is no frieze art, Everyone wonders when the end of this hell. Imagine some countries in perpetual lockdown, With no hope of vaccines ever reaching; Not enough at any rate for every town And every person help beseeching. They will perhaps be locked down forever Stuck in their homes, condemned To live their lives out hereafter Frozen in time, in lands damned. (Inspired by Perseus from Ovid's Metamorphoses)\n\n23. And Perseus answering told How ‘neath the snows of Atlas lay a spot, Fenced round with solid rampart of thick wall, Beside whose entrance dwelt the sisters, twain Of Phorcys born, who with alternate use Between them shared but one sole eye, and how That orb, from one to other passed, his hand… And rugged rock, and shaggy wood, to where Their Sister-Gorgon dwelt; and, on that path What lifeless shapes of men and beasts he saw By glance of Medusa petrified… The Story of Perseus from Ovid’s Metamorphoses Book IV, Lines 919-931 “Yourselves will have it so! ” He cried “Then meet your fate! What was my foe Must friend me now. Comrades! If comrades yet I have turned hence your eyes!” And from its shroud The Gorgon-Head he drew. “Hence! Mountebank!” Cried Thescalus, “On fools and children try “ These juggling tricks!” And, as his lance he poised, In act to whirl, the man a statue stood! The Story of Perseus from Ovid’s Metamorphoses Book V, Lines 226-233 Nileus, who from old Egypt’s seven-fold flood Claimed lying origin, and on his shield, In silver part wrought and part in gold, Seven rivers bore, came next. “Behold ” he cried “The badge that speaks my parentage! And bear To Hades all such solace as thy Death From hand like mine may yield!” The later words Were choked in utterance; and the marble lips, Open to speak, to no more speech gave way.

A virus so deadly and yet never seen Except under the microscope Can ravage entire lands, so mean Is its effect, no matter your horoscope; Initially, people thought it worse on the elderly; Later as it continued to spread It attacked people of all ages cleverly, People lived in constant dread.

The lands in the West looked forward To the vaccines that would deliver Relief from the virus, and toward Days more normal, as ever. The doctors and nurses too endeavoured To help patients recover Day and night, they persevered In selfless pursuit forever. In the East, though, something worse was brewing A variant of Covid called Delta Which, in no time, was spreading As quickly as a wild fire. It spread the pandemic in a new wave Taking it to many shores The vaccines for now would keep us safe Who knew how many waves more. Meanwhile, economies reopened for business And people returned to work Central banks kept pumping in money And that did wonders for stocks. The wealthy indeed got wealthier While the poor struggled to get by Entire industries had been torn asunder Joblessness still unusually high. The jobs making advances Were those nobody wanted With Delta still avoidable Why would anyone take chances. Some hailed the return Of labour’s bargaining power But with technology on quick-burn No telling who would have the shining hour. Poorer countries fared no better Few had access to enough vaccines As rich countries talk of a booster The poor haven’t had the first jab in. Which raises an ethical question For governments and pharma companies In the West, since they form the bastion Of controlling the supply of vaccines. If the rich believe they come first They are sadly mistaken For the wealth bubble can burst Not so the power of healing. The virus is global and that’s a fact None is safe until all are protected Makes sense to donate through Covax And progress together, unimpeded. (Inspired by Midas from Ovid's Metamorphoses)\n\n26. Glad for the Sire restored, the grateful God For guerdon bade the Phrygian name and have What wish he would, nor knew how thoughtless greed Could mar and useless make so fair a boon. Grant,” quoth the eager King, ” whate’er I touch May turn to gold! And that pernicious gift So pledged the Godhead granted, sad at heart To find the fool lack wit for wiser choice. The story of Midas in Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Book XI, Lines 127-134 Rich beyond hope and wretched past despair Loathing the wealth he cannot choose but coin, Cursing the boon that but an hour ago He prayed for, stood the wretch, his hungry maw Unfed, his fevered gullet parched with thirst, Starving, with torment not unmerited The story of Midas, Ovid’s Metamorphoses Book XI, Lines 165-170 The kindly Godhead heard the fault confessed, Nor loth to cancel what but for the faith Of promise pledged he ne’er had ratified, Revoked the boon, and set the suppliant free. Yet this, he said, “ere of this golden-taint Self-sought thou purge thee thoroughly, must thou do: Seek out the stream that flows by Sardis’ walls; And, facing still its downward course, ascend The steepy hills that bank it, till thou reach Its source, and where the fount flows freest plunge Thy head, and cleanse thy body and thy guilt! “ The story of Midas, Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Book XI, Lines 176-186 The Judgement of Midas by Andrea Schiavone (1548-50), of Midas judging a music contest between Apollo and Pan; Image: Wikimedia Commons\n\n27. More than a year has passed Since the virus first struck Unsuspecting people everywhere massed Against an enemy without any luck. Until science came to the rescue And helped armour us with vaccines Giving medicine its full due Never did the world see such vulnerable beings. Waves of the pandemic spread from here to there There was no escape it seemed for mankind Through travel and contact, the virus trapped us in its lair What terrible loss of life, millions trapped in such a bind. Delta proved the most hardened variant No fight against it was tough as steel It spread the fastest against the most valiant Fighting it became our Achilles’ heel. Like Achilles who couldn’t kill Neptune’s son The conventional way, we too will have to try Ways beyond vaccines, even with boosters done Even though borders are reopening, beckoning us to fly. Staying masked, distant and at home As much as our life permits Is the life we are getting used to Living like digital nomads or hermits. Never assuming we’re invulnerable Or invincible in this fight Defence can sometimes be a form of attack Avoiding confrontation and the plight. Reducing the chances of contracting What can be a lethal virus Hoping that mitigating its transmitting Might eventually deliver us. Other measures require our consideration Like boosting our immunity levels Meat consumption too calls for moderation All ways of keeping away the evils That we have allowed to ruin our lives And the planet we depend upon Time to reexamine our lives And urgently reduce the harm we pass on. That doesn’t mean vaccines ought to be ignored Nor should we dismiss the virus as a seasonal flu On the contrary we need to produce and share much more A cavalier attitude just won’t do. If it is long Covid we are destined for, so be it. Let us at least defend our health It requires all of us to do our bit, Fighting the dreaded enemy with stealth. (Inspired by Achilles and Cygnus in Ovid's Metamorphoses)\n\n28. Sigaeum’s strand was red with gore: — the Son of Neptune, Cygnus, with a thousand deaths Had thinned the Grecian host, when through the ranks Of Hion, from his car with Pelian spear Wide dealing death, Achilles crashed, and, chief With Hector or with Cygnus hot to cope, With Cygnus first encountered, Hector’s fall To the long war’s last year, the Fates deferred. Achilles and Cygnus from Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Book XII, Lines 99-106 Cygnus cried “Contemptuous, that thy weapon draws no blood? This helm whose nodding horse-hair fans my brows, This shield whose bossy burden loads my arm, Are but mere warrior-trappings, borne for show, Not need. So Mars for ornament alone Superfluous harness wears. Strip me of all This idle casing, and invulnerable “ I front thee still – of no mere Nereid born…” Achilles and Cygnus from Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Book XII, Lines 116-124 Fierce from the battered helm the thong he tore, And tight below his chin, with strangling noose Compressed, all issue choked of breath and life; And would have spoiled the course, but lo! a shell Of empty arms was all his triumph found! Cygnus had vanished, by his Sea-God Sire To that white bird transformed that bears his name! Achilles and Cygnus from Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Book XII, Lines 191-197 Achilles’ mother, Thetis, dipping him in the river Styx, by Peter Paul Rubens ( 1625) at the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam; Image: Wikimedia Commons\n\n29. As the Covid-19 pandemic waxed and waned Through the many months, as though they were seasons There were indeed some who deigned To fight it with the forces of reason Others too content to spread fear Denied it was ever a problem When it got out of control, dear, They pretended it was indeed solemn. What the rest of the people were To make of the confusion that reigned Was enough to spread more fear Than was necessary to contain A virus so virulent and lethal It struck entire populations hard Both physical and psychological No effort could be spared, from the start. The brave ones were at work Quietly in their lab coats and protective gear They were not willing to shirk Efforts that could save lives each year. Every day, week and month chimed As if on a clock It was a race against time The one thing that wasn’t in stock. The fight was also between lockdowns And reopening economies for business Vaccines attracted both relief and frowns When they were the route to success Against this mighty adversary That would not be tamed It soon became necessary To fight variants, no matter how named. Leaders of rich countries wanted booster doses And their little ones to be vaccinated When poorer countries hadn’t had their first doses And the pandemic was exacerbated It didn’t matter how hard the brave fought This was simply the way it had to be All their valiant efforts come to nought Because the rich must have their way, you see. Not to be deterred, the pharma companies Simply keep churning out new drugs The rate of new discoveries Is, of course, hard to shrug When not enough have access to them What should the heroes do? Fall on their sword at the helm, Like Ajax was wont to do? Inspired by Ajax in Ovid's Metamorphoses\n\n30. He cried “Before your ships ye judge this cause, And, with those ships in sight, Ulysses dares To stand my Rival! Where was he, when fierce With torch and brand raged Hector on the shore ‘Twas I who saved them—I who drove him back!” The speech of Ajax from Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Book XIII, Lines 6-11 Can vouch no witness save himself and Night. ‘Tis no mean stake we play for—true: —but this, My rival, cheapens it! whate’er its worth Poor toast it is to me to bear away A prize that such as he may hope to win: — And for Ulysses more than praise enough “ That, beaten as he was, the world shall say He coped with Ajax! — For myself, if deeds Were lacked or valour doubtful, birth and race Speak trumpet-tongued…” The speech of Ajax from Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Book XIII, Lines 17-27 What folly bids thee seek This worse than useless prize? If, sore misled, Greece held thy claim the better, of what boot Would be the boon —To make thee robbed, not feared; Thy foes would spoil and mock thee! Or thy speed In flight—wherein above all living men I hold thee paramount, and there alone, “Would fail thee, weak with that heroic weight! The speech of Ajax from Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Book XIII, Lines 144-151. Sorrowful Ajax by Jacob Carstens (1791) from Wikimedia Commons\n\n31. And so it was that two years went by With the pandemic showing little signs Of slowing, but raging on high Past the ever-watchful eyes of science It almost seemed to cock a snook at them Saying catch me if you can Oblivious to all the mayhem It had already caused and fanned. Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Lambda We might soon run out of letters in our lexicon As the coronavirus dares us Delta and now, the Omicron How many more aliases will it take For us to find a proven cure? How many more disguises can it make Before we call it out for sure? Two years of this never-ending ordeal We can count them simply as 730 days Or 300 million worldwide as ill as they feel And over 5 million deaths Whichever way one looks at it It is laying too many lives to waste We can’t choose to ignore it Act, and we can never be accused of doing so in haste. Medicines, they’re being invented every day The vaccines too are having their effect However, too few are making their way To the poorest people to make any impact Africa is once again the continent That the world is forgetting to include In the vaccination footprint And we know the results of that can be rude. In a globalized world, it takes nothing For a virus to travel the world And everyone in its path, it is infecting Spreads it to everyone else they spoke to, or heard Right now, it is believed that Omicron Is highly transmissible If Africa is where it came from Should vaccine inequity be permissible? Like the plague of Aegina We too need myrmidons among us Who will step forth and endeavour Through care and thoughtfulness To spread the benefits of medicine Equally across the world For each plague and pandemic has its lesson To teach and to unfurl. Inspired by the Plague of Aegina in Ovid's Metamorphoses\n\n32. With direful plague The wrath of Juno smote the isle that bears Her hated Rival’s name. While yet the ill Seemed such as man might cope with, nor its cause Was known, with all resource of healing art We met it; but its deadly force o’erpowered All skill, and baffled Medicine fled the field. The story of the plague of Aegina from Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Book VII, Lines 645-651 When care might naught avail, the multitude Gave licence to the burning thirst that raged Within them: prostrate by the founts and streams Or round the wells they grovelled, swilling Death In greedy draughts, and, impotent to rise, Died in the wave they drank, that not, even so Polluted, scared fresh thirsters from its flood! The story of the plague of Aegina from Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Book VII, Lines 692-699 The new-born subjects hailed their King! To Jove, Due thanks I paid; —my desolate town, my fields Untilled, were stocked afresh: —and Myrmidons, In memory of their origin, I named The race. Thyself hast marked their port: —they keep The habits of their birth, a frugal tribe, Inured to toil, that wastes not what it wins, But stores it, provident of future need.
