        "text": "in: Journal for Art Market Studies, Vol 2, No 1 (2018) The structural development of commercial galleries and, more generally, of commercially used spaces for the presentation of art works as a historical architectural challenge in the first place should become an integral part of our perception. When the magazine Die Kunst spoke of “Art Dealer Palaces” in 1913, a prime example was Munich. This article will aim at reconstructing a multi-layered image through historical sources, in particular contemporary articles and reviews from architecture magazines or art journals. In fact, buildings and interiors of art dealers were passionately discussed during this period, and in some cases were even regarded as highly controversial. Several case studies will illustrate the extent to which the individual elements of presentation – wall, floor, ceiling, light, furniture, artworks and their frames were subject to a thorough revision in 1900, and the extent to which the interior design of commercially used exhibition spaces not only matched the staging concepts of museums and the Secessions, but were in fact closely linked to the idea of the museum reform movement and even established a modern private exhibition practice. While the article captures trends and peculiarities that in turn may allow conclusions to be drawn for the history of exhibition strategy in general, there is a need for more in-depth research of this neglected subject.\n\nThe beginning of this century will undeniably be remembered as the museum's golden era. Since the museum boom which started at the end of the eighties, the role of the museum in modern society has been ceaselessly questioned, and the museum's position reevaluated. New museum buildings act as important urban catalysts of postindustrial cities, and possess ambitious aesthetic mechanisms, which affect the way in which the architectonic form expresses itself in order to reconcile the increasing functional and representational complexity of the contemporary museum. Museums illustrate the evolution of architecture and an accelerated transformation of trends in architecture, which can run either in parallel or in counteractive directions, but most frequently, in complete opposition to each other. With numerous examples of museum architecture, continually created from the end of the eighties to the present, one would imagine and even expect an enormous diversity in museum typology, but this is, in fact, only an illusion. A stunningly large number of museums find their retreat in a re-rendering of a few renowned museum archetypes (Durand's layout, Schinkel's Altes Museum scheme, Leo von Klenze's Alte Pinakothek stairs), but it seems that, in current mass production, only two characteristic typological trends can be recognized: the museum as a spectacular and \" unrepeatable \" architectonic form, and the museum as a neutral repetitive container or multifunctional box. In this paper, these two most proliferative and antipodal trends in contemporary museum architecture are analyzed, and their ability to satisfy the primary (though not necessarily the only) function of the museum – establishment of visual communication with objects of cultural and scientific significance exhibited within-is discussed.\n\nThe unique character of a present-day conservator lies in the rare combination of working at an academic level with your head and at a craftsman level with your hands. This has not always been the case. Historically the role of a restorer was that of a technician, craftsman and artist, while that of the museum curator was that of a thinker, writer and academic. This article focuses on the relationship between the curator and later director, Arthur François Emile van Schendel, and the paintings restorer Henricus Hubertus Mertens. Both started their careers in the museum in the early nineteen-thirties. Van Schendel’s interest in restoration and technical research may have been kindled at that time, but was fanned during the war, when he worked with the museum’s two paintings restorers – Mertens and his colleague Christiaan Jenner – to preserve the paintings collection under difficult circumstances. After the war, Van Schendel continued to develop in this field and quickly became an in..."
