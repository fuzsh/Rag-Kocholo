In 1971, art historian Linda Nochlin asked a now famous question, “Why have there been no great women artists?” The answer was not immediately clear, but was instead a mix of factors from lack of available training, restricted gender roles and even the way “the artist” was conceptualized in culture that provided barriers to women. Feminism and Feminist Art\n\n7. Feminist Art 1).Asserted that the “domestic crafts” and things that were traditionally “women’s work” were ﬁne art. 2).Made political artwork criticizing social structures that excluded women. 3). Searched for a feminine view of history and art. i.e. Rewrite the list of famous artists. i.e. Look for examples of matriarchal societies. 4). Proudly represented the female body in its complexity.\n\n8. Craft vs. the “Fine Arts” Craft Functional “Commercial” Dependent Skill-based Female? Fine Arts Only Visual Non-commercial Autonomous Idea-based Male? “While there are many objects that are excluded from the category of ﬁne art whose makers are male, those objects of domestic use whose creation was predominantly the occupation of women were all marginalized by this category and its attendant values (Parker and Pollock 1981)”\n\n9. Miriam Shapiro, Heartfelt, 1979. Feminism and Feminist Art Feminism was a social and political movement in the 70’s that paved the way for more diversity in art and recognition of women artists.This image combines painting and ”female craft” to state that postmodern art offers diversity in media and style, but also in gender.\n\n10. \"Gates of Paradise,\" by Miriam Schapiro, 1980 Feminism and Feminist Art\n\n11.

Womanhouse, (1972) was the ﬁrst project of the newly-established Feminist Art Program at CalArts. Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro, working with their students took over an old mansion in Hollywood for installations and performances exploring women’s domestic space.

Once the house was prepared, the women turning the rooms and spaces of the house into artworks that addressed personal issues gleaned from their own experiences as women, including housework, mothering, the gendered division of labor, aging, and menstruation. A major inﬂuence for the artists was Betty Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique (1963), which challenged societal expectations that relegated women to the domestic arena. Womanhouse was the ﬁrst feminist work of art to receive national attention when it was written about in Time magazine. The project was groundbreaking in American art in ways that can be seen to dovetail with emerging Post-modernism. Except for a few pieces, the work was destroyed after completion. Feminism and Feminist Art\n\n16. At completion, Womanhouse had 18 installations, including three bathrooms, two closets, a nursery, the kitchen, the stairway, and the garden. Some of the best known of these are Menstruation Bathroom and Nurturant Kitchen.The latter focused on the drudgery of housework as well as societal expectations regarding the role of women as nurturers within the family dynamic. While installations such as Leah’s Room included performances, the living room was reserved for the presentation of a series of performances including The Cock and Cunt Play and Waiting.The former was a ribald but honest look at how housework was traditionally assigned to men and women based on essentialist notions about the body.

Womanhouse: Lea's Room: woman applying and reapplying makeup Lea's Room, 1972 Clothing and costume also played a crucial role in Leah's Room, created by Karen LeCocq and NancyYoudelman. Inspired by the novel Chéri, Colette's story about an aging courtesan, this heavily perfumed bedroom was ﬁlled with antiques .A woman (LeCocq) slowly and silently applied cosmetics and then removed them, causing many women to weep openly as they observed the performance.\n\n19.

Essentialism: The practice of regarding something (as a presumed human trait) as having innate existence or universal truth rather than being a social or ideological construct. This early feminist art was essentialist; it focused on women’s bodies and deﬁned gender in biological terms. i.e. A feminine “essence”, the way to be female. The second wave of feminist art deﬁned gender in more relativist terms. Feminism and Feminist Art\n\n25. Judy Chicago,The Dinner Party, 1974-1979. Feminism and Feminist Art\n\n26. Judy Chicago,The Dinner Party, 1974-1979. Feminism and Feminist Art Judy Chicago’s The Dinner Party is a large, complex, mixed-media installation dedicated to hundreds of women and women artists rescued from anonymity by early feminist artists and historians. It took ﬁve years of collaborative effort to make, and it drew on the assistance of hundreds of female and several male volunteers working as ceramists, needleworkers, and china painters.The Dinner Party is composed of a large, triangular table, each side stretching 48 feet; Chicago conceived of the equilateral triangle as a symbol of both the feminine and the equalized world sought by feminism.Along each side of the table are 13 place settings representing famous women— 13 being the number of men at the Last Supper as well as the number of witches in a coven.\n\n27.

Carolee Schneemann, Interior Scroll (1975 Feminism and Feminist Art Performance Feminist art also sought to reclaim the female body as a creative force, not as something to be covered up. Whose use could be deﬁned by women themselves.\n\n33. For Schneemann’s performance Interior Scroll (1974), the artist ritually prepared herself for the action, ﬁrst by undressing, wrapping herself in a sheet and reading from her book, Cézanne, SheWas a Great Painter, while taking action poses similar to those of a life drawing model. She then outlined her face and body in strokes of paint, before slowly extracting a long, thin scroll of paper from her vagina. As she unfurled the scroll she read its contents to the audience; it was a narrative, taken from a conversation with a ﬁlmmaker (a woman), who associated the artist’s works with irrational, unstructured content and process—the feminine. The action of pulling the scroll from her vagina represented a reclamation of personal control over creative production. Feminism and Feminist Art Performance\n\n34.

Feminism marks a sharp break from Modernism. It showed that abstract art was largely an aloof creation of the male dominated art world ill equipped to practically help women. Abstract art couldn’t help more women get shows, or work to free women from restrictive gender expectations. What was needed was a more socially engaged art form. For women to be acknowledged they needed to try and ﬁnd their own contribution. Feminism was Postmodern in that it looked into the past to ﬁnd examples of women in art. In this way Feminism was an important example for future art movements. Feminism and Feminist Art\n\n43. Postmodern Architecture PROBLEM: Thought Modernist architects had ignored human needs in their quest for uniformity and function. SOLUTION: •New architecture should address the complex mix of “high” and “low” architecture. •Should embrace past architectural styles •Began to re-apply decoration to buildings. “Less is more,” but “Less is a bore.”\n\n44.

RobertVenturi Model date: c. 1959-62 Postmodern Architecture While writing his treatise on Postmodernism, Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture (1966),Venturi designed a house for his mother that illustrated many of his new ideas.The shape of the façade returns to the traditional Western “house” volumes and shapes that Modernists rejected because of their historical associations. Its vocabulary of triangles, squares, and circles is arranged in a complex asymmetry that gives up the symmetrical rigidity of Modernist design. While the curved molding over the door is simply decorative. The most disruptive element of the façade is the deep recess over the door, which opens to reveal a mysterious upper wall (which turns out to be a penthouse) and chimney top.\n\n47.

Stirling combines materials of the past, travertine and sandstone, with colored industrial steel throughout the museum as a way to pay respect to the art and design of the 19th Century by developing a relationship with modern materials resulting in a uniquely Post Modern museum.\n\n59.

Postmodern Architecture in Chicago In 1987, Beeby and his ﬁrm (then Hammond, Beeby & Babka) designed and built the new Chicago Public Library, the Harold Washington Library Center (1987–91). The building is contextual architecture, in this case the Neo-classical traditions of 19th-century Chicago. With its grand arched windows, overhanging cornice, and ornate Neo-classical details such as swags and towering ﬁnials, the Library Center formed a controversial contribution to Chicago’s architectural landscape. The top portion and most of the west side, facing Plymouth Court, is glass, steel and aluminum.The roof is a pediment that harkens to the Mannerist style. In 1993, seven ornamentations on the roof were added.The decorations on the Congress andVan Buren sides are seed pods, which represent the natural bounty of the Midwest. Others show owls, representing the Greek symbol of knowledge, perched in foliage.\n\n64. Harold Washington Library, Hammond, Beeby and Babka Architects,1991 Postmodern Architecture in Chicago\n\n65.

Postmodern Architecture Santiago Calatrava - Milwaukee Art Museum, 2001\n\n67. The Milwaukee Art Museum, which overlooks Lake Michigan, was partially housed in a building designed in 1957 by Eero Saarinen as a war memorial. Santiago Calatrava proposed a pavilion-like construction conceived as an independent entity.The white steel-and-concrete form is reminiscent of a ship and contrasts the existing ensemble in both geometry and materials. Being linked directly to Wisconsin Avenue via a cable-stay footbridge, pedestrians may cross busy Lincoln Memorial Drive on the bridge and continue into the pavilion. The pavilion features a spectacular kinetic structure, a brise-soleil with louvers that open and close like the wings of a great bird.When open the shape also becomes a sign, set against the backdrop of the lake, to herald the inauguration of new exhibitions.The pivot line for the slats is based on the axis of a linear mast, inclined at 47 degrees, as a parallel to the adjacent bridge mast.

Appropriation: or use of “readymade” images or art objects allows for the examination of the meaning of those objects or forms. Used largely by the “Pictures Generation” artists.\n\n73. Marcel Duchamp, Fountain, 1963 replica of 1917 original. “Readymade”: an everyday object used as art. Marcel Duchamp Dada: anti-modernism\n\n74. Appropriation art challenges traditional ideas about authenticity, individuality, copyright laws, and the location of meaning within a work of art. Levine’s urinal is taken directly from Duchamp’s ready- mades, though he did not cast his urinal in bronze, but used an existing, ordinary porcelain urinal. Levine’s fountain is a precious presentation of the work from the previous master. Appropriation has been likened to the similar trend in music— samples or remixes. Levine found a source in the examples of 20th-century art, appropriating verbatim from such modernist luminaries as Walker Evans,Willem de Kooning, Piet Mondrian, and Edward Weston. Feminist critics have interpreted the performative nature of Levine’s work, in which she assumes the identity of an artistic predecessor, as a subversive intervention in the rigid (and overwhelmingly male) construction of art history.

Still there is a solution. He can say \"As Barbara Cartland would put it, I love you madly\". At this point, having avoided false innocence, having said clearly it is no longer possible to talk innocently, he will nevertheless say what he wanted to say to the woman: that he loves her in an age of lost innocence.” -author Umberto Eco Appropriation\n\n82.

Art critic of the time Douglas Crimp wrote in 1977 of the appropriation artists of the “Pictures Generation” that, “They are not in search of sources of origins, but of structures of signiﬁcation: underneath each picture there is always another picture.” Artworks in this case were “signs” pointing to other meanings, mostly stereotypes.Whether of gender, race or class.

Barbara Kruger, Untitled (We don't need another hero), 1987 Feminist Art in the 80’s\n\n87. Third-wave feminist art emerged in the 1990s.This latest generation of artists has addressed a plethora of other issues that discriminate against or denigrate women, including such hybrid ones as gender and class, gender and race, violence against women, postcolonialism, transgenderism, transnationalism, and eco-feminism. Third-wave feminist art explores the many strategies that women employ to navigate life. In photograph-based images Barbara Kruger examines the representation of power via mass-media images, appropriating their iconography and slogans and deconstructing them visually and verbally.

Feminist Art in the 80’s In UNTITLED FILM STILL #21 for instance, Cindy Sherman appears as a small-town girl who has moved to the big city to ﬁnd work. Other photographs from the series show her variously as a Southern belle, a hardworking housewife, and a teenager waiting by the phone for a call. Critics have discussed these images in terms of second-wave feminism, as questioning the culturally constructed roles played by women in society, and as a critique of the male gaze. In these photographs, Sherman is both the photographer and the photographed. By assuming both roles, she complicates the relationship between the person looking and the person being looked at, and she subverts the way in which photographs of women communicate stereotypes.

MANY MANSIONS by African- American painter Kerry James Marshall (b. 1955) refers to Stateway Gardens, Chicago, one of the largest housing projects in America. The inadequate conditions were the subject of much debate prior to its demolition in 2007. Marshall shows an idyllic setting of three African-American men, who are too well dressed for gardening, to create an tidy garden that includes manicured topiary in the background and ﬂowerbeds in the foreground.The painting includes a number of details, including the statement “In my mother’s house there are many mansions,” which both changes the gender of the biblical quotation (John 14:2). Two cute cartoon bluebirds with a baby-blue ribbon ﬂy into the scene like the birds that bring the fairy godmother’s gifts to Cinderella in rags in the Disney ﬁlm, while two Easter baskets neatly wrapped in plastic sit in the garden.The artist takes a swipe at the fact that the condition of the projects was studied and then ignored by the authorities by labeling his own picture “IL2-22” (“Illustration 2-22”) in the upper right Identity Art\n\n152.

Felix Gonzales-Torres was an American sculptor and photographer of Cuban birth. In 1987 he joined Group Material, a NewYork-based group of artists adhering to principles of cultural activism and community education. His own engagement as a gay man with socio-political issues centered around the interaction of public and private spheres. His stacked-paper work consists of two stacks of sheets printed with the bracketed words of the titles, neatly piled to resemble Minimalist ﬂoor sculptures. By inviting gallery visitors to take the sheets, Gonzalez-Torres undermines Minimalist principles of social and aesthetic autonomy, suggesting that the artwork is completed by the viewers’ physical interaction with (and consumption of) the work. This strategy also criticizes the ways in which ideas are propagated through an art practice; by offering a work that depends on the projection and contemplation by its audience. Identity Art\n\n180.

His infamous Coca ColaVase (1994) is a Han Dynasty urn emblazoned with the ubiquitous soft-drink logo.Ai also served as artistic consultant on the design of the “Bird’s Nest” stadium for Beijing’s 2008 Olympics, and has curated pavilions and museum exhibitions around the globe.

DanhVō’s conceptual works explore themes of appropriation and fragmentation, incorporating his experience as aVietnamese-born Danish citizen and consistently using his own life as material. Vō’s We the People (2011) is a scrupulous replica of fragments of the Statue of Liberty for which the artist took pains to ensure the same copper hammering technique.The resulting hollow pieces were exhibited spread out on the ﬂoor of a gallery space, highlighting the unexpected fragility of the original statue, visible in the thinness of its material.

Meticulously assembled from discarded aluminum often sourced from liquor bottles, the recycled materials coalesce in exquisite constellations that track postcolonial exchange and global abstract traditions. StressedWorld, 2011 is a quintessential example: delicate yet monumental. Hovering between sculpture and painting, the metal constructions defy categorization and have solidiﬁed Anatsui’s status as a groundbreaking visual artist of international critical acclaim.

Post Colonialism: Popularized in the 1980s, the term refers to investigations into the cultural situation of nations who have formerly been subject to colonial control, predominantly at the hands of European nations. A culture's aesthetics must be seen both as a tool used in furthering its speciﬁc agenda and as a product of its own political past. the “Other”: the imaginary oppositional subjects whose invention supports the deﬁnition of the self.

Rirkrit Tiravanija, PadThai, 1991-'96 Relational Aesthetics: French critic and philosopher Nicolas Bourriaud adopted the term in the mid-1990s to refer to the approach of socially conscious art of participation: an art that takes as its content the human relations elicited by the artwork. The relational art of the 1990s and 2000s is a continuation of traditions of participatory art (such as the arts of the 1950s and 1960s, Happenings, and Conceptual Art).\n\n230.

Rirkrit Tiravanija Untitled, 2002 Relational Aesthetics\n\n233. All art is potentially participatory, if viewers are willing to engage with the work. However, in Bourriaud’s formulation, not all participatory art is relational.A relational work, for Bourriaud, does not aim at a critique of the art institution or an expansion of the deﬁnition of art, but rather focuses on the social interactions sparked by the art exhibition. For example, in Untitled 1992 (Free) of 1992–2007, ﬁrst presented at 303 Gallery in NewYork, Rirkrit Tiravanija moved what he found in the ofﬁce and storage room into the exhibition space, reversing the relationship between public and private; he invited the director and his assistants to work there, and then cooked Thai curry in the ofﬁce for everybody in attendance.
