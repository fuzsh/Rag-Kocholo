        "text": "Object history\n\nPurchased, 1865\n\nV&A memorandum dated August 26th, 1865 (Dossier 3417A):\n\nâWhilst on the point of leaving for Spain, I have discovered a very interesting Early Spanish âChurchâ picture on sale at a dealerâs in London (Mr. Watson, Duke St. Oxford St.). It is a panel picture, representing the Adoration of the Magi, executed circa 1500-10 â in most perfect preservation replete with interesting costume and Gothic or âPlaterescâ [sic] ornamental detail, and is quite within the scope of this Museum. It is moreover valuable in an iconographic and historical point of view, the principal figure (one of the kings) being a fine contemporary portrait of the celebrated King Ferdinand the Catholic. The picture is also signed by the artist in one corner, in large Gothic letters (the usual practice of the more eminent of the early Spanish painters) âLo fil de Mestre Rodrigoâ (the son of Master Rodrigo) and I believe it thus gives us evidence of an unknown and not unimportant early Spanish master. I take it the picture is of the Castillian school and the painter a follower of Fernando Gallegos of Salamanca. Messrs. Watson ask Â£100 for the picture but they would lend it on approval till next year if requested to do so. I recommend that this course be taken as there are not sufficient funds at present to purchase it.\n\nJ.C. ROBINSON\n\nP.S. Messrs. Watson knows nothing about the picture and it would be well not to enlighten them about it. So the label should merely bear Messrs. Watsonâs name as lending without any description or explanation.â\n\nHistorical significance:\n\nThis painting has long been recognised as the authentic work and most likely the only known work of the Valencian painter Francisco de Osona. Passavant refers indeed to what appears to have been 484-1865 as follows: âTo my knowledge, the only painting by this master [the son of Master Rodrigo] is an Adoration of the Magi with figures somewhat over half life size, in the possession of an Italian chaplain in Valencia. It is signed: LO FIL DE MESTRE RODRIGO.â This signature suggests that the painting is entirely by one of Rodrigo de Osona's sones, either Francisco or JerÃ³nimo.\n\nThe painting was probably executed ca. 1505 for the Convent âGratia Deiâ (o de la ZaidÃ­a) in Valencia (Company, 1994) but it has also been suggested that it was made for the Cartuja de Portaceli in Valencia, however with no evidence of this.\n\n484-1865 was most likely originally part of a larger altarpiece, the missing upper corners suggesting it had a curved top. It shows the Adoration of the Magi with the Holy Family (The Virgin, Child and Joseph) on the right and the Magi on the left, one of them kneeling in prayer before the Virgin and Child.\n\nThe Adoration of the Magi traditionally refers to an episode from the Nativity of Jesus narrated in the Gospel of Matthew (2:1-11): three Magi, identified from the 13th century as Caspar, Melchior and Balthasar and represented as kings (Jacobus of Voragine, Golden Legend), having found Jesus by following a star, lay before him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh, and worship him. According to Matthew, these presents are symbolic of Christ as King, God and Man (myrrh being associated with death). In the Western church calendar, this event is commemorated as the Feast of the Epiphany (January 6).\n\nThe ruined setting had become usual since the mid-fifteenth century for representations of the Nativity and the Adoration, and was symbolic of the decline of Judaism following the birth of Christ. The ruins refer specifically to the palace of the Saviourâs lineal ancestor King David in Bethlehem, the âcity of Davidâ (Luke, 2:11). However the elaborate and complex ruined palace may equally allude to human vanity intended to be wiped away by the passing of time and death.\n\nFrom the fourteenth century, it was customary to differentiate the Magi between their ages, representing one as youthful, one as middle aged, and one as elderly. From the fifteenth century, especially in German and the Netherlands, one was frequently portrayed as a Moor. Thus, they implicitly acquired the persona of the three Ages of Man and the three Continents of Asia, Europe and Africa. (G. Schiller, Iconography of Christian Art, vol. 1, London 1971, pp.94-114).\n\nRobinson identified the kneeling Magus as a portrait of Ferdinand II âthe Catholicâ, King of Aragon (1452-1516. His long dark hair, cleft double-chin, and pronounced âfive oâclock shadowâ are all characteristic of the more realistic portraits of Ferdinand. These include the anonymous bust-length oil portrait at Schloss Ambras, and its derivatives, the polychrome wood kneeling figure by Felipe Bigamy in the Capilla Reale in Granada Cathedral, and the miniature of the king kneeling in prayer by Pedro dâAponte on fol. 2v in his missal and breviary, now in the Vatican Library (ms. Chig. C.VII 205). The Magus also bears a marked resemblance to the kneeling figure of an unidentified donor at the right of The Adoration of the Magi in the Museum of Fine Arts, San Francisco, attributed to Rodrigo and Francisco de Osona.\n\nIn the Prado and San Francisco compositions of the Adoration of the Magi, the kneeling Magus is depicted (as was common) kissing the Childâs foot, and is recognisably older than his companions, one of whom is represented as a Moor. In 484-1865, all the Magi are white, the one kneeling holds his hands together in prayer and the age difference between him and the central Magus is less marked. As was noted earlier, the central Magus bears a marked physical resemblance to the more closely shaven donor in San Francisco Adoration of the Magi. Both wear a beretta with a medal of a helmeted head âallâanticaâ, and share a common resemblance to portraits of Fedinand II, who was also often represented wearing such headgear.\n\nThe inclusion of actual portraits in religious paintings was not unprecedented. Cardinal Albrecht of Brandenburg (1490-1545) commissioned a number of religious works including representations of himself in the guise of St. Jerome, St. Martin and St. Erasmus (Thomas Schauerte (ed.), Der Kardinal Albrecht von Brandenburg; RenaissancefÃ¼rst und MÃ¤zen, Halle 2006, vol. 1, pp.188-97.) Likenesses of Ferdinand II appear as an onlooker in two small panels by Juan de Flandres of The Feeding of the Five Thousand and The Entry into Jerusalem, dated ca. 1496-1504, from the dispersed Altarpiece of Isabella the Catholic, and now in the Palacio Real, Madrid (E. Pardo Canalis 1963, pp.42-3, 72-4). Moreover, a portrait of the Emperor Maximilian I (whose son Philip married Ferdinandâs daughter Joanna) appears as the middle-aged Magus with a likeness of his deceased father Frederick III as the elderly Magus in an Antwerp triptych of The Adoration of the Magi of 1515-20 by the Master of Frankfurt in the Staatsgalerie, Stuttgart (inv. no. L27; Austellung Maximilian I, Tyroler Landesmusem, Innsbruck 1969, p.150). For these reasons, it seems possible to sustain J.C. Robinsonâs identification of the central Magus in 484-1865 as âa fine contemporary portrait of the celebrated King Ferdinand the Catholicâ, and to propose that the same sitter is represented in the San Francisco Adoration of the Magi with a donor.\n\nA pair of panels of The Adoration of the Shepherds and The Adoration of the Magi in the Prado and one of The Adoration of the Magi in the Museum of Fine Arts, San Francisco, have been attributed to the joint workshop of Rodrigo and Francisco de Osona, which is documented in existence in 1502. All include background architecture with sharply receding perspective derived from DÃ¼rer's woodcuts of The Adoration of the Shepherds, The Adoration of the Magi and The Holy Family in Egypt which are generally dated around 1502-3, and were published in book form in 1511. The panels attributed to Rodrigo and Francisco de Osona have been dated ca.1495-1505, but their common use of this graphic source indicates that they cannot be much earlier than 1505, and are possibly later than 1511.\n\nThe figure of the Virgin in 484-1865 is reminiscent of that in the San Francisco panel, while the attitude of the two standing Magi and their open-handed gestures recall the Prado Adoration of the Magi. Also, the prominent dagger handle projecting from the girdle of the youngest Magus in 484-1865 reappears in the San Francisco painting. However, in comparison with these panels, the figures in 484-1865 are more corporeal but markedly stiffer. Its background architecture is also spatially assertive, including the motif of a broken arch, common to DÃ¼rer's Holy Family in Egypt, but is otherwise quite different in character. Its dominant element, an exterior staircase extending over an archway, derives ultimately from Leonardo da Vinciâs unfinished Adoration of the Magi, commissioned in 1481 in the Uffizi, Florence. This motif re-appears, for example, in Andrea del Sartoâs painting of Pharaohâs Dreams, part of the dispersed Joseph cycle from the Palazzo Borgherini, now in the Palazzo Pitti, Florence, which has been dated 1515-16. (J. Shearman, Andrea del Sarto, Oxford 1965, vol.1, pp.230-4; vol. 2, plate 48b). 484-1865 may post-date the Prado and San Franciso paintings, and have been made during the decade 1505-16. Its staircase motif reappears in a panel of The Nativity, attributed to a follower of the Osona, in a private collection (Company, vol. 1, p.188, vol. 2, fig.117).\n\nDistinctly classicising elements in 484-1865, equally foreign to the Prado and San Francisco panels and DÃ¼rerâs woodcuts, are the semi-circular exedra on an arcade visible through the arch, the multi-tiered circular structure whose edge is visible at the upper left, and the sculptural decoration at the upper right. From top, and left to right, these depict:\n\n1. An oblong panel sub-divided into two scenes in relief. At the left, a pair of nude male figures attempting to subdue a rearing horse; a motif probably derived from the âhorse-tamingâ figures of the Dioscuri from the Quirinale in Rome. At the right a standing figure on a multi-wheeled chariot with a flaming torchere at each of its four corners.\n\n2. A spandrel with a relief of a figure in billowing drapery; a motif probably derived from the figures of Victory in the spandrels of the Arch of Titus in Rome.\n\n3. A door-frame decorated with classicising pilasters, and at top right a nude male figure battling a monster with a serpentine neck and tail; probably a corruption of a group of Hercules slaying the Hydra.\n\n4. A spandrel with a relief of a nude male figure blowing a trumpet (?)\n\n(P. Pray Bober and R. Rubinstein, Renaissance artists & antique sculpture: a handbook of sources, London: 1987, pp.158-61, 211-12). These decorations have no evident iconographic links with the subject-matter of The Adoration of the Magi, but resemble the simulated sculpture in paintings by Andrea Mantegna, which include citations from the Dioscuri (San Zeno Altarpiece, Verona, 1457-9) and the Victory from the Arch of Titus (St. Sebastian, Vienna, variously dated between the 1450s and 1470s). Analogous motifs (including putti, a pan-like figure, and muscular male nudes) also appear in the painted panels from the St. Denis altarpiece for Valencia Cathedral, now in the Museu Catedralici-DiocesÃ , for which Rodrigo and Francisco de Osona received payment in 1502. The association of this decoration with a compositional device derived from Leonardo da Vinci indicates a knowledge of Italian art, perhaps communicated to Francisco de Osona by the itinerant painter Paolo de San Leocadio, documented in Valencia and, to the south, in Gandia in 1490-1513."
