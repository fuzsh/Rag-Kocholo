        "text": "Now look at the beards of the two men. That of the king in the pastel (above left) resembles the head of a flat paintbrush with a few hairs hanging down towards the edge of the frame from its left corner; the other king's (above right) is cut off in the same way by the edge of the frame itself. The edge of the image is a traditional and widely-used location in art for the metaphoric presence of the artist's hand.4 In combining a royal head with a paintbrush-beard, Picasso combines craft, intellect and a universal symbol of power and perfection into one memorable image. And like the method just explained, the metaphoric presence of two eyes near the lower edge is also commonly used to suggest that what appears above those \"eyes\", which are the artist's, takes place inside his head. Here the \"eyes\" are suggested by a short black line on the left-hand side and the hint of a circular black form on the right-hand side. The former represents a closed eye for insight; the latter an open eye for observation of nature. For more on this theme, see Eyes at Bottom."
