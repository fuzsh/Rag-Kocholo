        "text": "Charlotte White spent six weeks at the Voltaire Foundation this past summer thanks to the UNIQ+ programme and is now working towards an MA in Medical History and Humanities at the University of York.\n\nCreating an accessible online resource that explores the life and works of Voltaire is a daunting task, considering his seemingly endless list of publications and correspondence, and the generations of extensive scholarship attempting to make sense of it.\n\nAfter deciding to create a timeline, I set out to design something that was interactive, approachable, and useful as both an entry-level look into Voltaire’s life and a tool for more specific research. It was important that the end result be something that widened access to information and the work of the Voltaire Foundation by creating an exploratory experience that encouraged curiosity. It was also important that the timeline could be used for more in-depth study and specific focus, connecting experts and enthusiasts to further content. Extensive investigation into existing programs revealed everything from basic lists to extremely complex AI-generated videos, from simple but sparse to detailed but cluttered, until I found a free tool by Northwestern University’s Knight Lab that allowed for links to external sources, high-quality images, and a flexible layout for thematic organisation and adaptability.\n\nPrompted to experiment with additional visual tools, I started putting entries that corresponded with a place into a ‘story map’, hoping to reveal patterns of movement. Although Voltaire did not travel quite enough for a map to be the most useful digital resource to focus on at this time, this act of trial and error still allowed me to see the obvious emergence of a pattern of him continually returning to Paris (despite being exiled on more than one occasion), as well as a clear favouring of Protestant Europe. His journeys may create, even to someone who knows nothing of Voltaire, the impression of ambassadorship, a role that he took on both formally and informally throughout his life both for political agendas and his own.\n\nA key factor in creating a timeline was the editing process, choosing, out of thousands of possible entries, which were the most important to showcase, or at least, where to start. For now, the timeline features two simple themes/rows (life and work) largely due to the difficulty in categorising Voltaire’s work: its interdisciplinary nature – combining science, philosophy, and religion, always with a literary twist – makes separating his work into binary categories a limiting factor in the timeline format. However, the program is flexible to suit any direction the Voltaire Foundation takes next. It has been designed so that individual entries or whole thematic strands can be added with ease to suit a variety of different research goals.\n\nDespite this challenge in a digital approach, what became clear was how the act of creating the timeline was a helpful research tool in itself, engaging my curiosity by highlighting patterns and anomalies to investigate further. It was an exercise in how to narrow down my research focus, by first contextualising Voltaire within 18th-century culture and the history of science, examining where he fits into history generally, then zooming in on periods of high activity that can spark inspiration. Ultimately, implementing elements of the digital humanities can refresh and reinvigorate the research landscape, even when exploring the work of a well-studied historical figure.\n\n– Charlotte White\n\nFollow this link to explore the timeline: https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=10ksDfg8bojD_XLRdhSuVfUr3XdWZBWYCWu68wVFAQyQ&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650\n\nCondorcet’s Vie de Voltaire was written between 1783 and 1789 and published in the spring of 1789 in the seventy-volume Kehl edition of Voltaire’s complete works, edited by Beaumarchais, Condorcet, and others. This biography sought to defend Voltaire against his critics and to restore his place in the ‘History of the progress of the human mind’. While Condorcet’s Vie de Turgot (1786) was a manifesto for Condorcet’s own reformist ambitions, his Vie de Voltaire was a tribute to one of the key leaders of the philosophes. Therefore, it is essential reading in order to fully comprehend Condorcet’s thinking.\n\nThis new edition, by Linda Gil, of the Vie de Voltaire provides, for the first time, comprehensive notes, as well as a preface that places the text within its editorial context, namely the monumental Kehl edition. The Vie de Voltaire marked the culmination of ‘one of the most significant literary endeavours of the century’ (Preface, p.13) that began immediately after Voltaire’s death in 1778. The objective of the Kehl edition was to establish Voltaire as a symbol of the militant commitment and pedagogical ambition of the philosophes. L. Gil shows Voltaire’s biography to be a pivotal moment in the process of glorifying Voltaire, which would reach its zenith in 1791 when he was interred in the Panthéon in Paris.\n\nThe Vie de Voltaire and the progress of the human mind\n\nWhat does the Vie de Voltaire teach us about Condorcet’s thinking? L. Gil is right when she states that it can be understood as a way to outline his own theory of the progress of the human mind. In the Ninth epoch of his Sketch for a historical picture of the progress of the human mind, Condorcet recalls Voltaire’s role in this progress. According to him, Voltaire did not discover new truths, but he unquestionably contributed to spreading philosophical ones, which had previously been reserved to a select few, far more widely.\n\nThe spread of these truths did not merely occur through the transmission of knowledge but rather through the communication of a new form of sensibility which Condorcet succinctly encapsulates as a ‘love for mankind’ (sentiment d’humanité), which he defines in the Sketch as ‘une compassion tendre, active pour tous les maux qui affligent l’espèce humaine, d’une horreur pour tout ce qui, dans les institutions publiques, dans les actes du gouvernement, dans les actions privées, ajoutait des douleurs nouvelles aux douleurs inévitables de la nature’. [1]\n\nCondorcet believed that this feeling finds its origin in the principles of philosophy. Thus, experiencing it is synonymous with acknowledging the truth of these principles. Voltaire’s work contributed to the emergence of these principles because, in its various literary forms, it helped a broad readership recognise the authenticity of this feeling. It is not insignificant that in his Vie de Voltaire, Condorcet describes one of Voltaire’s primary personality traits as ‘love for mankind’: ‘On peut le compter parmi le très petit nombre des hommes en qui l’amour de l’humanité a été une véritable passion’ (p.222). The book aimed to describe how Voltaire succeeded in communicating this feeling to his readers thanks to a unique literary style, accessible not only to philosophers but also to the ‘peuple des lecteurs’ (p.228).\n\nThis interpretation of Voltaire’s works reflects Condorcet’s optimism regarding the challenging issue of the spread of knowledge in society. This problem is the subject of a chapter entitled ‘Peut-on éclairer le peuple?’ in Antoine Lilti’s recent book, L’Héritage des Lumières. In this chapter, A. Lilti highlights a paradox specific to the Enlightenment: in order to enlighten the people, it is necessary for them to be able to identify those who are capable of enlightening them. In Condorcet’s opinion, Voltaire embodies the possibility of resolving this paradox because what is unique about his genius is precisely his ability to be recognised as such by his readers.\n\nThis conviction of Condorcet’s runs through the entire book and will serve as our guide to examine three themes that he announces on the very first page of his Vie de Voltaire, namely the progress of the arts, influence over public opinion, and the war against prejudice: ‘La vie de Voltaire doit être l’histoire des progrès que les arts ont dus à son génie, du pouvoir qu’il a exercé sur les opinions de son siècle, enfin de cette longue guerre contre les préjugés, déclarée dès sa jeunesse, et soutenue jusqu’à ses derniers moments’ (p.29).\n\nVoltaire’s plays\n\nCondorcet believed that Voltaire’s artistic genius found its best expression in his plays, which filled the first nine volumes of the Kehl edition. According to him, Voltaire was the only playwright who had improved the genre of tragedy in France since Racine (p.229). The value of his work lay in his ability to blend poetry with philosophy, thus using art to communicate the truth of philosophy to still resistant spectators and readers. Condorcet considered that L’Orphelin de la Chine demonstrates that ‘un grand poète peut quelquefois décider les esprits flottants entre d’anciennes erreurs et les vérités qui, pour en prendre la place, attendent qu’un dernier coup achève de renverser la barrière chancelante que le préjugé leur oppose’ (p.127). Theatre could be a means of spreading philosophical truths by sharing the sensibility specific to the philosophes, which Voltaire was perfectly capable of conveying to his audience. His plays demonstrate that ‘les spectacles forment en quelque sorte un lien entre la classe des hommes qui pensent et celle des hommes qui ne pensent point’ (p.55).\n\nVoltaire and public opinion\n\nCondorcet also believed that Voltaire exemplified how men of letters had gained influence over public opinion during the second half of the eighteenth century. Condorcet viewed public space as a battleground where various groups compete fiercely to gain dominance in shaping public opinion. This struggle holds a vital political dimension as public opinion invariably influences those with legislative authority. To establish a political power guided by reason, public opinion must first be made rational.\n\nCondorcet did not endorse a monolithic and naive view of the people. He describes public opinion as vague, erratic, and susceptible to prejudice. It has a passive dimension and lacks autonomy. Public opinion truly exists and is capable of passing judgment only when someone summons it to deliver its verdict. That is why public opinion can play a political role only if enlightened people want to defend a cause by making it public. To achieve this goal, they need to possess the talent to effectively communicate their ideas. Voltaire’s significant legal battles, such as the Calas, Sirven, and d’Étallonde cases, precisely represent this pivotal moment in the history of the progress of the human mind. Once again, Voltaire served philosophy by writing ‘des écrits plus courts, séduisants par le style, propres tantôt à exciter la pitié, tantôt à réveiller l’indignation publique’ (p.155).\n\nThe war against prejudice\n\nWhile Voltaire knew how to rally a public, he also contributed to unite a group, that of the philosophes, in the battle against prejudice. This battle was primarily aimed at promoting tolerance and fighting religious fanaticism and superstition. This group was composed of French philosophes, active at the time of the Encyclopédie. Nevertheless, in his Vie de Voltaire, Condorcet emphasises the European dimension of the Enlightenment. Voltaire is described as the leader of a group that transcends borders, united by the defence of common principles and coalescing around him: ‘Il avait formé dans l’Europe entière une ligue dont il était l’âme, et dont le cri de ralliement était raison et tolérance’ (p.165).\n\nThe spatial expansion of the Enlightenment spirit was coupled with a social expansion. Better than anyone, Voltaire succeeded in wrenching from prejudices men who were unable to study proofs, thanks to his unique talent for formulating philosophical truths in an accessible way. His use of short, entertaining literary genres, like the philosophical novella Candide, expanded the readership of philosophical works by making truths accessible to all, as he was aware that ‘la justesse naturelle de l’esprit y [à l’étude] peut suppléer pour les vérités simples qui sont aussi les plus nécessaires’ (p.134). Better than anyone else, Voltaire excelled at liberating from prejudices individuals who could not engage in rigorous philosophical discourse.\n\nThis edition of Condorcet’s Vie de Voltaire by L. Gil provides a valuable reading guide that was lacking in previous editions of this major work. It actively contributes to the recent effort to publish Condorcet’s writings in paperback, which include his Correspondance secrète with Voltaire and D’Alembert (Payot et Rivages, 2021), as well as Conseils à sa fille (Folio Gallimard, 2022). Most importantly, this edition offers a fresh perspective on a work by Condorcet which had been overlooked, but which, nonetheless, proves to be crucial in his intellectual trajectory.\n\n– Gabriel Darriulat (doctorant contractuel, Sorbonne Université)\n\n[1] Condorcet, Esquisse d’un tableau historique des progrès de l’esprit humain [1794], préface d’Alain Pons (Paris, Flammarion, 1998), p.230.\n\nVoltaire’s private life is still something of a puzzle: he invested so much energy in creating his public image that it is hard to know who there is behind the mask, or masks. There are biographies of Voltaire aplenty – but could we write a biography of François-Marie Arouet? Voltaire’s immensely rich correspondence might seem like a way of discovering the elusive ‘real’ person, but that can prove illusory: on closer inspection, the correspondence, just like all his other writings, turns out to be a vast laboratory of performances. There are, however, just a few exceptions.\n\nWe know tantalisingly little about his private life with Emilie Du Châtelet. The abbé de Voisenon tells us that she treasured the letters she had received from Voltaire and kept them bound in eight quarto volumes. Frustratingly, these seem not to have survived, and she quite possibly destroyed them before her death – surely the single greatest loss from this iconic epistolary corpus. In the case of Voltaire’s relationship with Marie-Louise Denis, on the other hand, significant numbers of genuinely personal letters have survived, though many remained in private hands until the twentieth century, and there may yet be more to be discovered. Voltaire’s relationship with his niece is therefore the most significant attachment of his life for which we have reliable documentation.\n\nThe number of known letters to Marie-Louise Denis has grown considerably over the last century. First, around a hundred letters, dating from between 1745 and 1754, came to light in the late 1930s, with the publication of the Lettres d’Alsace à sa nièce Madame Denis, edited by Georges Jean-Aubry. Already in the eighteenth century there was speculation about the exact nature of Voltaire’s relationship with his niece – were they lovers? All such lingering doubts were dispelled decisively in the 1950s, when the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York acquired some 140 letters from Voltaire to his niece, mostly dating from between 1744 and 1747. It has to be said that Voltaire’s love letters do not rank among his most subtle achievements – he sometimes writes in Italian in an attempt to relieve their tawdry banality – but they certainly leave us in no doubt about the physical nature of their relationship. Theodore Besterman published these letters in 1957, in a book beautifully produced by the Librairie Plon in Paris: the Lettres d’amour de Voltaire à sa nièce bear the surprising dedication ‘à Nancy Mitford’. In fact, Besterman had been discussing this new find of letters with Nancy Mitford over several years: she immediately sensed the fictional potential of this love triangle (Voltaire’s sexual relationship with Denis began before the death of Du Châtelet in 1749) and set to work to write up the scoop of this newly revealed ménage à trois manqué. Modern funding bodies like to encourage academics to explore ways of enhancing the outreach and impact of their scholarly discoveries, but no-one has ever done it better than Theodore Besterman. His scholarly Lettres d’amour appeared in the same year, 1957, as Nancy Mitford’s Voltaire in Love: the title was suggested to her by Evelyn Waugh, and the book was published in London by Hamish Hamilton, with a dust jacket designed by Cecil Beaton (now a collectable item in itself). Nancy Mitford’s work understandably garnered more reviews than Besterman’s, and a French translation of Voltaire in Love, Voltaire amoureux, appeared in 1959.\n\nNow another significant collection of letters from Voltaire to his niece has surfaced, 127 autograph letters, hitherto unknown, written between 1737 and 1744. They were acquired by the Bibliothèque nationale de France in 1994 and have just appeared in an edition published by Classiques Garnier. These letters were arranged, with posterity in mind, by Marie-Louise Denis herself: she grouped them into various folders or chemises, which bear writing in her hand, and often proposed dates for the letters which were undated. The coherence of this collection is obvious: it spans the duration of her marriage to Nicolas-Charles Denis. In October 1737, Marie-Louise Mignot lost her father and became an orphan (her mother, Voltaire’s beloved elder sister Catherine, had died many years earlier). In the first letter of this collection, Voltaire sent his condolences to his niece, and advised her not to retire to a convent. Assuming willingly his role as the young woman’s protector, Voltaire set about finding her a suitable husband, and Marie-Louise quickly showed her mettle by rejecting her uncle’s choice and finding a husband of her own, the army officer Denis, whom she married in 1738. The young couple made their home in Lille, and Voltaire wrote to them both, frequently and with evident affection. Many new insights into their private life emerge from these letters, including information about Marie-Louise’s musical talents: see Nicolas Fréry’s recent blogpost here, ‘La nièce musicienne : Marie-Louise Denis et la boîte de Pandore’.\n\nBesterman’s Lettres d’amour has as a frontispiece the beautiful oil portrait of the young Marie-Louise, then attributed to Van Loo, and now thought to be the work of Drouais (the sitter was only identified in 1921). It appears to date from around 1737, so when she is 25 years of age, just before her marriage in February 1738: perhaps the portrait was commissioned by her husband-to-be? In the new edition of Lettres inédites à Marie-Louise Denis, we produce a related image (p.52), a pastel portrait from the same period, more intimate in style, but clearly composed after the model of the oil painting. This pastel, which is in the collections of the Musée d’art et d’histoire of Geneva, was long thought to depict Charlotte de Constant, but Renée Loche has shown that the sitter is in fact Marie-Louise Denis, and that it was drawn by Marie-Louise’s younger sister, Marie-Elisabeth Dompierre de Fontaine, probably around 1737–1738. Voltaire is known to have admired her work, and this is the portrait that he would have had before him when he wrote the letters in this new volume: like the letters, it possesses a particular quality of intimacy.\n\nAfter a sudden illness, M. Denis died prematurely in April 1744, and the collection closes with Voltaire writing another letter of condolence to his niece: ‘Adieu, du courage, de la philosophie. La vie est un songe, et un songe triste, mais vivez pour vos amis et pour moi qui vous aime tendrement’ (p.288). The dramatic irony here is evident, for as readers of Nancy Mitford, we know only too well how their relationship will develop. We can all now read the letters to Marie-Louise when she was a young wife, and if we want, we can try to search them for clues about the future. But perhaps it needs a novelist to do real justice to this material. Voltaire’s private life is the stuff of fiction, and possibly of epistolary fiction (think what he will do later with Paméla). Just as Nancy Mitford gave fictional shape to the truth of Besterman’s discoveries, we now need a novelist who can find the deeper truth in Voltaire’s relations with his favourite niece and her husband.\n\n– Nicholas Cronk\n\nThe Lettres inédites à Marie-Louise Denis (1737-1744): Voltaire et sa chère nièce, edited by Nicholas Cronk, Frédéric Deloffre, Nicolas Fréry and Jacqueline Hellegouarc’h, have just been published (Paris, Classiques Garnier, 2023).\n\nThe Œuvres complètes de Voltaire, one of the most complex publishing projects ever, has been underway since 1967. Two of the editors look back on this great undertaking.\n\nGillian Pink: It’s amazing to think that we’ve finally reached the end! When I tell non-specialists that our edition of Voltaire’s works runs to 205 volumes, they are always astonished to learn that he wrote so much. Certainly, his better-known works represent only a very small part of the whole.\n\nAlison Oliver: That’s true – and there is so much to discover! We should remember also that almost exactly a quarter of those 205 volumes is correspondence – an astonishing editorial feat by our founder, Theodore Besterman, who edited it not once, but twice. The edition we use now is what he called ‘definitive’ – a bold claim even in 1968, especially as new letters are emerging even now.\n\nGP: Yes, and while there have been fewer ‘new’ discoveries outside the correspondence, one obvious place in which our edition breaks fresh ground compared to its predecessors is in the inclusion of Voltaire’s marginalia. Publication began in the seventies as a separate project run by a team of Russian specialists, but it joined the Complete Works in the early 2000s and was finished here at the Voltaire Foundation, in collaboration with our Russian colleagues.\n\nAO: All this adds up to an extraordinary body of work. Voltaire is an astonishingly versatile writer, and nothing was beneath his notice. For example, his support for victims of injustice, such as Jean Calas, is well known, but he also interested himself in more quotidian matters in his capacity of lord of the manor on his estate of Ferney on the Swiss border. His epic poems La Henriade and La Pucelle brought him fame (and infamy), but there are also gems of occasional verse in which his wit and style are encapsulated in just a few lines.\n\nGP: And the chronological organisation of the edition means that those lesser-known writings may gain more visibility: anyone consulting Œdipe [the play that made Voltaire famous in his twenties] in vol.1A may be interested to find the tantalising fragments of an even earlier play, Amulius et Numitor, dating from his school days. Or a reader interested in another of his well-known plays, Mahomet, would find, in the same volume 20B, the short prose text De l’Alcoran et de Mahomet, which was published with the play in Voltaire’s lifetime, but separated from it in all the posthumous editions until this one.\n\nAO: What I like about the idea of the chronological principle is that it is non-judgemental. Literary judgements are apt to date badly, and we want the edition to be, as far as any can be, timeless. By organising according to chronology – at least as far as this can be determined – we are trying to provide a neutral framework on which to hang the content, rather than engage in judgements about genre, hierarchy and literary merit. The founders of the edition opted for ‘date of substantial composition’, rather than date of publication – for the sound reason that Voltaire did not always publish works (and sometimes ones of major importance) as soon as they were written. It’s true that the chronological principle has immeasurably complicated the publishing process… if we’d decided to put all the poetry together, for example, a single volume could potentially have been edited by an individual editor, with all of it ready to publish as soon as it was received. As it is, we’ve often had to hold back texts edited by one person while waiting for other editors to catch up.\n\nGP: I laughed when you referred, very delicately, to ‘complicating the publishing process’! As we know so well, but our readers won’t, that number of 205 has been in constant flux over the years.\n\nAO: We’ve recently been delving into the archives relating to the founding of the project. The fact that ‘as many as 200 volumes’ was mentioned way back in 1967 (before being dialled back later, and then eventually reached) surprised me for one! It’s also been interesting to discover that William Barber and Owen Taylor, who pitched the project to Besterman, initially envisaged only a fairly modest project – just a good, reliable text to replace that of the standard nineteenth-century edition then in use, with minimal introductions and annotation.\n\nGP: These elements have certainly expanded over the years, and with them has come the need to split volumes. I think it was in 1990 that it was first deemed necessary to do that, with volume 63, because it became clear that the content would result in far too many pages to fit within a single physical binding. Since then, we’ve had not only pairs, like 75A and 75B, but as many as a four-way split, with 60A-D. This did allow us a certain amount of leeway sometimes in getting round the problem of waiting for contributors to submit their work, but must have confused librarians and frustrated readers. The Œuvres complètes were a sort of Penelope’s shroud, a seemingly ever-expanding universe of Voltaire, stretching endlessly into the future!\n\nAO: It’s one of the challenges of taking on such an ambitious project, though. And over the course of the 50+ years of the endeavour, editorial standards have inevitably evolved. As the edition has grown, it has allowed scholars to study the Voltaire corpus in ways unimagined at the start of the project, and so it is unsurprising that the more we publish, the more there is to say!\n\nGP: This is something we’re encountering right now as we prepare to make the print edition into a digital resource. Some of this is a (relatively) straightforward conversion process, but occasionally we’d quite like to be able to add little supplements to some of the volumes published longer ago.\n\nAO: Yes, and there will be new ways of looking at the corpus by making it cross-searchable, adding metadata and links to other resources. It’s exciting to think of these possibilities for research evolving in ways that we can’t predict. But also reassuring to know that the books themselves will endure and will be on library shelves for generations to come.\n\n– Alison Oliver and Gillian Pink\n\nFirst blogged in: The Oxford Polyglot 2021-22, Issue 2, Hilary term 2022.\n\nTo mark the publication at Oxford University Press of his new book ‘Voltaire: A Very Short Introduction’, a contribution to their Very Short Introductions series, Nicholas Cronk has written the following post about the wit and wisdom of Voltaire for the OUP Blog.\n\nAs we mark Voltaire’s 323rd birthday – though the date of 20 February is problematic, – what significance does the great Enlightenment writer have for us now? If I had to be very very short, I’d say that Voltaire lives on as a master of the one-liner. He presents us with a paradox. Voltaire wrote a huge amount – the definitive edition of his Complete works being produced by the Voltaire Foundation in Oxford will soon be finished, in around 200 volumes. And yet he is really famous for his short sentences. He likes being brief, though as a critic once remarked, “Voltaire is interminably brief.”\n\nVoltaire’s most famous work, Candide, is full of telling phrases. “If this is the best of all possible worlds, what are the others?” asks Candide in Chapter 6. The expression “best of all possible worlds” comes originally from the philosopher Leibniz, but it is Voltaire’s repeated use of the phrase in Candide that has made it instantly familiar today. Another saying from the novel was an instant hit with French readers: in Chapter 16, Candide and his manservant Cacambo, travelling in the New World dressed as Jesuits, fall into the hands of cannibals who exclaim triumphantly: “Mangeons du jésuite” (“Let’s eat some Jesuit”): the Jesuits were highly unpopular in France at this time, and the expression instantly became a catch-phrase.\n\nOne French expression from Candide has even become proverbial in English. In 1756, the British lost Minorca to the French, as a result of which Admiral Byng was court-martialled and executed. Voltaire has fun with this in Chapter 23:\n\n‘And why kill this admiral?’\n\n‘Because he didn’t kill enough people,’ Candide was told. ‘He gave battle to a French admiral, and it has been found that he wasn’t close enough.’\n\n‘But,’ said Candide, ‘the French admiral was just as far away from the English admiral as he was from him!’\n\n‘Unquestionably,’ came the reply. ‘But in this country it is considered a good thing to kill an admiral from time to time, pour encourager les autres.’\n\nVoltaire’s other writings are equally full of pithy and memorable short sentences, which often help him drive home a point, such as this, from his Questions sur l’Encyclopédie: “L’espèce humaine est la seule qui sache qu’elle doit mourir” (“The human species is unique in knowing it must die”).\n\nOther lines, like this one from his poem about luxury, Le Mondain, “Le superflu, chose très nécessaire” (“The superfluous, a very necessary thing”) are all the more memorable for being in verse. Voltaire’s facility for producing snappy phrases is even there in his private correspondence, as this letter to his friend Damilaville (1 April 1766): “Quand la populace se mêle de raisonner, tout est perdu” (“When the masses get involved in reasoning, everything is lost”).\n\nAnd one phrase that still resonates with us comes from a private notebook that Voltaire surely never intended to publish: “Dieu n’est pas pour les gros bataillons, mais pour ceux qui tirent le mieux” (“God is on the side not of the heavy battalions, but of the best shots”).\n\nThen there are the ones that got away, the one-liners he never actually said – ‘misquotations’ in the parlance of the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations. Hardly a week passes without a newspaper quoting “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.”\n\nVoltaire’s rallying cry of free speech is central to our modern liberal agenda, so it’s a bit awkward that he never actually said it. The expression was made up in 1906 by an English woman, biographer E. B. Hall. But she meant well, and we have collectively decided that Voltaire should have said it. Another advantage of Voltaire’s one-liners is that they provide great marketing copy, and a quick search on the web reveals that many of them are for sale, on t-shirts, shopping-bags, and mugs. “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it” is especially popular, in French as well as English – which explains my favourite t-shirt: “Je me battrai jusqu’à ma mort pour que vous puissiez citer erronément Voltaire” (“I will fight to my death so that you can quote Voltaire incorrectly”).\n\nLuckily, wit is contagious. There is a famous one-liner in Beaumarchais’ The Marriage of Figaro, when the servant Figaro imagines addressing his aristocratic master: “Vous vous êtes donné la peine de naître, et rien de plus” (“You took the trouble to be born, and nothing more”). This has become so celebrated that we have forgotten that Beaumarchais was only improving on a less snappy one-liner he had found in one of Voltaire’s more obscure comedies. George Bernard Shaw, a self-styled follower of Voltaire, has fun with misattributed sayings in Man and Superman:\n\nTanner: Let me remind you that Voltaire said that what was too silly to be said could be sung.\n\nStraker: It wasn’t Voltaire. It was Bow Mar Shay.\n\nTanner: I stand corrected: Beaumarchais of course.\n\nAnd so we go on inventing Voltaire. Another dictum that has recently gained wide currency on the web is this: “To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize.”\n\nNow regularly attributed to Voltaire, this saying seems to originate with something written in 1993 by Kevin Alfred Strom, an American neo-Nazi Holocaust denier, and not a man who obviously exudes Voltairean wit and irony. But once you become an authority, it seems, all sides have a claim on you.\n\nThe one-liner can seem a good way of encapsulating a truth: “Si Dieu n’existait pas, il faudrait l’inventer” (“If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him”).\n\nVoltaire knew he was on to a winner with this line, from a poem of 1768 (the Epître à l’auteur du livre des trois imposteurs), and he re-used it often in later works. Another much-repeated phrase occurs at the end of Candide. When the characters finally come together, after umpteen trials and tribulations, all argument is silenced with the words “Il faut cultiver notre jardin” (“We must cultivate our garden”). Is this a precious nugget of wisdom, neatly encapsulated? Or is it just another “Brexit means Brexit”, a trite phrase meaning anything and nothing? But that, of course, is another use of the one-liner: to maintain suspense, while bringing down the curtain at the end….\n\n– Nicholas Cronk\n\nThis post first appeared on the OUP Blog.\n\nIn November 1694, François-Marie Arouet, later to make his name as Voltaire, was christened at the Church of Saint-André-des-Arts in Paris – and there any certainty surrounding his earliest life ends.[1]\n\nThe official version, based on a now lost parish register, is that he was born the day before his christening, in Paris, to Marie-Marguerite and François Arouet. The dates of his birth and christening are usually given as 21 and 22 November 1694.[2] When the young François-Marie was arrested in May 1717 for writing verse against the regent, he stated that he was twenty-two, from Paris, and that his father was ‘payeur de M. de la chambre des comptes’.[3] Voltaire signed at least three official documents between 1749 and 1776 which give his date of birth as 21 November.[4]\n\nAn alternative story is that Voltaire was born nine months earlier, on 20 February 1694, at Châtenay outside Paris, the illegitimate son of Marie-Marguerite and a certain Rochebrune or Roquebrune. Voltaire had a clear preference for this less mundane version of events, except that he himself does not ever seem to have claimed to have been born anywhere but Paris. His letters to Antoine Deparcieux of 17 June 1768 or to his very close friend d’Argental of 18 May 1774 refer to Paris as the town where he was born. In his 1769 Epître à Boileau he states that he was born near the Palace of justice.[5] It was Condorcet, in his 1789 biography for the Kehl edition, who first named Châtenay as Voltaire’s place of birth. Voltaire’s earlier biographer, Duvernet, merely stated that he was not born in the parish of Saint-André-des-Arts. Whether or not Voltaire was born in Châtenay, where Arouet senior later bought a house, he certainly lived there in 1718 after leaving the Bastille and being banished from Paris, and it was here that he first signed a letter ‘Arouet de Voltaire’.\n\nVery little is known about Voltaire’s putative father. Rochebrune is described as a ‘chansonnier’ (song-writer), socialising around 1710 with the literati of the day.[6] Voltaire refers to himself as ‘Rochebrune’s bastard’ in a 1744 letter to his old friend the duc de Richelieu.[7] In the summer of 1753, when he was suffering from ‘dropsy’, he told his niece Mme Denis in two separate letters that he could remember Rochebrune in the same state, unable to even write a song, that Rochebrune died of dropsy and that he himself has reason to believe that he took after him.[8] A second-hand report of a conversation between Voltaire and his nieces in front of ‘one or two guests’ in 1756 has him asserting that D’Alembert must be Fontenelle’s son as surely as he himself is Rochebrune’s.[9] When his nieces protest, Voltaire retorts that ‘it did more honour to his mother that she had preferred a man of wit such as Roquebrune, a musketeer, officer and author’, to her husband, ‘who was a very ordinary man’.\n\nPublished in 1776, two years before Voltaire’s death, the autobiographical (though written in the third person) Commentaire historique does not touch upon his possible illegitimacy, but does give two possible dates of birth, without settling for either: ‘Some maintain that François de Voltaire was born on 20 February 1694; others that it was on 20 November that same year [i.e. a day earlier than generally assumed]. We have medals of him that bear both dates; he told me several times that when he was born no-one thought he would live; and that having been given a private emergency baptism, the ceremony of his baptism was deferred by several months’. In manuscript notes to various copies of the Commentaire historique, Voltaire’s secretary Wagnière claims to have seen an ‘extrait de baptême’ recording Voltaire’s birth on 20 November and his christening on 21 November.[10]\n\nThe medals referred to must be the ones designed by Georg Christoph Wächter in 1769 and 1770. Interestingly, there is no mention in the correspondence of a wrong date of birth on the earlier medal (I am still searching for an example of it). The second version certainly gives Voltaire’s preferred date of 20 February 1694.\n\nHowever, Voltaire did write at least seven letters between 1765 and 1768 bemoaning a print portrait that gave his date of birth as 20 November 1694. On 20 February 1765 he wrote to his friend Damilaville: ‘Today I am entering my seventy-second year, for I was born in 1694, on 20 February and not on 20 November as ill-informed commentators like to say’. He wrote in similar terms to to his former secretary Collini that same day and to the duc de Richelieu a week later. He repeated this claim to Damilaville on 10 May: ‘There is, they say, an engraving after the bust by Lemoine, that looked fairly like me a few years ago. It can be found at Joulin’s, quai de la Mégisserie; it is true that the print lies a bit; it has me being born on 20 November 1694 and I was born on 20 February’; and again on 20 February 1767. It was the duc de La Vallière’s turn the next day and D’Alembert on 23 March 1768. Unfortunately, as with the Wächter medals, I have been unable to find a version of this engraving giving Voltaire’s date of birth as 20 November 1694. Perhaps a kind reader will point me in the right direction…\n\nOn 1 January 1777, Voltaire was still railing against his official date of birth, this time to d’Argental: ‘Were it true according to a damned baptismal certificate that I was born in 1694 in November, you would still have to grant me that I am in my eighty-third year’.\n\nFaced with such a profusion of dates, one could do worse than pick a completely different one on which to celebrate Voltaire. Nick Treuherz has already written on this blog about a short poem penned for Voltaire’s feast day, ‘la saint-François’, on 4 October 1767. The Correspondance littéraire described the celebrations: poems, plays, fireworks, dinner and a ball at which the patriarch reportedly danced until two in the morning.\n\n– Alice\n\n[1] This blog post is deeply indebted to the great biography Voltaire en son temps in which anyone interested in this subject can find further information.\n\n[2] This date of birth is frequently accepted without question. See for example the OUP blog post on ‘Voltaire’s love letters’.\n\n[3] See ‘Interrogatoire du sr Harrouet fils prisonnnier à la Bastille 21 may 1717’, published as an appendix to Theodore Besterman’s edition of Voltaire’s correspondence (D.app.5.III).\n\n[4] ‘Voltaire buys annuities on the tobacco monopoly, 1749’ (D.app.94); ‘Voltaire gives a power of attorney, September 1773’ (D.app.385.IV); and ‘Voltaire and Wagnière given certificats de vie, October-November 1776’ (D.app.475).\n\n[5] ‘Dans la cour du palais, je naquis ton voisin’ (OCV, vol.70A, p.210).\n\n[6] In the 1738 Vie de Monsieur Jean-Baptiste Rousseau: ‘Il y avait alors à Paris un café assez fameux, où s’assemblaient plusieurs amateurs des belles-lettres, des philosophes, des musiciens, des peintres, des poètes. M. de Fontenelle y venait quelquefois, M. de La Motte, M. Saurin, fameux géomètre, M. Danchet, poète assez méprisé, mais d’ailleurs homme de lettres et honnête homme, l’abbé Alazy, fils d’un fameux apothicaire, garçon fort savant, M. Boindin, procureur général des Trésoriers de France, M. de La Faye, capitaine aux gardes, de l’Académie des sciences; M. son frère, mort secrétaire du cabinet, homme délié et qui faisait de jolis vers, le sieur Roy, depuis chassé de l’Académie des inscriptions et du Châtelet, où il était conseiller, mais qui avait quelques talents pour les ballets, le sieur de Rochebrune, qui faisait des chansons; enfin plusieurs lettrés s’y rendaient tous les jours. Là, on examinait avec beaucoup de sévérité, et quelquefois avec des railleries fort amères, tous les ouvrages nouveaux. ¶On faisait des épigrammes, des chansons fort jolies. C’était une école d’esprit, dans laquelle il y avait un peu de licence’ (OCV, vol.18A, p.38-39).\n\n[7] ‘Je crains bien qu’en cherchant de l’esprit et des traits, / Le bâtard de Rochebrune / Ne fatigue et n’importune / Le successeur d’Armand et les esprits bien faits’ (Voltaire to the duc de Richelieu, 8 June 1744). Curiously, Richelieu seems also to have thought himself illegitimate.

Twenty-five years later, at the end of his life, Voltaire was still describing dropsy as a family illness.
