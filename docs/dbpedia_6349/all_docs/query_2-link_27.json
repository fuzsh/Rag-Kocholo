        "text": "Said by his son to have been\n\nBurne-Jones's particular\n\nfavorite among his finished oil\n\npaintings, The Wheel of Fortune\n\nhas always been considered one\n\nof his most powerful and suc-\n\ncessful compositions. Even the\n\ntraditionally hostile Art Journal\n\ncritic, reviewing the Grosvenor\n\nGallery exhibition of 1883,\n\nfound it \"the most noteworthy\n\namong the imaginative pictures\n\nof the year,\" 1 By allowing the\n\nwheel to fill the picture plane\n\nfrom top to bottom, an illusion\n\nof immense scale is created, bal-\n\nancing the huge and implacable\n\ngoddess against the helpless\n\nmortal figures who represent a\n\nslave, a king, and a poet. John\n\nRuskin, in his last commentary\n\non Burne-Jones's work in\n\n\"Mythic Schools of Painting,\"\n\none of the Art of England lec-\n\ntures delivered in May 1883,\n\npraised the conception of \"grad-\n\nual and irresistible motion of rise\n\nand fall, — the tide of Fortune,\n\nas distinguished from instant\n\nchange or catastrophe, ... of the\n\nconnection of the fates of men\n\nwith each other, the yielding\n\nand occupation of high place,\n\nthe alternately appointed and\n\ninevitable humiliation.\" 2 When\n\nBurne-Jones himself was in a\n\ndesolate mood, he wrote to his\n\nyoung confidante Helen Gaskell,\n\n\"My Fortune's Wheel is a true\n\nimage, and we take our turn at\n\nit, and are broken upon it.\" 3\n\nThe picture was conceived\n\nand begun in 1875, and may have\n\nbeen seen at an early stage dur-\n\ning a visit that year by the aes-\n\nthetically minded Conservative\n\npolitician Arthur Balfour\n\n(1848-1930), who became its\n\nfirst owner. There are five other\n\nversions in various media,\n\nincluding a smaller oil of 1885\n\n(National Gallery of Victoria,\n\nMelbourne), more golden in\n\ntone than the steely blues of\n\nthe Paris canvas. 4 The Timess critic, Tom Taylor, was won\n\nover by the picture's \"wonderful technical skills . . . the beauty\n\nof the greys, yellows and flesh tints . . . [and] the admirable\n\ndrawing of the figures, which shows that the artist has quite\n\ngot rid of the faults of draughtsmanship which were noticeable\n\nin his work only a few years ago.\" 5 Numerous drawings survive\n\n(see cat. no. 53) for many details of figure and drapery, demon-\n\nstrating how thoroughly Burne-Jones would rehearse every\n\nelement of a design.\n\nIt has frequently been observed that the powerful nudes\n\necho the work of Michelangelo, particularly the Captives in the\n\nAccademia, Florence, which Burne-Jones recorded in a\n\nsketchbook from his Italian journey of 1871, and The Dying\n\nSlave in the Louvre, of which he owned a small plaster copy\n\n(along with others of Day and Evening from San Lorenzo,\n\nFlorence). On the 1871 trip he had made a special study of the\n\nSistine Chapel in the Vatican: \"He bought the best opera\n\nglasses he could find, folded his railway rug thickly, and, lying\n\ndown on his back, read the ceiling from beginning to end,\n\npeering into every corner and revelling in its execution.\" 6 Like\n\nsome of his best stained-glass designs of the 1870s (see cat. no.\n\n69), the figure of Fortune is equally imbued with the spirit of\n\nMichelangelo's statuesque Sibyls. Such an homage was recog-\n\nnized by contemporary critics, including F. G. Stephens, who\n\nwrote in the Athenaeum that Fortune was like \"a gigantic stat-\n\nue of grey and golden coloured marbles . . . her beauty is sculp-\n\nturesque, and her face has the sadness of Michael Angelo's\n\n'Night.'\" 7\n\n1.
