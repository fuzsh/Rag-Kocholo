Corporate design development

How can we translate 850 years of art into a single graphic concept? We decided on a big solution – and created a completely new frame for Staatsgalerie. This open frame stands for both focus and diversity – the focus of special exhibitions, and the diversity of the museum’s extensive collection. It unifies the artworks dating from the 14th to the 21st centuries while signifying openness and dialogue.

Highly adaptable design

The open frame is the consistent, highly recognizable design element found at all brand touch points – whether the admission ticket, program, website or mega banner. There are endless possibilities for its content and color, though. As such, it is a symbol of art’s fascinating variety. In its most compact form, the frame forms the symbol »S« for »Staatsgalerie«.

The special exhibition on Giorgio de Chirico marks the launch of the new corporate design. It is supported by an image campaign that incorporates the idea of the frame. The word pair »from to« forms the linguistic link for eight hundred years of art in one building: »from ACT to ACTION«, »from MAX to ROY«, »from AMOR to PSYCHE« and »from SACRAL to SURREAL«.
