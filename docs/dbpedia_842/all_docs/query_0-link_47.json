        "text": "ALARGAN International Real Estate Company is no stranger to green building leadership. They’re one of Kuwait’s leading real estate development companies, with residential and commercial properties throughout Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, and Morocco. They pioneered the concept of sustainability and green buildings in its own headquarters in Kuwait, followed by executing the first LEED Platinum home in its Telal Al Qurm property in the Sultanate of Oman.\n\nIn 2007, they became one of the first USGBC member organizations and in 2014, certifying their International Headquarters as Kuwait’s first LEED Platinum for Commercial Interiors office building to ensure a healthier, more efficient space for employees.\n\nIn order to build for Kuwait’s hot and dry climate, they approached the problem with simple, effective measures: high performance windows and strategic insulation, occupancy and daylight sensing technology, and rooftop solar panels.\n\nBut ALARGAN didn’t stop there. Using the Arc performance platform, they tracked their headquarters’ sustainability performance metrics over a 12-month period to work toward LEED v4.1 Operations and Maintenance recertification. Monitoring their energy, transportation, waste, water, and human experience between 2018 and 2019, ALARGAN discovered numerous ways to improve their performance, eventually earning a 90% satisfaction rating from employees."
