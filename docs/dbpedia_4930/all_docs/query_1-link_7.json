        "text": "Moral philosopher and political economist\n\nAdam Smith studied moral philosophy under Francis Hutcheson. He was appointed Professor of Logic at Glasgow University in 1751, changing to the professorship of Moral Philosophy in 1752. His first major work, 'Theory of Moral Sentiments' was produced in 1759. A well-paid tutoring post to the 3rd duke of Buccleuch, allowed him to see contintental Europe and meet Voltaire, Turgot, and Quesney. He devoted ten years to completion of his most famous work, 'Inquiry into the Nature of Wealth of Nations', which was published in 1776 and sold out within six months. His ideas on economic freedom, division of labour, and the function of markets in a local and worldwide context led to the creation of the discipline of political economy.\n\nAdam Smith is one of the famous Scots commemorated in our Archivists' Garden.
