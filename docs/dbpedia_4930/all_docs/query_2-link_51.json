        "text": "Smith was born in Kirkcaldy, in Fife, Scotland, in 1723, in the family of a postal worker. Smith's father died two months before he was born.\n\nHe graduated from secondary and high school, was one of the most educated people of his time. Smith entered the University of Glasgow when he was 14 and studied moral philosophy. In 1740, he was the graduate scholar presented to undertake postgraduate studies at Balliol College, Oxford, under the Snell Exhibition. His time at Oxford was not a happy one, according to his letters. Near the end of his time there, he began suffering from shaking fits, probably the symptoms of a nervous breakdown. He left Oxford University in 1746, before his scholarship ended.\n\nSmith began delivering public lectures in 1748 at the University of Edinburgh. In 1750, Smith met the philosopher David Hume, who was his senior by more than a decade. In 1751, Smith earned a professorship at Glasgow University teaching logic courses. When the head of Moral Philosophy in Glasgow died the next year, Smith took over the position.\n\nIn 1759 he published his book \"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\". In 1762, the University of Glasgow conferred on Smith the title of Doctor of Laws (LL.D.). At the end of 1763, he obtained an offer from Charles Townshend—who had been introduced to Smith by David Hume—to tutor his stepson, Henry Scott, the young Duke of Buccleuch. Smith resigned from his professorship in 1764 to take the tutoring position.\n\nThe Wealth of Nations was published in 1776 and was an instant success, selling out its first edition in only six months.\n\nSmith's economics theory reflected historical conditions of English capitalist development in the 18th century. Karl Marx characterized Smith as \"a generalizing economist of the manufactural period\". The influence of the manufactural period was reflected in the fact that Smith attributed the decisive role in the development of productive forces to the manufactural division of labor, considering the manufactory as a typical form of enterprise. Smith acted as an ideologist of the bourgeoisie in the period when it played a progressive role. Lenin characterized Smith as \"a great ideologist of the advanced bourgeoisie\". Smith was not a conscious defender of the bourgeoisie, but objectively, regardless of his subjective sympathies, he defended provisions corresponding to the requirements and interests of the development of the productive forces of capitalist society.\n\nThe starting point of the economics theory is the position on the \"natural order\". Under the \"natural order\" he understood the \"normal\" social order, corresponding to human nature and subject to objective economic laws, acting independently of the will and desire of people. This doctrine was metaphysical in nature. In fact, Smith identified \"the natural order\" with capitalism, which he considered as the only \"normal\" social order corresponding to the nature of the man. Smith did not deny the existence of other economic orders, but he believed that such orders contradicted the requirements of political economy. However, in spite of its metaphysical character, the development of the doctrine of \"natural order\" played a positive role. It pushed Smith on the way of revealing inner laws of bourgeois society. But Smith did not always manage to hold on to scientific positions. He often passed from scientific analysis to description of phenomena in that perverted and twisted form in which they appear during surface observation. This led to the inevitable combination of scientific and vulgar elements, to numerous contradictions in his teaching.\n\nSmith died in the northern wing of Panmure House in Edinburgh on 17 July 1790 after a painful illness."
