Nine speakers and 30 participants explored meanings of 'liberalism,' what it would mean to say it has failed, whether it has failed, and, whatever the assessment, what to do.

At the conference we workshopped papers exploring connections between religion, politics, and economics in eighteenth-century Scottish ideas, and the relevance of those connections for current discussions about the state of liberalism. Conference papers are to be published in January 2023 as a special issue of Research in the History of Economic Thought and Methodology. The conference program may be viewed here.\n\nSmith and Leo XIII, Economics and Ethics\n\nOn October 30, 2021 we joined with Christendom College to bring ideas in Smithian political economy and ethics into conversation with the Leonine tradition of Catholic social teaching, focusing on commercial ethics, entrepreneurship, property, and the relation between economics and the common good.

The conference featured presentations and comments from Smith fellows and program alumni, faculty from Catholic University, and other senior scholars in the greater D.C. area. The gathering facilitated a conversation on the relation between Catholic social thought—especially in the tradition of Pope Leo XIII—and the moral philosophy and economics of Adam Smith. The conference program is available here.\n\nLiberty Fund Books to Program Fellows!\n\nIn Spring 2021 Liberty Fund provided a wealth of books to Program fellows, at a generous discount to the Program.
