Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to congratulate Shana Chandler and Brandon West on the birth of their son, Hudson Scott West. Hudson Scott was born this morning, March 29, 2012, at 1:32 a.m., in Washington, DC. Weighing eight pounds and ten ounces, Hudson Scott measured twenty- one and one-quarter inches long. I understand that both he and his mother are doing very well. I am excited by this blessing, and I am extremely happy for Shana, Brandon, and the West and Chandler families. I wish them all the very best. ____________________"
