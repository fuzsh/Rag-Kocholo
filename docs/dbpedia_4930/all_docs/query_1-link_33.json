        "text": "Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations\n\nNote: this Renascence Editions text was converted into HTML from the University of Adelaide's copy of the ERIS Project ASCII etext. Any errors that have crept into the transcription are the fault of the present publisher.\n\nThe following is an excerpt from Book IV of The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith, a Scottish philosopher and economist. The book was originally published in 1776. In this selection Smith presents the metaphor of the invisible hand, which has become known as one of the key ideas about capitalist economies. Smith argues that if everyone is left alone to work for his or her own interest, then it will help the economy as a whole. The effect is that the economy is balanced as if by an invisible hand.\n\nAn Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations\n\nBook IV\n\n. . .\n\nThe produce of industry is what it adds to the subject or materials upon which it is employed. In proportion as the value of this produce is great or small, so will likewise be the profits of the employer. But it is only for the sake of profit that any man employs a capital in the support of industry; and he will always, therefore, endeavour to employ it in the support of that industry of which the produce is likely to be of the greatest value, or to exchange for the greatest quantity either of money or of other goods.\n\nBut the annual revenue of every society is always precisely equal to the exchangeable value of the whole annual produce of its industry, or rather is precisely the same thing with that exchangeable value. As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.\n\nWhat is the species of domestic industry which his capital can employ, and of which the produce is likely to be of the greatest value, every individual, it is evident, can, in his local situation, judge much better than any statesman or lawgiver can do for him. The statesman who should attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals would not only load himself with a most unnecessary attention, but assume an authority which could safely be trusted, not only to no single person, but to no council or senate whatever, and which would nowhere be so dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and presumption enough to fancy himself fit to exercise it."
