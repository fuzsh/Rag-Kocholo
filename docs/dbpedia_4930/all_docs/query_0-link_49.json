        "text": "Adam P. Smith\n\nA truck accident lawyer who holds negligent parties accountable\n\n“There are no problems we cannot solve together, and very few we can solve by ourselves.” – Lyndon B. Johnson, 36th President of the United States\n\nAdam is a trial attorney representing individuals who have been seriously injured in tractor-trailer, car, and premises liability accidents. Prior to joining Fried Goldberg LLC, Adam was a partner at a firm specializing in the defense of car accident cases. He worked at his prior firm for eight years and gained extensive experience in this area of law, including fourteen jury trials in which he acted as lead counsel for the defense.\n\nThis experience helped Adam understand the factors insurance companies use to evaluate injury claims, and he now uses that knowledge and his skills as a trial lawyer to help those who were injured by the negligence of others.\n\nAdam earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Richmond in 2005, where he majored in Rhetoric and Communication Studies and was inducted into Lambda Pi Eta, the National Communication Association’s official honor society at four-year colleges and universities.\n\nFrom 2005 through 2007, he worked as a paralegal at a prominent international law firm in Washington, D.C. He moved to Atlanta, Georgia in 2007 to attend Emory University School of Law, where he was awarded a Dean’s Honor Scholarship and was a member of the Moot Court Society."
