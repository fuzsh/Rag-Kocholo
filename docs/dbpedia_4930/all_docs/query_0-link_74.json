        "text": "Adam Smith (D)\n\nDistrict 9 (Puget Sound--Tacoma; parts of King, Pierce and Thurston counties)\n\nBORN: June 15, 1965; Washington, D.C.\n\nEDUCATION: Fordham U, B.A., 1987; U of Washington, J.D., 1990\n\nFAMILY: Wife, Sara\n\nRELIGION: Christian\n\nMILITARY: None\n\nOCCUPATION: City prosecutor\n\nPOLITICAL CAREER: Washington Senate, 1990-\n\nADDRESS: P.O. Box 5142, Redondo 98054. Tel.: 206-529-2460\n\nAided by his campaign strategy of knocking on every door in the district twice, Smith became a state Senator at age 25. A moderate, he worked for tougher penalties for drunk driving and domestic violence, but also supported traditionally liberal measures like gun control. He favors funding vocational programs and college loans and is against cuts in Head Start and school lunches. In a year of possibilities for Washington's Democrats, Smith has the best chance of all.\n\nTHE ISSUES\n\nBudget NO\n\nMedicare NO\n\nDefense YES\n\nAbortion NO\n\nGuns YES\n\nGays YES\n\nBosnia NO\n\nNAFTA NO\n\nWelfare YES\n\nMedical Leave YES\n\n(For an explanation of these issues, see the front of this guide.)\n\nQUOTE OF NOTE: \"People say I'm too arrogant, I'm too confident. But you need that level of confidence to say no to the President.\"\n\nRandy Tate (R)\n\nDistrict 9\n\nBORN: Nov. 23, 1965, Puyallup\n\nEDUCATION: Tacoma Community College, A.A., 1986; Western Washington U, B.A., 1990\n\nFAMILY: Wife, Julie; one child\n\nRELIGION: Baptist\n\nMILITARY: None\n\nOCCUPATION: Mobile-home park owner\n\nPOLITICAL CAREER: Washington House, 1989-94; U.S. House, 1994-\n\nADDRESS: P.O. Box 4216, Federal Way 98063. Tel.: 206-874-4646\n\nIn 1994 Tate parlayed his state legislative experience into a seat in Congress. Though he was the youngest G.O.P. freshman in the House, his youth didn't soften his conservative agenda: he voted to ease the Clean Water Act and to relax a law excluding court evidence illegally obtained by police. His proposal to bar illegal immigrants from becoming U.S. citizens was passed in modified form this fall. In this centrist district, Tate is running a close race with Adam Smith.\n\nTHE ISSUES\n\nBudget YES\n\nMedicare YES\n\nDefense NO\n\nAbortion YES\n\nGuns NR\n\nGays NR\n\nBosnia YES\n\nNAFTA NR\n\nWelfare YES\n\nMedical Leave NR\n\n(For an explanation of these issues, see the front of this guide.)\n\nQUOTE OF NOTE: \"Illegal immigrants come to the United States at the expense of those who ... play by the rules and come to America legally.\""
