        "text": "Text\n\n2023 marks the tercentenary of the birth of Adam Smith. Born in 1723, Smith is known as a leading social philosopher and political economist, and is often referred to as the \"Father of Economics\". His book, 'An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations' (more commonly referred to as 'The Wealth of Nations'), first published in 1776 is the basis on which much of our current economic thinking is founded.\n\nOn the 21st June 2023, Social Justice Ireland will host a seminar to commemorate Adam Smith.\n\nText\n\nProf. Charles M.A. Clark of St. John's University, New York, is a Smith scholar. His work includes an exploration of the influence of the 'natural law' doctrine on Adam Smith - from natural theology to moral philosophy. In 1992, Clark published a book 'Economic Theory and Natural Philosophy: The Search for the Natural Laws of the Economy' which expanded on this theme and shed further light on the development of economic thought, arguing that \"if economic theory is to be truly scientific it must develop a theory that is based upon history and social structure\".\n\nText\n\nDr Sarah Otten is Programme Director for the Arts & Humanities programmes at Carlow College, Ireland. She is also a lecturer in moral and political philosophy with a particular interest in applied ethics. Her PhD looks at justice in the writings of Adam Smith (Trinity College Dublin, 2017). She has delivered papers at national and international conferences on the sociable individual in Adam Smith and on analysis of Social Care policy documents from a Care Ethics perspective.\n\nText\n\nPhD Heikki Hiilamo works as a research professor at National Institute for Health and Welfare and as a professor of social policy at University of Helsinki. Previously Hiilamo has worked as research professor at Social Insurance Institution on Finland. He has worked as visiting professor at University of California San Francisco and VID Specialized University Oslo. Hiilamo has the title of Docent from University of Tampere and University of Eastern Finland. Hiilamo’s research interests include family policy, poverty, inequality, welfare state research and tobacco control. He is specialized in quantitative methods. His articles have appeared in leading international journals including Journal of Social Policy, Journal of European Social Policy, International Journal of Epidemiology, American Journal of Public Health and Social Science and Medicine. In 2018 he published a book on household debts for Edward Elgar. In 2016 Hiilamo was awarded with State Award for Public Information.\n\nText\n\nThis event will be Chaired by Social Justice Ireland CEO, Dr. Seán Healy and will take place in the Members' Room of The Royal Irish Academy, 19 Dawson Street, Dublin 2, D02 HH58. Admission is free, but registration is advised as places are limited."
