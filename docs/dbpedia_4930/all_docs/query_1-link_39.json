        "text": "He began his education with a private tutor at home before attending the Burgh School of Kirkcaldy, where he spent eight years.\n\nSmith entered the University of Glasgow at the age of 14. He studied Latin, Greek, Logic, Moral Philosophy, Mathematics, and Natural Philosophy.\n\nSmith was appointed the Professor of Logic at Glasgow University before changing to the position of Chair of Moral Philosophy.\n\nAdam Smith published his first work, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, which closely examined the moral thinking of his time.\n\nSmith accepted a tutoring post to the 3rd Duke of Buccleuch which involved a two-year tour of Europe. He met key figures of the French Enlightenment.\n\nAfter returning home to Kirkcaldy, he completed work on The Wealth of Nations. He investigated the roles of productivity, division of labor, and free markets.\n\nAn Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations was published in five volumes. It was influential in its time, and became a fundamental work in classical economics."
