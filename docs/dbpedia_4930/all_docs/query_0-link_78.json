        "text": "Selected Publications\n\nBooks\n\nAuthor: Knowledge and Coordination: A Liberal Interpretation. Oxford University Press, 2012 (paperback 2013).\n\nCo-editor (with F.E. Foldvary): The Half-Life of Policy Rationales: How New Technology Affects Old Policy Issues, a volume about how new technology makes obsolete many of the standard arguments against free enterprise. New York University Press, 2003.\n\nEditor: What Do Economists Contribute?, a volume of previous published articles by R. Coase, T. Schelling, F. Hayek, F. Graham, W. Hutt, I. Kirzner, D. McCloskey, C. Philbrook, and G. Tullock on being an economist; the central theme is that what society most needs from economists is instruction and enlightenment in the basics of the discipline. New York: New York University Press (softback and hardback), 1999; London: Macmillan (hardback), 1999. London: Palgrave (softback edition), 2001. [Chinese translation: Law Press, China, 2005.]\n\nEditor: Reputation: Studies in the Voluntary Elicitation of Good Conduct, an interdisciplinary volume of articles, mostly previously published, on the emergence and maintenance of reputation and trust by nongovernmental means. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1997.\n\nCo-author: Curb Rights: A Foundation for Free Enterprise in Urban Transit (with A. Moore and B. Reja). Washington, DC: Brookings Institution, Washington D. C., 1997. The book argues that curb zones and bus stops are a crucial component of transit services. Many problems of urban transit can be traced to the commons problem existing at the curb. Privatizing curb zones in five-year leases would create a foundation for free enterprise in urban transit. The book won a 1998 Sir Antony Fisher International Memorial Award from the Atlas Foundation. It has been reviewed in JEL, EJ, SEJ, Trans. Res., JAPA, Regulation, and elsewhere.
