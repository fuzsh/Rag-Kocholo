Since ancient times, local craftsmen have improved carpet weaving, embroidery, wood carving, and silk fabric.\n\nBAKU TOURISM ZONE\n\nIf the image of Azerbaijan on the map looks like a bird flying towards the sea, its “beak” is the Absheron Peninsula. Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, an ancient and always young city, is located on the southwest coast of this peninsula.\n\nThe population of the city is about 2 million people. Although Baku is separated from Absheron settlements from an administrative point of view (their number is 32), historically these settlements are connected with the capital both from a cultural, economic and spatial point of view. Therefore, the whole Absheron Peninsula together with the capital is called “Great Baku”.\n\nIn Absheron and Baku, there are the main transport highways of the republic — the Heydar Aliyev International Airport, the big seaport in Baku bay (by the way, it is the largest port in the whole Caspian Sea), the railway station in Baku, and the highways connecting the capital of the republic with the regions.\n\nThe main pipelines for the transportation of oil and gas start here, from Absheron. Baku is the main point of the TRASECA (Europe-Caucasus-Asia) International Transport Corridor. As part of this project, Azerbaijan participates in the restoration of the historic Great Silk Road Route.\n\nCLIMATE. The Absheron Peninsula is located 28 meters below the world ocean level. The climate of Baku and Absheron is mild-hot, semi-desert and steppe, characterized only by the winds characteristic of Absheron. The so-called “Khazri” north wind cools the air in summer, and in winter it cools excessively. The so-called” GILAVAR ” south wind brings the heat in summer and modifies the cold in winter. In general, the climate of modern Baku has become quite mild due to the gardens and parks where Baku people grow with pleasure. At the beginning of the XX century, it was impossible to get to the streets of Baku by a strong wind and dust, and today Baku has turned into a city with a warm and comfortable lifestyle.\n\nMINERALS. There are oil, gas, construction Stone (called “badamdash” limestone), salt, sand, and lime deposits in Absheron Peninsula. Masazir, Gala, Boyuk Shor, Khoja Hasan salt lakes in Absheron are very popular. Some of the oldest oil wells in the world are located in Absheron. People used to extract oil from these wells with verdures. Here are a few of the first wells produced by industrial oil.\n\nAzerbaijan ranks first in the world for the number and diversity of mud volcanoes, which are considered a wonderful mystery of nature. Of the 800 known mud volcanoes existing in different countries of the world, 400 are located within the South Caspian oil and gas basin, including more than 300 onshore territories of Azerbaijan, in the Caspian Sea, and on numerous islands.\n\nAll different types of mud volcanoes existing in the world are represented in Azerbaijan. It is no exaggeration to call this land a natural reservoir and laboratory of mud volcanism. Therefore, in recent years, international scientific forms on the issues of volcanism, geodynamics, and seismicity are being held in Baku.\n\nMud volcanoes attract more and more attention from tourists coming to our country. The desert and rocky landscape of Absheron, its volcanoes remind us of the youth period of our planet. There were no people on earth at that time, nor the moon landscapes. But Azerbaijani volcanoes are alive, they breathe…\n\nGOBUSTAN PETROGLYPHS IS AN OPEN-AIR MUSEUM. Petroglyphs, that is, rock paintings, are artistic “archives” of human evolution on Earth. The “documents” of such archives are similar to the first time a person broadcasts his own self to the surrounding world. There are several such “archives” in the open air in Azerbaijan. One of them, probably the largest, is located in Gobustan — the Baku State Historical-ethnographic and artistic Reserve near Baku. Located in the south-eastern foothills of the Greater Caucasus Mountains, this rocky Massif is located near the Caspian Sea on the modern highway, built along the ancient Shirvan road. Numerous rock drawings, ancient human settlements under the rocks, and burial mounds were discovered here. Two archaeologists, who devoted 35 years of his life to the study of Gobustan — D.Rustamov and his wife F.Muradova believes that the most ancient part of Gobustan petroglyphs is a very informative picture of life, despite the simplicity of the most optimistic and self-expression of man in the early period of human development. They studied about 20 rocks in six settlements, excavated about 40 mounds, discovered 300 new rocks and stones with drawings on them. However, the rocks of Gobustan are not only witnesses of the most ancient period of human life. These rocks reflect 15 thousand years of the life of the region — a great time period from the Upper Paleolithic to the Middle Ages.\n\nIn 1939, archaeologist Isaac Jafarzadeh, the first researcher of Gobustan, informed world science about these unique places.\n\nToday, more than 4000 petroglyphs (rock drawings made on the basis of stone carving technique) have been found in Gobustan. These paintings include animal and fishing, domestic scenes, collective dances, various, including sun symbol (swastika, spirals, cross), constellations, men and women (interestingly, women went hunting with men at that time), images of animals such as gazelle, mountain goat, lion, goat, the boat made of cane, two-wheeled cart, and Human Traces. Unusual “dishes”-hollows printed on stone and even decorated with patterns remained intact in Gobustan. There are also unusual “musical instruments” — stones that give powerful sounds. Because each stone has its own timbre, they are called “tambourine stones”.\n\nThere are signs confirming the presence of Roman legionnaires in the I century of our era in Gobustan rocks. This region, which is attractive to be occupied, has not spread from the attention of the Romans. A Latin text was written by the Roman centurions of the 11th lightning Legion on one of the rocks here. This article indicates that at that time Emperor Domitsian Caesar Augustus was in Germanic power in Rome. In 2007, Gobustan was included in the UNESCO “World Heritage” List.\n\nHISTORY OF ABSHERON. Due to the geographical climate and geological factors of Absheron, the entire Absheron Peninsula and the territory of Baku were inhabited 20,000 years ago. (Ancient human settlements were discovered near Yeni Surakhani settlement.). In general, the ancient human settlements on the entire peninsula do not account for the burial mounds of the Bronze Age and the early Iron Age. There are also ancient burial complexes with anthropomorphic figures shaved from stone, on which plot drawings are applied (the villages of Dubendi, Turkan, Hashahuna, Mardakan, Shuvelan). You will not find such complexes in any other region of Azerbaijan and the Caucasus. Ancient human settlements have been discovered on Pirallahi Island, on Lake Zyg, in Binagadi and Amirjan(before the III-I millennium BC). All this shows that the Absheron Peninsula as a whole has attracted people for their peaceful life since ancient times. However, the geostrategic position of this peninsula attracted various invaders.\n\nThe largest settlement in Absheron is MASHTAGHA village. In addition to the remains of human settlements belonging to the Bronze Age and Iron Age, there are also monuments related to the later period: flea ARBUTAY mosque (1414), Khoja Aydemir mosque, GAZIKHANA, Khoja Karbalai Huseyn mosque (XVIII century), a mosque built in XIII-XIV centuries and later added 40 m high minaret, bathhouse belonging to XVII century, OVDAN (sututar, XIX century); tombs of AGIL BABA, Khoja ASLAN, HASANBEK, Khoja Aydemir (XVIII century).\n\nIn “Gala” Baku State Historical and ethnographic reserve located in Absheron village, ancient mosques, roads, ovdans, ancient graves (XV century), baths, human settlements of the Bronze Age are preserved. Gala settlement, which is very peculiar in Absheron, is sometimes called “Old City” in Absheron.\n\nThe temple of fire worshippers in Baku — Ateshgah (firehouse) is of great interest to the guests of the capital. ATESHGAH (XVII century) in SURAKHANI settlement is located on the rock. Here, for millennia, gas, which has naturally emerged from the Earth, has been burned. A very interesting natural phenomenon can be observed near the village of MAMMADLI: natural gases emanating from the ground are constantly burning here at the foot of the rock. Therefore, this place is called “Yanardag”. In ancient times, there were many such places in Absheron.\n\nVery ancient “tracks” were discovered in Absheron. Many of these spots, which are a complete analog of mysterious “roads” on the island of Malta, lie directly inside the sea and disappear there…\n\nBaku. This city was one of the first seaports built on the Caspian coast since ancient times. Using one of the ancient sea routes — Astrakhan along the Volga, from there by sea to Baku, boats of the invaders and peaceful trade caravans from Russia and European countries came to Baku. Merchants and travelers continued on their way to the southwest, passing through the territory of Georgia to the countries on the Black Sea coast, east, Iran, China, and India. If Azerbaijan is a country located on the conditional border of Europe and Asia, Baku and Absheron can be considered one of the main gates of this country. Residents of European countries had to go through this gate to get to know Asia better. Residents of Asia and the Far East, eager for Europe, did not bypass Baku either. A branch of the Great Silk Road passed from here.\n\nSome written sources information about the city BARUKA in ancient Caucasian Albania. According to scientists, this name belongs to Baku. In various written sources of the ancient period, ancient names of Baku City such as Bagavan, Ateshi Bagavan, Bakukh, Bakuya, Bad-Kuba, Baku, and Baka can be found.\n\nThe reward of seeing people truly fulfilled by their sense of purpose. As a result of a strong earthquake in the XII century, Shamakhi suffered serious damage and Shirvanshah I Akhsitan, whose wife and children died, moved the capital of Shirvan state to Baku. Thus, Baku became one of the main cities of Shirvan. Shirvanshah erected the fortress walls of Icheri Sheher in his new capital and dug trenches in these walls. The people of the city were engaged in crafts, prepared carpets, copper and bronze dishes, and weapons. Many of these samples of folk art are now kept in museums of different countries of the world. Baku became a strategic port in the Caspian Sea, which created favorable conditions for its further progress.\n\nThe Shirvanshahs created a powerful fleet in the Caspian Sea. During the reign of shirvanshah I Khalilullah (1417-1462) a lot of construction work was carried out in Baku, the economy and culture strengthened. In 1501, Shah Ismail Safavi conquered Baku. During the reign of Shah TAHMASIB (1538) the state of Shirvanshahs became part of the Safavids state. After the disintegration of this state in the XVII century, the independent Baku Khanate was established here.\n\nAt that time, the Russian Empire’s geopolitical interest in the Caucasus was very strong. In this regard, Baku was of particular importance. The Russian Tsar Peter I marched to the Caspian Sea. In 1723, he sent an expedition to the Caspian Sea, and in the same year, Peter’s troops captured the entire Caspian region, including Baku, Shamakhi, Shirvan, Derbent, and the Caspian cities of Iran. The wars between Russia and Iran ended with the conclusion of the GULUSTAN peace treaty in 1813. According to this agreement, Azerbaijan was divided into two parts: the northern part was taken by Russia and the southern part by Iran.\n\nMONUMENTS OF BAKU. The most interesting among historical monuments in Baku is the old Icheri Sheher, surrounded on three sides by a great fortress wall. The palace of the Shirvanshahs and its complex of various buildings (mausoleum, saray mosque, divankhana, Palace bath, mausoleum of the palace scientist Seyid Yahya Bakuvi (dervish turbine)) are located here. The palace of the Shirvanshahs was built by Shirvanshah I Khalilullah (in 1417-1462) and his son Farrukh Yasser (1962-1501). Among the ancient monuments in ICHERISHEHER, the Juma Mosque is also of interest. There is a text written by SULTAN OLJAYTUN (XIII century) in the building of this mosque. The streets of ICHERISHEHER are very narrow. Sometimes the passage between the houses is so narrow that when a person opens his hands, he grabs the whole street. In numerous small shops, there are carpets, ceramic products, copper dishes, and other ancient and modern products, which are handmade by folk craftsmen. it is possible to buy things. You can get acquainted with the national cuisine of Azerbaijan in the restaurants of the ancient Caravanserai building in Icheri Sheher.\n\nThe city looks like an amphitheater located on the slopes of rocky hills of Baku from the top of it – Highland Park or from the side of the sea. It reminds me of a goby on the Seacoast. On the outskirts of Icheri Sheher near the great Baku Boulevard, one of the most important historical-architectural monuments of our country, the Maiden Tower, which has become the symbol of Baku, is erected.\n\nThe Maiden Tower is dated to the XII century. According to scientists, this fortress was for military and defense purposes and is part of a whole complex of the military—defense buildings starting from the northern borders of Azerbaijan — Derbent fortress. The complex of defense fortifications Gilgilchay began from the sea. Many fortresses have been erected along this barrier which ends with a big tower in the Chiraggala mountains.\n\nHowever, scientists have not yet been able to reveal all the secrets of the Maiden Tower. For example, there are facts about the construction of this fortress earlier. Many bakuvians consider the Maiden Tower, a unique example of the history and architecture of our country, very important not only from a religious, defense, and scientific (astronomic) point of view but also from an esoteric point of view. Therefore, there are many legends about the Maiden Tower and its name in the City folklore. Since 2000 it has been included in the UNESCO “World Heritage” List.\n\nToday Baku is a modern city with the unique beauty of the East and features of a modern megalopolis. Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, has several museums: the Museum of Azerbaijani history, The Museum of Literature, The Museum of musical culture, The Carpet Museum, The Theater Museum, as well as the Museum of the founder of modern Azerbaijani music Uzeyir HAJIBEYOV, the famous Azerbaijani composer Niyazi, the composer and jazz performer Vagif MUSTAFAZADE, memorial museums of world-famous musician Mstislav Rostropovich born in Baku, writer and playwrights Huseyn Javid, Jafar JABBARLI, Mammad Said ORDUBADI, and others, unique miniature book museum are functioning.\n\nOf course, the new symbol of modern Baku is the Heydar Aliyev Center. It is a beautiful building, surrounded on four sides by various facades. The adjacent territory is neatly decorated, there are fountains, stairs, and escalators. This is a famous work of Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid.\n\nThe small town” Little Venice ” is one of the beautiful places of the seaside National Park in Baku. This small town, reminiscent of Venice of Italy, adorns the capital of Azerbaijan with its beautiful appearance. In the 60s of the XX century, “Little Venice” was established on Baku Boulevard and became a favorite place for recreation of Baku citizens and guests of the city.\n\nSeaside Boulevard is a charming corner of Baku, one of the favorite places for recreation of residents and guests of Baku City. In 2009, The Boulevard celebrated its 100th anniversary. If before the reconstruction the length of the boulevard was 16 kilometers, then after the reconstruction it became 25 kilometers. In March 2014, a new 60-meter-high observation wheel was opened in the new tabloid section of Primorsky National Park. Inspired by the “sails” of the Sydney Opera House on the boulevard, there are attractions such as the Park Bulvar Mall and the Caspian W. At the end of the boulevard there is the National Flag Square (World Flag Square) with the flag and the flagpole. A little away from the flag there is a sports and concert complex “Crystal Hall”, designed for the “Eurovision-2012” song contest.\n\nSince carpet weaving is the oldest art in Azerbaijan, it is not surprising that the world’s first specialized museum for Carpet collection, preservation, and study was created in Azerbaijan.\n\nThe ultramodern architectural complex, which forms the new symbol of the capital of Azerbaijan, suits the overall look of the city. Its name is self-explanatory Flame Towers, that is, “flame” or “glowing” towers are three giant buildings resembling fiery tongues. It is not necessary to go out to the side to see them, because these towers are visible everywhere.\n\nThere are numerous exhibition and concert halls, art galleries, theaters, sports complexes, stadiums, swimming pools, hotels, and restaurants in the capital.\n\nThere are many beaches in Baku’s circuit along the entire perimeter of the Absheron Peninsula. In 5 months of the year, you can sunbathe and bathe on the beaches of Absheron. There are many sunny and hot days here. In summer, when the heat decreases, discos and nightclubs begin to work on the beaches after sunset. Here, numerous hotels, rest houses, and sanatoriums on the Caspian Sea coast offer their services to tourists and holidaymakers.\n\nNORTH ROUTE: KHIZI— SIYAZAN— DAVACHI— GUBA — KHACHMAZ— NABRAN— GUSAR\n\nKHIZI\n\nKHIZI district is located in the Guba-Khachmaz region of Azerbaijan. Khizi is the closest to Baku among the administrative regions of the republic with mountainous terrain: the distance between Baku and Khizi is only 70 km. The climate in this region is mild-hot and precipitation falls less. The eastern part of the district is the Caspian coast.\n\nOn the road to Khizi, 10 km from the BAKU-ROSTOV highway, one can observe a very interesting natural phenomenon: layers of geological rocks create on the surface of hills a landscape of its own color. Experts say that a similar geological phenomenon can only be found on earth, except here — in the Valley of death in the United States.\n\nOne of the most beautiful reserves of the Republic, “ALTIAGHAJ” Reserve is located in Khizi district. 90% of its area consists of forests. This reserve was created to preserve rare species of animals and plants on the south-eastern slopes of the Greater Caucasus and to prevent erosion processes from taking place here. One of the caravan camps established during Shirvanshahs ‘ rule was located here. The meaning of the name “Altiagach” is related to the words “6 trees”: the point is that the word “tree” is an ancient unit of length and is approximately 7 kilometers.\n\nSince the distance from Altiaghaj to Shamakhi is 42 km, that is, “6 trees”, this place was named as such. The ancient caravan route linking Shamakhi and Derbent passed here. Lovers of pedestrian tourism still make tourist trips from here to Maraza and Shamakhi. Yashma Reserve is also located in the territory of Khizi region (near Sumgayit city). The Reserve, which covers an area of 4 hectares, has favorable conditions for hunting and fishing for water birds.\n\nThe administrative center of the district is KHIZI city. The distance from Baku is 104 km. Khizi is the homeland of the famous writer and playwright of Azerbaijan, Jafar Jabbarli who has done a lot for the development of national cinema art. At present, the Azerbaijan State Film Studio bears his name. Well-known cultural figures of Azerbaijan Mikayil Mushfig and Jabir Novruz are also originally from Khizi. For travelers, tourists, and simply vacationers who come here, a wonderful recreation area called “Paradise Garden” has been created near the city. This zone is located in the mountain forest, on the Bank of Atachay River, near Altiaghaj Reserve. 8 km from Khizi there is another recreation area called “GIZILGAZMA”.\n\nSIYAZAN\n\nSiyazan district is located in the north of the capital of Azerbaijan, along the coast of the Caspian Sea. Climate dry semi-desert climate, the landscape consists of sparse forests and shrubs. Wolves, wild cats, jackals, rabbits, and other species are common in the animal world. Several species of waterfowl can be found in the coastal zone. GILGILCHAY and ATACHAY rivers flow through the territory of this region.\n\nDuring the early Middle Ages, the second line of the Caspian defense fortifications was passing here (the first line of these fortifications is in Derbent). This line is included in the list of historical and cultural monuments protected by the state of Azerbaijan. GILGILCHAY defensive fortification was also recommended by UNESCO to be included in the list of World Heritage Cultural Monuments in the complex “Caspian defense fortifications”. Archaeologists have established that the construction of the defense fortification Gilgilchay began long ago, even before our era, additional construction works were carried out and the fortification was further strengthened.\n\nThe walls of the fortifications begin directly inside the sea (for many years the water level in the Caspian Sea has undergone periodic changes). The fortress walls, stretching for several kilometers, ending in the magnificent CHIRAGGALA Watchtower (V century). It is worth climbing this tower: its historical significance lies in its place, looking from the top of the mountain, a very beautiful view of the sea and the surrounding mountains opens.\n\nHere, between the sea and the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains, there is a convenient passage for travel from Azerbaijan to other countries in the North. From ancient times, the invaders who came from the territory called the Caspian passage from neighboring states and distant provinces entered the territory of our country. They attacked Azerbaijan, made robberies in the port of Baku, sometimes even went to the districts in the inner part of the country. Therefore, this fortification was of defensive nature and was used to deliver signals to Absheron (Baku) and later to all border regions of ancient Azerbaijan. The dimensions and defensive purpose of the fortification walls (he also protected the passage to the Great Silk Road) make it possible to compare it with the Great Wall of China, but this facility has not been restored yet.\n\nIn the resort town of GALAALTI, located just a short distance from the Chirag gala Tower, the Chiraggala sanatorium attracts attention. On its territory, there is a spring of sulfur-containing mineral water, which has a curative value. This water is especially useful for patients with stones in the urinary bladder and gallbladder. Along the way to the sanatorium, there are numerous kebab houses, cafes, and small campsites. Most of them work only in summertime.\n\nFragments of another defensive fortification Beshbarmag near ZARAT village were preserved. Among the people, these remains are called baba in Khizirzin. And near the village of Sedan, the remains of the religious fortress attract attention.\n\nCarpet weaving patterned carving on wood, making of folk musical instruments are widely developed in this region. The center of the district is 103 km from the city of Siyazan.\n\nThere is no hotel in Siyazan. Therefore, those who come here can stay in private houses or in the Chiraggala sanatorium, which is a little distance from the city. If you want to have lunch in Siyazan, you can use the services of “GORUS”, “ZAFARAN” or “CHIRAGGALA” restaurants. As the city is located near the Caspian Sea, these restaurants offer a wide range of fish dishes in meat and vegetable dishes.\n\nSHABRAN\n\nLocated in the north of Baku, the eastern border of the Shabran region stretches along the coast of the Caspian Sea. Such a name of the district is probably due to a large number of camel caravan routes here. Residents of this region used to keep camels, and visitors from neighboring regions bought and sold not only camels, but also birds, animals, butter and dairy products, honey, wool (camel and sheep wool), and carpets. In addition, there were those who came to join the caravan or rent camels and sarvan for themselves. In 2010, the name of Davachi district was changed to Shabran district.\n\nA hunting farm called Aghibir was established in the territory of devechi district at a distance of 12 km from the Sea coast. With an area of 1180 hectares, the farm can hunt waterfowl and fish. Three interconnected lakes, located in Agzhibir, have access to the sea. There are also small houses and boats to welcome hunters. There are a lot of forests (21,500 hectares) in these forests: bears, foxes, wolves, jackals, wild boars, and gazelles. Birds, including water birds, can be found as turaj, Partridge, goose, duck, crane, Cormorant, coot, and other species. The relief of the territory is very diverse. Here, along with Plains, foothills, there are also rocks and mountains. The place called kechigaya is very popular among both tourists and local residents. Here the river flows through the rocks, and mineral springs containing a lot of sulfur attract attention. The most famous historical monument of Archaeology in the region is Shabran city (5-18 centuries), located near the village of Shahnazarli. Shabran was one of the largest trade and craft centers of Azerbaijan in the Middle Ages. The art of silk production, pottery, and glazing were particularly highly developed here. As a result of archaeological excavations carried out in the 80s of the 20th century, the discovery of many ceramic products imported from both local and other countries shows that Shabran had local trade relations with some countries of the East. Fragments of water pipelines built in 14th century were also discovered during archaeological excavations. This pipeline supplied the city with drinking water from a fountain located more than 10 km from the city.\n\nGalaalti is an original and extremely attractive balneological resort of Azerbaijan. It is located in the picturesque foothills of the Greater Caucasus at an altitude of 1000 m above sea level. Crystal clear air, located on picturesque forested slopes on the shore of the Caspian Sea, is a place of special natural beauty. Here mountain air merges with sea air and creates a low humid climate, which makes people feel comfortable. “Galaalti sanatorium” is especially useful for the treatment of kidney stone disease in medical and recreational resort complex in the territory of which there is a new unique architectural style and a mineral spring with curative sulfur water. The area is rich in mineral waters and mud volcanoes. Oil reserves have been found in the depths of the oxidized-Zeyva forests. On the way, you can see many oil rigs. There are two historical and archaeological monuments on the territory of the district. As for Shabran, we first get to know Chiraggala Castle. The meaning of “Galaalti” in Azerbaijani is “lower than the tower.” The name of “Chiraggala” Castle is directly related to the fact that it is located at the bottom of the fortress.\n\nGulistan Iram City (18-19 centuries) is located in Gandob village. Numerous archaeological sites dating back to 3-2 centuries BC were found in the Shabran district. The materials found during the excavations can be found in the historical and local lore Museum in Shabran.\n\nThe administrative center of the district, Shabran city, is located 122 km from Baku. Local” PIRABEDIL “and” HERAT PIRABEDIL ” according to the classification of specialists belong to the Guba carpet school. These carpets, which are original and unique, are popular among lovers of hand-woven carpet products.\n\nShabran city is an administrative center located 122 km from Baku. Shabran was founded in the V-VII centuries. In the IX-X centuries, it became the main political-administrative, trade-cultural and cultural center of the state of Shirvanshahs. In the middle of the XI century, the Tomb of the Shirvanshahs family was located in Shabran. The name of the city was later given to the environment.\n\nGUBA\n\nGuba district is one of the most developed agricultural regions of Azerbaijan. Fruits and vegetables grown here are exported to the capital markets, processed at local canning industry enterprises, and also exported to other countries. Despite a large number of fruits and vegetables grown in the Guba region, every Azerbaijani remembers his apple orchards when he says “Guba”.People who sell apples in Baku markets, while praising their goods, certainly emphasize that it is a Guba purchase. Guba region, which has a rich flora, is also represented by a wide range of medicinal plants. Hawthorn, Juniper, nightshade, andis, devadaban, effedra, and a number of other medicinal plants are grown here.\n\nThere are many picturesque corners around Guba. Gachresh, Balbulag, as well as Tangaalti ravine, the depth of which is from 400 to 600 meters, have become particularly popular and are of great interest to tourists.\n\nThe famous AFURJA waterfall on Valvalachay is included in the list of natural monuments of Azerbaijan and is protected by the state. There are other waterfalls here that attract the attention of tourists and travelers due to their uniqueness and uniqueness. It is a pleasure to stroll through these picturesque places on tourist trails. As you ascend to the mountains, tall trees are replaced by bushes, and above — on the Bank of Khashichay River thermal waters flow from the rocks of the mountain gorge. In ancient times, skilled craftsmen created three holes in rock and made self-made baths, and built their edges with stone. Those who come here can bathe in healing hot water containing sulfur-hydrogens in these baths. According to competent people, a bath made of natural stone enhances the healing effect of water.\n\nThe famous French writer Alexander Dumas visited these places while traveling to Azerbaijan. When he camped near the road, the people of Guba camped nearby invite him to their bonfires in order to relax and have a snack. It is very impressive how the people of Guba skillfully cut and clean the sheep and share it with Dumas. The biggest traveler of our time, Norwegian scientist Thor Heyerdahl also visited Guba during his visit to Azerbaijan. He thought that the “aslar “mentioned in the” Edda” Epic were the ancient ancestors of Azerbaijanis and moved to the north of Europe during the great resettlement of peoples. In the Guba region, the population of Khinalig village, located 65 km from Guba in high mountains (2500 meters above sea level) is a separate unique ethnic group. The ancient language of the Khinaligs is not similar to any of the modern languages of the world. The people of Khinaliq also speak Azerbaijani but have preserved their language. Khinalig phenomenon is one of the most interesting ethnographic mysteries not only in the history of Azerbaijan but also in the history of mankind in general.\n\nThe sacred sanctuary is located near Khinalig. In this sanctuary of the IX century, natural fire emerges from under the Earth. Therefore, this place among the people is called Ateshgah. A unique ethnic group lives in the village of budug. These people have a very rare language. The ancient building called shakhma remained intact. These towers, belonging to the Zoroastrian period and called the “Tower of silence” among the people, were intended for the execution of Zoroastrians ‘ funeral.\n\nGuba city is located on the Bank of Gudialchay River and on the north-eastern slopes of Shah Mountain, which is part of the Greater Caucasus range. The distance from Baku is 168 km, and the height above sea level is 600 meters. Information about the history of Guba city and Guba Khanate, people who made this country famous can be found in Local History Museum. The House-Museum of a famous public figure, writer, and educator Abbasgulu Aga Bakikhanov is also located here. One of bakikhanov’s books, “Gulustani — Iram”, is devoted to the history of Azerbaijan. In essence, this book is the first scientific work on the history of Azerbaijan. There is also a carpet weaving center in Guba.\n\n“Chichi”, “Sirt Chichi”, “Gimil”, “Jimi”, “Yerfi” carpets woven in this area are adornments of a number of museums and private collections of the world.\n\nHistorical monuments such as Sakina Khanum mosque, Juma Mosque, the mausoleum of the 16th century, ancient Eastern baths have been preserved in the city. In the first half of the 18th century, the present Guba, Davachi, Gusar, Khachmaz, Khizi, and Siyazan districts were united in the form of Guba Khanate. Initially, the center of this Khanate was Khudat city, but later Guba Khan Huseynali turned Guba into the center of its Khanate and moved his residence to Guba. Fatali Khan, the most famous ruler of Guba Khanate, tried to unite retail khanates of Azerbaijan under his leadership. He subjugated entire north-eastern Azerbaijan from Derbent to Lankaran. At that time, Jews were invited to settle in Guba, on the Left Bank of Gudyalchay. This settlement, formerly called the Jewish Sloboda, has been called the Red settlement since 1926.\n\nDagestani Khans have always been a source of danger for Guba Khanate from the North. When Russia began to show geopolitical interest in the Caucasus and Transcaucasia, it became much more difficult to protect the borders of Guba Khanate when it decided to establish its regime here. And at the beginning of the 19th century (in 1813) Guba Khanate became part of the Russian Empire.\n\nGuba is a small town, but the territory of the present Guba district, located on the north-eastern slopes of the Greater Caucasus, is very picturesque and you will plunge into the world of beauty as soon as you get out of the city to the Canary Islands. Both Azerbaijani and foreign tourists never leave this region in the spotlight. And bakuvians, especially those who come there in their cars to rest in Guba, often visit the recreation area from Guba on the shore of the Yalama sea, not far from Guba. Those who relax in Yalama (Nabran) do not miss the opportunity to enjoy the rest on the Caspian coast, to enjoy the foothills of Guba forests, to enjoy numerous Springs and natural landscapes. Guba district is one of the most beautiful parts of our country. Given its proximity to the capital, the location of the forest zone with the Caspian coast, numerous tourist bases, and recreation areas, this region is of great importance as a recreational zone of the country.\n\nKHACHMAZ\n\nKHACHMAZ region, which occupies part of the Samur-Shabran lowland, is located in the northeast of Azerbaijan and borders Russia in the North. The main highway and the Baku-Moscow railway pass through the territory of this district. The climate of the region is mild-hot, semi-desert, and dry steppe. But more than 20 hectares of area in the district are covered with forests. There are several rivers, 3 artificial lakes, numerous thermal and mineral springs here.\n\nOn the border with Dagestan, there was a road before. The occupier Scythians, alan, and hunn tribes followed this path. For this purpose, the defense fortification near Caspian, which reached the territory of the present Khachmaz region, was built. One of the ancient city-castles at the beginning of the 18th century — Khudat (which literally means “Gifted”). It has become the capital of Guba Khanate. Near the city of Khudat, groundwater resources are especially abundant. In 1914, a drinking water pipeline was built here from the village of Shollar to Baku.\n\nTraces of Neolithic and Bronze Age human settlements were found in the whole territory of the region. According to scientists, the toponym “KHACHMAZ” is connected with the name of Khachmatak or Khachmat tribes of the Comme Hunn tribes. Subsequently, they became entangled with the local population. It is interesting that one of these tribes moved from the territory of Khachmaz region to the present Oguz region and created Khachmaz village of the same name, then Khachmaz fortress.\n\nAbout 60 historical and cultural monuments are preserved in this region. However, according to archaeologists, the number of such monuments should be much higher, since ancient times the population has been densely populated in this region. Human settlements and mounds of the Bronze Age were discovered near the villages of Molla Burhan, Hulovlu, Garajig, Hasangala, human places of the Middle Ages near the villages of Janakhir and Bostanchi. The Sheikh Yusif mosque (15th century) in the village of Shikhlar refers to the early periods when architectural-mausoleum complexes were established. Subsequently, in the 16th-17th centuries, such complexes became more widespread. Mosques of the 19th century in the villages of Morugoba, Tagaroba, Uzunoba, mosques of the 15th century in the village of Garagortlu, and madrasas were preserved.\n\nThe administrative center of the Khachmaz district is Khachmaz city. Its distance from Baku is 157 km. A special faculty was opened in the local Lyceum because carpet weaving was developed more widely from traditional folk art. Visitors often come here to watch how they weave beautiful carpet patterns with the delicate fingers of young masters. Patterns of these carpets have been passed from generation to generation for centuries and are still preserved.\n\nVisitors to Khachmaz can stay here at “Elit N Hotel”. The second place in the country for its size and improvement is located in the territory of Khachmaz district. Occupying an area from Mukhtadir settlement to Nabran settlement and a little farther along the coast of the Caspian Sea, this recreation area has many tourist bases and boarding houses.\n\nNABRAN\n\nNabran is the largest creative region located on the shores of the Caspian Sea in Khachmaz. An interesting feature of this zone is that the forest begins immediately after the sandy beach, located in a small area. Various tourist bases, camps, boarding houses, and rest houses are located in this forest. Their conditions are very diverse-there is a wide choice of comfortable hotels of the “luxury” type, from abad cottages for several people to tent camps.\n\nGUSAR\n\nDistrict center-Gusar city. Gusar bordering Dagestan is located in the northeast of Azerbaijan at a distance of 35 km from Khudat railway station. The name of the region is derived from the name of the tribe “Khisar”, which once lived in this area and later disappeared as a result of historical ethnogenesis. Now in this region mainly live representatives of the Lezgin nation.\n\nThe landscape of this area is marked by an alternation of mountains and valleys covered with forests. Broad-leaved trees-hornbeam, oak, and birch trees are more common here. Asgaril, sumakh, Hawthorn, dog-rose, wild fruit trees, wild grapes, various kinds of medicinal plants grow in Tugay forests of the river deposits. Beech forest called “ALISTAN BABA forest” here (Area of 7 hectares) is protected by the state. The fauna of the Gusar region is also rich. Here live wolves, bears, Boars, mountain goats, eagles, owls, and other birds and animals. In order to preserve hunting and hunting industrial species of fauna and restore their prime number, “Gusar” Reserve was established (an area of 15 thousand hectares).\n\nThere are beautiful waterfalls in mountain gorges. The most popular of them are the waterfalls of Laza and Shahnabaz, which attract tourists and lovers of the wild nature of the Caucasus. The mountains and peaks of the Gusar region attract climbers. In recent years, local waterfalls have become a place for athletes who like to climb the icy mountains in winter. You can walk from Laza village to Khinalig village of Guba district. This route is preferred by lovers of pedestrian tourism.\n\nThose who walk along the ecological tourism route from Gusar to Laza waterfall can camp in Anik village. The ruins of the fortress walls of the 13th century and the ancient mosque building are in good condition near this village. And near the village of Laza you can stay at the rest base” SUVAR”.\n\nThe length of the route from Gusar to the village of SUDUG is 75 km. On the slopes of the Shah mountain, you can see the mausoleum of Sheikh JUNEYDAN (16th century), the grandfather of the founder of the Safavid state of Azerbaijan Shah ISMAIL Khatai, in the village of Hazra.\n\nLike all Azerbaijani lands, one can see evidence of the ancient culture and way of life of this person in Gusar. The remains of ancient mausoleums, mosques, ancient human settlements, and fortresses have been preserved in Hazra, Hil, Balagusar, Anik, Yasab, Kohna Khudat, Gunduz gala villages.\n\nThe administrative center of Gusar district is located 183 km from Baku.

Flat-woven SUMAKH carpets are more popular both at home and in a shop in the city center. The biggest carpet bench in the Republic has been installed in this workshop. Up to 10 Carpet Makers can work on this machine at the same time.\n\nGusar district attracts tourists visiting Azerbaijan not only as a functional ski tourism complex, but also the natural wonders, culture, and traditions of the people living here are very interesting. The Pearl of all tourism industry of Azerbaijan, the complex of winter and spring sports facilities “Shahdag” is located at 2544 m above sea level, on the mountain slopes. The existing hotels here are located at an altitude of 1640 meters: “Pik Palace Shahdag”, “Park Chalet, Shahdag”, “Zirve Hotel Shahdag”, and “Shahdag Hotel & Spa”, but this is not the end for these places.

Near the complex, there are beautiful waterfalls — 2000 m high — Laza and Shahnabat twin waterfalls. Local waterfalls have one characteristic feature — it is very-very convenient to hold winter competitions here because they do not freeze in winter.\n\nNORTH-WEST ROUTE: BAKU — GOBUSTAN — SHAMAKHI — ISMAYILLI — GABALA — OGUZ — SHEKI — GAKH — ZAGATALA-BALAKAN\n\nGobustan district is one of the administrative districts of the historical province of our country called Shirvan. In the 8th-16th centuries in the territory of Shirvan, there was one of the most important state institutions of Azerbaijan — the state of Shirvanshahs, located in the capital city of Shamakhi. It was this state that existed for the longest time in the history of the Middle Ages.\n\nPresent Gobustan district is located to the east of Shamakhi, 101 km away from Baku.

As a rule, the name of the surname, which he adopted after becoming a famous person, is reflected in the name of his place of birth).\n\nShamakhyastrophysical Observatory named after Nasreddin Tusi (SAO) located near PIRGULU settlement is 1400 meters above the sea surface. One of the largest telescopes in the former USSR was installed here. One of the first Presidents of the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences, academician Yusif Mammadaliyev, who laid the foundation of petrochemistry in Azerbaijan, once did a lot to organize this Observatory. A statue of Y.Mammadaliyev has been erected here at the initiative of scientists working now in the territory of Shao as a sign of gratitude. Baku schoolchildren are always looking forward to going on an excursion to the Tusi balloon and seeing a huge telescope there. Residents of Baku, who do not usually snow in winter, are more eager to come here: because the snow in Pirgulu stays on the ground for a long time, so when you come here you can play snowballs.

One of several small states formed in the VIII century after the weakening of the Abbasids dynasty was Shirvanshahs state. This city has a glorious but tragic fate-it has been destroyed many times. These destructions were connected not only with the raids of the invaders but also with earthquakes because this place is a high seismic area. In 1191, when Gizil Arslan from the Atabey ELDAGEZ dynasty seized this city and devastated it, Shirvanshah I Akhsitan temporarily moved its capital to Baku. In 1501, Shah Ismail Safavi occupied both Shamakhi and Baku. After 37 years, the existence of the state of Shirvanshahs was terminated and Tahmasib Safavi created the state of the Safavids. In later periods Shamakhi was repeatedly destroyed in wars between the Safavids and Ottoman Turks. At such times, along with the death of people, architectural monuments and books were also destroyed…\n\nHowever, the people of Shamakhy have always found strength in themselves and restored the city and arranged their livelihoods. Alexander Duma, who had traveled to Azerbaijan in due time, wrote about Shamakhi that residents of this city never know whether they will survive tomorrow. At present, many ancient monuments are preserved around Shamakhi.\n\nShamakhi is located in the Juma Mosque, the oldest mosque not only in Azerbaijan but also in the entire South Caucasus. It was built 743 years. In 2013, a major reconstruction of the Juma Mosque was carried out. In addition, old cells were restored around the mosque.

Therefore, this tower is called Fitdag Tower.\n\nJavanshir (VII century), one of the rulers of Caucasian Albania, according to legend, lived in a fortress near TALISTAN village on the top of another mountain on the Left Bank of GIRDIMAN River. GIRKHOTAG Tower, HARAM Tower, Khiraki defense wall, and Juma Mosque were also preserved in Sulut village.\n\nThe administrative center of Ismayilli district is ISMAYILLI city. The distance from Baku is 185 km. Ismayilli is also one of the winemaking centers of Azerbaijan, and all opportunities are created here for one direction of tourism-wine.
