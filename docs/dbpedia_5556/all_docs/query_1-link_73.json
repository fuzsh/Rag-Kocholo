        "text": "The Milli Mejlis is the parlimentary body of Azerbaijan. The name \"Milli Mejlis\" is the Azerbaijani translation of \"national assembly.\" The purpose of the body is to propose and debate legislation, and keep the President of Azerbaijan in check.\n\nDeputies\n\nThe Azerbaijani Constitution, especially Section V is pretty specific about how the Milli Mejlis is to be arranged. It has 125 available seats, no more, no less (These seats do not all have to be filled, more on that in a minute) Members of the Milli Mejlis, officially known as \"deputies,\" serve for 5 year terms. They are elected on the first sunday of November, with the entire body up for re-election at the same time. Not just anyone can be elected a deputy; you have to meet the following criteria:\n\nYou are over the age of 24.\n\nYou are a citizen of Azerbaijan\n\nNone of the following apply to you:\n\nYou have dual citizenship\n\nYou \"are in State service in other countries\"\n\nYou work in the Executive or Judicial bodies\n\nYou are \"engaged in a different paid activity with the exception of scientific, creative and teaching work\"\n\nYou are a \"minister of religion\"\n\nYou are someone \"whose inactivity has been confirmed by the court\"\n\nYou are in prison (\"Person who serves their sentence in places of confinement\")\n\nDeputies are immune from legal prosecution of any sort, except if they are caught red-handed in a crime. They cannot be searched, detained, punished, or examined in any way, for as long as they are in office. Deputies cannot be made to answerable for their votes in the Milli Mejlis, nor any ideas they express in the Assembly.\n\nElectoral districts\n\nFor the purpose of elections to the Milli Mejlis, Azerbaijan is divided into 100 single-seat districts and one nation-wide district. Of the 125 available seats, 25 are allotted proportionally from the nation-wide district. The remaining 100 seats are distributed in a curious manner. Each of the 100 districts elects one person to the parliament. The would-be deputies have to win a majority in not one, but two district-wide elections. And, unless 50% of the eligible voters actually participate, the whole thing is called off and that district's seat is left vacant. All Azerbaijani citizens over 21 may vote in elections to the Milli Mejlis.\n\nSessions of the Milli Mejlis\n\nThe sessions of the assembly are defined in the Constitution. There are two yearly meetings of the parliament, from 1 February until 31 May, and then from 30 September to 30 December. The body is convened only if 83 members (2/3rds of the assembly) are successfully elected. If fewer than 83 seats are filled, then the Constitutional Court simply does not convene the Milli Mejlis. The constitution does not say what will happen in these cases. It is likely, though, that a new round of elections would be held, with a intense get-out-the-vote effort in those districts that slacked off the first time around.\n\nPowers of the Milli Mejlis\n\nThe constitution gives the Milli Mejlis the power to create laws governing the following items, as quoted from Section V, Article 94:\n\nUse of human and civil rights and freedoms. State guarantee of these rights and freedoms;\n\nThe Azerbaijan Republic Presidential elections;\n\nElections to the Milli Mejlis of the Azerbaijan Republic and the status of members of the Milli Mejlis of the Azerbaijan Republic\n\nReferendum;\n\nCourt system and the status of judges; attorney-ship; bar and notary business;\n\nLegal proceedings, implementation of court's decisions;\n\nMunicipal elections and status of municipalities;\n\nEmergency situation regime; martial law regime;\n\nState awards;\n\nThe status of physical and juridical Persons;\n\nObjects of Civil Law;\n\nTransactions; civil law Agreements, representations and inheritance;\n\nRight of ownership, including legal regime of State, private and municipal property, right of intellectual property; other property rights; obligation right;\n\nFamily relations including trusteeship and guardianship.\n\nFoundations of finance activity, taxes, duties and payments;\n\nLabor relations and social security;\n\nDetermination of crimes and law violations; imposing answerability for their commitment;\n\nDefense and military service;\n\nState service;\n\nFoundations of security;\n\nTerritorial set up; regime of State borders;\n\nRatification and denunciation of international agreements;\n\nCommunications and transport;\n\nStatistics, metrology and standards;\n\nCustoms;\n\nCommerce and transaction;\n\nBanking, accounting, insurance;\n\nItems 2, 3, and 4 must be approved by a 2/3rds majority, with the remainder of the points needing only a simple majority.\n\nThe parliament is also authorized to deal with these situations, should they arise:\n\nOrganization of work of the Parliament Milli Majlis of the Azerbaijan Republic;\n\nBased on recommendation by the President of the Azerbaijan Republic establishment of diplomatic representations of the Azerbaijan Republic;\n\nAdministrative-territorial division;\n\nRatification and denunciation of international agreements;\n\nBased on recommendation by the President of the Azerbaijan Republic approval of state budget of the Azerbaijan Republic and control over its execution;\n\nAmnesty;\n\nBased on recommendation by the President of the Azerbaijan Republic approval of military doctrine of the Azerbaijan Republic;\n\nIn cases specified in the present Constitution approval of decrees of the President of the Azerbaijan Republic;\n\nBased on recommendation by the President of the Azerbaijan Republic giving consent for appointment of Prime-minister of the Azerbaijan Republic;\n\nBased on recommendation by the President of the Azerbaijan Republic appointment of judges of Constitutional Court of the Azerbaijan Republic, Supreme Court of the Azerbaijan Republic and Economic Court of the Azerbaijan Republic;\n\nBased on recommendation by the President of the Azerbaijan Republic giving consent for appointment and dismissal of General Procurator of the Azerbaijan Republic;\n\nDismissal of the President of the Azerbaijan Republic by way of impeachment based on recommendation of Constitutional Court of the Azerbaijan Republic;\n\nBased on recommendation by the President of the Azerbaijan Republic dismissal of judges;\n\nTaking decision regarding a vote of confidence in the Cabinet of Ministers of the Azerbaijan Republic;\n\nBased on recommendation by the President of the Azerbaijan Republic appointment and dismissal of members of Administration Board of National Bank of the Azerbaijan Republic;\n\nBased on recommendation by the President of the Azerbaijan Republic giving consent for enlistment of Military Forces of the Azerbaijan Republic to operations other than their normal duties;\n\nBased on request of the President of the Azerbaijan Republic giving consent for announcement of war and conclusion of peace treaty;\n\nAnnouncement of referendum;\n\nEstablishment of an Auditor Chamber.\n\nItems 1-5 must be approved by a simple majority, 63 votes; the other items 6-19 are to be approved in a similar fashion unless some other law says otherwise.\n\nThe Chairman\n\nThe Milli Mejlis is led by a Chairman. The Chairman of the National Assembly is elected from the ranks of the parliament on the first day that the group is assembled. Any elected member may be a candidate for the chairmanship, a 5-year position that is filled by a simple majority election. If there is a tie in this first round of elections, a run off is held between the tying candidates. The chairman is the second-highest ranking government official in Azerbaijan, behind only the President of Azerbaijan. Should the president be removed from office in any way, the chairman is to assume the presidency. The chairman's duties and powers include the following:\n\nConvenes sessions of the Milli Mejlis.\n\nRefers texts to a committee for study.\n\nCan open, adjourn and close sittings.\n\nEnsures respect for provisions of the Constitution and Standing Orders.\n\nMakes announcements concerning the Assembly.\n\nTakes disciplinary measures in the event of disturbance, and lifts such measures.\n\nEstablishes the list of speakers, gives and withdraws permission to speak.\n\nEstablishes the order in which amendments are taken up and selects which amendments are to be debated.\n\nCalls for a vote.\n\nChecks the quorum.\n\nAuthenticates the texts adopted and the records of debates.\n\nHas discretionary power to give the floor outside the agenda and thus organizes impromptu debates.\n\nIs responsible for establishing the budget.\n\nRecruits, assigns and promotes key officials only.\n\nAppoints the Secretary General.\n\nIs responsible for relations with foreign Parliaments.\n\nIs responsible for safety, and in this capacity, can call the police in the event of disturbance in the Chamber.\n\nTakes the floor in legislative debates.\n\nProvides guidelines for the interpretation or completion of the text under discussion.\n\nTakes part in voting.\n\nProposes bills or amendments.\n\nIntervenes in the parliamentary oversight procedure.\n\nShould the chairman be absent from the parliamentary session, the First Deputy Chairman shall temporarily assume the office and powers of the chairman.
