        "text": "THE SECRETS OF THE SOVIET EMPIRE THE SUMGAYIT PROVOCATION Today ethnic separatism is considered a serious threat to all progressive mankind. The aggressive Armenian separatism is certainly amongst its dangerous manifestations. This anti-human phenomenon openly instilling a sense of hatred towards everything Turkic is based on the territorial claims against neighbouring nations and achievement of the notorious idea of «The Great Armenia» via annexations, genocide, acts of terror, mass deportations and war, by pursuit of an aggressive policy. Pursuing these goals, Armenian nationalism operates on the principle «whatever it takes…» descending to the falsification of history and appropriation of other nations’ material and cultural resources.\n\nThis paper delves into the true causes of the collapse of the Soviet Union, which completely surprised virtually all geopolitical pundits and analysts of the day. The paper then approaches what understanding these causes and their consequences can mean for the present and future of geopolitics.\n\nIt was the biggest purge, and the last, in post-Stalin Russia. The “Cotton Affair” was a tale of corruption and frustrated power that preoccupied the dying Soviet Union and presaged its end."
