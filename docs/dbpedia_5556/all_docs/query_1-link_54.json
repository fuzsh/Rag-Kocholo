Its oil wealth lay untended, but its people, though poor, enjoyed high levels of literacy and education. They exhibited an entrepreneurial impulse in the sale of goods in local markets and even in the Soviet-era black market which supplied flowers and fruit to Russia. An anticommunist popular front movement had emerged and gained popularity since 1988. Azerbaijan faced a secessionist movement in the Armenianpopulated region of Nagorno-Karabagh, which was supported by neighboring Armenia. The collapse of the Soviet Union and Soviet military contributed to the spread of weapons throughout the Caucasus, making the conflict even more lethal. Yet the anticommunist leaders managed to hold a presidential election in 1992 and bring the Popular Front to power. Its leadership lasted one year, but then fell to a coup, followed by the return of a former communist party boss. As Azerbaijan commemorates the twenty-fifth anniversary of its independence, the Karabagh conflict remains unresolved. Economic development surged to amazing levels, and corruption along with it. The political system became authoritarian under the rule of one family. Opposition groups, even those that had been strong, have been marginalized, co-opted, or crushed, and the civil society that developed in the 1990s and early 2000s has been suppressed. Youth movements, a “next-generation” opposition, came under attack and their leadership quashed. Yet these groups persist, and express their criticisms and their vision for the future on social media. xiii\n\nPreface\n\nMany post-Soviet states have sunk into authoritarianism. Despite some similarities, often resulting from shared Soviet legacies, each had a distinctive trajectory. Why did Azerbaijan follow its particular path seemingly toward and then away from democratization? How did the war, the economy, and the choices made by politically active individuals shape this outcome? And what lies ahead for this energy-rich country on the Caspian Sea, which borders Russia, Iran, Turkey, Georgia, and Armenia (with which it remains at war)? What are the implications of Azerbaijan’s choices for US interests in this strategically sensitive region? Can the United States have meaningful impact on events there, especially in protecting human rights and fostering democracy, and if so, by what means? On the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Soviet Union’s collapse, the time seemed right for a retrospective that could create a foundation for analysis and forecasting for the coming years. Each chapter examines a key area: geopolitical imperatives, the Karabagh war; electoral politics and the role of political opposition; the socioeconomic impact of oil wealth, foreign investment, and corruption; civil society, dissent, and repression; and the possibilities of a new role for political Islamism. I analyze these factors within Azerbaijan’s historical-cultural context, and end with a prognosis for Azerbaijan and considerations for US policy for the coming five to ten years.\n\nxiv\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI am deeply grateful to the many individuals and institutions who, over the past twenty-five years, have made this book possible.

In the case of personal names that are less familiar in English, I have used Azerbaijani Latin alphabet spelling, hence Ilqar and Tofiq rather than Ilgar or Tofik. Place names are given according to accepted English spelling conventions (Baku, not Baki), or follow Azerbaijani and not Russian spelling (Nakhjivan, rather than Nakhichevan). In the endnotes, Russian is transliterated according to the Library of Congress system. Azerbaijani (from all alphabets) is spelled according to the post-1991 Latin alphabet, which has several characters not found in English, including ԥ, ı, ö, ü, ç, and ş. In Azerbaijan, individuals are often known or called by their first names partly because the use of family names became universal only in the Soviet period and some family names are very common (e.g., Aliyev, Huseinov, Mammedov). Therefore, the use of a person’s first name in this book follows common Azerbaijani practice and is not necessarily a sign of familiarity or affection. The polite form of address for women is xanim (khanim) following the first name (e.g., Leyla xanim). For men, two variations are in use: from the Soviet period is muellim, meaning “teacher,” which replaced the prerevolutionary bey, a title for a landowner and used in Turkey. Since independence, bey has been used (i.e., Yusif Muellim or Yusif Bey), but is often associated with pro-Turkish views.\n\nxvii\n\nAcronyms and Abbreviations\n\nADR\n\nAzerbaijan Democratic Republic (1918–20)\n\nAI\n\nAmnesty International\n\nAMIP\n\nAzerbaijan Milli İstiqlal Partiyası (National Independence Party)\n\nAXCP\n\nAzԥrbaycan Xalq Cebhesinin Partiyası (Azerbaijan Popular Front Party)\n\nBTC\n\nBaku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan oil export pipeline\n\nCIS\n\nCommonwealth of Independent States\n\nCMB\n\nCaucasus Muslim Board\n\nCoE\n\nCouncil of Europe\n\nCSCE\n\nCommission for Security and Cooperation in Europe (see also OSCE)\n\nECHR\n\nEuropean Court of Human Rights\n\nEEU\n\nEurasian Economic Union xix\n\nAcronyms and Abbreviations\n\nEITI\n\nExtractive Industries Transparency Initiative\n\nESI\n\nEuropean Security Initiative\n\nEU\n\nEuropean Union\n\nHRW\n\nHuman Rights Watch\n\nIMF\n\nInternational Monetary Fund\n\nNATO\n\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization\n\nNED\n\nNational Endowment for Democracy\n\nNGO\n\nnongovernmental organization\n\nNKAR\n\nNagorno-Karabagh Autonomous Region (Soviet)\n\nODIHR\n\nOffice for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights\n\nOSCE\n\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n\nPACE\n\nParliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe\n\nRFE/RL\n\nRadio Free Europe / Radio Liberty\n\nSCO\n\nShanghai Cooperation Organisation\n\nSCWRO\n\nState Committee on Work with Religious Organizations\n\nSOCAR\n\nState Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic\n\nSOFAZ\n\nState Oil Fund of Azerbaijan\n\nWTO\n\nWorld Trade Organization\n\nYAP\n\nYeni Azerbaijan Partiyası (New Azerbaijan Party)\n\nxx\n\nFrustrated Democracy in Post-Soviet Azerbaijan\n\nMap I.1.

He declares that he could tolerate them if he knew that he was the victim of a vengeful god, against whom he is powerless. But he knows that this is not the case. The tragedies of his life, he concludes, were happenstance. In frustration, he asks, “How arrives it joy lies slain, / And why unblooms the best hope ever sown?” This book similarly begins with Azerbaijan’s “best hopes” for independence and democratic society, and explores their “unblooming.” In contrast to Hardy’s poem, this book is not about chance, but about choice. It examines contextual circumstances—geography, history, culture, institutional constraints—but it focuses on decisions and the people who made them during crucial moments in the trajectory of Azerbaijan’s post-Soviet independence. Azerbaijan’s culture, history, and politics are enormously complex and subtle. Analysis is difficult; forecasting perilous. A resource-rich country, Azerbaijan is wedged between Russia and Iran. The region has been ruled by both, sometimes brutally, sometimes loosely. The present-day Republic of Azerbaijan bears the marks of its former overlords in politics, economy, society, and culture. Until the twentieth century, Azerbaijan’s models of governance were entirely of despotic rule. Long known for its oil deposits, the county’s modern production began outside the Caspian port city of Baku in the 1870s, drawing foreign investors and local wealth. The result was the Westernization of the built environment; the population; and many of its economic, cultural, political, and social components. Its culture was Islamic, mostly Shi’ite with a mix of Iranian and Turkic elements, though the latter 1\n\nIntroduction\n\naspects came to dominate Azerbaijan by the early twentieth century. A secular, Turkic-speaking Azerbaijani elite led reforms in education and social practices, and also forged the underlying ethnoreligious identity in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which gradually reoriented the populace away from Iran and toward modernizers in Turkey. This same elite led the republic that emerged from World War I with a Constitution and a parliament. A weak coalition government fell to Bolshevik pressure and the Red Army in 1920. Thus began Azerbaijan’s painful life as a Soviet socialist republic. In the Gorbachev era of the late 1980s, a new generation of intellectuals studied and publicly discussed their forebears of the first republic. The origins of that exploration, initially timid and sporadic, went back to the Brezhnev era of the 1960s and 1970s, when writers and historians began to explore such forbidden topics. These scholars and writers moved from research to politics under the pressure of the armed conflict, as their predecessors had done during World War I. Apart from the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, the process that most set the stage for post-Soviet political life in Azerbaijan was the war with neighboring Armenia over the territory of Mountainous Karabagh—commonly known with the Russian prefix for “mountainous,” Nagorno-Karabagh. The war began in the winter of 1987–88 and galvanized Azerbaijani national consciousness. It is no exaggeration to say that the war itself, the assistance that both Russia and Iran gave to Armenia, and Azerbaijan’s own poor showing on the battlefield affected every aspect of life in Azerbaijan. In this context, opposition politics was born. Scholars and the artistic community organized an anticommunist Popular Front, which created mass politics in the Soviet republic in 1988 and introduced an anticommunist, then postcommunist language of discourse. The Popular Front spawned new opposition parties, and was elected to power a mere four years later in the country’s first democratic elections in June 1992. Its fall was equally abrupt, before it could celebrate its first anniversary in government. Since then, the democratic opposition parties increasingly have been marginalized in the face of the overwhelming power of the ruling Aliyev family and its inner circle. With Azerbaijan’s independence, oilmen flooded into Baku, outpacing the diplomats. The increasing presence of foreigners was perhaps the most visible indicator to the population that independence was real. The influx of money, mainly to the energy sector and supporting infrastructure, was transformative, and from the mid-1990s to the present it paid for public works and enriched the segment of the population linked to oil and to the foreign community. 2\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt was also used to influence the policies of foreign states and international organizations that dealt with Azerbaijan. Many people were left in poverty. Old skills became obsolete; inflation and currency reforms trivialized Sovietera pensions and savings. Corruption blossomed and grew in the twenty-first century to astonishing proportions, driving down Azerbaijan’s ratings in a number of corruption and democratic governance indices, such as those of Transparency International. With the growth of central power and constraints on open debate, dissent grew. The regime of Ilham Aliyev (2003–present) did not tolerate criticism or even the free exchange of ideas. Prodemocracy parties and protesters were suppressed with increasing severity, and in 2010 all genuine opposition parties lost representation in the Milli Majlis (National Assembly) in yet another in a series of fixed elections. Dissenters were fined or jailed; investigative journalists were increasingly pressured, beaten, or imprisoned. The fine for unauthorized demonstrations increased tenfold. A new generation of activists was nurtured by established opposition parties but found its own voice through social media and informal organizations. Fearful of youth activism like that found in the color revolutions of the 2000s and the 2011 Arab Spring, the Aliyev regime lured some young women and men into state jobs and meted out harsh repression against the critics of the generation of twenty-somethings. By the end of the summer of 2014, nearly all prominent human rights and civil society activists were in jail, as President Aliyev asserted that Azerbaijan was a democracy and critics of the regime were traitors. Islam, suppressed under Soviet rule, appealed to many Azerbaijanis who were seeking a new identity in the post-Soviet world. The Soviet-era version of Azerbaijan’s history had been discredited, and people had ceased to believe the old regime’s claim to have promoted “communist morality.” For many, interest in Islam was a matter of historic identity or piety. For others, it was a moral compass or even a political guide. The secular Aliyev regime, which fears Islam for its potential political uses, has claimed to find radical Sunni “Salafi” or “Wahhabi” groups in the country, especially along the Russian border with Dagestan. Believers have been arrested; alleged Islamist groups have been quashed. The Juma mosque in Baku, led by an Iran-trained Shi’ite mullah with human rights credentials, was closed down in 2004, but the mullah was able to start a successful organization with an Internet presence and young followers. Arrests and labels of extremism have kept Islam in the shadows, making its power hard to assess. The emergence of the Islamic State in 2014 has raised the specter of extremism among the Sunni minority in Azerbaijan. 3\n\nIntroduction\n\nBeyond the examination of Azerbaijan’s experience, this analysis addresses broader themes that political leaders and diplomats repeatedly have argued. Western, particularly US, policy in Azerbaijan is built on a tripod of energy, security, and democratization. Cooperation in the first two areas has been positive, but the worsening record in the third has become a source of growing tension. Baku has responded to Western criticism by framing its own policies as the product of a stark choice: it must guard its own security, stability, and independence by the means it chooses, or else fall to enemies who can manipulate its “open society.” As a Muslim majority society with a secular state, Azerbaijan may be vulnerable to Islamist appeals, especially as the regime has reduced the space for the politically moderate opposition. These are strategic and philosophical, even moral questions that touch on rule by the consent of the governed, the rule of law, and human rights. The US response raises the same concerns with its tripod. These and related issues are implicit in each chapter and are addressed explicitly in the final one, “What’s Next”? This book is possible because of the training I received first as a master’s degree student in international relations and then as a doctoral candidate in history at the University of Chicago from 1975 to 1983, when I completed my PhD. At Chicago, I honed the Russian language skills I had developed in high school and as an undergraduate at the University of Illinois (ChampaignUrbana), and began learning modern Turkish and Azerbaijani. As a doctoral student, I first went to Baku in 1980–81, where I developed my language skills to study pre–World War I Azerbaijani culture and politics, navigate the streets and bazaars of Baku, and learn the “ground truth” of Brezhnev-era Azerbaijan. I met colleagues who later became politically active in the Gorbachev era. As an historian, I write about the past, but as a researcher and observer, I live in the present. Through many subsequent research trips to Azerbaijan in 1984 and the post-Soviet decades, I watched the transformation of politics, social and economic life, and the city of Baku itself. I was privileged to watch my peers manage the new conditions and speak more openly to a foreign friend. Finally I was able to meet a younger generation of dynamic Azerbaijanis who knew more of the world but less of the Soviet (or pre-Soviet) past than the previous generation. The present work is grounded in my many unpublished presentations, briefings, and classes for and with nongovernmental organizations and US government groups since 1990. Drawing on my own experiences and research, I made use of the scholarly work of US, Azerbaijani, and European scholars; and reports from US, European, and Azerbaijani governments, international 4\n\nIntroduction\n\norganizations, nongovernmental organizations, and the press. I have spoken with Azerbaijani activists; local and Western journalists; and diplomats from the United States, Azerbaijan, other countries, and international organizations. I could not include every story, and surely participants in events will challenge some of my choices. I respect their views. In the process of writing each chapter, I explored topics and whole areas that were not on my initial “to do” list, but which I investigated because I wanted to give as full a picture as possible while maintaining a coherent narrative and reasonable length. This project was completed in 2014–15, thanks to the intellectual and financial support I received as a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. As we approach the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Soviet collapse, and given the economic and strategic significance of Azerbaijan, the time seemed ripe for a retrospective analysis not only of the road that Azerbaijan has traveled in over two decades but also of the choices and the human agency at work and the meaning of its pathway for Azerbaijan and US interests now and in the years to come.\n\n5\n\n1 A Starting Point: History and Geopolitics and What They Tell Us\n\nIf you have nothing to tell us but that one barbarian succeeds another on the banks of the Oxus, what benefit does the public derive from your history? —Voltaire, 17691\n\nVoltaire was right, of course. A simple catalog of facts, devoid of explanation and interpretation, is not beneficial or meaningful. It is not even good history. This book strives to be both good history and useful analysis in understanding Azerbaijan from the inside and from a Western policy perspective. The focus of this book is Azerbaijan’s post-Soviet path from a troubled but hopeful beginning of democracy-building to the reestablishment of authoritarianism behind a Western façade. Understanding how Azerbaijan’s path was shaped— by what events and human agency—and where the country may go in the coming decade is essential to informed policymaking. The following chapters examine selected facets of post-Soviet Azerbaijan’s experience to provide a meaningful context and critical foundation to lead a reader to that understanding. To create a frame of reference for the question of Azerbaijan’s postSoviet trajectory, this initial chapter will establish “snapshots” of the country, 6\n\nA Starting Point: History and Geopolitics and What They Tell Us\n\nfirst as a newly independent state in 1991–92 and then after nearly twenty-five years of independence in 2014–15. The dissolution of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991 gave reality to the declarations of independence by the individual Soviet Socialist Republics (SSRs) during that year. Western analysts, like the noncommunist factions inside each new state, so fully expected that the former Soviet republics would transition to democracy that programs and publications dedicated to describing the process included the word “transition” in their titles.2 A body of literature dubbed “transitology” tracked and analyzed the features of various postcommunist states. Though these publications were useful in identifying common challenges to “transition” and instances where political configurations of elites, resources, and public action met and turned at “contestation points,” they often suffered from the lack of in-depth knowledge of individual countries and cultures that made a difference in the hoped-for transitions to democracy. They were short on “ground truth.” Most of the literature anticipated the existence of some factors that would facilitate the envisioned transition to democracy: a historical “legacy” that supported democracy, such as elite or societal consensus; some form of civil society; political competition and popular participation; institution-building efforts; and the development of a strong state that is separate from the ruling party. (This last factor stemmed from the consideration that weak states are associated with weak democratization.) These democratization factors relied upon the additional presupposed (and usually unstated) factors of peace, time, and a desire to democratize. By 2010, when democratization had foundered or failed in many postcommunist states, analysts added two more factors to the equation: the participation of the international system and, importantly for Azerbaijan, the role of domestic political leadership in the democratic transition.3 When looking at the effects of these new factors, analysts most often used the cases of Russia (for instance, the extent to which Russian leader Vladimir Putin quashed Russia’s democratic development) and Ukraine, but the example of authoritarian rulers could be applied to Azerbaijan as well. Western democracy-building programs, as external efforts, became more important in this analysis. The conclusions from these new evaluations seemed again to suggest that certain preconditions—namely, peace and prodemocracy leaders—had to exist before a formerly totalitarian state could transition successfully to a democratic one. Post-Soviet Azerbaijan lacked many of these conditions—significantly, peace. Azerbaijan’s particular traits of history and geography made it a poor fit for many of the post-Soviet democratization paradigms because Azerbaijan is on 7\n\nA Starting Point: History and Geopolitics and What They Tell Us\n\nthe frontier between Asia and Europe, which therefore bestows on it a unique cultural legacy. For centuries, the area that is now the Republic of Azerbaijan has been part of a wide Turco-Persian Islamic cultural belt, into which Russia intruded early in the nineteenth century. Until the late twentieth century, its political models were almost entirely of despotic rule. Native elites developed a modernization movement decades before the Soviet period , making it unique among the future “Muslim” SSRs.4 Present-day Azerbaijan is wedged between Iran and Russia, and it shows the effects of having been ruled for centuries by first one state and then the other, sometimes brutally, sometimes loosely. Today, the Republic of Azerbaijan must maintain a balance between these neighbors and others—Armenia, Georgia, and Turkey—even as its politics, society, economy, and culture bear the marks of its former overlords. Azerbaijan also has an alternative, if short-lived, democratic model with indigenous roots. In the 1870s, the beginning of a modern oil industry in Baku attracted foreigners—Russian entrepreneurs and workers, along with European investors, engineers, architects, and merchants. Foreigners brought the accoutrements of modernization, such as elevators and telephones. Cultural Westernization soon followed. Azerbaijani elites sought Western education for their sons, albeit cautiously at first, in Russia and Europe. By the start of the twentieth century, a second generation of secular reformers was sculpting a modern Islamic-Turkic culture with European elements. These reformers spearheaded education reform for boys and girls, campaigned against polygamy and the veiling of women, and supported a vibrant civil society with a surprisingly outspoken press. The intellectual elites who wrote poetry and opera were also contributors to the urban press, even as they earned a living as schoolteachers. Some of them ran for seats in the Baku City Council and later the Russian State Duma. These men and the few women among them forged a national identity that incorporated a reformed Islamic and ethnic Turkic consciousness. They gained a political education in the few legislative bodies that tsarist Russia created. This modern identity and the commitment to democracy were expressed in the arts and the founding of political parties such as the Müsavat (“Equality”) Party, which was founded in 1911 with a mixed Muslim and Turkic program. It became the dominant party in postwar political life.5 After the 1917 Bolshevik coup and World War I destroyed the Russian Empire, Azerbaijan’s nationally conscious elite formed a parliamentary republic, the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR), in May 1918. Building on their prewar reform program, the leaders drafted a Constitution that 8\n\nA Starting Point: History and Geopolitics and What They Tell Us\n\nguaranteed electoral rights and civil rights, including freedom of speech, and enfranchised women, the first Muslim society to do so. Their Turkic language supplanted Russian as the official language.6 Their national anthem, composed by the country’s most prominent composer and one of its major poets, blended folk and European themes. The tricolor flag in blue, green, and red represented the coexistence of Turkic national, Islamic, and socialist elements, the hallmark of politics in Baku with its industry and multinational population. The new republic’s political parties included an array of Russian, Armenian, and Azerbaijani national parties; socialist and nationalist parties; and Islamic, Jewish, and other smaller parties, including a Russian communist one. Each community had a newspaper, houses of worship, and schools. The ADR’s parliamentary system produced a series of coalition governments; the nascent communist movement worked against it. A weak coalition government fell to the combined forces of the Azerbaijani wing of the Bolshevik party and the Red Army in April 1920. Thus began Azerbaijan’s painful life as a Soviet Socialist Republic. The elite who had led the ADR fought to defend it. Many were killed, and others fled abroad to continue the war of ideas by publishing newspapers and anti-Bolshevik books, often in Istanbul and Paris. Still others remained in the country to try to retain the cultural and philosophical gains of their prewar movement. Most were purged in the ensuing years; their ideas were distorted, and they were vilified and condemned, to the extent that some of their names were obliterated from the historical record. Studying the prewar reformers and intellectuals and their ideas became “antiSoviet,” and therefore dangerous. Bolshevik conquest brought despotic rule back to Azerbaijan, but in a modern totalitarian incarnation that penetrated both the form and the content of national identity. The native Turkic language retained official status, though its alphabet was changed twice, from Arabic script to Latin in 1924 and then to Cyrillic in 1940. Each change made the literate population illiterate and cut off new readers from the literature and history of their own past. The substance of culture and the liberal national identity it bore was suppressed in favor of “socialist construction.”7 The authorities pressured schools to expand the teaching of Russian, which was the only language used for the study of technology and science, and required the use of Russian as the lingua franca. After the initial loss of life in the early 1920s, the Soviet regime carried out a nearly continuous purge of intellectuals and artists in the interwar period. In the Gorbachev era of the later 1980s, patterns of overt dissent became visible. They were attributed to glasnost, the new policy of “openness” and 9\n\nA Starting Point: History and Geopolitics and What They Tell Us\n\ntransparency in Soviet government and society, and their appearance was a result of that policy. The origins of this dissent—initially moderate, sporadic, and exclusively in Azerbaijani-language journals and literature—went back to the Brezhnev era in the previous decade, when writers and scholars had begun to examine topics that were forbidden by the Soviet regime. In the 1980s, historians as well as journalists wrote openly and widely about the democratic precedent of Azerbaijan’s first republic. Most of the historical pieces were short biographies of people who had been declared “bourgeois nationalists” or other “enemies,” and had been purged in the great waves of Stalinist terror in the 1930s or the lesser-known purges of non-Russian leaders in the late 1920s.8 The ADR and its ideals were articulated as models for the Popular Front when it was formed in 1988–89 and for the other parties that branched off from it, particularly the Yeni (“New”) Müsavat Party, named for the original Müsavat Party that had been denounced under Soviet rule.\n\nThe Path to the “Second Republic” The events that set the immediate political stage for the independent postSoviet Azerbaijan were, unsurprisingly, the disintegration of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991 and the war with neighboring Armenia over the territory of Mountainous Karabagh (Nagorno-Karabagh) from 1987 onward. Within that context, Baku’s intellectual elite in the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences and Baku State (then Azerbaijan State) University formed the Azerbaijan Popular Front, an organization that gave voice to public anger over the Karabagh issue and many other points of political and social contention. The Popular Front struggled against the communist party, and eventually came to power. The rocky path to post-Soviet independence determined the challenges that the country’s first leaders would face. The struggle over Mountainous Karabagh began in the winter of 1987– 88 and galvanized Azerbaijani national consciousness in a way that no other event had done in almost seventy years. Although the impact of this conflict will be discussed in greater detail in the next chapter, it is important to note here that the war itself, the paralysis of both Azerbaijan’s Soviet government and the Azerbaijan Communist Party (AzCP), the assistance that Russia and Iran provided to Armenia, and Azerbaijan’s poor showing on the battlefield all shaped the country’s political life and national consciousness in the years before and after the reestablishment of its independence. When the first Armenian 10\n\nA Starting Point: History and Geopolitics and What They Tell Us\n\ndemands to transfer control of the Nagorno-Karabagh Autonomous Region (NKAR) to Soviet Armenia were advanced in 1987–88, Azerbaijanis only gradually became aware of them. Outside academic circles, where scholars were familiar with conflicting historical claims to the land, most people were taken by surprise. They may have been aware that Armenians made up the majority of the population in the NKAR, but they always understood the land itself to be Azerbaijani. When the AzCP and the Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan SSR failed to reject the Armenian claims to the land, popular outrage was immediate. This public anger buoyed resistance to Azerbaijan’s passive party and state institutions, and eventually spilled out into public demonstrations. The Azerbaijan Popular Front become the organization that voiced the Azerbaijani public’s frustration with the weakness of its Soviet leaders, articulated the counternarrative that asserted Azerbaijan’s historical claims, and finally led the resistance to both Armenian demands and communist rule in Azerbaijan. The Popular Front was formed in secret meetings of academicians and literati during 1988–89. Some of its members were already known as dissidents, including the fifty-year-old Abulfez Aliyev, a historian who worked in the Academy of Sciences’ archives. He had formerly worked as a translator in Egypt and taught at Baku State University, then was jailed in the mid-1970s for anti-Soviet activity. He emerged as a leading personality in the Popular Front and was dubbed the “messenger” (elchi). His family name, a very common one, was later replaced with “Elchibey” (adding the honorific “bey” to the title). At the first congress of the Popular Front in 1989, Elchibey was elected the organization’s chairman. Among the other leaders were men and women in their mid-thirties, including Etibar Mamedov, Isa Gambar(ov), Leyla Yunus(ova), and Zardusht Alizade, all of whom later founded political parties. The first big step toward independence was the November 1988 demonstration in front of the main government building on Lenin Square.9 Tens of thousands of people, perhaps half a million at times, gathered in the square, which they began to call “Azadlıq Meydani” (Freedom Square) to hear speakers denounce Azerbaijan’s government and communist party for its weakness in the face of Armenian demands and more broadly for failing to protect Azerbaijan’s environment, monuments, and culture. Thousands camped on the square night and day for over two weeks before attrition and pressure from the police gradually led to their dispersal and the arrest of several leaders on December 3.10 But public anger had been mobilized and the Popular Front had established itself as an alternative to the existing authorities. 11\n\nA Starting Point: History and Geopolitics and What They Tell Us\n\nThe following summer, the Popular Front held its first congress. In its first official program, it called for full civil liberties and human rights for all citizens, equality for national minorities, return of collectivized land (from the early 1930s) to the peasantry, and the end to “barbaric” exploitation of natural resources. Finally, it demanded full “political, economic and cultural sovereignty for Azerbaijan within the USSR.”11 Although the program did not call for secession, its terms effectively called for the dismantling of the Soviet system. Early in the fall of 1989, thanks to pressure exerted through a railway strike, AzCP first secretary Abdurrahman Vezirov was forced to allow the Front to register as a legal organization and agree to a protocol with a host of other demands, including amnesty for the strikers and the end to special military controls in major Azerbaijani cities.12 The homegrown political movement that had been ridiculed by authorities in August had brought the AzCP leadership to its knees in October. By late 1989, the reach of the Popular Front had become sufficiently great to frighten authorities in Baku and in Moscow. As its adherents always said, the Front was a movement, not a party. It was beginning to fracture by this time, partly because a few members believed that it was too willing to accommodate the authorities. Those who insisted on independence were dubbed “radicals” by authorities and by some later scholars. Actual radicals formed the factions that carried out violent attacks on Armenians or took over local AzCP offices against the orders of the Baku Popular Front leadership, as was the case earlier in 1989 in the southern Caspian port city of Lenkoran.13 In December, Moscow ended seventeen months of direct rule over the NKAR, in theory returning it to Azerbaijani rule, but the Armenian SSR seized the moment to declare that it would annex the NKAR and quickly included the region in its 1990 state budget. Disorders broke out throughout Azerbaijan, including some led by rogue chapters of the Popular Front despite the leadership’s call to maintain order.14 The AzCP had no meaningful response and seemed paralyzed. Moscow soon moved against the Popular Front. On the weekend of January 13–14, 1990, “hooligan elements” tried to evict Armenians from their apartments in Baku. It was more than a few scattered attacks. Thomas de Waal wrote that “murderous anti-Armenian violence overwhelmed Baku.” Some Azerbaijanis, including police, were killed, but more than ninety Armenians were murdered and dozens more were wounded. The local forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs did not intervene, despite Popular Front pleas to do so. Their commander told Kazakh writer Almaz 12\n\nA Starting Point: History and Geopolitics and What They Tell Us\n\nEstekhov, who was then in Baku, that AzCP first secretary Abdurrahman Vezirov had ordered him not to intervene in ethnic conflicts.15 Only after the bloodshed ended on January 15 did Evgenii Primakov, a member of Gorbachev’s Presidential Council,16 arrive in Baku to announce that 11,000 Soviet troops were on the way to Azerbaijan “to restore order.” A state of emergency was declared in NKAR and along the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. But in Baku, Ganje, and several other cities, mayors were told to impose curfews. Unnamed sources in Moscow said that the situation in Azerbaijan had “reached the point of attempts at armed overthrow of Soviet power.”17 This was untrue. Protesters had few arms, and authorities knew the situation. A news blackout began that day,18 although some smaller newspapers (which were illegal in the first place) continued to publish for a day or two. Unarmed civilians put up barricades on roads into Baku. On January 17, demonstrations took place outside AzCP headquarters. On January 18, when Primakov spoke to crowds to say that Soviet troops were coming to Baku to protect the people, he was booed and shouted down— something that would have been unthinkable a few months earlier. Soviet defense minister Dmitry Yazov ordered Soviet troops to open fire if they met resistance on the roads into Baku. The commander of the Baku garrison told Popular Front leaders that if ordered, his troops would “not hesitate” to open fire on the civilian population.19 Throughout these days of unrest, various Popular Front leaders and those who were working alongside them, including Soviet Muslim leader Sheikh-ul-Islam Allahshukur Pashazade, tried to negotiate with Soviet military leaders to reverse the order for Soviet troops to enter Baku. Their efforts were in vain: on the night of January 19, the power station for Azerbaijan’s state radio and television station was blown up—possibly by Soviet special forces—cutting off all national broadcasts to the population. Thereafter, there was no way to announce the imposition of a curfew or a state of emergency, which would be put in place only after the Soviet troops arrived. On January 20, 1990, just after midnight, the first troops of the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs arrived at the barricades on the main road leading into Baku. They opened fire. Here and in other places around Baku that night and the next day, Soviet forces claimed that they were “returning fire,” but an independent investigation conducted in Moscow later in the year rebuffed this claim. The Shchit (Shield) Commission, whose report was released in the summer of 1990,20 rejected the claim that the troops were fired upon, because there was no evidence that those on the barricades had been armed. Elsewhere, 13\n\nA Starting Point: History and Geopolitics and What They Tell Us\n\nthere were no signs of bullet holes except where the troops had fired. As Soviet troops advanced, tanks and helicopters continued their assault on Baku, crushing cars and ambulances in their path. In the two-day crackdown, which later would be known as “Black January,” over 120 people were killed outright and more later died of their wounds. Many hundreds were wounded, but survived. Sheikh-ul-Islam Pashazade presided over the funerals of 180 people.21 Then and later, First Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev made public statements that the military action was necessary to fight “extremists” and “radicals” in Baku. He told the international media that Soviet troops were fighting “Islamic fundamentalists.” He had more than enough information to know that this was false. The Azerbaijanis who were wounded or killed, or were merely demonstrating, or were watching behind closed doors, were “extremists” in the same sense as the anticommunist demonstrators that had raised their voices in the Baltic republics and Ukraine. Azerbaijanis on the streets, apart from the leadership related to the Popular Front, were demanding an opportunity for political discourse to debate and discuss possible solutions to the NKAR conflict, but also for other problems that had emerged during the two years of upheaval that preceded the Black January tragedy. But open debate was a threat to the regime. The Soviet state had to control the narrative, and it did. The news blackout had quashed other sources of information, and the rest of the world had no contrary information. Many in the West believed the official Soviet story of “Islamic fundamentalists.” The Soviet regime was in fact defending itself. Soviet Major General Anatoly Kiriliuk of the Ministry of Internal Affairs said later that the Soviet military was sent to Baku “to crush the Azerbaijani drive for greater sovereignty in order to discourage similar movements elsewhere in the USSR.”22 The concrete target of the invasion was the Popular Front, which had given voice to this popular anger, organized it, and mobilized it. Just after midnight, the first wave of Soviet troops surrounded the Popular Front offices and fired upon the building, killing and wounding many of those inside before invading and ransacking it. Files were taken, telephones were removed, and Popular Front members were arrested. Similar events took place elsewhere in the country, from Ganje, the second-largest city, to the western region of Nakhjivan, and Soviet troops were sent there with similar outcomes to that in Baku. Leyla Yunusova called it “Red fascism.” Etibar Mamedov escaped to Moscow to give a news conference on the real events of Black January. He was immediately arrested and held incommunicado in Moscow’s Lefortovo Prison, infamous as a center of KGB detention and torture of political prisoners. 14\n\nA Starting Point: History and Geopolitics and What They Tell Us\n\nIn the following days, Azerbaijanis were defiant. Despite martial law, they massed for funeral processions of the victims. People burned their party cards in public fires; they denounced Soviet rule, the Soviet military, and Gorbachev. The tragedy of January 1990 was a turning point for the nation. Black January moved most Azerbaijanis from the position of demanding justice and autonomy within a Soviet framework to a new position—rejecting the Soviet Union itself and striving for independence. The Popular Front soon prepared a new party program, declaring that sovietization of Azerbaijan had been illegal, the result of the Red Army’s invasion in 1920. The creation of the NKAR. therefore, was also illegal, and it was to be dissolved, leaving the territory as an integral part of Azerbaijan. The program repeated its earlier support for the guarantee of full civil liberties as well as cultural rights for minorities, the creation of a market economy, and environmental protection, and now added the demand that state and judicial organs be freed from communist party influence. In spite of this anticommunist platform, it did not yet call for independence from the Soviet Union. With this platform, the Popular Front contended in October 1990 elections to the Azerbaijan Supreme Soviet. The elections were marked by restrictions on Popular Front candidates, including jailing of candidates and two murders. US observers noted instances of electoral fraud, including ballot stuffing and voter intimidation. Of 350 seats, 300 went outright to communist party candidates. After runoffs, only thirty deputies came from the Popular Front or the few noncommunist parties that had sprung up. These deputies formed a Democratic Bloc (Dembloc) in the Azerbaijan SSR’s legislature.23 The AzCP leadership had been changed immediately after Black January, and Baku native Ayaz Mutalibov had been installed as first secretary on January 23. He was Moscow’s man, and agreed to reforms only when forced. Slowly, the Popular Front regained its footing, but many members and followers were more strident in their demands for a share of power. In March 1991, the Popular Front could not stop Mutalibov from participating in a unionwide referendum on the proposed New Union Treaty that would renew Azerbaijan’s commitment to remain a part of the Soviet Union. But they did force him to prorogue the Supreme Soviet in favor of a new Milli Shura (National Council), a fifty-member body that allowed equal numbers of representatives from the government and the opposition forces that had formed the Dembloc. The Milli Shura sat in continuous session and for all intents and purposes took the place of the now-defunct Supreme Soviet.24 The Shura freely and publicly discussed politics and passed resolutions, providing the populace with more 15\n\nA Starting Point: History and Geopolitics and What They Tell Us\n\npolitical education than it had gained at any time since Soviet power was established in 1920. By the summer of 1991, Etibar Mamedov, freed from Lefortovo, broke with the Popular Front to establish the Azerbaijan National Independence Party (Azerbaijan Milli İstiqlal Partiyası; AMIP), whose platform called for independence.25 The August 1991 coup against Gorbachev, launched by a group of hardliners in the Soviet leadership that included Defense Minister Dmitry Yazov, happened while First Secretary Mutalibov was out of the country, in Tehran. Initially, he sided with the conservatives who had carried it out. When the coup failed and Gorbachev reappeared, Mutalibov backpedaled and, under Popular Front pressure, agreed to advocate for a declaration of independence. The declaration was adopted as a constitutional act on October 18, thereafter marked as Azerbaijan’s official day of independence. The decision had no enforceable reality, however, until the Soviet Union was officially dissolved by Gorbachev on December 26. Azerbaijan’s declaration was ratified by referendum on December 29. Within six months, Azerbaijan would be reconnected to the world, and the Popular Front leader would win the presidency.\n\nThe Reborn Republic of Azerbaijan Despite the obvious challenges—war with neighboring Armenia, thousands of internally displaced persons (IDPs), decades of underinvestment in infrastructure and industry, and a growing illicit economy—the unanticipated Soviet collapse created great hope in the possibility of constructing an independent, prosperous, and democratic Azerbaijan. These hopes were rooted in the memory of the first republic, the potential of the educated elite, international recognition of the new republic, and oil. With independence, Azerbaijan, especially Baku, faced an influx of foreigners for which neither its people nor its infrastructure was ready. The capital city was run-down and store shelves were often bare. The few decent hotels had housed refugees or functioned as morgues during Black January. The expectations of the arriving Westerners were a mystery to everyone in Azerbaijan, from the border guards who were suddenly forced to manage foreigners in Baku airport to the fruit sellers in the country’s bazaars. The Turks had been the first to recognize Azerbaijan’s independence in November 1991, and they were the first to arrive on the scene in the restored republic. Turkish diplomats opened an embassy, and Turkish businessmen 16\n\nA Starting Point: History and Geopolitics and What They Tell Us\n\nfollowed them, some opening small shops in dilapidated buildings while others made large-scale deals to revamp the long-neglected infrastructure. By the fall of 1992, Turkish companies were replacing the entire telephone system in Baku, a job that seemed to be on schedule despite the brief inconvenience of lost telephone service in one section of the city after another. The result was immediately noticeable. Investments and military training for Azerbaijan’s emerging army continued. For Turkey, the link to Turkic peoples of the Soviet Union had been a sensitive domestic matter which was quickly overcome in 1991–92. In Cold War Turkey, attention to the “outside Turks” in neighboring states, particularly within the Soviet Union, came to be associated with the political right wing, the main faction that continued to pay attention to them. Azerbaijan and Turkey had special places in each other’s histories because of their nineteenthcentury national identity formation and shared language. At the turn of the twentieth century, reformers in Baku and Istanbul pursued a modernization agenda captured by the slogan “Turkify, Islamize, and Modernize.” The underlying impulse was anti-imperial (hence the call to “Turkify” as contrast to being “Ottoman”) and to find a modus vivendi between European learning and a reformed Islam.26 Moreover, this reformist discourse was aided by the mutually intelligible spoken vernacular in both places (as well as Crimean Tatar), nearly a single language with regional variations that were often masked by the Arabic script.27 In the 1930s, language reform in both Soviet Azerbaijan (where many Russian words were mandated) and the Turkish Republic drew the languages apart. But exposure to their later forms in post-Soviet radio and television broadcasting led most speakers, especially the young, to bridge the gap quickly. The Turkish embrace was almost overwhelming, despite the longing for this bond to be reestablished. Azerbaijanis’ awareness of their first republic led them back to the time when they had had close relations with the Turks. The Turks even sent typewriters to help Azerbaijan return to the Latin alphabet, which both had adopted in the 1920s. But some Turks regarded Azerbaijani as a dialect of their own language, and did not conceal their sense that Azerbaijanis were “mispronouncing” it and using “archaic” words that had long been purged by the Turkish Language Association (Dil Kurumu), the official regulatory institution of the Turkish language. Because the history of Azerbaijan’s Turkic language, with its own reforms and history of alphabet change and shifting standardization, was not well documented, the Turkish claims of linguistic superiority could not be rebuffed—and 17\n\nA Starting Point: History and Geopolitics and What They Tell Us\n\nthey rankled. Azerbaijanis began to grumble that they had not thrown off one “elder brother,” using the old Soviet parlance, for another. Many Turks working in Azerbaijan took the hint and toned down their enthusiasm. For Iran, the creation of an independent republic in Turkic Azerbaijan was unwelcome. Iran itself has a multinational population, and the Azerbaijani Turks are by far the most numerous minority—perhaps twice as many Azerbaijani Turks lived in Iran as lived in the new republic to the north.28 For millennia, Iran’s history has been characterized by periodic expansion and contraction, often involving external forces on ethnic or religious minorities and the strength of the central government. At times, peoples on the periphery exercised greater autonomy, separated from the ruling regime, or were taken over by a neighbor. The Russian conquest of the Caucasus in the early nineteenth century was one such case when Iran lost substantial fertile and commercial land during a period of dynastic weakness. Iran’s cultural Persianization campaign of the twentieth century under the Pahlavi Dynasty denigrated Turkic culture as “nomadic,” in contrast to Persian high culture. The Turkic identity was denied, and Turkic speakers in Iranian Azerbaijan were dubbed “Turkicized Iranians.” In the 1963 census, only literacy in Persian was counted as literacy.29 The reign of the ayatollahs since 1979 generally sought to assert Islamic identity over national identity, but the Islamic regime retained many of the shah’s policies toward minorities. The hoped-for leveling of nationalities under Shi’ism, which most Azerbaijanis shared with Persians and the Iranian state, could not overcome “Persian chauvinism.”30 Leaders like Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Shariatmadari, who came from Azerbaijan, ultimately were unable to benefit Azerbaijan or its Turkic culture. In the end, neither Persianization nor the Islamic Revolution erased the Turkic consciousness of Iran’s Azerbaijani population. So the emergence of an independent state centered in Baku—a secular Turkic state on Iran’s northern border—implied a threat to Iran’s own territorial integrity. The use of Azerbaijani as the state language and opportunities for education and publishing in that language made this new state a potential pole of attraction for Iranian Azerbaijanis. Moreover, Azerbaijan was secular, but it was not the atheist society that the Soviet Union had meant to construct. Because Azerbaijani secularism had begun among native elites in Russian-held Azerbaijan in the nineteenth century, it could not be attributed to Soviet rule and in practice it appeared similar to Turkey’s secular society. Those secular values and practices were anathema to Iran’s Shi’ite hierarchy. For these reasons, as well as post-Soviet conflicts over resource rights under the Caspian Sea, Tehran 18\n\nA Starting Point: History and Geopolitics and What They Tell Us\n\napproached the new republic with caution, delaying recognition but promising future economic assistance.31 Within a year, Iranian mullahs would be arrested for bringing truckloads of Qurans into Azerbaijan. Western oil company representatives descended on Baku, often beating out the diplomats (apart from the eager Turks) who were charged with opening embassies in a country that many could not find on a map. Men in Pennzoil caps rode shuttle buses, an oddity in Baku, from one meeting to another. They commented, privately, that they should charge their counterparts for giving them classes in “Economics 101.” For the oil companies, the first months were taken up with assessment and exploration. Baku’s readily accessible oil, drawn from wells outside the city, had been significantly depleted by waste and fires in the early twentieth century. In World War II, Baku oil became the object of Hitler’s Caucasus offensive and was vital to the Soviet war effort. But after the war and reconstruction, investment was reduced again, and other sources of oil, including Grozny in Chechnya, became more important. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, foreign oil companies were working quietly in Baku,32 but on a small scale only. By the 1990s, the new country’s formerly thriving oil sector was left with an outdated and rusted infrastructure. Interest shifted to offshore reserves, but the Soviet Union had not had the technology to exploit them. With legions of Western specialists in Baku, Azerbaijanis had unreasonably high expectations about the time that it would take to explore, extract, and market that untapped oil and start pocketing the cash. Similarly unrealistic were expectations around the politics of oil. By summer, people in and out of government were saying that with US oil companies exploiting Azerbaijan’s oil, Azerbaijan’s independence was assured because the American government would never let “their” oil be threatened by a Russian takeover. Such thinking was a generally accurate indicator of the effects of seven decades of Soviet propaganda. At the same time, the war in Mountainous Karabagh continued to escalate. More fighters came from abroad; more weapons came into the region both from foreign sources and former Soviet soldiers who sold their weapons to all buyers.33 Armed groups were not only in and near the battlefield, but around Baku, as indicated by the occasional sound of distant gunfire.34 The massacre of nearly 500 Azerbaijanis, including women and children, outside the town of Khojaly on February 25–26, 1992, was the shocking event that led to the downfall of President Ayaz Mutalibov. (See chapter 3 for more on this chain of events.) He was blamed for failing to establish a national army, for he had argued that it was in Azerbaijan’s best interests to rely on 19\n\nA Starting Point: History and Geopolitics and What They Tell Us\n\nthe forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States—meaning the postSoviet Russian forces that were still stationed in Azerbaijan. On March 6, Mutalibov was forced to resign, but he handed the presidency to his corrupt sidekick, Yaqub Mamedov. About nine weeks later, Mamedov gave the presidency back to Mutalibov in a noisy session of the resuscitated full Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan, which had been renamed a “parliament” in the fall of 1991. The trigger was yet another battlefield loss in Karabagh. This time, the major mountaintop city of Shusha, a center of Azerbaijani culture, fell to Armenian forces, as did the Lachin corridor with its road linking the former NKAR to Armenia—which effectively united Mountainous Karabagh and Armenia. These losses were laid at Yaqub Mamedov’s doorstep. At a session of the “parliament” on May 14, without a quorum, Mutalibov returned to the acclaim of his supporters. He declared a state of emergency and canceled the forthcoming presidential elections, which had been set for June 7.35 The Popular Front refused to accept this turn of events. Abulfez Elchibey and his advisers argued the unconstitutionality of the Mamedov-Mutalibov maneuver. At the same time, the Popular Front’s own “watchdog,” Iskendar Hamidov, a career police colonel, marched on the parliament building with an armed force. Mutalibov fled the country and later turned up in Moscow, where he continues to reside more than twenty years after his ouster. Under popular pressure, the “parliament,” now with a quorum, elected the Popular Front’s Isa Gambar to be its speaker and therefore acting president. Gambar reinstated the upcoming presidential elections. This was not, as has been suggested, an attempt “to cloak”36 Popular Front actions, but rather was an indication of the Front’s genuine commitment to establish the most democratic system it could muster under the circumstances. With the June elections, during fighting in Karabagh, the Popular Front would come to power. On June 7, 1992, Abulfez Elchibey was elected president of the Republic of Azerbaijan with about 55 percent of the vote in the first free, multicandidate, and relatively fair elections in Azerbaijan since 1920.\n\nAzerbaijan Today: Two Decades of Independent Statehood After more than two decades as an independent state, Azerbaijan’s top priority is and must be to maintain its independence. No opposition party or group has suggested otherwise. In that sense, the hope has been fulfilled, and a change in government to any parties now on the scene would not affect 20\n\nA Starting Point: History and Geopolitics and What They Tell Us\n\nthe commitment to independent statehood. As any textbook on statehood will attest, sovereignty entails territorial integrity. Thus, the lingering conflict over Mountainous Karabagh is an existential threat to Azerbaijan’s statehood, in more ways than one. The country’s battlefield losses, consolidated in the 1994 cease-fire under President Heydar Aliyev, marked not only the de facto separation of the former NKAR from Azerbaijan but also the Armenian occupation of six adjacent regions of Azerbaijan, totaling about 14 percent of Azerbaijan’s territory. Negotiations toward a final resolution have been facilitated by the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which was created in 1992 to help manage a peaceful solution to the Mountainous Karabagh conflict, but have been stalled for over two decades. Both the government and opposition parties have used the same rhetoric of the need to retain Mountainous Karabagh within Azerbaijan on the basis of the internationally accepted principle of territorial integrity of states. Willingness to use force to end the stalemate has been suggested more frequently, as Azerbaijan’s military budget has increased with the rise of oil revenues in the past decade. The 2015 military budget was nearly $5 billion, and clashes along the line of contact between Azerbaijan and Mountainous Karabagh have spiked. Within the geopolitical context of the south Caucasus, the Karabagh problem should be considered together with other secessionist movements in the region and the aims of neighboring regional powers, especially Russia. Like the old NKAR, other autonomous regions (ARs) or republics (ASSRs) established for ethnic minorities were products of Soviet policy in the 1920s and 1930s. Officially, these autonomous regions and republics were part of a “nation-building” effort by the Soviet regime, and guaranteed various cultural rights for a republic’s minority populations, including native-language education, publishing, and other cultural activities. At the same time, especially in non-Russian Soviet republics, these ARs/ASSRs permitted the Soviet regime to manipulate the national feelings of the minorities against the majority nationality of their republic. Georgia, one of the republics that most consistently resisted Bolshevik conquest and communist rule, had no fewer than three such autonomous entities: the Ajar ASSR and the Abkhaz and South Ossetia ARs. In the post-Soviet era, armed unrest began in at least one of these areas each time Georgia moved closer to the West. The weapons came from Russia, as did air support. The patterns of separatists receiving Russian aid were evident in both Abkhazia (1992–93) and the 2008 invasion of Georgia by Russian forces, ostensibly to protect South Ossetia from Georgian aggression.37 After 2008, 21\n\nA Starting Point: History and Geopolitics and What They Tell Us\n\nbut especially after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in March 2014, Vladimir Putin voiced greater support for the separation of both Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia and moved to unite them to Russia. This projection of Russian power was not entirely grasped in Washington during the RussoGeorgian conflict in 2008 until it was repeated in Ukraine in 2014. Around the time of the Crimean annexation, Putin stepped up efforts to bring the presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia together to discuss the Mountainous Karabagh stalemate, even as Armenia extended its military agreement with Russia permitting Russian forces the use of Armenian bases until 2044. Russia is positioned to hold the Karabagh conflict in stalemate and shift its weight from one side to the other to get economic or political concessions from the parties. Armenia, for example, joined the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union in 2014, just after Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich was ousted from power for attempting to pursue the same path and pull away from closer ties with the European Union. Azerbaijan maintained neutrality between the Eurasian Economic Union and the EU, but in 2014–15 it increased its oil and gas sales to Russia and cooperated with Russia’s deployment of naval forces in the Caspian Sea. Azerbaijan and Armenia petitioned for observer status in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a Eurasian economic, political, and military organization dominated by Russia and China. It is in Russia’s interest to maintain the tension in Karabagh, but giving too much to one side is not, nor is a resumption of the fighting. Azerbaijan’s central government has stressed its need to maintain independence and stability against external and internal threats. This argument, used to justify arrests of domestic critics, has been articulated more often since Russian interference in Ukraine and the seizure of Crimea in March 2014. Azerbaijani analysts have said that Russia is the main threat to independence and resolution in Karabagh, even as Ilham Aliyev visited Moscow and described the two countries’ friendship. Also during 2013–14, the Aliyev regime copied Russia’s laws banning and restricting the freedom of operation of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and employed Russian rhetoric as Baku cracked down on civil society, calling Aliyev’s critics “agents” of foreign entities. Since late 2003, when Ilham Aliyev succeeded his father Heydar as president, pressure against critics in the opposition press and human rights activists has increased. During 2013–14, after the Council of Europe (CoE) rejected a 2013 report by its own delegation on political prisoners in Azerbaijan, Ilham himself used that vote in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) as proof that Azerbaijan “has no political prisoners.”38 The Aliyev regime used 22\n\nA Starting Point: History and Geopolitics and What They Tell Us\n\nthe defense of independence and stability argument as justification for a brutal crackdown on dissenters, human rights defenders, NGOs, and journalists. The list of jailed activists, mostly intellectuals of all ages and professions, is a “who’s who” of leading human rights defenders, journalists and bloggers, and NGO leaders. The language of regime spokespersons against the opposition is similar to that used in Josef Stalin’s purges in 1937: enemies had “sunk deep roots” or “made a nest” in assorted institutions.39 Although Azerbaijan’s 1995 Constitution specifies separation of powers, the government is centralized in a presidency that effectively dominates other branches of government. The constitutional amendments of 2016 will assure greater presidential power, including the right to dissolve the parliament.40 Since 1993, none of Azerbaijan’s elections has been judged “free and fair” by international observers such as the OSCE’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OSCE/ODIHR) and Western embassies, including that of the United States. The legislative body, the Milli Majlis, has been dominated by the ruling New Azerbaijan Party (Yeni Azerbaijan Partiyası, YAP) since its founder, Heydar Aliyev, returned to power in 1993. But until 2010, the major opposition parties—the Azerbaijan Popular Front Party (Azԥrbaycan Xalq Cebhesinin Partiyası, AXCP) and Yeni Müsavat—were allowed a dozen or more deputies in each tainted election. Since 2010, however, even the minor representation of this opposition has been eliminated. The nominal opposition parties and the “independent” deputies are in fact YAP supporters. The Milli Majlis therefore has become a perfectly compliant instrument of the regime, repeating its official priorities in its official language. In late May 2014, the legislature introduced amendments to the law on citizenship, defining reasons that would justify stripping an individual of her or his Azerbaijani citizenship. Among the new reasons for depriving an individual of citizenship is that “a citizen of the Azerbaijan Republic behaves [in a way that is] damaging to state security.”41 The wording of this provision opens the door to a wide interpretation of behavior that may lead to loss of citizenship—in apparent contradiction to Article 53 of the Azerbaijani Constitution, which prohibits the stripping of citizenship.42 The Azerbaijani government’s power is enabled by its great wealth from hydrocarbon resources, high-quality light crude oil and natural gas. Oil is its source of fame in the world and supports its independence and security. Postindependence exploration, extraction, and pipeline construction deals brought tens of millions of dollars and thousands of foreign businessmen into Baku in an “oil rush” reminiscent of the nineteenth-century oil boom that first Westernized the capital. The city has again been transformed from its Soviet23\n\nA Starting Point: History and Geopolitics and What They Tell Us\n\nera disrepair; by 2014, it was a showcase, with restored historic buildings, glass skyscrapers, upscale shops, and international businesses from Hilton to Maserati. Existing contracts and the promise of future natural gas—oil production has declined from its peak in 2010—link Azerbaijan not merely to its neighbors but to the global economy. Gas will go through a future pipeline across Turkey, the first portion of which runs parallel to the oil-carrying Baku– Tbilisi–Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline that was completed in 2005. European customers hope that gas through TANAP (Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline) and TAP (Trans-Adriatic Pipeline) will offset their reliance on Russian gas. In addition to being a source of great wealth, the oil industry has been a source of trouble for Azerbaijan—economically, socially, and politically. Overseas investors’ emphasis on the development of the energy sector drew resources and government attention away from the country’s languishing Soviet-era industries and much-needed agricultural modernization projects. Azerbaijan remains vulnerable to the so-called Dutch disease: an imbalance of investment in the energy sector while other industries, including the manufacture and production of consumer goods and agricultural products on which the population relies, are left to languish. Social support programs such as pensions remain low, leading to a wide gap between those who benefit from the energy sector and its supporting industries and services on the one hand and the lingering number of poor on the other.43 Moreover, oil money brought the value of corruption to new heights. Corruption makes products and services more expensive, and bottles up money in unproductive endeavors like luxury imports or gambling, rather than supporting industry or infrastructure. It damages the business climate.44 Even though oil money has flooded into Azerbaijan under the presidency of Ilham Aliyev, he has put only just enough money into politically sensitive work such as IDP relocation and economically necessary improvements such as road and bridge construction to stave off unrest among the majority. Initially, pensions, state salaries, and health care funding grew, but since about 2006 they have not kept pace with the increased costs of living. Corruption in ruling circles is a taboo subject for investigators, but a few investigative reporters have violated that taboo since 2010.45 These reports indicate stunning levels of theft, fraud, bribery, money laundering, and skimming from state coffers. Transparency International consistently rates Azerbaijan among the world’s most corrupt regimes: in 2014, it was placed in a seven-way tie for 126th place (of 174 countries) with Gambia, Honduras, Kazakhstan, Nepal, Pakistan, and Togo.46 24\n\nA Starting Point: History and Geopolitics and What They Tell Us\n\nAt the top of the political pyramid sits President Ilham Aliyev. Son of the previous president, Heydar Aliyev, Ilham came into office in 2003 at age forty-one. He inherited his father’s advisers, most of whom were Sovietera politicos who had survived the brief anticommunist period around independence and returned to power when Heydar became president in mid-1993. Ilham had a playboy image. He headed Azerbaijan’s National Olympic Committee and was a vice president of the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR). He had not been groomed for the presidency until late in his father’s life. In 2003, he became head of the ruling party YAP when his father fell ill, was then appointed as prime minister and became candidate for president. He was declared the winner of tainted elections (detailed in chapter 3) in the fall of 2003. As president, Ilham not only succeeded his father, who died in December 2003, but created a cult of personality around the deceased “National Leader” to legitimate his own succession. Huge posters around Baku show the son obediently listening as his father seems to advise him from beyond the grave. Reelected in 2008, Ilham retained most of his father’s advisers, most significantly the old Soviet “crocodiles”47 led by Ramiz Mehdiyev, the chief of the president’s staff. Before his third term began in 2013, made possible by a change in the Constitution in 2009, Ilham had begun to crack down on civil society to a degree that his father had not. Probably frightened by the color revolutions—especially Georgia’s Rose Revolution in 2003 and Ukraine’s Orange Revolution in 2004—and the 2011 Arab Spring, he went after bloggers and critics in their twenties and thirties. Laws against NGOs in 2012–14 (see chapters 3 and 5) provided a basis for prosecutions and arrests, even as the Azerbaijani government maintained that it was “a rule of law state.” As more and more human rights defenders and journalists went to jail, and reports of torture and deprivation of medical care increased, government spokesmen stressed Azerbaijan’s business climate, its strategic partnership with the United States in the war on terror, and its role in European energy security. The uptick in repression of 2014 has been widely denounced, especially as Azerbaijan chaired the CoE Committee of Ministers from May to November of that year. The European Parliament adopted a resolution in September recognizing the worsening of the human rights situation over the last five years. The United Nations Subcommittee on Human Rights cut short a fall 2014 visit to Azerbaijan because its members were barred from visiting “places of detention” to which they had been promised access. In December, the US State Department called for an end to restrictions on civil society after the arrest of 25\n\nA Starting Point: History and Geopolitics and What They Tell Us\n\ninvestigative journalist Khadija Ismayilova, a reporter for US-funded Radio Liberty. The United States expressed concern that Azerbaijan was not living up to its international commitments in human rights. The Radio Liberty office in Baku was raided and closed two weeks after her arrest. The Ismayilova case illustrates the complexity of Azerbaijan’s position with regard to its foreign and domestic policy, particularly toward the United States. Although such bodies as the CoE and the United States have framed criticism of tainted elections and human rights violations in terms of fulfilling obligations that Azerbaijan assumed when it joined international institutions (including the CoE), Azerbaijani government spokesmen have long charged that such Western criticism constitutes interference in Azerbaijan’s internal affairs. As the crackdown on civil society grew worse in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and seizure of Crimea, the rhetoric from Baku became sharper.48 Recently, Azerbaijan government representatives and individuals close to the regime increasingly have said that the West uses a “double standard” in assessing Azerbaijan. The speaker of the Milli Majlis accused the European Parliament of having such a “double standard,” and Ramiz Mehdiyev accused critical journalists and NGOs of being “agents” of the United States.49 More worrying, Mehdiyev and President Aliyev himself have used language similar to that used by Russia in accusing the United States and the EU of fomenting unrest in Ukraine as a means to overthrow the pro-Russian Yanukovich government. In an article released on December 4, 2014, Mehdiyev claimed that the United States was engaging in “colonialism.” He also said that employees of the local Radio Liberty station were working for “patrons abroad”—a thinly veiled reference to the United States—and therefore were committing treason. This insinuation is especially ominous, since imprisoned journalists like Khadija Ismayilova would face more severe penalties if they were to be charged with treason rather than with lesser crimes such as libel. Azerbaijan also seems to be increasing its tilt toward Russia. On a December 2014 visit to Moscow, President Aliyev said that Azerbaijan and Russia plan to enhance their relationship in areas of finance, transportation, and even culture and education. That much was reported in the proregime press in Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijani press did not report Aliyev’s charge that “failed policies,” apparently those of the United States, were responsible for the rise of extremist groups, including the Islamic State.\n\n26\n\nA Starting Point: History and Geopolitics and What They Tell Us\n\nWhy Should the United States Care about Azerbaijan? At first glance, Azerbaijan’s location as the only state bordering both Russia and Iran suggests its significance in any US geostrategic calculation for both the Middle East and the eastern edges of Europe, as defined by State Department and US military geographic divisions.50 Azerbaijan can facilitate or obstruct the passage of drugs, weapons, terrorists, human cargo, money or precious minerals and gems, nuclear material, and other commodities or people between Iran and Russia. Its military bases can ease or block US passage to central or south Asia as the northern supply route to coalition forces in Afghanistan. As a hydrocarbon-rich state, it produces oil and natural gas for global markets, though mostly for US allies in Europe and for Israel, and the pipeline system runs through neighboring Georgia and Turkey, skirting longtime US adversaries Russia and Iran.51 Azerbaijan’s biggest problem, the war in Mountainous Karabagh and occupation of about 14 percent of its territory by Armenian forces, is relevant to US security considerations. Locally, the continued state of war is economically unproductive and drains both countries’ economies. Azerbaijan continues to divert its income to weapons, and Armenia supports the impoverished occupied zone. The war is also politically destabilizing because it provides an opening for outside manipulation and enables each government to use the state of war as an excuse to avoid domestic reform and quash internal critics, both of which can enhance popular discontent with the existing regimes. Without a political settlement, all parties run the risk that Azerbaijan will actually use the weapons it has amassed in recent years. Renewed fighting with more lethal and numerous weapons is likely to devastate both countries’ populations and land, and could draw in neighboring states like Iran and Turkey, as well as nonstate actors like the Islamic State, leading to a wider regional war in a volatile area.52 Azerbaijan’s legacy as a secular society (and secular state) with expanding education and use of English, at least among a certain stratum of youth, makes it a potentially suitable partner in this region for US commercial, military, and cultural cooperation. If Azerbaijan were to improve its record on political and electoral democratization, openness of civil society, and human rights, the partnership would appear far more viable. It is, therefore, in US interests to foster such democratization in Azerbaijan and bring it more fully into the Western cultural and political sphere. When US relations with Russia and Iran are strained, Azerbaijan’s currency rises in Washington. Conversely, the 27\n\nA Starting Point: History and Geopolitics and What They Tell Us\n\nObama administration’s 2009 “reset” of relations with Moscow, less than a year after Russia’s invasion of Georgia, implied a decline in the importance of the entire south Caucasus region from a US strategic perspective. As the United States improves relations with Iran based on the nuclear agreement of 2015 under President Hassan Rouhani, Azerbaijan seems less important than its larger neighbor. When Iranian oil comes back onto world markets, the quantity may dwarf Azerbaijan’s contribution. Given the many advantages of improved relations with Russia and Iran, a realist might argue that it makes sense for the United States to downgrade Azerbaijan in its regional strategic calculus. To say this is shortsighted. Russia has consistent ambitions, and it is not in US interests to see expanded Russian power on the edge of the Middle East, with Azerbaijan’s oil and gas resources contributing to Russian control. Good relations, like bad ones, are temporary, and may even be brief. The 2016 resurgence of plans for the Russian-Iranian transit corridor, in which Azerbaijan is a crucial link, should sharpen Washington’s attention to Russian power in the Middle East and the implications of relations among Tehran, Baku, Moscow, and Ankara.53\n\nWhy Should Azerbaijan Incline toward the West? A more surprising question may well be why Azerbaijan should incline toward the West rather than Russia, especially after the events of 2014–15. For many years, it seemed certain that Azerbaijan’s post-Soviet leadership saw itself as a potential model for a secular state with a Muslim population, one that could maintain good relations with the West and interact with numerous international and European institutions. Abulfez Elchibey certainly intended to join the West, and Heydar Aliyev stated his intention to bring Azerbaijan into Europe. In many respects, post-Soviet Azerbaijan looked like Turkey, or at least like Turkey before the advent of conservative President Recep Tayyib Erdoğan. But Western pressure for observance of human rights and democratization of political processes, pressure which always rankled in Baku, was over time openly criticized. Always sensitive to an imagined “double standard,” official and quasiofficial voices have recently used the phrase to challenge Western leaders.54 Saudi Arabia, to take one counterexample, has human rights violations and political prisoners, but the United States treats the kingdom as a close ally. The United States itself is taken to task in every Amnesty International annual report because most US states still have the 28\n\nA Starting Point: History and Geopolitics and What They Tell Us\n\ndeath penalty. In October 2014, an Azerbaijani in the presidential apparatus wrote a position paper claiming that the United States ought to be and act more grateful toward Azerbaijan for its strategic partnership in the war on terror and energy security.55 Such gratitude would take the form of US reevaluation of its policies in the region, without which Azerbaijan would incline more toward other international partners, including Russia. In December of that same year, President Ilham Aliyev lauded the possibilities of improved Azerbaijani-Russian relations for trade, tourism, transportation, energy, and even education; he referred to Russia as a “friend country.”56 Azerbaijan, like any state, is most greatly concerned with maintaining its independence and security, including its territorial integrity. As the only state bordering both Russia and Iran, any Azerbaijani government must seek a balance between the demands of these two powerful neighbors. The 2015–16 discussions on a north-south transit corridor to link Russia and Iran through Azerbaijan reflect more than balancing demands; the project will militate toward political cooperation and bring commercial advantages. In contrast to oil-producing countries that suffer from low oil prices, Europe and the United States have much to offer in terms of markets, financial support, and military and technological systems. But the EU and NATO are far away, and the United States is farther still. The limited Western responses to Russian actions in Georgia in 2008 and the restrained military response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including the seizure and annexation of Crimea in 2014, illustrated to Baku that cultivating its Western partnership becomes more risky when its northern neighbor is more aggressive. Indeed, it would be sensible to make friends with Russia—the greatest threat to Azerbaijan’s independence. Russia could disrupt Azerbaijan directly or, more likely, indirectly through Muslim extremists in Dagestan or the unresolved war in Mountainous Karabagh. After a cease-fire of more than twenty years, Azerbaijan is armed to the teeth. Its $5 billion defense budget (as of 2015) is larger than Armenia’s entire state budget. Baku buys weapon systems from Turkey, Israel, and even Russia, despite Moscow’s military cooperation treaty with Yerevan. Russia can use the Karabagh stalemate as leverage against Azerbaijan, because the conflict is not “frozen,” but simmering—and a slight increase of heat or pressure can cause it to boil.57 Such are the interests of state. But Azerbaijan’s elites are also oligarchs with millions, perhaps billions of dollars of private wealth. For them, the West has other advantages beyond military or financial state-to-state aid. Western countries offer legal protection of person and property, and high living standards 29\n\nA Starting Point: History and Geopolitics and What They Tell Us\n\nand privacy for the elites who can afford them. The United Kingdom ranks first among countries in which the world’s super-rich will try to gain second citizenship, or primary citizenship for their children.58 Thus, the interests of elites in cases like that of Azerbaijan must be regarded as separate from the interests of the country and society. In case of revolution, oligarchs want an exit strategy that preserves not only their lives but also their wealth and privilege. These calculations are unspoken, hidden behind the official rhetoric about preservation of statehood and independence. Using the defense of independence argument, the Aliyev regime has quashed all critics, from investigative journalists to civil society activists and human rights defenders. Yet it uses the rhetoric of human rights and democracy, claiming that it is a democracy with fair elections, separation of powers, and the rule of law. Western criticism angers the regime, but Western silence regarding elections and arrests angers the population and disappoints the prodemocracy forces, weakening the West’s image and ability to project soft power. Azerbaijan remains a puzzle, important to the West for energy and security reasons but moving farther from democratic values articulated not only by the Popular Front but also by Heydar Aliyev. How did Azerbaijan’s post-Soviet transition come to this point? What were the decisions, the leaders, and the forces that brought the restive but promising Azerbaijan of the early 1990s to its current place of wealth, corruption, and authoritarian rule? If we return to the beginning, we must examine the impact of the open wound: the war in Mountainous Karabagh.\n\n30\n\n2 The Open Wound: Mountainous Karabagh and National Consciousness\n\nEvery shift of a kilometer on the map of the Nagorny-Karabagh war altered people’s lives forever. —Thomas de Waal, Black Garden (rev. ed.), 235\n\nThe name “Karabagh” is a battle cry, and the conflict there remains an open wound. For Azerbaijan in the late Soviet period, Armenia’s challenge to Azerbaijan’s possession of this region was the most powerful engine of political change. It drove thousands of ordinary Azerbaijani citizens into public squares, time after time, to demand that local communist party leaders defend their land and their national honor. It triggered the secret and risky anticommunist meetings in the Academy of Sciences that led to the founding of the Popular Front. Passions around Karabagh were so great and so widely shared that the members of the rubber-stamp Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic risked their careers and personal independence by openly opposing the communist party and denouncing party leaders’ inaction in regime newspapers. Leading scholars and writers refused a direct order from the Azerbaijan Communist Party first secretary to write in favor of relinquishing the region to Armenia, and instead published an argument that 31\n\nThe Open Wound: Mountainous Karabagh and National Consciousness\n\nthe land was rightfully a part of Azerbaijan.1 Without the Karabagh conflict, it is impossible to envision a unified challenge to communist party rule in Azerbaijan in the late 1980s. As the conflict became a war, it focused cultural and intellectual currents and seared a national identity into the Azerbaijani consciousness that had been only partly formed under Soviet-era repressions. This chapter is not a recapitulation of the struggle, the war, or the complex conflicting claims to Mountainous Karabagh. (In the mid-1990s, I wrote several lengthy articles about the early years of this problem,2 and other outside specialists, notably Thomas de Waal,3 have written in-depth, book-length accounts. Armenian and Azerbaijani publicists, scholars, journalists, commentators, bloggers, and others have produced an enormous quantity of material of varying quality.) Rather than go over old ground, this chapter examines the impact of the perceptions and policies around the Karabagh problem on Azerbaijanis, and on Azerbaijan as a country, from the late 1980s until the cease-fire was signed in May 1994. It ends with a brief consideration of significant negotiations that followed. Mountainous Karabagh—the word karabagh literally meaning “black garden”—has been known in the West by the Russian form “Nagorno-Karabagh” from the Soviet-era Nagorno-Karabagh Autonomous Region (oblast’), which had been created in western Azerbaijan to accommodate the region’s concentrated ethnic Armenian population residing there.4 Even though the autonomous region nominally had been created to protect the rights of the Armenian minority, this Soviet structure allowed the center to maintain leverage over both sides in case of future disputes over such core issues as autonomy.5 From the NKAR’s establishment in the early 1920s, both Azerbaijani and Armenian communist leaders disagreed about its existence as an autonomous region, its status, and its level of autonomy. The disposition of this region was part of a larger territorial settlement concerning three regions—Nakhjivan, Zangezur, and Mountainous Karabagh—claimed by both of the formerly independent neighbors that came under Soviet rule in 1920. Their claims on territory were not “ancient,” but were part of the modern national movements in the Caucasus, with their notion of the sacredness of native soil. Wartime population displacement changed some of the concentrations of ethno-national groups from the distributions that had been mapped in the Russian Imperial census of 1897. The presence of Ottoman troops in 1918, the diplomatic relations between the Turkish national (Kemalist) movement and the Bolsheviks, and other international factors affected population movement and political claims to land. In the early 1920s, Nakhjivan became part of Azerbaijan,6 though it is separated from 32\n\nThe Open Wound: Mountainous Karabagh and National Consciousness\n\nthe main portion of Azerbaijan by Zangezur—which in turn went to Armenia. The Mountainous Karabagh region also went to Azerbaijan and was later defined as the NKAR, with cultural autonomy for the Armenian population. It was administered by a mostly Armenian Communist Party organization.7 Armenians reportedly challenged Azerbaijan’s possession of the NKAR several times during the Soviet period, but initiatives to make territorial changes were quashed by the central Soviet leadership. In the Gorbachev era, however, Moscow’s campaigns for openness (glasnost) and political and economic restructuring (perestroika) seemed to open the door to precisely such revisions of status. In 1986, early in the Gorbachev period, a group of Armenia"
