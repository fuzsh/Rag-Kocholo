        "text": "Moscow Patriarchate foreign affairs chief Monk Philippe said the response behavior of Azerbaijan to his words about ‘three acting Moscow Patriarchate churches in Armenia including in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic’ is definitely ‘disproportionate’.\n\nAzerbaijan’s State Committee for Religious Organization Relations chairman Hidayat Orujov in response to Monk Philippe’s saying demanded satisfaction from the Baku Diocese bishop. In particular, Monk Philippe said there are three Moscow Patriarchate churches in Armenia, of these one is placed in Yerevan, the second – in Russia's military ground in Gyumri town, and the third one in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic.\n\nDespite NKR is Armenian-populated country, historically Armenian from ancient times and separated from Azerbaijan after collapse of the Soviet Union, Hidayat Orujov in response to this said Karabakh is part and parcel of Azerbaijan. He said doesn’t understand why churches in Karabakh are named “churches in Armenia’.\n\n“It seems to me the comprehensive and full explanations have been already given,” said Monk Philippe. “If someone wants to incandesce relations between Russia and Azerbaijan or to find one more reason to fight against its own democratically elected government through this unwitting clause which was said in connection with His Holiness Patriarch Cyril’s upcoming visit to Armenia then God will judge them. Who sows the wind, he will sow the storm, says the Scripture.”"
