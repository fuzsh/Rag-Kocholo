        "text": "On May 20, a patriotic spectacle dedicated to the 99th anniversary of the national leader Heydar Aliyev was performed written by Hidayet Orujov by the actors of the Yerevan State Azerbaijan Drama Theater named after Cafer JabbarlÄ± at the Sumgait State Drama Theater.\n\nIt should be noted that the events in the performance cover the period from 1968 to the present. The play tells about the socio-political situation of our compatriots in West Azerbaijan, the former Turkish lands, the literary and cultural environment, the activities of the Yerevan State Azerbaijan Drama Theater and the decades-long struggle of Azerbaijanis against the insidious armenian policy. This plays which includes the comprehensive support of Heydar Aliyev ruled Azerbaijan for the first time to our citizens living in West Azerbaijan and the struggle against armenian leadership to the policy of continuous national oppression was attentively watched by our team.\n\nThe strong personality and multifaceted activities of the great leader Heydar Aliyev who devoted his whole life to the development and progress of Azerbaijan, the preservation of national-state traditions and the promotion of material and cultural heritage to the world have always been a source of inspiration for creative people.\n\nBorchali, West Azerbaijan, Karabakh and Zengazur issues have always occupied an important place in the versatile activity of the wise person, thinker and statesman, national leader Heydar Aliyev. The Great Leader was interested in the parts of the Motherland which were excluded and captured by the politics of the empires.\n\nHidayat Orujov's work \"A thousand horsemen passed here\" once again revealed this history by reflecting the essence of his thoughts and policy on West Azerbaijan.\n\nA well-known author, Honorable Art Worker, diplomat, public and political figure Hidayet OrujovÊ¾s works, his numerous scientific and journalistic articles, examples of poetry, novels and stories, especially a work of \"A thousand horsemen passed here\" reflecting the legacy, personality and multifaceted activity of Heydar Aliyev are known not only in our country but also abroad.\n\nAll the events in the performance take place in front of the so-called Armenia map created by the Bolsheviks in the 20th century in West Azerbaijan, where our old place names hang from the stage. This is not without reason: the conflict of the game is based on the resistance of our compatriots against the policy of the Armenian leadership to end the national existence of Azerbaijan, which is reflected on the map and the support of the national leader Heydar Aliyev by all possible means.\n\nThe joint creative work of the founding director, People's Artist Firudin Maharramov, artist Vahid Mirzaliyev, music composer Chingiz Khalilov and assistant director Imamali Imamaliyev provided a convincing delivery of the historical truth expressed in the text of the play to the modern audience. The bright image of the leader of Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev was professionally created by the director of the theater, Honored Cultural Worker Ikhtiyar Piriyev. The actor's intricate creative pursuits have been very successful in expressing the outward and inward subtleties of the unique, charismatic image of the Great Leader.\n\nWe should note once again that the performance \"A thousand horsemen passed here\" caused great interest and applause from the audience who watched it attentively and excitedly.\n\nThere were many unforgettable moments in the fortune of Sumgayit State University which is preparing to celebrate its 60th anniversary this year. One of them took place at the Sumgayit State Drama Theater while watching the play \"A thousand horsemen passed here\" presented by the staff of the Yerevan Drama Theater.\n\nWe are representatives of a powerful and talented nation that immortalizes history in both literary and artistic works. We thank the masters of the stage, prominent writer-dramatist, Honored Art Worker, diplomat Mr. Hidayat Orujov who lived these unforgettable moments in the performance and wish them success in their work!"
