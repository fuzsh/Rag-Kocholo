        "text": "An opening ceremony of the “Karabakh Victory” exhibition was held at Kyrgyz-Turkish Manas University.\n\nReport informs, citing Azerbaijani Embassy in Kyrgyzstan, that the event was attended by Azerbaijani ambassador Hidayet Orujov, members of the Kyrgyz Parliament, ambassadors accredited to this country, employees of the diplomatic representations, scientific, cultural, and art figures, media representatives, teaching staff of the university, students, members of Azerbaijani diaspora.\n\nFirst of all, the martyrs of the Great Patriotic War, who sacrificed their lives for the territorial integrity of our country, were commemorated with a moment of silence. The national anthems of Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkey were sung. A short film on “Victory Parade of the Azerbaijani Army” made by the Baku Media Center was shown.\n\nOpening the event, Rector of Kyrgyzstan-Turkey Manas University, Professor Alpaslan Ceylan, congratulated the heroic army of Azerbaijan, who put an end to the 30-year occupation of Karabakh, wished God’s mercy upon martyrs, expressed condolences to our people, and wished speedy recovery for wounded service members. The rector stressed that the Azerbaijani-Turkish union is a clear example of friendship and brotherhood.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Ambassador Hidayat Orujov said that on March 30, 2019, Armenian Defense Minister David Tonoyan said at a meeting with the Armenian community in New York that the “territory for peace” approach will not be applied and the new approach will be “a new war for new territories.” On August 5, 2019, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan danced on the “Jidir Plain” of Azerbaijan and said that “Karabakh is Armenia, full stop.” These unthinkable provocative actions show that the country’s political and military leaders have not yet perceived their crimes.\n\nThe main reason for our tremendous success in the counter-offensive operation launched by the Azerbaijani Army against the occupying Armenian armed forces on September 27, 2020, is the strong state, strong army strategy, national unity, and enthusiasm of our warriors.\n\nAzerbaijan has paid particular attention to the use of modern weapons in the war by applying a strategy that is an innovation in military history. As a result, it advanced rapidly, cleared our occupied territories of the enemy, destroyed all enemy military equipment, and dealt a severe blow at its manpower. Thus, under the leadership of Supreme Commander-in-Chief Ilham Aliyev, the mighty Azerbaijani Army solved the problem in 44 days, while the international organizations have not been able to do for 30 years.\n\nIn his speech, the Turkish Ambassador to Kyrgyzstan Ahmet Sadık Doğan said that the Azerbaijani people were right and won a rightful victory in the war. The Ambassador congratulated the Azerbaijani people and the Turkic world on this significant historical event.\n\nThen the Kyrgyz-Turkish Manas University rector, Professor Alpaslan Ceylan, Ambassador Hidayat Orujov, and the Ambassador of the Republic of Turkey to the country Ahmet Sadık Doğan cut the red ribbon of the exhibition.\n\nThe participants got acquainted with the exhibition, which reflects the victorious ways of our brave army."
