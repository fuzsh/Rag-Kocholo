        "text": "08.04.2011, Community Life\n\nThe opening of the new synagogue building for Mountain Jews of Azerbaijan, built with government funding in less than six months, took place on April 5. The crowd of attendees was so large at the opening ceremony in central Baku that the police had to block traffic.\n\nBefore the ceremony, the chairman of the Mountain Jews community in Azerbaijan, Semyon Ikhiilov, welcomed the distinguished guests. He gave a brief tour of the building, which was built in the historic Jewish district of Baku. Everyone was awed by the sanctuary, with its high ceilings and windows, an ornate ceiling, a luminous chandelier, comfortable seating, and an impressive Aron Kodesh (Torah ark).\n\nThe other wing of the new synagogue holds a dining room and kitchen on the ground floor, a conference hall, chairman’s office and reception area on the second floor, and the library on the third floor.\n\n“We Jews of Azerbaijan would like to express our sincere appreciation to our distinguished President Ilham Aliyev, who personally undertook that this house of worship be built! This is a unique case: in no other country in the world, not even in Israel, does the state build a synagogue at its own expense. This happens only in Azerbaijan,” emphasized Mr. Ikhiilov.\n\nThe Chairman of Azerbaijan’s State Committee for Working with Religious Organizations, Hidayat Orujov, stated that the new Baku synagogue is yet another symbol of the unity of all ethnic groups and religions in Azerbaijan. The synagogue, as well as local mosques, Orthodox churches and the Catholic cathedral, were all built or underwent major renovations in recent years with the active support of state and public bodies.\n\nIsraeli Ambassador to Azerbaijan Michael Lavon Lotem also emphasized the significance of the fact that such a synagogue has been built with state support in what is largely a Muslim country. “At the expense of the state, a beautiful synagogue was built, setting a bright example worth emulating. “The Director of Strategic Planning for the Joint Distribution Committee, Arie Dubov, who traveled from New York to Baku especially for the opening, commented, “The opening of this synagogue in Baku is an important event in the life of not only Jews of Azerbaijan, but Jews everywhere.”\n\nMany other top officials, members of parliament, renowned community and social activists, and Jewish leaders took turns extending congratulations, including Chairman of the Ashkenazi Jewish community of Baku Gennady Zelmanovich, Chairman of the Georgian Jewish Community Abram Chahrushev, and the Chairman of the Mountain Jews of Krasnaya Sloboda Boris Semanduev.\n\n\"Jews have lived on the fertile land of Azerbaijan for 27 centuries without experiencing hostility towards themselves or their religion. Azerbaijan is our home and Azeris are our brothers. We are grateful to the national leader and esteemed President of the people of Azerbaijan, Heidar Aliyev. Thank you for ensuring stability, civil harmony and tolerance,” stated Mr. Iliikhov. His speech was met with a standing ovation.\n\nThe Chairman of the community of Mountain Jews of Azerbaijan then extended appreciation, on behalf of the entire community, to Badal Badalov, who supervised the construction work, to the builders of the Azerbaijan Republic State Oil Company for their quality work, and to the building’s architect Alexander Garber.\n\nFJC.ru"
