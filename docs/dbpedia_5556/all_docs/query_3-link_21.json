        "text": "President of Kyrgyzstan Sadyr Japarov received the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Azerbaijan to Kyrgyzstan Hidayat Orujov. Press service of the head of state reported.\n\nThe parties exchanged views on the issues of enhancing cooperation between the countries in the political-diplomatic, trade-economic, social-humanitarian and other spheres. The President noted that Kyrgyzstan attaches great importance to further development of traditional friendly relations with Azerbaijan. He stressed importance of supporting political dialogue at the high and highest levels.\n\nSadyr Japarov noted that one of the key directions for further development of relations between Kyrgyzstan and Azerbaijan was diversification of economic cooperation, which has significant but unrealized potential.\n\nTo improve the situation, he proposed to intensify trade and economic interaction between the states by holding a meeting of the intergovernmental commission in 2021, visits of representatives of the business community, as well as implementation of mutually beneficial economic projects.\n\nThe head of state thanked the Azerbaijani side for financial assistance in implementation of two projects — construction of the Kyrgyzstan-Azerbaijan Friendship Park and the Heydar Aliyev secondary school in Bishkek. He expressed confidence that these projects would be completed by the upcoming visit of the leader of Azerbaijan to Kyrgyzstan.\n\nThe Ambassador Hidayat Orujov noted the great unused potential for development of economic cooperation, expressing readiness of the Azerbaijani side to attract new investments to Kyrgyzstan. He especially noted that Azerbaijan supports the reform policy pursued by Sadyr Japarov, and on behalf of the leadership of his country invited the head of state to visit Azerbaijan."
