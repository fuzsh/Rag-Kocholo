        "text": "\"Eurasianism as theory and practice is an increasingly important component of Russian modern political discourse. Not surprisingly, Azerbaijanis have been both attracted and repelled by aspects of this ideology and its potential application in the post-Soviet space. Given the diversity of ideas and programs that exist under the rubric “Eurasian,” of course, it is impossible to predict with precision the consequences of the strengthening of Eurasian trends in Russia for Azerbaijan, but given the attention this set of ideas is receiving in Russia, Azerbaijanis cannot afford to ignore it\". (c)\n\nOn October 24, Azerbaijan won election to the United Nations Security Council after a campaign that reflected far more than business as usual at the UN. Azerbaijan managed to win a majority of UN members, but apparently many Western countries opposed its election. In this case, however, Western diplomats should blame themselves for alienating Azerbaijan. The result reflected the success of Azerbaijan’s foreign policy and its diplomacy, as well as the reputation it has garnered.\n\nThe post-Soviet space is fraught with multiple problems, risks and threats caused by unresolved conflicts. The vast majority of these conflicts possess a strong ethno-political component that complicates all the conflict resolution attempts: Neglect of the role of ethnicity in interstate and intrastate conflicts can lead to overt conflict on the one hand and a deadlocked situation in respect to all mediation on the other hand. This article focuses upon the role and impact of ethnicity factor and the ways in which it is exploited and manipulated. The Nagorno Karabakh conflict serves as the major empirical case.\n\nIt has already been 23 years since the cease fire agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan about Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, but we have not witnessed any real progress in the conflict-resolution process up until now. At one point, starting in 2009, leaders of both countries became more open to dialogue, but summer and autumn of 2014 proved that the steps were taken backwards . There are some major developments to be witnessed, more so when even the agreement on ceasefire remains under question and there are severe escalations from time to time. This paper is not concerned about establishing right or wrong in the conflict and is not suggesting a way of final resolution of the problem, but is more oriented on current issues and promoting more constructive development of the process."
