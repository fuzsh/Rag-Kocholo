being presented with a list of candidates determined by national ratings averages box office grosses and album sales they had the option to write in their favorites Knowledge Networks recruits its panel by using a RDD phone recruitment method and provides a web TV and Internet access to households without Internet access enabling them to infer back to the entire population The nominees for the People s Choice Awards were determined by the media research company Visible Measures which specializes in measuring Internet video audience behavior The announcement of this partnership stated \"For the first time ever the People s Choice Awards has incorporated Internet video viewing data into the initial nominee selection process depending on Visible Measures True Reach metrics to objectively
