BAKU – Freedoms in Azerbaijan are being used by some countries in a bid to influence the religious situation in the country, chairman of the State Committee on Religious Organizations Hidayat Orujov has said. He did not cite any country in particular.

"Persons seeking to disrupt religious stability in Azerbaijan are serving the interests of numerous foreign countries’ secret services and acting on their behest. These forces are availing of political and personal interests of separate groups for their ends," Orujov told a news conference Friday.

Orujov said that these forces include people who present themselves as followers of both Islam and other religions.

He noted, however, that since these groups are rejected by the Azerbaijani government and public, their influence in the country is insignificant. "I believe that soon those small groups will cease to exist altogether."
