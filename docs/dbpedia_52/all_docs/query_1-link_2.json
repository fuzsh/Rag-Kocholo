Following the success of the series, a number of high-quality contemporary copies were producedâat least seven painted copies of Bacchus are knownâand, as with other Poussin paintings, the existence of copies led to a prolonged period of questioned authenticity. Uncertainty about the Nelson-Atkins painting was first raised by Paul Jamot in 1925: âItâs the execution here that fails. It is exact, correct, but of a sort of cold and dead perfection.â1Paul Jamot, âSur quelques tableaux de Poussin Ã propos de lâexposition du paysage franÃ§ais,â Bulletin de la SociÃ©tÃ© de lâhistoire de lâart franÃ§ais (1925): 103. Translated from French by Nicole R. Myers, former associate curator, European paintings and sculpture, Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. Although the provenance history of Bacchus matches that of Pan until 1850, and the Nelson-Atkins painting was largely accepted as the original when the Richelieu series was reunited in 1981, some lingering doubts persisted in the literature. In 1994, Jacques Thuillier described Bacchus as a copy that âfound defendersâ and called for a scientific study to compare the series: âThere is little chance that for these four works, painted over a short period of time and with the same destination, Poussin would have changed the type of canvas and preparation, or that his handling would have evolved much.â2Jacques Thuillier, âPoussin et la laboratoire,â TechnÃ©, no. 1 (1994): 18. Translation provided by Nicole R. Myers, former associate curator, European paintings and sculpture, Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. The fourth painting to which Thuillier refers is Poussinâs Birth of Venus, sometimes titled Triumph of Neptune (1635 or 1634; Philadelphia Museum of Art, E1932-1-1). The thread count of its canvas is markedly different than that of the other three, so that higher-level comparison was not undertaken. Mark Tucker, Aronson Senior Conservator of Paintings and Vice Chair of Conservation, Philadelphia Museum of Art, email message with the author, 2015. The authors thank Tucker for providing his manual thread counts that established this difference. To answer many of the questions that Thuillier posed, a technical study of the Nelson-Atkins painting and a comparison of the Richelieu canvas supports were conducted in 2011.3The authors are indebted to Nicole R. Myers, former associate curator, European paintings and sculpture, Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, for her curatorial contributions to the study.,4The scientific study of The Triumph of Bacchus was supported by an endowment from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for conservation science at The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art.,5Results from the technical study were disseminated in two prior publications. See John Twilley, Nicole Myers, and Mary Schafer, âPoussinâs Materials and Techniques for The Triumph of Bacchus at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art,â Kermes 27, nos. 94â95 (April/September 2014): 71â83.

A scientific study of the Bacchus palette was undertaken in anticipation of a conservation treatment that would require more information on the original materials and their alteration over time. The success of the canvas weave match in linking all three paintings provided the basis for the palette study and may contribute to solving an art historical mystery: Do variations in the artistâs pigment use and the subsequent alteration of pigments influence the perceptions that sharply divided art historical opinion about whether the three paintings shared a common origin?\n\nCanvas Weave Comparisons of the Richelieu Bacchanals\n\nHistorically, canvas weaves have been compared either by manually counting the average number of threads per centimeter in the warp and weft directions with the aid of magnification and a ruler, or counting them from radiographsX-ray radiography (also referred to as x-radiography or radiography): Radiography is an examination tool analogous to the use of X-rays in medicine whereby denser components of a painted composition can be recorded as an inverted shadow image cast on film or a digital X-ray imaging plate from a source such as an X-ray tube. The method has been used for more than a century and is most effective with dense pigments incorporating metallic elements such as lead or zinc. It can reveal artist changes, underlying compositions, and information concerning the artworkâs construction and condition. The resulting image is called an x-radiograph or radiograph. It differs from the uses of X-ray spectrometry in being dependent on the density of the paint to absorb X-rays before they reach the film or image plate and being non-specific as to which elements are responsible for the resulting shadow image. in which the canvas weave is visible. The process was error-prone, somewhat subjective, and often too coarse for statistical measures of the quality of a âmatchâ to have real meaning. More recently, automated methods applied to radiographs of paintings have greatly improved the accuracy of thread counts and led to new forms of comparison derived from distortions of the weave that are imposed during stretching the canvas or subsequent modifications in its mounting or format.\n\nThe need for a rigorous comparison of the canvases and the need to quantify the certainty of an outcome that proved surprising to some, by demonstrating that all three bacchanals of the Richelieu commission were derived from the same bolt of cloth and that the third original painting of the group was one that had long been regarded as a copy, led to important refinements for comparing their weaves and in the methods available to the field of art history for the study of other paintings.\n\nThe initial comparison conducted by Robert Erdmann and C. Richard Johnson under the rubric of the Thread Count Automation Project, using radiographs generously provided by the National Gallery of Art, London, for Pan and Silenus employed mathematical methods previously used by Johnson and his collaborators.6These made use of a mathematical function known as the Fourier transform, operating on a digitized version of the painting radiograph, centimeter by centimeter. See D.H. Johnson, R.G. Erdmann, and C.R. Johnson, Jr., âWhole-Painting Canvas Analysis Using High- and Low-Level Features,â Proceeding of the 36th International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (2011): 969â72; and D.

Erdmann, âWeave Analysis of Paintings on Canvas from Radiographs,â Signal Processing (Special Issue on Image Processing for Digital Art Work) 93, no. 3 (March 2013): 527â40. The result provided objective measurements of the variability in spacings between the threads in both directions and the angles at which the warp and weft intersect on a centimeter-scale grid. The outcome of the canvas weave comparisonâa triple-weave match among the three paintingsâconfirmed that all three supports originated from the same bolt of cloth (Fig. 6 ).7Robert Erdmann and C. Richard Johnson, December 13, 2011, âAutomated Canvas Examination: Poussin / NAMA / 31-94,â unpublished report, NAMA conservation file, no. 31-94.

Twilley et al., âPoussinâs Materials and Techniques for The Triumph of Bacchus at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art,â 71â83. While this conclusion strengthens the widely held view that the Nelson-Atkins painting is original, the results held far greater implications for Silenus, which had long been considered a copy, although Pierre Rosenberg, Hugh Brigstock, and Henry Keazor believed it to be autograph.8Pierre Rosenberg, Nicholas Poussin, 1594â1665, exhibition catalog, (Paris: RÃ©union des museÃ©s nationaux, 1994), 226.

A recent cleaning and in-depth technical study of Silenus has led to its reinstatement as an autograph work.9Francesca Whitlum-Cooper, âPoussinâs âTriumph of Silenusâ Rediscovered,â The Burlington Magazine 163, no. 1418 (May 2021): 408â15.\n\nStrong cuspingcusping: A scalloped pattern along the canvas edges that relates to how the canvas was stretched. Primary cusping reveals where tacks secured the canvas to the support while the ground layer was applied. Secondary cusping can form when a pre-primed canvas is re-stretched by the artist prior to painting. along the right and left canvas edges of Bacchus and Pan, as revealed through the initial process, established a particularly close connection between these two paintings. However, the method required heavy intervention by the operator and was unable to deal with radiographic features that often interfered with the weave, including obscuring paint textures. It stopped short of being a thread-by-thread comparison and it lacked a means for human manual verification.\n\nThe development of an improved method, based on autocorrelation analysis and pattern-recognition algorithms, was prompted by the need to substantiate an outcome that ran counter to the widely-held opinion that Silenus was not the original version by Poussin. The result of doing this along five guide threads for the three paintings of the Richelieu commission demonstrated a single abrupt increase in the quality of the match at one, unique juxtaposition of the canvases.10To demonstrate that a comparable outcome could be obtained from a guided traverse along a single thread, the innovation of using a âguide threadâ visible in the radiograph, along which the spacing of every crossing thread could be manually entered, was introduced. The resulting set of spacing measurements could then be shifted, thread by thread, away from the apparent best match in both directions, and the quality of match in the resulting trial alignments plotted. See Erdmann et al., âReuniting Poussinâs Bacchanals Painted for Cardinal Richelieu through Quantitative Canvas Weave Analysis,â 155â72.\n\nThe challenge of making a full thread-by-thread demonstration of the match computationally feasible was subsequently taken up by Laurens van der Maaten under the direction of Robert Erdmann.11Van der Maaten employed a machine learning approach that made a full comparison of the canvases in both directions possible at the level of individual thread spacings. The twelve-thousand, manually-extracted, thread-crossing measurements along the guide threads used in validation of the previous match were used in training of the new algorithm. Incorporated into van der Maatenâs solution was a means for projecting the re-emergence points of individual threads that become locally obscured in the radiograph by heavy overlapping paint strokes, increasing the proportion of the canvas that could be included in difficult comparisons. This method eliminated reliance upon local averages of thread spacings and made full thread-by-thread comparisons possible. See L.J.P. van der Maaten and R.G. Erdmann, âAutomatic thread-level canvas analysis,â IEEE Signal Processing Magazine 32, no. 4 (2015): 38â45. The results of this thrice-repeated match with increasingly sophisticated methods not only bolstered the case for a common origin of the three Poussin bacchanals, but also led to improvements in the methodology for other works.\n\nOverview of the Painting Construction of Bacchus\n\nBacchus was executed on a coarse, loosely woven, plain-weaveplain weave: A basic textile weave in which one weft thread alternates over and under the warp threads. Often this structure consists of one thread in each direction, but threads can be doubled (basket weave) or tripled to create more complex plain weave. Plain weave is sometimes called tabby weave. canvas, which is featured prominently in the radiograph due to the low contrast of the thinly-painted composition (Fig. 7 ).12See film-based radiographs, no. 461, Nelson-Atkins conservation file, no. 31-94.

This feature can be seen in the radiographs of numerous other works by the artist,13Similar radio-transparent lines have been observed in the radiographs of the following Poussin works: Holy Family on the Steps (1648; Cleveland Museum of Art), Holy Family (1640â1642; Detroit Institute of Arts), and Holy Family with Ten Figures (1649; National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin). See Carol Sawyer, assisted by Marcia Steele, âPoussinâs Holy Family on the Steps: New Technical Discoveries, Comparisons, and the Washington Copy,â Cleveland Studies in the History of Art 4, (1999): 142n23. although for Bacchus, these radio-transparent lines do not exist at all four perimeters, nor are they equidistant from the painting edges. Additionally, cusping patterns are pronounced on the left and right, while diminished along the bottom edge, and missing at the top.14The cusping is visible in the radiograph but was also verified by canvas weave automation. Robert Erdmann and Richard C. Johnson, December 13, 2011, âAutomated Canvas Examination: Poussin \\ NAMA \\ 31-94,â unpublished report, Nelson-Atkins conservation file, no. 31-94. The varied positions of radio-transparent lines and intensities of cusping suggest that the dimensions of Bacchus may have been cropped on all four sides with a greater reduction in the overall height of the painting. Another possibility, however, is that the Bacchus canvas was obtained from a much larger, stretched and primed canvas, as demonstrated by Extreme Unction (1638-40; FitzWilliam Museum, University of Cambridge), which retains its original tacking margins and has radio-transparent lines on only two of its perimeter edges.15Helen Glanville, ââDe lumine et umbraââtheory and practice, material and perception, in the paintings of Nicolas Poussin (1594â1665)â (PhD diss., Department of Art History, University of La Sapienza, Rome, forthcoming).\n\nPoussinâs working method, as described by his biographers, was a painstaking process that involved a number of steps before paint was applied to canvas: quick sketches to develop the initial compositional concept; studies of illuminated wax models, often with additions of wet paper or fabric to simulate drapery; further sketching of live models; and pen and ink drawings.16See Anthony Blunt, Nicolas Poussin: The Andrew W. Mellon Lectures in Fine Arts, 1958 (London: Phaidon Press Ltd, 1967), 1:242â44. See also Diane DeGrazia and Marcia Steele, âThe âGrande Machine,ââ Cleveland Studies in the History of Art 4 (1999): 64â67. For the artistâs most complicated figural arrangements, like that of Bacchus, Antoine Le Blond de la Tour (1635â1706) described the artistâs use of a partially-enclosed box with a small aperture at the front that allowed Poussin to view the wax models on a gridded board in perspective scale, to explore the effects of light and shade, and to assess the overall composition.17DeGrazia and Steele, Cleveland Studies, 65â66.,18According to Joachim von Sandrart (1606â1688), Poussin began using this method of placing the wax figures on a gridded board around 1630.

(New York: Hudson Hills, 1988), 208.\n\nThe vanishing point of Bacchus is located on Herculesâ nose and aligns with the flat surfaces of the chariot. Covered by later paint applications, the small hole where the ground and canvas were pierced (3 millimeters in diameter) is evident in the radiograph (Fig. 9 ). A vertical line passing through this point meets Apolloâs eyes, while a horizontal line through this point intersects with a number of the procession revelers, traversing the eyes of Silenus (standing behind Cupid), the nymph who peeks over Herculesâ club, the trumpeter, until punctuated by the rightmost bacchante who turns her gaze back toward the center of the painting (Fig. 10 ). Bacchus, the female centaur, as well as the river god and putto at the lower corners turn their gaze toward the vanishing point.19Similarly, technical study of The Holy Family with the Infant Saint John the Baptist and Saint Elizabeth (1650â1651; Harvard Art Museums/Fogg Museum, Cambridge, MA) has shown that the gazes of all figures, with the exception of the lower left putto, are directed toward the vanishing point. Rikke Foulke, âThe Holy Family with the Infant Saint John the Baptist and Saint Elizabeth,â Kermes 27, nos. 94â95 (April/September 2014): 90. Orthogonal lines radiating from this location match the angle of the centaurâs torso and an upper left tree branch and intersect with Apollo in the sky, the centaurâs raised torch, and the pinecone tip of the thyrsusthyrsus: A staff or spear with an ornamental tip, such as a pinecone, that would be carried by Bacchic revelers..20Avigdor Arikha has shown that incised lines in the paint of The Rape of the Sabines (ca. 1637â1638; MusÃ©e du Louvre, Paris) radiate from a âpoint of harmony.â See Avigdor Arikha, Nicolas Poussin: The Rape of the Sabines, exh. cat., (Houston: Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, 1983), 28â32.\n\nLike many works by Poussin, there are numerous short incisions made in the wet ground that are visible to the naked eye, some of which appear to have been used to position the figures (Fig. 11 ). A few incisions, like the inscribed âXâ at the nape of the rightmost bacchanteâs neck (Fig. 12 ) and a similar feature on Apolloâs raised hand (Fig. 13 ), may correspond to a geometric framework, although many of these marks were likely covered by the artistâs paint. In her forthcoming research, Helen Glanville has identified an underlying âdivine geometryâ in Bacchus, a concept rooted in classical antiquity and the scriptures, as well as manuscripts of the period, specifically those of Matteo Zaccolini (1574â1630). In one geometric construction, she proposes that Poussin connected many of the figures (heavenly and earthly) in a large ellipse that surrounds the Bacchic revelers and passes through the âXâ of the rightmost figure.21Helen Glanville, â\"De lumine et umbra\"âtheory and practice, material and perception, in the paintings of Nicolas Poussin (1594â1665),â (forthcoming).\n\nNo underdrawingunderdrawing: A drawn or painted sketch beneath the paint layer. The underdrawing can be made from dry materials, such as graphite or charcoal, or wet materials, such as ink or paint. is detected with infrared reflectographyinfrared reflectography (IRR): A form of infrared imaging that exploits the behavior of painting materials at wavelengths beyond those accessible to infrared photography. These advantages sometimes include a continuing increase in the transparency of pigments beyond wavelengths accessible to infrared photography (i.e, beyond 1,000 nanometers), rendering underdrawing more clearly. The resulting image is called an infrared reflectogram. Devices that came into common use in the 1980s such as the infrared vidicon effectively revealed these features but suffered from lack of sharpness and uneven response. Vidicons continue to be used out to 2,200 nanometers but several newer pixelated detectors including indium gallium arsenide and indium antimonide array detectors offer improvements. All of these devices are optimally used with filters constraining their response to those parts of the infrared spectrum that reveal the most within the constraints of the palette used for a given painting. They can be used for transmitted light imaging as well as in reflection., although a few finely-painted dark brown strokes outline drapery in a sparsely painted area between Cupidâs legs (Fig. 14 ). Poussin initially constructed many of the figures with an underpaintingunderpainting: The first applications of paint that begin to block in color and loosely define the compositional elements. Also called Ã©bauche. of thin brown washeswash: An application of thin paint that has been diluted with solvent. and opaque shades of brown, gray, and beige. Many of these layers remain visible in the final painting, as illustrated in Figure 15 , where the underlying brown wash forms the shadows of the trumpeterâs cheek, nose, eyes, and forehead. The use of the colored ground enables this construction, which would not be possible with the thin brown wash atop a reflective white ground. The figures were further developed with additions of opaque pink and peach, applied in a fluid manner with a narrow brush and confident, painterly handling (Fig. 16 ). Gradual transitions exist between the highlights, midtones, and shadows with less pronounced brushwork. Throughout the figures, glimpses of the cool gray-brown underpainting are contrasted by the intense, warm pink of the flushed cheeks, accents on the facial features, and contouring strokes (Fig. 17 ). Fine touches of pale green, like those on Herculesâ fingernails (Fig. 18 ) and near the eyes of the river god and trumpeter (Figs. 11 and 15), accent many of the figures.22This aspect of Poussinâs technique was first documented in the 1999 technical study of The Holy Family on the Steps (1648; Cleveland Museum of Art). See Sawyer, assisted by Steele, âPoussinâs Holy Family on the Steps: New Technical Discoveries, Comparisons, and the Washington Copy,â 122.

Other examples of this technique include Landscape during a Thunderstorm with Pyramus and Thisbe (1651; StÃ¤del Museum, Frankfurt), Venus Presenting her Arms to Aeneas (1639; MusÃ©e des Beaux-Arts, Rouen), and The Crossing of the Red Sea (1632â1634; National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne). See Helen Glanville, âNicolas Poussin: Creation and Perception,â Kermes 27, nos. 94â95 (April/September 2014): 20, 22; Laurie Benson and Carl Villis, âThe Crossing of the Red Sea in the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne,â Kermes 27, nos. 94â95 (April/September 2014): 63â64. Similarly, the figure of the rightmost bacchante was complete before her blue robe was depicted, as revealed in the infrared reflectograminfrared reflectogram: An infrared image captured with an electronic infrared imager, typically in the 1000-2500 nanometer range. See Infrared reflectography (IRR). (Fig. 21 ).\n\nA radio-transparent passage at the upper left of the radiograph (Fig. 7 ) reveals that, in the early stages of blocking out the sky, the trees were left in reservereserve: An area of the composition left unpainted with the intention of inserting a feature at a later stage in the painting process.. These elements were painted directly on top of the beige ground, which remains visible where the edges of the trees meet the sky. The gray-blue central clouds were painted with zigzagging strokes, and streaks in the fluid paint reveal the movement and direction of the brush. Thin, streaky dark brown paint was applied to the foreground with loose horizontal strokes, followed by additions of opaque paint that define the foliage, rocks, edge of the river, and other foreground elements.\n\nFine lines, drawn through the wet paint with a sharply-pointed tool, mark straight lines on the chariot, the handle of the wreath-adorned spear, the legs of Herculesâ tripod, and the handle of the thyrsus. Poussin used a sharply-pointed instrument, perhaps a drafting compass, to mark the circular shapes of the chariot wheels, leaving two pinholes on each wheel (one at the center and one on the inner circle) that are visible with normal illumination (Fig. 22 ) and radiography.\n\nDespite Poussinâs thorough preparatory process, a number of significant artist changes can be identified on Bacchus.24The presence of these significant compositional changes further validates the authenticity of Bacchus, since it would be highly unusual for a copyist to take liberties with primary components of Poussinâs composition. Green paint beneath the upper right sky corresponds to an early placement of trees that initially balanced those on the left (Fig. 23 ). The dark shape of this tree grouping is faintly visible in the reflected infrared digital photographreflected infrared digital photograph: An infrared image produced in the 700â1000 nanometer range, typically captured using an infrared-modified digital camera. See infrared photography. of Figure 24 , extending 37 centimeters toward the center of the painting. Poussinâs shift away from a symmetrical border of trees is significant when compared to Pan and Silenus, for as Christopher Wright observed, âall three [Richelieu] compositions are set against a tree-filled landscape where the trunks form elaborate patterns except in The Triumph of Bacchus where they only occupy the left hand part of the background.â25Christopher Wright, Poussin Paintings: A Catalogue RaisonnÃ© (London: Harlequin Books, 1985), 53. Infrared imaging also reveals that a highly reflective garment once draped across the trumpeterâs body, and his shoulder and arm were repositioned three times. In one adjustment, his raised arm suspended red drapery above his proper left shoulder (Fig. 25 ). The garment can be inferred to have been painted with vermilion, based on this infrared behavior and the red hue that has emerged as aging of the overlying paint has increased its transparency. Additionally, this figureâs dramatic serpent horn was initially a much simpler instrument with a flared end, similar to the trumpet depicted on the left side of Pan, with a strap or ribbon hanging below it. Infrared imaging also reveals that the rightmost female once held a staff with an oval-shaped tip, perhaps a second thyrsus, that was modified to become a branch (Fig. 26 ).\n\nPentimentipentimento (pl: pentimenti): A change to the composition made by the artist that is visible on the paint surface. Often with time, pentimenti become more visible as the upper layers of paint become more transparent with age. Italian for \"repentance\" or \"a change of mind.\" reveal that Cupidâs quiver was originally placed along his proper left side (Fig. 27 ); two ribbons once hung from either side of the wreath above Silenusâ head; both feet of the rightmost bacchante clad in orange were initially higher, and rather than the âVâ shape visible today, her garment once curved across her proper right thigh. The pronounced curvature of the chariot wheel and dark foreground colors are visible beneath the lower left putto (Fig. 28 ) and overturned pitcher, indicating that these elements were introduced at a later stage of painting without the use of a reserve.26The authors are grateful to Helen Glanville who observed that the vase was painted on top of the dark foreground during a joint examination of Bacchus in 2014. Numerous minor areas of repositioning or adjustment are evident among the drapery and figures. The pentimento of a tree branch on the center left appears to have been misinterpreted and strengthened with retouchingretouching: Paint application by a conservator or restorer to cover losses and unify the original composition. Retouching is an aspect of conservation treatment that is aesthetic in nature and that differs from more limited procedures undertaken solely to stabilize original material. Sometimes referred to as inpainting or retouch. (now discolored); the branch does not appear to have been visible early on, as it was excluded from the copy of The Triumph of Bacchus (pre 1800; Victoria and Albert Museum).27The authors thank Ana Debenedetti, assistant curator, paintings and drawings, for information related to their copy of The Triumph of Bacchus (pre-1800; The Victoria and Albert Museum, London).\n\nPoussinâs Choice of Pigments\n\nAt the first level of scrutiny, the palette study entailed identifying which pigments were used and which were excluded from among those available to Poussin in the early seventeenth century. At a deeper level, we wished to know the roles played by the pigments in their different combinations and to learn, where possible, how those roles have changed due to aging effects, altering the paintingâs appearance. As shown below, iron earth pigments (naturally-occurring mineral mixtures in which iron plays a critical role in the color) are used in abundance throughout all of the paints. In addition, the iron earths used by Poussin in Bacchus are extremely diverse in both color and mineral type. When these complex mixtures are blended with each other, and diluted by lead whitelead white: The most widely used white pigment from Roman times until well into the industrial period, it consists of cerussite and/or hydrocerussite, mineral names for neutral lead carbonate and basic lead carbonate, respectively. Plumbonacrite, another basic lead carbonate with proportionately less carbonate than hydrocerussite, can sometimes be found, as well. The whitest forms used in painting were historically produced by inducing lead metal to corrode in the presence of vinegar fumes., their identification and understanding the roles they play in the appearance of the painting become extremely challenging.\n\nThere is an additional challenging aspect to the study of Poussinâs palette created by his deeply philosophical approach to painting.28An approach that was not always attuned to his patronâs expectations; see Helen Glanville, âAspect and ProspectâPoussinâs Triumph of Silenus,â Artibus et Historiae 37 (74) (2016): 241â54. In keeping with the debates of his peers and early modern attempts to create a framework of thought uniting perspective, atmospheric/optical effects, and material properties with humankindâs relationship to nature and the cosmos, he is thought to have incorporated small amounts of certain pigments for reasons unconnected with their practical performance in the paint.29H. Glanville, H. RousseliÃ¨re, L. De Viguerie, and Ph. Walter, âMens Agitat Molem: New Insights into Nicolas Poussinâs Painting Technique by X-ray Diffraction and Fluorescence Analyses,â in Science and Art: The Painted Surface, ed. Antonio Sgamellotti, Brunetto Giovanni Brunetti, and Costanza Miliani (London: The Royal Society of Chemistry, 2014), 314â35. In short, we do not know in some cases whether small additions of material with a limited influence on appearance were purposeful or not. Poussin may have included small amounts of certain pigments because they âbelongedâ there, in his worldview, whether they had a practical impact or not.\n\nThe distinctive traits of Poussinâs work lie in the idiosyncrasies of his use of otherwise common materials. In some cases, these may reflect an underlying procedural philosophy unique to Poussin. It is in the identification of variants among similar materials available in his day, combinations used for his specific effects, and changes wrought on those materials by his preparation procedures, that one could expect to discover new characteristics of the artistâs use of materials.\n\nTo obtain the most concise information possible about highly dispersed individual pigment grains, a heavy reliance has been placed upon elemental analysis of individual pigment particles using electron beam-excited x-ray spectrometryelectron-beam-excited X-ray spectrometry (sometimes referred to as XES for âX-ray energy spectrometryâ or EDX for âenergy-dispersive X-ray spectrometryâ): An analytical technique used for the identification of elements without regard to their state of combination. The underlying principle of X-ray spectrometry is the same as that of X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF): individual elements can be induced to emit unique identifying X-rays. When used during examination of a sample in the scanning electron microscope (SEM), it offers several profound advantages over in-situ analysis with the handheld unit or XRF elemental mapping spectrometer. Electron beam excitation in the SEM favors the response of light elements including even carbon and oxygen. Also, the extreme localization of the electron beam exciting the response allows individual pigment particles to be analyzed in complicated mixtures while simultaneously revealing particle shapes. For example, the presence of both lead and chromium in a single rod-like particle differentiates it as chrome yellow from the case of viridian merely mixed with lead white, where chromium (oxide) and lead (carbonate) occur in separate particles. in the scanning electron microscope (SEM)scanning electron microscopy (SEM): Performed on a microsample of paint, the SEM provides a means of studying particle shapes beyond the magnification limits of the light microscope. This becomes increasingly important with the painting materials introduced in the early modern era, which are finer and more diverse than traditional artistsâ materials. The SEM is routinely used in conjunction with an X-ray spectrometer, so that elemental identifications can be made selectively on the same minute scale as the electron beam producing the images. SEM methods are particularly valuable in studying unstable pigments, adverse interactions between incompatible pigments, and interactions between pigments and surrounding paint medium, all of which can have profound effects on the appearance of a painting., and the correlation of these results to optical properties and RamanRaman spectroscopy: A microanalytical technique applicable primarily to pigments and minerals, differentiating them based on both chemical bonding and crystal structure, often with extremely high sensitivity for individual particles. For example, traditional indigo and synthetic phthalocyanine blue are both carbon compounds not well differentiated by other methods utilized here, especially when used dilutely. However, they give unique Raman spectra. Calcium carbonates derived from chalk or pulverized oyster shell of identical chemical compositions can be differentiated based on their crystal structures (calcite and aragonite, respectively). spectra.30Samples were prepared in two ways: as embedded cross sections and as fracture sections presented to the instrument without further preparation, apart from a conductive coating of evaporated carbon. Cross-comparisons have been made with optical microscopy and UV fluorescence microscopy, with a few confirmatory identifications carried out by Raman spectroscopy. Polarized light microscopy (PLM) has then been used to correlate differences in color and optical properties with individual pigment species. PLM has been especially important in disclosing differences among the green iron earths which share overlapping elemental compositions. The formal cross sections often provide a clearer view of the sequence of paint applications, while the fracture fragments often reveal pigment alteration and texture features more clearly. As others have noted, the dry, fresco-like appearance favored by Poussin often entailed using paints with a slight deficit of oil medium, resulting in samples that can be brittle and difficult to prepare for analysis. Pigments identified in the ground and paint layers are shown in Table 1 .\n\nConstruction and Materials of the Double Ground\n\nThe colored ground plays an important visual role in the painting by influencing the tonality of overlying paints, some of which were never entirely opaque and which have become less so as a result of aging. The visible role of the ground is especially notable in setting the base color in the shadows of the river godâs green drapery (Fig. 29 ). Aging effects in the ground strata, therefore, have an impact on ways in which the present-day appearance of the painting differs from when it left the studio. Knowing that the ground played a visual role under certain colors, and that this role might have needed to be suppressed or modified under others, we sought to locate intermediate paint applications such as washes or underpainting layers. Several cross sections contain the ground layers while others were taken exclusively to characterize the overlying paint.\n\nPrior investigators studying numbers of works by Poussin have taken an approach distinct from ours by quantifying the average major element concentrations in their grounds using electron-beam-excited X-ray spectrometry performed in the scanning electron microscope. Alain Duval included nine works by Poussin that he presented in this context of broader seventeenth- and eighteenth-century painting practice.31A. Duval, âLes prÃ©parations colorÃ©es des tableaux de lâÃcole FranÃ§aise des dix-septiÃ¨me et dix-huitiÃ¨me siÃ¨cles,â Studies in Conservation 37 (1992): 239â58. By working from cross sections, he bypassed complicating factors that are inherent to non-sampling methods for the analysis of superimposed layers, methodology that, in any case, was in its infancy at that time. However, a series of assumptions about how to allocate the responses for individual elements are required in his approach. For example, lead can exist in particulate form as lead white or red lead pigments and simultaneously as lead dissolved in the medium where it functions as a drier, or siccative, for oil.32Duval commented upon the difficulty of distinguishing fine-grained red lead when its color cannot be distinguished from other reds in a colored ground mixture. Our own tests have confirmed the use of fine red lead as a minor component of the grounds in Bacchus and the attendant difficulty of locating it.\n\nIn a subsequent paper, Duval presented the results of this experimental protocol for the grounds of 26 works by Poussin.33A. Duval, âLes enduits de prÃ©paration des tableaux de Nicolas Poussin,â TechnÃ© 1 (1994): 35â41. He classified the ground layers into three types based on color and dominant elemental composition. He defined these classes as ferrugineous soils, ochres, and iron oxides, based upon their proportions of alumina, silica, and iron. With a single painting and no direct access to that body of data, our approach has been descriptive, rather than classifying, and focused on the individual constituents of the ground. In addition, we have observed that some constituents of the ground also play important roles in the upper paint layers. It should be borne in mind that a dark ground layer may contain the sediment collected from washing brushes whose color is overwhelmed by the dark earth minerals. In that case, minor amounts of costly or specialized pigments may not be indicative of purposeful additions to the ground.\n\nThe lower, ruddy ground in Bacchus is comprised mostly of earth pigments with a low content of lead white (Fig. 8 ).34Pigment species confirmed in the lower, dark ground include quartz, sodium feldspar, fine hematite (red ochre) and goethite (yellow ochre), ferrous silica, light green iron earth with undulose optical extinction, iron-magnesium aluminosilicates (green earth), and discolored medium with minor cinnabar, red lead, calcium carbonate, lead white, lead soap alteration products, potassium clay or mica, red lake on alumina, gypsum, bone black, and chromite traces. One example of a large red agglomerate containing calcium-potassium sulfate along with iron oxides points to a possible origin for the iron earth in a jarosite (potassium iron sulfate) formation. The upper beige ground consists of lead white tinted by yellow, orange, red, and black pigments, including several forms of hydrated iron oxides, and traces of vermilion, red lead, and charcoal.35Pigment species confirmed in the upper beige ground through SEM elemental analysis include lead white, quartz (some of it splintered and unworn), potassium feldspar, sodium feldspar, sodium-potassium feldspar, coarse hydrated iron oxide, ferrous silica grains, lead soap alteration products, calcite, very fine goethite (yellow ochre), and minor amounts of coarse red lake, clay, cinnabar, charcoal, and more rarely, ultramarine, gypsum, and potassium-calcium sulfate. Lead white pigment particles in the beige ground vary markedly in shape, size, and crystal forms. Their size variation is extreme, ranging from less than one micron to over 50 microns in diameter. Among the coarse lead white grains there are both agglomerates of fine crystals and coarse, splintery fragments of individual crystals intermingled with finely-ground and highly-dispersed ones. Recent research has shown that lead white in these differing size ranges has often been refined by differing procedures, with the finest grades resulting from washing and levigation, leading to different proportions of its two main compounds: cerussite and hydrocerussite.36V. Gonzalez, G. Wallez, T. Calligaro, M. Cotte, W. De Nolf, and M. Eveno, âSynchrotron-based high angle resolution and high lateral resolution X-ray diffraction: Revealing lead white pigment qualities in old masters paintings,â Analytical Chemistry 89 no. 24 (2017): 13203â11.\n\nIn Bacchus, coarse grains that have not undergone refinement include internal microstructures retained from their âDutchâ production process of corroding lead plates with acetic acid vapor. Some grains with large internal subdivisions appear more translucent than their neighbors of similar size when those neighbors consist of fine interlocking grains or compact agglomerates of unconnected particles. Raman spectroscopy carried out on coarser grains in the ground and paints revealed that they fall into two distinct classes with different Raman spectra (Fig. 30 ) corresponding to cerussite and hydrocerussite that has been transformed from plumbonacrite during its production.37Raman spectra of these two coarse-grained classes, which occur throughout the painting, fall cleanly into categories correlating closely to reference standards for cerussite and hydrocerrusite in the RRUFF database as shown on the right of Figure 30. RRUFF id #s R040069 and R070059, respectively, https://rruff.info/about/about_general.php (accessed 9-18-21). B. Lafuente , R.T. Downs, H. Yang, and N. Stone, âThe power of databases: the RRUFF project,â in Highlights in Mineralogical Crystallography, ed. T. Armbruster and R. M. Danisi (Berlin: W. De Gruyter, 2015), 1â30. The hydrocerussite that matches most closely differs from other natural history specimens in the RRUFF compilation in being a pseudomorph after plumbonacrite. Recent work on details of the Dutch process for lead white production show that plumbonacrite is usually a short-lived intermediate that transforms to hydrocerussite in the final product, accounting for this distinction in the pigment. Therefore, it appears that lead whites of differing coarseness and qualities, some refined more than others, were intentionally combined with an objective that remains obscure today.\n\nConstruction and Materials of the Blue Robe\n\nBrightly colored garments needed to be free of influence from the color of the beige upper ground and usually employ an intermediate layer. For the blue robe of the rightmost bacchante, this entailed the use of charcoal to create a more neutral base for this semi-transparent color. Five cross sections near the right side of the painting demonstrate that the blue-draped bacchante was left in reserve when the brown background was painted. The blue is underlain by a layer consisting mostly of coarse charcoal in lead white, whose thickness varies in response to the depth of blue color required at that point. The charcoal underlayer dominates the appearance of the robe in the infrared reflectogram, showing variations in its application (Fig. 21 ). The wide distribution in size of lead white grains seen in the upper ground is also characteristic of lead white in the black underlayer paint.\n\nTesting revealed this preliminary application to be a thick black coat of charcoal and lead white with traces of lead-tin yellow and iron oxide. Traces of umber in its thickest shadow applications include coarse examples of deep brown manganese oxides (Fig. 31 ). The blue robe itself is based on lead white with ultramarine. A thin surface deposit of grayed calcium carbonate and gypsum impacts its appearance. Outside the shadow, the preliminary application contains more lead white than charcoal, followed by a top layer of lead white and ultramarine containing traces of vermilion and red ochre. The natural ultramarine of the top layer is mixed with lead white of uniformly fine particle size in accordance with the depth of color required, with some areas containing virtually pure ultramarine.\n\nConstruction and Materials of the Peach Scarf\n\nBright glazes are evident in the shadows of the drapery and important for the peach-colored scarf swirling around the left arm of the rightmost bacchante. Unlike the blue garment, the scarf was painted over the brown background rather than left in reserve. It owes its color primarily to a yellow lake pigment prepared on a base of alumina and contains a high proportion of non-particulate lead in the medium, with few, and widely-dispersed, fine grains of lead white. The construction of the scarf near the shoulder entailed a yellow-brown underlayer of lead-tin yellow particles whose lead and tin proportions vary greatly, containing lead soap and lead chloride alteration products, cinnabar, lead white, alumina lake, and iron oxides. Uppermost is a yellow-brown layer containing yellow lake on alumina with a thin alteration layer of lead sulfate and lead potassium sulfate. The scarf has been thinned by abrasionabrasion: A loss of surface material due to rubbing, scraping, frequent touching, or inexpert solvent cleaning. and prior cleanings so that these alteration products, typically consisting of anglesite and palmierite, can be inferred to have developed subsequent to some prior cleaning. These species are widely encountered on painted surfaces, formed from the interaction of lead, sulfate, and potassium ions.38A. van Loon, P. Noble, and J. J.

The surface layer affects the scarf as a whole and is related to the formulation of the lake-rich top layer, which tests have shown contains some residual sulfate in the lake pigment. The layer also contains some small nodules of lead soaps that are the product of free fatty acids in the oil medium interacting with lead pigment. The construction of the scarf near the left hand entails three layers atop the brown background (Fig. 32 ). The brown background paint is rich in iron earths with calcite, lead white, and bone black. A thin, uneven application of coarse yellow lake with small amounts of iron oxides and lead-tin yellow forms the first layer of the scarf at this point. It was followed by paint rich in both green and orange iron earths, iron oxides, yellow lake, and relatively little lead white. The topmost layer is a glazeglaze: A transparent, oil or resin-rich paint application that influences the tonality of the underlying paint. containing yellow lake. The use of some coarse green earth in the middle stratum of the scarf is not obvious from its final color.\n\nConstruction and Materials of the Yellow-Orange Robe\n\nThe bright yellow-orange robe of the bacchante bearing the serpent on a staff was studied in two locations. The shoulder highlight was tested alone, and a sample of the flesh paint from below the raised hem that included the first version of the robe was studied stratigraphically. The first layer in the sample belongs to the skin beneath the former position of the robe, suggesting that like the river god and rightmost bacchante, the nude figure was painted and then draped. (The skin tones are discussed below.) The second stratum consists of the robe prior to the artistâs modifications of the hem. It consists of a single layer containing lead white, pale lead-tin yellow deficient in tin, and orange ferrous silica grains that are an essential part of many paints in Bacchus (Fig. 33 ). The highlights applied over this layer at the shoulder consist of lead-tin yellow type I.41Prior to, and during Poussinâs lifetime, lead-tin yellow was produced in two forms by calcining lead and tin oxides alone (designated Type I) and as a glassy material incorporating silica (Type II). Only type I occurs in Bacchus. During his career, the lead-antimony compound known as Naples yellow was beginning to replace the two varieties of lead-tin yellow, and Poussin employed it in some other works. However, Naples yellow was never encountered in Bacchus, either as a yellow pigment in its own right nor as a tinting pigment in mixtures.\n\nConstruction and Materials of the Flesh Tones\n\nFlesh tones vary from the ruddy color of earthbound figures such as Pan and the trumpeter to the flushed, lifelike tones of the bacchantes and the highly luminous skin of Bacchus who, in the humanist circles to which both Poussin and Richelieu belonged, could be associated with Christ and Apollo, patron of the arts.42Helen Glanville, personal communication, September 23, 2021. Some flesh tones were constructed using the ground color as a base on which to apply highlights and shadows. For figures whose modeling is more gradual and subtle, an opaque color was mixed to be a skin midtone and then shaded with washes. While the skin tones represent some of the most fluid and uniform of the paints, they contain relatively large particles of brightly-colored pigments not quite visible at normal viewing distances. These include vermilion and ultramarine particles, large agglomerates of fine lead-tin yellow, and large green earth particles in both pale and deep green shades, as required to suggest the translucency of skin over musculature, without actually using a translucent paint (Fig. 34 ).43In addition to the coarse species identifiable on the top surface, polarized light microscopy of the pale flesh shows it to be preponderantly lead white colored by the same isotropic orange ferrous silica species widely employed throughout this painting, traces of fine charcoal, and fine vermilion. Shadows often employ thin, transparent applications of charcoal and additional vermilion.\n\nTwo skin samples from the yellow-robed, serpent-bearing bacchante were taken for comparison with that of Bacchus. The highlight flesh color of her thigh was sampled at the location previously described where the artist raised the hem by extending the paint of the thigh. The skin from the first position of the yellow-robed bacchanteâs leg is represented by only a few grains in the sample, including lead white colored by lead-tin yellow, orange and deep-red ferrous silica grains (more fully described below) and small amounts of vermilion and red lead. Quartz and a coarse example of potash-soda-lime-silica glass were also found (Fig. 33 ). This glass was differentiated from mineral silicates by its distinctive Raman spectrum. The various types and uses of powdered glass in painting have been described by Lutzenberger, et al.44K. Lutzenberger, H. Stege, and C. Tilenschi, âA note on glass and silica in oil paintings from the 15th to the 17th century,â Journal of Cultural Heritage 11 (2010): 365â72. It may play a role in increasing the translucency of the skin color here. The final application of skin color is mostly lead white with greatly varying particle sizes, colored by lead-tin yellow, charcoal, natural ultramarine, yellow ochre, and traces of red ochre. It seems that the flesh color of this figure employs more lead-tin yellow to compensate for the intensity of the adjacent yellow robe and thereby maintain an optically harmonious overall appearance.\n\nA darker, redder shade at the knee below this revision contains two, and possibly three layers, atop the beige ground. The first is a thin underlayer of orange comprised of vermilion in widely ranging particle sizes and a yellow iron earth. This is followed by a pink mixture based on lead white containing vermilion, with traces of ultramarine and umber. The deeper color of her knee relative to the skin of her lower leg employed an overlying wash containing very fine red ochre and yellow lake. Both flesh shades from this bacchante contain recognizable coarse particles of green earth in their surfaces, like those visible on the figure of Bacchus.\n\nA cross section of the skin from Bacchusâs right arm at the transition to the elbow shadow shows that the flesh was painted directly atop the upper beige ground. The cross section contains two subtly different skin layers, probably applied wet-over-wet, atop the upper ground. The lower of these is about 18 microns in thickness and the upper about 12 microns (Fig. 30 ). By comparison with the skin of the yellow-robed bacchante, the proportion of vermilion is higher in both layers. The figure of Bacchus and his swirling vermilion cape are the most luminous areas of the infrared image and the visual focus of the painting. The vermilion of the skin is required for the skin tone to âreadâ properly against the vermilion cape, much as an increase in yellow is required for the skin tones of the bacchante offset by her yellow-orange robe. Both skin strata in Bacchusâ arm are very high in fine-grained lead white and each contains the orange ferrous silica. Traces of gypsum exist in the top layer and examples of yellow lake, calcite and ultramarine exist in the lower skin layer. Lead-tin yellow was not present in either layer at the point sampled from Bacchusâ arm but scattered agglomerates are visible in the paint surface nearby. Pigments adhering to a fragment of varnish from the elbow shadow transition show that the surface was darkened by a thin wash of charcoal grains and yellow ochre.\n\nThe role of quartz in light skin tones must be considered because fragments of this colorless mineral can occasionally be seen within the paint surface (Fig. 35 ). Unlike lead white and calcium carbonate, both of which are âcolorless,â widely-used white pigments, quartz cannot serve as a white pigment. Its proportion is never sufficient to imply that it was added to make the paint more translucent, but it is possible that by being used in coarse, splintered form it introduced some subtle, sparkling reflections. While quartz also occurs as a natural component of earth pigments in the ground and green paints, the luminous flesh tones lack these pigments. The quartz in these skin colors appears to have arrived independent of earth pigments, possibly as wear particles from grinding.45It cannot be excluded that some of the quartz originated as wear particles lost from stone implements used to grind the pigments. Sharp-edged fragments of colorless quartz and feldspar occur sporadically in the paints and both grounds but these are not typical of quartz in earth pigments, which are rounded by geological weathering and transport (detrital grains). It should not be surprising to encounter detrital grains of quartz and feldspar in the ruddy ground layer where earth pigments are prevalent, but quartz can often be found in layers where earth pigments are used very sparingly, such as the upper, beige ground. Sharp-edged fragments, unrounded by the wear typical of sedimentary minerals, are visible directly in the surface of the flesh paint used for Bacchus. Their lack of both rounding and staining by iron compounds suggest that these are not detrital sedimentary grains incorporated along with the earth pigments, implying some other source.\n\nConstruction and Materials of the Greens\n\nThe only green drapery in the composition is that of the reclining river god. It is very similar in both appearance and composition to the green used for foliage, as befits a deity associated with earthly properties. This region of the painting is the most fresco-like in its dry, textured appearance (Fig. 29 ). Green iron earth pigments were used along with additions of lead-tin yellow to produce these greens. Occasionally, ultramarine was incorporated to adjust the hue, but greens always incorporate intrinsically green pigments rather than a mixture of blue and yellow pigments. No copper-based green pigments were employed in The Triumph of Bacchus. All greens are derived from green earths or combinations of green earth and yellow. Magnified observation of the paint layer reveals large differences of particle size and color among the green pigments that have been related to elemental composition, optical behavior, and transmitted light color during testing.\n\nFive samples were studied that included green paints. In addition to the shadow green from the robe of the river god these include: the upper leaves of the sapling projecting from the hill near the right edge; foliage barely above the top of the same hill; the sparse tree standing against the orange sky beneath Apollo; and a leaf in the wreath of the rightmost bacchante. All of the greens incorporate small amounts of lead-tin yellow type I. The greens tend to be drab in this painting, verging on brown, as a consequence of the use of yellow and brown iron earth pigments in combination with lead-tin yellow and green earth. Therefore, the brown coloration of much of the foliage is purposeful and not a consequence of the decomposition of green pigments based upon copper compounds, nor of the graying of smalt, pigments that do not occur in this painting.\n\nA cross section of the river godâs shadow drapery confirms that the green is a thin, semi-transparent layer of green earth applied directly atop the beige upper ground layer which remains visible through it. The composition of the layer as a whole is nearly identical to that of the individual green earth pigment particles that it contains, with only a little lead white to aid drying of the paint and no lead-tin yellow or iron oxides to adjust its color. Rounded grains of green earth up to the size of sand particles (20 microns) provide the color.\n\nThe leaves of the sapling were painted atop two, wet-over-wet layers of the cloudy sky. Unlike the green drapery shadow, the leaf paint has been rendered opaque with a ten-fold increase in fine lead white, and includes orange ferrous silica grains, fine lead-tin yellow, and traces of vermilion in addition to the coarse green earth. The lead-tin yellow grains range widely in composition from ones deficient in tin to ones with a large excess of tin relative to their lead content.\n\nThe leaves just above the hill were painted over a similar wet-over-wet, two layer sky but these were applied on top of a dark brown layer rather than directly over the beige ground. The dark layer beneath the sky is the trunk of a tree eliminated by the artist from the early composition. This green mixture is also opacified with lead white, but contains more of the orange ferrous silica. The lead-tin yellow here contains multiple examples of unreacted tin oxide left over from the preparation of the pigment.\n\nThe green of the sparse tree beneath Apollo lies atop a rosy hued sky. The paint of the sky here is a single thin layer (about 10 microns thick) over the beige ground that sets its underlying tone. The green of the foliage is much thicker than the sky at the location sampled (about 30 microns). Its lead content is intermediate between the two previous examples and much of it is present in the form of fine lead-tin yellow and non-particulate lead dissolved in the paint medium. Orange ferrous silica is an important part of the mixture and conspicuous white grains of unreacted tin oxide are associated with its lead-tin yellow. Particles of this green mixture adhering to a fragment of varnish in the sample provide views of their varied optical behavior in the polarizing microscope (Fig. 36 C, D, & G).\n\nOnly the uppermost leaf green was sampled from the head wreath, and it contains the same group of pigments. Their examination in the polarizing microscope provided some insight into the great variety of iron earth variations that elemental analysis alone does not disclose. In Fig. 36 A, examples of the isotropic orange ferrous silica and lead-tin yellow are present, along with âgreenâ earth minerals ranging in color from yellow to green to aquamarine, some of them highly birefringent and others isotropic, some fibrous, and others fine-grained and platey.\n\nTwo cross sections from areas where trees were covered by Poussinâs revisions to the sky on the right (described above) provided additional indications of the complexity of the earth pigments. The overpainted trunks of the trees had originally been left in reserve, painted atop the upper beige ground rather than over the colors of the sky, using a very dark brown mixture. The mixture of the overpainted tree trunk is very high in earth pigments, including green earth (Fig. 36 B) and the orange ferrous silica widely used throughout the painting. It is low in lead content, with only small, isolated particles of lead white.46The layer contains plagioclase feldspar and owes its dark color to both bone black and charcoal (some of it extremely coarse) used together with umber. Bone black was not found alone as a black pigment in Bacchus. For example, it was not encountered in the black that was used as an underlayer for blue. It occurs elsewhere in mixtures of darker browns and in small amounts in the first ground. Green earth is also a component of both grounds (Fig. 36 E&F).\n\nAll green earths owe their color to iron but individual examples vary widely in their mineral contents.47C.A. Grissom, âGreen Earth,â in Artistsâ Pigment: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, ed. R.L. Feller (Oxford: Oxford University Press for the National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1986), 1:141â67. Elemental compositions averaged over green layer cross sections show that both magnesium and potassium were systematically present along with the requisite iron, silica, and alumina. However, by conducting elemental analyses on individual grains, two compositional classes were found to be present, one of which contains potassium iron silicate with very little magnesium, and another in which magnesium is prevalent and potassium diminished. In cross sections where the colors of large individual grains were apparent, their color often differed in accordance with these compositional differences.\n\nAdditional distinctions were found when optical properties visible in polarized light microscopypolarized light microscopy (PLM): A method used for the study and differentiation of pigments based on the optical properties of individual particles, including color, refractive index, birefringence, etc. PLM is particularly useful in identifying the presence of organic pigments such as indigo and Prussian blue, which often cannot be differentiated from paint medium in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM); differentiating synthetic pigments from their natural analogs by particle shape or the presence of extraneous mineral matter; and disclosing the presence of pigments with similar composition but differing color, such as red and yellow iron oxides. were examined. Rounded grains of three distinct green earth types can be found, each with its own color, internal crystal structure, and degree of birefringence (Fig. 36 A). Another green earth, with deeper green saturation, stronger pleochroism, and occasional splintery morphology, occurs in other samples (Fig. 36 B).\n\nDistinctive Individual Characteristics of Poussinâs Palette\n\nThe condition, composition, and particle size of lead-tin yellow in The Triumph of Bacchus is highly variable, with many coarse particles consisting of sintered, porous agglomerates (Fig. 33 ). The proportions of lead to tin vary between the extremes of pure tin oxide to nearly pure lead oxide, with color variations ranging from nearly white to the more typical lemon yellow.48Because lead soap formations are sometimes evident within and adjacent to the agglomerates, it is not possible to rule out a role for extraction of lead from the lead-tin yellow pigment agglomerates by free fatty acids in the paint medium as cause of their condition. Lead soap formations are present, but do not visually affect the painting in large numbers. Dramatic eruptive or laminated growth structures consisting of lead fatty acid soaps such as those illustrated by Higgitt et al. were not encountered in this painting. Others working on older paintings from the fifteenth century have found red lead oxide within lead-tin yellow type I agglomerates and have speculated that this represents unreacted residual lead from the starting materials. The uptake of this uncombined lead oxide to form lead-fatty acid soaps inside the agglomerates represents an easier path to their formation than a mechanism requiring the breakdown of the lead-tin yellow compound as a prerequisite to soap formations. Red lead oxide was not observed within the agglomerates in Bacchus in either optical or electron microscopy, nor was it detected there by Raman spectroscopy. See Catherine Higgitt, Marika Spring, and David Saunders, âPigment-medium Interactions in Oil Paint Films containing Red Lead or Lead-tin Yellow,â National Gallery Technical Bulletin 24 (2003): 75â95. The greatly varying proportions of lead to tin that were found seem certainly to be due to unreacted starting materials. The prevalence of non-particulate lead in cases that appear deficient in tin can be explained by the subsequent formation of lead soaps from unreacted lead starting materials.49J. Boon, E. Gore, K. Keune, and A. Burnstock, âImage Analytical Studies of Lead Soap Aggregates and Their Relationship to Lead and Tin in 15th-Century Lead-tin Yellow Paints from the Sherborne Triptych,â The Sixth Infrared and Raman Users Group Conference-IRUG6, (Florence, 29 Marchâ1 April 2004), ed. M. Picollo (Padova: Il Prato, 2005), 66â74.\n\nOne of the principal ingredients of the paints and of both grounds, occurring in virtually every paint mixture, is an orange iron earth component that is unusual in several respects and which we have not encountered so widely employed in the work of other painters. It has a well-defined and simple composition yet does not correspond to a specific mineral speciesmineral species: A non-living, homogeneous substance found in nature, classified by the proportions of the elements that it contains and the arrangement of those elements in a crystal lattice. When determined to be a singular entity, or phase, as opposed to a mixture of different entities, it is given an internationally agreed-upon species name (often ending in -ite). Pigments and alteration products of artistâs materials that form with the same composition and structure as their natural analogs are often identified by the mineral species name. Substances with widely varying compositions that do not take on a crystalline structure are often glasses, a state of matter that accommodates a higher degree of randomness in the linkages between its atoms.. Though never used alone, it often occurs in the absence of other iron earth minerals (such as clay or green earth), indicating that it is not a species introduced as part of a natural mixture. Energy dispersive X-ray spectra of dozens of individual grains from all paints in which it occurs demonstrate that it contains iron and silica in varying proportions and lacks aluminum. A small response for phosphorus is present in many examples (Fig. 30 ). The grains on which the most accurate individual SEM analyses can be conducted are coarse, bright orange, and rounded, though the same composition can be found in smaller sizes where neighboring pigments contribute to the elements detected. The absence of aluminum indicates that they do not contain clay, nor any other form of aluminosilicate mineral. Our designation of them as âferrous silicaâ acknowledges that there are no recognized mineral species that consist solely of silica and iron oxides or hydroxides.50The undetected presence of any light elements outside the range of our analysis methods would not suffice to identify the grains as any other known mineral type. Furthermore, the oxides of iron and silicon alone do not form a glass, suggesting that these grains are not a manmade furnace product. One of the most common materials capable of yielding such an analytical result would be an intimate combination of separate minerals in the form of detrital (rounded) quartz particles bearing hydrated iron oxide coatings, a type of sedimentary grainsedimentary grain: A mineral grain, or rock fragment containing several mineral grains, liberated by the weathering of solid rock formations. They are typically wear-rounded as they are carried by wind or water. Garden soil is generally comprised of sedimentary grains along with finer matter such as clay and organic matter. Earth pigments often contain sedimentary grains but some consist of minerals mined in-situ, where they formed. abundant in many geological environments. However, the isotropic or very weakly birefringent optical behavior of these grains demonstrates that they are not typical detrital quartz. Furthermore, they do not possess iron coatings that are resolvable by either optical or scanning electron microscopy at magnifications where coated detrital grains are easily recognizable. Unlike coated grains, their color appears uniform through the interior when larger examples are transected in cross sections. The SEM often shows faint texture across the interior, with minimal atomic weight contrast, suggesting that the grains consist of an intimate mixture of the iron and silica on a scale too fine to resolve in the SEM.\n\nCondition and Implications of Poussinâs Choices of Materials\n\nPigments identified in the ground and paint layers are shown in Table 1. Several materials commonly in use in the seventeenth century that are conspicuous by their absence have important ramifications for the present-day appearance of the painting. Copper compounds such as azurite and malachite, their synthetic analogs blue and green verditer, the blue-green pigment verdigris (neutral or basic copper acetate), and the green copper-organic compound known as copper-resinate, are all absent. In varying degrees, all of these copper compounds create vulnerabilities in a painting due to their propensities to darken or adversely interact with other pigments. Poussin made use of the more stable of these, such as azurite, in other works, but their complete avoidance here eliminates several pathways for color degradation. When we see brown foliage in Bacchus, it is not a consequence of a deteriorated green copper pigment.\n\nSmalt was another blue pigment widely used in the period that Poussin chose not to employ for Bacchus, though he used it in certain other works. Smalt is a blue glass whose color is contributed by a very small percentage of cobalt. Decomposition of the glass commonly leads to graying of the color of smaltâalso avoided by its exclusion from this palette.\n\nThe yellow pigment orpiment (natural arsenic sulfide) is also absent, though Poussin used it for yellow highlights in certain other works. Orpiment can undergo several forms of autonomous alteration, including oxidation accompanied by a loss of color, and may adversely interact with other pigments to promote darkening through the formation of sulfides. These were also avoided in Bacchus.\n\nBacchus contains two lake pigments in red and yellow whose transparency assists in creating rich glaze colors. They also occur in small amounts in other paints and the ground layers. The organic dyes responsible for their colors remain unfaded but have not been identified. Both were prepared on a base of alumina derived from alum. Residual salts from the alum can be a factor in paint alteration and, indeed, there are examples both of residual sulfate in some of the lake particles and of their reaction products with lead inside the paint layers and in obscuring surface deposits.\n\nThe sole blue pigment found in Bacchus is ultramarine, the most-costly of the blue pigments of his day, which was refined from lapis lazulilapis lazuli: A rock containing several minerals, including the brilliant blue lazurite, along with calcite, diopside, and iron pyrite, among others. Obtained by trade along the Silk Route, natural ultramarine was produced by a laborious and costly process of grinding and separating the blue lazurite from the unwanted minerals. The intensity of its color depends on not being ground too finely while freeing it of colorless matter, two objectives that were difficult to meet simultaneously, resulting different grades. A means of making synthetic ultramarine was discovered in the 19th century, making it cheaply available in large quantities and virtually eliminating demand for the natural variety. usually procured from Afghanistan, its only old-world source. It was available in varying qualities and degrees of color saturation and that variation is apparent in different locations in the painting. Some occurrences employ deep blue grains while other areas have abundant pale examples. Areas painted primarily with ultramarine can undergo a loss of color saturation that is visually similar to the lightening effect of a blanchedblanching: A whitish haze or discoloration that may indicate deterioration of a varnish layer or an alteration of the paint film caused by inappropriate cleaning. varnish, but uncorrectable through revarnishing. On the other hand, most instances of color change in the blues of Bacchus are the result of overlying deteriorated varnish residues, which can be addressed with cleaning.\n\nEarly documentation confirms that Bacchus was cleaned by Marcel Rougeron prior to its 1931 acquisition.51Letter from Harold Woodbury Parsons, Nelson-Atkins art advisor, to J.C. Nichols, Nelson-Atkins trustee, December 11, 1931, Nelson-Atkins curatorial files. The current wax-lining and modern stretcher verify that a subsequent treatment occurred sometime between 1940 and 1973,52Conservation records are incomplete from 1931 and 1973, but the wax-lining technique and replacement stretcher are consistent with treatments and materials from this period. and in 1981 a synthetic varnish was applied to resaturate the colors of the painting.53Forrest R. Bailey, March 3, 1981, examination report, Nelson-Atkins conservation file, no. 31-94. In the past, scholars expressed reluctance about the authenticity of Bacchus, frequently citing (and in some cases overstating) condition problems. While there is some subtle paint abrasion present, for example throughout the right sky, and disruptions to the gradual transitions of light and shadow on the lower left putto and river godâs back,54Condition is an important factor in discussions of attribution, as both figures were described in the literature as being less successful passages. See Hilary Balon, âFrom Eminences to Entrepreneurs,â in Richelieu: Art and Power, ed. Hilliard Todd Goldfarb, exh. cat. (Montreal: Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, 2002), 194. the painting has not been drastically overcleaned or âbrutally treated.â55Jacques Thuillier, Nicolas Poussin (Paris: Flammarion, 1994), 254. Translation by Nicole R. Myers. The putto is also affected by an increased transparency of the paint, which has caused dark underlying layers to become more prominent over time (Fig. 28 ). The discolored layers of synthetic varnish produce an overall gray tonality that diminishes Poussinâs original colors. Additionally, a faint cleaning line is apparent in the upper left sky, leaving the left side slightly brighter than the right, and residues of yellowed natural resin varnish disrupt the folds of blue drapery (central and rightmost bacchantes) and produce a blanched appearance across the right foreground. A small amount of discolored retouching is scattered throughout, and fill materialfill material: A material added to a loss of paint and/or ground to create an area level with the surrounding original paint. and retouching are present on all four outermost edges.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nThe results of the palette study clarify the limited number of alteration phenomena that affect the appearance of Bacchus and rule out many forms of damage commonly encountered in paintings of the period, suggesting that cleaning and revarnishing alone would result in a significant improvement in appearance. The extent of prior restorations is small and instances where existing restorations negatively impact the appearance are very few.\n\nIn characterizing the palette and ways in which Poussin employed his materials, we have attempted to illustrate the selections that he made from those available to a painter of his stature and time, placing an equal emphasis on those that he omitted and potential pitfalls thereby avoided. We have also emphasized idiosyncrasies of the materials that could serve as useful comparisons to the materials used in the other works of the Richelieu commission, his wider oeuvre, and the work of his contemporaries. At the earliest stage of this study, the idea of a palette comparison between the three Richelieu bacchanals as a primary means of gauging their similarity and attributions was dismissed as being unworkable, in the short term at least, since the Nelson-Atkins collection holds only one work attributed to Poussin and because copies most likely to have been confused with his works are nearly contemporary in date and material sources. The remarkable success of the canvas weave match posed provocative questions about the criteria on which judgments against Bacchus and Silenus as original works by Poussin were based over much of the twentieth century. However, it also changed the landscape regarding the value of palette comparisons. In light of the canvas linkage, everything that can be learned from the painting materials of all three bacchanals will more accurately reflect the spectrum of Poussinâs work. To that end, we look forward to cross comparisons of the results found here with Poussinâs work in other collections.\n\nMary Schafer and John Twilley\n\nApril 2021\n\nNotes\n\nPaul Jamot, âSur quelques tableaux de Poussin Ã propos de lâexposition du paysage franÃ§ais,â Bulletin de la SociÃ©tÃ© de lâhistoire de lâart franÃ§ais (1925): 103.

The resulting set of spacing measurements could then be shifted, thread by thread, away from the apparent best match in both directions, and the quality of match in the resulting trial alignments plotted. See Erdmann et al., âReuniting Poussinâs Bacchanals Painted for Cardinal Richelieu through Quantitative Canvas Weave Analysis,â 155â72.\n\nVan der Maaten employed a machine learning approach that made a full comparison of the canvases in both directions possible at the level of individual thread spacings. The twelve-thousand, manually- extracted, thread-crossing measurements along the guide threads used in validation of the previous match were used in training of the new algorithm. Incorporated into van der Maatenâs solution was a means for projecting the re-emergence points of individual threads that become locally obscured in the radiograph by heavy overlapping paint strokes, increasing the proportion of the canvas that could be included in difficult comparisons. This method eliminated reliance upon local averages of thread spacings and made full thread-by-thread comparisons possible. See L.J.P. van der Maaten and R.G.

Cross-comparisons have been made with optical microscopy and UV fluorescence microscopy, with a few confirmatory identifications carried out by Raman spectroscopy. Polarized light microscopy (PLM) has then been used to correlate differences in color and optical properties with individual pigment species. PLM has been especially important in disclosing differences among the green iron earths which share overlapping elemental compositions. The formal cross sections often provide a clearer view of the sequence of paint applications, while the fracture fragments often reveal pigment alteration and texture features more clearly. As others have noted, the dry, fresco-like appearance favored by Poussin often entailed using paints with a slight deficit of oil medium, resulting in samples that can be brittle and difficult to prepare for analysis.\n\nA.

Our own tests have confirmed the use of fine red lead as a minor component of the grounds in Bacchus and the attendant difficulty of locating it.\n\nA.

One example of a large red agglomerate containing calcium-potassium sulfate along with iron oxides points to a possible origin for the iron earth in a jarosite (potassium iron sulfate) formation.\n\nPigment species confirmed in the upper beige ground through SEM elemental analysis include lead white, quartz (some of it splintered and unworn), potassium feldspar, sodium feldspar, sodium-potassium feldspar, coarse hydrated iron oxide, ferrous silica grains, lead soap alteration products, calcite, very fine goethite (yellow ochre), and minor amounts of coarse red lake, clay, cinnabar, charcoal, and more rarely, ultramarine, gypsum, and potassium-calcium sulfate.\n\nV.

Stone, âThe power of databases: the RRUFF project,â in Highlights in Mineralogical Crystallography, ed. T. Armbruster and R. M. Danisi (Berlin: W. De Gruyter, 2015), 1â30. The hydrocerussite that matches most closely differs from other natural history specimens in the RRUFF compilation in being a pseudomorph after plumbonacrite. Recent work on details of the Dutch process for lead white production show that plumbonacrite is usually a short-lived intermediate that transforms to hydrocerussite in the final product, accounting for this distinction in the pigment.\n\nA. van Loon, P.

Only type I occurs in Bacchus. During his career, the lead-antimony compound known as Naples yellow was beginning to replace the two varieties of lead-tin yellow, and Poussin employed it in some other works. However, Naples yellow was never encountered in Bacchus, either as a yellow pigment in its own right nor as a tinting pigment in mixtures.\n\nHelen Glanville, personal communication, September 23, 2021.\n\nIn addition to the coarse species identifiable on the top surface, polarized light microscopy of the pale flesh shows it to be preponderantly lead white colored by the same isotropic orange ferrous silica species widely employed throughout this painting, traces of fine charcoal, and fine vermilion. Shadows often employ thin, transparent applications of charcoal and additional vermilion.\n\nK. Lutzenberger, H. Stege, and C. Tilenschi, âA note on glass a"
