Similarly, in history, generations of people have interacted with and responded to social, technological, and artistic movements and political and economic events. By studying the history of dance in an environment of arts, culture, and technology, we can see it from a multimedia perspective. The tools available in the 21st century allow teachers and students to create a multimedia environment that facilitates a visually, textually, and aurally integrated view of the history of dance.\n\nIn our technologically saturated era, the senses are bombarded with images, music, and movement. The ability to create a multimedia view of a period of history depends on technological capabilities and access to certain tools. Visual and auditory glimpses of various historical periods through the use of video clips of dance performances allow you to see history in a new context and thus draw new meanings from it. This book provides you with methods for perceiving, creating, responding, and connecting to the history of dance through integrated arts and technology.\n\nHistory of Dance, although written for dance history courses, also supports general education courses in the humanities and fine arts. As a study of prehistory to the present, the book focuses on dancers, dance, dance works and literature, and dance as an art form in the context of social studies, related arts, and technology. The interactive environment is supported by the national standards for education in dance, arts, social studies, and dance literature in the context of history, society, and culture. The introduction (Capturing Dance From the Past) outlines tools from dance and other arts and disciplines that will facilitate your studies within a perspective of history, related arts, and technology.\n\nThe following sections explain how each chapter has been designed to help you learn the history of dance.\n\n9\n\nGlance at the Past\n\nEach chapter begins with a snapshot of the historical scene, sketching in the major cultural, political, and economic events during the period covered. A look at the society and arts of the time completes the picture. A time line identifies the major historical, societal, artistic, and technological events and gives you a visual sense\n\nof the entire period. Less attention is paid to history and society in part III, the 20th and 21st centuries, because it is assumed that readers have studied U.S. history; instead those overviews function as triggers for memories of the events. The information about 20th- and 21st-century society includes fashion, trends, and arts movements. Gaining an essential understanding of history and society prepares you for the primary focus of the chapter—dance.\n\n10\n\nDancers, Dance, and Dance Works Through the Centuries\n\nEach chapter centers on three topics: dancers, dance, and significant dance works and literature. These topics provide you with an initial exposure to the major elements in dance history and a starting point for further research.\n\nDancers and Personalities\n\nThis section presents the major dancers, choreographers, and personalities of the period. Each entry begins with a brief biography that includes the person’s early history, career accomplishments, significant works, and contributions to dance.\n\nDance\n\nThis topic identifies and briefly describes the major dances of the period, including their purpose, forms, and supporting arts. In parts I and II, a section called Dance Designs categorizes the features of dance forms and dances. Underlying any dance design are the elements of space, time, and energy or effort. These elements are then incorporated into a dance structure that relates to the dance accompaniment, costuming, and performance space. Not all of the design elements relate to every dance or dance form. Although each dance is unique, those with similar design elements or structures can be grouped into categories, thereby providing a basis for comparison between categories and historical periods. The design elements include\n\nthe types of movements or steps, the number of people, relationships or formations, dance structure and type, dance accompaniment, costumes and other accoutrements, and the performing space (which may include the time of day, if important).\n\nDance design has changed through the ages; some elements have supplanted others in importance. Chapters 1 through 5 look at design in terms of individual, community, social, and professional performance. As dance became a performing and theatrical art, it separated from dance as an amusement or social pursuit found in the ballroom and other settings. Dance innovation in society; in ballrooms; on the musical, theatrical, or concert stage; in dance clubs; or on the streets has played an important and enduring role in cross-fertilizing new dance ideas and movements. This continued exchange among dance forms in various settings and within the context of society, arts, and history enriches dance performance, whether as a social pursuit or a performing art. In part III, the attention to design fades into the background while the exploration of significant works appears, as dance genres, forms, and styles emerge.\n\nLike dance design, musical accompaniment is an important collaborating art that influences and is in turn\n\n11\n\ninfluenced by dance. The types of music and the composers who supported dance are interrelated with dance’s\n\ndevelopment as both a social and performing art. Also important are the street wear of the time and dancers’ costumes and other adornments. A summary of dance costuming, shoes, and other paraphernalia paints a picture of the dancer during a specific period. Costume design was a significant part of dance’s transition from social amusement to performing art. Performance spaces too have varied considerably throughout history; those spaces, along with the technological innovations that transformed them, are important elements in the development of dance as a performance art.\n\n12\n\nSignificant Dance Works and Literature\n\nThis section lists major choreographic works of the period with the choreographer, date of initial performance, and in some cases additional information. Important dance authors and scholars add another perspective about some historical periods and provide avenues for further research.\n\nAt the end of each chapter, four questions prompt the reader to review and summarize important information. Finally, each chapter ends with a list of vocabulary terms. These terms are prompts for students to develop the definitions or descriptions based on the chapter’s information.\n\n13\n\nHow to Use the Web Resource\n\nThe main text of each chapter provides concise information about dancers, dance, and significant dance works of the historical period. A fundamental study could stop there, but more remains to be explored. The web resource, which you can access at www.HumanKinetics.com/HistoryOfDance, includes research projects, web links, supplemental learning activities that build on this foundation and allow further delving into the history of dance, and more. Your course of study may be a survey or an in-depth history of dance; how deep you dig into that history depends on your motivation, time, and the extensiveness of your course.\n\nBy focusing on dancers, dance, and significant dance works in each historical era, utilizing the right tools to gain understanding, and participating in activities that extend your knowledge, you will acquire a well- rounded view of dance from the dawn of time through the beginning of the third millennium—and beyond. Engaging in the history of dance through visual and video representations, audio recordings, reading and researching, and personal experiences of performing, creating, responding, and connecting will give you a foundation for understanding and a springboard for studying dance in the 21st century.\n\n14\n\nHow to Access the Web Resource Throughout History of Dance, Second Edition, you will notice references to a web resource.

Music and poetry exist in time; painting and architecture in space. But the dance lives at once in time and space.”\n\nCurt Sachs\n\nDance is a moving art. It exists during a brief period of time and then it is gone, only to remain in the memory of the dancers and the audience. Similarly, historical events leave remnants such as oral traditions, writings, and visual and other artistic representations. So how can you capture dance long enough to study its history? Actually, you are making dance history today and therefore could become one of tomorrow’s dance history makers or historians. You capture your dance and interpret it for yourself or others through your choreography, writings, or videos for the present or for the future. You are a link in dance tradition; you connect one generation to the next in the history of dance.\n\n17\n\nStudying Dance in a Historical Context\n\nStudying the history of dance from prehistory to the present may seem overwhelming. Vast numbers of people, dances and dance forms, dates, events, causes and effects, and historical periods can easily blur into an incomprehensible jumble of information that is difficult to connect to a specific period. To achieve a basic understanding of any history, you have to use tools to help you achieve the desired results. History of Dance, Second Edition, offers various ways to dig up the past and a systematic method to guide your study of dancers, dance, and dance works chronologically by linking them to historical periods.\n\nThe major focus of the history of dance is on the dancers, dance, and significant dance works and literature within a specific period. Understanding each of these components, and how they relate to each other and interrelate with other arts in a historical and cultural time frame, is the primary way to discover the who, what, where, when, and why of the history of dance.\n\nAs 20th-century dance history scholar and author Selma Jeanne Cohen pointed out, dance does not happen in a vacuum; it exists as part of the tapestry of arts, culture, society, and history.\n\nWhy study the history of dance? History may repeat itself in many ways, but each time it reappears, it manifests itself in new ways within the context of events, ideas, or arts styles. Sometimes studying the past can give insights into current events or trends or help you make predictions about the future. Attempting to understand the underlying concepts of the history of dance and the differences in its various periods provides a fascinating study. These concepts function as a rich resource that can support other dance studies, research, and choreography.\n\nIn studying the history of dance, you focus on\n\ndancers and other people who contributed to dance during a given era; dance, by reading about, viewing, performing, or reconstructing a dance, or by learning about the types of dance and dance forms of the period being studied; and significant dance works and literature, which provide an understanding of the important contributions of dance during that time.\n\nDancers\n\nPeople drive the events of history. In the history of dance, the people who drive the events are the dancers as well as the dance creators, choreographers, directors, and other personalities involved in dance. Their successes and failures contributed to the cause and effect of events in the history of dance. Although these people were driving forces, they were influenced by events that transpired during their lives. Visual, dramatic, and musical artists and other personalities bequeathed much to the development of dancers and dance. Studying the dancers, choreographers, and personalities who propelled history is interesting and important. The most difficult part to capture is the essence of the dance.\n\n18\n\nDance\n\nDance has often been called a mirror of society, a response to historical events as well as political, economic, even religious movements, and definitely a social statement—no matter where and by whom it is performed. In some historical periods social dances, such as those in the court and theaters during the reign of Louis XIV of France, were very similar to those performed onstage. In other periods many differences separated dance in society from dance in theatrical settings. For example, ballroom dances and classical ballet performances in the later 19th century had little in common. Within a given period, social and theatrical forms of dance contained important components that cross-fertilized each other as they developed.\n\nHow people danced and the types of dances they performed are linked to society and the historical period. Dance design encompasses the elements of space, time, and energy (effort) as a basis; specific design elements include\n\nthe types of movements or steps, the number of people, relationships or formations, dance structure and type, dance accompaniment, costumes and other accoutrements, and the performing space (which may include the time of day, if important).\n\nWhat, how, and when people performed the dances are important components in understanding dance in a particular period, and the information serves as a basis for comparing two or more dances or dance forms.\n\nYet a larger question to be answered is whether dance functioned as a social amusement or professional endeavor. Why and with whom did the participants study dancing, and what else did they study in order to prepare as a performer? These important discoveries change with different time periods. These questions and many more place dancers and their dances within the context of society and history.\n\nSignificant Dance Works\n\nThe study of dance works opens the door to the larger world of dance scholarship and literature within a historical context. Significant dance works comprise the foundation and sustenance of dance as a performing art. The writing about these works forms the core of dance literature. Historical dance manuals of written or notated dance works provide insight into another time. Reading them may require fluency in a foreign language or a contemporary or historical notation system, and the ability to understand the writing style and allusions or nuances associated with the period is essential. By deciphering floor patterns, reading written instructions, or decoding historical notation, researchers explore past eras that require extensive knowledge about dance as well as its related arts, culture, and society.\n\nStudying a written or notated dance work or viewing a reconstructed performance provides a window into\n\n19\n\nunderstanding the dance. By coupling that experience with writings and critiques about the performance, you can move beyond the steps, figures, and floor patterns to learn more about the dance and the dancers who performed it.\n\nSignificant dance works are important contributions from choreographers and dancers. In addition, often these works record and assimilate dance movements or pioneering efforts into the development of dance and art. Therefore, studying these works is like studying literature. When you view a performance and set it within a context of dance and history, you gain insights into dance and its history. In attempting to capture dance and to understand a historical work, you have to use a variety of resources as learning tools. Likewise, reading dance literature of the time or scholarly writings about the period will provide innumerable insights, allowing you to gain a sense of history as a basis for the dance of that period.\n\n20\n\nEighteenth-century dance notation. At a glance it looks like a series of decorative designs, but the page includes specific steps, positions of the arms, and figures.\n\nPhoto Les Arts decoratifs / Nom du photographe.\n\nDance Literature\n\nDance literature often supplies the theoretical, factual, and critical underpinnings that support dance. As a genre, dance literature encompasses a variety of sources. For example, the historical, theoretical, and philosophical segments include examples of seminal works such as 18th-century English dance master John Weaver’s early history of dance, 19th-century Italian choreographer Carlo Blasis’ theoretical writings about dance, and 20th-century American critic John Martin’s The Modern Dance. These are only three of many dance literature works you will encounter. Dance literature records autobiographies, biographies, impressions, and events. Librettos, dance-drama scenarios, choreographers’ notes, and critical writings of dancers capture the essence of dance and dance works through the ages. Each chapter of this book includes selected works to provide additional avenues of study.\n\nOther sources include journal articles and books by dance writers or scholars who study microcosms, a small part of a larger landscape of the history of dance. These in-depth research gems synthesize many sources and years of research to provide insight into a particular topic within the broader scope of dance history. Similarly, electronic recordings of dance steps and movements, choreography, and interviews with choreographers, dancers, and musicians provide invaluable resources about an art that vanishes before your eyes.\n\nMusic, drama, literature, and the visual or fine arts provide various conduits for studying dance and its relationship to developing or declining artistic movements. History offers an even broader foundation from which to see the impact of social, political, and economic events and changes on dance and other arts.\n\nDancers, dance, and dance works are situated within the larger contexts of geography, history, society, and culture. Likewise, dance as an art is supported by and reactive to performance settings, visual arts, music, and\n\n21\n\ndramatic arts (including costuming, decor, and lighting design).\n\n22\n\nThe interrelated arts model provides a visual representation of conduits, connections, and a context for studying the core topics of dancers, dance, dance works, and literature.\n\n23\n\nGaining a Sense of History\n\nHistory involves what people did, what they created or contributed, and what events happened within the context of a time frame. A historian analyzes and then synthesizes a great deal of information from a variety of viewpoints. This process requires some detective work, sifting through what seems to be true and what is opinion, and then deciding which major factors underlie or contribute to the cause and effect of an event. But first you have to answer some questions such as these in order to gain the basic knowledge that will allow you to understand a historical period:\n\nWho, what, where, when, and why were the historical, political, economic, and social events that interacted in a particular place in a given time period? What causes and effects can be determined as they relate to history, arts, and dance? Who, what, where, when, and why were the arts that contributed to the culture and society of the times? What ideas can be understood about the people, period, dance, arts, and culture of a specific place, region, or country?\n\nUnderstanding dance within the context of other arts, society, and historical settings and times helps you perceive how dance changed from one century to the next. Through these changes you can see the interrelationships and subsequent developments in dance. But central to these changes is the role of the dancers. Who performed the dances? What were their roles as participants? Where, when, and why did they perform?\n\nPeople and Events\n\nHistory is about people and events. Learning about people who activated the events during a particular time frame is the key to understanding that period. Historical events incite people’s actions or reactions. These ideas transfer to the history of dance, too. For example, Catherine de’ Medici, as regent queen of France, produced elaborate ballets to celebrate political events; on a smaller scale, nobility throughout Europe copied these ballets. Events have economic, political, or religious effects on people, nations, and times. Another view to consider is the response of society or arts movements to people and events.\n\nEconomic, Political, and Religious Contexts\n\nEconomic, political, and even religious events or movements can be integral to or catalysts for a historical period. These elements build context for the period. Consider each separately and then together to gain a sense of the times that relates to society and the arts, including dance.\n\nRelationships Between Society and Arts Movements\n\nOften arts movements are responses to historical, economic, political, and religious events or movements. For\n\n24\n\nexample, romanticism and romantic ballet provided an escape to new places and fantasy worlds for society\n\nduring the rise of industrialism in the 19th century. In the 1930s, emerging American modern dance choreographers responded to the social and economic times through their dance works. In reverse, the nobility or society have found ways to propel political perceptions, as the 17th century illustrated. During that time, the arts reinforced the majesty, power, and dominance of French aristocracy and Louis XIV as the Sun King. These are only three examples from different periods of history of how the relationship between society and the arts is important to understanding dance in history.\n\nPrimary and Secondary Sources\n\nExperts in social studies say that to understand a historical era, you have to immerse yourself in it and participate in it fully (Carnes 2014). Re-creating historical periods leads to an in-depth understanding of the people (in this case the dancers, choreographers, and other personalities who performed, created, or otherwise contributed to dance works) within the context of the times. Stepping back into a time period and immersing yourself in that world requires dedicated scholarship but yields immense benefits; you gain understanding of the period as well as information that you can apply in creating your personal dance history. The next step is to understand how the study of history works, which includes identifying the types of sources, time frames, and other elements that are unique to it.\n\nWhen studying history, you may use a primary source or a secondary source for information. Autobiographies, diaries, personal correspondence, eyewitness newspaper articles, production notes, and manuscripts written by choreographers are all primary sources. Reading these sources is as close as you can get to actually being there. Even so, they are filtered through one person’s perception of the event. For example, if you are studying the romantic period and you read a book written by an author of the time or study other evidence created during that period that gives a firsthand account of the dancing onstage, you are using a primary source.\n\nIn contrast, secondary sources are those in which a writer, researcher, scholar, or investigator uses primary resources to write about a period in the past. These people are not eyewitnesses of the dancers, dance, or dance works; their writings are interpretations of what they read or the media (film, video, or Internet site) they viewed. Secondary sources are a synthesis of primary sources from which the writer creates a new vision of historical periods or presents a specific point of view. For example, they might focus on a particular period of a choreographer’s artistic works, or they may offer a complete rendition of his career and the scope of his works. Other valuable sources include dance bibliographies, library collections, books, periodicals, magazines, journals, monographs, and unpublished materials. Since the beginning of the 20th century, primary and secondary sources have expanded to include media, such as film, video, and electronic resources.\n\nHistorical Frameworks\n\nThe continuum of time from prehistory to today is a constant stream of happenings that often overlap and overshadow one another. The importance of a dancer, a dance, or a dance work can get lost in the magnitude of this immense time line. Historians divide the time line into historical periods, eras, centuries, and other\n\n25\n\nsequential time frames. In this book, the history of dance is divided into chronological historical periods that\n\nrange from encompassing millennia, centuries, one century, or in the case of the 20th and 21st century, only one or more decades.\n\nHistory Highlight\n\nTimeline of Historical Periods\n\nPrehistory Ancient Civilizations (3500 BCE–476 CE)\n\nEgypt Crete Greece Rome\n\nMiddle Ages Through the Renaissance (475–1550 CE) Dance at Court (Late 16th and 17th Centuries) Dance From Court to Theater (18th Century) Romantic to Classical Ballet (19th Century) Dance in the United States (17th Through 19th Centuries) Imported Influences (1900–1929) Emerging American Dance (1930–1944) Maturing Classics (1945–1959) Chance and Change (1960–1979) New Directions (1980–2000) Global Interactions (2000–2016)\n\nA comparative time line includes several components during a specified time frame. The following table shows a time line of comparative arts for visual art, music, drama, and dance, which reveals that each art had different classical and romantic periods and similar baroque, modern, and postmodern and current periods. The complexity of a cultural period defied a systematic approach for defining definitely a cultural period. The length of each period varies as well. Viewing them side by side often reveals elements within each one or across several of them in one art or across two or more arts that might lead to research questions or perhaps some answers.\n\n26\n\nHistorical Periods\n\nHistorians and scientists divide history in various ways. For example, geologists divide Earth’s history geologically, such as the Triassic, Jurassic, or Cretaceous periods of the Mesozoic era. Archaeologists divide prehistory into the Old Stone Age (Paleolithic) and New Stone Age (Neolithic) ages, which cover thousands of years. Some historians divide history by these cultural periods:\n\nAncient or classic civilizations that began around 4000 BCE and lasted until the fall of Rome in 476 CE The Middle Ages, which spanned from 476 CE through the Renaissance (around the mid-1500s) Modern times, either from around 1200 CE to the present or from the Renaissance to the present\n\nAlthough the terms period and era are often used interchangeably, other historians have focused the designation of periods and eras within and across centuries. Sometimes these dates are arbitrarily set, depending on the type of history. In other words, a costume history may have different date ranges for a specific period than a music history does.\n\nMeasuring Time\n\nCenturies, millennia, periods, eras, decades, and other time frames are ways to measure time in history. To understand how these time divisions are applied, consider these facts:\n\nCenturies divide time into 100-year segments. Each century is designated by the year that starts it, such as the 1600s, which are referred to as the 17th century. Ancient or classic periods began around 4000 BCE (before the Common Era). From there the years count down to 1 BCE. For example, the golden age of Greece in the fifth century BCE was during the 400s. Following the year 1 BCE is 1 CE (Common Era), from which the years count up to the present day. A millennium is 1,000 years, or 10 centuries. The year 2000 was the beginning of the 21st century, and the following year was the first in a new millennium.\n\n27\n\n28\n\nA view of historical and archaeological time.\n\nCourtesy of Drid Williams.\n\nHistory Highlight\n\nEach century is divided into 10 decades of 10 years. Dividing by 10, 100, or 1,000 years provides precise time frames, but history doesn’t always fall into these neat parameters. For example, the following figure illustrates the life spans of modern dancers overlapping more than one century.\n\nCourtesy of Drid Williams.\n\nHistorical records are often not precise; you may encounter conflicting dates for an event, such as a person’s birth or death or the premiere of a performance, in different sources. By consulting additional sources you may be able to determine which date is correct. However, even the best historical scholarship cannot always solve mysteries about dates. Thus you will find the term ca. (an abbreviation for the Latin circa, meaning “around”), which indicates an approximation or the best surmise for an event.\n\nEras, Epochs, and Periods\n\nThe rise and fall of a series of events define historical eras and periods. Eras are considered the highest level of time organization. Some eras start from an arbitrary point, while others start from an important date or event. They span many years and are divided into epochs. An epoch begins at a reference point from which time is measured. Sometimes this is a specific calendar date, and sometimes it is an arbitrary date. Historical, political, economic, and cultural periods have been named for significant events or people who captured the\n\n29\n\nessence of that time. Some types of periods and eras are those named for\n\na ruler, such as the Napoleonic era or Elizabethan England; an economic period, such as the Great Depression or the Industrial Revolution; a political era, such as the French Revolution or World War II; a religious era, such as the Reformation, the Great Awakening, or transcendentalism; a social era, such as Prohibition or the Federal Works Projects; technology, such as the golden age of railroads or radio, or the computer age; the arts, such as romanticism, the Big Band era, or postmodernism.\n\nMost periods or eras cannot be categorized as one type; rather they are an amalgamation of several types or include strands from other time designations. Because not all historians from various disciplines such as dance, visual arts, theater, or music agree on specific time ranges for eras, periods, or epochs, you may encounter varying dates for them.\n\nEras and periods are not sensitive to centuries but depend on the rise and fall of events that constitute their development and decline. An event or epoch generally triggers the beginning of a period or era. The ending may be defined by an event, or it may fade out or be overtaken by another period that draws society’s focus. Accompanying these eras and periods are trends in fashion, music, slang, manners, and other aspects of society that often define the time. The arts are often central to defining an era or a period. Arts movements create both periods and eras. Each art form has its own periods or movements, which sometimes exist concurrently with those of other arts and sometimes occur in different centuries.\n\nBecause this book is a history of dance, the focus is on dance within a series of historical periods and also includes other arts that were prevalent at the time. A composite view of historical and arts periods allows you to see the interrelationships and therefore gain new understanding about how dance relates to arts and history. This view also allows you to question and hypothesize what happened when, where, and why, in regard to dancers, dance, and dance works, within one period or across several periods.\n\nTime Lines\n\nA time line is a visual representation of what happened during a period, an era, a century, or longer. Time lines can focus on specific categories of historical events, but as a composite they provide even more information. Viewing several overlaid time lines allows you to see how the elements interact with one another, which are developing while others are receding, and how major events and the sequence of events create cause and effect for history, the arts, and dance.\n\nAdditional time lines can easily be constructed from the information supplied in each chapter’s time capsules. These time capsules are clues about significant people and events in each period, era, or century. From these clues you can develop your own time line for a period in dance or add to one that identifies historical or arts movements found on various websites.\n\n30\n\nAll of these tools, combined with those for dance and related arts, provide a rich repository from which to select materials to study and develop a sense of dance, dancers, and dancing within a historical time frame.\n\n31\n\nTools for Capturing Dance\n\nCapturing dance through its history takes a variety of tools and resources, many of which you already have skill in using. Some tools are from dance, other arts, and other disciplines. Using these tools allows you to gain different perspectives and a better understanding of the richness of the dance, its components, and its interrelationships with other arts within the context of history.\n\nSeeing professional dancers perform a contemporary dance work or restage or reconstruct a work from another era gives you visual and kinesthetic information about the dance. But how do you truly learn about a dance that was performed in the 18th century? During that century and others, dancers and dance instructors wrote directions about how to perform the dances. Often, scholars research old dance manuals, then translate and reconstruct the dances, to study them. Dance scholars have written many books about dances from the past; likewise, dancers and choreographers have written about performing or the choreographic process. Other tools for capturing dance from another time period include dance notation, film or video performances, iconography, and oral and video histories.\n\nWriting Dance\n\nSome choreographers keep a choreographic journal in which they record movement ideas, steps, floor patterns, dancer positions, music counts, phrasing, costume design ideas, and more. Sometimes they document the choreographic process; other times they record the dance so that it can be restaged in the future.\n\nDancers throughout history have devised ways to capture dancing by creating personal and uniform systems to record dance movement so that it could be shared with others. Pictures, symbols, and descriptions of floor patterns, steps, gestures, and the movement’s quality in relation to the music are some forms of dance documentation. Many modes of recording dance have existed throughout history. In the 20th century, Rudolf von Laban and Rudolf Benesh developed sophisticated notation systems that are widely used by dancers and dance scholars today as a way to read and record dances and preserve and share a choreographer’s work.\n\nLabanotation, developed by von Laban, is a system for notating dance and movement—any movement, even that of spiders in scientific studies. Benesh notation has predominately been used to record ballet but is used for other dance forms as well. Learning these notation systems, or any historical notation form, is like learning another language. You must become fluent in order to understand the movement and the dance.\n\n32\n\nLabanotation uses a staff with symbols designating movement direction and level, and leg and arm gestures, all in relation to music.\n\nThis is an excerpt from the Labanotation score of Helen Tamiris’s “Negro Spirituals”. The music is Traditional. The excerpt is supplied courtesy of the Dance Notation Bureau.\n\n33\n\nBenesh movement notation records the dancer’s movements from behind, superimposed on a musical staff.\n\nIllustration courtesy of the Royal Academy of Dance.\n\nElectronic Dance Recording\n\nSince the last quarter of the 20th century, videotaped and, more recently, digital recordings of dance performances have had a tremendous impact on students, scholars, audiences, and dance educators. Before the advent of electronic recordings, dance films for entertainment and archival purposes had been made since the early 20th century. Anna Pavlova and Ted Shawn were very aware of the importance of film to dance artists and choreographers in preserving their works. They were pioneers in capturing 20th-century ballet and American modern dance on film.\n\nFilm and electronic recordings of dance and dance performance provide many renditions of classic to contemporary works, performed by a global array of dance artists. The easy accessibility of electronic performances has made them important tools for viewing, recording, and researching dance, dancers, and dance works.\n\nDance Iconography\n\nAnother visual tool that captures a moment, or perhaps the essence of a dance, is a picture, line drawing, or photograph. Dance photography recorded later 19th- and 20th-century dance and dancers, but other forms of iconography—paintings, lithographs, line drawings, bas-relief, mosaics, and rock art—captured dance in\n\n34\n\nearlier centuries. Dance and dancers have been the subjects of visual artists’ works through the centuries. Visual artists have shown dance within the contexts of the theater and society. Visual representations provide valuable evidence about the people who danced, what they wore, and the setting in which they danced.\n\nIconographical evidence sometimes is neither realistic nor representational, but rather a visual way to construe an impression, an abstraction, or the artist’s interpretation. For example, romantic ballerinas often appear to be caught balancing effortlessly on the tips of their toes, when in reality this was just a fleeting movement, considering the blocking (or lack thereof) in their shoes. Or, in another example, photographs of Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn capture a pose representative of the movement style and costumes from one of their dances.\n\nOral Tradition\n\nCan you count how many dances you know that you could get up and perform right now? How many people are there in each dance? Could you dance each person’s part? Dancers and choreographers develop prodigious kinesthetic, visual, and musically linked memory banks of dances. Former dancers can restage variations, dances, or a sizable repertory of works from memory. In times past, these memory banks, along with the choreographer’s notes, were the dance company’s repertoire repository. For example, Serge Grigoriev, régisseur for Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes, was in charge of the repertoire of 65 ballets between 1909 and 1929 alone.\n\nSometimes passing a treasure from one generation to the next causes it to deteriorate. This is true of dance as well—not from use, but from differences in interpretation and from picking up nuances imbedded in the style of a certain generation, so that the dance changes. Other changes can come from the interpreter of the work, the dancer. One often-told story is that a 19th-century ballerina could not perform the requisite 32 fouettés en tournant on her left leg, so she transposed them to her right leg, thereby altering the choreography.\n\nMuch of the history of dancing is based on oral tradition. Artists and teachers teach their students, who in turn teach their students, and so on for generations. Oral traditions give richness and a heritage to a dance work, forming links from one generation to the next. Learning about dance involves more than merely the steps and movements of dance; learning about the quality of a dance from an artist who performed it or learned it from the original choreographer is a wonderful experience. Sometimes these teaching and coaching sessions include stories or describe how the choreographer presented something or the images she used when teaching the dance. On the flip side, gaps in memory do exist, and steps or even complete sections of a dance may change as one dancer passes it down to another. And sometimes the original gets lost. Because dance is such an elusive performing art, people depend a great deal on oral traditions as a resource for much of its history. For example, the Jerome Robbins Dance Division of the New York Public Library of the Performing Arts continues its oral history project that includes interviews with hundreds of dancers, choreographers, critics, writers, photographers, and designers, among others.\n\nOral tradition has a historical meaning and purpose as well. When people describe their experiences performing or creating a work with a choreographer, their impressions of a work or a performance, how it\n\n35\n\nfeels to dance with a company or to be on tour, or what it was like to participate in specific events, they are creating a living archive. These recorded treasures, in which people can see the dancers and hear their descriptions of an event or period, are important tools for capturing the dancing of the past. Many dancers and choreographers who understand their value to future generations of dancers and historians have left recordings about their work.\n\nBefore audio and video recording, oral traditions were limited to written accounts in books, and journal articles recorded interviews of dancers talking about dance, choreography, or specific performances.\n\nDance and Technology\n\nTechnology was used in studying dance during the 20th century, but today, technology is a much more powerful entity than ever before. It provides new ways to view the history of dance, through televised and electronically recorded performances in various media and the Internet. Technological resources allow people to create multimedia environments in which dance comes to life. Technology makes available recorded music from various periods, visual and pictorial sources, and Internet sources that offer supporting information about dance, dance artists, and dance works in the context of society and a historical period.\n\nThe Internet is the foremost source for information about dance that ranges from scholarly research to personal opinion. You have to learn to sift through the resources to determine what is fact and what is opinion, and how opinion relates to the truth. Technology has had a profound impact on the history of dance and how people study it today and will study it in the future. Despite the ease with which information can be acquired from the Internet, the use of that information, as with any research or scholarship venture, is guided by a set of ethics and standards of academic honesty.\n\nAccessing Dance Through Other Arts\n\nWhen you perform a dance, several other arts support its performance, such as music, costumes, lighting, perhaps a set or set pieces, and a performing space. Resources from these collaborative arts provide many clues about dancers, dance performances, and dance works in history. Arts resources include written, musical, theatrical, and visual arts. Each art’s historical movements blossom, develop, and then decline, sometimes in the same time frame, in tandem, or as a response to the initiation of another art form; often they cross-fertilize one another, adding richness to the tapestry of arts and culture within a society.\n\nMusic, visual arts, and theater histories provide tremendous insights into dancers, dance, and dance works, and they offer evidence about how the dance or dance work took form. Understanding the essence of the arts, society, and culture of a historical period involves listening to music that accompanied the dance; viewing the paintings, sculpture, decor, sets, clothing, and costuming; and attending period dramatic and dance productions.\n\n36\n\nThe arts serve a dual function in a history of dance. They support the study of dance as a performing art, and they give it an artistic context. Related arts are important, integrative components of and accompaniments to the history of dance.\n\nMusical Sources\n\nListening to the music that accompanied dancing, played on period instruments, is another invaluable experience, as is understanding the meter, tempo, qualities, and style of that music. Learning about composers who created works for the dance yields additional information about the relation of the music to the dance.\n\nIn some periods, dance was dominated by its musical sources, whereas in others dance drove the music that accompanied it. At times the music was composed to support the dance; for example, 19th-century choreographer Marius Petipa gave specific musical directions to composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky during the creation of Swan Lake. In other periods, such as in 18th- and early 19th-century romantic ballets, dances were set to scores pulled from operas and popular music. In the 20th and 21st centuries, casual or intense, long-standing collaborations between modern dance and ballet choreographers and musicians have proliferated. Recordings of historical music are available in libraries on CDs and on many Internet sites. The partnership between dance and music is important throughout history. Studying one often provides insights into the other.\n\nDance Spaces, Sets, and Costumes\n\nDance spaces, sets, and costumes provide much information about dance in a specific time frame. In many historical periods, sets and costumes were important attributes of a dance performance. Often the integral relationship between costumes and sets unifies the production.\n\nDance throughout history has used both indoor and outdoor performance spaces. Ancient Greek theater productions, equestrian ballets performed for Renaissance nobility, and postmodern dancers performing on rooftops in Soho in New York City are examples of dance that uses outdoor venues. Indoors, dance has been performed in a variety of formal and informal spaces, including a nobleman’s great hall, theater stages, museums, lofts, and gymnasiums.\n\nAs dance moved from the court into the theater after the Renaissance, scenic and lighting design and technical inventions evolved. Theatrical and operatic productions used elaborate backgrounds and wings, from drops painted in perspective to sculptural set pieces.\n\nDance and theater spaces; theatrical scenic, lighting, and costume design; and theater technology have independently and together affected or been influenced by dance throughout history. Studying where and how dancers performed in various theatrical venues, and how the spaces colored their relationships with other performers and audiences, provides important information about dance in its evolution from a popular pastime to a theatrical profession and performing art.\n\n37\n\nDuring most of theatrical history, scenic design for dance performances was directly connected to theater styles and periods. Set designs for dance have ranged from complete sets, backdrops, and stationary or moveable set pieces to site-specific environments, including parks and museums. Theatrical settings provide dance works with a context of place and time and through their visual style convey the symbolic, fantastical, realistic, or environmental aspects of the performance.\n\nDance costume design has ranged from elaborate or casual street wear to stylized clothing to extravagant costumes designed for a specific work. Costumes for both men and women have had a direct relationship to their dancing and the dances created during a historical period. Costumes, shoes, headdresses, masks, and accessories often dictated the type, style, and range of movement afforded the dancer. Costume changes affected dance technical developments of past centuries. For example, shortened skirts and shoes with the heels removed exhibited intricate and fast footwork.\n\nScenic, costume, and lighting design are the visual arts that support dance performance. Theatrical designers and visual artists have frequently worked with choreographers to create unified productions; examples are Alexandre Benois’ costumes for the ballet Petrouchka, Isamu Noguchi’s sculptural set pieces for Martha Graham’s modern dances, Oliver Smith’s scenery for Agnes de Mille’s Rodeo, or Robert Rauschenberg’s sets and costumes for Merce Cunningham. Paintings, photographs, sculpture, and other visual arts provide evidence of dancers, dance, and dance performance throughout history.\n\nVisual Arts\n\nViewing the visual arts from a distinct period gives insights into the relationship of dance and society, the dress of the people who danced, and the artist’s perception of and relationship to a specific dancer and dancing. Artists’ perceptions can be representational or stylized, depending on their points of view and what they are communicating. During different time periods, the prevailing style of art can be different, and it is not always a direct representation of the choreographer’s interpretation.\n\nAnother great way to experience paintings, sculpture, and other arts (some of which may include dance as subject matter) from various periods is by visiting a large art museum or even the Internet. Many of the world’s greatest art museums have websites to explore.\n\nMedia Arts\n\nBeyond traditional visual arts from a specific period, film, videos, or DVDs of dancers, dances, and reconstructed dances reveal stylistic and era-specific nuances. Television documentaries or movies immerse you in history through settings, costumes, and music. These vivid visual reconstructions transport you to another time and place. Since the 20th century, film and later video has captured and documented dance. Today, dance for the camera as a media art captures dance from creation through performance for students, dancers, choreographers, and other personalities. Their insights, views, and opinions bring new dimensions to the processes that accompany dance performance and choreography for new and wider audiences for dance. These resources posted on the Internet add personal and some\n\n38\n\ninsightful aspects through viewing and learning about dance that in turn can contribute to an enhanced\n\nrichness to its history. The Internet has become a vital repository for dance with many websites to select from and to explore. Libraries, museums, dance organizations, and other sources provide access to dance films, videos that support or extend the study of dance and enhance the study of dance history.\n\nThe value of the visual and media arts as tools for capturing the history of dance is undeniable. These tools provide a tremendous amount of information about dance and dancers. Furthermore, other visual art works created during the period can often supply important information about where dance was performed, other dance forms, country- or region-specific costumes, and the dancers who performed. Visual and related arts resources provide points of origin from which your observational skills and imaginations allow you to re-create a time, place, or event.\n\nDiaries to Dance Manuals: Written Sources\n\nAutobiographies, biographies, and other forms of dance literature offer firsthand accounts. Dancers wrote diaries, dance manuals, and theoretical works about dance that often mirrored the society and culture of the times. Personalities from other arts and writers described the dance and wrote critiques of the performers and their performances. Firsthand accounts, whether written or media recordings, impressions, or facts, are considered primary sources.\n\n39\n\nHow a Dance Historian Captures the Past\n\nHistorians consider the time frame, place, and relationship of dance as a contributing factor, connector, presence, or representative of a group within social, national, and theatrical realms of a particular region or nations. To capture the dance of a specific time, dance historians locate records of dance works from that period, including written, notated, or media (recorded) evidence of them and writings about them. Reading and translating the words or notations or viewing the dances provides critical evidence for understanding a dance and its relationship to other dance works of the period. This understanding can expand to similar works by the same artist or to different artists who created similar works in the same or another period.\n\nIn synthesizing all this information, dance historians develop suppositions—research questions or hypotheses about what is believed to be true about the dance. Then they try to answer the questions.\n\nDance literature offers supporting documentation for the dance work. After looking at history with a focus only on dance, the next step is to gain a wider view of it within the context of other arts, history, and society; you have to immerse yourself in that time period.\n\nUsing resources from other arts will also help support your understanding of dance within a particular period. Visual and other arts resources provide a point of origin from which to use your observational skills and imagination to re-create a time, place, or event.\n\n40\n\nSummary\n\nSo why study history, or even more important, why study the history of dance? As a dancer, you have a connection to the history of dance, and through dancing you perform in the studio or onstage in reconstructed historical works or new works. Each choreographic or scholarship project you take on includes a microcosmic history of dance, expanding your view of history. Studying the choreographic masters of the past provides inspiration and ideas for today and tomorrow. Using the tools for capturing the past provides you ways to access and develop a deeper perspective of dance. The history of dance you create will uniquely interweave with your background, experiences, and philosophy. Your dance works will intertwine with works of others, including people and events as the future unfolds. Creating your history of dance is important to you, to dance as an art form, and as part of the future of dance. So before you create your own history of dance, discover the past.\n\n41\n\nPart I Dance in Early History\n\n42\n\nChapter 1 Dance at the Dawn of Time\n\n“Dance has been called the oldest of the arts. It is perhaps equally true it is older than the arts. The human body making patterns in time and space is what makes the dance unique among the arts and\n\nperhaps explains its antiquity and universality.”\n\nAnya Peterson Royce, The Anthropology of Dance (1977)\n\n43\n\nWall painting with hunting scene.\n\nFrom DANCING AT THE DAWN OF AGRICULTURE by Yosef Garfinkel, Copyright © 2003. By permission of the University of Texas Press.\n\nIn a dark cave, a young boy holds a torch near the drawing on the wall. Hunters crowd closely together to hear the elder; his voice echoes as he begins to tell the story of the great hunt depicted on the wall. A herd has moved into their valley. Tomorrow they will try to reenact the hunt drawn on the wall.\n\nAs the sun rises, hunters armed with spears crouch in the brush waiting. The animals approach and the hunt begins. Before dawn, the men had performed their dance to ensure a successful hunt and to appease the gods for the animals they would kill for food. Tonight, the shaman will lead the community to celebrate the success of the hunt by dancing in the sacred grove at the top of the hill.\n\n44\n\nGlance at the Past\n\nLife in the Stone Age conjures up images of Fred and Wilma Flintstone or the Croods living in a cave house, wearing fur-and-hide clothing. These caricatures capture the essence of what many people believed to be true about prehistoric times, before new evidence challenged those ideas. Today, what people know about early humans, their lives, and their dance is based on archaeological, anthropological, and scientific discoveries. This collective knowledge contains many theories that change as new discoveries are made or as researchers study the past from new perspectives and with new technology.\n\nAlthough prehistory has no written records, art and artifacts provide evidence about humans, society, and the importance of the arts. Anthropologists and dance historians throughout the 20th and now the 21st century have written about beginnings of dance in prehistoric times. Archaeologists gather knowledge by studying artifacts and settlements; likewise, historians study documents and artifacts from the past. Social and cultural anthropologists directly observe society, as do ethnographers who focus their studies on dance. Ethnoarchaeologists study a present-day culture to gain insights into prehistoric and ancient cultures.\n\nSpecifics of prehistoric life, society, and arts are difficult to discern because no written names of leaders, battles, or events exist. Society, dance, and other arts were important parts of people’s lives and beliefs about the world and the supernatural. In an attempt to understand prehistoric society and lifestyles, scientists and historians have constructed theories about how humans lived, worked, played, worshipped, and interacted with their environment. Often the theorists’ views are colored by the times in which they live and the discipline they practice. Along with developing theories about how early humans lived, anthropologists and archaeologists speculate on the relationships between artifacts (paintings, bas-relief and sculptures, musical instruments, and jewelry and other personal adornments) and early humans, society, and the arts.\n\n45\n\nHistory and Political Scene\n\nPrehistory is the period before the advent of writing that marks the beginning of recorded history. This period, which covered thousands of years, has been classified into these three cultural periods named for the predominant tool-making technology of the time:\n\nThe Stone Age (includes the Paleolithic period, or Old Stone Age, and the Neolithic period, or New Stone Age) The Bronze Age The Iron Age\n\nThe events that mark the end of prehistory occurred at different times in various parts of the world. In Egypt, the development of hieroglyphics around 3500 BCE is accepted as the beginning of recorded history; however, in New Guinea the prehistoric era ended around 1900 CE. The three-age system (Stone, Bronze, and Iron) applies best to European sites. Scientists have also discovered that because cultures develop at different rates, they could skip a stage. For example, Amazonian tribes in the 21st century remain in the Neolithic period. Tribes in the southern Sahara Desert went from the Stone Age directly to the Iron Age, skipping over the Bronze Age.\n\nDuring prehistory, changing ways of life contributed to the increase in complexity of social systems, which encouraged the evolution of political systems. When prehistoric people were hunter-gatherers, family groups often joined together to live in camps. These groups or clans were closely knit groups or interrelated families that further expanded into larger, local groups and tribes. With the development of agriculture these groups and tribal communities established social, political, and economic systems.\n\nDuring prehistory, four bases of power emerged through the development of political systems: ideology,\n\n46\n\neconomy, military, and political sources. Dynamic settlements underlie the development of political structures. The complexity of politics in a prehistoric community was dependent on the social complexity of the community. People with wealth within a community gained status within the group. These economic leaders became political leaders because of their economic power, which led to development of a chief as the tribe’s leader. Chiefs instituted systems of retribution. Tribal members gave the chief goods and services that in turn contributed to the chief’s political power. Prehistoric burial sites, such as those in the southeastern United States, reveal the political significance of the dead by where the person was buried and how much of their wealth was buried with them. Inheritance of power ensured continuity of a family’s political leadership.\n\nHistory Highlight\n\nHumans emerged on Earth relatively late in its history. If you were to reduce the Earth’s 4.5 billion years into a single day, humans would not come on the scene until 1 minute and 7 seconds before midnight.\n\nSociety and the Arts\n\nIn the Old Stone Age, small groups of nomadic hunters and food gatherers roamed the land. People traveled in isolated groups, with the oldest man serving as the leader and decision maker. In the New Stone Age, with the increase in population, larger groups of people banded together for protection. Bands of people grew into tribes, and nomadic hunting was replaced by village communities growing crops. With this evolution toward an agrarian society, population continued to grow, communities began to stratify, and consequently the political structure became more complex. New ways to communicate, more warfare, and inventions such as fire, tools, jewelry, crafts, and decoration became important attributes of an evolving society.\n\nArtworks of dance and dancers are important indicators of a society’s level of sophistication, tracing humans as nomadic hunters in the Paleolithic period to village residents in the Neolithic period. During the span from ca. 12,000 to 3000 BCE, rapid changes took place in all phases of human existence. Throughout this period of nonliterate societies, dance was an important means of social interaction.\n\nDance was an important means of social interaction among communities whose social structures were developing societies. In this phase of development bands of people, tribes, or chiefdoms existed (Garfinkel 2003).\n\nPrehistoric dance artifacts include rock art and portable items such as vases and tools found on the island of Levanzo near Sicily. Discoveries from as early as the ninth millennium BCE, known as the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A period, include symbolic artwork of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures, geometric patterns, and body ornamentation (Garfinkel 2003). The earliest dance scenes appeared in the period from the eighth millennium BCE to the third millennium BCE. These scenes, discovered in southeastern Europe and Egypt, went through three styles: naturalistic to linear to geometric (Garfinkel 2003).\n\n47\n\nRock art and other artifacts with scenes of dancing served as records of the dance and also as a memory aid for those who knew the dance (Garfinkel 2003). Archaeologist Yosef Garfinkel (2003) writes, “Unlike ritual paraphernalia which is a direct product of rituals and religious ceremonies, dancing activities do not leave direct evidence in the archaeological record” (p. 22). In his study, Garfinkel selected scenes that were comprehensive representations of dance. He claims that “they are therefore more authentic than photographs of dance taken by modern western anthropologists in traditional societies” (Garfinkel 2003, 23). He considers dancing scenes to be authentic documentation of dance activity. After analyzing the scenes, he claimed that the dance evidence sheds light on individuals and their bonds to the community, calendrical rituals, and the purpose of religious ceremonies.\n\nSome current scholars dispute the use of pictorial scenes as a basis for discerning movement (Iyer 2000). The poses depicted in these scenes are signposts for the study of body shapes that reveal much about prehistoric dance. What happened immediately before and after the poses remains a mystery.\n\nHistory Highlight\n\nIn periods before the emergence of written language and the establishment of schools, community rituals (which were symbolized by dance) were the primary tool for transferring information and knowledge from one generation to the next. Dance depicted as rock art has been found in many places throughout the world, which supports the use of dance as one of the most powerful symbols during the evolution of prehistoric societies (Garfinkel 2003).\n\n48\n\nDancers and Personalities\n\nMen, women, and children danced in life celebrations and congregational ceremonies and rituals, for tribal or village unity and power and for spiritual reasons. Dance themes revolved around life-span events that were meaningful to the tribe members individually and collectively, such as birth, puberty, courtship, marriage, and death. These rites of passage have been observed throughout history in all cultures. The dances linked directly to a person’s life experiences and role in the community. Chiefs, village leaders, and shamans danced as part of these celebrations, ceremonies, and rituals. Most tribes included dance in religious ceremonies and festivals.\n\nMost early humans believed in a spiritual world, often a supreme god or many gods. Spiritual and religious beliefs, based on superstition and infused in magic, were an integral part of life. Religious beliefs evolved to provide ways to explain supernatural and natural events and aspects of the environment that were not easy to understand. Early humans tried to identify themselves with their gods, whom they often perceived as angry. To appease them, humans developed rituals and sacrifices.\n\nIn prehistoric times, rulers were perceived as either gods or as chosen by the gods. Laws came from the gods, and people who disobeyed laws were dealt with harshly so that rulers could keep control. A state of war existed continually, either between two groups or between the ruler and the people.\n\nThe shaman, who possessed magical powers, was a physician, religious leader, and lead dancer. When a priest class appeared during the Neolithic period, shamans emerged as the community’s highest-ranking priest- physicians and prophets. As spiritual leaders, they kept the community healthy, prosperous, and safe. One way they did that was by teaching dances and rituals to the tribe so that its ceremonies would be successful. Shamans performed all the tribal dances, keeping the community directed and using their power to combat and win over the environment and remain in good graces with the gods or spirits. Shamans had a number of other specific responsibilities in the tribe (Leff and Leff 1958) such as reading weather signs, directing the planting of crops, determining fire and water control, predicting the future, and diagnosing illness by studying the stars.\n\nShamans also had extended powers that included magic and ecstatic dance—getting into an excited state or trance induced through dance, reinforced by music, alcohol, and hallucinatory substances.\n\nWell-known shamans in various parts of the world today have experienced afterimages and recollections of what they saw while in a trance for months afterward. It seems likely that after a trance shamans would paint their own pictures, creating rock art. An old bushwoman said, “The potency of animals such as the eland was stored and kept in the paintings. This potency would flow from the paintings to the shamans while in a trance and give them more power to heal, make rain, or have successful hunting expeditions” (Williams 2000, 191).\n\nLearning about early humans and their world provides clues about who danced, and why and where they danced. This type of detective work requires not only research but also an ability to imagine what life was like in those times. You must always take caution in reconstructing the social behavior of this period, because\n\n49\n\nhistorians know little about the ritual dances that have been preserved in artwork from various nonliterate societies.\n\nAccording to 20th-century dance ethnologist Allegra Fuller Snyder, the figure of the dancer provides clues to the significance of dance in nonliterate societies (see figure 1.1). The inner reasons for dancing and the outer manifestations of the dance, both personal and within the group or society, start with the dancer’s experiences and then move to the product. The inner aspects require subjective interpretation, while the outer aspects provide observable movement. The outer aspects of the dancers—what is revealed to society and the environment—frame their social aspects. These relationships extend from the individual to the group, and then from group to group, through life-span celebrations, rites of passage, or rituals. Although Snyder’s work has focused on nonliterate societies in the 20th century, her theories are applicable to prehistoric societies and their dance (Snyder 1992).\n\n50\n\nFigure 1.1 The dancer and dance in nonliterate societies.\n\nReprinted, by permission, from G. Kassing, 2014, Discovering dance (Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics), 79.\n\n51\n\nDances in Prehistory\n\nFrom its origins, dance served as a medium for magic and religion through ritual and ceremonies, integral parts of early human societies. A ritual is a series of acts established through tradition. A ceremony signifies or celebrates an important event and is performed by enacting strictly prescribed rituals. As both a form of social expression and an important part of ritual in early society, dance bridged the gap between the human world and that of the gods, spirits, and demons, as indicated in figure 1.2.\n\n52\n\nFigure 1.2 Human interaction with nature as a spiritual force.\n\nPrehistoric people did not understand the physical laws of nature. They did not know why they experienced phenomena such as night and day, seasons, fire, rain, drought, earthquakes, and violent storms. Because they believed that gods or spirits controlled the world, they used dance to induce communion with them and sacrifice to appease them.\n\nPrehistoric dance was very basic; using everyday movements, it served as an important means of communication. Because nearly everyone in early communities danced, the movements were simple. Dance unified people as they celebrated family and community life events. As a medium to express and communicate critical information, dance was integral to survival, hunting, and war; through it, domestic and warrior skills were passed on to current and subsequent generations. Within the community, dance was used to celebrate human, animal, and plant fertility or to gain weaponry skills in preparation for war, followed by victory or defeat. Stories recounted through movement and gesture celebrated personal or community feats and preserved significant events occurring in the present or from the past. Dance, using body movement and gesture, evolved into a language to express fears and joys and proclaim faith in a spiritual world. Through it the chief, shaman, chosen people, or entire community appeased, worshipped, or paid homage to the gods or spirits.\n\nDance Themes\n\nEarly humankind’s surroundings and life challenges predetermined dance themes. Religion, politics, and social and other aspects of tribal life were interwoven. Humans danced to profess power over the elements. The shaman’s role in society connected everyday life, life-span celebrations, and religious celebrations for the group. Dance themes interrelated and overlapped, making it difficult to isolate them; however, the primary functions of dance were social and religious. Dance was used socially in formal ceremonies that acknowledged lifetime markers for a person or group, as entertainment, and to promote integration or solidarity within the community. Magical functions had these dual purposes: to secure or increase fertility and to chase away evil powers (Lange 1975). Dance themes that wove throughout community life include fertility, life-span celebrations, weapons and war, medicine and healing, and religion and the supernatural.\n\nFertility\n\nFertility rites were believed to control the spirit world, and fertility was the primary dance theme of early people. The fertility theme included both human and plant reproduction. Plants were the source of food, clothing, and shelter. Human fertility related to the tribe’s existence and ability to expand in numbers, thereby\n\n53\n\nincreasing its power as a community. Most children died in infancy or early childhood, and few people lived beyond their thirties, so the tribe needed many children to ensure repopulation.\n\nAs hunter-gatherers, early people continually needed to find animals to hunt and plants to gather for food, clothing, and shelter. In nomadic tribes, men danced to ensure plentiful animals for a good hunt, to practice and teach hunting skills, and to celebrate the success of the hunt and prowess of the hunters. The relationship between man and animals was one of awe, fear, and often worship.\n\nIn agricultural settlements, people’s existence depended on the success of their crops and herd animals. Dances for plant fertility focused on good weather, rain, and abundant crops, celebrating nature for providing food. The fertility cycle also included dances that marked the beginning or end of a season or a solar or lunar event. The dances provided the community with a way to recognize a seasonal event, remember when it was time to plant or harvest, and celebrate the return of the sun after an eclipse.\n\nFertility dances in agricultural communities focused on sowing and harvesting crops. Most fertility dances that related to planting included leaps; they thought that the higher the leap, the higher the crop would grow. Dancers identified with the plants rather than with the planters. They made circular figures or danced around a pole, green tree, pile of stones, or another dancer or dancers. Often dancers carried or wore greenery, such as a tree branch with leaves to display fertility power.\n\nRain had special importance for agricultural communities. Tribes all over the world performed rain dances to ensure crop growth. While the men danced, they held water in their mouths, later spewing it onto the ground. Women sang and danced around the community’s wells to ensure that they would not go dry. In the Omaha tribe, members of the Sacred Buffalo Society would put a vessel of water in the center of the group. Men danced around it four times, then one man would take a mouthful of water and spew it out. Then another man would dump out the water and the rest of the tribe would try to sip it up from the ground and spit it into the air. In an Australian rain dance, people danced around a pile of stones until the rain began.\n\nHarvest dances celebrated crop gathering that would support a fruitful new year. These celebratory dances revolved with the agricultural cycle, invoking the return of spring to start the cycle over again.\n\nLife-Span Celebrations\n\nThe human fertility theme permeates tribal life and has strong ties to life-span celebrations and rites of passage such as birth, puberty and initiation, courtship and marriage, and death and funeral dances.\n\nBirth\n\nBirth was a miracle in early society; a clear understanding of conception did not exist. Some tribes believed that the spirits of ancestors or birds entered the woman to make her pregnant. As a consequence, a child was considered a reincarnation of an ancestor who had spiritually slipped into the womb. In many tribes the man\n\n54\n\nwas not thought to have a role in conception. Magic and ceremony overshadowed the prenatal period, during\n\nwhich women conducted many rituals. Birth dances facilitated as well as celebrated the birth. In patriarchal societies, the father went to bed during the birth of a child while the mother and other females danced to expedite the labor process. In patriarchal societies, a baby boy was welcomed with music and dance.\n\nInitiation Rites\n\nInitiation rites associated with puberty used dance as a method of instruction for boys and girls ages 12 to 14. The initiation dances for girls tested endurance, strength, and maturity for this rite of passage to womanhood. Older women taught the young girls who were entering womanhood domestic duties, songs, and dances, transferring their feminine powers to the next generation.\n\nInitiation dances had to be performed over a certain time span to be effective. For example, some Native American females in California danced for 10 nights without stopping, starting with the first night of menstruation. The young woman danced forward and backward, facing the east. When she tired, she was supported. In southeastern Australia, men and women danced together in a circle without touching. At one point in the dance, women lifted the men overhead.\n\nInitiation dances for young men tested their bodies and endurance, serving as predictors of their later strength as a resource to the tribe. The purpose of initiation was to drive away evil spirits that threatened the passage to adulthood. Circumcision was often a part of this transition to manhood. As part of the initiation rites, young men and their skills were presented to the eligible young women of the tribe for selecting a partner. Initiation rites for both young men and women taught the sex act.\n\nCourtship and Marriage Rituals\n\nMany courtship-themed folk dances, like those in which lines of men and women move toward and away from each other and couples spin in a circle, stem from prehistoric fertility dances and rites.\n\nIn prehistoric times, courtship dances included one or more women dancing around a man, or vice versa. Other fertility rituals included unmarried couples dancing and then the female being abducted. Sometimes unmarried couples danced holding each other’s hips, followed by the woman being carried away by the man she had been dancing with; the abduction symbolized marriage. Most courtship dances contain elements of incomplete consummation.\n\nMarriage dances celebrated the transition from one stage of life to another. Their purpose was to strengthen the bond between the bride and the groom, thus ensuring reproduction. Tribes had various marriage rituals, including the following:\n\ngroup marriages—One tribe married another.\n\n55\n\npolyandry—One woman had several husbands. polygyny—One man had several wives. marriage by capture—Often a primary reason for a war; this practice was legal in some countries until the 17th century.\n\nOften a marriage dance was part of the agricultural rites. The bridegroom performed a dance in a circle of women.\n\nDeath, Funeral, and Burial Dances\n\nFuneral dances protected the living and the dead from attacks by spirits. These dances formed a tie between the living and the dead and provided the dead with a way to reach their ancestors. Furthermore, a funeral dance was a renewal of life. Most funeral dances were performed in the house of the deceased, in the presence of the corpse. The shaman danced, accompanied by a drummer.\n\nIn more advanced societies, mourners formed a procession behind the corpse, following it to the burial place. Many times the deceased wore a mask. Members of the procession would wear the deceased’s clothing and reenact parts of his life. In funeral dances, men and women jumped over swords or even the dead person. In some dances, one person would pretend to be dead and then stand up at the end of the dance to be kissed. The kiss would revive the “dead” person.\n\nWeapon and War Dances\n\nUsually danced by men only, these dances included weaponry skills as training for battle. Performed in formations, the dances often included pantomime of battle strategies. Weapon dances were realistic in character. They were performed as choral dances using opposing group movements to simulate battles, or they were performed as chain dances, in which the front warriors attacked and the rear defended. The dances, performed for long periods, induced euphoria in the men and ended with the leader being elevated or thrown into the air and caught by the group.\n\nSword dances have survived since early times. Likewise spear and stick dances, such as the Russian spear dance and Native American and Hawaiian stick dances, are found around the world.\n\nWarriors in preparation for battles performed dances primarily for these two reasons: to gain unity and work as a team, and to work themselves into an emotional state to ready themselves for battle. An auxiliary benefit was the warriors’ stimulated sexual feelings. War dances had three parts: before, during, and after the battle. Typically they would begin with a beating drum. Often naked warriors reenacted the actual battle using weapons, but not all war dances used weapons. In some cultures the warriors circled the chief. The war dance concluded with a frenzied solo that ended with the warrior driving a sword into the ground before the chief. During the battle, women and children in the tribe danced to ensure the warriors’ safety, victory, and return\n\n56\n\nhome.\n\nIf the warriors were victorious, a celebration with feasting and a victory dance was held upon their return. The purpose of the dance was to recount what had happened and commemorate the triumphant event. It also embedded into the warriors’ minds which tactics could be used for the next battle, as a way of ensuring victory in the future. Often the dances showed the fight, pursuit, rape, and cannibalism that were part of the conquest. If the warriors did not return, the community mourned with dances of lament.\n\nHistory Highlight\n\nArchaeologists have tried to reconstruct a history of migration to the Americas. Some believe that around 30,000 years ago a single group of modern humans migrated to North America from Asia. Some experts believe the first Americans appeared on the continent south of the Canadian ice sheets around 15,000 years ago. Over the last two decades, molecular geneticists have developed methods to identify samples of remains of Paleoamerican occupation in America. Over the last 40 years, physical anthropologists using radiocarbon data have determined early occupation by humans in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Oregon.\n\nMedicine and Healing Dances\n\nAs the chief physician for the community, the shaman’s role included performing healing and medicine dances to keep people healthy and strong. Healing dances were intended to drive away evil spirits, devils, demons, and ghosts.\n\nSupernatural and Religious Dances\n\nSuperstition, religion, and belief in the supernatural were deeply intertwined and a major focus of early humans. These dance themes varied with the tribes’ views of their relationship to their environment and the superstitions and religious beliefs that helped them gain control of their world. Rituals and religious activity required strict adherence to rules about performing the dance, including the use of objects and specifics of time and place in order to exhibit respect, worship, or adoration toward the god or gods. Some tribes worshipped fire, ancestors, or totems, or they performed cosmic-focused dances. In trance dances, participants invoked supernatural powers.\n\nCosmic or Celestial Dances\n\nIn early societies, the moon, sun, and other solar bodies were mysterious, seemingly powerful entities. The\n\n57\n\nrelationship between the sun, the moon, and the seasons was an important natural phenomenon that affected early humans. In various societies the shaman and the tribe performed dances for the moon or sun and fire. Sun dances, which are associated with male dancers, were circular and traveled clockwise. Moon dances, with their changing shapes and the contrast of black and white, were associated with females and matriarchal societies.\n\nCelestial events associated with each change of season presented an occasion for dancing, as did specific solar or lunar events. For example, millennia later, the celebration of Carnival (the day before fasting begins for Lent) is determined by the change of the season.\n\nSun and moon dances relate directly to fertility, holidays, and the seasons. The full moon was an important occasion, celebrated in many Near Eastern prehistoric and ancient cultures with nighttime ceremonies (Garfinkel 2003). Aztec sun dancers faced the east with their bodies painted red on the side that faced the sun and black on the other side.\n\nFire Worship\n\nFire was a magical element for early humans and remains so today in many cultures. Man swallowed fire and walked on hot coals to evoke the power of the element and to ward off demons. Fire burning on the altar and keeping a perpetual flame have long been associated with religion.\n\nAncestor Worship\n\nAncestors represented the connection between the past glories of the tribe and the present, and they were often the voices that directed the future. The oldest men petitioned ancestors to determine what they believed should happen to the tribe.\n\nAnimal Dances, Totemism, and Animism\n\nImitative animal dances were a basic theme of prehistoric societies that also related to fertility. Man’s relationship to animals was strong in several ways. Although animals were a source of food, shelter, and clothing, they also presented a danger. Prehistoric people believed that magic would ensure a successful hunt, capture an animal’s spirit, or appease its spirit for killing it. Animal dances have continued throughout the ages in various forms.\n\nTotemism originated in North America among Native Americans, for whom it was a way to understand the world. Totemism means that a human spirit would take the spirit of an animal, plant, or other natural element. The connection to that spirit would become part of the person’s power. People wore the sign of their totem and did not kill the animal that reflected their personalities. Dance movements imitated the movements and\n\n58\n\nrhythms of the animals, and the dancers wore the skins or other parts of the animal to assume its spirit and\n\nappease it for hunting, killing, and eating it. Animism is based on the belief that every object, even inanimate ones, has a soul or spirit; therefore the entire universe is connected and alive.\n\nMask Dances\n\nThe shaman and members of the community performed mask dances as part of fertility and spiritual rites. People wore masks, which they believed intensified magic powers, as disguises to enter the spirit world. The mask allowed the dancer to take on another spirit, thereby transcending the body. As a symbol of alienation, it transformed or invoked the supernatural. During a masked dance, the people lost their own identities and took on another’s. A mask was considered to be a link between the living and the dead and a connection to the supernatural world. The masks that depicted supernatural entities were often larger than life.\n\nTrance Dances\n\nTrance dances allowed the shaman or participants to enter the consciousness and gain access to the spirit of a god, cosmic element, animal, or plant. By assuming the spirit, the dancers believed they would become empowered with its abilities and gain courage and insights into the future. In trance dances people danced to the point of exhaustion; their altered state of mind allowed them to enter a trance state. The state could be achieved through religious ecstasy or in response to hypnotic rhythms, hallucinatory drugs, or excessive alcohol, which made the dancers receptive to visions. Bushman rock art shows evidence of the existence of trance dancing as early as 26,000 years ago. The trance dance phenomenon is global, appearing everywhere from Southeast Asia and Africa to North America, and it has recurred throughout history.\n\nDance Design\n\nDance design describes the number of dancers and the formation and other elements of dance structure. Dances ranged from those in which everyone participated or performed an individual dance within the group, to solo performances by the shaman. As society developed, individual responses were replaced by more organized forms of expression, which were more planned than spontaneous. Simple dances were performed in place, using nonlocomotor movements. Complex dances moved from the original spot and returned there, or they shifted to another place within the dance space. Movements included walking, running, leaping, leg swinging, rhythmic clapping, stamping, as well as chanting and singing. Many of the arm and leg positions are apparent on dance scenes shown in rock art (see figure 1.3).\n\n59\n\n60\n\nFigure 1.3 Archaeologist Yosef Garfinkel developed lists of the most frequently seen arm and leg positions in dance scenes depicted in rock art.\n\nFrom DANCING AT THE DAWN OF AGRICULTURE by Yosef Garfinkel, Copyright © 2003. By permission of the University of Texas Press.\n\nDances were performed at specific times and places, some in the daylight and others after sunset or at the full moon. Most dances were performed outdoors, near trees, around bonfires, on mountains, and in sacred places, secret locations, and caves.\n\nCircle Dances\n\nCircle (choral) formations are the oldest group dances. This formation mirrored the design of the society’s huts and was generally performed around a person, tree, fire, or sacred object. The circle provided group togetherness and a sense of belonging. The focus was on participation, not performance for spectators.\n\nIn early societies only one gender danced in a circle at one time. As a society matured, two circles formed, with men on the inside and women on the outside; the men would dance first, then the women would dance. The next progression was for both circles to dance at the same time. A third circle was added for children. The number of circles increased up to 10, and they moved in either the same or alternate directions. Some dances circled to the right, such as in sun cultures, while death dances moved to the left. Semicircular dances in one or more rows were another variation built on circles and lines. In these dances, the rows of dancers often changed lines or performed independently.\n\nLine Dances\n\nLine dances relate to both choral and serpentine dances. Choral line dances may have originated in communities that built rectangular huts. Serpentine dances have roots in animal dances, such as one that represents a snake. They have been found in prehistoric, ancient, and medieval societies and continue to thrive in the 21st century.\n\n61\n\nOther Dance Formations\n\nColumn and formation dances were most often associated with weapon and military dances. Column dances consist of a series of lines, which, as in semicircular dances, can change places. Labyrinth dances suggest mystery or secret societies and often were associated with initiations.\n\nFew examples of couple dances have been found in ancient art sources. Couple dances and quadrilles (square dances performed by four couples that change places) may have been rooted in fertility. Often these dances included an arch figure in which people moved under each other’s arms, and swords or scarves to chase away evil spirits or to show the resurgence of plant life.\n\nAccompaniment\n\nAccompaniment for early dance consisted of self-accompaniment, music or sounds from others in the group, or musicians. Sound sources included singing, chanting, shouting, and making animal sounds. Dancers created often loud and intense percussive sounds by clapping, snapping their fingers, stamping, and slapping their bodies. Percussive instruments included sticks, rattles, drums, blocks of wood, xylophones made of bones (South Sea Islands), and bone clappers. Other instruments were made from bamboo, clay, animal parts, and other natural resources; they included whistles, flutes, horns, and instruments that resembled a guitar and used animal-sinew strings.\n\nAncient musical artifacts reveal the types of instruments that accompanied dance, but they also uncover many questions. What types of sounds or music accompanied the dance? What was the rhythm, the tempo, and the pitch? Was a particular instrument or music associated with a certain dance, celebration, or event? Who played the instruments—musicians or dancers? These unanswered questions provide much room for speculation about this unique period.\n\nCostumes and Adornment\n\nInnovation in costumes and personal attire "
