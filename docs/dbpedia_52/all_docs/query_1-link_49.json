        "text": "[Video Transcript Start]\n\n[Video presented in English and ASL]\n\nhello everyone good afternoon\n\nmy name is dr carolyn mccaskill and i'm the founding director of the\n\ncenter for black deaf studies and a professor in the deaf studies\n\ndepartment i am so excited that i cannot even share\n\nwith you it's beyond words ecstatic to welcome you all to the\n\nopening kickoff for the center for black deaf studies\n\nthis is our first virtual conversation\n\nand we will be sharing the time with dr glenn anderson can you imagine for the\n\nfirst time hosting a webinar for the center\n\nand we have over 400 people\n\nwho are here with us joining in the conversation first of all we have to tell you all\n\n150 who registered first will get a t-shirt with the center\n\nlogo and we will be hosting periodic events\n\nand you will have other opportunities for others of you to get t-shirts as\n\nwell the t-shirts will be mailed to your home address\n\nbefore i actually get started and proceed with the program i want to welcome a few people\n\nto give some remarks for us the first person i'd like to welcome is president\n\nbobby cordano president cordano will make a few remarks\n\nhello there dr mccaskill it is so wonderful to see your energy\n\njust so great to see your energy because i know this is a conversation we've been\n\ntalking about this idea for quite some time i know you have held this vision for\n\nmany years and here we are you know this is a long time in the making i have to say that and now you'll\n\nprobably hear more stories about just how long this journey has been for dr carolyn mccaskill\n\nand with that we as a community owe our deepest sense of gratitude to you dr\n\nmccaskill for your vision for your leadership and for the many people who have worked\n\nalongside of you and been with you throughout this journey you know i am just very excited to be\n\nhere today and very excited that all of us are a part of this experience hosting this here at gallaudet university\n\ni know that you and our community our black deaf students our staff and faculty community members all over the\n\nworld we all are supporting you and this center on black deaf studies\n\nyou have the full support of our board of trustees including of course our chair dr glenn anderson\n\ni think that this will also be one of his most memorable moments as his time as board chair\n\nas president of the university it is indeed an honor and a moment of humility\n\nfor me to be able to see this center up and running\n\nthe establishment of this black deaf study center is very much in alignment with our new\n\nstrategic vision for gallaudet university we call that the gallaudet promise\n\nexcellence in learning dis and discovery the center for black deaf studies and of\n\ncourse the board and myself as president and our executive team at the university\n\ngenuinely see how the center is so important in supporting two different parts of that plan\n\none is the piece of that plan that relates to our equity and belonging imperative equity and belonging and the\n\nimperative around that focuses on the foundation of ensuring that we are providing\n\nvisual and in-depth understanding and content about equity and diversity multiculturalism\n\nanti-racism and doing all of that work here at gallaudet making sure that everyone feels that sense of belonging\n\nand where people can discover their own identities and explore and understand new things while here the center for\n\nblack deaf studies is already an important place for that work to be happening and to continue to happen as\n\nit has i'll have to admit this is not something new we're just beginning in fact i was in a class yesterday the\n\ndynamics of oppression class and i know dr mccaskill that's just a reflection of the work you've been doing over the\n\nyears leaders such as yourself lindsey dunn and many others have been teaching in this capacity in this area for a\n\nnumber of years and we're just now formalizing your work through the establishment of this center providing\n\nwith you resources visibility and really focusing all of that on your work\n\nthis achieves the goal that we've set out for there's much more that we can learn from this and of course we'll\n\nlearn more about those things as time goes on this is just the beginning around this imperative with the work\n\nhere another part of our strategic plan is a priority that focuses on knowledge production and discovery\n\nas we all know the history related to black deaf people\n\nin this country has not yet been fully explored or documented understood nor discussed not\n\nnearly enough of that has happened to date and that argument that dr mccaskill and\n\nothers have made about the importance of this center is one that we of course realize is so important and there's much\n\nmore work to do what's important for us to see that is while we have this center in place another significant part of that is to\n\nprovide support to our continued work on the memorial for black deaf education\n\nand the history around that in our country and the storytelling related to kendall division two memorial that will\n\nbe established on our campus this center is now an important part of the knowledge and discovery and creation\n\nas it relates to that memorial and it will continue to be that the infrastructure is now being built with\n\nthis center so i want to thank you for your work dr mccaskill this is a commitment that is long-standing for the\n\nuniversity that will deepen the work and understanding within our community and of course this ties in\n\nvery nicely to scholarly work research and community activism all coming\n\ntogether right here in this brand new center for black deaf studies\n\nfor all of our community members individuals who are black and deaf hearing hard of hearing deafblind\n\nmany of them want to share their stories of being members of this community and this is a place for them to be able to\n\ndo that this is a place that we hope people will call home in the much larger\n\nhome that we call gallaudet university i am honored to be here today honored to be a part of this journey with you and i\n\nam ever grateful for the perseverance insistence and tenacity of our community\n\nto work together to do what we've done today in establishing this center i want to recognize that many of our black deaf\n\nleaders many of them have longed for this vision to be a reality it's a long time and are getting to this\n\nmoment but we are here now we are here to support this effort now and going\n\nforward so thank you very much thank you president cordano really\n\nappreciate your support for this effort and also your guiding words\n\nabsolutely next i'd like to welcome\n\nprovost lewis to make a few comments greetings\n\nit's hard to believe that this moment has finally arrived\n\ni had the opportunity to encounter carolyn as a student at gallaudet and at that time we were both students\n\nyet little did we know you know 45 years later or so\n\nwe'd be here i truly appreciate your leadership in this center and it's truly an honor\n\nand i'm quite humbled to be in support of your work\n\nthe support of everybody is what will allow this work to become successful\n\nmyself and economic affairs are in full

a new day that\n\ngallaudet has seen and really today is just an inkling into\n\na step to that aligns with our mission for the university and so when we think about our mission\n\nhere at gallaudet university the university was established\n\nand chartered long ago to educate those students who have\n\nmulticultural backgrounds in making sure that they will excel in their careers in\n\nfields we provide bilingual education for our students and as a result i am\n\nthrilled to be here today and thrilled for everyone in this moment\n\nthinking about dr isaac abula and all the work that he did at the university i\n\nam overjoyed in this moment but i just wanted to just say one little tidbit before i leave for today\n\nthe activities that the center provides will be um support for what we need to\n\ndo and also we think about john lewis in his life he talked about all of us\n\ngetting into that good trouble so that's one of the things that we need to do this is the month that we vote in\n\nnovember so we want to make sure that we are timely in all that we do\n\nand that we continue to work with the vision of the center congratulations dr\n\nmccaskill and all of you who are in

academic organizations we'll sponsor\n\npresentations like you just heard from dean cooby she just mentioned a documentary film good trouble by john\n\nlewis we will be supporting viewing of that we'll be giving more workshops\n\nthat will allow us to have a wider and broader understanding of black deaf\n\npeople and the socio-economic and political system that they have been\n\ninvolved with we also will be offering different programs\n\nand raising funds to support programming for the center\n\nat this time i'd like to share my opening statement with you\n\nas we know this year 2020 has been unprecedented\n\nin many different ways we never would have thought\n\nthat this year would start with a global pandemic such as covet 19. we never could have\n\npredicted that we never could have imagined\n\nthe unfortunate and tremendously\n\ngripping murder that we witnessed of george floyd on television that has\n\nignited a fire within the black lives matter\n\nmovement and incited a heightened demand for black people in america\n\nto be visible even though 2020 has had all of these unfortunate events it has\n\nforced the world to establish a new norm\n\nwe've been forced to slow down and re-evaluate\n\ndifferent aspects of our lives\n\nblack deaf people are part of a wider and larger population of the deaf community\n\nand black deaf people's history and experience of oppression\n\nthe system of oppression the\n\nsystem of autism that has affected that community\n\nthese people have experienced autism and systemic racism within the\n\nwider deaf community and at gallaudet university as well\n\nthe life changes that we've seen in 2020 have brought with it\n\nan outpouring of deep emotions for the black deaf community\n\nand other marginalized groups as well\n\ntrying to dismantle systemic racism here at gallaudet\n\nas you all know black deaf students at gallaudet have felt very strongly\n\na sense of concern and raised this about the racism at gallaudet\n\nthey have felt that their concerns have been ignored\n\nthey have attempted to partner and create partnerships and relationships\n\nwith the black deaf students which have been supported by some of the faculty and staff members\n\nand advocacy organizations such as nbda national black deaf advocates\n\nand president cordano and the executive team at gallaudet has risen to the\n\nchallenge with their anti-racism efforts at gallaudet\n\nand the new center for black deaf studies is one of the programs\n\nthat has been created to be able to address the anti-racism efforts at gallaudet\n\nacademic affairs the career center the office of equity diversity and\n\ninclusion student affairs are all committed to perpetuating\n\nan anti-racism program to the entire university community\n\nthe center for black deaf studies welcomes opportunities to talk with all of you\n\nand with other leaders in our lecture series and to share the\n\nrich experience of the black deaf community\n\nour stories deserve to be heard and to be visible\n\nand i feel our beloved community will have the healing that it needs through\n\nthese open and honest and mutually respected respectful transparent\n\nconversations that we are continuing to have through these dialogues\n\ni'd like to close with a quote and this quote is by a very famous\n\nbasketball player player kobe bryant\n\ncorrection to the interpretation kareem abdul-jabbar\n\nand he said that racism in america is like dust in the air\n\nit seems invisible you can't notice it until the sun comes in\n\nand then you begin to see it everywhere\n\nand as long as we keep shining the light\n\nwe have a chance of cleaning it\n\nso let's keep shining the light that is important\n\nso now it really is an honor for me to have dr glenn anderson here\n\nhe graduated from gallaudet in 1968 and is our first speaker at cbds\n\nhe is renowned throughout the community for many brown groundbreaking achievements\n\nhe's been a pioneer in the deaf community dr glenn was the first african-american\n\nalumnus of gallaudet to earn a doctoral degree from new york university in 1982.\n\nhe was the second african-american deaf person to be appointed to\n\ngallaudet's board of trustees in 1989\n\nanother black deaf woman named katie brown served on the board of trustees\n\nfor 10 years during the 1970s\n\ndr anderson was the second deaf trustee that was elected chair of the board of\n\ntrustees and he served from 1988 to 1993\n\nand was on the board as chair from 94 to 2005.\n\nhe is an active member in the deaf community an author a current member of the board of directors of nbda\n\nand a former nbda board member and was on that board from 2004 to 2008\n\nand 2015 to 2019. he's the recipient of many numerous\n\nawards and was appointed by the united states president to serve\n\non the national council on disabilities oh i said this piece already sorry about\n\nthat\n\ni'd like to get started now with my interview with dr anderson\n\ndr anderson i've known you for a very very long time\n\nyou're a role model and a leader and a mentor in the deaf community\n\nyou were the first black deaf person to earn a phd in the deaf community in our\n\nview and that really encouraged other black deaf people\n\nto go above and beyond the limits that have been set for them by racist\n\ninstitutions black deaf people historically have been told by institutions that they\n\nwere not capable of receiving advanced degrees\n\nand as you know i went to the alabama school for the\n\nnegro deaf and i never even thought about attending\n\ncollege and i was encouraged to think about going to trade school or\n\nvocational school and that was really the choices that i had\n\ncosmetology fixing hair\n\ndoing sewing and so forth cooking that was the extent of what i was encouraged\n\nto do fortunately my principal from the alabama\n\nalabama school for the negro death i will never forget her bless her soul\n\nshe saw a difference in me and my sister and she introduced to us the idea that\n\nwe could push the boundaries miss riser was very encouraging to us\n\nand i clearly remember meeting you when i was an undergraduate student\n\nand i was so inspired because in alabama i had never\n\nmet a role model\n\nso i have a question for you what inspired you to push those boundaries\n\nand to become the first black deaf person to get a phd what is that meant to you to know\n\nthat your accomplishments have really inspired so many others\n\ndr glenn\n\ni'm wondering if i can change the video here\n\ni'm not able to see dr glenn\n\nah now we can see you can you see me okay yes i can see you\n\njust fine okay i can see your screen although it's just a little bit smaller now\n\n[Music] first of all i have to say\n\na heartfelt congratulations to you my sister thank you so much\n\nthis is a huge honor for you\n\nmy to be the person that inspired you um is just really really heartfelt for me and\n\ni have to say that the timing feels absolutely right it is right for this\n\nand i can see that with your leadership this center will absolutely take off and\n\nflourish it truly will awesome now as far as answering your question\n\nabout you know the boundaries when i look back i didn't necessarily\n\nhave all the dreams and aspirations that you might think my goal\n\nwas to simply get a master's degree and to be gainfully employed\n\nbut some of the things that influenced me one of the one of the things that did with the fact that my mom was not\n\ncollege educated and the story was that the children\n\nalways have to do better than their parents my dad had this regular job my mom worked in the kitchen and that's the\n\nkind of upbringing that i had another factor was i arrived at\n\ngallaudet after being a student at a hearing university when i got to gallaudet\n\ni had opportunities to engage in a lot of things that were outside academics you know extracurricular activities\n\nsbg the buffing blue being a part of these student organizations i never imagined i could be in a\n\nleadership role performing those tasks until i got to gallaudet\n\nyou know i was thinking about being a pe teacher and wondering about what i can\n\ndo to provide to the community and after reflection i realized that i could do more than just in the field of pe\n\ni went to graduate school in arizona and at that time there were not many deaf phd's\n\nyou can count on hand how many there were i think i only were i was only aware of\n\ntwo deaf phds at the time and they told me that you know what you're next and that was the seed that\n\nthey constantly planted in me i thought to myself no way\n\nthat won't happen but it wasn't until later on when i moved to detroit and i worked for\n\nvocational rehab it just so happened that one of the staff members\n\napproached me and asked if i had any interest in pursuing a phd and working at nyu\n\nso there i got the opportunity and of course to me i had to make sure i\n\nseized every moment that's how it all started\n\nit's interesting how those seeds got planted and then they were planted in you and you planted\n\nthem in me as well yeah absolutely correct\n\ni understand that you grew up on the south side of chicago\n\ncan you tell us a little bit about your experience growing up in chicago\n\nsure so where i grew up in chicago was really\n\nthe heart of the black kind of population we had flourishing black businesses\n\nyou know notable churches in the neighborhood there was actually a theater called the\n\nregal theater and at that time no motown had really started to take off\n\nand this is at late 50s early 60s and from my home i was able to walk four\n\nshort blocks to that regal theater and i would often attend and watch james\n\nbrown the isley brothers the temptations all perform\n\nso it was quite culturally rich to grope in that neighborhood\n\nand in addition to that my father we lived near the chicago white sox\n\nbaseball park we were on 46 and it was on 35th in\n\nchicago and once in a while my dad would try to go to the white sox games but\n\nwe actually had a different uh area that people sought to go to but there was a\n\nlot of white people there and in that area there were a lot of black pro baseball players at the negro\n\nleague so we've got folks like hank aaron other notable athletes and we would drive over\n\nthere to where the negro league played and i really cherished that experience\n\nsomething that meant a lot to me was you know thinking about how there were only a couple of us deaf folks in the\n\nneighborhood and we would come together and play ball and there was one of these guys who was hard of hearing and he\n\ncould be on the phone and he would kind of coordinate which playgrounds we would go to and then we\n\nwould all get in the car play basketball and face all these neighborhood kids and in doing that we\n\ngot to learn how to play as a team it was because we were deaf we knew how to play as a team against hearing\n\nindividuals that were kind of um you know selfish and sometimes they would get so upset and\n\ntry to chase me off the court you know and i said it's not unfair because we're not necessarily better\n\nthan you wow thank you for sharing that experience with us\n\nbefore you were chair of the gallaudet board of trustees from 1989 to 2005\n\nwhat are some of the most rewarding and challenging experiences that you had\n\nduring that time leading the board of trustees\n\nwell as a member from 1989 to 2005 i was board chair from 94\n\nto 2005 and one of the experiences that stays\n\nwith me the most is the election i think it was february 94\n\nand then we had a follow-up meeting in march with king over in san francisco california so in\n\nthat meeting we got to talk about the agenda uh what we had you know planned in the works as far as it relates to the board\n\nand eventually there was a letter that was given to me and i ended up reading this letter\n\nand realized that you know what he doesn't have time for gallaudet he struck me as you know someone who\n\nwould shrug his shoulders and you know said that it doesn't hurt to just try\n\nso a month later after a couple of kings emails\n\nthere was one that said glenn\n\nget a haircut the time is coming and i recall my first board meeting that\n\nthat was the experience i had i had to stand up and give a presentation in front of everybody\n\nand get honorary degree so you can imagine how nervous i must have been at that time\n\nto have someone with such distinct right next to me absolutely\n\nso i did contribute as a member of the board and as board chair and at least i hope that i did i feel\n\nlike i helped at least open the door for opportunity for more of our people of color\n\nto you know join the board and actively engage whereas prior to my involvement\n\nwe weren't that noticeable you know there might have been a handful maybe one or two\n\nuh sparingly but it was after my engagement that we were able to open that door up and have more people call\n\non board\n\nwe were able to achieve a capital campaign that's something that gallaudet had never\n\nbeen able to achieve before that point there was some resistance by members in\n\nthe community for that capital campaign and it was a great deal of work that had to be done to convince people that this\n\nwas the time to do so and i was successful in that and we got 40 million dollars as a result\n\nand a lot of those funds were earmarked for the ik jordan student academic center and the renovations that\n\nhappened there so definitely a positive result to be had and as you can see the benefit is that\n\nwe've been able to beautify our campus indeed it is a beautiful campus and do\n\nyou feel that those have been some of your greatest contributions absolutely i do\n\nawesome now i know you've experienced\n\nall phases of gallaudet including systemic racism\n\nin 2005 you stepped down from the chair of the board of trustees\n\nto apply to become gallaudet's first black pres black deaf president\n\nhowever you were interviewed but not invited to the second round of interviews\n\neven though you had supervised the first deaf president i king jordan for so\n\nmany many years can you share with us how you felt during that time\n\nwhat was the most significant impact of that experience on you\n\nas a black deaf leader\n\nsure the fact that king continued for about\n\n18 years as president meant that the board didn't really have\n\nexperience you know managing a presidential search and i think that's an important point to\n\nnote you know had the cumulative experiences\n\nbeen different i think we would have seen a different outcome you know i think the feeling of being\n\nstuck was probably normal at that time no one wanted to make any definitive\n\ndecisions but you know i felt like we were able to do so and you got to understand that at that time\n\ngallaudet you know did have pressure or a big push towards having more diversity\n\ni think this was 2003 to 2004. and dr isaac igbola was actually a part\n\nof that effort it seemed to me at the time that we were moving the right direction\n\nbut then you know we were informed that you know the selection was not made for the final three\n\nanother challenge was that a lot of people who applied for that presidential position you know a presidential\n\nposition would have 20 to 30\n\nmore years of experience\n\nthe interview itself only lasted about two hours within that limited time frame how can\n\nyou expect to know the whole person after interview in merely two hours\n\nthat's not enough time to allow for someone to recognize the values that someone has\n\nand of course you've got to go along with whatever the priorities were at the time but you know i admit that you know\n\nat my experience working in arkansas you know i was willing to just look for the next opportunity you know if i wasn't\n\nselected because i knew that there's a lot of other opportunities out there\n\nyou know shortly after i wasn't selected my son made it to the nfl\n\nand you know hometown\n\noh it was a hometown experience there was a lot of benefits that came to me um\n\nin a lot of positive things despite the fact that i wasn't selected\n\nnow you know at that time there were a lot of emotions because the community felt so strongly\n\nabout this issue let me move on to another question\n\nthough there's been a lot of talk both negative and positive in the\n\ncommunity after the board announced that you were returning as the chair of the\n\nboard of trustees and that again has been both positive and negative\n\nsome people have been thrilled and there have been different emotions\n\nranging from elation to bewilderment\n\nabout the news that you were returning to the chair's position\n\nother people questioned the board and wanted to know what was the reasoning behind having you return\n\nand your decision to come back particularly after you supported in bda's letter that\n\ncalled for president cordano to resign\n\nand you and i had quite a lengthy discussion about that and you said that you felt\n\nseeing some of the negative comments was there but can you share your\n\nfeelings about that and what that meant to you what would you like for people to know\n\nabout your decision to come back to the board what's your vision as chair\n\nso i think the opening remarks you shared today truly captured the essence in the context\n\nof you know everything that's been happening in our community\n\nthere's been long-standing struggles um you know we've been seeking breakthrough and\n\ni was invited by the members of the board you know to a retreat and at that\n\ntime we were able to engage and it was very obvious to me that they recognized that there had been some\n\nleadership issues that were quite notable in addition to that the board was you\n\nknow actively seeking out some leadership so as a result of all of that i was asked i didn't step forward and\n\nvolunteer myself but in fact i was asked if i wouldn't mind to return and that's what i did\n\nas we know gallaudet university is you know roughly 156 years old\n\nthe notion of systemic racism you know plus the time frame of 156\n\nyears you know that's not something that you can quickly just dust off\n\nyou know how how we go actually about doing that is the next question and it requires some\n\nlevel of work to be done at gallaudet and it's not just limited to gallaudet but some work also has to happen\n\nexternally because if you just working on it you know internally that doesn't prove\n\nsuccessful and if you only focus on the external aspects that doesn't prove to be successful either\n\nit's by focusing you know on both you know providing that internal support that will allow for that success and i\n\ndid so because i'm able to um i've always been one to stand up for the community\n\nand to me you know it's just a matter of fact\n\nnow in the work that i've been able to do over the past 50 years you can see that i have that track\n\nrecord because i stand in line and support the community you know people can always have their\n\nown perspectives which is fine in fact it's normal for people have to have different perspectives\n\nbut even with that i feel like you know i i tried my best to ensure that we had\n\npriorities for the board's anti-racism plan\n\nand they are dedicated to this so the hope is that we can achieve a\n\ndegree of success and i have a good uh feeling that we will\n\nbetween the board the university faculty and staff you know everybody who\n\nis engaging and committed to this effort makes me believe that\n\nso you're talking about work both inside and outside in gallaudet and\n\ncommunity exactly understood okay\n\nanother question that i have for you and that has been raised within the community is about whether or not you're\n\nfunctioning simply as a board chair emeritus with no real\n\nvoting rights or authority to be able to enact change at gallaudet\n\nhow do you respond to those concerns understandable\n\ngenerally speaking in the board meetings it's not only you know gallaudet but\n\nalso chairs of other universities that tend not to vote\n\nusually the chair will foster cohesiveness uh amongst the group and kind of serve as a\n\nguiding resource for those meetings so i could be tied into that role\n\nand ultimately one needs to also recognize that there is a certain authority within the board and the chair\n\nis representation of the board therefore de facto has authority\n\nso that's that's what it is\n\nokay all right i'm nearing the end of my uh formal list\n\nof questions and i could learning much more about you\n\nevery day and about the work and contributions that you've made which have been\n\noutstanding to say the least and you are leaving a great legacy\n\nhow would you like people to remember you though\n\nwell i have to admit i don't usually think that way\n\ni'm the type of person who is known to answer the call to service\n\nthat's always been my theme especially uh for the gallaudet commencement in 2017 if you recall\n\nand i used andrew foster as an example at that time you know the reason that he went to\n\nafrica is because he felt that he was called to serve and he created\n\nyou know a multitude of schools in in that region and\n\nthe goal is to ultimately build a strong deaf community and that was his call and i feel like that stands true for myself\n\ntoo to service\n\nwonderful awesome do you have any final comments that\n\nyou'd like to add or things that you want to share with the community well i think now it's your time to serve\n\nall right so i do appreciate you taking the time to respond to my list of questions and to\n\nshare your wisdom with us and i think this helps the community to\n\nhave a better understanding of your role as chair\n\nand your vision where you'd like to see us go and to help gallaudet to continue to grow\n\nso now i'm going to open up the floor we have time for people in the community who may have\n\nquestions for us in the chat\n\nso if anyone has questions it's q a time\n\nso i do see one question that's asked about the website for the center for\n\nblack deaf studies and yes that website has been\n\nestablished and i believe that the email is the\n\ncenter for black deaf studies at gallaudet.edu\n\nand if you check that you should be able to find it\n\nalso i see another question for you dr anderson\n\nand this person says they work with many uh black indigenous and people of color\n\nmembers of the community who don't aren't doing as well and i'd like to they aren't performing\n\nas well as their white peers many of them have so much potential but what do you say to these children who are not\n\npushing themselves to grab the opportunities to take their education seriously\n\nand to do their best what message do you have for them as they need motivation\n\ncertainly um you know throughout our development in\n\nlife obstacles are something that we can never avoid if we try to remove them you know even\n\nstill another obstacle will come in its place\n\nin my time at gallaudet i didn't have any support system none at all\n\nyou know uh there was no black deaf student union we didn't have organized you know black\n\nfaculty or staff everybody was white\n\neveryone's cultural experience was far different than mine and how i was able to survive and\n\nnavigate my way through gallaudet you know all four years\n\nwas from the realization that i'm driving my own bus\n\ni'm not a passenger in anyone else's vehicle you know because they might be going to a place where i maybe don't like that\n\ndestination so internally there was this desire\n\nto be self-sufficient and not have to rely on other people or you know risk someone else kind of\n\ncontrolling my path or you know someone that i didn't want\n\nto be around influencing the way that i think i had my own train to run and i had to\n\nmake sure that you know i was the the commandeer i was driving my own bus\n\nnow there's far more people of color on campus compared to at the time that i was at gallaudet all these key positions\n\nhave people of color but you got to understand i saw none of that\n\nso things are very different it's a different picture from what happened in the past to now business\n\ndiversity when i was here as a student in the 70s to 2020 it's an awes awesome difference\n\nthe opportunities are there and i like your metaphor about driving your own bus\n\ni love that mm-hmm absolutely all right i see another question here\n\nthere are more questions coming through\n\ni'm actually not seeing other questions where are the next questions\n\nit's two o'clock\n\nyes i see in the q a box i believe the questions for you\n\nif you look at the q a box oh there's a question that's asking me what i would like to see\n\nin terms of contributions and having more courses in black deaf\n\nhistory and culture definitely i would like to see the black deaf studies center\n\ngrow and expand and as i mentioned earlier\n\ni'm working on a proposal to add a black deaf studies\n\nminor to the curriculum at this point we only have one course now but we are now working on\n\nbecoming an actual minor that will require 18 credits\n\nand offering courses like black deaf history\n\nblack asl we do have a book on black asl\n\nand we have taught a bl i taught a black asl special topics course once and i've\n\nbeen asked about that course in terms of black asl trying to teach\n\nblack asl as a thing in and of itself that language is acquired through\n\ninteraction but in terms of the course and explaining the structure of the language\n\nthat could be done and that would be one of the courses that would be in the minor\n\ntalking about black deaf oral history and literature\n\nhaving a black deaf seminar in researching the black deaf community\n\nhaving some electives as well one or two perhaps where students will be able to take through the consortium\n\nhaving a black deaf education course so we're thinking about about six courses and we do have to go\n\nthrough program review and approval by our cge our congress of undergraduate\n\neducation or graduate undergraduate education to add this minor in black deaf studies\n\nand also the goal will be to add other positions\n\ni would be liking to advertise other positions for example\n\nan assistant director so that position is now being reviewed\n\nby hr and soon it will be posted\n\non our gallaudet website so people will be able to apply for the assistant director position\n\nyes and i believe there's also another message in the chat box\n\nthe goal for the center in the next few months\n\nis to continue to have our lecture series\n\nand as i mentioned before we talked about support and you know that video that i mentioned the documentary from\n\ncongressman new lewis called good trouble we will be sponsoring that and i\n\ncannot wait to see it\n\nand i'm going to take advantage of the opportunity to announce to you now some of you have heard about the kindle 2\n\ndivision 2 event and how\n\nkendall was segregated and the black students were\n\nkicked out of gallaudet and forced to go to school in baltimore\n\nmaryland well the mother mrs miller\n\nmrs louise miller had a black deaf son and she filed a lawsuit\n\nagainst kendall and gallaudet so that her son could be accepted as a student\n\nnow this is really historic we have a rich history and so many\n\npeople are not aware of how rich this history is this actually\n\nhappened before brown brown versus the board of education\n\nour next moment in the history center is going to be having a lecture\n\nfrom the miller family to be able to talk about what their\n\nexperiences were like the mother filed the lawsuit they won\n\nthe students were brought back to kendall from\n\nmaryland here and brought to washington dc and the miller family\n\nare very grassroots and are really wonderful and they're still\n\naround and they're willing to be a part of our lex next lecture on november 4th\n\nand that'll be from 1 to 2 30 at the same time so please do look for our announcement about that event we're very\n\nexcited about that i think there's another question that\n\ncame up in the q a\n\npeople are asking about workshops or training in summer programs\n\nso that people will be able to continue their virtual education\n\nduring the summer we will continue to offer workshops and training\n\nup to june and we'll take a break in june and start again in august and continue through the\n\nend of the year so do look for our announcements about those\n\ni do see another question\n\nso we now have a question for both you and i dr anderson\n\none of the students who was the former vice president of bsu\n\nsaid that she's had an opportunity to talk with many\n\nblack deaf students and she feels like they have a lack of support at gallaudet for them\n\nand wants to know what advice do we have for those students to continue when their motivation\n\nis nearing its end their motivation is nearing its end and\n\nwhat advice do we have for them communicate your concerns to the appropriate program\n\nmanager make sure to continue uh to express your\n\nconcerns or any feelings that you have i say don't give up\n\nlook for the resources that are available for you and those students and one of those\n\none of the goals of our center is to become a resource place where\n\npeople are able to be in touch with us for different kinds of support financial\n\nsupport scholarships glenn we have your scholarship dr\n\nanderson we have the andrew foster scholarship we have isaac agboola scholarship fund\n\nisaac at bula scholarship the linwood smith scholarship so the goal is to help\n\nstudents continue with their education\n\nand another goal i really when i look back on my own\n\nexperience like i mentioned that you were\n\nmy role model and anytime i felt dejected or as if i\n\nwas ready to give up i felt that i could be in touch with you\n\nand share with what you what was going on and you always helped and encouraged me\n\nand to find someone to whom they could express their feeling\n\nsomeone who would listen to you and offer you support\n\nbecause people need emotional and moral support to not give up and so one of our\n\nother goals in the center is to set up a mentoring program because students need guidance\n\nmore than just books they need the emotional and moral\n\nsupport so that is another goal for us let me see what other questions we have\n\nthis question is for you dr anderson what do you want to see in black deaf studies\n\nwhat would you like to make sure is not left out of the discourse\n\ni'd like to see growth in nbda\n\ni think lindsey dunn and i have had the opportunity to write an article you know in sign language studies\n\nand in doing so we talked about the impact that nbda has our community from\n\nthe different eras the 80s the 90s and so on and what we witnessed was you know\n\nevolvement people going up the ranks career-wise uh seeing a steady flow of career advancement\n\npublications that's the kind of thing that we would like to see more of we want to see more writing we want to see\n\nmore publications and we want to see more videos recorded document of our stories\n\nso that we may pass that on to the next generation and they can continue to influence others in the future\n\ni agree with that one of the other goals for the center\n\nis to be a repository for films and articles and publications\n\nto live in the center in a way that has all of the information\n\nrelated to the black deaf experience psychologically socially\n\nthe entire corpus to live within our center and we do\n\nsupport that another question\n\nwe both have emphasized the importance of the black death experience and how important it is to document that\n\ngiven the impact of covet 19 on black community members particularly elderly\n\nblack people do you have any suggestions for how we can support these members of our\n\ncommunity given their increased risk\n\nin this pandemic there's so much to do\n\nand i hesitate to ask this\n\ngiven the breadth and depth of your important work during these times\n\nthat said do you have any plans to prioritize documenting the narratives of the\n\nelderly black deaf community and if so are there ways we can support such\n\nefforts of cbds\n\nthat preservation of history and preserving the stories the oral\n\nhistories absolutely that is one of our goals for this center\n\nto document the oral history of black deaf people and their experiences\n\nwe need all of the help that we can get so if people have stories\n\nor videos that they want to share we would be very grateful and be happy\n\nto be able to store that in our center\n\nanother question again for both of us\n\nthis person says that they are indigenous and latinx\n\nand they want to know how their communities and themselves in an individual can\n\nprovide support to black communities in the future and what do the black communities want\n\nto see from the indigenous and latinx communities\n\ni think collaboration different efforts in working together\n\nfor the indigenous and latinx communities i would like to really open dialogue about how we can work with one\n\nanother and what are the needs in your\n\ncommunities and how we can partner with one another\n\ni agree it makes me think about writing\n\nanytime we're writing our stories you want to make sure that we're mindful of what should be included\n\nso we can co-host workshops together we don't have to just host workshops\n\nfocused only on the black deaf experience or focused only on the latinx experience we can integrate both of our experiences\n\nand provide workshops together yes i definitely agree with that\n\nthis is a question for you dr anderson do you plan to write your memoir\n\nwell you know i might do that maybe i will you have a lot to say\n\nso there is a lot more that you haven't shared so i really you\n\ndefinitely need to write your memoir\n\ni suppose the first one in line to buy your book\n\nyes um i have given it some thought i have wonderful that's wonderful to hear\n\nyou know hopefully at some point in the future i'll have more time to do that\n\nokay let's see\n\ni think that may be pretty much it and we may be finished with the questions\n\nin wrapping up this has really been a wonderful experience and i really want to thank\n\nyou dr anderson there are not words to express the depth\n\nof my appreciation to have you as our first speaker for our lecture series thank you for\n\ngiving up your time i know you're going to be teaching a class today right\n\ni am wow so thank you thank you thank you\n\nfor

forth the black deaf community was not insulated from any of that\n\nit's painful really painful but we have to address this pain and we can't just push it away\n\nif we look the other way then we'll never have the opportunity to heal\n\nwhat does this memorial mean for the black deaf community\n\nit's really important for the black deaf community especially when black deaf students arrive at gallaudet for many of them it is a part\n\nof their dream and upon seeing this memorial it can be an inspirational force that lets\n\nthem know that gallaudet recognizes and values the black deaf community a feeling of welcome\n\nif you are interested in donating here's the link to do so\n\nthank you\n\nhello it is my pleasure to introduce to you the story of the miller family the miller\n\nfamily includes mother louise b miller and her four children kenneth carol gerald and justin\n\nall three of her sons are deaf and her daughter carol is hearing louise b miller's story\n\nis one of courage and tireless advocacy it changed the history of deaf education in this country\n\nit was mrs miller who decided to enroll her son kenneth in our very own kindle school in 1946\n\nher son was denied enrollment because he was black however mrs miller didn't stop her fight and she\n\npersisted until finally in 1952 she decided to lead a class action lawsuit against the washington\n\ndc board of education to fight for the right of her son to be educated here at kendall school\n\nmiller mrs miller won that lawsuit that then forced the establishment of the kindle school\n\ndivision 2 for negroes which was the name at that time that was the first lawsuit that started the\n\nprocess of dismantling the doctrine upheld by the supreme court decision plessy versus ferguson\n\nthe doctor known as separate but equal by winning the lawsuit it set the precedent\n\nfor dismantling that legal argument and lent support to the final decision by the supreme\n\ncourt in the brown versus board of education in 1954. very few people understand the\n\nconnection between louise b miller's fight for her deaf son kenneth and the success of\n\nthe supreme court case brown versus board of education this family has shown great patience\n\nand support of this community as we assess and reflect on our past mistakes\n\nand looking at ourselves today to further examine our current actions and supporting our movement\n\nto create a better and more just future for all of our deaf children especially black\n\nlatina latino latinx native american asian pacific and those of diverse identities\n\nwe are proud that the family is here with us to continue to share their stories\n\nfor us to come to understand our history and what we need to continue to wrestle with and reflect\n\nupon and further understand i remain grateful to the miller family for building their relationship\n\nwith us during the last few years i am proud that they are here with us as a community\n\nand so very grateful to them i now look to dr carolyn mccaskill to lead this celebration\n\nof the miller family story the center for black deaf studies will be a place to centralize\n\ndocument and gather the stories of the history of the kindle division ii school thank you\n\nequality has been missing from my life\n\nokay\n\nhi we are ready\n\nyes we certainly are i

the program\n\nthe next portion let's proceed with the interview video clip\n\nand we can proceed that with an interview of carol miller please if we can have carol miller\n\nand now i'm absolutely thrilled to be able to interview each individual member of the member of the miller family first of all i have here with me kenneth miller so kenneth\n\ntell me a little bit about your name about yourself this is your name sign correct yes\n\nand are you deaf or hard of hearing i've been deaf since three years old three years old i see\n\nand you learned sign from your family or exactly how did you start learning sign language\n\nwell i learned that the philadelphia school it was an oral school for the deaf\n\nand then later at kendall school that's where i went and that's when i changed from oral to sign\n\nlanguage and i use sound language ever since ah so are you retired now you're still working what are\n\nyou up to i retired from my job at the washington post after 47 years wow how many years since 1957\n\ni was 16 years old 16. i went on to graduate i worked part-time and then eventually full-time\n\nin 1965 at the washington post so in total i've worked there for 47 years of my career and then\n\ni went to retire 47 years wow so what do you do now with your free time i spend time at\n\nhome resting and spending time with my family and my brother so did you grow up um did you graduate\n\nthrough the kindle school i started in 1952 at philadelphia school and then moved to maryland\n\ndid you remember like some of the things that you learned while you were in school no\n\nnothing huh you really weren't able to learn anything in that environment that's how school\n\nwas at that time there wasn't much being learned in the fall of 1954 i learned a little bit\n\nat the philadelphia school the instruction was good but at the kennel school it was lousy\n\nwhat was the difference between the two schools kendall and philadelphia even though it was the\n\nphiladelphia school was oral was good education but at kendall i didn't learn anything there\n\nso you wanted to go to a school you wanted to get a good education your mother absolutely wanted that for you so she filed a lawsuit do you remember anything about that i don't i was young\n\nat that time right you were pretty young so you commuted to philadelphia to attend that school\n\nand then later on you moved back to washington d.c and then went to the kindle school so how did that feel so i went to kendall school after philadelphia and i was just so so shocked i just\n\nsat there and didn't learn much that was 1952 to 1954 sometime there but again didn't learn much\n\nmost of the time we were just playing around so did you miss the school there in philadelphia\n\nyeah my mother paid tuition i think three thousand dollars for school wow that was quite expensive\n\nat that time so kendall was a segregated school in the past do you remember that\n\ni do 1952 i remember at the time being a commuting student going back and forth to school\n\nhow did it feel to have to commute to school i would commute on a cab and i\n\ndid that for about a year so you wrote a cab how was that it felt weird it felt very odd\n\nthe cab would drop off my different friends at their houses how old were at that time i was 11.\n\nah 11 years old wow and then uh from 11 to 12. then you moved\n\nhmm so did you know anything about the fact that it was segregated there were\n\nblack areas and white areas i don't know anything about that\n\ni think it was when i was around 18 i started to notice but before that i never really realized it\n\nso when you begin to notice what is it that caught your attention well i wasn't learning much just playing around that was it right but then you said when you\n\nbecame 18 or 19 that's when you started to realize that there was segregation between black people and white people and apparently today do you still see that segregation happening\n\nnot as much before there was segregation but now there's been integration uh so\n\nyou see that integration now yeah it started mixing students in 1954.\n\nso in 1954 there was more segregation than there is now\n\nin 1954 uh there was decent well that's when it was integration i remember outside it would be\n\ncold we would try to learn a lot when the children and the different school white school they learned\n\na lot but at kendall we didn't learn much but after 1954 things got better for education\n\nso do you think it got better that people have a better life that black people have a better\n\nlife because of the black lives movement or you think it's the same that it really hasn't improved\n\nblack lives matter movement\n\nall right well is there anything else you'd want to share about that\n\nwell i want to share that i played you know sports back in the day i played basketball and i was on wrestling really really were you you a champion in that how'd you do in sports\n\nyeah i actually won a wrestling championship when i defeated someone who was much larger than me\n\nhad the right technique and i was able to grapple him down and i won nice\n\noh so you had a very high rank nice yeah i think the gentleman's name was frank whitebeat might have been from canada\n\noh so you wrestled somebody by the name of frank in one all right yeah\n\nso did you have some thoughts you'd like to share with us gerald yes before black the black lives\n\nmatter movement i even think about martin luther king and during that time you know i had a pretty good life after martin luther king passed you know i began to wonder and question about you know why\n\nwe had certain issues within our community you know i began to notice how white people marginalize black people in different ways and also just you know being upset about segregation\n\nand not having people recognize my common humanity when i was growing up my one of my best friends\n\nwas white but i still saw segregation at play and then we saw the rise of the kkk and white\n\nsupremacists and so i've come to the realization that sometimes people choose to segregate\n\nthemselves because they dislike each other i think black lives matter has helped to improve things\n\nso you do think that the black lives matter movement has improved things i do you know for 500 years black people have been oppressed and marginalized and it's time for\n\na change we have to learn to accept white people have to learn how to accept black people and what\n\nwe want and desire you know sometimes those riots need to happen because that's when people wake up\n\nso do you think with what's happening with the black lives movement now where more white people are becoming more aware of what's going on and they're focusing more attention on this matter do\n\nyou think that's happening i do i actually don't believe in marches like i think sometimes marches\n\nare appropriate but to be heard you sometimes need to do something different because people will\n\nhave a march and then everyone goes back home and forgets everything the next day sometimes people listen to riots better because properties are being damaged\n\ni want to go back to talking about kindle school do you remember stories from your mom and how your mom actually had to fight for your brother to have a better education\n\nand also fought on behalf of other black deaf children there were 24 in that school do you\n\nremember your mom talking about that at all my mom actually passed away when i was 15 so\n\ni wasn't privy to very much when i was younger but later over time when i became an adult i realized\n\nher tireless efforts impacted the black deaf community otherwise you know kenneth would have\n\ngone to school in baltimore and you know we had a right to be educated and i think that's something\n\nthat my mom became a champion for um so when you think about uh what happened with your mom\n\nand what happened in terms of her support of those other 23 students\n\ncan you comment on that i remember robert millborn came to see my mom at home to thank her and i\n\ndidn't quite know why he did that later i came to the realization that she had been such an\n\nadvocate for black deaf students to be educated in the district she bought that lawsuit won it\n\num you know against the dc board of education and so without her where would we be i am happy\n\nthat my mom did what she did so that we would have the opportunity to learn yes we're proud\n\nof your mom as well you know if you had been able to meet her she was such a sweet lady\n\nso when you think about gallaudet hosting this interview for your family as well as\n\nsetting up the kindle division 2 memorial project what comes to mind i'm very appreciative\n\nyou know we have to be cognizant of the events that have occurred in the past when i think of president elstad i don't really care for him he denied my brother\n\nkenneth the opportunity to attend the school the kendall school here on campus\n\nand so that's why kenneth had to go to philadelphia that makes no sense whatsoever\n\nyou know i remember we used to practice um at gallaudet on campus in front of the old\n\ngym and president elstad would be outside when we left our practice just looking at us he'd be there week after week and so i didn't that didn't really sit well with me at the time\n\ni'm very happy that we see shifts happening in our community to make things better\n\nare there any concluding thoughts you'd like to share with us\n\nyou know i would love to see a black deaf person as president of gallaudet someday\n\nbobby is great but i would love to have a black deaf president as we think about mbda\n\nand also i really would appreciate having elstad auditorium renamed i don't think it should honor\n\npresident elstad because he was not a supporter of black deaf students being educated\n\nhere on campus so we know that there have been inequalities that have been perpetuated and we need to work for equality in your opinion do you think things have\n\nimproved for the better gallaudet or not i think they have improved for the better\n\nwell thank you i want to thank you so much for being with us i really appreciated talking with you so you experienced segregated schools didn't you yes do you remember when your brother\n\nuh went to the segregated school what do you remember from that time and what he went through\n\nwell i was little so i really didn't understand what was going on for him in school you know so\n\ni really had no idea about segregation i found out as time went on can you give me an example\n\ni found out the discrimination that my brother went through because it was segregated he had to go all the way to philadelphia instead of coming here to kindle the philadelphia school\n\nwas mixed there were black kids Jewish kids white kids but here it can do it was segregated\n\nand so it was a process to get it integrated so you remember him commuting to philadelphia and\n\nthen moving back how did that make you feel justin well it was different it was different i remember\n\ncoming home for christmas and thanksgiving and win school clothes like for the summer\n\nyou grew up in washington dc i'm sure you saw a lot in terms of the civil rights movement race\n\nriots tell me a little bit about that place yes i grew up in a black neighborhood and i didn't\n\nsee white people very often i remember sometimes going into a store and seeing a white person and they would be watching me as i was shopping i was thinking why are they looking at me\n\nbut my father was an officer so it really didn't bother me i didn't let it bother me\n\nso when martin luther king was killed i was actually out in the streets that day and there were riots and upheaval all over um and\n\nmy wife had just uh gave birth to one of our children and i remember my sister saying you need\n\nto get home you need to get home and i said i walk home and she said it needs you need to be safe and so i started walking home and as i got close to my home a police car pulled up and asked me what i\n\nwas doing i said i'm going home and they motioned for me to get in the car so i did i got in the car\n\nand i was about 18 years old at that time and they said now go in the house you know and they\n\nwouldn't leave until i went into the house they wanted to make sure i was going to go into the house so what that experience taught me was that segregation in the past it was very hard for us\n\nto deal with as a people and when martin luther king was killed and there was rioting and all that\n\nupheaval you know if anything like that were ever to happen again i'm going to make sure i stay in the house so you were living in a predominantly black neighborhood now has that neighborhood\n\nchanged um well now there are a lot of restaurants and bars and uh condos and other buildings in the\n\nneighborhood but in the past it was really bad there was a lot of shooting in that area\n\nand because i couldn't hear my sister could hear shooting in the neighborhood and could hear\n\ngunshots um not exactly\n\nyou know to be truthful what i did see though was not good and so you have seen more\n\nwhite individuals move into the area how do you think that has helped to reduce crime or make\n\nthe neighborhood more safe it hasn't i mean white people are moving in but there's still\n\na lot of break-ins there's a lot of property damage there's a lot of theft there's a lot of armed robbery in the area and so there are a few officers there who see who the problem people are\n\nyou know and you can see people have bars on their window and for the ones who don't they're easy targets you know so it hasn't really improved mm-hmm\n\nso i'm been asking you about the kindle school and your upbringing as you look back and reflect\n\non those memories about your experiences at the kindle school would you mind sharing a little bit more with me um i went to kindle school um you know i wanted to have an education\n\nand i went back i was seen as a troublemaker when i went back and my mother really fought for me to stay there for my last year of school\n\num so i did have some problems while i was there um what do you see as the differences between then\n\nand now well the difference is that there was no education in my time you know our opportunities\n\nwere very limited whereas now people actually get an education when they go to school and\n\nit can help them to prepare for the future in my time what it gave me was a very limited education\n\nso justin thank you so much for sharing your stories with me i am wondering if you can\n\ntell me a little bit more about gallaudet recognizing your family your mom's actions\n\nthe kindle school memorial and what that means to you what are your thoughts about this entire\n\nproject well i'm very happy that my mom stood up for us and that she faced the board of education\n\nand told them that their actions were against children and preventing them from getting a good education and my mother fought you know she was a fighter\n\nand i'm very proud of my mother for doing that because she stood up for what was right you know\n\nand every time someone stands up for what is right in terms of education that's a good thing powerful\n\nsuch interesting history and experiences thank you so much for sharing that truly do appreciate\n\nwhat a moving and significant family yes indeed they're truly beautiful and i enjoy\n\nthe opportunity immensely i understand that carol miller is here to also have a conversation\n\nwith you uh carolyn and so at this time we would like to invite miss carol miller to join us\n\nyes indeed and i'm happy that you saw the interview that we did with the three brothers\n\nbut now i'm so excited to interview miss carol\n\nhello miss carol how are you hello\n\ni would like to start with this interview by thanking you for graciously taking the\n\ntime out of your schedule and coming here to interview with us once again\n\nthe first question that i would like to ask you\n\nis about your family can you tell me about your mother and what you remember about your mother\n\nin terms of the lawsuit and story surrounding that was there anything that your mom shared with you\n\nwell come is three years older than i am so uh\n\nwe were not told specifically what was going on but you could pick up the\n\nanguish and the angst around the house about kenneth's education uh how my parents were\n\ntrying to get him into school here and that was not being allowed i remember\n\nthe talk about the school in maryland and my mother taking him there and not wanting to\n\nleave him they said if they if she left him and he started to cry that they would just\n\nput him in a room and just let him cry and he was about five or six years old at that\n\ntime so that was not an option for my mother that's when she brought him home and she decided\n\nthat they would make other arrangements i think they started this process in 1946\n\nthat's the first letter that i have that shares an insight into what was going on so it was almost\n\nit took about six years before kenneth was actually formally educated and that's a\n\nloss for any student and especially one who's going to need some extra support\n\nit was finally decided after all of the ins and outs and the letters back and forth\n\nuh and the denial of his acceptance into kendall that they decided to send him away\n\nto philadelphia and he was eight years old i think he told me he was eight years old at the\n\ntime so i would have been about five maybe five going on six so i remember my brother leaving\n\ni remember the trips going back and forth to pennsylvania to see to see him in school\n\nwe were able to spend holidays together and we went to virginia during the summer and we had\n\nall of the summer together but prior to kenneth getting into school i could see the the impact\n\nthat not being able to communicate effectively he could communicate about certain concrete things\n\nbut as for you know i don't like this i don't want to do that that makes me sad this makes me\n\nhappy those kinds of things were you you're not able to explain fully what's going on\n\nso my grandmother who was a very strong presence in our lives believed that if he just put his mind\n\nto it he could be able to hear and talk so she was not a fan of sign language so when he left\n\nwashington and he went to pennsylvania kenneth came back kenneth was signing\n\nhe was able to communicate with his teachers with his friends and sort of left us behind\n\nafter he went into kendall for the two years that he was there between 52 and 54 when the brown decision was decided\n\nthere was a difference in what was being taught and how the students were being taught\n\nso and i think again that's two more years of losing\n\ni guess a really solid foundation of education and those things do make a difference\n\ni have letters when my mother started writing again\n\nafter the children had been admitted to kendall on a segregated basis that she was noticing that\n\nwhat was presented to the white children or what was presented to the black children was different\n\nand she said wait a minute we need to get things equalized even more so i don't know i'd have to\n\ngo back and look at information to see how that turned out but uh my mother was a homemaker for\n\na while until my grandmother retired and then she went to work she had gone to howard university she\n\nfinished three and a half years there and then she decided she was in love and she had to get married\n\nand grandmother said i will send you as long as you don't get married and when she did\n\nuh she left howard so she had three and a half years at howard university she started out as\n\na music major because she played the piano she signed in the choir she was an excellent swimmer\n\nbut she left howard and she eventually went to work in the federal government and daddy went\n\nto work for the police department we lived in the same house on t street with my grandmother\n\nthat she had purchased way back in 1920 and kenneth and justin are still living there\n\nso i've rambled on is there anything you you would like for me to share\n\ni i'm just excited to hear more of the story i enjoy every minute that you share with us about\n\nyour mom she seems to have been a wonderful woman i wish absolutely i could have met\n\nher in person but she is gone and no longer with us but as we think about her memories\n\nthey live on through her children and she has that legacy that continues so i really do appreciate\n\nyou sharing that miss carol i could stay here all day i could listen to you all day i love the\n\nstories i would never tire of it i do want to ask you another question though about the house you\n\nmentioned that you have the house and the house is on the historic ledger from my understanding\n\nit is a landmark in washington d.c is that correct because it is historic in nature\n\ncould you talk about that um and do people so people can learn about this historic house\n\nand you mentioned your brothers still live in the house as yes well house is the house is still there 1204 t street uh some years ago my mother was very\n\ninterested in family and she loved taking pictures so we have a lot of pictures of\n\nold family members but she had given me the name of some of the older family members and\n\ni've always been interested in the history so i started to gather more information about what\n\nwhat went on with kenneth and i actually called the dc historical society to find out what they\n\nhad because as far as i was concerned it was a fantastic story it was wonderful the\n\ncourt case was settled in their favor it was two years before brown and when i called the\n\nhistorical society they sort of gave me what who i don't know anything about louise miller or kenneth\n\nmiller we have no information so one of the things i did was to call and find out how they could be\n\nplaced on the african-american heritage trail and so after some writing and some explaining\n\nsomeone says why that's fantastic and we think that the case does deserve to be recognized\n\nso uh i guess maybe it's been 12 14 years ago that a plaque was placed in front of the house\n\nand this is actually the house that grandma bought and kenneth and justin are still there\n\nwow what a wonderful memory can you talk to us about um as you know the kellogg hotel on\n\nthe gallaudet campus was built there is a plaque that's located there and it stands behind the name\n\nsign of the kellogg conference center how do you feel about the placement of the plaque currently\n\ni was not aware that the plaque was being placed when it was done and i'm so appreciative of the\n\nefforts that went into having it placed because without it i think that this may have just sort of\n\nfloated off into history and not have been recognized so i'm glad it's there i often wondered about the placement of it\n\nand whether it was thought that perhaps if the visitors came through the hotel they would see it but it wasn't visible from the street for the people who were walking through and i have my\n\ncousin has a friend who said she was there and she had no idea that the plaque was there so i think\n\na change and more recognition is probably the time has come but i'm glad that it was there\n\nand for those who work to have it placed i want to tell them how much i appreciate it\n\nthank you so that leads me to my next question\n\nand this question is about the kindle school memorial project that is currently a work in progress how do you feel about this new memorial project and do you\n\nbelieve that it's an opportunity for us to share awareness with people about the memorial school\n\ni think it's an excellent opportunity i have enjoyed working with everyone\n\nwho has put forth such a great effort and to thank all of them to thank you and yvonne um\n\ni think it's a great opportunity for something to be done that allows people to come to grips with\n\nwhat has gone on i know there are a lot of people who say oh it's in the past you should just get\n\nover it but sometimes there are pains and there are experiences that stay with you\n\nand they stay with you forever and even sometimes when you can sort of tuck them away there are\n\ntimes when they come forth and they do bring uh you know you put your head down and you shake\n\nyour head and sometimes the tears will come because you understand what went on and not\n\nonly with my brother with with all of the children who had to be taken away from their homes and sent\n\naway and were not receiving that one-on-one love and support that they needed they had an extra\n\nchallenge to deal with and then the challenge of being alone to me is just unimaginable\n\nwhen i went to kindle when we were walking with dr cordano and we were with kenneth\n\nand he looked at the kindle school and the old building that i had not seen before because it was\n\nin a part of campus that i did not have access to and he said i was sitting on the front\n\nwaiting for my mother to come out because she was in a meeting to find out whether or not they would\n\nallow me to come to the school and it's just that's something that touches you to the point\n\nyou can't get over that and so many children have gone through that and here what he had not\n\nbeen introduced to the information though there's you're different there's something wrong with you\n\nyou can't go to school with other people and he's standing there trying to figure out well why\n\nso i think i think the memorial will give us an opportunity\n\nand i understand the design will allow us to enter it and sort of walk through and come\n\nto grips with what has gone on by the time we get to the end and maybe there's a space there that\n\nwill give us a place where we can think and heal and say the time has come for us to move forward\n\ni agree with you wholeheartedly it's definitely time this memorial project\n\nit really is a way for us to start healing and gallaudet owes that to your family\n\nand i definitely can't wait for it to be built\n\ni'm excited about it i'm looking forward to it and again i want to thank you so much for\n\nsharing your stories and your experiences with us thank you miss carol thank you truly amazing\n\nyou know when you're when we were watching the interviews with the individual family members\n\nand also um the live interviews with carol miller that you just did it was so very powerful\n\ncarolyn so i'm wondering if you could perhaps share with us uh some of your experiences what\n\nwas it like for you uh to conduct those interviews with the miller family members\n\nsure liz i i would be happy to share indescribable awesome i kept sort of pinching myself and saying\n\nis this really happening am i really interviewing the miller family during the time it was even happening it was like a dream come true for me absolutely surreal and\n\ndefinitely a historic moment in our time and i am so happy that gallaudet is supporting this effort\n\nand on that particular day november 19 2020 we were welcomed we welcomed the miller family to\n\nthe gallaudet campus we put out the red carpet and we served this family to the best of our ability\n\nso it was quite a formal event we had a car formal car service uh bring them to the campus\n\nwe also provided breakfast and lunch for them on that day\n\nand we just wanted to make them feel at home as we conducted the interviews and did the filming\n\nand it was just an amazing experience i remember walking over to the hotel and\n\ntaking a picture of each family member standing next to the memorial plaque that now stands\n\nand as i think back to that the one word that comes to mind is\n\nawesome i mean i was so pleased and we enjoyed watching the filming we enjoyed interviewing\n\nthem and learning much more about the family and this is history that needs to be documented\n\nindeed it does can you tell us um what you want us to be aware of\n\nas one of the four themes um which we know we're now currently focused on awareness\n\ntell us a little bit more what should we be aware of sure when we think about awareness\n\nwe need to think about the fact that the miller family had this experience\n\nand part of the kindle division memorial is divided into four phases awareness is the first\n\nof those phases freedom remembrance and healing are the rest of those\n\nand we'll be advertising those later on but we're beginning this webinar by focusing on awareness\n\nand basically we want people to know about the lawsuit we want them to know about what happened\n\nduring this period in history and the fact that you can't erase this history we know when we\n\nthink about you know general american history you know we learn specific things in school\n\nwe learn you know things about black history maybe general things but we don't learn about black deaf\n\nhistory that's what's missing and we really need those stories of the black deaf history to be told\n\nthat black deaf experience such as what happened with the miller family and this lawsuit is important and it's important that many people know about this\n\nthis was a landmark lawsuit that happened before the brown versus the board of education\n\nlawsuit and it's something that needs to be shared with the world it's that critically important i agree with you that awareness is the first phase of this process\n\nand it will also give black deaf people an opportunity to share their narratives definitely\n\nyou know we may find that many of their stories are painful because of the history that's there\n\nthroughout the years and so we have to think how those stories or narratives have been neglected\n\nthey have been buried in history and it is past time to create a space where we can increase\n\nour awareness of their narratives we need to get those narratives out to the wider public\n\ni completely agree with you carolyn go ahead and yes i just would like to mention\n\nas miss carol explained when she was talking about the plaque on the back of the name for the kellogg\n\ncenter many people overlook it they don't see it at all it's easy to miss and that's not acceptable\n\nit's not right we have to do better we have to memorialize the history we have to show\n\nthat we value our history it needs to become more visible i concur now my next question for you is\n\nwhat is so unique about this event can you talk to us a little bit about\n\nblack owned businesses that you actually use for your event when you hosted the millers on campus\n\nyes what was unique about the event\n\nwell when we got together with the miller family um that in itself was a unique experience being with the family uh as\n\ni mentioned we served both breakfast and lunch that day awesome and it was catered by a black\n\ndeaf chef even better it was amazingly delicious i can't even explain it to you and we were so proud\n\nto have a black deaf chef there to prepare the food for us to prepare this meal his name is jamar\n\nhiggins and i just have to brag a little bit on him we also had a black deaf photographer who was\n\npresent billy butler he was a photographer um so we could see things from his point of view he's\n\nobviously skilled with capturing the emotion of the subjects it's just an amazing amazing day\n\nso hopefully in the future we will have more black deaf owned businesses uh involved in\n\nterms of the communication and marketing in connection with that project so looking forward\n\nto it this is all so amazing i hope that we continue to use our black owned businesses\n\nfor future projects oh most definitely for the second third and fourth phase of this project\n\nmost definitely we will anything else you'd like to share with us about the november 19th event\n\ni think what i would like to share\n\nis some of the\n\npoints in time during that video for example when we were talking with kenneth\n\nand kenneth talked about the kindle building he talked about walking on campus and as we walked on campus i could see kenneth looking\n\nat the kindle building and i could see he was going back into his memory bank just by his look\n\nand at that moment i just took the deepest breath it was like i wanted to freeze that moment in time\n\ncan you imagine being a seven-year-old boy and told no you can't come to the school so that\n\nmoment when he glanced at the building is just stuck in my memory it was a heart rendering moment\n\nand then we had president bobby cordano with us and he looked at her\n\nand he said i remember and he began to explain his heartache and she apologized\n\nto him for the pain that he'd experienced for what his family went through for the injustice\n\nuh for that entire experience and to be there at that moment for me i i will remember that\n\nforever it's etched into my memory forever so this family is so gracious in helping us heal it\n\nwas a healing moment for them it was a healing moment for us so it really went full circle\n\nand we owe them this we owe them this time to heal so i was absolutely floored by those moments how\n\nremarkable and what a powerful moment i'm so pleased that the family had an opportunity to\n\ngather and to get to this place of healing through this process it's very significant thank you\n\ncarolyn for sharing this very powerful experience that you had in working with the family i now will\n\nturn it back over to yvonne black yvonne will now explain some of the history and the work\n\nthat has gone into the kindle school division ii memorial yvonne is our project lead and has\n\nbeen doing a tremendous job investing her time to make sure that this project succeeds yvonne\n\ngreetings everyone all the people who are able to make themselves available to watch\n\ntoday especially our younger people over at kindle and to everyone else at schools for the deaf across the country who are our future\n\nfirst and foremost i wanted to make sure that we show you the november 19th family\n\nphotos from when the family arrived i know that you're all eager to see them so take a moment\n\nthe deaf photographer billy butler was able to take some of these photographs it's actually\n\nnot this uh not what's being shown right now but what took place on november 19th with the family\n\nno shara it it was a time with the family that's what we're looking to display here\n\nso we're trying to find the november 19th photographs when the miller family arrived on campus\n\nokay it should show after this\n\nwe noticed that there was an annex building and that was to be replaced with the conference center\n\nthe annex building was not impressive by any means\n\nthe other side of gallaudet campus had you know appropriate standard buildings you would expect\n\nto see in an educational community but the nx at that time was not up to that quality\n\nat the time when they were preparing to demolish the building there were people who started to talk about it\n\nand there were members of the gallaudet community that were shocked to find out that that building had actually been built to instruct black death students during segregation\n\nthat's something that was constantly swept under the rug and not talked about\n\nexcellent so in the photographs we were able to see\n\ndifferent members of the family i wanted to take a moment to explain the work that we've been doing up to this point as well as the status and where we currently are\n\nnearly three years ago president bobby cordano attended the\n\nnational black deaf advocates conference and that took place in baltimore\n\nat that point it was the black deaf archives that caught our interest and in doing so the\n\nquestion was asked what's going on with the plaque that's been there for such a long time on campus\n\nbut the noise for that plaque to be changed actually started before then\n\nit was the black lives matter movement that had six students which risa shaw was a professor for\n\nwho started complaining and really making noise about the plaque\n\nand it was important to make sure that the history behind that area was more widely known\n\nso the mass design group called for different community stakeholders to share their voice and\n\ninput on the kendall memorial there was input from the black deaf community the gallaudet community\n\nwe were able to get a pulse on what the community felt was significant in this area and being the memorial and that eventually led to having a stakeholder group\n\nand the stakeholder group worked very diligently and you can actually see what the memorial site looks like right outside of the conference center\n\nit looks like a very barren area almost like a cow path\n\nwhat we want to do is to really beautify that area and show the symbolism that it has\n\nso you'll see different photographs that have been taken of stakeholders and these are the people\n\nwho have been doing this work all along to honor the miller family now this group of stakeholders\n\nexists but that's not all in fact all of you as members of the community are also our stakeholders\n\nyou have a voice and now i'll allow carolyn to well i'll allow carolyn afterwards to\n\nshare more about that but the point is that it doesn't need to be limited to feedback from\n\ngallaudet it could be young people it could be members of the black community brown community\n\nwe want everyone to have a part in this process it's truly my pleasure to see this project grow\n\nand to become such a primary and most important project\n\nwe really want to capture the essence and there's things that need to be acknowledged\n\nthank you for your patience as we share bits and pieces of information thank you to university communications the admissions office for releasing me to do this work\n\nthank you to the executive directors who have provided their support and to everyone on campus who invested even those of you who are watching right now\n\nyou are a part of this legacy and you helped it become what it is i certainly\n\ndon't want to overlook the donors who have given significant contributions\n\nfrom various sources in order to make the memorial what it is that we know now\n\ni would like to thank all of you in advance for your future donations and contributions that may begin today and going forward would like to share a little bit of information\n\nwe will have a community engagement process that involves three different sessions\n\nwe want to make sure that you're able to attend carolyn and liz will be able to share some of the details that come along with\n\nthe naming process we want to be sure that your your voice and your input is considered\n\nlastly we'd like to share some exciting news the project manager the person who is responsible\n\nto manage the entire project and see it to its success as far as the kendall memorial project\n\nwe've already have a position that we've advertised so please take a look at the information in the chat we've shared a link where you can apply today\n\nif you are interested you can certainly explore more and if you know someone else who might be\n\ninterested feel free to share thank you and again especially to the miller family to liz\n\nmiller for fighting the good fight and for all of you for believing in

undergraduate admissions office and the development office the final picture that you see bottom right hand corner\n\nafrican-american gentleman in glasses is mr gerald miller who you have already met via his interview\n\nat this time we want to review with you our process for renaming the miller memorial\n\nthis is actually a new the new memorial it's very exciting it's an opportunity for us to actually recognize the black deaf experience\n\nwe have actually gotten feedback from the black deaf community and various\n\nstakeholders that the kindle school division ii memorial that name itself is inappropriate\n\nthe name kendall actually comes from amos kendall who was an individual who gave us\n\nthe land for gallaudet university to build the school and the university of course amos kendall\n\nwas a white slave owner\n\nthe division ii school was also a school that was named following the conventions of segregation\n\nand so with that understanding we want to make sure that black deaf people\n\nare recognized for their tireless efforts in fighting for integration and equality we need to\n\ncelebrate the black deaf experience and the current name fails to do that so we the members\n\nof the steering committee have decided to invite our stakeholders that i just mentioned to you all\n\nand the black deaf community to come together so that we can jointly identify potential names\n\nfor the new memorial\n\nthis memorial is for the black deaf community\n\nand we have to begin with the name of the memorial we want to be sensitive we want to have shared leadership and shared acceptance\n\nbecause this is going to be a very unique marker for our community given that we will\n\nconvene the stakeholders the black deaf community and the steering committee to work\n\ntogether to come up with a list of potential names we will then hand over the slate of names to the\n\nboard of trustees for their review and approval we will then take that slate of names and allow\n\nthe public to help us finalize the name that will be chosen in order to rename the current memorial\n\ncarolyn what do you think of this process\n\ni think it's uh wonderful for us to involve all pieces of the community so that everyone has a sense of ownership\n\nthe stakeholder group is diverse and i think it's about time that we have these people together\n\nbecause as was explained we still have pain points as we look back on our various memories that\n\nand things that have occurred in time so we don't want to continue to look back in a negative way\n\nand to have negative memories of the past in terms of kindle and slavery and him being a slave owner\n\nwith this kindle division to school being a segregated school and those negative memories we decided would be better to come up with a different name we want to involve the community\n\nin that effort and decide what is going to be the most appropriate name the name that really fits historically with what has happened so i'm definitely excited and looking forward to\n\nhaving the community involved in that process so that we can feel that it's a part of our history\n\nabsolutely i am very much looking forward to the naming process that we will\n\nbegin upon thank you so much carolyn for sharing your thoughts at this time would you like to introduce the two students who have been involved in this project\n\nyes yes would be my pleasure i would like to introduce the two students who took a course with\n\nme this past fall semester at gallaudet university i teach a course called the dynamics of oppression\n\nand i have a group of students who are involved in that class i'm going to call summer seeger\n\nand natalie marcelo and these two students will share the work that\n\nthey did the research they did for the class hi natalie\n\nhow are you two doing doing good good well thank you so much for agreeing to be a part of the kindle school memorial project webinar\n\nand i would like for the two of you to perhaps share your team research and to explain what\n\nthe topics were the topics that you chose in brief please and uh doesn't matter to me who goes first\n\nsure hi my name is natalie marcello and my partner wendy and i um\n\nresearched the mother of kenneth miller louise miller as well as other parents who filed the lawsuit for deaf children's rights to get education at kindle school\n\nwhile we were doing our research for a paper we learned so much about the miller family\n\nand we learned about the lawsuit and all that was going on during the civil rights era\n\nkindle school was once integrated\n\nbut it was definitely a challenge\n\nand miss miller wanted to send her child to kindle school but she was denied access because\n\nhe was a black student so he started going to the pennsylvania school for the deaf and then later on\n\ni went to the maryland school for the deaf because it was closer nearby but there were\n\nparents like miss miller who got together and filed a complaint with the dc board of education\n\nand they won that lawsuit and so that started was a a point in history that we can't deny it\n\nallowed them access to kindle school however it was a school that was segregated at that time\n\nso during the time of segregation there were students who came there to and it was built near the old gym building on campus but it was very small brick building\n\nwith not enough space for all of the desk in fact all the materials that they had were old\n\nand about a year later they did some upgrades on the building\n\nand that building was dimash for the construction of the kellogg hotel\n\nso it wasn't until 1954 with the brown versus board of education when that lawsuit was won\n\nthat integration of schools became a reality so their persistence in continuing to work\n\non this effort and to continue to focus on the provision of education for black deaf children\n\nwas so important it was a moment in history for black deaf students and a moment of civil rights\n\nimportance in the history of black deaf people so as we focus on black deaf children and the parents\n\nwho were involved in that situation they were the ones who empowered the deaf community so we\n\nwant to recognize the hard work of the parents as well as that of the miller family so that was the\n\ninformation that i chose to focus on in terms of black deaf history i know that we need to make a record of all of it you know whether we're talking about events that happen on campus or off campus\n\nit's an important part of black deaf history and their legacy will continue through this project\n\nthank you so much natalie\n\nnow uh summer the floor is yours hello everyone i'm summer and my research project um there were\n\nanother group of students for dr mccaskill's class and we focused our research project on\n\nthe miller memorial we particularly made our focus the other 23 students that attended the school\n\nthose students also need to be memorialized because their experience is so very important\n\nto capture as well we want to make sure that that experience doesn't disappear and it's\n\njust important to recognize every individual's contribution and to celebrate those contributions\n\nthrough this project we were curious to know about their lives what happened to them so that we can\n\nactually benefit future generations of the deaf community i hope that those stories will inspire\n\ngreater change and so in researching their experiences we were curious about\n\ntheir experiences even from 1905 all the way up till 1952 so we wanted to learn more about why did\n\nt"
