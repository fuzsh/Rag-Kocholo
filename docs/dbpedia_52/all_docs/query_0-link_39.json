        "text": "Foundation Requirements\n\nHCD-1020\n\nWriting and Thinking NYC\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis New York City-themed course helps students become critical and independent writers. To help establish a solid foundation in writing, the course introduces different types of writing using persuasive rhetoric in three writing genres—narration, description, and cause and effect. Course readings are drawn from a variety of New York-based texts, including historical documents, short stories, drama, poetry and essays, which will be used as discussion and writing prompts. By the end of the course, students will have an enhanced understanding of writing as a means to think and better communicate their ideas.\n\nHCD-1025\n\nWriting and Literature\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course emphasizes reading, critical thinking and essay writing. Students will build on their skills acquired in HCD-1020, Writing and Thinking NYC, in order to work on more complex essays. Students will learn how to research, use proper citations, and continue to work on their grammar and essay development. Readings are drawn from a selection of literary works, including drama, poetry and the narrative, as well as the critical essay.\n\nGeneral Course Listing\n\nHistory\n\nHHD-2001\n\nHistory of Ancient Civilizations\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nIn Egypt and Mesopotamia people built big and thought big. Between 3,500 to 500 BCE, they created technology that allowed them to live in cities. They invented writing and began to record their own story. They built the pyramids and charted the motion of the stars. Their “firsts” include the work of the world’s first-known author and the first medical description of cancer. They wrote about gods and heroes that walked among them, powerful queen-mothers and women who were kings; they also wrote the books that are the scriptures of some major world religions. This course will focus on the seminal urban cultures of Mesopotamia and Africa: Sumer, Egypt and Nubia, Akkad, Assyria, Hatti, Israel, Phoenicia, Crete and Mycenae, and Persia. Contacts with other cultures of Afro-Eurasia will be considered. Literary texts include Gilgamesh, Sinuhe and the hymns of Enheduanna.\n\nHHD-2011\n\nMedieval and Renaissance History\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nPeople who lived during the thousand years between the end of the Roman Empire in the West and the discovery of the “New World” did not, of course, describe themselves as “medieval.” They thought they lived in “modern times.” This course will look at a selection of topics that were once “current events,” such as the last Romans, Anglo-Saxon England, monasticism, the Vikings, the Crusades, Arabic learning, the Eastern Roman Empire, the Black Death, the university, the communes, chivalry and war. We will also look into popular culture phenomena such as the work of J.R.R. Tolkien and George R.R. Martin and political medievalism. Throughout the course, emphasis will be on the work and words of medieval people (primary sources). Texts include Barbara Rosenwein’s A Short History of the Middle Ages, 5th ed. and Reading the Middle Ages, 3rd ed.\n\nHHD-2013\n\nHistory of Witchcraft\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nWitches—the epitome of “deviant” women, have long haunted our historical memory. This course investigates the gendered history of witchcraft in Europe and the Americas and the origins of Western witch folklore, from riding brooms to black cats. The course also explores how the intersection of law, religion, medicine and magic influenced and fueled these beliefs, and examines the impact of European colonialism and Christian imperialism on them across the colonial and postcolonial world. Students will also work extensively with primary sources, along with modern depictions of premodern witches, to compare and contrast historical fiction and reality.\n\nHHD-2016\n\nGender Rebels and Gendered Power in Premodern History\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThe course explores the history of premodern gender on a global scale through case studies of notable (or notorious) women and nonbinary individuals who exemplified or defied gendered expectations of their culture and era. By showcasing these influential individuals who operated both within and outside gendered social constructs and constraints, we will examine the relationship between gender, identity and authority across the premodern world. Students will gain a richer understanding of premodern gender and sexuality and the lives of women and nonbinary people of the past, as well as how premodern beliefs surrounding gender and sexuality were not as static (nor as rigid) as modern “traditional” gender roles would suggest.\n\nHHD-2022\n\nJustice, Crime and Punishment in the West, from the Middle Ages to the Present\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nHow a society defines crime and punishes offenders reveals much about its values and power structures. This course will explore the changing landscape of crime and punishment in the West, beginning with the judicial ordeal of the early Middle Ages and concluding with a survey of current trends and controversies. Topics covered will include the medieval Inquisition, the great witch hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries, the symbolic and pragmatic dimensions of public executions, gender-based crimes and punishments, and the prison movement of the late 18th and 19th centuries. In the process we’ll chart the shifting relationships among social ideals and fears, state power and the rights of the individual.\n\nHHD-2111\n\nWorld History: Classical to Renaissance\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nA whirlwind tour of the first 5,000 years of human history, this course will begin with the origins of humanity two million years ago, stopping for a closer look at key periods in the cultures of Afro-Eurasia, and continuing on until rejoining with the cultures of the Western Hemisphere at the end of the 15th century CE. We will focus on those events and people that were influential in shaping the identity of their cultures of origin and the global culture of humanity.\n\nHHD-2112\n\nWorld History: Renaissance to the 21st Century One semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course will survey major landmarks in world history from the 15th century to the present. It will focus on significant political, economic, social and cultural developments from a global perspective. Topics will include: the Renaissance and the scientific revolution; the rise of Russia in Eastern Europe and Asia; modern revolutions in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas; global significance of the world wars; legacy of 19th-century thought for the present; unification of Europe and the prospects for peace.\n\nHHD-2144\n\nRevolutions: From America 1776 to The Arab Spring 2011\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nWhat makes revolutions happen? Why do they fail or succeed? This course will examine the revolutions in modern history, beginning with the American, French and Haitian revolutions of the 18th century. We will then jump ahead to cover the Russian Revolution of 1917, Cuban Revolution of 1956-59 and Iranian Revolution of 1978-79, among others, concluding with recent movements including The Arab Spring.\n\nHHD-2913\n\nPolitical Ideologies: From Liberalism and Conservatism to the Alt-Right\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nFrom the first shots of the French Revolution, political ideologies have been driving modern human history; warring ideas sometimes turning into actual bloody wars. This course will begin with the 18th century liberal revolt (with the American and French revolutions) and continue to the present day, covering all the major political philosophies. Conservatism, from Edmund Burke to Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump; liberalism from John Locke to John Stuart Mill to Barack Obama; Socialism from Karl Marx to Mikhail Bakunin to Bernie Sanders; fascism from Joseph Arthur de Gobineau to Adolf Hitler to Marine Le Pen; radical Islamism from Sayyid Qutb to Osama bin Laden; and modern identity politics, including bell hooks (feminism), John Corvino (LGBTQ rights) and Cornel West (race). The course will also cover today’s movements, including the alt-right and antifa. Students will be assigned close readings of original sources by philosophers, politicians and activists. Lively debate will be encouraged.\n\nHHD-3011\n\nHistory of Ideas: The 20th Century I\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course will focus on the social, political and economic background of the 20th century. We will examine Victorianism, imperialism, World War I, the Russian Revolution and other developments, through the 1920s. The ideas of Marx, Lenin, Freud, Darwin, and others will be covered in historical context.\n\nHHD-3012\n\nHistory of Ideas: The 20th Century II\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course is a continuation of HHD-3011, History of Ideas: The 20th Century I. Topics include: the Depression, New Deal, World War II, the Cold War, the turbulent 1960s, the civil rights movement, Vietnam, Watergate, Irangate, the third world. The ideas of Hitler; Mao; Martin Luther King, Jr.; and the issues behind McCarthyism, totalitarianism, socialism, capitalism and communism will be discussed.\n\nHHD-3017\n\nThe Enlightenment: Its Impact and Its Fate\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThe Enlightenment inspired many ideas, like political equality, anti-authoritarianism, modern science, criticism of religion, and more. Enlightenment thinkers achieved this primarily by emphasizing the power of human reason. So profound was this development that many fundamental ideals and institutions of the modern world still base themselves upon Enlightenment principles. Several strands of modern thought and belief, however, have come to challenge many Enlightenment values, including the worth of reason in human affairs. This course will trace the trajectory of Enlightenment thought, first, by considering its key ideas and achievements, and then by examining the ways in which these contributions have been questioned (and occasionally rejected) in the modern day. Topics covered will be wide-ranging, from religion, to politics, aesthetics, philosophy, and science. Our goal is to understand the continuing role of the Enlightenment achievement in the modern world and the more recent ideas that seek to scale it back. Readings will include key contemporary sources as well as recent historical studies.\n\nHHD-3022\n\nTurning Points in History: From the French Revolution to the Present\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course will focus on some of the pivotal events—from the Enlightenment to the space race and beyond—that have shaped the modern world. The historical contributions of such thinkers as Locke, Voltaire, Darwin, Nietzsche, Einstein and Ellis will be examined.\n\nHHD-3186\n\nGlobal Crisis and Conflict from 1500 to the Present\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nIn the last 500 years, encounters between different cultures have taken place over the globe through trade, exploration, conquest, forced migrations and movements of people in search of food, water and shelter as well as religious, economic or political freedom. This course explores these encounters and their consequences with a focus on the resultant crisis and conflict that have shaped the changing landscape of geopolitics, social structures and social theories. We will also look at how the various interactions created perspectives about groups of newly encountered individuals, defining them as “the other.” By examining the underlying reasoning and motives, and the ensuing reaction brought about by direct contacts, we may better understand one another in an ever more interconnected world.\n\nHHD-3226\n\nScience and History: Ideas and Controversies\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nScience as we know it today is relatively new to human society. Still, it has brought profound changes that affect our lives, beliefs and identities. This course will survey the main ideas in the emergence of modern science, as well as the cultural contexts and conflicts involved in its development. We will take a broad overview, from the late Middle Ages to the modern day, with a focus on key developments such as the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, Industrial Revolution and the remarkable discoveries of the 20th century. We will also cover key controversies to get a fuller knowledge of the cultural context of science in different time periods. These controversies include Galileo’s trial, the challenge of mechanical theories to religious authority, the emergence of Darwin’s Theory of Evolution and its relation to current controversies about science teaching in schools and, lastly, issues related to science in modern concerns such as biomedical and military research. Readings will include key contemporary sources as well as recent historical studies.\n\nHHD-3328\n\nThe World Since 1945\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThe conflicts, crises and trends that have built our modern world will be examined in this course. We will cover the Cold War, nuclear proliferation, the Korean and Vietnam wars, decolonization, the European Union, the creation of Israel and the Israeli-Arab wars, the break-up of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and current conflicts from 9/11 and Afghanistan to North Korea to ISIS and the Syrian Civil War.\n\nHHD-3331\n\nWorld War II\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThe social, political and military roots of the Second World War will be addressed in this course. We will then trace their development throughout the war, with a focus on American involvement. Finally, we will look at the aftermath and consequences brought about by the hostilities. Through writings and films, we will read and screen firsthand accounts of those who experienced the war.\n\nHHD-3334\n\nPostcolonial Africa\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nAfrica is said to be the cradle of human civilization. Today, it is a continent of reemerging independent nations with a complex history and a changing pattern of indigenous ways of life. This course will explore the culture and history of the African continent from the 1870s to the present, focusing on East, West and Southern Africa. Readings will include works of both European and African writers and activists. Selected videos will be screened.\n\nHHD-3367\n\nU.S. History of Slavery and Resistance\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nA historical overview of major themes from Columbus and the Colonial era to the Civil War will be provided in this course. Topics such as slavery, the emergence of a labor movement, women’s role in society, westward expansion vs. indigenous resistance, urbanization vs. utopian reform movements and the development of what it meant to be “American” will be explored. Readings will include such works as “Complaint of an Indentured Servant”; petitions to the Massachusetts legislature; Tecumseh on American Indians and land; Orestes Brownson, “The Laboring Classes”; Judith Sargent Murray, “On the Equality of the Sexes”; Elizabeth Cady Stanton, “Declaration of Sentiments”; Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass. While the main focus of this course will be on slavery and resistance of the colonial era and the United States, making links to the present and other experiences will be discussed.\n\nHHD-3368\n\nU.S. History of Civil Rights and Activism\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nAmerican history since 1865 will be examined in this course. Such topics as reconstruction, the rise of labor unions, industrialization, political parties, civil rights, the peace movement and the emergence of identity politics will be discussed. Readings include works by Chief Joseph; Eugene V. Debs; Margaret Sanger; Marcus Garvey; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; Allen Ginsberg and César Chavez.\n\nHHD-3369\n\nHistory of Human Rights\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThe evolution in the history of rights from 1789 to today will be examined in this course. Economic justice, racial equality, gender inclusion, environmental protection, privacy, immigration and reproductive rights will be among the issues addressed. We will explore the history of human rights activism from the Nuremberg trials to the formation of truth and reconciliation commissions and human rights grassroots organizations today. Through historical documents and documentary projects by contemporary journalists, visual artists and filmmakers, we will consider the intellectual and historical trajectory of human rights politics in different geographies. Works by and on Hannah Arendt, Martin Luther King Jr., Rigoberta Menchú, Nelson Mandela, Alfredo Jaar, Patricio Guzmán, Ernesto Sábato, Desmond Tutu, Edward Snowden, Julian Assange, Vandana Shiva and Joshua Oppenheimer will be included.\n\nHHD-3371\n\n21st-Century Social Movements\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nAnother world is possible—but how do we get from here to there? This course is designed for students who wish to be more engaged with active social movements confronting the realities of the climate crisis, racial justice, a failing economy and our militarized world. Examples of social movements in the US, India, China, Sierra Leone and the Amazon will be examined, with special emphasis on understanding indigenous movements and perspectives. In the classroom, we will dive into theories of change, strategies of community organizing, truth and reconciliation, and historic movements that helped lead us to the current moment. Students will research and present on a movement of their choice; then, together, we will create a collective final project. Students will also learn from experience (in the fall semester we will engage with the climate movement by participating in Climate Week; in the spring we will help plan a College-wide action for Earth Day). Class discussions play a central role as students expand their political consciousness and ethics, develop confidence in expressing themselves politically and build community with other students who are doing this work.\n\nHHD-3451\n\nCreative and Destructive Personalities in History One semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nIndividuals can make a profound impression on history. Whether they are founding new institutions or destroying civilizations, unique personalities can be seen as a powerful source for changes in society. In this course we will look at a variety of significant people—from Buddha to The Beatles, from Julius Caesar to Genghis Khan, and others—to see how their actions and their legacies influenced the world.\n\nHHD-3515\n\nBefore the Gun\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThe history of ancient and medieval warfare has been the inspiration for popular films, TV series, novels and video games, such as 300, Game of Thrones, The Last Kingdom and Vikings. Focusing on the conduct of war from prehistory until the development of gunpowder artillery in the 14th century, this course will explore how military systems interact with the societies to which they are a part. The experience—the motivations, equipment, place in society—of individual combatants and the justifications for waging war will be scrutinized as will the role of most of the population—youth, women, the unfree—in wars. New research on gender will be analyzed: female lordship in the Middle Ages, the Sacred Band of Thebes and the reality underlying the legend of the Amazons in classical Greece, as well as findings of experimental archaeology. Students will have ample opportunity to evaluate a deep store of written and visual primary sources, and to hone critical thinking skills that may allow comparison with the contemporary war-torn world.\n\nHHD-3567\n\nComic Book Superheroes and American Society\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course will examine the social, political and cultural history of American comic books, beginning with the creation of Superman in 1938 to the present day. Focusing on Marvel and DC comics as well as independent houses such as Dark Horse and Pacific Comics, we will explore the historical forces that shaped and influenced the comic book world, while addressing issues of power, authority and immigration. Topics covered include: the development of the horror genre in the 1950s and the Great Comic-Book Scare during the era of McCarthyism; the Silver Age of comic books and the reality-based superheroes, including the Fantastic Four; the impact of the Cold War on Iron Man and S.H.I.E.L.D.; the 1960s popular culture and the birth of Silver Surfer; and “Stan’s Soapbox” columns on the Civil Rights movement and the Vietnam War. We will conclude with a discussion of the comic books of the last few decades, and how the emergence of new storytellers such as Christopher Priest have brought new perspectives on cultural, racial and gender issues.\n\nHHD-3669\n\nModern Russian History\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nWe must understand Russia to understand ourselves. – Timothy Snyder\n\nDuring the 19th century, Russia was one of the world’s great powers; during the 20th century, it became one of two superpowers in the Cold War; in the 21st, it has made a dramatic return to the world stage after the dissolution of the USSR. The Soviet Union and its successor states forged unique visions of modern culture, art, society, economy and politics that have exerted active influence in every region of the globe. In order to “understand ourselves” we will investigate the history of Soviet and post-Soviet Eurasia from the First World War to the present day. From the innovations of Bolshevik propaganda to the contemporary resistance against suppression of creative freedom, artists have had a prominent role in shaping the course of Russian history, and thus special attention will be paid in this course to visual art, graphic design, filmmaking and literature. Other key topics include the Soviet Empire and nation-building; ideology and dictatorship; global geopolitics; relations with the United States, China, Japan and Europe; and the attempt to build a noncapitalist civilization in a capitalist world.\n\nHHD-3726\n\nGlobal Extremism: Forms and Consequences in Today’s World\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nProviding an introduction to the phenomenon of extremism in a variety of forms, this course will focus on movements that have had a significant impact on human societies since the late-19th century. Examples include: religious groups such as ISIS, the Lord’s Resistance Army in Central Africa, the Dominion Theology movement in the United States; nationalist and race-oriented movements, including the Pan- Slavic nationalism and the Hindutva Movement in South Asia; political movements, such as right-wing authoritarianism and its left-wing anarchist counterparts. Class discussions will consider extremist violence as well as nonviolent extremist ideologies and economic views that have led to wealth inequality, corruption and social tension. As these problems continue to extend worldwide, facilitated by our modern technology and globally interconnected world, this course will also explore how extremist views propagate and find new adherents.\n\nHHD-3788\n\nChina: Past and Present\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nAfter a generation of isolation, the world is now in full communication with the globe’s most populous nation. The course aims to provide a broad background in China’s history and culture. We will examine the impact of Confucianism and Buddhism on China’s political and social development and China’s role in politics, industry and global relations in view of the new, major changes in Chinese communism. The scope ranges from the classic ancient dynasties of Shang, Han, Tang, Sung and Ming to contemporary times. A selection of films will supplement the lectures and study projects.\n\nHHD-3883\n\nFrom Books to Blogs: A Cultural History of Communication\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nOne way to view the history of the world from the Renaissance to the present day is to see it as an ongoing revolution in the production and communication of information. From the invention of movable type in Europe in the 15th century to the still-evolving technology of the Internet, societies around the globe have benefited from the spread of ideas but often at the cost of experiencing the anxiety and pain typically associated with rapid and profound change. This course will explore ways in which communication technologies have shaped and continue to influence global cultures. We will not only examine the ways in which printing and other forms of information exchange changed the preindustrial world, but will also consider the ramifications of more recent communications technologies, such as the burgeoning effects of radio, television, and the internet. Throughout, our concern will be focused on the larger cultural, social, and political consequences of communications technologies from the Renaissance to the present.\n\nHHD-3889\n\nTotalitarianism Past and Present\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThe forms of totalitarianism that have convulsed global history from World War I to the present will be explored in this course. We will study the social, economic and cultural circumstances that led to the creation of totalitarian regimes as well as those forces that continue to sustain them. The origins of the Soviet Union and the fascist regimes of Italy and Germany, and how and to what extent they succeeded, will be examined. We will also consider the responses to totalitarianism that have sought to change such regimes or, at the very least, have allowed individuals to maintain some level of normal material and cultural life within them. Ultimately, we will address totalitarian trends in the modern day, from long- standing regimes like North Korea to the rise of radical right-wing movements elsewhere. Readings will include modern studies on the nature and history of totalitarianism as well as primary sources, such as memoirs.\n\nHHD-3895\n\nLatin American History\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course will introduce students to the major events, topics and protagonists in the history of Latin America from pre-Columbian times to the present. Writings by Columbus, Hernán Cortés, Sor Juana Inés, Simón Bolívar, José Martí, Che Guevara, Fidel Castro, Gloria Anzaldúa and Rigoberta Menchú will be analyzed and discussed through critical lenses. Connections to art and politics will enrich the narrative of Latin American history through a historical analysis of the political dimensions of culture (visual arts, cinema and literature) and ongoing social debates (human rights, immigration policies, drug wars, environmental crises). Issues of colonization, anti-colonialism and neocolonialism will be addressed and paired with current debates on U.S.-Latin American relations.\n\nHHD-4011\n\nEco-History: Oil and Water, the 21st Century in Crisis\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis is, essentially, a course about world resources, specifically water and fossil fuels. More fundamentally, it’s about the clash of capitalism and climate change. Over the course of the semester, students will deepen their understanding of the climate crisis, its geopolitical consequences, the fossil fuel industry and its impacts, the world water shortage, and the politics of water. Students will research global dynamics and ocean problems and share what they discover with classmates. We will examine what it means to take action, inspired by indigenous activists resisting pipelines, and gain a deeper understanding of our own role in both the crisis and its solutions. Our semester will culminate with participation in SVA’s Earth Day activities.\n\nHHD-4041\n\nAmerican Interventions from Vietnam to Iraq\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nAfter World War II, the United States began a policy of engagement and intervention that continues to the present day. As a result, American soldiers have fought and died in controversial wars around the globe. We will examine American military interventions in Vietnam, Bosnia, Somalia and Iraq, as well as American involvement in regime changes in Iran and Chile. How did America become involved in each of these conflicts? Were they morally justifiable or in our national interests? What have been the long-term consequences of this tradition of interventionism?\n\nHHD-4118\n\nWorld Geography\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nGeographers seek answers to four broad questions: Where is it? Why is it there? Why is it important? What global patterns of biology, environment, climate, transportation, affect us? This course will provide basic answers to these questions through an overview of the different features and processes on the Earth. These features and processes are both natural and man-made and both physically and culturally determined. Moreover, the relationship between people and place is central to an understanding of human history, international politics, and economics. It is key to understanding human cultures and land use. This relationship also helps us understand environmental and climatic changes that are global in scale. The goal of this course is to help students develop a critical awareness of the dynamic world in which we live, as well as to understand the spatial relationships between people, places and the environment.\n\nHHD-4119\n\nSea: History and Culture\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThe historical interaction between humanity and the sea from ancient times to the present day will be examined in this course. We will begin by exploring the role the sea has long played in human civilizations as a highway connecting different peoples and cultures around the world, and as a provider of many essential resources sustaining human societies and commerce. We will also trace the development of seagoing technology and how it enabled ideas and practices in religion, language and economics to spread as a result. Topics will include: Ancient and early modern maritime trade routes; the diffusion of religious beliefs such as Islam and Christianity; the evolution of ship technology, navigation techniques and transoceanic communications cables; the links among oceans and climate, pollution and global warming. Readings will draw on accounts of sea voyages by Ibn Battuta, Christopher Columbus, Charles Darwin and Zheng He, among others, as well as modern scholarship concerning the sea.\n\nHHD-4122\n\nHistory of Classical Greece and Rome\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThe legacy of the Greek and Roman civilizations extends into our modern world. In this survey we will examine the rise of the Greek city-states and their political and artistic development, ending with the growth of Hellenistic culture. We will then turn our attention to the growth of Rome, from its mythic roots through the Republican era, the rise of the Caesars and the political, religious and artistic achievements of the empire. The course will conclude with an investigation of the factors that contributed to the eventual decline and fall of the Roman Empire.\n\nHHD-4288\n\nNature and Society: A Global Perspective\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course traces the history of the diverse and evolving relationships between human societies and the natural environment, from the 1500s to the present day. We will explore the various creation mythologies as well as religious, philosophical and scientific ideas that have shaped and expressed the ways in which different cultures—in the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Asia—have defined the meaning of “nature” and the place of humans within or separate from it. Topics examined include conceptions of nature in Judeo- Christian, pagan, Taoist, Buddhist, Hindu and secular belief systems; the impact of the scientific and industrial revolutions; theories and practices of conservation and ecology in the 19th and 20th centuries; and the environmental crisis today.\n\nHHD-4333\n\nAfrican-American History I\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course will trace the histories and experiences of African-Americans in the United States from 1619 to 1865, covering the Colonial period, antebellum period and the Civil War. It will focus on the social, historical and political development of the African-American family and community. Texts will include: Jacqueline Jones, Labors of Love, Labors of Sorrow; John Hope Franklin, From Slavery to Freedom; Joanne Grant, Black Protest.\n\nHHD-4334\n\nAfrican-American History II\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course will begin with an examination of Reconstruction and the backlash against it. We will then explore the lives, philosophical views and major contributions of Booker T. Washington; W.E.B. DuBois; Marcus Garvey; Martin Luther King, Jr.; Malcolm X; Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.; Paul Robeson and Thurgood Marshall. The social and historical ramifications of World War I, World War II, the Depression, the Harlem Renaissance, the NAACP, CORE, SNCC, SCLS and the Black Panther Party will also be considered.\n\nHHD-4348\n\nThe Wealth and Poverty of Nations\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nAlthough world peace and stability in the 21st century will depend heavily on achieving a more equitable distribution of global wealth, the disparity between the world’s rich and poor nations has never been so great, and, in fact, continues to increase even as the need to resolve this inequality grows ever more pressing. How have we arrived at this dilemma? Have first-world nations created their own wealth, or have they stolen it from others? Have some nations always been poor, or have they been impoverished? Do wealth and poverty result from decisions freely made by each nation’s political and business leaders, or are they the result of larger social, economic and cultural dynamics? Is there a way out of the deepening crisis? This course will address these and related questions in light of the historical processes that have led to the development of a world of rich and poor nations. We shall also attempt to evaluate the relative merits of various solutions that have been proposed to resolve this dilemma.\n\nHHD-4397\n\nGenocides\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nFrom the gas chambers of Auschwitz to the villages of Rwanda, the 20th century has been a century of genocides. This course will try to understand how mass extermination can ever be a goal, and why cries of “never again” have failed to stop it from occurring again and again. The course will cover the Nazi destruction of Europe’s Jews in World War II, the Hutu slaughter of the Tutsi in Rwanda, Serbian militias\n\nkilling Muslims in Bosnia, and other examples of ethnic mass murder. We will use first-person accounts of genocide, such as Primo Levi’s Survival in Auschwitz and Philip Gourevitich’s book on Rwanda, We Wish To Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families, as well as secondary sources.\n\nLiterature\n\nHLD-2042\n\n20th-Century Literature and Culture from Victorianism to Modernity\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nIn this course we will examine European and American authors who, influenced by Nietzsche, Marx and Freud, challenged Victorian social taboos of morality and restraint to create new artistic forms— thematically and stylistically. Students will read novels and short works of transgressive sexual desire and hedonism by Andre Gide, Henry Miller and Anaïs Nin, and be introduced to the works of Kafka, Eliot and Angela Carter who departed from structured writing to experiment with fragmented perspective in fantastic, surreal modes. By semester’s end, students should have a firm understanding of the literary, philosophical and intellectual background of the 20th century. Themes and topics presented will focus on Victorian culture, the Freudian tradition, surrealism and gender issues.\n\nHLD-2043\n\n20th-Century Literature and Culture from the Dystopian Novel to the Feminist Revolt and Beyond\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nIn this course we will read great literary classics by authors from England, France, Russia, Canada and America dealing with a similar theme in different genres and styles—namely, the erosion of individual liberty in cultures of repression, prejudice and taboos. Students will encounter this theme of the individual versus the collective in the dystopian novels of the Russian émigré Ayn Rand, in Huxley and in the feminist Canadian writer, Margaret Atwood; in a play of religious fanaticism in 17th-century witch hunts in Salem, and in a scathing indictment of American racism by the existentialist Sartre and the freedom fighter Malcolm X. Students will be introduced to works of the Beat generation’s rejection of America’s complacency, myopia and bigotry on its journey to Eastern mysticism and drugs to expand consciousness.\n\nHLD-2058\n\nFantasy\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nShaped by our desires and fears, fantasy literature offers radical departures from consensus reality into worlds of magic, peril and delight. This course will explore the imagery, characters, themes and narrative structures of several types of fantasy fiction. We will begin by briefly examining parent genres before reading examples of modern fantasy types, including heroic, surrealist, magic realism, science fiction and feminist. In addition to the fiction, we will read some critical theory to help define and locate the subgenres of this large category of fiction.\n\nHLD-2088\n\nAmerican Literature: 19th Century\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course explores the intellectual, cultural and literary roots and directions of American literature, from its Puritan, Gothic and Romantic origins through realist, transcendental and premodern tendencies late in the 19th century. We’ll read selected works by Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, Herman Melville, Frederick Douglass, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Henry James and the utopian feminist Charlotte Perkins Gilman. We’ll investigate questions of style, genre, tradition and critical interpretation in relation to the blooming of American society and culture.\n\nHLD-2089\n\n20th-Century American Literature Now\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course will plot the major movements in modernist literature in the U.S., beginning with the Harlem Renaissance, Imagism and the cultural front of the 1930s and ’40s, to postmodernism and postwar counterculture (including the American Indian Movement, the Beats and Nuyorican poets) to third-wave feminism. This course centers the writing of those who, historically, have been read as representing specific sub-groups of American culture—whereas, now, these writers and their works are appreciated as foundational to a broadly American literary tradition. We’ll read authors such as William Carlos Williams, Lorraine Hansberry, Maxine Hong Kingston and Ralph Ellison, carving out a sense of what America has been, is, and may come to be, from the perspective of its great writers.\n\nHLD-2161\n\nThe Beat Generation\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course will explore the beat counterculture as a post-World War II American phenomenon, a literary correlative to abstract expressionist painting and to bebop music, auguring the “era” of sex, drugs and rock & roll to follow.\n\nHLD-2211\n\nIntroduction to Poetry\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nWhy did William Carlos Williams devote a poem to the plums in the icebox he so sinfully devoured? How did T.S. Eliot present the modern world as “a heap of broken images” in The Waste Land? Was Sylvia Plath’s most famous poem inspired by her horse, Ariel? Full of questions and rarely answers, poetry, which Lawrence Ferlinghetti calls “the anarchy of the senses making sense,” is the art of noticing and slowing down. When a good poem opens its starry petals at the right moment for a reader, it can, as Harold Bloom says, “enlarge a solitary existence,” and offer refuge and resistance. This course will take you on a journey to explore the lives of major poets, and reading—with your eyes and ears—some of the most influential English and American poems, as well as poems in translation. From sonnet to haiku, we will dive into and experiment with various literary traditions and forms, and by building connections between them, we will hear Sappho’s lyre through Adrienne Rich, or Gwendolyn Brooks’s cool kids through Terrance Hayes.\n\nHLD-2223\n\nShort Fiction\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThrough close readings of modern and contemporary short fiction, students will learn how to analyze stories not only for plot and characters, but also for writers’ literary technique, such as narrative style,\n\nchoice of language, imagery and tone. In considering what the story implies or omits as much as what it includes, students will become active and imaginative readers capable of forming their own interpretations. Short fiction gives us an opportunity to read several works by the same author, and thus gain a deeper understanding of the writer’s craft, perspectives and obsessions. The course begins with late-19th and early 20th-century authors, such as Chekhov, James, Woolf and Kafka, followed by contemporary writers, such as Munro, Lahiri and Adichie.\n\nHLD-2268\n\nThe Power and the Pity: Brutal Tales From Latin America\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course will examine works by 20th century artists and storytellers through their reaction to the violence and horrors of Latin America’s brutal dictatorships. Students will explore the earth-body surrealism of the Cuban-American Ana Mendieta and the powerful war photography of Susan Meiselas, and respond through critical writing. We will read the poetry of the Chilean Pablo Neruda and the heartbreaking novel One Day of Life by the Salvadoran Manlio Argueta. Students will create their own poems steeped in rebellion, bandido manifestos, mock-ups of news articles and creative dispatches that mix their own art practice with literary forms. Confronted with the stark injustice of colonization, and by immersing themselves in the blood-storm of revolutionary eras, students will emerge from this course armed with wisdom extracted from the clashing of warring bodies—in jungle terrain and smoking wastelands—and, perhaps, with the confidence necessary to face the machinery of government in their own age.\n\nHLD-2279\n\nDown These Mean Streets: The City in Fiction\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course will introduce you to a host of midnight people who have made the city their stomping grounds, from down-and-out boxers in Stockton, California in Leonard Gardner’s Fat City to low-level gangsters on the streets of Little Italy in Martin Scorsese’s film Mean Streets. You will also encounter writers such as the hardboiled Raymond Chandler, who paints the neon-drenched streets of Los Angeles and Hollywood like no writer before or since in The Big Sleep, and the playwright Stephen Adly Guirgis, who delivers the broken poetry of real New York speech. We will also examine excerpts from the streetwise, autobiographical performances of the Colombian live wire John Leguizamo. This course will open the painted door to the hidden cultural and social life of 20th-century metropolises such as Los Angeles and New York.\n\nHLD-2281\n\nThe Haunted Psyche: Horror Fiction\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nAccording to H. P. Lovecraft, “The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear.” This course dives straight into the shock factory and unveils a multitude of fears that turn spines to jelly. Students will read bone-chilling novels such as The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jaskson and Child of God by Cormac McCarthy, in addition to stories by Edgar Allan Poe, William Faulkner, Flannery O’Connor, Clive Barker and Stephen King. These Grand Guignol masters provide insights into aberrant behavior and sadistic compulsions, and explore the traditional Gothic literary imagination; their writings reflect the societal and cultural anxieties of the time in which they were produced. Students will learn that the most terrifying of creatures do not necessarily flaunt tentacles and bare gleaming fangs—as the philosopher Eric Hoffer wrote: “What monstrosities would walk the streets were some people’s faces as unfinished as their minds.”\n\nHLD-2313\n\nErotic Literature\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course will focus on selections from the great erotic literature from ancient Greece to modern times in a variety of genres, themes and styles. Topics will include social attitudes (traditional and contemporary) toward sexual dynamics, erotica and censorship, with a consideration of what constitutes erotica and what differentiates it from pornography. Readings will include a licentious Greek comedy presented as anti-war protest; bawdy fabliaux from the Middle Ages and salacious sonnets from the 16th century; an irreverent and sacrilegious 18th century anti-Platonic dialogue; a novella depicting Christ’s resurrection into “blood consciousness”; a sexually explicit celebration of love, art and Bohemian life; a collection of short stories solicited as porn for a dollar a page; a love letter, written in novel form, as a challenge to a paramour who claimed women could not write erotica; a version of a classic, romantic fairy tale transmuted into a B&D fantasy set in the Middle Ages. Students will gain an appreciation of the many protean forms of erotica from comedy to agitprop.\n\nHLD-2565\n\nAmerican Theater\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course will introduce students to key playwrights of the American theater from the 1940s to the present. Assigned readings include works by classic playwrights like Arthur Miller, David Mamet, August Wilson and María Irene Fornés, as well as contemporary masters like Branden Jacobs-Jenkins and Jiehae Park. Students will read an average of one play per week and view several films during the semester.\n\nHLD-2677\n\nFiction of the 19th Century: Love of Demophilia to the Psychosexual Anima\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nIn this course we will read literary masterpieces by authors from Germany, France, Russia, Ireland and America. Topics will include fairy tale tropes; the femme fatale; the genre of social reform; tales of sin, redemption, madness and death. We will explore how overcrowding and poverty, a result of urban industrialization, and immigration, produced the novel of social consciousness and love of the common man, exemplified in the works of Oscar Wilde, Tolstoy and Harriet Beecher Stowe. Students will be introduced to the literature of fantasy and the surreal, attesting to the 19th century’s vast panoply of stories filled with psychological insight and timely sociopolitical issues. The correlations between literature and the visual and performing arts—film, ballet, opera—will also be addressed.\n\nHLD-2678\n\nFiction of the 19th Century: From the Reemergence of the Superhero (Heroine) in Myth and Fairy Tale Tropes to the Darwinian Bête Humaine\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nFictional masterpieces by authors from Denmark, England, France and America will be read in this course, highlighting the 19th century’s three great literary movements: Romanticism, realism and naturalism. Students will be introduced to the salient features and motifs of each movement— Romanticism’s love of nature, the supernatural, fantasy, the exotic and heroic (Hans Christian Andersen and Mary Shelley); realism’s minute depiction of contemporary life and examination of sociopolitical issues of gender, race and class prejudice (Flaubert, Melville and H.B. Stowe); naturalism’s focus on sordid passions and moral decay; aspects of contemporary urban industrial life (Zola). We will examine the authors’ lives, and the social and political environment in which the works were written in order to understand and appreciate the beauty and complexity of the writing.\n\nHLD-2922\n\nMedieval Literature\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThe medieval period was a time of extraordinary literary flowering in Europe. Themes like heroism, religion, courtly love and chivalry became popular as the institutions that supported them rose and fell. The result was a literature full of contradictions, at once spiritual and bawdy, romantic and cynical. Readings will be selected from Beowulf and Anglo-Saxon heroic verse, the plays of Hrotsvitha, lyric poems of the troubadours and trobairitz and al-Andalus, The Poetic Edda, the Arthurian cycle, Dante’s Inferno and Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, as well as popular culture such as the fabliaux and “Carmina Burana,” Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, poems of François Villon and Christine de Pizan. Modern medievalist works such as John Gardner’s Grendel, J.R.R. Tolkien’s Hobbit and Hermann Hesse’s Narcissus and Goldmund will be considered.\n\nHLD-2977\n\nShakespeare: Comedies and Histories\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course will provide the student with a selective, chronological overview of Shakespeare, the dramatist. Plays assigned will include a selection of his comedies and histories.\n\nHLD-2978\n\nShakespeare: Tragedies and Romances\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course will provide the student with a selective, chronological overview of Shakespeare, the dramatist. Plays assigned will include the four major tragedies and one of the final romances.\n\nHLD-3033\n\nArt and Revolution I: The Working-Class Hero\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThe multicultural revolution has deepened and broadened our understanding of gender, race, sexual preference and international culture. Unfortunately, we have tended to ignore one crucial factor that cuts across all areas of human experience: socioeconomic class. This course will focus on the art, literature and struggles of working-class people during the past two centuries. Readings will be selected from\n\nfictional works such as Zola’s Germinal, Gorky’s My Childhood, Sillitoe’s The Loneliness of The Long Distance Runner, Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath, Wright’s Black Boy and Tillie Olsen’s Tell Me a Riddle. In conjunction with the readings we will view and discuss the paintings of artists such as Courbet, Millet, Daumier, Kollwitz, the Russian social realists and the American Ashcan School. Selected videos will be screened and discussed.\n\nHLD-3034\n\nArt and Revolution II: The Rebel\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThe landscape of history has periodically been illuminated by apocalyptic struggles to change society, reinvent the world and re-create human nature. In this course we will explore the literature of social revolt and political revolution. Readings will be selected from authors such as Maxim Gorky, André Malraux, Arthur Rimbaud, Marge Piercy, Bertolt Brecht, Albert Camus, Mariano Azuela and Malcolm X. In conjunction with the readings, we will view and discuss selected works of such artists as Diego Rivera, Siquieros, Eisenstein, Orozco and Frida Kahlo. Selected videos will be screened and discussed.\n\nHLD-3051\n\nLiterature of Self-Knowledge\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\n“Who am I, standing in the midst of this thought-traffic?” wondered the Sufi poet Rumi. Achieving self- knowledge is a challenge not only because our perception of self may not always jibe with the tenuous labels that society imposes on us, but also because self-revelation may sometimes be terrifying. This course draws upon fiction, film and art to reflect upon the daunting task of “knowing oneself” with guidance from thinkers like Socrates and Simone de Beauvoir. We will read works by authors such as Clarice Lispector, James Baldwin, Carlos Fuentes and Mahmoud Darwish, who will lead us into the unmapped labyrinths of self by discussing racial-ethnic consciousness, sexual identity, transfiguration and self-accountability. We will also view such films as Moonlight, as well as discuss art, in particular, self- portraits and “selfies.”\n\nHLD-3231\n\nDisability in Literature and Art\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nWith the rise of disability rights and societal inclusion, literature has witnessed a surge in authentic representations of illness narratives and disability experiences. This course delves into literary depictions of illness, disability and the application of disability studies in understanding literature and art. We will explore the following questions: How has contemporary literature influenced our perceptions of health, physicality and mental well-being? How have factors like illness, disability and neurodiversity molded literature? How can we discuss disabilities and illness? Participants will engage with a curated selection of both timeless and modern works, including impactful autobiographical pieces by authors who identify as disabled. Using investigative frameworks like disability studies scholar Garland-Thomson's notion of the “stare,” postcolonial theory and intersectionality, we will examine the societal and cultural dynamics that influence interactions between diverse bodies/minds. We will encounter the literary works of Rita Charon, Lucille Clifton, Lucy Grealy, Carson McCullers, Leslie Marmon Silko and Audre Lorde, and consider artists Diane Arbus, Frida Kahlo, Paul Klee, Vincent van Gogh, Rebecca Horn and Yayoi Kusama, among others.\n\nHLD-3239\n\nYou Will Hear Thunder: The Masters of Russian Literature\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nLove-stricken aristocrats waltzing in ballrooms, a civil servant waking up to discover his nose is missing, a deluded man chatting with an apparition of a monk clad in black, the eternity-long day of a prisoner in a Siberian labor camp, the doubts and deliria of a nihilistic murderer. Since the 19th century, Russian writers have produced some of the greatest stories in world literature and have become what Solzhenitsyn called “a second government,” a voice for many lives uprooted by war and crushed by the cudgel of Soviet totalitarianism. This course explores why Russian literature has gained such prestige and how it forged its own tradition by magnifying the most essential aspects of human experience. We will visit Tolstoy’s immortal character Ivan Ilyich on his deathbed, and let Dostoevsky take us to St.\n\nPetersburg, “that most abstract and premeditated city,” to hear the confessions of a self-destructive eccentric in Notes from Underground. Other readings include works by masters such as Gogol, Chekhov, Turgenev, Nabokov, Babel and Akhmatova. We will also discuss key historical events and take a look at modern-day Russia through films such as Leviathan.\n\nHLD-3241\n\nContemporary Afrodiasporic Literature in America\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nA Swahili proverb says, “Tamu ya madafu kunywea dafuni” (“The sweetness of the coconut juice is best when the juice is taken in the nut.”) This course will explore how contemporary African writers in the diaspora have portrayed America in their works and, in the process, created an alternative narrative of Africa for the world. For students, it will be an opportunity to expand their horizon and see America from the perspective of outsiders with different viewpoints. Afro diasporic writers’ distinct reinterpretation of Africa, despite a sense of alienation, provides contexts that make it easy for the uninitiated to absorb their narratives that are neither sanitized nor Westernized. By expanding students’ imaginative space, the course will also draw students into the world of the African writer. In a world that is fast becoming a shifting global village, this course will bring the two worlds closer to what Ben Okri calls “strange corners of what it means to be human.” Topics include discussions on Afropolitans and their contribution to African literature in the diaspora. Readings will include Adichie, Ndibe, Selasi, Wainaina and Okonkwo. We will also view films by Africans in the diaspora to engage in further discussion of the subject.\n\nHLD-3251\n\nAfrican Folktales: Once Upon a Time\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThe richness of African epic folktales, which have remained virtually unexplored in the West, will be introduced in this course. It will expose students to the intricacies of constructing these age-long stories and how the myths and legends in the stories shape the cultures, religions, spiritualities and philosophies of the region. Through books, films, lectures and storytelling, students will take a journey into the jungle of long ago, in the land of giants and cities between heaven and earth, where animal tricksters of Africa speak, ancient plants perform, the cloud in the sky visits the world and mermaids in rivers wrestle with humans. Class discussions will explore stories from several regions of Africa, their universal themes, and their influence on African writings, arts and sensibilities. As part of the course, students will have an opportunity to bring to life these stories through illustrations, short films, cartoons, animations, and other visual representations.\n\nHLD-3258\n\nChinese and Chinese-American Fiction Since 1943\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course will explore the work of Chinese and Chinese-American writers, and writers of the Chinese diaspora in the U.S., from the era of World War II to the present. It will focus on fiction, both novels and short stories, by authors such as Zhang Ailing, Lin Haiyin, Yu Hua, Mo Yan, Amy Tan, Yiyun Li, Ling Ma,\n\nC. Pam Zhang and Charles Yu. Themes discussed include the experience of World War II and postwar China as well as of China’s rapid economic development from the 1970s to the present, the experiences of emigration/immigration and of living abroad, and the development of Chinese-American literature and identity as examples of American literature and identity.\n\nHLD-3341\n\n20th-Century Italian Literature\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThe Italian literary tradition didn’t end abruptly with the Renaissance. Many of the greatest novels of the last century were written by Italian authors, writers who fought for or against Fascism, participated in the desperate struggles between labor and capital, took their stand on the issues of anti-Semitism, racism and sexism. Their names may sound obscure to readers of modern fiction—Berto, Morante, D’Annunzio, Pirandello, Levi, Silone—yet we neglect them to our own detriment—politically, morally and aesthetically. This course will explore their work, together with major films of the Italian neorealist cinema.\n\nHLD-3367\n\nModern Japanese Literature in Translation\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nAn examination of Japanese literature of the modern period that began with the Meiji Restoration in 1868 is the focus of this course. This dramatic time marked the end of the feudal era and Japan’s subsequent transformation into an industrialized nation that could compete with its Western counterparts. Topics will include the profound influence that this transformation has had on Japanese society and its people, the conflicts between traditional Japanese values and Western values, and the changing conceptions of identity and gender relations. We will read works by Sōseki, Tanizaki, Enchi, Abe and Murakami.\n\nHLD-3477\n\nChildren’s Literature for Illustrators\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nStudents will gain an appreciation of the author’s and illustrator’s craft by investigating both classic and contemporary novels written for young people. Students will be introduced to picture books, graphic novels, fables and fairy tales as they discover the connections between pictures and words, as well as surveying issues of gender, race, ideology and politics in children’s literature. Some of the authors we will study include Aesop, E.B. White, Roald Dahl, Brian Selznick, Gene Luen Yang, Margaret Wise Brown, Yangsook Choi and Mo Willems.\n\nHLD-3501\n\nTragedy\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course provides a historical overview of the art form that gives expression to human suffering and despair, beginning with Sophocles, Euripides and Shakespeare, then ending with modern playwrights, such as Ibsen, Chekhov and Beckett. We will consider the enduring power of the tragic form by exploring works that reimagine classical tragedies, such as Caroline Bird’s The Trojan Women and Akira Kurosawa’s film adaptation of Macbeth. Students will become familiar with important works of tragedy, why the genre continues to fascinate both writers and audiences alike, and what it teaches us about the human condition.\n\nHLD-3521\n\nThe Arts and Forms of Comedy\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nIt is well known that dying is easy, but comedy is hard. And nothing can be more difficult than trying to explain what makes us laugh. Still we laugh, and our laughter proves us human. This course traces the history of comedy, starting in Greece with the plays of Aristophanes and concluding with a look at the contemporary scene in film, television and print. Along the way, we will read Plautus, Chaucer, Shaw, Shakespeare, Thurber, Ionesco and Beckett. Screenings will include films by Chaplin, Keaton and Woody Allen. We will read such essays as “The Mythos of Spring: Comedy,” Northrup Frye; “The Comic\n\nRhythm,” Susanne Lange; and “Comedy,” Christopher Fry. We will consider comedic forms such as satire, parody, burlesque, theater of the absurd, romantic comedy, sitcoms and tragicomedy.\n\nHLD-3553\n\nImages of Artists in Literature\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nHow are visual artists and their creative processes depicted in literature? Are these literary representations more romanticized, mythologized and mysterious than realistic and accurate? Has society’s understanding of visual artists and the creative process changed since the 19th century? Visual artists are often misunderstood, misrepresented or championed by society. Reading short stories and novels from the 19th century to the present, students will examine the way the creative process is described and how authors use artists as literary characters. The relationships between the artist and the muse, the artist and audience and the artist in society will also be explored. Works from among the following authors will be considered: Honoré de Balzac, Émile Zola, Edgar Allan Poe, Gertrude Stein, Oscar Wilde, Henry James, Nick Hornby, Mary Gordon and Siri Hustvedt. Readings are supplemented with film screenings and visual art. Contemporary art issues will inform class discussions.\n\nHLD-3566\n\nCivilization and Its Discontents\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course explores the themes of civilization and the discontents of individuals within modern society. It focuses on the particular role that the artist and art plays within this relationship. Theoretical writings, literature, film and art will be examined historically as well as critically and aesthetically. Freud’s Civilization and Its Discontents is the primary textbook for this semester. Among additional theoretical sources are essays by Susan Sontag, Sigmund Freud and Donald Kuspit. Among the literary texts and films are: The Remains of the Day, Ishiguro; The Lover, Duras; Swept Away, Wertmuller; American Beauty, Sam Mendes.\n\nHLD-3951\n\nLiterature and Psychoanalysis\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course will explore how an author’s unconscious memories, wishes, fears and fantasies shape their fictional and philosophical world. Various psychoanalytic approaches will be evaluated and applied to an understanding of the writer and their characters. Readings will be illustrated by clinical case material.\n\nTopics will include: pathological types and defenses, dreams and the unconscious, the history of psychoanalysis, trauma and creativity, and the relationship of the writer/artist to the work. We will read theorists such as Freud, Jung, Alice Miller and Winnicott and writers such as Camus, Dostoevsky, Flaubert, Kafka, Ozick and D.H. Lawrence.\n\nHLD-4022\n\nPoetry and Art\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nSince Baudelaire, innovative poets have often exercised important influence on avant-garde visual artists, primarily through radical innovations of form and content in their poetry, but also as friends and, in some cases, major art critics as well. The course concentrates on the work of Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Mallarmé, Apollinaire and William Carlos Williams. Home assignments include readings to locate the poems against their literary and cultural background. There are also selected readings from the poets’ essays and art criticism. Primary emphasis is on the poetry, and the course also attempts to answer the questions: What accounts for the mutual interplay of influence between poetry and visual art? How does it work?\n\nHLD-4044\n\nSurrealist Literature\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nSurrealism, a 20th-century movement begun by poets, attempted to unite the dream and waking worlds through art. The poets were later joined by visual artists whose works they influenced, both as critics and as friends, and Tristan Tzara, the Dada animateur. André Breton, the “pope” of surrealism, is covered in detail, with close readings of his manifestos, poetry and fiction. We also read such poets as Jean Arp, Paul Eluard, Louis Aragon and Aimé Césaire. Sessions feature surrealist plays and films, and discussions of visual artists associated with the movement. Translations by the instructor are included.\n\nHLD-4122\n\n18th-Century Fiction: The Enlightenment to Romanticism\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\n18th-century Europe embodied the philosophical, historical and literary foundations of Enlightenment thought, setting the stage for modernism. Though characterized by repressive and hierarchical social, political and religious institutions, its literature and visual arts are filled with challenges to accepted norms. Students will learn about Voltaire and Diderot, philosophers whose ideas led to the bloody French Revolution; the Marquis de Sade who wrote the definitive manual of sexual depravity and provocatively espoused absolute freedom from autocratic despotism; Jonathan Swift who satirized religious and governmental exploitation and indifference; and Adelaide Labille-Guiard, a painter who shook up the art academy, first by being admitted to it and then by campaigning to admit other women painters. The century also gave birth to Romanticism and to Johann Goethe who looked to nature and feelings (sensibility) rather than social institutions for inspiration to produce a literature of passion and horror.\n\nThrough these texts, students will gain a deeper understanding of the power of literature and allied arts to present and represent new ideas, putting pressure on society to change.\n\nHLD-4123\n\n18th-Century Fiction: Women and the Supremacy of the Passions\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course will examine the transformative nature of two great literary traditions in 18th-Century Europe—the literature of social reform (culminating in the great revolutionary play by Beaumarchais), and the novel of sensibility. Students will be sensitized to how these genres would dissolve and merge. Many “enlightened” thinkers would turn their attention to the oppression of women in their critique of social institutions. Mary Wollstonecraft, one of the first great feminists, would advocate the parity of education for women in their journey to suffrage. Diderot would point to despotic paternalism as the cause of demonic behavior and insanity in young women forced into convents against their will. Cleland and Laclos (in his great erotic novel) would critique gender inequality using the delicate and sensuous genre of sensibility as would Prevost in an early template for the femme fatale. This course, while referencing the literature of fantasy, will focus on the portrayal of women in a male-dominated society ruled by an ideology of suppression and exploitation. Students, through reading and analyzing great literature, will develop a deeper understanding of how the past’s repressive institutions continue in today’s society.\n\nHLD-4152\n\n20th-Century Irish Literature\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course will explore how, through literature, 20th-century Ireland has dealt with its losses and forged its identity. The course will cover the Irish Literary Renaissance, the founding of the Abbey Theatre, Joyce’s efforts to give Ireland a voice and situate it within the mainstream aesthetic movements of Europe, Yeats’s delving into folklore and spirituality, as well as more recent writers’ explorations into such questions as cultural identity. We will read the work of fiction writers, playwrights, and poets such as: W.\n\nB. Yeats, James Joyce, J. M. Synge, Sean O’Casey, Flann O’Brien, Samuel Beckett, Patrick Kavanagh, Seamus Heaney, Eavan Boland, Mary Lavin and Tom Murphy.\n\nHLD-4193\n\nLiterature of Love\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThe exploration of love relationships and values of various cultures and times is the focus of this course. Beginning with an examination of ancient attitudes toward love in the works of Sappho, Plato, Aristotle and Ovid, we then consider the influence of courtly love and Christianity on attitudes of love in medieval literature. Lastly, we will address more modern conceptions of love in Chekhov, Proust and Woolf.\n\nHLD-4199\n\nAntiheroes and Villains in Literature\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nWhat are villains and why do we love them so much? This course will examine the literary device of “the villain” and the emergence of the antihero in literature. We will read representative texts by such authors as: Sophocles, Shakespeare, Dante, Dostoevsky, Beckett and Hammett.\n\nHLD-4288\n\nPolitics and Literature\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course will explore how great writers have dramatized and/or promoted various political philosophies in their work. We will examine questions such as: What is the best form of government? What are the appropriate means to achieve political ends? What is the relationship between elites and the masses? Readings in the course will include works by: Plato, Machiavelli, Shaw, Brecht, Orwell, Camus and Malraux.\n\nHLD-4293\n\nLiterature and Environmental Justice\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThe ways in which writers and theater makers are cultivating response to climate chaos beyond the spectacle of disaster will be investigated in this course. In particular, we will explore works that re-imagine elements of time, place, wildness, collective action and symbiosis to experiment with forms of narrative that can address the enormity of the ecological crisis and the complicity of modern literature in its unfolding. We will also look at some of the views that underpin systemic exhaustion of the planet: anthropocentrism, extractivism, progress, empire. Readings will include Amitav Ghosh, Anna Tsing, Caryl Churchill, Nnedi Okorafor and Robin Wall Kimmerer. In addition to writing critical analysis of contemporary literature and plays, students will create their own short fiction and climate justice artist statement.\n\nHLD-4306\n\nPoetic Justice: Literature and the (Out)Law\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nWhat is justice? Who deserves to be punished? What laws should govern us? Philosophers and legal scholars have long contemplated these questions, and for some writers and artists they provide urgency to inspiration. In this course we will look at what “justice” might mean and how writers and artists have provoked and created when the gap between law and justice unravels. We’ll look at how writers from Sophocles in “Antigone” to Franz Kafka question what is just when the law isn’t. We’ll look at writers and poets who have found themselves writing from prisons, from Nelson Mandela to members of Pussy Riot, as well as the work of currently incarcerated writers and artists, and those responding to contemporary questions of justice, including Rhodessa Jones, founder of the Medea Project: Theater for Incarcerated Women, and prison abolitionist Mariam Kaba.\n\nHLD-4312\n\nModern Literary Survey: India and Asia\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis world literary survey will focus on the best-known and most influential writers of India and Asia. The enormous changes of the 20th century have produced literatures that uniquely blend traditional cultural forms with new styles and content. Readings will include short stories, novels and essays from such authors as Kobo Abe, Yukio Mishima, Lu Xun, Lao She, Salmon Rushdie, B. Bandopadhyay and V. S. Naipaul.\n\nHLD-4322\n\nThe American Novel Since 1900\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course will concentrate on how the novel chronicled the growth of America from a young isolated country at the beginning of the 20th century to a world leader in literature, art and politics, and how that legacy has affected America’s position in the first part of the 21st century. It will also use the novel to demonstrate how American literature evolved from being produced by a relatively homogenous group of writers to include the increasingly diverse voices of contemporary America. The works included will be drawn from the early and mid-century novelists such as Willa Cather, Edith Wharton, William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway. We will then move forward chronologically and look at the works of such novelists as Toni Morrison, Saul Bellow, Cormac McCarthy, James Baldwin, Philip Roth, Ralph Ellison and Jhumpa Lahiri.\n\nHLD-4331\n\nPortraits of the Self in Early Modern Narrative\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nWhat is the nature of experience? This very basic question is at the heart of how we understand ourselves. Using fiction from the 18th and 19th centuries, this course will explore the history of our concept of experience to think about how we communicate our feelings to others. Close attention will be paid to the ways in which literature imagines the experience of beauty, oppression, commodification and modernization. Authors will include Austen, Defoe, Smollett, Sterne and Cleland.\n\nHLD-4336\n\nPostcolonial Literature: Resistance and Recuperation\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nPostcolonial Literature explores works from a variety of regions around the world, providing a global perspective on the historical development of the postcolonial situation, the anti-colonialist movements that produced it, its many diasporic communities after independence, and its potential relapse into forms of neo-colonialism. The term “postcolonial” generally refers to the political, economic and social interactions between Western powers and the societies they colonized over a period of conquest, occupation, independence and globalization. Texts by such authors as Anita Desai, Amitav Ghosh, Mohsin Hamid, Lu Xun, Su Tong and Bao Ninh will be considered in relation to issues of power, exploitation, resistance and migration.\n\nHLD-4342\n\nThe Myth of Self-Creation in American Literature\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nD.H. Lawrence wrote, “She starts old, old, wrinkled and writhing in an old skin. And there is a gradual sloughing off of the old skin, towards a new youth. It is the myth of America.” The idea that the past could be discarded as an old skin and that we could be better and freer by virtue of being new is a myth that defined America before there was an America. It is an idea that has had tremendous influence on the religious and political history of this country. This myth continues to shape how Americans think about themselves and their relationship to what is still perceived as an older and more corrupt world. In spite of slavery, genocide, global profiteering, two world wars, economic colonialism and other such sins, America still sees itself as a pure and innocent force for good in an evil world. This course will draw on a broad range of authors to show how this myth has adapted itself to different times and social conditions and yet remains recognizable as the same myth. We will focus primarily on short stories and novels, but will also examine some poetry and essays. Readings will include works by such authors as Emerson, Whitman, Twain, Lewis, Fitzgerald, Faulkner, Baldwin, Dreiser, Norris and Hurston. We will also discuss some contemporary manifestations of this myth.\n\nHLD-4352\n\nLands of Memory: Literature Beyond Borders\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nAs a medium of cultural memory, literature has shaped our collective past and human consciousness. Manifested in all genres—from poetry to plays, through short stories and novels—and in all presentations of media, the story of who we are is a composition of real events, dreams, imaginative wanderings and creative ideas that gradually find a place in our collective memory. These memories, when explored through the agency of literature, exist beyond time and beyond geographical borders. We will enter the lands of memories with Jorge Luis Borges in “Funes the Memorious.” In Anthony Doerr’s “Afterworld” we are transported to a future world where a person’s memory can be downloaded and traded on the black market. In Yōko Ogawa’s The Memory Police we witness the erasure of an island culture by a futuristic totalitarian government, and Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go, we travel back in time with a woman who has a limited future. This course explores how remembered worlds can act in concert to form this vast universe we call our human experience.\n\nHLD-4372\n\nAt the Crossroads: Utopia or Dystopia?\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThe term “utopia” is generally associated with Sir Thomas More, whose famous work portrayed an idealized island kingdom representing what a perfect society might look like, although, ironically, utopia stems from the Greek ou topos, which suggests “no place.” The tradition of reaching for exemplary values and the common good continues to be the highest of human aspirations. Unfortunately, the ideal vision of utopia inevitably suggests the harsh contrast of dystopia, a vision of totalitarian repression and severe limitations on the human spirit. Can there be a society of radical reform and dramatic progress? Or will this society, left unexamined and unchecked, become a dangerous and terrifying nightmare future? In this course we will explore these questions with reference to literature and film. Readings may include works such as: The Handmaid’s Tale, Nineteen Eighty-Four, Brave New World, and other speculative fiction.\n\nHLD-4389\n\nStates of Exile\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nIn reading works of fiction and nonfiction, this course will explore how writers have represented states of exile as both cultural and personal phenomena of exclusion, dislocation and repatriation. In examining various stories of exiles, we will discuss ideas about identity, tribal social instincts and the sense of belonging, while addressing questions such as: What does exile mean? Who is an outsider? What is home? Is exile a physical state always based on geography or a psychological one? Texts will include works by Rebecca Solnit, Vladimir Nabokov, Roxane Gay, Lila Azam Zanganeh, Daniel Mendelsohn, Azar Nafisi, Émile Zola, Doris Salcedo, John Berger, Akiko Busch and Georges Didi-Huberman.\n\nHLD-4416\n\nArtificial Minds in Myth, Fantasy and Reality\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nArtificial intelligence has increasingly become an unavoidable part of our daily lives, but what unexpected problems could this technology create? For thousands of years, myths and fantasy literature have anticipated and explored the moral dilemmas of creating artificial minds. From the ancient Greek tales of Pygmalion and Prometheus to Judaic myths of the Golem and Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, this course will examine stories that warn us of the dangers of creating artificial life. We will continue with Karel Čapek’s play R.U.R. (in which the word “robot” was coined to refer to artificial slaves) and science-fiction stories by Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick and William Gibson. The course concludes with considering work by posthuman philosophers like Donna Haraway and her “Cyborg Manifesto,” as well as writings by computer scientists and technologists such as Alan Turing and Jaron Lanier. All of these works will be approached as thought experiments that could provide guidance for navigating the real-world dangers and benefits of artificial intelligence.\n\nPhilosophy and Cultural Studies\n\nHMD-2023\n\nMasterpieces of Western Music: Medieval to Classical\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThrough readings, recordings and films this course will present a survey of Western music masterpieces from the medieval, Renaissance, baroque and classical periods.

We will also look at the music of the indigenous peoples in Latin America as well as the musical traditions of enslaved West Africans, several million who were brought over to the Americas during the colonial era. Various musical forms emanating from this cross-cultural amalgam will be defined and discussed, including the bolero, candomblé, chacarera, danza, bomba, son and many others. Composers and artists whose work will be explored include Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, Santiago de Murcia, Manuel Ponce, Carlos Chávez and Silvestre Revueltas. Songs and music of protest, which arose at various times in Latin American history, during such periods as the Guerra sucia (dirty war) in Argentina (1976-1983) and the years of the Pinochet regime in Chile, will also be explored. Contemporary popular music and forms, such as salsa and bachata, along with the artists who produce and perform them will also be covered.\n\nHMD-2046\n\nRoots and Rhythms: Music in Culture 1920-1964\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course will begin the exploration of the cultural history of popular music in 20th-century America (1920-1964), with particular emphasis on the beginnings of recorded blues and hillbilly music in the 1920s and 1930s, the evolution from rural-based genres to more urban forms such as rhythm and blues and country and Western during the 1940s, the bridging of various styles into the rock ‘n roll revolution of the 1950s, the emergence of record producers, the origins of surf and soul music, and the folk revival of the 1960s. Along the way, we will closely examine the work of such seminal artists as Robert Johnson, Hank Williams, Muddy Waters, Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, Ray Charles, Phil Spector and Brian Wilson.\n\nHMD-2047\n\nBeatles to Beyoncé: Music in Culture 1964 to the Present\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course will continue the exploration of the cultural history of popular music in the 20th century (1964 to the present), with particular emphasis on the British Invasion and the subsequent rise of folk rock, garage and psychedelia during the mid-to-late 1960s; country rock and disco to heavy metal, punk and new wave in the 1970s; MTV and the first video generation of the 1980s; hip hop, grunge and other 1990s alternatives, the return of the teen idol and celebrity-driven pop in the new millennium. Along the way, we will closely examine the work of such seminal artists as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, The Ramones, Prince, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Nirvana, Beyoncé and Taylor Swift.\n\nHMD-2051\n\nSongs of Conscience: Music and Social Change\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThroughout history, music has shown itself to be a powerful force for social and political change. This course will examine the role of music in expressing the hopes, fears, attitudes and dreams of the common man and woman, and of the struggle to help the unempowered and underprivileged of society. Along the way, we will underscore the ongoing connections between protest music of past eras to such recent movements as Occupy Wall Street, Me Too, and Black Lives Matter. We will listen to, read about, and discuss the works of socially and politically committed artists from all walks of music, including folk (Woody Guthrie, Bob Dylan), rock (John Lennon, Bruce Springsteen), soul (Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye), rap (Queen Latifah, Kendrick Lamar), reggae (Bob Marley, Peter Tosh) and country (The Carter Family, Willie Nelson).\n\nHMD-2056\n\nSongs, Screens and Scenes: Coming of Age with Music and Movies\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nIt’s often said that the music we listen to and the films we watch provide the aural and visual timestamps for our lives. Every generation expresses itself in unique ways, with values and tastes shifting to reflect reactions to, and attitudes toward the world it joins. In this course we will explore the impact and influence of various genres of music featured in American and international films from the last six decades, with a sharp focus on recurring themes of rebellion and challenge to authority that shape both the personal and collective identities of young people. We will investigate the role of music in various eras and locales, and students will engage in comparing and contrasting the portrayals of youth from both within and outside their own experiences. Settings and styles will range from South American jazz (Black Orpheus), California acid-rock (Psych-out) and Jamaican reggae (The Harder They Come) of the 1960s and ‘70s to Seattle grunge (Shingles), LA rap (Boyz n the Hood) and Tehran alt-rock (No One Knows About Persian Cats) of the ‘90s and 2000s.\n\nHMD-2063\n\nHistory of Jazz\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course will begin with an examination of the African roots of jazz and early African-American forms such as spirituals, blues and ragtime. We will see the beginnings of jazz as a blending of European and African elements in brass bands at the turn of the 20th century. We will then study subsequent phases of the music as it has evolved over time, including swing, be bop, free jazz and fusion, with close examination of the work of such iconic artists as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Charles Mingus. Along the way, we will view these developments with a cultural perspective to help us understand jazz’s place in American social (as well as global) history. Musical examples will be presented in a way that can be readily understood by anyone.\n\nHMD-2069\n\nThe Magic of Opera\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nCreated more than four centuries ago, opera continues to be truly magical, as it encompasses various forms of art—including acting, set design, costumes and instrumental music—all working in harmony with that ultimate vehicle for transmitting human emotions: the beauty of the singing voice. Through readings, recording, and videos, students will explore a series of key operatic masterpieces, spanning from Monteverdi’s Orfeo (1607) to Adams’s Nixon in China (1987), to examine such subjects as: the birth and history of opera; its various forms and structures; the political, socio-economic, and philosophical background that influenced its creators. This course will serve as an introduction to opera for students with no previous operatic listening experience; those already familiar will gain a deeper appreciation of this unique and exciting art form.\n\nHMD-2073\n\nPopular Music and Technology\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nTechnology’s role in the establishment of the modern music industry is, and continues to be, of immense importance. This course explores the developments in Western popular music concurrent with the advent and advancements in audiovisual technology. We will closely examine how the commodification of music and development of mass media shaped the trajectory of popular music of the past 150 years. There will be an emphasis on material history where we will examine phonographs, wax cylinders, vinyl records, etc., while studying their reception and how they influenced artists, producers and listeners. This course will also consider how the dissemination of popular music at an industrial level both influenced and reflected racial and gendered identities with Western culture.\n\nHMD-2078\n\nThe Music Video\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nAmong the most powerful developments in media history, the music video has revolutionized how we receive and perceive popular music. This course will explore the televisual history of music in the 20th century, beginning with televised music programs in the mid-century and culminating with music in contemporary short-form media such as TikTok. We will consider several questions such as: How did the rise of narrative music videos influence both the reception of music and television programming? To what degree should artists maintain control over the use of their music in third-party programs, advertisements, or campaigns? And, what role does digital media play in constructing global music cultures?\n\nHMD-2084\n\nMusic and Migration\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nMusic has been the vessel of exchange, contention, and collaboration across diasporic groups from Africa, Europe, Latin America, Asia, and the Arab World in the U.S. Focusing on the transnational nature of American popular music, this course explores the relation between music and society, challenging preconceived notions of difference and identity. Students will learn how music has survived, transformed, and hybridized in diverse U.S. ethnic and cultural communities and how they have changed our music.\n\nFinally, we will put into consideration what the connections between music and identity are among the selected diasporic groups.\n\nHMD-2244\n\nArt Theory: From Modernism to Postmodernism\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course is an introduction to the philosophical ideas that have shaped the practice of contemporary art and criticism in the West. We begin with an examination of some historical problems that have arisen in thinking about art. Then we survey the various systems that constitute modernist cultural “theory,” including formalism, phenomenology, Marxism, structuralism, semiotics and psychoanalysis. These modernist theories are compared to poststructuralist and feminist views of art production and reception. The overall objective is to provide the necessary background for understanding and evaluating contemporary theories of art and design. Required texts: Stephen David Ross, ed., Art and Its Significance: An Anthology of Aesthetic Theory; Terry Eagleton, Literary Theory; Harrison and Wood, eds., Art in Theory: 1900-1990.\n\nHMD-2247\n\nMagic, Symbolism, Modernism and Art\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nWhat is a mystic, a magician, a seer, a charlatan, a scientist, an artist? When do poetry, art, emotion and science collide? This course explores the themes of magic and science as they relate to the movements of symbolism and modernism in 19th- and 20th-century literature, philosophy, art and art theory. We will examine Edgar Allan Poe’s definition of the infinite universe, Nikola Tesla’s scientific achievements in electrical discoveries, Harry Houdini’s sleight-of-hand tricks, the films of Georges Méliès and Jean Painleve, and the art of Pablo Picasso. Readings from literature, scientific articles, philosophy and art theory will be complemented with films and demonstrations.\n\nHMD-2267\n\nAfrican Art and Civilization\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThe aims of this course are to study the traditional art of specific ethnic groups and to explore artistic variations from Africa, parts of the Americas, Brazil, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Haiti and the continental United States.

We will also look at African contemporary art, including modern film that contrasts modernity with antiquity.\n\nHMD-2411\n\nThe Female Gaze\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nWe will look at artists whose vision has been clearly shaped by an awareness that what we see is conditioned by who we are, and that our sexuality and personal histories play significant roles in the forming of our artistic statements. We will study artists like Sofonisba Anguissola, Hannah Hoch, Louise Bourgeois, Eva Hesse, Mary Kelly, Adrian Piper, Lorna Simpson, Sophie Calle, Shirin Neshat and Louisa Matthíasdóttir in light of such questions as: How does gender relate to art? How is this relationship\n\nreflected in history? What is the relationship between the rise of the women’s movement and art? What is feminist art? We will also look at the collaborative group known as the Guerrilla Girls. Language, identity and autobiographical impulses are among the topics to be discussed and integrated through readings in Ways of Seeing, John Berger, and Manifesta, Jennifer Baumgardner and Amy Richards. We will also examine the history of the women’s movement and the feminist art movement through selected essays by John Stuart Mill and Harriet Taylor Mill, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Linda Nochlin, Lucy Lippard, Betty Friedan and Michelle Wallace.\n\nHMD-2422\n\nArt and Politics\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nHow do artists respond to the social upheavals of their times? What is the artist’s responsibility to these concerns and what is the responsibility to one’s craft and to the development of a personal statement? In this course we will examine the inspiration and creation of politically focused art and literature and its role in the development of art history. We will examine a wide variety of topics, artworks, literature and videos that address the current issues of sociopolitical concern, such as Diego Rivera and the Mexican muralists, Guernica by Pablo Picasso, Create Dangerously and Caligula by Albert Camus, as well as view the film Pan’s Labyrinth by Guillermo Del Toro.\n\nHMD-2432\n\nPhilosophy, Arts and Revolution\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThe radicalization of philosophy, politics and the arts during the 1960s will be explored in this course. Students will examine the connections between postwar theories of social conflict and the rise of radical movements across the world.

The artistic works of Tropicália, the Neo-Concrete Movement, Cinema Novo, Louise Bourgeois, Agnès Varda, Valie Export and Roberto Burle Marx will serve as aesthetic counterparts to our study of the selected philosophers and the radical movements inspired by their thoughts. Students will consider the relentless power of philosophy, art and militancy as critical antidotes to state repression and police brutality.\n\nHMD-2513\n\nThe Artist as Activist\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThis course combines a historical survey of art and activism movements with studio-based practices that students will actively engage in by creating their own activist work. The historical survey begins in the 19th century with the Suffragettes fighting for the female vote, and ends with the recent Black Lives Matter and MAGA movements. We will examine various arenas in which creatives strive to bring about social change, such as performance art, street art, public art, participatory art, satirical art and propaganda. Significant attention will be paid to understanding the dynamic between the artist, the work, the media and the public’s perception of the work. As noted, students will also create activist work for a “real-life,” nonprofit organization chosen by the instructor. This course aims to give students the knowledge and experience they need to be able to direct their creative practice toward supporting causes of their choosing.\n\nHMD-2639\n\nWorld Religions\n\nOne semester: 3 humanities and sciences credits\n\nThe beginnings of the world’s major religions based on the historical and archaeological record will be the focus of this course. These include Judaism, Christianity, Islam in the Western tradition; Hinduism, Buddhism, Daoism and Confucianism in the Eastern tradition. Other religious traditions may be referenced. R"
