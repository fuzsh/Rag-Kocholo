        "text": "By the 1730s a new generation of French painters had developed a renewed understanding of history painting. This reconceptualization undermined the foundations of Albertian historia and the underpinnings it had for so long provided for the practice and theory of French grand genre. Representing figures defined by dramatic actions and narrative relationships between them was replaced by a mode of presenting figures in quieter states of bodily and psychological introspection. This naturally recalls Michael Fried’s notion of ‘absorption’, used to define a pictorial aesthetic that emerged in the mid-eighteenth century. This essay maps the earlier appearance of such ‘absorptive states’, where the valorization of inner mental activities coincided with a growing singularization of the figures within a composition. This phenomenon, it is argued, was the result of an evolution in the academic practice of life drawing. This led to an even-greater attention to the figuration of the human body in painting as the manifestation of an interior state, becoming the central organizing principle of history painting.\n\nBetween the late 1620s and late 1640s, Jacques Blanchard, Simon Vouet, and Claude Vignon all painted the femme forte, a type of exemplary, heroic womanhood whose popularity was linked to the presence of Marie de Medici and Anne of Austria on the royal stage. This article puts French paintings of femmes fortes (strong women) from the early seventeenth century into conversation with period discourse regarding the reception of paintings and the status of women. Pictorial representation tended to cast the femme forte into contexts that compromised her exemplary status. Nude, on the verge of death by her own hand, the figure of the femme forte invited the very kind of sensual consumption that the femme forte herself attempted to disavow. Yet the ultimate threat posed by the femme forte was that her image might ‘trick’ male viewers into unwise actions.\n\nAlthough a popular success when Jules Bastien-Lepage first showed it at the Paris Salon of 1878, Les Foins (Haymaking) immediately prompted a critical skirmish over the legacy and meaning of realism. At the centre of the debate was the painter’s troubling representation of an immobile, exhausted haymaker, ‘absorbed in some vague thought’, as one critic put it. Underlying the critical division, this essay argues, was the painting’s problematic attempt to make an enduring and temporally-extended picture – a picture consistent with the mid-century realism of Gustave Courbet and Jean-François Millet – out of the historically shifting dynamics of rural wage labour in early Third Republic France. In doing so, Bastien-Lepage brought one line of realist painting to a close and in turn opened a new tradition of artistic naturalism."
