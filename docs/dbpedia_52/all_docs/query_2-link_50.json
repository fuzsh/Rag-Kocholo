        "text": "At the end of the eighteenth century, Germaine de Staël set out to discover the various means through which literature and the society in which it was produced shaped one another. She noted that ‘the progress of literature – that is, the perfection of the art of thinking and of self-expression – is necessary to the establishment and the preservation of liberty’. She furthermore maintained that among all the developments of the human mind, ‘philosophical literature, eloquence and reasoning are the things I consider to be the true guarantors of liberty’.1 The concept of a republic composed of like-minded individuals with similar aesthetic tastes and political aspirations was not at all new in eighteenth-century France, for the term ‘Republic of Letters’ was already in fairly widespread use in the preceding century. However, what was new was the stipulation that universal democracy could be strengthened through the aesthetic use of language to express ideas that gained in nuance and complexity as they were circulated among citizens. Published in 1800, Mme de Staël’s De la littérature considérée dans ses rapports avec les institutions sociales (On Literature Considered in its Relations with Social Institutions) provides a retrospective view of Enlightenment literature, focusing not so much on what it had been but on what roles it played in forming individual and collective identities.\n\nLike a great many of her contemporaries, Mme de Staël held that citizens who were engaged collectively in refining complex, interrelating ideas increased shared knowledge while simultaneously forming a bond of reason and virtue among themselves. She wrote that the study of science was not sufficient to sustain freedom, largely because science contributed less to the study of morals and human passions. If one values only what can be captured in mathematical analysis, she maintained, one risks not only intellectual, but also political confinement, since profound meditation on the exact sciences causes people no longer to be interested in the events of the day. Nothing pleases absolute monarchs more, she wrote, than ‘men so profoundly occupied with the physical laws of the world that they abandon it to anyone intent on taking it over’ (26). Empiricism and scientific progress do not suffice to produce or guarantee freedom; philosophical literature is a necessary condition for the preservation of liberty because, Mme de Staël argues, it relates to both the human and the natural world. Synthetic connections between and among what had previously been considered disparate realms characterized Enlightenment thought, and a great many eighteenth-century literary works blended aesthetic, empirical, social and philosophical approaches to understand how thought and matter can interrelate.\n\nMme de Staël’s characterization of Enlightenment literature displays a distinct romantic idealism in its mistrust of science, but it captures the eighteenth century’s fascination with synthesizing apparently unlike things to produce new forms of thought – including intellectual and moral thought in particular – resulting from a collaborative effort among ostensible equals. Perhaps the most fundamental syntheses commonly found in French Enlightenment literature concern oppositions between, on the one hand, inert matter and sentient beings and, on the other, different types of human beings and the subjectivities they evince. Eighteenth-century literature frequently attempts to make sense of conflicting categories and confused identities. Unlike the verbal arts of the seventeenth century, which tended to test repeatedly the mettle of aristocratic and noble characters only to find them almost always undaunted, Enlightenment literature represents the totality of the contemporary social spectrum. Moreover, it frequently represented characters behaving not in character but against type: high-born landowners behaving foolishly, as well as commoners behaving nobly. Largely unbound by the rigid generic conventions that characterized seventeenth-century classicism, eighteenth-century literature investigated the different forms of knowledge – including perhaps most importantly self-knowledge – produced when ostensibly conflicting or competing ways of knowing collide. To pursue that investigation, it very often probed these forms of knowledge by looking at the problematic syntheses and indeterminate boundaries defining the material and spiritual in their most compelling and complex forms: the human subject.\n\nTo grasp the significance of eighteenth-century literature’s contributions to the production of knowledge and its investigation of human subjectivities, it is important to understand the seventeenth century’s commitment to traditional literary form and subject matter. Seventeenth-century French literature was, for the most part, highly rule-conscious and tightly bound to generic conventions. That was in large part because it was generally produced for a narrow segment of the population, one that promoted and consumed cultural productions that valorized nobility and aristocracy as a race, the character and valour of which were essential to the identity and survival of the nation. Adherence to the generic conventions of classical literature, especially according to the rules established by aestheticians such as Aristotle and Horace, provided this group a sense of historic continuity with a highly esteemed ancestry. Tragedy, for example, depicted highly born people in life- and identity-threatening situations that only the truly magnanimous could negotiate. Poetic verse in the seventeenth century developed complex rules of versification that prescribed highly elaborate specifications for syllabification, caesura and enjambment, meter and rhyme, including such arcane examples as the rime couronnée and rime emperière, rhymes that included multiple repetitions of final syllables at the end of a verse. Seventeenth-century French literature generally offered intricately formal self-conscious works that examined moral questions related to individuals’ obligations to themselves and to their restricted social group. During the Enlightenment, however, authors generally relaxed the rigidity with which they followed aesthetic rules and conventions while simultaneously directing their attention to depicting a broad segment of the social spectrum. Correlatively, diverse reading publics that critically responded to new literary productions arose, which in turn led to the establishment of new forms of subjectivity as readers identified with the different kinds of people they read about.\n\nTraditional literary genres\n\nFor most of the eighteenth century, the word littérature did not have the meaning it does today. In the dictionary of the Académie Française of 1762, the word littérature continued to evoke, as it had since the dictionary’s first edition in 1694, personal erudition rather than a corpus of texts. The Académie illustrates the usage of the word with the sentence ‘he is a man of great literature’ to indicate a highly knowledgeable and refined individual. (Not until 1798 does the word also refer to ‘all the literary production of a nation, a country’, and in 1835 the word littérature begins to signify ‘all the literary production of a nation, a country, a period’.) Lettres, or belles lettres, on the other hand, referred to an abstract and aesthetic use of language and ideas that was often defined either in opposition or as a complement to the sciences. Thus, expressing an idea that Mme de Staël would refine at the end of the century, the anonymous author of the article ‘Lettres’ in the Encyclopédie states that ‘the principles of the sciences would be too uninviting if letters did not lend them charm’.2 Furthermore, ‘gens de lettres’ (people of letters), those who have studied not only grammar but also poetry, geometry, history, eloquence, as well as philosophy, contribute to the good of the nation through the rigorous application of thought that has destroyed ‘all the prejudices that infected society’. ‘Gens de lettres’ are people who are highly cultured and who, through intense study, especially the application of philosophy, become ‘more united among themselves; they benefit more from society; they are the judges, and others are judged’.3\n\nThe outward turn of the concept of littérature from personal erudition to collections of texts illustrates the use to which the aesthetic use of language was put in the eighteenth century. Enlightenment literature was a tool for imagining, understanding and critiquing contemporary social relations. Activated in the critical capacities of writers and readers alike, literature provoked judgement and turned it outward to allow readers to engage with others, either physically (as in reasoned or other forms of public debate) or intellectually, in the form of criticism and new literary works. In both cases, the engagement with other readers that Enlightenment literature induced typically incited further critique and analysis; on occasion, however, it sometimes went so far as to engender outrage and physical altercation.\n\nThe power of Enlightenment literature to affect readers so deeply stems both from the circumstances in which literature was consumed and from the forms of literature with which readers engaged. Increased but varied access to education in France meant that close to 10 million people could sign their names by century’s end. Literacy likely doubled over the course of the century, and a favourable economy helped produce a reading audience with more time to consume and to react to literature. It is not clear, however, how many of those people formed part of a heterogeneous reading public, or, indeed, whether such a public existed at all.4 A diverse reading public required different kinds of literature and different literary forms. Enlightenment authors began to experiment more widely with form as they sought to imagine modes of thinking and being based not on the iconic religious and monarchic models that had characterized French classicism but on the exercise of individual critical judgement.\n\nOf the traditional genres, theatre was by far the most popular and perhaps the most provocative, mainly because it brought large numbers of people together in close quarters to focus their attention on actors and actresses – living, breathing bodies ritualistically enacting scenes of love, betrayal and tragedy. Moreover, because performers and public shared the same restricted space where they participated in theatrical performances which were also highly charged social events, the public’s reaction to what they saw influenced the actors and hence the production itself. While the seventeenth century witnessed the development and rapid expansion of classical tragedy, complete with its rigidly codified rules, and themes aimed at aristocratic and noble audiences, over the course of the eighteenth century theatre found ever-increasing audiences drawn from all walks of life, including labourers and people from the seamier sides of the population. The number of theatrical venues and the number of patrons they could accommodate increased enormously throughout the century. In Paris, for example, there were three public theatres serving patrons in 1750, and seven by 1789; across the country, twenty-seven theatres were constructed during that same period.5 The number of patrons attending theatrical productions increased at a similar rate: in 1700, Parisian theatres could accommodate roughly 4,000 spectators, with an increase to 6,000 by 1750 and 12,000 by the time of the Revolution.6\n\nEnlightenment theatre occurred in a number of forms, from more or less traditional tragedy to new theatrical manifestations which included light comedy and bourgeois drama. During the first half of the eighteenth century, theatrical forms included both comedy and tragedy. Enlightenment tragedy discontinued a number of the conventions of French classical tragedy of the seventeenth century, among which perhaps the most important was the precipitous fall of a great person due either to pride or to inherent qualities such as ancestry that they could not control. Tragedy in the eighteenth century developed new manners of depicting great people brought down by introducing more foreseeable circumstances that could have been avoided, and often by having such circumstances dependent on material causes such as mistaken identities. Claude Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon was the century’s first tragedian, with plays produced between 1705 and 1748. Crébillon is best known for his Rhadamiste et Zénobie (Rhadamiste and Zénobie) (1711), a violent tragedy of love and misrecognition – and not the tragic fall of a great person due to the failure to comprehend social or cultural circumstances. Voltaire , one of the century’s most versatile authors, wrote a number of tragedies, including Œdipe (Oedipus) (1718), which was based largely on Sophocles’ work but which introduced new characters and suggested new and controversial ways of thinking about monarchy founded not on a noble essence but on the heroic actions in which the king engages. Voltaire’s best-known tragedy is the orientalist Zaïre (1732), another work that takes on sensitive subject matter dealing with religion and politics. In this work, religious zeal and misrecognition lead to murder and mayhem as a jealous sultan, suspecting his betrothed of infidelity, murders her because she delays her wedding after having discovered her identity as a Christian. The tragedy has been interpreted as exhibiting the striking parallels between sexual jealousy and religious evangelism, making the work a living depiction of the potential dangers of religious thought. Voltaire took on the topic of religious zeal in another tragedy, Mahomet (Muhammad) (1742), which also represents unknown familial relationships, death and political strife as consequences of unscrupulous religious enthusiasm.\n\nPierre Carlet de Chamblain de Marivaux , also known for his novels, was a prolific author of light comedies. Active primarily between 1722 and 1746, and generally writing in prose for the Comédie-Italienne, one of the royally supported theatres, Marivaux penned works depicting problems associated with love, inconstancy and jealousy. Representing what today might be called the lower and middle classes, as well as the aristocratic class, Marivaux’s comedies introduced farcical elements, intense and rapid bantering and generally comic resolutions to the emotional duress the author put his characters through, typically in the service of determining whether their paramours’ love was true. Marivaux was fond of reversing social roles in his theatre, sometimes through cross-dressing and other means of disguising identity. Le Jeu de l’amour et du hasard (The Game of Love and Chance) (1730), one of Marivaux’s best known comedies, makes use of the devices of characters in disguise to determine others’ true feelings, the switching of social roles and the questioning of social conventions, in particular the conventions surrounding love and marriage at the time. La Double Inconstance (The Double Inconstancy) (1723) features Silvia, a young peasant woman, who is kidnapped and held in the residence of a prince who is enamoured of her. Silvia’s lover, Arlequin, is seduced by Flamina, one of the prince’s confidants. The prince disguises himself as a young officer and visits Silvia and eventually wins her love. The play ends with a double wedding uniting the two couples in what turns out to be their genuine love interests. Marivaux’s comedies typically ended – as indeed do most eighteenth-century comedies – with a happy resolution to the predicaments to which the social conventions under scrutiny led.\n\nFrench theatre was highly politicized throughout the Enlightenment. On the one hand, the works of Marivaux, Voltaire and others meted out biting satirical tragic and comedic critiques of the monarchy, of the strictures of religious thought and of many contemporary social practices, often those pertaining to social class. On the other hand, both playwrights and spectators frequently engaged in activities that were either politically themed or that constituted outright political action. Recent scholarship has stressed the intermixing of politics and theatre throughout the French Enlightenment, and some of the most provocative work involves not what was happening on the stage but what was going on in the parterre directly in front of it. In the eighteenth century, the word parterre referred both to the frequently boisterous floor space in front of the stage as well as to the equally raucous people who occupied it. The policing of the sometimes violent parterre contributed not only to the occasional modification of theatrical works but also to the creation of a French national identity.7 The parterre was furthermore seen as a space for the development of public criticism, as people learned from those around them how to refine their opinions and insert them into a public discourse critical of the artistic endeavours they witnessed. Jean-Baptiste du Bos , an eighteenth-century historian and critic, maintained that one did not have to be trained in the formal rules of theatre to have a critical response to it:\n\nWith the help of their internal instincts, all men can tell, without knowing the rules, whether artistic works are good or bad … We judge them through an internal movement that we cannot explain … Without knowing the rules, the parterre judges a theatrical work just as well as those in the business of theatre.8\n\nDu Bos’s insistence that the parterre could judge ‘without knowing the rules’ indicates the premium he placed on reason and critical observation: there is little room, in his view, for erudition. The anonymous author of the Encyclopédie entry ‘Parterre’ went even further than du Bos, suggesting that a play’s failure or success was due nearly exclusively to the judgement of the boisterous crowd; it is the members of the parterre ‘who decide on plays’ merits: we refer to the judgments, cabals, applause, and catcalls of the parterre’.9\n\nThe sentiment that ordinary people were capable of critically evaluating a work of art was a comparatively recent one, and it stems from the quintessential Enlightenment precept that judgement is an inherent faculty that anyone can develop through the exercise of reason. The development of critical judgement as applied to works of art was especially pronounced in eighteenth-century theatre because viewing publics consumed theatrical productions collectively and in close quarters, where shared individual responses incited almost immediate response. Furthermore, as Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht has pointed out, two other properties peculiar to the theatre encouraged the development of critical judgement. On the one hand, the actors and the audience experience the artistic production simultaneously, which leads to a ‘freedom of interactions’; and, on the other hand, while the information to be conveyed in the work of art is located in the script, it comes alive only in the work’s embodied performance. Thus, the theatrical experience is all the more powerful for teaching people to exercise their judgement because the theatrical experience much more closely approximates everyday experiences than does the act of reading alone.10\n\nThe critical exercise of judgement as undertaken through individual and collective response to theatre also had political consequences. The Enlightenment consisted, at least in part, in a dramatic shift in the form and nature of representation. That shift involved a move away from a singular and iconic mode of representation embodied by the absolute monarch to democratic – that is, representational – methods of depiction. Despite the move away from monarchic to representational politics, a comparatively small number of people continued to be political actors: that is, they allowed their representatives to engage in the work of politics. This situation might well help contextualize the work of Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais , whose theatrical work extended from 1767 to the end of the century. Beaumarchais was involved in a great deal of contemporary politics, including offering his support to the American Revolution and participating in events surrounding and following the French Revolution. His work explores contemporary political relations through both comedy and drama, and his three most famous plays – Le Barbier de Séville (The Barber of Seville), Le Mariage de Figaro (The Marriage of Figaro) and La Mère coupable (The Guilty Mother) – offer trenchant satirical critiques of the aristocracy. In Le Mariage de Figaro, for example, the title character, valet to a count, is engaged to Suzanne, who is also in the count’s employ. The count threatens to invoke his droit du seigneur, an ancient custom that would allow him to sleep with his servant’s wife on her wedding night. Figaro, in one of the most famous monologues in French theatre, lambastes the aristocracy and the system of privilege based on birth: ‘Just because you’re a powerful lord you think you’re a great intellect! … Nobility, wealth, rank, condition – all that makes you so proud! And what have you done to have so many advantages? You took the trouble to be born, and nothing more.’11\n\nFor some, Figaro’s on-stage diatribe against the aristocracy was merely the most straightforward manifestation of theatre’s relationship to politics. Jean-François Marmontel , a noteworthy eighteenth-century playwright and critic, found that the theatre’s sharpest political contribution was also its most subtle: the individual judgements it encouraged among members of the audience. Marmontel held that the parterre alone was capable of forming the kind of unified public opinion that could give identity to the nation and that such an identity would be of the people, and not of the aristocracy:\n\nif the parterre did not capture public opinion and unify it by bringing it into alignment with its own opinion, there would most often be as many different judgments of a work as there are loges in the theatre … It is true at least that this sort of republic that composes our performances would change in nature, and that the democracy of the parterre would degenerate into an aristocracy.12\n\nThe collective critical experience of the theatre contributed both to the lambasting of traditional political views and to the imagining of new ways to live in society.\n\nNew and evolving genres\n\nWhile theatre was a collective experience, the act of reading literature was primarily done in solitude, especially by the beginning of the eighteenth century. The most significant development in literary form during the eighteenth century was the novel, which, over the course of the century, developed more or less into the form of prose fiction we recognize today. The Enlightenment novel, which arguably begins in the last quarter of the seventeenth century, eschews generic convention and repudiates the formulaic, labyrinthine and wildly implausible narratives of the gigantic pastoral and heroic novels of the seventeenth century which were written by and for members of the aristocracy. Responding to existing reading publics and helping to create new ones, eighteenth-century prose fiction appeared in a wide variety of forms, including travel narratives, orientalist tales, utopian fiction, philosophical tales and libertine fiction. The tremendous variety of form and subject matter that the novel manifested across the century suggests that of all the verbal arts, eighteenth-century fiction is the most concerned with enlarging the scope of what it means to read and, as a corollary, how reading helps people find and identify with others like them and, if possible, form a community. Robert Darnton suggests that it is ‘impossible to generalize about the overall literary culture of eighteenth-century France because there might not have been any such thing’.13 Even if we rely on known quantitative data, Darnton maintains, we still do not know very much about what the French actually read during the Enlightenment. We can, however, speculate about reading based on the two types of literature extant during the Enlightenment: legal and clandestine. What the French read during the Enlightenment was determined at least in part by the way their books were published, and the publication of clandestine books was partially regulated by a system of taxes and tariffs designed to protect legitimate printers and booksellers. France’s financial regulation of the production and distribution of books made it easier to produce books outside of France for smuggling into the country, and, at the same time, it paved the way for publishers to make significant profits by counterfeiting legitimate works.\n\nClandestine works – those produced in France and those printed abroad and smuggled into French territory – were generally those that had been deemed offensive on political or moral grounds (and sometimes on both). By the latter quarter of the eighteenth century, the harsh economic conditions that restrictions on publishing imposed on printers and booksellers led to the publication of underground works. ‘Hard times forced [dealers] into lower reaches of illegality; for as they sank deeper into debt, they took greater chances in hope of greater profits.’14 Greater chances meant more subject matter diverging from traditional literary themes, and authors of Enlightenment novels had to establish a delicate balance between writing works with greater appeal to increasing reading audiences, which led to novels that were more realistic, and eschewing the charges of immorality that accompanied that same heightened attention to realism. Irreligion, immorality and incivility became the three charges most often levelled against clandestine publications. Not all French novels were published clandestinely, of course, but it is significant that novels in general came under the same charges of immorality and irreligion that were levelled against clandestine literature in general. To understand the significance and development of the Enlightenment novel, it is crucial to consider the history of its prohibition in France.\n\nAt least as far back as the middle of the seventeenth century, novels in France were deemed morally offensive as well as politically dangerous, both because they were thought to lack a literary ancestor – contemporaries found models of tragedy and lyric poetry in ancient Greece and Rome, but they found no examples of novels in Antiquity – and because novels sometimes depicted immoral subjects, especially illicit love. Novels were also judged inferior on literary grounds: those produced up until roughly the last quarter of the seventeenth century were deemed ponderous, unrealistic and generally formally uninteresting works. In addition, a point to which we will return, they were written by and for a very small segment of the social spectrum – notable aristocrats interested in promoting the meaning and value of their way of life.\n\nThe lack of a generic ancestor had both social and aesthetic consequences for the development of the novel, and it is often difficult to separate the political and the aesthetic when dealing with Enlightenment fiction. Because novels are virtually always written in prose, the contemporary concern was that readers would confuse them with the only other literary form consistently written in prose, namely, history. While prose is often considered to be a simple lack of form – that is, it seems to be a literary mode merely stripped of the formal conventions of verse and rhyme – its historical development shows that prose developed not so much as a loss of form but as a loss of reference – reference to a tradition of visible or otherwise identifiable authority representing power or some other specific guarantor of truth. Wlad Godzich and Jeffrey Kittay have argued that prose emerged when the message delivered was deemed more important than the form it took; prose thus represented the relinquishing of form deemed in excess of the message. The written text itself assumed the authority of the agentless, disinterested message, and prose came to be seen as the transparent vehicle best suited to communicate unprejudiced truth.15 Because history was written in prose, and because it was also almost always officially sponsored by royal authority, prose – in direct and specific opposition to verse – took on the patina of truth, even if, particularly in the seventeenth century, that truth had a decidedly noble and aristocratic edge. When new subjects began to be depicted in prose, many critics feared that the formal resemblance between novel and history might lead some to confuse fact and fiction, as well as lose sight of officially sanctioned truth. As a result, a startling new phenomenon arose: the formal resemblance between the two genres led some to speculate that new forms of truth were coming into being.\n\nIf prose stood in for neutral, disinterested truth, it was difficult for contemporaries to understand how two different literary genres could communicate alternative, sometimes competing, truths. The marquis d’Argens railed against those who made fiction that looked true: ‘It is surprising that a man, however accustomed he may be to lies, would not be ashamed to pass off a novel as true history.’16 Nicolas Lenglet Du Fresnoy compared history and the novel, finding that the novel communicated truth without necessarily being completely factually accurate:\n\nPeople may well condemn novels, but I don’t find in them all these objectionable things. Nothing in novels leads me into error; and if I am seduced, it is to my advantage. When I start reading a novel, I know that everything it contains is false: I am told so, and I believe it. There is always something to gain if the novel contains truth: I can benefit from it as soon as I am made to see it. However, there is always something for me to lose when I read history as soon as a fact turns out to be false.17\n\nThe vrai that Lenglet Du Fresnoy imagines finding in a novel differs from what one would expect to find in history primarily in its relationship to facts. While the slightest error can destroy a work of history, which depends on unimpeachable accuracy, truth in fiction develops subjectively and emotionally as readers sympathize with characters and their plights. In his Les Incas, ou, la destruction de l’empire du Pérou (The Incas; or, the Destruction of the Empire of Peru) (1777), Jean-François Marmontel makes a similar point as he attempts to represent the savagery with which the inhabitants of South America were treated by people he calls religious fanatics. Announcing that his goal is to make his reader detest such fanaticism by appealing to both facts and emotions, Marmontel describes the formal means through which he attempts to move his readers, which involves combining different literary forms with different relationships to truth: ‘As for the form of this work, considered as a literary production, I must confess that I do not know how to define it. There is too much truth within it for a novel, and not enough for history. I certainly did not have the presumption to write poetically.’18\n\nWriters developed ingenious techniques for lending a realistic feel to their works while simultaneously – and correlatively – experimenting with techniques for representing both a broader section of the social spectrum and aspects of daily life not previously depicted. Alain-René Lesage was one of the first eighteenth-century novelists to develop literary techniques for depicting a cross-section of the population with his satirical Diable boiteux (The Devil on Two Sticks) (1707), a fantasy in which a student, having just returned from a midnight tryst, encounters a demon whose areas of mischievous expertise include arranging inappropriate marriages and introducing luxury and debauchery into society. Asmodée, the devil in question, takes don Cléofas, the student, over the rooftops of the city, allowing him to peer through their roofs and into the dwellings to observe the unguarded inhabitants in their daily activities. The devil promises Cléofas: ‘In order to give you a complete understanding of human life, I want to explain what all the people you see are doing. I will show you the motives for their actions and reveal to you their most secret thoughts.’19 The device of depicting people unaware that they were being observed was used again in 1742 by Claude Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon in his Le Sofa. In this orientalist tale featuring metempsychosis (a recurring eighteenth-century fascination with the transmigration of souls among different bodies), Amanzéï, a formerly promiscuous person, is punished by his Brahman god by having his soul imprisoned in a sofa until such time as two virgins dedicate their love to one another on him. In the meantime, he is offered an unprecedented, unobstructed view into the lives of numerous Parisians, observing in intimate detail their attempts at love and seduction. Crébillon’s tale of passion and often despair offers a satirical view of contemporary social practices, especially as they concern people who attempt to rise in social status through the seduction of others (a topic dear to Crébillon, and one he had previously investigated in his Égarements du cœur et de l’esprit (Strayings of the Heart and Mind) [1736]).\n\nThe observation of contemporary social conventions, often in wry satiric form, animated a large number of Enlightenment novels, and it would not be an exaggeration to suggest that most fiction of the time engaged in some form of social critique. Charles-Louis de Secondat de Montesquieu modified the device of having characters observed without their knowledge in his Les Lettres persanes (Persian Letters) (1721), an orientalist epistolary novel featuring the Persian travellers Usbek and Rica who observe contemporary Parisian society from outsiders’ perspectives. A wry critique of Parisian culture and of contemporary gender politics, Les Lettres persanes introduces philosophy and politics into the novel in a very explicit way: Montesquieu himself famously wrote that ‘the author gave himself the advantage of being able to connect philosophy, politics, and morals to a novel, and to unite this ensemble by a secret and somewhat unknown chain’.20 Some novels participated in observations of contemporary social and political life in more pointed fashion, and works such as Voltaire’s Candide (1759) and ‘Micromegas’ (1752), both often referred to as philosophical fiction, performed in-depth investigations of intellectual matters such as the moral philosophy of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz or the critiques of religion that were engaging contemporary readers.\n\nVarious forms of Enlightenment philosophy surfaced in a great many Enlightenment novels, and forerunners of that philosophy made their way into fictional works as well. In Le Sofa, Crébillon experiments with metempsychosis, using it as a device to investigate the ramifications of Cartesian philosophy, a device other Enlightenment authors occasionally employed with satiric intent, perhaps most famously Voltaire in his philosophical tales ‘Zadig’ and ‘La Princesse de Babylone’. Crébillon’s Le Sofa pursues the radical split between thinking and extended substance – that is, mind and body – that Descartes had theorized a century before by causing Amanzéï’s soul to inhabit pieces of furniture as punishment for a previous life’s – the soul’s – sexual indiscretions with its body. Pursuing Cartesian logic, Crébillon allows Amanzéï’s soul its liberty only after two inexperienced lovers consummate their love on him – that is, unite the corporeal and sentimental components of their attachment. Crébillon’s fantastic, orientalist fiction underscores in ironic detail the ramifications of considering mind and body to be separate substances while simultaneously foregrounding objective observation as the sole means for discovering the truth about contemporary erotic behaviour in society. By century’s end, the marquis de Sade would experiment with dark and violent works of fiction that attempted to annihilate moral positions based on traditional notions of human subjectivity and its relationship to the body that contained it in his Justine (three versions published between 1787 and 1794) and Philosophie dans le boudoir (Philosophy in the Bedroom) (1795).\n\nDepicting people unaware of being observed and enjoying a candid view into their thoughts and motivations was a way of participating in the Enlightenment’s fascination with empiricism. It also permitted an investigation into the intersections and the distinctions between emotional and physiological responses to stimuli, particularly love. In marked opposition to the majority of British fiction of the same period, French Enlightenment novels depict embodied people in love and amorous behaviour. Not only do we get comparatively detailed descriptions of principal characters’ physiognomies (as opposed to the generic portraits of conventional beauty from the previous century), we also frequently find fairly specific to highly explicit scenes of sexual encounters and their aftermaths. Noteworthy examples include Antoine-François Prévost ’s L’Histoire du chevalier Des Grieux et de Manon Lescaut (Manon Lescaut) (1731), a tale of the unbridled passion a young man from a prominent family has for an adventurous young woman who professes love for him but is repeatedly unfaithful, and Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’s Liaisons dangereuses (Dangerous Liaisons) (1782), a libertine tale in epistolary form about two lovers who become rivals in love and sex and who use others erotically and in many cases degradingly in their attempt to achieve social ascendancy. A favourite device for representing the complexities of human emotion and the limits of philosophy to express that emotion was to show involuntary or unexpected corporeal response to desire, emotion or other forms of sentiment. Denis Diderot analysed the complex configuration of mind and body in such works as La Religieuse (The Nun) (published posthumously in 1796), which features explicit scenes of sexual relations between women in a convent and a disavowal by the first-person participant-narrator of the significance of those relations, and in Le Supplément au voyage de Bougainville (Supplement to Bougainville’s Voyage) (1772), in which a failure to recognize cross-cultural erotic conventions leads to unexpected and ostensibly irrepressible sexual encounters between a priest and a young woman at the request of her family.\n\nNot all Enlightenment novels dealing with desire and passion made use of explicit sexual depictions, although a surprising amount of non-erotic fiction articulates sentiment through the body. Jean-Jacques Rousseau ’s Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse (1761), the eighteenth century’s most highly acclaimed sentimental novel, recounts in epistolary form the story of Julie, a young aristocrat, and her tutor Saint-Preux, who fall passionately in love but cannot marry because of their social circumstances. La Nouvelle Héloïse depicts the lovers at first resisting, then succumbing to their passions, and then separating; and it depicts numerous deaths, Julie’s marriage to another man and finally the revelation that Julie never stopped loving Saint-Preux, a revelation that occurs only after her death. La Nouvelle Héloïse articulates the lovers’ frustrated passions against a backdrop of rigid social conventions, religious and natural philosophy, and the wisdom of leading a simple life removed from the distractions of the city.\n\nRecent work on La Nouvelle Héloïse has suggested that much of the sentimental nature of the work, with its insistence on pure, uncontaminated love, simplicity of lifestyle and devotion to ethics and natural philosophy, is articulated through and with the body of its heroine. Mary McAlpin finds that Rousseau occasionally depicts Julie’s body in coarse physical detail, and that when he describes the nature of her breasts, her responses to sexual stimulation, the formation of her illnesses and even the composition of her body after death he is relating a ‘physico-moral evolution’ that couples nature, the human body and religious and philosophical thought into an ordered system of natural virtue.21 More broadly, Helen Thompson and Natania Meeker have argued that novels’ depictions of sensate bodies and the truths those bodies voluntarily or otherwise evinced served to provide stability of meaning in a time when meaning was anything but fixed. Rousseau, like many of his contemporaries, also pinned onto the novel the power to change words into palpable effects on the flesh. In the preface to the novel he writes, ‘No chaste girl has ever read novels … She who … dares to read a single page [of this novel] is lost; but let her not attribute her downfall to this book – the evil was committed beforehand.’22\n\nRousseau’s attitude towards the transformative power of reading was similar to that of many of his contemporaries: literature can have profound effects on the way people live and understand themselves, and it can help them understand their worlds in ways that other discursive forms cannot. It can, in fact, change people’s lives. Whether such change would be salutary or pernicious was generally up for debate, and change was typically located in people’s critical capacities, in their social affiliations or in their corporeal response to texts. Mme de Staël looked back on the century and characterized philosophical literature as the guarantor of liberty because it encouraged the art of thinking and expressing oneself. Literature differed from the empirical domains in that it allowed observation not so much of the world but of the people who inhabited it. That meant that it encouraged people not only to glean information but to infer meaning from it as well, which helped them understand how different historical and cultural circumstances caused people to evaluate their worlds differently and to live accordingly. The consumption of literature in the Enlightenment encouraged the production of critique based on facts and the debates about their meanings. Such critique enabled citizens of the eighteenth-century Republic of Letters to consider the social, political, philosophical and moral conditions under which they lived and to decide how to take action upon them, whether individually or collectively."
