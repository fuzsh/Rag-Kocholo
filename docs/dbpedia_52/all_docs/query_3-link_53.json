        "text": "Message About ACM Off-Campus Study Programs\n\nACM has discontinued management of its three off-campus study programs (learn more). Students can still apply directly to affiliated programs.\n\nWhile the ACM Newberry Seminar: Research in the Humanities is discontinued, students and faculty can still participate directly with Newberry Library programs and activities. Find out more about the collection, see upcoming events, learn more about doing research at the Newberry, and even help the Newberry transcribe its digital collection.\n\nFaculty can continue to apply to the ACM Newberry short-term fellowships.\n\nProgram History\n\nThe ACM Newberry Seminar: Research in the Humanities challenged students to immerse themselves in a semester-long research project with the support of a community of scholars and the collections of one of the world’s finest research libraries.\n\nLed by distinguished faculty, students explored compelling, interdisciplinary themes in the humanities; developed their abilities as researchers; and produced substantial, well-documented research projects equivalent to a senior thesis or graduate-level work.\n\nThe Newberry Library\n\nAs one of the world’s premier independent research libraries, the Newberry Library’s evolving collections are rooted in the humanities and embrace the history and literature of Western Europe and the Americas.\n\nResources range anywhere from the Middle Ages to the mid-20th century. Some of the Newberry’s most exciting collections include a leaf from the Gutenberg Bible, French Revolution pamphlets, early American treaties, Chopin and Mozart manuscripts, and an edition of John Milton’s Paradise Lost in jeweled binding.\n\nThe Newberry is open to the public and has an active educational and cultural presence in Chicago. It offers a host of exhibits, lectures, classes, concerts, and other public programming. The library also provides public reading rooms and free wireless internet.\n\nPlease visit the Newberry Library website for more information.\n\nPast Seminar Topics & Faculty\n\nPlease see below for a list of past Newberry Seminar topics and visiting faculty directors since the program began in 1965.\n\n2019: One for the Books: The Pleasures & Politics of Reading – Ralph Savarese (English, Grinnell College) and Elizabeth Prevost (history, Grinnell College)\n\nThis seminar explores not just what people read but how, where, and why they read it. Students will tap the Newberry Library’s original source materials to investigate how, from Gutenberg to digital media, reading has offered a means of defining the self, encountering others, drawing lines of inclusion and exclusion, and imagining change.\n\n“Literacy has often been a weapon in political debates,” Grinnell English Professor Ralph Savarese says. “Take slavery, for example. Frederick Douglass once described the impact of learning to read like this: ‘The silver trumpet of freedom had roused my soul to eternal wakefulness.’ He knew what literacy meant and why slaves were forcibly kept from books.”\n\nSavarese and Grinnell Associate Professor of History Elizabeth Prevost will lead the Fall 2019 Newberry Seminar, “One for the Books: On the Pleasures And Politics Of Reading.”\n\nReadings and lectures on the inter-disciplinary study of reading itself will serve as a launch pad for participants to complete their own independent study using the Newberry’s research materials relating to the civilizations of Europe and the Americas.\n\nLetters, archival materials and other items make up the Newberry’s core collections in the areas of Chicago Studies, the D’Arcy McNickle Center for American Indian and Indigenous Studies, Center for Renaissance Studies, Hermon Dunlap Smith Center for the History of Cartography and more.\n\nFrom the history of the ABCs to mass media to the inner life of book readers through history, reading itself has come to be seen as worthy of study in itself. Prevost and Savarese will focus on readers on the margins of society.\n\nPrevost has researched Agatha Christie, seeking to understand how British-empire readers turned her from a provincial mystery writer into a global celebrity. Savarese became interested in marginalized readers after completing a book last year about reading literary fiction with autistic people across the spectrum (See It Feelingly: Classic Novels, Autistic Readers, and the Schooling of a No-Good English Professor).\n\n“We’re excited to be looking at very old stuff in the Newberry archives,” Savarese says. “This course is about rescuing those items and their significance from the abstractions of history and thinking deeply about what reading has done for – and to – homo sapiens.”Students in the class will also connect to readers and reading through field trips, such as visiting the Jane Addams’ Hull House Museum to get insight into how immigrants managed the pressure to assimilate. Guest speakers from area universities will bring expertise on the history and neurology of reading, offering new approaches to the social and physical worlds that readers inhabit.\n\nView the Syllabus\n\nFaculty\n\nRalph Savarese\n\nFaculty Co-Director 2019\n\nEnglish\n\nGrinnell College\n\nElizabeth Prevost\n\nFaculty Co-Director 2019\n\nHistory\n\nGrinnell College\n\n2018: Going and Knowing: Travelers and Travel Writers in the Modern World – Meira Kensky (religion, Coe College) and Amber Shaw (Coe College)\n\nTravelers were the original social networkers, forging connections between peoples and places while using a variety of media to share their experiences with the wider world.\n\nThe fall 2018 Newberry Seminar will explore the history and conventions of travel and travel writing, and what it means to be a traveler, tourist, pilgrim, explorer, or immigrant. Faculty and students will use travel as a way to think about how humans make meaning out of the world and how travel — and where we choose to travel — shapes what we know and how we interact with the world.\n\nThe Newberry Library’s vast collection of travel literature (both fictional and non-fictional), immigrant and pilgrimage narratives, guidebooks, maps, souvenirs, and ephemera will give students access to research materials for individualized projects in a wide variety of disciplines.\n\nDrawing on the Newberry Library’s vast collection of travel literature (both fictional and non- fictional), guidebooks, maps, souvenirs, and ephemera, the fall 2018 Newberry Seminar will explore the history and conventions of travel and travel writing in the modern world. How did the changes of the modern world affect the concept of travel itself? How did the technological innovations of the 20th and 21st centuries continue to expand our notion of the world and its boundaries (or lack thereof)?\n\nThe seminar will be interdisciplinary, with its core at the nexus of literature, history, and religion, as well as engagement with newer disciplines of tourism studies and human geography. We will read theory about travel as well as writers’ accounts of traveling throughout the United States, Europe, and other places around the globe. While we’ll begin and end the seminar in the US, throughout the semester we’ll study different modes of travel, such as immigration, pilgrimage, and the grand tour, in different places around the world and how they developed across three-and-a-half centuries.\n\nMaking meaning out of the world\n\nAs we draw on the Newberry Library’s collections in this seminar, we’ll use travel as a way to think about how humans make meaning out of the world, considering why we travel and what it means to be a traveler, tourist, pilgrim, explorer, or immigrant. We’ll also explore how travel — and where we choose to travel — shapes what we know and how we interact with the world around us. Does traveling abroad seem to magnify a sense of belonging in travelers writing about their experiences? Does this change whether one is on a tour or a pilgrimage? And in an age where knowledge of distant places is increasingly available through digital and virtual sources, why does the urge to travel endure?\n\nPart of our journey will be historical. The modern era saw the rise of technologies that made travel easier and more accessible than ever before. We’ll look at how the mechanisms of travel changed with the invention of the railroad and the ocean liner. Having access to the railway archives will bring students closer to the excitement of the opening of the new frontier. We’ll look at the widespread availability of the Baedeker and other guides and pore through some of them ourselves, asking how the way these guides present what people are going to see might have affected how they did see and experience these sites.\n\nAn explosion of travel writing\n\nWe’ll also look at how people wrote about their own experiences in foreign and strange lands, because along with this increased ability to travel came an explosion of travel writing. How did the narratives contribute to the way people made sense of the far-off and exotic? How did these narratives of early encounters and some cases first contact shape the way readers mapped the world and their place within it? And what about different kinds of travel? How is pilgrimage different from tourism, and how do they each participate in knowledge-creation? By focusing on how travel, representations of travel, and knowledge-production change in the modern world, this seminar will explore how modes of travel differ and yet somehow share similar modes of engagement and encounter.\n\nComparing immigrant, pilgrimage, and tourism narratives\n\nImmigrant narratives represent travel and the reasons for travel while also serving as vehicles for convincing people they are Americans; their rising popularity coincides with the rapid rise in immigrants coming to the United States post-Civil War.\n\nImmigrant narratives offer the opportunity to look at the ways in which people imagined what America should be, and what “going home” should look like, while pilgrimage narratives offer the opportunity to look at what people thought “going to God” entailed (or even “going home to God”). Tourism narratives participate in a discourse of “being away” and also play on the idea of “going to culture.”\n\nAll three of these types of literature draw on common conventions and modes of visualizing and consuming landscapes, encountering “others,” and situating oneself in a multi-faceted and increasingly connected world. All the genres also share in the goal of educating an increasingly literate public, and while the travelers and reasons for travel might be different, their expected audience is not necessarily so.\n\nThese narratives reflect a common experience of travel as being one of shared yet temporary community, and the tension between the solitary traveler and the fleeting communitas recurs in all these genres. Travelling elsewhere also involves looking inward and learning more about the self, topics that frequently emerge in these texts. We will consider these many topics alongside the history of modern tourism and why people have felt — and still feel — compelled to immerse themselves in other regions, countries, or cultures.\n\nExploring the Newberry collections\n\nWe expect students to be working with both the secondary and the primary sources in the Newberry’s general collection, along with the more specialized materials of the Edward E. Ayer and Everett D. Graff collections, the Rand McNally map archives, the Francis and Robert Tomes papers, and material from the Herman Dunlap Center for Cartography. We’re particularly excited for our seminar students to have access to the Newberry’s vast collection of Appleton, Murray, and Baedeker guides. The sheer breadth of this collection will reinforce the way these mass-market guidebooks changed travel in 19th and early 20th centuries. At the same time, we imagine the Newberry’s collection of 17th-century letter of introduction books, as well as their considerable holdings of 20th-century journals from foreign correspondents (most notably Edward Price Bell) will broaden students’ conceptions of travel and geography across the modern world.\n\nMore generally, the Newberry Library’s rich collection of cartography, travel writing, immigrant narratives, pilgrimage narratives, and other travel-related documents will afford students research materials for individualized projects from a wide variety of disciplines.\n\nStudents’ research projects\n\nThe heart of the semester will be students’ research projects. Our focus will invite students to think about travel, immigration, and mobility expansively — and why such a focus is necessary and productive in this increasingly digital and virtual age. Accordingly, students’ independent projects can draw from the wide resources at the Newberry and consider topics about travel broadly construed.\n\nWe imagine this course would be attractive to students from a variety of disciplines, including students pursuing work in museum studies, journalism, publishing, international relations, historic preservation, and ministry. Though the seminar is firmly grounded in the humanities, because of the wide range of primary sources we’ll draw upon in the seminar, we hope also to attract students from social sciences like anthropology and human geography. Students are naturally interested in travel, and the Newberry’s collections are unparalleled in this regard.\n\nImages are from the Curt Teich Postcard Archives Digital Collection. The archive, housed at the Newberry Library, is widely regarded as the largest public collection of postcards and related materials in the United States.\n\nMore about the seminar faculty and topic: Discovery Could be Just Around the Corner\n\nView the Syllabus\n\nFaculty\n\nMeira Kensky\n\nFaculty Co-Director, Fall 2018\n\nReligion\n\nCoe College\n\nAmber Shaw\n\nFaculty Co-Director, Fall 2018\n\nEnglish\n\nCoe College\n\n2017: Nature and Culture in the Metropolis – William Davis (German and comparative literature, Colorado College) and Eric Perramond (environmental & Southwest studies, Colorado College)\n\nThe fall 2017 seminar theme explores the themes of nature and culture within the context of Chicago. Whether you’re studying anthropology, geography, environmental history, or another subject in the liberal arts, you will gain valuable research experience while growing as a writer.\n\nNature vs. Civilization\n\n“Nature” vs. “Civilization” represents one of the fundamental dichotomies of the Western tradition, at least since the time of Homer’s Odyssey, appearing through the years with many variations. In the 18th century, Rousseau gives these concepts a modern twist by insisting that inequality was “almost non-existent in the state of nature,” that it “derives its force and its growth from the development of our faculties and the progress of the human mind, and finally becomes fixed and legitimate through the institution of property and laws.”\n\nIn this way inequality, and its myriad attendant ills, become equated with civilization, while the state of nature becomes a scene of inherent unity and fairness. Artifice vs. nature; sophisticated vs. primitive; the city vs. the country: these are only a few variations of the basic dichotomy that have arisen over the past few centuries.\n\nIn America, the rise of urbanity and the industrial revolution only increased the tension between these dichotomous concepts. No city better exemplifies the American version of the struggle between nature and polis, pasture and skyscraper, than Chicago. The concepts of nature and culture are fundamental to the Western condition. In most cultural settings around the globe, nature and culture mean very different things to different peoples. Cities, however, are now universal to humanity even as we cope with their meaning for our relationship to or with nature.\n\nExplore Chicago and the Newberry Library\n\nWhile the fall 2017 Newberry seminar will pivot on the period between 1800 and the 1960s, it will draw on other places, authors, and periods for comparative purposes. For instance, what can past ideas, histories, and geographies of urbanized human natures tell us about how to make cities sustainable in the 21st century?\n\nThe seminar will explore nature, culture, and the metropolis to foster rich, challenging seminar discussions using the Newberry’s collections and Chicago’s setting. Newberry core collections will serve as examples during the seminar alongside core readings. Participants will then engage in independent exploration of these themes and produce individual research papers later in the semester.\n\nStudents will use the Newberry’s collections and Chicago’s setting as they examine these broad themes, develop their skills as researchers within a community of scholars, and complete a substantial written paper.\n\nFor information about the Newberry’s holdings, visit www.newberry.org/research.\n\nView the Syllabus\n\nFaculty\n\nWilliam Davis\n\nFaculty Co-Director, Fall 2017\n\nGerman and Comparative Literature\n\nColorado College\n\nEric Perramond\n\nFaculty Co-Director, Fall 2017\n\nEnvironmental and Southwest Studies\n\nColorado College\n\n2016: Novel Action: Literature, Social Movements, and the Public Good – Tori Barnes-Brus (sociology and anthropology, Cornell College) and Rebecca Entel (English and creative writing, Cornell College)\n\nWhat is social reform? Who are reformers and what are their motivations? What is the relationship between “words and deeds,” literature and action?\n\nThe fall 2016 Newberry Seminar will operate at the intersection of literature, social movements, and the public humanities. In readings from America’s “Age of Reform” to contemporary reform efforts, we will explore the relationship between literary and social movements that address multiple systems of oppression and discrimination.\n\nStudents will gain hands-on experience with the Newberry Library’s unique collections and will trace Chicago’s long history of social action through visits to historic sites such as Hull House and neighborhoods where activists are currently working to effect social change.\n\nBy connecting literature to context and to practice, students will investigate the complex web among writers, communities, social issues, and social change and will embark upon their own research projects as acts of civic engagement. Training as independent researchers, students will learn to share, test, challenge, and develop new ideas within a strong scholarly community of faculty, librarians, archivists, writers, and activists.\n\nWith its focus on the relationship between literature and society, the fall 2016 Newberry Seminar will raise questions about the social function of writing and how students’ own archival projects can contribute to the public humanities.\n\nThe Newberry’s resources\n\nThe course will draw on many of the Newberry’s core collections, including its unparalleled collection of manuscripts related to settlements, social action, and clubs and organizations; vast holdings on the library’s own history; and cartographic materials relevant to Progressive-era Chicago. Working with these collections will teach students about many activist-writers and organizations they may want to research beyond those in our case studies.\n\nThe Newberry holdings related to this interdisciplinary topic can lead to fascinating independent projects for students interested in literature, sociology, anthropology, history, urban studies, women’s studies, African-American studies, and even philosophy and religion. Secondary themes such as the home, immigration, and civil rights, will thread through all of the units and provide springboards for student projects, as well.\n\nFor information about the Newberry’s holdings, visit www.newberry.org/research.\n\nView the Syllabus\n\nFaculty\n\nTori Barnes-Brus\n\nCornell College\n\nSociology and Anthropology\n\nRebecca Entel\n\nCornell College\n\nEnglish and Creative Writing\n\n2015: Knowing Your Place: Human and Social Geography – Ian MacInnes (English, Albion College) and Marcy Sacks (history, Albion College)\n\nThe information age has increasingly privileged the virtual over the real, from social media to digital archives. Historically, however, humans have defined themselves in part through a sense of place, both geographical and social, and we continue to inhabit physical places and warm bodies. The sense of physical or geographical place as the foundation for cultural and individual identity permeates texts throughout Western history. Society has been dominated by the tension between a sense of belonging and community implied in having a place and the oppression implied in being told to know one’s place.\n\nThe fall 2015 seminar will use the resources of the Newberry Library to explore the documentary evidence of a sense of place from the ancient world to the modern era, to interrogate the current trend away from the embodied and toward the virtual, and to examine the role of the archive itself in a digital era. We also will draw on Chicago itself — the place the students will be living — with its neighborhoods, festivals, architecture, and rich place-specific history.\n\nIn addition to serving as a tantalizing introduction to the variety of collections at the Newberry and to the abundant conceptual possibilities inherent in “place,” the seminar material is also designed to develop students’ skills as scholars and writers, enabling them to turn ideas, interests, and curiosities into full-fledged scholarly projects. Writing will be a large part of our teaching strategy, including in-class “write-to-learn” moments and a required research blog in which students will constantly articulate their claims, their methods, and the challenges they encounter.\n\nThe Newberry’s resources\n\nStudents will find the library’s collections to be a vast and stimulating resource for their research. Since “place” is so often tied to geography, we plan to explore the Newberry’s remarkable cartographic collections. To back our discussions about the seminar’s physical location in Chicago, we will draw on the library’s extensive historical and literary materials related to the city. As we develop the symbolic and metaphorical associations of place, including constructions of race and class, the Newberry’s strength in Native American and American materials (notably the Ayers collections) will be valuable, as will its holdings in 19th century popular periodicals and in early modern literature of exploration and travel.\n\nFor information about the Newberry’s holdings, visit www.newberry.org/research.\n\nSyllabus\n\nFaculty\n\nIan MacInnes\n\nAlbion College\n\nEnglish\n\nMarcy Sacks\n\nAlbion College\n\nHistory\n\n2014: Knowledge and Technology: from Socrates to the Digital Age – Bridget Draxler (English, Monmouth College) and Hannah Schell (philosophy & religious studies, Monmouth College)\n\nWho produces knowledge? How is it organized? Who has access to it? This seminar will explore the relationship between knowledge, technology, and power, and provide students with a chance to reflect upon and engage in the activity of creating, organizing, and accessing knowledge in a digital age.\n\nKnowledge and technology undergird both the content and the form of the seminar, and the seminar’s cross-disciplinary readings represent literary, philosophical, historical, and religious perspectives.\n\nWe will trace the dominant trajectory in Western thought regarding knowledge that begins with the ancient Greeks and then, drawing upon the work of Nietzsche and Foucault, critically interrogate how our categories come to seem natural, beyond history and human agency.\n\nAt the same time, we will discuss the interplay of knowledge and technology in the 21st century, the value of the archive in a digital age, collaborative knowledge-creation online, and the ethics of digitization and digital preservation. We will consider the digital humanities not only as a way of using digital tools to conduct humanities research, but as a way of using humanities questions to address the digitization of culture.\n\nStudents will be encouraged to explore the possibilities of digital publishing for their own research, complementing traditional research papers with digital maps, interactive timelines, multimedia texts, online forums, and dynamic web pages to supplement their arguments.\n\nBy experimenting with new forms of digital publishing, students will actively engage and participate in the democratization of knowledge in a digital age.\n\nThe Newberry’s resources\n\nStudents in the fall 2014 Newberry Seminar will find the library’s collections to be a vast and stimulating resource for their research.\n\nFor example, students may wish to explore the Newberry’s extensive holdings on book arts and book history, the history of printing and publishing, and the history of libraries and archives.\n\nThe library’s collection extends well beyond books, encompassing a world-class assemblage of maps, letters, diaries, scrapbooks, broadsides, ephemera, music, photographs, paintings, prints, drawings, and much more.\n\nFor information about the Newberry’s holdings, visit www.newberry.org/research.\n\nSee a list of student research topics from the Fall 2014 seminar.\n\nView the Syllabus\n\nFaculty\n\nBridget Draxler\n\nMonmouth College\n\nEnglish\n\nHannah Schell\n\nMonmouth College\n\nPhilosophy & Religious Studies\n\n2013: Representing the Other in Image, Text, and Landscape – William Davis (comparative literature & German, Colorado College) and Eric Perramond (environmental science & Southwest studies, Colorado College)\n\nThe Fall 2013 Newberry Seminar in the Humanities will focus on encounters between the “Old” World and the “New” World from the early-modern period to the 20th century. We will examine maps, literary and philosophical texts, images, as well as historical and anthropological records, as a means of discovering how the encounter with the “new world” became a transformative force that would leave the Old World forever tormented by the haunting specter of the “other” just as it had dramatic, and often shattering consequences for indigenous peoples.\n\nTogether we will consider such questions as: How did this new world, this new paradise, come to be transformed? How did Europeans and indigenous American groups view each other at first and over time? What were the long-term environmental and cultural changes wrought from these repeated encounters as Old World met New World? How did European thinkers deploy this vision of otherness in particular forms of cultural representation? What was the response from indigenous communities? How did the notion of the other change with the arrival of African peoples into the Americas?\n\nIn the first half of the semester students will study texts relevant to this topic, as they also become familiar with methods of conducting research in general and working in the Newberry Library specifically. In the second half of the semester students will conduct their own research, and create their own document of their findings, drawing on the rich resources the Newberry Library has to offer.\n\nThroughout the semester faculty and students will work closely together in the process of framing a topic of investigation, conducting research, and creating scholarly texts that can share our discoveries with a wider audience.\n\nThe Newberry’s resources\n\nParticipants in the Fall 2013 Seminar will find the Newberry Library’s collection to be a vast and stimulating resource for exploring encounters between the Old and New Worlds.\n\nThe Library’s huge collection of maps will interest students working in a number of areas beyond geography itself. We might wish to consider how Europeans chose to represent the Americas, what they put in, left out, invented and imagined. These maps are also aesthetic objects in themselves—artistic encounters, if you will, with the New World.\n\nThe Hermon Dunlop Smith Center also offers specific support for the study of cartography and the amazing map collections the Newberry holds.\n\nThe Edward E. Ayer Collection is one the best collections focused on Native Americans and indigenous peoples in the world. Scholars from across the globe, who are interested in history and representations of Native Americans, come to the Newberry to take advantage of this collection.\n\nView the Syllabus\n\nFaculty\n\nWilliam Davis\n\nColorado College\n\nComparative Literature & German\n\nEric Perramond\n\nColorado College\n\nEnvironmental Science & Southwest Studies\n\n2012: Wild Cities: The Nature of the Modern Metropolis – Brian Bockelman (history, Ripon College) and David Miller (English, Allegheny College)\n\nThe Fall 2012 Seminar will examine the history, literature, and geography of the new mega-cities that emerged in the Americas between 1850 and 1950, taking Chicago and Buenos Aires as its point of departure and exploring two distinct but interrelated understandings of what made the modern metropolis “wild.”\n\nThe first is environmental. Although seemingly divorced from nature, modern cities developed their own ecology, extracted considerable resources from their natural surroundings, and remained perennially subject to natural disasters.\n\nThe second is cultural. Thanks to its colossal size, unstable politics and populations, and artistic dynamism, the modern metropolis came to be seen as a new kind of wilderness, complete with its own distinctive flora — skyscrapers, monuments, factories, parks — and fauna, with workers, bosses, flâneurs, bohemians, street vendors, prostitutes, and neighborhood toughs.\n\nWhile some at the time feared this new “wild” side of the city, others embraced its creative potential or sought to channel its energy.\n\nDuring the first half of the semester, the seminar will meet regularly to explore the Newberry’s collections and to discuss common historical and theoretical texts, urban literature, city maps and plans, and popular music — especially tango and jazz. In the second half of the semester, students will conduct original, extensive research using the Newberry’s multi-disciplinary and cross-cultural resources. Throughout, faculty and students will examine the role of conversation and debate in shaping scholarly inquiry (framing questions), research (investigation into the sources), and writing (developing conclusions).\n\nThe Newberry’s resources\n\nParticipants in the Fall 2012 Seminar will find the Newberry Library’s collections endlessly stimulating. There are vast holdings relating to various aspects of Chicago, including environmental and ecological themes, booster literature and guidebooks, diverse materials on westward expansion, and the personal papers of artists, writers, city planners, and activists.\n\nLike Theodore Dreiser, in writing The Titan (1914), students may want to research Charles T. Yerkes, Chicago’s streetcar Czar and the model for Dreiser’s protagonist Frank Cowperwood, offering insight into Chicago’s amazing economic development.\n\nThose of a literary bent can consult the Newberry’s extensive holdings in regional literature, exploring the cultural relationship between hub and frontier tied to this development. The city’s giddy expansion in the late 19th and early 20th centuries is further illuminated by the Chicago Region Map Collection, along with photographic resources.\n\nPopular culture enthusiasts will find a motherload of material in the Driscoll Collection of American Sheet Music.\n\nStudents interested in the settlement house movement can examine the extensive papers of Graham Taylor, a leading figure in this effort to “tame” the city’s wildness.\n\nThose who instead wish to focus their research on Buenos Aires will find plenty of materials relating to their interests in the Edward E. Ayer and William B. Greenlee collections as well as elsewhere.\n\nFaculty\n\nBrian Bockelman\n\nRipon College\n\nHistory\n\nDavid Miller\n\nAllegheny College\n\nEnglish\n\n2011: Crossing Boundaries – Diane Lichtenstein (English, Beloit College) and Linda Sturtz (history, Beloit College)\n\nThe Fall 2011 Seminar will focus on geographic, national, racial/ethnic, and gender role boundaries and the myriad ways in which those boundaries were crossed and re-crossed between 1492 and 1900 as Europeans traversed the Atlantic, indigenous people con-fronted newcomers, and Africans crossed the ocean and cultures, usually by force. It will also emphasize the constructions and representations of identities in the border spaces.\n\nFrontiers, borders, and “middle grounds” define the geographic and cultural spaces that shape the experiences of people living in locations where interactions with “others” are common. “Boundary crossing” is an especially rich topic for research in the humanities and social sciences—and especially for the unique collections of the Newberry Library.\n\nDuring the first half of the semester we will meet regularly to explore the Newberry’s collections and to discuss common texts including Native Americans’ representations of Europeans, slaves’ own accounts of their lives, popular fiction, photographs, and music. We will also study maps to understand how people and ideas “flowed” across geographic and national boundaries. In addition we will study theories about boundaries, their crossings, and the cultural genesis that occurs in those border spaces.\n\nDuring the second half of the semester, students will conduct original, extensive research using the Newberry Library’s multi-disciplinary and cross-cultural resources. Throughout the semester we will examine the role of scholarly conversation and debate in shaping inquiry (the questions scholars ask), research (investigation into the sources), and writing (framing conclusions).\n\nNewberry Resources\n\nFor participants in the Fall 2011 Seminar, the Newberry Library’s collections hold extraordinary riches for exploring the topic of boundary crossing. Countless opportunities exist for significant independent research in many fields. History majors and Art students can investigate the Edward E. Ayer Collection which contains 1,350 single manuscripts and manuscript collections written by both whites and Indians as well as photographs and art works. Students from any discipline with a reading knowledge of French, German, Spanish, Latin or Portuguese will be able to delve into seldom-used texts in those languages by individuals who crossed geographic borders throughout the Americas such as Humboldt’s 1811 account of Mexican culture including its technological achievements, Dominican friars’ accounts of their missions among the Mixtec and Chochona peoples of Mexico, or early French accounts of their settlements in the Caribbean, Canada, or New Orleans. Creative Writing majors can examine nineteenth-century mid-western literary journals such as the Prairie Flower. Women’s/Gender Studies students can compare the ways in which gender roles operated among groups that met in the “borderlands” of contact. Religion majors might want to explore new acquisitions from Lane Theological Seminary in the context of antebellum American Protestantism. And Music students can explore the Driscoll collection of early U.S. printed sheet music.\n\nSyllabus\n\nFaculty\n\nDiane Lichtenstein\n\nBeloit College, English\n\nLinda Sturtz\n\nBeloit College, History\n\n2010: On the Road: Intercultural Encounters in Europe and the Americas – David George (modern languages and literatures, Lake Forest College) and Benjamin Goluboff (English, Lake Forest College)\n\nFrom explorers to immigrants to tourists, ours is a world in motion. Ancient peoples followed the movement of wild game. Native Americans migrated across the continent. Africans were brought to the Western Hemisphere against their will. Nineteenth-century Americans looked for whatever was beyond the frontier, while their children and grandchildren visited Europe to soak up the culture. Whatever the motive, humans are rarely still.\n\nThe Fall 2010 Newberry Seminar in the Humanities will take a cross-cultural and interdisciplinary look at travel and travel writing – surveying Europe, Latin America, and the United States – across more than 400 years of history. The seminar will compare European experiences and texts with their New World counterparts from the United States and Latin America.\n\nThe first five to six weeks of the seminar will focus on group reading and discussion, looking at travel narratives from the ages of European discovery and conquest, the American frontier, and modern tourism. Through these readings and discussions, seminar participants will encounter a representative body of travel accounts while being introduced to the Newberry’s extraordinary collections, refining their individual research projects, and developing critical perspectives.\n\nThe heart of the seminar will be students’ independent research. While research projects need not be about travel, the Newberry’s holdings are a splendid resource for the study of travel and travel writing. The collections about the European exploration and settlement of North America are virtually bottomless. Students can explore Cortes’s first reports from the Americas, discover how American Indians’ maps of the land compared to John Smith’s, trace how the Grand Canyon – described by early explorers as a wasteland – was rehabilitated as a national treasure and tourist destination.\n\nThe Newberry offers extensive holdings in European and North American travel guides, rare accounts of U.S. tourists abroad, and documents and ephemera relating to the development of the railroads in North America. The Library’s extensive cartography collection has a wealth of maps and atlases, from 15th-century portolan charts that guided sailors through the Mediterranean to 20th-century tourist road maps of the American West.\n\nThis seminar will present many opportunities for students in a variety of fields. Historians will be able to delve into voyages of discovery and conquest, colonial life, independence movements, slavery, and the experience of Native Americans. Philosophers can consider how travel accounts influenced Rousseau’s conception of human nature. Students interested in literature can look at fictional and non-fictional travel narratives, including first editions of More’s Utopia, Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, Baum’s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland and many more.\n\nFor students particularly interested in Latin America, the Newberry’s Edward E. Ayer Collection on the American Indian and the William B. Greenlee Collection on Portuguese and Brazilian history will be very useful. Here they will find material relating to travel in the Spanish and Portuguese colonies and subsequent republics. Those in religious studies will be able to look at 400 years of Catholicism in Spain and the Americas, religious practices of Native Americans, and African traditions in the New World such as vodun, santería, and macumba.\n\nThe Newberry seminar can be a decisive experience for humanities majors who consider a future in graduate study. It fosters a collaborative spirit among its participants who live and work together on Chicago’s Gold Coast, and offers the opportunity to work closely with Newberry staff as well as with the two ACM faculty members who lead the program.\n\nFaculty\n\nDavid George\n\nLake Forest College, Modern Languages and Literatures (Ph.D. University of Minnesota)\n\nBenjamin Goluboff\n\nLake Forest College, English (Ph.D. University of Pennsylvania)\n\n2009: Placing Race: Investigating the History and Memory of Racial Pasts – Jane Rhodes (American studies, Macalester College) and Lynn Hudson (history, Macalester College)\n\nStudents will have the opportunity to discover and investigate the meanings attached to race across time and space. This seminar will draw on the groundbreaking scholarship about histories of race, race relations, and racial representations that are the foundation of interdisciplinary fields such as American Studies, Ethnic Studies, and Cultural Studies, as well as United States history. The seminar’s location at the Newberry Library enables students to have access to a world-renowned collection of manuscripts, documents, visual culture, and other primary sources that can shape our understanding of race from the colonial era to the present. Students will have the opportunity to conduct research guided by two scholars who are experts in the field.\n\nOne of the central tenets of this scholarship—and of this seminar—is that meanings attached to race are historically constructed and dependent upon a number of constitutive conditions such as gender, class, and status (free or slave, for example). Definitions of race also depend upon time and place. The way we often explain this in an introductory class would be to use the example that a person called “colored” in Jamaica in 1850 would be “black” in New Orleans. We have found that the best scholarship on racial construction—whether the place under investigation is France, Canada, or Ghana—makes these frameworks explicit.\n\nStudents in the twenty-first century have important questions about the role and representation of race in their world. Recent developments in the U. S. presidential campaign, for example, make explicit the significance attached to shifting meanings of racial identity. Sadly, students rarely have a chance to explore the history of these meanings and to see for themselves—and in the archives—how meanings of race take shape, and how they change over time and space.\n\nThere will be four workshop themes:\n\nNative America and the U.S. West,\n\nSlavery and Abolition,\n\nOrientalism at Home and Abroad, and\n\nThe Great Migration.\n\nThese topics will guide the seminar’s reading and provide background for student research. Student’s will be encouraged to make use of resources across the city of Chicago.\n\nAfter four weeks of intensive study and proposal writing, students will launch into their independent research. The group will come together in a regular collaborative workshop to report on their progress, give each other feedback and suggestions, and discuss inevitable problems and roadblocks. Students will also meet independently with faculty to review their research. The culmination of the semester will be a research symposium, designed by the students, in which they will present the results of their research.\n\nFaculty\n\nJane Rhodes\n\nAmerican Studies and Dean for the Study of Race and Ethnicity, Macalester College (PH.D. University of North Carolina)\n\nLynn Hudson\n\nHistory, Macalester College (PH.D. University of Indiana)\n\n2008: Community and Memory: Texts, Images and Monuments – Ellen Joyce (history, Beloit College) and Hannah Schell (philosophy & religious studies, Monmouth College)\n\nThe 2008 Newberry Seminar in the Humanities will investigate the intersection of community and memory in Western culture, from the Middle Ages to the present.\n\nHow do communities remember their past and how do those narratives of memory influence the present? How do such narratives form the identity of a community, whether social, political or religious in nature? How does literature reflect or reshape memory? How do communities remember their dead? Seminar participants may look at a variety of communities, from medieval monks and nuns to Mormons on the American frontier, from planned communities such as the Pullman company in South Chicago to more abstract notions such as “textual communities.”\n\nFollowing the usual practice of the Newberry Seminar, the class will meet regularly over the first weeks of the semester to discuss common readings that will provide a shared context and language for the seminar’s work. The seminar will be structured thematically, focusing on the relationship between reading, writing and memory; theories about “community” and “memory”; and explorations of various types of community (intellectual, religious, national, ethnic and political). The seminar will also take advantage of the Library’s setting, using the city of Chicago as a “text” to be explored through social activities and field trips.\n\nThe heart of the seminar will be students’ individual research, supported by the seminar faculty and the Library staff. In the early weeks of the term, Library staff will visit the class to introduce the Newberry’s eclectic and fascinating collections, including novels, histories, philosophical treatises, plays, and maps. During this time, students will meet one-on-one with the seminar faculty to develop their independent research topics. As they begin their own explorations of the Library’s collections, students will present their discoveries in class.\n\nThroughout the second half of the term, students typically spend most of their time working independently, allowing them to dig deeply into their own interests and the Library’s wealth of materials to produce a substantial research paper, usually in the range of 60 pages. Students continue to meet with the seminar faculty and Library staff throughout the term, receiving guidance as their research projects develop. Each student also connects with a mentor from among the Newberry’s resident scholars who can offer advice on research, writing or careers. At various points during the term, students will present their works-in-progress to their colleagues and critique each other’s work. During the last week they will make formal presentations of their research to the Newberry community.\n\nThis seminar’s broad topic lends itself to research in a variety of disciplines. Students with literary interests might look at how a novelist’s community shapes storytelling or how literature can serve to preserve certain aspects of a community’s experience while silencing other voices. History majors could research how a particular document does or does not reflect historical memories or could explore the tensions between various ways of constituting and defining identity. Religion majors could investigate memorials as ritual sites. Students of sociology or anthropology might focus on a particular community within Chicago and explore how it has historically constructed its identity.\n\nWhile students are encouraged to write on topics connected to the theme of the seminar, any topic appropriate to the Newberry collection, and identified early in the semester, may be chosen by a student with a particular research interest.\n\nFaculty\n\nEllen Joyce\n\nHistory, Beloit College (Ph.D., University of Toronto)\n\nEllen Joyce studies the history of Medieval Europe and is especially engaged with questions about the role that the medieval church played in shaping Western European culture between the eighth and twelfth centuries…\n\nHannah Schell\n\nReligious Studies, Monmouth College (Ph.D., Princeton University).\n\n1965-2007 Topics\n\n2007: Words and Deeds: Speech and Action in Western Culture – Kevin Miles (philosophy, Earlham College) and Robert Southard (history, Earlham College)\n\n2006: On the Road: Intercultural Encounters in Europe and the Americas – David George (foreign languages and literatures, Lake Forest College) and Benjamin Goluboff (English, Lake Forest College)\n\n2005: The Problem of Slavery and Visions of Freedom in Western Culture – Robert Bennett (classics, Kenyon College) and Glenn McNair (history, Kenyon College)\n\n2004: Encountering Worlds: Human Views of Nature – Carol Neel (history, Colorado College) and John Horner (psychology, Colorado College)\n\n2003: Picturing the Past: Studies in the Visual Representation of History – Clay Steinman (communication studies, Macalester College) and Paul Solon (history, Macalester College)\n\n2002: Confluence of Cultures: Histories and Fictions of the Americas – Gilberto Gómez-Ocampo (modern languages, Wabash College) and James Fisher (theatre, Wabash College)\n\n2001: Religion and Secularism – David Spadafora (history, Lake Forest College) and Richard Mallette (English, Lake Forest College)\n\n2000: Enlightenment Dreams/Enlightenment Realities – James Diedrick (English, Albion College) and Deborah Kanter (history, Albion College)\n\n1999: Art and Culture – James Martin (music, Cornell College) and Susan Wolverton (theater arts, Coe College)\n\n1998: Unmasking Gender – Carla Zecher (French, Coe College) and Terry Heller (English, Coe College)\n\n1997: The Contested Past: Histories and Fictions of Human Conflict – Robert Warde (English, Macalester College) and Paul Solon (history, Macalester College)\n\n1996: Landscape and Culture – Juliana Mulroy (biology, Denison University) and William Nichols (English, Denison University)\n\n1995: The Paradox of Slavery and Freedom in the Western World – Harry M.
