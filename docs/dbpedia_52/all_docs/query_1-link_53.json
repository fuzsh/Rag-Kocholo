While Latinx literature draws on literary traditions that span more than 400 years, our course will focus on more contemporary forms of the tradition, its “canon,” and how authors are currently “queering” this canon. Emphasizing the historical and aesthetic networks established in the Latinx literary canon that continue into the present while exploring the relationship between genre and socio-historical issues, we will read from a diverse tradition and range of genres that reflect the contested definition of “Latinx” and its shifting demographics in the U.S. We will also investigate how U.S. Latinx literature speaks to and expands “American” literary traditions, and how unique ethnic identities such as Mexican American, Nuyorican, Cuban American, and Dominican American offer different yet interconnecting representations of what it means to be Latinx in the U.S. This class ultimately underscores the heterogeneity of Latinx literature and asks how particular generic conventions stage the constructions of race, gender, sexuality, and class to establish a historically grounded understanding of the diverse literary voices and aesthetics that comprise U.S. Latinx literature.\n\nThis course traces the history of Italian cinema from the silent era to the new millennium, highlighting its main trends and genres, and reflecting on the major transformations modern and contemporary Italian society experienced over the twentieth and twentieth-first centuries. We shall examine iconic films such as Vittorio De Sica’s Bicycle Thieves, Federico Fellini’s La Dolce Vita, Michelangelo Antonioni’s L’Avventura, and Pier Paolo Pasolini’s Mamma Roma, that received international recognition and influenced other national, cinematic productions. We shall also look at the work of less famous, or independent filmmakers who received less critical attention. While this class takes an historical approach, it also includes a theoretical component and introduces students to the specificity of the cinematic language, examining films in relation to the mise-en-scène, frame composition, camera movements, editing, and sound.

This course will explore some of the major factors that contributed to the rise of Italian fashion and Italian industrial design as iconic all around the world. The classes will focus on the main protagonists and art movements that influenced the development of Italian style. We will analyze trends, clothing, and style not only in a historical context, but also through a critical apparatus that will include themes related to gender, culture, power, and politics.The course is taught in English.

Yet, in an era of deforestation and climate change, Amazonia itself might be on the verge of disappearance, with disastrous consequences for the world. This course proposes interdisciplinary perspectives on Amazonia through a range of works drawn from history, anthropology, archeology, environmental studies, literature, and the arts. We’ll look at texts by European travelers and missionaries who contributed to the paradoxical image of Amazonia as a “virgin paradise” or a “green hell”; scientific studies and artists’ depictions of the region’s flora and fauna; the often-overlooked history of human occupation of the region; and projects to colonize, develop, or conserve the world’s largest tropical forest. What importance does Amazonia hold for Latin American and global geopolitics? How do art and literature, including indigenous writings, create, reinforce, or deconstruct clichés about the region? What alternative futures for our planet can Amazonia help us to imagine?\n\nDistribution Area: Humanities\n\nAS Foundational Abilities: Culture and Aesthetics (FA3), Citizens and Society (FA4)\n\nThis course will highlight the change from a culture of mass media to social media in the recent media history. As examples of how story telling is affected throughout this paradigm shift, we will be taking into account such phenomena as AI storytelling, Video Vines, and News Feeds. In the age of Mass Media, spanning the rise of TV culture in the 1950s to the end of the 20th century, media had a unifying effect on American culture. With the rise of Cable TV in the 1990s to the ubiquity of internet entertainment sources to the invention of the iPhone and the rise of social media, this cultural unanimity had been shattered. In some ways this has caused a positive effect, as the forms of storytelling have proliferated and diversified, and there is more room for different voices and perspectives today than every before. In other ways the effects have been more insidious, with some critics pointing to social media as one of the main factors in the rise of our post-truth age. The age of social media has also certainly increased a sense of insecurity (FOMO) and attention deficit disorder in the millennials.\n\nDistribution Area: Humanities\n\nAS Foundational Abilities: Culture and Aesthetics (FA3)\n\nWho was Niccolò Machiavelli? We often hear the term “Machiavellian” in reference to actors in business or politics, but what does it really mean? What does Machiavelli teach us about the nature and the dynamics of political power? Can Machiavelli’s thought offer insights into today’s politics and fast-changing world? The course aims to answer these questions by addressing three topics. First, we will study Machiavelli’s life and times, particularly the events connected to his production and the context in which he wrote his main writings. We will see how the fifteenth-century Florentine humanism and the massive political changes affecting early modern Europe shaped Machiavelli’s mindset. Second, we will familiarize ourselves with Machiavelli’s thought by reading The Prince and excerpts from Discourses on Livy. Third, we will get acquainted with some of the main trends in the reception of Machiavelli in the 20th and 21st centuries. Special attention will be paid to interpretations of Machiavelli by Antonio Gramsci, Leo Strauss, Isaiah Berlin, John Greville Agard Pocock, Quentin Skinner, and John P. McCormick. We will also pay attention to modern television programs and films that show the width and depth of Machiavelli's legacy.\n\nDistribution Area: Humanities\n\nAS Foundational Abilities: Culture and Aesthetics (FA3)\n\nTAUGHT IN ENGLISH. Since Plato, inspiration and madness have been understood as closely related, if not identical, terms. For Plato, the experience of beauty awakens a memory in the soul that leads the soul to take flight and to abandon the earth. This understanding of enthusiasm returns in accounts of poetic inspiration in the twentieth-century from Freud’s writing on Leonardo and Karl Jaspers’s study Strindberg and Van Gogh, Swedenborg and Hölderlin (1922) to Blanchot’s Space of Literature (1943) and Deleuze and Guattari’s Anti-Oedipus (1970). In this course we will read theoretical works by Plato, Freud, Binswanger, Jaspers, Blanchot, Deleuze, and Foucault and “inspired” literary writing by Hölderlin, Dickinson, Baudelaire, Melville, Kafka, Walser, Schreber, Artaud, and Borges. To what extent is inspiration mad and how does madness color insight into the phenomenon?\n\nDistribution Area: Humanities\n\nAS Foundational Abilities: Culture and Aesthetics (FA3), Ethics and Foundations (FA5)\n\nThis seminar examines some of the ways we define, represent, and think about the concept of labor in capitalism. We will analyze and compare a wide variety of texts (literary, visual, and theoretical) that embody different, often contradictory, notions of the work we do, why we do it, and how it affects us. As we investigate different types of work—productive and unproductive, physical & intellectual, factory & office—a few of the questions we will ask are: What methods have writers and artists used to depict labor in the 20th and 21st centuries? How is labor stratified along racial and gender lines? Is it possible to imagine a post-work society? The course curates a range of cultural artifacts (short stories, manifestos, novel excerpts, visual art, and film) that employ aesthetic strategies like irony, humor, absurdity, and duration to represent the dynamics of labor in capitalism. Theoretical texts then provide varied conceptual viewpoints from which to compare, contrast, and synthesize our impressions and interpretations of art and literary works. By the end of the semester, we will have traced a trajectory of labor in capitalism from the early 20th century to our own strange and precarious present.\n\nAS Foundational Abilities: Writing and Communication (FA1), Culture and Aesthetics (FA3), Ethics and Foundations (FA5)\n\nWriting Intensive\n\nIf the modern-day Romance languages all evolved from Latin, how and why do they differ in so many important ways? What drives language change in the first place and why should this be the case? We approach these questions not only from a linguistic perspective (analyzing Romance sound systems, vocabulary, morphosyntax, and semantics), but from a cognitive-psychological and a socio-political perspective as well. Recommended Course Background: At least intermediate-level proficiency in a Romance language as assessed by coursework or placement exam; some previous coursework in linguistics is desirable but not necessary.\n\nDistribution Area: Humanities\n\nAS Foundational Abilities: Citizens and Society (FA4), Projects and Methods (FA6)\n\niddish was the language of European Jews for 1000 years. From the 19th century to the present day it has been a language that millions of Americans — Jewish immigrants and their descendants–have spoken, written in, conducted their daily lives in, and created culture in. This course will examine literature, film, newspapers, and more to explore how Jewish immigrants to America shaped their identities—as Jews, as Americans, and as former Europeans. What role did maintaining, adapting, or abandoning a minority language play in the creation of Jewish American identity—cultural, ethnic, or religious? How was this language perceived by the majority culture? How was it used to represent the experiences of other minoritized groups? What processes of linguistic and cultural translation were involved in finding a space for Yiddish in America, in its original or translated into English? The overarching subjects of this course include migration, race, ethnicity, multilingualism, and assimilation. We will analyze literature (novels, poetry, drama); film; comedy; and other media. All texts in English.\n\nAS Foundational Abilities: Culture and Aesthetics (FA3), Ethics and Foundations (FA5)\n\nAs is clear from current events and debates surrounding monuments to the Confederacy, monuments play an outsize role in the public negotiation of history and identity and the creation of communal forms of memory. We will study the traditions of monuments and monumentality around the world – including statues and buildings along with alternative forms of monumentality – from antiquity to the present day. We will examine the ways that monuments have been favored methods for the powerful to signal identity and authorize history. This course will also explore the phenomenon of “counter-monumentality”, whereby monuments are transformed and infused with new meaning. These kinds of monuments can be mediums of expression and commemoration for minority and diaspora communities and other groups outside the economic and political systems that endow and erect traditional public monuments. The first half of the course will examine the theoretical framework of monumentality, with a focus on ancient monuments from the ancient Near East (e.g., Solomon’s temple). More contemporary examples will be explored in the second half of the course through lectures and also field trips. We will view contemporary debates around monuments in America in light of the long history of monuments and in comparison with global examples of monuments and counter-monuments.

Did you know that one of the first Latin American actresses to conquer Hollywood was Brazilian? Did you know that cinema has existed in Brazil since 1895, just six months after the first screening in Paris? This course is an introduction to both the academic study of cinema as a communicative art and to Brazilian film. The films selected focus on the late 1950s to the present and highlight import episodes and challenges in the advancement of Brazilian society as well as its cinematic production. Film aesthetics are analyzed through a number of critical perspectives, including class, race, gender as well as ethnicity, nationalism or national identity, colonialism, social changes, and the politics of representation. In this sense, the films, and documentaries that we will be watching and studying encompass the period from the rise of New Cinema (Cinema Novo) up to films exploring the most recent trends, including movies launched up to 2022.

In this seminar, we will explore the diverse world of insects and other arthropods and analyze their appearance in philosophy, literature, and the sciences. Reading our way from John Donne’s “The Flea” and Robert Hooke’s “Micrographia” to Mandeville’s “The Fable of the Bees,” Uexküll’s biosemiotics, and Kafka’s “Metamorphosis,” we will ask how concepts and stories of insects reflect and shape the ways we imagine our ecological milieus. We will look more closely at how entomological imaginaries evolved over time and pursue lines of inquiry that will shed new light on human interactions with the environment, politics, and cultural diversity.

This theoretical framework will allow us to explore the role of the Other in literature and cinema. Students will become familiar with the historical development of the notion of the “stranger” through reading and analyzing various contemporary works of prose, poetry and cinema from various countries. We will analyze the ways in which these works depict Otherness and will investigate questions regarding their social, political and philosophical framework as well as the literary and cinematographic devices they employ.

In this course we will examine such museums and consider their long history through a comparison of the theory and practice of Jewish museums with other identity museums. We will study the various museological traditions that engage identity, including the collection of art and antiquities, ethnographic exhibitions, history museums, heritage museums, art museums, and other museums of culture. Some of the questions we will ask include: what are museums for and who are they for? how do museums shape identity? and how do the various types of museums relate to one another? Our primary work will be to examine a variety of contemporary examples around the world with visits to local museums including the Jewish Museum of Maryland, the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the National Museum of the American Indian.\n\nDistribution Area: Humanities\n\nAS Foundational Abilities: Culture and Aesthetics (FA3), Citizens and Society (FA4), Democracy (FA4.1)\n\nHow has the Holocaust been represented in literature and film?

Where does the Holocaust fit in to the array of concerns that the visual arts and literature express? And where do art and literature fit in to the commemoration of communal tragedy and the working through of individual trauma entailed by thinking about and representing the Holocaust? These questions will guide our consideration of a range of texts — nonfiction, novels, poetry — in Yiddish, German, English, French and other languages (including works by Primo Levi and Isaac Bashevis Singer), as well as films from French documentaries to Hollywood blockbusters (including films by Alain Resnais, Claude Lanzmann, and Steven Spielberg).

We will study the rich religious and folkloric traditions that these works draw on in order to better understand why Yiddish, German, Hebrew, and English literature from the 19th century to the present and why film from its beginnings are so full of the occult and the supernatural. We will pay special attention to the ways that monsters, spirits, and the like were deployed in modernist literature and film, in order to ask and answer major questions about modernity: what are the social and aesthetic consequences of technology and automation? what aspects of human nature are revealed by new insights into the psyche?

Dissent in the military and protest against war as well as civil activism in the context of the Palestinians-Israeli conflict will serve us to explore the notion of dissent in the face of collective ethos, memory and trauma. The literary, cinematic, theatrical and artistic productions of dissent will stand at the center of our discussion as well as the role of specific genres and media, including satire and comedy, television, popular music, dance and social media. We will ask ourselves questions such as how do cultural productions express dissent? What is the role of cultural productions in civil activism? And what is the connection between specific genre or media and expression of dissent?

We will study how environmental issues are deeply connected with issues of race, class, gender, ethnicity, and the legacies of colonialism. We will pay close attention to the tensions encountered by notions such as environmentalism of the poor and the disparities that arise from a comparative and historical perspective Global South vis-à-vis Global North, and within the North, among the most vulnerable communities. We will consider the generative potential of storytelling and the arts for imagining an alternative socioeconomic and culture paradigm predicated on environmental sustainability and economic and social equity.

This course traces Italian film history from its origins to recent times, highlighting its main genres and trends beyond the icons of neorealist and auteur cinema, including the so-called ‘comedy Italian style,’ spaghetti westerns, horror, mafia-mockery films, feminist filmmaking, and ecocinema. While learning to probe the cinematic frame, and examine composition, camera movements, cinematography, editing, and sound, and interrogating issues of gender, class, and race, we will screen classics such as Bicycle Thieves, La Dolce Vita, and L’Avventura, but also forgotten archival films by pioneer women filmmakers, and works by emergent, independent filmmakers.\n\nDistribution Area: Humanities\n\nAS Foundational Abilities: Writing and Communication (FA1), Culture and Aesthetics (FA3), Citizens and Society (FA4)\n\nWriting Intensive\n\nThat the nations of the world could ever work together seems utopian, but also unavoidable: migration, war, and not least climate change make some form of global coordination increasingly necessary. This course will give historical and philosophical depth to the idea of a cosmopolitan order and world peace by tracing it from its ancient sources through early modernity to today. At the center of the course will be the text that has been credited with founding the tradition of a world federation of nations, Immanuel Kant’s \"Toward Perpetual Peace\" (1795). Confronting recent and current political discourse, literature, and philosophy with Kant’s famous treatise, we will work to gain a new perspective on the idea of a world order. In addition to Kant, readings include Homer, Erasmus, Pico della Mirandola, Rousseau, Jeremy Bentham, Emily Dickinson, Tolstoy, Whitman, Rosa Luxemburg, Gandhi, Hannah Arendt, John Lennon, and Martin Luther King as well as lesser-known authors such as the Abbé de Saint-Pierre, Ellen Key, Odette Thibault, Simone Weil, and Claude Lefort.

True (deep) literacy is the ability to interpret a discursive object in its cultural, historical, conceptual, material or political contexts. With the evolution of digital cultures, literate practices have evolved to incorporate the emerging cultural paradigms born of the encounter of algorithms and computability with social practices embedded in the earlier literate traditions. Indeed, modern computational environments invite a new algorithmic hermeneutics grounded in both literate and technical traditions. Multiple modern novels, online games or mangas engage with the algorithmic, and these will form a counterpoint to the technical and philosophical texts. We will consider works such as: • Leibniz, De l’Horizon de la doctrine humaine• Norbert Wiener, God and Golem, Inc.• Alan Turing, \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" (chapter 11)• Steven Wolfram: Computation and the Future of the Human Condition • Leslie Valiant, Probably, Approximately Correct• Dominique Cardon, À Quoi rêvent les algorithmes?• G.

Significant numbers of these immigrants came to Italy as a result of the country’s limited, though violent colonial history; others arrive because Italy is the closest entry-point to Europe. How have these migratory flows challenged Italian society’s sense of itself? How have they transformed the notion of Italian national identity? In recent years, growing numbers of Afro- and Afro-descendant writers, filmmakers, artists and Black activists are responding through their work to pervasive xenophobia and racism while challenging Italy’s self-representation as a ‘White’ country. How are they forcing it to broaden the idea of ‘Italianess’? How do their counternarratives compel Italy to confront its ignored colonial past? And, in what way have Black youth in Italy embraced the #Blacklivesmatter movement? This multimedia course examines representation of blackness and racialized otherness, whiteness, and national identity through literary, film, and visual archival material in an intersectional framework. Examining Italy’s internal, ‘Southern question,’ retracing Italy’s colonial history, and recognizing the experiences of Italians of immigrant origins and those of immigrants themselves, we’ll explore compelling works by writers and filmmakers such as Igiaba Scego, Gagriella Ghermandi, Maza Megniste, Dagmawi Yimer, and others.\n\nDistribution Area: Humanities\n\nAS Foundational Abilities: Culture and Aesthetics (FA3), Democracy (FA4.1), Ethics and Foundations (FA5)\n\nIn The Great Derangement Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh writes that “the climate crisis is also a crisis of culture, and thus of imagination.” Worldwide, climate and environmental change is stirring the imaginary of novelists, filmmakers, and artists who are finding ways to frame, emplot, or even perform, an unmanageable phenomenon like climate change. How is climate change shaping new modes of storytelling and aesthetics? How do film, literature, and environmentally conscious art transform our perception of the world we inhabit and its unpredictable changes? Can climate change narratives help us to imagine futures of possibilities, maybe dystopian, uncertain, or even happy, but futures nonetheless?

Simultaneously a profound exploration of the power of love and an elaborate experimentation with poetic form, this enigmatic work is also a meditation on translation: of life to text; of prose to verse; of the divine to human, and vice versa. Key passages in the Divine Comedy, in which the poet rewrites Homer, Virgil, the Bible, and himself, will highlight the centrality of translation to the creative process. Questions of originality, appropriation, and revision will be further explored through works by Charles Baudelaire, Robert Penn Warren, Jorge Luis Borges, Louise Gluck, Elizabeth Alexander, Allegra Goodman, and Christine and the Queens, all of whom translate Dante’s new life into something uniquely their own.\n\nDistribution Area: Humanities\n\nAS Foundational Abilities: Writing and Communication (FA1), Culture and Aesthetics (FA3)\n\nItaly, once a land of emigrants, is now a place of arrival for people from Africa, eastern Europe, and beyond.

Readings will include Vita by Melania Mazzucco, Clash of Civilizations Over an Elevator in Piazza Vittorio by Amara Lakhous, and Adua by Igiaba Scego as well as excerpts from works by Luigi Pirandello, Giovanni Pascoli, Carlo Levi, and Mario Soldati. Films range from Visconti’s Rocco and His Brothers to Brusati’s Bread and Chocolate, Crialese’s The Golden Door, Matteo Garrone’s Io, Capitano, and Ferrente’s documentary about the Orchestra di Piazza Vittorio.

This sentiment of fearing, warning and even witnessing the end of the world as we know it, will stand at the center of the course. We will study the literary and cinematic representations of this apocalyptic notion and investigate its theoretical, theological, physiological and aesthetic aspects. We will seek to trace the narrative dynamics as well as literary and cinematic means of apocalyptic representations in works from various periods, languages, cultures and religions. Among the issues to be discussed: what is the apocalypse, biblical apocalypse, dystopia and nostalgia, trauma and post trauma, war and the apocalypse, the Holocaust as the end of civilization, the atomic bomb, realism and anti-realism, political changes and the apocalypse in popular culture.\n\nDistribution Area: Humanities\n\nAS Foundational Abilities: Citizens and Society (FA4), Ethics and Foundations (FA5)\n\nWriting Intensive\n\nThis course is an introduction to the growing field of Translation Studies. Broadly speaking, the translation process involves three major phases: (1) ‘understanding’ what someone else has written; (2) exploring the linguistic/cultural tools available (or not) in another language to convey the original meaning; and (3) taking responsibility for one’s translation choices. What does it mean to ‘understand’ a text? Is it ever possible to find an ‘equivalent’ in another language? Can the translation process ever be objective, and what role, if any, does the translator’s voice play? What practical tools are available to facilitate the translation process? Drawing from interdisciplinary theories and approaches to translation, this course will attempt to reflect on these questions, and provide an opportunity for some hands-on translation practice.

But monumentality is not restricted to statues or buildings. In this course we will study alternative forms of monumentality, especially in the 20th and 21st centuries. These alternative monumentalities — primarily literary, but including various material- and object-based expressions, and elaborations on institutional modes of monumentality — have assumed significance especially in minority and diaspora communities, and for other people and peoples outside the economic and political systems that endow and erect traditional public monuments. The primary case studies in this course will be forms of Holocaust commemoration, including the post-Holocaust large-scale Yiddish literary projects meant to serve Jewish communities in search of new forms of memorialization; and counter-monuments like Germany’s Stolpersteine (stumbling stones). We will also consider contemporary debates around monuments in America and global manifestations of alternative monumentalities.

Our approach will be structured around an interlinking set of elements: historical stages in the development of Lacan’s theory; dimensions of experience as defined by the theory, specifically the symbolic, the imaginary, and the real; and moments of analytic interpretation, namely, the identification of the symptom, the staging of a fundamental fantasy in transference, and traversing the fantasy through subjective destitution. Readings will include texts from Lacan's seminars and writings as well as commentaries by the Slovenian philosophers Slavoj Žižek and Alenka Zupancic, the Haitian analyst Willy Apollon, the Argentine analyst Juan-David Nasio, and others. The seminar is being offered across several programs and will be taught in English, although students who can are encouraged to do readings in the original language. Attendance and participation are mandatory, but a term paper is not required.\n\nDistribution Area: Humanities\n\nI feel, therefore I am: beginning with Diderot’s Letter on the Blind for the Use of Those Who Can See (1749) and Rousseau’s Letter to M. D'Alembert on Spectacles (1758), the seminar will explore connections between various aspects of neurophysiological, bodily perception and their representations in culture. We will then consider the origins of the term Einfühlung in Robert Vischer's and Theodor Lipps’ seminal works. Embodied perception that informs Heinrich Wölfflin's Prolegomena to a Psychology of Architecture (1886) is also the focus of several of Georg Simmel’s essays. We shall discuss the environment as an extension of the self in Charles Baudelaire’s “The Swan” and in Andrzej Leder’s “Psychoanalysis of a Cityscape. A Case of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder: The City of Warsaw.” Aby Warburg’s notion of Pathosformeln will allow us to see the link between pathos and empathy. Finally we will read Zuzanna Ginczanka’s poetry and Clarice Lispector’s The Hour of the Star, whose narrator announces: “I write with my body.\"\n\nDistribution Area: Humanities\n\nThis course proposes a study of the culture of algorithms for students of the literate space. True (deep) literacy is the ability to interpret a text or an object in its cultural, historical, conceptual, material or political contexts. With the evolution of digital cultures, literate practices have changed to incorporate the emerging cultural paradigms born out of the encounter of algorithms and computability with social practices embedded in the earlier literate traditions. Indeed, modern computation environments invite a new algorithmic hermeneutics grounded in both literate and scientific traditions. We will consider, among others, texts such as Bernard Chazelle’s inaugural lesson at the Collège de France, “L’algorithmique et les sciences”; Leibniz on ordered problem solving; Condorcet on “social arithmetic”; Norbert Wiener, God and Golem, Inc.; Herbert Simon, “Bounded Rationality…”; Alan Turing, \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\"; Steven Wolfram: Computation and the Future of the Human Condition; Leslie Valiant, Probably, Approximately Correct; Ed Finn, What Algorithms Want. Imagination in the Age of Computing; Daniel Cardon, À Quoi rêvent les algorithmes?; and of course Donald Knuth’s classics, Literate Programming and “Computing Science and its Relation to Mathematics”. Various modern novels also attempt to engage with the algorithmic, and these can form a counterpoint to the more technical or philosophical texts. For more information and a provisional syllabus, please go to http://www.wilda.org/Courses/CourseVault/Grad/Algorithms/Syllabus.html.This course will be taught in English. A few (short) texts are in French, so the ability to read French will be useful although not required.\n\nDistribution Area: Humanities\n\nMedia Artist in Residence Jane Jin Kaisen is a team-taught class between Bernadette Wegenstein (MLL) and Clara Han (Anthropology). In this class we will prepare the artist residency of Jane Jin Kaisen, a visual artist born in Jeju Island, South Korea and raised in Denmark. In the first part of the semester, we will cover theoretical questions raised in Jane Jin Kaisen’s work such as cross-cultural adoption, diaspora, migration, war, gender and sexuality, and translation. In the second part we will involve students practically in questions of media arts curation for the artist’s exhibit planned for April 2-9, 2022, at the Parkway Theatre, featuring three of her recent and acclaimed installations and films: The Woman, the Orphan, and the Tiger (2010), Apertures/ Rifts (2016), and Community of Parting (2019. In this class students will be closely involved with JHU's Center for Advanced Media Studies (CAMS), and the Baltimore Stavros Niarchos Parkway Theatre’s artistic director Christy LeMaster. They will also meet the artist Jane Jin Kaisen during her residency.\n\nReadings and discussion of texts of various genres (poetry, short story, novel, theatre) covering the time period from the Middle Ages to the present day. The course will expose students to core principles of literary understanding and analysis; the texts themselves are drawn from socio-cultural and historical frameworks that cross the French-speaking world. The two semesters (212.333 and 212.334) may be taken in either order. Students may co-register with an upper level course during this course. 212.333 covers the time period from the Middle Ages to the Revolution.

We will explore this question by examining the concept of immunity, not only as a medical and legal concept, but also as a cultural phenomenon. Students will analyze what “immunity” can teach us about the ideas of tolerance and defense and about the ways we come into contact and build relationships with others. Through attention to French novels and graphic novels, students will investigate the grammars and images linked to the concept of immunity and research how these languages and images shape how we think of mental and physical illnesses, vulnerability, exposure, as well as how they permeate body representations in French literature. Secondary sources such as philosophical texts, movies, and photographs will embed these narratives into larger issues within the history of medicine and postwar French literature.\n\nDistribution Area: Humanities\n\nAS Foundational Abilities: Culture and Aesthetics (FA3)\n\nStudents will explore contemporary French society and culture through a wide variety of media: fiction and non-fiction readings (graphic novels, news periodicals, popular magazines), films, music, art, websites, and podcasts. A diverse range of hands-on activities in addition to guided readings will help students develop cultural awareness as we discuss topics such as education, politics, humor, sports, cuisine, immigration, slang, and national identity, as well as the historical factors that have influenced these facets of French and francophone culture.

Although many of his American contemporaries dismissed him as a crude writer, he gained a more reverential status on the other side of the Atlantic throughout the 19th century, being introduced by Baudelaire as one of the first \"poète maudit\" of the century. Through Baudelaire's translations, Poe's writings gained recognition and his literary sensibility was widely praised. He influenced several major literary and artistic movements amongst them the Symbolist poetry of Stéphane Mallarmé and Paul Valéry, the paintings of Edouard Manet and Paul Gauguin, but also the Fantastic in Maupassant's short stories and in Villiers de l'Isle-Adam writings. Moreover, Poe's influence is to be seen in the works of Jules Verne, the father of French science-fiction who admired Poe, in French Romanticism and in the detective stories of Emile Gaboriau. Through the prism of Poe's influence on French writers, this course allows a stimulating odyssey into various French works. Course taught in French.\n\nDistribution Area: Humanities\n\nAS Foundational Abilities: Culture and Aesthetics (FA3)\n\nAlexandre Dumas’s Le Comte de Monte Cristo (1844-46) is widely regarded as one of the most popular novels of all time and as one of the best adventure novels ever written. Perhaps no other masterpiece of French literature has been subjected around the world to such countless film adaptations, including animation, television series, and serials. This course aims to study and contextualize the reasons behind this sustained transnational and transcultural interest. Close reading and analysis of Dumas' novel will provide a good point of departure to explore problems that cut across nineteenth-century French society: politics, social class, revolution, family, love and desire, revenge, justice, science, and religion. Course conducted in French; most films in English or with English subtitles.\n\nDistribution Area: Humanities\n\nAS Foundational Abilities: Culture and Aesthetics (FA3)\n\nThis course will examine the various ways voodoo, as the Unknown, has been represented, misrepresented, recuperated, and interpreted in the aftermath of the Haitian Revolution from the early nineteenth century to the present day. While historians have debunked the role of voodoo in the aftermath of the Haitian Revolution, the literary representation of the slaves in captivity is often associated with the will to liberation enacted in the secret practice of voodoo on the plantation. The history of voodoo in Saint-Domingue (Haiti) is intertwined with the history of colonial subversion, ancestral medicine, and the physical resistance of the enslaved people. Yet the most defining event in the armed uprising by the enslaved, the ceremony of Bois Caiman (August 14, 1791) still divides historians, novelists, and anthropologists. Where history and anthropology seem to flounder in trying to capture the mystery of such ceremony, literature soars majestically, maintaining the mystery by using the freedom of the imagination as its sole support. Might the transmission of voodoo during the colonial period, be understood as the historical mode of preservation of an ancestral secret practice that can only be transmitted through oral tradition and rituals, which may have been lost in the attempt to produce written translations ? Readings in French and English may include works by Alejo Carpentier, Aimé Césaire, Patrick Chamoiseau, Marie Chauvet, Edwidge Danticat, René Depestre, Zora Neale Hurston, Frédéric Marcelin, Alfred Métraux, Toni Morisson, Jacques Roumain, Simone Schwarz-Bart, William Seabrook, Derek Walcott, Richard Wright, to be supplemented by films, an art exhibit, music, and cultural demonstrations of voodoo.

It is often understood to stand in opposition to the royal court and embodies the spirit of the people in a way related to the modern notion of “solidarity”. This course will look at a number of examples of the peculiar status of the French city (especially Paris) from the late Renaissance through the First Empire. Selections from Marguerite de Valois, Mme de Sévigné, Montesquieu, Diderot, Rousseau, Turgot, Ruault, Rétif de la Bretonne, Mercier, Saint-Just, Robespierre, Napoléon Bonaparte, with a coda from Balzac and Michelet.

What is strange? Who is a stranger? While close readings of texts and films will seek above all to shed light on the complex meanings of the two themes of l’étrange et l’étranger (strange/stranger, foreign/foreigner) as they have appeared in literature, philosophy, historiography, and the other arts, we will at the same time highlight the artistic, historical, and intellectual issues related to the opposing figures (i.e. Citizen, Friend, Slave, Native) as they are represented in the major literary movements of this long period, notably romanticism, realism, symbolism, naturalism, surrealism, and existentialism. Conducted entirely in French.\n\nAS Foundational Abilities: Culture and Aesthetics (FA3)\n\nAcross the 20th century, mainstream and avant-garde French culture was deeply impacted by the presence of African American musicians and performing artists hailing from the jazz tradition. From the Josephine Baker craze of the 1920s to the second post-war which welcomed the innovations of bebop and sixties-era free improvisation, metropolitan France proved a space where expatriate and exiled Black Americans could both perpetuate the tradition and innovate by turns. At the same time, French tastemakers, critics, and musicians eager to adopt new forms and styles debated the extent to which American jazz music in its various strains could be “made French.” This course in transcultural French studies will feature readings in music criticism, history, and literature, as well as frequent close listening. It will culminate in a local concert reflecting France’s continued connection to and support of jazz and related improvised musics.

What does it mean to protect your society from such diseases? This was a fraught, even violently debated political, social and moral, more than a medical question in the French Enlightenment, and it marked the literate culture of the Age of Enlightenment. Early on, pandemics and vaccination were understood in radically different ways in England (especially by the Princess of Wales) and in France, still dominated by a view of plagues as divine punishment. In Enlightenment literature, both fiction and nonfiction, the disease is secondary to the experience of the conscious sufferer, or to its sociopolitical consequences. We will approach these issues first via a quick overview of explanations of the plague, then discuss the 18th-century smallpox vaccination debates (one of Princess Caroline’s letters, Voltaire on vaccination in two of his Lettres anglaises, extracts of Rousseau’s novel La Nouvelle Héloïse). We will then consider the hugely influential mid-century debate space within the magisterial Encyclopédie of Diderot and d’Alembert. Finally, we will pass to late-18th-century texts that inflect culturally, politically and socially the consequences and metaphors of pandemics on the cusp of the Revolution. Texts to be read include Laclos’ Liaisons dangereuses and a short essay by Guillotin (the inventor of the guillotine) on the citizen’s experience of illness and contagion in a post-aristocratic, Revolutionary state. This will be a writing-intensive course, focused on close readings of texts in 2 explications de texte (written close analyses of a selected passage). The second paper may be a more extensive study, still based on textual analysis, but which may address a historical context or set of texts that particularly interest the student.

The literature of the nineteenth century was marked by major literary battles opposing young Romantic writers against an old school of Academicians. This battle was fought largely in and through the theatre. In this course the classroom space itself becomes a stage in which to reenact or rehearse some of these battles, through careful readings of texts and by exploring all possible literary contexts. Participants will read together a number of plays as well as take part in collaborative learning and creative activities. Readings to include texts by Césaire, Dumas, Hugo, Marivaux, Musset, Scribe, Sartre, and Vigny.

But he also attempted to use his understanding of the then-new sciences of biology and thermodynamics to re-theorize the cultural and epistemological consequences of literature in general. Starting from his famous text “le roman expérimental,” this course will call on Zola’s polemical and literary corpus to examine the effects of scientific thought on literature. We will consider what led this fundamental author of the late 19th century to undertake such a project and to invent “le Naturalisme”, the widespread movement that had followers in multiple world literatures of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This course is open to undergraduates and graduate students. This course is writing intensive and will be taught in French.

What does that mean? Is the French novel intrinsically romantic? Our discussion could well start with Girard’s Vérité romanesque et mensonge romantique, which presents a new conception of the novel in correlation with human philosophy, and concludes that the “roman romanesque” is not “romantique,” because romanesque adhered to the truthfulness of its subject while the romantic scenario is linked to its deceit. However, the real theoretical focal point is not the position of contemporary critics on romantic and non-romantic narrative scenarios, but the following characterization from 1903 of the “roman romanesque” by Academician Émile Faguet (1847-1916): “Ce n'est point du tout le roman à aventures extraordinaires et tumultueuses. Celui-là, je l'appellerais plutôt le roman mélodramatique. J'entends par roman romanesque celui qui, très délibérément, s'attache à nous présenter des caractères exceptionnels qui ne cessent pas d'être vrais.” The course will introduce the socio-cultural complexity of novelistic forms and techniques of the literary movement familiarly known among the critics as “le romanesque français” from the Restoration to the early Third Republic. Readings by Balzac, Constant, Dumas, Flaubert, Hugo, Sand, Staël, and Stendhal. Taught in French.\n\nIn this seminar in the poetics of cultural forms, we will examine the half-century period in France (1895-1945) during which narrative film language evolved out of proto-cinema to coalesce in the multi-reel feature and the serial, then, after a brief but fecund period of experimentation in non-narrative creative modes (dada, Surrealism, Epstein’s “cinepoetry”), weathered the transition to the “talkies” (le parlant) to diverse effect. That transition to sound yielded both masterworks of poetic realism (Renoir, Duvivier) and countless literary adaptations that sought, and won, broad commercial success (Pagnol, Guitry). Rather than prejudge the esthetic and ideological interest of those works of the 1930s which film historians tend to associate with France’s cinematic maturity, we will attend to the fissures through which the seventh art continues to disclose nostalgia for its (not so) silent past, and to the conservatism that the sound feature imposed on filmic expression. Conversely, looking backwards, we will pay heed to the ways silent film in the 1910s and 1920s itself superseded, through targeted appeals to the sensorial imaginary, its medium-specific limits. Taught in English; readings in English and French (reading knowledge strongly recommended).\n\nDistribution Area: Humanities\n\nCharles Baudelaire (1821-1867) and Gustave Flaubert (1821-1880): two young men from wealthy families, two opponents of bourgeois education, two aborted social callings, two terminal illnesses, two resounding failures before literary institutions, two adventures in love, two satanic fascinations, two notorious literary trials, two conceptions of the craft of writing, two approaches to realism, two criticisms of romantic art, two models of poetic inspiration, two aesthetics of language, two cults of Beauty, all for one and a unique literature. This seminar will be devoted to the literary life of two writers whose canon for more than a century has occupied a central place of importance in contemporary literary criticism. It will be our task to place their work in perspective within the context of the rise of modernism, which is to say, the new status of literature as of the year 1857. We shall endeavor, thus, to discern the authenticity of the creative relationship of each artist with himself and subsequently with others. The point will be to foreground three fundamental principles that will aid in grasping the evolution of the literary world under the Second Empire and under the Third Republic: literary history, writing and the elevation of the writer (Bénichou). Our work will be based on three or four texts by Baudelaire and Flaubert, it being understood that additional works of criticism will illuminate the discussion of these texts.\n\nWriting Intensive\n\nThis course is a writing workshop for graduate students of literature and literate cultures.
