        "text": "Isabella Whitney published two poetic miscellanies of secular poems: The Copy of a Letter (1567) and A Sweet Nosegay (1573), each of which includes her own work and a total of six poems by five different male authors across both publications. The present edition of her writings prints modernized texts of the complete miscellanies and also six poems attributed to Whitney by largely twentieth-century critics.\n\nMore Info\n\nIn 1649, a seamstress named Elizabeth Poole appeared at the Whitehall debates in London to prophesy before Parliament’s army shortly after it had defeated the crown in the English civil wars. Invited to help deliberate the fate of Charles I, Poole advised the army to spare the king’s life but to put him on trial for tyranny and to enter into a new compact with the people.\n\nMore Info\n\nMargaret More Roper (1505–1544) was, at the age of nineteen, the first early modern woman writer in Tudor England and the first nonroyal woman to have a book printed in the English language. This Other Voice edition recognizes her, the eldest daughter and confidante of Sir Thomas More, as a notable historical figure in her own right and as one of the most learned women of her time.\n\nMore Info\n\nThe Sprites of Kernosy Castle exemplifies the novel of leisure, a type of fiction that became popular in the late seventeenth century, reflecting both increased interest in the private lives of the aristocracy and a pre-Enlightenment questioning of political and religious orthodoxies. Murat combines humor, social satire, and a proto-feminist outlook in a well-constructed plot where the supernatural is debunked.\n\nMore Info\n\nThis edition presents poetry by William Herbert, Third Earl of Pembroke, a pivotal figure in the literary and political cultures of Stuart England, who wrote poetry primarily for social occasions: a debate with a friend, seductions or apologies to beloveds, and support for a deceased political ally. A hefty apparatus explores the networks in which the poems circulated, the interpretive contexts suggested in miscellanies, and alternative readings revealed through scribal variants.\n\nMore Info\n\nPompeo Colonna’s In Defense of Women (1529/1530), presented in this volume in its Latin edition and English translation, is one of several important defenses of women composed in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries by male advocates of women’s moral and intellectual worth. Known as a cardinal and a warrior but also as an active participant in sixteenth-century Italian literary circles, the author addresses the work to his cousin Vittoria >Colonna, the most renowned Italian woman poet of the era, who, he writes, had urged him to undertake it.\n\nMore Info\n\nThe essays in this volume focus on teaching at the intersection of early modern literature, book history, and digital media. Contributors from a range of fields — history, literature, general education — showcase how digital scholarship, whether in the classroom or through pedagogical collaboration, can support social knowledge construction and critical thinking. Essays reflect on building projects for and with learners; evaluating the many purposes of digital remediation; and engaging students in public-facing scholarship. This volume provides a snapshot of current thinking on digital pedagogy in early modern studies and offers a series of models that may be adapted, personalized and repurposed by future teachers.\n\nMore Info\n\nThe present volume is the first printed edition of Polwhele’s first play, The Faithful Virgins, until now extant only in an unsigned manuscript in the Bodleian Library at Oxford University. A tragicomedy apparently performed in London by the Duke’s Company ca. 1669–1671,The Faithful Virgins is altogether different in tone from Polwhele’s later prose comedy, The Frolicks; or, The Lawyer Cheated (1671), first printed by Cornell University Press in 1977.\n\nMore Info\n\nLady Mary Carey examined her life and expressed her views in a handwritten manuscript created for self-reflection and restricted audiences of family and friends, rather than for print publication. Her poetry and prose, composed and revised between 1650 and 1658, were important enough to her inner circle that her autograph manuscript was copied in a fair hand in 1681.\n\nMore Info\n\nCamilla Battista da Varano (1458–1524) was a Franciscan nun and the author of profound spiritual writings in both prose and verse. Raised in the princely household of Camerino in north-central Italy, she put her thorough humanist education to use explaining her own spiritual experience and delivering advice to others.\n\nMore Info\n\nThe treatise on the art of childbirth by Marie Baudoin (1625–1700), head midwife and governor of the Hôtel-Dieu, Clermont-Ferrand, sent to her powerful Parisian patron, Dr. Vallant, illuminates the knowledge-making practices of a provincial midwife. The story of how her voice came to be expressed, recorded, and archived begs the question: was she exceptional because she was herself extraordinary, or because her voice has reached us through Vallant’s careful archival thinking and practices?\n\nMore Info\n\nWinner, Society for the Study of Early Modern Women and Gender's 2023 Edition Award (Scholarly Edition category - Josephine Roberts Award)\n\nThe seven pamphlets in this edition focus on Mary Carleton’s bigamy trial, a trial in which the accused eloquently defends herself and is ultimately acquitted. Written in the early years of the English Restoration, they demonstrate that narratives presenting what “she said” and what ”he said” can reveal, forcefully and painfully, how truth can be fragmented in the different arenas of law, love, and politics.\n\nMore Info\n\nThis first print edition of two extant manuscripts by Dorothy Calthorpe (1648–1693) introduces a new seventeenth-century woman writer to the growing canon of early modern female authors. The edition provides transcriptions of the manuscripts and Calthorpe’s will, as well as a hefty apparatus that features a comprehensive introduction to Calthorpe, her family, and her work; a Glossary of Persons who figured in her writing and her life; and two genealogical charts.\n\nMore Info\n\nWinner of the 2022 Society for the Study of Early Modern Women and Gender's Award for a Scholarly Edition in Translation\n\nFeminae: Medieval Women and Gender Index Translation of the Month, December 2022\n\nSaint Colette of Corbie was a great French reformer of the Franciscan Order and the founder of seventeen convents. Though of humble origin, she attracted the support of pow-erful patrons and important Church officials.\n\nMore Info\n\nMarie-Catherine Le Jumel de Barneville, baronne d’Aulnoy (1652–1705) was the first Frenchwoman to write, publicize, and publish, in 1691, the account of her travels into Spain as an independent woman. Considered the authority on things Spanish for nearly two centuries, until positivist historiographers labelled it fake, her Travels can now be appreciated for her ironic female gaze on realities concealed from male travelers and her unabashedly female and often playful voice.\n\nMore Info\n\nThe actress and author Isabella Andreini won international renown playing the bold, versatile, and intellectual innamorata of the commedia dell’arte. After her death, her husband Francesco Andreini continued publishing her works, among them the thirty-one amorosi contrasti, or debates, presented in this volume, which enable readers to envision the commedia dell’arte through the words of its most revered diva.\n\nMore Info\n\nFeminae: Medieval Women and Gender Index Translation of the Month, July 2023\n\nAround 1460, Michele Savonarola produced the extraordinary Mother’s Manual for the Women of Ferrara. This gynecological, obstetrical, and pediatric treatise is the first of its kind written in a European vernacular, so that it could be potentially read not only by the learned, who communicated in Latin, but also by pregnant and nursing mothers and the midwives and wet nurses who presided over childbirth.\n\nMore Info\n\nVittoria Colonna was the most celebrated woman writer of the Italian Renaissance. The selection of Colonna’s letters presented here for the first time in a translated edition, written to and from writers, artists, popes, cardinals, employees, and family members, place Colonna at the center of intersecting epistolary networks as a political actor, a theological thinker, a literary practitioner, and a caring friend.\n\nMore Info\n\nBorn in the early 1620s to parents of Scottish descent who were servants in Charles I’s household, Anne, Lady Halkett (née Murray), grew up on fringes of the English court during a period of increasing political tension. From 1644 to 1699, Halkett recorded her personal and political experiences in both England and Scotland in a series of manuscript meditations and an autobiographical narrative (A True Account of My Life).\n\nMore Info\n\nFeminae: Medieval Women and Gender Index Translation of the Month, October 2022\n\nChristine de Pizan’s Body Politic (1406–1407) is the first political treatise to have been written by a woman. It still resounds today, urging the need for probity in public life and the importance of responsibilities as well as rights.\n\nMore Info\n\nFollowing on from The Aesop Episode, this episode sees the poetess Anna Stanisławska (1651–1701) recounting what was a hoped-for felicitous future. However, this is an age of tears and personal calamities; and war, broken faith, and Stanisławska’s resolve to maintain agency over her life will ultimately lead to marital conflict.\n\nMore Info\n\nWinner of the 2021 Society for the Study of Early Modern Women and Gender's Award for a Scholarly Edition in Translation\n\nAnna Maria van Schurman was widely regarded as the most erudite woman in seventeenth-century Europe. This volume presents in translation a remarkable collection of her letters and poems—many of which were previously unpublished—that span almost four decades of her life, from 1631 to 1669.\n\nMore Info\n\nFeminae: Medieval Women and Gender Index Translation of the Month, February 2022\n\nThe God of Love’s Letter (1399), Christine de Pizan’s first defense of women, is arguably her most succinct statement about gender. The Tale of the Rose (1402) responds to the growth in chivalric orders for the defense of women by arguing that women, not men, should choose members of the “Order of the Rose.”\n\nMore Info\n\nHonorable Mention, 2021 Society for the Study of Early Modern Women and Gender's Award for a Scholarly Edition in Translation\n\nIn her Letters on Natural Philosophy, published originally in Krakow in 1584, Camilla Erculiani proposed her new theory of the natural causes of the universal flood in the biblical book of Genesis.\n\nMore Info\n\nWinner of the Society for the Study of Early Modern Women and Gender's 2022 Josephine Roberts Award for a Scholarly Edition\n\nThis volume provides a collection of Anne Vaughan Lock’s works presented in modern spelling, and it includes additional contemporary materials that place her voice in the larger context of the Tudor period, offering insight into the intertwined complexities of political, social, and religious life in sixteenth-century England.\n\nMore Info\n\nWinner of the 2020 Society for the Study of Early Modern Women and Gender's Award for a Scholarly Edition in Translation\n\nGabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve, the little-known author of Beauty and the Beast, was a successful novelist and fairytale writer in mid eighteenth-century France.\n\nMore Info\n\nWinner of the 2020 Society for the Study of Early Modern Women and Gender's Josephine Roberts Award for a Scholarly Edition\n\nEleonora Fonseca Pimentel was a poet, a political writer, a journalist, and a politician. She was the editor, and virtually the only writer of the Monitore Napoletano (Neapolitan Monitor), the journal in which she recorded the events and debates that took place in the short-lived Neapolitan Jacobin Republic of 1799.\n\nMore Info\n\nWinner of the Society for the Study of Early Modern Women and Gender's Prize for Best Teaching Edition of a Work on Women and Gender Published in 2018\n\nThis volume presents three plays by women that were written in specific household contexts and survive in distinctive handwritten copies dating from their authors’ lifetimes.\n\nMore Info\n\nWinner of the Society for the Study of Early Modern Women and Gender's Josephine Roberts Award for the Best Scholarly Edition on Women and Gender in 2018\n\nMargaret Cavendish offers views on physics, chemistry, algebraic geometry, medicine, political philosophy, ethics, psychology, and animal intelligence, as she develops her own theory of vital matter within the scope of nature’s ordering principles.\n\nMore Info\n\nHonorable Mention - Society for the Study of Early Modern Women and Gender's Prize for Best Translated Edition of a Work on Women and Gender Published in 2018\n\nThis translation makes The Buffoons, the first female-authored comedy printed in Italy, available to Anglophone readers for the first time. Published in 1641, this burlesque play depicts the mismatched sexual desires of a prince and princess.\n\nMore Info\n\nIsabella Andreini was the most famous actress of the Italian Renaissance. She was also a playwright; in fact, the first woman to publish a pastoral. This modern edition and translation subtly captures the novelty, as well as the imaginative pyrotechnics, of a brilliant, self-made virtuosa of the stage.\n\nMore Info\n\nFeminae: Medieval Women and Gender Index Translation of the Month, September 2017\n\nOthea’s Letter to Hector, one of Christine de Pizan’s most popular works, is at the same time one of her most complex creations. Combining a somewhat Sibylline verse text based on a mythological figure with extensive citation of pagan sapiential authorities, the Bible, and the Church Fathers, it showcases Christine’s extraordinary learning and her innovative approach to didacticism.\n\nMore Info\n\nWinner of the Society for the Study of Early Modern Women's 2018 Josephine Roberts Award for a Scholarly Edition published in 2017\n\nDiverse Observations is a groundbreaking book available for the first time in English. Written by a midwife committed to improving the care of women and newborns, it records the evolution of Bourgeois’s practice and beliefs, comments on changing attitudes related to reproductive health, and critiques the gendered elitism of the early modern medical hierarchy.\n\nMore Info\n\nFeminae: Medieval Women and Gender Index Translation of the Month, November 2016\n\nThis volume presents in translation 100 previously unknown letters of Ippolita Maria Sforza (1445–1488), daughter of the Duke of Milan, who was sent at age twenty to marry the son of the infamously brutal King Ferrante of Naples. Sforza’s letters display the adroit diplomacy she used to strengthen the alliance between Milan and Naples, then the two most powerful states in Italy.\n\nMore Info\n\nWinner of the Society for the Study of Early Modern Women's 2018 Scholarly Edition in Translation Award for a work published in 2017\n\nIsabella d’Este (1474–1539), daughter of the Este dukes of Ferrara and wife of Marchese Francesco II Gonzaga of Mantua, co-regent of the Gonzaga state, art collector, musician, diplomat, dynastic mother, traveler, reader, gardener, fashion innovator, and consummate politician, was also, as this volume attests, a prolific letter writer with a highly developed epistolary network.\n\nMore Info\n\nThe texts available here in English for the first time open a window into the lives of three early modern Frenchwomen as they explore the common themes of family, memory, sin, and salvation: the Regrets of Marguerite d’Auge (1600), the Memoirs of Renée Burlamacchi (1623), and the Genealogy of Jeanne du Laurens (1631), are taken from different genres of historical writings.\n\nMore Info\n\nFeminae: Medieval Women and Gender Index Translation of the Month, May 2016\n\nChristine de Pizan (ca. 1364–ca. 1431) has long been recognized as France’s first professional woman of letters, and interest in her voluminous and wide-ranging corpus has been steadily rising for decades. In The Mutability of Fortune, Christine fuses world history with autobiography to demonstrate mankind’s subjugation to the ceaselessly changing, and often cruel, whims of Fortune.\n\nMore Info\n\nIn 1654, Anna Trapnel — a Baptist, Fifth Monarchist, millenarian, and visionary from London — fell into a trance during which she prophesied passionately and at length against Oliver Cromwell and his government. Her Report and Plea offers fascinating insight into the life and times of an early modern woman claiming her place at the center of the tumultuous political events of mid-seventeenth-century England.\n\nMore Info\n\nWinner of the Society for the Study of Early Modern Women's 2017 Josephine Roberts Award for a Scholarly Edition published in 2016\n\nThis volume presents ten plays by three leading women playwrights of Spain’s Golden Age. Included are four bawdy and outrageous comic interludes; a full-length comedy involving sorcery, chivalry, and dramatic stage effects; and five short religious plays satirizing daily life in the convent.\n\nMore Info\n\nThese translations from the French bring two of Claudine-Alexandrine de Tencin’s novels back to life: The Memoirs of the Count of Comminge (1735), and The Misfortunes of Love (1747). Like the work of Abbé Prévost and Pierre de Marivaux, they were important contributions to the early sentimental novel. They also anticipated the gothic novels of Ann Radcliffe which appeared later in the century.\n\nMore Info\n\nHonorable Mention, Society for the Study of Early Modern Women's 2017 Scholarly Edition in Translation Award for a work published in 2016\n\nJuana de la Cruz (1481–1534) is a unique figure in the history of the Catholic Church, thanks to her public visionary experiences.

Mary More argues that women have the right to an education, and that such an education shows that the inequality of married women under English law is a man-made institution.\n\nMore Info\n\nThis edition presents in English, for the first time, Jeanne d’Albret’s Letters, together with her Ample Declaration (1568) defending her decampment to the Protestant stronghold of La Rochelle. A historical-biographical introduction situates these writings in the larger context of Reformation politics and examines in detail the specific literary characteristics of her memoir.\n\nMore Info\n\nHonorable Mention, Society for the Study of Early Modern Women's 2016 Scholarly Edition in Translation Award for a work published in 2015\n\nFeminae: Medieval Women and Gender Index Translation of the Month, March 2015\n\nIn 1415, Francesco Barbaro produced a marriage manual intended at once for his friend, a scion of the Florentine Medici family, and for the young nobility of Venice.

Kayden Translation Award\n\nA sixteenth-century bestseller, The Pleasant Nights is today a fundamental text for European folk and fairy tale studies, for alongside triumphal and tragic love stories, comical tales of practical jokes, and accounts of witty retorts, Straparola (1480?–1557?) placed some of the first fairy tales printed in Europe. This book presents the first new and complete English translation of Straparola’s tales and riddles to be published since the nineteenth century.\n\nMore Info\n\nIn 1635, Margaret Van Noort, a lay sister of the royal convent of Discalced Carmelite nuns in Brussels, composed her spiritual autobiography. This text was followed by two diaries in 1636 and 1637.

Despite this open and fruitful dialogue, women were still idealized according to a strict model of female virtue based on a culture of honour and chastity that was reflected in the arts as well as in law and daily life. The volume analyses this process of idealization, the rhetorical, philosophical, or historical tools used, and how this vision differed from theory and practice.\n\nMore Info\n\nService permeated premodern Europe and was a key concept for defining relationships.
