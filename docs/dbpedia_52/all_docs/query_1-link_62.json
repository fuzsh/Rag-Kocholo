        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn 1830, the newly-established Société d’Horticulture de Paris announced in its journal that a local nurseryman, Jean-Louis Adam (1777–1830), had produced a new variety of cytisus. The tree, given the name Cytisus adami at the time but commonly referred to in Britain as Adam’s laburnum, produced both yellow and purple flowers. No cytisus being cultivated at the time had such striking properties. But perhaps more remarkable than the tree itself was Jean-Louis Adam’s testimony that he had not produced the tree by cross-pollination. He claimed instead that it was the product of a graft (Prevost and Poiteau 1830, 96). To the reading public of the Annales de la Société d’Horticulture de Paris, the claim had significant consequences: the editors of the Annales were suggesting that it was possible to produce plants then speculatively referred to as ‘graft hybrids’, a variety or even new species that was produced by the intermingling of the plant tissues of the root and the scion in a graft (Prevost and Poiteau 1830, 95). Graft hybrids represented a potential control over nature that held significant commercial promise, and they were also a much sought-after potential source of evidence in debates over the mechanisms of heredity. Adam’s laburnum was destined for commercial and scientific fame.\n\nBut while the tree became widely cultivated throughout Europe, and Adam’s testimony frequently repeated and defended in gardening and horticultural publications, few seemed to really believe Adam’s version of events.1 Even at the close of the 19th century, significant doubt remained attached to Adam’s testimony. On December 27th 1888, George John Romanes wrote to William Thistleton-Dyer, the assistant director at Kew Gardens, requesting help with an experiment.2 Romanes explained in a postscript:\n\nI forgot to ask you if there would be any facilities in spring at Kew for repeating Adam’s graft of purple on yellow laburnum. I want to try this experiment in budding on a large scale because of its importance on Weismannism, should the result of any of the grafts go to corroborate Adam’s account of the way in which he produced the hybrid (Romanes 1896, 213).\n\nRomanes’ idea for a ‘large scale experiment’ was far from new. New varieties could be propagated by grafting, but examples of new varieties that resulted from the act of grafting were very rare, the only historical example known in the 19th century being the ‘Bizarria’ orange (discussed below). The goal of Romanes and his predecessors was the same: to test the claims of the nurseryman Adam and his remarkable graft hybrid. Disagreement existed over the details of its creation. Adam had maintained in an interview that the tree was produced by a graft, and was not a sexually produced hybrid (Prevost and Poiteau 1830, 95–96). During the 19th century, the possibility of producing hybrids by grafting was hotly contested, and Adam’s testimony was one of the few sources of potential evidence in support of the idea. But as the botanist Robert Caspary declared in 1866, few people had ever believed Adam’s testimony (Caspary 1866, 849). This is surprising because, while effectively unknown to the scientific elite, Adam’s nursery was situated in Paris. Parisian nurserymen and seed companies wielded very strong authority within commercial, botanical, and horticultural spheres (Easterby-Smith 2015, 184). Seed companies like the family-owned Vilmorin Company worked to improve cultivated varieties, and the published methods tested and employed in commercial pursuits were read by Darwin and Galton (1998, 248). Nurserymen retained most of the authority on the practice of grafting, and it was common for authorities placed in eminent positions within French and British scientific networks to appeal to the authority of nurserymen and gardeners who were otherwise unknown. Well into the first decades of the 19th century, grafting was still given “the status of a liberal art as well as that of an empirical science” (Pacini 2010, 5). But Adam had institutional backing (of a kind) as well: his testimony concerning the tree was personally documented and published by the botanist Pierre-Antoine Poiteau (1766–1854), the head gardener of Fontainebleau and the editor of Revue Horticole (Oghina-Pavic 2015, 38). Gauging from contemporary reports, the tree became popular within nurseries throughout Europe, owing to its unusual characteristics (Caspary 1866, 849; Poiteau 1838, 6). Many who took an interest in Adam’s testimony were able to find a specimen to cultivate for themselves. So why was Adam doubted for most of the 19th century? Why was there a perpetual need for more proof, when most authorities who took an interest in the tree were happy to concede Adam’s honesty and professional status? Why did it remain what Darwin called ‘a strange puzzle’, despite its pedigree and explanation?3\n\nAdam was a nurseryman in Paris; this brought with it a good deal of practical authority and at the same time suspicion of his abilities. Nurserymen and seed companies were integral to the identification of varieties and species that they sold; but so too were they the point at which many species and varieties were misidentified (Dewis 2014, 119). Was Adam a skilled practitioner who had relied upon his expert eye to spot the unusual branch, or had he made a more fundamental mistake in identifying his own stock? At the time that Adam first produced the laburnum and gave his testimony, the Société d’Horticulture de Paris had been established and had launched its own Annales. Although Adam was not a member of the Société, nurserymen were highly influential, contributing to new periodicals like the Annales. In France and in Britain, gardening and horticulture periodicals were creating new knowledge communities of readers and contributors. Within this new court of anonymous readers and contributors, proving or disproving Adam’s testimony became a point upon which reputations could be advanced or challenged. While many such anecdotes were deployed in debates over heredity, Adam’s testimony was held in doubt seemingly because the specimen itself was so available to scrutiny and study. Anyone with access to the plant might find a means of proving or disproving Adam’s story of how the tree was created, and this caused a problem for emerging sources of authority within the gardening and botanical sphere. This paper argues that Adam’s laburnum helps us to understand how the gardening and horticultural periodicals of the 19th century began to compromise the authority that nurserymen held on grafting and plant breeding. Specifically, it shows us how cultivating and observing specimens like Adam’s laburnum provided a means by which anecdotal stories like Adam’s testimony could be retold at emerging levels of scientific authority. By respectfully doubting Adam’s authority as a competent practitioner, Adam’s story of the tree’s origins could be re-told from a position of higher authority.\n\nWhile the only records we have of Adam stem from interviews and investigations of his nursery by members of the Société, his position as a nurseryman active within Paris tells us a good deal about why his testimony and his own opinion of the plant’s origin mattered to botanists like Poiteau. For several decades, historians of biology and botany have worked to draw attention to the importance of the experiments and the labour of figures like Adam. Anne Secord was the first to suggest that the history of botany could be told from the perspective of labourers and artisans who contributed to its work (Secord 1994, 270). Gardeners and practitioners have long played a constitutive role in the development of plant heredity and plant sciences: not only conceiving of themselves as experimenters and part of a scientific discourse, but also in undertaking experiments and manipulations that fell outside the interests and terrain of institutional figures (Curry 2014, 542; Ratcliff 2007; Secord 1994; Spary 2003). Marsha Richmond, in her (2006) demonstrated that William Bateson’s Mendelian research relied heavily upon domestic environments. Helen Anne Curry has given what she terms amateur activity an important position within the history of biology, arguing that we need to attach more consequence to the practical desire on the part of plant breeders and practitioners stretching back into the 19th century to harness the powers in spontaneous variation (Curry 2014, 2016).\n\nLooking at the long 18th century, Marc Ratcliff has argued that florists, cultivators, and livestock farmers, “understood their practices of transforming sorts and species [as] the influence of human art on nature” (Ratcliff 2007, 229). Both points, that gardeners (including nurserymen) played a key role in the experimental work, and also that they saw themselves as practitioners of a ‘human art’ upon nature, are important, as many authorities were quick to represent the experimental contributions of figures like Adam as wholly accidental or as the product of chance. Commercial nurseries in 18th century Paris, according to Easterby-Smith, enjoyed “patronage from an important network of scholars and wealthy collectors,” a dependency that remained true in 19th century France and Britain as well (Easterby-Smith 2015, 184). Ratcliff has shown that practitioners like Adam fit into hierarchies of authority, with practitioners commercially bound to the study and production of new varieties, while botanists remained politically and theologically dedicated to insisting on the fixity of species (2007, 211–212). Antoine Nicolas Duchesne (1747–1827), a practitioner who experimented on variation in Versailles, was a personal friend of many botanists in France and corresponded with botanists in Bern, Bologna, and Turin (Ratcliff 2007, 212). Adam seems to have been a peripheral figure in this world prior to 1830, and as I show below, Adam’s status as a nurseryman was put forward both as a means of trust and grounds for scepticism.\n\nMuch of the recent historiography on these communities consists of research focused on the colonial plant trade, where nurserymen played a key and integral part. This research has shown the influence and power wielded by nurserymen in Britain and France, particularly during the late 18th century.4 Sarah Easterby-Smith has argued that nurserymen and plant traders wielded influence over the scientific and commercial aspects of this sphere, first by marketing the science to a wider audience of amateurs, and secondly by being the principal agents behind the communication and diffusion of exotic specimens (Easterby-Smith 2013, 2015). McAleer, meanwhile, has looked at the significant role played by gardeners and nurserymen in colonial India and South Africa in maintaining the botanical networks that their European counterparts depended upon (McAleer 2016). Firms like James Veitch and Sons financed the collecting of exotic specimens abroad for its own nursery and also illustrations for Curtis’ Botanical Magazine (Olby 2000, 1044). Nurseries and the plant trade were essential to botany. While Adam was not known for his activity in these networks trading exotic plants, these networks nonetheless help us to understand the kind of authority and position that Adam wielded within botany as a plant trader active in Paris."
