        "text": "This exhibition devoted to American artist Robert Guinan (1934-2016) is the first to be held in a French museum since an exhibition at the Museum of Grenoble in 1981 and another at the Academy of France in Rome in 2005. Exhibitions of his works at the Albert Loeb Gallery (Paris) between 1973 and 2008 made the artist known in France.\n\nThis important selection of nearly eighty paintings and drawings is completed by two series of lithographs, one treating the theme of slavery while the other was inspired by the war poems of English pacifist poet Wilfred Owen. Originally from Watertown, New York, Guinan moved to Chicago in 1959. After having worked in Abstract Expressionism and Pop Art styles during his training, he adopted Realism in the 1970s, essentially using underprivileged members of society as his models. Deeply attached to Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Edgar Degas, the artist is sometimes compared to Edward Hopper.\n\nHowever, while Hopper depicts anonymous characters, Guinan paints portraits which reveal a sense of brotherhood with his models. In 1977, the museum acquired Portrait of Nelly Breda from the Lyon gallery Le Lutrin. This painting represents the mother of musician Emile Breda, Guinan’s friend and nightlife companion, who introduced him to most of his models. Notably through his bar scenes and portraits, Guinan delivers a traightforward reality of those living on the fringe of the American dream.\n\nExhibition curators\n\nSylvie Ramond, Director General of Pôle des musées d’art de Lyon MBA | macLYON. Chief Curator, Director Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon, and Albert and Sonia Loeb.\n\nThe exhibition Forms of the Ruin has its origins in the book by art historian and archaeologist Alain Schnapp, Une histoire universelle des ruines. Des origines aux Lumières, published in 2020 by Éditions du Seuil, of which it is a variation. The aim of the exhibition is to make this history visible, from a global and comparative perspective, from prehistory to the contemporary period.\n\nWhy are some works considered to be memorials while others arouse no interest at all until they are rediscovered ? The Greeks looked at the ruins of Egypt or the remains of the palaces of Assyria with unparalleled enthusiasm. The Romans were mad for about Greek works of art and flocked to the sanctuaries to admire them. The clerics of the Middle Ages regarded Roman remains with both admiration and concern. During the Renaissance, curiosity about the Greco-Roman world and the civilisations of America took hold. During the Enlightenment, this interest spread TO include Asia, Africa and Oceania. This Western scenario differs from that of China, Japan and the Arab-Muslim world, which developed their own uses of ruins.\n\nDrawing on a selection of over 300 works, this exhibition is designed as a journey through ruins, in an ongoing dialogue between civilisations and is centered around four themes: memory and oblivion, the tension between nature and culture, the link between the material and the immaterial, and the confrontation between the present and the future. Its ambition is to question societies through history and at the same time to confront the research of contemporary artists in their desire to interpret the ruins of our industrial societies and imagine their future.\n\nThe exhibition Forms of the Ruin has its origins in the book by art historian and archaeologist Alain Schnapp, Une histoire universelle des ruines.

Oman National Museum in Muscat will display artefacts from Lyon Museum of Fine Arts, in an exhibition entitled ‘Fragrant Journeys’ built around the theme of perfume and incense (17 October 2022 - 7 May 2023). In May, visitors to the Museum of Fine Arts will be invited to discover Oman's historic and artistic heritage.\n\nThe Sultanate of Oman is quite rightly famed for the beauty of its landscapes with their mountains, sea, and desert, and has a rich history going back thousands of years with traditions that have fortunately been preserved. With around twenty pieces from Antiquity to the present day, including incense-burners, architectural fragments, metal artworks, manuscripts, and jewellery, this exhibition bears witness to Oman's rich culture.\n\nThe photographs of Ferrante Ferranti provide a highly evocative backdrop, transporting visitors into the heart of this captivating country.\n\nThe genius of Nicolas Poussin still has a few secrets to reveal. Poussin is an artist who has always been thought of as difficult, severe. He is the master of the classical French school, an archetypal painter-philosopher. Few people today know that he also gave himself over to the pure pleasure of painting, portraying some of the most sensual iconography, and that some of his paintings were deemed so erotic that they were defaced, cut up, even destroyed, from the 17th century onwards.\n\nThrough the theme of Love, which has rarely been so central to an artist's work, the museum aims to reveal this little-known side of Poussin: sensual, charming, seductive. The artist discovered Ovid before actually travelling to Rome, while under the influence of the audacious poet Giambattista Marino, in what would be a seminal encounter. Poussin then became famous for the Titianesque hedonism of his first Roman paintings, where the way Love takes control of men and gods alike is depicted in scenes taken from Ancient Greco-Roman myths. Love was a recurring theme and a constant source of inspiration for the artist right up until his final masterpieces, pictorial meditations on the wellspring of love's enduring power, as destructive as it is creative. A far cry from the austere image of the painter-philosopher which he showed to the public, the exhibition reveals a sensual, even erotic Poussin; a painter-poet who offers us a profound exploration of the universal and tragic power of love.\n\nThis exhibition dedicated to Poussin and love is an opportunity for the museum to give a prominent place to Nicolas Poussin's The Death of Chione, acquired in 2016, as it had been the case in 2008 with the exhibition about The flight to Egypt, a masterpiece acquired in 2007. Nicolas Poussin often stayed in Lyon and developed a large network of friendships and business connections which linked him to the city. This is how The Death of Chione came to be painted for Silvio I Reynon, a silk merchant from Lyon, during a visit to the city in around 1622. The exhibition is divided into five sections/parts, and displays around forty of Poussin's paintings and sketches. Two sections develop more specific focusses around a painting and a series of related sketches; the first around The Death of Chione from the museum’s collection, the second around Apollo in love with Daphne from the Louvre.\n\nCurators\n\nNicolas Milovanovic, Conservateur en chef du Patrimoine, Département des Peintures, musée du Louvre\n\nMickaël Szanto, Maître de conférences, Sorbonne Université\n\nLudmila Virassamynaïken, Conservatrice en chef du Patrimoine, en charge des peintures et sculptures anciennes, musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon\n\nWith the exceptional cooperation of the Louvre.\n\nThe Club du musée Saint-Pierre is the main sponsor of the exhibition. The Club du musée Saint-Pierre enabled the acquisition of The Death of Chione in 2016, since then exhibited in the museum's collections.\n\nPICASSO / POUSSIN / BACCHANALIA\n\nA thematic exhibition follows the Poussin and love show, examining the role Poussin's heritage played in the development of Picasso's erotic universe, inspired by Antiquity. Between the 19th and the 25th of August 1944, Picasso made a sketch and painted a gouache based on Nicolas Poussin's The Triumph of Pan (1636). Picasso's The Triumph of Pan from 1944 is part of a particularly fine body of work, full of pieces which explore the theme of pleasure and the excesses of Dionysian revelry.\n\nThis show is part of the official programme of the Picasso Celebration 1973–2023.\n\nThe exhibition was co-organized with the Picasso Museum – Paris"
