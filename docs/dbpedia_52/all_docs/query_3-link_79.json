        "text": "In my view, there are faults in our way of writing music that correspond to the ways of writing our language. The fact is that we write differently from how we play, and thus foreigners do not play our music as well as we play theirs.. .. [O]ur usage has enslaved us, and we persist in it. 1 The French clavecinistes were convinced of the strong connection between the French language and music. To them, such links could not only be made at the level of philosophical discourse, but also affected down-to-earth issues relating to composition and performance. Although most musicians seemed to agree that music was strongly influenced by language, the relationship was not always considered to be beneficial. Not only did composers discover defects in what we would term 'musical language', but they also correlated these weaknesses with parallel problems affecting certain aspects of verbal language. By mapping linguistic ideas onto aspects of French harpsichord music, I consider in this article how the French desire to rationalize usageça passion shared by both linguists and musiciansçshaped the development of clavecin music in matters of notation and performance from its traceable origins in the 1650s to its maturity in the music of Franc° ois Couperin and Rameau. The codification of music, driven by both aesthetic and practical concerns and by technical innovation (in particular the timely arrival of musical engraving in France), led to some visible outcomes, such as the expressed preference for printed music, the codification of ornaments, notes ine¤ gales, and other performance matters; the proliferation of published pedagogical and theoretical writings; and the replacement of unmeasured with measured preludes. However, there was also a growing awareness of the enormous gap between rules (theory) and usage (practice), and between notation and performance, and many musicians resorted to the more nebulous notion of le bon gou \" t as the ultimate way to legitimize all the exceptions , liberties, excesses, and grey areas in performance.\n\nInstitute of Musical Research, Senate House, London in collaboration with “The Renaissance Musical Work: Foundations, Repertories and Practices” funded by the Ministery of Innovation, Science and Universities [HAR2015-70181-P] based at the University of Valladolid IP: Soterraña Aguirre Rincón Thursday 27 June 2019 Keynote Speaker Kate van Orden, Harvard University Directors Manuel del Sol, University of Valladolid David Lee, University of Glasgow Stephen Rose, Royal Holloway, University of London Lydia Goehr’s The Imaginary Museum of Musical Works (1992) prompted heated discussions about how far the term and concept of the ‘musical work’ is appropriate for musical cultures of the 16th and 17th centuries. Whereas earlier discussions had focused on ontological issues and on theoretical treatises of the period, Goehr sought to provide what she termed a ‘historical’ approach, yet she was much criticised for her relatively unnuanced account of music history prior to 1750. Now, some twenty-six years on, the notion of ‘work’ is ripe for exploration from a much broader range of disciplinary perspectives including book history, performance studies, the study of historical improvisation, and economic ethnomusicology. Attributes usually associated with a musical work (such as notational fixity or durability in the repertory) need to be revised, in light of the increasing awareness of the importance of oral and memory-based cultures in the 16th and 17th centuries, as well as an increasingly nuanced understanding of the symbolic and practical functions of notated sources. Rather than traditional 20-minute papers, the convenors invite contributions to plenary sessions and round-table discussions relating to several key themes, including the various meanings of the terms ‘composition’, ‘improvisation’ and ‘work’ in the 16th and 17th centuries. We invite participation from perspectives that may include: ● Perspectives from book history on the musical work as notated opus ● Perspectives from economic ethnomusicology on the ‘work’ as a form of labour ● Perspectives from performance studies on ‘work’ within an oral culture of memorisation and improvisation ● Musical works and early modern notions of the musical author ● The relationship between the ephemeral and the durable, and its implications for the work as a form of social capital ● The implications for modern editorial practices Travel bursaries for postgraduate students will be available. The study day is supported by the Institute of Musical Research (Royal Holloway, University of London). RDI Project “The Renaissance Musical Work” <http://contrapunto.uva.es>\n\nThe middle part of the eighteenth century saw seismic shifts in philosophical and political thought. Closely related to these are a range of new aesthetic ideas and the musical styles associated with them. Instrumental music, and more specifically harpsichord music of mid- eighteenth-century France, has been surprisingly sparsely studied by musicologists and performers alike. While seventeenth- and early-eighteenth-century harpsichord composers and their works have been treated extensively, there is a definite lack of understanding and knowledge of the harpsichord music of the period following the death of François Couperin in 1733 and the publication around 1728 of Jean-Philippe Rameau’s last book written for solo harpsichord, Nouvelles Suites de Pièces de Clavecin. The succeeding decades were marked by a significant aesthetic shift, induced and observed by both French and foreign musicians, composers, and philosophers. I argue that these aesthetic changes are also evident in harpsichord music and can be observed in Jacques Duphly’s (1715–1789) four books of harpsichord music (1744, 1748, 1756, 1768), the focus of my research. Little information has been readily available regarding Duphly’s life, and up until now, no serious contemporary study has focused on this subject. As part of this dissertation, I am providing a biographical account of Duphly, from his birth in Rouen to his life in Paris, and a chronological presentation of the contents of his books. Included in this presentation is a stylistic analysis of his works, a corpus that features the traditional French harpsichord style as well as elements that were both modern and foreign. Particular attention is given to explaining the aesthetic context of mid-eighteenth-century Paris and its relation to expression in instrumental music, including the concepts of mesure and mouvement. A comprehensive review of French temperaments completes this presentation of the instrumental context of the period. Examples drawn from Duphly’s four books help illustrate how these temperaments as well as aesthetic and stylistic concepts can be understood and therefore used by musicians as part of a historically informed performance practice."
