        "text": "Introduction\n\nFrench literature is the body of written works in the French language produced by authors from France. The French people are proud of their language and of their long tradition of poetry, prose, and drama. Pure language and perfect form have been traditionally prized in French literature. This article focuses on the literature of France; for information on Canadian and African writing in the French language, see Canadian literature and African literature.\n\nThe French language was one of the five major Romance languages to develop from Latin as a result of the Roman occupation of western Europe. The French language began to develop in the 800s. In 813 the church ordered its priests to use “the rustic Roman language,” or Latin as it was spoken by people in everyday life, instead of classical Latin so the people might understand the sermons. From this form, the langue d’oïl of northern France, modern French developed.\n\nThe Jongleur’s Songs\n\nThe earliest French literature was in verse, for it was meant to be recited, not read. Few people could read. The arrival of a jongleur at a castle, fair, or market place, reciting his verses to musical accompaniment, was an important event.\n\nSometimes the jongleur performed a chanson de geste (a song of deeds of chivalry), sometimes a fabliau (a coarse comic tale), and sometimes a comic episode of the Roman de Renart (a form of simple satire). Naïve religious faith and frank realism are two recurrent features of medieval French literature.\n\nThe chansons de geste originated along the principal pilgrimage routes. They were probably written by clerics or jongleurs to instruct the pilgrims, to attract their attention to church relics, and to make money. The greatest chanson de geste is the Chanson de Roland. Its themes of honor and Christian faith reflect the times. (See also Roland.)\n\nThe Roman de Renart is a comic description of feudal society in which animals play the part of humans. The hero of these tales, Renard the fox, became so popular that renard replaced the old French word for fox.\n\nMedieval literature reached its height in the 12th and 13th centuries. Toward the end of the 12th century Chrétien de Troyes expressed the aristocratic ideals of honor and courtly love in his versification of the Breton romances. These were centered around King Arthur and the Round Table.\n\nGuillaume de Lorris’ famous unfinished allegorical poem, called the Roman de la Rose, followed the courtly tradition. Jean de Meung, a practical bourgeois who understood nothing of the courtly ideal, finished the romance around 1277. His half of it is an encyclopedia of knowledge and an attack on religious and social abuses.\n\nProse Beginnings\n\nChronicles of the Crusades were the first significant prose. Jean de Joinville’s History of St. Louis portrayed the last pure impulse of the Crusades and the life of a saintly king (see Louis IX). Later in the 14th century Jean Froissart gave a vivid account of chivalry during the Hundred Years’ War. Unknowingly, he also revealed the decay behind the chivalric display. The ideals that gave dignity to the Middle Ages were in decline.\n\nThe imminent death of those ideals is clear in the 15th-century Mémoires of Philippe de Comines and the poems of François Villon, France’s first great lyric poet. Comines was a politician who introduced psychology to diplomacy and scorned chivalry. Honor, for him, meant success. He found a fitting model in King Louis XI. Villon’s poetry was like his life. The Great Testament and the Little Testament reveal the soul of a scholar, a vagabond and thief, a murderer, and a troubled Christian. Villon’s preoccupation with the physical decay of death reflected the medieval belief that human nature, stained by original sin, is corrupt. Theology provided the focus of medieval thought.\n\nRenaissance Literature\n\nThe Renaissance brought to 16th-century France an appreciation of the formal beauty of ancient Greek and Roman art. These writers were called humanists. A group of poets called La Pléiade rejected medieval poetic forms for those of ancient Greece and Italy. Pierre de Ronsard was the leader of this group.\n\nThe exuberant François Rabelais was one of the early humanists. He published Pantagruel in 1533 and Gargantua in 1534. These stories are characterized by good-natured coarse humor and satire. They are parodies of the medieval romances. They also reflect Rabelais’ intoxication with the full intellectual and physical life. Rabelais wanted his giants to possess all human knowledge.\n\nJohn Calvin was a humanist. He accepted the Christian concept of the natural corruption of humankind. He rejected, however, the idea that the church must interpret God and the Bible for the Christian. This is a humanist attitude. His Institutes of the Christian Religion was the first important theological work to be published in French.\n\nMichel de Montaigne gave both form and name to the modern essay. The name itself, essai, meaning “experiment,” expressed his philosophy of doubt and skepticism. Caught in the fierce religious wars, Montaigne believed in the supreme value of life, a life lived at ease. Skepticism and doubt made possible intellectual escape from questions of dogma. Contrasted with Rabelais’ “encyclopedic” knowledge, Montaigne wanted to develop people’s judgment. His Essays paint a charmingly indiscreet portrait of a normal human being.\n\nThe Classic Period\n\nIn contrast to the free disorder of 16th-century literature, French works of the 17th century were characterized by formality and by logic and reason. François de Malherbe insisted on intelligibility of language. By making personal advantage and advancement hinge on royal favor, Cardinal Richelieu helped establish the brilliant court society for which classic literature was written. Meanwhile the précieux movement was bringing order and refinement to social life. It revived the aristocratic courtly ideal and set standards of social behavior. The movement was responsible for one of the basic principles that governed classic literature—the proprieties.\n\nThe French Academy, established in 1635, furthered the cause of ordered reason. It renewed Malherbe’s standard of good usage as the measure of literary language and accepted the role of arbiter in literary affairs. In 1637 René Descartes made a method of reason in Discourse on Method. Blaise Pascal soon after used reason and wit against his religious opponents in Provincial Letters.\n\nThe Rules of Classicism\n\nClassic literature was written according to the rules set forth by Aristotle and other theorists. The rules were honored because they were in accord with reason, not because of tradition. They were less a handicap to the great classic writers than an expression of their genius.\n\nThe chief rule was verisimilitude, or writing that gave the appearance of reality and truth. Verisimilitude emphasized structure and form. It resulted in universal themes and characters and, eventually, led to action that was almost entirely psychological. Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux, France’s first great literary critic, summarized the classic doctrine in The Art of Poetry.\n\nOnly one great novel, Marie de La Fayette’s Princess of Cleves, was published during the classic golden age. The real achievements of classic art were theatrical. Most important were Pierre Corneille’s heroic tragedies of the will, Jean Racine’s penetrating analyses of passion, and Molière’s comedies of character and manners. The charming Fables of Jean de la Fontaine and the theological works of Jacques Bossuet reflect the psychological keenness and the rational logic of the period.\n\nDecline of Classicism\n\nThe revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685) marked the beginning of the decline of classicism. Reason soon triumphed over art. Faith in progress brought disrespect for the ancients. Although some works in the first half of the 18th century retained classic form, classicism as a source of inspiration was dead.\n\nAmong poets and dramatists, only Pierre Marivaux deserves mention for his fine analysis of youthful love in such plays as The Game of Love and Chance. Jean de la Bruyère’s famous Characters combined traditional moral and psychological analysis with a new element—social criticism.\n\nRomanticism\n\nA new type of literature, Romantic rather than classic, appeared in the 18th century. The change was brought about in part by a new interest in science and a growing awareness of differing manners and customs throughout the world. There was also a new concern for a more exact reproduction of reality than the artistic illusion of classic verisimilitude. The emphasis on emotionalism increased. The new emotionalism was apparent in the “tearful comedies” of Pierre de la Chaussée, in Abbé Prévost’s famous novel Manon Lescaut, and in the works of Denis Diderot and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. (See also Romanticism.)\n\nCharles de Montesquieu, an important 18th-century writer, began his literary career with Persian Letters. In this book two Persians express their amazement at the novelty of French manners and morals. More important to Americans was Montesquieu’s The Spirit of Laws. His theory of the separation of powers influenced the fathers of the American Revolution.\n\nAlthough Voltaire was the most celebrated poet and classic tragedian of his day, he is best remembered for his role as a philosophe. Voltaire’s brilliant, mocking wit and his biting criticism of intolerance and abuses made him one of the chief destroyers of the “old regime.” The satirical Candide is perhaps his most widely known work.\n\nDiderot’s fame among his contemporaries rested on his role as editor of the 28-volume Encyclopédie (see Encyclopédistes). The work was both a survey of knowledge and an arsenal of source material that could be directed against church and state. Diderot’s literary reputation rests on his remarkable dialogue between an 18th-century philosophe and the dissolute Rameau, who lived according to instinct and emotion. The dialogue is entitled Rameau’s Nephew.\n\nRousseau was the most influential literary figure of the 18th century. His Discourse on Inequality and his Social Contract have placed their stamp on many diverse political and economic theories. The novel Émile forecast modern educational ideas. Rousseau’s influential novel the New Héloïse is hardly readable today. He is best known for his Confessions.\n\nPierre de Beaumarchais’ Marriage of Figaro summed up the effervescent 18th century. The sparkling Figaro symbolized all the legitimate complaints of the person of talent against a political and social order in which privilege depended upon birth.\n\nThe Revolution of 1789 swept away the aristocracy and all taste for classic literature according to the rules. Although a new literature was now possible, there was no complete break with the past. The exotic local color, the rebellious hero, and the subjectivism of François de Chateaubriand’s Atala and René link him to the future. In many ways, however, the gloomy Chateaubriand is tied to the past. Benjamin Constant’s analytical novel Adolphe and Madame de Staël’s Corinne are also transitional.\n\nThese three writers helped prepare the way for the Romanticism of the 1820s. Romanticism was technically a revolt against the classic rules, a battle which was won by Victor Hugo’s Hernani on the stage. Alfred de Vigny’s Chatterton, a classically structured work about misunderstood genius, is the best of the Romantic plays.\n\nRomanticism was essentially subjective and antirational, yet it had philosophic pretentions. The Romantic revolted against society and fate. There were several new poetic tendencies. Alphonse de Lamartine delicately analyzed his own emotions. Hugo appealed to the senses. Vigny’s poems were philosophical. Alfred de Musset wrote moving lyrics. In the novel, Romantic local color gave rise to pseudohistorical reconstructions, such as Hugo’s The Hunchback of Notre Dame.\n\nThe artistic revolution was won by 1830. Meanwhile a growing industrialization was creating an urban proletariat and social problems. The Romantic leaders began to turn their attention to society itself.\n\nGeorge Sand turned from sentimental novels to vaguely socialistic ones. Hugo began his Les Misérables. Théophile Gautier protested against the trend with the theory of “art for art’s sake.” In his poems, however, he tried to achieve the effect of painting. This accorded with the shift back toward artistic objectivity. Two notable French novelists combined Romanticism with this tendency. The plots and characters of Honoré de Balzac’s panoramic La Comédie humaine are Romantic, but the settings and manners are very realistic.\n\nThe novelist Stendhal employed Romantic plots, but the psychology of his characters rests on careful observations. The nouvelles of Prosper Mérimée, especially the well-known Carmen, show the same desire to portray truthfully local detail. Gustave Flaubert expressed the conflict between his own Romantic inclinations and the realities of contemporary society in his objective novels. Thus the novel became more realistic.\n\nThe Parnassian movement in poetry blended philosophy with formal perfection. Charles Baudelaire, a great poet, had the Parnassian reverence for art and the Romantic distaste for the values of contemporary society. Baudelaire, however, was a poet of the future who prepared the way for the symbolist movement at the turn of the century and 20th-century surrealism.\n\nWriters who exactly reproduced reality were called naturalists. The brothers Edmond and Jules de Goncourt limited their observation to the physically and psychologically abnormal. Émile Zola’s personal experience restricted the Rougon-Macquart series, including Germinal and The Dramshop, to the sordid side of life. The most familiar naturalist works are the cheerful exaggerations of Alphonse Daudet and the stories of Guy de Maupassant.\n\nÉmile Augier and Alexandre Dumas the Younger had introduced careful observation, social criticism, and moral themes to the theater. Henri Becque soon brought “slices of life” to the stage in The Woman of Paris. Scientific determinism invaded literary criticism with Hippolyte Taine.\n\nRise of Symbolism\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, the symbolist movement reacted against Parnassianism, naturalism, and science in literature. Symbolism tried to restore a romantic sense of mystery to poetry.\n\nThe musically suggestive verses of Paul Verlaine, the attempts of Arthur Rimbaud to discover a profound reality beneath appearances, and the metaphysical explorations of Stéphane Mallarmé gave rise to the symbolist movement. The delicately skeptical novels of Anatole France, the exotic novels of Pierre Loti, and the traditionalist writings of the stylist Maurice Barrès bridged the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nNew Values and Techniques\n\nThe Dreyfus affair, social conflict, rapid technological change, and the seemingly senseless slaughter of World War I made a mockery of old values. The philosophy of Henri Bergson stressed the fundamental irrationality of human beings. Paul Valéry combined in his poems Bergsonian intuition with rigorous intellectualism. Marcel Proust described the passing of a highly stylized society in his masterful In Search of Lost Time, a massive novel that includes the volumes Swann’s Way, Within a Budding Grove, The Guermantes Way, Cities of the Plain, The Captive, The Sweet Cheat Gone, and Time Regained.\n\nDadaism, an artistic movement, was a revolt against a world that human intelligence had failed to control. Dadaism’s successor, surrealism, was equally anti-intellectual. By using such techniques as automatic writing, the surrealist poets attempted to plumb their subconscious. The principal surrealist poets were André Breton, Paul Éluard, and Louis Aragon.\n\nAndré Gide attacked traditional values in his novels The Immoralist, The Pastoral Symphony, and The Counterfeiters. Gide established sincerity to oneself as a basic theme of 20th-century literature. The symbol-laden plays of Paul Claudel gave Roman Catholicism as an answer to human problems. His beautiful The Tidings Brought to Mary is the most understandable of Claudel’s plays.\n\nA new generation of novelists worked out personal solutions to the problem of a meaningful existence. The powerful novels of François Mauriac depicted the anguish of the individual in a world without God. Henry de Montherlant boasted the values of virile individualism. Jean Giono suggested a return to nature. André Malraux advocated revolutionary action. Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s tale of The Little Prince, a child’s fable written for adults, with a gentle and grave reminder that the best things in life are still the simplest ones and that real wealth is giving to others.\n\nWorld War II confirmed for many writers the absurdity of human existence in a meaningless universe. Albert Camus studied this absurdity in The Stranger but suggested that people could revolt because they are free. Later, in The Plague, he argued the need for action against absurd catastrophe. Camus’ The Fall was less optimistic.\n\nThe existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre rejected the belief in a complete personal freedom. He maintained that a person is responsible for himself and for the world. Sartre and his longtime companion, the writer Simone de Beauvoir, usually portrayed antiheroes—that is, characters who have failed to recognize their own freedom and exercise it.\n\nFrench Literature since 1950\n\nIn the decades after 1950, disillusion, cynicism, and experimentalism remained the dominant characteristics of French literature. The expression of these characteristics varied, however.\n\nSamuel Beckett, born in Ireland but French by choice, is considered one of the masters of the theater of the absurd, a literature that deliberately distorts the structure of the novel or play to show how grimly ridiculous human lives may be. In his works Beckett used farce to paint a pessimistic allegory of the human condition.\n\nEugène Ionesco was another dramatist who contributed to the theater of the absurd. His early plays, such as The Bald Soprano, were grotesque comic farces. Later, in Rhinoceros, his symbolism became more explicit.\n\nJean Genet probed more deeply into the questions of good and evil in a hypocritical society and the illusions people live by. His own bitterness and disillusion were projected in his nightmare-like plays The Maids, The Balcony, Deathwatch, and The Blacks. The degrading experiences of growing up in the French underworld were described in the novels Miracle of the Rose and Our Lady of the Flowers and his autobiographical Thief’s Journal.\n\nWhen she was only 19, Françoise Sagan became an international celebrity with the publication of Bonjour Tristesse. A phenomenal best-seller, it was translated into 20 languages. Sagan’s characters, who were victims of their own boredom and cultivated cynicism, portray the aimlessness and frustration of French youth. American movies were made of her first novel, as well as A Certain Smile and Aimez-vous Brahms? (as Goodbye Again).\n\nAnother expression of the literary rebellion against society was the anti-novel, or “new novel,” which attacked traditional form and style, plot, and characterization, played leapfrog with time and space, and left interpretation of thought and feeling to the reader. Thus Alain Robbe-Grillet, one of the leading writers in the movement, left out necessary facts in his novels The Voyeur and Jealousy. In Second Thought and in Degrees, Michel Butor dealt symbolically with psychological, not objective, time and memory. Claude Mauriac dealt with the imperceptible flow of time in The Dinner Party.\n\nSince the late 1970s, younger French writers have turned away from the new novel. Some, like Didier Martin, used fantasy to comment on the modern world. In Un Garçon en l’air, Martin wrote of a man who had the gift of flight but whose gift brought him only loneliness. Other writers turned to historical fiction. La Mort viennoise by Christiane Singer was more than “escape” fiction; it was a moving and profound novel about a time of plague in 17th-century Vienna. There was one striking, progressive note. The new role of women and their liberation was explored in such novels as Un Arbre voyageur by Claire Etcherelli and L’Indiscrétion faite à Charlotte by Alain Jouffroy.\n\nHistoriography made a bold splash on the literary scene, and Fernand Braudel is universally recognized as one of the greatest influences on 20th-century historians. In his monumental two-volume The Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II, he vividly demonstrated that geography, climate, and culture are the underlying realities that influence the politics of a region.\n\nAnne Neigoff\n\nElwyn F.
