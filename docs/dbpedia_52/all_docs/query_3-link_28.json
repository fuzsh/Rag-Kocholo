        "text": "ABSTRACT\n\nThe French chemist Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) chose to be actively engaged in the fine arts throughout his life—yet scholarship has ignored or dismissed these pursuits. This empirical study documents his unknown, but deep involvement with art and artists from age thirteen until his death. This was no casual pastime. Art animated Pasteur. It was also at times useful to him for making political statements, cultivating status, and supporting loyal friends. This account identifies nearly twenty significant friendships with painters and sculptors and uncovers over thirty other artists with whom his associations deserve examination. The narrative suggests points at which art was especially germane to his scientific career and possible junctures that merit further research. Evidence from his artistic friendships also corrects the common picture of Pasteur as a dour workaholic who never laughed or smiled.\n\nContents\n\nArt before science (1834–1842)\n\nGraduate study in Paris (1843–1848)\n\nEarly teaching and research at Strasbourg (1849–1854)\n\nApplying chemistry to practical problems at Lille (1854–1857)\n\nVisual thinking in Pasteur’s crystallography and chemistry\n\nIn Paris, further discoveries and a revitalized engagement with the fine arts (1857–68)\n\nNew bonds with art students and colleagues (1863–1868)\n\nAchievements, recognition, and popular acclaim in France (1868–84)\n\nSaving lives and shaping a reputation part 1: the scientist (1884–88)\n\nSaving lives and shaping a reputation part 2: the man in the paintings (1884–88)\n\nHonoured in retirement, and still managing art and artists (1888–1894)\n\nPasteur’s final year (1895)\n\nReflections on art in Pasteur’s life\n\nThe familiar picture of Louis Pasteur is remarkably incomplete for a figure of such historical influence. Pasteur loved art before he loved science. He found success in art before he found it in science. This study brings to light the multiplicity of Pasteur’s personal connections with works of art and with people in the fine arts. Throughout his career, the closest friends with whom he spent informal time over supper at home were painters and sculptors. He loved to socialize with artists, and he made time to call on them in their studios and to visit art exhibits with them even with a very busy life. Yet his rich and gratifying relationships with artists, reviewers, patrons, and journalists have been ignored or dismissed by his biographers.Footnote1 And in the mass of publications on Pasteur, one would search in vain for sustained scholarly research into his relationship to the fine arts prior to three specialized articles I published in 2015 and 2017. The present account combines substantial new discoveries with material from those articles into a comprehensive narrative for his whole life.Footnote2\n\nDocumenting these engagements introduces more complexity and humanity into the received picture by highlighting enthusiasms, emotional bonds, and personality features that become visible only when we survey numerous anecdotes, any of which might appear minor or trivial on its own. A myriad of detailed little stories establishes the nature and the extent of Pasteur’s engagement with the fine arts and displaces received assertions and assumptions. This article supports several new understandings, and by establishing a consistent pattern in all periods of his life, it also connects his biography more fully to the cultural and social milieux he inhabited and the choices he made about how he lived in the wider world. And conversely, this story also reveals much about his era, about science in general, and specifically about how scientific advance came just then to garner a new kind of media attention and burst into the consciousness of the general public. Artistic pursuits energized him, guided his social life, shaped his powers of observation in the lab as well as in museums, and became a tool he used to cultivate patronage and his public stature. In these ways and more, art gave him both pleasure and power.Footnote3\n\nIn both scholarly and popular writing about Louis Pasteur, a persistent theme has been that, in Debré’s words, he ‘never thought about anything but working’.Footnote4 Following the patterns of earlier biographers, Geison wrote, ‘Even his most loyal disciples conceded that he lacked the gift of repartée, or anything like a sense of humour. He was instead profoundly serious, almost dour’.Footnote5 More recently, Orsenna proclaimed that Pasteur ‘never laughed’.Footnote6 To be sure, work was paramount to him. Even devotion to the family was constrained by work, as acknowledged by his wife in a letter to their adult daughter. On a wedding anniversary, she wrote simply, ‘Your father is absorbed in his thoughts, says little to me, sleeps little, rises at dawn, and, in one word, continues the life I began with him thirty-five years ago today’.Footnote7 But science was not his only focus. Artist friends brought out another side of his personality and tapped his sense of humour. With artist friends, and at times with his family, Pasteur could be quite genial, making jokes and indulging in self-mockery.\n\n1. Art before science (1834–1842)\n\nThe centrality of the fine arts in his life began during adolescence and never abated. Pasteur was born in Dole in late 1822 in the department of Jura in the Franche-Comté region. When he was about four, his family took up residence in nearby Arbois. This house would serve him throughout his life even when he worked elsewhere.Footnote8 His loyalty to this region and its people remained a firm commitment, as seen in the warmth and the support he extended to those he called his Franc-Comtois compatriots.\n\nIn his teens, Pasteur exhibited a precocious talent for drawing, and for about six years he was a committed student of two art teachers, learning new skills and producing careful but subtle portraits of family members, neighbours, and local dignitaries who sat for him.Footnote9 About thirty examples survive: a few lithographs and the rest in pastel or charcoal (See ). We have no figure sketches (other than drawing of a sculpture), landscapes, or interior scenes. His first drawing teacher was Étienne-Charles Pointurier (1809–1853) at the collège in his hometown. Then at the collège in Besançon, where he started in the fall of 1839 at the age of sixteen, Pasteur spent even more time on drawing, and he took up lithography. There he studied with Charles-Antoine Flageoulot (also Flajoulot, 1774–1840).Footnote10 Just the prior year Flageoulot had been a teacher of Gustave Courbet, another son of Franche-Comté, three years older than Pasteur. Their hometowns of Arbois and Ornans lie about fifty kilometres apart. Courbet would become as important a revolutionary in art as Pasteur would be in science. I have been unable to document if Courbet and Pasteur ever met although they did share close mutual friends. (In later life, they were on opposite ends of the political spectrum.) Pasteur’s works received encouragement from many in Besançon, where his portrait of the headmaster was successful enough to be displayed on a wall in the collège’s parlour. Another portrait he made was in the vice-principal’s office.Footnote11\n\nCharles Chappuis, friend of Pasteur. Lithograph executed by Louis Pasteur in 1841 and inscribed in 1845: ‘Portrait de mon camarade de philosophie, Ch. Chappuis. Fait à Besançon en 1841’. © Institut Pasteur/Musée Pasteur. Used with permission.\n\nThree features of portraiture in Pasteur’s era helped shape his approach and they highlight early experiences that seem likely to have played a role later in his science. First, even amateur images were especially precious to the sitters and their families in the time before photography could preserve what people looked like. Second, realism and resemblance were paramount goals of such work. And third, the test of resemblance requires an especially accurate portrayal of facial features in situations where all the viewers are likely to know the person depicted. There is no latitude for deviation from the real. This pressure for accuracy shaped his art. This power of intensely close visual examination was a special skill of his not necessarily possessed by his peers in science.\n\nDuring these years Pasteur was preparing for a teaching position in France’s centrally administered higher education system. His father hoped he would teach in the collège at Arbois, or at least nearby. Louis had more ambition, thinking that, with study at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris (ENS), he could achieve a university-level position in a city instead. At this time, however, his academic achievements showed little potential for the professorial aspiration that he acquired from his good friend Charles Chappuis, a year ahead of him and a better student. Remarkably, in contrast with people’s appreciation of Pasteur’s art work at this time, his grades in physics and chemistry gave no hint of future promise. When he finished his Baccalaureate in Letters in 1840 at age 17, his work in science was judged only ‘good’. At the end of the following year, he failed his exams for the Baccalaureate in Science. Then after doing a second year of advanced science study at Besançon, his performance in chemistry was raised to ‘mediocre’. He did pass entrance examinations for the ENS, but after ranking only fifteenth among twenty-two, he declined admission and undertook another year of preparation to compete afresh the next summer. This time he studied in Paris near his friend Chappuis. Next year’s exams were far better, earning him a first prize in physics, and he entered the ENS in fall 1843 as the fourth-ranked student in the class. Just before leaving home for Paris in fall 1842, he drew what is believed to be his final pastel, a portrait of his father. In 1843 he explored a new medium in Paris, devoting some time to copying works of masters like Michelangelo and David in pencil and charcoal.Footnote12\n\nAlthough his drawings had garnered notice in Besançon, they were largely set aside when he left for graduate study in Paris. In the twentieth century, examples have been reproduced several times; but during his lifetime they had minimal visibility beyond family and friends. Historians of science have largely missed the chance to see in six years devoted to lessons and drawing practice any possible inspiration for his stellar career in science and have paid them little attention. For example, in a comprehensive biography, Debré said little about the drawing instruction.Footnote13 Dubos wrote in his book that the portraits ‘were no more than the conscientious expression of his immediate surroundings’.Footnote14 Dubos did quote, however, these much later remarks of Albert Edelfelt, a major Parisian artist and a dear friend (introduced more fully below).\n\nOutside of science, painting is one of the few things that interest him. […] Some of these pastels are in his home at the Institute, and I have looked at them very often. They are extremely good and drawn with energy, full of character, a little dry in colour, but far superior to the usual work of young people who destine themselves to an artistic career. […] I am certain that had M. Pasteur selected art instead of science, France would count today one more able painter.Footnote15\n\nThe internationally renowned French painter Léon Gérôme is reported to have said, ‘Luckily Pasteur headed toward chemistry or what a competitor we would have had!’Footnote16\n\nWhile Pasteur put drawing and lithography aside at nineteen, he did not abandon the habit of viewing of things most carefully and with uncanny concentration. And while Pasteur seems not to have tried his hand at sculpture, he was superb at conceptualizing things in three dimensions, something that turned out to be a key element at several points in his scientific work. Seeing things without distraction became a hallmark of his laboratory style. Some scholars have argued that Pasteur was actually helped by his myopia, which made his close-up vision better than his colleagues’ and showed him things not seen by others.Footnote17 But whether or not he gained from the deficiency, Pasteur did make novel observations with his unlimited patience for quiet, contemplative gazing at such boring things as the slow movement of silk worms or the murky fuzziness of unstained cells in culture solutions. Dubos provided a substantial account of the role played by intense concentration in Pasteur’s work. Geison likewise described Pasteur’s ability to spend long hours looking at something and his almost trance-like focus, citing Émile Roux and Adrien Loir, two of his closest collaborators.Footnote18 This fact suggests that in the Edelfelt portrait discussed below the artist captured Pasteur’s visual concentration as a characteristic feature, a dimension of his personality that Edelfelt saw—unlike others who did Pasteur portraits—because he observed him in the laboratory, not in the studio.\n\n2. Graduate study in Paris (1843–1848)\n\nWhile Pasteur was studying at the ENS, he worked as a laboratory assistant in chemistry. His own research examined the rotation of polarized light by different solutions, confronting problems that crossed the border between physics and chemistry, and he made key discoveries about tartrates and asymmetry in crystals, presenting theses in both physics and chemistry. Intellectually ground-breaking, his achievements also brought his first significant recognition by scientists other than his mentors, including the great Jean-Baptiste Biot, an elder statesman of science. Pasteur’s new direction was established by his 1847 physics thesis on application of the rotational power of some liquids, in which he resolved several problems in chemistry. On the same day he also defended a chemistry thesis. In 1848 a report from Pasteur was presented to the prestigious Academy of Sciences, ‘On the relation that can exist between crystalline form and chemical composition, and on the causes of rotational polarization’. Although it is hard to imagine that the youthful Pasteur did not explore the fine arts while living in the capital city, no documents confirming this have yet been found.\n\n3. Early teaching and research at Strasbourg (1849–1854)\n\nHaving just turned twenty-six, Pasteur moved to Strasbourg in January 1849 for his first teaching position. Less than a month after arriving, and in the midst of the seductive thrills of research, Pasteur met Marie Laurent, a daughter of the university’s Rector. The courtship moved fast. Letters reveal Pasteur’s agony over the tension between marriage and work, but also his sense of humour. In writing to Marie on 31 March, Louis, always the scientist, cited evidence to support his case. ‘There is nothing in me to attract a young girl’s fancy. But my recollections tell me that those who have known me very well have loved me very much’. A little farther along in the same note he wrote, ‘time will show you that, below my cold, shy and unpleasing exterior, there is a heart full of affection for you!’ And, most poignant in its self-awareness is a note of 3 April, in which he acknowledged his other passion, ‘I, who did so love my crystals!’Footnote19 They were married before the end of May. The following April, their first child, a girl named Jeanne, was born. Perhaps the new domesticity revived his love for drawing as he made an ink sketch of his wife nursing on the inside cover of a laboratory notebook.Footnote20 Other than apparatus or microbes, this is apparently the only drawing by Pasteur after his student days (See ).\n\nLouis Pasteur, sketch of wife and daughter (ca. 1850) in a ms. notebook NAF17923, Département des manuscrits, Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris.

Non-commercial use permitted.\n\nOver the next seven or so years, the young chemist established new relationships between optical activity, chemical composition, and macroscopic structure of crystals. In time these insights would apply also to molecular structure, i.e. the spatial arrangement of the constituent atoms in a compound. His reports gained the attention of top scientists, earning personal support and winning prizes. In April 1849 Pasteur reported on molecular dissymmetry and in 1850 on the composition of racemic acid. Two years later his work on aspartic and malic acids was presented to the Academy of Sciences.\n\nAutumn 1852 offered a research trip to vinegar factories. Pasteur made stops in Zwickau and Vienna, abandoning plans for Trieste and Venice in order to visit Prague, before returning home via Dresden. He wrote to his wife about some of the artworks he had seen.\n\nI took advantage of the day of my stopover in Dresden to visit the Saxon capital, and I can assure you that I saw some admirable things. There is a most beautiful museum containing pictures by the first masters of every school [i.e. the Zwinger]. I spent over four hours in the galleries, noting on my little catalogue the pictures I most enjoyed. Those that drew my attention I marked with a cross; but soon I was putting two, three crosses, according to the degree of my enthusiasm. I even went as far as four.\n\nI also visited what they call the Green Vault [named for the columns painted green with malachite pigment], an absolutely unique collection of works of art, jewels, and precious stones collected at great expense by a prince, Augustus, King of Poland, a great friend of the arts.Footnote21\n\nUnfortunately, Pasteur’s copy of the catalogue booklet for the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister is lost and we cannot learn which paintings he liked so much in Dresden.Footnote22 The diverse items in the royal palace’s famous cabinet of curiosities known as the Green Vault (Grünes Gewölbe) must have fascinated this young crystallographer and chemist, who also made clear his appreciation of the value of noble patronage for the arts and sciences. At the height of his career, Pasteur readily pursued support from the Emperor Napoleon III, the Empress Joséphine, royalist politicians, and years later from the Russian Czar, the Sultan of Turkey, and the Emperor of Brazil. Pasteur’s books on diseases of wines and diseases of silk worms, each containing innovative chromolithographs, were dedicated respectively to the Emperor and to the Empress.\n\nIn Vienna Pasteur specifically searched out a monument by the great Venetian sculptor Antonio Canova (1757–1822) (See ). Pasteur deemed it ‘the most beautiful of Canova’s masterpieces’. As he wrote his wife, ‘you cannot imagine anything more touching and more remarkable as a work of art’. He observed that, as sculpture, it surpassed even the ‘magnificent tomb’ of the Maréchal de Saxe by Jean-Baptiste Pigalle in the St. Thomas church in Strasbourg, the city where they were livingFootnote23 (See ). His letters reveal the substantial effort he made on a scientific tour to find and view key artistic treasures he had known of in advance. Revealingly, he linked his enthusiasm for what he saw to a large mausoleum he clearly had seen with his wife. I note that as Catholics the Pasteurs would not have worshipped at the Protestant St. Thomas church, but apparently visited it to view the Marshall’s tomb.\n\nMonument to Marie Christine of Habsbourg-Lorraine by Antonio Canova (ca. 1805) in the Church of the Augustines, Vienna.

Author photograph, 2013.\n\nEarly in 1853, Pasteur reported on the origin of racemic acid, and a few months later demonstrated to Biot in Biot’s own laboratory that he could transform tartaric acid into racemic acid, a discovery which Biot quickly communicated to the Academy of Sciences. With Biot’s support, Pasteur was named Chevalier in the Légion d’Honneur in 1853, the first of several ranks he would achieve in this esteemed group. In 1853 he also received a prize from the Society of Pharmacy of Paris for his synthesis of racemic acid. In the following July his report on dimorphism in optically active substances was presented to the Academy of Sciences. With such public achievements he moved to a new post, where the responsibilities provided Pasteur, the son of a tanner, opportunities for applying his laboratory skills to businesses dependent on chemical processes.\n\n4. Applying chemistry to practical problems at Lille (1854–1857)\n\nIn the fall of 1854, Pasteur was appointed Professor of Chemistry and Dean of a new science faculty at Lille, moving there in December. This position led to novel engagements with industrial problems, such as irregularities in producing alcohol from beet roots. The new inquiries initiated a long series of interconnected studies. In December 1856 Pasteur’s earlier contributions to crystallography brought him international recognition with the Royal Society of London’s Rumford Medal. In the summer of 1857, he published a paper on lactic fermentation.\n\nIn less than three years, his accumulating intellectual successes, amplified by these scientific prizes, would earn him a teaching position at the ENS and a coveted move to Paris, the centre of French intellectual and social life, including the world of the fine arts. Before the end of the 1857, he presented two more papers on fermentation to the Academy of Sciences, and the following August, while in Arbois, he examined samples of spoiled wine and found microbes similar to those responsible for lactic fermentation. Insights from the fermentation research further broadened the scope of his work, in time producing revolutionary insights—both intellectual and practical—that took Pasteur from chemistry into biology and then into medicine, with new commercial applications including the process called pasteurization and discoveries that helped save France’s wine and beer industries. In time, Pasteur’s studies of fermentation would also lead to antisepsis and a germ theory of disease.\n\n5. Visual thinking in Pasteur’s crystallography and chemistry\n\nFrom the beginning of my research on art in Pasteur’s life, an obvious question was whether some aspect of his art could be connected with the content of his science or account for his unique insights; and his early work in crystallography seemed promising. Pasteur discovered that a paratartrate salt, assumed to be homogeneous, was actually a physical mixture of two different entities, distinguished by slightly different crystal shapes and by the effect of their solutions on polarized light. Was there perhaps something he took from years of looking and drawing that gave him an advantage here over other chemists? A substantial scholarly literature on scientists and art gives no guidance since those writings focus almost exclusively on the musical aptitude of physical scientists, not on the visual arts. As a rare exception, an article in 1985 by Root-Bernstein did use Pasteur as an example of art’s role in natural science. He focused on the fact that Pasteur’s discovery was centred on the peculiar relationship between two macroscopic shapes of crystals that are ‘mirror images’ of each other. Mirror images are alike in many ways, but one cannot be superposed on the other, just as our hands are similar, but are exactly alike only when one is seen in a mirror. This pattern is today called chirality, and Pasteur’s work with macroscopic crystals led over time to chemists’ understanding that the structures of the unseen molecules are chiral. His single paragraph on Pasteur included the following.\n\nWhat interests me most about Pasteur’s art is that he made his first discovery while looking at the preparation of crystalline tartrates no different from those examined by dozens of his colleagues and mentors. Yet he was the first to see that crystalline tartrates exist not in one form, as they were illustrated in the textbooks of his day, but in three forms: right-handed, left-handed, and symmetrical. His recognition of this fact marks the discovery of enantiomers, or mirror-image forms, in chemicals. The striking feature of the discovery is that the crystalline facets defining the asymmetry are so small as to be almost unnoticeable, except to an eye trained as was Pasteur’s, to perceive detail.Footnote24\n\nNote that Root-Bernstein credited the revolutionary discoveries about tartrate crystals simply to Pasteur’s well-trained eye, a rather general association with art. In 2003 he repeated this connection in another publication: ‘Was it coincidence that the discovery of enantiomorphs was made by […] a professionally trained portrait painter […] taught to observe the tiny asymmetries that characterize every face, human or crystalline?’Footnote25\n\nIn early 2011 I happened to read in Pasteur’s correspondence a letter to his parents that immediately struck me as possible evidence for a more explicit link from his art to his discovery of mirror-image crystals. At age eighteen Pasteur became uncomfortably aware, while drawing a portrait of his friend Charles Chappuis for a lithographic print, that a human face and a mirror image of it do not look the same. Like any print, a lithograph shows a mirror image of what was drawn by the artist’s hand on the plate or the stone, a reversal that the artist must take into account. As the young artist away at school in Besançon explained things to his parents, ‘I want to tell you that yesterday I finished the portrait […] on a lithographic stone. I believe I have never drawn as well nor achieved so good a likeness. All those who have seen it find it striking. […] But I am very much afraid of one thing: that on paper the portrait will not be so good as on the stone. This always happens. So, I have been careful while making it to look at it often in a mirror’Footnote26 (See above).\n\nIn short, his crayon drawing on the lithographic stone matched the face since the artist’s and the viewers’ eyes would all be looking at the same things. But when a paper print was pulled from the stone, the image would be reversed as in a mirror. Since Pasteur wanted the print to look like the subject, he kept using a mirror to view the stone’s surface while he worked on the drawing. While a left-right reversal like this might not be a defect in portraying an abstract image, a fictional landscape, or an object with radial symmetry like a daisy, it would be a problem for someone doing a lithograph of a friend’s face because human faces are not truly symmetrical and their character often resides in their one-sidedness. That the asymmetry of the mouth was a common problem is confirmed by a complaint attributed to John Singer Sargent, an artist renowned for high-society portraits, that a portrait is ‘a likeness in which there is something wrong about the mouth’.Footnote27\n\nIn 2017 the chemist Joseph Gal, an expert on chirality, published his hypothesis of an art-science linkage in Nature Chemistry under the section rubric ‘Thesis’. Citing my three articles about Pasteur and art, he wrote carefully, ‘I suggest that Pasteur’s artistic sensibilities and experience were instrumental in his discovery of molecular chirality and, in particular, his use of lithography is intriguing in this regard’. And also,\n\nIt is clear that the teenage artist was keenly aware of the effects of mirror inversion in 1841, and it follows that the young chemist in 1848 was already sensitized to non-superposable-mirror-image reflection. His prior lithographic work may have thus facilitated his recognition of the chirality of the PTA [paratartaric acid] crystals, that is, that the mirror image was not superposable on the original crystal. Was this the factor that differentiated him from his predecessors who missed this observation? Of course, we cannot be certain, but the history makes for a compelling argument and it is not unreasonable to conclude that his artistic experience may have played an important role in his discovery of molecular chirality.Footnote28\n\nWhen Gal’s idea was reported by the New York Times, his suggestion (‘may have played’) was turned into a firm historical fact: ‘How Pasteur’s Artistic Insight Changed Chemistry’.Footnote29 There is no doubt, of course, that Pasteur changed chemistry. But that his training in art was instrumental has not been established, only hypothesized. Furthermore, despite my own initial excitement on finding the letter about using a mirror to improve his drawing on the stone, I have come to see significant differences between the mirror images of artistic practice and the mirror images of tartrate chemistry. I believe that his lithography gave him an appreciation of mirror images, but it was no better than that of anyone who had made any kind of print or even imagined the process. Surely other chemists of his era knew that prints are a reverse of the artist’s drawing or engraving. And, more importantly, the specific insight or lesson he derived from working on the picture of Chappuis was not about mirror-image symmetry, but about the asymmetry of human faces. What the young lithographer learned is that one side of a face is not an exact mirror image of the other. For this reason, it is not clear how his sensitivity to asymmetry gave him an advantage in discerning two crystals as exactly symmetrical, or mirror, images of each other. Nonetheless, the issue is far from settled and the juncture seems worth further study.\n\n6. In Paris, further discoveries and a revitalized engagement with the fine arts (1857–68)\n\nAlthough only thirty-four when he moved to Paris, his new position at the ENS provided Pasteur the income and status to facilitate an even more intense work schedule and an astonishing run of scientific advances, some of them truly revolutionary. He also enjoyed more accolades from the scientific community and a growing recognition by people outside of science, including the Emperor and Empress. His earlier work on fermentation was extended, and he showed that minute organisms were the cause of fermentations, not the result of it. He took on the industrial problem of spoiled wines. He publicly refuted the arguments supporting spontaneous generation. He brought improvements to commercial vinegar production. He successfully met the Emperor’s personal challenge to rescue the French wine industry, and as a result he was asked—even though he was not a biologist—to study silk worms. He then came to be regarded as a saviour by a second major French industry.\n\nThose achievements are well known. The overlooked story is how, after his return to the capital city, Pasteur built a new circle of acquaintances, primarily within the community of professional artists. Not weekend painters, these men made a living from their art, held government art posts, directed the major institutions, and achieved national and international renown. His friends were conservatives in art. They were leaders of the establishment. A number of these artists socialized with his family; they were the friends with whom he relaxed in private. In November 1863 Pasteur also accepted an appointment as the first professor of geology, physics, and chemistry at the École des Beaux-Arts (EBA), while continuing to hold his position at the ENS. His four years there included re-engaging with artistic practices and studying the chemistry of paints and varnishes; but it was also the beginning of lasting friendships with art students and colleagues alike. He was not treated as an outsider at the EBA, but warmly drawn into working relationships with a variety of artists, many of whose names are still familiar. Eugène Viollet-le-Duc (1814–1879), well known for his work on Notre Dame, arrived to teach aesthetics and history at the same time as Pasteur. Continuing appointments in painting were Jean-Hippolyte Flandrin (1809–1864), Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (1780–1867), and Léon Gérôme (1824–1904). The school’s director was Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury (1797–1890), with whom Pasteur conversed at length to learn more about painting.Footnote30 In 1864, Robert-Fleury left for the French Academy in Rome, and Eugène Guillaume took over as director of the EBA. He, too, became a long-term friend, as did his successors, Paul Dubois and Léon Bonnat.\n\nThe four years during which Pasteur taught young artists and associated with their mentors added new dimensions to his enduring passion for art and artists. Yet book-length studies on Pasteur have assigned no significance at all to his time at the EBA, passing it over with a bare mention or treating it as a lark or a mistake. In the comprehensive books by Vallery-Radot, Dubos, Geison, and Debré, one finds no curiosity about it. Dubos’s graceful biography is temperamentally open to extra-scientific dimensions of Pasteur’s life and work, but it allots Pasteur’s time at the EBA only a few sentences. Geison’s sixty-six-page article in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography covers Pasteur’s activities at the EBA in a single sentence.Footnote31 And while Debré devoted about a page to the subject, he was remarkably dismissive: ‘It is true that Pasteur had executed a few nice-looking pastels in his youth, but he had done nothing of the kind since, or even shown any particular interest in the arts. […] Did these young art students really listen […]? One may doubt it. […] There is little point in wondering who was the first to become tired of the other, the students or the teachers. At any rate, Pasteur did not continue this pedagogical experiment, for which he was hardly suited’.Footnote32 Prior to my own research, it was only within a few early articles by Wrotnowska that aspects of Pasteur’s time at the EBA were given serious attention.Footnote33\n\nOne indication that Pasteur’s time at the EBA was no mere ‘pedagogical experiment’, or a minor episode in his life, is that from the time he met them until his death in 1895 Pasteur was personally close with all three men who directed the school between 1864 and 1922: Guillaume, Dubois, and Bonnat. Pasteur felt at home with the traditional, academic-style art in the EBA of the 1860s in another way too. By personality, he sought clarity and balance. This was a well-recognized characteristic of his approach to science, both in the experimental collection of evidence and in his theories of physiological and chemical structures and processes. In art, too, both in what he made and in others’ work, he expected to see beauty, harmony, and due proportion. As his lifelong friend Charles Chappuis observed much later in a published eulogy, ‘In our museums, what he preferred are the works which express a feeling, and which have the merit of elegance and grace’.Footnote34 Sharing these loyalties, Pasteur and the artists he liked were the conservatives, whose love of clarity and grace in art was being challenged by the Impressionists, who were open to uncertainty in nature and in art, and the realists, who did not require grace or beauty in their subjects (but often produced it in their canvases). As we see below, Pasteur and his painters were sometimes willing to encourage new, ‘modern’ subjects for painting, while at the same time adhering to traditional modes of presenting them.\n\nIn lecturing to the artists and architects, Pasteur employed experiments and physical demonstrations. For lectures he drew upon the physics and chemistry he knew well, such as for ventilation in buildings. For others, he filled gaps in his knowledge of art by studying classic works like Vasari on the history of pigments and the vehicles used to carry them. He experimented with the drying of different oil paints, with the order in which pigments were applied, and with varnishes. To prepare lectures, he closely observed a painter at work because he personally had used only drawing media, not oils. Auguste Leloir (1809–1892) painted a portrait of Pasteur’s daughter Cécile, and for eight sittings Pasteur stood behind the artist watching every brush stroke, asking questions, and taking meticulous notes.Footnote35 Pasteur’s lectures were not published at the time, but some are now available in his Oeuvres.Footnote36 An examination of his teaching of art students that might show links with the ideas and experiments of his science is not possible here, but we hope other scholars will take up the question since four mid-career years in the life of one France’s greatest intellectuals is no minor episode. And the lasting influence of these years on his career could not be clearer when we turn to his social relations with artists.\n\n7. New bonds with art students and colleagues (1863–1868)\n\nIn and out of the lecture halls at the EBA, Pasteur made many friends and acquaintances among colleagues and students several of whom were Jurassians, his compatriots from Franche-Comté.Footnote37 Even a few of their stories reveal the richly interconnected networks of mentoring, socializing, patronizing, and shared political commitments. For example, the very promising EBA student Henri Regnault (1843–1871) would have already been acquainted with Pasteur through his father, the internationally recognized physicist and chemist, Victor Regnault. Henri won the Prix de Rome in 1866. When war broke out with Germany, he waived the exemption that came with his prize, enlisted, and died in battle in January 1871. Henri had been a child prodigy, with achievements and great promise recognized before his death at twenty-seven. Pasteur treasured several souvenirs of the young man’s art, including a drawing the boy had made at age seven, which had originally been given by the boy to the chemist Jean-Baptiste Biot. Pasteur also cherished a photograph of Henri’s drawing of Biot on his death bed.Footnote38\n\nOn display in Pasteur’s home in later life were two sculptures by another student he met at the EBA, Antonin Mercié (1845–1916). These pieces were especially cherished because they made visible Pasteur’s anger and sadness for France’s loss of Alsace in the Franco-Prussian War. Mercié entered the EBA about 1865 and won the Prix de Rome in 1868. His sculpture in plaster, Gloria victis, won a prize in the 1874 Salon. This work became quite popular, and bronze versions were made in various sizes. Small reproductions of it were presented by the Académie d’Agriculture to those awarded its Barotte Prize, of which Pasteur was the initial honoree on 1 July 1885. Even apart from the cash prize of 3400 francs for his scientific discoveries about disease, Pasteur had other reasons to appreciate this sculpture group with a winged figure of Hope or Fame carrying off a fallen young hero because Mercié had created it to honour French soldiers killed in the conflict with Germany.Footnote39 And Mercié specifically had in mind Henri Regnault. A second emotionally charged piece by Mercié that Pasteur also owned was entitled Quand même! (‘But still!’ or ‘Against all odds!’). A soldier supported by an Alsatian woman symbolized the idea that the battle to have Alsace returned to France was not over. An image with a similar message by Jean-Jacques Henner (1829–1905) was also part of Pasteur’s personal collection and is discussed below.\n\nWhile teaching at the EBA, Pasteur became acquainted with a student named Félix Élie Régamey (1844–1907), who had entered the school in 1862. Félix Régamey had a successful career with works of caricature and news engravings appearing frequently in magazines like Le Rire and Harper’s Weekly. Lithographs of his charcoal drawing of Pasteur dated 20 April 1886, were often inscribed by Pasteur to his associates.Footnote40\n\nShortly after Pasteur arrived at the EBA, a new director was appointed in 1864, and Pasteur thus became acquainted with Eugène Guillaume (1822–1905), an architect, painter, and sculptor. Their friendship continued for decades. Twenty years after they met, he and Pasteur travelled together in the small party representing France at the 300th anniversary of the University of Edinburgh in April 1884. Pasteur was just then greatly saddened by the death of his beloved mentor J.-B. Dumas, and he was deeply upset that this official trip prevented his attending Dumas’s funeral.Footnote41 In a gesture of consolation for Pasteur’s grief, Guillaume soon made a bust of Dumas and dedicated it to Pasteur; it was exhibited in the 1885 Salon.Footnote42 Pasteur loved to converse with Guillaume about painting and sculpture, and in the late 1880s he would also turn to Guillaume for advice when acquiring statuary for the new Pasteur Institute.Footnote43\n\nProbably the deepest of Pasteur’s friendships that began during his years at the EBA was that with the sculptor, painter, and arts administrator, Paul Dubois (1829–1905). Dubois first entered the EBA in 1858, but soon took off for Italy, where he produced sculptures in a neo-Renaissance style that were exhibited to acclaim at the Salon and purchased by the state. He returned to Paris and the EBA around 1862. He and Pasteur were certainly acquainted by November 1865, when both were among the honoured guests of the Emperor and Empress for a week at the royal chateau of Compiègne. (Pasteur’s friendship with Dubois in the 1870s and 1880s is recounted below.)\n\nOver the same years that Pasteur was teaching at the EBA, the arts of drawing and colouring were coming to occupy a more important place in his laboratory work at the ENS. The new emphasis arose as he shifted from physics and chemistry into biology and natural history, where the images could not be schematic, but needed both accuracy and naturalism. In this requirement he was well served by Peter Lackerbauer (1823–1872), a prolific scientific illustrator of Swiss origin, who also worked with Claude Bernard and other scientists. More than twenty books have plates credited to Lackerbauer.Footnote44 For Pasteur he drew (or perhaps redrew) images of cells as seen in the field of a microscope, and Lackerbauer was one of the pioneers in taking photographs through the microscope. He also produced illustrations, including subtly varied tubes of wine under different conditions, for Pasteur’s Études sur le vin: ses maladies, causes qui les provoquent, procédés nouveaux pour le conserver et pour le vieillir (1866, rev. ed. 1873), and delicate colour images of the life cycle of silk worms for another major publication, Études sur la maladie des vers à soie: moyen pratique assuré de la combattre et d’en prévenir le retour (1870).Footnote45 Both books included Lackerbauer’s printed lithographic plates in colour (See for Pasteur’s notes about adjusting the colour on a proof copy of a plate and for a published plate in the silk worm diseases book). Colour differences are subtle and were very important to Pasteur, the chemist, as well as to Pasteur, the man who had spent six years working with pastels to make realistic drawings in colour.\n\nPlate by Peter Lackerbauer with annotations by Louis Pasteur (1866).

Used with permission.\n\nI have found no recollections, letters, or other evidence about Pasteur’s manner of working with Lackerbauer, but one has to assume it was shoulder-to-shoulder for extended times and probably included an interchange of questions and suggestions. For now, we remain in the dark about whether Pasteur regarded Lackerbauer as a colleague or a technical assistant. But in the books, the plates were always credited with his name.\n\nGiven Pasteur’s substantial personal experience with pastels, the question arises whether some of the working drawings done by Lackerbauer for Pasteur might have been done in this medium in which an artist can control delicate lines and colour shading to a high degree. And another source furnishes a hint that pastel crayons were of concern to Pasteur at just this time. A company history reports that around 1865 Pasteur had meetings with Henri Roché, a chemist and pharmacist, who had completed a thesis in 1862 on minerals in plant physiology. Roché was himself an artist who worked in pastels. The story is told that Roché had been a student of Pasteur and that Pasteur introduced him to the artisans who made the pastel crayons for Maison Macle, a popular seller of art materials, with a suggestion that their product could be improved by a skilful chemist. When applied to paper, pastel pigments were known to be delicate, easily smeared, affected by moisture, and subject to fading. Whether the composition of their pigments and binders could be modified to reduce these problems was a problem suitable for chemists. With the workers at Macle, Roché developed new materials less susceptible to smearing and fading. In time Roché purchased the firm, which continues today in the hands of his family as a prestige source of outstanding crayons in a myriad of colours.Footnote46 Although I have found no documents allowing me to confirm Pasteur’s interaction with Roché or Pasteur’s personal acquaintance with an artisan making pastels for Maison Macle, the story concurs with Pasteur’s interests in art materials and in applying science to commercial products, as well as with his style of networking. The story’s plausibility is enhanced by recalling that at just this time Pasteur was using colourful art that successfully rendered and preserved his laboratory discoveries for a wider public. When we look at how slight the variations in the shades of orange that Pasteur intended to show among the tubes of wine, it is not hard to imagine that he was drawing upon his experience with pastels, first as an artist and then later, as seems possible, as a chemist, discussing their manufacture with workers at Maison Macle and with Henri Roché.\n\nIn late 1867, as his scientific responsibilities continued to grow, Pasteur resigned from the EBA. He had recently received authorization to establish a research laboratory for physiological chemistry at the ENS, and he also assumed teaching responsibility for organic chemistry at the Sorbonne. Although documentation becomes thin for Pasteur’s engagements with art for a few years after he left the EBA, his close relationships with artists became prominent again in the 1870s and continued to be visible to the end of his life.\n\n8. Achievements, recognition, and popular acclaim in France (1868–84)\n\nAn early medical catastrophe at forty-six could have ended Pasteur’s laboratory career when he suffered a paralytic stroke (two more would follow late in his life). He recovered rather well, but he used assistants to handle laboratory procedures and took on a tilted posture that is visible in some images. His revelations about the role of microbes in fermentation and his demonstration that microbes floated virtually everywhere on dust particles in the air led to Joseph Lister’s invention of antiseptic, and eventually aseptic, surgery. Pasteur expanded these insights with further experimental confirmation to argue by analogy from the problems in products like wine, vinegar, and beer to infectious diseases in animals and humans, leading to the modern germ theory of infectious disease. The arguments he made were so powerful and intellectually productive that in 1873 he was elected, though not a physician, to the Academy of Medicine. In 1874, when he was fifty-one, a life-time pension was granted him by the National Assembly. His studies on diseases of silk worms were followed by work on diseases in other animals. His laboratory created vaccines for chicken cholera and for anthrax (a deadly disease of sheep and cattle). These were the first vaccines of any kind since Jenner had given the world its first vaccine, for smallpox, in the 1790s. The work established preventive vaccination as a potential model for preventing many diseases.\n\nThe anthrax vaccine, its efficacy demonstrated in a farmyard experiment open to observers in 1881, would yield enormous economic savings for French farmers—comparable in magnitude, it was said, to the reparations France paid to Germany after the Franco-Prussian War. Pasteur’s work on the causes of failure in beer production led to new procedures with superior outcomes, including the use of specific, pure strains of brewer’s yeast. He touted his improvements as a ‘beer of revenge’ against the German invasion. And one brewer, T. C. Jacobsen in Copenhagen, so deeply valued the new methods that he established a research laboratory for his brewery at Carlsberg, a notable first. Jacobsen and Pasteur became friends, and Jacobsen honoured the friendship by commissioning portraits of Pasteur. Such gestures of gratitude were genuinely appreciated by Pasteur, who also used those portraits to enhance his public reputation, largely though the annual Salon, the main event in the art world of this era.\n\nThe Paris Salon was the single most important exhibition of contemporary art for most of the nineteenth century, and it was at the peak of its influence in Pasteur’s era. It was also the setting for much of his personal engagement with the art world. The exhibition lasted a month or two in May and June. Submissions were selected competitively by a jury, and medals and honourable mentions were given to a select few. In the 1870s, works exhibited might number as many as five thousand. Attendance could approach ten thousand visitors a day over a typical six-week run. Paintings were hung ‘salon-style’ from floor to ceiling, leading artists to fear having a painting ‘skied’ where it could not easily be viewed. Each exhibition prompted countless guidebooks, reviews, and illustrations in newspapers and magazines. We know that Pasteur closely followed Salon criticism. For example, he wrote from Arbois to his friend Henner in August 1876 regarding a good review. ‘My son had great pleasure in bringing me […] the criticism of M. Claretie, a review that I like for judgments so favourable and so true, as he always is about you’.Footnote47 Pasteur also lobbied for positive reviews, good placements on the wall, and wording he wished to have in an artist’s official catalogue entry. Such efforts as these are historically important not only to show his personal commitment to the success of artist friends, but also because they must have shaped his understanding of how appearances in the popular media could be used by an artist—or even by a scientist—to secure his standing and his access to resources. At this point in time, news in the daily press did not follow the latest science or medicine in the way that it reported on art exhibits, works purchased by the state or wealthy patrons, and artistic controversies. This would change for science within a decade, and Pasteur would be in the centre of it all.\n\nBy the 1870s, Pasteur’s reputation was secure in France and growing abroad as well. His work had been recognized with numerous medals and prizes. Funding for his laboratory was a substantial fraction of the entire nation’s expenditures on science. He was a busy man—and an important one, with friends at the highest levels of power and public affairs, including Napoleon III and the Empress Eugénie. Pasteur still maintained an almost obsessed devotion to his work. At just this time, nonetheless, he gave art and his artist friends even more attention than earlier. As one observer recorded at the time of Pasteur’s death, ‘a good deal of that leisure which he so grudgingly allowed himself was spent in the galleries of the Luxembourg [Palace]’.Footnote48\n\nEarly in the 1870s, Pasteur commissioned two unusual stained-glass windows to display in his working space at the ENS (See and ). They were made by Gaspard Gsell (often Gaspar, 1814–1904), a successful artist, responsible for colourful windows in dozens of churches. Gaspard was married to Adèle Laurent, a first cousin of Pasteur’s wife Marie. There were many artists in the family into which Pasteur had married, and we even have a skilful drawing of Marie made by Adèle about 1854.Footnote49 (As discussed below, the oldest of their five sons, Lucien Laurent-Gsell, would create several important portrayals of Pasteur in the 1880s and 1890s, and his brother Paul would publish an article about Pasteur near the end of his life.) We must assume Pasteur’s ideas were key to the designs for a central painted image in monochrome, which is surrounded by brightly coloured pieces that are set into a mostly-uncoloured geometric background pattern. The left-hand window features a female figure in classical robes, an allegory of chemistry, holding a flask up to the light, with an alchemical oven on one side, a book on the other, and a mortar with pestle at her feet. The other window features a portrait of Pasteur’s teenage daughter Marie-Louise, wearing the uniform of her boarding school, a figure which appears to be closely based on a photograph.Footnote50 These two windows are visible in a later image by Émile Bayard (1837–1891) of Pasteur’s work space at the ENS in 1886, when rabies patients were being treated there.Footnote51 After Pasteur’s retirement, the windows would be moved to the petit-salon of his new apartment. Several aspects of this commission are striking. First, these were made for display in his office, when he was director of scientific studies at the ENS, hence a statement to colleagues and students of his personal engagement with the fine arts. While the allegorical representation of chemistry is an obvious choice, pairing an emblematic woman with a hyper-realistic school girl seems odd. I am unable to explain it. But, whatever the personal meaning of the windows, Pasteur chose large pieces of contemporary art to express himself in a semi-public way.\n\nAllegory of chemistry.

Used with permission.\n\nDuring the creation of another commission, Pasteur attended most of his daughter’s sittings for her portrait by Henner in 1876 because he enjoyed chatting with this artist, whom he called ‘a charming man, gentle, modest, very fine, and distinguished’.Footnote52 One day when Pasteur could not go, his wife carried his personal note to Henner, apologizing for his absence and joking that ‘it is necessary to show a little indulgence to a man who spends his life looking into the microscope’.Footnote53 In addition to portraits of his daughter and daughter-in-law, Henner also painted Pasteur.Footnote54 Henner became a close family associate, welcomed with his family of six to visit Pasteur in Arbois. In Paris Pasteur often invited Henner to an informal dinner at home, ‘sans cérémonie’.Footnote55 After Henner’s home province of Alsace was lost to Prussia, he painted a personification of the region as a young woman in traditional mourning costume, entitled L’Alsace: Elle attend. The image was widely reproduced as a symbol of the region’s suffering, and Pasteur kept a print on the wall of his study.Footnote56\n\nHenner and Pasteur sometimes attended the Salon together. In early June of 1877, for example, Pasteur wrote Henner: ‘My wife and daughter and I accept with much gratitude your offer of a visit to the Salon next week. […] If you wish, we will meet you on Thursday morning at nine o’clock. […] We have been following with great interest the accounts of the Salon, and we congratulate you most sincerely for the unanimous praise your two beautiful works have received’.Footnote57 This was a weekday morning, when Pasteur might have been at work. Upon returning from the Universal Exposition in July 1878, where Henner’s work had not received due honours, Pasteur sent a note to console his friend. In the same note, Pasteur mentioned encountering at this exhibition their mutual friend, Auguste Pointelin (1839–1933), a landscape painter from Arbois, who supported himself as a mathematics instructor.Footnote58 Pasteur aided this man’s dual career on several occasions. On Pasteur’s recommendation, Pointelin’s painting of an autumn scene in the Jura, which won a medal in the 1876 Salon, was purchased by the state.Footnote59 On 4 July 1876, the Pasteurs hosted a festive dinner to celebrate Pointelin’s success. With Pasteur’s influence, Pointelin was eventually able to leave a provincial post and become a teacher of mathematics at a lycée in Paris in 1878. Pasteur enjoyed visiting Pointelin’s studio. Pointelin often visited the Pasteur house in Arbois, where works of his were on the wall. In the apartment within the Pasteur Institute where Pasteur moved in 1888, two peaceful landscapes by Pointelin were in the living room.Footnote60\n\nIn November 1876, Pasteur was at the Paris home of another friend from the Jura, the sculptor Jean-Joseph Perraud (1819–1876). Perraud’s bust of Pasteur was exhibited a few months earlier at the Salon. Perraud had a successful career, including election to the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1865. Perraud had just died, and another leading artist and mutual friend, William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825–1905), was also present. Pasteur wrote a note summoning their friend Henner. Pasteur’s thinking was that of an artist. ‘Come to see Perraud before his features change. He is beautiful like a Christ’.Footnote61 Notably, both Henner and Bouguereau had themselves made paintings of the dead Christ, two of which were on exhibit that very year.\n\nSeveral letters Pasteur wrote following Perraud’s death reveal his deep involvement in the work of his artist friends, such as two notes about Perraud to the art critic Charles Blanc.Footnote62 For the sculptor Paul Dubois, who would make busts of Pasteur in 1879 and 1889, he enclosed a copy of the eulogy he gave at Perraud’s funeral.Footnote63 Pasteur’s speech expressed his connection with Perraud and the many artists in their overlapping circles of friendship, thereby positioning himself rhetorically as a member in the community of artists.Footnote64\n\nAbout seven years later, Pasteur gave a less formal and more emotional speech at the installation of a monument to Perraud in Monay, the town of his birth. The Monay monument is a bronze bust by Perraud’s student Max Claudet (1840–1893). The town is just a day trip from Arbois, and it seems likely that Pasteur’s son-in-law, René Vallery-Radot, accompanied him since his account mixes paraphrase with what seem like Pasteur’s own words. ‘One of the final examples of the art works that [Perraud had] sent to Paris from […] Rome as evidence of his productivity on the fellowship was a bas-relief entitled Adieux. He preferred this work, perhaps, to all his others. With noble and pure lines and with fine modelling, it emanates moral grandeur, the deep emotion which is had by the true artists’. Such phrases are characteristic of Pasteur’s understanding of art: ‘noble and pure lines’, ‘moral grandeur’, ‘the true artists’.Footnote65\n\nClaudet, another compatriot of Franche-Comté, who created the memorial bust for the monument to his teacher Perraud, was a sculptor and ceramist, whose works frequently appeared in the Salon. He was famous for colourful sculptures and useful objects with figures in relief.Footnote66 Out of personal affection, he made for Madame Pasteur and her granddaughter individual ceramic candy boxes with their names inscribed. In 1883 he produced two large platters (58 cm across) celebrating Pasteur’s achievements, with several discoveries and honours inscribed in the glaze.Footnote67 One of these has a portrait of Pasteur in relief in the centre. In his thank-you note, Pasteur indulged in a pun and some playful self-mockery, writing ‘Your plates are quite successful. To tell the truth, I think I am less forbidding and hard than you have made me, but perhaps my debates at the academies have given me a reputation that is in harmony with your design’.Footnote68\n\nPasteur was always happy to support artist friends, especially those whose success might serve his own agenda. He also requested favours of them. His relationship with Paul Dubois was both personal and professional. Dubois was present at the dinner Pasteur hosted in Perraud’s honour in 1876, and he was one of the friends to whom Pasteur wrote a note right after Perraud’s funeral. We know he was invited to an informal dinner with Henner at Pasteur’s house in late May 1880, when the Salon was showing Dubois’s recently completed bust of Pasteur.Footnote69 Dubois rose to the top of the Paris art world, becoming keeper of the Musée du Luxembourg in 1873, succeeding to Perraud’s chair as a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1876, and becoming director of the EBA in 1878.Footnote70 These positions, like those of most of Pasteur’s close friends in the arts, illustrate the leading roles they played in an establishment in which Pasteur felt comfortable. For them, as for him, their politics was conservative, as was their taste in art.\n\nIn September 1878 Pasteur gave approval for Dubois to accept a portrait-bust commission from J. C. Jacobsen, the wealthy Danish industrialist who had founded the Carlsberg Brewery in 1844 and established a research laboratory there in 1875. The bust was completed in 1879 and exhibited in the 1880 Salon. In advance of the Salon, Pasteur made efforts to ensure that Dubois’s piece would be well received and also that Jacobsen would get due credit, thereby enhancing Pasteur’s own reputation. He left nothing to chance. Pasteur wrote to Dubois about a description for the official catalogue. ‘How are you going to designate the bust in the Salon catalogue? My idea is that you could honour M. Jacobsen by writing: Bust of Monsieur Pasteur. Commissioned by Monsieur Jacobsen for his laboratory at Carlsberg, just outside the city of Copenhagen, or something equivalent’.Footnote71 Anxious to ensure that the bust would receive favourable mention in the Parisian press, Pasteur asked his son-in-law, René Vallery-Radot, to intervene with a Salon critic, Paul Mantz, at the newspaper Le Temps. ‘I would like the name of Monsieur Jacobsen to be glorified alongside that of Paul Dubois. […] It would be very desirable that in speaking of Paul Dubois’s work, M. Mantz would relate a few lines about the bust’s origin to indicate the enlightened generosity of this rich industrialist, who is giving one and a half million francs for the construction of a laboratory dedicated to the advancement of the brewer’s art. […] When Paul Mantz’s notice appears, please let me know in which issue so that I can send it to M. Jacobsen’Footnote72 (See ).\n\nBronze replica of the 1879 bust of Pasteur by Paul Dubois, on a wall of the Carlsberg Brewery, Copenhagen. Author photograph, 2015.\n\n9. Saving lives and shaping a reputation part 1: the scientist (1884–88)\n\nThe second half of the 1880s saw Pasteur rise from French hero to world-wide celebrity. The first years of the decade brought him both turbulence and transformation. Pasteur’s sister died, and his first grandchild, Camille Vallery-Radot was born. He threatened to resign from the Academy of Medicine. He was challenged to a duel by Dr Jules Guérin and managed to avoid it by a public apology. He began work on rabies. In 1881, he performed a controlled trial of his anthrax vaccine in Pouilly-le-Fort, an event which in fact received very limited coverage in the press at the time—even though some later accounts have wrongly claimed that it received substantial publicity in newspapers orchestrated by Pasteur himself. My research suggests that this picture is simply wrong and that it was only with the rabies treatments in 1885 that Pasteur was regularly featured in the daily press and became a household name.Footnote73 Pasteur was honoured by Joseph Lister and others at the 1881 International Medical Congress in London. In 1881 he was also elected to the French Academy as one of its ‘forty immortals’. The French government, which had awarded him in 1874 a lifetime pension of 12,000 francs, increased the annual payment to 25,000 francs in 1883, transferable upon his death to his wife and then to his children.Footnote74\n\nIn August 1884 at the international medical congress in Copenhagen, Pasteur spoke about his experiments on vaccination for hydrophobia and his success in making dogs refractory to a new exposure with rabies virus. For Pasteur and his family, the trip was enhanced by special accommodation from the Jacobsen brewers, including hotel rooms and hired carriage, special dinners, laboratory tour, and a visit to the Thorvaldsen art museum.Footnote75 Pasteur and the Jacobsens alike took advantage of this international congress to spotlight their personal accomplishments. Pasteur attended the meeting as an official representative of France. Jacobsen and his son Carl provided gracious hospitality to all the attendees, and they were especially generous to Pasteur and his family. In a letter to his colleague Henri-Marie Bouley, Pasteur boastfully described some of the ways that both art and science were marshalled by the Jacobsens in their public appreciation for Pasteur.\n\nAt Carlsberg, a half hour from Copenhagen, are found his magnificent brewery, his house filled with objets d’art, and a laboratory to cause envy among all of us chemists. It contains no less than two thousand ballons Pasteur [flasks for cultivating microbes in broth], everything practical for the study and conservation of yeasts. One reaches it by a Rue Pasteur, and in the hall of the library stands the superb bust by Paul Dubois. Right next to the brewery is a facility for the export of beer, which is pasteurized there with extreme care. At the entrance from the Chemin Pasteur, his son, a leading brewer himself, has erected the same bust by Paul Dubois (in bronze) outside the building under a small pediment supported by two columns in green marble.Footnote76\n\nOn the Carlsberg campus the scientific and the artistic had become inseparable, just as in Pasteur’s own life (See above). During most of 1885, Pasteur and his colleagues kept their continuing rabies work to themselves. Then a desperate patient from Alsace was brought to their laboratory in early July, a humble nine-year-old named Joseph Meister facing almost certain death. Pasteur could not treat patients, but Dr Jacques-Joseph Grancher, a successful paediatrician, stepped in. In time, the names Meister and Grancher would become well known and their images printed in newspapers far beyond the borders of France. But not at first. Although Meister’s daily treatments ran from 6 July to 16 July without a mishap, he might have succumbed later. Only on 26 October did Pasteur go public about this case at a meeting of the Academy of Sciences. This address to other scientists about the experimental treatment of a single patient was not newsworthy even in Paris.\n\nDuring October, Pasteur and Grancher had begun quietly treating a second patient, this time a sixteen-year-old shepherd from the village of Villers-Farlay, near Arbois. Jean Baptiste Jupille had been bitten while using his bare hands to subdue and kill a mad dog that threatened smaller children. Unlike the secrecy around the first patient, Pasteur himself described Jupille’s personal heroism at the Academy of Sciences, where a colleague quickly suggested that the French Academy should honour Jupille with its Montyon Prize of one thousand francs for exceptional bravery by an ordinary French citizen. This honour prompted some modest newspaper coverage of the Pasteur rabies treatment within France.\n\nBut everything about Pasteur’s rabies work would change in December due to an incident in the United States. A stray dog in Newark, New Jersey, near New York City, bit other dogs and several children. A doctor delivered his letter to a local newspaper saying a cure for rabies was to be had in Paris and, if the children were poor, the public should raise funds to send them. Within less than a day, $4.30 was brought to the doctor’s office by local factory workers. After this gesture was reported in the New York City papers, rich and poor alike sent in thousands of donations. The stories were reprinted in papers across the US and Canada. Four children soon sailed to Europe for treatment in Pasteur’s laboratory. Newspapers and magazines featured Pasteur in news stories, human-interest stories, science reports, and editorials, plus cartoons of politics, social satire, and humour. An image of Pasteur watching Dr Grancher give an injection to Jupille turned the shepherd boy into an international celebrity (See ). Although the initial impetus for the press fervour was an American event, the Pasteur treatment as a media sensation soon spread to Europe and even into South America and over to Russia.Footnote77\n\nJean-Baptiste Jupille receiving treatment from Dr. Joseph Grancher under Pasteur’s watchful eye. ‘An Inoculation for Hydrophobia—From L’Illustration’, Harper’s Weekly 29:1513 (19 December 1885).

Used with permission.\n\nPasteur gave explanations to members of the press all winter. Because his laboratory was being overrun by patients, families, onlookers, and reporters, he proposed establishing a therapeutic institute to deliver the new treatment. On 1 March 1886, the Academy of Sciences established a committee to manage donations. The injections were depicted in both fine art and popular graphics. In mid-March, Russian patients arrived with beards, big hats, and heavy overcoats that offered just what the media valued for exotic illustrations to boost circulation.Footnote78\n\n10. Saving lives and shaping a reputation part 2: the man in the paintings (1884–88)\n\nDuring this same winter and spring, artists were readying submissions for the annual Salon to open on 1 May. Formal portraits of Pasteur had already been exhibited in Salons. But the 1886 Salon would be very different for Pasteur—and for science in general. He would appear in three paintings, one traditional portrait (by Léon Bonnat) and two highly innovative scenes (by Albert Edelfelt and Lucien Laurent-Gsell).\n\nTo understand the significance of these paintings we need to trace Pasteur’s relations with these painters over the prior twelve months. Albert Edelfelt (1854–1905) had met Pasteur’s son Jean-Baptiste when he favourably reviewed Edelfelt’s work in the 1880 Salon. Through Jean-Baptiste, Edelfelt was introduced to the Pasteurs and in time became part of the family circle. Over time, he painted portraits of Jean-Baptiste, his wife, his sister’s husband René Vallery-Radot, his niece Camille, and his mother, Madame Pasteur.\n\nIn April 1885 Edelfelt began work on a large portrait (154 × 126 cm) with Pasteur’s enthusiastic cooperation, as revealed in the frequent letters that Edelfelt sent his mother.Footnote79 ‘Monday, I will again go to see the old fellow Pasteur to see if it is possible to make something of him in the laboratory because it is only there, in that environment, that I want to paint him. The old fellow Pasteur in tails and high collar is something ridiculous’.Footnote80 Pasteur took the young artist into his confidence. ‘Last Monday I visited the old man in his laboratory and he showed me everything there, explained all his experiments, etc. He spent at least an hour’s time with me and was as warm as possible. […] Pasteur is on the brink of making the biggest discovery he has done in his lifetime: to find a vaccine for rabies. All his experiments on animals have succeeded. Now the question is to see whether he will succeed with humans’.Footnote81 They chatted about Pasteur’s early experience as an artist. ‘He was kind and promised that I would not be disappointed with him as a model’. Pasteur made a generous offer. ‘He promised to sit for me three afternoons a week and, if necessary, to give me a fourth, Thursday, which he usually spends at the Académie française’.Footnote82 The composition that Edelfelt developed shows Pasteur staring at the contents of a bottle. Pasteur had intervened in the composition. ‘He made me take away a microbottle, and he put into my hand instead a larger glass dome with a piece of […] bone marrow dangling from a thread. According to the old man, this would be something that is not fully understood yet, but would have great importance in the future’Footnote83 (See ).\n\nAlbert Edelfelt, Louis Pasteur (1885), Musée d’Orsay, Paris.

Non-commercial use permitted.\n\nEdelfelt completed the painting before returning to Finland for the summer. Two things about the situation while the painting was being done must be noted because the image will take on a different meaning later, due to the entirely unforeseen events in the fall, namely wide publicity about Pasteur’s treatments of Meister, Jupille, and hundreds of other dog-bite victims. Thereafter, people will see it only in terms of those events. First, in May and June while the painting was being done, Pasteur had vaccinated only dogs. He had not dared to try saving a person from rabies. Second, these dog experiments were then of scientific note, but they had no interest for the general public. That means Edelfelt and Pasteur both believed this was to be a portrait of a scientist at work, an eminent scientist to be sure, but not of what he would become—a popular miracle worker who had changed the course of medicine and was worshipped by thousands of victims saved from possible death. In the spring of 1885 when Edelfelt was painting his canvas, the matter in the drying bottle was a laboratory reagent, not a life-saving therapy. It is a testament to Pasteur’s brash self-confidence that he wanted Edelfelt to portray the unfinished rabies work, rather than any of his established triumphs.\n\nIn November 1885, a very famous portraitist, Léon Bonnat (1833–1922), was about to start his own canvas of Pasteur on commission from J. C. Jacobsen. Meanwhile the initial trickle of dog-bite victims coming to Pasteur’s laboratory for treatment was turning into a rushing stream and then a torrent. By 15 December, there were one hundred patients. By 15 February, two hundred. And by 15 April, just two weeks before the opening day of the 1886 Salon, the total had climbed to 688.Footnote84 This wave of rabies publicity would make Edelfelt’s painting noteworthy, even apart from aesthetic considerations. In contrast, although Bonnat’s canvas was painted while Pasteur’s name was grabbing headlines, Bonnat intentionally left science and medicine out of his picture, which features Pasteur’s granddaughter to emphasize the man, not the scientistFootnote85 (See ).\n\nPhotogravure of painting by Léon Bonnat, Louis Pasteur with Granddaughter (1886), published as image 155 in Das neunzehnte Jahrhundert in Bildnissen, 5 vols. (Berlin: Photographische Gesellschaft, 1898–1901). Author’s collection.\n\nCritics inevitably compared Bonnat’s canvas to Edelfelt’s, which was generally considered superior. According to one review of Edelfelt, ‘This portrait is complete. It speaks of the man and his life’s work. And it could well be the definitive portrait of Pasteur’.Footnote86 Many reviewers noted that showing Pasteur at work enabled Edelfelt to embody Pasteur’s special genius. For example, ‘The illustrious scientist is working in his laboratory. […] This is definitely not the Pasteur of official paintings. […] No, he is the simple and gentle scientist, pre-eminently good, surprised in the intimacy of his work’.Footnote87 The critical reaction to Edelfelt’s work must have pleased Pasteur, ‘the simple and gentle scientist’, and he took an initiative. Half-way through the Salon’s run, René Goblet, the minister of public instruction, came to breakfast at Pasteur’s house to discuss the Légion d’Honneur for Edelfelt, who was made Chevalier the following year.\n\nMany Salon reviewers in 1886—and probably many Salon visitors too—noticed only the Bonnat and Edelfelt portraits of Pasteur, overlooking a canvas by Lucien Laurent-Gsell (1860–1944) titled Le laboratoire de M. Pasteur. This painting is not a portrait, but a presentation of the laboratory as a working space. Pasteur and his assistants are all in the back, and their presence is subordinated to the equipment, the furniture, and the ambience of light and space.Footnote88 Critic Paul Leroi gave this modest but effective canvas a strong review, calling it ‘a complete success’Footnote89 (See ). Though young, Laurent-Gsell had been exhibiting in the Salon since 1882, having studied with Alexandre Cabanel. Lucien was related through marriage to Pasteur, his mother a cousin of Madame Pasteur (née Marie Laurent). Like his ‘uncle’ Louis, he felt a dual devotion to both art and science. He earned the bachelor’s degree in science. Then he left science to study art at the EBA. His father, as noted above, was Gaspard Gsell from whom Pasteur had commissioned two stained-glass windows. Pasteur encouraged the young man, including him in a ‘dinner of artists’, at his house, on 31 May 1880, with Henner, Dubois, and others.Footnote90 In 1881, visiting her nephew, Madame Pasteur apparently made the suggestion that he should paint something about Pasteur’s work.Footnote91\n\nLucien Laurent-Gsell, The Laboratory of Louis Pasteur (1886), oil on canvas, 91 × 78 cm. Collection Musée de Vannes, France. Used with permission.\n\nPasteur was happy to have his cultural status confirmed by appearing in three well-reviewed works in the Salon of 1886. Yet, in these three images Pasteur was still a chemist uncovering nature’s secrets—even as the fast-moving press in the spring of 1886 was transforming him into a healer. In the next Salon, Pasteur would bear the mantle of a healer in a new and far more ambitious canvas by Laurent-Gsell. A large, busy scene, La vaccine de la rage (250 by 290 cm) was a dramatic contrast to the same artist’s quiet chemical laboratory of the prior year. The chemist is now in the foreground, paired with a white-robed Berber. Together they frame a woman holding a squirming child for inoculation by Dr Grancher. The many foreign patients made Pasteur proud by demonstrating the international leadership of French science. Many salonniers gave this canvas warm praise. For example, Paul Leroi called it ‘one of the best works at the Salon, one which will surely be remembered’Footnote92 (See ).\n\nLucien Laurent-Gsell, La vaccine de la rage au laboratoire de M. Pasteur (1887), oil on canvas, 250 × 290 cm. At the time, this spelling was often used instead of le vaccin. The original canvas on public display at the Institut de Parasitologie et de Pathologie Tropicale of the University of Strasbourg bears on its frame: Le laboratoire de Pasteur. Early salon catalogues mistakenly listed it as Le premier septembre. Author photograph, 2013.\n\nUnknown to the public—and to historians until now—this painting faced a major threat of suppression by Pasteur himself shortly before its debut. The assault is detailed in a newly discovered document, one of the many letters in Pasteur’s hand that continue to appear on the auction market. This one was offered for sale in 2015.Footnote93 What it reveals about Pasteur’s approach to perceived offenses is characteristic, if rather dispiriting. From December 1886 through February 1887, just when this artist was finishing many months of work on the painting, Pasteur was on a rest vacation with his family, guests at a luxury villa in Bordighera, Italy, not far from Nice. At the very same time, medical opponents to his rabies work were challenging it in sessions of the Academy of Medicine in Paris and publishing attacks on it from Vienna. Grancher, Duclaux, and Roux were leading his defence, and Pasteur exchanged letters with them almost daily.Footnote94 Apparently in one of his letters at this stressful time, Grancher mentioned to Pasteur a concern about the painting, which he had seen in Laurent-Gsell’s studio when he sat to pose for it. Pasteur was shocked by what he read and jumped into action, dispatching an angry note to Lucien Laurent-Gsell on 9 February firmly demanding that the painting not be exhibited in the upcoming Salon. (On the very same day, he fired off a letter to a Naples newspaper, which had printed something in support of an Austrian doctor who found the rabies treatments wanting.Footnote95) To the young painter Pasteur wrote, ‘I know that you have done a painting representing a session of the anti-rabies vaccination. […] Dr Grancher […] has seen it. We wish and urgently beg you not to display this painting, at least not this year; and if it must be displayed later […], this must not happen without a decisive change. The inoculated child’s situation is completely contrary to reality and even blameworthy from various perspectives. […] What I am asking will perhaps offend, but I absolutely insist. If necessary, I will intervene personally and officially to prevent its exhibition’. Pasteur was apparently concerned that the child was ‘needlessly’ shown naked. (The belly of patients had to be exposed for these injections.)\n\nThis pre-emptive demand to suppress a large painting that embodied a full year’s labour and had been judged outstanding by the young artist’s famous teacher Cabanel caused turmoil within the family. Each of the artist’s parents wrote a personal letter to Pasteur. On 17 February, the artist himself wrote to Pasteur defending the propriety of his work while also stating that the child was now covered head to toe.Footnote96 Fortunately, the painting was accepted into the Salon, earning Honourable Mention and reviewers’ praise. A lithograph by Eugène Pirodon was published in 1887. The canvas was purchased at the Salon by the French government and resides today at the bacteriology institute of the university in Strasbourg.Footnote97\n\nTwo sculptures calling attention to Pasteur’s triumph over rabies were in the 1887 Salon as well. Both presented the mad dog being subdued by Jean Baptiste Jupille, Pasteur’s second patient. The Shepherd Jupille was an action sculpture by Émile-Louis Truffot (1843–1895). It is possible that Pasteur and Truffot had met two decades earlier as Truffot had entered the EBA in 1862, the year before Pasteur arrived. The plaster version at the 1887 Salon was purchased by the French state. To prepare a larger version in bronze commissioned by Pasteur for the Institute that would be opening in 1888, the artist requested a photograph of Jupille to give it more resemblance to Jupille himself. Pasteur met with Truffot and gave him a photographFootnote98 (See ). A second sculpture group, The Shepherd Jupille Struggling with a Mad Dog, was made by Athanase Fossé (1851–1923); a photograph appeared on the cover of a popular weekly in late 1889, La France illustrée.Footnote99\n\nJean-Baptiste Jupille, the second person to receive the Pasteur treatment for rabies, photographed many years later, in his uniform as a guard at the Pasteur Institute and posing in the Institute’s garden with the sculpture by Émile Louis Truffot (1887) that commemorates his struggle with a mad dog.

Used with permission.\n\nIf artistic realizations of the rabies success were firm and lasting, Pasteur’s personal triumph in the 1887 Salon was diminished by a paralytic stroke, his second, in October. He recovered, but this year saw the end of his scientific work. His final entry in the long series of laboratory notebooks was in Cahier 95, dated 2 August 1887.Footnote100 Although retired from research, Pasteur did not vanish from the world of science or the world of art, and his presence in both grew along with the new Institute. He took an active role, not only guiding the construction of the Institute but also acting as artistic impresario, planning for the display of art works, both in the common areas and in his private apartment there.\n\nIn late 1887, Pasteur was also in contact again with his Danish friend and patron, the wealthy beer magnate Carl Jacobsen. Pasteur wrote to thank him for sending two casts he had requested of the bust by Paul Dubois that Jacobsen’s father had commissioned back in 1878. Of the bust, Pasteur remarked that ‘along with the portrait in oil by Edelfelt, I know of no better likeness or anything of better execution’.Footnote101 Pasteur’s appreciation for the Jacobsens’ friendship and support was deep and genuine. Five years later, on the occasion of his own seventieth birthday, Pasteur wrote to Carl Jacobsen that, since there was no work by Perraud among the French pieces in his Copenhagen art museum, Pasteur was giving him an especially treasured work of art, Perraud’s maquette of Adieux that he had personally received from Perraud.Footnote102\n\nIn early 1888, despite his increasing frailty, Pasteur sat patiently for a portrait by Carolus-Duran (1837–1917). The modest-sized painting is now in the historic apartment in the Institute. The apartment also displays a much larger painted portrait of Lazzaro Spallanzani, an acknowledged eighteenth-century predecessor in the fight against spontaneous generation. Some time before 1888, Pasteur commissioned this canvas from Albert-Jules Édouard (1845–1919), an artist he may well have met in the 1860s when Édouard was a student at the EBA. This painting faces Edelfelt’s life-size image of Pasteur in the dining room.Footnote103\n\n11. Honoured in retirement, and still managing art and artists (1888–1894)\n\nDuring the summer and fall of 1888, Pasteur involved himself in the final arrangements prior to the Institute’s November inauguration. Pasteur was securing busts of major donors to the institute for prominent placement in the library and reception rooms.Footnote104 In this enterprise he was assisted by an old friend, the sculptor Eugène Guillaume. About a year before the opening, Pasteur was negotiating with the Russian ambassador, M. de Morenheim, about which of two busts in St. Petersburg of the Czar Alexander III—in military uniform or in civilian garb—was to be given to the Institute. Among the foreign royalty, Pasteur was also arranging for busts of the Sultan of Turkey and of Don Pedro, the Emperor of Brazil. Pasteur appreciated not only their donations, but the fact that their sculpted presence would give the new institute an international character. He also secured representations of generous supporters within France.Footnote105\n\nThe inauguration of the Institute occasioned ceremonies with dignitaries and press coverage. It also marked a relocation by the Pasteurs into an art-filled apartment on the second floor, close to his beloved laboratories, like the state apartment in a royal palace. In 1888 Pasteur also served as the honorary president of a committee for French art in a national Danish exhibition celebrating the reign of King Christian IX. A painted group portrait of this committee, with Pasteur at the centre, was commissioned by Pasteur’s friend Carl Jacobsen from Peder Severin Krøyer (1851–1909), who had studied with Bonnat. The large canvas includes several friends of Pasteur: Bonnat, Carolus-Duran, Dubois, Gérôme, and Mercié.Footnote106 In the painting, Pasteur was encircled by artists. At home, too, he was surrounded by his artist friends, or at least by their works, as most of the pieces on display had been made by friends. In 1892, several pieces were added as souvenirs of his 70th birthday jubilee, where art played a role together with science.\n\nThis ceremony in the Grand Amphitheatre of the Sorbonne is well known, and we simply note a few features most salient to the fine arts. The President of France was at Pasteur’s side as he sat behind the table to receive numerous presentations of dignitaries ranging from Sir Joseph Lister to his dear friend the artist Pointelin as representative of the town of Arbois. Pasteur was frail, and his speech was read by his son, Jean-Baptiste. It opened with a thank-you that was also self-congratulatory. ‘Monsieur le Président de la République, your presence transforms everything. A family fête becomes a public fête, and a simple anniversary of the birth of a savant, thanks to you, will remain a date in French science’.Footnote107 He made a memorable plea for science, ‘Young people, young people. […] Live in the serene peace of your laboratories and your libraries’. And, in closing, he mentioned one of his artist friends, Oscar Roty, who had created a portrait medal for the occasion.Footnote108\n\nTwo painted records of the ceremony captured the same moment: Louis Pasteur welcoming the embrace of Sir Joseph Lister, the early champion of Pasteur’s work on microbes in medicine. Less known of the two images is the modestly-scaled painting created by Lucien Laurent-Gsell. The almost square image, about half a metre wide, brings viewers up very close to a seated Pasteur leaning forward for the embrace of a standing Lister. This work was exhibited in the 1893 Salon, and the painting is recorded as being on deposit at the ENS since 1894 (though I have been unable to locate it).Footnote109 The more famous of the two images is a huge, impersonal painting commissioned for the Sorbonne from Jean-André Rixens (1846–1924). Rixens had entered the EBA while Pasteur was teaching there, and studied with Gérôme. This panoramic view reveals the amphitheatre as Lister was climbing the steps of the stage with arms outstretched and Pasteur was stepping toward him. The painting measures 5.5 metres wide and is installed in the Sorbonne. It shows 408 attendees, of which hundreds can be individually identified (See ). In many ways, this resembles a traditional coronation-scene painting, and the artist has rearranged people for visibility and included some who were not present that day, such as René Vallery-Radot and Dr Grancher. Among those seen on the stage are not only medical scientists like Charcot and Metchnikoff, but also the sculptor Auguste Rodin and the painter Auguste Pointelin. If it seems more a monument than a work of art, that was the point. It inevitably calls to mind the even larger canvas by Jacques-Louis David, the Coronation of Napoleon (1807, 9.8 metres wide, with 150 persons) in the Louvre.\n\nReproduction of the oversized painting of the 1892 Pasteur Jubilee by Jean-André Rixens published in ‘La Obra de Pasteur’, Chanteclair: Periódico Trimestral 17:146 (April-June 1923), pp. 1–8, on p. 8. Author’s collection. In the French version of this publication, the similar article is ‘L’Oeuvre de Pasteur’, Chanteclair: Journal illustré 18:178 (March-June 1923), pp. 1–8, on p 8.\n\nThis jubilee was the last major event Pasteur attended. Thereafter his life was largely limited to family and friends in his apartment. The works of art there now included the glass vase created by Émile Gallé (1846–1904), one of the founders of Art Nouveau, with symbols of Pasteur’s career, recently presented by the students of the ENS. Back in 1881 Pasteur had received the gift of a bronze reduction of the Roman Bull sculpted in 1857 by Auguste Clésinger (born in Besançon), carrying special memories since it was a gift from his laboratory collaborators to celebrate the success of the anthrax vaccine with cattle.Footnote110 Many of the artworks are portraits of Pasteur and his family, but at least three, as mentioned, symbolize the hardships of the Franco-Prussian war: Henner’s L’Alsace and Mercié’s Quand même! and Gloria victis. In this apartment, the family welcomed artist friends, especially Edelfelt and Jurassian compatriots like Pointelin.Footnote111\n\n12. Pasteur’s final year (1895)\n\nIn 1895, the laboratories in the other parts of the Institute building were a hive of activity, even as Pasteur’s life was slowing down within the apartment after he suffered his third stroke in November 1894. Rabies work continued apace. Major strides were being made in antitoxin treatments for both diphtheria and tetanus. Albert Calmette was importing American rattlesnakes to make anti-venom. Élie Metchnikoff was in residence, too, working on his phagocytes. In January of this final year, a bi-weekly magazine published an article written by one of Pasteur’s nephews, Paul Gsell, with three affectionate drawings of an aged Pasteur by Paul’s brother Lucien Laurent-Gsell.Footnote112\n\nIn Pasteur’s apartment one of the dearest visitors was the painter Edelfelt, a man whom Pasteur treated like a son. In April 1895, Edelfelt wrote to his mother. ‘Last Sunday we were at the Pasteurs. It was terribly sad to see him. He was almost completely paralyzed, and talking requires a great effort. But the intellect has remained intact. […] When he saw us, he wanted me to sit in front of him and started crying aloud when we had talked about his friendship with me. He took my hand, held it tight’.Footnote113\n\nPasteur died, as he had lived, surrounded by works of art, on 28 September, three months short of his seventy-third birthday. After a few days of lying-in-state at the Institute, his funeral on 5 October in Notre Dame was a state occasion. On 2 October 1895, Edelfelt who would not be able to attend, sent a note to Jean-Baptiste, to which he replied in part: ‘He truly did love you, and such a pleasure it was for him to meet you and to hear you talk about your work. […] Those beautiful days have gone. […] But you have painted him, for centuries at least, on that delightful canvas that made him so proud, even more proud perhaps than you. I have already been a few times to study it, talking to him through it’.Footnote114\n\nIf one pictures the jubilee ceremony as a coronation of Pasteur, we may consider the interment in a crypt decorated with shimmering mosaics as his sanctification. Pasteur was not buried in the secular Pantheon with so many other heroes of French history. His remains repose in a basement tomb—in the Pasteur Institute building. Breath-taking mosaics cover the walls and vaulted ceiling of this crypt. Visitors, who must enter by descending marble steps, are forced to feel they are entering a holy place, much like underground crypts holding the remains of emperors, kings, and saints (See ). All the animals and plants portrayed were part of Pasteur’s work: grape vines, hop plants, mulberry trees, silkworms, moths, sheep, cattle, fowl, and dogs. The walls carry a simple list of Pasteur’s discoveries. And if the tonality of the room is religious, this is a religion for a new era ushered in by Pasteur’s achievements. In the corners where the walls meet the vaulting are inscribed the Latin words for the three cardinal virtues: Faith, Hope, and Charity. But the fourth corner carries the banner of Science, honouring this modern virtue alongside the others.\n\nNeo-Byzantine crypt, work of Charles-Louis Girault, with granite tomb of Louis Pasteur, Pasteur Museum at the Pasteur Institute, Paris.

When received into the Académie française, Pasteur spoke of ‘beauty’, and those words will long be read on the wall of his funeral chapel. ‘Blessed is the man who carries a god inside, an ideal of beauty that he obeys’.Footnote115 Beauty—whether of faces, crystals, theories, or painted scenes—was a continuous inspiration for Pasteur. While beauty can refer to many things, for Pasteur (as for his favourite neo-classical sculptors like Canova or Dubois and the academic painters he felt closest to), it was a combination of form, balance, and harmony, and thus a product of human action, in short, of work. Pasteur was not a Romantic, enamoured of demonic energy, sunsets, shipwrecks, or stormy nature, but a man who admired both the artist who creates the harmonious image and the scientist who creates beautiful insights, ideas, and theories.\n\n13. Reflections on art in Pasteur’s life\n\nThe beauty of human work returns us to the history of science. Although this study’s goals are unabashedly empirical, a few general comments seem appropriate about the new revelations above and what insights further research might yield. First, we have a richer and more complex personality, one that is missing from the authoritative works by Debre, Dubos, and Geison—and even from the early biographies by his son-in-law. We have gained a new image of this pivotal figure with a clearer picture of his personal and professional relationships and with clear evidence of emotions beyond his well-known bluster and arrogance. Though fiercely committed to his laboratory work, Pasteur took precious work time to visit studios and art exhibitions or to attend to the needs of an elderly friend like the sculptor Perraud. Documentation of the time he enjoyed spending with artists makes clear that he joked freely with them and even laughed at himself. Clearly, he was ‘less forbidding and hard’ than usually portrayed.\n\nSecond, this narrative has allowed us to highlight contact points at which his art seems likely to have had some connection with the intellectual content, not just the social process of his science, even as these possible junctures invite additional research. For example, how closely did he work with the scientific illustrator, Peter Lackerbauer, especially regarding the accurate representation of the colours of different wines shown in publications or the verisimilitude of the silk worm images? And might it be possible to find explicit confirmation for the hypothesis that Pasteur’s breakthrough observations of mirror-image symmetry in certain crystals and his ideas about molecular shapes were indebted to his early artistic practices? Additionally, by establishing that Pasteur’s teaching at the EBA was an endeavour to which he was deeply devoted, this account suggests that his surviving notes about how and what he taught would probably benefit from a fresh examination by historians of science.\n\nThird, Pasteur’s activities of self-promotion, especially those involving the fine arts, take on new significance, both within his biography and in the wider history of science in the popular media. Pasteur’s rich and varied modes of participation in the Parisian art world is significant in another way because it showed him the value of securing a presence in the popular press, the graphic arts, and wider public discourse. He engineered this for his friends in art before doing it for himself in science. The many painted or sculpted portraits and laboratory scenes were not distractions or casual diversions for him, but formed an intentional messaging programme. Publicity was at the centre of the Salon culture and a key to individuals’ success.\n\nIn thinking about Pasteur’s presence in the general media, we must keep in mind that in his era news"
