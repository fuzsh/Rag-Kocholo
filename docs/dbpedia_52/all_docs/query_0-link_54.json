        "text": "Giorgia von Albertini ‘Kara Walker: A Black Hole is Everything a Star Longs to Be,’ Kunstmuseum Basel, Basel, 5 June – 26 September 2021 Surveying American history from slavery to Barack Obama’s presidency, the trailblazing artist Kara Walker has no patience for political correctness and does not propose a conciliatory view of the past, instead prodding the viewer to question established narratives and entrenched myths. In her first extensive solo exhibition in Switzerland, curated by Dr. Anita Haldemann, Walker presents more than 600 drawings from her personal archive, which she has closely guarded for the past 28 years. After seeing ‘Fons Americanus,’ a monumental sculptural allegory of the Black Atlantic in Tate’s Turbine Hall last year, I am beyond excited to see this substantial exhibition of Walker’s works on paper.\n\n‘Kara Walker: A Black Hole is Everything a Star Longs to Be,’ Kunstmuseum Basel, Basel, 5 June – 26 September 2021 Walker is the quintessential American artist. Best known for her use of the American antebellum craft medium of silhouette paper cutting, her subject matter also springs from an uniquely American experience: slavery and its aftermath. Walker’s works tell antic and epic stories of both violent and strangely joyous miscegenation, mixing old-timey and contemporary imagery. This retrospective is the first for Walker since the collaboration between the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, and Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, more than a decade ago. I’m excited to see a European take on this material and am also relishing the visual bath of great draftsmanship that a Walker show always delivers.\n\n‘Ulysses Jenkins: Without Your Interpretation,’ Institute of Contemporary Art, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia PA, 17 September – 30 December 2021 Jenkins is primarily a performance and video artist who was an active part of the Black Arts Movement in Los Angeles in the 1970s, often collaborating with artists like Senga Nengudi and David Hammons. This timely look at Jenkins’ contributions follows the magisterial Nengudi retrospective that is on view through the end of July at The Philadelphia Museum, and ‘You’ve Come a Long Way Baby: The Sapphire Show,’ a recreation of a pivotal Black Arts Movement exhibition on view at Ortuzar Projects in New York through 31 July. It also presages an exhibition focusing on the work of the filmmaker and impresario Linda Goode Bryant that will open at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 2022.\n\n‘Mothership: Voyage Into Afrofuturism,’ Oakland Museum of California, Oakland, 7 August 2021 – 27 February 2022 After a year-long delay, ‘Mothership’ is opening at the Oakland Museum of California. Curated by Rhonda Pagnozzi—I served as the consulting curator—the group exhibition is framed via black feminist theory/praxis and grapples with a range of visual, academic, and everyday acts of Black pleasure, critique, and liberation, with an overall focus on California. I’m excited to rest beneath the recreation of Parliament Funkadelic Mothership, to be enraptured by Rashaad Newsome’s collages and installation, and to view Sandra Bean’s family videos from 1930s and ’40s Oakland. These, and the entirety of the exhibition, continue the practice of collapsing time, medium, and aesthetics to forward that Black people are indeed in the future (and of our past) that Afrofuturism has consistently affirmed.\n\n‘July Screen’ series, Now Instant, Los Angeles, ongoing The LA-based, artist-run art house theater shuttered its Northeast LA brick and mortar last year but continues to offer programs through a virtual screen space and a monthly series of compelling collaborations. July’s program features film/video presentations by a mélange of artists, collectives, gallery projects, and publishing endeavors (such as the new ‘November Magazine’). ‘The Going Away Present,’ Kristina Kite Gallery, Los Angeles, 24 July – 21 August 2021 ‘The Going Away Present,’ organized by Kristina Kite and Sarah Lehrer-Graiwer, is a group show, a zine, and a scent crafted as a going away gift to writer and educator Bruce Hailey, who is leaving Los Angeles after an influential 25-year residency. The project involves a long list of friends, former students, and collaborators—Dennis Cooper, Kelly Akashi, Trisha Donnelly, Hedi El Kholti, Wayne Koestenbaum, Mona Varichon and Laura Owens, to name a few—and reads as a tender letter to an inspiring figure and a testament to his imprint on the city.\n\n‘Mythologies: Surrealism and Beyond—Masterpieces from Centre Pompidou,’ Hong Kong Museum of Art, 21 May – 15 September 2021 In the age of COVID-19, most people in Hong Kong are reluctant to leave the Special Administrative Region. Not out of fear of catching the virus—especially since the vaccine rollout—but because of the potentially long quarantine upon return. For this reason, Hong Kong Museum of Art’s special exhibition “Mythologies: Surrealism and Beyond—Masterpieces from the Centre Pompidou” is the way to travel—via the imagination—without having to board an airplane. Over 100 works from the influential European movement are on loan from the preeminent Paris museum. Giorgio de Chirico’s ‘Two Figures’ (ca. 1920), Max Ernst’s ‘Chimera’ (1928), Francis Picabia’s ‘The Adoration of the Calf’ (1941–42) and Rene Magritte’s ‘The Rape’ (1945) are among the many iconic canvases that rejected the rational in favor of the unconscious. Also included are early black and white photographs of nocturnal Paris by Brassaï and editions of ‘Minotaure,’ the Surrealist-focused periodical co-edited by movement pioneer André Breton and Pierre Mabille. The exhibition offers mind-bending paintings, drawings, sculptures, photographs and journals by some of the key participants in this early 20th-century European cultural movement, which shapes the course of art history to this day. ‘Ink City,’ Tai Kwun Contemporary, Hong Kong, 23 April – 1 August 2021 In East Asia, ink is as popular an artistic medium as conceptual art in other parts of the world. One might not know this because the medium is typically positioned in the stodgy framework of traditional Chinese brushwork. Tobias Berger and Katherine Don upend this narrow interpretation of ink with the exuberant group exhibition, ‘Ink City.’ Their selection of works—mostly by Hong Kong practitioners—is wonderfully expansive and includes artists’ books, installation, performance and video art. Looking well beyond the literati practice of depicting idyllic landscapes conceived for slow contemplation, most of the work reflects on what it means to live in the late 20th and early 21st century—from Luis Chan’s psychedelic figurative paintings of Hong Kong’s growing migrant population in the 1980s, to the tragi-comic explorations of gender and identity by Chengdu-born, Rotterdam-based Evelyn Taocheng Wang. Let’s hope this sparks a new trend of viewing ink art through a contemporary lens.\n\n— Giorgia von Albertini is a curator and writer based in Switzerland.
