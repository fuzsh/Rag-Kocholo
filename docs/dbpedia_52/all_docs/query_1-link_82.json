Once we have got over a certain egotism, the result to the reader is almost entirely pleasant, for the author, although he can boast no particular literary style, is an excellent gossip; and as he saw a good deal upon his tour, and passed through the Hawaiian revolution, his record is not without value.”\n\n“Mr. Nottage has anticipated the strictures of those critics who are likely to be influenced by the way in which the subject suggested by the title is kept in the background, by printing in his preface a number of tentative reviews of a somewhat hostile type. We can assure him, however, that he need not fear that anyone who reads his book through will have much else but praise for its exceedingly interesting character, and that the mere fact that he has relegated the question of climate to a secondary position will easily be forgiven.”\n\nCharles G.

(Ex) Z338 .P76q\n\nLate in his career, John Baskerville printed an edition of Orlando Furioso for the Molini brothers, an Italian printing firm based in Paris. This beautiful four-volume set of Ariosto’s 50,000 line poem is illustrated with forty-six engraving (plus a frontispiece), designed by some of the most celebrated artists of that time. A new engraving begins each new episode of the author’s work and the artists appear to have been given much freedom in their designs. The twenty-one artists don’t often get credit and so, here’s the complete list.\n\nFrontispiece portrait is after a painting by Titian (ca. 1485/90?-1576), drawn by Charles Dominique Joseph Eisen (1720-1778) and engraved by Etienne Ficquet (1719-1794).\n\nThe plates were designed by Giovanni Battista Cipriani (1727-1785); Charles Nicolas Cochin II (1715-1790); Charles Dominique Joseph Eisen (1720-1778); Jean-Baptiste Greuze (1725-1805); Charles Monnet (1732-after 1808); Jean-Michel Moreau the Younger (1741-1814).\n\nThe engravings were cut by Francesco Bartolozzi (1728-1815); Pierre Philippe Choffard (1730-1809); Antoine Jean Duclos (1742-1795); Emmanuel Jean de Ghendt (1738-1815); Isidore Stanislas Henri Helman (1743-?1806/9); Benott Louis Henriquez (1732-1806); Nicolas de Launay (1739-1792); Joseph de Longueil (1730-1792); Pietro Antonio Martini (1738-1797); Jean Massard (1740-1822); Jean-Michel Moreau, the Younger (1741-1814); Nicolas Ponce (1746-1831); Benoit Louis Prevost (1747-ca. 1804); and Jean-Baptiste-Blaise Simonet (1742-after 1813).\n\nThe prospectus states: “The Brothers Molini have undertaken to present an Edition which will satisfy the desires of the Public, and correspond with the reputation of this great man. They have used the presses of the famous Baskerville, whose master-pieces of printing all the world knows and admires.”\n\nDibdin said, “The Baskerville edition of Orlando Furioso with the cuts of Bartolozzi is more exquisite than the splendid edition of Zatta. I never see, or even think of, the lovely edition of Baskerville, of 1773 … without the most unmixed satisfaction. Paper, printing, drawing, plates—all delight the eye, and gratify the heart, of the thorough-bred bibliomaniacal Virtuoso. This edition has hardly its equal, and certainly not its superior, in any publication with which I am acquainted.”\n\nThis might be the most interesting note: “The engraver Bartolozzi grew weary of the delays of the publisher of these beautiful volumes, who one day in a passion called him an ass, a poltroon, an animal. The artist made no reply; he was working at the moment on the plate of the 43d Chant; without turning from his task, he lightly traced these three words upon the tomb which was engraved upon that plate,—d’asino, de poltrone, d’animale.” —Josiah Henry Benton, John Baskerville (Updike, 1914)\n\nSomeone must have caught this and scraped it off, since our plate doesn’t include these words:\n\nEdy-Legrand (1892-1970), Macao & Cosmage, ou, L’expérience du Bonheur [Macao & Cosmage, or The Experience of Happiness] (Paris: Éditions de la Nouvelle Revue Française, [1919]).

As an adult, he traveled extensively, living for a time in Morocco, but when this book was drawn and written, the artist was still in Paris only dreaming of exotic locations.\n\nThe story of the lovers Macao and Cosmage who lived an idyllic life on a secluded island touched many readers including E.M. Forster (1879-1970), who reviewed the book in glowing terms. Forster noted that in “the heart of each man there is contrived a magical island.” Just as Macao and Cosmage had to confront the modern world when a ship lands on their island, Forster draws a parallel in the way human beings preserve their moments and visions of bliss “from the thoughtless destructive reality.” — Abinger Harvest (1936).

Paris: Imprimerie royale, Sébastien Mabre-Cramoisy, 1670. Graphic Arts Collection. Purchased with funds donated by the Friends of the Princeton University Library.\n\nThanks to the generous assistance of the Friends of the Princeton University Library, the graphic arts collection has acquired a stunning copy of the 17th-century festival book, Courses de testes et de bague documenting the Carrousel of 1662, the last fête held in Paris before Louis XIV (1638-1715) moved the court to Versailles.\n\nThe Imprimerie Royale of France published Courses de testes et de bague in the final months of 1670 as the first volume of the Cabinet du Roi (later reorganized as volume X). Seven hundred copies were printed and bound in red leather, four hundred in French and three hundred in Latin. The book records a Carrousel (also written carousel) or tournament held on June 5 and 6, 1662, organized by the twenty-four year old King. The fifty-five participants were divided into five quadrilles representing the Romans, Persians, Turks, East Indians, and Native Americans Indians, with the king and four of his highest ranking noblemen as the chiefs.\n\nThe acquisition is a nice complement to the seven small pamphlets already held in the rare book collection describing the Carrousel: Iorvnal historique dv grand et magnifiqve carovsel ov tovrnoy de Lovys XIV, roy de France et de Navare. Contenant ce qui s’est fait & passé les cinq & six de iuin courses de la bague (Paris: Chez I.B. Loyson, 1662). With this acquisition we not only document the event but also the beginning of the Cabinet du Roi, the first use of the icon of the sun by Louis XIV (Sun King), and the farewell to Paris by the royal court.\n\nDuring the eight years it took to create Courses de testes et de bague, the five men responsible for it—Charles Perrault, Esprit Fléchier, Israel Silvestre, François Chauveau, and Gilles Rousselet—became or already were members of the controlling academies of Paris. Historian Lynn Festa, writing in Empires of the Sun: Colonialism and Closure in Louis XIV’s 1662 Carrousel, comments, “What is curious about the Carrousel is the prominent place given within this closed universe to those who have no access to power within it—to images of subjugated populations, to colonial rivals, to slaves.”\n\n“Rather than challenging Louis’s serene, absolutist order, the exotic otherness of the extravagantly costumed princes, slaves, and animals, serves to celebrate the king’s power. The potentially threatening plurality of images is enclosed in the systematic, subordinating hierarchy of the royal fete. If the first half of the Carrousel—the procession—celebrates and constructs the otherness of its exotic figures, the second half—the ritual assembly before the Louvre—rewrites the meaning of these images into a specifically French iconography that affirms the centrality of Louis XIV.”\n\nOur sincere thanks to the Friends of the Princeton University Library for making this possible!\n\nFor more information, read this Haverford senior thesis: http://thesis.haverford.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10066/1414/2008NelsonN.pdf\n\nPeter Johann Nepomuk Geiger (1805-1880), Peter Joh.

The work first began to appear that same year as Historische Handzeichnungen, Vienna, kaiserlich-königliche Hof- und Staatsdruckerei. Graphic Arts recently acquired a compilation of the entire set of Gieger’s history.\n\nPeter Geiger (1805-1880) was a respected history painter and illustrator, producing popular images based on the works of Goethe, Schiller, and Shakespeare, as well as Austrian authors such as Grillparzer and Stifter. It was his work for an earlier project, Anton Ziegler’s Vaterländische Immortellen aus dem Gebiete der österreichischen Geschichte (1838-1840), which first brought him considerable public attention. Although Princeton does not own this multi-volume work, it is available through itunes.

The cult of the Sun King, elaborated in art and architecture at Versailles and Marly and acted out in a daily ritual lived by Louis XIV for several decades, has not yet received the comprehensive study it deserves…”\n\n“The official emblem of His Majesty is a resplendent sun shining over a terrestrial globe with the device Nec Pluribus Impar, Not Unequal to Many, which means to say His Majesty is equal to many kings. …All the world knows the image of His Majesty as Sun King from the myriad of engravings that have been printed and the host of medals issued from the mint. …”\n\nGiesey continues, “I find myself unable to respect the classical themes in the cult of the Sun King the way I do analogous elements in his predecessor’s ceremonials—as, for example, in royal entries. Revival of the virtues of the pagan world during the Renaissance had meant a broadening of the base of humanitas in western society; Louis XIV made the pagan world seem to be an allegory of his own personal life.”\n\n“The cult of the Sun King postulated Louis’s Divinity on a colossal scale without risking the taint of sacrilege. Louis XIV emancipated himself from old royal ceremonials that had brought the ruler together with his subjects in public forums and created in their stead rites of personality carried out in his private dwellings. L’état, c’est moi whether or not Louis XIV ever uttered those words as a motto of his political conduct, they do catch the ineffable spirit of his ritual life.”\n\nRalph E.

He asked for a fellowship “to photograph freely throughout the United States and make a broad voluminous picture record of things American.” Frank was successful and in the summer of 1955, set out in a used Ford to photograph America.\n\nFrank drove over 10,000 miles in the next eighteen months, shooting 767 rolls of film. 1957 and 1958 were spent developing and printing the film; selecting shots; finding the appropriate author to write an introduction (Jack Kerouac); and printing the final book, which was called Les Americains (1958) and The Americans (1959).\n\nOne of the first photographs Frank made in the summer of 1955 was “Fourth of July- Jay, New York, 1955”. That original negative has been reprinted several times over the years and in 2009 Jon Goodman used it to print 500 photogravure frontispieces for The Limited Editions Club’s printing of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence.

Although the title page records Cologne as the place of publication, it is more likely to have been printed in Amsterdam for a French audience, to avoid trouble with the censors.\n\nFrançoise d’Aubigné marquise de Maintenon (1635-1719) married Louis XIV (1638-1715) in a private ceremony during the winter of 1685-86. It was the second marriage for both. Although morganatic marriages were not recognized in France, this was a secret, unapproved marriage between two people of uneven rank, barring the passage of the King’s titles and privileges to his wife.\n\nThe king’s (well-known) secret marriage was a sensitive topic in the seventeenth century, hence the use of a pseudonym by the author and a fictitious name for the publisher.
