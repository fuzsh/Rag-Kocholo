How do we explore, through literature, the substance behind the stereotypical association of love, romance, and sexual pleasure with French culture? Do sex, passion and love always unite in the pursuit of emotional fulfillment in human relations, according to this literature? What affiliations does this literature interweave between such relations of love, requited or unrequited, and pleasure, enjoyment, freedom, self-empowerment, on the one hand, and on the other hand, suffering, jealousy, crime, violence, negativity, notions of perversion, morbidity, and even death? How are problems of gender roles and human sexuality‚Äîi.e. hetero-, bi-, homo- and other forms of sexuality‚Äîapproached in this literature? What connections or conflicts are revealed in this literature between human love relationships and the social norms and conventions within which they occur, as well as the forms of political governance that have been practiced in France over the centuries? Those are some of the issues that are investigated in this course, which offers a broad historical overview of selective ways in which love, passion, desire and erotic behavior in French culture have been represented and understood in literature and, more recently, in film, from the middle ages to the twentieth century. Readings from major French authors drawn from various centuries such as Marie de France, B√©roul, Moli√®re, de Sade, Flaubert, Gide, and Duras will be supplemented with screenings of optional films that are based on those texts or are pertinent to them in important ways.\n\nNOTES: Course taught in English.

We will study the development of the lurid motifs of the Gothic that works affiliated with this genre often deploy to invoke a sense of horror and dread, moral corruption, and psychological abjection, all seemingly meant to assimilate the South and its citizens to the category of a degenerate and menacing otherness. The imagery of dismal landscapes, dark swamps, decaying architecture, fanatical and occult religious practices‚Äîall of which are often grotesque or monstrous figures and cultural tropes that associate the South with an imaginary medieval past‚Äîwill be examined mostly as marks of an ambivalent ideological struggle surrounding the self-identity of America. Thanks to this regime of gothic tropes and insignia, America, on the one hand, heralds its own self-identity as culturally rich and historically continuous, and yet, it is, at least partly thanks to this same regimen of gothic tropes, on the other hand, that America also typically (or stereotypically) deals with anxieties arising from its attempts to define its own modern identity, and its identity as modern and exceptional. We shall also study several important ways in which the Gothic serves as an important voice for the marginalized, and as a medium that enables critical reflections on social and cultural practices of exclusion and inclusion in American life. The history of slavery, the civil war, and its aftermath, as well as literature produced by certain Southern writers (such as William Faulkner, Thomas Wolfe, Carson McCullers, Flannery O'Connor, Eudora Welty, Truman Capote, Tennessee Williams, Katherine Anne Porter, and others) since the late 19th century, will be identified as important defining contexts of emergence for the Southern Gothic, and as the indispensable conditions that have made its deployment into 20th century film and television possible. Due attention will also be paid to the influence of French colonial adventures in shaping cultures and ‚Äúgothic‚Äù mythologies of the American South, and the Caribbean, as well as the role played by America‚Äôs own efforts to secure and maintain hegemonic influences on the region. The course is conducted in English, and requires no prior knowledge of the field. All films are streamed to your computer from the UMass library on demand. Required readings are provided online, and no book purchases are necessary.\n\nNOTES: Course taught in English.

What can the genre teach us about the culture, history, and core values of France? We will study themes and genres and investigate the educational and entertainment objectives that literature for the young gives itself. In doing so, we will question the validity of the \"child‚Äôs voice\" created by the grown-up industry who writes and pulls the strings. Through close readings we will study and question age categories. We will also discuss representation of diversity throughout all age categories. Our reading of primary sources will be brought to light by critical, theoretical, and pedagogical texts.

Whether it is the literary treatment of science or of magic that is often at the frontiers of the human in its relationship to the other, this literature in French often conceptualizes an original vision of the future or the past, whose cultural stakes we will try to understand.\n\nNOTES: Course taught in French.

French chefs have long set the standard for the high-end restaurant world; it was French winemakers, a century ago, who first gave a legal status to the concept of terroir; while French farmers are perhaps best known for their skill in staging effective displays of political force. France is also an agricultural powerhouse, a leading global exporter of agricultural goods and a key player in determining European agricultural policy. As in the United States, however, the French agri-food sector is currently facing an array of daunting challenges, from changing consumer preferences to an aging farmer demographic to an increasingly unstable climate. In this course we will learn what is distinctive about French food and agriculture and consider what the example of France has to offer environmental and food system activists in the U.S. and beyond. Topics to be covered include: French agricultural politics and the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP); debates over livestock production in France (animal welfare, veganism, re-wilding); the world of French cheese; the history of France‚Äôs much-admired open-air produce markets; the wine sector and wine-grape production; organic farming and other efforts to reduce pesticide use in France; the nature of French agricultural education; social diversity in French agriculture; and the French government‚Äôs current campaign to bring about a large-scale ‚Äúagroecological transition.‚Äù Classes will be conducted in French, although some reading and writing assignments may be in English. This course will equip you with a vocabulary specific to food, agriculture, and the environment and a strong familiarity with the institutions and dynamics underlying France‚Äôs famous agri-food system. As such, it will provide excellent preparation for students wishing to pursue future work or study in France or another francophone country.\n\nNOTES: Course taught in French.

At the end of this course, which will introduce a variety of French food films of different genres dating from the 1930s to the present, you will be able to analyze films and their different genres as cultural products, identify the values transmitted within these works of art, and critically discuss films with the technical vocabulary of film analysis.\n\nNOTES: Course taught in English.

In a series of films ranging from thrillers to comedies, this course will focus on how these issues reflect economic realities, national obsessions, and social transformations. By the end of this course, students will be able to analyze contemporary French films and the different genres to which they belong, before identifying the values conveyed by these cultural productions, and critically discussing these same films using the technical vocabulary of film analysis.\n\nNOTES: Course taught in French.

Event 0 and Life is Strange are two adventure games (cinematic) with puzzles to solve, while Valiant Hearts is more of an action-platformer that requires combat and strategy. Our class discussions and your assignments will focus on your progression through these games, which have varying degrees of immersion, as well as their cultural specificities. This course will also look closely at the figure of the hero in these video games, as well as the treatment of violence and the epic nature of some form of heroization and the transmission of its values.\n\nNOTES: Course taught in French.

Students should expect to be familiarized with the key ideas and objectives that have inspired and driven that practice since the early 1960s, and be furnished with the technical tools and methodological skills that would permit them to understand, analyze, and think critically about the artistic and thematic aspects of the films that are screened. They should also expect the course to provide them with a critical peek into several cardinal issues of social and cultural relevance in contemporary Africa and its history. Issues of interest typically include the nation-state and its declining status, imperatives of decolonization, economic dependency and structural adjustment programs, orality and changing traditional cultures, diasporic migrations, urbanization and its problems, gender relations, civil wars, child soldiers, gangs, and related themes. Filmmakers studied: Abderrahmane Sissako, Gillo Pontecorvo, Ousmane Semb√®ne, Raoul Peck, Jean-Marie Teno, Dani Kouyat√©, Mweze Ngangura, Gavin Hood, Neill Blomkamp, Moufida Tlatli, Djibril Diop Mamb√©ty (please note that this list is subject to change, and shall be updated as future changes are made).

In fact, even asking the question ‚ÄúWhy do women write?‚Äù would today be considered by most of us to be as strange as it would have been to ask ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt (more) women write?‚Äù in George Sand‚Äôs 19th century. Of course, French women have been writing since at least the 12th century when Marie de France wrote her Lais. Yet, when we examine a comprehensive list of French women writers, there is no denying that most of the authors‚Äô names belong to women writers of the 20th century. So what happened in the 20th century? As we read the works of some of France‚Äôs best-known authors, who happen to be women, we will discuss, among other things, the socio-economic conditions that made it possible, and sometimes necessary, for women to write in the 20th century. Which key historical events took place in 20th century France that made writing by women possible, necessary, vital, transformative? Why did women decide to pick up the pen to write when they did, and how has this deliberate act transformed the intellectual, social, political, cultural and literary landscape of France over the course of the 20th century? As we read and discuss the novels, short stories, plays or autofictions of, for example, Colette, de Beauvoir, Nemirovsky, Sarraute, Duras, Delbo, Ernaux, Gavalda, Saumont and others, we will think about the wide-ranging impact that these unique female voices have had on literature in France since the Belle √âpoque.\n\nNOTES: Course taught in French.

We will read a variety of texts in the storytelling tradition, from Les Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles to Beroalde de Verville's Le Moyen de parvenir. We will place emphasis on genre definition, narratology, aesthetics and cultural history. Among the problems we will discuss together are the following: the relationship between ideology (courtly love, feudalism, humanism, evangelism, \"Querelle des femmes\", etc.) and literature; rhetoric and truth, historicity and exemplarity; imitation; intertextuality; \"vraisemblance\"; authority, authorship and gendered discourse; exemplarity, self-referentiality and identity.\n\nNOTES: Course taught in French.

Emphasis will be placed on the problematic nature of self-identity as a key to expressivity in the cultural and historical contexts when national literatures aim at reflecting and influencing major ideological and political changes (humanism, Evangelism and the Reformation, patriotism and the rise of the absolute monarchy). We will also consider the role of gender in the shaping of poetic identities. Among the poets to be considered are Cl√©ment Marot, Marguerite de Navarre, Maurice Sc√®ve, Pernette du Guillet, Louise Lab√©, Joachim du Bellay, Pierre de Ronsard, and Agrippa d'Aubign√©.\n\nNOTES: Course taught in French.

This \"renewal\" entailed a rethinking of the role of reason in political and social life, a re-conception of gender relations, and a redefinition of Europe's relationship with non-European cultures. We will follow the staging of this triple agenda in the works (novels and plays) of Montesquieu, Beaumarchais, Marivaux, Rousseau, Diderot, Laclos, Pr√©vost, Voltaire, and other luminaries of the Encyclop√©die movement.\n\nNOTES: Course taught in French.

Specific topics will vary and may focus on a specific movement, author or theme. Current topic: The Realist Movement. Still perceived as a ‚Äúminor‚Äù genre at the end of the eighteenth century, the novel quickly emerged as the modern literary form of choice in the years following the French Revolution. In this course we will trace the evolution of the novel with respect to the broad contexts of nineteenth-century French history and culture. We will focus in particular on the rise of French realism and its relation to the development of modernity in France, examining the treatment of such key themes as education and initiation, revolution, money and the commodification of culture, criminality, urban spaces, the changing roles of class and gender in French society, and the emerging contours of modern identity‚Äîalong with its distinctively modern pathologies (alienation, boredom, addiction). We will also look at critical debates from the period on the nature of literary realism, as well as take up the question of realist representation in the visual arts, examining relevant work by artists, caricaturists, and photographers.

Specific topics will vary and may focus on a specific movement, author, or theme. Current topic: The Invention of the Modern. \"Il faut √™tre absolument moderne,\" writes Rimbaud in Une saison en enfer. Against the rise of the novel, which quickly established itself in the years following the French Revolution as the preeminent literary form of the \"modern,\" French poetry had to reinvent itself to maintain its relevance in a France undergoing rapid political, social, and economic change. In this seminar, we will trace the evolution of French poetry in the nineteenth century with respect to the broader contexts of French history and culture. We will examine in particular the major poetic movements of the century (romanticism, the \"Parnassian\" group and the concept of \"l'art pour l'art,\" symbolism) and their links with several key themes of modernity: revolution, nature, changing notions of the good and the beautiful, money and the commodification of culture, urban spaces (the street, the crowd, the arcade, the barricade, urbanism, and architecture), the exotic, love and desire, and the appearance of the \"modern\" identity, together with its distinctly modern pathologies (alienation, boredom, nostalgia, addiction).

Students do so in the company of a small group of peers whose skills closely align with their own. Through the study of a variety of literary texts, plays, documents, and films the students take part in a semester-long discussion of a particular literary topic and its political, social, and/or cultural contexts. The Senior Seminar satisfies the Integrative Experience requirement for majors in French and Francophone Studies, who are usually expected to take the course in their last semester of the program. In particular, it aims to provide advanced students of French the opportunity to reflect upon the entirety of their experience as French majors and to discuss the relevance of their French major to their broader university education as well as to all of the learning opportunities, ideally including study abroad, in which they have engaged in the last few years.\n\nTopic for Spring 2025: (Check back soon)\n\nNOTES: Course taught in French.

Each writer created her own recognizably unique writing voice quite unlike that of any other writer of her time, male or female. While each had her own imperative that made writing a necessity, all three women enriched French literature of the twentieth century with their unmistakably original writing styles. In this course, we will examine selected texts of these three writers in order to gain better insights into each writer‚Äôs uniqueness of voice, purpose, and place within French twentieth-century literature. We will also discuss the extent to which the writing voices of these literary women have contributed to the transformation not only of literature but of the image and the role of French women (as daughters, adolescents, mothers, artists, writers, thinkers, self-supporting, independent and active members of French society) from the turn of the century, with Colette, up to the last years of the twentieth century, with Duras and Sarraute.

No\n\nFrench 541: Rousseau and the Enlightenment\n\nAt first sight, the work of J.-J. Rousseau appears to be marked by generic diversity and myriad self-contradictions, seemingly reflecting the multifaceted intellectual career of the man who composed it: the adventurer, dreamer, bel esprit, cultural theorist and critic, philosopher, antiphilosopher, literary artist, anti-artist, moralist, immoralist, feminist, anti-feminist, musician, political theorist, misanthrope, pessimist, idealist, and so on. But does this diversity render all questions of a unified vision impertinent? Broadly speaking, the weaving together in one corpus of political theory and instances of \"pure\" literary invention, of metaphysical speculations on the origins and destiny of human society and institutions, and complex and usually moving accounts of his own personal, unique, if problematic, involvement in that destiny: these factors act in concert to give Rousseau's work its enduring challenging and stimulating quality. It is hardly surprising then that his work continues to engage the attention of some of the most prominent minds‚Äîstructuralists (e.g. Levi-Strauss), philosophers (Gouhier, Derrida), literary theorists (De Man, Starobinski), and feminist critics (Kofman, Irigaray), to name only a few‚Äîin the human and social sciences today. More interestingly for our purposes, the work combines a theory and radical critique of language and representation in general with an unrelenting \"existentialist\" reflection on issues of political and social ethics. How do these two movements interact? Adopting a primarily \"literary\" approach to this corpus, we shall attempt‚Äîthrough readings selected from both theoretical and fictional works‚Äîto arrive at an understanding of how the two challenge and/or complement each other. We shall also attempt to trace the extent of their involvement with the French Enlightenment movement in its ideological struggle with the Ancien Regime, and identify ways in which they bear on theoretical issues in our contemporary literary culture.\n\nNOTES: Course taught in French.

We will examine the cultural and political contexts of their emergence and explore how and why they became productive literary types. In studying their aesthetic implications, we will examine in particular to what extent they constituted a challenge (or not) to various forms of authority in nineteenth-century France. Readings from Balzac, M√©rim√©e, Vigny, Gautier, Baudelaire, Desbordes-Valmore, Rimbaud, Verlaine, Murger, Vall√®s and Brillat-Savarin.

Event 0 and Life is Strange are two adventure games (cinematic) with puzzles to solve, while Valiant Hearts is more of an action-platformer that requires combat and strategy. Our class discussions and your assignments will focus on your progression through these games, which have varying degrees of immersion, as well as their cultural specificities. This course will also look closely at the figure of the hero in these video games, as well as the treatment of violence and the epic nature of some form of heroization and the transmission of its values.\n\nNOTES: Course taught in French.

We will explore various aesthetic and epistemological functions of exoticism and the problems and paradoxes it raises in its evolution as a romantic, realist, and decadent topos. We will pay particular attention to the problems of representing difference and the unknown, the role of the exoticizing gaze with respect to subjectivity and nineteenth-century discourses of identity‚Äîracial, gender, class, and national‚Äîand the broader cultural and political uses and abuses of exoticism in a globalizing nineteenth-century France.

We will study the cultural and historical contexts in which literatures on and for children were created, as well as how they reflected and shaped the values and attitude of French society towards childhood. Our study will include works such as the following: Saint Exup√©ry, Le Petit Prince; Perrault‚Äôs Contes de ma m√®re l‚ÄôOye; Vall√®s, L‚ÄôEnfant; Goscinny, Le Petit Nicolas; Cocteau, Les Enfants terribles; Christiane Rochefort, Les Petits enfants du si√®cle; Mourlevat, L‚ÄôEnfant oc√©an. We will analyze how these texts were influenced by their time and how they themselves influenced children‚Äôs literature and the idea of childhood in France. We will examine recurring themes such as innocence, self-discovery, imagination, and the relationship between the child and the adult world. We will also explore the various techniques used by the authors to convey their messages and how these techniques have evolved over time. Students will develop an understanding of the intersections between childhood, language, and identity in French literature. Selected critical texts drawing on a variety of theoretical perspectives will allow students to analyze the way in which French literary childhood reflects and shapes broader discourses related to education, socialization, the concept of the self, and that of family, as well as to critically examine the ways in which these discourses perpetuate or challenge prevalent structures. Taught in French, though students outside of French and Francophone Studies may write their papers in English.\n\nNOTES: Course taught in French.

No\n\nFrench 627: Renaissance Poetry\n\nThe purpose of this course is to examine, through a series of close textual analyses, the attempts made by poets around 1550 to find modalities for self-expression in their quest for a new poetic language. Emphasis will be placed on the problematic nature of self-identity as a key to expressivity in the cultural and historical contexts when national literatures aim at reflecting and influencing major ideological and political changes (humanism, Evangelism and the Reformation, patriotism and the rise of the absolute monarchy). We will also consider the role of gender in the shaping of poetic identities. Among the poets to be considered are Cl√©ment Marot, Marguerite de Navarre, Maurice Sc√®ve, Pernette du Guillet, Louise Lab√©, Joachim du Bellay, Pierre de Ronsard, and Agrippa d'Aubign√©.\n\nNOTES: Course taught in French.

Specific topics will vary and may focus on a specific movement, author, or theme. Current topic: The Realist Movement. Still perceived as a ‚Äúminor‚Äù genre at the end of the eighteenth century, the novel quickly emerged as the modern literary form of choice in the years following the French Revolution. In this course, we will trace the evolution of the novel with respect to the broad contexts of nineteenth-century French history and culture. We will focus in particular on the rise of French realism and its relation to the development of modernity in France, examining the treatment of such key themes as education and initiation, revolution, money and the commercialization of culture, criminality, urban spaces, the changing roles of class and gender in French society, and the emerging contours of modern identity‚Äîalong with its distinctively modern pathologies (alienation, boredom, addiction). We will also look at critical debates from the period on the nature of literary realism, as well as take up the question of realist representation in the visual arts, examining relevant work by artists, caricaturists, and photographers. Taught in French, though students outside of French Studies may write their papers in English.\n\nNOTES: Course taught in French. Usually offered every two to three years.\n\nPREREQUISITES: Open to graduate students (usually cross-listed with French 455 for undergraduates).\n\nCREDITS: 3\n\nCURRENTLY OFFERED?

Specific topics will vary and may focus on a specific movement, author, or theme. Current topic: The Invention of the Modern. \"Il faut √™tre absolument moderne,\" writes Rimbaud in Une saison en enfer. Against the rise of the novel, which quickly established itself in the years following the French Revolution as the preeminent literary form of the \"modern,\" French poetry had to reinvent itself to maintain its relevance in a France undergoing rapid political, social, and economic change. In this seminar, we will trace the evolution of French poetry in the nineteenth century with respect to the broader contexts of French history and culture. We will examine in particular the major poetic movements of the century (romanticism, the \"Parnassian\" group and the concept of \"l'art pour l'art,\" symbolism) and their links with several key themes of modernity: revolution, nature, changing notions of the good and the beautiful, money and the commodification of culture, urban spaces (the street, the crowd, the arcade, the barricade, urbanism, and architecture), the exotic, love and desire, and the appearance of the \"modern\" identity, together with its distinctly modern pathologies (alienation, boredom, nostalgia, addiction). Taught in French, though students outside of French and Francophone Studies may write their papers in English.\n\nNOTES: Course taught in French. Usually offered every two to three years.\n\nPREREQUISITES: Open to graduate students (usually cross-listed with French 457 for undergraduates).\n\nCREDITS: 3\n\nCURRENTLY OFFERED? No\n\nFrench 665: 20th-Century Novel\n\nCharacterized by experimentation and by the crisis of representation, the French novel underwent numerous transformations in form, content, and boundaries throughout the 20th century. In this course, we will place these transformations in context as we discuss movements such as modernism, existentialism, the nouveau roman, and postmodernism.\n\nTopis for Spring 2025: \"French Women Writers\" In the 21st century, we think of literature produced by women, in French or in any language, as nothing out of the ordinary. In fact, even asking the question ‚ÄúWhy do women write?‚Äù would today be considered by most of us to be as strange as it would have been to ask ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt (more) women write?‚Äù in George Sand‚Äôs 19th century. Of course, French women have been writing since at least the 12th century when Marie de France wrote her Lais. Yet, when we examine a comprehensive list of French women writers, there is no denying that most of the authors‚Äô names belong to women writers of the 20th century. So what happened in the 20th century? As we read the works of some of France‚Äôs best-known authors, who happen to be women, we will discuss, among other things, the socio-economic conditions that made it possible, and sometimes necessary, for women to write in the 20th century. Which key historical events took place in 20th century France that made writing by women possible, necessary, vital, transformative? Why did women decide to pick up the pen to write when they did, and how has this deliberate act transformed the intellectual, social, political, cultural and literary landscape of France over the course of the 20th century? As we read and discuss the novels, short stories, plays or autofictions of, for example, Colette, de Beauvoir, Nemirovsky, Sarraute, Duras, Delbo, Ernaux, Gavalda, Saumont and others, we will think about the wide-ranging impact that these unique female voices have had on literature in France since the Belle √âpoque.\n\nNOTES: Course taught in French.
