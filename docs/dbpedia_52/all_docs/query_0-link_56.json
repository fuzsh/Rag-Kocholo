        "text": "This paper explores the notion of the exhibition as an opportunity to reveal and enhance meaning thus creating a reflective space where viewer and artwork dialogue and relate with each other. Using as example the practice of Portuguese sculptor Alberto Carneiro (b. 1937), it will analyze key features of his work and suggest ways to expand them into the exhibition space. The work of Alberto Carneiro can be described as highly conceptual while grounded in a strong materiality. Carneiro’s work is often site-related and his installation pieces are usually preceded by what the artist himself designates by project-drawings. The graph paper sheets that Carneiro uses for his project-drawings are filled with records that elucidate about the concepts inherent to the origin of the work as well as about its installation in the exhibition space: drawings of details from the work, references to the materials used, schemes of the spatial distribution of the elements, possible trajectories for the viewer, dimensions of some parts, sentences and thoughts of the artist. All aspects in these complex project-drawings concur to reveal the profound thinking process behind them. The subsequent installation artworks, which typically bring natural elements such as trees, rocks or fruits into the museum, are, then, the materialization of that deep investigation about space and its relations with each element of the artwork and the body and mind of both the artist and the viewer. One of the common aspects between the two devices, project-drawings and installation artworks, is the use of the word as a means to establish a dialogue with the viewer: not only in the titles which directly address him/her, but also annotations in the project-drawings or sentences present in some installation artworks. All call upon the presence of the viewer in the space shared by him/her and the artwork, as well as the viewers’ experiences in nature (walking, lying in grass, picking up fruit). It is this communicability inherent to the genesis of both project-drawings and installations that I believe can be potentiated with the simultaneous exhibition of the two. However, although obviously connected, project-drawings and installations are independent works: they belong to different collections and as a rule are exhibited separately. By taking the exhibition as a reflective space, this paper analyzes how the confrontation between the project-drawings and the installation artworks can potentiate new dialogues and perspectives about them, enhancing that communicability which was one of the artist’s goals in the first place. I will start to present the works which will be used as examples, and then explore the potential new readings that using the exhibition as medium could create. Taking the exhibition as a privileged space where to materialize the concepts explored in the project-drawings, the artist himself renders each re-installation as a new experience. If, as Carneiro states, “The drawing is not made as something which prepares sculpture, but as a means which favors its developments” , then their simultaneous exhibition will always create a new space for reflection and deeper understanding of the artist’s concepts, intentions and artistic processes."
