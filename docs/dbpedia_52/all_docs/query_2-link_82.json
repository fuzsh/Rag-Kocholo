        "text": "REVOLUTION IN TASTE: FRANCIS HASKELL’S NINETEENTH CENTURY\n\nA two-day conference is to be held at St Johns College, Oxford and the Ashmolean Museum to explore the work of art historian Francis Haskell (1928-2000). Writing at the intersection of cultural history, art history and the history of ideas, Haskell made a seminal contribution to the study of the formation of taste in nineteenth-century Britain and Europe.\n\nThe conference will revisit terrain mapped out by Haskell in Rediscoveries in Art, namely the transformation of the art world between the 1770s and 1870s, a period when war, revolution, plunder and state-formation brought fundamental changes to the knowledge of and trade in Old Master paintings. Distinguished speakers include scholars and curators from Britain, France and Italy, include:\n\nNicholas Penny, Charles Hope, Jeremy Warren, Charles Sebag-Montefiore, Susanna Avery-Quash, Donata Levi, Charlotte Guichard, Bénédicte Savoy, Véronique Gérard-Powell, Jon Whiteley, Pauline Prévost-Marcilhacy, Dora Thornton, Pascal Griener, Juliet Simpson, Stephen Bann, Xanthe Brooke, Camille Mathieu, Silvia Davoli, Cecilia Hurley Griener, Richard Wrigley, Tom Stammers, Stephen Lloyd, Jenny Graham\n\nThe conference aims to comprehend the forces which transformed how art was acquired, displayed and interpreted in the nineteenth century. But it will also grapple with the methodological and philosophical issues raised by Haskell’s provocative approach to the history of collecting.\n\nBoth days of the conference will be held in the auditorium of St Johns College, Oxford. Delegates at the conference will receive lunch, teas and coffee, and a wine reception at the Ashmolean on Friday 23rd from 18.00-19.30 (this event is free although places are limited so it is essential to register). The fee for attending both days is £80 for professionals (£35 for students); the cost of attending for just one day is £45 for professionals (£20 for students).\n\nRegistration is now closed online but there are spaces available to purchase on the door. For further information and inquiries, please contact the organizer Dr Tom Stammers (t.e.stammers durham.ac.uk).\n\nPROGRAMME:\n\nFRIDAY:\n\n9.30-10.00- Registration\n\n10.00- Welcome remarks (Tom Stammers)\n\n10.10- Keynote 1: Nicholas Penny\n\nChair: Craig Clunas\n\n11.-12.30- Session 1: Rediscoveries in Post-Revolutionary Europe\n\nChair: Christina Anderson\n\nCharlotte Guichard, ‘Naming the Artist: Attribution and Artistic Expertise at the end of the Eighteenth Century’\n\nXanthe Brooke, ‘William Roscoe (1753-1831) and his collection of north European Renaissance art in Liverpool’\n\nVéronique Gerard-Powell, ‘The Altamira collection and the Sale of Spanish Art in London’\n\n12.30-13.30 Lunch\n\n13.30-15.00- Session 2: Art and Interpretation in Nineteenth-Century France\n\nChair: Frances Suzman Jowell\n\nCamille Mathieu, ‘Breaking Up the Musuem of Rome: Mobility and the Antique in the Napoleonic Era, 1796-1817’\n\nRichard Wrigley, ‘Ingres’ Monsieur Bertin and the Vicissitudes of Bourgeois Taste’\n\nJuliet Simpson, ‘Reimagining the Northern Nineteenth Century: Art and the Politics of Patrimony in the French Third Republic’\n\n15.00-15.30 Coffee\n\n15.30-17.00- Session 3: Private Palaces of Art\n\nChair: Arthur Macgregor\n\nSusanna Avery-Quash, 'Rediscovering John Julius Angerstein's 'other' art collection at 'Woodlands', Blackheath'\n\nStephen Lloyd, 'From Venice to Knowsley: the rediscovery and conservation of Borgognone's series of paintings on silver-gilt leather, The Children of Israel'\n\nPauline Prévost-Marcilhacy, ‘The Pereire brothers and collecting in the Second Empire’\n\n17.15- Keynote 2: Charles Hope\n\nChair: Geraldine Johnson\n\n18.00- Wine Reception at the Ashmolean\n\n19.30- Dinner at the Ashmolean Restaurant\n\nSATURDAY\n\n9.30-9.45- Registration\n\n9.45-Keynote 3: Stephen Bann\n\nChair: Julia Langbein\n\n10.30.-12.00 Session 4: History, Images and Criticism\n\nChair: Ludmilla Jordanova\n\nDonata Levi, ‘Rediscovering Crowe’\n\nJenny Graham, ‘Afterlives: Rewriting Giorgio Vasari in the Nineteenth Century’\n\nJon Whiteley, ‘Francis Haskell and Nineteenth-Century French Art’\n\n12.30-13.30 Lunch\n\n13.00-14.30 Session 5: Exhibitions and Ephemeral Museums\n\nChair: Linda Whiteley\n\nJeremy Warren, ‘A Nineteenth-Century Phenomenon: The Birth of the New Kunstkammer’\n\nCécilia Hurley Griener, ‘Juggling with Masterpieces in the Long Nineteenth Century’\n\nBénédicte Savoy, ‘Estimer l'inestimable.
