        "text": "Although we can infer Savot’s year and place of birth—ca. 1579, at Saulieu, diocese of Autun, in Burgundy—from other biographical evidence, his origins still await definitive proof.16 Strange as it may seem, the first event documented with certainty in his life is the release of his French translation of Galen’s On Treatment by Bloodletting (1603), toward the end of his four-year study for the bachelor’s degree at the Faculty of Medicine in Paris.17 This translation was far more than a mere scholastic exercise: the prefatory “Discours” that accompanied the treatise, dedicated to the doctors of the Faculty, defended the ancient practice of venesection, which supporters of Paracelsus’s chemical philosophy had sought to undermine, along with humoral medicine, for a quarter of a century.18 Savot’s plea for Galenic medicine firmly upheld the Faculty’s doctrine and supported its opposition to alternate views. His defense was not devoid of irony, however, for here he promoted a resolute commitment to practice (empeiria) as an approach that the university had yet abandoned to the mechanical arts, or even condemned outright. As we will see, Savot’s advocacy of practice would soon be turned against him.\n\nIn light of this, one cannot overemphasize the significance of the earliest notarized deed that bears Savot’s signature, a previously unnoticed apprenticeship contract that highlights the fundamental role of practice in shaping Savot’s medical training as well as his subsequent architectural thought. This apprenticeship also prefigured a major shift in Savot’s career, from public to private medical practice.\n\nThe contract, dated 2 May 1605, specifies that Savot was already a “bachelor” of medicine when he began his training in surgery, thus disproving Blondel’s claim that Savot came to Paris intending to study surgery (a mechanical art) but then changed course to pursue medicine. The apprenticeship was confirmed, “for one year, by Pierre Corbilly, sworn master surgeon in Paris, residing on rue Neuve Notre Dame, who would teach his trade, lodge, and feed said Savot” for a payment of 120 livres.19 While the deed does not mention Corbilly’s prestigious post as chief surgeon (1603–6) at the nearby Hôtel Dieu hospital in Paris, it provides other key indications that help to clarify Savot’s situation.20 First, it shows that Savot was a tenant of relatively modest means, not an owner, as is usually surmised based on another contract that he signed later that year for chimney decoration at the same address.21 Second, his internship occurred, consistent with the Faculty’s curriculum, after he had received the baccalaureate degree but prior to his obtaining the medical license.22 While prospective physicians were expected to understand the treatments that they prescribed (e.g., bloodletting, medication), only subordinate specialists—surgeons, barbers, apothecaries, herbalists—were expected to perform procedures or prepare drugs. Contemporary medical statutes strictly forbade physicians to participate in the mechanical arts subserving their profession.23\n\nYet, from his earliest training to his final publications, Savot remained true to the Galenic definition of medicine as an art requiring both empeiria (empiricism, experience, practice) and logos (reason, ratio, method, discourse). Moreover, for Galen, empeiria and logos represented the fundamental “instruments of discovery” for all “objects of enquiry” in both the liberal and the mechanical arts.24 They required integrating natural history with techniques, as Savot would shortly advocate in L’architecture.\n\nIn the meantime, he applied this same approach to his inquiry into the natural causes of colors, the subject of a study that he published in 1609 while preparing for his license.25 To elaborate this “new-ancient” view, Savot examined Greco-Latin and Arabic sources in natural history and philosophy on colors by applying an expanded critical lens informed by early modern publications on optics, astronomy, plants, and philology.26 Also, as Charles Parkhurst notes, Savot referred to the material practices of painters, dyers, glassmakers, and other artisans that he witnessed firsthand in Parisian workshops.27 However, careful analysis reveals that, despite Savot’s thorough use of philology, which involved sensory experience, his research was more practice driven than theory oriented. His work stemmed from a pragmatic vein of medical humanism that sought to establish a more efficient nomenclature of colors based on both their materiality and historicity. The chief applications of such work included medicinal preparations as well as the interpretation of chromatic signs in the practice of uroscopy and hematoscopy.28\n\nBeyond questioning Blondel’s representation of Savot’s formal education pathway as surgery-to-medicine rather than medicine-cum-surgery, we might also challenge another misleading statement. The academician alleged that Savot was ranked sixth at graduation, a great disappointment given that only the top five licentiates qualified for doctoral studies. He concluded that therefore, “out of spite,” Savot “turned away from the practice of medicine, withdrawing into things natural.”29 After consulting the works of various authors, from Pliny the Elder (Natural History) to Vitruvius (De architectura), along with modern architectural literature, Savot became “very skilled in the science of buildings.”30 Blondel contrasted the physician’s literary trajectory with the career of Charles Bouvard (1572–1658), who received the bachelor’s degree in medicine the same year as Savot but later practiced with greater success as premier médecin du roi (1628–43).31\n\nYet a close reading of Bouvard’s Historicæ hodiernæ medicinæ rationalis veritatis (1655) discloses a different, more infamous sequence of events. The chronicle describes Savot as one of the victims of a modern medicine that had abandoned the empirical, rational, and methodic practice of Hippocrates and Galen. Bouvard deplored the decision of the Faculty’s “dogmatists” to sanction “many doctors, such as Savot,” for not observing the stern divisions imposed between professions. As a result, Savot was “crossed out of the list of doctors for going to the hospital to practice surgery with his own hand.”32 Historically, the term docteur applied strictly to physicians (médecins) who held a doctorate, and under some circumstances, the Faculty could suspend or even rescind the degree.33 In order to have lost his doctorate, Savot must previously have been awarded the corresponding diploma.\n\nThe ultimate degree in medical education, the doctorate was not required for practicing—it was needed only for teaching (régenter). Nor was it necessary for acquiring the prestigious office of médecin ordinaire du roi, a status Savot boasted on the title pages of his 1624 and 1627 publications. This charge might involve no more than occasional counseling to the king’s medical household and, in this instance, a modest pension.34 Its true value lay in the social standing and the protection it provided as it loosened the university’s hold on physicians. In Savot’s case, it helped to wipe out a stigma. But when and where did he obtain the funds and connections necessary to secure this appointment if, as Blondel asserted, he quit practice and his only friends were physicians and Faculty professors Philibert Guybert (1579–1633) and René Moreau (1587–1656)?35\n\nUntil this point, historians have identified only one potential patient of Savot, Antoine Coiffier Ruzé d’Effiat (1581–1632), Marquis of Effiat and Chilly, and they have neglected the scope of the relationship between the two men (Figure 3). Born to the lower nobility of Auvergne, Ruzé d’Effiat rose to power during the ministry of Cardinal Richelieu (1624–42). He was successively made superintendent of finances (1626–32), grand master of artillery (1629–32), governor of Bourbonnais and Auvergne (1630), and, finally, marshal of France (1631).36 Several documents relating to building projects on estates belonging to the marquis attest to his connection with Savot.\n\nIn 1627, Savot signed two contracts for quarry stone to be supplied at the château of Chilly, south of Paris (Figure 4).37 Four years later, he certified a receipt for frieze ornaments for a terrace wall at the château of Effiat (Auvergne) (Figure 5).38 The 1627 contracts state that Savot resided at Ruzé d’Effiat’s Paris hôtel, on Rue Saint-Thomas du Louvre. In other words, the superintendent of finances pensioned the physician whom he consulted and trusted for his health as well as for his buildings. Indeed, Ruzé d’Effiat’s unexpected death in July 1632 soon caused financial trouble for Savot, as Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc (1580–1637) suggested in his letters.39\n\nSavot’s involvement in reconstruction works at Chilly and Effiat has elicited only a few comments from scholars, chiefly concerned with whether or not the theoretical recommendations of L’architecture were applied in the designs provided for these sites first by Clément II Métezeau (1581–1652) and then by Jacques Lemercier (1585–1654), both of whom occupied the position of architecte ordinaire du roi. However, the physician’s contribution to Ruzé d’Effiat’s projects should point as much to the converse, antecedent path that not only led to his “theorization” of architectural practice but also entitled him to deal with professionals. Certainly, on both sites, building did not start until after the publication of L’architecture (1624), but operations were already under way as of 1621, when Ruzé d’Effiat initiated land acquisition and the development of hydraulic infrastructure.40 Most important, evidence suggests that Savot was long acquainted with Lemercier, whose first patron for civil architecture was none other than an earlier patient of his.\n\nThe identity of this patient, Pierre Jeannin (1540–1623), surfaces from the comparison of four different documents: a wedding contract, a technical description, a cleric’s biography, and a freethinker’s memoirs (Figure 6). On 8 June 1622, Savot, as “conseiller and médecin du roi,” stood witness to the marriage of Claude Aubert, a “resident at Président Jeannin’s hôtel.”41 Readers of L’architecture may recollect that this name is mentioned in the description of a hydraulic machine that Savot reproduced from a text sent by a master at the slate mines of Angers to “the late Monseigneur Président Jeanin.”42 However, such indications only start to make sense thanks to the writings of Minim Friar Hilarion de Coste. Among those “famous for their knowledge” who “habitually” visited the great savant Marin Mersenne (1588–1648), Coste noted the presence of “the late Mr Savot, Physician of the late Mr le Président Jeannin.”43 Two decades later, skeptic philosopher François de La Mothe Le Vayer (1588–1672) corroborated Savot’s medical rapport with Jeannin. Recalling Savot’s conversations among select assemblies at the prestigious Cabinet Dupuy, Le Vayer linked him to Jeannin, the same long-gone, famous patient, whose prominent social standing and political career provide a key to contextualizing Savot’s interest in the art of building.44\n\nSon of a bourgeois tanner and councilman of Autun, Pierre Jeannin rose to the highest ranks in the royal administration thanks to his education at the University of Bourges, an institution at the epicenter of a law reform grounded in philology and historical critique when he attended it from 1560 to 1567.45 There, Jeannin studied under Jacques Cujas (1522–90), a leading figure of legal humanism, and alongside other colleagues who contributed to the juridical foundations of absolutism.46 In due course, Jeannin’s training will also support Savot’s legal approach to construction.\n\nJeannin served at Dijon as jurisconsult and mentor to the young Charles de Guise (1554–1611), Duke of Mayenne and governor of Burgundy. If during a period of civil war the lawyer’s political positions were less clear than he later proclaimed, thanks to his success in peace negotiations, however, he received an appointment as président (1580) in the Parlement of Burgundy from King Henri III (1551–89).47 Fifteen years later, he convinced Mayenne, then leader of the Catholic League, to rally with Henri IV (1553–1610). As a result, the king asked Jeannin to join the Conseil d’État (1596), the center of legislative, executive, and judicial power, a favor followed by cumulative appointments to the Conseil des Finances (1598) and the Conseil Étroit (1602).48 In turn, Marie de’ Medici named Jeannin controller-general of finances during her regency (1611–16). Finally, Louis XIII made Jeannin superintendent of finances (1617–19).49 Jeannin’s steady rise to social prominence would have important consequences for Savot’s career.\n\nIn seventeenth-century France, a private physician was a member of his patient’s household.50 A patient who was an influential figure offered the physician prestige and protection. Conversely, the fame that a physician acquired through publications enhanced his patient’s standing. Savot undoubtedly owed the purchase of his office as médecin du roi and his introduction to architecture to Jeannin. Buildings indeed represented the main “inclination” that Président Jeannin admitted, the only “vanity” that he confessed, and they consumed all the “benefits and wealth” he received from the monarchs he served.51 Were Jeannin still alive and in office, Savot certainly would have dedicated L’architecture to him, rather than to Charles de La Vieuville (1583–1653), the short-lived superintendent of finances (1623–24) and protector of Ruzé d’Effiat.52\n\nSome of Savot’s primary encounters with architecture may be reconstructed in relation to Jeannin’s private undertakings and public responsibilities as early as 1614. Among these, the positions he held in finances involved the assessment and endorsement of accounts and needs of the Bâtiments du Roi.53 In this context, after Henri IV’s death and the resignation of his chief minister, Maximilien de Béthune (1559–1641), Duke of Sully, Jeannin oversaw public projects, occasionally organizing meetings with designers and builders at his home in Paris.54 His investment could be more personal still, as with the concession he took over from Sully to complete the Place Dauphine in Paris (1607–14) (Figure 7).55 This trapezoid square opened onto the Pont Neuf platform, overlooking the newly reconfigured banks of the Seine. And, following the queen’s instigation in 1604, an imposing equestrian statue of Henri IV executed in bronze was planned to occupy this strategic site (Figure 8).\n\nConcurrently, a Discours by Savot addressed the royal monument as its subject.56 While the published text is undated, it appears that it was written between 23 August 1614, the date of the statue’s dedication, and 2 June 1615, the date of the pedestal’s foundation stone. During this period, Pierre Francqueville, premier sculpteur du roi (1548–1615), “at present, working alone on the pedestal’s ornaments,” showed Savot “a model” of the monument at his studio.57\n\nThe twenty-four-page Discours contrasts starkly with the other, shorter texts submitted to the open competition held for the pedestal’s inscriptions from 1614 to 1620. Savot’s essay stands out both for its threefold ambition to address theoretical, documentary, and historiographic aspects of the project and for its uneven structure. Indeed, its latter half consists of a summary of Henri IV’s life that Savot meant “to serve for inscription,” but, oddly enough, he deemed his own proposal to be unsuitable for the monument as it was too long. It seems that he drew on the draft of an unfinished biography that Jeannin was supposed to write upon the request of Henri IV and of which only the introduction was ever completed and published. This source is clearly suggested, throughout Savot’s text, by his consistent eulogizing of the président’s achievements in politics, public policy, and finances.58 In all likelihood, the physician received the commission for this Discours from Jeannin in the name of the Conseil du Roi, which, alongside the Bâtiments, monitored the monument’s proceedings.59 In any case, from this moment onward, Savot could gain insight into building practices thanks to the private projects undertaken by his aging yet remarkably energetic patient.\n\nIn addition to urban mansions in Autun and Dijon, Jeannin owned a hôtel in Paris, on Rue du Coq-Héron, where Savot would have lived. In turn, Savot would follow his patient to the so-called Maison de Grammont, situated to the west of Paris on the Chaillot hillside; the house, which lately belonged to Catherine de’ Medici, was relentlessly restructured by the président from 1613 to 1623 (Figure 9).60\n\nBut Jeannin’s most ambitious enterprise was his estate at Montjeu, on the hills south of Autun. Upon joining the Conseil in 1596, he acquired the old seigneurial mansion, which he reconstructed from 1609 to 1612.61 In 1611, while traveling in Burgundy, Jesuit architect Etienne Martellange (1569–1641) made a drawing of the new moated château under construction (Figure 10). Designed by an unknown architect, the structure conformed to the then-common type that Savot later described at length in L’architecture (chapters 5–28). Its three-winged composition, organized around an inner courtyard, featured four corner pavilions and a lower terrace-roofed gallery (no longer extant). Following its completion, the président began to assemble a productive domain that eventually comprised about 800 hectares of fields, woodlands, and artificial lakes, a process that required not only extensive funding but also complex legal procedures and transactions (Figure 11).62\n\nAlthough we still lack evidence for Savot’s presence at Montjeu, even as a physician accompanying his patient, it is hard to imagine that he would not have participated in discussions about the project held at Jeannin’s Parisian hôtel during the preparation of L’architecture. The estate layout conformed to the spatial type—determined by manorial economy—that Savot formulated in his treatise (chapters 3 and 29–32).63 This landscape layout type featured canals, pools, or terraces, as dictated by site conditions, to create visually open limits between well-separated and yet articulated gardens and parks (these last differentiated according to land use and qualities of soil) (Figure 12; see Figure 5).64\n\nA well-known perspective view (Scénografie du chasteau de Montjeu)—which Alexandre Gady attributes to Lemercier and dates to ca. 1619–20—presents Montjeu’s pleasure grounds in an ideal state of completion (Figure 13).65 Here the gardens are separated by terraces from a park that features bosquets, arbors, and turreted enclosure walls. This precinct in turn is contained within another extensive woodland park (“grand bois”). The fine colored wash, however, was neither an ex novo proposal nor a final design, as demonstrated through the graphic reconstruction of three significant phases based on documentary and material evidence: (a) what Martellange saw on the ground (1611), (b) what Lemercier projected on paper (1619–20), and (c) what structures were eventually built (pre-1670s) and surveyed (1817) (Figure 14).66\n\nOne of the lateral twin terrace gardens intended by Lemercier to border a trapezoid esplanade already appeared in the 1611 view, where it clearly formed an angle with a tree line parallel to the axis of the château. Martellange’s sketch is misleading, as he privileged the château and did not leave enough space on the page to depict the garden properly, its actual proportions being inverted. Thus Martellange rendered the garden’s rectangular layout as if it were a square and its compartments as long rectangles. The proportional interchange may be deduced from the identical positions of the four-lobed fountain and central arbor in both views.67\n\nThe diachronic reconstruction shows that Lemercier’s Scénografie integrated recently built structures with others that were planned but never realized, or were executed differently. Grading, earthworks, water features, and the road network eventually materialized in novel ways until at least 1670.68 While such an open-ended process suggests we should reconsider Lemercier’s role in designing the landscape at Montjeu, he nevertheless received building commissions from the président for the château of Dracy-Saint-Loup (1618), north of Autun, as well as for the service quarters at Montjeu (1620).69 It would therefore be reasonable to hypothesize that, when later overseeing contracts for Ruzé d’Effiat’s projects, Savot was acting not only as his legal representative but also as someone long acquainted with the designer’s methods and teams. The same goes for the marquis.\n\nIn February 1627, construction started at Chilly a few months after the physician had dedicated his Discours on ancient medals to Ruzé d’Effiat.70 As Savot himself states, he devoted six years of study to this final and longest opus (four hundred pages).71 Overlapping with the preparation of L’architecture, it sheds light on the content of that earlier publication as well as on further pivotal encounters in its author’s life.\n\nIn the dedication of the Discours sur les medalles Savot acknowledged both his obligation to and his affection for a dignitary whom he claimed to serve in public as well as in private. This implied Savot had already advised his patient for some time regarding a variety of matters, including art collections.72 More crucially, however, Savot emphasized how the concurrence of two of Ruzé d’Effiat’s major offices made him the ideal patron to support the enduring concerns of a physician regarding the chromatic, medicinal, and metrological aspects of minerals, metals, and alloys.\n\nNot only had Ruzé d’Effiat recently become superintendent of finances, he also had inherited in 1613, along with land and name, the charge of grand-maître des mines et minières from his granduncle Martin Ruzé de Beaulieu (ca. 1526–1613).73 The latter was secretary of state of the Maison du Roi, whose purview included the Bâtiments du Roi. His position as grand master of mines related to resources, coinage, and finances, then under Jeannin’s control. It helped secure Ruzé d’Effiat’s 1610 marriage to Marie de Fourcy (1589–1670), daughter of Jean de Fourcy (1558–1625), long-standing intendant (1594–1622) and superintendent (1622–25) of the Bâtiments du Roi.74\n\nWell-endowed with land and other assets, Marie de Fourcy brought to her union the knowledge and vast clientele of her father, to whom Jeannin had every reason to recommend Savot when he reported on the Pont Neuf monument. And meetings with Fourcy or other Bâtiments appointees might have occurred informally, at the Ruzé d’Effiats’ Paris home.\n\nIndeed, in 1614 the couple rented two floors in the hôtel that Claude Chastillon (ca. 1570–1616), ingénieur du roi, had built on the recently developed Place Royale (1605–12) (Figure 15).75 Chastillon’s mansion happened to adjoin the hôtel that Jeannin’s daughter, Charlotte, and her husband, Pierre de Castille, possessed on a lot that the président, like other owners, had received from the king.76 This proximity may explain Savot’s discussion of the Place Royale’s construction type and cost in L’architecture.77 This also suggests Savot may have had access to a unique iconographic corpus.\n\nChastillon retained an apartment in the attic of his hôtel where he kept most of the preparatory drawings, copperplates, and prints for the approximately five hundred pictures that would appear in his posthumously published Topographie françoise, with framed and painted versions mounted on the walls.78 This collection included the most wide-ranging visual documentation of French architecture, urbanism, and designed landscapes of the period. First circulating as unbound sheets, it comprised among others the famous view of the Place de France designed by Chastillon and Jacques Aleaume (1562–1627), mathematician and ingénieur du roi, whom Savot later solicited regarding weights of construction materials (Figure 16).79La topographie also featured innumerable “ancient” and “à la moderne” private country seats, each presenting a different, site-specific combination of château with the garden–canal–park scheme prescribed in L’architecture. A case in point is Ruzé de Beaulieu’s original château of Chilly, which Chastillon drew before it was destroyed by fire in January 1611 (Figure 17).\n\nWhether Savot and Chastillon met in person remains an open question that deserves further consideration. However, other circumstances involving Savot’s patron-patients and their entourages, which will not be discussed here, indicate that La topographie’s visual catalogue of regional sites may well have informed L’architecture’s typological approach.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of Savot’s early career, we can now take a fresh look at the first chapter of his architectural treatise. Although scholars have overlooked this opening section, it is critical to our understanding of Savot’s approach to the art of building, as it unfolded between two disciplines that had evolved in opposite directions since 1550. On the one hand, alternative knowledge systems and professional practices, including iatrochemistry and surgery, challenged academic Galenism. On the other, the figure of the humanist designer had just begun to be distinguished from that of the master builder, while as a profession architecture still lacked formal recognition and an academy.80\n\nIn this context or social space, the thwarted surgeon proclaims, from the title of his first chapter: “There is no profession that makes us more capable of Architecture than that of Medicine.”81 To explain this statement, Savot uses a syllogism knitting together a few themes that Vitruvius had addressed in separate books in De architectura: the disciplinary definition of architecture as well as the architect’s qualification (1.1, 1.3) and the natural principles and physical characteristics of building materials (2.2–10). Savot does not address here any of the predictable analogies between human anatomy and building layout, structure, or ornament.82 Nor does he touch on hygienics, as he does elsewhere throughout the treatise regarding site, orientation, sunlight, ventilation, or heating. Rather, in this first chapter he tackles the epistemological relationship between two fields of practice: architecture and medicine.\n\nA compound premise constitutes the syllogism’s major proposition: “All trades or mechanical arts can be divided in two kinds,” the first consisting in “preparing stuffs” (“estoffes,” or materials) and the second in “shaping, cutting, and arranging them” (giving form), as actions typically intended for “either the structure or the ornament of a building.”83 In the following proposition Savot states that the first set of trades “requires a notice of the quality, nature, and difference of materials,” whereas the second involves “knowledge of measures, forms, and proportions,” with these provisions pertaining, respectively, to “Physiology, the science of natural causes” (physiologia) and “Mathematics” (critical to diagnosis and therapeutics).84 In conclusion, “there is nobody of any profession more capable of the intelligence of Architecture than the Physician, who is well educated in these two fundamental sciences of his art” (physiology and mathematics).85 To reinforce his thesis, Savot reminds the reader that Galen, whom he does not call by his name but mentions as the “most divine,” received architectural instruction from his father, a practicing architect.86\n\nInevitably the stuff–form binary of Savot’s argument evokes Aristotelian hylomorphism, and how shape and the nature of materials interlink in craft or artifact (Physics B299b; Metaphysics 3.1070a7). Yet, beside Aristotle’s natural teleology, the terms “preparing” and “shaping” also draw upon the model of Greek medicine, with its grounding in empeiria and logos. Mireille Courrént recalls how this model inspired Vitruvius, himself the son of a physician, when he sought to raise architecture to the rank of scientific discipline.87 This in turn provided the source for Vitruvius’s definition of architecture as a combination of fabrica and ratiocinatio (1.1). These notions, however, represented far more than just “practice” and “theory,” as translated by physician and architect Claude Perrault (1613–88) in 1673.88 Among other classicists who have recently revisited the problematic fabrica–ratiocinatio binary, Pierre Gros interprets it as a Latin counterpart to the Hellenistic coupling of technē and epistēmē, in which practice and technique precede theory and science.89 Louis Callebat, in contrast, has argued for an alternate, nonsequential intertwining of praxis and mathesis.90 Around 1600 to 1630 such questions remained as unresolved as ever, and thus Savot, as a Galenist interested in architecture, was even more predisposed to return to the empeiria–logos nexus for its definition.\n\nIn his version of On Treatment by Bloodletting, Savot had already addressed empeiria and logos as “experience” and “reason.”91 At least two other texts could have stimulated his reflections on the interlocking of architecture and medicine. First, Galen’s short treatise That the Best Physician Is Also a Philosopher mirrored Vitruvius’s remarks, inspired by Hippocrates, on the architect’s training, thus underscoring the significance of natural philosophy (physiologia) and mathematics to both medical and architectural practices.92 Equally important was On the Constitution of the Art of Medicine, in which Galen drew parallels between the arts of curing and building by emphasizing their shared concern for restoration and preservation.93 These are but a few examples; in fact, physiologia and mathematics intertwine across the entire Hippocratic–Galenic corpus.94 As Jackie Pigeaud notes, these connections are epitomized by Galen’s association of proportion in temperaments (elements, qualities, humors) with beauty in the human body (parts, members, organs).95 While Galen borrowed verbatim from the Canon of Polycleitus (490–420 BCE)—emulating what Vitruvius did for buildings (De architectura 3.1)—he meant more than merely formal analogies. As Pigeaud observes, “Health would reside in symmetria of elements, and beauty in symmetria of parts,” with symmetry understood as “proportion regulated by utility.”96 This reciprocal penetration of mixture (krasis, balance in substance) and structure (size, number, arrangement) resolved some of the tensions between physis and technē debated in Greek medicine.97 In the words of a sixteenth-century French translation of Galen’s magnum opus, On the Usefulness of the Parts of the Body—reprinted twice during Savot’s academic training—the integration of mixture and structure involves an “industrious and artful” nature that operates into matter (making, fabrica) as much as into form (reasoning, ratiocinatio).98\n\nArguing for disciplinary analogies, Savot could not miss any citation of Galen or echo of his thought in modern Vitruvian literature. To begin, he considered humanist Jean Martin’s (ca. 1507–53) milestone rendition of fabrica and ratiocinatio as fabrique and discours. In Martin’s elaborate phrasing, fabrique, rather than practice, was “a habitual and continuous meditation of the use,” a meditation “done manually, of all sorts of materials, and which one should apply to reach the point of formation.”99 Conversely, discours, a term dear to Savot, constituted “the means by which one can show and convey how things must be done by industry, according to right proportions.”100 To develop this interpretation, Savot could turn to Daniele Barbaro’s (1514–70) word-by-word philosophical comments on Vitruvius, in both Latin and Italian editions, whose differences he pointed out to the reader.101 Barbaro called extensively not only on Aristotle and Cicero but also on Galen to emphasize the epistemic entanglement of fabrica and ratiocinatio.102 In this way he emulated the paragone lectures of his friend Benedetto Varchi (1503–65), a text that Savot also consulted.103 Above all, the physician ought to respond to Vincenzo Scamozzi’s (1548–1616) most provocative appeal to Galen’s Therapeutic Method (1.9), one of the main sources for On Treatment by Bloodletting, where “method” and “exercise” stood, respectively, for logos and empeiria.104 While Scamozzi sought to draw architecture toward science by privileging the intellectual nature of design over its execution by manual workers and tradesmen, Savot instead maintained a typically Galenic interdependence between empeiria (experience and technical practice) and logos (reasoning and natural history), as a balance that he aspired to achieve throughout his life.\n\nDespite the philosophical tone of the introduction to L’architecture, the treatise was hardly a speculative exercise removed from historical contingencies. Instead, in this work Savot recorded brand-new practices in building, even as they were mutating, along with the often unresolved technical questions that they raised. To this end, Savot methodically compiled these practices, seeking to reduce them to their most characteristic features and organize them in a corpus of morphological and structural types. These were ordered according to rules of convenance (suitability, appropriateness) as well as construction procedures, all grounded in materials, and in dialogue with legal constraints and jurisprudence as well as current science. As we will see, Savot extracted all such types, rules, procedures, and precedents from conversations with professionals regarding conditions arising on work sites and in recently completed projects. The treatise’s section on manorial hydraulics in particular illustrates this combination of empeiria and logos: here, to formalize the technical knowledge that “experience taught fontainiers as well as learned and practiced men,” from whom he collected it, Savot relied on a host of publications in cutting-edge fields, ranging from neo-Aristotelian philosophy to mechanics, hydrostatics, and pneumatics.105\n\nIn many respects, Savot’s program would fit into the Renaissance “cultural phenomenon” of “reduction into art” (ad artem redigere) that Hélène Vérin and Pascal Dubourg-Glatigny have recently revisited.106 Although the reenactment of this legacy occurred in various ways across a wide-ranging technical literature, it consistently involved the precise use of key concepts of legal humanism: ars, methodus, systema, oeconomia, and ordo.107 Reducing technical practices into precepts and rules (redaction) required inventorying, systematizing, and rationalizing scattered practices (collection), arranging them in only a few words (abridgment), and then making them accessible through print to as many people as possible (dissemination).108\n\nAlthough Savot used the verb reduce in different senses, including—when discussing symmetry—in reference to reduction into art and rules, this specific operation represented a driving principle throughout his treatise.109 At the same time, like many other scholars, Savot pointed out the limitations of systematism and the tension it implies between codification and invention.110 Indeed, embracing the dialectics of fabrica and ratiocinatio, he cautioned: “It is not enough to have the knowledge and intelligence of all the rules that are mentioned in the present treatise, but, to apply them, one must have, as in any other science and art, a wide usage and practice of these and, beyond that, an inventive spirit, adroit and proper for such things.”111\n\nAlong these programmatic lines, the first two-thirds of L’architecture centers on the “form,” or the “disposition, position, figure, and measurements or symmetries,” of private buildings.112 This part constitutes a comprehensive typology of hôtels and châteaus (“maisons aux champs”), along with their outdoors and manorial infrastructures (chapters 5–33). As Savot affirms, while the main resulting types serve “Princes and the grandest Seigneurs,” his intended audience includes all seigneurs and bourgeois, whom he advises to draw from and adapt these upper-tier models to suit their means and needs.113 From the consideration of form, he excludes stonecutting (stereotomy) and ornament (orders) as fields that others had addressed. The last third of the treatise also represents its most technical part, encompassing a broad range of topics: construction law and regulations (chapters 34–35); the quality, provenance, and prices of materials (chapters 36–43); measurement methods and weights (chapters 44–46); and, finally, a bibliographic section (chapter 47). To do full justice to L’architecture, it is thus critical to acknowledge both the empirical sources (sites, practices, actors) and the epistemological frameworks (from materials to knowledge systems and institutions) that Savot brought together in shaping this text. As we might expect, his patron-patients played a major role in this enterprise.\n\nBesides his own projects, Jeannin provided Savot the necessary connections to gain access to some of the most significant work sites in Paris, including Marie de’ Medici’s Luxembourg Palace (1615–31). We can infer from Savot’s indications that he studied the project sometime between 1619 and 1624, while the sculptor Guillaume Bertelot (1580–1645) worked on location (Figure 18).114 As a result, even before the building was completed, Savot could disseminate its spatial, material, and technical innovations in print.115 He could contact and learn on-site from such prominent designers and contractors as Salomon de Brosse (ca. 1570–1626), principal architect to the Queen Mother, and Clément II Métezeau, soon to work, as we have seen, for Ruzé d’Effiat, as well as the Parisian roofer Étienne Regnault, who was employed by Jeannin at Dracy-Saint-Loup.116 It is also worth noting that Peiresc oversaw the palace’s decorative program during his 1616–22 stay in Paris, alongside Jeannin’s colleague Guillaume Du Vair (1556–1621), keeper of the seals.117 Meanwhile, hydraulic engineer Tommaso Francini (1571–1651) worked on bringing water both to the queen’s palace and, from 1623, to Chilly.118\n\nSavot’s consideration in L’architecture of other, more modest types of construction, what he termed “two different ways of building” between party walls, also demonstrates how his approach was based on his personal experience of contemporary cases.119 On the one hand, he identified brick-and-stone construction with pavilion roofs, such as the buildings designed for the Place Royale (1605–12), which included the hôtels belonging to the Jeannin-Castilles and Chastillon that he could study both inside and out. By the other “way of building,” Savot referred to the row houses with rubble walls and pitched roofs “being built today [i.e., since 1619–20] on Île Notre-Dame.”120 Savot detailed the material components, dimensions, and costs of both types, presenting these as standards that could then be used to estimate the cost of any building by analogy. In these and other examples, Savot’s medical perspective informed his approach to materials and procedures: his close attention to both natural and technical aspects reflected not only contemporary inquiries in science but also legal concerns.\n\nIn his survey of heating systems, Savot coupled the physical properties and behaviors of fire and smoke with innovations in the construction and regulation of chimneys. With no fewer than twenty pages dedicated to this topic, Savot’s work soon became a reference on warming and ventilating.121 A major source that the physician acknowledged here was a publication by Jean Bernard, canon of the Sainte-Chapelle of Dijon, where Jeannin’s brother Nicolas controlled the powerful abbey of Saint-Bénigne.122 It is worth noting that Bernard claimed to follow the medical method in implementing building safeguards, proceeding from the knowledge of natural causes to diagnosis and remedy.123\n\nWith regard to garden design, Savot proposed an acoustic complement to the then-conventional parterre: an apsidal extension that he called the “artificial echo.” His design guidelines for this outdoor feature derived from his on-site study of the axial, exedra-shaped enclosure at the Tuileries garden in Paris. He also drew explicitly upon the work of Jesuit mathematician and physicist Giuseppe Biancani (1566–1624), Galileo’s famous defender, who published the first geometric analysis of sound.124 By adopting Biancani’s method, Savot followed new scholarship that shifted away from traditional qualitative approaches addressing the nature of sound, as in Scamozzi, to focus instead on the material conditions of its production.125\n\nIn his examination of the hydraulic infrastructure of a country estate, Savot considered the various physical states of water: flowing or contained (ditches, canals, basins, pipes), forced (machines, pumps, fountains), and frozen (icehouses).126 Although in this section Savot relied mainly on the work of Olivier de Serres (1539–1619), his observations extended beyond purely textual sources.127 As he acknowledged in L’architecture as well as in his publication on medals, Savot drew upon the experience and know-how of “learned and practiced men,” among whom featured the engineers, contractors, and commissioners of the Bâtiments.\n\nOf course, Savot did not add anything new to Pliny with his remark that lead pipes, because they capture the “earthiness” of water, do not contaminate it with their “ceruse or leaden quality.”128 However, in the Discours sur les medalles, Savot also reported on modern techniques unknown to the author of the Natural History. For example, Savot discussed “the invention of making lead pipes all in one piece, without any tin solder,” which he had learned directly from the “Master of the Pump in Paris,” developer of this technique.129 The title referred unmistakably to Jean Lintlaër, builder and governor of the hydraulic machine on the Pont Neuf (1603–8), and later responsible for the waterworks at Chilly (Figures 19 and 20).130 Evidently, Savot was also well acquainted with the works of Claude de Montconis (d. 1623), superintendent of the fountains of the royal gardens under Henri IV, voicing skepticism about his experiments (and failures) with pumps, and judging them—like those of Giambattista Della Porta—as “more ingenious than fruitful.”131\n\nIn his discussion of the “weight of various bodies,” Savot reproduced a memorandum that Aleaume had drafted for him personally and that synthesized recent scholarship on the topic.132 The philological, historical, and scientific value of this note would make Savot’s text in turn a key source for metrology in publications by thinkers such as Mersenne, lexicologist Furetière, and mathematician Pierre Hérigone (1580–1643).133 Furthermore, Aleaume’s contribution intersected with Savot’s simultaneous research in numismatics regarding the translation of the Roman foot and libra into modern units, a critical question not only for antiquarians and architects but also for apothecaries and naturalists. To tackle the issue, Savot elaborated a technical protocol involving the Minims in Rome to produce a copper standard (based on an authoritative ancient marble source from the Roman Capitoline) that would eventually be displayed in their Parisian convent, north of the Place Royale, for the general public’s reference in cases of controversy.134 Well before the publication of the Discours sur les medalles, Mersenne acknowledged the value of Savot’s findings for a renewed approach to measuring the volumes and distances of all sorts of “objects,” ranging from the diameter of the Earth to the bearings of celestial bodies (Figure 21).135\n\nPerhaps Savot’s most intriguing expertise related to his work on regulations, as reflected in the forty-page-long selection of legal acts in his treatise that focuses on easements, with its “conferences,” or comparisons, between the Custom of Paris and the laws of other French provinces.136 Robert Carvais’s systematic identification and analysis of this material underscores Savot’s exceptional understanding of legal practice and jurisprudence in the context of contemporary French building.137L’architecture thus represented one of the first books to incorporate the Custom of Paris as the standard for law across France under the ancien régime.138 While scholars have so far been unable to explain how Savot’s command of the legal framework of construction took shape, my investigation reveals that it emerged thanks to his unique proximity with a living corpus of law. This familiarity was not only informed by direct access to Jeannin’s private library but also facilitated by the président’s lifelong experience with justice, government, and finances, as well as his building projects and his extensive social networks.139\n\nSavot could thus report, in L’architecture on the most recent court judgments on building measurement (toisé).140 He even dared to criticize legal humanists such as Charles Dumoulin (1500–1564), whose foundational comments on the Custom of Paris were curiously omitted from L’architecture.141 Indeed, in his 1627 Discours, Savot repeatedly referenced the eminent jurist’s De mutatione monetarum quaestiones, not only as an authority but also to point out Dumoulin’s “ignorance of practice” in weighing operations.142"
