        "text": "As we approach the completion of the Œuvres complètes de Voltaire, I sat down with team co-ordinator Gillian Pink to find out more about how joining the editorial team led to becoming a researcher in her own right.\n\nYou are one of the research editors working on the critical edition, a huge task. How did you come to work for the VF? Did you start editing OCV immediately?\n\nI came to the VF almost by accident. I was studying for an MA in Publishing at Oxford Brookes University and Clare Fletcher, who was responsible for work placements on the MA, also did marketing here. She took one look at my CV – which at that point included work on a critical edition of an eighteenth-century sequel to Candide – and said ‘I think I know someone who would be very interested in this CV!’ That person turned out to be Janet Godden.\n\nI arrived at 99 Banbury Road one afternoon in January 2007 for what I think I expected to be an interview, and was put to work straight away collating variants for Le Pyrrhonisme de l’histoire [since published in OCV, vol.67]. The rest, as they say… I did work briefly on Electronic Enlightenment before I started my full time employment on OCV in the autumn of that year, so an early introduction to digital editing, checking instances of words using non-Latin alphabets, as well as certain types of metadata.\n\nSo you have been at the VF for thirteen years – how many volumes have you worked on? Do you have a favourite text or volume?\n\nOh my! How many volumes… Taking a quick look at the shelves… twenty-five, perhaps, depending on your definition of ‘worked on’, and there are still a few more to go too. I don’t know if I have a single all-time favourite, but many favourites, which tend to be the ones I’ve contributed to as an author, rather than only as an in-house editor.\n\nOne of my favourite Voltaire texts, I suppose, would have to be the Questions sur l’Encyclopédie, a glorious collection of mostly short articles summing up his thoughts on just about every topic under the sun as he approached the end of his life. I had some involvement with all of the eight volumes that make up the set in OCV, was lead in-house editor on six of those and annotated articles in four. Last year, along with the general editors Nicholas Cronk and Christiane Mervaud, we published a version of this text for a wider readership with Robert Laffont. But I also love the very humorous poem ‘Le Pauvre Diable’ that I edited in volume 51A, and of course the notebook fragments just published in the latest volume, 84, and the marginalia in volumes 136-145 are close to my heart and research interests as well…\n\nTell me more about the marginalia, please! What is your research interest in them?\n\nIf you had told me when I first joined the VF that a few years down the line I’d have completed a D.Phil. and become an expert on Voltaire’s marginalia, I’d have found it quite hard to believe. As you may know, the project of publishing Voltaire’s marginal notes was begun by colleagues in St Petersburg at the National Library of Russia, but after the Berlin wall came down, their publisher, Akademie Verlag, went through a period of upheaval and the project stalled. The VF picked it up and incorporated it (quite rightly) into OCV.\n\nBut the lady in St Petersburg who had been writing all the editorial notes had sadly died before she got to the final volume, so it was suggested that I might like to take this on as a doctoral project. In the end, I did a more typical thesis, while the annotation ended up being a separate project. Until then, while the marginalia had been studied to some degree, by far most of the articles published looked at Voltaire as a reader of a particular author. There was no proper study at that point looking at the marginalia as an ensemble, as a genre, looking for patterns in what we present as a corpus, although of course it wasn’t conceived as a corpus by Voltaire at all – rather like his correspondence in that way. And I was lucky to have an excellent supervisor in Nicholas [Cronk]. The result of all this was my book, Voltaire à l’ouvrage (Voltaire at work), which came out – nearly two years ago already!\n\nSince then I played a leading role in bringing out a final volume of Voltaire’s marginalia in OCV, based on an even more disparate corpus, which is to say those books and manuscripts that for various reasons are not part of his library in St Petersburg, and so were not part of the original Russian project. While I still find marginalia fascinating for the direct insights they provide into readers’ responses to books (although they can’t always be taken completely at face value), I’m now extending this interest to reading notes in a broader sense, and Voltaire’s notebooks are a wonderfully challenging mix of reading notes, ideas of various sorts, and jottings that probably reflected snippets that he gleaned from oral sources.\n\nWe all know that the paper publication of OCV is nearing its completion this year. Do you have a new project lined up, for example regarding Voltaire’s notebooks you mentioned?\n\nYou’re quite right to ask. I do have several research ideas concerning the notebooks. I can’t go into too much detail because a couple of them need to be finalised with publishers and/or other colleagues, but I think there is much to be done in this area.\n\nI’ll be talking about the notebooks at the annual ‘Journées Voltaire’ conference at the Sorbonne in June. I think the notebooks can be perceived as a bit ‘scary’, in part because of the wide variety of topics and the considerable lack of order within them, but also the fact that they were amongst the first volumes published in OCV. In those days scholarly practices didn’t demand the fuller sort of annotation that we tend to provide for readers nowadays, so Besterman’s notes are quite laconic and his perspective perhaps isn’t quite the one we would adopt these days either. For me, as someone whose approach tends to be based on material bibliography, I find it really helpful and revealing to look at the original manuscripts. Often, physical characteristics will strongly suggest – for example from the colour of the ink, the margins, the spacing – which sections were written at the same time, and so give a sense of which bits belong together or not. This is an area in which I hope our future digital edition of Voltaire’s complete works may build on the print and add real value, as there would be an opportunity to supplement the print transcription with digitised images.\n\nOf course, the really interesting question to me is how Voltaire used his notebooks and other loose papers, how they were generated, and how they fed into his more public writings. I think there are still discoveries to be made in this area, and I’m lucky to be able to work with a great network of colleagues, from friends based in Voltaire’s library in St Petersburg, to digital humanities scholars at the Sorbonne and the University of Chicago, and research groups interested in textual genetics and the extract as a genre at ITEM [in Paris] and the IZEA [Halle, Germany]. So the future is full of exciting possibilities.\n\n– Birgit Mikus with Gillian Pink\n\nThe Voltaire Foundation’s first ever Hackathon took place on Friday 24th January 2020, as part of a generous John Fell Fund grant. It was held in the suitably historic St Luke’s Chapel in the Radcliffe Observatory Quarter, a now deconsecrated chapel which once formed part of the Radcliffe Infirmary. The event was attended by over twenty students and researchers from a range of disciplines and institutions, including a large contingent of our colleagues from the Sorbonne. We were also joined by a number of specialist advisers, and of course our judges: Nicholas Cronk (Voltaire Foundation), Marian Hobson (Queen Mary), Glenn Roe (Sorbonne), and Kathryn Eccles (OII).\n\nFor the uninitiated, a hackathon (or, in French, ‘un hackathon’), is an event which brings together a large group of people to engage in collaborative digital projects. In the case of the Voltaire Hackathon, participants were asked to bring together their expertise and passion for the written word to conceive and realise projects drawn from an almost intimidatingly broad corpus: the collected works and correspondence of Voltaire, as found in TOUT Voltaire and Electronic Enlightenment, which were made available both as plain text and TEI-XML files. Armed with this corpus, participants in teams of three to five would compete for the ultimate prize: a small 3D-printed bust of the man himself.\n\nFollowing a warm welcome from Nicholas Cronk and an introduction to the dataset from Glenn Roe, participants were given time to mix, mingle, and form their teams under the guidance of Kathryn Eccles. Each individual brought to the team their own strengths and skillset, with each group trying to find a balance of Voltaire specialists, French speakers, and digital specialists. Once teams had formed, participants set about the challenging task of finding just one project among the vast corpus of Voltaire’s literary and personal output – a project which needed to be at a working prototype stage within the six or so hours allotted to complete it. Some groups had clearly arrived with a concept already in mind, while others played around with a few ideas before settling on one point of focus. The room was soon abuzz with discussion and excited planning, in French, English, and the odd smattering of Franglais.\n\nHaving introduced themselves, established individual skillsets, and settled on a plan, teams set to work. By lunchtime, it was already clear that there were a wide range of interests represented: imagistic language in Voltaire’s poetry; mapping place in Candide’s journey and Voltaire’s correspondence; visualising the spread and reception of the Lettres Philosophiques in Voltaire’s correspondence; and analysing the presence of and response to the ideas of 17th-century philosophers within Voltaire’s œuvre. Each project presented its own unique challenges, not least of all the sheer size of the corpus available to each group, but over the course of the day, each project began to take a tangible shape.\n\nAt the end of the day, each team presented their work back to the judges and the other groups, explaining their concept, method, and the initial findings. The final products engaged not only with a wide range of works from the corpus, but also in a wide range of techniques, including building user interfaces for public engagement, and producing linguistic analysis, data visualisation, and geospatial analysis. All of the projects presented represented a huge amount of hard work, talent, and passion from the Hackathon participants, and it was exciting to get a sense of the huge potential in a digital approach to Voltaire and the Enlightenment more widely. However, there could only be one winner, and the much-coveted prize was award to Olle Hammarstrom, Maria Florutau, and Andrei Sorescu for their innovative work on Voltaire’s engagement with earlier philosophers.\n\nHowever, without intending to sound trite, it was not the winning, but the taking part that counts. Although all of the participants would have been thrilled to win a tiny Voltaire of their very own, the day was a rewarding experience in and of itself, pushing all the attendees out of their comfort zones. For those with little experience in the digital humanities, it opened eyes to the techniques and insight available to them in the realm of computing, while those with little or no background in Voltaire were able to find a new interest; even in our internet age, it was evident from the smiles and laughter from participants that there is still a great deal of humour to be found in Voltaire’s work and correspondence. Overall, the day was a great success, both productive and enjoyable, and will, with a bit of luck, be repeated again in the not-so-distant future.\n\n– Josie Dyster, Research Assistant, Voltaire Foundation, Oxford"
