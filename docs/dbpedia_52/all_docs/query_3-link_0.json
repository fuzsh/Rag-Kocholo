        "text": "Expressive use of color, example of Kladschilderkunst. Marie was among one of Ruben's loyal patrons a high member of Florentine's banking family. She commissioned Rubens to paint a series of huge canvases memorializing and glorifying her career. Between 1622 and 1626, Rubens, work-ing with amazing creative energy, produced with the aid of his many assistants 21 historical-allegorical pictures and three portraits designed to hang in the queen's new palace, the Luxembourg, in Paris. In Arrival of Marie de' Medici at Marseilles Marie disembarks at that southern French port after her sea voyage from Italy. An allegorical personification of France, draped in a cloak decorated with the fleur-de-lis (the floral symbol of French royalty), welcomes her. The sea and sky rejoice at the queen's safe arrival. Neptune and the Nereids (daughters of the sea god Nereus) salute her, and the winged and trumpeting personified Fame swoops overhead.\n\nMaster of this genre and informs what happens with dutch artists during this era. What's known as a \"breakfast piece\". Requires no knowledge to understand the painting unlike catholic based paintings and artworks.reveals Peeters's virtuosity in depicting a wide variety of objects convincingly, from the smooth, reflective surfaces of the glass and silver goblets to the soft petals of the blooms in the vase. Peeters often painted the objects in her still lifes against a dark background, thereby negating any sense of deep space Made to be awed at. Calls attention to the surface of each object.\n\nThought to be by Frans Hals. Paintings were not always signed so artworks by women were often credited towards their fathers and/or teachers. Given demonstration of her abilities in her personal self portrait on canvas and what her portrait is painting thus invites the viewer to evaluate her skill. Very relaxed, turned around as if she's caught painting. Leyster did not paint herself wearing the traditional artist's smock, as her more famous contemporary Rembrandt did in his 1659—1660 self-portrait. Her mouth is open as if she is laughing or mid smile.\n\nWho is the painter? Wearing a painter's smock, hair tied back. Compared to Judith Leyster's self portrait. He's suggesting there's more poetic about who the artist is. Both rely on tropes of artistic status and success. The circles are in reference to the story of giotto and cimabue where giotto drew a perfect circle to show his talents and skill rather than submitting a painting.\n\nLandscapes became more popular. In specific reference of a place yet generic enough to sit in an average home. The location is identifiable. The majority of the painting is exploration of clouds. Though the scenery is specific, it's only ⅓ or so of the painting for a reason. The specificity of the artist's image—the Saint Bavo church in the background, the numerous windmills that refer to the land reclamation efforts, and the figures in the foreground stretching linen to be bleached (a major industry in Haarlem)—reflects the pride that Dutch painters took in recording their homeland and the activities of their fellow citizens.\n\nLife sized couples representing a different cultural/ethnic category in brazil. Collaboration between scientists and artists. Shown as types rather than individuals, we don't know their names or stories.\n\nTapuya Man: the artist conveys the hunter gatherer status of this couple, suggests the people were hunting for people, most primitive. Cannibalism. Moral and cultural stereotypes. Includes sexual references (hyper-sexualizing)\n\nBrazilians: Less primitive due to bows & arrows (for hunting humans) and clothing. Behind the woman, you see structure, human nature and natural nature has been tamed by a mission (christianity). Also shows motherhood\n\nAfricans: fully facing statures yet being depicted as slaves, depiction of sexuality. Larger breasts, carrying basket of fruit showing production abundance, for facing upwards towards female genitalia. The child has lighter skin maybe in reference to the rapes happening against the African slaves. More emphasis on strength. On the ground next to the man there's an elephant tusk and there are also seashells. Is this picture still in Africa? Is it just a commodity?\n\nMixed race: Fully clothed man has higher grade weapons (sword showing civilization, nobility, and decoration and rifle showing modern) showed higher stature. The woman has flowers in her hair shows her opportunity to be ornamental. Also references the goddess Flora. The man almost guards the sugarcane. Advocates for the natural balance of brazil\n\nNot accurate images but stereotypes, were considered scientific rather than artistic.\n\nAs living objects that soon die, flowers, particularly cut blossoms, appeared frequently in vanitas paintings. How-ever, floral painting as a distinct genre also enjoyed great popularity in the Dutch Republic because the Dutch were the leading growers and exporters of flowers in 17th-century Europe.A viewer might simply enjoy the skill of the artist and the luscious arrangement of many different kinds of flowers, some of them not in bloom at the same time in nature. However, Ruysch's floral still lifes are not pictures of real floral arrangements, but idealized groupings of individually studied flowers. A viewer might read a hidden meaning in the image: though captured in full bloom, the flowers will soon wilt and brown, serving as a reminder that beauty fades and all living things must die.\n\nForcibly forced jews to Christianity\n\nAuto de Fe- act of faith. The prisoners were tied by the neck and burned at the stake. Think of the witch trials.\n\nVery intense period of catholicism. Also in 1492 there was a discovery of the americas. What does it mean to be so heavily catholic? Spain and France have all powers invested in the monarch.\n\nAbsolutism- Doctrine and practice of unlimited centralization authority and absolute sovereignty as vested especially in a monarch or a dictator"
