        "meta_description": "The New-York Historical Society Museum Department records include curatorial, collections management, exhibitions, outgoing loans, administrative, and object files created by museum staff. The bulk of the records range from the 1970s into the early twenty-first century, though there is important earlier material, including acquisition and other documents concerning the John J. Audubon watercolors and the Henry Abbott Egyptian collection. The most extensive portions of the record group relate to exhibitions and loans, and those files are rich with checklists, images, loan documentation, publicity material, research files, comment books, wall texts and labels, design elements, budgets and funding requests, and other like matter. The curatorial and collection management files include documents concerning proposed exhibitions, general exhibition scheduling, research inquiries, offers of objects for accession, object surveys, recommendations to the Board Museum Collection Committee, conservation, and other museum matters. There are also many object images, especially for paintings and drawings.",

        "text": "This subseries includes files from the Museum Department that have a mix of subject matter and that seem to have been created over time by various staff members, or perhaps by a single but no longer identifiable staff member (i.e., of mixed or uncertain provenance). Additional materials will likely accrue to the subseries over time. As of 2016, there are two \"sets\" of records in the subseries, designated in the container list simply as \"Set A\" and \"Set B.\"\n\nSet A includes files that combine both registrar and curatorial matters. The bulk of these files span 1939-1949, dating from the earliest days when N-YHS expanded its museum professional staff. The principal contributors to these files appear to be Carolyn Scoon (Registrar and later Assistant Curator, ranging from the 1940s to about 1966) and H. Maxson Holloway (Curator during part of the 1940s). The date range of the files extends to the 1960s so correspondence to Director R.W.G. Vail and others do appear, in addition to Scoon. The correspondence primarily concerns offers of objects accepted and declined, inquiries regarding objects, loans to and from N-YHS for exhibitions, photograph permissions, and other object-related matters. The subseries includes extensive information about accessions in the form of correspondence, accession receipts, lists, appraisals, and acknowledgements. Library accessions are reflected in these records to a significant degree as well as those of the museum. Donors/correspondents are noted in the container list below when they are represented in a file by substantive documentation or lengthy object lists.\n\nSet B includes more recent (1993-2002) files of inquiries and declined accession offers.\n\nThe subseries includes various sets of general files produced by the Museum Department over time and these are presented in roughly chronological order or in the order they were accessioned into the archives. The start of each discrete set is labeled in the container list as \"Set A,\" \"Set B,\" and so forth. The arrangement of each set varies, as follows:\n\nSet A follows original order. This was alphabetical by correspondent, though some collection names, if different from the donor, were used to determine filing. Set A has a complete A-Z run that is followed by a second A-Z run. These have overlapping content and the second run simply appears to be additional related documents found at a later time.\n\nSet B follows original order. This was chronological, with folders of correspondence for each month. At the end of the set are folders of declined offers, arranged alphabetically by the offering correspondent or object. Regardless of the fact that these particular files were segregated in the original files, correspondence concerning declined offers can also be found in the main run of Set B.\n\nN-YHS restricts Board of Trustee and Executive Office files for 50 years following the departure of a President and Chief Executive Officer. This subseries includes files related to Board and Board Committee matters, and so is restricted accordingly. Records from 1977-1982 (from the administraton of James Heslin) are restricted until 2033. Records from 1983-1988 (from the administration of James B. Bell) are restricted until 2039. Files holding the records of Bell's successors will be opened in subsequent years. While the restriction applies, these records may be used only by, or with the permission of, the President and Chief Executive Officer, the head of the Museum Department, or their designee.\n\nThe subseries includes files maintained by and for Mary Childs Black (referred to as \"MCB\" in many of the documents), who was Curator of Painting, Sculpture and the Decorative Arts at N-YHS from 1970 through 1982. Black was an authority on American folk art. Prior to joining N-YHS, she had been the Director of the Museum of American Folk Art in New York (1964-1970) and Director of the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Collection at Williamsburg (late 1950s-1964).\n\nBlack's records primarily include two overlapping sets of files, one ordered by subject and the other ordered chronologically. The chronological files generally hold only correspondence and the topics include proposed and executed exhibitions, publication and other projects, research inquiries, professional exchanges, offers of objects for accession, and other museum professional matters. The subject files also hold correspondence concerning the same general and even particular matters, but also hold a broader range of documentation, such as photographs, research notes on artists and other topics, drafts of articles and other writings, etc. The container list includes a complete list of the subject files, using the original label headings. These first two sets were processed and described in 2016; in 2021, additional materials from Black's files were transferred to the archves and these were described broadlt at the box level and are found at the end of the container list.\n\nIt appears that many files related to specific exhibitions might have been removed from these records and boxed separately. For files of exhibitions during Black's tenure, at least many of which were surely from Black's office, see Series II. Exhibitions, Subseries A. General Files.\n\nAlthough the bulk of the material dates from the years of Black's tenure at N-YHS, there is a set of 1940s correspondence between the United States Trust Company of New York and the Museum of the City of New York concerning the bequest of a Trumbull portrait to MCNY, subsequently renounced in favor of N-YHS (see the Trumbull subject file).\n\nHolly Hotchner joined N-YHS in 1984 to play a leadership role in the conservation initiatives of the Museum Department. The mid-1980s to early 1990s were a turbulent time in N-YHS's history and Hotchner's scope of responsibility gradually expanded, formally and informally, over this period. By 1989, with the departure of museum curator Ella Foshay (1984-1989), Hotchner was promoted from Chief Conservator to Museum Director. At the same time, the Department of Prints, Photographs, and Architecture (the Print Room) was transferred from the Library to the Museum, where it would remain organizationally until 1998. The Security Department was also transferred to Hotchner's leadership at this time. As Museum Director and a member of the senior management team in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Hotchner was closely involved with N-YHS's facilities and fiscal planning, the effort to broaden the museum's professional staff, and the initiative to refine the institution's collections policy and the associated deaccessioning process. By mid-1993, at the height of N-YHS's fiscal crisis and as a result of large numbers of staff lay-offs, resignations, and other departures, only Hotchner remained as the senior level executive at N-YHS. Her role narrowed in early 1994 as N-YHS Co-Chair \"Pug\" Winokur took over responsibility for the Museum while Hotchner focused on the deaccessioning initiative of the time and the planning of certain major exhibitions. Later In 1994 Hotchner also left N-YHS.\n\nN-YHS restricts Board of Trustee and Executive Office files for 50 years following the departure of a President and Chief Executive Officer. This subseries includes some files related to Board and Board Committee matters, and those files are restricted accordingly. Specifically, the files date primarily from the administration of Barbara Knowles Debs and the interim leaders that followed her (1988-1994) and so they are restricted until 2044. While the restriction applies, those files may be used only by, or with the permission of, the President and Chief Executive Officer, the head of the Museum Department, or their designee.\n\nThe subseries includes, at least in large part, the files of Annette Blaugrund, Senior Curator of Paintings, Drawing & Sculpture from 1989-1995. The files include correspondence concerning proposed exhibitions, research inquiries, offers of objects for accession, and other museum matters. The files also include object surveys, especially for sculpture, and general administration and exhibition planning documents. Fuller summaries of the content are provided in the container list below. Certain of Blaugrund's files are currently restricted. See the Access Restrictions note. A major initiative of Blaugrund's was the planning for an exhibition about the Tenth Street Studio Building. This subseries holds few or no files on the matter; the bulk of these were integrated at some point with other exhibition files. See Series II. Exhibitions, Subseries I. General Files, folders for Painting and Patronage: The Tenth Street Studios (1993).\n\nN-YHS restricts Board of Trustee and Executive Office files for 50 years following the departure of a President and Chief Executive Officer.
