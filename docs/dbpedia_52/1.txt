ACTORS AND OTHER ARTISTS AT GHENT

(1575-1700)

Information about the companies of actors who were wandering through Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries has been made available in a number of articles and books which began to appear intermittently toward the end of the nineteenth century. As yet, however, no scholar has been able to harness himself to the task of writing a comprehensive account of the activities of these actors precisely because much information is likely to remain hidden for quite a number of years. The city accounts of Ghent (x) contain much interesting and varied historical information concerning theatrical activities in that city. A considerable part of the archives material, mainly concerned with English and Dutch actors, has already been uncovered and examined (2) ; but other items that remain deserve to be more widely known and may help others to map out more completely all the routes taken by actors on the continent.
