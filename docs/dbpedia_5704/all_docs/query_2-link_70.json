        "text": "Key Takeaways\n\nSingapore Airlinesâ Singapore (SIN) to New York (JFK) route is the longest nonstop flight, covering 9,537 miles in about 18 hours and 50 minutes.\n\nSingapore Airlinesâ Singapore (SIN) to Newark (EWR) route is close behind, covering 9,535 miles in 18 hours and 25 minutes.\n\nAircraft like the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner are used for these long-haul flights for better fuel efficiency and passenger comfort.\n\nFor points-and-miles geeks, jetting around the world on one of the longest nonstop flights in existence means they get to maximize their time on the truly fantastic products they and their friends aspire to. Itâs a big redemption win for hard-earned miles!\n\nTo that end, weâre diving into the 10 longest nonstop flights in the world and what theyâre worth from a points perspective â along with fun facts about the aircraft primed to get you to your destination.\n\nAnd if you didnât pass the points-and-miles geek test this time, one of these fabulous redemptions might convert you!\n\nThe Top 10 Longest Nonstop Flights in the World\n\nHot Tip:\n\nAirlines use nautical miles, not on-the-ground miles. Every nautical mile is equal to a little over 1.15 land-based, or statute, miles. However, for the purposes of this article, weâre sticking to the more familiar statute miles unless otherwise stated. Weâre also not including the return flights on the same routes.\n\n1.

Thatâs when Cathay Pacific flew A350-1000s from New York City (JFK) to Hong Kong (HKG), listed at 10,326 miles for 17 hours and 50 minutes. Cathay Pacific pilots relied on strong but seasonal tailwindsÂ to make the flight possible without consuming too much fuel.\n\nCathay Pacific chose this incredibly long flight path because of the Russia-Ukraine war. The short-lived route took planes over the Atlantic Ocean, over the U.K., through southern Europe, and over parts of Central Asia to avoid flying through Russian airspace.\n\nJapan Airlines similarly did a temporary, much longer rerouting for flights from Tokyo to London for the same reason, going eastbound over the Pacific instead of westbound through Russia. Cathay Pacific has since returned to a more conventional flight plan over the Pacific with a shorter official flight distance of just over 8,000 miles.\n\nIn terms of time, the temporary Cathay Pacific JFK to HKG route was long enough to watch all 10 of the âStar Trekâ feature films in which James T. Kirk is the lead character (i.e., all of the original series and J.J. Abrams-reboot movies but omitting the âStar Trek: The Next Generationâ films), with 1 minute to spare.\n\nIt was also about the same distance as driving from the southernmost point in the continental U.S. âÂ Key West, Florida âÂ to the northernmost U.S. settlement â-Â Utqiagvik, Alaska, formerly known as Barrow âÂ then deciding it was too cold and driving back down to sunny San Antonio, Texas, instead. By the way, you should never attempt to drive to Utqiagvik, even in a snowcat, during the short window when the sea ice is solid enough for some crossings.\n\nBottom Line:\n\nWant to make the whole longest-flight-in-the-world debate even more confusing? Despite airlinesâ listed flight distances for routes, pilots routinely take advantage of conditions like jet streams, which can shorten the flight time but increase the distance. So, though the official flight distance of SQ 24 is around 9,500 statute miles, in reality, itâs not unheard of for pilots on the route to actually cover more like 10,700 statute miles.)\n\nBottom line? Donât take âofficialâ records for longest flights too seriously.\n\n2. Singapore (SIN) to Newark (EWR) on Singapore Airlines: 9,535 Miles\n\nScheduled flightÂ time: 18 hours, 25 minutes\n\nFlight number: SQ 22\n\nAircraft: Airbus A350-900ULR\n\nBest business class redemption: 111,500 Singapore KrisFlyer miles one-way (transfer from Amex Membership Rewards, Brex Rewards, Capital One Miles, Chase Ultimate Rewards, Citi ThankYou Rewards, or Marriott Bonvoy)\n\nYou could:\n\nWatch all of the original âHarry Potterâ movies (âSorcererâs Stoneâ to âDeath Hallows: Part 2â) without credits, with 13 minutes left over, or about enough time for a quick meal with the Yule Ball dinner scene on pause during âGoblet of Fire.â\n\nMileage-wise, drive from The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios in Los Angeles to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Orlando Resort in Florida and back â and then do most of the round-trip journey all over again.

And then, like any horror franchise, do it all over again.\n\nMapping the Flights\n\nWe ranked flights by distance rather than flight time because flight time can vary significantly for many reasons. Please note that because flight times vary so widely from flight to flight, the actual time you spend in the air will likely differ from the listed time if you take one of these trips.\n\nWe listed flights by the shortest distance between 2 points on the Earthâs surface, also known as the great circle distance. This can also differ from the actual distance for reasons including wind, severe weather, and the need to avoid closed airspace.Â\n\nHot Tip:\n\nNeed trivia to throw out at your next AvGeek party? The record for the longest nonstop commercial flight in terms of time in the air is held by Qantas for its August 30, 1943, flight in a Consolidated PBY Catalina seaplane from what is now Sri Lanka to Australia.\n\nIt took 32 hours and 9 minutes to travel 3,512 statute miles. The route was nicknamed âThe Double Sunriseâ because it experienced 2 sunrises per flight âÂ scheduled that way so that it flew through Japanese-occupied territory at night.\n\nAbout the Aircraft\n\nAs planes become more fuel-efficient and fuel costs remain relatively low, weâll continue to see big competition for a spot on the leaderboard for the longest nonstop flights in the world.\n\nBoeing and Airbus continue to find new ways to increase the range and passenger capacity of their aircraft, allowing airlines to turn a profit from these ultra-long-haul flights.\n\nThese aircraft (currently) make up the roster for the longest nonstop flights in the world:\n\nBoeing 777-200LR â Air India\n\nBoeing 787-9 Dreamliner â Air New Zealand, Qantas, United\n\nAirbus A350-900ULR â Singapore Airlines\n\nAirbus A350-1000 â Qatar Airways, Qantas (by 2025)\n\nAirbus A380 â Emirates\n\nBoeing 777-200LR\n\nRange: 9,845 miles/8,555 nautical miles/15,843 kilometers\n\nCapacity: 317 passengers\n\nMaximum Cruising Speed: Mach 0.89/683 mph\n\nEngine:Â GE90-115BÂ turbofan\n\nThe Boeing 777 commercial series is made up of 3 long-range, wide-body, twin-engine jet airliners. Boeing says that the 777 aircraft provides considerably improved reach and increased revenue potential.\n\nIn 2015, General Electric proclaimed the GE90-115B turbofan engine the most powerful engine in the world. The GE90 series held the title of historyâs largest aviation engine until the introduction of the GE9X, which began flight testing in 2018. The Boeing 777 series has also won several awards for its interior cabin design and passenger satisfaction.\n\nThe 777-200LR (the âLRâ is for âLong Rangeâ) is the aircraft of choice for Emiratesâ Dubai-to-Auckland route and Air Indiaâs Bengaluru-to-San Francisco route. Air India flies a 777-200LR previously flown by Delta Air Lines for this journey.\n\nBoeing 787-9 Dreamliner\n\nRange:Â 8,786 miles/7,635 nautical miles/4,140 kilometers\n\nCapacity: 290 passengers\n\nMaximum Cruising Speed: Mach 0.85/652 mph\n\nEngine: GEnx-1B/Trent 1000\n\nBoeingâs 787 Dreamliner series comprises 3 midsize, wide-body, twin-engine jet airliners. Combined, the 787 series currently services over 170 nonstop flights worldwide. The 787-9, however, is the only Dreamliner to make it on the list of longest nonstop flights in the world.\n\nBoeing says that its 787 series provides advantages. including higher distance range and fuel efficiency, more cargo volume, lower operating costs, and a more reliable aircraft.\n\nThe 787-9 is the aircraft of choice for all Qantas Perth-to-London and Melbourne-to-Dallas routes, and Unitedâs Houston-to-Sydney flight.\n\nAirbus A350-900ULR\n\nRange:Â 11,163 miles/9,700 nautical miles/17,964 kilometers\n\nCapacity: 161 (SQ configuration â premium economy and business class only)\n\nMaximum Cruising Speed: Mach 0.89/683 mph\n\nEngine: Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-84\n\nAirbus introduced the A350 series in response to the success of Boeingâs 787 Dreamliner, and the A350-900 is the first member of the companyâs Extra Wide Body, or XWB, a family of next-generation, high-efficiency, high-capacity passenger jets for long-haul flights.\n\nThe A350-900âs first test flight was in 2013, and it flew its first commercial flight (with Qatar Airways) in 2015. Currently, however, Singapore Airlines is the only airline to fly the A350-900ULR version of the -900.\n\nThat A350-900ULR variant (âULRâ for âUltra Long Rangeâ) is a lighter aircraft that can fly farther and is more cost-efficient than large double-decker jets like the 747 or A380. Because of the materials used, thereâs also less maintenance required â an important aspect for global airlines. Passengers find the engine noise substantially quieter, too.\n\nThe main feature of the ULR is that the fuel tanks hold more fuel, critical for ultra-long-haul flights. In addition to extra fuel storage, there are aerodynamic improvements that allow the aircraft to serve routes that previously would have required a technical stop.\n\nThe A350-900ULR is the aircraft of choice for Singapore Airlinesâ routes from Singapore to New York, Newark, and Los Angeles.\n\nAirbus A350-1000\n\nRange:Â 10,001 miles/8,700 nautical miles/16,112 kilometers\n\nCapacity: 480 passengers maximum (327 on Qatar Airways)\n\nMaximum Cruising Speed: Mach 0.89/683 mph\n\nEngine: Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97\n\nQatar Airways launched the first A350-1000 route in February 2018, traveling from Doha, Qatar, to London with 46 Qsuites and 281 economy seats in a 3-3-3 configuration.\n\nMeasuring 23 feet longer than the A350-900, the fuel-efficient A350-1000 is the largest version of the A350. It can squeeze in more dedicated passenger space, has a more powerful engine, and fits in more comfort-focused technology like climate zones, improved air circulation and filtration, and ambient lighting designed to reduce jet lag.\n\nWith a maximum range thatâs 1,000 nautical miles shorter than the A350-900ULRâs, the A350-1000 hasnât received Airbus designation as a ULR model.\n\nQantas has ordered A350-1000s that it plans on putting into service starting in 2025. Singapore, which has todayâs largest fleet of A350s, has standing orders with Airbus for dozens of A350s, with a clause that allows it to pick from either the -900 or -1000 variants closer to delivery.\n\nAirbus A380-800\n\nRange:Â 9,206 miles/8,000 nautical miles/14,800 kilometers\n\nCapacity: 555 passengers maximum (489 on Emirates)\n\nMaximum Cruising Speed: Mach 0.88/675 mph\n\nEngine: Rolls-Royce Trent 900 or GE-Pratt & Whitney GP-7200 turbofans\n\nAlso called the Super Jumbo, the Airbus A380-800 is the largest commercial passenger airplane in the world. Itâs a double-decker that began development all the way back in the 1990s as a direct challenger to the then-dominant Boeing 747 when it came to long-haul flights. Early company visions of the plane even included the possibility of onboard shops, restaurants, and casinos.\n\nThe A380-800, sometimes called the A388, was the passenger variant of the 2 A380 models Airbus originally offered. The other option was the freighter version, the A380F.\n\nSingapore Airlines was the first airline to fly the A380 in October 2007, with Emirates eventually amassing the largest fleet of A380s and becoming the leading A380 customer by far, accounting for nearly half of all orders of the A380.\n\nBut the shifting realities of the industry didnât mesh well with a jet even larger than the 747, and the last A380 rolled off the production line in 2021, eclipsed by smaller, more efficient planes like the A330, A350, and 787.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe competition for the top spot on the list of the longest nonstop flights in the world wonât end any time soon. The only question is: How will the airlines choose to get there?\n\nWithin the past few years, weâve seen the final flight of the last U.S. carrier-operated Boeing 747, once the hallmark of long-haul flights. In 2021, we saw several carriers announce plans to move away from the behemoth A380 to save on fuel and match current passenger demands. Moving forward, will airlines shy away from enormous jets in search of slimmer, more efficient aircraft? Or will the so-called superjumbos also evolve, eventually providing a more efficient and profitable means of carrying passengers around the world?\n\nFrom a points perspective, we certainly hope jumbo jets make a comeback at some point. The optimized business and first class cabins of the more upscale carriers are every miles chaserâs dream.\n\nRewarding your hard-earned miles with 17 hours in business class on a 787-9 is unbeatable."
