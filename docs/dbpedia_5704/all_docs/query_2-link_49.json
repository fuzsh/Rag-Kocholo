That’s how winning is done.”\n\n“Sometimes the right path is not the easiest one.”\n\n“Do or do not. There is no try.”\n\n“Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.”\n\n“If you focus on what you left behind, you will never be able to see what lies ahead.”\n\n“To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, to draw closer, to find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of life.”\n\n“You want to get out of the hole? First you’re going to have to put down the shovel.”\n\n“You’ll have bad times, but it’ll always wake you up to the good stuff you weren’t paying attention to.”\n\n“The very things that hold you down are going to lift you up.”\n\n“Nothing happens to anyone that he is not fitted by nature to bear.”\n\n“All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.”\n\n“It is not our abilities that show what we truly are … it is our choices.”\n\n“Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary.”\n\n“Nobody’s perfect.”\n\n“Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming. What do we do? We swim, swim.”\n\n“How many times do I have to teach you: just because something works doesn’t mean it can’t be improved.”\n\n“Hope is not a strategy.”\n\n“When you get a different vantage point, it changes your perspective ... It allows us to see things that maybe we should have seen a long time ago.”\n\n“Everything is possible, even the impossible.”\n\n“It’s what you do right now that makes a difference.”\n\n“The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all.”\n\n“Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.”\n\n“It’s only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.”\n\n“A laugh can be a very powerful thing. Why, sometimes in life, it’s the only weapon we have.”\n\n“Let’s just allow ourselves to be whatever it is we are.”\n\n“There’s just no telling how far I’ll go.”\n\n“You know how everyone’s always saying, ‘Seize the moment’? I don’t know, I’m kinda thinkin’ it’s the other way. Like the moment seizes us.”\n\n“The more you know who you are, and what you want, the less you let things upset you.”\n\n“You control your destiny – you don’t need magic to do it. And there are no magical shortcuts to solving your problems.”\n\n“Don’t ever let somebody tell you you can’t do something, not even me. Alright? You dream, you gotta protect it. People can’t do something themselves, they wanna tell you you can’t do it. If you want something, go get it. Period.”\n\n“Today is a good day to try.”\n\n“There should be no boundaries to human endeavour. We are all different. However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. While there’s life, there is hope.”\n\n“Everything that made that giant tree is already contained inside this tiny little seed. All it needs is some time, a little bit of sunshine and rain, and voila! ... Now, you might not feel like you can do much now, but that’s just because, well, you’re not a tree yet. You just have to give yourself some time. You’re still a seed.”"
