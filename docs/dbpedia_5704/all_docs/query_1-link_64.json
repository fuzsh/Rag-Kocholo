I met Cosmo by accident and opportunity, after hackers used social engineering techniques to circumvent Apple’s and Amazon’s security mechanisms and break into my accounts. After it happened, I fell into their world and began communicating regularly with the very hacker who jacked me, a kid named Phobia. He introduced me to Cosmo, who wanted to tell me about all manner of other account vulnerabilities.\n\nScience\n\nDoes Jewelry and Big Hair Slow Down Olympic Runners?\n\nEven a little added weight and air drag can make a measurable difference. But WIRED's physics guru says, if it makes you feel strong, go for it!\n\nCulture\n\nNBC Sent 27 Creators to Paris. It Only Needed Snoop and Olympic Athletes\n\nIn an attempt to lure in younger viewers, NBCUniversal sent dozens of social media influencers to the 2024 Paris Olympics. But the athletes and entertainers were the ones who went viral.\n\nGear\n\nI Used ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode. It’s Fun, and Just a Bit Creepy\n\nThe new voice feature from OpenAI for ChatGPT is often entertaining and will even do a Trump impression. It likely rolls out to all paid users this fall."
