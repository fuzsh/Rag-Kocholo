Writers write. Actors, who are costumed and made-up, speak the words and perform the actions described in the script. Art directors and set designers develop the look of the film. The cinematographer decides upon a lighting scheme. Dialogue, sound effects, and music are recorded, mixed, and edited by sound engineers. The images, final sound mix, and special visual effects are assembled by editors to form a final cut. Moviemaking is the product of the efforts of these men and women, yet few film histories focus much on their labor.\n\nBehind the Silver Screen calls attention to the work of filmmaking. When complete, the series will be comprised of ten volumes, one each on ten significant tasks in front of or behind the camera, on the set or in the post-production studio. The goal is to closely examine the various collaborative aspects of film production, one at a time / one per volume, and then to offer a chronology that allows the editors and contributors to explore the changes in each of these endeavors during six eras in film history: the silent screen (1895-1927), classical Hollywood (1928-1946); post-war Hollywood (1947-1967); the auteur renaissance (1968-1980); the New Hollywood (1981-1999), and the Modern Entertainment Marketplace (2000-present). Behind the Silver Screen promises a look at who does what in the making of a movie … it promises a history of filmmaking, not just a history of films.\n\nSERIES EDITOR\n\nJon Lewis, Oregon State University\n\nBack to Top\n\nCarework in a Changing World\n\nEdited by Mignon Duffy, Amy Armenia, and Kim Price-Glynn\n\nThe rise of scholarly attention to care has accompanied greater public concern about aging, health care, child care, and labor in a global world. Research on care is happening across disciplines – in sociology, economics, political science, philosophy, public health, social work and others – with numerous research networks and conferences developing to showcase this work. Care scholarship brings into focus some of the most pressing social problems facing families today. To study care is also to study the future of work, as issues of care work are intertwined with the forces of globalization, technological development, and the changing dynamics of the labor force. Care scholarship is also at the cutting edge of intersectional analyses of inequality, as carework is often at the very core of understanding gender, race, migration, age, disability, class, and international inequalities. We seek books that use a carework perspective and engage with the carework literature to examine the following specific topics (among others):\n\npaid carework, workers, and workplaces including education, health care, social service, nonresidential care, and households/domestic work\n\nrelationships between care recipients and care givers (paid and/or unpaid)\n\nunpaid carework in families and communities\n\ncare in a global context, including migration and care chains\n\npolicy and activism related to carework, workers, and families\n\ntheoretically engaged work related to the ethics or politics of care\n\nstudies of technology and care\n\nscholarship on family or paid work that expands the boundaries of care theory/scholarship (e.g. personal service workers like nail salon technicians)\n\nSERIES EDITORS\n\nThe editors are carework scholars and steering committee members for the Carework Network, an international organization of researchers, policymakers, and advocates involved in various domains of carework. Mignon Duffy is Associate Professor of Sociology at U Mass Lowell and a co-editor, with Amy Armenia and Clare L. Stacey, of Caring on the Clock: The Complexities and Contradictions of Paid Care. Amy Armenia is a Professor of Sociology at Rollins College. Kim Price-Glynn is Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Connecticut and a contributor to Caring on the Clock.

One of the thirteen colonies in British North America and the original states of the United States, New Jersey plays a central, yet underappreciated, place in America’s economic, political, and social development. New Jersey’s axial position as the nation’s financial, intellectual, and political corridor has become something of a signature, evident in quips about the Turnpike and punchlines that end with its many exits. Yet, New Jersey is more than a crossroad or an interstitial “elsewhere.” Far from being ancillary to the nation, New Jersey is an axis around which America’s story has turned, and within its borders gather a rich collection of ideas, innovations, people, and politics. The region’s historical development makes it a microcosm of the challenges and possibilities of the nation, and it also reflects the complexities of the modern, cosmopolitan world. Yet, far too little of the literature recognizes New Jersey’s significance to the national story, and despite promising scholarship done at the local level, New Jersey history often remains hidden in plain sight.\n\nCeres: Rutgers Studies in History will be the primary place to publish new, rigorously peer-reviewed scholarship on New Jersey and the surrounding region. Named for the Roman goddess of prosperity portrayed on the New Jersey State Seal, Ceres provides a platform for cultivating and disseminating the next generation of scholarship. It will feature the work of both established historians and a new generation of scholars across disciplines. Ceres aims to be field-shaping, providing a home for the newest and best empirical, archival, and theoretical work on the region’s past. We are also dedicated to fostering diverse and inclusive scholarship and hope to feature works addressing issues of social justice and activism.\n\nWe seek books that represent the best scholarship to examine the following specific topics (among others):\n\nScholarly accounts of regional places that are central to national stories\n\nSlavery, Society, and Culture in New Jersey\n\nImmigration and Community Studies\n\nInfrastructure and Local Politics\n\nCivil Rights Movement and Grassroots Activism\n\nNew Jersey’s Role in Industrialism and the Economy\n\nWomen, Gender, and Sexuality Studies\n\nBiographies on New Jersey Authors/Artists\n\nNew Jersey in Popular Culture/Media\n\nPolicing, Carceral Culture, and Community\n\nNew Jersey and the World\n\nWar, Politics, and New Jersey\n\nNew Jersey’s Place in the Nation’s Founding\n\nAbout the Series Editors:\n\nThe editors are historians Lucia McMahon, William Paterson University and Christopher T.

Books in the series provide context and critical insight into a given creator’s work, with an especial interest in social and political issues. Each book is organized as a series of reader friendly scholarly chapters that precede the reprinting of short graphic fiction or nonfictional works—or excerpts of longer works. The critical insight and commentary alongside the creative works provide a gateway for lay-readers, students, and specialists to understand a given creator’s work and life within larger social and political contexts as well as within comics history. Authors of these books situate the work of their subject within the creator’s larger body of work and within the history of comics; and bring an engaged perspective to their analysis, drawing on a variety of disciplines, including medical humanities, environmental studies, disability studies, critical race studies, and women’s, gender, and sexuality studies.\n\nProposals for consideration should be sent through email to:\n\nNicole Solano\n\nExecutive Editor\n\nRutgers University Press\n\n106 Somerset St, 3rd Floor\n\nNew Brunswick, NJ 08901\n\n(848) 445-7787\n\nnicole.solano@rutgers.edu\n\nBack to Top\n\nCritical Issues in American Education\n\nEdited by Lisa Michele Nunn, University of San Diego\n\nThe landscape of education in the United States is continually shifting. Rutgers University Press’s new book series, Critical Issues in American Education, provides a platform for showcasing the best scholarship that analyzes the historical and current forces shaping American educational institutions.\n\nTaking advantage of sociology’s position as a leader in the social scientific study of education, this series will be home to the next generation of scholarship.

The title of the series references Feminism as a distinct political position and Art Histories as a capacious construct beyond academic and Eurocentric boundaries. The series responds to the urgency of shedding disciplinary baggage, decolonizing knowledge, and modeling art histories that are ethically grounded, committed to structural change, and inclusive in the greatest possible sense.\n\nGenocide, Political Violence, Human Rights\n\nEdited by Alexander Laban Hinton, Nela Navarro, and Natasha Zaretsky\n\nAs we enter the twenty-first century, genocide, war, crimes against humanity, and forms of mass atrocity constitute one of the greatest challenges that confront us. The Rutgers University Press series, Genocide, Political Violence, Human Rights publishes cutting-edge scholarship from across the disciplines that enhance our understanding of such large-scale human rights violations and the principles and mechanisms that seek to prevent them, protect the vulnerable, and help victims recover. A partnership with the Rutgers Center for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights, this series seeks to break new ground not just by publishing outstanding new titles related to its topical focus but also in developing a unique arrangement that will offer many of the authors the opportunity to have their books translated into Spanish and, possibly, other languages.\n\nThis series will include academic books as well as books aimed at a broader audience of practitioners and non-specialist readers.\n\nSERIES EDITORS\n\nAlexander Laban Hinton is Distinguished Professor of Anthropology, Executive and Founding Director of Center for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights.\n\nNela Navarro is Assistant Teaching Professor of Writing, English Department-Writing Program, Rutgers New Brunswick and Associate Director of Center for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights.\n\nNatasha Zaretsky, Clinical Associate Professor, Writing Program, New York University and Visiting Scholar, Center for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights\n\nProposals for consideration should be sent through both regular mail and as email to:\n\nPeggy Solic\n\nSenior Editor\n\n106 Somerset St., 3rd Floor\n\nNew Brunswick, NJ 08901\n\nTel: TBD\n\nEmail: peggy.solic@rutgers.edu\n\nBack to Top\n\nGlobal Film Directors\n\nEdited by Homer B. Pettey and R. Barton Palmer\n\nThe volumes of Global Film Directors will explore cinematic innovations by prominent and emerging directors in major European, American, Asian and African film movements. Each volume will address the history of a director’s oeuvre and its influence upon defining new cinematic genres, narratives, and techniques. Contributing scholars will take a context-oriented approach to evaluating how these directors produced an identifiable style, paying due attention to those forces, both within the industry and national cultures, that led to global recognition of these directors. These volumes will address how directors functioned within national and global marketplaces, contributed to and expanded film movements, and transformed world cinema. By focusing upon representative films that defined the directors’ signatures, these volumes provide new critical focus upon international directors, who are just emerging to prominence or whose work has been largely ignored in standard historical accounts. This series, then, intends to open up the field of new auteurism studies beyond film biographies by exploring directorial style as influencing global cinema aesthetics,theory, and economics.\n\nSERIES EDITORS\n\nHomer B.

On the one hand, they argue that gender and race fundamentally structure labor market opportunity, contributing to growing inequality. Yet others contend that while race and gender may be interconnected categories, they do not definitively affect labor market opportunity in the long term. This disconnect results from the fact that the study of work and labor and the analysis of the impacts of race, gender, and class often proceed on parallel tracks. The intersection of race and gender shapes the life chances of all workers, affording some privileges and others disadvantages that shape labor market behavior – including failures, detours, and successes. The occupational structure is a key location where racial and gender differences are transformed into class inequality, as well as a mechanism by which racial and gender inequality persist. Yet, the uneven distribution of workers across occupations and the grouping of racial/ethnic minorities and women in undesirable places is not comprehensively told.\n\nThis new book series on Inequality at Work: Perspectives on Race, Gender, Class, and Labor will provide a platform for cultivating and disseminating scholarship that deepens our knowledge of the social understandings and implications of work, particularly scholarship that joins empirical investigations with social analysis, cultural critique and historical perspectives. We are especially interested in books that center on the experiences of marginalized workers; that explore the mechanisms (e.g., state or organizational policy) that cause occupational inequality to grow and become entrenched over time; that show us how workers make sense of and articulate their constraints as well as resist them; and have particular timeliness and/or social significance. Prospective topics might include books about migrant labor, rising economic insecurity, enduring gender inequality, public and private sector divisions, glass ceilings (gender limitations at work) and concrete walls (racial limitations at work), or racial/gender identity at work in the Black Lives Matter era.\n\nSERIES EDITOR\n\nEnobong Hannah Branch is an Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Massachusetts–Amherst. Her research interests are in race, racism, and inequality; intersectional theory; work and occupations; and diversity in science.

Its goal is to provide clear and judiciously illustrated accounts of terms currently in use and to chart histories of past usage, so as to provide an entry into vigorous debate. Key words focus on the interrelationship of areas heretofore studied in isolation, and thus they provide the means to reorganizing knowledge in Jewish studies, consonant with current intellectual concerns. The books in the series are useful for the many new programs in the field, supporting teachers and proving attractive for course use. Far from consolidating and narrowing a critical lexicon, deciphering key words stimulates discussion about the boundaries of Jewish studies, its relationship to other forms of cultural studies, and the position of Jewish studies in the larger sphere of culture.

Its premise is that there has been a major shift in play, noticeable since the new millennium, in which the high-low divide of culture has all but broken down. Instead, we find that the “culture industry”, formerly deemed the organ of deception of capitalist consumption, is now a rich haven for discourse and critique. Fashion has a key role to play in this argument. With rare exception, until recently fashion items were relegated to the retail store and the museum, whereas now they are considered valuable components to art collections. With certain fashion has increasingly a critical function once relegated to art, art too is undergoing changes, especially the art that wishes to dissociate from the proclivity toward entertainment that has become the norm for the last 30 years. In short, this series is devoted to documenting the dynamic shifts in aesthetic and material cultures that have developed with extraordinary speed, and which call for new criteria of analysis.\n\nSeries editors:\n\nVicki Karaminas is Professor of Fashion and Director of Doctoral Studies for the school of design at the College of creative Arts, Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand.
