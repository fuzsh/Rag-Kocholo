I have used this app for about 8 months and have spent countless hours animating. I have bought all of the add ons to get the full experience and make my stop motions as best as I can. That said recently I have encountered a problem that is not only irritating but unnecessarily difficult. Recently the merge option has been greyed out, although his might not seem like such a big problem it is really irritating. I am currently working on an ant man and the wasp LEGO trailer stop motion, and a character known as the ghost has powers that require a merge of different slides, the shrinking and growing effects also require the same method but I canât for the life of me figure out how to fix this. I have attempted to contact the developers through the website, but I got an error display and couldnât move further. If this is only a simple bug that can be fixed or a patch that has been ridiculously over complicated than I need to know. I have spent about an hour researching if others have encountered the same problem or are having trouble but I canât find anything, if anyone has any solutions or the developers themselves see this then please help. This is something that I know has worked in the past so there is no reason it shouldnât now.\n\nMax Stop Motion ,\n\nI absolutely love this app but it has a few problems\n\nOk so I have finally found an app that lets me create animations without too much trouble. Itâs very intuitive and has many great features. But as every other app it has itâs problems. One of the ones Iâve had the most issues with is that when I have it set to manual it will still auto correct brightness whenever I put my hand in front of the camera, not sure if itâs my phoneâs fault or the appâs but it is a problem because it creates a lot of light flicker. Another is that whenever I have it zoomed in and I go to look at the pictures I have already taken it resets the zoom. This makes it very difficult to animate dialogue.\n\nI have a few more nitpickey complaints. Mostly just that I canât set the ISO to anything below 100 (I know that expensive cameras donât go below it either.) I often find that my sets are way to bright. And one final complaint, there isnât a slider for white balance. I just feel restricted because it has a set of presets. I also have a suggestion: a feather option for erasing/painting would be awesome. It would create smoother transitions from the previous frame to the next. And also if there is a way please allow us to change the aperture as well.\n\nOverall this is by far my favorite stop motion app and I only want to see it improve. Hope you found this useful."
