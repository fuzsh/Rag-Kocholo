        "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nTempted to take your kids on holiday during term time to avoid high-season rates?\n\nThe controversial trend has been growing along with the cost of living crisis. But parents in the UK will soon face increased fines for taking their children out of school.\n\nAfter surveying parents on the phenomenon in 2022, travel agent Flight Centre UK found that 67 per cent were considering taking their children out of school to secure a cheaper holiday.\n\nBut what are the consequences?\n\nIn the UK, parents will face steeper fines for taking their kids out of school from August 2024, with the minimum rising from £60 (€68) to £80 (€93). The maximum will remain at £2,500 (€2,846).\n\nYet 36 per cent of parents surveyed said they would consider factoring this into their final holiday cost if it worked out cheaper overall.\n\nHow much cheaper are flights outside of school holidays?\n\nSoaring costs are already stretching holidaymakers’ budgets. During school breaks, things get even harder.\n\nA return flight from London to Mallorca in the last week of the summer holidays currently starts at £200 (€233), while one week later it drops to just £49 (€57).\n\nWith fines set to rise for children who miss five or more days, it's possible that fewer parents will risk holidaying during school time.\n\nHere are the penalties parents could face for taking their children out of school across different European countries.\n\nWhat are the rules on taking kids out of school in Austria?\n\nIn Austria, schooling is compulsory between ages six and 15.\n\nIf an unauthorised absence of more than three consecutive days is reported to the authorities by the school, parents could face fines of €110 to €400 or up to two weeks' imprisonment. More than three unexcused absences may be classed as an administrative offence.\n\nAbsence can be requested at the Ministry of Education with proper reasoning. If an approved reason is not given and parents fail to respond to an enquiry, their children could be expelled from school and parents could face bi-weekly visits from Austria's Youth Welfare Services.\n\nWhat are the rules on taking kids out of school in France?\n\nIn France, school attendance is compulsory for children aged three to 16. Authorised absence may be granted for various reasons, including a ‘child following their legal representatives (travel outside school holidays)’, according to the French government website.\n\nParents who are unable to justify their child’s absence or lie about it risk a fine of €135. If absences compromise your child’s education, you could face two years’ imprisonment and a fine of up to €30,000.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn practice, however, this is rarely enforced as it requires that the ‘Education Nationale’ authorities take the case to court.\n\nWhat are the rules on taking kids out of school in Germany?\n\nIn Germany, schooling is compulsory from age six to 16. Parents can be fined for taking their kids out of school without permission from the school’s headteacher. Repeat offenders may even face prosecution.\n\nFines vary by state, ranging from €35 per day in Bremen up to a possible €2,500 total in Berlin.\n\nGerman police have been known to actively check airports for families taking unauthorised school-time holidays, communicating with schools to assess whether absence has been cleared.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nParents may apply for an exemption from their child’s school, which will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. The level of leniency depends on the headteacher.\n\nWhat are the rules on taking kids out of school in Hungary?\n\nIn Hungary, schooling is compulsory from age three to 16.\n\nThere is some leniency for parents taking their children out of school. The school year is split in half, and within each half parents may remove their child from school for up to five days without having to provide a reason.\n\nHowever, they must first seek permission from the school, which will be granted based on the child’s behaviour and performance.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhat are the rules on taking kids out of school in Italy?\n\nIn Italy, schooling is compulsory from age six to 16. Parents taking their children out of primary school could face a fine of up to €30.\n\nIt is generally understood that you cannot take your children out of school during term time. There may be slightly more flexibility for children in private schooling. If absence damages your child’s progress, they could be made to repeat the year.\n\nWhat are the rules on taking kids out of school in the Netherlands?\n\nIn the Netherlands, schooling is compulsory from age five to 16.\n\nSchool absenteeism can be fined at €100 euros per day up to a maximum of €600 euros per family for one week and €900 for two weeks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhat are the rules on taking kids out of school in Norway?\n\nIn Norway, schooling is compulsory from age six to 16.\n\nLeave of up to two weeks can be granted by the headteacher if it is in the interest of the child’s education.\n\nFines can be issued to parents who take their children out of school without gaining permission. However, these are only usually pursued when a child has been away repeatedly or for a long period.\n\nWhat are the rules on taking kids out of school in Spain?\n\nIn Spain, schooling is compulsory from three to 16.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAbsenteeism can result in fines, prison sentences of three to six months and, in extreme cases, loss of parental rights. However, these rules tend to be more dissuasive than enforced.\n\nFines vary as they are set locally by municipalities. These are generally capped at €1,500 for serious cases, but in Madrid they can be as high as €30,000. However, fines are only likely to be pursued in cases where a child misses more than 20 per cent of classes in a month.\n\nWhat are the rules on taking kids out of school in Sweden?\n\nIn Sweden, schooling is compulsory from age six to 16.\n\nPrimary school students may be granted a short period of time off for ‘certain trips, family celebrations or religious holidays’. These must not exceed 10 school days per academic year and are at the discretion of the headteacher. Leave is granted based on a student’s performance and behaviour.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhat are the rules on taking kids out of school in the UK?\n\nParents in the UK face fines of up to £2,500 (€2,850) or even imprisonment for up to three months for taking their kids out of school.\n\nFines will soon start at £80 (€93) per parent for five or more missed days, rising to £160 (€187) each if they are not paid within 21 days. After 28 days, prosecution is a possibility.\n\nAny school-time absence must be pre-authorised by the head teacher and requires ‘exceptional circumstances’ - the terms of which are left to the school’s discretion. Flight Centre’s survey revealed nearly half of all parents surveyed believe that a holiday can be counted under this banner.\n\nMilder consequences of taking your child on holiday during school time without the school’s permission include being issued a parenting order by the court. This means you have to go to parenting classes. You may also be issued with an education supervision order or a school attendance order."
