        "text": "It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much.\n\nPaying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing.\n\nSome people call this awareness \"mindfulness\". Mindfulness can help us enjoy life more and understand ourselves better. You can take steps to develop it in your own life.\n\nWhat is mindfulness?\n\nMindfulness involves paying attention to what is going on inside and outside ourselves, moment by moment.\n\nIt's easy to stop noticing the world around us. It's also easy to lose touch with the way our bodies are feeling and to end up living \"in our heads\" – caught up in our thoughts without stopping to notice how those thoughts are driving our emotions and behaviour.\n\nAn important part of mindfulness is reconnecting with our bodies and the sensations they experience. This means paying attention to the sights, sounds, smells and tastes of the present moment. That might be something as simple as the feel of a banister as we walk upstairs.\n\nAnother important part of mindfulness is an awareness of our thoughts and feelings as they happen moment to moment.\n\nHow mindfulness helps mental wellbeing\n\nBecoming more aware of the present moment can help us enjoy the world around us more and understand ourselves better.\n\nWhen we become more aware of the present moment, we begin to experience afresh things that we have been taking for granted.\n\nMindfulness also allows us to become more aware of the stream of thoughts and feelings that we experience, and to see how we can become entangled in that stream in ways that are not helpful.\n\nThis lets us stand back from our thoughts and start to see their patterns. Gradually, we can train ourselves to notice when our thoughts are taking over and realise that thoughts are simply \"mental events\" that do not have to control us.\n\nMindfulness can help us deal with issues more productively. We can ask: \"Is trying to solve this by brooding about it helpful, or am I just getting caught up in my thoughts?\"\n\nAwareness of this kind may also help us notice signs of stress or anxiety earlier and deal with them better.\n\nMindfulness-based therapies are recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as a way to treat less severe depression.\n\nNICE also recommends that employers make mindfulness available to all employees, to support mental wellbeing at work.\n\nHow to be more mindful\n\nReminding yourself to take notice of your thoughts, feelings, body sensations and the world around you is the first step to mindfulness.\n\nNotice the everyday\n\nAs we go about our daily lives, we can notice the sensations of things, the food we eat, the air moving past the body as we walk.\n\nKeep it regular\n\nIt can be helpful to pick a regular time, such as a morning journey to work or a walk at lunchtime, during which you decide to be aware of the sensations created by the world around you.\n\nTry something new\n\nTrying new things, such as sitting in a different seat in meetings or going somewhere new for lunch, can also help you notice the world in a new way.\n\nWatch your thoughts\n\nSome people find it very difficult to practise mindfulness. As soon as they stop what they're doing, lots of thoughts and worries crowd in.\n\nIt might be useful to remember that mindfulness isn't about making these thoughts go away, but rather about seeing them as mental events that come and go. This can be very hard at first, but with gentle persistence it is possible.\n\nSome people find that it is easier to cope with an over-busy mind if they are doing gentle yoga or walking.\n\nName thoughts and feelings\n\nTo develop an awareness of thoughts and feelings, some people find it helpful to silently name them: \"Here's the thought that I might fail that exam\" or: \"This is anxiety\".\n\nFree yourself from the past and future\n\nYou can practise mindfulness anywhere, but it can be especially helpful to take a mindful approach if you realise that, for several minutes, you have been trapped in reliving past problems or pre-living future worries.\n\nDifferent mindfulness practices\n\nAs well as practising mindfulness in daily life, it can be helpful to set aside time for a more formal mindfulness practice.\n\nMindfulness meditation involves sitting silently and paying attention to thoughts, sounds, the sensations of breathing or parts of the body, bringing your attention back whenever the mind starts to wander.\n\nYoga and tai-chi can also help with developing awareness of your breathing.\n\nInformation:\n\nLearn how to meditate with this beginner’s guide to meditation from Every Mind Matters.\n\nIs mindfulness helpful for everyone?\n\nStudies show that mindfulness can help with stress, anxiety and depression. More research is needed to show whether it helps with other mental health conditions.\n\nMany people find mindfulness helpful, but it's not right for everyone. Some people find that it does not help them, or that it can make them feel worse."
