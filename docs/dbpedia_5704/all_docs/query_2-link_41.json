        "text": "Movies can provide several mental health benefits.\n\nBoost mood\n\nIf you live with an anxiety disorder or depression, or you’re simply anxious and stressed about work and family commitments, taking time to watch a movie could help improve your mood.\n\nA 2016 review found that enjoying leisure activities such as watching movies could boost mood and reduce symptoms of depression.\n\nRelaxation\n\nPleasurable distractions and entertainment could provide rest and relaxation and replenishing qualities, according to a 2017 study.\n\nFinding relaxation by watching a movie might be easier than it sounds. It might be a good idea to eliminate unnecessary distractions during the movie.\n\nIf you have trouble disconnecting from work or other daily stressors, consider leaving your phone and other devices in another room or on “do not disturb” mode so that you’re interrupted only for urgent matters.\n\nYou might find that you’re able to engage your mind with the plot you’re following without distractions, which could make for a more soothing experience.\n\nA musical or romantic comedy, aka rom-com, could be just the distraction you need to relax after a long day.\n\nMotivation\n\nWatching movies could be motivational in many ways.\n\nGiving your mind a break from work for something enjoyable could motivate you to be more productive when you get back to it and to ward off feelings of burnout.\n\nIf the movie highlights someone successfully chasing their ambitions, it could motivate you to do the same. It might also inspire you to take up a new hobby or pursue a new goal, according to a 2020 study.\n\nImprove relationships\n\nIf you’ve been feeling some level of disconnect between someone close to you — whether it’s your romantic partner, best friend, or child — watching movies together could be just the ticket to rekindle your relationship.\n\nIt could be especially helpful if you have the same taste in movies and choose something new that you’re both enthused about watching.\n\nNot only will you bond in the moment of watching, but you might feel a renewed sense of connection when you discuss what you watched afterward.\n\nReduce stress\n\nA good comedy could help lower your stress levels. A 2016 study found that laughter could reduce the levels of hormones in the body responsible for stress, such as cortisol and epinephrine.\n\nIf you’re not in the mood to laugh, consider a drama or tearjerker. Crying could also lower cortisol levels in the blood, according to a 2020 study.\n\nInspire social and cultural reflection\n\nWatching films that take on tough topics could be a thought-provoking experience for you.\n\nWhether you want to better understand a current social issue or spark a conversation about an opposing point of view, watching films could help educate and enlighten."
