        "text": "Project 2025: A wish list for a Trump presidency, explained\n\nA proposed Republican party platform has been approved at the party’s national convention, but a much more detailed proposal from a conservative think tank has also been drawing attention.\n\nProject 2025 was created by the Heritage Foundation and runs for more than 900 pages.\n\nTrump has disavowed Project 2025, though critics have pointed out it was led by former officials in his administration.\n\nThe document calls for the sacking of thousands of civil servants, expanding the power of the president, dismantling the Department of Education, sweeping tax cuts, a ban on pornography, halting sales of the abortion pill, and more.\n\nThere is agreement between many parts of the official Republican platform and Project 2025, although the think-tank document is much more detailed and in some policy areas goes much further than the party line.\n\nThere is a sharper contrast between the two when it comes to the issue of abortion, with Heritage urging much more aggressive anti-abortion policies.\n\nWho wrote Project 2025?\n\nIt is common for Washington think tanks of all political stripes to propose policy wish lists for potential governments-in-waiting.\n\nThe conservative Heritage Foundation first produced policy plans for future Republican administrations in 1981, when Ronald Reagan was about to take office.\n\nIt has produced similar documents in connection with subsequent presidential elections, including in 2016, when Trump won the presidency.\n\nA year into his term, the think tank boasted that the Trump White House had adopted nearly two-thirds of its proposals.\n\nThe Project 2025 report was unveiled in April 2023, but liberal opposition to the document has ramped up now that Trump has extended his polling lead.\n\nThe Republican nominee himself has distanced himself from the proposal.\n\n\"I know nothing about Project 2025,\" he posted on his social media website, Truth Social. \"I have no idea who is behind it.\n\n\"I disagree with some of the things they're saying and some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal.\"\n\nBut the team that created the project is chock-full of former Trump advisers, including director Paul Dans, who was chief of staff at the Office of Personnel Management while Trump was president.\n\nMr Dans left the project in late July, clearing the way for Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts to take over. He said he was leaving during the presidential election season in order to \"direct all my efforts to winning, bigly\".\n\nRussell Vought, another former Trump administration official, wrote a key chapter in the document and also serves as the Republican National Committee’s 2024 platform policy director.\n\nMore than 100 conservative organisations contributed to the document, Heritage says, including many that would be hugely influential in Washington if Republicans took back the White House.\n\nThe Project 2025 document sets out four main policy aims: restore the family as the centrepiece of American life; dismantle the administrative state; defend the nation's sovereignty and borders; and secure God-given individual rights to live freely.\n\nHere's an outline of several of its key proposals.\n\nGovernment\n\nProject 2025 proposes that the entire federal bureaucracy, including independent agencies such as the Department of Justice, be placed under direct presidential control - a controversial idea known as \"unitary executive theory\".\n\nIn practice, that would streamline decision-making, allowing the president to directly implement policies in a number of areas.\n\nThe proposals also call for eliminating job protections for thousands of government employees, who could then be replaced by political appointees.\n\nThe document labels the FBI a \"bloated, arrogant, increasingly lawless organization\". It calls for drastic overhauls of this and several other federal agencies, as well as the complete elimination of the Department of Education.\n\nWhat does the Republican party platform say?\n\nThe party platform includes a proposal to \"declassify government records, root out wrongdoers, and fire corrupt employees\", pledges to slash regulation and government spending. But it stops short of proposing a sweeping overhaul of federal agencies as outlined in Project 2025.\n\nImmigration\n\nIncreased funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border - one of Trump's signature proposals in 2016 - is proposed in the document.\n\nProject 2025 also proposes dismantling the Department of Homeland Security and combining it with other immigration enforcement units in other agencies, creating a much larger and more powerful border policing operation.\n\nOther proposals include eliminating visa categories for crime and human trafficking victims, increasing fees on immigrants and allowing fast-tracked applications for migrants who pay a premium.\n\nWhat does the Republican party platform say?\n\nNot all of those details are repeated in the party platform, but the overall headlines are similar - the party is promising to implement the \"largest deportation programme in American history\".\n\nClimate and economy\n\nThe document proposes slashing federal money for research and investment in renewable energy, and calls for the next president to \"stop the war on oil and natural gas\".\n\nCarbon-reduction goals would be replaced by efforts to increase energy production and energy security.\n\nThe paper sets out two competing visions on tariffs, and is divided on whether the next president should try to boost free trade or raise barriers to imports.\n\nBut the economic advisers suggest that a second Trump administration should slash corporate and income taxes, abolish the Federal Reserve and even consider a return to gold-backed currency.\n\nWhat does the Republican party platform say?\n\nThe party platform does not go as far as Project 2025 in these policy areas. The platform instead talks of bringing down inflation and drilling for oil to reduce energy costs, but is thin on specific policy proposals.\n\nAbortion and family\n\nProject 2025 does not call outright for a nationwide abortion ban.\n\nHowever, it proposes withdrawing the abortion pill mifepristone from the market, and using existing but little-enforced laws to stop the drug being sent through the post.\n\nThe document suggests that the department of Health and Human Services should \"maintain a biblically based, social science-reinforced definition of marriage and family\".\n\nWhat does the Republican party platform say?\n\nOn this issue at least, the document differs fairly substantially from the Republican platform, which only mentions the word \"abortion\" once. The platform says abortion laws should be left to individual states and that late-term abortions (which it does not define) should be banned.\n\nIt adds that that access to prenatal care, birth control and in-vitro fertilisation should be protected. The party platform makes no mention of cracking down on the distribution of mifepristone.\n\nTech and education\n\nSocial Security\n\nAlthough Heritage has long supported reforming the country's public pension plan, Project 2025 barely touches this third rail of American politics.\n\nWhat does the Republican party platform say?\n\nThe platform says Social Security is a \"lifeline\" for millions of retired Americans and Republicans will \"restore Economic Stability to ensure the long-term sustainability\" of the programme.\n\nThe plan's future\n\nProject 2025 is backed by a $22m (£17m) budget and includes strategies for implementing policies immediately after the presidential inauguration in January 2025.\n\nHeritage is also creating a database of conservative loyalists to fill government positions, and a programme to train those new workers.\n\nDemocrats led by Jared Huffman, a congressman from California, have launched a Stop Project 2025 Task Force.\n\nAnd many of the proposals would likely face immediate legal challenges from Trump's opponents if implemented."
