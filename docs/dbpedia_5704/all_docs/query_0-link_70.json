Or \"Thelma & Louise,\" which was as much about female empowerment as it was about a movie about two people on the run from the law.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Almost Famous\" (2000)\n\nCameron Crowe's love letter to the 1970s rock and roll scene, which he covered as a writer for Rolling Stone, is a fun look at adolescence, fame, and highlights the non-stop grind of a band being \"on the road.\"\n\n\"The Blues Brothers\" (1980)\n\nJohn Belushi and Dan Aykroyd play two brothers on a mission from God. Trying to get on the straight-and-narrow after getting out of prison, Jake Blues (Belushi) and his brother Elwood (Aykroyd) decide to help raise the money the Catholic home they were raised in needs to stay open. That leads to a road trip around Illinois to get the band back together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan\" (2006)\n\nWith the help of director Larry Charles, Sacha Baron Cohen creates one of the funniest road trip movies ever made as he takes his character, Borat, to America to marry Pamela Anderson. But in the process, the movie highlights the US itself, as Borat travels the country doing everything from singing the Kazakhstan national anthem at a rodeo to hanging out with some fraternity kids.\n\n\"Dumb and Dumber\" (1994)\n\nIn this Farrelly brothers classic, friends Lloyd (Jim Carrey) and Harry (Jeff Daniels) are convinced the gas man is out to get them after the death of their bird, so they decide to drive to Aspen to hand-deliver a briefcase the beautiful Mary (Lauren Holly) \"forgot\" at the airport. Oh, and they are hitting the road in a truck that's made up to look like a dog.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Easy Rider\" (1969)\n\nIt's the movie that launched the \"New Hollywood\" era of the 1970s and was made with little money and lots of drugs.\n\nDirected by Dennis Hopper, the Hollywood bad boy also stars alongside Peter Fonda as two hippie bikers (Jack Nicholson also shows up) who travel from LA to New Orleans after cashing in on smuggling cocaine from Mexico. On their freewheeling trip, they find an America that's split between the stuffy establishment and the younger generation that is starving for change.\n\n\"The End of the Tour\" (2015)\n\nThe days of conversations between Rolling Stone reporter David Lipsky (Jesse Eisenberg) and author David Foster Wallace (Jason Segel) are beautifully profiled in director James Ponsoldt's intimate story that has the two men interacting while on the road for Wallace's book tour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Into the Wild\" (2007)\n\nBased on a true story, Christopher McCandless' quest to go off the grid and hitchhike to Alaska to live in the wilderness is a powerful exploration of human desire and the kindness of strangers.\n\n\"It Happened One Night\" (1934)\n\nFrank Capra's famous movie is romantic comedy at its best. Claudette Colbert plays a spoiled heiress running from home, and Clark Gable is a reporter who finally thinks he's found a story that will get him some attention as he follows her to New York. But it will be forever known for its hitchhiking scene in which Colbert's character gets them a ride by pulling up her skirt to show off her legs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Little Miss Sunshine\" (2006)\n\nFilled with an all-star cast including Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Greg Kinnear, Paul Dano, Alan Arkin, and Abigail Breslin, we follow a dysfunctional family as they jump in a VW bus to drive the young Olive (Breslin) on a cross-country trip to the finals of a beauty pageant she's competing in.\n\n\"Logan\" (2017)\n\nMarking the coda of the Hugh Jackman era as Wolverine, director James Mangold delivers a somber drama of the superhero's final days. Here he and Charles Xavier set out to drive a young mutant to a refuge in North Dakota. That sounds simple, but it definitely isn't.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Magic Mike XXL\" (2015)\n\nIn this fantastic sequel to the 2012 original, Mike (Channing Tatum) sets out on the road with the remaining members of the Kings of Tampa in a food truck to Myrtle Beach for one final performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Midnight Run\" (1988)\n\nRobert De Niro is fantastic in this foul-mouthed comedy as bounty hunter Jack Walsh who plans to cash in when he tracks down a sneaky accountant (played by Charles Grodin) who has jumped bail.\n\nBut with the FBI, other bounty hunters, and the mob also trying to get their hands on his bounty, things aren't easy for Jack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Motorcycle Diaries\" (2004)\n\nBased on the Che Guevara memoir he wrote before becoming the Marxist revolutionary, Gael García Bernal plays young Guevara who, in 1952, went on a trip across South America with his friend Alberto Granado (Rodrigo de la Serna). The experience shaped Guevara's life as it showed him the injustices of the world.\n\n\"The Muppet Movie\" (1979)\n\nMarking the first time the Muppets appear on the big screen, Kermit, Fozzie Bear and the rest of the gang go on a cross-country drive to Hollywood in hopes of making it big. A load of cameos, songs, and hilarity occur along the way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"National Lampoon's Vacation\" (1983)\n\nThis classic from director Harold Ramis stars Chevy Chase as one of his most memorable characters, Clark W. Griswold, the ambitious father whose vacation plans always never work out.\n\nClark takes the family cross-country to Walley World and in the process leaves chaos in his wake.\n\n\"On the Road\" (2012)\n\nBased on the iconic Jack Kerouac novel, Sam Riley plays the book's narrator, Sal Paradise, who after meeting Dean (Garrett Hedlund) and Marylou (Kristen Stewart), head on a free-spirited road trip across the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Over the Top\" (1987)\n\nSylvester Stallone plays trucker and arm wrestling pro Lincoln Hawk who needs to get to Las Vegas to compete in the world arm wrestling tournament. But he also has to get his estranged son to his dying mother. This all leads to a big-rig father-and-son road trip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\" (1985)\n\nA loose parody of Vittorio De Sica's classic \"Bicycle Thieves,\" Tim Burton makes his own classic around the zany antics of Paul Reubens' hit character Pee-wee Herman.\n\nThe movie follows the \"boy\" as he goes to search of his stolen bike, which he's been told by a psychic is in the basement of the Alamo (spoiler alert: there's no basement in the Alamo).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Planes, Trains & Automobiles\" (1987)\n\nSteve Martin and John Candy play two men who suddenly have to become travel companions as they try to get home for the holidays. Written and directed by John Hughes, Martin and Candy together are a delight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Rain Man\" (1988)\n\nTom Cruise plays sleazy Charlie Babbitt and Dustin Hoffman is his brother Raymond, who suffers from savant syndrome. Hoping to cash in on the fortune Raymond got from their father, Charlie sets the two out on a cross-country trip leading to a lot of self-discovery.\n\nIf you've never seen Barry Levinson's Oscar-winning movie, now's the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Road Trip\" (2000)\n\nOf course \"Road Trip\" was going to be on this list. Todd Phillips' insane raunchy comedy about four college friends on a race against time to retrieve a sex tape sent in the mail to one of their girlfriends is always a fun watch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Smokey and the Bandit\" (1977)\n\nBurt Reynolds teams with his pal and longtime stunt double Hal Needham for his first directing effort, and it would go on to become a classic road trip movie.\n\nReynolds plays a fast-driving bootlegger who has to transport 400 cases of Coors beer safely from Texarkana to Atlanta. But things get complicated when Reynolds picks up a runaway bride (played by Sally Field) along the way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Straight Story\" (1999)\n\nIn one of David Lynch's most traditional storytelling offerings, Richard Farnsworth plays a man who sets out on a trip via riding a lawnmower to make things right with his ill brother.\n\nThe story is based on a real-life event, in which Alvin Straight traveled 240 miles from Iowa to Wisconsin on a lawnmower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Stranger Than Paradise\" (1984)\n\nJim Jarmusch's second feature film follows Willie and his friend Eddie as they set out on a road trip to Cleveland to visit Willie's cousin from Hungary, Eva.\n\nThe movie went on to be regarded as a landmark work in the independent film world for its unconventional long takes and do-it-yourself aesthetic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Thelma & Louise\" (1991)\n\nRidley Scott's look at the road-trip-turned-manhunt adventure of friends Thelma (Geena Davis) and Louise (Susan Sarandon) is arguably more powerful today because of the #MeToo than when it opened in the early 1990s.\n\n\"Tommy Boy\" (1995)\n\nPerhaps the best Chris Farley/David Spade collaboration, in this one Farley plays an underachieving college graduate who suddenly has to travel the nation (with Spade as the geeky sidekick) to keep the accounts for his auto-parts family business after his father dies. This one truly shows off Farley's high-energy comedy greatness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead next\n\nMovies\n\nAdvertisement"
