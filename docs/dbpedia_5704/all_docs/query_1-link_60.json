        "text": "When they reflect on comprehensive classroom behavior management, teachers should always keep in mind that one of the major influences on behavior is the students’ culture. Culture is a word we use to loosely describe any of the beliefs, norms, and practices characteristic of a particular society, group, or place. And because teachers themselves come from particular societies, groups, and places, they must be mindful that their own beliefs and practices can be likewise influenced, as can the broader policies, practices, and expectations of the schools and districts in which they teach.\n\nCulture is such a powerful influence on our outlooks and behaviors that often we are not even aware of it, instead believing our perspectives are “just the way things are.” In the context of increasingly diverse classroom settings, such unexamined beliefs can lead to avoidable conflict and a loss of valuable instructional time.\n\nDefining Cultural Gaps\n\nAlthough there are many different cultures within the United States, the education system’s definition of what is “appropriate behavior” typically reflects white, middle-class cultural norms and values. These norms are reflected in broader school district practices and policies, as well as classroom expectations around behavior, communication, classroom dynamics, and family engagement. This can result in a cultural gap. In education, a cultural gap refers to any significant disparity in world views, values, and expectations that exist between a teacher (or the school culture as a whole) and racially and ethnically diverse students. Often times, these disparities negatively impact the success of diverse student populations.\n\nWhen we take into account the fact that student populations are becoming more and more diverse while the majority of classroom instructors are not, this cultural gap becomes especially acute. It’s important for teachers to identify and anticipate cultural gaps that may influence their behaviors and interactions with their students, preferably before they occur.\n\nIdentifying Cultural Gaps\n\nOnce we are aware of the possibility of these culture gaps—and the problems that might arise because of them—we can take thoughtful steps toward a better, more thorough understanding of them. What do cultural gaps actually look like in practice? How might they affect interactions between a teacher and her students in a real classroom setting? Take a moment to read through the table below. Though by no means exhaustive, the examples included here illustrate certain specific perspectives and approaches that might result in cultural gaps.\n\nAlthough teachers should have an understanding of the differing cultural perspectives of their students, they should also keep in mind that not everyone with the same ethnic or racial background has the same values. In other words, teachers should avoid cultural stereotypes—oversimplified beliefs used to define a culture or group of people.\n\nIn the same way, teachers should reflect on their own cultural perspectives, values, beliefs, and behaviors. By understanding their own cultural perspectives, those of their students, and those promoted by the school, teachers can better identify cultural gaps. Once teachers understand why these gaps exist, they are ready to learn how to address them.\n\nListen as Ashley Lloyd discusses strategies for identifying cultural gaps and describes an experience that she had that lead to a deeper understanding of how culture might influence behavior. Next, KaMalcris Cottrell discusses how she addresses cultural gaps. Finally, Melissa Patterson discusses how she respectfully addresses cultural gaps.\n\nAddressing Cultural Gaps\n\nBecause cultural gaps can impact engagement with students, teachers should create a classroom where students’ cultures are acknowledged, respected, and reflected. They can do this by implementing culturally sustaining practices—practices that not only accept but foster students’ cultural norms and values. These practices are designed to recognize and bridge cultural gaps and represent a shift from the traditional focus of schools, where students are expected to adopt white, middle class norms and to change or shed behaviors that don’t align with the school’s or teacher’s expectations.\n\nAlthough culturally sustaining practices may look different depending on the context, teachers can:\n\nEvaluate current classroom practices\n\nIdentify the foundations of existing practices\n\nReview practices to determine and reduce potential areas of culturally based conflict\n\nIf cultural gaps exist, determine whether practices have to be done in a particular way or whether changes can be made\n\nEstablish and teach clear classroom expectations that help students feel safe and secure\n\nBe open with students about differences in school practices and expectations and those in the home or community\n\nIncorporate the cultures of the students in the classroom by:\n\nMaking sure that the curricula and materials reflect the historical and contemporary cultures of the children represented in the classroom and in the community\n\nBringing in community and family members as part of regular classroom practice\n\nListen as Lori Delale-O’Connor discusses culturally sustaining practices. Next, listen as she explains how culture plays a role in classroom behavior management practices and why it is important to examine these practices with a cultural lens.\n\nTo learn more about cultural influences on behavior and how demographic differences can lead to cultural gaps that negatively impact students, we encourage you to listen to Lori Delale-O’Connor in this extended IRIS Interview. In addition, she offers examples of how teachers can implement culturally sustaining practices to create inclusive classrooms where all students feel supported.\n\nCultural Influences on Behavior\n\nTo learn more about student diversity, view the following IRIS Modules:"
