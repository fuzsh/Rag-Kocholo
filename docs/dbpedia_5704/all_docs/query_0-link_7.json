        "text": "by Annette D’Agostino Lloyd\n\nFires at Pathé and Greenacres – with many casualties…\n\nIncredibly sad events which gave Harold Lloyd an even greater appreciation for his work.\n\nOn January 17, 1938, a series of explosions, following a fire in the boiler room of Pathé Exchange’s East Bound Brook, NJ plant, seriously damaged its two-story warehouse, and destroyed a large quantity of the films that were stored there. Among them were many of the early movies that Hal Roach and Harold Lloyd collaborated on in the early phase of their careers.\n\nConsequently, in July of 1938, Harold purchased the negatives of 114 of his surviving films from Pathé, the films that survived the January fire. Variety called this a purchase made for “sentimental and business reasons” – and while Lloyd the businessman might have liked the idea of gaining sole ownership of his films (so he could, for instance, safely and ethically recycle a successful gag from a past picture), there is no question that Harold wished to take care of his cinematic legacy himself.\n\nAmongst the films now in his possession were much of his Lonesome Luke output, and scores of Glass Character one-reelers, along with all the multiple-reel and feature-length films. Lloyd stored his prized possessions in a newly constructed film vault, connected to the service buildings on his Greenacres estate. A little over five years later, something went terribly wrong.\n\nOn August 5, 1943, a nitrate explosion and fire ripped through the film vault, destroying many of the films Lloyd took possession of in 1938. Harold tried, diligently, to save as many of the cans of film as he could, running in and out of the vault, frantically tossing unhurt reels to safety. However, the damage was immense, and not just to the films.\n\nSeven firefighters and one Greenacres employee were overcome by smoke inhalation, and were taken to a nearby hospital. The damage to the actual structure and surrounding property was estimated (by Harold) at $2 million.\n\nHowever, the true casualty was film history, for most of the early films of Harold Lloyd perished in that fire.\n\nA whopping 53 of the total 67 Lonesome Luke films are not known to survive, and most of them died that day. Granted, these Luke films were probably no masterpieces, but they were stepping stones in the continuing evolution of Lloyd’s greatness – and they’ll never be seen again – it’s still a shame.\n\nLonesome Luke was not the only screen character to suffer from the events of August 5, 1943. The following 15 Glass Character single-reel films (listed in the order in which they were produced) are not known to survive, and possibly were lost in the explosion:\n\nStep Lively\n\nThe Lamb\n\nHit Him Again\n\nSic ‘Em Towser\n\nBride and Gloom\n\nTwo Scrambled\n\nKicking the Germ Out of Germany\n\nBees In His Bonnet\n\nGoing! Going! Gone!\n\nWanted $5000\n\nSi Senor\n\nHe Leads, Others Follow\n\nSoft Money\n\nCount the Votes\n\nHis Only Father\n\nDon’t be too sad, however – the news is not all bad.\n\nThere is a lot of Lloyd for you to see…\n\nThe character that Harold Lloyd played before Lonesome Luke, Willie Work, is able to be seen in the lone surviving film of that series, Just Nuts. This was the film, ironically, that so impressed Pathé that they offered a contract to Hal Roach to distribute all of the Harold Lloyd Comedies. Pathé went on to distribute every Lloyd film through 1925.\n\nA miraculous 14 Lonesome Luke films are known to survive to this day:\n\nGiving Them Fits\n\nPeculiar Patients’ Pranks\n\nLuke the Candy Cut-Up\n\nLuke and the Rural Roughnecks\n\nLuke, Crystal Gazer\n\nLuke and the Bangtails\n\nLuke Joins the Navy\n\nLuke’s Movie Muddle\n\nLuke Locates the Loot\n\nLuke’s Shattered Sleep\n\nLonesome Luke’s Wild Women\n\nLonesome Luke on Tin Can Alley\n\nLonesome Luke, Messenger\n\nLonesome Luke in When Clubs Are Trump\n\nThree of these titles (Luke Joins the Navy, Luke Locates the Loot and Lonesome Luke, Messenger) are amongst the holdings of the Harold Lloyd Film Estate and Trust. The other Luke shorts, as well as all the other extant films of Harold Lloyd, can be found in archives the world over: see the HL.us Archives page for an up-to-date list of all known repositories that house Lloyd films.\n\nHappily, the Trust owns all of the multiple-reel and feature-length films, plus Lloyd’s two theatrically released compilations, and two clip-laden offerings (“Down Memory Lane” and “Laugh Parade”) produced for the Shriners in the 1940s.\n\nOf the 81 produced, 63 single-reel Glass Character films are known to survive. Of that number, the following 33 (listed in the order in which they were produced) are held by the Trust:\n\nPinched\n\nBy the Sad Sea Waves\n\nRainbow Island\n\nThe Flirt\n\nMove On\n\nBashful\n\nThe Big Idea\n\nA Gasoline Wedding\n\nLook Pleasant, Please\n\nHere Come the Girls\n\nHey There!\n\nKicked Out\n\nThe Non-Stop Kid\n\nIt’s a Wild Life\n\nPipe the Whiskers\n\nThat’s Him\n\nWhy Pick on Me?\n\nTake a Chance\n\nAsk Father\n\nThe Dutiful Dub\n\nNext Aisle Over\n\nRing Up the Curtain\n\nThe Marathon\n\nPistols for Breakfast\n\nOff the Trolley\n\nA Jazzed Honeymoon\n\nNever Touched Me\n\nBilly Blazes, Esq.\n\nHeap Big Chief\n\nA Sammy in Siberia\n\nPay Your Dues\n\nSpring Fever\n\nJust Neighbors\n\nThe remaining 33 extant single-reel Glass Character films (listed in the order in which they were produced) are held in the collections of other archives worldwide:\n\nOver the Fence\n\nBliss\n\nAll Aboard\n\nThe Tip\n\nLet’s Go\n\nBeat It\n\nOn the Jump\n\nFollow the Crowd\n\nTwo Gun Gussie\n\nFireman, Save My Child\n\nThe City Slicker\n\nSomewhere in Turkey\n\nAre Crooks Dishonest?\n\nAn Ozark Romance\n\nSwing Your Partners\n\nHear ‘Em Rave\n\nNothing But Trouble\n\nShe Loves Me Not\n\nI’m On My Way\n\nOn the Fire\n\nLook Out Below\n\nJust Dropped In\n\nCrack Your Heels\n\nYoung Mr. Jazz\n\nBefore Breakfast\n\nBack to the Woods\n\nSwat the Crook\n\nAt the Old Stage Door\n\nA Jazzed Honeymoon\n\nChop Suey & Company\n\nDon’t Shove\n\nBe My Wife\n\nThe Rajah (fragment)\n\nLong may they live. And, here’s hoping that the continuing film preservation movement necessitates the addition of more extant films of Harold Lloyd!\n\n© Annette D’Agostino Lloyd"
