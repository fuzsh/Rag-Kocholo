        "text": "In fact, the brain is hardwired to deliver a wider range of reactions, which can be summed up as fight, flight, freeze, fawn and flop. The latter two being the least discussed and talked about.\n\nAll of them are a natural outcome of fearful situations or extended periods of trauma. With Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or C-PTSD, they can leave a lasting legacy and become a recurrent behaviour.\n\nThis article explains what Fight, Flight, Freeze, Fawn and flop are. It also explores the link between PTSD and C-PTSD and fawning behaviour in more detail.\n\nThe scientific background\n\nFirst, a quick overview of the terminology.\n\nThe first three are obvious. At times of immense stress, it’s common for people to: become combative or overly defensive (fight); to abruptly remove themselves from the situation (flight); or shut down, become withdrawn and unable to make decisions (freeze). This may manifest as any of the following:\n\nThe Fight Trauma response\n\nTemper that is very explosive and unpredictable\n\nTaunts, mocks, insults or shames\n\n“My way or the highway” tendency to need the final say and ignore others perspectives\n\nYells, slams doors, screams, becomes aggressive\n\nEasily becomes reactive (can confuse people with their ‘big’ emotions)\n\nAlways feels as though they’re being threatened, will protect themselves at any cost\n\nOften feels shameful/remorseful post outburst\n\n‘Talking back’ to authority figures\n\nThe Flight Trauma response\n\nChronic rushing or ‘always going’\n\nFeels uncomfortable (or even panic) when still\n\nEnergy spent micromanaging people and situations around them\n\nHas a history of abruptly ending relationships or phobic of commitment\n\nFeels trapped easily\n\nMakes plans to avoid any downtime or throws themselves in to work/achievement\n\nOften presents as anxiety or panic attacks\n\nBeing intentionally or unintentionally distracted\n\nThe Freeze Trauma response\n\nFeeling completely numb, life is ‘pointless’\n\nShutdown (silent treatment, complete avoidance)\n\nHiding out from the world\n\nProcrastination or inability to make even small decisions\n\nEndless social media scrolling/binge TV watching\n\nConfusion over what is real or unreal (or actually happening)\n\nOften confused/misdiagnosed with depression\n\nGiving up quickly\n\nThe fourth response – fawn – refers to when someone actually moves closer to the source of their trauma and tries to placate or win over their aggressor and may manifest itself in the following ways:\n\nThe Fawn Trauma response\n\nPeople-pleasing\n\nGoing along with another person’s perspective, belief’s or values without connecting with your own\n\nDissociating (leaving the body), ‘spacing out’\n\nLets other people make decisions\n\nAvoids and situation that could lead to conflict\n\nFears saying ‘no’\n\nOverly polite and agreeable\n\nHyper aware of other people’s emotions and needs while betraying your own\n\nRelying on others to help solve problems\n\nThese are natural reactions triggered by part of our brain. The brain’s limbic system has evolved least since primitive times.\n\nIn fact, we share this instinctive behaviour with other animal life! Any creature responds quickly to potential danger by fighting back, running or becoming totally still. Or, to diffuse danger they form a closer attachment to their aggressor (fawn).\n\nFawning as a response to trauma\n\nTo outsiders, the fawn response can mask the distress and damage you’re suffering. If you were really being mistreated, why would you be trying to please the person responsible?\n\nIt can also be the response that engenders the greatest sense of confusion and guilt in someone with PTSD or C-PTSD. This person has treated you – or is treating you – badly, Yet, your natural instinct is to attempt to soothe them, instead of distancing yourself or fighting back.\n\nFawning (or misplaced attachment) is a common reaction to childhood abuse. The victim responds to an abusive parent or some other authority figure by being highly agreeable, pressing down their own needs and their knowledge that the abuse is wrong.\n\nIn later life, it can manifest as being highly submissive, looking to others to shape your reactions and relationships and struggling to make sense of yourself or your daily life on your own.\n\nCharacteristics of fawning behaviour also include over-dependence on the opinions of others and lacking boundaries. It makes you highly vulnerable to narcissistic people, or anyone who tends to control and manipulate others.\n\nAddressing flight, fight, freeze and fawn responses\n\nSome experts within the field of trauma response add a fifth potential reaction; flop. This is when someone reacts to intensely stressful situations by becoming totally overwhelmed and physically and mentally unresponsive and may manifest itself in the following ways:\n\nThe Flop Trauma response\n\nVery similar to ‘freeze’ trauma response, but may also include\n\nTotal bodily collapse (which might involve blacking out or loss of consciousness)\n\nLoss of control over bodily functions\n\nTotal disorientation\n\nAppearing disengaged\n\nShowing a lack of emotions\n\nComplete submission\n\nWhen you have PTSD or C-PTSD, symptoms like hypervigilance and heightened arousal, or depressive episodes and hypoarousal, can mean you display any of these responses frequently. Sometimes within relatively unthreatening situations.\n\nOther trauma responses\n\nURGENCY: ‘Traumatic events require us to act quickly, without much thought for the long term. Trauma responses limit our ability to slow down and be mindful of the big picture. When you notice yourself feeling like you need to figure out everything all at once, pause and notice your breath. Notice the urgent energy with compassion. Validate the part of your that feels threatened. Let that part of you know: “I see you, I know you feel afraid. I’m here for you now.\n\nIn addition to acknowledging this part of us with compassion, we can also use the power of the breath to release these trauma responses from our nervous system.’"
