        "text": "1982 US sex comedy film by Boaz Davidson\n\nThe Last American VirginDirected byBoaz DavidsonWritten byBoaz DavidsonProduced by\n\nYoram Globus\n\nMenahem Golan\n\nDavid Womark\n\nStarringCinematographyAdam GreenbergEdited byBruria DavidsonDistributed byThe Cannon Group, Inc.\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n92 minutesCountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishBox office$5.8 million[2][3]\n\nThe Last American Virgin is a 1982 American coming-of-age sex comedy film written and directed by Boaz Davidson, and starring Lawrence Monoson, Diane Franklin, Steve Antin, Joe Rubbo, and Louisa Moritz. A remake of Davidson's 1978 Israeli film Lemon Popsicle,[4][5] it follows a Los Angeles high school student who, while attempting to lose his virginity, falls in love with one of his female classmates as she begins dating his rebellious best friend.\n\nAfter the success of the original film and its sequels in Israel, Davidson re-teamed with producers Golan-Globus to attempt to recreate the same success in the United States. Though the film's plot and characters remained largely the same, the setting was updated from 1950s Israel to then-present day suburban Los Angeles of the 1980s. The soundtrack, a major facet of both films, was also updated from the original's golden oldies to more contemporary new wave rock.\n\nReleased in the summer of 1982, The Last American Virgin received mixed reviews from critics, with some noting its nuanced portrayal of teenagers, and others deriding it for its crude sexual humor. In the years since its release, the film has been noted for its downbeat conclusion[6] and has acquired a cult following.[7]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Los Angeles, high school student Gary works after school as a pizza delivery boy for Pink Pizza. His best friends are Rick, a slick-talking ladies' man, and the overweight David. While out at a soda shop one night, Gary notices Karen, a new student who has just moved to the area along with her new best friend Rose. Gary instantly falls in love with Karen. Afterwards, Gary meets up with Rick and David in the same shop, and the three boys pick up three girls with the false promise of offering them cocaine. At Gary's house, the boys present Sweet'n Low to the girls, who snort it. Rick and David prepare to have sex with two of the girls, leaving Gary paired with the overweight Millie. As Gary attempts to cut off Millie's bra with scissors, his parents return home, putting a stop to his plans.\n\nIn the locker room at school the next day, Gary, Rick, David, and others find their classmate Victor spying on the girls' locker room through a peephole and tease him. Angry, Victor asserts he has a larger penis than all of them, prompting the boys to have a contest where they measure each other's erections to see whose is largest.\n\nA love triangle develops between Gary, Rick, and Karen. To get closer to Karen, Gary deflates her bike tires and invites her to ride to school with him. During and after the ride, he tries to woo her, to no avail. That evening, Gary attends a party at David's house and is devastated to find Karen in company with Rick. He tries to entice her away from his friend, failing again. He becomes drunk and makes a fool of himself, then creates an embarrassing scene in front of his parents' dinner guests when he goes home.\n\nOne day, Gary delivers pizza to Carmela, a Latina whose sailor boyfriend is never home, and she tells him she wants more than just pizza. Being too afraid to follow up on it, he leaves and convinces his friends to return to her house with him. Carmela has sex with Rick and David, but her boyfriend Paco returns home just as Gary is about to have his turn, prompting them to flee.\n\nTo keep Rick and Karen apart, Gary and David persuade Rick to join them with a prostitute known to work a busy highway corner in the neighborhood. Gary's encounter with her is awkward and unpleasant, causing him to vomit. The next day at school, all three boys realize they have contracted pubic lice, and after trying unsuccessfully to drown them in a public swimming pool, they have to bring their problem to an middle-aged pharmacist.\n\nEventually, after Karen and Rick have sex, she becomes pregnant, and he dumps her. Enraged, Gary confronts Rick, and a physical fight occurs, with Rick calling Gary jealous and Gary denouncing Rick as a lowlife. Gary decides to help Karen pay for an abortion by selling most of his possessions and borrowing money from his boss. After the abortion, Gary and Karen spend the remainder of the weekend alone together in Gary's grandmother's house. While nursing Karen back to health, Gary says that he loves her. Karen appears to reciprocate, and they kiss. Karen invites Gary to her eighteenth birthday party the following week. Gary scrapes up more dollars and buys Karen an engraved gold locket for her birthday.\n\nWhen Gary arrives at Karen's birthday party, his dreams of a lasting romance with her are shattered when he walks in on her kissing Rick. Despite what Rick had put Karen through, and despite Gary's devotion and support, she has still rejected Gary to be with Rick. Gary leaves the party without saying a word to either of them, taking Karen's gift with him. He drives home alone, dejected, with tears streaming down his face.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nLawrence Monoson as Gary\n\nDiane Franklin as Karen\n\nSteve Antin as Rick\n\nJoe Rubbo as David\n\nLouisa Moritz as Carmela\n\nBrian Peck as Victor\n\nKimmy Robertson as Rose\n\nTessa Richarde as Brenda\n\nWinifred Freedman as Millie\n\nGerri Idol as Roxanne\n\nPhil Rubenstein as Gino\n\nZach Mahoney as Big Meat\n\nRoberto Rodriquez as Paco\n\nHarry Bugin as Doctor\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nDevelopment\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film was directed by Boaz Davidson, and is a remake of his 1978 Israeli film Lemon Popsicle, which features a similar plot.[8] Lemon Popsicle had been produced by Yoram Globus and Menahem Golan, who had then recently acquired the American film distribution company Cannon Films. Davidson, Globus, and Golan developed the project, with Davidson retooling some elements to appeal to an American audience.\n\nCasting\n\n[edit]\n\nDavidson intentionally sought inexperienced teenage actors to appear in the film, and held casting calls in New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles.[8] Lawrence Monoson, who had originally auditioned for a minor part, was selected by Davidson to star as Gary, beating out 200 other actors contending for the role.[8] The film marked the debuts of several actors, including Joe Rubbo, Steve Antin, Kimmy Robertson, and Winifred Freedman.[8]\n\nFilming\n\n[edit]\n\nPrincipal photography of The Last American Virgin began in late 1981 in Los Angeles and Malibu.[8] Birmingham High School and Reseda High School served as the principal locations for the school sequences.[8] Approximately seventy percent of the film was shot using handheld cameras.[8] Filming was completed in early 1982, with some additional photography occurring in New York City.[8]\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Last American Virgin opened regionally in several U.S. cities on July 30, 1982.[11][12] It premiered in Los Angeles on September 24, 1982, and in New York City on January 14, 1983.[8]\n\nThe film remained in theatrical circulation for 21 weeks, with its widest release comprising 158 theaters.[2] By its tenth week of release in October 1982, the film had ranked at number eleven at the U.S. box office.[2] It ultimately grossed a total of $5,829,781 domestically.[2]\n\nCritical response\n\n[edit]\n\nCandice Russell of the Sun Sentinel praised the film as humorous and distinctive from other teen films of the time, such as Porky's (1981) and Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982), adding: \"The awkwardness, frailty and passion of young people is portrayed with uncommon honesty. There isn't a patronizing or false line of dialogue in the whole film.\"[13]\n\nLinda Gross of the Los Angeles Times disliked the film, finding moments of it \"distasteful and offensive\", summarizing it overall as \"conventionally and crudely told.\"[14] The Atlanta Constitution's Eleanor Rigel similarly felt the film was \"needlessly tasteless\" and \"completely wastes a potentially interesting theme as well as some acceptable performances by its cast of newcomers.\"[15] The film's depiction of an abortion also garnered it some controversy.\n\nResponding to criticism dismissing The Last American Virgin as distasteful, critic Noel Murray of The A.V. Club commented: \"Really, the film's frankness makes it more honest than its dreamy-eyed descendants; even the shallow treatment of girls captures the point of view of a luckless teenage boy.\"[17]\n\nIn an essay written a quarter-century after its release, critic Andy Selsberg noted that, unlike the other teen sex comedies of the 1980s, The Last American Virgin was the only one truthful enough to have a \"main character... left longing for his dream girl\", whereas all the others were \"acheless\".[18] In another retrospective assessment for MovieWeb, Evan Jacobs lauded the film for its conclusion, describing it as \"nothing short of soul crushing.... the ending is truly what makes The Last American Virgin a special film... it elicits the same feelings no matter how many times you watch it, this supposedly disposable movie (from Cannon Films no less!) rises to the level of art.\"[7] Writing for Birth.Movies.Death, Todd Gilchrist notes of the film's conclusion: \"The first time you see this, it’s shocking, almost laughable. But subsequent viewings of the movie expose just how calculated and methodical its escalation is over the course of its running time, watching these kids playing at being adults, then having to deal with the real consequences of their actions, and finally, being confronted by the emotional realities of a world that can and will betray their best intentions and deepest desires.\"[19]\n\nAs of June 2023 , The Last American Virgin holds a 77% rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on thirteen reviews.[20]\n\nHome media\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film was released on VHS, Betamax and CED Videodisc by Cannon Films in 1983. The film was released by Guild Home Video on LaserDisc with a digital stereo soundtrack in 1984.\n\nMGM Home Entertainment released the film on DVD in 2003.[21] Arrow Films released a Blu-ray and DVD combination edition in the United Kingdom in 2013,[22] followed by a North American Blu-ray released in 2015 by Olive Films.[23] In January 2023, MVD Visual, in association with MGM, released a new special edition Blu-ray.[24]\n\nSoundtrack\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Last American VirginSoundtrack album by\n\nVarious Artists\n\nReleased1982Recorded1980–1982GenreRockLength37:02LabelColumbia JS 38279\n\nAdditional songs in the film include:\n\nThe 1982 Japanese release of the soundtrack (Polydor 28MM 0206) replaced the Tommy Tutone track with The Human League's recording of \"Love Action (I Believe in Love)\". While \"Just Once\", which featured prominently over the final scene, was not included on the soundtrack album, Ingram was nominated for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 1982 Grammy Awards.\n\nOn all DVD and Blu-ray releases, at request of the band themselves, \"Love Action\" has been omitted and replaced with a repeated use of \"Whip It\" by Devo in one scene.[25] The original MGM VHS tape has the original song intact though.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nSources\n\n[edit]\n\nTrunick, Austin (2020).
