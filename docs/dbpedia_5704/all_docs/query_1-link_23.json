        "text": "According to Gallup, the desire to have children hasn’t changed much over the years that it has polled Americans on the question: In 2023, Gallup reported that of all American adults, 90 percent “either have children, want children or wish they had children,” compared to 94 percent in 2003. Yet the birthrate has declined over that time, not just in the United States but also across the developed world. New data from Pew Research about the potential reasons for the rise in childlessness accompanies a new round of hand-wringing about how Americans don’t seem to want babies anymore.\n\nAs the demographer Jennifer Sciubba, the author of “8 Billion and Counting: How Sex, Death and Migration Shape Our World,” explained to me when I did a series about declining birthrates last year: There’s a pattern that occurs when both incomes and quality of life go up; societies move “from lots of births and lots of deaths to fewer births and longer life expectancies.” In addition, the more educated a population is, the more both men and women tend to delay becoming parents and have fewer children overall — and it’s tough to argue that more education and longer life expectancies are bad things for humanity.\n\nDespite this well-established pattern, there are conservatives who are eager to point the finger of blame at “childless cat ladies,” and not just JD Vance. In an appearance last year on Fox News, the commentator Ashley St. Clair offered this faulty take: Americans without kids “just want to pursue pleasure and drinking all night and going to Beyoncé concerts. It’s this pursuit of self-pleasure in replace of fulfillment and having a family.”\n\nThe Atlantic’s Christine Emba has another theory, that the issue holding people back from having kids is a sense of uncertainty “about the value of life and a reason for being.” She continues, “It may be that for many people, absent a clear sense of meaning, the perceived challenges of having children outweigh any subsidy the government might offer.”\n\nEmba also argues that modern mothers with large families buck this trend and “exemplify what happens when meaning is deeply internalized: Many children tend to result — and, according to these women, bring joy with them.” She suggests that today’s young people, unlike those in previous generations, may lack “an overarching framework (religious or otherwise) that might help guide people toward a ‘good’ life.”\n\nBut having read many of the diaries and letters of American mothers throughout history, my sense is that typically, women of the past weren’t having lots of children because they had a “clear sense of meaning” or primarily because children brought them joy. They were having lots of children because there was no reliable birth control, the infant mortality rate was high, the concept of marital rape didn’t really exist and “spinsters” were socially reviled. Even though many of these women had a religious framework that guided them, that didn’t always make them feel that children were an absolute blessing, or that the quality of their lives was good.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
