        "text": "Gen Z is currently the second-youngest generation, with millennials before and Generation Alpha after. Like every generation, Gen Zâs behaviors are shaped by how they grew up. Young people today have come of age in the shadow of climate doom, pandemic lockdowns, and fears of economic collapse. The first Gen Zers were born when the internet had just achieved widespread use. Theyâre called âdigital nativesââthe first generation to grow up with the internet as a part of daily life. The generation spans a wide range: the oldest Gen Zers have jobs and mortgages, while the youngest are still preteens. Globally, Gen Z is growing fast: Gen Zers will make up a quarter of the populationÂ of the AsiaâPacific region by 2025. Read on to understand what makes Gen Z tick.\n\nLearn more about our Growth, Marketing & Sales Practice.\n\nWhat is a generation?\n\nNo doubt youâre already familiar with the concept of generation within families. Your grandparents, parents, children, and childrenâs children all make up a distinct generation in relation to you. But each of them also belongs to a diffuse category of their peers, grouped together based on when they were born and what they experience during their lives. Social scientists have studied generationsâin theory and more practicallyâfor millennia. More recently, thinkers like August Comte have argued that generational change is the engine behind social change. More specifically, each generation entering into a new life stage at more or less the same time is the pulse that creates the history of a society.\n\nSpecific major-scale events can also shape the outlook of a generation and are often reflected in how theyâre named. The Lost Generation, for example, is named for the malaise and disillusionment experienced by people who lived through World War I. Later, the Greatest Generation was named for the heroic sacrifice many made during World War II. Their children, born soon after the war ended, are called baby boomers; their outlook, in turn, was colored by the Vietnam War and the social upheavals of the 1960s. More recently, millennialsâ worldviews have been shaped by the September 11 attacks and the proliferation of the internet.\n\nOf course, these are generalizations: every so-called generation comprises a multitude of unique individuals with their own opinions, values, behaviors, and plans for the future. Some social scientists even believe that the practice of studying generations can obfuscate what motivates people on an individual level. Generational theory should be understood with this caveat, and used only as a way of thinking about society, rather than the gospel truth.\n\nWhat is unique about Gen Z?\n\nWhile there are substantive differences within the cohort known as Gen Z, there are a few commonalities its members share.\n\nAs the first real digital natives, Gen Zersâspeaking generallyâare extremely online. Gen Zers are known for working, shopping, dating, and making friends online; in Asia, Gen Zers spend six or more hours per day on their phones.\n\nDigital natives often turn to the internet when looking for any kind of information, including news and reviews prior to making a purchase. They flit between sites, apps, and social media feeds, each one forming a different part of their online ecosystem. Having grown up with social media, Gen Zers curate their online selvesÂ more carefully than those in prior generations have, and they are more likely to turn to trends of anonymity, more personalized feeds, and a smaller online presence, even as they voraciously consume media online.\n\nVideo-sharing social media sites have seen a meteoric rise as Gen Z comes of age. TikTok currently rules trends, feelings, and culture for Gen Zers, who make up 60 percent of the appâs one billion-plus users. Gen Zers flock to corners of the internet where they can discuss their passions and interests with those who share themâfrom gamingÂ to K-popâbonding with both people they know in real life and ones theyâve only met online.\n\nGen Z also faces an unprecedented behavioral health crisis: US Gen Zers surveyed by McKinsey report the least positive outlook and the highest prevalence of mental illnessÂ of any generation, and European respondents report struggling with self-stigma. This pessimism is fueled by growing global unrest, wars and disruptions, financial crises, and educational interruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Feelings of âclimate anxietyâ are also widely reported: many Gen Zers report that they think about the fate of the planet on a daily basis.\n\nThey are already seeing decreased economic opportunityÂ and donât assume a social safety net will be there to catch them as pensions shrink, saving for retirement gets more difficult, and the older population grows. Already, 58 percent of Gen Zers in a recent McKinsey survey reported not having a basic social need metâthe largest percentage by far of any generation.\n\nBut Gen Zers also report a more nuanced perspective around the stigma of mental illness than other generations. European Gen Zers seem less inclined to discriminate against people with mental illness (although they do stigmatize themselves).\n\nHowever, Gen Z is also generally known for its idealismâtheyâre part of a new wave of âinclusive consumersâ and socially progressive dreamers. Generally speaking, Gen Zers believe in doing their part to help stop the intensification of climate changeÂ and to establish greater equity for all. More than any other generation, Gen Z collectively demands purpose and accountability, the creation of more opportunities for people of diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, and rigorous sustainable and green practices.\n\nLearn more about McKinseyâs Retail, Healthcare, and SustainabilityÂ Practices, and check out our Diversity and Inclusion collection.\n\nHow are Gen Zers different from millennials?\n\nThose on the cusp of Gen Z and millennialâpeople who were born shortly before the turn of the millenniumâare sometimes referred to as âZillennialsâ or âZennials.â That includes older Gen Zers whoâve been in the workforce for a few years and young millennials who identify more with Gen Z.\n\nHowever, Gen Z generally has its own formative experiences distinct from those of most millennials. Here are some ways American Gen Zers differ from their older counterparts:\n\nThey are generally more pragmatic, with both complicated idealism and worries for the future. Gen Zers dream of personal career fulfillment but expect economic struggles.\n\nThey have less positive life outlooks, with lower levels of emotional and social well-being than older generations.\n\nThey are more interested in belonging to an inclusive, supportive community.\n\nThey are more individualistic, with a stronger senseÂ of personal expression.\n\nThey are more politically and socially active, advocating for what they believe on social media.\n\nWhat are Gen Zâs values?\n\nGen Zers generally have strong values related to racial justiceÂ and sustainability. Mobilizations like the Global Climate March, led by Gen Z activist Greta Thunberg, thrive on the activism of young people.\n\nClimate change is one of the issuesÂ Gen Zers care about most. They frequently call for reform on personal, public, and global scales to prevent future catastrophe. Many Gen Zers describe themselves as environmentally conscious, and the majority of Gen Z expects to see sustainability commitmentsÂ from companies and organizations.\n\nGen Z is also living in a time marked by rapidly rising inflationÂ and financial woes. Rising student loan debtÂ also plagues many members of this generation.\n\nWhat are Gen Z fashion trends?\n\nGen Z loves expressive clothes, wants to stand out rather than fit in, and has an ever-changing styleâwhat was in a month ago might already be out today. Their trend-chasing habits are supported by fast-fashion retailers supplying accessible ways to switch it up. One Gen Z staple shop, Chinese fast-fashion giant Shein, adds 6,000 new products to its website per day. This may seem at odds with the generationâs values of sustainability, but the speed at which Gen Z trends change and their desire for unique style can sometimes overcome their eco-scruples.\n\nGen Zers also love thrifting and vintage stylesâwhich are much more in line with their calls for circular fashion. Both â90s and y2k-style clothes have seen a major comeback, including fast-fashion dupes and clothes dug out of closets and thrift stores. Fashion resale has experienced massive growthÂ thanks to Gen Z resellers and influencers, and itâs normal for a Gen Z wardrobe to be a mix of cheap fast fashion and treasured vintage pieces.\n\nLearn more about McKinseyâs Retail Practice.\n\nWhat do Gen Z shoppers want?\n\nThe internet has changed retail forever and shaped the tastes of digital natives. Hereâs how:\n\nConsumption is about access rather than ownershipâGen Zers subscribe to streaming platforms instead of buying films or music. This trend extends even to services like car shares or luxury-clothing rentals.\n\nGen Zers accept their tastes might change, and they are more likely to spend on experiences that enrich their day-to-day livesÂ than millennials, who are more likely to splurge on luxury.\n\nMembers of this generation care about ease of use: mobile pay, app-based services, and simple online transactions are important, and brands have found major success by restructuring to suit Gen Z tastes.\n\nGen Zers like brick-and-mortar stores more than millennials do but still want a great online shopping experience. Some brands have even found success through online-first launches, often supported by Gen Z consumers.\n\nAds are everywhere; Gen Zers experience brands âat every momentâ as they move through their digital and physical worlds.\n\nAnd as a generation committed to its values, Gen Z expects the same of its retailersâGen Zers often choose brands that have a strong story or purpose, as well as those committed to green practices. In one McKinsey study, 73 percent of Gen Z reported trying to purchase from companies they consider ethical, and nine out of ten believeÂ that companies have a responsibility to address environmental and social issues. However, they can tell when a brand is just paying lip service and isnât backing up diversityÂ or sustainability claims with real change.\n\nMany Gen Zers throughout Asia see the internet as the first place to goÂ when researching new products to purchase; in the United States, 40 percent of Gen Zers admit to being influenced online, often by the brands featured in the videos they watch. Members filter a lot of information, from influencers, family, and friends, to decide where and how they want to spend.\n\nFor more in-depth exploration of these topics, see McKinseyâs Generation Z collection.
