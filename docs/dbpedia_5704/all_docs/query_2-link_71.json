        "text": "The public is prohibited from harassing, harming, pursuing, wounding, killing, capturing, or collecting marine species protected by the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act. NOAA urges members of the public to observe marine animals from a safe and respectful distance, and do not approach or touch them.\n\nViewing marine animals in their natural habitat can be an exciting experience—watching a group of dolphins leaping across the water, seeing a sea turtle nesting on a beach, or encountering a colony of seals basking in the sun. Although it can be tempting to try to get close to these marine animals, it’s always best to view them from a safe and respectful distance for their safety—and yours. Learning how to interact with and observe ocean animals can help you make the right decisions when you encounter them by water, land, or air.\n\nRegulations and guidelines have been developed with specific recommendations and distances for viewing whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals, sea lions, sea turtles, and other marine animals. These guidelines and laws can vary by state and by species, so know the rules before you visit our coastal waters.\n\nThe Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act do not provide for permits or other authorizations to view or interact with wild marine mammals and sea turtles, except for specific listed purposes such as scientific research. We maintain as policy that interacting with wild marine life outside of permitted research should not be attempted and viewing marine mammals and sea turtles must be conducted in a manner that does not harass the animals. We do not support, condone, approve, or authorize activities that involve closely approaching, interacting, or attempting to interact with whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals, sea lions, and sea turtles in the wild. This includes attempting to swim with, pet, touch, or elicit a reaction from the animals.\n\nThe public is prohibited from harassing, harming, pursuing, wounding, killing, capturing, or collecting marine species protected by the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act. NOAA urges members of the public to observe marine animals from a safe and respectful distance, and do not approach or touch them.\n\nMany of the most popularly viewed animals in U.S. coastal waters are protected by the Endangered Species Act. Whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals, and sea lions are also protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act. These laws help protect marine mammals and sea turtles from harm, including having their natural behaviors interrupted by human actions.\n\nBefore spending time on or near the ocean, know the guidelines and regulations for viewing these marine protected species in their habitats. Viewing guidelines and laws vary by region, state, and species. Please be familiar with the applicable rules before you visit our coastal waters—see the More Information box.\n\nGeneral Viewing Guidelines\n\n**Do not feed, or attempt to feed, any marine mammals. It’s harmful and illegal.\n\n**Do not swim with, ride, pet, touch, or attempt to interact with marine mammals or sea turtles in the wild.\n\nWhales\n\nRemain at least 100 yards away—about the length of a football field unless other rules apply. Federal law requires vessels to remain 100 yards away from humpback whales in Hawaii and Alaska waters, 200 yards from killer whales in Washington State inland waters, and 500 yards away from North Atlantic right whales anywhere in U.S. waters.\n\nDolphins and Porpoises\n\nRemain at least 50 yards away—about 1/2 a football field. In some locations, the minimum distance may be 100 yards—know before you go.\n\nIn Hawai‘i, federal law prohibits swimming with, approaching, or remaining within 50 yards of spinner dolphins.\n\nSeals and Sea Lions\n\nFor seals and sea lions in the water, or on shore, remain at least 50 yards away—about 1/2 a football field. This includes people and pets.\n\nSea Turtles\n\nFor turtles in the water, or nesting on beaches, remain at least 50 yards away—about 1/2 a football field. This includes people and pets.\n\nIn Hawai'i the recommended viewing distance for sea turtles is at least 10 feet (3 meters) away—on land and in water.\n\nGuidelines When Viewing At Sea\n\nWhen viewing wildlife at sea, all boats, jet skis, paddleboards, kayaks, and other watercraft should maintain appropriate distances from marine mammals and sea turtles, while observing appropriate speed limits. General guidelines are provided here, but some species have rules that are specific to them (see section on species-specific laws below).\n\nWhen Viewing Marine Mammals By Watercraft\n\nRemain at least 100 yards from large whales, and 50 yards from dolphins, porpoises, seals, sea lions, and sea turtles. Federal law requires vessels to remain 100 yards away from humpback whales in Hawaii and Alaska waters, 200 yards from killer whales in Washington State inland waters, and 500 yards away from North Atlantic right whales throughout U.S. waters.\n\nLimit time spent observing individuals and groups of animals to 30 minutes or less.\n\nDo not chase, encircle, or leapfrog animals with any watercraft. Do not trap animals between watercraft or the shore.\n\nAvoid approaching marine mammals when another watercraft is near. Multiple vessels are more likely to disturb marine mammals.\n\nAvoid excessive speed or sudden changes in speed or direction near whales, dolphins, or porpoises.\n\nWhen encountering marine mammals, slow down, operate at no-wake speed. Put your engine in neutral when whales approach to pass.\n\nAvoid approaching whales, dolphins, and porpoises when calves are present. Never put your watercraft between a mother and calf.\n\nBe wary of breaching and flipper-slapping whales that might injure people or watercraft.\n\nStay clear of light green bubble patches from humpback whales. These are sub-surface bubbles before whales rise to feed at the surface.\n\nNever pursue or follow marine wildlife—any vessel movement should be from the recommended distance and slightly parallel to or from the rear of the animal. If you need to move around marine wildlife, do so from behind. Never approach head-on.\n\nDo not intentionally direct your watercraft or accelerate toward a marine mammal with the intent of creating a pressure wake allowing them to bow or wake-ride.\n\nSlowly leave the area if marine mammals show signs of disturbance.\n\nWhen Viewing Sea Turtles By Watercraft\n\nRemain at least 50 yards from sea turtles.\n\nDo not feed, or attempt to feed, any marine turtles.\n\nAvoid excessive speed or sudden changes in speed or direction near sea turtles.\n\nDo not chase, encircle, or trap sea turtles between watercraft and the shore.\n\nWhile viewing a sea turtle slow down, operate at no-wake speed. Put engines in neutral if a sea turtle is observed. Allow it to pass and move away slowly.\n\nGuidelines When Viewing From Air\n\nMaintain a 1,000-foot minimum altitude when viewing marine mammals from the air in manned aircraft (e.g., helicopters, airplanes). Federal law requires aircraft to fly no lower than 1,000 feet above humpback whales in Hawaii and 1,500 feet above North Atlantic right whales throughout U.S. waters.\n\nAvoid buzzing, hovering, landing, taking off, and taxiing near marine mammals on land or in the water. These activities are likely to harass the animals and cause stress.\n\nAvoid flying drones, or unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), near animals. The noise and close proximity of drones can harass the animals and cause stress.\n\nA note on drone/UAS guidance:\n\nNOAA Fisheries is currently developing national guidance for drone (or UAS) operations targeting marine mammals and sea turtles. Until then, NOAA Fisheries reminds the public that dolphins, whales, seals, and sea lions are protected species and harming or disturbing them can be a violation of federal law.\n\nIt is important to remember that the Federal Aviation Administration provides rules for drone operation. In addition, the U.S. National Park Service has prohibited the use of drones in many National Parks, some of which provide habitat to marine mammals.\n\nResearchers may use drones/UAS to conduct scientific research on protected species only if the proper permits and authorizations are secured. Learn more about research permitting.\n\nGuidelines When Viewing From Land\n\nRemain at least 50 yards away—about 1/2 a football field—from sea turtles nesting or resting on beaches. This includes people and pets.\n\nShare the shore! For seals and sea lions on shore, people and pets should remain at least 50 yards away—about the length of a football field. Please move away at the first sign of disturbance or agitation.\n\nIt is normal for a mother seal to leave her young pup alone on the beach for up to 24 hours while she feeds. You may not see the mother offshore, but if she sees you near her pup, she may not think it’s safe to come back and could abandon her pup.\n\nGive moms and pups space. If you see a seal pup, keep your distance. As a rule of thumb, stay at least 50 yards (150 feet) from seals. A curious seal pup might approach on its own, but the mother is likely to be nearby, and may see your interaction as a threat.\n\nNo selfies with seals! As tempting as it might be to get that perfect shot of yourself or your child with an adorable seal pup, please do the right thing and leave the seal pup alone. Getting too close to a wild animal puts you—and the animal—at risk.\n\nDo not feed, or attempt to feed, wild seals and sea lions. Seals have powerful jaws, and can leave a lasting impression. When you get too close to a wild animal, you risk stressing or threatening it, and stressed animals are much more likely to act unpredictably.\n\nSpecies-Specific Laws\n\nSome species require additional protections under the law. The following regulations are legally enforceable.\n\nKiller Whales in Puget Sound, Washington\n\nBe whale wise—remain 200 yards away (about the length of 2 football fields).\n\nBoaters and watercraft should not leapfrog killer whales. They must stay out of the forward path of whales, at any point within 400 yards.\n\nLearn more about killer whales in Puget Sound\n\nNorth Atlantic Right Whales on the U.S. Eastern Seaboard\n\nRemain 500 yards away—about 1/4 mile.\n\nAny vessel finding itself within the 500-yard buffer zone created by a surfacing right whale must depart immediately at a safe, slow speed.\n\nMaintain a 1,500-foot minimum altitude over North Atlantic right whales (applies to aircraft and drones).\n\nLearn more about North Atlantic right whales\n\nHumpback Whales in Alaska and Hawaii\n\nRemain 100 yards away—about the length of a football field.\n\nFederal regulations also restrict close approaches by air for humpback whales in Hawaii—maintain a 1,000-foot minimum altitude.\n\nLearn more about viewing humpback whales in Alaska\n\nLearn more about watching humpback whales in the Pacific Islands/Hawaii\n\nSpinner Dolphins in Hawai‘i\n\nRemain at least 50 yards (45 meters) away.\n\nFederal law prohibits swimming with, approaching, or remaining within 50 yards of spinner dolphins in Hawai‘i.\n\nLearn more about Spinner Dolphins in Hawai‘i\n\nKnow the law—learn the regulations and viewing guidelines before spending time on the ocean and along our coasts. Be aware that guidelines and laws can vary by state and by species.\n\nReport animals that appear injured or sick. If you think an animal is in trouble—if it’s entangled, stranded, sick, or injured—please report it. And, keep your distance. These animals are already vulnerable and may be more likely to bite.\n\nKeep pets away from marine life. Wild animals can injure and spread diseases to pets, and in turn, pets can harm, injure, disturb, and spread diseases to marine wildlife. If you are traveling with pets, always keep them on a leash and away from areas frequented by marine animals like seals and sea lions.\n\nReport incidents of people or pets tormenting, disturbing, or attempting to touch a marine mammal or sea turtle. Contact NOAA’s National Enforcement Hotline at (800) 853-1964.\n\nNever feed or attempt to feed marine animals—it’s illegal. Marine wildlife, like all wild animals, may bite and inflict injuries to people who try to feed them. Feeding by humans can alter animals’ natural behavior, make them dependent on handouts, and can be harmful to their health.\n\nLimit your viewing time to 30 minutes. Time spent observing an individual or group of marine mammals should be limited to 1/2 hour. And when observing animals from a boat, keep in mind that your vessel may not be the only one that approaches the same animal(s) that day. Prolonged exposure to several vessels increases the likelihood that marine mammals will be disturbed.\n\nCautiously move away from animals if you observe any of the following behaviors:\n\nRapid changes in direction or swimming speed.\n\nErratic swimming patterns.\n\nEscape tactics such as prolonged diving, underwater exhalation, underwater course changes, or rapid swimming at the surface.\n\nTail slapping or lateral tail swishing at the surface.\n\nFemale attempting to shield a calf with her body or by her movements.\n\nChuffing (loud exhalations) at surface.\n\nSeals or sea lions lunging, moving away, fleeing or trampling pups.\n\nHelp NOAA Fisheries learn more about whales by reporting whale sightings.\n\nNorth Atlantic right whales along the East Coast:\n\nFrom Maine to Virginia, call (866) 755-NOAA.\n\nFrom North Carolina to Florida, call (877) WHALE-HELP.\n\nOr, contact the U.S. Coast Guard via channel 16.\n\nSouthern Resident killer whales in Puget Sound, Washington:\n\nCall (866) 672-2638 (866-ORCANET) or (800) 562-8832.\n\nWhales in Alaska:\n\nReport via the Whale Alert iPhone/iPad app | Android app.\n\nOr, contact the U.S. Coast Guard via channel 16.\n\nLend a hand with trash removal. Garbage and marine debris is a big threat to marine animals. Carry a trash bag with you and pick up litter found along the shore and in the water. Plastic bags, floating debris, and monofilament line pose great risk to marine mammals and sea turtles."
