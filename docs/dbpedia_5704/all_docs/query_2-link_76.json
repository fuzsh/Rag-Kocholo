        "text": "Monitoring\n\nDuring rehydration, respiration and pulse rate should fall and urine start to be passed. The return of tears, a moist mouth, less sunken eyes and fontanelle, and improved skin turgor are also signs that rehydration is proceeding, but many severely malnourished children will not show these changes even when fully rehydrated. Monitor weight gain.\n\nMonitor the progress of rehydration every 30 min for 2 h, then every hour for the next 4–10 h. Be alert for signs of overhydration, which is very dangerous and may lead to heart failure. Check for:\n\nweight gain to ensure that it is not quick and excessive.\n\nincrease in respiratory rate\n\nincrease in pulse rate\n\nurine frequency (Has the child urinated since last checked?)\n\nenlarging liver size on palpation\n\nfrequency of stools and vomit.\n\nRecipe for ReSoMal using standard WHO ORS\n\nView in own window\n\nIngredientAmountWater2 litresWHO ORSOne 1-litre packetaSucrose50 gElectrolyte/mineral solutionb40 ml\n\na\n\n2.6 g sodium chloride, 2.9 g trisodium citrate dihydrate, 1.5 g potassium chloride, 13.5 g glucose\n\nb\n\nSee below for the recipe for the electrolyte/mineral solution. If you use a commercially prepared electrolyte and mineral powder, follow the manufacturer's instructions. If these cannot be made up, use 45 ml of potassium chloride solution (100 g potassium chloride in 1 litre of water) instead.\n\nReSoMal contains approximately 45 mmol sodium, 40 mmol potassium and 3 mmol magnesium per litre.\n\nFormula for concentrated electrolyte/mineral solution\n\nThis solution is used in the preparation of starter and catch-up feeding formulas and ReSoMal. Electrolyte and mineral powders are produced by some manufacturers. If these are not available or affordable, prepare the solution (2500 ml) using the following ingredients:\n\nView in own window\n\nIngredientgmol/20 mlPotassium chloride (KCl)22424 mmolTripotassium citrate812 mmolMagnesium chloride (MgCl2.6H2O)763 mmolZinc acetate (Zn acetate.2H2O)8.2300 μmolCopper sulfate (CuSO4.5H2O)1.445 μmolWater to make up to2500 ml\n\nIf available, also add selenium (0.028 g sodium selenate, NaSeO4.10H2O) and iodine (0.012 g potassium iodide, KI) per 2500 ml.\n\nDissolve the ingredients in cooled boiled water.\n\nStore the solution in sterilized bottles in a refrigerator to retard deterioration. Discard if it turns cloudy. Make up fresh each month.\n\nAdd 20 ml of the concentrated electrolyte/mineral solution to each 1000 ml of milk feed. If it is not possible to prepare this electrolyte/mineral solution and pre-mixed sachets are not available, give potassium, magnesium and zinc separately. Make a 10% stock solution of potassium chloride (100 g in 1 litre of water) and a 1.5% solution of zinc acetate (15 g in 1 litre of water).\n\nFor the oral rehydration solution ReSoMal, use 45 ml of the stock potassium chloride solution instead of 40 ml electrolyte/mineral solution\n\nFor milk feeds F-75 and F-100, add 22.5 ml of the stock potassium chloride solution instead of 20 ml of the electrolyte/mineral solution to 1000 ml of feed. Give the 1.5% zinc acetate solution by mouth at 1 ml/kg per day. Give 0.3 ml/kg of 50% magnesium sulfate intramuscularly once to a maximum of 2 ml.\n\nIf you find signs of overhydration (early signs are respiratory rate increasing by 5/min and pulse rate by 25/min), stop ReSoMal immediately and reassess after 1 h.\n\nTreatment\n\nThe essential features of initial feeding are:\n\nfrequent (every 2–3 h) oral small feeds of low osmolality and low lactose\n\nnasogastric feeding if the child is eating ≤ 80% of the amount offered at two consecutive feeds\n\ncalories at 100 kcal/kg per day\n\nprotein at 1–1.5 g/kg per day\n\nliquid at 130 ml/kg per day or 100 ml/kg per day if the child has severe oedema\n\nin addition, if the child is breastfed, encourage continued breastfeeding, but make sure the prescribed amounts of starter formula are given:\n\nView in own window\n\nDaysFrequencyVolume/kg feedVolume/kg per day1–22h11 ml130 ml3–53h16 ml130 ml≥64h22 ml130 ml\n\nThe suggested starter formula and feeding schedules given below are designed to meet these targets. Milk-based formulas, such as starter F-75 (with 75 kcal and 0.9 g protein/100 ml), will be satisfactory for most children (see recipes). As cereal-based F-75 partially replaces sugar with cereal flour, it has the advantage of lower osmolarity, which may benefit some children with persistent diarrhoea, but it has to be cooked.\n\nFeed from a cup or a bowl. Use a spoon, dropper or syringe to feed very weak children.\n\nA recommended schedule, with a gradual increase in the feed volume and a gradual decrease in feeding frequency, see . For children with a good appetite and no oedema, this schedule can be completed in 2–3 days.\n\nTable 22Volumes of F-75 per feed for malnourished children (approximately 130 ml/kg per day)\n\nView in own window\n\nChild's weight (kg)2-hourly (ml/feed)3-hourly (ml/feed)4-hourly (ml/feed)2.02030452.22535502.42540552.63045552.83045603.03550653.23555703.43555753.64060803.84060854.04565904.24570904.45070954.650751004.855801055.055801105.255851155.460901205.660901255.865951306.0651001306.2701001356.4701051406.6751101456.8751101507.0751151557.2801201607.4801201607.6851251657.8851301708.0901301758.2901351808.4901401858.6951401908.8951451959.01001452009.21001502009.41051552059.61051552109.811016021510.0110160220\n\nNote: If staff resources are limited, give priority to 2-hourly feeds for only the most seriously ill children, and aim for at least 3-hourly feeds initially. Ask mothers and other carers to help with feeding. Show them what to do, and supervise them. Night feeds are essential, and staff rosters may have to be adjusted. If, despite all efforts, not all the night feeds can be given, the feeds should be spaced equally through the night to avoid long periods without a feed (with the risk of increased hypoglycaemia and mortality).\n\nIf the child's intake (after allowing for any vomiting) does not reach 80 kcal/kg per day, despite frequent feeds, coaxing and re-offering, give the remaining feed by nasogastric tube. Do not exceed 100 kcal/kg per day in this initial phase.\n\nIn very hot climates, children might need extra water, as these foods may not contain enough water if the children are sweating."
