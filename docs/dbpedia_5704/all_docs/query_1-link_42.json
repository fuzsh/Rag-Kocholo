        "text": "One of the keys to success in filmmaking is that you never stop learning. To stand still and rest on your laurels is to stagnate and fall behind. Even the greats—the Spielbergs and Scorseses of the world—continue to adapt and grow. A large part of this continuous learning process is the simple joy of watching and studying work from other filmmakers that you look up to. But there’s another key factor that shouldn’t be overlooked here. Just like any other industry and skill set out there, filmmaking books are essential if you want to master this craft.\n\nAs American art director Paul Rand once said, “You will learn most things by looking, but reading gives understanding.” As for Spielberg? He has a great quote, too: “Only a generation of readers will spawn a generation of writers.”\n\nSo the question is, what do you read? Under the wide umbrella of filmmaking as a category, you’ll find all kinds of books on filmmaking covering various different topics from how to produce feature-length films, or specific skills such as editing and writing, to the philosophy of storytelling, behind the scenes of documentaries, and the history of cinema. From Sidney Lumet to David Mamet and Walter Murch, renowned filmmakers with decades of experience have gifted us their knowledge in revelationary, page-turning books about filmmaking. To help get you started, below, we’ve categorized 16 of the best books on filmmaking that have all been given the seal of approval from film students to teachers, independent filmmakers, acclaimed directors, and film editors.\n\nFilmmakers on Filmmaking\n\nMaking Movies, by Sidney Lumet\n\nIt’s near-impossible to summarize the whole craft of filmmaking in just one book, but Sidney Lumet—one of America’s most renowned directors in the 20th century—may well have done it. With decades of experience, Lumet delivers lessons, practical knowledge, and anecdotes about filmmaking from beginning to end.
