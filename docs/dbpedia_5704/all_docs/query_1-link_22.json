        "text": "Your childâs supervised experience will look much like YouTubeâs flagship app and website, but with adjustments to the content they can find and watch, features they can use, default account settings, and ad protections.\n\nThe videos they can watch will depend on a content setting that you select for their supervised account when granting them permission to use YouTube. Automatic reminders will appear for breaks and bedtime, which they can adjust to reinforce healthy screen time habits, and YouTubeâs autoplay feature will be off by default as well.\n\nYouTube Kids is our dedicated app built from the ground up with kids in mind, while a supervised account gives you the choice to allow your kids access to a managed version of regular YouTube.\n\nWe launched YouTube Kids in 2015 to give kids a safer, more contained environment, with three content settings (Pre-school, Younger, and Older) and parental controls to help guide their viewing experience. Content in YouTube Kids is a diverse, but smaller selection of content than regular YouTube - selected through a combination of human review, curated playlists from experts, and algorithmic filtering.\n\nLearn more at youtube.com/kids\n\nSupervised accounts on YouTube are available for children under 13 (or applicable age in your country) with a Google Account managed by Family Link. By setting up a supervised account linked to your own, and using your childâs account to sign in to YouTube, you can adjust their experience as described in the first FAQ above.\n\nLearn more to get started.\n\nAs a parent, youâve watched your child grow and have seen their interests change. Wherever these new interests lead them, YouTubeâs diverse platform of content creators offer entertainment, ideas, perspectives, and communities for them to explore. You know your child best and thatâs why we offer three content setting options for you to choose:\n\nExplore: Generally aligns with content ratings for viewers ages 9+. This will feature a range of vlogs, tutorials, gaming videos, music videos, news, educational content, DIY, arts and crafts, dance, and more. No live streams, except for Premieres.\n\nExplore more: Generally aligns with content ratings for viewers ages 13+. This setting will include a larger set of videos â including live streams â in the same categories as Explore.\n\nMost of YouTube: Includes almost everything on YouTube, excluding content marked 18+ by channels, our systems, or our reviewers.\n\nThese content settings contain a vast number of videos and are significantly larger than our separate YouTube Kids app. Our systems work hard to prevent inappropriate content, but are not perfect and will make mistakes. Some videos may be unsuitable for kids. If you prefer a more limited experience for your child, YouTube Kids may be a better option.\n\nLearn more about the content policies for each of these content settings.\n\nPeople around the world use YouTube to express their ideas and opinions freely, and we believe that a broad range of perspectives ultimately makes us a stronger and more informed society, even if we disagree with some of those views. Our Community Guidelines set out whatâs allowed and not allowed on YouTube, and also apply in a supervised experience.\n\nBy setting up a supervised account for your child, and choosing a content setting for them, this will provide additional limits on the content they can find or get recommended.\n\nWe care deeply about our users and work hard to exclude unsuitable videos, but no automated system of filters is perfect. You can change app permissions and content settings for your child at any time. If you find something you believe violates our Community Guidelines, please report it for review. This makes YouTube better for everyone.\n\nIf you decide your child is ready to explore YouTube with a supervised account, the content setting you choose for them will also apply to official albums, singles, videos, remixes, live performances and more when they sign in to YouTube Music on Android, iOS and desktop.\n\nSupervised accounts are not supported on YouTube TV.\n\nYouTube is a part of Google and adheres to Googleâs privacy policies and principles. We know itâs important for you to understand what personal information we collect in association with your childâs Google Account, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete that information. The Google Privacy Policy and our Privacy Notice for Google Accounts for children under 13 (or applicable age in your country) explain our privacy practices for your childâs account.\n\nYour child can manage and learn more about their privacy settings and controls under \"Your Data in YouTube\" in their account. This page includes a summary of their content and activity data, settings to manage this data, and information on how their data is used to improve their YouTube experience, like reminding them what theyâve watched, and giving them more relevant recommendations and search results. As the parent manager of your childâs Google Account, you can pause or clear their search and watch history from Family Link, or from your parent settings page in YouTube.\n\nYes. Limited paid advertisements make it possible for YouTube to provide an experience free of charge for families everywhere, and help support content creators to bring their creative ideas to life. To better protect children, ads in certain categories are prohibited and personalized ads are disabled. If you have a YouTube Premium family plan your child is eligible for ad-free viewing and other shared benefits of membership."
