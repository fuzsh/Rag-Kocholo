        "text": "The use of recording equipment, such as CCTV or smart door bells, to capture video or sound recordings outside the user’s property boundary is not a breach of data protection law.\n\nPeople should try to point their CCTV cameras away from their neighbours’ homes and gardens, shared spaces or public streets. But this is not always possible.\n\nWhen people capture images and audio recordings outside of their property boundary, they should consider how intrusive this activity is. They should consider whether they can point their cameras elsewhere or, if possible apply filters or privacy blocks. In these circumstances, data protection law also requires them to follow certain rules – although these are difficult to enforce.\n\nWhat can I do if I am unhappy about someone using domestic CCTV to record me?\n\nIn most cases, we would suggest you start by talking to the person doing the recording.\n\nWe suggest following these steps:\n\nWhat can I do if someone is recording my children using CCTV?\n\nIn most cases we would suggest you start by talking to the person doing the recording. The person is likely using CCTV for legitimate purposes. You should follow the steps in our guidance above about how to approach them and what to ask.\n\nIf you feel the person is filming your child inappropriately or to cause them harm, you should contact the police.\n\nWhat can I do if I have an ongoing dispute with my neighbour about their CCTV recording me?\n\nIf you have an ongoing dispute with your neighbour, we suggest you follow government guidance to resolve this. The guidance suggests that you take these steps:\n\nWhat are the rules about domestic CCTV?\n\nData protection law says that people who capture images or audio recordings from outside their property boundary using a fixed camera, such as a CCTV camera or smart doorbell, should:\n\nThese rules only apply to fixed cameras. They do not cover roaming cameras, such as drones or dashboard cameras (dashcams) as long as the drone or dashcam is used only for your domestic or household purposes.\n\nIt is difficult to enforce these rules, as it is not easy to find out if the person acts on a request to delete footage. We wouldn’t find it a fair or balanced action to go into a person’s home to find out if they were complying with the law or take other enforcement action.\n\nWhat will the ICO do if someone doesn’t follow the rules?\n\nYou can complain to us when a user of domestic CCTV doesn’t follow the rules. We can send a letter asking them to resolve things, eg put up the appropriate signage or respond to data protection requests.\n\nThere is a limited amount of action the ICO can take after this point to make the person comply. It is highly unlikely the ICO will consider it fair or balanced to take enforcement action against a domestic CCTV user.\n\nWe would always recommend you speak to the user about their use of CCTV if possible.\n\nMake a complaint\n\nCan the ICO retrieve CCTV footage from a domestic user?\n\nNo. If you ask a domestic CCTV user for copies of footage that captures your image or voice and they refuse, you can complain to us. We can write to the person and ask them to provide you with the footage. That is the extent of the action we can take.\n\nWe cannot force a person to remove their cameras. It is highly unlikely the ICO will consider it fair or balanced to take enforcement action against a domestic CCTV user.\n\nWe would always recommend you speak to the user about their use of CCTV if possible.\n\nMake a complaint\n\nCan the ICO get CCTV cameras or recording equipment removed?\n\nNo. People have the right to install CCTV cameras and smart doorbells on their property. They should try to point cameras away from neighbours’ homes and gardens, shared spaces or public streets. But this is not always possible, and it is not illegal to do so.\n\nIf you complain to us about a data protection issue about the use of domestic CCTV, and we believe a person broke the rules – we can write to them. In our letter, we may ask them to consider moving the cameras and to think about the privacy of others.\n\nThere is a limited amount of action the ICO can take after this point to make the person comply. It is highly unlikely the ICO will consider it fair or balanced to take enforcement action against a domestic CCTV user.\n\nWe would always recommend you speak to the user about their use of CCTV if possible."
