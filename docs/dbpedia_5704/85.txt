With animation, anything goes. Filmmakers are not bound by the physical laws of the Earth, so their characters can do incredible things. Actually, they're not bound by Earth at all, so animated films can take audiences to worlds that can only be imagined. And, as technology catches up to artistic ambition, animated movies are only getting easier to make, and more plentiful. Really, the sky's the limit.

So, when you're looking to throw on a movie that you can watch with kids, it makes sense to reach for something animated. But which ones? These are the 50 best animated movies to watch with your family. Some rank up there with the best kids' movies of all time, animated or not. Some are toddler-friendly movies that can appeal to the littlest viewers, while others have sophisticated jokes aimed squarely at tweens and teens (and maybe even adults). Some are stop-motion, making use of a painstaking medium, some are hand-drawn and others make use of the most up-to-date technology. All of them offer a world of bright colors, cool designs and stories that are super entertaining. (What you won't find: Animated movies for that are really more adult-only fare, like Waltz With Bashir or A Scanner Darkly.)
