But a nod to an insane performance by Peter Boyle and a cranked to eleven Sally Field.\n\nTwo packs of salvagers looting the capsized ship, come across a pocket of survivors. Surprise! Everyone walking around like the ceiling is a floor without a care in the world. (One scene near the end, showing a room flooding, is right side up. Surprise!).\n\n‚ÄúMy dress! I don‚Äôt think I can make it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúTake it off.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBeg your pardon?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúTAKE IT OFF!!!‚Äù\n\nüëç\n\nPart of the toxic thrill in watching these old Irwin Allen flicks is getting to see accomplished actors left utterly high and dry like dead fish flopping for air. But of course that air never comes and you are left suffocating with them. With this sequel to The Poseidon Adventure, which is a legitimately great piece of schlock entertainment, you get a who's who of faces. Michael Caine, Karl Malden, Sally Field, Telly Savalas, Peter Boyle, Jack Warden and Slim Motherfuckin' Pickens. And they are all left to fend for themselves, sometimes excruciatingly, sometimes hilariously, sometimes at the same time.\n\nThere are shots where they'll cut to one set of actors standing and watching a dialogue between another set of‚Ä¶\n\nWho in the world greenlit this piece of crap. I will ignore the most obvious flaw in the movie for starters. The only thing that is even remotely good about this is the cast, but really that is the only thing even close to making it worth watching. It had been more than 20 years since I saw it last so I thought I'd give it a try. No change in my opinion. It has all the charm of a 1970's TV celebrity fundraiser special.\n\nThere's a scene early on, once they're inside the ship, that had me genuinely hopeful for this. It's something so simple. They have to jump a hole in the floor (or ceiling, I guess) to get from one end of the hall to the other. It's not a gigantic leap, but big enough to make one a little nervous. It's the kind of setup that you can go, \"Oh, I wonder how I'd jump that and how nervous I'd be.\" It's seems simple yet we can understand, even feel, at least I felt, the trepidation.\n\nThere's nothing like that anywhere else in the movie. But there are shootouts (?) and plutonium (??).\n\nApparently there is a morning after in Beyond the Poseidon Adventure.\n\nIt's New Year's Day and all known survivors of The Poseidon Adventure have been rescued. Two dueling teams of makeshift pirates/mercenaries plunge into the wreckage of Poseidon to plunder and pillage whatever they can salvage. Can they make it in and out before Poseidon reaches its final resting place at the bottom of the sea? Will someone scrap that Christmas tree for parts? Has Sally Field ever been more annoying? These questions and more may or may not be answered in Beyond the Poseidon Adventure.\n\nA shameless, desperate cash grab coming seven years after the original film's successful release, Beyond the Poseidon Adventure is every bit as dumb as‚Ä¶"
