        "text": "28-410 trigger sprayer Poseidon consumer sprayer with spray only\n\nThe 28-410 trigger sprayer Poseidon has 1.2ml output and a spray only as spray type. The colour for the trigger sprayer is normally white or natural, but our trigger sprayer can be made in any colour.

Sometimes also with a child resistant closure, or it can be used upside down.\n\nThere are 2 functions of the trigger pump: direct compression and pre-compression. 1. Direct compression: The liquid goes directly from the dip tube inside the cylinder and, by squeezing the handle travels via the nozzle base through the nozzle itself. This function is common for most simple liquids like surface cleaners, de-icers, and many more.\n\n2. Pre-compression: The benefit of this type of function is that it gives the trigger a full spray without liquid fall off, or any large droplets of the liquid forming, because of a special valve inserted in the chamber of the trigger.\n\nThe consumer triggers sprayers are available in standard neck sizes such as 28-400, 28-410, 28mm lock, RD28/DIN28 andPCO-BPF.\n\n28-410 trigger sprayers Poseidon for multiple markets combinations\n\nFrapak has standard colours available like all white, all black, red/white, green/white and blue white.
