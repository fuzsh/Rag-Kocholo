        "text": "The water that splashes up from the toilet when our poops drops into the water.\n\nYou have to be careful while defecating because poseidon's kiss can make your clothes dirty, and you'll not be able to offer prayers in these dirty clothes.\n\nIt's necessary ruling in Islam, that clothes should be clean. In dirty clothes, prayers aren't acceptable.\n\nContext: self-made\n\nIs the phrase \"Poseidon's Kiss\" used in English?\n\nNo, and since Poseidon is best remembered as the god of the sea, rather than the god of water, it does not really seem appropriate. Furthermore, it seems bizarre to refer to a pagan god in a passage about Islam, particularly if it is aimed at Muslims.\n\nIn BritE, no, I have never heard or read it.\n\nNor I in AE. Where did you find the definition, or did it spring from your brow?\n\nI found the definition on the internet.\n\nThat's about as helpful as saying you found it in a library but can't remember in which book, or even on what floor.\n\nWas it perhaps in urbandictionary?\n\nNo, and since Poseidon is best remembered as the god of the sea, rather than the god of water, it does not really seem appropriate. Furthermore, it seems bizarre to refer to a pagan god in a passage about Islam, particularly if it is aimed at Muslims.\n\nI dare say it is naval slang. After all, at sea, they don't waste good drinking water for this purpose. It is almost always brine that has been pumped from below.\n\nIt could be recent. It is defined here (2012) Urban Dictionary: Poseidon's Kiss\n\nNever heard it. Remember that anyone can post anything on Urban Dictionary. It could be a hoax, it could be a term used by 2 high school kids, it could be a coinage from a comic book, a film, a fantasy or young adult novel.\n\nI've never heard this one. And it's too arcane to sound like real current American slang. It's bizarre to use it in a passage about Muslim customs because it comes from such a different culture (ancient Greek pagan mythology filtered through the Christian Renaissance and classical studies).\n\nAlso it isn't really true of American plumbing. Your buttocks might get splashed but rarely your clothes.\n\nI found the definition on the internet.\n\nAs well as Urban Dictionary, it's also found on Reddit, Quora, and now, of course, this thread.\n\nI've never heard or seen anyone use it in real life.\n\nI'm sorry for not telling you clearly where exactly I found it.\n\nI found it on a Facebook page, named \"It's Not Rocket Science\". Here's the image posted by that page:\n\nI asked it here to know whether the phrase really exists in English."
