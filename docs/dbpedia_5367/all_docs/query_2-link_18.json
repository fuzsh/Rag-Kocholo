It's New Year's Eve and the party is in full swing aboard a luxury cruise ship in the North Atlantic. Suddenly, a massive wave strikes the liner, pitching the ship to port then rolling it completely upside down--and starting a desperate fight to survive, to escape the capsized and sinking Poseidon. Passengers and crew are thrown into free fall, crushed by debris or dragged into the sea as water bursts in through shattered windows. Supports collapse, broken gas lines ignite flash fires and lights fail, leaving vast sections of the ship in darkness and chaos. In the aftermath, a few hundred survivors are left to huddle in the still-intact main ballroom, now resting below the waterline. They should stay together, the captain says, and wait here for rescue. But one man, professional gambler Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas--Glory Road), chooses to test the odds alone.",

[Full Review in Spanish]\n\nFebruary 12, 2020\n\nNot one who believes in updates, remakes, re-dos or reinventions, I can honestly say this is one \"remake\" that surpasses the original in every way. (Okay, Gene Hackman would have been the only other plus.)\n\nNovember 14, 2019\n\nThe new Poseidon is an e-ticket Disney World ride with Fastpass. Ten minutes in, the wave hits, you're underwater, gasping for breath and fighting for your life.\n\nJune 25, 2017\n\nIf you liked the original movie, you might like this remake as well.\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nIt's a carnival ride, with shocks, endless stunts, and when you're done, you've forgotten it and moved on to something better.\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\nA handful of the passengers may eventually get out of the ship alive, but nothing, it seems, can save them from Mark Protosevich's sinking script. At least it looks good as it goes down.\n\nJune 21, 2017"
