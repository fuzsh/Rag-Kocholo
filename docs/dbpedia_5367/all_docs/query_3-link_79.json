        "text": "Great reg. I have dove it in cold, very cold and freakin freezeing water. It breathes like a dream. And since you used to have one you know what I am talking about. As far as improvements go, the HP seat is a steel ball, so needless to say it doesn't ever fail. And the second stage is very light in weight and the purge is hidden in behind so it is literally impossible to get hit by anything. The design that does not require the use of an enviromental kit worked very well under the ice. I have a feeling that you aren't too concerned with that though. Great reg. I would own one if it weren't for the cost. But I can say that it will likely replace one of my apeks on the next purchase. As far as disadvantages of the side exhaust I cannot think of any. The only thing that I have heard of is that people find their SAC rate goes up a little becuase of the servo-assisted valve. I enjoyed it very much. As long as you can get it serviced and don't mind the tag. I have a feeling you won't as you are only the second guy thatIknow of that will use it on their stage bottle. I would recommend the straight version if you can. The 90 is a little obtrusive..\n\nthank you so much for the feed back - for a moment I thought no one was going to reply.\n\nI'm a little unclear about some things:\n\nrescuediver009:\n\nGreat reg.

That type of a sharp turn could create quite a bit of heat from the turbulent gas flow. Poseidon's testing indicated that the straight version is more suitable for pure oxygen. I believe that this is a bit overly conservative, but that was their official decision.\n\nGreg Barlow\n\nFormer Science Editor for Rodale's Scuba Diving Magazine\n\nVie:\n\nthank you so much for the feed back - for a moment I thought no one was going to reply.\n\nNope, I think that only happens to me (if you look up all the threads I have started)\n\nVie:\n\nThe Xstream Deco comes with a straight 1st stage as standard - is it possible to get it with the 90?

If you are only going to be using a 50% mix you are ok. Yes it can be cleaned to be compatible to 100% O2. Otherwise you can get the Duration that is oxygen white and only coms in the straight version. If you want the exacts, go to http://www.poseidon.se/bild.dip?id=366\n\nVie:\n\nI am hoping for some opinions on the Poseidon Xstream. Has anyone had any experiences with this series of reg? I'm looking at the Xstream Deco to use with O2 during my last stop above 6 msw. I like the side exhaust design (no \"upsidedown\" breathing stutter ) and durable design of the Poseidon but have not used a side exhaust 2nd stage or a Poseidon reg before. Also would like to know advantages/disadvantages of side exhaust versus regular 2nd stage.\n\nI've had one for about 2 years. I have the deep version. When I first got it it breathed great. I used it on some cave diving last Feb. and after a few days of cave diving, there was a reddish-brown residue in the 2nd stage. I cleaned it out, it predive breathed fine, started the next cave, and the thing free-flowed. Shutting down the reg, I returned to the surface, and couldn't get the thing to stop the freeflow. Switched regs and completed the dive.\n\nI have yet to take the thing to have it checked out (I want to be there when it's torn apart, and the nearest dealer is 2 hrs away). The first impression that I got was that the brown stuff was rust. Luckly I have several Apex's and ScubaPro's for stage tanks when I need them. At this point, I'm reserving my thoughts on them.\n\nLater,\n\nDC"
