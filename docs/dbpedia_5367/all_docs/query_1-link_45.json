        "text": "It seems both appropriate and ironic that Poseidon is released on DVD the same week that Snakes on a Plane finally arrives in theaters. After all, both of these films are tongue-in-cheek thrillers at best, and exist to provide moviegoers with the sense that they are indeed much smarter than their chosen entertainment. But the difference between the two is that SOAP at least acknowledges its b-grade impulses, and celebrates them; Poseidon sadly attempts, or at least pretends, to be a real, legitimate disaster epic - which may account for its poor showing in May when it was released in theaters.\n\nI don't pay for a lot of movies any more, thanks to the preponderance of advance screenings and all-around critic perks that studios offer in Los Angeles. But Poseidon was a movie I was desperate to see, and despite all outward warnings I did actually spend some cash to watch it in a theater - just not a crowded one (that's what weekly matinees are for). On DVD, some of its charms are missing, or maybe its flaws are more evident; but suffice it to say if one's expectations are properly lowered, the film can nevertheless be a pretty engaging (if not remotely intelligent) excursion into disaster-movie 'magic'.\n\nAt 98 minutes, there's barely enough time for characters at all, much less character development: Josh Lucas (Glory Road) plays Dylan Johns, a naval officer (?)-turned-professional gambler; Kurt Russell (Miracle) is a former New York mayor, currently presiding over his rebellious daughter Jennifer (Emmy Rossum) and her boyfriend Christian (Mike Vogel); Jacinda Barrett (Ladder 49) plays Maggie James, a single mother who embarks on a New Year's Eve cruise with her 8-year-old son, one presumes, to woo wannabe dads; and Richard Dreyfus (Mr. Holland's Opus) plays Richard Nelson, an architect drinking away the pain after his boyfriend dumps him.\n\nIt's a quick 15 minutes before the ship capsizes with the help of a 'rogue wave', at which point Industrial Light & Magic takes over, providing desensitized audiences with the awe-inspiring sight of hundreds if not thousands of casualties. The funniest part of this is the moment the first mate uses his binoculars in order to properly see the wave - which reaches so high in the sky he actually has to look up to see the crest. From there on out, the names highest on the call sheet are subjected to a seemingly neverending series of tight squeezes and near-misses, propagating the kinds of opportunities for heroism and redemption that occur only in the span of 98-minute summer blockbusters.\n\nIf all of this sounds a bit preposterous, it's because it is - and gloriously so; the fact that the ship's galley doesn't bother to bolt down the refrigerators or stainless steel prep tables is enough to send one's sense of logic to the very bottom of the ocean. But much like, say, a movie about a gangster who releases thousands of snakes on a transcontinental plane, certain, uh, leaps must be required to properly enjoy the adventure. Otherwise, Jacinda Barrett is just the worst mom in the history of mothers, instead of a woman who is 'too preoccupied' with her own self-preservation to notice that her child disappears at regular intervals to endanger himself and the rest of the group in turn.\n\nOf course, each of the leads has his or her own cross to bear; Lucas' Dylan insists that he works better on his own, for example, but finds the charms of his companions too irresistible to deny, especially once he is challenged with the responsibility of leading this group of ragtag survivors. But the fact that most of these stories never get fulfilled becomes a source of minor irritation - especially on DVD, where such superfluous material often flourishes. Dreyfus' characters, for example, laments not getting a call from his beloved first mate immediately prior to the rogue wave's arrival, and throws his phone into the drink. How much better would it have been to see him not only survive the accident, but escape unharmed and then recover his phone with that selfsame message accessible on it? If audiences thrive on happy endings, there were at least one or two here that went plain unexploited, and the movie is less effective for them.\n\nIronically, of course, the movie might have been better if the proceedings were taken seriously - by the screenwriter, first of all - and rendered in tones that emulated some sense of concern or care for the thousands of dead seafarers. But who really wants that from a movie? Real life is full of sad and serious and tragic events, so why not allow our heroes to evade death and live on for their fallen shipmates?\n\nPoseidon is not a good movie. It's not even a good 'bad' movie. It's a great bad movie. Not because it fails on all levels as an exercise in logic and problem-solving. Not because it's spectacularly irresponsible and insensitive (my favorite part: the woman in the evening gown who falls unceremoniously out of an elevator face first onto a glass ceiling). And not because it one-ups the silliness and implausibility of even the silly, implausible movie that inspired it. Rather, it's because no matter how intelligent you are, you are absolutely guaranteed to be smarter than it - and best of all, because nobody involved had any idea just how dumb it was while they were making it.\n\nScore: 8 out of 10\n\nThe Video\n\nPoseidon is presented in anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) preserving the aspect ratio of the (briefly) theatrical exhibition. In both sound and video quality, this disc promises to be reference material: John Seale's gorgeous cinematography is beautifully preserved, maintaining great contrasts during the opening 'calm' scenes, and then equally strong dark-light juxtapositions as fires, sparks, flashlights and other very specific light sources take over duties illuminating the film. Focus is very sharp and clarity, particularly during the effects-heavy sequences, is magnificent.\n\nScore: 9 out of 10\n\nThe Audio\n\nLike almost all first-run Warner DVDs, three audio options are available for home-theater exhibition of Poseidon: English Dolby Digital 5.1, French Dolby Digital 5.1 and Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1. Much like the transfer, these set-ups more than satisfy the multi-channel sound one expects with a bombastic action-adventure film: Klaus Badelt's score circulates in all of the channels, providing the mournful or redemptive tones that underscore plot developments, while dialogue is focused largely in the center channel. Sound effects, including that of the growling, beastlike rogue wave (a foley artist's wet dream, to be sure), are properly positioned in the satellite channels, offering plenty of action in the rear speakers, while incidental effects are emphasized just enough to create a believable (for this film, anyway) universe where 300-foot rogue waves can destroy ocean liners.\n\nEnglish, French and Spanish subtitles are available for hearing-impaired and multilingual audiences.\n\nScore: 9 out of 10\n\nExtras and Packaging\n\nPoseidon comes in a standard Amaray case with a paper insert featuring a plot synopsis, a list of bonus materials and technical information about the disc. Unfortunately, the forthcoming two-disc Special Edition was unavailable at press time, so IGN is reviewing the one-disc set, which features the following extras:\n\nFeaturette: \"Poseidon: A Ship On A Soundstage\"\n\nTheatrical trailer\n\nThe featurette was somewhat obviously produced during the making of the movie, if only because the participants are almost relentlessly gung-ho about its legacy; words like 'benchmark' are thrown around liberally, proving that no matter how good things feel while you're filming they may turn out poorly in the end. That said, the featurette does explore much of the production detail that audiences would be interested in, including how and where the producers assembled the ship, how the actors performed their stunts (much less acting), and how director Wolfgang Petersen mounted such an outwardly ambitious project.\n\nUnfortunately (again), a lot of the language used to explore the creative process is imminently familiar to just about anyone who has ever watched a featurette or filmmaking documentary: in one instance, the effects team describes the opening shot, which merges live-action photography of Lucas with the CGI ship, as groundbreaking, never-before-accomplished stuff; in another, a member of the production team calls the water \"another character in the film.\"\n\nWhile I admit completely to my familiarity with (and cynicism of) the lexicon of behind-the-scenes filmmaking, this kind of attention really tests even the most casual DVD viewer's patience - unless of course someone could actually qualify precisely how this film's use of CGI is any different than Star Wars or Lord of the Rings or any of a hundred effects-heavy movies. All of which means it's certainly possible to say statements like this and mean them, but the filmmakers fail to properly clarify their sweeping generalizations.\n\nScore: 3 out of 10"
