He was feared by ancient Greeks as the provoker of earthquakes and worshipped as the creator of horses. The name Poseidon means either “Husband of the Earth” or “Lord of the Earth.” Plato also said that it meant “knower of many things.”\n\nHe was one of five children of the Greek gods Cronus and Rhea (Titaness, Mother of the Gods). Zeus and Hades were his brothers, and Hestia, Demeter and Hera were his sisters.\n\nSee the fact file below for more information on Poseidon or alternatively, you can download our 25-page Poseidon worksheet pack to utilise within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nTraits\n\nPoseidon was one of the greediest Greek gods. He was known to be violent and hot-blooded, and vengeful when insulted. He could be kind at times, which was when the sea was calm. His mood was a reflection of the state of his realm.\n\nPoseidon had green eyes, a grey beard and wavy hair that was brown. He was also seen as being physically fit, befitting the tile of a god.\n\nSymbols\n\nPoseidon had a three-pointed trident in his hand, which was his most recognizable emblem. The trident symbolized Poseidon’s power. He could strike the ground with his trident to produce an earthquake and this earned him the nickname “Earth-shaker.” He was thought to be the cause of such disasters whenever he was enraged.\n\nAccording to the Greek poet Hesiod, Poseidon’s trident was crafted by the three Cyclopes.\n\nThe bull, fish, horse and dolphin were his sacred animals and symbols. Poseidon himself fathered many horses, the best-known being the winged horse Pegasus by the Gorgon, Medusa.\n\nPoseidon often rode his chariot with a Hippocampus, a Greek creature combining two of Poseidon’s greatest animals – the horse and fish.\n\nThe famous Trevi Fountain in Rome has a sculpture of a winged Hippocampus alongside Poseidon.\n\nThe ancient Greeks also called him the “Savior of Sailors”. It stands to reason that, because of his influence on the waters, he was associated with navigation.\n\nIn Greek mythology, the palace of Poseidon was in the depths of the sea near Aegae in Euboea. It was located on the seafloor and made of gems and coral. He was at Mount Olympus more often than his palace.\n\nCronus was the Titan of time and the ages, as well as the father of the Olympian Gods.\n\nIn myths, after Poseidon’s birth, he was swallowed whole by Cronus, just like his brothers and sisters, so that no one would be powerful enough to take the Cronus’ throne. Cronus threw them up, however.\n\nAccording to folklore, Rhea managed to hide Poseidon from his father’s rage by concealing him in a flock of lambs. Rhea pretended to have given birth to a young horse, which was devoured by Cronus instead.\n\nPoseidon was raised by the Telchines on the island of Rhodes and, when Zeus and Poseidon were powerful enough, they destroyed Cronus and saved their brothers and sisters.\n\nWhen their father was defeated, the kingdom was divided into thirds: Zeus got the sky, Hades the underworld, and Poseidon the sea.\n\nWhile according to others, the three brothers played a game of dice to decide who would get which part.\n\nConflicts with Other Gods\n\nPoseidon and Zeus\n\nPoseidon came into conflict with a variety of gods. Poseidon had a very impulsive character and he couldn’t put up with Zeus’ intimidation and arrogant behavior. Poseidon conspired with Hera and Athena to teach him a lesson but with the help of Thetis and Briareus, Zeus overpowered his challengers.\n\nPoseidon and Laomedon\n\nPoseidon and Apollo served the Trojan king, Laomedon, for whom they had built the walls surrounding Troy. However, Laomedon refused to pay Poseidon. For this reason, Poseidon hated the Trojans and sent a sea monster to torment them.\n\nPoseidon took an active role in the war against Troy and sided with the Greeks, while Zeus favored the Trojans. Poseidon caused the earth to tremble.\n\nPoseidon and Odysseus\n\nIn the Odyssey, Poseidon had a decade-long feud with one of the greatest Greek heroes, Odysseus, whom he prevents from returning home as a consequence of having blinded Polyphemus, a son of Poseidon, by the nymph Thoosa.\n\nPoseidon and Athena\n\nPoseidon and Athena competed for possession of the city of Athens. The gods decided that whoever created the most useful object would win the right to have the city named after them. To sway the people in his favor, Poseidon made it spring at the Acropolis. According to others, he created the horse. Athena, on the other hand, gave them the olive tree. With it, she won the contest.\n\nCecrops, the first king of Athens, decided that Athena’s gift was more useful since it gave fruit, wood and oil. Ever since then, the olive branch is a universal symbol of peace.\n\nPoseidon’s Women and Children\n\nPoseidon married the marine goddess, Amphitrite, a Nereid. Their son was the fish-tailed god, Triton. Amphitrite bore Poseidon another two children, namely Rhode and Benthesikyme.\n\nPoseidon had many affairs in his life. He and Medusa conceived Pegasus, one of many mythological creatures.\n\nPoseidon also deceived Demeter and transformed himself into a stallion. Afterward, Demeter gave birth to the nymph Despoena and the talking horse Arion. He was also the biological father of Orion, Polyphemus, Pelias and many others. The list goes on and includes hundreds of consorts and at least as many children.\n\nPoseidon Worksheets\n\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything you need to know about Poseidon across 25 in-depth pages.
