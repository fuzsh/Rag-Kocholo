        "text": "Poseidon: A film of 2016\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\nTo be honest, while I am watching the movie Poseidon, I was so scared that they will not going to survive on the sinking of the ship. Whereas, I was also nervous that they will be one of the thousands who died because of the great wave that they had encountered in their shipyard. For me, I think that the objective of this movie is to show us that whatever happens, if we want to live, we will do all we can do in order to survive. We should not surrender in just small problems but rather fight with the big one. There are lots of reason to live. If it’s not your time, it’s not your time yet. Moreover, as I’ve witness on the movie, there was a father-daughter scene and also a mother-son scene. The father and daughter scene demonstrate how the father sacrificed his life for the sake of the happiness of his daughter. Whilst, the mother and son illustrate how a mother really love his son that she will do anything and everything just to make sure that his son is breathing. Every one of us knows how our parents care for us though we also know that there were parents who were neglecting their own child. But as far as I know, there is lots of parents who really do care to their siblings than those who are not. So, I therefore conclude that there were few scenes where we can see how the movie indicate the objectives of this film.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIt was New Year's Eve, and over 2,000 passengers & crew are ringing in the New Year aboard the luxury ocean cruise ship 'Poseidon' when it capsizes on the open sea in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean after being swamped by rouge wave. A small group of survivors found themselves unlikely allies in a battle for their lives. Preferring to test the odds alone, career gambler Dylan Johns ignored captain's orders to wait below for possible rescue and sets out to find his own way to safety. What begins as a solo mission soon draws others, as Dylan is followed by a desperate father searching for his daughter and her fiancée -- a young couple who hours before couldn't summon the courage to tell him they were engaged and now face much graver challenges. Along the way they are\n\njoined by a single mother and her wise-beyond-his-years son, an anxious stowaway and a despondent fellow passenger who boarded the ship not sure he wanted to live but now knows he doesn't want to die. Determined to fight their way to the surface, the group sets off through the disorienting maze of twisted steel in the upside-down wreckage. As the unstable vessel rapidly fills with water each must draw on skills and strengths they didn't even know they possessed, fighting against time for their own survival and for each other. At the end, they were all safe and secure except Elena, the girl who wanted to see her brother and the father who sacrificed his life soon before the huge ship sank.\n\nReflection\n\nThe film ‘Poseidon’ represents a disaster wherein there were many lives lost and only few people were able to get survive the huge disaster. This instance can be related to different phenomena happened in our world. The disaster I was talking about in the movie was the sinking of the ship that happened because of the rogue wave. In our world today, it is obvious that we are no longer paying too much in our mother nature. And this situation causes different phenomena or disasters that affect not only the things that made us a human but also the lives of people. In the film, they were not able recognized the coming of the huge wave though there were no instance that there is a clue of what will happen on the next scene. In reality, we, people were not aware of the things that will happen eventually in our life -- the coming of the disasters – typhoon, landslide, earthquake, tsunami, volcanic eruption, and many more. We are so much focus of spending our lives on things that can make us happy and contented. However, we are supposedly have the rights to know every single details in our surroundings in order for us to be safe and secure in all aspects of our life. This includes the approaching and imminent of the disasters stated above. In this practice, we are able to survive and we can say to ourselves that we can do everything and anything for the sake of the life that the Almighty gave us."
