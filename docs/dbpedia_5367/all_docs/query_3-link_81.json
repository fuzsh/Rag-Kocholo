        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nThe Greek sea god, Poseidon (Latin: Neptune), closely resembles his Phoenician peer, Yamm, and other Middle Eastern gods of chaos. The typically encountered aniconic form in Glyptic art, his trident, and his animal alter ego are reminiscent of attributes of the Levantine sea god. The chance likewise that such a wild and stormy stream as the Aare should be chosen by the Helvetii, a Celtic confederation, as a landmark between their own territory and that of the Xuetii, cannot be read without wonder. Poseidon was seen as the god of the Helvetians. It is hard priestly work to make this minimal two-day festival, one on this side and the other on that side, popular. But as the Rhine was full to the very brim, did the festival ever actually take place or was it repeatedly postponed? To the Rhine at Basel, a wide river blending with the much deeper Aare, is there also added the old Helvetian river which does not approach the new confluence, but tirelessly bobs up and down, south of the city loop, three hundred Roman paces to the southeast? Earlier, even if only modestly, the Celts erected a lighthouse for the river god, for the god was surrounded by a housing settlement. Now beneath the hill where the original river god was, the Helvetians are resettling their city, which appears to be one of the more fortunate, and they are fortifying a part of their emigrant community. But why was religion before the family of Romulus from the beginning so ungrateful to the hero, the man who founded Rome?\n\n2. Physical Traits of Poseidon\n\nPoseidon is represented in a great variety of forms. As a full-grown man, he is often both bearded and powerful in appearance, while as a young man he is beardless. He generally keeps robust and energetic in appearance both as a youth and as an old man, although sometimes his features are represented as not being very perfect. With a man's chest, he often appears, most especially when he is depicted with horse-shaped forequarters. When he is represented with fish-tails, he is often made to have long and, sometimes, bearded faces. He often has long hair, and occasionally the marble lids are placid and tense. Poseidon holds his trident, his attribute, either in his right or his left hand, as is fitting. With his trident, he pierces the sea beasts, or he assails his fellow gods and men. When young, he is always standing, some variety of gigantomachy generally accompany him - combats with gigantic or enormous wild creatures. In the famous metope of the Parthenon, he appears standing between two trees, facing it in a battle. He has just wounded a centaur in the grove with his trident, and is about to strike another with his left hand. For an older and bearded figure, he appears at the sides of Zeus and Hera on the throne of Zeus in the temple at Olympia. In this series, he is enthroned, while both the other deities are seated on chairs. When seated, his side view often makes him look more cartoonesque. But, when he is fighting Heracles for the obedience of the audience, he appears on the thirty-north ambiance of the temple with his trident, preparing to shoot against the giant.\n\n3. 1.1 Physical Appearance\n\nWhen artists depicted Poseidon, they normally used images of his attributes (the trident, dolphins, etc.) to identify him. This is because the ancient Greeks associated animals and symbolic objects with their gods rather than giving the gods personal qualities (celestial or human), which they did to the Olympians, especially to Zeus. The main features of Poseidon's physical appearance are hair, beard, expression, posture, and age, which are dealt with in detail, as are the aspects of nudity and dress, the Hesive account of Poseidon's scar, and the non-Olympian sources (mainly Homeric Hymn to Poseidon) for the god's appearance. The epics show that Poseidon was usually depicted as being between the prime of life and maturity, giving an impression of youthfulness but also maturity, which is connected with his virility, strength, and passion. The artist-specification sources normally emphasize Poseidon's general body beauty and the care Poseidon takes of his own appearance (Aegaeus is youthful and beautiful). His general physical features as a sea god in non-Olympian sources are usually consistent with artistic representations of sea gods on vases and other objects of art. They depict robust, long-haired male sea deities with webbed feet and often a tail, holding marine attributes such as fishes, shellfish, sponges, starfish, and sea urchins, octopus or cuttlefish, sometimes crabs, seaweed, or corals.\n\n3.1. 1.1.1 Hair and Beard\n\nPoseidon is shown with a full body of flowing hair, a long beard, and often in the nude. Some types of pieces that focus on Poseidon often depict him holding a trident. As seen above, a large example of a stone sculpture made of Poseidon holding a trident, drawn in red chalk, shows a later time for Poseidon in a work on parchment or paper. Many of the depictions then evolve into sexual pieces, often not of the god of the sea, but of ancient Greek sexuality and desire. The nudity of the god would pay homage to some of the athletic activities that took place at the sea, but his nudity in pieces is utilized more as an instrument of desire, and not as the god that is represented as divine. All of the many depictions of Poseidon usually contain his hair. If there are none at all, his beard is always present. The usual depictions allow for Poseidon to possess flowing lush hair, as our paintings have shown, or a scraggly and very wild beard, as shown in sculptures from the Met collection. Due to the many different traits of the same god that are visible, it provided many different ideas and visual material for future artists and followers alike.\n\n3.2. 1.1.2 Eyes\n\nPoseidon’s epithet \"Boruta\", was rejected by Segre.

This concept was expressed in artistic works from the 8th century onward, not only through the theme of his encounters with other ancient mythological characters, but also through the representation of his exclusively maritime accoutrements. Head (1992) states that Poseidon was frequently depicted as an elderly man, with a thick beard and well-developed musculature, looking sometimes stern and at other times serene, with wind-blown hair or a full head of hair often held back by a band. This appearance leads us to conclude that it creates the effect of a face that is noble, wise, and at the same time, jealous and severe. Poseidon's expressions were often those of anger and wrath. This is why the adjective 'εννοημος' (angry) is connected with him (Iliad, 8.387). In the Iliad, when Hera is negotiating with Poseidon from a distance, she nails her gaze upon him and can see he is angry from his eyes. Aeschines reports that the statue of Poseidon on the Acropolis, near the Olympian Temple, had an aspect so extraordinarily terrible that no person in their right mind would ever have undertaken to pray to it. The figure of Poseidon created by Peisistratus looked so fierce to everyone that no one dared to complain about the quality of the work. Then Callias, son of Hipponicus, a young and brave man with a strong sense of justice, dared to express his disapproval. This shows, as earlier scholars note, that the demeanor and countenance of a god are both important in order to create the proper religious context. His powerful musculature further emphasizes his overwhelming strength. The beard played an important role, as it is an age sign, emphasizing enough honor and increasing authority.\n\n4. 1.2 Attributes and Symbols\n\nThe most common attribute of Poseidon's image is the three-pointed fisherman's trident. This was the weapon he used to secure the release of the thunderbolt from Zeus during the war of Gods and Titans. Some researchers also attribute him with the symbol of a ship's ram. Poseidon was the only one of the three deities that Odysseus refused to pay due respect to. Odysseus, who had been enslaved by Calypso in Ogygia for many years, received assistance sent by Zeus. He was asked to respect all the deities and displayed his first honest and simple feature by asking for protection and invoking the deities, the winds, and the waves. He asked the sea for a ship to get home and, as promised, offered the necessary sacrifices to other deities, excluding Poseidon, in order to avoid paying the fare for the ride. He wished to reach home in a relaxed but difficult way. The angry god Poseidon realized Odysseus's trick and sent storms to the sea instead of calming the wind, making it difficult for him to return home. Poseidon is usually accompanied by dolphins and horses. The association with the horse possibly comes from the Old Minoan rode race and the worship of Poseidon in various areas with such contests. However, the connection established in Mediterranean-type comparative religions, based on some initiation rites of gods, presents the horse as a symbol of the sea. The sea resembles a horse in the noise made by the ebb currents flowing, and the desire of the sea to be tamed is also supported by different research. The dolphin is another curious creature associated with Poseidon. It is the creature that swims alongside ships and is often named Dionysos. The dolphin, with its art-like dorsal fin, hampers the currents like a net and prevents the waves from curving. It restricts the field of methonalus curving the sea and creates a calmer environment. The story of the hero who made this species mythological is the fact that the hero saved the lineage of a young son who was abandoned by his parents, the emperor Amginetuand and the queen Verpirgida.\n\n4.1. 1.2.1 Trident\n\nPoseidon's weapon, as derived from its inherent character, is a symbolic attribute of his eventually well-developed eminence as god of the sea. This weapon is the trident. Attempts to draw an accurate picture of the trident in both solemn art forms and rhapsodic texts have obviously the noteworthy aids of the dictionary definitions. The trident was a twin-spear, three-pronged weapon, i.e. the ancient version of the actual trident. The interesting detail, which plausibly is a conventional marker of the actual model, is that its design abundantly simulates the negative form of the shape of the trident. It is suggested that such an analogy stemmed from the practicality of recognizing a real trident only through its repeated occurrence in currently standardized or traditional emblematic forms along times and space. Moreover, an emblem that holds an object representing a good may influence, in mixed times, the imitation of the object, because the unknown good may also be associated with the constantly touchable emblem. Such a mechanism could be responsible for the perpetuating use of the actual trident in religious rites or rituals honoring the god of the sea, in the way that since antiquity and, by and large, until today, holy emblems being exhibited by secular carriers have been featuring imitated prototypes. Equally implied is that the notion of a physical emblem that symbolizes virtuous gods exists since the dawn, in remote tribal forms, of certain human societies, and holds, in all these stages, a notable power of activism.\n\n4.2. 1.2.2 Horses\n\nWhile the boar and the bull are referential of the earliest Indo-European concept of masculine force, the horse is connected with that romantic art of the later Greek civilization under whose inspiration Poseidon, as the equestrian sea-god, becomes the lordly cavalier of a world newly enriched by a Mediterranean culture greatly advanced in creative abilities. The relevance of the horse as a symbol for Poseidon was sustained throughout the Minoan-Mycenaean period. More frequently, the horse is introduced standing beside groups of deities at the period of the geometric artist. Any suggestion of Poseidon's horse metaphor possessing a solar identity is not supported by what is known of Poseidon, the sun, and the horse in antiquity. The fact that other equi-centric deities, which may be confused with Poseidon, have mythic aspects where horses are connected with the appearance or disappearance of the day, the months, or the seasons, should not be confused with the lord of the waters using whip and bridle-reins to discipline the restless element. The significance of the horse as Poseidon's symbol is to express that divine dominance is not expressed by force but by cultured qvsoxieia that, just as the rider's skillfully guided horses readily carry their loads to the wall of a city newly enriched by trade, so may the valor of the true warrior contribute to the monumentalization of a Hellenic polis.\n\n4.3. 1.2.3 Dolphins\n\nThe most frequently depicted marine animals on the sanctuary's columns, the dolphins, are more than 180. Deities like Eirene Talia (Peace of the Thessalonians) were accompanied by dolphins. Although Pausanias does not mention the sanctuary's co-founders, still the sanctuaries built in the middle of the 4th century would belong to King Philippos, Olympias, Alexander, and other members of their family. Macedonian royal propaganda utilized dolphins as a symbol of Poseidon and thus possibly of the royal family. Similarly to the trident or the thunderbolt, this deity's emblem can be found on the weapon and armor decorations of their soldiers and on gold coins and medals that the royalty minted and handed out at various events. At Amphipolis' sanctuary, the representation in question would point to the family's relation to the god Poseidon/Neptune. Such an association to the sea deity would possibly attest to Philippos' Belerenes, Zeus' assassins, or the other qualities of King Perdikkas' heirs, but the iconography choice also conveyed implied messages regarding the royal house and its public relations strategy.\n\n5. Symbolism of Poseidon\n\nPoseidon symbolizes the physical and spiritual characteristics of water. The Greeks were seafaring people and they depended on the sea. This mighty god was always needed and mattered to them because the sea was both magnanimous and hazardous. Poseidon introduced to the Greeks horses, gave them the first one, and taught horse racing. His symbols are the trident, dolphins, and horses. A well-known statue of Zeus in Olympia was made of ivory, but his trident, the most widely recognizable symbol of the god, was made of gold. His horses were also golden. The trident is a special weapon and a working tool. It fulfills a destructive function, causing earthquakes and storms. However, in Homer's Iliad, a trident leaps upward and strikes the heavenly arch. The sky rains when the bottom steel of the trident touches the parasites and the water falls – autumn and winter begins. In mythology, the trident, headed with two prongs, was forged by the Cyclops on behalf of Poseidon, and thus it is at the center of numerous traditions. Each of these prongs was given to one of the Cyclops, citizens of Sicily, in return Petelia obtained annual rations.\n\n6. Conclusion\n\nPoseidon was one of the divine 12 Olympian figures in ancient Greek mythology, and he was exclusively and uniquely the god of the sea. It was the reason why he was often called the 'god of the waters'. Despite being symbolized with a human body and loving people, he was also known for very clear physical signs such as the terrestrial robe, which symbolically represented the origin of aquatics and equines in art, and the trident, which was a symbol of 'three' powers. In terms of mythology, according to ancient Greek mythology, the physical traits and symbolism of the sea god Poseidon were depicted. There are very different symbols used to express the sea god Poseidon with his symbols. These symbols are important because they create meaning. Moreover, pictures do not only reflect visual contents but also information in themselves as they are the mirrors of the artist's ideas and intellectual capacity. Symbol interpretation, an art's visual language, and art in its philosophical depth render him an essential element in understanding the symbol of the sea god and his symbols. Through these interpretations, this paper has sought an answer to the question about the physical traits and symbolism of Poseidon. The importance of this analysis lies in the different dimensions and significances of interpreting the sea god's symbols. Moreover, Poseidon being one of the divine 12 Olympian figures has further increased the value of this research."
