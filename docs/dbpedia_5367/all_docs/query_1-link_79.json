        "text": "So thoroughly has it filtered into the collective consciousness of movie watchers, The Poseidon Adventure is one of those movies familiar to those who haven't even seen it. The shot of the tidal wave sweeping across the ship; the man plunging into a skylight; Shelly Winters swimming underwater; that hippie band that served as style mentors to Kings of Leon. Whether you've seen it or just seen the clips, you've pretty much seen all you need to see of this classic soggy tale.\n\nWhile Airport was one of the first big \"stars in peril\" movies, producer Irwin Allen took the genre to a whole new level with his \"Hell, upside down\" (as the tagline read) epic. In conjunction with Allen's follow-up, The Towering Inferno, and other disaster movies such as Earthquake, the Seventies were so rife with their ilk that the classic Kentucky Fried Movie spoofed them with a trailer for the \"Samuel L. Bronkowitz production of That's Armageddon!\"\n\nConveniently released to coincide with the release of the two-thirds-shorter-in-title remake, Poseidon, The Poseidon Adventure (Special Edition) is a well-appointed, two-disc set that fans of the film will certainly enjoy. For the twelve of you who haven't seen it before, it's the story of the final voyage of the S.S. Poseidon, destined to be cut into scrap when it reaches its destination of Athens. On New Year's Eve, we're introduced to the people with whom we're going to be spending our time with after the ship tips and the red shirt passengers are done away with.\n\nReverend Scott (Gene Hackman) is a fiery radical preacher who's being banished to an isolated African country. Det. Lt. Rogo (Ernest Borgnine) is a cop married to Linda (Stella Stevens), an ex-prostitute whom he arrested six times before making an honest woman. Bickering siblings Susan (Pamela Sue Martin) and Robin (Eric Shea) are meeting their parents in Athens while the old Jewish couple of Belle (Shelley Winters) and Manny (Jack Albertson) are continuing on to Israel to see their grandson. James (Red Buttons), a lonely haberdasher; Acres (Roddy McDowall), a waiter; and Nonnie (Carol Lynley), the singer of the hippie band; round out the designated survivors group.\n\nOver the objections of the Captain (Leslie Nielsen) - who feels that the ship is top-heavy due to insufficient ballast - the ship is ordered to steam full speed ahead and when they encounter the tidal wave spawned by an undersea earthquake, that's when the Poseidon's adventure begins. (Groan.) Realizing that rescue will come through the upended hull, Scott gathers everyone we met in the first act - convenient how that works out, no? - and leads his ragtag flock though one perilous set of circumstances after another.\n\nWith a whopping five Oscar-winning actors in the cast - I guess you can't eat the trophy - The Poseidon Adventure is like an episode of The Love Boat with better actors and more death and destruction. Actually, the \"better actors\" descriptor is arguable considering the egregious overacting on frequent exhibit. Borgnine and Stevens squabble so much at the beginning (and the middle and the end) I wanted them tossed overboard while the seas were still calm. And when you compile a list the great performances Hackman has given in his long career, this isn't one of them, as he indulges in his own frequent scenery gnawing.\n\nAction movies, by their nature, have a structural conundrum in that if they don't take time to set up the characters, the audience won't care about their eventual fates; but if too much time is spent on \"the slow, boring parts\", it only drags out into tedium and it's the imbalance between these halves that ultimately sinks The Poseidon Adventure. There are several scenes of interesting drama with provocative themes, but they share time with others of sledgehammer subtlety and honestly, aren't audiences here just for the spectacle?\n\nJames Cameron's mastery of story, pacing and action allowed his own doomed ocean liner film, Titanic (perhaps you've heard of it?), to get everything right that The Poseidon Adventure got wrong - starting with characters you don't hate from the beginning that you didn't care whether they lived or died. Sure, Titanic has a definite budgetary and technological edge that The Poseidon Adventure couldn't have matched. But Titanic's three-hour running time seems to zip by faster than the older film's two-hour length does and pacing has nothing to do with available resources.\n\nIn addition to being swamped in Titanic's artistic wake, what also hurts The Poseidon Adventure today is that its familiarity and influence - definitely fueling parodies like Airplane and probably inspiring scenes like the lung-bursting swim through the flooded kitchen in Alien Resurrection - has made it less spectacular to contemporary audiences.\n\nWhether the remake will manage to kick the hit-miss ratio up a notch with the addition of modern special effects is unknown at this writing. Maybe they go strictly for spectacle; maybe they'll add some characters we'll care about; maybe they'll just waste our time with a pointless remake of a film that was as good as it could've been in the first place. The Poseidon Adventure isn't a great ocean liner disaster movie - especially in the post-Titanic cinematic world - but for its time, it was and is an adequate popcorn muncher.\n\nScore: 5 out of 10\n\nThe Video\n\nDespite the film's age, the print used for the 2.35:1 anamorphic transfer is clean as a whistle, with no dirt or damage in evidence. Colors are true to the palette used in films of that era with accurate skin tones and saturated colors free of smearing or noise. Overall detail is excellent with barely any compression artifacts noted. A few of the dark and murky scenes could've been a touch brighter, but overall this is an excellent and better-than-expected transfer.\n\nScore: 9 out of 10\n\nLanguages and Audio\n\nWhether they're following the lead of distributors like Criterion - who put out discs with original audio mixes instead of whipping up some pseudo-surround track to gain the 5.1 bullet point on the box - for artistic reasons or cost savings, I've been hearing more DVDs without superfluous and unimpressive fake \"surround\" tracks. Thus, audio choices are English stereo and French or Spanish mono with subtitles in Spanish or English. Audio options can't be switched on the fly, requiring that you exit to the menu to change tracks - it's annoying if want to switch between commentaries quickly.\n\nThe stereo track is pretty basic and workmanlike, with little in the way of low-frequency activity, leaving explosions thin-sounding. Stereophonic panning is hardly evident and occasionally the audio mix levels seemed out of whack, but this is most likely source-limited. Dialogue is generally clear and very few instances of distortion were noted.\n\nScore: 6 out of 10\n\nPackaging and Extras\n\nThe disc comes in the standard keep case with the second disc on a flap, without an insert. The heavyweight embossed slipcover has slightly different artwork than the case, so it's worth hanging onto unlike so many duplicative sleeves.\n\nThe feature-length commentary by director Ronald Neame is wryly candid and scholarly, admitting that Hackman probably felt like he was slumming after his Oscar win for The French Connection - \"we all were\", Neame confesses - and ponders whether he should have reined in Borgnine and Hackman's shouted performances. He tells that they made the film for 10 to 15-year-old boys and that while the critics panned the film, this youth appeal is what secured its success. (While he is obviously an older gentleman, I was shocked to learn that he is now 95 years young - he looks and sounds better than some people half his age!)\n\nThe other feature commentary has Pamela Sue Martin, Stella Stevens and Carol Lynley together and it's a more informal chatfest with plenty of self-deprecating reminiscences. They poke fun at Leslie Nielsen's subsequent comedic career; Stevens points out her \"magic hair\" during the swimming scene; Martin tells of the shock of being on such a large production for only her second film role; and Lynley reveals that despite her character supposedly being unable to swim, she has always been an excellent swimmer. They sometimes lapse into silences, but it's generally a pleasant, if not very informative track.\n\nAn odd and somewhat useless gimmick is Follow the Escape. When active, an icon will flash onscreen and if you hit Enter, you're taken to a blueprint of the ship that shows where the survivors are at that point and who has been bumped off. Since most of the deaths occur in one location, it doesn't get a lot of play and it's not like it's hard to keep score.\n\nSwimming over to the second disc, it leads off with AMC Backstory: The Poseidon Adventure (25:07), a good overview of how Allen, a veteran TV producer of series such as Lost In Space, prevailed in making the film in the face of a studio that balked at the then-astronomical budget of - get this - $5 million. (It went on to become the top-grossing film of 1973.)\n\nUnder Featurettes is a half-dozen items beginning with The Cast Looks Back (5:42), which is what it sounds like: various actors reminiscing about the arduous shoot, heavy on praise for Irwin Allen. (Sadly, Pamela Sue Martin - a crush target of mine from her Nancy Drew days in the late-Seventies - didn't age very well.) Falling Up With Ernie (4:09) isn't a weird science lesson from Sesame Street, but a piece about Ernie Orsatti, the actor who performed the iconic fall into the skylight.\n\nWhile it sounds like a Dr. Seuss story, The Writer: Stirling Silliphant (9:15) profiles the prolific and acclaimed writer of series such as Naked City and Route 66 and films that included In the Heat of the Night (for which he won an Oscar), Charly and The Towering Inferno. Moving on (or up - or is it down?) comes The Heroes of the Poseidon (9:52) a surprisingly intellectual discussion of the storytelling myths and metaphors embodied by the characters and their actions. You'll be amazed how much religious imagery was present that you may not have noticed.\n\nThe Morning After Story (8:59) has songwriter Al Kasha talking about how the Oscar-winning dentists office staple was written. Renee Armand, the demo vocalist, is also interviewed and tells how her visit to the set influenced the costume design for the film's singer. Finally, R.M.S. Queen Mary (6:47) tells of the grand ocean liner which provided the basis for the Poseidon and how the book's author, Paul Gallico, drew from an incident on a voyage when waves hit the ship, tipping it onto its side for a few seconds.\n\nThe section titled Conversations with Ronald Neame has three sub-sections: Sinking Corridor (3:17), which reveals how the shot was executed and the minor miracle that happened involving the camera used; Generations of Fans (3:17), in which he talks about how the kids who saw it then are now parents whose children love it now and write him letters, one of which he reads; and Turning Over the Ship (2:26), showing with a ruler how camera angles and a tilting set created the illusion.\n\nThe Vintage Promotional Material section has the Original 1972 Featurette (10:00), the teaser and full trailers for The Poseidon Adventure and the trailer for The Towering Inferno. The featurette is a pip, drenched in hyperbolic rhetoric, giving away the final survivor total - including showing several of the death scenes; bad form for a hype piece - and bragging about how in an era that was seeing smaller films with few sets and smaller casts, it was \"the return of the movie movie\". The way Allen and Neame wrangle the extras is funny, too.\n\nFurther mining the vintage vein is an article from the September 1972 issue of American Cinematographer, complete with zoomable photos, presented over 43 pages with helpful page counters as seen on that other boat disaster, Titanic, flick's DVD. Being a trade magazine, the interview gets into hardcore techie stuff without a glossary for those unfamiliar with the lingo. It would've been nice if they had annotated it for the civilians.\n\nThere three Galleries of Marketing, Publicity, and Behind-the-Scenes images total up to about a hundred pictures and the trio of Storyboard Comparisons differ from the usual split-screen presentation in favor of alternating between the boards and the finished film as the scenes go on.\n\nScore: 8 out of 10"
