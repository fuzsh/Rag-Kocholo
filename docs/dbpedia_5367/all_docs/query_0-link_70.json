        "text": "Poseidon Facts\n\nReviewed by Sherman Smith\n\nIn ancient Greek mythology, Poseidon holds the title of the god of seas and storms. Aside from immortality and great strength, Poseidon stands out for his ability to manipulate bodies of water. However, not many people know about Poseidon beyond his rule over the oceans. While water usually indicates life, water can also take it away. Much like the sea, Poseidon exhibits an unpredictability that would leave mortals at his mercy.

Throughout Greek mythology, Poseidon has often been portrayed with vengeful tendencies and a fragile ego. Like most other Greek deities, the God of The Sea is notorious for his temper.\n\nWhenever upset, Poseidon would create storms and earthquakes to punish those who wrong him. He also isn’t above bringing hazardous floods and mass destruction to the Earth once angered. How’s that for Poseidon facts?\n\nLike the other major Greek gods, Poseidon got swallowed whole by his father.\n\nBecause of a prophecy that warned against his own children overthrowing him, Cronus devoured his offspring as soon as they were born – apart from Zeus.\n\nUpon conspiring with Gaia, Rhea gave birth to Zeus in secret, giving Cronus a wrapped stone to devour in his place. Zeus then grew up to avenge his siblings, eventually tricking Cronus into regurgitating them.\n\nReunited, the gods worked together to overthrow Cronus and the rest of the Titans.\n\nSeafarers once relied on Poseidon for the safety of their journey.\n\nDuring the time of ancient Greece, seafarers would often pray to Poseidon in hopes of good sailing weather and safe journeys. Aside from travelers, many people in the Hellenic hinterlands, cities, and colonies worshiped and honored Poseidon.\n\nThe Trevi fountain includes a sculpture of Poseidon.\n\nThe famous fountain located in Rome, Italy features sculptures of the Greek god of the sea, Poseidon. This art piece was completed by Giuseppe Pannini and many others.\n\nThe Trevi Fountain has also been featured in many notable films during the 1950s until the early 2000s.\n\nPoseidon is also worshiped as a god of navigation.\n\nWith the sea as his domain, seafarers also considered Poseidon as a god of navigation. Men at sea would often rely on Poseidon’s guidance when caught in sticky situations. However, the god is not widely known for this, rather just referred to as the god of the oceans and storms.\n\nPoseidon is considered a god of fertility by some.\n\nAside from recognizing him as a ruler of his domain, people also considered Poseidon as a Greek god of fertility. In Greek mythology, Poseidon had several children with most of his sexual partners.\n\nUnlike other gods, Poseidon was also very dedicated to his children. As expected of someone with his temper, Poseidon was always quick to punish those who hurt his kids.\n\nThe coastal town of Pylos have cults dedicated to Poseidon.\n\nThe cults of Poseidon date as far back as the late Bronze Age. With the location’s significance to Greek myths, it’s no surprise that the first Poseidon cults originated from Pylos in Crete.\n\nHistorically, the town held a festival of games every two years in honor of Poseidon. This event included activities such as chariot racing and horse racing.\n\nPoseidon felt more at home in the ocean than in Mount Olympus.\n\nAlong with Zeus and Hades, Poseidon technically reigned as one of the three supreme rulers of Mount Olympus. However, despite this, he spent most of his time in his palace underneath the waters.\n\nIt is said in Greek mythology that Poseidon preferred being underwater in his home rather than be surrounded by the other gods and goddesses of Mount Olympus.\n\nThe dolphin is one of the many symbols that represent Poseidon.\n\nPoseidon is often associated with many nautical objects. Among these symbols, the most widely recognized are the trident and the dolphin.\n\nTraditionally, artists usually depicted Poseidon with dolphins. In these paintings, the god would be surrounded by a pod of dolphins or riding a chariot pulled by them.\n\nPoseidon had sexual relations with Aphrodite.\n\nOne of Poseidon’s many affairs included his sister Aphrodite, the goddess of love and desire. However, Aphrodite went on to pursue a relationship with Ares, with the support of Poseidon.\n\nPoseidon’s romance with Aphrodite produced two children: Rhodos and Herophilos.\n\nPoseidon is the father of Orion.\n\nAside from entanglements with each other, the gods have also been known to pursue affairs with humans and animals alike. Among his many children, Poseidon’s relationship with a king’s daughter produced Orion.\n\nBorn to a god and the mortal daughter of King Minos, Euryale, Orion is one of many demigods in Greek mythology. Because of this, Poseidon blessed him with the ability to walk over water.\n\nLike many Greek gods, the origins of Poseidon’s remain unknown.\n\nWhile it is unclear where the Greek gods get their names from, there have been several theories on their origins. For Poseidon, it is widely believed that his name comes from the Greek language, translating to husband and earth.\n\nThis has led to Poseidon’s monikers of “earth-shaker” and “husband of the earth.”\n\nPoseidon is often seen carrying a trident.\n\nTraditionally, people have used the trident for fishing and as a polearm. For centuries, classical art has also portrayed the trident as Poseidon’s weapon of choice.\n\nThe trident’s name comes from Latin origins of the word ‘tridens,’ which means three. This likely refers to the number of prongs on the weapon.\n\nThe cult of Peloponnesus worshiped Poseidon as a horse.\n\nIn Poseidon’s many cults, his worshipers would often offer horses, bulls, and male sheep to the god. His believers would offer these animals as a sacrifice in exchange for Poseidon’s protection on both land and sea.\n\nAdditionally, some cults believe that Poseidon takes on the form of a horse running among a herd of stallions. Definitely one of the strangest Poseidon facts.\n\nSome Bronze age Greek tablets state that there was a feminine version of Poseidon.\n\nAncient Mycenaean Greek inscriptions once stated that Poseidon had a female counterpart known as Posedeia. However, some scholars believe that this figure was simply another unknown consort of Poseidon.\n\nThe temple of Poseidon was put up in 440 BC.\n\nDuring his ascendancy, the Athenian statesman Pericles established the temple of Poseidon. Pericles had the temple built on the ruins of another temple dating back to the Archaic period.\n\nThe Poseidon building’s architecture featured a rectangular shape with four colonnades on each side.\n\nScholars consider Poseidon as one of the most powerful Olympian gods.\n\nAll the gods on Mount Olympus have different domains and powers, but only three are generally considered the strongest. This Big 3 includes Poseidon, Zeus, and Hades. Poseidon rules over all bodies of water, with the ability to create earthquakes and storms to cause devastation to his enemies and those who go against him.\n\nAmong all other Greek gods, Poseidon is considered to be on par in terms of power with Zeus, the king of gods.\n\nPoseidon is typically portrayed with wet, curly hair.\n\nMany sculptures portray Poseidon with curly hair and a beard. Since he is the god of the sea, Poseidon was also depicted with a wet look distinguished by his hair.\n\nSea creatures pulled the chariot of Poseidon instead of horses.\n\nBetter known as Hippocampuses, Poseidon’s trusty steeds were depicted as horses with fish tails for their lower halves.\n\nThroughout history, many art pieces depicted the god of the sea with two or four of these creatures at a time. In English, these creatures would also often be referred to as sea-horses.\n\nTraditionally, Poseidon is said to have caused most of the occurring earthquakes in Greece.\n\nMany Greeks believe in Poseidon as the god of earthquakes, since the phenomenon is caused by the erosion of rocks in the ocean. Because Poseidon was so ill-tempered, he would often cause earthquakes and cause trouble for mortals.\n\nPoseidon was saved from his father’s stomach by his brother Zeus.\n\nTo recover his siblings from Cronus’ stomach, Zeus tricked his father into ingesting an emetic concoction mixed by his grandmother Gaia.\n\nAthena competed with Poseidon for the ownership of the city of Athens.\n\nTo settle the competition, the two gods of Olympus held a contest on the Acropolis. According to the myth, the two gods competed to exhibit their godly powers on a rock. Using his trident, Poseidon produced a salt spring or a horse.\n\nMeanwhile, Athena touched the rock with her spear, producing an olive tree from the ground. Despite Poseidon’s attempts, Athena was proclaimed the victor of the contest.\n\nPoseidon ruled over the oceans after defeating Cronus.\n\nAfter the defeat of Cronus, Poseidon, Zeus, and Hades were each given a part of the world to rule over. After these events, Mount Olympus became home to the twelve Olympian gods and goddesses.\n\nThe Pegasus is one of the children of Poseidon.\n\nPoseidon is responsible for the birth of many creatures found in Greek mythology. Among these creatures include the winged horse called Pegasus.\n\nThe Pegasus is a child born from Poseidon and Medusa. Like its father, the horse is considered immortal. According to the myth, Pegasus sprouted from the neck of Medusa’s beheaded crown.\n\nPoseidon is rumored to have created the horse.\n\nAmong many of his worshipers, Poseidon is also considered to be the god of horses. In Greek mythology, Poseidon’s relationship with the goddess Demeter led to the creation of horses.\n\nThe story for its creation states that Poseidon wanted to impress the goddess by creating a beautiful creature never seen before.\n\nPoseidon owned a palace made of jewels under the sea.\n\nThe palace was said to be entirely made of corals embedded with the most beautiful jewels in the world. According to the lore, this is also where Poseidon spends most of his time outside of Mount Olympus.\n\nPolybotes and Poseidon were once at war with each other.\n\nReared by Uranus and Gaia, Polybotes was born to destroy Poseidon. The two faced each other during the gigantomachy, or the war between the giants and the gods.\n\nPoseidon chased him through the sea and threw a chunk of land at him which was known as the island of Nisyros.\n\nPoseidon had a half-human half-fish son.\n\nAmong his notable offspring, Poseidon fathered Triton – the first merman in written existence. Also considered the demigod of the sea, Triton was birthed by Amphitrite.\n\nTriton lived with Poseidon in the golden palace found at the bottom of the sea. In some English literature, Triton is portrayed as the messenger for Poseidon.\n\nThe wife of Poseidon is Amphitrite.\n\nAmphitrite is the goddess of the sea and is also one of the many daughters of Nereus and Doris. Poseidon chose Amphitrite among her other sisters while they were dancing the isle of Naxos.\n\nIn some mythologies and stories, Amphitrite was not the sole wife of Poseidon.\n\nPoseidon has several preserved sculptures located globally.\n\nIn many European countries, several statues of Poseidon can be found preserved in museums and historical landmarks. A common trait these statues have is the bearded and curly hair, as well as a trident in his possession.\n\nSome of these sculptures can be found in Germany, England, Denmark, and Slovakia.\n\nAlexander the great once prayed to Poseidon for safe voyages.\n\nBefore the battle of Issus, it was said that Alexander the Great first visited the shores of Syria to pray to Poseidon. Alexander the Great asked Poseidon to cast a four-horse chariot into the sea for the war.\n\nThree elder cyclopes made Poseidon's trident.\n\nThe cyclopes were also responsible for forging the signature weapon of Zeus, the lightning bolt. Poseidon’s trident wields power over the sea, with the power to create a wave or tsunami. Poseidon also uses this trident to strike land, triggering earthquakes.\n\nThis trident is also used by the US Navy Seals.\n\nIn a special warfare insignia, the United States Navy Seals use the trident in their logo. This is also known as the SEAL Trident or The Budweiser.\n\nThis insignia is worn by those who complete the basic underwater demolition training and qualification tests.\n\nPoseidon had many children.\n\nIn many stories, Poseidon is considered the father of many heroic icons in Greek mythology. However, not all of Poseidon’s children were human.\n\nSome were a half-human and half-animal, while others were completely animal. Poseidon is also responsible for many mythological creatures such as the cyclops and the pegasus.\n\nThe trident of Poseidon is used as a universal symbol of the sea.\n\nAccording to two Vatican Mythographers, the trident of Poseidon symbolizes the three properties of water.
