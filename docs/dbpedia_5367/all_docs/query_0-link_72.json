        "text": "“The Poseidon Adventure” turns survival horror on its head by making the vices of its victims into their greatest moral strengths.\n\nAmongst the slate of other disaster films of its era, “Poseidon” is a league or two above the rest. That’s because - amidst the fiery devastation - it actually persuades the audience to care for its cast of characters.\n\nEach of the soon-to-be-sufferers in the film is introduced with a surefire vice: Gene Hackman’s preacher is a merciless objectivist, Ernest Borgnine married a prostitute and suffers from seasickness, and Shelley Winters’ retired shopkeeper has gained more than a few pounds in her silver years.\n\nDirector Ronald Neame makes these failings so obvious; it seems to lay the fates of…\n\nI really really liked this. The Poseidon Adventure is a very good disaster film with a solid set-up & pay-off script and really good character writing.....for only the male characters.\n\nThe politics are dated very dated, all women are seen as emotional wrecked “objects” that need a man to get through this disaster, adding jokes about the weight of a woman and so on. It’s unfortunate and it sadly was distracting to me. All male characters have in a way good character arcs (wish they didn’t rush it too much at the ending), but the three female characters don’t really get nearly that much attention.\n\nEven if you can look passed that, the film is dumb...maybe not even the script, but…\n\n\"Jesus Christ! What happened?\"\n\n\"We've turned over.\"\n\nHot take: Gene Hackman has never been more attractive than in this disaster flick. Is it Reverend Scott's unconventional attitudes (he's well beyond the \"thoughts and prayers\" stage after the Poseidon capsizes and knows that only direct action will help the survivors) and his unfailing belief in himself and his fellow passengers on their treacherous trek to the hull, or is it actually that one exposed shoulder? I'll never tell.\n\nThe Last Voyage is more efficient in the race against time to escape a sinking ship, The Towering Inferno is the scariest and most emotionally engaging offering in its genre and The Swarm is just plain hilarious (though not in the flat-out terrible…\n\nAfter one man's wife dies, he refers to her as the thing he loved most. That's an unfortunate way to put it, of course, but also pretty indicative of how the film as a whole approaches women: as objects to break men's hearts. Though one woman's sacrifice is noted to have served others, she's also subject to jokes about her appearance. Almost all of the women are shown to be emotional wrecks, but the men have more dignity in their outrage and despair. It's not as night and day as those descriptions might suggest, but the trend is there. It's tiresome and disappointing, because parts of this film are incredibly tense and other parts wonderfully inventive. Hammy acting and bad…"
