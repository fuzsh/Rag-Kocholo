        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Audiences seem to have enjoyed 9-1-1 paying homage to The Poseidon Adventure.\n\nBobby and Athena’s three-episode cruise ship disaster came to a dramatic conclusion during the March 28 episode which, after seven days of multi-platform viewing, became the series’ most-watched telecast in more than 2 years.\n\nAccording to Disney, the episode drew 10.72M viewers in seven days of viewing across ABC, Hulu and digital platforms. That’s nearly double the audience of 5.5M that tuned in live + same-day.\n\nAmong adults 18-49, the episode was up 3% over the previous week with a 2.18 rating.\n\nSince making the move to ABC for Season 7, 9-1-1 has been off to a solid start. In March, the premiere episode set a streaming record for the network, scoring its most-streamed day ever on Hulu on March 15, one day after Season 7 debuted, tallying 1.6M hours.\n\nCreated by Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Tim Minear, the series follows the lives of L.A. first responders such as police officers, paramedics, firefighters and dispatchers. The show currently stars Angela Bassett, Peter Krause, Oliver Stark, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Ryan Guzman, Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Corinne Massiah and Gavin McHugh."
