        "text": ".\n\n.\n\nDirecting: B\n\nActing: B-\n\nWriting: C+\n\nCinematography: B\n\nEditing: B\n\nSpecial Effects: B+\n\nThere have been a lot of complaints about how Poseidon doesn't stand up to the \"quality\" of the original film it remakes, The Poseidon Adventure -- as if that original disaster flick widely credited as launching the string of such genre films in the seventies were some kind of cinematic gem.\n\nThe truth is, there was a lot more to character development in the original, and the characters were, by and large, far more interesting. The fat swimming champion played by Shelly Winters has no equivalent in the 2006 version; the closest we get is Richard Dreyfus's suicidal gay man, who comes across more as diversity tokenism than as representation of any real people in the real world.\n\nBut really. Who gives a shit?\n\nThose of us who loved The Poseidon Adventure quite frankly never watched it for the \"well-rounded characters\" -- as they weren't exactly near and dear to our hearts then either. We watched it (duh) because it was such a palpable thrill to watch a rogue wave completely capsize a huge cruise ship. All the screaming! All the bodies flying and falling off of fixtures once on the floor that has become the ceiling! All the furniture crushing people! Watching the capsize scene was like a movie version of crack -- you just couldn't get enough. The last time I watched the movie with some friends, we backed up the DVD to watch the entire scene a second time. Perhaps it's a little sick, but hey, that's America.\n\nAnd what Poseidon lacks in character development, it more than makes up in spectacle -- the very reason we go to see a movie like this in the first place. In spite of a lot of cheap CGI tricks (an opening shot that includes a scan completely around the exterior of the ship and then closing in on one of the main characters jogging, for example), which gives the picture a cartoonishly unconvincing quality not unlike George Lucas's latest Star Wars films, you still can't tear your eyes away.\n\nIt's all in the details -- the flooding, the flash fires, the bodies flung into the water from beneath the ship as it turns over. The entire disaster is viewed with exponentially more such detail than in the original film, and as a result makes it more entertaining.\n\nOne thing Wolfgang Petersen can do well is staging, and in contrast to the original film, there is a lot more maneuvering of huge crowds, either at a New Year's Eve party (first festive and jovial and then literally turned upside-down) or in other settings such as the kitchen or on a dance floor. The extras are used far more efficiently than Ronald Neame (the forgettable director of the original) apparently ever dreamed of.\n\nScript writer Mark Protosevich changes the characters significantly, and leaves out a lot of pertinent information (where did the ship come from? where is it going? what caused the rogue wave? why are any of these people on this ship to begin with? who cares!), but beat by beat the film is essentially the same as the original. And once the cruise ship is capsized and a select few characters have decided to ignore orders to stay in the ball room and wait for rescue, the ascent to the bottom of the ship begins.\n\nA movie like Poseidon is unfortunate in that its peak moment happens far too soon, leaving a sense of a lost climax. Nothing that follows the capsizing of the ship is anywhere near as exciting, and instead we just get the story of eight or so characters barely keeping ahead of the flooding water as the ship slowly sinks. To some, this is pretty ho-hum and yawn-inducing, but this portion of the movie, at least, is a fair amount more gripping than it was in the original film. One scene has everyone crawling inside some tight air shafts and it makes you feel just as claustrophobic as the characters; when the upturned ball room finally floods it's staged with far more finesse than merely seeing cascading water and hearing people scream.\n\nIt's the sense of urgency that makes the rest of the film work in a way that the original actually didn't; the throwaway characters are secondary at best. Reluctantly \"led\" by professional gambler Josh Lucas, they include a former New York City mayor and fire fighter (Kurt Russell) whose daughter (Emmy Rossum) has just gotten secretly engaged to her boyfriend (Mike Vogel); a single mother (Jacinda Barrett) traveling with her cute young son (Jimmy Bennett); a kitchen waiter (Freddy Rodriguez) and the stowaway he brought along (Mia Maestro); a short-lived hanger-on played by Matt Dillon's brother Kevin; and of course, the gay Richard Dreyfus. This time around, the lounge singer (who apparently does not have \"The Morning After\" as part of her repertoire) does not go along with the survivors, but stays behind to perish with the captain in the ballroom.\n\nBut honestly: yadda yadda yadda. Not one of these characters is particularly memorable, not when several of them die, not when several of them live, and not when a few of them grieve for lost family members that were only two-dimensional anyway. It's the journey itself that sticks in our memory, the cartoonish violence and mayhem that clearly exists as escapist entertainment and should not be subjected to misguided comparisons to real-life events like 9/11. This is popcorn entertainment at its purest level.\n\nOverall: B\n\n.\n\n."
