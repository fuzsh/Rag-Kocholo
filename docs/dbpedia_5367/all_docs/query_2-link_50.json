        "meta_description": "It's New Year's Eve and festivities have begun aboard the luxury cruise Poseidon, at sea in the North Atlantic. One of the finest vessels of its kind, Poseidon stands more than 20 stories tall, boasts 800 staterooms and 13 passenger decks. Tonight, many of the ship's guests have gathered to greet the new year in style in the magnificent Main Ballroom. They raise champagne glasses as Captain Bradford (ANDRE BRAUGHER) delivers a holiday toast and the band (led by FERGIE of the Black Eyed Peas) rolls into a version of Auld Lang Syne. Meanwhile, on the bridge, the Chief Officer senses that something is wrong. Scanning the horizon, he sees it - a Rogue Wave; a monstrous wall of water over one hundred feet high, bearing down on them with tremendous speed. He tries to steer the ship away from maximum impact but it's too late. The wave strikes with colossal force, pitching the ship heavily to port before rolling it completely upside down. Passengers and crew are thrown into free fall, crushed by debris or dragged into the sea as water bursts in through shattered windows. Supports collapse, broken gas lines ignite flash fires and lights fail, leaving vast sections of the ship in darkness and chaos. In its aftermath a few hundred survivors are left to huddle in the still-intact Main Ballroom, now resting below the waterline. They should stay together, the captain maintains, and wait here for rescue.",

        "text": "“Poseidon” is a non-stop thrill as a small band of survivors climb through the inner workings of the ill-fated cruise ship trying to escape. During their journey, we are exposed to those who weren’t as fortunate and died; sometimes horrible deaths. However, while understanding that many perished, the director showed restraint and none were extremely graphic. Unfortunately, language again stops Dove from approving this adventure in the high seas.\n\nWe recommend you rent the original “Poseidon Adventure” which has been re-released on DVD."
