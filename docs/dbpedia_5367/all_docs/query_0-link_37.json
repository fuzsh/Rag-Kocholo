        "text": "The Poseidon Adventure (1972) was one of the first disaster flicks, along\n\nwith Airport (1970) and The Towering Inferno (1974). Given the technological\n\nadvances in visual effects made over the intervening years, it should come\n\nas no surprise that this remake would represent a substantial improvement\n\nover the first in terms of visual capture. Plus, director Wolfgang\n\nPetersen’s approach was to overhaul the script by drastically reducing the\n\nsappy chit-chat in order to transform the picture into a non-stop,\n\nnerve-wracking misadventure.\n\nAs for the characters, they’re still little based on readily recognizable\n\ncaricatures. There’s the former Navy diver (Josh Lucas), the suicidal,\n\njust-dumped, gay architect (Richard Dreyfuss), the clueless ship captain\n\n(Andre Braugher), the frantic single mom (Jacinda Barrett), her resourceful,\n\nnine year-old son (Jimmy Bennett), a disgraced ex-NYC mayor (Kurt Russell),\n\nhis recently-engaged daughter (Emmy Rossum), her world-class swimmer fiancé\n\n(Mike Vogel), a pompous jerk (Kevin Dillon), the saloon singer (Stacy\n\nFerguson), the Latino stowaway (Mia Maestro), and her busboy confidante\n\n(Freddie Rodriguez).\n\nPlaying like the Titanic but with all the emotional content left on the\n\ncutting-room floor, Poseidon achieves in about an hour and a half what it\n\ntook that Oscar-winner over three hours to get around to. The tragedy\n\nunfolds in the Atlantic on New Yea’s Eve aboard a cruise liner headed for\n\nNew York. At the stroke of midnight, the first mate signals the alarm when\n\nhe notices a rogue tidal wave headed straight for the boat.\n\nThis high-body count adventure kicks into high gear from here on in, never\n\nallowing a moment to catch your breaths till the entombed ensemble of hardy\n\nsurvivors finally bursts through the hull of the flipped ship to reach the\n\nocean’s surface. State-of-the-art f/x, but betrayed by a script as\n\nsuperficial as the original’s."
