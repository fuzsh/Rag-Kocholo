        "text": "Kafka, whose sense of humour has, I think, been vastly undervalued, wrote a short story called Poseidon, the god of the sea.\n\nIn the story, which is only two paragraphs long, Poseidon reflects that everyone seems to think all he does is sail the seven seas having a whale of a time. In fact, he is so bogged down in calculations and paperwork to make sure everything is running smoothly, he never goes out to sea at all. He muses that perhaps when the end of the world is nigh he may have a brief period of time in which to “make a quick little tour”.\n\nThat’s kind of how I’m feeling at the moment! I’ve been using the (relative) downtime of the half-term holiday to catch up with paperwork and various kinds of business-related admin. I’ve done very little creative work, and not been out enjoying the fruits of my labour.\n\nPerhaps once I’ve retired, and before I become too decrepit (or worse), I’ll be able to “make a quick little tour”.\n\nBut I’m never going to retire…."
