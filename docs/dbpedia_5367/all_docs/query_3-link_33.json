        "text": "In the religion and mythology of ancient Greece, Poseidon was the god of the sea and of water in general. Unpredictable and often violent, he frequently represented the destructive power of the sea and was also the god of earthquakes. He was closely associated with horses as well. In art, Poseidon was typically shown as a bearded man carrying a trident (a three-pronged fishing spear) and accompanied by a dolphin or a tuna. He traveled over the sea in a chariot pulled by creatures that had the heads and bodies of horses and the tails of fish. Poseidon was one of the 12 chief gods who lived on Mount Olympus. The Romans identified their god Neptune with Poseidon.\n\nPoseidon was one of the children of the Titans Cronus and Rhea and the brother of Zeus, Hades, Hera, Demeter, and Hestia. Cronus was the chief god, but his children overthrew him. Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon then divided up the rule of the world by drawing lots. Zeus won control of the heavens and became the chief god, while Hades became the god of the underworld. Rule of the sea fell to Poseidon.\n\nPoseidon would calm or guide the waves for people he favored, protecting them and speeding their way during voyages at sea. Often vindictive and quick to anger, he also sent powerful sea storms and sea creatures to punish those who drew his wrath. One myth tells that he helped build the walls to protect the city of Troy, but the king of Troy, Laomedon, refused to pay him the agreed-upon fee. Poseidon then sent a sea monster to terrorize Troy, and in the Trojan War he sided with Greece against Troy. Later, Poseidon relentlessly persecuted the Greek hero Odysseus for blinding his son Polyphemus.\n\nPoseidon fathered numerous children by his wife, the sea nymph Amphitrite, and by his many lovers. Many of his children, including Polyphemus, Orion, and Antaeus, were giants or savage creatures who inherited his violent temperament. By Medusa he fathered the divine winged horse Pegasus, and by Demeter, the divine horse Arion.\n\nThe chief festival held in Poseidon’s honor was the Isthmian Games. The festival included athletic and musical contests and took place near the Isthmus of Corinth."
