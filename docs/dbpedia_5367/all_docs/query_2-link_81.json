        "text": "Boris Godunov\n\nPrince\n\nJoined\n\nAug 23, 2002\n\nMessages\n\n401\n\nMay 4, 2006\n\n#1\n\nDue out soon is the Wolfgang Peterson's remake of the 1972 classic \"The Poseidon Adventure.\"\n\nFor those that don't know it, the 1972 film was the first (and some say greatest) of the \"Disaster Movies\" of the 1970s. The premise was straightfoward and simple: On New Year's Eve, an enormous passenger liner carrying thousands of celebrants is suddenly capsized by a rogue tsunami wave. While many are killed in the initial capsizing, a small band of survivors (led by a renegade priest) realize that they need to work their way to the bottom (now top) of the doomed ship to have any hope of escape. The film depicts the perilous journey through claustrophic passages where there is flooding and fires and explosions in a world that is literally upside-down.\n\nThe film--which was a huge commercial success--starred Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Shelly Winters, Red Buttons, Roddy McDowell and a host of other B-list 1970s celebrities. It's a pretty entertaining yarn, albeit marred by silly dialogue and some intense over-acting by the cast. At the time, the special effects were spectacular, especially the famous scene where the ship's grand ballroom turns upside down at the stroke of midnight, sending passengers in evening dress tumbling end-over-end and culminating with a poor guy dropping into a huge light fixture and getting zapped.\n\nThe remake is, IMO, long overdue. The premise of the film remains the same, although the Poseidon is now a modern cruise liner and the individual characters have been greatly changed. The cast looks decent: Kurt Russell, Richard Dreyfus, and Andre Braugher are present. Furthermore, given Peterson's reputation for spectacle, I've no doubt the production values will be astonishing. We'll see if the script is an improvement over the 1972 version (it would have to be, though).\n\nAnyone else waiting for this movie? I admit to being a sucker for a good disaster yarn which features lots of wanton destruction.\n\nChrTh\n\nHappy Yule!\n\nJoined\n\nOct 13, 2001\n\nMessages\n\n6,255\n\nLocation\n\nPiedmont Triad, North Carolina\n\nMay 4, 2006\n\n#2\n\nWasn't there a TV remake of it last year? ...

I didn't see it, but they changed the disaster to being a terrorist bomb rather than a tidal wave that capsizes the ship. So they preyed on contemporary fears...\n\nI\"m not concerned with the movie being 93 minutes, because--in all honesty--the concept really doesn't support anything much longer.

That part definitely looks great. Don't know about the rest, but the characters trying to survive the disater wasn't really brilliant in the original and I still enjoy the original a lot.\n\nBoris Godunov\n\nPrince\n\nJoined\n\nAug 23, 2002\n\nMessages\n\n401\n\nMay 4, 2006\n\n#10\n\nAnd let's face it. Without Borgnine's overbearing \"acting,\" the ensemble should be much more tolerable.\n\nI'm under no delusions that the script will be Shakespeare...but the original script was terrible. I mean, the dialogue was comically bad. I think it will have to be better.\n\nSilent Spectre\n\nUnuttered\n\nJoined\n\nMar 25, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n106\n\nMay 4, 2006\n\n#11\n\nBoris Godunov said:\n\nYeah, it was another of those \"Let's beat a major studio to the punch with our cheap, crappy version!\" It starred Steve Gutenberg, which tells you a lot right there.

Ships don't capsize like that. The thing would just sink. It might roll over on its side like the Andrea Doria, but it wouldn't flip over 180 degrees.\n\nJust another example of why made for TV movies are generally thoughtless crap.\n\nJtheJackal\n\nEmperor\n\nJoined\n\nJul 25, 2002\n\nMessages\n\n1,521\n\nMay 4, 2006\n\n#16\n\nSilent Spectre said:\n\nWait, how could you blow a ship upside down.
