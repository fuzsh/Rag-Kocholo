        "text": "NBC’s State of Affairs is adding a chief of staff to its ranks.\n\nThe freshman drama starring Katherine Heigl has enlisted Rake alum David Harbour as a series regular, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.\n\nDescribed as Scandal meets The West Wing, the show revolves around a maverick CIA officer (Heigl) who was plucked from the field to become the president’s (Alfre Woodard) daily briefer, assuming responsibility for targeting America’s most critical threats while navigating the unique lifestyle that comes with such a high-powered job.\n\nHarbour will join the series as David Patrick, the chief of staff who is primarily concerned with the political ramifications of the president’s actions. A James Carville/Karl Rove type, he’s loyal and committed to doing all the dirty work and back-room bargaining necessary to facilitate the president’s agenda.\n\nHe joins a cast that also includes Cliff Chamberlain, Adam Kaufman, Sheila Vand, Tommy Savas, Leslie Odom Jr. and Farshad Farahat. Ed Bernero is showrunner.\n\nRepped by ICM Partners, Authentic Talent & Literary and Peikoff Mahan, Harbour can currently be seen on WGN America’s Manhattan. He’ll next appear in Warner Bros.’ untitled Whitey Bulger feature and will return for the final season of HBO’s The Newsroom.\n\nState of Affairs premieres Monday, Nov. 17 at 10 p.m. on NBC."
