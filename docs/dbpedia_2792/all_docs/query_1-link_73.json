        "text": "Welcome to Fund This, a new column here at Tubefilter. Each week, we’ll look at a planned web series or other online video project currently in search of funding on Kickstarter, Indiegogo, or any other similar crowdfunding sites. We’ll tell you what the series is all about and explain why it is worth your money. Do you have a project that’s currently being crowdfunded? Contact us to let us know and we may feature it in upcoming installments and check out previous installments right here.\n\nSeries Name: Bad Roomies\n\nAsking For: $75,000 on Kickstarter\n\nSubscribe to get the latest creator news\n\nSubscribe\n\nAmount Raised Thus Far (At Time Of Post): $15,112\n\nDays Remaining In Campaign (At Time Of Post): 18\n\nDescription: Bad Roomies is a planned feature film about two roommates, played by Patrick Renna and Tommy Savas, whose lives are perfectly normal–until their third roommate dies. The ultimately settle on a new third wheel, a “sexy” and “conniving” woman played by Lindsey Reckis of Reckless Tortuga, which sets a madcap screwball comedy in motion.\n\nCreator Bio: Renna and Savas are both fringe Hollywood guys who have had numerous roles in film and TV. Savas is also a regular performer on Reckless Tortuga, and the YouTube sketch channel is on board for Bad Roomies. In addition to Reckis, Eric Pumphrey will also have a role, and Jason Schnell will serve as the director.\n\nBest Perk: Renna is probably best known for playing Hamilton Porter in The Sandlot, and for $150, he will sign a baseball for you and send nostalgia flowing down your spine.\n\nWhy You Should Fund It: Did we mention that this is a joint production between Hamilton from The Sandlot and Reckless Tortuga? Because that should be reason enough to fund it right there. But if that doesn’t convince you, a recent short starring the film’s cast (and featuring a guest appearance from Tom of The Syndicate Project) gives us an introduction to the characters and the tone."
