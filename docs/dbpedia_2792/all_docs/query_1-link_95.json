The crew of a naval destroyer is forced to confront the reality of a new existence when a pandemic kills off most of the earth’s population. After a global pandemic wipes out 80 percent of the world’s population, the crew of lone unaffected U.S. Navy ship, (guided missile destroyer), the fictional USS Nathan James (DDG-151), must try to find a cure and stop the virus in order to save humanity.\n\nFollow us on https://www.Twitter.com/AfterBuzzTV\n\n“Like” Us on https://www.Facebook.com/AfterBuzzTV"
