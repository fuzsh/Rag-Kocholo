        "text": "Any contrived live-or-die situation (especially a game-style scenario such as The Running Man) immediately captures my interest. Would You Rather is a fairly self-explanatory plot. You should know what you are getting: several characters will die and most are the direct result of someone’s choice.\n\nThis movie provides a Saw-level vibe that is mysterious and intensely dangerous.\n\nIf you don’t like this type of movie, then prepare to have this horrified expression.\n\nBrittany Snow brings a warm presence to the screen as her character, Iris—caretaker for her sick brother and gravely desperate to do anything to help him. Lawrence Gilliard Jr. makes a cameo as Dr. Barden who treats Iris’ brother and also introduces her to an odd, off-putting rich guy that can offer Iris the help her brother needs. Wisely, she doesn’t really trust the offer (at first, anyways) to a dinner and game where she can compete to win the treatment for her brother. You should never trust D’Angelo Barksdale.\n\nAfter initially disposes of the invite, Iris reluctantly decides the game is her only option.\n\nThe dinner and festivities take place at the luxurious palace of Evil McPrick—played by Jeffrey Combs. The character’s actual name is the slightly less ridiculous Shepard Lambrick. Drink in that mustache.\n\nImmediately, Iris is introduced to Lambrick’s son, Julian—played exquisitely by Robin Lord Taylor. I would have hightailed it because Robin Lord Taylor gives me the heebie jeebies. Unfortunately, Iris is in too deep and has the proper motivation to move forward. There is no changing her mind.\n\nThe evening starts with an introductory dinner where you’re exposed to a cast of characters. Our contestants include Cal (played by Eddie Steeples, popularly known as Crabman from My Name Is Earl), alcoholic Conway (played by John Heard), war veteran Travis (played by Charlie Hofheimer), paralyzed old lady Linda (played by June Squibb from recent Oscar nominee Nebraska), gambling addict Peter (played by Robb Wells), Lucas (played by Enver Gjokaj), and Amy (played by former porn star Sasha Grey). Each character has their own motivations. Naturally, some are selfish and some are selfless.\n\nThe dinner provides a taste of what’s to come in the main course. Iris is offered $10,000 to break her vegetarian ways by eating meat, which she chokes down for the reward. Recovering alcoholic Conway is presented with a much darker decision: $10,000 to drink a glass of wine or $50,000 for a decanter of scotch. Although he loathes himself for taking a sip of what has nearly ruined his life, Conway takes the decanter and wallows in self-pity while taking belts of the scotch. We’re only just getting started.\n\nAfter explaining the rules of the “Would You Rather?” game, ol’ Shep Lambrick allows his guests one last chance to leave. Now or never, there’s no looking back. Predictably, none of the guests leave.\n\nSomehow, these fucks don’t quite understand what danger is now clear and present.\n\nA strange dinner game turns sinister in an instant. Let the games begin.\n\nWould You Rather is a thrilling horror movie that features some sick and twisted turns as each person’s base instincts of survival are tested against their compassion for fellow human beings. The game keeps the story moving, but the movie slows its pace in the transition from the second into the third act. In a sense, this is an interesting scenario to imagine how you would react to the proceedings.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, Would You Rather does devolve into torture porn to an extent. However, there’s enough eccentricity and dark humor to avoid being overwhelmed by the violence. I can recommend this movie because the story provides enough support to transcend the guts and gore. It’s still not for everyone, but horror fans have to slog through seemingly endless piles of shit to discover a rare nugget to enjoy. With decent writing, solid acting, and life-threatening decisions, Would You Rather is a brutal, bloody gauntlet where even the winner of the game doesn’t feel like much of a success.\n\nGive this streaming (on Netflix) addition to the horror genre a chance. I hope you wouldn’t make some of the same dumb decisions that put these characters in this position in the first place.\n\nBut at least there’s a certain sick, disturbing delight that can be taken into thinking about what you would or could endure in order to set yourself up for the rest of your life. What would you do?\n\n3.5 out of 5 stars\n\nAnswering a Craigslist ad is a premise that opens the door to a world of possibilities.\n\nI can’t fathom a more fitting title to this movie than Creep. It delivers the creeps.\n\nI still have that creepy, crawly sensation on my skin. Creep is written by the co-stars and directed by the co-star who serves as our POV-cameraman, Aaron—played by Patrick Brice. But the real star is the creep, Josef—played by Mark Duplass. You’ve probably noticed Mark Duplass in something before. Most would identify him from the TV show The League or another character in a comedic venture.\n\nI admit, I did not know Mark Duplass had acting chops. The reason this movie works is the performance of Mark Duplass. He’s likable, but his nice nature is cloying and annoying. You’re never quite sure what the hell is going on with Josef. Aaron answers Josef’s Craigslist ad for a videographer, which is revealed to be recording videos for Josef’s unborn son because Josef has a terminal illness and won’t be able to see him grow up. This is familiar territory, but Creep shows us this trope in a different, darker light.\n\nLike with any real good horror movie, there are some nice instances of dark humor in Creep.\n\nI will never be able to scrub Peachfuzz from my brain. It still feels dirty.\n\nCurrently streaming on Netflix, you could do a lot worse in terms of horror movies this October. Creep doesn’t overstay its welcome with a scant 77-minute runtime, which is always nice with this genre. Less is more. Creep is a tolerable slow burn, but the third act seems longer than it is because of the writing.\n\nI can’t say too much about Creep without spoiling anything as the journey is the experience.\n\nAt times, you will feel very uncomfortable—awkwardness is abound. But there’s an underlying tension with the interactions between Aaron and Josef. Even upon repeated viewings, I found those personal scenes to be both endearing and exceedingly weird. Man, Josef is a weird fuck and unapologetically close.\n\nWhile Creep is targeted more towards the horror audience, the heart of the movie is the relationship of the only two characters who appear on the screen. Until the very end, you are on the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen. The palpable creepiness would have been enough for me to bail early. All warm, fuzzy feelings would be left aside about helping this dying man. But I’m a person who actually cringes whenever I watch a genuinely awkward encounter in a movie or on TV.\n\nThe Peachfuzz mask is enough by itself to induce nightmares. And then the dancing. Oh, the horror.\n\nWill Peachfuzz ever stop haunting me?\n\n3.5 out of 5 stars\n\nAll I needed to hear from The Film Vault was that there’s a foreign movie about a dog uprising.\n\nSOLD! That tasty tease was enough for me to immediately add White God to my queue on Netflix. One of the many reasons I love the movie podcast The Film Vault is because I find out about these gems. You have never seen anything like White God before, which should be enough to sell you as well.\n\nHowever, White God opens with an annoying pet peeve of mine by flashing forward—basically to the end of the second act. In this case, I believe that choice is made because the director wants to reassure you that the movie is going somewhere. I can understand it to an extent since this is a very hard watch. The entire first act of White God is brutality befalling a poor innocent dog who is thrown out on the streets for no fault of his own. Although the opening shades everything you see in that light, it’s not the worst setup for this movie given the difficult nature of seeing an animal abused by nearly everyone except the girl.\n\nAt its core, White God is a movie about a girl and her dog.\n\nThe girl is Lili—played by Zsofia Psotta. I can’t overstate how great this little girl is in White God. As the single sympathetic human being, Zsofia carries the movie in every non-dog scene. She’s adorable and is astounding in how well she personifies the character. You feel her love for the dog, which only makes everything more heartbreaking. Everyone else is an asshole and deserves their comeuppance.\n\nThe dog is Hagen. And Hagen will steal your heart. He stole mine, that’s for sure.\n\nI don’t know how you get a dog to act. Creative editing has a lot to do with it, but there are reaction shots of Hagen and other dogs—particularly his little partner in crime—that overwhelm you with emotion.\n\nIt is a phenomenal accomplishment for writer/director Kornel Mundruczo.\n\nWhite God is a foreign film that was the Hungarian entry (though not nominated) for last year’s Oscars in the Best Foreign Film category. Aside from Wild Tales, I would probably say White God is better than the rest of the actual nominees. This is a very ambitious film that has some depth touching upon class and cultural issues. While it delves into the absurd at time, this is a very harsh look at how we treat others. Humans and animals alike, everyone looks down upon those on the streets.\n\nIn this movie, the country is overrun by wild, unwanted dogs.\n\nOf course, they are unwanted because they aren’t pure. A heavy “mongrel” fine has been imposed by the government, and people are encouraged to report anyone who has a mixed-breed dog. There’s a cavalcade of evil, mostly nameless faces in White Dog. The government, dog-catchers, dog-fighters, dog pound, a homeless man, and even Lili’s music teacher are all absolute assholes in this situation.\n\nArguably, the worst villain in this situation is Lili’s father, Daniel—played by Sandor Zsoter. Daniel doesn’t directly inflict the most despicable damage on Hagen, but he makes it all possible and he’s the one who causes the most harm to his own daughter with his dickish indifference. Lili’s parents are divorced and her mom is leaving on a trip, which is why she is staying with her dad in the first place.\n\nHis nosey neighbor reports Hagen and Daniel refuses to pay the “mongrel” fine, which leads him to just letting Hagen loose in the middle of the fucking street. It’s a sickening exchange to see Hagen confused and running after the car when Daniel starts to drive away. The way these shots are presented is hauntingly beautiful. The transformation of Hagen will be forever emblazoned in my brain.\n\nWhite God is far from perfect, but it is a movie that I will never forget.\n\nLarge, coordinated packs of dogs are running wild through empty streets in the second half of this movie. Managing to film coherent scenes that rely solely on the actions and movements of these dogs is a phenomenal achievement. When the movie finally catches up to the flash forward shown in the opening, all hell is breaking loose and it builds tension to set up a terrific ending with everything at stake.\n\nWhite God isn’t the easy viewing experience, but this is a movie that deserves your attention.\n\n3.5 out of 5 stars\n\nLook at the poster and treasure it because that’s better than anything in this movie.\n\nCooties is a massive disappointment on so many levels.\n\nI was eagerly anticipating the release of Cooties, a zombie horror comedy set in a school where the children are the zombies. Even if the zombie genre has you sick and tired (and running a fever and stumbling around looking for brains), you have to admit that is a promising premise. Fruitful ground to explore ways to bend the genre and bring something new to the table. No such thing occurs in Cooties.\n\nI regretfully inform you that this movie is boring and forgettable.\n\nNot living up to my expectations isn’t such a horrific offense, but Cooties fails to meet any expectations or self-imposed standards. Although there are laughs and worthwhile moments, those scenes are few and far between—practically buried under a mountain of shit that not even Andy Dufresne could crawl through. So many gags or intended jokes fell flat. Sadly, this is a run-of-the-mill movie.\n\nThe story of a zombie outbreak is a horror comedy doesn’t need to be remarkable. In this movie, it’s important only as the reasoning for why it is occurring in a school. That’s not the unpleasant part about Cooties. No, leave that load to the lead character, Clint—played by Elijah Wood doing Elijah Wood things. This annoying fuck is an aspiring horror writer and the movie tries to play up the horribleness of his writing, but it obviously feels like it is a gold mine of funny. It is not. It is obnoxious and difficult to endure.\n\nI’m not sure why you would want your main character to be so grating. Normally, I like Elijah Wood. But I wanted to watch a herd of feral zombie children feast on him in this movie. Congratulations, you made me hate Frodo. I suppose that is an accomplishment. C’mon, he’s The Good Son! As an actor, Elijah Wood is fine in Cooties. Wood wasn’t given much to work with, but he does his job delivering the sub-par material.\n\nHe doesn’t embarrass himself. If you want to see Elijah Wood embarrass himself in a horror movie, then maybe you want to watch Maniac—mostly shot from the perspective of Elijah Wood as a serial killer attacking women and fucking mannequins. On second thought, never watch that movie. Maniac is legitimately one of the worst movies I have experienced. I have no idea why Elijah Wood agreed to do that movie when he has all of that sweet Lord of the Rings money in his bank.\n\nBack to this other miserable pile of shit, the best part about Cooties was Rainn Wilson.\n\nRainn Wilson perfectly plays Wade, the dickish PE teacher reliving glory days out on the children’s playground. Wilson deserves more respect for his acting chops. At his best, Rainn toggled between serious drama and ludicrous comedy in Super (directed by James Gunn). In Cooties, Rainn Wilson goes full-bore into the role—reluctantly running through children then gleefully dispatching the zombie demon children back to hell. He is a moronic loudmouth and a great source of comic relief.\n\nWhy weren’t there more character actors cast as fellow teachers with Elijah Wood and Rainn Wilson?\n\nYou can’t convince me that this wouldn’t have been a better movie with something like a brief cameo of Betty White getting devoured by the little bloodthirsty bastards. Give me some David Koechner or Keegan-Michael Key to chew scenery. Sprinkle in Kumail Nanjiani as an uptight school administrator and you have an infinitely better movie. It seems like they may have had that intention with casting Jack McBrayer as one of the surviving teachers, Tracy. But then they gave him practically nothing to do.\n\nArguably the only other entertaining aspect of Cooties was Jorge Garcia as the crossing guard, Rick—watching the horror unfold while tripping on mushrooms in his van trying to ride out the high. Jorge Garcia is a loveable oaf and he’s a welcome break from the borefest that is this movie.\n\nI wish there was more to enjoy, but Cooties doesn’t give you much to relish during its 88 minutes. Unfortunately, the brief runtime could have been even more brisk if we’re being honest. Somehow, it still feels long as fuck. Through the first act, Cooties shows promise before completely falling apart when the children storm the school. You could probably trim the movie down to 70 or so minutes by cutting the characters themselves discovering the spread of the outbreak and subsequent tacked-on ending. It certainly could not have made the movie any worse. This is a cringe-worthy experience.\n\nIn retrospect, I was hoping for too much from Cooties. I wanted a goofier Faculty-esque fun horror with zombie children causing chaos. After grinding to a halt in the second act, the only thing I was eagerly anticipating was the merciful end. Cooties is the equivalent of a comedian laughing at his own jokes.\n\nWhen people complain about the oversaturation of zombies in our culture, they can now point to Cooties as a prime example. This doesn’t even qualify as beating a dead horse. The zombie herd has consumed all of the dead horse’s entrails and its corpse barely remains. Mark this down as another entry in the constantly growing, already bloated genre of horror comedy genre. No one can compete with Shaun of the Dead so we should all stop trying if it’s just a rehash of the same shit we’ve seen a thousand times over.\n\nThe worst crime of Cooties is that is simply an exercise in going through the awkward motions.\n\n1.5 out of 5 stars\n\nM. Night Shyamalan the director probably gets too much shit from the general public.\n\nM. Night Shyamalan the writer wholeheartedly deserves everything thrown at his head.\n\nThe Village and Lady in the Water were ungood. I can’t force myself to watch The Last Airbender or After Earth. But until my last breath, I will defend The Happening. Those who attempt to categorize The Happening as one of the worst movies ever made have no sense of fun and need to stop taking themselves too serious. The Happening was definitely dumb, but it managed to be entertaining.\n\nThe fatal flaw with The Happening was casting Mark Wahlberg as someone with a shred of intelligence. Marky Mark is perfect when playing the stupid manchild who never grew up. Trying to pass Mark Wahlberg off as even a high school science teacher is an unforgivable mistake. Listening to him fumble through science speak and lecture to students about bees still makes my ears bleed. Coupling Wahlberg with Zooey Deschanel’s permanently zoned out gaze only made things worse. John Leguizamo was definitely the best actor, and I usually can’t stand his rat face. But The Happening had some haunting imagery and inventive kills that will continue to live in my brain. The unintentional comedy of the bad acting clinic by Wahlberg and Deschanel along with the sublimely ludicrous twist was entertaining.\n\nI watch so many bad movies and most are so awful that I completely forget about them.\n\nThere’s something to be said about a bad movie that’s so bad you enjoy it.\n\nThe Visit lives in a similar category for me. While a lot of people are proclaiming The Visit as M. Night Shyamalan’s best movie in years, I would continue to defend The Happening and argue that 2008 effort is better. But there are a handful of good things about The Visit that deserve attention.\n\nIn typical M. Night fashion, the directing outdoes the writing in this movie.\n\nFound footage horror movies need to die. Although there are a few rare gems, it is an outplayed gimmick that is used to compensate for a lack of skill and technique. The main character Becca—played by Olivia DeJonge—is an aspiring documentarian, which is the bullshit excuse for why this trip to see their estranged grandparents needs to be captured on film. An accomplished director such as M. Night Shyamalan shouldn’t be slumming it with shaky handheld cameras, but at least he uses the gimmick well with this movie. There’s a hide-and-go-seek scene under the porch with grandma that is especially creepy.\n\nOlivia DeJonge has impressive command and puts forth a quality performance reacting to all the odd chaos the kids encounter. While DeJonge is adorable as Becca, her likability is balanced out by her completely excruciating brother Tyler—played by Ed Oxenbould and his punchable face. I don’t know if it’s a Jack Gleeson case (Joffrey from Game of Thrones) where the young child actor is so good at portraying these awful, annoying traits that you hate him. Or maybe my visceral reaction to his voice and fivehead just conjures up rage. I was actively rooting for this character to die—at least for bad things to happen.\n\nAnd this is what I’m talking about with M. Night’s unbelievably bad writing. Tyler self-imposes the nickname T. Diamond Styles because that’s what you do when you’re an over-privileged white kid who claims to be a freestyle rapper. Instead of saying curse words, this little douchefuck says names of pop stars like Shakira and Katy Perry when he’s angry. It is as unjustifiable and terrible as it sounds.\n\nHow could you think that is a good idea? Too many confusing choices and bad ideas strewn together.\n\nThe best part of The Visit is the star, Nana—played by Deanna Dunagan. I’m not going to pretend that I’ve ever heard of Dunagan before, but she is fantastic as the creepy and ominous grandma. If you avoided the media blitz when this movie came out in theaters, then you missed an allusion to Hansel and Greta in a ridiculous yet gripping scene. Longs instances of boredom punctuated with interesting setups\n\nSeriously, there are several substantial plot holes that Shyamalan ignores or glosses over. But I’ll forgive the questionable set-up and reasoning for the titular visit. To a certain extent, the downfalls of The Visit are forgivable because of the entertainment value. Watching Deanna Dunagan lose her shit is worth the price of admission alone. However, I could do without the two (yes, two) grandma ass flash scenes.\n\nNaturally, there is a twist forced into the story. Of course, you see it coming a mile away.\n\nThe twist is telegraphed with a heavy hand in a scene very early in the movie. Although a failed twist typically dooms the movie by rendering everything before it meaningless, that’s not the case with The Visit because the build-up was the best part. Despite the movie’s flaws, feeling the creepiness of meeting the grandparents was hair-raising. While the humor elevates this movie, there are several swings and misses. I wish M. Night infused more horror into the story to the detriment of its teenager appeal. I shared a theater filled to the brim with talkative little twats who thoroughly enjoyed the rapping of T. Diamond Styles.\n\nAs with most found footage horror movies, the ending seems slapped together. Nothing egregious, but I expect better from M. Night because he made The Sixth Sense. That’s like the equivalent of Michael Jackson making Thriller. And Unbreakable is phenomenal—possibly even better than The Sixth Sense.\n\nAbout half of the movie works and the other half is excruciating. I cringed on several occasions.\n\nI won’t go as so far to say that The Visit proves M. Night Shyamalan is back.\n\nBut it was a nice enough visit with the grandparents.\n\n2.5 out of 5 stars\n\nThe Gift is impressive only in the sense that it’s written and directed by Joel Edgerton—who also co-stars opposite Jason Bateman. Do not mistake this for a good movie. The fact that The Gift shares the same score with less rotten reviews as Sicario on Rotten Tomatoes is an infuriating joke.\n\nAnd this is a prime example why a lot of critics are terrible. I’m not touting myself as anything special, but I provide my honest opinion on each movie. I don’t get that sense with some critics. Case in point, critics are inventing reasons not to like Sicario even though it is legitimately great in every facet imaginable. Meanwhile, this same crop of shitty, self-obsessed critics on Rotten Tomatoes can’t stop themselves from fawning over this mediocre movie. You’ve seen The Gift and many other similar movies before.\n\nThere is nothing special about The Gift. The script is uneventful. The acting is decent. The directing isn’t particularly noteworthy, and you can say the same thing about everything else. It is a thrilling mystery that fails to thrill or captivate with the supposed mystery. You know where this is going the whole time.\n\nOr maybe it’s just me. Perhaps I am the stale fart stench lingering in the room.\n\nIn my opinion, I think that odor is emanating from The Gift. When you build your entire movie around a twist (or series of twists), the whole set-up is rendered meaningless if the twist fails. I learned that lesson from M. Night Shyamalan movies a long time ago. This movie lost my faith long before the turn.\n\nThe Gift borders on interesting, but wanders nowhere and meanders to a semi-resolution.\n\nI don’t enjoy talking about bad movies. However, there are very few redeeming qualities and virtually nothing memorable about The Gift. One of the best parts of this movie is Jason Bateman’s performance as Simon. Bateman lays it on thick with his character’s dickish nature, but I still found him more likeable than Gordo—played by writer/director Joel Edgerton. Gordo is an annoying oddball.\n\nThe unraveling is unsatisfying, and the story lazily ventures into a routine damsel in distress rut. The Gift is essentially an uncomfortable pissing contest between two pricks. Simon’s wife, Robyn—played by Rebecca Hall—is the only person nice to Gordo, but she becomes a way to hurt Simon. A means to an end. I’m sure that made feminists real happy that the woman is a pawn in a man’s game. I don’t care about that, but Rebecca Hall was just the worst and easily the weak link in terms of performances.\n\nWhy hurt or even threaten to hurt the one caring, compassionate person?\n\nI imagine the intention of Edgerton was to create an ambiguous moral play. However, the character decisions are stupefying and downright dumb at times. Although I feel like the adoration is undeserved, clearly The Gift has found an audience. This movie is not in the same stratosphere as Sicario.\n\nIf you like run-of-the-mill horror mysteries, then by all means enjoy the bland, flavorless taste of The Gift. I don’t want to mimic the long, drawn-out proceedings of The Gift so I’ll just say you can find a better movie. The aforementioned M. Night Shyamalan’s The Visit is flawed in its own manner yet mildly better and considerably more entertaining than this joyless romp that gave me no gift.\n\nJoel Edgerton shows that he’s capable with The Gift—more importantly, capable of better.\n\n2 out of 5 stars\n\nHoly fuck. Those are the only two words that will come out of your mouth after watching Sicario. An early favorite for Best Picture at the Oscars, Sicario is well-crafted with amazing acting performances from Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro, and Josh Brolin. If there’s a better movie coming out later this year, I can only imagine it being double the pleasure, double the fun with Tom Hardy playing twins in Legend.\n\nCalling Sicario a tense action thriller is an understatement.\n\nMy breath was hastened. There was a weight on my chest. Sprawled out in a cozy recliner, I squirmed around uncomfortably. This fucking movie gave me anxiety. Trust me, I’m familiar with the feeling. Somehow, merely driving through the streets into Mexico and back across the border managed to become insanely intense. No need to fret, there’s a payoff for all that fierce tension too.\n\nFrom the very first scene—a raid on a suburban home in Chandler, AZ—you know you are in for a ride. It is bumpy and uncomfortable at times. The stakes are established early. This is the war on drugs where raids and busts are simply scratching the surface. But be careful of what you might find when you go deeper. This is awful people doing awful things—the stuff white of people’s nightmares.\n\nA veritable game of chess, the important pieces like kings and queens are kept out of sight. For the most part, everyone we see are pawns in one army or another. On the American side, there are Department of Justice advisors Matt Graver (played by Josh Brolin) and his mysterious partner Alejandro (played by Benicio Del Toro). However, the audience experiences the action through the eyes of FBI agent Kate Macer (played by Emily Blunt). Just like Kate, we’re along for the ride through this hellscape.\n\nEmily Blunt is predictably fantastic, which you should expect if you watched her in Looper and Edge of Tomorrow. You see Blunt’s vulnerability and feel her emotional state deteriorate the deeper they delve into the business of the drug trade. Any normal person would have broken down a long time ago.\n\nIn my own personal game of recognizing actors from my favorite TV shows, Jon Bernthal (Shane from The Walking Dead) pops up in an extended cameo. As usual, Bernthal is just grand and he brought more to the role than the flat character that was written on paper. From the Fifteen Million Merits episode of Black Mirror, Daniel Kaluuya plays Reggie Wayne, friend of Kate and fellow FBI agent. Kaluuya is surprisingly enjoyable as the skeptic. The supporting cast elevates the content even in mundane scenes.\n\nWith such an incredibly well-rounded movie, even the cinematography demands your attention with its dramatic presence. I live in Arizona and the only Southwestern landscape that I find breathtaking is the red rocks of Sedona. But the wide angle shots of the desert and barren wasteland along the border are beautiful in this movie. The framing of several scenes depicts a strong sense of foreboding.\n\nThe doom is impending for a reason. And it is always inevitable.\n\nSooner or later, it all catches up to you. The river of shit is unavoidable. In a sense, that’s a recurring theme in Sicario. Although Emily Blunt’s character Kate wants maintain her moral compass, it’s hard not to spin out of control when you realize that the most effective response to terror is terror. Hidden bodies in a suburban home is just the beginning. Moving beyond the surface only reveals more evil. The water in the deep end is dark and murky. While everyone else is doing whatever necessary to get the job done, all Kate wants to do is follow procedure. In this world, following procedure will get you killed.\n\nSicario is sick and twisted, but it is wisely infused with some levity.\n\nJosh Brolin’s character Matt Graver is shockingly humorous with his dickish persona. You never quite trust him, but he still comes off as likeable. Benicio Del Toro is sneaky great with a raw, mysterious performance. Everything—writing, casting, acting, directing—works together harmoniously. The score made my heart pound during the right moments. At this point, I’ve only watched Sicario once, but it won’t stay that way for long. I look forward to uncovering more nuances in future viewings. Sicario doesn’t have the same philosophical underpinnings as No Country for Old Men, but it belongs in the same stratosphere of great movies. Director Denis Villeneuve has a phenomenal piece of art here with Sicario.\n\nExpect Sicario to at least garner Oscar nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Director, and Best Picture this year. Emily Blunt could be in the competition for Best Actress and there are other fitting categories as well. Sicario excels by giving its stars the room to breathe in their roles.\n\nIf Sicario is any indication, the war on drugs is an unbreakable cycle of horror. There’s no winning. We are all losers in this game. You might want to take a shower after this cinematic experience.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nThe opening montage of Chappie appropriately sets the stage by introducing the audience to the new robotic police force that is tasked with cleaning up the rampant crime in Johannesburg, South Africa. If you watched District 9, the faux documentarian approach employed early on is familiar territory.\n\nWhile effective, it’s indicative of the movie as a whole and writer-director Neill Blomkamp’s work.\n\nBy now, we’ve all grown accustomed to the imagery.\n\nThe look and feel of District 9, Elysium, and Chappie are mostly the same. South Africa is a horrifyingly beautiful place stricken with poverty and blessed with pretty landscapes. I can certainly understand why Blomkamp is comfortable with using his home country of South Africa as a foundation for his movies. But people have reached a point where they want more diversity discovering new stories.\n\nAlthough Chappie isn’t necessarily groundbreaking, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.\n\nUnfortunately, Chappie didn’t seem to find its audience here domestically. An early release in March seemed like odd timing as Chappie feels like it should have been closer to the string of summer releases—somewhere around late April/early May or at the tail-end of blockbuster season near August. Both District 9 (2009) and Elysium (2013) were August releases. Pure armchair speculation, but those studio decisions are typically indicative of their own opinions on the movie.\n\nMaybe they were right, to an extent. Disclaimer: Chappie is not for everyone. And that’s fine.\n\nThis is not a movie that would likely sit well with test audiences. I can understand why studio executives wouldn’t get it either. Squares in suits with ties cinched around their necks are not going to enjoy Chappie. Clearly, this movie is intended for Blomkamp’s well-carved out niche audience. I count myself amongst them. Chappie is dumb, entertaining fun with a heart. Do not try to think too much or else the plot holes will hurt your brain. If you want a thinking man’s movie about artificial intelligence, then watch the terrific acting performances of Oscar Isaac and Domhnall Gleeson in Ex Machina. Both of these movies are great in their own right, just in different ways. Ex Machina should be an Oscar contender in some respect.\n\nThat’s right, I think Chappie is great. And that’s not because of Hugh Jackman, Dev Patel, or Sigourney Weaver. While I enjoy Ripley as much as the next person (and we can probably credit Chappie for the eventual creation of the next Alien movie), Sigourney Weaver was wholly useless in this movie. It wasn’t her fault, but that role of Tetravaal CEO was so bland that literally any man or woman could have filled out. That was a bit of a disappointment. Dev Patel was solid yet unspectacular as Deon, the genius inventor of the robotic police force. A number of actors could have done as serviceable of a job as Slumdog Millionaire. Hugh Jackman was delightful as the prickish, jealous ex-military co-worker of Deon who wants to watch the world burn if it means his massive remote controlled MOOSE robot can come in and wreck shit. His haircut was ridiculous and Jackman seemed to revel in the freedom of the role.\n\nSharlto Copley deserves immense praise for giving life to Chappie—both voice and motion-capture. At several points, I had to remind myself that it was the same person that played the lead in District 9 and was relatively terrifying as Kruger in Elysium. Copley bring a humanity to Chappie that I didn’t expect. There’s one particularly heart-wrenching scene where Chappie is in danger in the slums of Johannesburg while still trying to understand the world. Copley captures the spirit of every situation perfectly.\n\nBut no, none of these actors are the highlight of the film. I feel confident in saying that whether or not you like Chappie hinges on what you think about the gangsters Ninja and Yo-Landi.\n\nIf the purpose of Chappie was to thrust Die Antwoord on the American populous, then I consider Chappie to be a resounding success. Ninja and Yo-Landi stole this movie and made it entertaining. Die Antwoord is interwoven into the fabric of Chappie—this movie couldn’t work without them. Several production sets are clearly from Die Antwoord’s music videos, which brings an awesome sense of surrealism. Die Antwoord’s music is dropped in at perfect, opportune moments to add some levity and zef style.\n\nIt’s been six months now and I’ve watched Chappie on three separate occasions.\n\nI still haven’t escaped the rabbit hole that is South African rap group Die Antwoord’s ridiculous music. Such classics as Cookie Thumper!, Enter The Ninja, Fatty Boom Boom, Happy Go Sucky Fucky, I Fink U Freeky, Raging Zef Boner, and Strunk. And I hate almost every electronic dance music song I’ve ever heard. But the fat beats and zef raps of Die Antwoord will seep into your brain and infect you.\n\nIn Chappie, the gangster duo of Ninja and Yo-Landi are accompanied by Amerika—their Yankee cohort played by Jose Pablo Cantillo, best known as Martinez in his run on The Walking Dead. Chappie has a limited story, which is set into motion by these lovable gangsters needing to pay off a $20 million debt in a week to the not-so-lovable Hippo—a steroid freak with a hilarious haircut played by Brandon Auret. I think Auret is a weak link in a very good cast, but he serves as an imposing figure in his few scenes.\n\nI was shocked that I enjoyed Chappie as much as I did. Several people were probably turned off by a shitting marketing campaign, but this movie deserves better. Blomkamp apparently already has a trilogy planned out, it seems completely unnecessary in terms of pure storytelling. While the foreign market at least balanced the budget, Chappie probably isn’t long for a sequel. And that’s fine.\n\nAlthough I truly hope Blomkamp’s contribution to the Alien franchise comes to fruition, I don’t want to see Blomkamp return to any of his works. We’re done with the world of Chappie. The story comes to a nice resolution that we don’t need to revisit. It’s time to move along to a new story and different world.\n\nDie Antwoord made this movie with real, human performances that I connected with—surprisingly enough. It seems unlikely that Chappie even got off the ground with the unknown rap duo practically starring with more screen time than Hugh Jackman. You can see that Blomkamp leaves a window open with the ending that he could squeeze through for a sequel, but let’s just close that shut now.\n\nWhile this movie is nowhere near Oscar-worthy in any category, Chappie is great in its own right. It’s much more entertaining than it had any right being. With an odd blend of charisma and panache injected by Die Antwoord, Chappie manages to be unique—something all movies should strive toward.\n\nGive Chappie a chance. Maybe it won’t touch your heart, but you should enjoy the ride regardless.\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nNever has a movie been more aptly named than Trainwreck.\n\nWritten by first-time screenwriter Amy Schumer and directed by Judd Apatow, this movie had everything working against it from the start. Trainwreck deserves to have the Spike Lee-esque treatment of “An Amy Schumer Abortion” tagline in the opening credits. Known for her raunchy style of comedy, Trainwreck delivers heaps of cringe-worthy dialogue and adolescent sexual content intended as shock value. Rest assured, the only shocking part of Trainwreck is the utter lack of humor and absence of wit.\n\nWho actually enjoys this movie?\n\nEven Amy Schumer fans should be ashamed to find this funny. This isn’t coming from a place of malice. I don’t hate Amy Schumer. I like her personality and she blossomed on the Comedy Central Roasts. However, I don’t care for most of her stand-up comedy because her material is heavily reliant on hacky sex jokes about her slutty behavior. Some seemingly find that funny because it’s coming from a woman.\n\nI am not among those people. I find female comedians funny in the same manner as I find male comedians funny—relatable observations/commentary on life with quality writing and comedic timing. Kathleen Madigan is one of the best working stand-up comedians regardless of gender. Amy Schumer is capable of being funny. But the awful writing displayed in Trainwreck is downright unforgivable at most times.\n\nMy issue with Trainwreck isn’t specifically Amy Schumer. This movie would have been the same pile of garbage regardless of the female lead. But Schumer does bear the biggest burden of responsibility as the writer with an abysmal attempt at humor. Judd Apatow made things worse by getting his greasy mitts involved shoving cameo after cameo down the gullet of the audience. I can only describe this baffling decision as desperately trying to distract the audience. The end-result is a forgettable string of athletes and actual actors popping in for meaningless moments. Just tell me Tony Romo had to pay for his role.\n\nDon’t worry, Trainwreck has plenty more where that came from—you can rely on Apatow to go to the well early and often. I have read and heard from several people praising Amy Schumer’s performance. I must have watched a different movie. Amy Schumer did not exactly stretch her acting wings as Amy, a drunk slut who somehow coasts through life. Amy Schumer wishes this was on the same level of non-acting as Courtney Love playing a strung-out whore. To her credit, Amy surprisingly doesn’t fuck up her one dramatic scene. The rest of the time, she’s a mess failing to deliver the clunky lines she wrote.\n\nNo humor shines through this slog of a movie. Getting through it felt like homework.\n\nI’m not going out on a limb saying no one should ever go shooting up innocent people in public. Leave my theater-going experience alone. Unless it involves people talking during the movie, the theater is my last bastion of salvation away from the miserable world. But if there is a silver-lining to be found in being shot after the first 15 minutes of Trainwreck…at least you aren’t subjected to hearing John Cena’s grunting and seeing his bare ass. Seriously, John Cena’s acting ability breaks new ground in dreadfulness.\n\nI would do anything to scrub my brain clean from John Cena’s residue.\n\nWhy was John Cena cast as Amy Schumer’s on-again, off-again boyfriend?\n\nDid Judd Apatow Amy Schumer’s non-acting necessitate using other non-actors?\n\nI admit, John Cena was so distractingly bad that I wasn’t even paying attention to Amy Schumer. Poor Bill Hader had to carry LeBron James and Amar’e Stoudemire on his back in addition to playing the straight guy against Schumer’s goofy, aloof character. Colin Quinn’s performance is the only positive result of this mind-numbing casting approach. After so many years of catching grief from fellow comedians on Tough Crowd for mumbling and bumbling through jokes, Colin Quinn delivers the best lines and is endearing in dramatic spurts despite playing a complete asshole. While Quinn was interesting and enjoyable as an old curmudgeon, the novelty of comedian cameos runs thin despite my urge to name faces—Mike Birbiglia, Dave Attell, Jim Florentine, Bobby Kelly, Keith Robinson, Nikki Glaser, and Kyle Dunnigan.\n\nWith very few genuinely funny moments (nothing besides Colin Quinn’s Babe Ruth rant comes to mind), Trainwreck is an unmemorable misfire in a bland movie genre. At least Matthew McConaughey’s romantic comedies were watchable. Somehow, the hype surrounding the movie pre-determined that this would be the breakout summer hit. Amy Schumer might be able to write a good movie. Trainwreck is not that movie. Hopefully she will write and appear in a supporting role rather than star as the lead. Judging by Trainwreck, I’m fairly confident in characterizing Amy Schumer charisma-free as an actress. Room for growth is only possible if Schumer moves past the sophomoric approach to lowest common denominator humor.\n\nThis shit wasn’t funny when it was Dane Cook in Good Luck Chuck.\n\nTime will tell if Amy Schumer’s skyrocketing career will similarly plummet like Dane Cook and dovetail into oblivion—at least in terms of mass appeal and critical success. If Schumer intends to stick to the “mostly sex stuff” shtick, then this same annoying approach will wear down the goodwill Amy Schumer has built by seeming to be a real, genuine human being. That’s not enough to get me to like this movie.\n\nShort on comedy and long on pseudo-romance that no one cares about, Trainwreck is the worst non-Adam Sandler movie I’ve had the misfortune of watching this summer. Don’t trust anyone who likes Trainwreck because it’s most likely a sign of shitty taste in movies. Avoid unless you like throwing up in your mouth. If you have managed to ignore this movie, rejoice and celebrate the continued accomplishment.\n\n1 out of 5 stars\n\nMad Max: Fury Road is almost too good to be real.\n\nThe confluence of events that finally led to the creation of this movie is unthinkable. Stuck in development hell for 15 years or so, there was legitimate concern that another Mad Max installment would never see the light of day. The Iraq War and Mel Gibson’s various racist incidents nearly signaled the end.\n\nSomehow, George Miller persevered and his vision eventually came into existence. In this age, it is hard to believe a major movie studio would entrust a director with total creative control—especially after so much pre-production chaos and controversy. Thankfully, George Miller was up to the task and potentially daunting responsibility. The end-result surpassed even the loftiest expectations.\n\nAt this point, I’m so late to the game that you’ve probably heard the bountiful praise heaped upon this movie by now. It’s not for lack of interest as I was in the seats the first night to watch Mad Max: Fury Road. And then I went back the next night. In terms of re-watchability, you can’t find a better film.\n\nDon’t be skeptical. Leave behind your cynical bullshit and be prepared to have your face melted.\n\nBelieve the hype. Immerse yourself in the desolate hellscape and revel in the spectacle.\n\nSummer blockbusters don’t deserve to be in the same category as Mad Max: Fury Road. While some people have mischaracterized it as a nonstop chase sequence, the pacing deliberately stops to inhale the dust while delivering more than enough action. Unlike most movies of this ilk, the action works because you care and feel some investment in the characters. The intensity cannot be manufactured. Utilizing practical effects rather than over-reliance on CGI, the audience is allowed to experience the gravity of situations instead of being hurled around in a whirlwind of flying metal like Michael Bay movies.\n\nWith top-notch performances from Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, and Hugh Keays-Byrne in the supporting cast, there isn’t a weak link anywhere in the chain. The good vs. evil dynamic is only as strong as the villain. Despite a mysterious rise to power, Hugh Keays-Byrne’s run as Immortan Joe is as awesomely badass. While oppressively evil, Immortan Joe’s stranglehold over his domain is tenuous due to his deteriorating physical condition. It has all the makings of an iconic, memorable movie.\n\nIn short: if you don’t like Mad Max, go fuck yourself.\n\nWe don’t need to be friends. It sounds snobby and condescending, but you just don’t get it if you are unable to enjoy this movie. I’m not saying you are an idiot if you don’t like Mad Max: Fury Road. However, you are much more likely to be an idiot if you hate this movie. Surprisingly, this is a rare mass appeal action spectacle that satisfies the senses with ample support from a simple yet interesting story.\n\nMad Max isn’t flawless, but it doesn’t have to be pristine. This movie embraces and celebrates its warts—quite literally in the case of certain characters. Mad Max: Fury Road is perfectly imperfect.\n\nThe big swinging balls of George Miller are inescapable. Not only is the titular character turned into a prisoner, but almost all of his face is obscured by a bulky metal mask. While Max is relegated to an object of the plot rather than the driving force, the de facto lead, Charlize Theron—one of Hollywood’s most gorgeous actresses—has her head shaved bald and a mechanical arm replacing her amputated stump.\n\nFor the purpose of this story, there’s no reason Mel Gibson couldn’t have returned as Mad Max. As much as I love Tom Hardy, it would have been nice to see people finally forgive and re-embrace Mel Gibson. Mad Max: Fury Road could have launched a new beginning for that lovable old racist kook.\n\nMel Gibson’s loss is Tom Hardy’s gain. The acting ability of Tom Hardy is unquestioned, but big screen success has eluded him up until this point. Thanks to the overwhelming positive reception of Mad Max: Fury Road, every door in Hollywood should be gaping open in eager anticipation of Tom Hardy. Not only can he carry a small independent film like Locke where he is the only character on-screen, but he also has the charisma to lead a major motion picture. I want and need more Tom Hardy in my life.\n\nThe brilliance of George Miller is palpable and abound in this madness. Mad Max: Fury Road is everything you can imagine in a massive, mindless action movie while still managing to bring something new to the table. Likely to be often emulated but never duplicated, Mad Max: Fury Road has already spawned a life of its own and hopefully future installments don’t shit all over this beautiful foundation.\n\nBasically, this movie is the anti-Waterworld.\n\nBask in its eternal glory—shiny and chrome.\n\n5 out of 5 stars"
