        "text": "Please share a memory of Mary to include in a keepsake book for family and friends.\n\nMary Margaret Patten, \"Nana\", of Manalapan, passed away at CentraState Medical Center in Freehold on Sunday, at the age of 100. From the time of her birth in Brooklyn on March 4, 1918, Nana was loved by her very large and lively family and numerous friends. She was born in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, to Margaret (Leahy) and James McDonald, where she lived with them and her younger brother, John, before settling in Manalapan 52 years ago. Nana was always extremely active, even to her final hours. All were in awe when she danced at her 100th birthday party, this past March. She loved her children, grandchildren and twenty-one great grandchildren, all of whom have heard her sing the \"La La Song\". Before her career as an administrator for ASCAP in New York City, Nana was a model and an art student. She continued as an amateur painter and was also a talented seamstress, creating everything from Halloween costumes to a wedding gown and also upholstering her own furniture. Nana will forever be remembered for her interesting clich√©s, her crushes on John Wayne and Chuck Norris, and especially her love of animals, as Nana brought every type of pet into the family. Mary was predeceased by her husband, Thomas Patten of Achill, Ireland, and her brother, John McDonald. She is survived by her daughter Margaret Lombardo; son James Patten and his wife Judith; nephew Gerard McDonald; grandchildren MaryBeth Savas (Paul), Robert Lombardo (Barbara), Donald Lombardo (Renee), Leanne Clary (Tom) and Joyce Lombardo. Also her 21 great-grandchildren, Colton & Caelie Cummings, Michael, Jack, Lauren, Kyle & Jason Savas, Connor Lombardo, Kaitlynn & Erin Schweizer, Skye & Sam Lombardo, Colleen, Quinn, Nathaniel & Viviana Clary, Ryan, Bailey, Thomas, Meghan & Madelyn Moncrief. Friends are invited to gather on Thursday and Friday, August 2 & 3, 2018 from 3:00 pm - 5:00 pm & 7:00 pm - 9:00 pm at the Freeman Funeral Home located at 344 Route 9 North, Manalapan. A mass will be held on Saturday, August 4, 2018 at 10:00 am at St. Thomas More Church, Manalapan, NJ. Entombment will follow at St. Rose of Lima Mausoleum, Freehold, NJ.
