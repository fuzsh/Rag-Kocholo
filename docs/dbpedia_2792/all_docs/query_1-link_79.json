        "text": "By Alice L. And Greg E. Luckhardt\n\nTwo very popular establishments in Martin County, owned at different times by the same partners, Stanley \"Stan\" Mistura and William \"Bill\" Bass, were the Blue Goose Bar & Grill and the Pink Pony Restaurant. The establishment that would eventually be known as the \"Blue Goose\" was situated on a relatively undeveloped section of the highway north of Stuart on land once owned by Lilly Sherman before purchase by the Wilkinsons and later, George Fuller. Through the years, with \"associated\" cottages/motel, the business(es) would have many owners-partners and/or operators, a few for only a relatively short period of time and identified by several slightly different names.\n\nBlue Goose Inn\n\nThe Blue Goose Inn, U.S. 1 and Jensen Cut-Off Road, was actually instituted in the summer of 1944, it being a transformation of (George) Fuller's Bar, which was to be subsequently owned and operated by Thomas \"Tommy\" Savas, who was associated as bartender with Andy Tsimas. The Inn was to have a night club atmosphere, specializing in mixed drinks, and an opening night party was scheduled for July 27. Savas had bought the establishment, located on a 1½-acre triangular plot, on July 5, 1944, including a bordering five-acre parcel, but Tommy soon sold the land and interests, which then went through several sale transactions, to be owned by George and Beatrice Casper, Jan. 16, 1946.\n\nGeorge, born July 15, 1895, was originally from Buffalo, N.Y., but had settled in Chester, Penn., Beatrice's hometown, where the couple owned and operated a restaurant. The Blue Goose was a great venture for the Caspers, who had moved to the area. An advertisement in 1946 proclaimed it to be the place for the \"finest foods-cocktails\" about 2½ miles north of Stuart, specializing in \"Chicken in the Basket\" and Delicious Western Steaks ? Bar, Package Store & Grill. Having been closed since June 29, 1947, the Caspers sold the restaurant and cocktail lounge on Aug. 28 to Stan Mistura, Bill Bass, Theodore Bemben and wife, Anne, all as equal partners, for about $35,000.\n\nGeorge and Beatrice retained the five-acre parcel on which was located a motel/court, at one time advertised as: Overnight cottages and apartments for rent, A.C. optional, rates by day, week, month, with restaurant and bar close by and near a bathing (Jensen) beach. (At different times, the Caspers owned and/or managed the property as did the Currans, \"Pop\" (Wilbur) and Agnes, who were also proprietors of the Snack Basket at 842 S. Federal Hwy. in Stuart in the '60s.)\n\nStanley Anthony Mistura, born in Detroit, Mich., had come to Florida about 1944, settling first in Fort Lauderdale, where he worked at Uncle's Bar & Grill and eventually partnered with William Walter Bass in Deerfield Beach to operate a restaurant (Gulf Stream) in Broward County, both being very young, energetic businessmen. The two men with the other two partners were ready to reopen the bar and grill in October 1947 and begin a new business enterprise in Martin County. The Bembens, however, sold all interest to Mistura and Bass, Feb. 1, 1951 and within little more than a year, June 2, 1952, Henry A. and Rowena S. Chamberlain had purchased the property for about $44,000; Stan and Bill had successfully operated the Blue Goose Bar & Grill for almost five years.\n\nHenry Chamberlain had been in the restaurant business in Atlanta, Ga., for more than 30 years, but relocated to Martin County. The establishment with cocktail bar, open from 1 to 11 p.m., was advertised as offering fine steaks, chicken and seafood; nightly entertainment was provided by Mary Austin, who played popular music on an organ. Sept. 20, 1954, Chamberlain, having other business interests in Miami, sold the Blue Goose for $25,000 to G. Ted Wells and Andrew Bradford, relative newcomers to the area from Covington, Kentucky. The two planned to remodel the facility and modernize the business, which was to include the installation of air conditioning and streamlining the kitchen; hours would be from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. daily and 1 p.m. to 2 a.m. Sundays.\n\nOn Jan. 4, 1955, Wells sold all interest to Bradford. In '56 the Blue Goose featured fine steaks and seafood, cocktail lounge and drive-in package goods and in 1958 the Blue Goose Bar & Restaurant advertised dinners and cocktails served from 5 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. with entertainment by Everette Engerson. Bradford eventually sold to Richard P. and Anita C. Gideon, June 29, 1961 and the popular establishment was to continue for years with different names, but like the adjoining \"associated\" five acre parcel, ownership was transferred many times.\n\nThe Pink Pony\n\nMeanwhile, in 1955, Stan Mistura and Bill Bass had made plans to build and open a family restaurant and roomy cocktail lounge in Stuart, to be called the Pink Pony, located about three miles south of Stuart at the southwest intersection of U.S. 1 and Indian Street. The area was essentially undeveloped, perhaps even a little remote, outside the city limits; Indian Street wouldn't be paved for more than 20 years!\n\nThe partners contracted Herbert G. Gass of Jensen Beach to design, construct and decorate the establishment at an estimated cost of about $75,000. The building would be situated on a corner parcel with 350 feet of U.S. 1 frontage and approximately 200 feet deep; Stan and Bill also built a home on the large site. The restaurant was totally air-conditioned, with 4,200 square feet of floor space; the dining area, decorated in pink and black with distinctive wallpaper, featured colorful confetti-type vinyl tile floors, vinyl covered furnishings and provided seating for 250 customers.\n\nA most modern kitchen assured patrons that meals would be prepared to the cleanest and highest standards by chef Bill Bass, with broiled foods, steaks a specialty. Installation of the best equipment included a large Sta-Kold refrigeration case. The staff and waitresses were efficient and pleasant and service was fast. One of the first and best was Vivian Kirkhart, who worked there several years before waitressing at the Outrigger. There was even a special secluded dining area for private parties and the décor throughout displayed the \"Pink Pony\" motif; available parking space could accommodate more than 150 cars!\n\nMany of the area's contractors and suppliers had contributed to the building of the fine establishment including: Frank Hale, roofing; Bert Quinn, plumbing; Gamble Electric, wiring; Casa Lumber Company, building supplies; Stuart Paint and Supply, Inc., paints; Burke Tile Company, flooring; Tom Allen, driveway and parking lot materials. With the slogan \"Stuart's Finest Restaurant and Cocktail Lounge\" the business was ready for customers by May 1955, with a Grand Opening to be announced at a later time.\n\nThe Martin County High School graduating class of 1945 observed its 10th reunion anniversary dinner party at the fabulous restaurant, which would soon gain much success and popularity in the community as one of the finest in the area. Individuals, couples, families, civic and charitable groups, all dined at the fancy establishment, a perfect place for a young gent to take and impress a sweetheart date.\n\nThe Pink Pony, with unique, recognizable, rearing horse logo, was a landmark restaurant attracting residents and visitors for years, but by 1977 Stan and Bill were ready to retire, selling the business to Eric Kirchhofer, a chef from New York and Switzerland and partner, Joe Kensel, also a chef who had worked in London and the Caribbean. The restaurant, 3220 SE Federal Hwy., US 1, would soon be known as Le Pavillion, specializing in French, continental cuisine and would continue operation into the 1980s.\n\nInevitable changes\n\nInevitable, major development and changes, however, occurred on the highway frontage of U.S. 1 in the 1980s, which included the planning and building of the Treasure Coast Mall in Jensen. The acreage needed for the massive shopping center and outparcel strips for other stores encompassed the land once occupied by the Blue Goose, which had previously served the community for many years.\n\nThe restaurant building, which at one time had been the Pink Pony, experienced a similar fate when plans were made for the construction of Wedgewood Commons at U. S. 1 and Indian Street in Stuart. (Martin Square Mall, adjacent to and north of Indian Street, had already been built, opened in 1981.) Eventually a gas station (Mobil) and later a bank (Seacoast) would be located near the corner of the busy intersection.\n\nBill Bass, born Jan. 14, 1917, died Dec. 10, 1981 and Stanley Mistura, born Sept. 1, 1919, died Aug. 8, 1999, both in Martin County, but will surely be remembered by many as two of the more prominent restauranteurs of the area.\n\nAlice L.
