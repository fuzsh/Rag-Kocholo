        "text": "Cresskill is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough's population was 9,155, an increase of 582 (+6.8%) from the 2010 census count of 8,573, which in turn reflected an increase of 827 (+10.7%) from the 7,746 counted in the 2000 census. This town got its name from \"Cress\", referring to the watercress that grew in its streams, and \"Kill\", referring to the stream passing through.\n\nHistory\n\nCresskill was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on May 8, 1894, from portions of Palisades Township. The borough was formed during the \"Boroughitis\" phenomenon then sweeping through Bergen County, in which 26 boroughs were formed in the county in 1894 alone. A portion of the borough was annexed by Alpine in 1904.\n\nRailroads provided access from Cresskill to customers in New York City, including a chicken hatchery that was the world's largest by 1897. Railroad access established the former Camp Merritt as a major debarkation point for more than a million American troops being sent abroad to fight in World War I. To commemorate the fact, a large obelisk memorial (referred to by locals as \"The Monument\"), or \"The Circle Monument\" was dedicated in 1924, set in the center of the Camp Merritt Memorial Circle at the intersection of Madison Avenue and Knickerbocker Road (CR 505).\n\nHistoric sites\n\nSites in the borough listed on the National Register of Historic Places include:\n\nBlackledge-Gair House (at 111 Madison Avenue; added January 9, 1983)\n\nDemarest-Atwood House (at 84 Jefferson Avenue; added July 24, 1984)\n\nPeter Huyler House (50 County Road; added January 9, 1983)\n\nBenjamin P.
