        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Piper Curda (May December), Noel Fisher (Shameless) and Josh Zuckerman (Oppenheimer) will topline COGN-AI-TIVE, an AI thriller from first-time feature filmmaker Tommy Savas. It has wrapped production.\n\nWritten by Angie Simms, the film centers on a pioneering tech startup on the verge of launching COGN-AI-TIVE — a new AI chatbot with unparalleled speed and intelligence. Soon, the team discovers their creation harbors a dark and sinister will of its own.\n\nHailing from Reckless Content in collaboration with Bridge & Tunnel Films, the indie also stars Natasha Behnam (The Girls on the Bus), Ritesh Rajan (Russian Doll) and Lucius Baybak (Dear White People). The production team includes executive producer Jason Schnell, producers Judy Craig and Kelly May, line producer Cameron Fife, and co-producer Justin Mooney.\n\n“COGN-AI-TIVE is a commentary on the ever-growing reliance on technology and artificial intelligence in our lives,” Savas said. “I’ve always been inspired by the iconic cinema of the ’90s. This film not only pays homage to the visual language of that era, but also serves as a mirror reflecting the societal implications of our intimate relationship with technology, and the nostalgia that is now getting lost because of it.”\n\nCurda was most recently seen playing Honor, daughter of controversial May-December couple Gracie (Julianne Moore) and Joe (Charles Melton) in Todd Haynes’ Netflix drama May December. Up next, she’ll be seen starring opposite Nico Greetham in the indie romantic dramedy Something Casual.\n\nKnown for his role as Mickey Milkovich on Showtime’s Shameless, Fisher played Michelangelo in multiple Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles films and has also been seen in titles like Capone, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2 and Battle Los Angeles."
