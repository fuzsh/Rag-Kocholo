        "text": "THE BOOK WORLD has changed significantly over the past decade, but our mission remains the same.\n\nWe find and develop outstanding original military and general history manuscripts and bring them to you in the form of quality books you will be proud to read, own, and keep for a lifetime.\n\nMost of our titles are available either signed by the author or with an original signed author book plate--at no additional charge. We also offer exclusive group discounts for bulk orders for round tables and other organizations.\n\nWe welcome your feedback and look forward to serving your needs.\n\n* * *\n\nTheodore P. Savas (Managing Director) graduated from The University of Iowa College of Law in 1986 (With Distinction). He practiced law in Silicon Valley for many years and taught business and history classes at the college level for about 20 years.\n\nIn 1990, he co-founded (with David Woodbury) the historical press Savas Woodbury Publishers (later Savas Publishing). The company was sold to an East coast publisher in 2001. Ted and the late Russel H. Beatie together founded Savas Beatie in January 2004.\n\nSavas is the author or editor of fourteen books (published in six languages), including A Guide to the Battles of the American Revolution (with J. David Dameron, Spellmount and SBLLC, 2006), Hunt and Kill: U-505 and the U-Boat War in the Atlantic (Spellmount, SBLLC, 2004), Silent Hunters: German U-boat Commanders of World War II (Campbell, 1997; Naval Institute Press, 2003), Nazi Millionaires: The Allied Search for Hidden SS Gold (Casemate, 2002), and many others, as well as scores of articles in a variety of journals, magazines, and newspapers.\n\nHis hobbies include scuba diving, smoking good cigars, drinking quality gin, and playing bass and keyboards in the hard rock band Arminius.

He is the author of several articles and books, including Road to Manassas (Cooper Square, 1961), and three volumes in the The Army of the Potomac series: Volume 1: Birth of Command, September 1860 - September 1861; Volume 2: McClellan Takes Command: September 1861-February 1862 (2004), and Volume 3: McClellan's First Campaign, March - May 1862 (2007). Unfortunately, Cap Beatie passed away before finishing the series. The manuscript for his fourth volume, McClellan and the Battle of Fair Oaks/Seven Pines, is under development.\n\nCap's interest in the Civil War first began at a young age when he read Douglas Southall Freeman's Lee's Lieutenants: A Study in Command. The Kansas native and former lieutenant in the field artillery and infantry lived in the New York City area most of his life. We miss him.\n\nSarah Keeney (Marketing Director) graduated from Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, California, with a degree in journalism (with a public relations concentration) and has been with Savas Beatie since Day 1.

This inevitability contributes positively to her success at scheduling various events and media for many Savas Beatie authors. Her family is thankful to have her sleuthing tendencies directed away from them. Outside the office, she's an avid college and pro sports fan, and keeps busy cheering on her favorite teams.
