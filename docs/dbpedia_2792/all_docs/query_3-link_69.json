        "text": "Joseph Nicholas Diacossavas “Joseph Brown”, beloved husband and brother, entered fully into the presence of the Lord on Friday, January 13, 2023, at the youthful age of fifty five.\n\nBorn in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Joseph, who later went by Nick, was raised in Springfield, Missouri. He is survived by his beautiful wife of 16 years, Heather of Lucas, Texas, and their three fur children, Stormy, Princess Leia and newest member, Bruce Lee; his father Loannis (John) Diakosavvas of Rhodes, Greece; his brothers Michael Brown and his wife Becky of Galena, Missouri and Andrew Brown of Springfield, Missouri; his sister Becky Smith and husband Jon of Springfield, Missouri; his brother Gabby Diakosavvas of Rhodes, Greece; nephew Ryan Brown of St Louis, Missouri; his nieces Ashley King of El Paso, TX, Rachel Gray of Ozark, Missouri and Bethany Line of Ozark, Missouri; his great nephew Landon King of El Paso, Texas; his great nieces Carlie Hunt of Ozark, Missouri, Allison King of El Paso, Texas and Amera Brown of St Louis, Missouri; his father in law Tommy White and mother in law Nola White, both of Springfield, Missouri and sister in law Mandy White of Los Angeles, California.\\\n\nHe was lovingly greeted in Heaven by his mother Laurie Hunter Brown, his dad Donald Wayne Brown, as well as his two fur children Dallas and Zia.\n\nNick was laser focused, accomplishing anything and everything he set his mind to.\n\nWith over 30 years of experience in his field, Nick earned his Mechanical Contractor HVAC Master license and went on to build his legacy, Nick’s Air Services in Plano, Texas.\n\nNick loved collecting cars, especially Corvettes and Shelby Cobra’s. His favorite things to do were spoiling his wife with her every desire, hunting, fishing, bowling and mastering the art of poker. He loved ice hockey and in his twenties, refereed one of Springfield’s renown ice hockey teams. Nick was an avid Cowboys fan, he never missed a game and at one time, owned box seats at the Dallas Cowboys AT&T Stadium which if you knew him, was one of the highlights of his life.\n\nAs a son of a missionary, Nick’s faith was an essential part of his life. He spent a great deal of time spreading the word of God to anyone he could. The most prominent thing that stands out about Nick was his heart of gold. He was blindly generous, showing kindness and warmth to those who crossed paths with him. With a smile that lit up every room, he loved people and was a stranger to no one.\n\nServices will be held on Monday, January 23, 2023 at Greenlawn Funeral Home East in Springfield, Missouri at 11am. Pastor Richard Orrell will officiate. Interment will be held at Rivermonte Memorial Gardens in the Garden of Courage. Visitation will be fro 2:00 to 5:00 pm Sunday, January 22, 2023 in the funeral home. Pallbearers will include Michael Brown, Andrew Brown, Michael Barger, Paul Carson, Chris Cauble, Jeff Kastner, Shannon Ryan and Kenny Wiford."
