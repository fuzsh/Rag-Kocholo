        "text": "I remain committed to working my way through all episodes of Yarning Disability, the First Peoples Disability Network podcast. I had big listening plans for my recent road trip to Woolgoolga( Gumbayngirr country) and Central Coast (Darkinjung land) back to Meeanjin (Turrbal and Yuggera country). Unfortunately, poor mobile coverage meant no streaming for me! Before all connection was lost, I did get to tune into Episode 7 with Founder and CEO of FULLBLACK Group, Meeanjin based Kanat J. Wano. Bernard Namok Jr introduced the session as being taken on ‚Äòa journey of learning and understanding‚Äô. The pace was of this journey was fast! My brain rattled with the twists and turns. There was so much to take in, so I went back for a second listen this week. My OT synapses were firing once more, they zinged when Kanat introduced himself by his occupational connections ‚ÄòI am a father, grandfather ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ etc‚Äô zapped when he spoke of his purpose - fairness, equity, access and social justice sizzled with his focus on well -being ‚Äòwhat we see is determined by our wellbeing‚Äô with a connection to function exploded when I listened to Kanat dive deep into First Nations Lore Therapy My takeaway on his First Nations Lore Therapy Lore system = personal development system Self governance - Working Out v Working In - working on belief and sense of self - faith, affirmations) Interconnection with Lore (occupational) Obligations Lore develops - ‚Äòbecoming‚Äô Lore is what we choose - ‚Äòdoing‚Äô Personal lore ‚Äì ‚Äòpurpose‚Äô In the leadership space, I will be exploring lore with Kerryn Walker in the context of leadership - Leadership Lore for sure! Listening to Kanat, I was reminded of the wisdom that comes with lived experience and knowledge. I recognised my increased level of comfort in sharing my wisdom balanced with humility, curiosity and a healthy -dose of self-doubt. Segue, If you haven‚Äôt read Leigh Sales book On Doubt, first released in 2009 and re-freshed in 2021, it is a must add to your reading list. There is much more in this conversation - colonisation, trauma, disability, accessibility with a microphone drop thrown in! If you are not drawn to listen, I will leave you with these pearls of wisdom from Kanat ‚ÄòWalk in your light‚Äô. https://lnkd.in/g6JAaY6f\n\nJust when you start to feel as though you need a bit more consistency in your posting, you get struck with the ultimate time to do so! I do not believe that my condition will ever define me as an individual, but it is certainly not something to be underestimated. Give me hope, and I will find a reason to give you all the belief that you should never be consumed with the idea that anything can not be achieved with hard work and a passion. And remember, if the why is powerful enough, the how is easy.

After years of being in the corporate world and accepting whatever little (if any) accommodations offered to her, Alycia Anderson always felt that she never wanted to receive any special treatment and was constantly fighting an uphill battle to balance her medical complications with her work obligations. Today, Alycia is a motivational speaker, disability advocate, podcaster, DEI workplace champion, entrepreneur, tennis player, and so much more. Having a congenital disability and medical challenges, all while being a changemaker and trailblazer is what drew Peri Finkelstein to Alycia as they both face similar experiences and obstacles every single day. This podcast is different from others as we discuss what it is like growing up the way that Peri & Alycia have, the challenges that come with having a congenital disability, as well as the importance of talking about dating and intimacy as a person with a disability. Sometimes you don‚Äôt need a man to carry you over a mountain top. Rather, what you need is a mentor like Alycia to guide you along the way. üéôFull podcast interview available on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, iHeartRadio, and Amazon Music.

Episode 32 of Legally Blonde & Blind premieres on SATURDAY, APRIL 6TH! ü•Ç Alcohol can be a social lubricant, so it‚Äôs no surprise that I‚Äôve received some of the most fascinating, bizarre, and hilarious questions about my low vision at the bar. Disability is often the elephant in the room. People either avert their gaze or stare at those with visible disabilities across the street. They either ask random, invasive questions like ‚Äúwhat happened to you?‚Äù or chastise their children for asking about our mobility aids. However, conversations surrounding disability, if you are comfortable talking about it, do not need to be uncomfortable, depressing, or violating. To celebrate my 21st birthday (eight months after the fact), the 32nd episode of Legally Blonde & Blind answers questions my listeners and I have received from people who *might* have been a little tipsy. Image Description: The image is a promotional graphic for a podcast episode. It has a pink background with the following text in large, playful, dark purple font: \"EPISODE 32: QUESTIONS \"TIPSY\" PEOPLE ASK ABOUT MY DISABILITY.‚Äù Below the text, there's a subtitle in smaller white font that reads: \"A BLIND GIRL WALKS IN A BAR...AND GETS ASKED SOME STRANGE QUESTIONS!\" To the right, there's a graphic of a cocktail in a glass with a cherry, a slice of citrus, and a sprig of an herb on top. The date \"APRIL 6TH!\" is written in a circle above the glass in a bright pink color. There are also some white sparkles scattered around the text. #blind #disability #disabilitypride #disabilityawareness #disabilityrights #disabilityinclusion #disabilityjustice #disabilityadvocate #albinism #albinismisbeautiful #albinismawarenes #albinismocular #albinism"
