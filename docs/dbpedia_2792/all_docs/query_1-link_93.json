        "text": "Patrick Renna Actor/Director of “Bad Roomies”\n\nInterviewed and written by Aaron Robinson - Editor\n\nPatrick Renna and his longtime friend Jason Schnell recently partnered with Tommy Savas, who is recognized for playing in The Sopranos and The Last Ship, along with screenwriter/director Justin Mooney to produce \"Bad Roomies\", an original feature-length film.\n\nOver the course of Renna’s career he has played in over 25 featured films. Some titles include “The Sandlot”, “The Big Green” and award-winning television series such as Boston Legal and The X-Files.\n\nI was able to speak to Patrick Renna about his latest project “Bad Roomies” and how he was able to fund it through Kickstarter. Here is what he had to share during a recent interview with Consciousness Magazine.\n\nTell us a little about how “Bad Roomies” came into existence? I’ve known Jason for a few years now. He works with the Reckless Tortuga crew, its funny. We have always talked about it. We’ve been really good friends. And though good fortune, we were realistically able to secure some financing. Through the Kickstarter network we were able to kick it off.\n\nWhat inspired you guys to want to collaborate and produce this film? Well, we traditionally got a little bit of funding, but it wasn’t quite half of what we needed. Through “The Sandlot” and Reckless Tortuga, we thought that maybe if we put it up that people would like to help and contribute to the funding. And we’ve done very well. We just had heard about it obviously through Veronica Mars’ success and we took a shot.\n\nThis is your first film as a producer. What kind of experience has that been for you as oppose to acting? Well, it definitely has been a great experience. Even the casting process of casting the other characters and as an actor to be able to be on the other side to see the casting has been a complete new experience for me. I think it’s good for an actor to switch up because I think you see what producers are looking for when they are casting. I think having that experience for myself makes it much more empathy.\n\nCan we expect more up-and-coming films and projects from you in the future? Absolutely, yeah! I’m pretty focused on this right now. We started filming in February. We’re flat on our feet with production and pretty busy on this one, but absolutely.\n\nWould you like to share any encouraging words to aspiring actors and film producers who are looking to be successful in this respected line of work? For every ‘no’ there is a ‘yes’. And never take ‘no’ for an answer. If you believe in it that’s all that matters and you can accomplish it!\n\nWould you like to add anything in closing about “Bad Roomies “that we haven’t covered Patrick? I’m excited; I think it’s going to be great. And I hope the audience feels the same once we’re done with it.\n\nFor more information and the latest happenings on Patrick Renna please visit him at https://twitter.com/PatrickRenna and instagram.com/patrickrenna\n\nUgo Lord Believe it Live it Dream it\n\nUgo Lord “Believe it, Live it, Dream it” Interviewed and written by Tocarra Eldridge “If I can believe in myself to a point that pushes me and motivates me to overcome my issues, then I should do everything I can to try to push and motivate others so that they can overcome the issues they’re having in their life,” sincerely articulates Ugo Lord, Life Coach/Motivational Speaker/TV Host of The Ugo Lord Show.
