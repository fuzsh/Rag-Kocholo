He is known for Roger Dodger (2002), Seven Days (2007) and Extra Butter, Please (2011).\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nSavas was born in Harlem, New York, United States. He was raised in Cresskill, New Jersey,[1] the youngest of four children where, as a child, he showed a strong interest in acting and theatre.[2] His grandfather fought in World War II.[3]\n\nBy the age of six, he had studied improvisation and acting with Susan Dias Karnovsky and appeared in commercials and HBO and PBS children's productions. Between school work and soccer games, Savas studied privately with Joseph Daly, and at HB Studios in New York under Trudi Stible.[citation needed]\n\nHe spent time between New York and Los Angeles where he studied with Robert Lyons and Lynette McNeil, and had comedy training with Shari Shaw. Savas continued to hone his acting skills appearing in local theatre productions and in sketch comedy at the HA! Comedy Club in New York.[citation needed]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nHis big break came at age 15 when he was selected from 15,000 actors to play the role of Xavier, AJ Soprano’s high school friend in the HBO series, The Sopranos.[2] After The Sopranos, Savas had a guest starring role in Law and Order: Special Victims Unit and a part in the Tribeca Film Festival award-winning film, Roger Dodger.[4]\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Savas moved out to Los Angeles[2] to pursue his already burgeoning career and was quickly chosen to appear in Cold Case, Without a Trace, Shark, The New Adventures of Old Christine, General Hospital and many others.[5] He can also be seen in many national commercials such as Gillette, Nesquik, Guitar Hero, Pizza Hut[6] and Subway.[7]\n\nSavas formed Reckless Tortuga with a small group of friends in 2009 as a means of continually creating things and working even if they were not booking work professionally. Reckless Tortuga became a popular YouTube web-based comedy channel, where he has a recurring role as Damian in the webseries, The Online Gamer.[8]\n\nIn 2014, Savas played Cossetti in Michael Bay's post-apocalyptic TV series The Last Ship.[9] He also played the series regular Dashiell Greer in Katherine Heigl's NBC drama, State of Affairs, which was premiered in November 2014.[10]\n\nIn 2015, Savas co-wrote and starred in the dark comedy Bad Roomies with Patrick Renna.[2] The movie was partially funded through Kickstarter ($75,000 was raised).[4]\n\nIn 2016, Savas was cast as Reggie in the ABC comedy pilot The Fluffy Shop, co-written by and starring Gabriel Iglesias.[11]\n\nSavas jokingly said that Shia LaBeouf stole his career after they screen tested against each other for the role of a young Robert Downey Jr. in the movie A Guide to Recognizing your Saints and Lebouf was given the part.[12]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nSavas occasionally works as a substitute teacher and has said that if acting fell through, he would love to be a teacher.[3]\n\nGary Oldman is an actor who Savas admires for his ability to play many different characters.[3]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2007 Seven Days Max Short movie 2009 Poolside Doug Short movie 2015 Bad Roomies Ray (Raymond) Movie 2017 It Happened One Valentine's Matty Sellers Direct-to-video film 2021 Luv U Cuz —\n\nProducer\n\nAnimated short movie\n\n2022 Mother of the Dawn —\n\nProducer\n\nDocumentary\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2001 The Sopranos Xavier 2 episodes 2002 Law & Order: Special Victims Unit Sanjeev Episode: \"Deception\" 2004 Arrested Development Bully Episode: \"Beef Consomme\" 2006 Cold Case Tommy Dicenzio Episode:\"Frank’s Best\" 2006 The New Adventures of Old Christine Mark Episode: \"Open Water\" 2007 Shark Kenny Leary Episode: \"Backfire\" 2008 General Hospital Young Sonny 2 episodes 2009 Raising the Bar Owen Clark Episode: \"The Curious Case of Kellerman's Button\" 2010 CSI: NY Rick Contoursi Episode: \"Tales from the Undercard\" 2010 Justified Ronson Episode: \"Fathers and Sons\" 2011 House Cruz Episode: \"Last Temptation\" 2011 Prime Suspect Bugsy Episode: \"Shame\" 2012 Castle Marcus Hiatt Episode: \"An Embarrassment of Bitches\" 2009-2012 Psycho Girlfriend Seth 21 episodes 2012 Hollywood Heights Ray 9 episodes 2011-2012 Extra Butter, Please Various 48 episodes 2013 The Online Gamer Damien/Tirion Fordring 16 episodes 2014-2018 The Last Ship Cossetti 2014-2015 State of Affairs Dashiell Greer 2017 Hell's Kitchen Himself Episode: \"Fusion/Confusion\" 2018 9-1-1 Daniel Episode: \"Stuck\" 2019 Dirty John Max Episode: \"This Young Woman Fought Like Hell\" 2022-2023 National Treasure Edge of History Dr. Zeke Hudson 5 episodes\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
