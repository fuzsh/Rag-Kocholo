        "text": "New NBC series feature Heigl, 'Happy Endings' duo\n\nNBC ordered four new shows Tuesday, getting a jump on next week's fall schedule announcement in New York.\n\nThe pickups include three dramas, State of Affairs, Allegiance and Odyssey, and a comedy, Marry Me.\n\nThey join the network's earlier series orders, including Aquarius, a drama starring David Duchovny as a police investigator hunting Charles Manson, and two comedies, Mr. Robinson, which stars The Office's Craig Robinson, and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt from 30 Rock executive producers Tina Fey and Robert Carlock.\n\nState of Affairs marks Katherine Heigl's much-awaited return to series television. She plays top CIA analyst Charleston Tucker, who assembles the president's daily briefing on critical security issues. Charlie, as she is called, and her analysts must make difficult moral and political judgment calls.\n\nCharlie, who has a close relationship with the president (Alfre Woodard), was engaged to her son before a terrorist attack claimed his life. As she does her job, she is determined to bring the terrorists to justice, and her investigation will have its share of shocking revelations, according to the show's description.\n\nThe cast includes Adam Kaufman, Sheila Vand, Cliff Chamberlain, Tommy Savas and Leslie Odom, Jr. Heigl serves as an executive producer, along with The Blacklist's Joe Carnahan, Nancy Heigl, Robert Simonds, Sophie Watts, Henry Crumpton, Rodney Faraon and Julia Franz.\n\nAllegiance, another drama with CIA ties, reignites Cold War espionage games when a deactivated spy couple, American Mark (Scott Cohen) and Russian-born Katya (Hope Davis), are called back into service as part of a terrorist operation designed to take place in the United States.\n\nKatya had recruited Mark years earlier to be a spy. When the two fell in love, she was allowed to marry him and move to America on the condition that she could be called back to duty in the future. The couple's new assignment calls for them to turn their son Alex (Gavin Stenhouse), a young, idealistic CIA analyst, into a spy.\n\nCast members include Margaret Levieva, Morgan Spector, Annie Ilonzeh, Alexandra Peters and Kenneth Choi. The Adjustment Bureau's George Nolfi and Homeland's Avi Nir are two of the executive producers.\n\nIn action-drama Odyssey, an international conspiracy explodes after a Traffic-like collision of strangers' lives. A U.S. soldier in North Aftrica (Anna Friel), a corporate lawyer (Peter Facinelli) and a political activist (Jake Robinson) must join together to expose a vast military-industrial conspiracy and criminal cover-up.\n\nOdyssey also stars Jim True-Frost, Treat Williams, Nate Mooney, Elena Kampouris, Daniella Pineda, Sadie Sink, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje and Omar Ghazaoui. Executive producers include Grey's Anatomy's Peter Horton, The Following's Adam Armus and Heroes' Nora Kay Foster.\n\nOn the comedy front, Marry Me looks at a longtime couple, Annie (Happy Endings' Casey Wilson) and Jake (Eastbound & Down's Ken Marino), who have been together for six years but can't seem to get the timing right for a marriage proposal.\n\nHe plans to pop the question after a romantic island vacation but, before he can ask, she criticizes his inability to commit and questions why he didn't propose on their trip. They hold off on getting engaged until they can do it right, but who knows when that will be? The only certainty is that they are destined to be together, the show description says.\n\nSarah Wright, John Gemberling, Tymberlee Hill and Tim Meadows also star in Marry Me, which features Happy Endings creator David Caspe, Seth Gordon and Jamie Tarses as executive producers."
