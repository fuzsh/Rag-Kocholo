        "text": "Last Temptation\n\nMasters faces a career crossroads on her last day as a medical student and struggles with the choice to continue on the path to become a surgeon or to accept the rare opportunity to join HouseÂ's team officially. Meanwhile, the team treats a 16-year-old girl who inexplicably collapsed days before embarking on an ambitious sailing tour around the globe. Despite the patient's life-changing diagnosis, the patient's family insists on getting her back on the seas in time for her potentially record-breaking launch. But to the team's surprise, including House, Masters makes a bold decision regarding the patient'Âs treatment.\n\nDetention\n\nWhen a small piece of a note is found, Rush and the team reopen the 1994 death of a teenager that was previously classified as a suicide. After several interviews with local neighbors and childhood friends, it seems the teenager jumped off the roof of his school to his death.\n\nFrank's Best\n\nRush and Valens reopen the 2001 case involving a well-liked local deli owner, Frank Dicenzio, who was apparently beaten to death by his employee. Valens is contacted by the brother of a convicted murderer and is persuaded to reopen the case that left a local neighborhood shocked."
