        "text": "Thank you so much for joining us in this interview series! Our readers would love to get to know you a bit better. Can you tell us a bit of the ‘backstory’ of how you grew up?\n\nI was born in Harlem NY and raised in a suburb right over the bridge. I guess you could say I had a pretty stereotypical upbringing for a kid from Jersey. I spent every weekend as a child either at my family’s diners in Queens, or at the racetrack with my Dad. I loved movies ever since I was a kid. Growing up I was the youngest of four, and because of that, the movies that played on repeat in my house were the hits from the late 70’s and early 80’s. I got my first “break” when I went to an open casting call for the Sopranos at 16. There must have been over 5000 people that showed up at that audition, that show was of course a Jersey favorite, and I was one of the lucky 3 people that got casted on the show. 2 years later, as soon as I graduated high school, I made the move to Los Angeles and have been lucky enough to keep chasing this dream of mine for over 20 years.\n\nCan you share a story with us about what brought you to this specific career path?\n\nMy love for film. I remember that feeling I would get as a child when I would go to the movies, how I would be completely transported to these other worlds, it was literally magic. I knew from a young age I wanted to be part of that.\n\nNone of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?\n\nHonestly more than anyone my parents. A couple years after I had moved to LA I was having a rough time and I called them. I remember telling them that maybe I should go back to school and learn how to be an accountant or something and they told me, “That’s not who you are, you’re doing what you are supposed to be doing.” Hearing them say that and having their support meant everything to me.\n\nCan you please give us your favorite “Life Lesson Quote”? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?\n\nThere is no such thing as luck, only preparation. As much as this business is about the art form you also have to work hard and be a professional at what you do.\n\nI am very interested in diversity in the entertainment industry. Can you share three reasons with our readers about why you think it’s important to have diversity represented in film and television? How can that potentially affect our culture?\n\nNo one can tell a story as authentic as the people who lived it. It brings about unity, and a greater understanding of cultures other than your own. It’s important to represent different groups in film now, so that future generations know it’s possible to tell their story.\n\nWhat are some of the most interesting or exciting projects you are working on now?\n\nComing off of the success of ‘My Dad’s Diner’, I was given the opportunity to direct my first feature film this summer. A horror.\n\nWhich aspect of your work makes you most proud? Can you explain or give a story?\n\nRepresenting my culture, being able to tell stories about my immigrant Cypriot family. So many iconic movies take place with these diners as their backdrop. I wanted to tell the story of the people that made those backdrops and show how rich and full their lives were and are.\n\nOk super. Here is the main question of our interview. What are your “5 things I wish someone told me when I first started” and why.\n\nSurround yourself with other artists. It will inspire you.\n\nIf you get a bad vibe from someone you’re working with, trust your gut. It will save you a lot of time and pain.\n\nShoot every chance you get. This will allow you to learn from your mistakes and deepen your work.\n\nLearn how to do every job on a set. It will make you a better and more understanding filmmaker.\n\nMake sure everyone is well fed. It’s hard to work when you’re hangry.\n\nWhen you create a film, which stakeholders have the greatest impact on the artistic and cinematic choices you make? Is it the viewers, the critics, the financiers, or your own personal artistic vision? Can you share a story with us or give an example about what you mean?\n\nHere’s the thing, everyone has an opinion. What makes you unique as an artist is your point of view. That’s what makes you different from everyone else. You could give the same script to 3 different directors and you would get 3 very different movies. At the end of the day, it’s your name on that movie so make sure above anyone else, you are happy with it.\n\nYou are a person of great influence. If you could start a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-)\n\nAs a type 1 diabetic I’m currently involved in mentoring kids with type 1. It’s a disease that effects over 1.5 million Americans alone. So, with enough support, I think we could find a cure that would change the lives of all the people suffering from it.\n\nWe are very blessed that some of the biggest names in Business, VC funding, Sports, and Entertainment read this column. Is there a person in the world, or in the US whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she might see this. :-)\n\nMartin Scorcese. I grew up on his films and I would say he’s my biggest influence as a filmmaker.\n\nHow can our readers further follow you online?\n\n@tommysavas on all platforms."
