        "text": "Tommy Savas, we are very excited to speak with you. You’re originally from the East Coast. When did your strong desire to act begin and what were the factors that made you decide to do it?\n\nWhen I was 4 years old, the theatre teacher in my elementary school took me under her wing and to be honest, from that point on, I knew it was something I loved doing and wanted to do. I am lucky enough to have made it happen and to have this as my career.\n\nYour resume highlights comedic and dramatic roles. Which type of roles and characters do you tend to lean more towards?\n\nIt’s funny, because for me, I feel that I connect with and enjoy doing comedic roles more but I definitely get hired to do more dramatic roles. Thats why I co-created ‘Reckless Tortuga’, so I am able to always have that as an outlet for my comedy.\n\nYour big break came when you were selected amongst a large group of potentials to play the role of Xavier on HBO’s The Sopranos. Take us through the audition process leading up to when you first stepped on to set.\n\nThere as an open casting call in New Jersey for the upcoming season of The Sopranos, which at the time, was season 3. I bribed my then, 18 year-old sister, to drive me to the audition and when we pulled up, there was a line of about 3,000 people. No joke. The line literally went around for blocks. After debating whether or not we should just leave, we decided to stay, since we didn’t drive that far for nothing. Hours later, I got to the front of the line where all you did was drop off your headshot and resume. About a month later, I got a call from Georgianne Walken (casting director for The Sopranos) asking me to come in and read for the show. Mind you, at that time, I was a 16 year-old kid from Jersey, wanting nothing more to be an actor, so I was beyond elated. Needless to say, after a couple call backs, I booked the role! Stepping onto the set for the first time, was an unbelievable experience. All of the cast were like a big family and when I arrived, they treated me like one of their own, no questions asked. I truly believe that this experience is one that has put me on the path I am on today and I don’t think I would be where I am today without it.\n\nWould you say that being on that particular set with these actors was your defining moment?\n\nYes, definitely. That experience was a defining moment for me because it gave me confidence in myself to continue to strive to be a professional actor and to know that this was something I wanted and could do.\n\nSince that time, you’ve had guest appearance on wide range of shows. What did you take away from all of these experiences?\n\nEvery single one of those experiences was unique. The challenge of coming on to someone’s else set, that’s already a moving train and jumping on, having to keep up with those actors and portray a wide variety of characters, was the best acting class that anyone can ever have.\n\nCurrently, you’re on the highly anticipated series, NBC’s State of Affairs. What was it about the show that drew your interest and made you want to jump on board?\n\nFor me, it was being able to tell the story about these unsung heroes of America [CIA briefers.] Additionally, it was being able to tell a story that hasn’t been told before. It was fascinating to see what these men and women do on a daily basis and how it affects, not just their job, but their personal lives and who they are as people. On top of all of that, it was also the opportunity to work with three of the greats in the industry, Joe Carnahan, Katherine Heigl, and Alfre Woodard.\n\nOn the show, you play the role of Dashiell Greer. What’s the good and bad of Dashiell and what do you enjoy about playing him the most?\n\nHe is the youngest member of the president’s daily briefing team. With being so young, you get both good and bad. He is extremely intelligent, eager, and an amazing problem solver, but since he is so young, his age and experience gets him in trouble. One of my favorite parts about playing Dashiell, is he finds a way to bring levity in some of the most intense situations.\n\nNot too shabby that you get to work alongside Katherine Heigl and Alfre Woodard. Have you been picking their brains about your craft?\n\nOf course, I’ve been picking their brains! They’re two of the greats, and I feel so lucky to be working alongside both of them. They have been extremely eager and willing to provide insight and teach me certain lessons that they have learned, from their own experience of being in the business and acting for so long.\n\nThe show is set primarily in & out of the White House, so the wardrobe mirrors what we typically see from politicians. When it comes to fashion off set, who are some of your favorite fashion designers and what’s your personal style?\n\nI’m a pretty simple person. I’m all about a nice pair of jeans and a t-shirt. I do love Rag & Bone and A.P.C.\n\nWe look forward to seeing how the freshman season of State of Affairs develops. What other projects do you have coming up?\n\nI act and produce in my own independent film called ‘Bad Roomies’ which is hitting the 2014-2015 festival circuit – so keep an eye out for that!\n\nTwitter: @TommySavas\n\nInstagram: @TommyTwos\n\nFacebook: Tommy Savas\n\nWebsite: TommySavas.com"
