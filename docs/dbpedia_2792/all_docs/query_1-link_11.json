        "text": "The Sopranos star, Tommy Savas is a film all rounder! From acting in shows to directing his own films, and even debuting them at various film festivals, Tommy can be seeing doing exceptional things! Inspired by true events, his latest film ‘My Dad’s Diner’ takes you behind the scenes of popular movies, that use diner backdrops, to tell the stories of all those who worked in diners in reality, and shed some light on the nitty-gritties of their individual lives. Tommy also mentors newly diagnosed diabetics and helps them adjust to their new lifestyle, quite the philanthrope indeed! Let Jejune Magazine take you through this engaging interview with Tommy Savas, and help you explore his art — his films!\n\nWhere are you based?\n\nI’m living in Los Angeles currently.\n\nYou are involved in all things film — acting, directing, writing, and producing. What inspired you to get into film? Do you have a favorite part?\n\nSome of my earliest memories as a child were that of going to the movies. I knew from a young age this is what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to be a part of creating and telling stories in every capacity which is what led me to pursuing a career in every part of the creative process. I would say directing is the most fulfilling for me.\n\nCongrats on your directorial short film, ‘My Dad’s Diner’, which won at Astoria Film Festival and debuted at the Manhattan Film Festival! Can you tell us about ‘My Dad’s Diner’, and what inspired the making of this film?\n\nMy Dad’s Diner is a true story about my father growing up in the Greek Diner Business during the 1960s in Queens, NY. So many iconic movies take place with these Diners as their backdrop. I wanted to tell the story of the people that made those backdrops and show how rich and full their lives were and are.\n\nWhat is your favorite part about directing?\n\nFor me it’s like being the composer of an orchestra. It’s a director’s responsibility to bring together all these elements to communicate a compelling story. I thoroughly enjoy that process.\n\nWhat advice would you give to other upcoming filmmakers who want to debut at any film festival?\n\nResearch the festivals you’re considering submitting to. Most festivals have specific kinds of films they like to program. So, I would target the ones that have programs that your film would fit nicely into.\n\nWhat would you say was your greatest challenge in the making of ‘My Dad’s Diner’?\n\nTwo things. 1) it being a period piece. And 2) figuring out how to make a compelling film while honoring the fact that this is a true story.\n\nYou had your first big break in The Sopranos, and this film has a bit of a similar vibe. Did your time with The Sopranos influence this film?\n\nEvery set I’ve ever been on has influenced me to some degree, of course. As a matter of fact, the mob boss in the movie was one of my fellow cast members from the Sopranos.\n\nYou also recently wrote and produced ‘Mother of Dawn’. Can you tell us a bit about this film?\n\nThis project was very special to me. We had the honor of premiering it at SXSW this year. It was about an obscure religious group in the jungles of Brazil called “The Valley of the Dawn.” I wanted to do something different than the one-sided expose you see all too often in religious documentaries. And I think that’s why the film has been so well received.\n\nOn top of being busy in film you are passionate about your work with JDRF and the American Diabetes Association. Can you tell us a bit about your work with these organizations and why you chose to partner with them?\n\nThese are both excellent organizations that fight for a cure for Type 1 diabetes. I currently mentor a group of newly diagnosed young diabetics to help them adjust to their new lifestyle of living with this disease.\n\nDo you have any advice for anyone living with Type 1 Diabetes?\n\nYou control it. Don’t let it control you.\n\nWhat is your motto in life?\n\nTreat others the way you want to be treated.\n\nIt has been a rough few years. How have you been staying positive during these times?\n\nNever stop creating. Keep writing, keep developing. Shoot things with friends, and always stay busy creatively.\n\nTo learn more about Tommy Savas, please follow him via the links below:\n\nInstagram: @tommysavas\n\nTwitter: @tommysavas\n\nFacebook: @tommysavas"
