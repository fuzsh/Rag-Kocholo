Good then went to work for Timken Roller Bearing Co. in Canton, Ohio, but returned to the area in 1968 when he took a position at Maryland Cup Corp.’s Sweetheart Cup in Owings Mills, where he rose to national sales administrator and finally to director of the straw division.

He eventually sold the business and acquired Frank’s Pallet Service in 1988, and operated the Rosedale company with a son, George L. Good Jr., of Towson, until retiring in 2006. Good had two interests that came to define his life: music and sailing. Good joined the Choral Arts board in 1993 and remained there until 2016, when he stepped down. He also served as board president from 1995-99. Good was 14 when he purchased his first sailboat, and for decades cruised and raced the bay extensively. He shared his enthusiasm for sailing with his family and when his three children were growing up, weekends were spent sailing on Middle River and the Chesapeake Bay. Through the years, he owned Taylor Made, Andale, Stringer and Jack Iron boats and enjoyed participating in regattas throughout tidewater Maryland, including the Governor’s Cup and St. Michaels races, Leukemia Cup and many Oxford races. He was also a regular participant with his son, Aubrey, in the weekly Tuesday Night Races in the Inner Harbor with the Baltimore City Yacht Association, of which he was a member. Good also raced with the Glenmar Sailing Association, and was a member of the Baltimore Yacht Club and Eastport Yacht Club.

Good and his wife of 57 years, the former Helen Marie “Susie” Guzzo, had lived for almost 50 years on Yorktown Drive in Towson before moving two years ago to The Meadows in Lutherville. The couple, who were known for their lavish Christmas decorations that won several neighborhood association awards and Christmas Eve parties, liked entertaining family and friends at parties throughout the year. Good enjoyed writing fiction, short stories and poetry, and family members said his correspondence, both business and personal, reflected both his dry wit and sarcasm. He was 16 when he began attending Towson Presbyterian Church, and over the years he had served as a deacon, elder and trustee. He had served as a member of the Pastor Search Committee and Organ Restoration Committee. Good was a daily reader of the Bible, family members said.

Church ’60, a retired civil engineer and conservationist who enjoyed trout fishing and collecting vintage toys, died July 22 from congestive heart failure at Gilchrist Center Towson. The longtime Anneslie resident was 86. The son of John Herbert Church and his wife, Beatrice Church, Thomas was born in Green Bay, Wisc., where he spent his early years until moving with his family in 1947 to Forest Park. Church was a descendant of Benjamin Church, one of the founders of Milwaukee. While living in Green Bay, he developed his lifelong passion for woodworking, fishing and the Green Bay Packers. He enrolled at Polytechnic Institute, which provided for the foundation of his engineering career, and offered him the opportunity to play lacrosse. In the 11th grade, he transferred to Forest Park High School, where he continued playing lacrosse. After graduating in 1952 from Forest Park, he enlisted in the Marine Corps, and as he reached Korea the armistice was signed. He spent the next three years in the region until being discharged in 1955 with the rank of corporal. Church earned his civil engineering degree in 1960 from the University of Maryland, where he also played varsity lacrosse. A summer internship at the old J.E. Greiner Co., which specialized in bridge design, led to a full-time job. He worked there for 15 years, until 1971, when he joined Kidde Consultants. He headed its planning and development department, first in Rockville, and later in Towson. Projects he worked on during that time included the John F. Kennedy Highway and the Masonville Marine Terminal in Fairfield. In 1985, Church and Sam Shockley, a Kidde Consulting colleague, established Development Engineering Consultants on York Road in Anneslie. The firm specialized in designing and managing the development of more than 100 residential and commercial properties throughout the state. Church was a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers and sat on numerous state and national engineering councils. He was a conservationist, a lifetime member of Trout Unlimited, and participated in numerous stream restoration projects around Baltimore. He was also an inveterate wildfowl hunter as well as an accomplished woodworker who enjoyed working in his home shop. He collected antique decoys, vintage toys, Lionel Standard Gauge electric trains, gum cards and cap pistols. Church also liked to race classic motorboats, shoot skeet and tend to his rose bushes, jade plants and irises. He and his wife moved to their home on Dunkirk Road in Anneslie in 1966, where they established an annual Christmas Eve carol singalong and set up a Christmas garden that featured model trains from his collection. In addition to his wife and son, Church is survived by two daughters, Kathleen Weidner of Charlesbrooke and Joyce Webster of Cockeysville; a sister, Mercedes Hartman of Charleston, S.C.; 11 grandchildren; and a great-grandson.\n\nKatherine (Kay) R. Schimke '59 passed away on April 17 in Seattle. Born in 1937, in Oakland, to Max G. and Margaret R. Ricketts, she was the eldest of two daughters. During her early childhood, the family moved around, following her father, who worked for the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, making maps and charts. By the time she finished the second grade, she had already lived in 42 different states and attended nine different elementary schools. World War II put a stop to the constant moving and the family finally settled in Seattle. The family lived in Seattle until Schimke’s junior year of high school, when they moved to Maryland. There, she graduated and earned a degree in physical education from the University of Maryland. In Maryland, she spent her evenings and weekends going to the John Robert Powers Modeling School while beginning her public school teaching career, which led her to San Francisco. In San Francisco, she met Jerry Schimke. They married in 1964, a marriage that lasted 51 years until Jerry’s passing. Together, they moved to Massachusetts, where they both had found work. The arrival of two children, Margaret and Karl, brought Schimke’s full-time teaching career to an end, but allowed her the opportunity to excel at what she did best: connecting with people. While in Concord, Mass., Schimke spent much of her time raising her children, co-leading the Trinitarian Congregational Church Youth Group, delivering Meals on Wheels and acting in the Concord Players Community Theater. Her work with the youth group went far beyond the norm. She and her husband became surrogate parents for many of the young people in the group, remaining in close contact with many for decades. In 1981, a change in Jerry’s work meant another move, this time to Davis, Calif. Schimke rapidly joined the University Farm Circle Newcomers, a group that welcomes those new to the community. Through Farm Circle, she was often one of the first to greet those new to Davis, which led to many friendships lasting more than 30 years. These friendships were the starting point to numerous groups in which Schimke was active: book clubs, gourmet groups, and “Knitwits.” In Davis, Schimke gave back to her sorority, serving as the house manager of the Delta Gamma sorority house for many years. During her time in Davis, Schimke discovered another passion: colors. She became a color consultant for Beauty for all Seasons and proceeded to give fashion and make-up advice to hundreds, if not thousands, of people. Schimke loved spending hours talking with clients and showing them the difference color hues made in their appearance. In 2017, after Jerry had passed away, Schimke decided to return to Seattle to be closer to her daughter’s family. In her new home, The Hearthstone at Green Lake, she quickly found herself in a familiar role: greeting newcomers, connecting with people and being a compassionate friend. Above all else, Schimke was a beloved, engaged, compassionate and patient mother, grandmother and friend to those who survive her: daughter Margaret and her husband, Rick; son Karl and his wife, Katrin; grandchildren Maja, Olivia, Cece and William; sister Jean; and many dear friends.\n\nMathias J.
