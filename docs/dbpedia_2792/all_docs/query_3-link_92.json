        "text": "There is a fundamental contradiction or opposition at the core of your personality, but it does not shatter your integrity. However, it causes your inner world to be complex, divided, or even torn, without ever being totally dissociated, because every thought and action is a source of unification. As a result, intellectually you are a talented syncretist. You are able to see the link between heterogeneous and diverse elements which do not appear to be related in the least. You can bring about surprising reconciliation, create unexpected bonds, combine beliefs which seem mutually incompatible. Your imaginative powers also flow from the division in your psyche and are evidenced by inspirations, visions, and abilities which exceed the context of logic and reasoning. You allow yourself to be guided by irrational phenomena like foreshadowing or premonitions, which well up from the depths of your being. You are more of a medium than an intuitive, because intuition requires a clear consciousness of reality. You are borne along by currents and tides of knowledge and live in symbiosis with forces which overwhelm you. In fact, it is because of this relative passivity that you are more or less a medium, because you wish merely to perceive what surrounds you; you have no wish to impose your will. Although this attitude endows you with great potential for productivity, it may also become dangerous, if you find yourself overpowered by forces you can never totally control. You tend to perceive things as undifferentiated; you do not always see the world as an organized, structured, hierarchical entity. Instead, you are sensitive to energy flows, to invisible forces which you perceive and try to interpret. Your consciousness knows no bounds, and you do not feel confined by either space or time. But the image of the infinite imprinted on your imagination has a tendency to manifest itself with a lack of definition, in most of your thoughts and acts. In relation to other people, you usually demonstrate warmth and humanism. You are a fairly pleasant companion, although your sensitivity can be annoying at times. You tend to identify with your friends to a great degree, instead of remaining apart and empathetic. In fact, you are capable of losing yourself in another person at times. You should take time to reflect upon the quality of what you bestow on others and on whom you bestow it. You would doubtless come to the conclusion that your devotion is motivated by guilt feelings; your giving is a way of escaping from yourself, and your broad tolerance sometimes merely hides a weak character. Your basic aptitude for compassion could inspire\n\nAb-Soul tends to place his emotions in the forefront. He is sensitive and sometimes vulnerable to influences from the outer world.\n\nHe needs others to fulfill himself and accomplish his ambitions.\n\nAt the time of your birth, your rising sign was located in Gemini (the Twins), while the sun was passing through the sign of Pisces (the Fish). A summary of the various clues mentioned above provide your personality profile. The following key words capture the essence of your character and indicate certain contradictions which may be sources of tension:\n\nNeed for contact – Hypersensitivity – Mental agitation – Pliancy – Frivolity – Humility and reserve – Dilettantism – Idealism – Communication – Intuition – Inner duality – Premonition.\n\nThe amount of inner opposition you are dealing with, involving emotional inclinations and intellectual ones, may make your behavior somewhat erratic and confusing. By working to overcome your hypersensitivity to outer influences, you will bolster your assertiveness and identity. As you reach maturity, however, you are certain to find an opportunity to derive some reward from your mental and social qualities. The faculties of adaptation and assimilation you possess will become increasingly rare among your peers – a great benefit to you.\n\nBorn in the seven to ten days after the full moon rose, you are of the “last quarter” lunar type. As a result, your personality is fairly independent and self-sufficient. Your ideas are original and often bold, but, to your dismay, do not often garner a majority of followers. Your sense of humor is your best communications tool, but you often switch to a more severe tone which breaks your charm over your audience, and your methods do not always please the masses. Your lack of flexibility hinders your strategies and projects, and you would gain by developing your sense of diplomacy and tact. Although you are not unduly attached to success, because you are so used to being ahead of your time, your failures take a psychological toll on you. Because each setback wears you down a little more, you should try to avoid further disappointments by conforming to contemporary reality a little more closely.\n\nThis relationship could yield a high degree of psychological compatibility and powerful mutual attraction. The physical and psychological reality of their personalities will exert a magnetic pull over the sensitivity, receptivity, tenderness, and other key qualities of their partner.\n\nTheir moon is located at 7° CAPRICORN. Their ideal match is a partner with the sun at 1/13° CAPRICORN or CANCER.\n\nAb-Soul would be ideally suited to someone who mirrors his underlying psychic and unconscious aspirations. The secret ideal you cherish of the perfect partner would be aroused; it would harmonize beautifully with your ideal imaginary lover. This great psychic compatibility is the result of a harmonious relationship between the Moon of the masculine chart and the sun of the feminine one. It is propitious to a rich flow of energies between the most hidden and secret parts of both people. They are linked by an unconscious emotional bond.\n\nAb-Soul’s Venus is located at 21° CAPRICORN. His ideal match is a partner with Mars at 15/27° CAPRICORN or CANCER.\n\nThis type of partner would complement you perfectly in emotional and sentimental terms. This person would reflect and fulfill your ideal of sensuality to the greatest degree. Moreover, your ideal partner would resonate lastingly with your own psychic projections of your ideal. This positive relationship between the unconscious sexual yearnings of both partners would be likely to yield sensual relations of a tantalizingly mysterious and secret nature.\n\nYou have a very raw sensitivity, and you try to protect yourself by adopting a somewhat reserved and distant attitude. Cautious and a bit wary about committing yourself to an amorous relationship, you cannot relax your inhibitions unless you feel completely safe. Once you’re in love, you are both passionate and cold, demanding and devoted, possessive but reasonable. You do not readily express your affections in public and may have a fairly practical, down-to-earth attitude toward the relationship. You would be well-matched with such a partner who is serious and in control of themselves. Because this person, too, is wary of being disappointed, they will not engage in an intimate relationship without clear knowledge that their budding feelings are reciprocated. However, once they make their mind up, they will be extremely faithful, affectionate, and tender.\n\nAb-Soul’s planet is located at 2 degrees Taurus. His ideal match is someone with Venus at 0 degrees Taurus or Scorpio."
