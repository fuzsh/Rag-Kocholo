        "text": "There are times in our lives when we are presented with a choice that is of such consequence that the rest of our lives will be impacted by the significance of that choice. You no doubt can think back over your life and pinpoint a small handful of such choices. I would contend that on Nov. 2, 2010 you and I are being called on to make one such choice.\n\nThis is the choice: Will you vote for the status quo, for more of the same, for a person who chooses to ignore the people by snubbing any and every debate and forum that is offered to him? In short will you vote for Mr. Chuck Fleischmann, the Republican trial lawyer nominee who 7 out of 10 Republicans voted against in the primary? Or will you follow your core principles, listen to your conscience, refuse to be denied and seek out the one authentic, constitutional and social conservative: Major Savas Kyriakidis.\n\nFollowing weeks of prayer, deliberation and seeking, I am thankful to unreservedly express my support for Major Savas Kyriakidis. Just as Savas answered the call to serve his country militarily, he is now answering the call to serve his country once again in the halls of Congress as our Representative in Washington.\n\nI have met with Savas now on a number of occasions, I have asked him the tough questions, I have prayed with him, and I am convinced that Savas will be a stalwart defender of the Constitution and will champion those principles for which our Founders fought and died. He is a small business man who owns and runs the Acropolis Restaurant. Savas is a man of great integrity, a fiscal conservative, a committed born again follower of Christ and someone who will serve our District with great humility.\n\nLike all of us, Savas is not a perfect man, but his years in the military have honed him into someone with great leadership qualities. While Washington too often intoxicates good men and women with its power and prestige, Savas maintains a uniquely distinct reason for seeking this position - it is one of service to not only the citizens of the District but, more importantly, to his Lord and Savior.\n\nAs you deliberate over your choice for Congress during this upcoming election, I would encourage you to consider Savas.\n\nNo longer do you have to just accept the \"lesser of\" - this time you do have a choice. As a member of the Chattanooga Tea Party I am honored to cast my vote for Savas. I trust you too will join me in choosing Savas Kyriakidis.\n\nMark West\n\nOoltewah\n\n* * *\n\nSavas Kyriakidis is not owned by the either party or corporate business. If he is owned by anyone it would be you and I, the citizens of the district."
