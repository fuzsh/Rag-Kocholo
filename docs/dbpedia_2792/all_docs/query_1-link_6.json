        "text": "Tommy A. Savas is an American actor who portrayed Daniel on FOX's 9-1-1.\n\nHistory[]\n\nCareer[]\n\nHis big break came at age 15 when he was selected from 15,000 actors to play the role of Xavier, AJ Soprano’s high school friend in the HBO series, The Sopranos. After The Sopranos, Savas had a guest starring role in Law and Order: Special Victims Unit and a part in the Tribeca Film Festival award-winning film, Roger Dodger.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Savas moved out to Los Angeles to pursue his already burgeoning career and was quickly chosen to appear in Cold Case, Without a Trace, Shark, The New Adventures of Old Christine, General Hospital and many others. He can also be seen in many national commercials such as Gillette, Nesquik, Guitar Hero, Pizza Hut and Subway.\n\nSavas formed Reckless Tortuga with a small group of friends in 2009 as a means of continually creating things and working even if they were not booking work professionally. Reckless Tortuga became a popular YouTube web-based comedy channel, where he has a recurring role as Damian in the webseries, The Online Gamer.\n\nIn 2014, Savas played Cossetti in Michael Bay's post-apocalyptic TV series The Last Ship. He also played the series regular Dashiell Greer in Katherine Heigl's NBC drama, State of Affairs, which was premiered in November 2014.\n\nIn 2015, Savas co-wrote and starred in the dark comedy Bad Roomies with Patrick Renna. The movie was partially funded through Kickstarter ($75,000 was raised).\n\nIn 2016, Savas was cast as Reggie in the ABC comedy pilot The Fluffy Shop, co-written by and starring Gabriel Iglesias.\n\nSavas jokingly said that Shia LaBeouf stole his career after they screen tested against each other for the role of a young Robert Downey Jr. in the movie A Guide to Recognizing your Saints and LeBoeuf was given the part.\n\n[]"
