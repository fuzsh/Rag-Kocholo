Magic Quadrant for Energy and Utilities Enterprise Asset Management Software

Energy and utility companies evaluate and procure enterprise asset management (EAM) products to resolve physical asset care requirements â€” that is, they provide maintenance support for fixed plants (such as power generation plants, water plants, refineries and offshore rigs), for linear distributed assets (such as power lines and pipelines), and/or for fleet assets (such as service equipment, transformers, pumping stations and wind generator towers). (Note: The term "energy and utilities" as used in this document includes oil and gas [upstream, midstream and downstream], power generation [fossil, nuclear, hydroelectric and renewables], electricity transmission and distribution, gas transmission and distribution, and water/wastewater.)

An EAM solution includes planning and scheduling, work order creation, maintenance history, and inventory and procurement, as well as equipment, component and asset tracking for assemblies of equipment. In some instances, the functionality is extended by the addition of basic financial management modules, such as accounts payable, cost recording in ledgers, and HR functions such as a maintenance skills database.

Technically, the EAM applications are designed to scale to larger numbers of users (typically, more than 100 concurrent users) and run on multiple sites from a single central database, thereby catering to whole-of-business requirements, rather than departmental or site requirements. They should also be increasingly able to support cloud and hosted deployments, the use of mobile technology, and analytics.
