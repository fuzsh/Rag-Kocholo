        "text": "(1)\n\nAn inquiry into four anonymous letters that, during the course of this proceeding, were directed to various Commissioners, either participating or not participating in this matter; the subject of which pertained to Applicant’s financial ability to effectuate the proposed merger.11\n\n(3)\n\nAn inquiry into a plan for regulatory “Additional Amortizations” that appeared in the Applicant’s original application but was subsequently removed and is not being requested.\n\n(4)\n\nAn extensive inquiry into to KCPL’s Comprehensive Energy Plan (“CEP”) set forth in the Stipulation and Agreement approved by the Commission in Case No. EO-2005-0329, including the current reforecast of cost and schedule issues related to the Iatan Unit 1 and Unit 2 construction projects.\n\n(3)\n\nWhile the Commission believes that any purported evidence regarding a future plan for regulatory “Additional Amortizations” is irrelevant, it is not wholly irrelevant, and the Commission will preserve this evidence in the record as an offer of proof.\n\n(4)\n\nAn extensive inquiry into to KCPL’s CEP as set forth in the Stipulation and Agreement approved by the Commission in Case No. EO-2005-0329, including the current reforecast of cost and schedule issues related to the Iatan Unit 1 and Unit 2 construction projects is overly broad and the scope of any offered evidence in this regard will be restricted to: (1) The inter-relationship between the Iatan projects and Great Plains Energy’s acquisition of Aquila; (2) KCPL’s procurement function and asserted merger savings estimates; and (3) Credit agency debt rating information and debt ratings.\n\n(5)\n\nThe witnesses that the Applicant’s have requested to be released in this matter will not be released to the extent they can provide testimony on the Applicant’s credit-worthiness.\n\n(6)\n\nWitnesses from Aquila that were to provide testimony solely on the issue of the anonymous communications are released and do not have to appear before the Commission.\n\nb.\n\nSchedule JRM-8, Title (“with customers capturing 80% of the value”). Also, because the Applicants have withdrawn their request for approval of a synergy sharing mechanism, the designation of benefits flowing to “KCPL” and “Customers” in the bar graph and accompanying table in Schedule JRM-8 is no longer relevant. The “Total” figures depicted in the bar graph and chart, on the other hand, continue to be relevant.\n\nb.\n\nSchedule RTZ-12: Because the Applicants have withdrawn their request for approval of a synergy sharing mechanism, the designation of benefits flowing to “GPE” and “Customers” in the table on Schedule RTZ-12 is no longer relevant. The “Total” figures, on the other hand, continue to be relevant.\n\n•\n\nSecond, the levels of Uncollectible Accounts cost are heavily influenced by the rules of the local regulatory jurisdiction, primarily those regarding disconnection procedures (multiple warning notices, time periods to disconnect). These rules can expand or shrink a utility’s revenue exposure on overdue accounts, vs. other utilities in other states, for reasons not directly related to a company’s effectiveness in managing such accounts. Uncollectible Accounts costs are less controllable by utility management.\n\n•\n\nThird, Uncollectible Accounts costs are more closely related to the level of fuel and purchased power costs than the level of non-fuel O&M expenses. When fuel and purchased power costs are high, and push up the total bill to customers, one would expect more customers to have difficulty paying their bill.\n\nF.\n\nConclusions of Law Regarding the Application of the “Not Detrimental to the Public Interest” Standard – Application of the Balancing Test989\n\nH.\n\nConclusions of Law Regarding Other Potential Conditions to Place on the Approval of the Merger1001\n\na.\n\nGreat Plains Energy, Incorporated will not be allowed to recover transaction costs associated with the transactions from ratepayers;\n\nb.\n\nWithin ninety days of the effective date of this Report and Order, Kansas City Power & Light Company, and Aquila, Inc., shall execute and file with the Commission a joint operating agreement;\n\nc.\n\nGreat Plains Energy, Incorporated, Kansas City Power & Light Company, and Aquila, Inc., shall, upon closure of the authorized transactions, implement a synergy savings tracking mechanism as described by the Applicants, and in the body of this order, utilizing a base year of 2006;"
