While the industry is highly competitive, Panda CRM benefits from several competitive advantages, as outlined above, allowing the Company to differentiate itself from the current field and capture a decent percentage of the overall market. BARRIERS TO ENTRY The following is an analysis of the barriers to entry that businesses within the software industry face: Market Saturation Examples  Panda CRM The most significant barrier to entry is market saturation in both the CRM and ASP industries. Unless a new entrant to the market can significantly differentiate itself from its competitors, there are many applications that offer the same or similar features. Furthermore, the differentiating features must be proprietary or not easily replicated; otherwise, competition can implement these features before the new entrant can capture a significant enough share to establish itself as a leading Beta and Usability Testing Examples  Panda CRM Although not a strict barrier to entry, the beta and usability test period for software applications is critical. The functionality and stability of Panda CRM will be important to “get right” the first time given how quickly technology changes and how discerning CRM users are. It will be important to establish a reputation for a quality product starting from the beta and usability test period. As current CRM customers are concerned with their user experience, providing a top-‐tier program Read More  Read More  2019 Business Plan | CRM Software 17 / 43\n\n19. Patents & Copyrights Examples  Panda CRM Patents and copyright infringement can be a large barrier for small or start-‐up businesses within the software industry. While there are ongoing debates over the need for software patents, large companies who own large shares of the market may threaten smaller businesses with patent litigation. In such cases, smaller businesses are generally forced to settle due to the high costs of defending the suit in court. Panda CRM has and will continue to avoid any current patent and Read More  2019 Business Plan | CRM Software 18 / 43\n\n20. MARKET ANALYSIS Market Snapshot Start Writing here...
