The modern design of the system addresses the complex organizational and data issues created by the collaborative nature of genome investigations. Central to the power of the software is the rich computer representation and semantics of biological objects and scientific processes. Its framework allows the researcher to seamlessly move data from one step to the next and from one organization to another, across multiple computer platforms. A unified user interface provides access to both proprietary and public domain data analysis tools and algorithms. Information flows across both internet and intranet to facilitate worldwide communication. Genomica software thus allows the scientist to drive the gene discovery and functional analysis process rapidly, efficiently and effectively. It provides a more focused approach to uncovering gene candidates, and turning gene candidates into targets for drug discovery.\n\nAdded in 1998\n\nGenomica Corporation\n\nBoulder, Colorado USA\n\nHave used Smalltalk/VisualWorks since 1990.
