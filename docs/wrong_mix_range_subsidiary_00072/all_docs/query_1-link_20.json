        "text": "Asset-intensive organizations evaluate and procure enterprise asset management (EAM) products to address physical asset care requirements. These products provide management support for maintenance of:\n\nFixed plants such as power generation, manufacturing, oil refineries and equipment\n\nLinear distributed assets such as power lines, rail and pipelines\n\nMobile and fixed fleet assets such as service equipment, trucks, transformers, pumping stations and wind generator towers\n\nThis report focuses on the asset-intensive industry (particularly manufacturing, natural resources, transportation and utilities).\n\nAn EAM solution includes functionality for managing, planning and scheduling; work order creation; maintenance history; and inventory and procurement; as well as equipment, component and asset tracking for assemblies of equipment. In some instances, the functionality is extended by the addition of basic financial management modules such as accounts payable, cost recording in ledgers and HR functions such as maintenance skills databases.\n\nFor asset-intensive organizations with complex requirements, the functionality provided must be capable of managing:\n\nHierarchical plant structures\n\nPreventive maintenance\n\nOutage/shutdown planning for refurbishments\n\n\"Fleet\" capability, not just for vehicles, but also for fleets of assets such as oil fields or wind farms\n\nTracking and managing of operational technology (OT) devices and systems\n\nThis is reflected in the requirements listed here, most of which will be satisfied by the best-in-class software products in this category:\n\nDetailed asset registry, combined with internal and external parts and support descriptions (core EAM) and the ability to define and maintain hierarchical and list-based asset and component structures.\n\nLong-term maintenance, project and work schedules (core EAM), including assigning tasks to resources for job completion over a period of time.\n\nSupport for complex (alternative manufacturers and alternative suppliers) inventory relationships for indirect maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) that are associated with forecasting planned and unplanned work on installed assets (core EAM). This includes an internal catalog of replacement parts linked to assets and components that is used for managing single-location and multilocation inventory records of spare parts.\n\nSupply chain capability for indirect goods, with demand planning linked to maintenance and repair schedules (core EAM), enabling requesting parts and materials for both stocked and nonstocked items. Capability of procurement management and supplier management.\n\nProbability-based, \"just in case\" MRO-focused inventory and procurement, rather than \"just in time\" or MRP-based inventory.\n\nUnplanned job reporting/requesting — capability for end users to report faults or failures and have them acted on as part of a job plan.\n\nPreventative maintenance (time-based) — creating recurring maintenance jobs based on a time schedule.\n\nHuman capital management capabilities to match skills, training and availability with work requirements.\n\nStatistical analysis of equipment performance and reliability — standard reports and analytics for management oversight of operations, as well the ability to develop custom reports.\n\nAbility to accept condition-based triggers for creating work orders.\n\nSerial number tracking and tracing for equipment and parts.\n\nFinancial support via detailed cost analysis.\n\nWarranty tracking to component levels and support for manufacturers' records requirements for equipment under warranty.\n\nShutdown project planning.\n\n\"Lock out/tag out\" or \"permit to work\" functions.\n\nEnablement of both connected and disconnected application usage for mobile workers.\n\nCapital construction planning (and for utilities, compatible unit estimating).\n\nInclusion of fleet maintenance support functionality for vehicles and nonvehicle assets. Defining and managing a replicated set of repeated assets to manage the data collectively and individually.\n\nSupport for the management of \"smart\" field devices and software-based systems such as operational technology (OT) and the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nLinear asset management — defining and maintaining linear structures (pipes, wires, rail, roads) within the EAM systems in a dynamic and flexible way, including offsets and intersects and integration with GIS.\n\nTechnically, the EAM applications are designed to scale to more than 100 concurrent users and run on multiple sites from a single central database (as opposed to a computerized maintenance management system [CMMS], which is typically a small-scale, single-site application). Thus, they cater to whole-of-business requirements, rather than departmental or site requirements. They should also be able to support cloud or hosted deployments. Finally, where applicable, they should be designed to integrate with other relevant enterprise applications — such as financials, procurement and HR — necessary for managing the business of asset-intensive organizations.\n\nEAM does not include asset performance management (APM) or asset investment planning (AIP), although some EAM vendors provide a subset of APM or AIP functionality (typically in a separate product). In addition, most EAM vendors have partnerships with APM and/or AIP vendors. This Market Quadrant does not rate the APM or AIP functionality of the EAM vendors but does assign credit for having some capability and for having strategic partnerships (see \"Market Guide for Asset Performance Management\" and \"Technology Overview for Utility Asset Investment Planning\" for more on these products).\n\nMagic Quadrant\n\nSource: Gartner (November 2017)\n\nVendor Strengths and Cautions\n\nABB (Asset Suite)\n\nABB is an approximately $34 billion power and industrial automation company based in Zurich, Switzerland. ABB's Enterprise Software group is the result of a number of acquisitions, most notably its acquisition of Ventyx in 2010 (Gartner estimates EAM revenue of $191 million). The Asset Suite product has been focused almost exclusively on the EAM market for power generation and utilities. Asset Suite is primarily deployed at large utilities in North America, with some large deployments in Europe and success in the Asia/Pacific region. The company offers two EAM products, this one (Asset Suite) and Ellipse, separately evaluated below.\n\nAsset Suite 9.4.0 is the latest release and supports all core EAM functionality. It is the first version built on a modern, web-based architecture and replaces the COBOL-based product. Mobility (Action Manager) and analytics are included. However, ABB does sell a couple of separate mobile products, including a mobile workforce management (MWM) product called Service Suite and an operator rounds product called eSOMS. Reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) capability is included in Asset Suite. Separate, but complementary, is ABB's Asset Health Center APM product and Electronic Work Package (eWP) through ABB's partner DataGlance.\n\nStrengths\n\nAsset Suite has a strong presence in nuclear power generation.\n\nWithin its target industries, it is a highly scalable solution, suitable for large, multifaceted enterprise deployments.\n\nAsset Suite targets power generation (including nuclear), chemical, oil and gas, and pulp and paper.\n\nABB is developing an integrated view of connected assets linking OT systems, mobility, APM and asset management.\n\nCustomers report high satisfaction with the product meeting their needs, good service responsiveness and ease of deployment.\n\nCautions\n\nCustomers' report that Asset Suite is a higher-cost EAM solution to deploy and maintain with a low rating for ease of ERP integration.\n\nIt has very limited presence outside of power generation, transmission and distribution.\n\nThe 9.4.0 version has a limited track record in deployment.\n\nThere is potential confusion and dilution of efforts with maintaining two EAM products in overlapping markets.\n\nABB (Ellipse)\n\nABB is an approximately $34 billion power and industrial automation company based in Zurich, Switzerland. It offers two EAM products, this one (Ellipse) and Asset Suite, separately evaluated above.\n\nABB's Enterprise Software Group (Gartner estimates EAM revenue of $191 million) is the result of a number of acquisitions, and the Ellipse product came to ABB via its acquisition of Mincom in 2011. The Ellipse product is installed in a number of different asset-centric industries, with utilities representing approximately a quarter of its customer base. The geographic distribution of its customer base is broad, with 40% of its customers in Australia (its home base), 40% in the Americas and 20% in EMEA.\n\nEllipse 8.9 is the latest release and supports all core EAM functionality, including linear assets support within the product. ABB has introduced Ellipse Select, a preconfigured version of Ellipse that embeds a standard configuration into the product. Separate but complementary, is ABB's Asset Health Center APM product. ABB is also reselling the Fieldreach mobility suite, which was developed in the U.K. by Ellipse partner AMT-Sybex. ABB partners with Microsoft for analytics. Ellipse also integrates with the ABB LinkOne parts visualization tool and Axis procure-to-pay solution.\n\nStrengths\n\nIt is flexibly deployed as a point EAM solution or a comprehensive ERP suite, complete with financials, and is highly scalable.\n\nIt has a global client base (particularly Australia and the U.S.) and support resources, including significant channel sales of 35%.\n\nIt has a strong customer base and experience in utilities, transport, mining and natural resources.\n\nCautions\n\nLicense and maintenance costs are reported at the high end of the scale for EAM.\n\nABB's partner network is still undeveloped, and its own Ellipse implementation resources, outside of utilities and mining, are limited.\n\nVery limited use in manufacturing and unproven in other asset-intensive subsectors.\n\nThere is potential confusion and dilution of efforts with maintaining two EAM products in overlapping markets.\n\nVery negative customer reference ratings in user satisfaction and quality and capability of product.\n\neMaint\n\neMaint is a CMMS/EAM solution provider based in Bonita Springs, Florida, and acquired in 2016 by Fluke, a manufacturer of industrial testing equipment. Gartner estimates EAM revenue of approximately $22 million. Additional office locations are in Europe and India.\n\neMaint 11.4.0 is the latest release. This EAM/CMMS product is sold as a cloud solution, primarily targeting smaller organizations (up to $500 million revenue) in manufacturing, oil and gas, and chemicals. A mobile extension, eMaint MX Mobile, supports access via smartphones, tablets and mobile computers through a browser-enabled user interface. The relationship with Fluke provides for integration with a wide ecosystem of SCADA integration (Schad), wirelessly connected tools (Fluke Connect tools), remote monitoring sensors (Fluke Sensors) and maintenance software (Fluke Connect).\n\nStrengths\n\neMaint has a large number of customers globally, particularly in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, primarily in manufacturing, oil and gas, utilities, and public sector.\n\nThe product is sold as a subscription service, resulting in a low cost to license and deployment that is readily scalable.\n\nReferences report a high degree of satisfaction with product value and support.\n\nThe product is well-suited to clients seeking a simple, straightforward EAM solution with minimal footprint and disruption.\n\nCautions\n\nThere are a limited number of eMaint customers with large-scale deployments.\n\nComplex maintenance (linear and fleet) and MRO supply chain capability are limited, compared to other EAM systems.\n\nThere is limited availability of third-party resources; some references report negative sentiment about end-user training, although it is accessible online.\n\nOffline mobile workforce capability, released in March 2017, currently has limited functionality.\n\nIBM\n\nIBM is an approximately $80 billion global technology and consulting corporation with headquarters in Armonk, New York. Its Maximo Asset Management product is positioned in IBM's Watson IoT group. Gartner estimates EAM software revenue of $295 million. Maximo is deployed in a broad cross section of asset-intensive subsectors around the globe, including mining, oil and gas, utilities, power, transportation, manufacturing, and aviation.\n\nMaximo 7.6 is the latest major release of the product and provides support for linear assets and calibration, in addition to the full set of core EAM functionality. IBM provides a Maximo SaaS offering, built/deployed on top of IBM's cloud infrastructure. Bluemix IBM also provides two mobile technology options — Maximo Everyplace and Maximo Anywhere. The former is the legacy product for connected (Everyplace) modes and is now included in Maximo. For disconnected (Anywhere) modes of operation, Maximo Anywhere is the new mobile platform built on the IBM MobileFirst product. IBM also offers several industry solutions with enhanced functionality. The company is internally developing a predictive maintenance capability and partnering with MaxGrip and GE Digital for aspects of APM.\n\nStrengths\n\nMaximo is a highly scalable product with a large global customer base.\n\nThe product is suitable for both small and very large enterprises.\n\nThe product supports a broad range of functionality, including the extended functionality found in its industry solutions, to support all industry subsectors.\n\nReferences rate the product capabilities highly.\n\nThe company has strong involvement with industry trends such as PAS55 and ISO 55000 support and certification.\n\nCautions\n\nReferences, customers and prospects report that costs and time to deploy and maintain are at the high end of the EAM market and say the product is below average in value for money, despite the offered functionality.\n\nCan be very complex to configure and support the extensive features.\n\nCustomers report below-average satisfaction with IBM contract engagement and product support, and they report low ease of deployment and integration.\n\nMobile strategy has been evolving over the past several years, with the Maximo Anywhere product still gaining traction.\n\nIBM doesn't directly offer on-site training but does offer free online courses. Despite a wide base of third-party service providers, references rank end-user training low.\n\nIFS\n\nIFS is a $430 million global enterprise application software vendor based in Linkoping, Sweden. Gartner estimates EAM software revenue as $74 million. The company sells ERP, field service management (FSM) and EAM systems, including delivering its EAM module as a point solution or as part of the ERP suite. IFS sells its products to midsize-to-large enterprises in a wide range of industries with significant maintenance and construction requirements — including energy and utilities, nuclear, oil and gas, manufacturing, mining, pulp and paper, and aerospace.\n\nIFS Applications 9 is the latest release of the IFS ERP/EAM product. It has extensions for fleet and linear assets, compatible units, GIS integration and field workforce scheduling. IFS recently updated its mobile strategy (using HTML5+Cordova for smaller apps and Xamarin for larger apps), and is available on iOS, Android and Windows. IFS partners with BAE Systems to deliver a reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) module. The company has acquired MXi Technologies for aviation maintenance, but that remains a separate product. A subscription-based cloud offering is planned to be available in late 2017.\n\nStrengths\n\nThe product supports a broad range of EAM functionality, can be deployed in all industry subsectors and scales to large installations.\n\nIFS's references report high levels of satisfaction with integration and deployment, service levels, and value for money, and with relatively lower license implementation and maintenance fees.\n\nIFS's EAM functionality is preintegrated to the IFS Applications suite of enterprise applications, including financials, procurement and HR, but references also report ease of integration with other ERP products.\n\nApplications support data replication for operating in remote operations in a disconnected mode.\n\nSupport and close involvement with industry standards such as ISO 55000, and compliant with 21 CFR Part 11.\n\nCautions\n\nCustomers report concerns with contract negotiation, ease in dealing with the vendor, end-user training and software support timeliness.\n\nIFS's mainly European asset-intensive customer base is weighted toward Western Europe, resulting in fewer experienced resources outside those areas.\n\nIts oil and gas industry presence is mainly drillers and oil field service organizations.\n\nCustomer base for the current release lags, compared to other vendors.\n\nInfor\n\nInfor is an approximately $3 billion global enterprise application software vendor based in New York. Gartner estimates EAM software revenue at $146 million. Infor's EAM product (Infor acquired Datastream 7i) had been focused mainly on manufacturing. Infor has broadened its EAM product focus across multiple industries such as manufacturing, utilities, healthcare, facilities, transit, public sector (including state/local, federal and transit), life sciences, and transportation.\n\nInfor EAM 11.3.1 is the latest release, and it supports core EAM functionality such as planning, work orders, inventory and procurement. It also has a proven mobile product called Infor EAM Mobile on Android, iOS and Windows. Support for linear assets was added in a 1Q16 release. Infor EAM also supports some basic RCM functionality such as reliability calculations and risk matrices. For more advanced RCM functionality, Infor has a partnership with MaxGrip.\n\nStrengths\n\nFulfills all the criteria for a leader in Gartner's segment descriptions and delivered as SaaS or on-premises.\n\nIt has high user satisfaction ratings for quality of EAM software, user groups and peer community, and customer experience.\n\nInfor EAM is relatively easy and cost-effective to upgrade and maintain and is highly scalable.\n\nGood availability of third-party resources.\n\nSupport and close involvement with industry standards such as ISO 55000, and compliant with 21 CFR Part 11.\n\nCautions\n\nCustomers report below-average satisfaction with software integration and deployment ease.\n\nSome customer concerns with quality of technical support.\n\nFor government and utilities, Infor has two products — EAM and Infor Public Sector — that overlap for maintenance capabilities, which may cause confusion in the market. These are on different platforms, and the assessment here is solely on Infor EAM.\n\nMainsaver\n\nMainsaver is a relatively small ($10 million to $20 million), independent, stand-alone EAM software vendor based in San Diego. It is privately held by investors, who purchased the Mainsaver product from Titan in 2002. Mainsaver targets small-to-midsize enterprises, and is designed specifically for fixed-plant environments such as manufacturing and power generation. It has been widely deployed by independent power producers, including both conventional and renewables. It is primarily focused on North American markets, but has a growing partnership network outside the continent.\n\nMainsaver 12.8.1 is the latest version, and it supports core EAM functionality, including planning, work orders, inventory and procurement. It also offers a mobile deployment option called Mainsaver Connect on Windows, which is also available on iOS and Android. It has a third-party partnership for analytics functionality.\n\nStrengths\n\nMainsaver's references rate its product functionality, reliability, implementation and service levels highly. We believe that the narrower scope of product results in a much lower probability of project dissatisfaction for customers.\n\nThe product is relatively inexpensive, easy and quick to deploy and upgrade, and well-suited to clients seeking a simple, straightforward EAM solution with minimal disruption.\n\nThe company has a proven cloud-based EAM option and significant experience in subscription-based cloud delivery.\n\nReferences report high satisfaction in contract negotiations and dealing with the vendor.\n\nCautions\n\nThe product is primarily installed at small, stand-alone facilities, not enterprise deployments.\n\nIt has a limited presence outside of North America, but is growing via partners in Europe and Asia.\n\nThe product has limited third-party support available in the market.\n\nProduct functionality, particularly in analytics, is more limited than with top-tier EAM systems.\n\nThe product does not offer linear assets or fleet management industry extensions.\n\nOracle\n\nOracle is an approximately $38 billion global technology company with headquarters in Redwood Shores, California. Gartner estimates EAM software revenue as $62 million. Oracle's Work and Asset Management (WAM) is an EAM product brought in through the acquisition of SPL WorldGroup (which had acquired the Synergen product) in 2006. Oracle Utilities Global Business Unit is based in San Francisco, in a location separate from the main Oracle headquarters. Oracle WAM 2.2 is the latest version of the product. It supports the full set of EAM functionality, as well as linear assets. WAM v2 is based on new architecture (no longer Oracle Forms-based) and is designed to support improved configurability and integration. Oracle also provides Operational Device Management (ODM), a product to manage the maintenance of intelligent devices in the field — including smart meters — via WAM. WAM supports APM and basic RCM functionality. Mobile functionality is supported by a separate Mobile Workforce Management (Oracle MWM) on Windows, iOS and Android.\n\nStrengths\n\nOracle's references rate its ease of integration and overall value near the top of its peers. References also rate highly the ease of dealing with the vendor on product and support issues.\n\nOracle has a dedicated asset solutions unit with sales and consulting expertise focused on the market.\n\nIncludes embedded intrinsic APM and asset health capabilities and includes operational device management (support of OT systems).\n\nThe product is particularly well-suited for deployment to support a range of municipal services, including electrical distribution and water/wastewater, and Oracle Utilities has a good understanding of this market segment.\n\nOracle can deliver to a wide geographic market with this product.\n\nWAM is part of a broader set of utility industry functionality such as customer information management (CIS) and outage management systems (OMSs) that is delivered to mainly public-sector utilities.\n\nCautions\n\nOracle has a global presence; however, the majority of the deployment is in North America, with less presence in the rest of the world — leading to a shortfall in experienced resources.\n\nThe product has a small (historical) presence in other industries, but is current targeted at utilities and city governments.\n\nDue to the development process, functionality is available in the on-premises version first, before being available in the cloud (e.g., compatible unit functionality for utilities, at the time of writing).\n\nCustomer references express concern about pricing and contract flexibility negotiation, as well as ease of deployment.\n\nReferences also reported low satisfaction in meeting their organizations' needs and the availability of knowledgeable third-party resources.\n\nRamco Systems\n\nRamco Systems is part of the Ramco Group of companies — a large, diversified conglomerate. Gartner estimates EAM software revenue at $7 million. Headquartered in Chennai, India, Ramco Systems has offices in all geographic regions. The vendor provides ERP and HCM suites, along with an MRO solution, primarily for the aviation and logistics, power, and manufacturing markets. Market penetration is mainly in India, the Middle East and Asia, but the company also has customers across North America, Europe and Asia (including ANZ).\n\nRamco Enterprise Series 5.3 is the latest version, and it supports EAM within a broad ERP software package. It also offers a mobile deployment option for specific functions, and is available on iOS, Windows and Android. It has native predictive analytics functionality. The company has set up an innovation lab co-funded by Singapore EDB, with Air France Industries KLM Engineering & Maintenance as anchor partner, to build innovative technology use cases around robotics, augmented reality, blockchain and facial recognition in a maintenance scenario.\n\nDue to its specific vertical focus for EAM, Ramco has been featured as a Niche vendor in the Magic Quadrant.\n\nStrengths\n\nRamco has a proven cloud-based EAM offering and an on-premises version, and significant experience in subscription-based cloud delivery.\n\nWell-suited to aviation and aerospace needs, with significant calibration system experience and conforms to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) e-signature requirements.\n\nRamco has customers in most regions globally.\n\nCautions\n\nThere is limited awareness of the Ramco brand outside the Asia and Middle East regions, and the company offers only limited global capabilities in terms of localizations and languages, especially in Europe.\n\nCustomer base lags for the current release, possibly due to extensive customization during deployment.\n\nThe product has limited third-party support available in the market.\n\nCustomers report concerns with ease of deployment. They rank it low in satisfaction with meeting their organizations' needs and with end-user training.\n\nSAP\n\nSAP is an approximately $21 billion global enterprise application software vendor based in Walldorf, Germany. Gartner estimates EAM software revenue at $204 million. SAP offers a complete ERP suite, designed for a cross section of industries. Its EAM offering is used by a broad spectrum of, mostly large, asset-intensive organizations. Its EAM customers are located in every major region of the world.\n\nSAP is transitioning its customer base from ECC 6.0 to S/4HANA (on-premises or cloud). SAP pursues a cloud-first policy, so cloud-based EAM includes more up-to-date solutions than the on-premises version. Both products support all core EAM functionality, as well as extended functionality such as calibration, linear assets and compatible units. Mobile functionality is supported via the SAP Work Manager product (on-premises or cloud) and SAP Asset Manager (native iOS and cloud-based). Scheduling is supported by the Multiresource Scheduling (MRS) ERP extension, embedded S/4HANA Resource Scheduling (on-premises and cloud) and scheduling software from ClickSoftware (cloud only). SAP acquired Fieldglass, which brings with it a cloud-based contingent workforce management solution. For some APM capability, SAP has a partnership with both GE Digital and MaxGrip. SAP has its own SAP Predictive Maintenance and Service application (on-premises and cloud) available and is developing an additional application for asset performance and strategy management.\n\nStrengths\n\nSAP EAM is preintegrated to the SAP suite of enterprise applications, including financials, procurement and HR, and should be considered by organizations already invested in SAP ERP systems.\n\nSAP has a mature and extensive global community of EAM support resources and partners, minimizing implementation risks and support shortfalls.\n\nThe product is highly scalable and suitable for large and midsize enterprises across the full spectrum of asset-intensive industries.\n\nSAP has made significant investments relevant to EAM, including mobile, analytics and workforce management, as well as developments like Leonardo IoT Integration and Asset Intelligence Network capability, which are useful for Industrie 4.0 initiatives.\n\nReferences rate high satisfaction in dealing with the vendor, and vendor's adherence to SLAs and overall service and support.\n\nCautions\n\nSAP EAM remains best-suited to companies fully committed to using SAP ERP as a platform (e.g., Enterprise Central Component [ECC] and S/4HANA). It is not a practical candidate for a stand-alone EAM implementation or integrations with non-SAP ERP systems.\n\nThe S/4HANA product is newly released this year, and no references for S/4HANA EAM were available at the time of writing.\n\nCustomers report costs to deploy and maintain the product are at the high end of the EAM market, due to needing a broad ERP implementation to obtain EAM functionality.\n\nCustomers rate contract and pricing flexibility low, and low value in what the product provides for the money spent. References and customers consistently rate usability of the product as poor, although SAP's investments in simplified user experience show promise in addressing this perennial issue. There is also concern that user interface developments for the S/4HANA version will leave the ECC 6.0 users behind.\n\nSchneider Electric\n\nSchneider Electric is an approximately $28 billion electrical distribution and industrial automation company with headquarters in Paris. Schneider Electric's Avantis EAM product has a long history in the EAM market, having come to Schneider through its acquisition of Invensys. Although Avantis is found in a large cross section of industries around the world, approximately half of its revenue comes from a diverse set of energy and utilities subsectors (particularly hydro and water). There is increasing focus on manufacturing and infrastructure. While Schneider has a global presence, the Avantis product is best known in North America, where it originated — with growth in Europe and Asia.\n\nAvantis.PRO 6.0 is the latest version of the product and supports all core EAM functionality, as well as extended functionality such as linear assets and fleet management. In addition to offering core EAM functionality on mobile devices, Schneider has also integrated its IntelaTrac operator rounds product with Avantis to enable operators to initiate a work order based on an inspection finding. The acquisition of Prism has added intrinsic APM capability to Avantis. In 2016, Schneider Electric acquired MaxEAM, which provides advanced scheduling applications for mobile work, and is partnering with MaxGrip to provide embedded RCM capability.\n\nStrengths\n\nAvantis is a broadly used best-of-breed EAM solution suitable for most energy and utilities subsectors.\n\nSchneider is primarily an OT provider, and has invested in OT integration with Avantis to support condition-based maintenance.\n\nLower-than-average maintenance fees lead to lower long-term TCO.\n\nReferences rank the product highly for end-user training and quality of technical support.\n\nCustomers are in most regions globally.\n\nCautions\n\nThe product has a small number of large, multisite asset-intensive enterprise deployments.\n\nReferences rate product reliability, contract negotiation and ease of deployment near the bottom of its peers. References report limited third-party resource availability.\n\nIt is one of the few IT business applications in Schneider's predominantly OT and industrial portfolio.\n\nThere is minimal involvement in subscription-based cloud deployment.\n\nCustomer base significantly lags for the current release.\n\nSource : Gartner"
