Any Assigned Contract or Permit and License identified in such a notice (each, an “Excluded Contract”) shall no longer be an Assigned Contract or a Permit and License to be assigned to the Purchaser hereunder.\n\n(c) As of the Closing, the Purchaser shall bear, and make provision for the payment of, the cure and reinstatement costs and expenses (collectively, the “Cure Costs”) of the Assigned Contracts and Permits and Licences that are transferred to the Purchaser, the costs and expenses relating to the assumption and assignment of the Assigned Contracts, and any costs or other payments payable to such counter-party in excess of the Cure Costs at the Closing. The Seller shall be responsible for the verification of all Cure Costs, including all administrative responsibilities associated therewith, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to establish the proper Cure Costs, if any, for each Assigned Contract, including the filing and prosecution of any and all appropriate proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court or the Canadian Court.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, from and after the date hereof through the Closing Date, the Seller will not reject, without prior consent of the Purchaser, any Assigned Contract.\n\n(e) From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall be obligated to pay all amounts for services rendered and goods provided, in each case, from and after the Closing, under the Assigned Contracts in accordance with the terms and conditions of such Assigned Contracts.\n\nSECTION 5.02 Conduct of Business Prior to the Closing. The Seller covenants and agrees that, except as described in Section 5.02 of the Disclosure Schedule, between the date hereof and the Closing Date, and except as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases and Canadian Proceedings, the Seller, to the extent related solely to the Business and taking into account past practice, its current and projected financial condition and the condition of the markets in which the Business operates: (i) shall conduct its business in the ordinary course in all material respects; (ii) shall use its reasonable efforts to preserve intact in all material respects the business organization of the Business; and (iii) shall not:\n\n(A) grant or announce any increase in the salaries, bonuses or other benefits payable by the Seller to any of the employees to be offered employment by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 6.01, other than as required by Law, pursuant to any plans, programs or agreements existing on the date hereof or other ordinary increases consistent with the past practices of the Seller;\n\n(B) change any method of accounting or accounting practice or policy used by the Seller (as it relates to the Business), other than such changes required by GAAP;\n\n(C) fail to exercise any rights of renewal with respect to any material Leased Real Property that by its terms would otherwise expire; or\n\n(D) agree to take any of the actions specified in this Section 5.02, except as contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.\n\nSECTION 5.03 Access to Information.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Seller shall not be required to disclose any information to the Purchaser if such disclosure would, in the Seller’s sole discretion: (i) cause significant competitive harm to the Business if the Transactions are not consummated, (ii) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (iii) contravene any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date hereof. The Sellers will provide the Purchaser with copies of all Material Contracts and Timber Tenures by February 20, 2008.\n\nSECTION 5.04 Confidentiality. (a) The terms of the letter agreement dated as of August 29, 2007 (the “Confidentiality Agreement”) between PTI and the Purchaser are hereby incorporated herein by reference, and shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at which time the confidentiality and employee non-solicitation obligations of the Purchaser under the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate; provided, however, that such obligations shall terminate only in respect of that portion of the Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) and those employees exclusively relating to the Business. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect.\n\n(b) Nothing provided to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.03 shall in any way amend or diminish the Purchaser’s obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that any Evaluation Material provided to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.03 or otherwise by PTI or any Representative (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) thereof shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each party hereto (and its representatives, agents and employees) may consult any tax advisor regarding the tax treatment and tax structure of the Transactions, and may disclose to any person, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of such transactions and all materials (including opinions and other tax analyses) that are provided relating to such treatment or structure.\n\nSECTION 5.05 Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents. (a) The Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of all Governmental Authorities and officials that may be or become necessary for its execution and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and will cooperate fully with the Seller in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents, orders and approvals. Each party hereto agrees to make promptly its respective filing, if necessary, pursuant to the Competition Act (the costs of which shall be payable by the Purchaser) with respect to the Transactions within Twenty (20) Business Days of the date hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the Competition Act, and the Purchaser will promptly make all filings or notifications required under the ICA, if any. The Purchaser and Seller each agree that, during the term of this Agreement, it will not withdraw its filing under any applicable antitrust, competition or trade regulation law without the written consent of the other party. The Purchaser and Seller each agree that it will not enter into any timing agreement with any Governmental Authority without the written consent of the other party.

In addition, the Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the Closing by the Termination Date.\n\n(c) Each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the other parties of any communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and permit the other party to review in advance any proposed communication by such party to any Governmental Authority. None of the parties to this Agreement shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties to this Agreement will coordinate and cooperate fully with the other parties in\n\nexchanging such information and providing such assistance as such other parties may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods including under the Competition Act. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties to this Agreement will provide the other parties with copies of all correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions.\n\n(d) The Purchaser shall not take any action, or enter into any transaction or any agreement to effect any transaction (including any merger or acquisition but not including transactions or agreements in the ordinary course of business), that would reasonably be expected to make it more difficult to: (i) obtain the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Competition Act applicable to the purchase of the Purchased Assets contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) obtain the approval under any applicable antitrust, competition or trade regulation law, (iii) avoid the entry of, the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order that would prevent the completion of the Transactions, or (iv) obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of Governmental Authorities necessary for the consummation of the Transactions, in each case prior to the Termination Date.\n\nSECTION 5.06 Bulk Transfer Laws. The Purchaser hereby waives compliance by the Seller with any applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the sale of the Purchased Assets to the Purchaser, including the delivery of any clearance certificate under section 99 of the Social Services Act (British Columbia).\n\nSECTION 5.07 Further Action. The parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, to do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law, and to execute and deliver such documents and other papers, as may be required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and consummate and make effective the Transactions.\n\nSECTION 5.08 Tax Cooperation and Exchange of Information. The parties hereto will provide the other parties with such cooperation and information as may be reasonably requested in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, determining any liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes relating to the Purchased Assets or the Business. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules and related work papers and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by taxing authorities. Each of the parties will make themselves (and their respective employees) available, on a mutually convenient basis, to provide explanations of any documents or information provided under this Section 5.08. Each of the parties will retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers and all material records or other documents in its possession (or in the possession of its Affiliates) relating to Tax matters relevant to the Purchased Assets or the Business for the taxable period first ending after the Closing and for all prior taxable periods (the “Tax Documents”) until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to extensions, or (ii) six years following the due date (without extension)\n\nfor such Tax Returns. After such time, before any of the parties shall dispose of any such documents in its possession (or in the possession of its Affiliates), the other parties shall be given the opportunity, after 90 days’ prior written notice, to remove and retain all or any part of such documents as such other parties may select (at such other parties’ expense). In the event that a Seller is liquidated or otherwise ceases to be a going concern prior to the expiration of the period described in the second preceding sentence, such Seller shall offer the Purchaser the opportunity described in the preceding sentence (with 90 days’ prior written notice or such shorter period of notice as may be practicable) to remove and retain Tax Documents and such Seller may then dispose of any such documents not removed by Purchaser. If it is not practical to give the other party the right to retain Tax Documents, the other party may instead be given a reasonable opportunity to make copies, at its own expense of such Tax Documents. Any information obtained under this Section 5.08 shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.\n\nSECTION 5.09 Conveyance Taxes. (a) The Purchaser agrees to assume liability for and to pay all Conveyance Taxes incurred as a result of the Transactions.\n\n(b) GST. On the Closing Date the Purchaser and the Seller shall jointly elect under paragraph 167(1)(b) of the Excise Tax Act (Canada) in the prescribed form and containing the prescribed information to permit the Purchased Assets to be conveyed from the Seller to the Purchaser without GST being payable in respect of the sale and purchase of the Purchased Assets. The Purchaser and the Seller shall jointly complete the election form in respect of that election and the Purchaser will file the election form no later than the due date for the Purchaser’s GST return for the first reporting period in which GST would, in the absence of that election, become payable in connection with the Transactions and provide the Seller with a copy of the filed form. The Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller for any Taxes assessed against the Seller due to the Seller not collecting, as a result of entering into the election contemplated in this section with the Purchaser, any Taxes under the Excise Tax Act (Canada) in respect of the sale and the transfer of the Purchased Assets or because of the failure by the Purchaser to file the election as required by this Section 5.09(b).\n\n(c) Social Services Tax. At the Closing, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller, and the Seller shall collect from the Purchaser, the amount of the PST imposed on the Purchaser with respect to the sale and purchase of the Purchased Assets under this Agreement, except where the Purchaser is required to pay such PST directly to a Governmental Authority in connection with the registration of the transfer of any of the Purchased Assets. The Seller shall remit the full amount of the PST collected from the Purchaser and file the appropriate return with the applicable Governmental Authorities. The Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller for any Taxes assessed against the Seller under the Social Services Tax Act (British Columbia) due to the failure of the Purchaser to deliver to the Seller any Taxes payable under the Social Services Tax Act (British Columbia) with respect to the sale and purchase of the Purchased Assets under this Agreement.\n\nSECTION 5.10 Proration of Taxes and Certain Charges. (a) Except as provided in this Section 5.10, all real property Taxes, personal property Taxes or similar ad valorem obligations levied with respect to the Purchased Assets for any taxable period that\n\nincludes the day before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date , whether imposed or assessed before or after the Closing Date, shall be prorated between the Seller and the Purchaser as of 12:01 a.m. Vancouver time on the Closing Date. If any Taxes subject to proration are paid by the Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Seller, on the other hand, the proportionate amount of such Taxes paid (or in the event a refund of any portion of such Taxes previously paid is received, such refund) shall be paid promptly by (or to) the other after the payment of such Taxes (or promptly following the receipt of any such refund).\n\n(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all installments of special assessments or other charges on or with respect to the Purchased Assets payable by the Seller for any period in which the Closing Date shall occur, including base rent, common area maintenance, royalties, all municipal, utility or authority charges for water, sewer, electric or gas charges, garbage or waste removal, and cost of fuel, shall be apportioned as of the Closing, and each party shall pay its proportionate share promptly upon the receipt of any xxxx, statement or other charge with respect thereto. If such charges or rates are assessed either based upon time or for a specified period, such charges or rates shall be prorated as of 12:01 a.m. Vancouver time on the Closing Date. If such charges or rates are assessed based upon usage of utility or similar services, such charges shall be prorated based upon meter readings taken on the Closing Date.\n\n(c) All refunds, reimbursements, installments of base rent, additional rent, license fees or other use related revenue receivable by any party to the extent attributable to the operation of the Business for any period in which the Closing shall occur shall be prorated so that the Seller shall be entitled to that portion of any such installment applicable to the period up to but not including the Closing Date and the Purchaser shall be entitled to that portion of any such installment applicable to any period from and after the Closing Date, and if the Purchaser or the Seller, as the case may be, shall receive any such payments after the Closing Date, they shall promptly remit to such other parties their share of such payments.\n\n(d) The prorations pursuant to this Section 5.10 may be calculated after the Closing Date, as each item to be prorated (including any such Tax, obligation, assessment, charge, refund, reimbursement, rent installment, fee or revenue) accrues or comes due, provided that, in any event, any such proration shall be calculated not later than 30 days after the party requesting proration of any item obtains the information required to calculate such proration of such item.\n\nSECTION 5.11 Personal Information. In respect of any Personal Information contained in the books and records of the Seller that the Purchaser has had access to or acquires at Closing, the Purchaser will: (a) before the Closing, use the Personal Information solely for purposes relating to the Transactions and, if the Closing does not occur, return the Personal Information to the Seller; and (b) if the Closing does occur, then after the Closing: (i) use and disclose any such Personal Information only for necessary employment purposes in compliance with all applicable Laws; and (ii) to the extent required by applicable Laws, notify any Person whose Personal Information has been disclosed to the Purchaser through the books and records that the Transactions have taken place and that the Personal Information was disclosed to the Purchaser as a consequence of such Transactions.\n\nSECTION 5.12 Waiver of Site Profile.
