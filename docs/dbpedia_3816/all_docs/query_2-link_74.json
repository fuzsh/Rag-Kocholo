        "text": "the39steps@worldnet.att.net\n\nKurt ,\n\nThe \"Unpleasantness\" with the Germans Jeff and I were\n\nreferring to was a series of events that almost caused a\n\nwar between the U.S. and Germany in March of 1889 over\n\nSamoa and who would administer it . Seems that the\n\nGermans picked a fellow called Tamasese to be the King\n\nof Samoa and forced the rightful ruler Laupepa into\n\nexile in late 1887 , but before Laupepa went into exile\n\nhe turned over the allegence of his followers to the\n\nMata'afa (a high cheif ). Well the Germans set Tamasese\n\nup as their puppet and started doing pretty much as they\n\npleased despite strong protests from the U.S. and\n\nBritain . The Mata'afa got sick of the situation and\n\nfinally assembled his forces in August of 1888 . The\n\nGermans responded on September 5th by bombarding a\n\nvillage on Manono island with the gunboat SMS Adler. The\n\nMata'afa asked the Americans & British to set up a\n\nneutral area around Apia for foreigners and then\n\nattacked Tamasese . The battle was noted for its low\n\ncasualties and large expenditure of ammo . Both sides\n\ngoing into Apia during the evening to buy more ammo from\n\nthe trading posts there . Tamaese knew he was in trouble\n\nand pulled out . He set up his new camp on the Mulinu'u\n\nPeninsula where he was promptly besieged . At some point\n\na few days later some of Tamasese's men crossed into the\n\nneutral area and threatend to kill an American named\n\nScanlon and shoot his pigs to boot . Well Scanlon\n\ncomplained to Commander Leary USN of the gunboat USS\n\nAdams who stated he would shell Tamasese's positions the\n\nnext day . Tamasese again pulled out that night and\n\nmoved to an area 5 miles away where he was promptly\n\nbesieged again. At this point the American and British\n\npartisanship came out in the open . They started to\n\nsupply Mata'afa with a \"huge\" amount of arms and\n\nequipment brought in on a British ship . The Germans\n\nthen gave their boy a large cargo of arms and ammo\n\nconfiscated from Marshall Islanders (who felt that they\n\ntoo could do without the Germans) . The German\n\nAmbassador then decided that it would be a good idea to\n\nbombard Mata'afa's HQ and took off in the SMS Adler to\n\ndo so\n\n.\n\nAs the Adler slipped out to sea it was intercepted\n\nby HMS Lizard and the USS Adams both with their\n\nrespective Ambassadors on board . The Germans were told\n\nthat the U.S. and Britain didn't like the idea of the\n\nbombardment as it might start an international problem\n\nand since Tamasese was beaten maybe this mess could be\n\nresolved by negotiation . The Germans saw wisdom in this\n\nadvice and decided the Samoans needed to be disarmed and\n\nthat victorious Mata'afa's side should be disarmed\n\nfirst.\n\nThe Germans then sent out 140 sailors to do the job\n\nbut Mata'afa's men ambushed them kiling around twenty\n\nand wounding about 30 . The highly upset Germans now\n\nsworn to vengeance started shelling and burning villages\n\na bit indiscriminately , they also seized an American\n\nboat in Apia harbor . At this point on Jauary 5, 1889\n\nthe American Ambassador requests a squadron of warships\n\nbe sent . Three U.S. ships are sent to Apia .\n\nWell this is what happens next .... by March 15 ,1889\n\none British and three American ships are in Apia harbor\n\nfacing three German ships with tensions running high .\n\nAt 3pm a typhoon sweeps in . Twenty nine hours later the\n\n3 U.S. ships are sunk or aground and so are the 3 German\n\nships.Only HMS Calliope is still afloat but she is badly\n\ndamaged . In the aftermath of the storm everybody\n\npitches in to help the survivers and a peace conference\n\nis held in Berlin at the end of April and so ended\n\nanother international crisis . The End :)\n\nBest Regards ,\n\nShane\n\nMitch and Rob <dragoon@xxxxxxx.xx.xxx\n\nNo apologies necessary Shane, that was interesting.\n\nNow every one of us is thinking, \"but what if the Typhoon hadn't come\n\nalong...\" gears are turning, uniform books are opening, wallets are\n\nspontaniously leaping from pockets.....a new period!......look what you've\n\nstarted Shane!
