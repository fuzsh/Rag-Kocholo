        "text": "Pursuit of foreign policy objectives with the aid of conspicuous displays of naval power\n\nGunboat diplomacy is the pursuit of foreign policy objectives with the aid of conspicuous displays of naval power, implying or constituting a direct threat of warfare should terms not be agreeable to the superior force.[1]\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nThe term \"gunboat diplomacy\" comes from the nineteenth-century period of imperialism,[2] when Western powers – from Europe and the United States – would intimidate other, less powerful entities into granting concessions through a demonstration of Western superior military capabilities, usually represented by their naval assets. A coastal country negotiating with a Western power would notice that a warship or fleet of ships had appeared off its coast. The mere sight of such power almost always had a considerable effect, and it was rarely necessary for such boats to use other measures, such as demonstrations of firepower.[citation needed]\n\nA notable example of gunboat diplomacy, the Don Pacifico affair in 1850, saw the British Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston dispatch a squadron of the Royal Navy to blockade the Greek port of Piraeus in retaliation for the assault of a British subject, David Pacifico, in Athens, and the subsequent failure of the government of King Otto to compensate the Gibraltar-born (and therefore British) Pacifico.[citation needed]\n\nThe effectiveness of such simple demonstrations of a nation's projection of force capabilities meant that nations with naval power and command of the sea could establish military bases (for example, Diego Garcia, 1940s onwards[3]) and arrange economically advantageous relationships around the world. Aside from military conquest, gunboat diplomacy was the dominant way to establish new trade relationships, colonial outposts, and expansion of empire.[citation needed]\n\nPeoples lacking the resources or technological innovations available to Western empires found that their own peaceable relationships were readily dismantled in the face of such pressures, and some therefore came to depend on the imperialist nations for access to raw materials or overseas markets.\n\nTheory\n\n[edit]\n\nDiplomat and naval thinker James Cable spelled out the nature of gunboat diplomacy in a series of works published between 1971 and 1993. In these, he defined the phenomenon as \"the use or threat of limited naval force, otherwise than as an act of war, in order to secure advantage or to avert loss, either in the furtherance of an international dispute or else against foreign nationals within the territory or the jurisdiction of their own state.\"[4] He further broke down the concept into four key areas:\n\nDefinitive Force: the use of gunboat diplomacy to create or remove a fait accompli.\n\nPurposeful Force: application of naval force to change the policy or character of the target government or group.\n\nCatalytic Force: a mechanism designed to buy a breathing space or present policy makers with an increased range of options.\n\nExpressive Force: use of navies to send a political message. This aspect of gunboat diplomacy is undervalued and almost dismissed by Cable.\n\nThe term \"gunboat\" may imply naval power-projection - land-based equivalents may include military mobilisation (as in Europe in the northern-hemisphere summer of 1914), the massing of threatening bodies of troops near international borders (as practised by the German Reich in central Europe in the 1940s), or appropriately timed and situated military manoeuvres (\"exercises\").\n\nDistinctions\n\n[edit]\n\nGunboat diplomacy contrasts with views held prior to the 18th century and influenced by Hugo Grotius, who in De jure belli ac pacis (1625) circumscribed the right to resort to force with what he described as \"temperamenta\".[5]\n\nGunboat diplomacy is distinct from \"defence diplomacy\", which is understood to be the peaceful application of resources from across the spectrum of defence to achieve positive outcomes in the development of bilateral and multilateral relationships.[citation needed] \"Military diplomacy\" is a sub-set of this, tending to refer only to the role of military attachés and their associated activity.[citation needed] Defence diplomacy does not include military operations, but subsumes such other defence activity as international personnel exchanges, ship and aircraft visits, high-level engagement (e.g., ministers and senior defence personnel), training and exercises, security-sector reform,[6] and bilateral military talks.[7]\n\nModern contexts\n\n[edit]\n\nGunboat diplomacy is considered a form of hegemony.[8] As the United States became a military power in the first decade of the 20th century, the Rooseveltian version of gunboat diplomacy, Big Stick Diplomacy, was partially superseded by dollar diplomacy: replacing the big stick with the \"juicy carrot\" of American private investment. However, during Woodrow Wilson's presidency, conventional gunboat diplomacy did occur, most notably in the case of the U.S. Army's occupation of Veracruz in 1914, during the Mexican Revolution.[9]\n\nGunboat diplomacy in the post-Cold War world is still largely based on naval forces, owing to the U.S. Navy's overwhelming sea power. U.S. administrations have frequently changed the disposition of their major naval fleets to influence opinion in foreign capitals.[citation needed] More urgent diplomatic points were made by the Clinton administration in the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s (in alliance with the Blair administration) and elsewhere, using sea-launched Tomahawk missiles,[10] and E-3 AWACS airborne surveillance aircraft in a more passive display of military presence.[11][12][13] Henry Kissinger, during his tenure as United States Secretary of State, summed up the concept as thus: \"An aircraft carrier is 100,000 tons of diplomacy.\"[14]\n\nNotable examples\n\n[edit]\n\n18th century\n\n[edit]\n\nAnson's visit to Canton in 1741[15]\n\n19th century\n\n[edit]\n\nSecond Barbary War (1815)\n\nHaiti indemnity controversy (1825)\n\nPastry War (1838–39)\n\nOpium Wars (1840, 1856)\n\nPaulet Affair (1843)\n\nDon Pacifico Incident (1850)\n\nSecond Anglo-Burmese War (1852)\n\nOpening of Japan by United States Navy Commodore Matthew C.
