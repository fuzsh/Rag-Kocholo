Because of the tsunami’s potentially severe impact on tourism, real GDP is likely to contract this financial year.

Prudent management of monetary policy and the basket peg will be critical. The Samoan economy will have to rely on the private sector for growth.

        "text": "A. Fiscal Management: From Rebuilding to Maintaining Sustainability\n\n11. The fiscal challenges from emergency relief and rehabilitation are daunting. The government has adopted an economic recovery framework for four years through 2012/13 with a fiscal cost of about US$100 million (18 percent of GDP). This not only includes resettlement to safer areas and repair of infrastructure to allow access to basic social services, but also provides for social safety nets, and investments in disaster risk reduction.\n\n12. The government is committed to minimize the fiscal burden and capacity risks arising from rehabilitation and maintain fiscal sustainability. Samoa has a good track record in prudently managing public debt, almost all of which is external. The team and the authorities agreed that the government’s fiscal strategy as laid out in its letter of intent supporting the November 2009 request for emergency financial assistance from the IMF continues to be appropriate (IMF Country Report No. 10/46). The key policies in the face of the current challenges include:\n\nSecuring concessional donor support and prioritizing spending plans. The government has already identified 60 percent of the funding needs for the four-year recovery framework in new grants and concessional financing. It has adopted a supplementary budget for FY 2009/10, which covers a quarter of the recovery framework, is fully funded by grants and concessional loans, and focuses on infrastructure that is key to resuscitate growth, such as utilities and tourism, as well as basic social needs.\n\nReturning to the public deficit target. A widening of the fiscal deficit to 10 percent of GDP in FY 2009/10 and an average of 7 percent of GDP the following 3 years of reconstruction is unavoidable (Table 4). However, in line with their debt strategy, the authorities intend to reduce the fiscal deficit to less than 3 percent of GDP once tsunami-related reconstruction is completed in 2013. This would stabilize the net present value of public debt at about 40 percent of GDP—a comfortable level, providing room to absorb future shocks (Supplement 1: Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 2010).\n\nTable 4.\n\nSamoa: Financial Operations of the Central Government, 2005/06–2010/11\n\nSources: Data provided by the Samoan authorities and Fund staff estimates.\n\n1/Based on the government’s recovery framework with a fiscal cost of US$100 million.\n\nTable 4.\n\nSamoa: Financial Operations of the Central Government, 2005/06–2010/11\n\nStaff Projections 2005/06 2006/07 2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 2009/10 2010/11 Budget Prel.

Despite indications of a favorable budget outturn, fiscal risks remain that will require strong efforts to underpin the government’s commitment.\n\nA better than initially budgeted outturn for the first half of FY 2009/10 will likely curtail tsunami-related fiscal pressures in the near-term. Revenue performance has been on target as tsunami-related import-duty exemptions were kept at a minimum and car imports boomed after the road switch (from right to left in 2009). Development spending under the initial budget has been delayed, reflecting capacity constraints and a reprioritization of spending execution towards reconstruction under the supplementary budget.\n\nHowever, the remaining tsunami-related fiscal financing gap is substantial, about 7 percent of GDP, and will need to be filled from the 2010/11 budget onwards. The team and the authorities agreed that every effort should be made to secure more grants and concessional loans in filling this gap. If the gap were to be filled on non-concessional terms, the net present value of Samoa’s public debt could increase by 5 percent of GDP over the current baseline. This would reduce Samoa’s ability to absorb future shocks without risking an unsustainable debt burden.\n\nSamoa: Fiscal cost of tsunami and financing\n\n(In percent of GDP)\n\nSource: Samoan authorities; Fund staff estimates.\n\n1/After carry over from 2009/10\n\nSamoa: Fiscal cost of tsunami and financing\n\n(In percent of GDP)\n\n2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 Cost of recovery plan 5.2 4.7 3.8 3.9 Current aid pledges 6.4 3.1 0.9 0.0 Grants 4.7 0.0 0.0 0.0 Concessional external financing 1.7 3.1 0.9 0.0 Remaining financing need 1/ -1.2 0.4 2.9 3.9 Memorandum item: Overall fiscal deficit (including grants) 9.7 9.5 5.6 5.2\n\nSource: Samoan authorities; Fund staff estimates.\n\n1/After carry over from 2009/10\n\nSamoa: Fiscal cost of tsunami and financing\n\n(In percent of GDP)\n\n2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 Cost of recovery plan 5.2 4.7 3.8 3.9 Current aid pledges 6.4 3.1 0.9 0.0 Grants 4.7 0.0 0.0 0.0 Concessional external financing 1.7 3.1 0.9 0.0 Remaining financing need 1/ -1.2 0.4 2.9 3.9 Memorandum item: Overall fiscal deficit (including grants) 9.7 9.5 5.6 5.2\n\nSource: Samoan authorities; Fund staff estimates.\n\n1/After carry over from 2009/10\n\n14. The authorities concurred with staff advice that existing medium-term development spending plans should also be reviewed. In consultation with key donors, redirecting to the extent possible funds to rehabilitation would not only help close the financing gap in outer years, but also mitigate capacity constraints in government administration. Delays are becoming evident in the slow implementation of projects under the initial 2009/10 budget. The staff emphasized that restraint on recurrent non-priority expenditure and on any general public wage increase is also required.\n\n15. The authorities and staff agreed on the need to implement the government’s public financial management reform plan. The team welcomed the recent improvements in tax administration with revenue collection slightly better than budgeted and called for a quick resolution of remaining income tax arrears. Likewise, timely application of the new procurement guidelines designed with donor technical assistance will allow Samoa to adopt international best practice and reduce the potential for wasteful spending.\n\nC. Structural Reform: Promoting Private-Sector Led Growth\n\n18. Over the past two decades, structural reforms have helped make Samoa a more attractive place to do business. The team welcomed recent reforms to simplify company formation and business registration processes that have lowered the overall cost of starting a new business by three quarters. However, further reforms to foster private-sector led economic growth - a key goal of the Strategy for Development of Samoa - are needed to help ensure sustainable economic growth.\n\n19. The team and the authorities broadly agreed that reforms to facilitate the economic use of customary land and reduce the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the economy would contribute significantly to a more vibrant private sector. However, the authorities cautioned that any reform must be equitable and in keeping with Samoa’s social and traditional values.\n\nUse of customary land. The lack of clear legal title to customary land, which accounts for about 80 percent of all land in Samoa and an inability to transfer ownership inhibit its economic use (Box 2). The government has appropriately focused on reforms to ease land registration. The passage of legislation to allow banks to use capital improvements on leased customary land as collateral is also a step in the right direction to improve investors’ access to credit. Continued community outreach will be necessary to realize the full benefits of these reforms. However, the team noted that legislation to cap the rise in the market value of freehold land, which reflects its scarcity value, should be avoided. The authorities broadly agreed with the need to pursue further land-use reforms, but emphasized that they need to be carefully calibrated with maintaining Samoa’s cultural heritage and social traditions.\n\nSOE reform. SOEs are placing a significant strain on the Samoan economy and the government’s budget (Box 3). The team welcomed the Prime Minister’s effort to reinvigorate the reform agenda. In particular, further efforts need to be made to enforce hard budget constraints and implement existing corporate governance legislation including through more clearly defined community services obligations (CSO) met by SOEs. The mission welcomed progress made in bringing selected SOEs to privatization, including SamoaTel. The authorities agreed that, given that existing public debt is on concessional terms, proceeds from the sale of SOEs should go towards deficit reduction and filling the remaining tsunami-related fiscal financing gap.\n\n20. A vibrant private sector will also require a deeper and sound financial system. As the ratio of nonperforming loans has risen from 6 percent at end-2008 to over 8 percent at end-2009, risk aversion of banks has been amplified by structural weaknesses that have hampered credit intermediation and effective risk management (Table 5). Chief among them are lingering uncertainties in the enforcement of land-related collateral and the lack of a credit bureau. Given the urgency caused by the tsunami in improving access to credit, the team supported the government’s subsidized loan program for small operators in the tourism sector.5 However, the team emphasized and the authorities concurred that such schemes should be strictly limited to avoid undue budgetary risks or distortions that hamper longer-term growth prospects. In addition, there was agreement that as the financial system evolves, it will be important to further strengthen financial system supervision and regulation to better gauge vulnerabilities of banks and nonbank financial institutions.\n\nTable 5.\n\nSamoa: Financial Soundness Indicators, 2004–09 1/\n\nSource: Central Bank of Samoa.\n\n1/For commercial banks.\n\nTable 5.\n\nSamoa: Financial Soundness Indicators, 2004–09 1/\n\n2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 (in percent) Loans to deposit ratio 84.1 93.8 107.4 104.8 104.5 96.4 Capital to risk-weighted asset ratio 24.5 24.1 24.4 28.0 28.0 30.2 Return on assets 3.3 4.0 4.6 3.7 4.1 3.2 Non-performing loans ratio 5.3 5.4 4.0 7.1 6.0 8.1 Net interest margins 9.0 8.7 8.3 7.0 7.5 7.2 Liquid assets to short-term liabilities 16.4 12.9 5.7 12.5 19.0 26.4 Bank provisions to non-performing loans 77.6 74.4 73.2 47.6 70.0 64.0\n\nSource: Central Bank of Samoa.\n\n1/For commercial banks.\n\nTable 5.\n\nSamoa: Financial Soundness Indicators, 2004–09 1/\n\n2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 (in percent) Loans to deposit ratio 84.1 93.8 107.4 104.8 104.5 96.4 Capital to risk-weighted asset ratio 24.5 24.1 24.4 28.0 28.0 30.2 Return on assets 3.3 4.0 4.6 3.7 4.1 3.2 Non-performing loans ratio 5.3 5.4 4.0 7.1 6.0 8.1 Net interest margins 9.0 8.7 8.3 7.0 7.5 7.2 Liquid assets to short-term liabilities 16.4 12.9 5.7 12.5 19.0 26.4 Bank provisions to non-performing loans 77.6 74.4 73.2 47.6 70.0 64.0\n\nSource: Central Bank of Samoa.\n\n1/For commercial banks.\n\n21. Building on improvements in compilation and dissemination of key economic statistics will serve to enhance policy credibility and reduce uncertainty for the private sector. Samoa is the only Pacific island that disseminates monthly and quarterly economic statistics through government websites. Yet data are subject to frequent revisions, owing to weaknesses in compilation and coverage, complicating economic analysis. The team welcomed the government’s use of technical assistance, including through PFTAC, and noted that improvements to national accounts and the coverage of BOP data are priorities.\n\nBox 1.\n\nSamoa: Exchange Rate Assessment\n\nExcluding the impact of the tsunami, the current account deficit appears to be in line with Samoa’s structural savings-investment norm. Once the tsunami-related recovery is completed, Samoa’s current account deficit is projected to decline to about 9 percent of GDP in 2013/14. While sensitive to assumptions on key variables, such as population growth, staff estimates based on a sample of 55 low-income countries suggest a savings-investment norm of about 6–10 percent of GDP for Samoa.\n\nOther indicators of a deviation of the exchange rate from medium-term fundamentals do not point to a misalignment:\n\nForeign reserves rose steadily in recent years and are now about double their level just four years ago. Staff project reserves to remain around 3½–4 months of imports of goods and services at the end of this fiscal year.\n\nTourism receipts have risen at double-digit rates over the last several years in part due to the introduction of new airline flights. They have become Samoa’s most important commercial foreign exchange earner (equivalent to about 20 percent of GDP). Indeed, Samoa has gained market share in the main tourist markets from 2004–2008 vis-à-vis other Pacific island countries and its real per-capita income growth over 1993–2008 has been higher than for other tourism-based economies (3½ percent compared with less than 1 percent for other Pacific islands, and about 2 percent for the Caribbean).\n\nThe decline in fish exports (nearly 20 percent between 2007 and 2009) mainly reflects supply-side factors. Moreover, although fish exports are the second most important commercial activity, they are only equivalent to 4 percent of tourism earnings.\n\nRemittances, which account for about 25 percent of GDP, have performed strongly over the last several years, reaching an all time high in 2007/08. Importantly, remittances have remained stable during the global financial crisis, and increased in the immediate aftermath of the September 2009 tsunami, underscoring the role of remittances as a shock absorber.\n\nBox 2.\n\nSamoa: Tapping the Economic Potential of Customary Land\n\nThe nature of land ownership in Samoa inhibits economic development. Customary land, which is owned by extended families represented by their chiefs, accounts for around 80 percent of Samoan land.1 The chiefs direct the use of the land, giving entitlements to access land, although customary ownership rights flow from a mix of titles and ancestral transfers. The land cannot be transferred outside a village or turned into free hold land. As is the case in other Pacific island countries, establishing clear title to the land is costly and time consuming. Leases are legally possible2, but are time consuming and expensive to arrange.\n\nThe government recognizes that increasing access to customary land for development is important and has undertaken legal and policy reforms to this end.3 In conjunction with a public outreach campaign, recent reforms have focused on facilitating land registration. In addition, legislation passed in the last couple of years allows banks to use leasehold improvements on customary land as collateral; however, no bank has done so, largely because of the uncertainty associated with contract enforcement.\n\nMoreover, a new land registration system was introduced in March 2009, but less than 10 percent of the land has been registered so far. This reflects the difficulty and cost, in terms of time and money, in establishing title to land, which requires land owners to advertise notice of intent to title property for three months and survey the land. Disputes over land titling are handled through the Land and Titles Court and can take years to resolve.\n\nThe pace of reform is likely to remain slow and deliberate. The government’s reform effort is tempered by a desire to foster balanced and equitable growth and a respect for Samoa’s traditional values and culture. In addition, the government’s commitment to address a key impediment - the inalienable nature of customary land - is unclear. Looking ahead, practical and likely politically feasible reforms the government could consider are establishing a “one stop shop” for customary land matters, developing a database of leased and leasable land and continuing its outreach efforts and encouragement of land registration.\n\n1 The government owns 11 percent of the land through the several agencies, including the Samoa Land Corporation, the Samoa Trust Estate Corporation, and the Land Board. The government seeks to increase access to this land through issuing leases. The remaining 9 percent of the land is freehold. 2 Customary land can be leased for a 30 year period with an option to renew for another 30 years for hotel development and a 20 year period with the option to renew for another 20 years for all other purposes. The Ministry of Nature Resources and Environment (MNRE) assists landowners and potential investors in the development of customary land, including the drafting of customary land leases. 3 The Asian Development Bank, through a Japanese trust fund, has recently supported technical assistance in this area.\n\nBox 3.\n\nSamoa: State-Owned Enterprise Reform1\n\nState-owned enterprises (SOEs) account for 10 percent of formal employment, but constitute a drag on economic growth and the government’s budget. For the non-strategic SOEs that are available for privatization, the return on equity was just 3.3 percent for FY2007/08, compared with the government’s own target of 7 percent. In addition to the direct costs to the economy, SOEs divert potential private and public investment away from priority sectors. Ongoing SOE investment and foregone earnings were equivalent to almost 60 percent of health and education expenditure during 2002–06.\n\nDespite previous achievements, Samoa’s SOE reform program has slowed since 2007. Privatization is continuing, albeit slowing with the removal of Agricultural Stores Corporation from the privatization pipeline after it had received initial privatization preparation support and the delays associated with the sale of Samoa Shipping Services. The privatization of SamoaTel is currently targeted to be completed before the end of 2010. The combined book value of companies slated for privatization is about T70 million (FY2007/08) or 4½ percent of GDP.\n\nRegardless of ownership, the key to successful SOE reform in Samoa will be placing SOEs on a fully commercial footing, with independence from political directives, hard budget constraints, exposure to competition, and full accountability. A functioning Community Service Obligation (CSO) framework is vital for the commercialization of SOEs. However, the nature and magnitude of CSOs are not clearly and transparently defined. The Public Bodies (Performance and Accountability) Act enables SOEs to claim reimbursement from the Government for the cost of providing CSOs approved under the provisions of the Act and Regulations. Those provisions, however, are not enforced, resulting in conflicting interpretations of what constitutes a CSO. This contributes to poor CSO management that depresses SOE profitability and reduces their efficiency.
