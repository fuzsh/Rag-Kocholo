        "text": "Travelers must have a valid passport and onward/return ticket to enter Samoa. U.S. citizens do not need a visa for stays of 90 days or less. Non-citizen U.S. nationals will need a visitor permit before travelling to Samoa.\n\nNon-citizen U.S. nationals can apply for a visitor’s permit at the Samoa Consulate General office in Pago Pago, American Samoa:\n\nConsulate General Of Samoa\n\nPO Box 1313\n\nIupeli Siliva Building\n\nFagatogo, Maoputasi\n\nPago Pago, American Samoa 96799\n\nPh: +684 6335919\n\nFax: +684 6335929\n\nVisit the Samoa Immigration website for Samoa’s most current visa information.\n\nYou must pay a departure tax when you leave the country (this tax is normally included in airfares).\n\nYou can find more information about entry requirements and the departure tax from the Samoa Mission to the United Nations at 800-2nd Avenue, Suite 400J, New York, NY 10017, ph: +(212) 599-6196 and fax: +(212) 599-0797, or by email.\n\nSome HIV/AIDS entry restrictions exist for visitors to, and foreign residents of, Samoa. Visitors indicating they have tested HIV positive will be subject to questioning by a health professional upon entry. Verify this information with the Samoan Overseas Mission before you travel\n\nFind information on dual nationality, prevention of international child abduction and customs regulations on our websites.\n\nCrime:\n\nYou should remain aware of your surroundings, lock your doors at night, and do not leave your belongings unattended.\n\nIncidents of petty theft and robberies are common in Samoa. Some incidents have involved residential break-ins.\n\nWhile rare, violent assaults, including sexual assaults, have occurred in Samoa. Particular care should be taken near Apia’s downtown bars and restaurants, where a number of violent incidents involving foreigners and Samoans have occurred. No specific groups have been targeted, and there have been no reported racially motivated or hate crimes against U.S. citizens.\n\nPolice in Apia generally respond quickly to incidents. However, there is a very limited police presence elsewhere in Samoa (where order is maintained primarily by local village authorities), and police response outside of Apia is not as quick or reliable as it is in Apia.\n\nInternational Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information.\n\nVictims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.\n\nReport crimes to the local police at 911 and contact the U.S. Embassy at 21631 Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\n\nSee our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.\n\nWe can:\n\nHelp you find appropriate medical care\n\nAssist you in reporting a crime to the police\n\nContact relatives or friends with your written consent\n\nProvide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion\n\nProvide a list of local attorneys\n\nProvide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the U.S.\n\nProvide information about the Samoa Victims Support Group that helps victims of crime in Samoa with local law enforcement liaison and other related matters. They can be reached by telephone number 085-25392\n\nProvide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution\n\nHelp you find accommodation and arrange flights home\n\nReplace a stolen or lost passport\n\nDomestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.\n\nTourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.\n\nFor further information:\n\nEnroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.\n\nCall us in Washington at 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the United States and Canada or 1-202-501-4444 from other countries from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, Monday through Friday (except U.S. federal holidays).\n\nSee the State Department's travel website for the Worldwide Caution, Travel Advisories, and Alerts.\n\nFollow us on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nSee traveling safely abroad for useful travel tips.\n\nCriminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\n\nPenalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Samoa are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.\n\nIn Samoa, driving under the influence could land you immediately in jail.\n\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.\n\nArrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information.\n\nBehavior modification facilities:\n\nThere is one overseas treatment center or Behavior Modification Facility operating in Samoa.\n\nAlthough this facility may be operated and staffed by U.S. citizens, the Samoan government is solely responsible for its compliance with local safety, health, sanitation, and educational laws and regulations, including all licensing requirements of the staff in country.\n\nThese standards may not be strictly enforced or meet the standards of similar facilities in the United States.\n\nParents should be aware that U.S. citizens and non-citizen nationals 16 years of age and older have a right to apply for a U.S. passport and to request repatriation assistance from the U.S. government, both without parental consent.\n\nAny U.S. citizen or non-citizen U.S. national has the right to contact a representative from the U.S. Embassy. Parents may also contact the U.S. Embassy in Apia or the Office of American Citizens Services, Bureau of Consular Affairs.\n\nStray dogs: In Apia, and in many villages, stray dogs wander the streets.\n\nYou should not approach or feed them; they can become aggressive in the presence of food or if they feel threatened.\n\nThere have been several cases of attacks by multiple dogs.\n\nPlease exercise appropriate caution when you are walking, running, or riding a bike near stray dogs.\n\nFerry service:\n\nAlthough there have been no major accidents involving the ferry service linking Upolu and Savaii, vessels are sometimes overloaded.\n\nOne of the ferries, a multi-deck, automobile ferry, sometimes transports passengers on its automobile deck.\n\nTo avoid injury from shifting vehicles, you should ride only in the passenger compartment, not on the automobile deck during the crossing.\n\nBlowholes: Samoa has numerous “blowholes” (lava tubes open to the sea where wave action produces often spectacular geysers). These blowholes are popular tourist attractions. The footing around the mouths of most blowholes is very slippery. To avoid being swept in, you should not approach too closely and should never stand between the opening of the blowhole and the sea.\n\nFinancial transactions: Some businesses in Apia, especially those frequented by tourists, do accept credit cards, but many do not, including gas stations. Major hotels and some restaurants and stores accept major credit cards (Visa, Master Card, and American Express). You can get Samoan currency from ATMs, which are located in Faleolo Airport, Salelologa, and many locations in Apia. For more information on ATM locations and banking services, visit the ANZ Bank website or the BSP website.\n\nDisaster preparedness:\n\nSamoa is located in an area of high seismic activity called the “Ring of Fire” and is subject to earthquakes which can trigger a tsunami.\n\nThe rainy (or monsoon) season in the South Pacific is from November to April, when strong winds, heavy rains, landslides, and disruptions to services could occur.\n\nFor information about tropical cyclone preparedness, visit our Crisis and Disaster Preparedness webpages, and NOAA's Hurricane Preparedness Guide.\n\nFor information about all types of natural disasters, visit the CDC webpages.\n\nCustoms:\n\nSamoan customs authorities may enforce strict regulations about importing or exporting items such as firearms, fruits, pets and other animals, and drugs.\n\nYou should contact the Samoan Mission to the United Nations at 800 2nd Avenue, Suite 400J, New York, NY 10017, telephone: (212) 599-6196 for specific information regarding customs requirements.\n\nYou can also consult the Samoa Ministry of Revenue website.\n\nFaith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details:\n\nFaith-Based Travel Information\n\nInternational Religious Freedom Report – see country reports\n\nHuman Rights Report – see country reports\n\nHajj Fact Sheet for Travelers\n\nBest Practices for Volunteering Abroad\n\nLGBTI Travelers: Same-sex acts are a crime in Samoa, with prison terms of up to seven years. The Crimes Ordinance 1961 and the more recent Crimes Act 2013, which came into effect in May 2013, criminalize same-sex acts.\n\nThere is no recognition of same-sex relationships, marriage or adoption by same-sex couples in Samoa.\n\nThere are also no anti-discrimination laws in place.\n\nSee our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details.\n\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance. While in Samoa, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from in the United States.\n\nThere is no law pertaining specifically to the status of disabled persons.\n\nMost major hotels, restaurants, and cafes are actively restructuring their facilities to accommodate persons with disabilities. However, disabled travelers should clarify with the hotel what accommodations are available before they book.\n\nPersons with disabilities have easy access to medical facilities.\n\nSome family-based beach accommodations in the outer villages are also working to provide accessibility for disabled persons.\n\nMany of the new multi-story buildings provide ramps and elevators, but older public buildings do not.\n\nThe blind and persons in wheelchairs or on crutches will have difficulty navigating in and around Apia because of a limited number of stoplights and sidewalks.\n\nTraffic is particularly hazardous for the disabled in rural areas that have no footpaths and sidewalks.\n\nMost buses and taxis do not have ramps to accommodate wheelchairs.\n\nStudents: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips.\n\nWomen Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers.\n\nFor emergency services in Samoa, dial 911.\n\nAmbulance services are 911.\n\nInjured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.\n\nWe do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\n\nMedical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance overseas. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\n\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\n\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Samoa Ministry of Customs and Revenue to ensure the medication is legal in Samoa.\n\nVaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn late 2019, Samoa suffered a measles epidemic. Travelers are advised to review their immunity status prior to arrival.\n\nFurther health information:\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\nAir Quality: Visit AirNow Department of State for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\n\nHealth facilities in general\n\nAdequate health facilities are available in Apia but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards.\n\nPublic medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies.\n\nMost hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment.\n\nHospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient.\n\nU.S. citizens have lodged a large number of complaints about unethical business practices.\n\nGenerally, hospital staffing is minimal overnight. Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child.\n\nPatients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.\n\nPsychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions\n\nMedical Tourism and Elective Surgery\n\nMedical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information on and the risks of Medical Tourism.\n\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.\n\nYour legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Samoa.\n\nPharmaceuticals\n\nExercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information.\n\nWater Quality\n\nIn many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.\n\nAdventure Travel\n\nVisit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Adventure Travel.\n\nGeneral Health Language\n\nThe following diseases are prevalent:\n\nDengue\n\nChikungunya\n\nZika\n\nUse the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended mosquito repellents and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers even for short stays.\n\nHIV/AIDS: Only minimal treatment is available in Samoa.\n\nVisit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Resources for Travelers regarding specific issues in Samoa."
