        "text": "Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have shaped the history of the United States and have had their lives dramatically influenced by moments in its history. Every May the Defense Department joins the rest of the nation in celebrating Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month.\n\nNavy Petty Officer 2nd Class Fa'atuatua Pinkston was born in San Jose, California, and grew up in St. Louis. Her mother was born in Apia, American Samoa.\n\nPinkston said she's doubly proud of her heritage: Pacific Islander, from her mother's side, and African American from her father's side.\n\n\"To be an American in the armed forces and being able to express my heritage and culture is very honorable for me,\" she said. \"It is very hard to find others of Samoan heritage but when we do find them, the pride is strong!\"\n\nPinkston said she studied the island culture, which included tribal tattoos and native dances, with special historical meaning associated with those rituals. \"A lot of people are excited to hear our interesting stories about those things.\"\n\nPinkston said she joined the Navy because she loves the ocean and was fascinated with the structure of the naval vessels. \"Something about warships really pulled my interest.\"\n\nAs an information systems technician, she said she manages everything from communications systems to computer networks.\n\nAfter boot camp in Naval Station Great Lakes, Illinois, she served aboard the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier from 2016 to 2019, homeported in San Diego.\n\nShe's already been on two deployments in the Pacific and participated in the allied, fleet-wide Rim of the Pacific, or RIMPAC, Exercise.\n\nRIMPAC, is the world's largest international maritime warfare exercise. It's held biennially during June and July of even-numbered years in Honolulu. The only exception was 2020 when it was held in August.\n\nAfter her time aboard the carrier, Pinkston was stationed at the Defense Intelligence Agency in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. A few weeks ago, she detached from that command and soon will be assigned to the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Group in Virginia Beach, Virginia.\n\nPinkston is also a gifted rugby player, on the Navy Women's Rugby team.\n\nGrowing up, Pinkston said she always knew that rugby was her sport of passion but there were no nearby teams in her St. Louis neighborhood.\n\nIt wasn't until she was stationed in San Diego that she was able to start playing rugby after learning the basics.\n\n\"Rugby has definitely made me a better sailor and person overall,\" she said.\n\nRugby is a physical as well as a mental sport. It helps build teamwork and leadership, both important traits to have in the Navy, she said.\n\n\"Rugby made me realize my true physical strength, power and potential. I am a beast! I am unstoppable! I am what I envisioned myself to be and rugby helped bring it out. It also helped me dig deeper into my roots as I can compete against women bigger than me and still hold my ground or push further! It has made me powerful and unlocked that skill! Rugby has made [me] confident in every obstacle I take on! If I can take on rugby, I can take on anything!\" she said."
