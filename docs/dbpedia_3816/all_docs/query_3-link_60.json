        "text": "Enormous attention has been focused in recent years on the lack of complete and accurate official statistics reporting fatal law enforcement encounters. Barely noted in the uproar has been the role played by serious mental illness, a medical condition that, when treated, demonstrably reduces the likelihood of interacting with police or being arrested, much less dying in the process. Despite the dearth of official data, there is abundant evidence individuals with mental illness make up a disproportionate number of those killed at the very first step of the criminal justice process: while being approached or stopped by a law enforcement officer in the community.\n\nOverlooked in the Undercounted: The Role of Mental Illness in Fatal Law Enforcement Encounters surveys the status of law enforcement homicide reporting, examines the demonstrable role of mental illness in the use of deadly force by law enforcement and recommends practical approaches to reducing fatal police shootings and the many social costs associated with them.\n\nTop Takeaway\n\nBecause of the disproportionate volume of contact between individuals with serious mental illness and law enforcement, reducing the\n\nlikelihood of police interaction with individuals in psychiatric crisis may represent the single most immediate, practical strategy for reducing fatal police encounters in the United States.\n\nFast Facts\n\nThe risk of being killed while being approached or stopped by law enforcement in the community is 16 times higher for individuals with untreated serious mental illness than for other civilians.\n\nBy the most conservative estimates, at least 1 in 4 fatal law enforcement encounters involves an individual with serious mental\n\nillness. When data have been rigorously collected and analyzed, findings indicate as many as half of all law enforcement homicides ends the life of an individual with severe psychiatric disease.\n\nThe arrest-related death program operated by the Bureau of Justice Statistics within the US Department of Justice is the only federal database that attempts to systematically collect and publish mental health information about law enforcement homicides. The program was suspended in 2015 because the data available to the agency was not credible enough to report.\n\nRecommendations to Policymakers\n\nRestore the mental illness treatment system sufficiently that individuals with serious mental illness are not left untreated to the\n\npoint that their behavior results in law enforcement action\n\nAccurately count and report the number of fatal police encounters in a reliable federal database\n\nAccurately count and report all incidents involving use of all deadly force by law enforcement, not only those incidents that result in death\n\nSystematically identify the role of mental illness in fatal law enforcement encounters"
