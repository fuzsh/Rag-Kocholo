S. S. Asheville to Admiral Williams, commander in chief of the U. S. Asiatic Fleet.) 44 Jan. 11 (9) To the Minister in China (tel.)\n\nRequest for opinion whether the U. S. Government should urge its nationals to withdraw to places of safety, and for information as to protective measures to be taken at Shanghai by other powers. Inquiry whether Minister continues to recommend the landing of all forces necessary and cooperation with other powers to protect Settlement, and whether Americans in the interior would be unfavorably affected by such cooperation. 45 Jan. 13 (26) From the Minister in China (tel.)\n\nFrom Shanghai, January 11: Opinion that naval forces should not be landed unless disorder or violence is unquestionably imminent; request for authorization to advise Americans to proceed to treaty ports from which they may be evacuated if necessary; intention to communicate this information to commander in chief.\n\nTo Shanghai, January 13: Concurrence in views concerning landing of naval forces; authorization for warning to Americans if trouble becomes imminent, and information that other American consuls have been advised likewise; instructions to communicate this information to commander in chief. 45 Jan. 15 (32) From the Minister in China (tel.)\n\nOpinion that trouble at Shanghai can best be avoided by obvious preparation of the powers to cooperate in defending Settlement; probability that immediate situation of Americans in interior would be unfavorably affected by such cooperation but that in the long run their situation would be improved; information that British have advised their nationals in the interior to concentrate at ports where protection can be given, and that American Minister is considering a similar warning; advice that the powers have not definitely decided on protective measures for Shanghai; recommendation that Department secure assurances concerning attitude of British and Japanese. 47 [Page X] Jan. 16 (35) From the Minister in China (tel.)\n\nFrom Shanghai, January 15: Decision by foreign consuls that patrol or cordon around Settlement will be unnecessary until Sun Ch’uan-fang suffers a defeat in Chekiang, that available naval forces could put down any local disorders prior to such defeat, that landing of additional forces is not required at present, and that the adequacy of the planned patrol or cordon system depends on result of Hankow affair. 49 Jan. 16 (36) From the Minister in China (tel.)\n\nConfidential portion of the telegram quoted in telegram No. 35 of January 16: Advice from commander in chief that if Chiang Kai-shek appears before Shanghai with intention of taking possession of Settlement, the naval landing forces would be inadequate, and that 20,000 troops would be required to ensure inviolability of the Settlement. 50 Jan. 18 (50) From the Minister in China (tel.)\n\nSuggestion that consideration should be given to the advisability of augmenting American naval forces in Chinese waters because of serious rioting at Foochow and looting of American premises there by Nationalist soldiers. 51 Jan. 20 Memorandum by the Chief of the Division of Far Eastern Affairs\n\nConversation between the Secretary of State and the Chinese Minister concerning the purpose of American naval forces in China, the Foochow incident, and the possibility of trouble at Shanghai. 51 Jan. 24 Memorandum by the Chief of the Division of Far Eastern Affairs\n\nConversation in which Chinese Minister informed Secretary of State of Chinese Government’s concern over press reports of dispatch of additional American and British forces to China and presented appeal for U.

Instructions to advise when action has been taken. 59 Jan. 28 (32) To the Minister in China (tel.)\n\nNavy message to commander in chief at Shanghai (text printed), giving reasons why it would be unwise to send a large force of the Regular Army to Shanghai, and advising that efforts are being made to communicate with the military leaders through the American Minister at Peking concerning an arrangement to guarantee neutrality of the Settlement. 61 Jan. 28 (61) From the British Ambassador\n\nBelief of Chinese Minister that military leaders will give guarantees of security if the dispatch of troops be abandoned, troops at Shanghai withdrawn, and promises given by the powers to agree to abolition of special rights and treaties within the concession; British Ambassador’s request to his Government for opinion on American plan to communicate with factional leaders. 62 Jan. 29 Memorandum by the Secretary of State\n\nConversation with the British Ambassador, in which the Secretary stated that Chinese Minister had not told him that abolition of special rights and treaties within the concession would be made a condition for neutrality of the Settlement;

opinion that an offer to consider changes in status of the Settlement without previous consultation with the other powers would be an act of bad faith and would also incite Cantonese faction to force the issue; recommendation that no further action be taken on the proposed message. 64 Jan. 31 (35) To the Minister in China (tel.)\n\nConsiderations which Department feels warrant the sending of the proposed message; approval of British and Japanese Ambassadors; amendments to meet Minister’s objections; instructions to telegraph any further comments. 65 [Page XII] Jan. 31 Memorandum by the Secretary of State\n\nConversation in which the Secretary informed the British Ambassador of naval forces available for use at Shanghai;
