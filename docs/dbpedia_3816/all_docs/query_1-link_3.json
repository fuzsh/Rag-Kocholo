During fiscal years 2020-2022, real GDP endured a cumulative 15 percent decline, leaving standards of living over 20 percent behind pre-pandemic projections.1 This was triggered by the border closure and loss of tourism receipts (which accounted for over 20 percent of GDP pre-pandemic), which spilled over to other sectors of the economy. In 2022, a domestic COVID-19 outbreak and associated lockdowns prompted another decline in activity. With the outbreak abating and the border reopened to travelers, a recovery is underway.",

        "text": "Annex II. Revenue Mobilization Performance and Options1\n\n1. Samoa has made significant strides in domestic revenue mobilization over the last decade. Tax revenue has increased from 20 percent of GDP in 2010 to over 25 percent of GDP in 2022. Tax policy changes to increase revenue have included an increase in the VAGST (Value Added on Goods and Services Tax) rate in 2011 to 15 percent (from the previous 10 percent), increases in various excise taxes beginning in 2017, reduction in personal income tax (PIT) exemptions, and winding down of a tax credit for investment in hotels since 2018. Samoa has also made revenue administration improvements, strengthening core tax administration functions such as filing and payments, and building risk-based compliance capability— with substantial technical assistance (TA) from the IMF and other development partners.\n\n2. There has been little discernible impact of the pandemic on the revenue-GDP ratio. Factors underlying the buoyant revenue performance include that Samoa refrained from widespread discretionary tax cuts in response to the pandemic, taking only small, targeted, temporary measures; the rollout of electronic fiscal devices under the TIMS (Tax Invoicing and Monitoring System) starting in 2020, which boosted both VAGST and corporate income tax revenue; and buoyant remittances that supported revenue from taxes based on consumption and imports.\n\nTax Revenue: Samoa and Other Pacific Islands\n\n(In percent of GDP, 2021)\n\nSources: National authorities; and Sy and others (2022).\n\nTax Revenue: Samoa and Other Pacific Islands\n\n(In percent of GDP, 2021)\n\nSamoa Other PICs Total tax revenue 25.0 19.3 Taxes on income 5.9 6.6 Taxes on goods and services 16.3 8.3 Taxes on international trade 2.8 3.5 Other 0.0 1.0\n\nSources: National authorities; and Sy and others (2022).\n\nTax Revenue: Samoa and Other Pacific Islands\n\n(In percent of GDP, 2021)\n\nSamoa Other PICs Total tax revenue 25.0 19.3 Taxes on income 5.9 6.6 Taxes on goods and services 16.3 8.3 Taxes on international trade 2.8 3.5 Other 0.0 1.0\n\nSources: National authorities; and Sy and others (2022).\n\n3. Samoa has high tax revenue compared to other Pacific Island economies and a relatively high VAGST rate. The tax revenue-GDP ratio is well above the simple average of 19.3 percent among other PICs. The main differences are substantially higher collection of taxes on goods and services—the VAGST and excise taxes—both of which are the highest in the region. The VAGST rate is tied for the highest in the region, and relatively high for a country of Samoa’s per capita income. VAGST revenue-GDP is also the highest in the region, as Samoa scores well on measures of C-efficiency. This suggests a low scope for additional gains to the VAGST by broadening the base and is consistent with the findings of Sy and others (2022), who find that Samoa’s revenue collection is already near its tax potential given the fundamental features of its economy.\n\nVAT Rates\n\nSource: Sy and others (2022).\n\nVAT Rates\n\nPercent Samoa 15 Other Pacific Islands 12 World 16\n\nSource: Sy and others (2022).\n\nVAT Rates\n\nPercent Samoa 15 Other Pacific Islands 12 World 16\n\nSource: Sy and others (2022).\n\n4. Some tax policy measures noted by previous TA could yield modest revenue gains. A recommended first step in identifying potential revenue gains is to develop a regular tax expenditure statement, which could quantify the potential yield of various measures. Additionally:\n\nThe increase in excise taxes coming into effect in 2023 is in line with previous recommendations. For import duties, exemptions could be reviewed and reduced.\n\nPrevious TA has noted the potentially regressive impact of raising the VAGST rate but has recommended reducing VAGST zero-rating and exemptions, in particular for water and electricity, as well as making some zero-rated items exempt, such as medical and educational supplies.\n\nSimilarly, previous TA saw risks that raising the corporate income tax (CIT) rate could induce income-shifting given the already-high rate and that most major businesses are foreign owned. Alternatively, measures such as limiting the time period on carrying forward tax losses and phasing out CIT holidays have been recommended. Introducing a withholding tax of 10 to 15 percent on dividend payments to non-residents could also ensure a greater contribution of corporate profits to tax revenue.\n\n5. Further strengthening revenue administration would also help bolster revenue. Samoa has opted to raise business license fees instead of implementing a small business tax regime given the administrative challenges of taxing small businesses. Other steps recommended by previous TA include: 1) enforcement of transfer pricing and thin capitalization rules to strengthen compliance among large firms; 2) improving the information technology system to facilitate strengthened compliance management; 3) moving towards a full self-assessment system, which would reduce the resource-intensive physical assessment and checking of returns; and 4) deepening segmentation to better tailor services across different taxpayer types.\n\nAnnex III. Impact of Global Commodity Price Shocks on Samoa’s Inflation1\n\n1. Geographical remoteness, small economic size, and a narrow production base make Samoa heavily reliant on imports, especially for food and oil, which account for 48 percent of overall imports. Likewise, imported items account for 49 percent of the CPI basket. Taken together, the ’food’ and ’transport’ components account for 55 percent of the CPI basket and 72 percent of the CPI import basket, implying a high exposure of domestic inflation to global food and oil prices. Geographical isolation also increases transportation costs. Given that fuel is a large component of shipping costs, global oil price shocks raise the landed cost of products, broadening the impact on inflation.\n\n2. After remaining in negative territory for parts of 2020-21, inflation began to gather pace in the latter half of 2021 due a pickup in global oil and food prices. The spike in global food and oil prices in early 2022 began to impact Samoa’s inflation within a few months, with inflation surging into double-digits by June 2022. Following the sharp rise in import prices, local inflation also gained momentum.\n\n3. Food followed by fuel and transport have been the key drivers of import and local inflation in 2022. Local food inflation accelerated into double-digits, due to weather-related factors. The commodity price shock has also affected prices beyond food and fuel. The prices of imported construction materials and manufactured goods have risen due to higher shipping costs. The surge in food and fuel prices has driven up the prices for airfares and restaurants.\n\n4. Changes in global food prices are reflected in Samoa’s ’CPI import index for food’ component with a few months lag. At the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, the government introduced price controls on the wholesale and retail prices of selected imported food products, which helped contain the increase in imported food prices, though they covered only a small share of the consumption basket. The price ceilings were subsequently revised (in June 2020, December 2020 and December 2021) to partially account for movements in global food prices. The price controls were removed in July 2022, which have led to upward pressure on some imported food products. However, the overall impact on imported food inflation has been mitigated by the stabilization in global food prices in H2 2022.\n\n5. Samoa has full pass-through from global oil prices to domestic fuel prices, with the government policy to adjust domestic prices with a two-month lag. With global oil prices peaking in June 2022, the ’CPI import index for transport’ component and ’CPI import index for kerosene, cooking gas & building materials’ peaked in August 2022. The ’CPI local index for utilities & house rent’ component has also been influenced by changes in global oil prices in the past. In April 2020, utility tariffs were temporarily lowered as part of the pandemic support measures, in line with the decline in oil prices. However, in efforts to continue to support households, the water and electricity tariffs were reduced again in November 2021 and remained unchanged even as global oil prices jumped in 2022. This has led to persistent downward pressure on utility prices and a divergence between tariffs and input prices.\n\n6. Inflation trends during the 2008 and 2011 global commodity shocks suggest that there is quick pass-through from global commodity prices to import prices and headline inflation. This also feeds into higher local prices. However, as global food and fuel prices normalize, import inflation tends to subside quickly, which also gradually brings down local inflation.\n\n7. In order to estimate the impact of global commodity price shocks on Samoa’s inflation over a 12-month period, an analysis is undertaken using the Local Projection Method by Jorda (2005). The local projection equation regresses global commodity prices, NEER (control variable) and their respective lags on Samoa’s inflation over a 12-month forecast horizon, using OLS.2\n\n8. To assess the extent of pass-through from global commodity prices, the analysis is undertaken for three types of inflation – CPI headline inflation, CPI import inflation and CPI local inflation. The impact is estimated separately for global food prices and global oil prices.\n\nLnCPIt+h−Ln(CPIt−1)=αh+∑i=1kβiΔLn(CPIt−i)+∑j=0kθjΔLn(globalcommoditypricest−j)+∑j=0kψjΔLn(NEERt−j)+∑p=1h∂pΔLn(globalcommoditypricest+p)+∑p=1hγpΔLn(NEERt+p)+εt+h\n\nWhere,\n\nCPI: Monthly headline CPI index, CPI import index, or CPI local index.\n\nGlobal commodity prices: World Bank food price index in USD, and Dubai Fateh crude price in USD\n\nNEER: Nominal effective exchange rate\n\nh: 0, 1, ….,12 – Number of months of forecast horizon\n\nk: Number of lags for inflation, global commodity prices and NEER. The lag selection is based on the AIC criteria.\n\nThe results obtained for the local projection coefficient π0 for the forecast horizon (t, t+1, ….., t+h) are presented in the impulse response functions, showing the cumulative impact of a 10 percent change in food prices or oil prices on Samoan prices over a 12-month period.3\n\n9. The results show that changes in global food and oil prices significantly affect both headline and import prices with a 1-3 month lag, with the impact peaking at about 11-12 months and stabilizing thereafter. The lagged impact of oil prices on inflation is consistent with the government’s policy to adjust domestic fuel prices to changes in global oil prices with a two-month lag. The impact of global food prices on headline prices is more than twice that of global oil prices, consistent with the larger weight of imported food in the CPI basket.\n\n10. In addition, the impact of commodity price shocks on import inflation is relatively higher than on headline inflation, given the relatively larger weight of food and oil in the CPI import basket. On the other hand, the impact of global price shocks on local inflation, particularly oil prices, is small and uneven, suggesting that the pass-through from global commodity prices to local goods and services inflation has been historically low.\n\n11. Global commodity prices began to ease somewhat starting July 2022 and are expected to continue moderating into 2023, particularly oil prices. Based on the above local projection estimates, the softening of global food and oil prices since 2022Q3 is expected to begin subtracting from headline inflation in m/m terms starting from 2022Q4 and reduce m/m inflation by about 4.0 percentage points by June 2023, relative to 2022Q3.\n\nAnnex V. Tourism Reopening Experience1\n\nThe prolonged border closure policy has saved lives and livelihoods from the COVID-19 pandemic, but also has brought economic challenges to Samoa’s tourism-reliant economy. The protracted vaccination rollout and the uncertainty about the path of the pandemic delayed the reopening of borders until August 2022. This annex discusses Samoa’s initial reopening experience and projects tourism earnings based on the experience of other small island developing countries.\n\n1. A strict border closure was imposed in March 2020 to insulate Samoa from the coronavirus and was lifted in August 2022. Samoa implemented strict border controls in January 2020 when two suspected cases of COVID-19 were detected, followed up by more stringent measures and full closure of the border from March 2020 to August 2022.2 Since then, the authorities frequently reassessed measures in lieu of new local and international data, keeping borders largely closed until August 2022.\n\nUntil January 2023, Samoa has registered around 16,087 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 29 deaths. The first deaths were registered only in April 2022.3\n\nIn March 2020, after reporting the first suspected cases, Samoa declared a State of Emergency (SOE) imposing a strict border closure and other measures, including public gathering limitations. The authorities adjusted the SOE measures according to changes in local and international conditions, gradually lifting local gathering measures or imposing more strict limitations and short-duration national lockdowns as conditions warranted, but borders remained largely closed.\n\nVaccine rollout started in April 2021 and authorities implemented measures to boost uptake, including a 48-hour lockdown with health teams administering door-to-door vaccines. As of January 2023, more than 96 percent of Samoa’s population has received at least one dose and 89 percent has been fully vaccinated.\n\nOn August 1st, 2022, Samoa’s government ended the two-year SOE and lifted the border closure, permitting foreign nationals to enter the country. Remaining requirements were lifted on September 22nd, 2022—vaccination certificates or pre-departure testing for COVID-19 passengers are no longer required; upon arrival, passengers are advised to wear face masks and continue to take preventative measures.\n\n2. The prolonged tourism halt successfully contained the local spread of the virus, but not without economic costs. Past episodes and challenges in health system coverage partially spurred the authorities’ careful approach to reopening the border.4 Nevertheless, as tourism-related sectors underpin Samoa’s economy and tourism receipts amounted to about 20 percent of GDP pre-pandemic, the closed borders dealt a significant blow to the tourism-related sectors, with sizable spillovers to other sectors. This was the main driver in the cumulative decline of 15 percent in real GDP over FY2020-FY2022.\n\n3. Tourism earnings have increased rapidly since the reopening of border. Tourist arrivals and tourism earnings both saw rapid recoveries to over 40 percent of pre-COVID levels. In September 2022, the highest shares of tourists are from New Zealand (45 percent), Australia (24 percent) and American Samoa (10 percent), with American Samoan tourists recovering the most compared to pre-pandemic levels (to 56 percent of previous arrivals and 64 percent of tourist earnings). In terms of purpose of visit, family visits and holidays brought the highest percentage of arrivals and earnings, but business and conference travel recovered the most compared to pre-pandemic level (61 percent of previous arrivals and 68 percent of tourist earnings).\n\n4. The tourism halt’s negative effects on the tourism and hospitality sector could linger, hampering full recovery. The closure of some facilities, including some upscale resorts and hotels, has reduced capacity, while those facilities in operation have needed to invest to update the infrastructure as maintenance was limited during the pandemic. Additionally, although the authorities promoted some training opportunities in early 2020, the impact of the prolonged border closure on employment in tourism resulted in a loss of human capital as workers migrated to other sectors, including through the seasonal workers employment schemes. The degree of success in addressing these challenges will affect the timeline and magnitude of recovery.\n\n5. To forecast Samoa’s tourism recovery trajectory, the experience from reopening in other countries is studied. While many Caribbean countries reopened earlier, Samoa and many other Pacific Islands reopened their borders in mid-2022. Most of the Caribbean countries reopened their borders in mid-2020, before widespread vaccination had occurred, which in some cases led to severe local outbreaks. Partly as a result, arrivals to Caribbean tourism destinations took around a year and a half, on average, to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels. In the Pacific region, Maldives also reopened in 2020, and took 11 months to reach its pre-pandemic arrivals level. Fiji followed a similar path, but it will likely reach pre-pandemic levels slightly later.\n\n6. In staff’s baseline scenario, a gradual tourism recovery is conservatively assumed. Cross-country experience and Samoa’s first few months of reopening suggest tourism could recover within a two-year time frame. However, pent up travel demand and in Samoa’s case some one-off events (such as the celebration of the 60th anniversary of its independence) may have led to an initial surge in arrivals. Given the projected global economic weakness and remaining pandemic risks, staff’s baseline scenario estimates that Samoa recovers around half of pre-pandemic tourism receipts in FY2023 and FY2024, with arrivals continuing to climb thereafter. In this scenario, real GDP growth is projected at 5.0 percent and 3.6 percent in FY2023 and FY2024 respectively.\n\nBaseline and Illustrative Downside Scenario for Tourism\n\nSource: IMF staff calculations.\n\nBaseline and Illustrative Downside Scenario for Tourism\n\nFY2018-20\n\nAverage FY2023 FY2024 Tourism receipts Baseline 19.4 10.8 11.5 (In percent of GDP) Downside 8.0 8.0 Real GDP Baseline 0.2 5.0 3.6 (In y/y percent change) Downside 1.9 3.0 Reserves Baseline 5.3 7.4 7.1 (In months of imports) Downside 7.3 6.7\n\nSource: IMF staff calculations.\n\nBaseline and Illustrative Downside Scenario for Tourism\n\nFY2018-20\n\nAverage FY2023 FY2024 Tourism receipts Baseline 19.4 10.8 11.5 (In percent of GDP) Downside 8.0 8.0 Real GDP Baseline 0.2 5.0 3.6 (In y/y percent change) Downside 1.9 3.0 Reserves Baseline 5.3 7.4 7.1 (In months of imports) Downside 7.3 6.7\n\nSource: IMF staff calculations.\n\n7. In a downside scenario, while the impact of lower tourism flows would likely be substantial, growth would remain positive and reserve coverage would decline only modestly. The downside scenario assumes a slower recovery in tourism receipts to only about a third of pre-pandemic levels, explained by a combination of stricter travel restrictions in source countries, higher travel costs, and a global economic downturn. In such circumstances, the impact on Samoa’s economy would be substantial, both directly through reduced tourism and indirectly through spillovers to other sectors. While this scenario would reduce economic activity, real GDP growth would remain positive at 1.9 percent in FY2023 and 3 percent in FY2024, according to historical elasticities between tourist inflows and GDP, and between tourism-related and other sectors. Using the EBA-lite coefficient of 0.5 for the impact of a tourism shock on the current account, reserve coverage would decline modestly, reaching 6.7 months of import cover in FY2024, still above adequate levels.\n\nSamoa: Selected COVID-19 milestones\n\nSources: Samoan Authorities; and World Health Organization Coronavirus Dashboard.\n\nSamoa: Selected COVID-19 milestones\n\nJan 27, 2020 Samoa implemented travel restrictions due to the international outbreak of COVID-19, including requirements to travelers to self-quarantine for at least 14 days Mar 18, 2020 Samoa reported the first suspected case of COVID-19 for an entering person Mar 20, 2020 Samoa declared a State of Emergency (SOE) in response to the pandemic prohibiting all international travelers from entering Samoa and limiting public gatherings Apr 11, 2020 The government announced a US$23.6 million package to help the country’s hotel sector May 20, 2020 The government issued an amendment to the COVID-19 State of Emergency Orders lifting domestic lockdown restrictions but maintaining the border closure Aug 6, 2020 Emergency Order 24 was issued ceasing all international travel to and from Samoa except for returning residents, prohibiting access to boats and ships except for trade and fishing, and limiting public gatherings Apr 9, 2021 Samoa received its first doses of COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX facility May 8, 2021 The government confirmed that borders would reopen once 98 percent of the population had been vaccinated Aug 11, 2021 Samoa launched a country-wide door-to-door vaccination campaign Sep 23, 2021 Start of a two-day lockdown to boost COVID-19 vaccination coverage Nov 8, 2021 New Zealand commenced one-way quarantine free travel from Samoa Jan 22, 2022 A 48-hour nationwide lockdown was imposed after 15 COVID-19 cases were confirmed Jan 25, 2022 The nationwide lockdown was extended until 27 January after frontline nurses tested positive for COVID-19, however there was no further community transmission Feb 16, 2022 The Ministry of Health issued a Special Travel Advice for travelers from American Samoa, including that only Samoa residents/citizens would be allowed to enter Samoa March-May, 2022 A domestic outbreak occurred, prompting tight mobility restrictions.
