        "text": "Empathy Is a Force for Innovation, Flourishing, and Intent to Stay\n\nIn the last year, there has been a great deal of discussion about the importance of empathy in the workplace. Many believe that in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and calls for corporate accountability for racial inequities, there is an urgent need for empathic work cultures.1 But is empathy a “feel-good” element—something that is “nice to have”—or is it a strategic imperative?\n\nCatalyst surveyed nearly 900 US employees working across industries to understand the effects of empathic leadership on their experiences at work. We found that empathy is an important driver of employee outcomes such as innovation, engagement, and inclusion—especially in times of crisis. In short, empathy is a must-have in today’s workplace.2\n\nConsider that employees—especially employees of color—have been straining to meet the harsh demands of life during a pandemic, when the fundamental calculus of work, childcare, healthcare, travel, and social interaction has been upended.3 As the uncertainty has dragged on, burnout has become common, turnover is increasing, and some employers are grappling with what has been termed the “Great Resignation.”4 Employees now are looking for managers, leaders, and companies who will not just acknowledge these hardships but put them front and center in a strategy to lead ethically, responsibly, and equitably.\n\nAt many companies, leaders are heeding employee calls for action with more flexible and remote-work options, promises to prioritize racial equity, and other targeted changes.5 They are hoping these steps will stanch the flow of women out of their companies, boost inclusion for people of color, and position their organizations for success in a world where rapid change is the norm and a technological revolution is fundamentally transforming work.6\n\nPrevious Catalyst research shows that we must be mindful to “think people, not just programs.”7 Our current research shows that cultivating empathic leadership is an effective strategy to respond to crisis with the heart and authenticity that many employees crave—and boost productivity.\n\nWhat Is Empathy?\n\nEmpathy is the skill of (1) connecting with others to identify and understand their thoughts, perspectives, and emotions; and (2) demonstrating that understanding with intention, care, and concern.8\n\nAn empathic9 leader is a leader who demonstrates care, concern, and understanding for employees’ life circumstances.\n\nEmpathy helps bond colleagues together and forms the foundation of a resilient and inclusive workplace.10 Although it is often underestimated as a business skill, our findings suggest that empathy is essential to success in the future of work. Here are three things to know:11\n\nIt’s possible to cultivate and develop empathy.\n\nThere are three aspects of empathy: cognitive (head/thinking), affective (heart/feeling), and behavioral (action/doing).\n\nEmpathy links to many positive outcomes that teams can leverage to become more agile and innovative in times of crises.\n\nIn this study, we assessed empathy by asking respondents how often their manager and senior leaders displayed specific behaviors in their interactions. The behaviors measured correspond to the three facets of empathy: cognitive empathy, or engaging with employees to understand their thoughts, emotions, and perspectives; affective empathy, or sharing in or showing similarity to employees’ emotional states, and behavioral empathy, or actions that communicate and demonstrate a sense of empathy for employees.12\n\nEmpathic Leaders Can Help Decrease Burnout\n\nThe brutal and long-lasting pressure of the Covid-19 pandemic has pushed many people to their limits in and out of the workplace.23 In fact, 60% of survey respondents reported that they were experiencing burnout.24 To disentangle the sources of burnout, we asked employees if their burnout was a result of factors in their workplace in general, work experiences related to Covid-19, or in their personal lives.\n\nPeople experience burnout as being frustrated, emotionally exhausted, overextended or stretched to their limits, worn-out and tired, and/or exhausted in the morning at the thought of the day ahead.25 Workplace burnout is considered profound enough to be included in the International Classification of Diseases by the World Health Organization, which defines it as “a syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed.”26\n\nWhen burnout occurs, employee productivity, engagement, and organizational commitment can plummet.27 During times of crisis, leaders must be alert to the potential for employee burnout and take action to prevent it.\n\nBut we also found that empathy on the part of both senior leaders and managers mitigates these disparate experiences, increasing feelings of being respected and valued across gender, race, and ethnicity.\n\nAcross racial and gender groups, there is a 22-to-58-percentage-point difference in employees feeling that their life circumstances are respected and valued when their manager or senior leader is more empathic compared with when their senior leader or manager is less empathic.\n\nThe increases are most pronounced for women of color and White women.\n\nDemonstrating empathy signals to employees that their perspectives and experiences matter. Empathy is a skill that allows managers and leaders to better understand and provide support for employees—especially women of color who have been disproportionately affected by the fallout from Covid-19.40 It also signals, “we value you and respect your unique life circumstances.”\n\nOur data show that practicing empathy to increase women’s sense that their individual life circumstances are valued and respected has downstream consequences for attrition, significantly increasing women’s intentions to stay at their job.41 The data did not show the same relationship for men of color or White men.\n\nTake Action\n\nChallenging circumstances create unparalleled opportunities for empathic leaders. Particularly in times of uncertainty, empathic leaders can foster connections that enhance employees’ ability to innovate and flourish at work. Senior leaders and managers who responded to the instability of 2020-21 with empathy helped their staff adjust to shifting life-work obligations and cope with the stress of the ongoing pandemic and the burden of racial injustice.\n\nBut empathy is not simply a skill that leaders should deploy during times of crisis. Yes, by demonstrating understanding and care in interactions and decision-making, you can help your team in more difficult times by weathering disruptions, such as this once-in-a-lifetime pandemic and other inevitable future crises. But organizations and teams that create a culture of empathy can also encourage more human and equitable interactions and policies at all times. Empathy positions you to be responsive to your team’s needs, facing them not with fear and distrust but with curiosity and openness—which is also essential to genuine and impactful organizational responses to address racial inequity and injustice.\n\nEmployees are counting on you to do better and be better, now and in the future. It is a business imperative to demonstrate that you understand and care about them and that you are invested in creating an atmosphere where they can be authentic, included, and valued at work. Invest in empathy training to develop this important future of work skill for your leaders. By training your leaders to build, better demonstrate, and practice using empathy, you set a foundation for more inclusive, productive, and fulfilling workplaces.\n\nStart with this list of actions based on the different facets of empathy.52\n\nType of Empathy What You Do Six Ways You Can Show Empathy Head/Thinking\n\nCognitive empathy You imagine how your colleague is feeling from their unique perspective.\n\n1. Intentionally discuss employees’ feelings and then reflect what they’ve just shared to make sure you understand correctly—without diverting the conversation to your own experiences.\n\n2. Make it a priority to meet with and get to know employees at all levels as whole people, not as “just workers.”\n\nHeart/Feeling\n\nAffective empathy You feel concern and/or have similar emotions as your colleague.\n\n3. If an employee or team shares an emotional experience or difficulty, give them the space to fully explain without interjecting or diverting the conversation.\n\n4. Don’t assume your teams and employees know you care about them. Say it when you feel it: “I care about you; I’m concerned, and I understand how challenging this is.”\n\nAction/Doing\n\nBehavioral empathy You demonstrate active listening and a desire to understand more about your colleague’s feelings, experiences, or reactions.\n\n5. In one-on-one interactions, whether in person or virtually, if someone pauses while speaking to you, count to five slowly in your head, giving them time to find the right words and indicating that you are listening, and they can keep talking if they wish.\n\n6. Pay attention to employee facial expressions and body language to recognize how they may be feeling; maintain good body posture and eye contact, as culturally appropriate, to show that you are listening and not multi-tasking.\n\nMethodology\n\nRecruitment and Sample: Respondents were recruited through a panel services company. At the time of the survey, all respondents were full-time workers. Sample demographics are provided in the “About This Study” section.\n\nSurvey: After obtaining informed consent, respondents completed an online survey about “technology and work-life experiences.” The survey took approximately 20 minutes to complete and included largely multiple-choice, Likert-type questions and a few open-ended queries, including the ones from which the quotes above were drawn.\n\nStatistical analyses: All data were analyzed with a p-value criterion of .01 or less. All statistical analyses went through an independent fact-check process; colleagues with advanced research and statistical training who have not worked on the report fact-checked the appropriateness of the analyses and the accuracy of reported values."
