        "text": "The U.S.R.T. (Underwater Search and Recovery Team) was developed over 50 years ago to establish the capability for underwater search of evidence and victims of water related incidents.\n\nThe Macomb County Sheriff’s U.S.R.T. is currently comprised of 13 full time deputies who are highly trained and certified through the Professional Association of Dive Instructors (PADI), the largest certifying agency of divers in the world.\n\nThe U.S.R.T. is the sole underwater search and recovery team in Macomb County. As such, the Macomb Sheriff U.S.R.T. uses its resources and personnel to assist any public safety agency in Macomb County. As members of the Region Two Search and Recovery Team that includes neighboring counties, our unit has also participated in mutual aid operations.\n\nThrough County, State, and Federal funding, the team is outfitted and trained with the latest equipment and technology. U.S.R.T. is equipped with the latest state of the art equipment such as Side Scan Sonar, Underwater Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV), Underwater Wireless Communications and Underwater Propulsion Systems.\n\nStandard operation\n\nUpon reports received that a drowning has occurred the U.S.R.T. supervisor and team leader would proceed to the body of water to be searched. After making assessment of water depth, clarity, credibility of information received, associated risks to divers, a determination is then made for search plan, time, and location of team activation. Upon team arrival at scene, when required, high tech imaging side scan sonar devices and an underwater robot are utilized. Upon confirmation, various methods of searches are performed, which will lead to a successful recovery while minimizing the dangers to the U.S.R.T. members.\n\nSelection and training\n\nMacomb Sheriff U.S.R.T. members are selected based on their S.C.U.B.A. skill levels and their coping abilities underwater in confined spaces. The diver's ability to function in zero visibility conditions, while encapsulated in a tri-laminate dry suit, under duress, is also used for consideration. All team members receive training up through the certification of Master Diver. The U.S.R.T. conducts monthly training exercises year round in preparation of conducting recoveries in virtually any weather or water conditions.\n\nScope of operations\n\nIn the past, the U.S.R.T. has assisted the Department of Roads in underwater bridge structure inspections on the Gratiot Bridge in Mt. Clemens, the Michigan DNR Fisheries Biologist in obtaining specimens from the bottom of Lake St. Clair in Anchor Bay, our Detective Bureau in recovering everything from murder victims to weapons used to commit crimes, narcotics, stolen property, and victim recovery.\n\nMission statement\n\nThe members of the Sheriff’s U.S.R.T. are dedicated to serving the community and providing answers and closure to the families of the victim’s located in the waterways of Macomb County and Southeast Michigan.\n\nOur Honor Guard is a volunteer unit comprised of sworn officers from all divisions of the department. Its mission is to enhance the professional image of the Macomb County Sheriff’s Office, and the County of Macomb. However, the unit’s priority is to honor and pay respects to fallen Officers and their families.\n\nOur members dedicate their personal time to attend funerals and memorial services for our brothers and sisters in Law Enforcement, Fire Services and EMS that have lost their lives protecting and serving our citizens and our communities. Many times, during these funerals our team is requested to perform different honors during the service. In the past we have assisted as the standing color guard, casket team and casket watch.\n\nIn May each year, we travel to Washington D.C. to participate in the National Law Enforcement Memorial Week. This is to represent our department with thousands of other departments to Honor and pay tribute to the men and women who have served and sacrificed to make our society safer. A few of the events include escorting the surviving family members of Fallen Officers into the National Police Memorial and guarding the Memorial Wreath. We also compete against Honor Guards from across the country in Drill and Ceremony competitions.\n\nEvery year we have continued to honor our own fallen officers by participating in wreath laying ceremonies honoring their sacrifice for their communities. The unit attends and provides services during retiree funeral services. Honoring the commitment and service that these members gave to the department and the community during their careers.\n\nOur Honor Guard also participates in local community services such as Shop with a Cop, Macomb Fallen Heroes Memorial, Law Enforcement Appreciation Night at Jimmy John’s Field, and the Macomb Charitable Foundation. The unit regularly participates these events be presenting the national colors and other details.\n\nOur Honor Guard has been honored to represent the National Law Enforcement Memorial by presenting the National Colors for the Detroit Red Wings Law Enforcement Night and the Detroit Tigers Law Enforcement Night.\n\nThe Honor Guard is self-funded unit. All our financial support has come solely from Honor Guard Members and donations we receive from citizens. The donations allow the unit to purchase uniforms and equipment for each new member.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the Honor Guard, please contact Sgt. Jason Conklin at Jason.Conklin@macombcountymi.gov\n\nThe Macomb County Sheriff’s Office S.W.A.T. team is a multi-jurisdictional tactical team whose mission is to save lives. It is the S.W.A.T. team’s responsibility to respond to barricaded persons, hostage incidents, emotionally disturbed persons, civil disturbances, work and school place violence situations, terrorist incidents, security details, Presidential and dignitary protection details along with any other special assignments from the Sheriff. Every officer assigned to the S.W.A.T. team is willing to give their lives to save or protect the people living, working, or playing in Macomb County.\n\nThe S.W.A.T. team is equipped to function tactically in many different environments including a chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or explosive environment (CBRNE). With an eye on current events, the Sheriff has required this training and equipment so the S.W.A.T. team can better respond to an active violence attack, terrorist attack, criminal act, or hostage situation to achieve the goal of preserving life and serving the community.\n\nThe S.W.A.T. team has a Sniper/Observer team. These specialized operators all have received training from the F.B.I. They are used in many situations to assist with long range observations of scenes and incidents, providing protection to the public during large scale public events.\n\nTactical doctors and medics have been added to the team to immediately address injuries sustained by bystanders, officers, and suspects during a critical incident.
