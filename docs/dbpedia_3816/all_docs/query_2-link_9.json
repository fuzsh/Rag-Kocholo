This view has a heavy vertical line in its center.\n\nNational Maritime Museum photo # 2959 -- Etching by W.L. Wyllie, depicting HMS Calliope steaming out of Apia Harbor into the teeth of the hurricane.

The artist's vantage point is from on board Trenton, with Calliope passing nearby (seen from off her port quarter).\n\nNational Maritime Museum photo # A.8339 -- Painting showing HMS Calliope escaping from Apia Harbor during the storm. The view shows Calliope from off her starboard side, with a huge wave breaking amidships."
