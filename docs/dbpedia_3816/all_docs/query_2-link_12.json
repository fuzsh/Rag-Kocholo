        "text": "S. M. S. HYAENE\n\nThis is a cap tally from the Werft personnel serving on the 1878 steam and sail gunboat, SMS Hyäne (hyena).\n\nIn 1882 the Hyäne set off on an expedition to the South Seas including the colony of New Guinea. She also took part in the founding of Swakopmund in German South West Africa after land Hauptmann Curt von François there in\n\nSMS Hyäne twice saw action in Cameroon. During the Abo Rebellion of 1891 (alongside the gunboat SMS Habicht) and in the the Dahomey Slaves Rebellion of 1893. On both occasions she bombarded rebel villages and landed armed sailors.\n\nShe did not see action in the First World War and after the war it was sold as a merchant vessel and sank in Dieppe in 1924 after a cargo fire.\n\nRecommended External Links- Medal Net - Cameroon 1891 & Medal Net - Cameroon 1893\n\nSMS Hyäne\n\nPhoto from Wikimedia\n\nS. M. S. MOEWE\n\nThis is a cap tally from the Matrosen personnel serving on the SMS Möwe (seagull). There were three German ships in the Imperial era with this title, all of which saw overseas service.\n\nThe first was a Habicht class gunboat launched in 1879. It was appointed to the German West Africa Squadron and took part in the establishment of Cameroon as a German colony in 1884. In 1888-89 it was part of the German fleet deployed to East Africa to crush the Abushiri Rebellion and in 1895 was deployed to German New Guinea. She was withdrawn from service in 1905.\n\nRecommended External Links- Medal Net - German East Africa 1888-89 and Deutsche-Schutzgebiete - SMS Moewe\n\nThe second was an armed survey ship launched in 1905. She surveyed the coast of New Guinea but at the outbreak of the First World War she was stationed off East Africa. She was scuttled in Dar Es Salaam harbour and her guns and crew served on land and on Lake Tanganyika with the Schutztruppe.\n\nThe third SMS Möwe was a former freightliner named Pungo, which was equipped as a minelayer and armed raider in 1916. On two raiding missions she captured or sank forty allied vessels. After the war she continued in use as a freightliner renamed the Oldenburg and was sunk by British aircraft off the coast of Norway in 1945.\n\nThe first SMS Möwe in Sydney Harbour\n\nPhoto from thy William Hall collection, Australian National Maritime Museum/ WikiCommons\n\n(S. M. S.) ADLER\n\nThis is a cap tally from the Matrosen personnel serving on the SMS Adler (eagle). Note the the letters SMS before the ship's name were not used before 1890.\n\nSMS Adler was a Habicht class gunboat launched in 1883 and served in the Samoan Crisis in 1888 when about 150 sailors from the Alder, SMS Olga and SMS Eber were landed near Apia to confront Samoan rebels under King Mataafa at the Battle of Vailele. The Adler was wrecked in a storm off Apia in 1889.\n\nWreck of the SMS Adler, Apia 1889\n\nPhoto from U.S. Naval Historical Center / WikiCommons\n\nS. M. S. SCHWALBE\n\nThis is a cap tally from the Matrosen personnel serving on the SMS Schwalbe.\n\nThe SMS Schwalbe (swallow) was a Schwalbe class unprotected cruiser launched in 1887. She first served off East Africa during the Abushiri Rebellion in 1888, providing coastal blockade, artillery bombardment and landing parties to help put down the rebellion alongside SMS Leipzig, SMS Möwe, SMS Pfeil, SMS Sophie, SMS Carola and SMS Olga.\n\nIn 1900, during the Anglo-Boer War, SMS Schwalbe returned to African waters to protect German merchant ships from the British Royal Navy. The Royal Navy had seized several German vessels causing a diplomatic incident but the threat of war was averted. The Schwalbe then sailed for China to assist in the Boxer Rebellion and took part in the blockade of the River Yangtze. She returned to Germany in 1902 for repairs and was put on the naval reserve. During the First World War she did not see active service and was used as a floating barracks. SMS Schwalbe was scrapped in 1922.\n\nSMS Schwalbe\n\nPhoto from Wikipedia/Bundesarchiv\n\nS. M. S. BUSSARD\n\nThis is a cap tally from the Matrosen personnel serving on the SMS Bussard (buzzard). SMS Bussard was an unprotected cruiser of the Bussard class launched in 1890. The Bussard class were the last ship of the Imperial Navy to be equipped with auxiliary sails in addition to their steam engines. There were six ships of the Bussard class, the other five being SMS Falke, SMS Seeadler, SMS Cormoran, SMS Condor and SMS Geier. All six saw service overseas.\n\nSMS Bussard first served in the East Asian division where she saw action against a local uprising on Samoa in 1893. She also saw action at the Storming of the Taku Forts during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. In 1902 she was transferred to East Africa where during the Maji-Maji Rebellion, she assisted the Schutztruppe by ferrying troops up and down the coast of German East Africa to the rebellious areas. Landing parties of sailors from the ship were also used to secure the ports. She returned to Germany in 1910 and was scrapped in 1913.\n\nSMS Bussard\n\nPhoto © Frankfurt University Archive\n\nS. M. S. SEEADLER\n\nThis is a cap tally from the Werft personnel serving on the SMS Seeadler (sea eagle). There were two ships named Seeadler.\n\nThe first was an unprotected cruiser of the Bussard class launched in 1892. She saw the longest continuous overseas service of any major ship in the Imperial German navy, visiting New York in 1893, then being based in East Africa and New Guinea and seeing action in both the Maji-Maji Rebellion in East Africa 1905-06 and the Boxer Rebellion in China. Her last posting was to the coast of East Africa until January 1914, when she was replaced by the SMS Königsberg. The Seeadler was retired from service and used to store mines. She was destroyed in an accidental explosion in 1917.\n\nRecommended External Link - Article on Traditionsverband on SMS Bussard im Maji-Maji Aufstand\n\nThe second Seeadler was a captured American three masted sailing ship converted to use as commerce raider in 1916. She has a successful career capturing fifteen allied vessels until she was wreck off French Polynesia in 1917.\n\nThe Cruiser SMS Seeadler, New York 1893\n\nPhoto from WikiCommons\n\nS. M. S. COMORAN\n\nThese are two cap tallies from the Matrosen and Werft personnel serving on the SMS Cormoran (cormorant) .\n\nThe Cormoran was a Bussard class unprotected cruiser launched in 1892. She was assigned to the East Asia station in 1894 and took part in the occupation of Kiautschcou and Tsingtao in 1897, the Samoan Crisis of 1898, the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 and after modernisation in Germany, in the Sokehs Rebellion on Ponape in New Guinea in 1910-11.\n\nWhen The First World War broke out she was unfit for action and under going repairs in Tsingtao. Her guns and crew were first deployed on the captured Russian vessel Ryazan, then later used on the land defences. The Cormoran was sctulled in Tsingtao Harbour and the crew became prisoners of the Japanese after the fall of the city.\n\nSMS Cormoran, Brisbane 1901\n\nPhoto from the John Oxley Library, State Library of Queensland/WikiCommons\n\nS. M. S. HERTHA\n\nThese are three cap tallies from the Matrosen, Werft and Schiffsjunge (ships' boys in red) serving on the SMS Hertha.\n\nSMS Hertha was a protected cruiser of the Victoria Louise class launched in 1897. She served in the East Asia Squadron and during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 along with SMS Hansa, SMS Iltis and SMS Gefion bombarded the Taku Forts. Her sailors then took part in the successful storming of the forts.\n\nDuring the First World War she saw limited active service before being used as a floating barracks. SMS Hertha was scrapped in 1920.\n\nOfficers and Men of SMS Hertha in China\n\nPhoto from WikiCommons/Bundesarchiv\n\nS. M. S. HANSA\n\nThese are two cap tallies from the Matrosen and Werft personnel serving on SMS Hansa. SMS Hansa was a protected cruiser of the Victoria Louise class launched in 1898.\n\nShe served in the East Asia Squadron during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 along with SMS Hertha, SMS Iltis and SMS Gefion bombarded the Taku Forts. Her sailors then took part in the successful storming of the forts.\n\nDuring the Russo-Japanese War, SMS Hansa (along with the protected cruiser SMS Fürst Bismarck, the gun boats SMS Tiger and SMS Luchs and the cruisers Hertha and Geier) took part in the forcible internment of the Russian battleship Tsesarevich and three destroyers at Tsingtao in 1904.\n\nDuring the First World War she was used as a floating barracks and was scrapped in 1920.\n\nSailor from the SMS Hansa\n\nwearing the 1900 China Campaign Medal\n\nPhoto © JW Collection\n\nS. M. S. ILTIS\n\nThis is a cap tally from the Matrosen personnel serving on the SMS Iltis (polecat). SMS Iltis was the first of six Iltis class of gunboats and was launched in 1898. Her sister ships were the SMS Jaguar, SMS Tiger, SMS Luchs, SMS Panther and SMS Eber. All six served overseas.\n\nThe Iltis served in the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900 and suffered heavy casualties from Chinese artillery during the storming of the Taku Forts. For this action the ship was awarded Prussia's highest decoration for bravery, the Pour-le-Mérite (see Prussian Medals). This was the only occasion on which a ship rather than an individual was awarded the honour.\n\nAfter the rebellion the Iltis remained on service in China as part of the East Asia Fleet based at Tsingtao. She also stayed at Tsingtao during the siege of 1914 (along with her sister ships the gunboats SMS Jaguar, SMS Tiger and SMS Luchs, the light cruiser SMS Cormoran, the minesweeper Lauting, the river gunboat Taku, the torpedo boat S90 and the Austro-Hungarian protected cruiser SMS Kaiserin Elisabeth). Aside from the S90, all were scuttled in the harbour with their guns and crew then fighting on land until Tsingtao finally surrendered in November 1914. The crew were then kept as Prisoners of War in Japan until the end of the war.Recommended External Link - Tsingtau Info\n\nSMS Iltis showing the PLM cross on her bow\n\nPhoto © Deceptico from his Grandfather's Collection\n\nS. M. S. JAGUAR\n\nThis is a cap tally from the Matrosen personnel serving on the SMS Jaguar.\n\nThe Jaguar was an Iltis class gunboat launched in 1898 and along with three of her sister ships, was posted to China and the German naval base at Tsingtao. The four Iltis class gunboats were scuttled in the harbour with their guns and crew then fighting on land until Tsingtao finally surrendered in November 1914.

LUCHS\n\nThese are two cap tallies from the Matrosen and Werft personnel serving on the SMS Luchs (lynx).\n\nThe Luchs was an Iltis class gunboat launched in 1899 and along with three of her sister ships, was posted to China and the German naval base at Tsingtao.\n\nDuring the Russo-Japanese War, SMS Luchs took part in the forcible internment of the Russian battleship Tsesarevich and three destroyers at Tsingtao in 1904.\n\nDuring the First World War, the four Iltis class gunboats were scuttled in Tsingtao harbour with their guns and crew then fighting on land until the city finally surrendered in November 1914.

PANTHER\n\nThese are two cap tallies from the Matrosen and Werft personnel serving on the SMS Panther. SMS Panther was an Iltis class gunboat launched in 1901. She was involved in several examples of overseas Gunboat Diplomacy.\n\nIn 1902 she sailed to Haiti to destroy a Haitian rebel gunboat which had itself captured a German steamer. This action could potentially have caused offence in America, contradicting the Monroe Doctrine of opposing European encroachments on the Americas but no action was taken.\n\nIn 1902-03 she served as part of the allied (British, German and Italian) fleet taking part in the blockade of Venezuelan ports in 1902-03. In January 1903 she bombarded Venezuelan Fort San Carlos. On this occasion the United States did take offence and sent a fleet to warn\n\nIn 1911 the Panther was sent to the port of Agadir to protect German civilians and to put pressure on any French claims on territory, in what became known as the Agadir or Second Moroccan Crisis. War was averted only by negotiation between the European Powers once again settled in favour of France (who took full control of Morocco the following year). Germany was placated with former French territory in the Congo added to German Cameroon.\n\nRecommended External Link - Black's Academy\n\nSMS Panther\n\nPhoto from WikiCommons\n\nS. M. S. EBER\n\nThis is a cap tally from the Matrosen personnel serving on the SMS Eber (boar or hog).\n\nThe first gunboat Eber was launched in 1887 and served in Samoa the following year. Along with the Adler she was wrecked in a storm at Apia in 1889.\n\nThe second SMS Eber was the last of the Iltis class gunboats launched in 1902. She was posted to the German colonies of West Africa. When the First World War broke out she sailed from German South West Africa to Brazil. There she transferred her guns and most of the crew to arm the steamer Cap Trafalgar for a raiding career.\n\nThe Eber was then interned in Brazil where she was eventually scuttled to avoid capture when Brazil declared war on Germany in 1917.\n\nRecommended External Link- Axis History Forum Post on the SMS Eber in Brazil\n\nSMS Eber alongside the much larger Cap Trafalgar, Brazil 1914\n\nPhoto from WikiCommons\n\nS. M. S. KOENIGSBERG\n\nThis is a cap tally from the Werft personnel serving on the SMS Königsberg (the former capital of East Prussia, now known as Kaliningrad in Russia). There were two German ships in the First World War with this title.\n\nThe first and more famous of the two was a Königsberg class light cruiser, launched in 1905 and stationed off East Africa when the First World War broke out. Initially she raided allied shipping in the Indian Ocean and sank the British ship SMS Pegasus in Zanzibar harbour. She was then forced to seek refuge in the Rufiji Delta in need of engine repairs. There she was trapped and sunk by monitors of the Royal Navy in 1915. Her crew and guns then fought alongside the Schutztruppe in the land campaign in East Africa (see Königsberg Guns Page).\n\nA second light cruiser named SMS Königsberg was launched in Germany later in 1915 and took part in the Operation Albion landings in the Gulf of Latvia in 1917. After the war she entered French service as the Metz and was scrapped in 1936.\n\nThis pristine condition tally was most likely issued to a member of the second ship's crew. Or it may have been privately made after the war for a veteran of the first SMS Königsberg.\n\nSMS Königsberg\n\ndestroyed in the Rufiji Delta, 1915\n\nPhoto by Walter Dobbertin from WikiCommons/Bundesarchiv\n\nS. M. S. EMDEN\n\nPhoto by Sebastien Grenda at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra\n\nA white naval cap from the SMS Emden bearing the gold lettering of the Matrosen on the tally.\n\nThe SMS Emden was a Dresden class light cruiser launched in 1908 and posted to the East Asia squadron based at Tsingtao in 1910. She took part in the suppression of the Sokehs Rebellion on Ponape in 1910-11 and in 1913 (along with British and Japanese ships) shelled a rebel Chinese fort on the Yangtze.\n\nWhen the First World War broke out the Emden, under the command of Korvettenkapitän Karl von Müller, set sail from Tsingtao to cause mayhem amongst allied shipping in the Indian Ocean and bombard enemy ports (including Madras in British India). The allies put vast efforts into catching the SMS Emden (at one point having over 60 warships involved in the search) but she eluded them, capturing and sinking thousands of tons of Entente shipping along the way. In November 1914 she was finally cornered off the Cocos Islands and sunk by the Australian light cruiser HMAS Sydney. The surviving crew of the SMS Emden were uniquely honoured for their bravery by being allowed to add the suffix '-Emden' to their surnames. To this day some of their descendants still carry this additional name.Recommended External Link - History Net page on the SMS Emden\n\nWreck of SMS Emden off North Keeling Island\n\nPhoto by Allan C Green, State Library of Victoria/WikiCommons\n\nS. M. S. AYESHA\n\nThis is a cap tally from the Matrosen personnel serving on the SMS Ayesha. No tallies were made for the crew at the time, this would be a post war item probably made to recognise a veteran of the Ayesha.\n\nThe Ayesha was a three masted schooner, captured by the SMS Emden and used by their landing party to sail a desperate mission across the Indian Ocean from the Cocos Islands to Dutch Sumatra and from there to a rendezvous with the North German Lloyd steamer Choising. The Ayesha was scuttled and the crew made their way to the Arabian Peninsular and Ottoman territory. Along the way the crew met many hardships including a dire shortage of provisions and attacks by Arab bandits.\n\nThey eventually returned to Germany and were decorated by the Kaiser himself. Their exploits are recorded in the film 'Die Männer der Emden' -the Men of the Emden'\n\nCrew of the SMS Emden with\n\nSMS Ayesha in the Background\n\nPhoto from Illustrated War News - Part 21\n\nS. M. S. GOEBEN\n\nThese are three cap tallies from SMS Goeben (named after the Prussian general of the Franco-Prussian War, August Karl von Goeben). The top and bottom are from the Matrosen and Werft personnel under German command. The centre one is from when the ship was under nominal Ottoman Turkish command.\n\nThe SMS Goeben was the second of two Moltke class battle cruisers and was launched in 1911. At the outbreak of the First World War, she formed the German Mediterranean Sea Division along with the light cruiser SMS Breslau. After bombarding the French bases at Bône and Philippeville in Algeria they handed themselves over to the Ottoman navy rather than surrender to the overwhelming power of the allied navies in the Mediterranean. Once under the Ottoman flag they bombarded the Russian ports of Sevastopol and Odessa thus precipitating a Russian declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire thus bringing them into the war on the German side. During the war the two ships remained on patrol in the Black Sea while sailors from the ships also served as machine gunners on the Gallipoli front. Under the Ottoman flag the Goeben was renamed the TCG Yavuz Sultan Selim (after Sultan Selim I) and remained in Turkish service until 1950 (being renamed TCG Yavuz in 1936). It was finally scrapped in 1973.\n\nCap for the SMS Goeben in Ottoman Service\n\nPhoto from Internationales Maritimes Museum Hamburg © Mark Schellenberg 2016\n\nS. M. S. BRESLAU\n\nThese are two cap tallies from the Matrosen personnel serving on the SMS Breslau (named after the capital city of Prussian Silesia, now Wrocław in Poland). The top one is from when the ship was under German command. The bottom one is from when the ship was under nominal Ottoman Turkish command.\n\nSMS Breslau was a Magdeburg class cruiser launched in 1911. Together with the SMS Goeben, the Breslau formed the German Mediterranean Division. The Breslau deployed the Marine Detachment Skutari to Albania in 1913. In 1914 along with the Goeben, she put herself under Ottoman command and was renamed the TCG Midilli (the Turkish name for the Aegean island of Lesbos). During the Battle of Imbros off the Dardanelles in January 1918, she struck a total of five mines and sank with most of her crew. The Second World War German naval commander and briefly the last Führer of the Third Reich served on the SMS Breslau.\n\nSMS Breslau\n\nin Ottoman service as the TCG Midilli\n\nPhoto from Bundesarchiv/WikiCommons\n\nS. M. TORPEDOBOOT S. 90.\n\nThese are two cap tallies from the Matrosen and Werft personnel serving on the SM Torpedoboot S. 90\n\nThe S90 was the first of a class of ocean going torpedo boats (numbered 90-101) and was launched in 1899. She was part of the East Asian Squadron based at Tsingtao.\n\nDuring the Siege of Tsingtao in 1914 she broke out through enemy lines firing torpedoes at Japanese ships along the way and beached on the Chinese coast. Her crew ended up interned at Nanking in neutral China.\n\nS90 in Kiel, 1901\n\nS. M. TORPEDOBOOT TAKU\n\nThese are two cap tallies from the Matrosen and Werft personnel serving on the torpedo boat Taku.\n\nThe Taku was made in Germany in 1898 for sale to the Chinese government. It was then captured from the Chinese during the Boxer Rebellion and thenceforth used by the German Imperial Navy to serve from Tsingtao in Chinese coastal waters and along the River Yangtze. From 1902 she was armed with two 5cm guns and two torpedo tubes.\n\nWhen the first World War broke out the Taku was in Tsingtao having been damaged in a grounding the previous year. On 29 September 1914 she was scuttled and her guns and crew served on land. After the fall of Tsingtao the survivors became prisoners of war in Japan.\n\nTorpedo Boat Taku run aground, 1913\n\nPhoto from WikiCommons\n\nS. M. S. SHAMIEN\n\nThese are two cap tallies from the Matrosen and Werft personnel serving on the SMS Shamien.\n\nThe Shamien (sometimes spelled Schamien on tallies) was a small (24metre) Chinese river boat built in 1899 as Tong Cheong for the Kowloon-dock Company in Hong Kong and commissioned into German service on 20 October 1900 as the first German river gunboat in China.\n\nShe was equipped and crewed by twelve men of the SMS Luchs (and six Chinese sailors). She served on the Pearl River at Canton until February 1904 when she was sold and replaced by the SMS Tsingtao.\n\nSMS Shamien\n\nS. M. S. VATERLAND\n\nThese are two cap tallies from the Matrosen and Werft personnel serving on the SMS Vaterland.\n\nSMS Vaterland was a river gunboat made in Germany and shipped in sections to Shanghai where she was assembled in 1904 along with her sister ship SMS Tsingtao. The Vaterland joined British and French vessels patrolling the River Yangtze and was involved in putting down several incidents of local unrest.\n\nWhen the First World War broke out, SMS Vaterland was left at Nanjing with a small crew, while the bulk of her men made the journey overland to join the defenders of Tsingtao. When China decaled war on Germany in 1917, the Vaterland was was seized. After the First World War she served in the Chinese and from 1935 in the Manchukuo Navy under the name Li Sui.\n\nSMS Vaterland as the Li Sui in Chinese Service\n\nPhoto from WikiCommons\n\nMATR. ART. DETACHMENT KIAUTSCHOU.\n\nThis is a cap tally from the Kiautschou Naval Artillery Detachment which was formed in 1898 at the same time as the III. Seebataillon to protect the newly leased German territory of Kiautschou in China with its port of Tsingtao.\n\nThe single artillery detachment of 1898 was expanded into several batteries of heavy guns in land emplacements defending Tsingtao from land and sea by 1914 .\n\n21cm Gun of the Tsingtao Naval Batteries 1914\n\nPhoto from Bundesarchiv / WikiCommons\n\n1. MATROSENARTILLERIE KIAUTSCHOU. 1.\n\nHere are cap tallies from the four naval artillery companies that were based at the German territory of Kiautschou in China in 1914.\n\nThe Kiautschou Naval Artillery Detachment was expanded from 1902 into two artillery companies. This was dispalyed on a cap tallies as \"1. MATROSENARTILLERIE KIAUTSCHOU. 1.\" and \"2. MATROSENARTILLERIE KIAUTSCHOU. 2.\" respectively. In 1905 a third company was added and in 1906 a fourth, each with corresponding tallies.\n\nIn 1909 a depot company of the Kiautschou Artillery was formed and wore the same cap tally but without the company numbers.\n\nIn 1914 volunteers and reservists joining the Kiautschou naval artillery wore a letter E for Ersatzkompanie on thier tallies as \"E. MATROSENARTILLERIE KIAUTSCHOU. E.\"\n\nCap from the Depot Company, without numbers\n\nMATROSENARTILLERIE KIAUTSCHOU\n\nPhoto © Doppler Collection\n\nGOUVERNEMENT KIAUTSCHOU\n\nThese are two cap tallies from personnel serving in the Kiautschou government. Unlike other overseas possessions, the German territory of Kiautschou in China (including the port of Tsingtao) was directly governed by the Imperial navy.\n\nFrom 1900 other ranking personnel of the naval government wore these cap tallies.\n\nGovernor's Palace, Tsingtao\n\nPhoto from Bundesarchiv/WikiCommons\n\nSONDERKOMMANDO DARDENELLEN\n\nThis is a cap tally from the Sonderkommando Dardenellen (Dardanelles naval support command).\n\nThis was a specialist naval unit under Admiral Usedom, consisting of five hundred naval artillery officers and men sent out to assist and fight alongside the Turkish artillery at the Dardanelles Straights in 1914. It was this additional expertise along with German Krupp guns, that made the Turkish artillery so deadly to the British, ANZAC and French forces at Gallipoli.\n\nRecommended External Link - Gallipoli1915.de\n\nTurkish Krupp Artillery under German Command, Dardanelles\n\nPhoto from WikiCommons/Bundesarchiv\n\nMARINE FELD COMP. = DEUTSCH OST AFRIKA\n\nThis is a cap tally fro a veteran of a Naval Field Company in German East Africa.\n\nDuring the First World War sailors from several merchant and navy vessels stranded in East Africa (such as the SMS Königsberg and SMS Möwe) were formed into units to fight alongside the Schutztruppe. Most of the Königsberg's crew formed an Abteilung at Dar Es Salaam, while the Möwe crew fought on Lake Tanganyika.\n\nIt is very unlikely however that they made their own tallies in Africa and so this example was almost certainly made for a veteran after the war.\n\nGerman Sailors training in East Africa c1915\n\nPhoto © Peter Klein"
