        "text": "42 ships (1889-1914)\n\nOverview of American Gunboats in ww1\n\nAmong the first ships built for the “new navy”, the “old” one being the one built by the Union to blockade the Confederate states in 1861-65, the Dolphin and the ships that followed has been seen as cheap alternative to cruisers.\n\nThey were, in fact, small protected cruisers, which duty was essentially to “show the flag” on distant overseas stations, freeing the main fleet to be available for large scale oceanic actions.\n\nSo these gunboats (and its there only the ocean-going ones, not the riverine gunboats of that era) saw a lot of the world, most participated in the war of 1898 before ww1. They often featured near-obsolete barquentine rigging like most foreign ships of the same type because of the lack of coaling facilities far from home waters.\n\nThey also had a long carrier, through the interwar and up to ww2 for some, often converted as school ships, revenue cutters and coast guards depending of a Secretariat of State and not the Navy. Also included in this chapter are captured Spanish gunboats, often of small tonnage, in the Philippines and Cuba as a result of the “splendid little war” of 1898.\n\nUSS Dolphin (1886)\n\nFirst ship of the “new navy” she was authorized under the act 3.3.1883, at first classified as a dispatch boat, with light barque rig with no head gear, later rigged as a three-masted schooner, and then reduced to two masts. She served for most of her career as a dispatch ship for the secretary of the Navy. Its upper deck forecastle 6 in had a full traverse, later replaced by two 4in/40 QF guns each side, and its artillery reduced to one 6-pdr (47mm) and six 3-pdr (37mm)\n\n-Displacement & Dimensions: 1486 tons, 78 x 9.7 x 4.3m\n\n-Propulsion: 4 cyl boilers, 1 shaft VC, 2255 ihp 16 kn.\n\n-Crew: 152\n\n-Armament (origin): 6 x 6in/30 (152mm), 2 x 6-pdr (76mm), 4 x 47mm revolver\n\nYorktown class gunboats (1889)\n\nThe Yorktown class units, initially classified as light cruisers, had a comfortable armament. The other two units of this class, Concord and Bennington, were put into service in 1891. The first was reclassified as an all-purpose ship, then a depot ship, and finally a customs ship from 1914. The USS Bennington suffered a terrible fire from Boilers in 1905 and was removed from the lists and sold in 1910.\n\n-Displacement & Dimensions: 1700 tons and 1920 pcs, 74.52 x 10.97 x 4.27m\n\n-Propulsion: 4 boilers, 2 propellers, 3400 hp.

The former had later its mainmast removed and armament reduced to 4 x 4in/40 QF guns. Originally the guns were mounted in sponsons before the forecastle and poop. On the USS Bancroft (which was lighter at 839 tonnes), guns were mounted port and starboard between the forecastle and poop. She became a revenue cutter Itasca and TTs were removed in 1899.\n\n-Displacement: 867 tons, 900 FL\n\n-Dimensions: 57.3 x 9.44 x 3.5m\n\n-Propulsion: 4 cyl. boilers, 1 propeller, 1000 ihp, 11.4 kn max.\n\n-Crew: 200\n\n-Armament (origin): 6 x 4in (127mm), 4 x 3in (76mm), 2 x 6pdr (47mm), 4 x 1pdr (37mm)\n\nMachias class gunboats (1891)\n\nThe two USS Machias and Castine gunboats were real small cruisers, designed for long crossings. They were commissioned in 1893 and 1894, but never fired a shot in anger, and spent a peaceful career without notable story during the Great War.\n\nUSS Castine served as submersible tanker from 1909, her armament reduced. The Machias was sold to the Mexicans in 1920, which employed her until 1935.\n\n-Displacement & Dimensions: 1045 tons, 62 x 4.6 x 4 m\n\n-Propulsion: 4 Babcock boilers, 2 propellers, 1250 hp and 16 knots max.\n\n-Crew: 198\n\n-Armament: 6 x 4in (127 mm), 4 x 3in (76mm), 2 x 1pdr (37mm)\n\nUSS Nashville (1895)\n\nThe USS Nashville was a high-tonnage patrol gunboat designed to serve the coasts of South America and the Gulf of Mexico.

The first survived as a training vessel under the name of IX-30 Dover until 1946, the second was struck off in 1932. They had a low draft and could therefore operate on the rivers.\n\n-Displacement 1400/1700 tons FL\n\n-Dimensions 76,42 x 12,47 x 2,74 m\n\n-Propulsion: 6 boilers, 2 screws, 1900 hp 15 knots.\n\n-Crew: 199\n\n-Armament: 6 x 127 mm, 4 x 76mm, 4 x 37mm\n\nIllustration of the Wilmington class\n\nAnnapolis class gunboats (1896)\n\nFour ships total: Annapolis, Vicksburg, Newport and Princeton, authorized 2.3.95, laid down as PG-10-13 in 1896, launched in December the same year and commissioned in 1897 (may 98 for Princeton).\n\nOriginally they were barquentine-rigged, with a clipper bow and long bowsprit, like composite-built vessels assimilated as sloops. 4 in guns (120 mm) were mounted fore and aft on the upper deck, reductions were later made, down to six 4-in guns in 1919.\n\nNewport was a training ship 1907-1931, Vicksburg was renamed Alexander hamilton by the coast guard.\n\nAnnapolis participated in the 1898 Spanish-American war, 15th conferred with a group of friendly Cubans and engaged in a brief gun duel with an enemy shore battery near the eastern end of the Baracoa, and later resumed duty at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nShe participated in the Battle of Nipe Bay, assisted landings at Puerto Rico, and later the Far Eastern fleet.

Interestingly enough, the second USS panay was involved in an incident, a Japanese attack while it was anchored in the Yangtze River outside Nanking, China on 12 December 1937. A famous movie with Steve McQueen was later inspired by this story.\n\nLinks\n\nThe Gunboats on wikipedia\n\nAbout USS Petrel on navsource\n\n-Conway’s all the world fighting ships 1860-1905 and 1906-1921."
