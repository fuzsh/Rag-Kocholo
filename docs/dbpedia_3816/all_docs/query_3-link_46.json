        "text": "The American Samoa Department of Health (ASDOH) is the applicant for this grant application. ASDOH proposes to utilize the FY 2023 988 State and Territory Improvement funding opportunity to develop and expand the American Samoa 988 crisis center and enhance the crisis response delivery system in the territory. The American Samoa 988 crisis center is an onboarding Lifeline crisis center which as such, cannot answer 988 calls originating from American Samoa making this the most significant gap in the delivery of 988 crisis response in the territory. Through this funding opportunity, ASDOH will be able to address gaps in services, build the workforce and operational capacity of the 988 crisis center, and improve crisis response services to ensure that individuals in American Samoa seeking assistance from 988 will get the service they need. This funding opportunity will help the territory to achieve official Lifeline crisis center status by addressing. The following project goals: 1. Increase the American Samoa 988 Crisis Response operational and workforce capacity to respond effectively to crisis and suicide calls received at the crisis center and helpline. 2. Increase coordination across the territory’s crisis response service system by developing a Territorial Crisis Response Plan and Protocol to be adopted by the 988 crisis center and primary crisis emergency first response services. 3. Reduce delays in delivering effective crisis response and involvement of 911 in crisis calls by establishing a Mobile Crisis Unit as an extension of the American Samoa 988 crisis center and helpline. 4. Increase and expand the territory’s phone coverage capacity to access the 988 number through phone, texts, and chats.\n\nThe applicant for this funding opportunity is the American Samoa Department of Health (ASDOH). ASDOH is the territory’s sole public health agency delivering programs and services that promote, protect, and address the public’s health and wellness. ASDOH also oversees the territory’s Community Health Centers (CHC) and was recently designated the Single State Authority (SSA) for substance abuse and mental health. Through this funding opportunity, ASDOH will focus on the following special populations: • Adults with a SMI • Adults who have co-occurring mental illness and physical health conditions or chronic disease • Children and adolescents with a SED who have a co-occurring physical health conditions or chronic disease; • Individuals with a SUD The integration of behavioral health care and primary care is currently not a standard of care across the territory’s healthcare delivery system. ASDOH proposes to utilize this funding opportunity to promote, develop and implement the integration of physical and behavioral health care in the American Samoa Community Health Centers and across the community. The project’s implementation plan will address the healthcare needs of the focus population through four (4) main goals: 1. Increase systematic and clinical capacity to implement evidence-based integration practices 2. Increase patient motivation and access to care through integrated screening, referral to care and follow-up practices 3. Decrease physical and behavioral health risks through preventative screening and health education 4. Enhance bi-directional care coordination and partnerships between ASDOH and community partners.\n\nAmerican Samoa is an unincorporated territory of the United States of America located about 2,500 miles south-southwest of Honolulu and 1,800 miles north-northeast of New Zealand, and is the only US jurisdiction that lies south of the equator. The most recent census data in American Samoa (2020) yielded a population of 49,710, where slightly more than 50% of the population are under the age of 19 and mostly males. From March 2020 to September 2021, American Samoa was impacted with a sudden increase in the number of deaths by suicide, especially amongst the youth population or individuals under the age of 20. In January 2021, the American Samoa Department of Human and Social Services (DHSS) received the 988 State Planning Grant from Vibrant for a one year period, to help prepare the territory for the 988 suicide and/or mental health crisis emergency number to go live in July 2022. To continue the efforts initiated by the 988 State Planning Grant, DHSS proposes to use SAMHSA's 988 Cooperative Agreements funding to improve and build the territory's capacity to respond to suicide/mental health crisis from its 988 crisis center. The American Samoa 988 Crisis Response Project will focus on three goals: (1) Expand the crisis response staff infrastructure, (2) Strengthen the intervention response and follow up system, and (3) Increase and expand the territory's phone coverage capacity. This project aims to target the entire population with focus on the younger individuals such as young adults, adolescents and children."
