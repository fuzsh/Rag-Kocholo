        "text": "Annals of German history record that, as the nineteenth century ended, Wilhelmine Germany's leadership practiced Weltpolitik.* Like empire and imperialism, Weltpolitik has always been a fuzzy concept.Footnote 1 In 1900, General Alfred von Waldersee, asked to pursue Weltpolitik, confessed he did not know what it meant.Footnote 2 Hermann vom Rath, less famous but influential in government circles, complained “few were clear” about what Weltpolitik entailed, and he was not among them.Footnote 3\n\nWhile academic historians still struggle to define, let alone agree upon, Weltpolitik's meaning, a consensus long ago emerged in regard to its basic themes.Footnote 4 Weltpolitik was about Germany demanding an equal place alongside leading imperial or world powers, especially Britain.Footnote 5 Securing an enlarged and improved fleet figured in this quest, as did overseas territorial expansion.Footnote 6 The effect of these drives was to threaten European stability and to worsen relations with other great powers. In the interim between 1897 and 1905, Germany became increasingly isolated, causing its leaders to fear “encirclement.”Footnote 7\n\nAs part of Weltpolitik, the German navy, emperor, and foreign secretary explored opportunities to establish a chain of naval bases across the globe. This chain would include an existing collection of German colonies, but would also touch new spots in areas deemed either strategically vital, or necessary for prestige, or helpful for domestic social integration and the popularity of a shaky government struggling to stem the advance of socialism and parliamentarization.Footnote 8 It was in this context that, between 1897 and 1900, Germany acquired a leasehold over Kiautschou Bay in China, along with the outright possession of the Carolines, the Northern Marianas, and some Samoan islands in the Pacific.\n\nWhile such a haul looked underwhelming—Max Weber deemed it “absurdly modest”—one must keep in mind that it remained incomplete.Footnote 9 Another significant, contemporaneous installment in the overseas acquisition spree was supposed to have come in or around Central and South America. German cultural engagement in the region had grown from the 1830s, amid waves of emigration from Germany to Brazil, Argentina, and neighboring destinations.Footnote 10 Local German trade had also boomed, especially following German unification in 1871.Footnote 11 By 1900, Germans had invested $476 million in Central and South America, where they functioned as a major regional importer and exporter.Footnote 12 An urge to guard and spotlight such connections marked Bernhard von Bülow's infamous “place in the sun” speech to the Reichstag in December 1897. The crescendo of Bülow's speech, often regarded as the debut of Weltpolitik, saw him attempt to justify Germany's pending acquisition of Kiautschou Bay.Footnote 13 Less remembered is how, in the same breath, Bülow alluded to an equivalent acquisition near the Americas. “We will strive in East Asia and in the West Indies,” Bülow declared, “consistent with the traditions of German politics, without unnecessary sharpness but also without weakness, to protect our rights and our interests.”Footnote 14\n\nIn early 1898, Walter Christmas Dirckinck von Holmfeld, formerly a captain in the Danish navy, arrived in Berlin to pitch the Caribbean island of St. John as a solution in the search for a German naval station in the West Indies. Holmfeld, despite his lodging in a modest apartment in the Tempelhof borough, carried references from high-ranking Danish statesmen and credibly proposed to broker a sale to Germany of St. John, then a colony in Denmark's possession. Although doubts surrounded his motives, he won audiences with German elites. Over the course of two years, his promotions captured the attention of Bülow, Kaiser Wilhelm II, Admiral Tirpitz, and the Hamburg-based shipping magnate Albert Ballin. Each of these men offered conditional support for Holmfeld's project, aware that Denmark wanted to reduce expenditures from a colonial empire perceived as a burdensome holdover from the early modern age.Footnote 15\n\nAt the time, St. John figured as the least substantial of three islands comprising the Danish Antilles, also known as the Danish Virgin Islands. Just twenty square miles in size, St. John had no roads. It was the home to roughly 925 people, of whom a handful were Europeans. Aside from some bay leaf oil used for rum production, St. John claimed scant economic activity and had seen its population plummet since the early nineteenth century.Footnote 16 To German leaders, the island's principal attraction was Coral Bay, a natural harbor with pristine water and fresh air. Coral Bay offered the German navy a spot at which to refuel reliably, even in the event of a war. The bay was large and deep enough to accommodate warships. It also lay on the path to the Panama Canal, whose eventual construction promised to transform global trade.\n\nFrom the perspective of contemporary US foreign policy, the Monroe Doctrine ruled out a formal German acquisition of St. John—or any other territory in the western hemisphere.Footnote 17 Yet, in 1898, many in Germany's government judged American statesmen too distracted to bother about the Danish Virgin Islands. With the Spanish-American War getting underway and amid what seemed like the imminent partition of China, the United States had to worry about the fate of Hawaii, Cuba, the Philippines, and the “open door.”Footnote 18 Besides, the Monroe Doctrine neither addressed the transfer of an existing European colony to another European power nor explicitly prohibited the transfer of a European colony to a private European business. Holmfeld, keen to rid Denmark of a perceived millstone, proposed to bring Germany St. John via one of the latter loopholes. In exchange, he asked a small personal fortune in the form of a 10 percent commission.\n\nHolmfeld offered to arrange for the sale of St. John to a German investment group rather than to the German state proper. Under his stewardship, private German investors could surreptitiously acquire every inch of property on the lush, but undeveloped, island. Land there was cheap, residing in the hands of a few owners Holmfeld claimed to know by virtue of his family's history as a local plantation owner. Crucially, too, Danish colonial law allowed foreign citizens to buy real estate. Impressed by these circumstances, high-ranking naval officials concluded that, once a German investment group had emerged as St. John's exclusive landowners, the group would be “a short step” from sovereignty.Footnote 19 Acting in a place where hardly any European observers lived, anyway, the German investment group could really focus on Coral Bay, where they would build a base and new fortifications around a decrepit, abandoned Danish fort. Thereafter, with German naval authority in place, Germany would stand as the uncontested sovereign power on St. John.\n\nWhen it came to the Caribbean, officials weighing Holmfeld's scheme saw cash and the power to rule as interchangeable. In this colonial setting as in others, Wilhelmine Germany thus showed little regard for European conceptual barriers dividing state sovereignty from different forms of territorial authority: dominium versus imperium; private versus public.Footnote 20 Such a posture was hardly unique in the life span of German overseas colonialism. On the contrary: this article will show how the Holmfeld affair conformed with a long-running German approach to colonial sovereignty that dated to Bismarck's inception of formal German colonialism in the 1880s.\n\nCuriously, a line of intellectual continuity between German colonial waves is absent from the major literature on Wilhelmine German foreign policy. The conservative historians Klaus Hildebrand and Andreas Hillgruber saw 1897 as a caesura after which a radical aggression and military development became defining features of Germany's diplomatic interaction with Europe.Footnote 21 Meanwhile, Wolfgang Mommsen and Christopher Clark, writing from very different perspectives, seized on the years around 1897 to cast Weltpolitik as overly provocative and miscalculated, in contrast to the more incremental, coherent, and Europe-focused foreign policy of Bismarck.Footnote 22\n\nResearchers working in the wake of these scholars can find plenty of corroborating evidence. A prominent contemporary observer, for example, stressed that Weltpolitik represented “new times, new goals, new ways.”Footnote 23 Nonetheless, some “ways” whereby Bülow and German leaders tried to achieve territorial expansion in the era of Weltpolitik—exchanging money for sovereign control in colonial settings and blurring private and public territoriality there—were actually borrowed from the Bismarckian era. Such a conclusion, at any rate, must follow from study of the Holmfeld affair, in which Wilhelmine Germany's leadership attempted to mobilize capital in its quest for overseas control, and to engage the business community in what one might call a coproduction of colonial statehood.Footnote 24 Years after Bismarck's exit from power, his attitudes about colonial sovereignty rhymed with and shaped a number of Wilhelmine Germany's fin-de-siècle expansionist moves, not just in the Caribbean but in China, Africa, and the Pacific.\n\nGerman statesmen functioning as interlocutors for the St. John plan were hardly original thinkers in relation to their national history. But neither were they unique in regard to the mode of territorial acquisition with which they flirted.Footnote 25 Indeed, when probing the limits of international law and trying to exchange cash for control, German schemes to acquire colonial territory in the early days of Weltpolitik did not differ in kind from those launched by other world powers. Instead, such schemes were the product of a highly imitative culture in which a lack of distinctiveness was itself an argument Wilhelmine leaders could make in their quest for a “place in the sun.” When one scrutinizes the manner whereby Germans tried to acquire titles to rule overseas, Weltpolitik could justify potential expansion around 1900 in terms, not just of money, might, and Bismarck, but of international legal precedents, equivalences, and methods familiar to peers whose recognition Germany coveted.\n\nIn his new book on empire, Erik Grimmer-Solem has powerfully reminded us how Weltpolitik interacted with Weltwirtschaft as a response to globalization and the challenges it presented. In a similar vein, I propose further incorporation of business history, transnational actors, and global comparisons into the study of formal German colonialism. It is necessary to revisit aspects of Weltpolitik that challenge conventional wisdom about German foreign policy's prewar peculiarity. Following Grimmer-Solem, who has focused on “fleet” economists and historians close to the government, we need to continue broadening our view of agency. This adjustment means analyzing, not only Wilhelm II, Bülow, Tirpitz, or even the professoriate, but also businessmen and hucksters who interacted with the Wilhelmine German state and its plans regarding territorial expansion, the navy, the economy, and diplomacy."
