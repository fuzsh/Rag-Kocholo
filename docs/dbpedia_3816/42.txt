AUCKLAND (N.Z.), ? April '

12.-The Alameda brings

news from Apia, April 5:

? On the arrival of the Tau-

ranga at Samoa the British

and American Consuls on

the advice of Captain Stuart

issued a further proclama-

tion with a view of giving

Mataafa a last chance; but

all efforts to prevent fur-

ther conflict,, although ably

seconded by tho French

priests, left Mataafa obdu-

rate. (; .

On March 29 the . British

and Americans engaged tho

rebels at Magiagi, and, arm-

ed with machine guns and

seven t : pounders, .???quickly

routed them. Their defeat

was made all the "more over-

whelming in that friendlies

pursued ;them som© dis-

tance, killing, several. The

total, killed and. wounded

on Mataal'a's side was said

to be 27, while the allies'

casualties: consisted of one

friendly "wounded.

One of Malietoa's ? men

brought a head into Mu

linu,, an act which quickly

brought a protest from Cap-

tain Stuart, of the Tauran-

ga, who got Malietoa to is-

sue a proclamation that the

barbarous custom would in

future be attended by hang-

The German Consul

(Rose) wrote asking if tho

civilised Powers approved

such practices; but the

American Admiral replied

that, while he agreed with

the German Consul as to

the inhumanity of the prac-

tice, he might be permitted

to point out that, had the

The Porpoise and Royalist, in an expedition

along shore, destroyed forty-six .of Mataafa's

boats' and several villages. The only sharp skir-

mish encountered was at Lulumoengo, where a"

jparty was somewhat unexpectedly fired .on, the

rebels having- taken up a position in. a native

missionary's house.. ; . .:,

Later, Captain Stuart, of the Tauranga, in con?

junction with the Americans, proceeded, with 10Q

friendly natives;- under Lieutenant Gaunt and ,the

British : Consul, Mr. Maxse, in armed cutters

.westward from Apia, . and destroyed various' Ma-

taafa villages encountered. At Malle, the strong-

hold of the Mataafa party; they were engaged,

ing ito Apia from an expedi-

tion along the coast. Pass-

ing .through a German co-

coanut plantation at Vállele,

the party walked right into

an ambush; which consisted

of, as is estimated, 800 men.

The friendlies, having ..Miltie

ed, but. the 'British and

to shoulder stubbornly., for'

half an hour. . .

Tho position would ' not

have been so bad had < it net

been 'that ithe. Cedit-automat-

ic quick-firer got jammed,

and was useless. .

Lieutenant Lansdale

while attempting to' put it

right, had his leg ehatitered

by a eliot. Eventually tho

.parity found it necessary to

rat!re before overwhelming

odds, which were proaaing

them. '

Several. assisted Lleutem

anit Lansdale, notably En-

sign Monaghan, his ship-

mate. These (two seem to

have got somewhat behind

in (tire retreat, but Mona-

ghan situck ito tota comradie

till a shot through the

. breast/killed Lansdale in-

stantly. Ensign Monaghan

had only moved a few steps

away when he too was shot

through the heart.

Lieultenonit ?Froeman, the

leader, was also killed,, and

also two American and two

Britten bluejackets. Fivo

were wounded, and a retreat

through a swamp was effect-

ed to the-shore.

Assistance was lent by the. Royalist .dropping

shells into the .plantation. Hunt, an A.B. of the

Porpoise, who has two ¡ medals for saving life,

was the last man to . leave the field, where the

allies had. for half an hour made. a .stubborn, re

iTlrtance. - During the fight ¡he was knocked sense-

less, either with a club or the butt of a rifle. His

right ear was cut off, and the rebels bad commen-

ced to cut.off the other, when a shell, from the

Royalist exploded near them, . * They

quickly dispersed, and Hunt,- whom th

unpleasant process of having his ears cut off hat

brought to, made for the beach, successfully et

fecting a marvellous escape. He is now in Auck

land Hospital.

Tamasese and a party of 300 friendliea visited th<

scene of the encounter the same night, ano

brought the bodies of the killed into Apia.

Those of the officers bad been decapitated and

mutilated, while the bluejackets had simply their

ears cut off.

An examination of the field showed that the

British and Americans bad been open to fire from

three sides, and that the natives, besides being

well placed in some cases, were up cocoanut

palms. .

There were pools of blood behind various trees,

which bore evidence of how shots had in .cases

passed right through the trunks, and found their

human -billet crouched on the other side.

The French priests obtained the heads of the

officers, when it was found that the ears of

lieutenant Freeman had been cut off.

The coffins were disinterred, and after the

heads had been put on reburied at Mulinuu.: v.-'-.-.

On Mataafa's side it is computed that forty were

killed and thirty wounded. The retreat would

appear to have been well effected," and . the loss

of three officers out of six is matter of surprise.

It is said that the three surviving officers of the.

. party-Lieutenant Geo. E. Cave, of the Porpoise;

Lieutenant Henry P. V. Hickman, of.the Royalist,

and Mr. Perkins, of the Philadelphia-behaved

splendidly.

The manager of the German plantation is now

imprisoned on the Tauranga, an affidavit having

been sworn to by four men and one officer that he

.was seen urging on the rebel*.

of. Apia; but on April 4 there was firing quite

close to the town.

More friendlies are to be obtained from Tutuila,

and were arms available a forceof 2000 could be

organised.' Another warship is needed at the

islands, also ammunition.

England and America will have to ; force sub-

mission along the lines which have been begun.

It is said that Mataafa on three occasions would

have given, in but. for the-influence of the Ger-

mans, and that he has averred that he is now

determined to light to the bitter end.

Malietoa has been formally crowned King.

ment of a village adjacent to Apia was proceed-

The two seamen of the Tauranga who were.kill-

ed were John Long and Albert Prout; both "lead

able seaman, and John Foxwordy, corporal of ina-,

rines. The latter are both reported to be progres-

sing favorably.
