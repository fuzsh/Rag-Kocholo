        "text": "Sir Charles Fitzpatrick GCMGPC (December 19, 1851 â June 17, 1942) was a Canadian lawyer and politician, who served as the fifth Chief Justice of Canada. He was born in Quebec City, Canada East, to John Fitzpatrick and Mary Connolly.\n\nHe studied at Laval University, earning his B.A. degree (1873) and LL.B degree (1876), earning the Dufferin Silver Medal.[1] Called to the bar of Quebec in 1876, he established his practice in Quebec City and later founded the law firm of Fitzpatrick & Taschereau.\n\nIn 1885, he acted as chief counsel to Louis Riel who was on trial for leading the North-West Rebellion. Riel was found guilty and sentenced to death.\n\nFitzpatrick entered politics in 1890, winning election to the Quebec Legislative Assembly in QuÃ©bec-ComtÃ© electoral district. He was re-elected in 1892, but resigned in June 1896 to enter federal politics.\n\nHe was first elected to the Canadian House of Commons in Quebec County electoral district in the 1896 federal election as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP). He served as Solicitor General of Canada from 1896 to 1902, and as Minister of Justice from 1902 until 1906.\n\nHe was appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada as Chief Justice. He served in that position until 1918 when he was appointed the 12th Lieutenant Governor of Quebec. During his period as Lieutenant Governor, his nephew acted as Premier of Quebec, Louis-Alexandre Taschereau.\n\nHe is the only Chief Justice other than Sir William Buell Richards to have served in that position without having first been a Puisne Justice on the court (Richards was Chief Justice at the court's creation in 1875), and the only Chief Justice to have been appointed without any prior judicial experience.\n\nIn 1905, he took part, as the federal government representative, in the negotiations that led to the creation of the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. He was knighted in 1907.\n\nMay 20, 1879, Fitzpatrick married Marie-Elmire-Corinne Caron, daughter of RenÃ©-Ãdouard Caron, 2nd Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, and his wife Marie-JosÃ©phine De Blois.\n\nChief Justice Fitzpatrick died on June 17, 1942, aged 88 years and 6 months; he is interred in Sillery, Quebec.\n\nSupreme Court of Canada Biography\n\n\"Biography\".
