This period was charged with interesting and important events and the story of them is well worth preserving. The task of telling this story has been undertaken by Hon. Mr. Macdonald. Among the vitally absorbing, events happening were: the change of government after eighteen years in 1896, the inauguration of the British Preference, the first participation in South Africa of Canada in Britain's wars, the Railway construction era; the creation of the Provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta, the matter of naval assistance to the Empire, the Reciprocity measure of 1911, the change of government and Sir Robert Borden's advent to power, the Nationalist movement in Quebec, the defeat of the Naval Bill, the World War, the stirring session of 1917 with Conscription, Railway Legislation, the Wartime election act and Union Government, the death of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, the retirement of Sir Robert Borden, the defeat of Union Government in 1921 and Mackenzie King as Liberal leader and Premier, the United Church Bill, the elections of 1925 and the subsequent sessions of 1925 and 1926 when the King Government and the Meighan Government were both defeated in Parliament, and the elections of 1926.\n\nMr Macdonald served in the Legislature of Nova Scotia and in Parliament.
