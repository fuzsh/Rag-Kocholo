        "text": "Alexander II (born, Baggio, near Milan [Italy]—died April 21, 1073, Rome) was the pope from 1061 to 1073.\n\nAt Bec in Normandy he studied under the Benedictine scholar Lanfranc, who later became archbishop of Canterbury. As bishop of Lucca, Anselm worked for the abolition of simony and the enforcement of clerical celibacy. His election as Pope Alexander II was opposed by the German court, which nominated Peter Cadalus of Parma as Honorius II. In 1062 the antipope was dropped by the German regents, and the schism ceased to be important. In cooperation with Hildebrand (later Pope Gregory VII) and St. Peter Damian, Alexander promoted the Gregorian Reform movement begun by Pope Leo IX in 1049. He also bestowed his blessing on William the Conqueror’s invasion of England in 1066."
