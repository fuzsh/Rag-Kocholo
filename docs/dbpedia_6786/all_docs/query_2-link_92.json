William the Conqueror vowed to build an abbey where the Battle of Hastings had taken place, with the high altar of its church on the supposed spot where King Harold fell in that battle. William started building it, but died before it was completed. Early legal documents of adjoining property refer to a hospital or guesthouse which was attached to the gate of the abbey. Its church was finished in about 1094 and consecrated during the reign of his son William known as Rufus. Cassell's Illustrated History of England, 1865 (cropped and cleaned).",
