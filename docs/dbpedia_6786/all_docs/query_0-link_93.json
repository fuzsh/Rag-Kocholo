        "text": "John XII came to the throne in 955, when he was just 18. Shortly thereafter, he turned his residence into a brothel, gambled with church offerings, and was even accused of castrating a cardinal.\n\nGerman ruler Otto of Saxony once wrote to the young pope, saying, “Everyone [...] accuses you, Holiness, of homicide, perjury, sacrilege, incest with your relatives, including two of your sisters, and with having, like a pagan, invoked Jupiter, Venus, and other demons.”\n\nJohn XII actually met his demise because of a tryst: A jealous husband discovered his wife in bed with the pope, and the man proceeded to severely beat the him. John XII died three days later.\n\nSource: Royal Scandals\n\nBenedict IX was \"placed\" into the papacy in 1032, when he was likely just 12 years old. Not much is known about his policies, but it's clear that he wasn't well liked. (Historian Ferdinand Gregorovius called him \"a demon from hell.\")\n\nSoon, political opponents tried to murder him, so he fled St. Peter's Basilica and spent time in Rome, where he \"stole, murdered and committed other, unspeakable deeds,\" according to one account.\n\nBut he came back for more: In 1045, Benedict IX deposed his replacement and became pope again. His second round of popedom lasted just two months, though. He was reportedly offered a large sum of money and, in essence, sold the papacy to his successor.\n\nBenedict IX actually became pope a third time, seizing the throne after Pope Clement II died in 1047. Eight months later he was driven out by King Henry III of England — and he never returned.\n\nSource: INSIDER\n\nSuffice it to say that Boniface VIII wasn't exactly beloved. After his election in 1294, he erected statues of himself all over Rome and said that sleeping with boys was no more problematic than \"rubbing one hand against the other.\"\n\nHis most flagrant offense? The entire city of Palestrina was destroyed on his orders — all because of a personal political feud.\n\nAn envoy from the King of Aragon once summed up this pope's unpopularity, writing that \"the cardinals all desire his death and are weary of his devilries.\"\n\nFun fact: Boniface VIII makes an appearance in the eighth circle of hell in Dante's \"Inferno.\"\n\nSource: Royal Scandals; The Smart Set\n\nSixtus IV, elected in 1471, apparently had six illegitimate children, including one with his sister. That didn't stop him from policing the sexual appetites of his underlings, though. He created a church tax on prostitutes and charged priests for having mistresses.\n\nSixtus IV also had a taste for nepotism, as did many other popes: He made six of his nephews cardinals.\n\nOn the bright side, he did commission the Sistine Chapel.\n\nSources: The Smart Set; Saints and Sinners: A History of the Popes\n\nInnocent VII, who became pope in 1484, was the first pontiff to openly acknowledge eight illegitimate children, though he may have had more. (Before his admission, papal bastards were simply referred to as \"nephews.\" Wink wink.)\n\nHe was also very concerned about witchcraft, and in a 1484 document he wrote that he encouraged and blessed the act of witch hunting.\n\nSources: Royal Scandals; The Smart Set; Saints and Sinners: A History of the Popes; Fordham University\n\nAlexander VI became pope in 1492 — but before then he was just Rodrigo Borgia, a member of the notorious Italian crime family the Borgias. And in true crime-family fashion, he used money to buy his way into the papacy.\n\nHe also had several mistresses and fathered at least nine illegitimate children — possibly as a result of hosting orgies.\n\nDuring his pre-papacy stint as a church cardinal, Alexander VI received a letter from Pope Pius II condemning him for hosting \"several ladies of Sienna\" late at night. \"We have heard that the most licentious dances were indulged in,\" Pius II wrote. \"Shame forbids mention of all that took place [...] All Sienna is talking about this orgy.\"\n\nAnother source says he hosted an orgy in 1501 called the \"Joust of Whores.\"\n\nSource: Royal Scandals; The Smart Set; Saints and Sinners: A History of the Popes\n\nHistorian Eamon Duffy describes Julius II, elected in 1503, as \"the most ferocious pope of the period — imperious, hot-tempered, manically active.\" That's because he used to dress up in silver suit of armor and lead troops up and down Italy, engaging in battles to extend the reach of the church's territory.\n\nBut Julius II had also contracted syphilis, apparently via prostitutes, and on Good Friday in 1508 his feet were so covered by sores that the faithful could not kiss them.\n\nSources: The Smart Set; Saints and Sinners: A History of the Popes"
