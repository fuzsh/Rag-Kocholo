As we are called to embrace this synodal path of the Synod 2021-2023, this prayer invites the Holy Spirit to operate within us so that we may be a community and a people of grace. For the Synod 2021-2023, we propose to use this simplified version, so that any group or liturgical assembly can pray more easily.\n\nWe stand before You, Holy Spirit,\n\nas we gather together in Your name.\n\nWith You alone to guide us,\n\nmake Yourself at home in our hearts;\n\nTeach us the way we must go\n\nand how we are to pursue it.\n\nWe are weak and sinful;\n\ndo not let us promote disorder.\n\nDo not let ignorance lead us down the wrong path\n\nnor partiality influence our actions.\n\nLet us find in You our unity\n\nso that we may journey together to eternal life\n\nand not stray from the way of truth\n\nand what is right.\n\nAll this we ask of You,\n\nwho are at work in every place and time,\n\nin the communion of the Father and the Son,\n\nforever and ever.\n\nBack to top\n\nThe Holy Rosary\n\nStart by making the sign of the Cross:\n\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\n\nAmen.\n\nThen recite the Creed:\n\nI believe in God, the Father almighty,\n\nCreator of heaven and earth,\n\nand in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord.\n\nHe was conceived by the Holy Spirit,\n\nand born of the Virgin Mary.\n\nHe suffered under Pontius Pilate,\n\nwas crucified, died and was buried.\n\nHe descended into hell.\n\nOn the third day He rose again.\n\nHe ascended into heaven,\n\nand is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.\n\nHe will come again to judge the living and the dead.\n\nI believe in the Holy Spirit,\n\nthe Holy Catholic Church,\n\nthe communion of saints,\n\nthe forgiveness of sins,\n\nthe resurrection of the body,\n\nand life everlasting.\n\nThen say 1 \"Our Father\", 3 \"Hail Mary's\" for the virtues of Faith, Hope and Charity; and then 1 \"Glory Be\":\n\nOur Father, Who art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come, Thy Will be done, On earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n\nHail Mary, Full of Grace, The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of death.\n\nGlory Be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end.\n\nThe Rosary is divided into three parts, each having five mysteries. While meditating on the Mysteries, recite for each Mystery:\n\n1 \"Our Father\"\n\n10 \"Hail Mary's\" and\n\n1 \"Glory Be\"\n\nAfter each Mystery the \"Fatima Prayer\" is said.\n\nO my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fire of hell, lead all souls to heaven, especially those who are in most need of Thy mercy.\n\nAll together this makes up one decade.\n\nAfter the completion of the five mysteries (five decades), the \"Hail Holy Queen\" is said:\n\nHail, holy Queen, mother of mercy, our life, our sweetness, and our hope. To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve. To thee do we send up our sighs mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Turn then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us, and after this our exile show us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.\n\nPray for us, O Holy Mother of God.\n\nThat we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.\n\nIn the Name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\n\nBack to Top\n\nThe Magnificat\n\nMy soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,\n\nmy spirit rejoices in God my Savior\n\nfor he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.\n\nFrom this day all generations will call me blessed:\n\nthe Almighty has done great things for me,\n\nand holy is his Name.\n\nHe has mercy on those who fear him\n\nin every generation.\n\nHe has shown the strength of his arm,\n\nhe has scattered the proud in their conceit.\n\nHe has cast down the mighty from their thrones,\n\nand has lifted up the lowly.\n\nHe has filled the hungry with good things,\n\nand the rich he has sent away empty.\n\nHe has come to the help of his servant Israel\n\nfor he remembered his promise of mercy,\n\nthe promise he made to our fathers,\n\nto Abraham and his children forever.\n\nBack to Top\n\nThe Angelus\n\nThe Angel of the Lord declared to Mary:\n\nAnd she conceived of the Holy Spirit.\n\nHail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not my petitions, but in thy mercy hear and answer me.\n\nBack to Top\n\nSalve Regina (Hail, Holy Queen)\n\nHail, holy Queen, mother of Mercy.\n\nHail, our life, our sweetness and our hope.\n\nTo thee do we cry,\n\npoor banished children of Eve;\n\nto thee do we send up our sighs,\n\nmourning and weeping,\n\nin this vale of tears.\n\nTurn then, most gracious advocate,\n\nthine eyes of mercy toward us;\n\nand after this our exile, show unto us\n\nthe blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\n\nO clement, O loving,\n\nO sweet virgin Mary.\n\nBack to Top\n\nChaplet of Divine Mercy\n\nMake the Sign of the Cross\n\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\n\nOptional Opening Prayers\n\nYou expired, Jesus, but the source of life gushed forth for souls, and the ocean of mercy opened up for the whole world.

Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n\nHail Mary\n\nHail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, Amen.\n\nThe Apostle's Creed\n\nI believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, Our Lord, Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified; died, and was buried. He descended into Hell; the third day He arose again from the dead; He ascended into Heaven, sitteth at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.\n\nThe Eternal Father\n\nEternal Father, I offer you the Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity of Your Dearly Beloved Son, Our Lord, Jesus Christ, in atonement for our sins and those of the whole world.\n\nOn the Ten Small Beads of Each Decade\n\nFor the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world.\n\nRepeat for the remaining decades\n\nSaying the \"Eternal Father\" (6) on the \"Our Father\" bead and then 10 \"For the sake of His sorrowful Passion\" (7) on the following \"Hail Mary\" beads.\n\nConclude with Holy God (Repeat three times)\n\nHoly God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us and on the whole world.\n\nOptional Closing Prayer\n\nEternal God, in whom mercy is endless and the treasury of compassion--inexhaustible, look kindly upon us and increase Your mercy in us, that in difficult moments we might not despair nor become despondent, but with great confidence submit ourselves to Your holy will, which is Love and Mercy itself.\n\nBack to Top\n\nLitany of Mary\n\nLord, have mercy.\n\nChrist, have mercy.\n\nLord, have mercy.\n\nGod our Father ln Heaven, have mercy on us.\n\nGod the Son, Redeemer of the world, have mercy on us.\n\nGod the Holy Spirit, have mercy on us.\n\nHoly Trinity, one God, have mercy on us.\n\nHoly Mary, pray for us.\n\nHoly Mother of God, pray for us.\n\nMost honored of virgins, pray for us.\n\nMother of Christ, pray for us.\n\nMother of the Church, pray for us.\n\nMother of divine grace, pray for us.\n\nMother most pure, pray for us.\n\nMother of chaste love, pray for us.\n\nMother and virgin, pray for us.\n\nSinless Mother, pray for us.\n\nDearest of Mothers, pray for us.\n\nModel of motherhood, pray for us.\n\nMother of good counsel, pray for us.\n\nMother of our Creator, pray for us.\n\nMother of our Savior, pray for us.\n\nVirgin most wise, pray for us.\n\nVirgin rightly praised, pray for us.\n\nVirgin rightly renowned, pray for us.\n\nVirgin most powerful, pray for us.\n\nVirgin gentle in mercy, pray for us.\n\nFaithful Virgin, pray for us.\n\nMirror of justice, pray for us.\n\nThrone of wisdom, pray for us.\n\nCause of our joy, pray for us.\n\nShrine of the Spirit, pray for us.\n\nGlory of Israel, pray for us.\n\nVessel of selfless devotion, pray for us.\n\nMystical Rose, pray for us.\n\nTower of David, pray for us.\n\nTower of ivory, pray for us.\n\nHouse of gold, pray for us.\n\nArk of the covenant, pray for us.\n\nGate of heaven, pray for us.\n\nMorning star, pray for us.\n\nHealth of the sick, pray for us.\n\nRefuge of sinners, pray for us.\n\nComfort of the troubled, pray for us.\n\nHelp of Christians, pray for us.\n\nQueen of angels, pray for us.\n\nQueen of patriarchs and prophets, pray for us.\n\nQueen of apostles and martyrs, pray for us.\n\nQueen of confessors and virgins, pray for us.\n\nQueen of all saints, pray for us.\n\nQueen conceived without sin, pray for us.\n\nQueen assumed in to heaven, pray for us.\n\nQueen of the rosary, pray for us.\n\nQueen of families, pray for us.\n\nQueen of peace, pray for us.\n\nBlessed be the name of the Virgin Mary now and forever.\n\nBack to Top\n\nHail, Joseph\n\nHail, Joseph, image of the Eternal Father;\n\nHail, Joseph, guardian of the Eternal Son;\n\nHail, Joseph, temple of the Eternal Spirit;\n\nHail, Joseph, beloved of the Trinity.\n\nHail, Joseph, spouse and companion of the Mother of God.\n\nHail, Joseph, friend of angels.\n\nHail, Joseph, believer in miracles.\n\nHail, Joseph, follower of dreams.\n\nHail, Joseph, lover of simplicity.\n\nHail, Joseph, exemplar of righteousness;\n\nHail, Joseph, model of meekness and patience;\n\nHail, Joseph, model of humility and obedience.\n\nBlessed are the eyes that have seen what you saw.\n\nBlessed are the ears that have heard what you heard.\n\nBlessed are the arms that have embraced what you embraced.\n\nBlessed is the lap that has held what you held.\n\nBlessed is the heart that has loved what you loved.\n\nBlessed is the Father who chose you;\n\nBlessed is the Son who loved you:\n\nBlessed is the Spirit who sanctified you.\n\nBlessed is Mary, your spouse, who honored and loved you.\n\nBlessed is the angel who guarded and led you.\n\nAnd blessed be forever all who remember and honor you.\n\n- Father Jean-Jacques Olier\n\nBack to Top\n\nAct of Faith\n\nO my God, I firmly believe that Thou art one God, in three Divine Persons, the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost; I believe that Thy Divine Son became man and died for our sins and that He will come to judge the living and the dead.
