He is particularly well known for his vision as regards urban and architectural projects in Rome.\n\nFabio Chigi, as he was known prior to his papacy, started out serving in various diplomatic positions as a representative of the Holy See. He subsequently became a priest and then bishop of Nardo, and later bishop of Imola.\n\nUnder Pope Innocent X, Chigi was first appointed secretary of state and then made a cardinal. This positioned him to be elected pope after a discussion of eighty days, with Chigi taking the name of Alexander VII.\n\nWhile he was initially elected as a response to the rampant nepotism which had plagued prior papacies, soon enough the papacy of Alexander VII ended up in much same boat as had those prior.\n\nBorn: February 13, 1599\n\nBirthplace: Siena, Florence, Italy\n\nStar Sign: Aquarius"
