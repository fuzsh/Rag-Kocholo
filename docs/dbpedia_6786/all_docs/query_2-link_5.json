Under his rule, he gave blessing to William the Conqueror for his conquest of the Kingdom of England.\n\nBiography[]\n\nAnselmo da Baggio was born in 1019 to a noble family in the County of Milan, and he became Bishop of Lucca. In 1061 he was elected as pope, but the Holy Roman Empire did not agree, and they installed Antipope Honorius II in Basel. However, Honorius was deposed by Mantua, allowing for Alexander to have unchallenged rule. In 1065, he told Landulf VI of Benevento that conversion of Jews was not to be obtained by force, and he also called for a crusade against the Moors."
