        "text": "Alexander the Great and his legacy suffuse The Prince, a fact that has received little attention. Machiavelli uses Alexander to illustrate the form of rule in which one is lord and all others are slaves. In recounting the Roman Republic's conquest of Greece, Machiavelli treats Alexander's vanquished successors. Alexander's legacy enters Rome itself, igniting in Romans the desire to subject the world to sole preeminence. According to Machiavelli, Caesar imitated Alexander, and Caesar overturned the republic, initiating the rule of one in Rome. Caesar had his own Roman successors, the emperors who ruled under his name. Rome succeeded in imposing the rule of one on Europe. That form of rule exists in Machiavelli's times with the states of the Turk and the Sultan as well as with the papacy in a limited respect. Something of the old Rome and its Alexandrian aspirations persists in Christian Rome.\n\n9 According to Plutarch, Alexander “believed that he came as a heaven-sent governor to all, and as a mediator for the whole world, those whom he could not persuade to unite with him, he conquered by force of arms, and he brought together into one body all men everywhere, uniting and mixing in one great loving-cup, as it were, men's lives, their characters, their marriages, their very habits of life. He bade them all consider as their fatherland the whole inhabited earth, as their stronghold and protection his camp, as akin to them all good men, and as foreigners only the wicked” (On the Fortune or the Virtue of Alexander 329 C 6; quoted from Moralia, trans. Babbitt, Frank Cole [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1962Google Scholar], 4:399).\n\n10 Plutarch relates the suspicion that Alexander was the son of the god Ammon. This suspicion of a divine birth was confirmed when the high priest of the temple of Ammon in Siwa, Egypt, apparently “bade Alexander welcome from his father Ammon.” Plutarch emphasizes the extent to which Alexander asserted his supremacy by nurturing his claim to be a god, noting that to “the barbarians” Alexander “carried himself very haughtily, as if he were persuaded of his divine birth and parentage” (Plutarch, Life of Alexander, in The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans, trans. Dryden, John, ed. Clough, Arthur Hugh [New York: Modern Library]Google Scholar, 2:161; see also 140, 166, and 191).\n\n35 Livy 25.23: “the Romans just then were angling for the friendship of the Aetolians” (quoted from The War with Hannibal: Books XXI–XXX of The History of Rome from Its Foundation, trans. de Sélincourt, Aubrey [New York: Penguin Books, 1986]Google Scholar, 327). The Roman envoy to the Aetolians tells them that “the Romans had inherited from their forebears the tradition of treating their allies with consideration,” and adds that the Aetolians “would be held in the greater honour in that they would be the first overseas people to have made ties of friendship with Rome” (Livy 26.24; War with Hannibal, 386).\n\n38 See Plutarch's comments on the danger Rome faced in this situation had not Titus acted the way he did: “Had not, therefore, Titus upon a principle of prudence and foresight, lent an ear to peace, and had Antiochus found the Romans still at war in Greece with Philip, and had these two, the most powerful and warlike princes of that age, confederated for their common interests against the Roman state, Rome might once more have run no less a risk, and been reduced to no less extremities, than she had experienced under Hannibal. But now, Titus opportunely introducing this peace between the wars, dispatching the present danger before the new one had arrived, at once disappointed Antiochus of his first hopes and Philip of his last” (Life of Flamininus, 1:506).\n\n47 Plutarch would seem to be one of those, to whom Machiavelli here refers, who maintain that Caesar imitated Alexander. In fact, Plutarch writes an account of Caesar's life, which he couples with his account of Alexander's. Plutarch's Life of Alexander displays Alexander's desire “for the empire of the world” and the degree to which he accomplished his ambition (Lives, 2:161). In recounting Caesar's life, he refers to Caesar's reading of history that ignites the envy that fuels his future emulation of Alexander. Specifically, Plutarch recounts that once while the young Caesar was serving as a soldier in Spain, “after reading some part of the history of Alexander, he sat a great while very thoughtful, and at last burst out into tears.” When his surprised friends asked him the reason for his tears, the distraught Caesar replied: “‘Do you think,’ said he, ‘I have not just cause to weep, when I consider that Alexander at my age had conquered so many nations, and I have all this time done nothing that is memorable’” (Life of Caesar, in Lives, 2:206). In the Life of Antony, Plutarch says of Caesar that “the true motive that led him was the same that formerly led Alexander and Cyrus against all mankind, the unquenchable thirst of empire, and the distracted ambition of being the greatest man in the world” (Lives, 2:485). In his commentary on this chapter of The Prince, de Alvarez focuses on the connection between Cyrus and Alexander, but neglects the important one the chapter establishes between Alexander and Caesar (Machiavellian Enterprise, 67).\n\n55 Some of the Greek satraps organized a rebellion against Darius's rule, encouraging other Greek cities to depose the tyrants whom Darius had imposed on them (Herodotus 5.35–38). One of their leaders approached the leading free states of Greece in order to gain support for their attack on Persia. The people of Athens, who had recently rid themselves of their own family of tyrants, the Pisistratidae, were so receptive to the envoy's pleas that Athens come to the aid of the Ionian cities and thereby gain Persian riches that a combined force of Athenians and Ionians captured a capital city of Darius's empire, Sardis, and burned it (Herodotus 5.97 and 101). This brought in reprisal the Persian invasion of Greece and attempted attack on Athens, an attempt that failed with the Athenian victory at Marathon."
