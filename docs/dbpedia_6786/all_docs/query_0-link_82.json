        "text": "Pope Francis is a Pope of firsts: first Francis and first Pope from Latin America. He's also the first pope in 600 years to take office after one who has resigned: Pope Benedict XVI shocked the Catholic world when he resigned.\n\nBut which Pope has held the longest term of office and what is the average age at the start of papacy? How many sovereign pontiffs are originally from Italy?\n\nThe last time a pope resigned was in 1415 - when Gregory XII ended the Great Western Schism by handing in his tiara.\n\nWhat can we learn from this data? Of the 266 Popes listed below, 88 came from Rome and the majority (196) came from Italy. Gregory V (3 May 996 - 18 February 999) was the first German Pope before Benedict XVI. And Sylvester II who succeeded him in 999 was French. Adrian IV (4 December 1154 - 1 September 1159) from Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire, was the first and only English Pope. Francis is the first and only Argentinian Pope.\n\nPius IX (1846-1878) held the pontificate for 31 years, 7 months and 23 days. John Paul II comes right after with 26 years, 5 months and 18 days in power. At the bottom of the ranking comes Urban VII (15-27 September 1590) who reigned for only 13 days and died before coronation. John Paul I (26 August – 28 September 1978) only reigned for 33 calendar days.\n\nPope-elect Stephen II (23 March 752 - 25 March 752) never held his Pontificate. He died three days after his election and was never consecrated into the office of Pope as such. Some lists still include his name. The Vatican sanctioned his addition to the list of popes in the sixteenth century, however he was removed in 1961. He is no longer considered a pope by the Catholic Church.\n\nClement X (29 April 1670 - 22 July 1676) is the oldest elected Pope. He started his Pontificate at the age of 79. Benedict XVI has been elected at the age of 78. He is the 7th oldest Pope at the time of election. Another Clement named Pope Clement XI (23 November 1700 - 19 March 1721) is the youngest of the list. He has been elected at the age of 51.\n\nLeo XIII (1878) reached the Canonic age of 93 years old when he died He is the oldest in the whole history of Papacy. The average age at the time of election is 65. 78 is the most common age to die, the average for holding power is 2,451 days - or 7 years.\n\nWhat can you do with the data?\n\nData summary\n\nDownload the data\n\n• DATA: download the full spreadsheet\n\nNEW!
