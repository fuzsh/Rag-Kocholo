        "text": "Funerary Monument to Pope Callixtus III & Pope Alexander VI\n\nOn August 11th 1492, Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia was elected pope, taking the name Alexander VI. He would become one of the most infamous popes in the history of the papacy!\n\nPope Alexander VI (r. 1492-1503) was the nephew of a former pontiff, namely Callixtus III (r. 1455-58). Both popes are interred in the church of Santa Maria in Monserrato degli Spagnoli.\n\nThe funerary monument (first chapel on the right), which wasn't erected until 1889, is the work of the Spanish sculptor Felipe Moratilla Parreto (1827-1908).\n\nSee also: The Borgia Apartment.\n\nMy name is David Lown and I am an art historian from Cambridge, England. Since 2001 I have lived in Italy, where I run private walking tours of Rome."
