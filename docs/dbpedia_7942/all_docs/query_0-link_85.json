        "text": "|<\n\n< Prev\n\nNext >\n\n>|\n\nSupergroup\n\nTitle text: I love their cover of 1,200 Balloons, Dalmatians, and Miles.\n\nExplanation[edit]\n\nIn popular music, a supergroup is a musical group formed by collaboration of existing solo artists and members of other musical groups.\n\nThis comic shows a marquee announcing a concert by a supergroup formed from members of 10 musical groups whose names all begin with a number. The name of the supergroup is the sum of all those numbers, 176, followed by the names of the original groups without their numbers. It's reasonable to estimate that there could be up to 32 members of the supergroup (see below).\n\nMusical groups mentioned in the comic:\n\nTwenty One Pilots\n\n5 Seconds of Summer\n\n4 Non Blondes\n\n2 Live Crew\n\n100 gecs\n\n3 Doors Down\n\nNine Inch Nails\n\nOneRepublic\n\nOne Direction\n\nThirty Seconds to Mars\n\nSum: 21 + 5 + 4 + 2 + 100 + 3 + 9 + 1 + 1 + 30 = 176\n\nIt should be noted that this summation, taken literally, is mathematically wrong, as it not only adds numbers with different units and dimensionality (eg, pilots are not the same dimensionality as seconds), but one of the summands (3 in 3 Doors Down) is an ordinal number and another (9 in Nine Inch Nails) is part of an adjective phrase, which is analogous to saying that four metres and one metre cubed add up to seven metres.\n\nThe title text indicates that this supergroup performs a medley or mashup of songs whose titles begin with numbers. The title of this \"supersong\" is similarly formed by adding the numbers and following with the rest of all the titles. Notably, none of the referenced songs were written by any of the referenced artists.\n\nSongs mentioned in the title text:\n\n99 Luftballons (by Nena). 99 Red Balloons is the title of the English-language adaptation of the song.\n\nOne Hundred and One Dalmatians (Disney film soundtrack). The titular song by the Sherman Brothers is not featured in the film, but was released in separate Disney recordings.\n\nA Thousand Miles (by Vanessa Carlton). Other songs titled \"1000 Miles\" or \"Thousand Miles\" also exist.\n\nSum: 99 + 101 + 1000 = 1200\n\n\"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\" by the Proclaimers is about walking \"500 miles, and [...] 500 more\", therefore a thousand miles in total. There are two more songs titled (or known as) \"500 Miles\", by Hedy West and Tori Amos, which could be added up to replace \"A Thousand Miles\" (or \"1000 Miles\") in the tally as well.\n\nThe supergroup could have 32 members:\n\nTwenty One Pilots: This band has 2 members, Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun.\n\n5 Seconds of Summer: There are 4 members in this band, including Luke Hemmings, Michael Clifford, Calum Hood, and Ashton Irwin.\n\n4 Non Blondes: Originally, this group had 4 members, but it disbanded in 1994. The lead singer was Linda Perry.\n\n2 Live Crew: This group's core lineup included 2 to 4 members over different periods, with notable members being Luther Campbell, Brother Marquis, Fresh Kid Ice, and Mr. Mixx.\n\n100 gecs: This band consists of 2 members, Laura Les and Dylan Brady.\n\n3 Doors Down: This band typically has 5 members, although the number has varied with lineup changes over the years.\n\nNine Inch Nails: Officially, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are the only constant members of Nine Inch Nails, with a changing lineup of touring members and collaborators.\n\nOneRepublic: This band has 5 members, including Ryan Tedder, Zach Filkins, Drew Brown, Brent Kutzle, and Eddie Fisher.\n\nOne Direction: Originally, there were 5 members in this band, but after Zayn Malik's departure in 2015, it continued with 4 members until their hiatus.\n\nThirty Seconds to Mars: This band has had various lineups but is centered around Jared Leto and Shannon Leto, with other members joining and leaving at different times.\n\nSum: 2 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 2 = 32\n\nThese counts mostly reflect the bands' most well-known lineups and may vary with time due to changes in membership or the band's status. Combined groups may feature fewer than the sum of their original memberships, even down to just single musicians/vocalists coming from any or all of their prior collaborations. On the other hand, especially for worthy causes, it is possible that groups with many changing lineups could perhaps rustle up far more members than they ever had at a given time, never mind any prominent artists who may guest-star in their own right. It is unclear whether the band names would be pro rated in these circumstances (for example, if only one of 100 gecs joined the supergroup, would they only count for 50?).\n\nPotential connection to mathematical supergroups[edit]\n\nRandall may be making a subtle reference to mathematical physics, in which a supergroup is a generalization of a group based on the concept of supersymmetry.\n\nReaders with a background in mathematics or physics might find their expectations thwarted upon realizing that the comic is about mundane musical collaborations. But then, \"every supergroup carries a natural group structure, but there may be more than one way to structure a given group as a supergroup\"[1], which applies to both contexts.\n\nMiscellaneous numeric observations[edit]\n\n100 gecs provides the most \"bandname per member\" (100 / 2 = 50), with OneRepublic and One Direction each vying for most \"members per bandname\" (both 5, at their most complete). Counting the songname mashup ratios is more complex: if it is not a single \"1000 miles\", perhaps the two Proclaimers can be said to be each singing 500 miles, to match the other solo artists' alternate 500s (depending upon which source(s) are chosen as canon), but a single luftballon requires just slightly over 1% of Nena (whether the eponymous singer or shared throughout her band of five) and a lone Dalmatian slightly less than 1% split amongst an uncertain number of originators.\n\nReferences[edit]\n\nTranscript[edit]\n\n[Ponytail, Cueball, Megan, Knit Cap, and Hairy are in line at a theater box office with Ponytail looking in at the window at the tickets sale. The window is partly shaded/reflectively-marked and cannot be seen through in the comic. There is a speaking grille in the window, plus a opening at the bottom for passing payment and tickets. To the left of the window are double doors and above all this there is a large theatrical billboard with small lights all around it. It reads:]\n\nPlaying Tonight\n\nThe New Supergroup:\n\n176 Pilots, Seconds of Summer, Non Blondes, Live Crew, gecs, Doors Down, Inch Nails, Republic, Direction, and Seconds to Mars\n\nadd a comment! ⋅ add a topic (use sparingly)! ⋅ refresh comments!"
