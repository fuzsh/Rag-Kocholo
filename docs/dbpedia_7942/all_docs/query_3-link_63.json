        "text": "Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic thinks that artists are limited in the melodies they can create, leading to all musicians essentially “stealing from each other.” He explained recently that with “only 12 notes in a scale,” true creative expression and freedom is limited. However, he added that he doesn’t really mind.\n\nSpecifically, Tedder noted that David Guetta uses his chord progressions in his own songs, but it doesn’t bother Tedder. Speaking with Metro‘s 60 Seconds column recently, per a report from Music News, Tedder explained, “I’ve known [Guetta] for 10 to 15 years and any time I’ve run into him, he reminds me he likes to use my chord progressions in his songs.”\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nHe continued, “It’s flattering but the truth of it is, we’re all stealing from each other! There’s only 12 notes in a scale so it’s kind of limited.” He then praised Guetta for his work ethic, saying, “But he’s an endless wellspring of energy. He’s more than a decade older than me but can go harder, doing shows at 5am and then playing the after-party.”\n\n[RELATED: The Meaning Behind “Love Runs Out” by OneRepublic and the Acclaimed Hip-Hop Producer Who Mentored Ryan Tedder]\n\nRyan Tedder of OneRepublic Says Their New Album is “Too Obvious”\n\nOneRepublic has just released their sixth studio album, Artificial Paradise, which is the final offering that completes their 2007 record deal. However, Ryan Tedder believes the record is a little “too obvious,” but clarified that he also loves it.\n\n“Sometimes you catch a hit with a really cool record you feel represents you,” he said. “We’ve had a few of those but every now and again, you have these overtly blunt pop records … but within the confines of my band I usually try to avoid those because it’s a bit cheesy and too obvious.”\n\nHe continued, “This was one exception where we were like, you know what, this is too obvious but f–k it! It’s been a lot of fun hearing that record everywhere that summer.”\n\nOneRepublic and Ryan Tedder are grateful for the hits they’ve had in their surprisingly long career, such as their No. 1 “Counting Stars” from 2013. Additionally, there’s the recent song from 2022, “I Ain’t Worried,” which was featured in Top Gun: Maverick and gave them another “massive worldwide” hit.\n\nFeatured Image by Stephen Lovekin/Shutterstock"
