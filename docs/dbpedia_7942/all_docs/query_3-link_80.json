        "text": "Ryan Tedder was walking through the streets of Amsterdam when he wrote “Love Runs Out,” his band OneRepublic’s new single.\n\n“I put on headphones, and I didn’t have any of the verse lyrics really fleshed out,” Tedder said. “I walked through Amsterdam for two and a half hours, and I would type in my iPhone when a line or a word would come up.”\n\nImmersed in big cities, Tedder watches people, observes interactions, absorbs daily life and turns it all into pop hits.\n\n“I kind of just unlock my mind, and I stop thinking about stuff and I’ll start reacting,” Tedder said over the phone. “I’ve been literally staring at this sea of humanity and I’m writing a soundtrack.”\n\nIt’s this writing process of Tedder’s that has contributed much to Top 40 music for the better part of a decade.\n\nAlong with writing for OneRepublic, the Colorado musician has also produced some of the biggest hits of the past few years. He co-wrote and produced Adele’s “Rumour Has It,” Beyonce’s “Halo” and “XO” and Ellie Goulding’s “Burn,” along with an impressive list of other tracks. For the past year or so, he has been in and out of the studio working on Adele’s highly anticipated new album and been involved in sessions with U2.\n\nLast year, Tedder made more than $2.5 million in the U.S. alone writing songs for many major pop acts — and his band — Billboard estimates. Meanwhile, OneRepublic saw a burst of life with its third studio album “Native.” The album’s first single, “Counting Stars,” hit No. 2, reaching the level of OneRepublic’s breakout track, “Apologize.”\n\nAs OneRepublic continues its “Native” world tour, Tedder is working two jobs, as he puts it: for OneRepublic and as a go-to guy in the industry for producing major hits.\n\nAhead of stops at Red Rocks Amphitheatre on May 28-29, Tedder spoke to us about the band’s newfound trajectory, returning home to Colorado and his lucrative writing career.\n\nAfter touring through Europe, does it feel good to be coming home next week?\n\nIt feels good. Basically I live in Denver, but I commute to L.A. pretty much every week. It’s pretty ridiculous. I believe I’m in town for eight or nine days. I’m going to catch a Rockies game and see some stuff.\n\nDo you plan anything special for these hometown shows or are they unique in their own right?\n\nI think they’re unique in their own right, and Red Rocks is unique in its own right. Anybody is lucky to get to play that venue. And the fact that we’re playing it twice and may add a third date, it’s almost not even imaginable. We used to dream about playing Red Rocks. When we were barely selling out the Fillmore, we were dying to play Red Rocks, and then we sold it out last year. You can see the exponential growth between last year and this year. It’s kind of hard to even believe for this band. We’ve worked hard for a number of years but it seems like only this last 12 months the dots have started connecting around the world. It’s almost weird.\n\nOne night of Red Rocks last year, two this year, what’s changed?\n\nWith our first album we had two big hits and our second album had bigger success, but we were not seeing that cross over to ticket sales. We still weren’t a viable ticket-selling act and it was really depressing. What that told me was that people still don’t believe in us. They don’t think this is real. So we thought, ‘OK, on this third album let’s give them something to believe in.’ I think these songs crossed that line, and it was like literally overnight: ‘We believe you now. Now we’ll come see you.’\n\nWhat type of headspace do you need to be in to connect to people like this with your writing?\n\nA certain word and certain lines conjure certain emotions, and I’m trying to tap into that. I don’t want it to feel too grand or too philosophical or too mundane or too lowest-common-denominator. I’m trying to write the most profound thing at any given moment, and it’s important for me to stay plugged into humanity.\n\nSo, I understand that you’re working with Adele on her next album. What’s the process like on those sessions?\n\nWe’ve collected a number of songs. I don’t know which ones will make the album. I think only she knows that. I know that some of them are great, and I’ll try to come in and bring the best that I can, because an artist as good as she is deserves the absolute best. I try to do what I do with anyone else, but with Adele the stakes happen to be a little bit higher.\n\nIs there ever any pressure for you going into writing sessions like these?\n\nI just wrapped up a couple weeks with U2, so any level of pressure that I could possibly have I’ve already experienced at this point. The pressure drives me. To make it an analogy to sports: Everyone on the court wants to be as good as Kobe Bryant, but the only way to do that is to practice, practice, practice. So I never stop writing, and when someone calls upon me to write something I’m already so immersed in that headspace that I don’t panic.\n\nTen years or 20 years down the road, do you see yourself being best known as the frontman of OneRepublic or as a writer?\n\nI think maybe both. It’s worked so far. I love the process more than I love any destination. Getting to Disneyland is half the fun. … If anything, people will see that just being good at something isn’t enough, you have to work at it and work harder than the next guy. That’s really what it’s about for me. If anything, I’ll be somewhat of an anomaly because being the lead singer of a band and writing stuff for other people is kind of an odd venture. I definitely didn’t plan it that way and it’s difficult to maintain. If anyone else wants to do that be my guest, but you’d better have a patient wife.\n\nMatt Miller: 303-954-1785, mrmiller@denverpost.com"
