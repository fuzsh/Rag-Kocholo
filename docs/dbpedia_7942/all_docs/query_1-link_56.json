Tickets are $37.50 and $16 for UAB students with valid ID. Tickets will go on sale Tuesday, Jan. 18. Call 205-975-2787 or visit www.AlysStephens.org.\n\nOneRepublic shot to fame on MySpace in 2007 with their hit song \"Apologize,\" captivating thousands of fans with their clean, spare, orchestral rock sound before they even had a record. The band was started in Colorado Springs, Colo., in 2003 by writer, lead vocalist, guitarist and pianist Ryan Tedder, after he spent two years working intensely with performer and producer Timbaland. That hit was not the song's original version, but a remix headed by Timbaland, who signed them to his Mosley Music Group, the first rock group on the label. The original appears on \"Dreaming Out Loud,\" the band's debut album, released in late 2007.\n\nAccording to PR Newswire, the remixed single of \"Apologize,\" featured on Timbaland's \"Shock Value,\" became the biggest radio airplay hit in the history of the Top 40 radio in North America, until its record was broken by \"Bleeding Love\" by Leona Lewis, ironically also co-written by Tedder. It peaked at No. 1 for eight consecutive weeks on the Billboard Pop 100 chart and reached the top three on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was a massive hit internationally, reaching No. 1 in 16 countries.\n\nOneRepublic is Tedder, Zach Filkins on guitar and backing vocals, Drew Brown on guitar, Brent Kutzle on bass and cello and Eddie Fisher on drums. One difference from other bands is that the members of OneRepublic are \"always rotating instruments. Sometimes we forget who plays what on a song,\" Kutzle says. In a concert review, Real Style Network states \"The highlight of the OneRepublic concert was seeing they are actually as solid live as they are on CD.\"\n\nAbout UAB's Alys Stephens Center"
