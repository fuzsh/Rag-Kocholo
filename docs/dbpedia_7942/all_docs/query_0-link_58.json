        "text": "Hometown: Los Angeles.\n\nThe lineup: Ryan Tedder (lead vocals, guitar, piano), Zach Filkins (guitar, vocals), Eddie Fisher (drums), Brent Kutzle (bass, cello, vocals), Drew Brown (guitar).\n\nThe background: Weird how today's most sonically adventurous R&B producers are fans of such terrible, conventional, safe music. Pharrell Williams and Timbaland, to cite the planet's two leading doyens of mindblowing avant-dance, both love Coldplay and have professed on several occasions their desire to work with those exponents of dreary balladry masquerading as cutting-edge angst. And lo! It has come to pass. Sort of. The next single to be released from Timbaland's 2007 album Timbaland Presents: Shock Value is Apologize, a remix of a track featuring MySpace US rock phenomenon OneRepublic. And it's OK, with the off-beat rhythm, strings and dub-spacious arrangement - all the things that have made Timbaland, Pharrell, Shekspear, Rodney Jerkins, Dallas Austin et al's future-R&B one of the signal sounds of the century. Sure, it's got the sensitive-boy bleating, predictable piano chords and unoriginal textures you'd expect from a bunch of Coldplay/Keane wannabes for whom Radiohead's The Bends and U2's One are Year Zero godhead artifacts, but the production gives the song, about \"the pain of multiple relationships gone awry and the necessity of moving on\", a dramatic darkness and lustrous intimacy it would otherwise lack. Then you check out the rest of the repertoire by OneRepublic, veritable MySpace sensations who, since June 2004, have accumulated over 12 million plays for their music and more than 145,000 \"friends\", and you confirm what you suspected: that Timbaland's production of Apologize is the best thing about the Colorado-born, LA-based OneRepublic.\n\nTheir sound is so generic it appears to have been contrived using manuals and spreadsheets. They've even got a frontman who, like Chris Martin, has pretensions towards diversification - just as Martin has collaborated with Swiss Beatz and Kanye West and once wrote a tune for R&B singer Jamelia, the Grammy-nominated writer/producer Tedder has written and produced tracks with/for, among others, Natasha Bedingfield, Jennifer Lopez, Lil' Jon, tATu and Bubba Sparxxx. And weirdly, like Martin, Tedder fails resolutely to bring any of that R&B sparkle to bear on his own records.\n\nAnd yet the five serious young men of OneRepublic are one of America's current hottest properties, sorry, we mean purveyors of quotidian melancholy, with aspirations to create music of spiritual intensity and inspire in their fans feelings of biblical awe. \"You go to a U2 concert and it's like church,\" says Tedder. \"I'd love to make people feel like that. I don't want someone to just say, 'Oh, nice voice, nice song.' I want that person to walk away and feel like he or she has had a religious experience. We want them to feel moved.\" And people, in their thousands, even millions, are feeling moved by these banal expressions of male anguish. The only surprise is that Tim Moseley is one of them.\n\nThe buzz: \"Timbaland + OneRepublic = RockBliss.\"\n\nThe truth: No, the equation you want is: OneRepublic - Timbaland = OneBigYawn.\n\nMost likely to: Encourage other R&B producers to collaborate with Generic Keanefodder (TM) merchants.\n\nLeast likely to: Fail, sadly.\n\nFile next to: Keane, Ross Copperman, The Fray, Coldplay.\n\nWhat to buy: Apologize by Timbaland/OneRepublic is released by Universal on October 22. The debut album OneRepublic will be released in November.\n\nLinks: MySpace page\n\nTomorrow's new band: Ben Esser.\n\nPaul Lester"
