He called Ryan (Tedder, OneRepublic’s frontman) the next day and he said, ‘I know exactly what to do here. I’m going to put a bunch of different animals that don’t belong together (on the cover) because you guys are completely different personalities. You guys would not be hanging out if you weren’t in the band,’ ” Kutzle, who is the group’s bass and cello player, said in an interview in advance of their concert April 21 at Canadian Tire Centre.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Elizabeth Payne, David Pugliese, Andrew Duffy, Bruce Deachman and others.

He’ll just freak out.’ So I guess I qualify as a gazelle. I could have been a giraffe. That would have fit too.”\n\nKutzle, a classically trained cellist, might seem an odd fit for a mainstream rock band like OneRepublic. But as he tells it, it was sort of a natural evolution.\n\nHis parents taught classical piano and he and his sister began piano lessons at age four or five in Orange County, California.\n\n“Every day before and after school we were forced to sit in the hot seat and practise. When I was about 10, my parents said it was time to learn a string instrument — my sister was playing violin at the time. They decided cello because they didn’t see any other kids playing the cello. They said, ‘You’re going to have a career playing cello some day.’\n\n“I hit it pretty hard for a while,” he said, citing the legendary Pablo Casals as his idol and Camille Saint-Saens’ The Swan as one of his favourite pieces. But by junior high school, “I was getting into bands and I started realizing that was a lot more fun.”\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nKutzle found writing his own music more interesting than playing off the page. He picked up the bass guitar and really has never looked back.\n\nThat doesn’t mean the cello was abandoned. He plays an indestructible black carbon-fibre model on tour, and he spends about a third of his time on stage with a bow in his hand. And like many cellists, he’s had a couple of them stolen. One that was worth about $10,000 was taken from the family garage. A second was pinched at a concert by someone pretending to be a roadie.\n\nKutzle says his eclectic background brings a certain energy and even a zany point of view to OneRepublic. He knows how to score music and that’s also helpful.\n\nRyan Tedder is the “top line” guy with the words and the melody, he says. “I come to the table with the oddball stuff. Because of my history I think left-of-centre. I’m the voice that has to be tamed.”\n\nLike Tedder, who is always involved in one side project after another, Kutzle has also branched out. He’s part of a band called Monarch, which has recorded an EP called Apollo.\n\nKutzle’s also a bit of a loner. On the day of the interview Kutzle, was in his RV with his wife, a river rafting guide, overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Some of his mates were at Coachella, the massive music festival in Indio, California, but Kutzle says he’s not into crowds like that.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“I’ve got a few mikes and guitars around and I am vibing off the atmosphere. RV. When I was a kid, my grandparents had a camper and I’d always climb into it.”\n\nOneRepublic is on a hiatus from almost two years of touring in support of their 2013 album Native, which sold more than 100,000 copies in Canada. But that doesn’t mean they aren’t working.\n\nThey were just in Tedder’s studio in Denver for a month, working on music for a new album. Kutzle hopes it will be out in early 2016.\n\nAnd that work will continue on their Canadian tour. “Our best work comes when we are on tour. What else do you do during the day?”\n\nOneRepublic\n\nWhere: Canadian Tire Centre\n\nWhen: April 21 at 7:30 p.m.\n\nTickets:capitaltickets.ca\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
