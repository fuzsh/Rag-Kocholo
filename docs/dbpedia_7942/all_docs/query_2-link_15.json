        "text": "Zach Filkins, the talented lead guitarist of the pop rock band OneRepublic, is selling his sumptuous home, a true luxury villa, located in the Chicago area for $3.75 million. Filkins and his wife Lindsay purchased this luxury house in La Grange, Illinois, about half an hour from the city, in 2009 for $445,000, according to property records. Since then, the couple has undertaken several renovations to significantly transform the property, making it comparable to a luxury château.\n\nFeatured by Mansion Global\n\nA History and Elegant Design\n\nBuilt in 1912, the house initially had a Foursquare design, typical of the historic district of La Grange. Upon moving in, the Filkins undertook DIY improvements, gradually transforming this residence into a true prestigious villa. They then embarked on a first phase of renovations in 2013, integrating elements worthy of a luxury villa. Between 2016 and 2017, the house was completely renovated, retaining only a small portion of the exterior walls, to include a new addition, making this property comparable to a luxury apartment for sale or even a luxury château. \"We essentially tripled the size and completely encapsulated the original structure,\" Filkins stated. \"My main philosophy for this luxury home was to find a balance between comfort for our family and guests, and classic details and design inspired by old English and Mediterranean architecture and interiors.\" This attention to detail and comfort makes this home not only a luxury property for rent but also a potential purchase for luxury real estate enthusiasts.\n\nA Spacious and Luxurious Residence\n\nToday, the house spans three floors, offering 5,382 square feet of living space, plus an additional 2,800 square feet in the basement, about 90% of which was excavated during the renovation. An attached heated and cooled garage for three cars, rare in this historic neighborhood, as well as a connected mudroom/entryway.\n\nThe spacious basement includes several rooms, including a cinema/game room, perfect for high-quality entertainment. \"There are big houses in La Grange, but this one exceeds expectations in terms of size and amenities,\" says Harrington.\n\nWith its high-end finishes and meticulous attention to detail, this house represents the pinnacle of refinement. It is perfect for those seeking a luxury home offering an unparalleled living experience. Whether you are looking for a prestigious villa or a luxury apartment, this property will meet all your expectations in luxury real estate.\n\nAn Inspired Interior Design\n\nFor the interior decoration, the couple drew inspiration from their favorite restaurants and hotels visited during their tours with OneRepublic, known for its hits \"Counting Stars\" and \"I Lived,\" such as the Corinthia in London and the Bowery Hotel in New York. \"I've always been drawn to the maximalism of Ralph Lauren and old English architecture,\" Filkins said. \"Although these styles involve a lot of detail and layering, one still feels completely at home.\"\n\nThe open-plan ground floor includes a family room, a living room, and a dining room, with several fireplaces, as well as a kitchen with a large island, a pizza oven, a wet bar, and a wine refrigerator. The house features five bedrooms and six and a half bathrooms. The master suite on the second floor includes two walk-in closets and a large bathroom with walnut vanities, a marble double shower, and a soaking tub.\n\nA Unique Opportunity\n\nDespite the care taken in creating this ideal home to live in, a new adventure is pushing the Filkins family to leave the Chicago area. \"Since Lindsay and I got married, we have dreamed of owning and operating a vineyard and winery, and last year, we were honored to be offered the opportunity to take over and rebrand an existing winery in Coloma, Michigan,\" he explained. \"We quickly discovered that we could not effectively manage this property from Illinois, so although it breaks our hearts, we must say goodbye to this house.\"\n\nSotheby's International Realty: Your Luxury Real Estate Partner\n\nSotheby's International Realty, a high-end real estate agency, is proud to present exceptional properties such as this house of Zach Filkins.\n\nFor those looking for luxury real estate in Paris, Paris Ouest Sotheby’s International Realty offers a range of specialized services including luxury real estate appraisal in Paris, high-end rental management, and advice on luxury real estate purchases.\n\nWhether you are looking for a luxury apartment with a view of the Seine, a contemporary villa with a pool, a prestigious duplex for sale in Paris, or even an 18th-century château for sale in Versailles, Paris Ouest Sotheby’s International Realty will meet your most demanding expectations.
