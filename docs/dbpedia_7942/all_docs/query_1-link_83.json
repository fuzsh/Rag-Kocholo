        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C., Feb. 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fresh Vine Wine Inc. (NYSE American: VINE) (“Fresh Vine”) previously announced it had executed a definitive merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) to combine with Notes Live, Inc. (“Notes Live”), the Colorado-based live entertainment and hospitality company, that currently operates entertainment campuses in both the Colorado Springs, Colorado, and Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan areas.\n\nNotes Live today announced that OneRepublic will headline its Sunset Amphitheater's Grand Opening on Friday, August 9th. Booked exclusively in partnership with leading concert promoter AEG Presents, the ultra-deluxe Sunset will boast an 8,000-person capacity with clear views from every seat in the house. With gourmet dining/drink options, crystal-clear sound, and other premium touches, the $90,000,000 entertainment campus will showcase Notes Live CEO JW Roth’s vision for what best-in-class live music and nightlife can be. The Sunset won’t just be a venue - it’ll be an experience.\n\nOneRepublic is a Grammy-nominated American pop-rock band formed in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 2002. The lineup currently consists of Ryan Tedder (lead vocals, piano), Zach Filkins (lead guitar, viola), Drew Brown (rhythm guitar), Brent Kutzle (bass, cello), Eddie Fisher (drums), and Brian Willett (keyboards, percussion, violin).

Let’s go, baby!”\n\n“In collaboration with Notes Live, we look forward to bringing a wide array of world-class artists to Colorado Springs and its surrounding communities. Sunset Amphitheater will be the perfect outdoor venue to host these events,” Brent Fedrizzi, Co-President and COO of AEG Presents Rocky Mountains says of the partnership.\n\nThe crown jewel of the Notes Live empire - which is building several other premium entertainment campuses nationwide - the Sunset’s other features include a top-of-the-line audio-visual system, a self-draining grass berm, and over 90 luxury fire pit suites, which all sold out two years in advance of its opening.\n\nMore information on Notes Live’s fully loaded entertainment campus in Colorado Springs, which already includes the Boot Barn Hall music venue, Bourbon Brothers Smokehouse & Tavern, and Notes Live Music and Social Bar, and more info on Notes Live overall, is below.\n\nThe Merger Agreement sets forth certain conditions precedent to any closing of the Transaction, including among other things, the approval of Fresh Vine’s and Notes Live’s shareholders, the receipt of regulatory approvals that may be required, including approval by the NYSE American for the continued listing of the combined company’s common stock after closing, Fresh Vine satisfying minimum net cash requirements and having no liabilities on its balance sheet or unpaid or unsatisfied obligations that will require a cash expenditure by Fresh Vine after the Effective Time, Fresh Vine completing a sale, license, transfer, disposition, or divestiture, or winding down of Fresh Vine’s current wine production business in a manner reasonably acceptable to Notes Live, the absence of dissenting Notes Live shareholders and the entry by Notes Live into lock-up and leak-out arrangements with its shareholders to its satisfaction.
