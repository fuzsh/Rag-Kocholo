        "text": "BIOGRAPHY\n\nEddie Fisher is currently in the studio writing and recording OneRepublic's fourth studio album. OneRepublic recently wrapped their world tour in support of the bands third album, Native. The Native World Tour included 281 shows, 154 cities, 43 countries, across 6 continents.\n\nEddie has contributed to over 25 albums during the course of his music career for artists such as Adele, Chris Cornel, Colby Caillat, James Morison, Kelly Clarkson & Birdy. Eddie Fisher, as a member of OneRepublic, has sold over 9 million albums; with over 45 million singles sold.\n\nFisher, a left-handed drummer, learned to play on a right-handed kit; he now uses an ambidextrous setup with an 18’ floor tom on the left, as well as a 14” and 16” floor tom on the right with a 13 inch rack tom in the middle. \"When I'm behind a kit,\" says Fisher, \"I don't want to look at it as a left handed kit or a right handed kit. This set up allows me to move anywhere at anytime.\""
