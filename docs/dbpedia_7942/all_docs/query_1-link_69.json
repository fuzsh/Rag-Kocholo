        "text": "Dido\n\n“Girl Who Got Away”\n\n(RCA)\n\nDon’t worry, Dido hasn’t cheered up too much. Advance reports that this British songwriter’s fourth album, “Girl Who Got Away,” would be a “big, fun electronic extravaganza” were misleading. Dido is still a forlorn, sensitive ballad singer, still wondering, as she does in “Blackbird,” “Why do I bring you love/When all you give me back is pain?”\n\nThe electronics are there, however, and they lift the album’s better songs out of the sad-sack zone. “Girl Who Got Away” revisits the fusion of folk-pop melodies and club beats that sold more than 28 million copies worldwide of Dido’s first two albums, “No Angel” (1999) and “Life for Rent” (2003). Her third album, “Safe Trip Home” (2008), switched producers, largely renounced electronics and grew more melancholy; it found fewer listeners.\n\n“Girl Who Got Away” reunites Dido with Rollo Armstrong, her brother and the leader of the dark dance-pop group Faithless, as her main producer and songwriting partner. And their songs continue to long for solace.\n\nBreakups, separations, loneliness and attempts at self-healing fill the album, buoyed by programmed beats. Greg Kurstin, who has produced Pink and Kelly Clarkson, sends electropop keyboards percolating through the bitter kiss-off “End of Night,” and he supplies the moody, descending bass line and trip-hop backbeat in “Happy New Year,” which has the singer missing an ex who may be absent or dead. “Go Dreaming,” which vows to rise above bullying, hints at Donna Summer’s “I Feel Love.”\n\nDido is no dance-pop belter; her sweet, small voice rarely escapes its underlying reserve, which can be soothing or merely dull. In the album’s title song, synthesizer chords puff gentle syncopations as Dido wishes she could be “the girl who got away” — less mousy and uptight, more passionate — but doesn’t expect much. “Sitting on the Roof of the World,” carried by folky guitar picking, reflects on sudden pop success and “not knowing how I got there or how to leave,” insisting that she’d rather just “fit in” to everyday life.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
