Brent Kutzle takes care of the bass, cello, backing vocals, piano, keyboards, guitar and production and Brian Willett stays on keyboards, backing vocals, drums and percussion.\n\nRelease date\n\nOneRepublic has been teasing their fans about their fifth studio album from mid-2019.

However, fans still had to wait for their new album, as the band again postponed the release date. âHumanâ will now hit the Internet on December 31, 2020, via Interscope. The album is up for pre-order .\n\nConcept\n\nTalking about the album âHumanâ, frontman Ryan Tedder had earlier told the Official Chart Company, â[Human] is re-calibrating everything. The last album, we stopped promoting it and kinda pulled the plug. I didnât have it in me to do anything for it. This is us returning back to what the original sound was: strings, orchestral and emotive,â as reported by UDiscoverMusic website.\n\nSpeaking further on the same, he stated, âYou know, is the traditional album model dead? For a lot of people yes, but because it was never alive to begin with. Depending on the age of the listener, it wasnât a thing, so how could it be dead? I have a nine-year-old and if we sit him down to listen to something like [The Beatlesâ] The White Album â which we do from time-to-time â then he understands that this is a group of songs part of the same project. Our process is both can exist. We just have enough songs to justify an album. And it feels good to tour with an album, it does make it a little easier with a title and with a concept to provide a construct and a focus.â\n\nTracklist\n\nOneRepublicâs âHumanâ complete tracklist is yet to be announced, however, the American band did drop a few songs on the Internet to promote their new project. The new record will also come with a deluxe version which will keep the fans hooked to a total of 16 songs.\n\nAccording to the website Genius, this is how the current playlist of the album âHumanâ looks like:\n\nâDidn't Iâ\n\nâRescue Meâ\n\nâSomebody to Loveâ\n\nâWantedâ\n\nâBetter Daysâ\n\nâFollowâ featuring Kygo\n\nWhere to stream\n\nOneRepublicâs âHumanâ will be available to fans on leading streaming platforms like , , , and .\n\nncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRop56aerOxz66ZpaGTYq6trtSmZKGtnZa7brDEpayxnV2rsrO%2FyKilZqqVobKiv8Rmm5qslWLBs63CpKOiq6RisLC6wp6nrWWSqse7ecWina2g"
