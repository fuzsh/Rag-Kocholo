Since 2020 MDL (ANNNA) has had releases on world famous electronic music labels such as DEFECTED, Spinnin' and Don Diablo's Hexagon records. These collaborations have influenced her own sound which have created a strong electronic and dance floor focused performance.\n\nYou see, literally yesterday, before someone forwarded me a link about this opportunity, I was going for a run and listening to Ryan Tedder on one of the latest podcasts by And The Writer Is. Ryan’s songwriting and work culture is something that has been pushing me since the very first song I wrote.
