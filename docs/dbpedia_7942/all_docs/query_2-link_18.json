        "text": "The stars are officially being counted for what may be the last time in Illinois, where Zach Filkins and his longtime wife Lindsay have placed their revamped Colonial-style mansion on the market for $3.75 million. The listing is held by Annie Harrington of Christie’s International Real Estate.\n\nThe cofounder and lead guitarist for the Grammy-nominated pop rock band OneRepublic acquired the Chicago-area property back in spring 2009 for a mere $445,000. Originally built in the early 1900s and extensively renovated and expanded by the design-savvy Filkins in collaboration with architect Michael Abraham—throwing in a special nod to his hotel stays while on tour—the structure features a New Orleans-esque façade paired with moody coastal interiors that come complete with a decked-out basement sporting a music studio and a gym.\n\nNestled behind towering hedges, amid a double half-acre parcel in the suburban La Grange neighborhood, the home stuns from the outset with its creamy stucco façade and a particularly eye-catching window, as well as a charming front porch accented by a handsome wood and glass entry door flanked by sidelights. There’s also an attached three-car garage tucked off to the side.\n\nRELATED: Justin Timberlake Gets $8 Million for 126-Acre Property in Tennessee\n\nOnce inside, expect five bedrooms and seven baths spread across nearly 5,400 square feet of living space on multiple levels, with the magic commencing in a wainscoted foyer. From there, a wide doorway leads to a wallpapered living room boasting a rustic coffered wood ceiling, built-in cabinetry, and a two-way fireplace that connects on the other side to a cozy and colorfully hued family room. As first reported by Crain’s Chicago Business, the living room was inspired by New York’s Gramercy Park Hotel, while the family room resembles Palihouse Santa Monica in Los Angeles.\n\nThe main floor also holds a wood-paneled dining room enhanced with a fireplace and glass doors spilling out to a veranda that’s ideal for al fresco lounging and entertaining, as well as a chic gourmet kitchen that goes fully modern with silver fusion quartzite countertops, a custom eat-in island, and a wet bar area sporting a large wine cooler, plus a small fortune’s worth of top-tier appliances—a Sub-Zero refrigerator and freezer and a bespoke pizza oven among them.\n\nRELATED: Part of John Denver’s Former Rocky Mountain Estate Just Hit the Market for $8.5 Million\n\nA curving iron-railed staircase heads upstairs, where double doors open to a sumptuous primary retreat displaying two walk-in closets and a luxe spa-like bath housing dual walnut vanities, a built-in soaking tub, and a glassy marble-clad shower. A private en-suite bedroom with an office nook also can be found on the top floor, making it the perfect spot for guests; and way down below, a nearly 2,000-square-foot lower level offers up a soundproof music studio/library replete with a plaid wall and built-in bookcases, along with a mirrored gym, a wine cellar, and a movie theater.\n\nAccording to Crain’s, the 45-year-old Colorado native and his wife are selling because they recently purchased a winery in Coloma, Mich., about 115 miles from La Grange, and plan to move there."
