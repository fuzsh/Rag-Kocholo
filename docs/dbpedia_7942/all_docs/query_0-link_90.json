Water vapor rises into the atmosphere. As it cools, it condenses and combines with tiny particles to form clouds. If the water droplets get big enough, they fall to the earth as rain! Capture the sound of rain and bring it inside with this awesome rain stick craft.\n\nSupplies:\n\nPaper towel tube\n\nTape\n\nScissors\n\nPaper\n\nTin foil\n\nDry beams. rice, or popcorn\n\nMarkers, crayons, paint, stickers, ribbon, or whatever else you want to decorate with!\n\nInstructions:\n\nPlace all your supplies on a clear surface with plenty of room to create.\n\nCut out two small pieces of paper to wrap over the ends of your tube, and one larger piece of paper to decorate and cover your tube. Ask an adult to help if you need it!\n\nUsing art supplies, decorate your paper however you want. Be creative!\n\nTape a small piece of paper around the end of your paper towel tube.\n\nScrunch the tin foil to make a snake like coil and put it inside the tube.\n\nFill the tube with beans, rice, or popcorn! Tip: Try using a funnel or a cone of paper to fill the tube.\n\nTape the second small piece of paper to the end of the tube.\n\nWrap the tube in your decorated paper and tape it in place.

Do this experiment to discover for yourself!\n\nSupplies:\n\n2 Chopsticks\n\n2 Metal forks\n\n2 Rocks (large enough to clink together)\n\nLarge bowl\n\nWater\n\nTray or similar solid board (we use plastic trays!)\n\nPlastic water bottle cut in half (this acts as a hydrophone)\n\nInstructions:\n\nStart by observing what objects sound like in our human environment, surrounded by air. Clink each pair of objects together in the air and listen to the sound they make.\n\nYou made a hydrophone out of a recycled plastic water bottle. This tool will allow you to hear what’s happening underwater! Place the narrowest part of the water bottle up to your ear and hold the cut\n\nend of the water bottle right over the surface of the water.\n\nHave a partner, it could be a sibling or parent, clink the objects together under the water. What do you hear?\n\nWhy do you think things sound different underwater? It all has to do with sound waves! Sound is what we hear when sound waves bounce off objects. Molecules are closer together in liquid than in a gas (like our air!), so there is greater opportunity for waves to bounce off molecules underwater. What do you think will happen when sound waves travel through a solid?\n\nPlace a tray (face down) up to your ear. Have a partner very lightly tap each one of the objects against the tray. How does this differ from what you heard in the water? What about in the air? Hypothesize why you think that is.\n\nWant to download these directions?
