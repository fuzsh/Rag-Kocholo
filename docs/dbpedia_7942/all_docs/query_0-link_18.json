The five member band consisting of Tedder, Filkins, Eddie Fisher, Drew Brown, and Brent Kutzle was formed in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 2002 by Tedder and his high school classmate Zach Filkins.Tedder has since revealed that the band was formed at a \"crossroads\" in his life: \"I was offered two publishing deals within two months of being in Nashvilleâ¦I could have just written songs and lived a carefree life, but I knew that I had to be an artist. I wanted to form a rock band and create my own sound.\"Based in Los Angeles, OneRepublic started out as an unsigned act on the social networking website, MySpace. Since June 2004, they have accumulated over fifty million plays for their music on the site. As of 2009, they are the number-one band on MySpace and have been in the MySpace Music's Top Artists since the summer of 2006.\n\nThe band gained further exposure when their 2007 single, \"Apologize\", was re-mixed and re-released on Timbaland's compilation album, Timbaland Presents Shock Value. The remix became an international chart hit in the fall of 2007. The song broke records after gaining 10,331 spins in one week. According to SoundScan, \"Apologize\" is the most legally downloaded song in US digital history with sales of over 4.3 million digital downloads in the US alone.It is also the second best-selling song of the decade.[24] OneRepublic's debut album, Dreaming Out Loud, includes both the song's original version and version with Timbaland, and was released on November 20, 2007 on Timbaland's Mosley Music Group imprint via Interscope Records.The band had previously been signed to Columbia Records, and their album was due to be released in 2006, but this did not occur. Tedder explained, \"Crap happened. People got fired. Labels merged and politics abounded\".Subsequently, the band was released from their deal with Columbia, and they were signed by Timbaland in the summer of 2006 becoming the first rock band to be signed to Mosley Music Group.Tedder has commented on the success of his band's hit single, \"Apologize\": \"The toughest thing to do is write a hit song, but we had a hit song before we had an albumâ¦ What has happened has been really strange and really great.\"\n\nTedder is a multi-instrumentalist. During OneRepublic's performances, he often switches from singing lead vocals to playing guitar, bass guitar, glockenspiel, tambourine, or piano. On rare occasions, he plays drums alongside the band's main percussionist, Eddie Fisher.\n\nThe band finished recording their second album, titled \"Waking Up\" on August 25, 2009, and released their lead single, \"All the Right Moves\" to radio and iTunes everywhere except Germany and Austria, where \"Secrets\" was released instead. The album was released on November 17, 2009 in the United States. To date, the second US single, \"Secrets\" has reached over 2 million digital downloads, and third single \"Good Life\" broke into the Top 10 on iTunes and radio everywhere.\n\nIn January 2012, the band was working on their third studio album, titled \"Native\".The album was released on March 26, 2013 to mostly positive reviews from music critics. It became the band's highest charting album to date, as well as their first top 10 album, debuting at no. 4 on theÂ BillboardÂ 200. It sold 60,000 copies within its first week. A portion of the proceeds from the sales of Feel Again, a single from the album, will be donated to Save the Children's Every Beat Matters campaign to support training frontline health workers around the world.\n\nguitarist|\n\næ¥å Â·è²»ç¾éæ¯ãZach Filkins\n\næ¨åè² è²¬ï¼åä»ãåè²ãä¸­æç´ï¼2002å¹´è³ä»ï¼\n\nZachary Douglas \"Zach\" Filkins (born September 15, 1978) is an American musician and model, but as of 2007 he is best known as the lead guitarist of the pop rock band OneRepublic.\n\nFilkins plays guitar and sings background vocals for the band.
