        "text": "This past Thursday, Ryan has branched off of OneRepublic’s main Twitter and Instagram to collect his experiences around the world with a new handle, @RyanTedder. Gaining attention and followers each coming day, I’ve decided to break this down and discuss what it means for the band….\n\n“Hello Instagram, I’ve put off doing this for enough years and finally decided it’s time to jump in, I take tons of photos and travel like crazy, so this is going to be fun. In my day job, I’m the lead singer of OneRepublic and I like to write songs for other people and eat really good food. Das it.” ~Ryan Tedder (@ryantedder) via Instagram [x]\n\nAs stated in his first post, Ryan has always wanted to share his story through photography. Sharing a similar passion as his wife Genevieve, Ryan has captured photos of his family, his travels and his concerts with OneRepublic. The images are pieces of art, showing the lead singer’s life in a whole new level. Fans are reacting, giving each post thousands of likes and endless comments.\n\nThere’s a funny story about how I suspected that this was coming. One of my Instagram friends, through a group message, shared that the handle “ryantedder” had been “hacked.” We took this as nothing, assuming that whoever had taken the username was putting their fairly inactive page to work. But as I noticed the name spelled out “R Y A N T E D D E R” and the profile picture changed to a black and white portrait of a familiar face, my thoughts changed.\n\nOn Sunday, Ryan hosted his own question and answer session on his Twitter. The Q&A (or rather, Q&Slay) discussed anything from Ryan’s favorite bands to future singles from Oh My My to some of his pet peeves. He confirmed that the band has some amazing openers for this year’s tour and that they will play about seven songs from their latest LP. In other news, he loves Tom Holland as Spider Man, English bulldogs and La La Land. Many fans got their questions answered. In addition, the Q&A was a great promotion for Ryan’s personal account.\n\n“Be more confident, give less shits about what anyone says. Oh, and bitch slap that kid from my high school that was a blatant racist.” ~Ryan Tedder (@RyanTedder) on Twitter when asked about advice he’d give his past self [x]\n\nIn my opinion, there is a list of positive things coming from Ryan’s additional social media. First, he has his own outlet to be creative, not necessarily being the face of OneRepublic. He is the “frontman,” but in recent months the main account has been focused more and more on him. I learned that when a tweet said “I” or “me,” it was referring to Ryan. In their description, all five members are listed, so this came as a frustration. I liked learning about Ryan’s favorite restaurants and his various collaborations, but not at the expense of the other musicians being shadowed over.\n\nHopefully, Ryan’s new Twitter and Instagram mean that other members (Zach and Drew especially, they’ve gone quiet on their personal accounts) will step up and show the world that they are integral parts of the band. OneRepublic is about all five of them, and my wish is that this can be well-represented in the digital world. They all have so many stories that they barely get to share in interviews! This could be the chance for them to connect with their fans on a more personal level, especially when they are traveling on tour."
