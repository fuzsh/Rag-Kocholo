        "text": "OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder must breed earworms in a laboratory.\n\nOver the last decade, he has written and produced hits for Beyonce (XO), Adele (Rumour Has It) and Taylor Swift (Welcome To New York), while his own band's hits include Apologise, Counting Stars and the current single Kids, external.\n\nYou may have heard him talking about songwriting, because that's what most interviews - including his last encounter with the BBC - tend to focus on.\n\nBut the 37-year-old is pop music's very own Renaissance Man - investing in medicine, accumulating historical artefacts and compiling the ultimate coffee bible.\n\nSo, rather than ask him about Adele and Beyonce, we used the song titles from the new OneRepublic album, Oh My My, as the jumping off point for a series of random, but revealing questions.\n\nIt turns out that some things are more important than his trophy cabinet...\n\nWhat's the worst injury you've ever had?\n\nWhen my Achilles heel exploded. I was playing basketball and my ankle just went off like a firework.\n\nThat was very painful, but it wasn't close to what happened next. I got to the hospital and the last little bit of tendon that was attaching my calf muscle to my ankle popped, so my entire calf muscle rolled up behind my knee. No pain in this lifetime will compare. It was so severe that I actually passed out.\n\nWhat will happen to America after the election?\n\nOh my God. My grandfather was born in the 1930s and he says this is the worst election he's seen in his lifetime.\n\nI don't think either candidate is the devil. If you're voting experience, Hillary clearly wins because you get two presidents for the price of one - her and Bill. But then you have all the trust issues. Trump, I don't even have to go into detail on why that's scary.\n\nBut I'll say this: The future still looks good because of the checks and balances system we have. If Trump gets in, he's going to get stonewalled.\n\nWhat's the best thing about being a father?\n\nEverything is the best thing about being a father. When our youngest kid sees me, he lights up like a Christmas tree. It's love on another level. Rare is the person you would throw yourself in front of a moving car for, but kids bring that out in you.\n\nDo you have a recurring nightmare?\n\nI've had one since college. It's the last week of school, and I get a call from a professor saying, \"You didn't come to my class once this entire semester and I'm failing you, so you're not going to graduate\".\n\nYou know why I have that dream? Because that actually happened. I was enrolled on a physical education course, but I didn't know and I missed every lesson. The guy said the only way he'd pass me was if I came in the next three days in a row, and ran two miles, then three miles, then five miles. And I had to do each one in a certain time. The three-mile race I had to do in 22 minutes, so a seven-minute mile, and I almost died.\n\nAfter I did it, the guy looked at me and he shook his head, and he said, \"You're lucky you're in decent shape because I was ready to fail you\".\n\nYou grew up in Tulsa which is a big oil city. Are you for or against fossil fuels?\n\nWhen I first made money from Apologise and Bleeding Love, I wanted to buy a solar panel farm. I was immediately looking into that as an investment strategy. I've invested in Elon Musk's [solar panel company] SolarCity and Tesla. I refuse to believe we live on a planet that doesn't have 100% renewable resources.\n\nI don't like to invest in bonds and mutual funds, so you have to find something, whether it's a streaming service or a green technology service, or a cancer-fighting company, and invest early. I'll cold call them and be like, \"Hey, you're developing an early-detection cancer system, what would it take to invest in your company?\".\n\nIs it possible for a songwriter to improve with age?\n\nThat's a really interesting question. In Nashville, there's a much greater likelihood that you can continue to have hits in your 50s and 60s.\n\nThe only pop writer I can name in the whole world who has continued to have true hits is Billy Steinberg [Madonna's Like A Virgin, The Bangles' Eternal Flame]. He still understands the craft and melody. And the key is collaboration. You have to have youth injected into your sphere.\n\nSo I'd say it's possible, but unlikely.\n\nWhat was the key ingredient in the conception of this album?\n\nFriends. Ed Sheeran influenced a few songs in terms of how I approached the lyrics. Bono made me question everything, try and beat every lyric, be more brutal.\n\nBut I have a couple of guy friends who are in their early 30s and they don't care about pop music. Those guys give me the best feedback. Their response means more to me than anyone.\n\nIf your house burned down, what's the one thing you'd save, apart from your family?\n\nI would say the documents that I've collected. I have handwritten letters from George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. I have one of the last remaining photographs of Lincoln before he died. I have a hand-drafted letter from Napoleon while he was at the peak of his power, with the seal of Italy. I've got a photo of the first flight taking off in Kitty Hawk, external, signed by Orville Wright. I have coins that were minted in 2 AD in Jerusalem, as Christ was literally walking through the streets.\n\nThey're all in the same area of my house and they're mostly wood and paper, so I'd be sprinting to those with a blanket, and I'd grab them and run out the door. The Grammys can burn.\n\nDo you read your own press?\n\nSometimes I do, sometimes I don't. It literally depends on the mood.\n\nMy issue with critics isâ¦ it's funnyâ¦ I read a negative review of us a few years ago and I was like, \"I need to know more about this guy because he's speaking as though he wouldn't like us if we were the last band on earth\". So I go and look at who he likes, and he just went to a Black Sabbath concert, he loves Megadeth, he thinks Arcade Fire is \"too pop\". I was like this guy can go stuff himself.\n\nThat's the only time I get irritated. Don't review us if you are predisposed to hate us.\n\nOh My My is out now on Polydor Records."
