        "text": "If the term â€˜hit factoryâ€™ had a human face, itâ€™d probably be Ryan Tedderâ€™s.\n\nYou might not know his name, but over the last twenty years, the Tulsa-born multi-hyphenate has crafted classic pop smashes for the likes of Adele, Jennifer Lopez, Paul McCartney, BeyoncÃ©, James Blunt, Kelly Clarkson, Kygo, Lil Nas X, and more.\n\nYou know a little song called Halo, by BeyoncÃ©? Yeah, that was him. As was Turning Tables by Adele, Happier by Ed Sheeran, Sucker by the Jonas Brothers, Bleeding Love by Leona Lewis, and Maps by Maroon 5. And thatâ€™s definitely not a definitive list.\n\n.\n\nBut all of that gets even more impressive when you remember that heâ€™s also the creative force behind one of the biggest pop-rock bands on the planet.\n\nAs OneRepublic, Tedder â€“ alongside Zach Filkins, Drew Brown, Brent Kutzle, Eddie Fisher, and Brian Willett â€“ has carefully crafted the kind of career that most bands could only dream of. Theyâ€™ve had number-one singles across the globe, sold countless albums, and performed in every venue thatâ€™s worth its salt.\n\nLike Londonâ€™s Wembley Arena, for example. And last night, when they took to the stage at one of the capitalâ€™s grandest enormodomes, it only took a moment for them to show each and every member of the sold-out crowd why theyâ€™ve hit those lofty heights.\n\n.\n\nHere at One on One, weâ€™ve seen a lot of live bands over the years.\n\nSome have been good. Some have been bad. Some have been so bad weâ€™ve wanted to gouge our ears off with a rusty spoon before the end of the second song. (No, weâ€™re not naming names.)\n\nBut out of all of them, it wouldnâ€™t be an exaggeration to say that OneRepublic are one of the best.\n\nFor a start, youâ€™ve got the setlist. A twenty-song Now Thatâ€™s What I Call Music-worthy compilation of some of the best pop-rock songs that have hit our ears over the last couple of decades. From the minimalist pop of Run to the stadium-worthy chorus of Stop and Stare via the ever-enormous Counting Stars and a surprisingly soulful rendition of Love Runs Out, thereâ€™s barely a moment wasted throughout the show.\n\n.\n\nAnd then, thereâ€™s Ryan Tedder.\n\nNot only is he one of the best songwriters on the planet, but it turns out that heâ€™s also a ridiculously good frontman. How unfair is that?\n\nSeriously, though â€“ the man is good. When heâ€™s not darting across every corner of the stage like a man possessed, heâ€™s hitting the kind of high notes that Celine Dion would be proud of; and when heâ€™s not doing that, heâ€™s seeming genuinely grateful for the fact that theyâ€™re able to come over to London and play to a crowd of this size. Oh, and thatâ€™s without even mentioning the 15-minute â€˜number one hits that I wrote for other peopleâ€™ medley that he casually plonks in the middle of the set.\n\nThey came, they saw, and they conquered Wembley with a barrage of hits so ferocious, it threatened to bring the roof down. So, the next time that OneRepublic roll through your town, make sure you head down to the show â€“ we can guarantee that you wonâ€™t be disappointed."
