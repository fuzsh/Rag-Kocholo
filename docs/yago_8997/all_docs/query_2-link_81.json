        "text": "Napoleon Bonaparte (born Napoleone di Buonaparte a.k.a. Napoleon I; August 15, 1769 – May 5, 1821) was a French military and political leader, and the Emperor of the French who rose to prominence during the latter stages of the French Revolution. Although he never existed during the time of movies, his name and complex were used in some Disney characters and villains. Napoleon the bloodhound from The Aristocats, Napoleon the cat from the W.I.T.C.H. series, Nicky Napoleon the penguin from Muppet*Vision 3D were named after him. He was spoofed by some Disney characters like Aladdin and Abu in the Aladdin TV series, Cogsworth from Beauty and the Beast (during the Castle War scene), Timothy Q. Mouse from Dumbo (when scaring Elephant Matriarch and the rest of the elephants), Cheetata from Timon and Pumbaa, and Peter Pan from Peter Pan (before fighting off Captain Hook in Skull Rock).\n\nColonel Spigot from TaleSpin, Cisco Pig from Timon and Pumbaa, Baron Blitz from Teamo Supremo, Professor Dementor from Kim Possible, Rico Suave from Hannah Montanna, and Dr. Hamsterviel from Lilo & Stitch suffer and have a Napoleon complex. Ratigan (like Professor Moriarity from Sherlock Holmes) from The Great Mouse Detective is known as the Napoleon of Crime. In 102 Dalmatians, after kidnapping Chloe's puppies, Jean-Pierre Le Pelt referred to himself as the Napoleon of Fur and Cruella as his Josephine (Napoleon's wife). In the Dave the Barbarian episode; \"Man of Tomorrow\", a picture of Napoleon was seen on a calendar in the month of January in Ned Frischmann's office and in the episode, \"Civilization\", he was accidentally conjured up by Oswidge Barbarian. In Swiss Family Robinson, he was mentioned by Mother Robinson about him conquering Switzerland.\n\nIn the Donald Duck short, The Autograph Hound, an actor named Charles Boyer was seen dressed up as Napoleon Bonaparte in reference to his film Conquest (1937) and the Ritz Bros. were seen spoofing him. In Modern Inventions, Donald Duck was seen wearing a Napoleonic hat as a replacement, each time the Robot Butler would take each of his hats away and in TaleSpin, Don Karnage is always seen wearing a Napoleonic style uniform. Donald also tried the woodpecker to look like Napoleon Bonaparte for a pose in Donald's Camera. A bust of Napoleon Bonaparte was featured in the Mickey Mouse short, The Grocery Boy. Donald does an impression of Napoleon Bonaparte while cleaning one of the windows in Window Cleaners and in the Quack Pack episodes; \"Leader of the Quack\" and \"Captain Donald.\" Huey does a Napoleonic impression in the Quack Pack episode; \"Heavy Dental\". Goofy does a Napoleonic impression in They're Off. Pumbaa was seen wearing a Napoleonic hat in the Timon and Pumbaa episode; \"Catch Me if You Kenya\". In \"Cooked Goose\", he was spoofed by Cheetata and Timon in \"Whiff\". Ibid was seen doing a Napoleonic impression in the Hercules episode, \"Hercules and the Owl of Athena\". In the DuckTales episode, \"The Masked Mallard\", a solid gold popcorn bowl belonging to Napoleon Bonaparte was being presented on display at the museum. In the Darkwing Duck episode, \"Dry Hard\", The Liquidator did a Napoleonic impression.\n\nA Disney movie called Napoleon and Samantha, was produced in 1972, where an 11 year old boy was named Napoleon. In The Princess and the Frog, Dr. Facilier was seen wearing a Napoleonic hat with a white smiling mask during Charlotte's party. Sarge in the Dinosaurs episode, \"Nuts to War (part 2)\" was seen wearing a Napoleonic hat despite having lost his right eye like one of Napoleon's enemies, Admiral Nelson.\n\nNapoleon finally made a small cameo appearance in the Aladdin episode: Vocal Hero, where Genie tries to replace his Bicorne hat with a paper hat. In the Aladdin episode: Power to the Parrot, after Iago, who was given the power of a genie by Genie, proves himself to be a better genie than Genie, Genie, feeling so sad and useless, mentions to a donkey next to him, while showing him pictures in an album, that he used to \"turn into stuff all the time\" including Napoleon, a grape, and Hurricane Ethel. In the House of Mouse episode; \"Gone Goofy\"'s Pit Crew, Goofy was seen wearing a Napoleon hat with Napoleon (off-screen) telling him it's his hat. Ludwig Von Drake was seen having carved a Napoleonic statue of himself in the House of Mouse episode; \"House of Scrooge\"'s Von Drake's House of Genius.\n\nIn The Sorcerer's Apprentice, it was shown that when Dave Stutler was 9-years-old, he wrote and earned a B- on a school report about Napoleon Bonaparte. This later stuck with Horvath after his last battle with Balthazar in the Arcana Cabana store ten years ago and then later returned to Dave after Horvath and Balthazar were free from their pot prison once again. In The Haunted Mansion, a portrait of Napoleon on his horse can be seen in the mansion. He was mentioned in the I Didn't Do It episode, \"Lindy & Logan Get Psyched\".\n\nIn the Zorro episode; \"Zorro Fights a Duel\", a French fencing instructor named Monsieur Gérard states that he was an instructor to the staff of Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte too."
