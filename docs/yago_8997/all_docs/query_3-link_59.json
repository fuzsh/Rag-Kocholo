        "text": "Louis Bonaparte\n\nKing of Holland\n\n1778-1846\n\nVery close to Napoleon during his early successes, Louis served with his brother in Italy and Egypt, fighting at Caldiero, Arcola and Rivoli.\n\nIn 1805, he was given command of the French troops in Holland and within a year was crowned king of that nation.\n\nHe fought the British during the Walcheren expedition and took a real interest in his adopted country's welfare.\n\nThis brought about a split with Napoleon over the Continental System of trade and he gave up his crown in 1810.\n\nLouis then travelled Europe before retiring in Italy."
