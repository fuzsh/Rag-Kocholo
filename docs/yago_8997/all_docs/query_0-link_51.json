        "text": "Letizia Ramolino was born in Ajaccio on 24 August 1750. She only received a rudimentary school education. She lost her father at the age of six and her mother soon married a captain in a Swiss regiment named Franz Fesch. Around the time of the birth of her half-brother Joseph (1763), who would later become her economic and spiritual counsellor, plans were already being made for the marriage of the 13-year-old city beauty. A student of jurisprudence, 18-year-old Carlo Bonaparte, was chosen and the wedding took place on 2 June 1764. Early on, both fought for Corsican independence, and after the French conquered the island in 1769, Bonaparte joined them.\n\nFor 20 years, Letizia dedicated herself to having children, sometimes with medical complications. When she became pregnant at the age of 14, she lost her first two children. This was not only an emotional blow for the young woman in a country where a woman's worth was measured by the number of children, especially sons. In 1768, she gave birth to Joseph, the first child to survive infancy. Her second son was Napoleon (called \"Nabulione\" by his mother), who was born nine days before her 19th birthday. By 1778, Letizia had given birth to three more children: Lucien, Elisa and Louis. When she was almost 30, she had her tenth child, Pauline, and 15 months later her eleventh, Carolina. The household was virtually overcrowded with children, a number of relatives and a nurse, and Letizia's talent for maintaining discipline was put to the test. The family's financial situation was difficult.\n\nHer last child, Jérôme, was born ten days after her husband left Corsica to receive treatment for a long illness. The family would not see her husband and father again. Carlo Bonaparte died shortly after New Year 1785, aged just 39, leaving Letizia with eight children, five of whom were under the age of ten.\n\nIt was the second-born son Napoleon, the only child with a professional education, who was to determine the family's future. When the Bonapartes were categorised as \"personae non gratae\" by the Corsican nationalists in 1793, Letizia and her family fled into exile in France, where they lived in poverty - a humiliating experience that would shape them for the rest of their lives. Napoleon, meanwhile, made a career for himself: After the successful defence of Toulon, he was appointed brigadier general and given command of the army in Italy. At the age of 30, he was the ruler of France.\n\nAfter Napoleon had himself crowned emperor in 1804, he continued to support his family financially and also provided his relatives with positions for which not all of them were fully suited. Out of loyalty to Corsica, he made his sister Elisa Princess of Piombino in 1805. In the following months, Joseph was appointed King of Naples, Louis King of Holland and Jérôme (now married to his second wife, Princess Katharina von Württemberg) King of Westphalia. The mother mistrusted the good fortune that her daughters and sons enjoyed during this time. On the occasion of Napoleon's imperial coronation, which she stayed away from, Letizia formulated the iconic sentence: \"Pourvu que ça dure!\" (\"If only it would stay that way!\").2 Her daughters refused to wear Joséphine's train for the coronation. But his family had not reckoned with Napoleon: Madame Mère would recognise herself four years later in David's famous depiction of the \"Sacre\". The artist certainly did not integrate the emperor's mother into the popular scene without Napoleon's knowledge ...\n\nLetizia, who now bore the weighty title of \"Madame la Mère de l'Empereur\", impressed the European courts with her modesty (there was also talk of avarice) and dignity. She invested her newly acquired wealth wisely and tried to keep the unruly family together. There were a number of unhappy marriages and unions and illnesses in the family. Letizia had reservations about Napoleon's marriage to Joséphine de Beauharnais, whose marriage remained childless, leading to divorce, and his second marriage to Marie-Louise of Austria (1791 - 1847). Marie-Louise finally gave birth to the hoped-for son and heir to the throne in 1811.\n\nBut Napoleon's star began to sink. Madame Mère accompanied Napoleon in his exile on Elba. For the first time in years, she was able to keep her descendants company and provide them with moral support. However, this was not to last, as Napoleon returned to Paris for 100 days. Almost all of Letizia's children attended the last family dinner before the debacle at Waterloo. Napoleon's tearful farewell to his mother is legendary.\n\nIn 1818, Letizia bought a 17th century palace in Italy to retire in. After the fall of Napoleon, Pope Pius VII had shown impressive magnanimity towards his relatives. No country had been prepared to take in the Corsican's family, especially Napoleon's mother. She was granted asylum in the Eternal City.\n\n\"I am truly the mother of all sorrows, and my only consolation is to know that the Holy Father has consigned the past to oblivion and to be mindful of all the kindness he has always shown to all the members of my family. We found support in the papal government and our gratitude will find no limits.\" With these words, Letizia describes her gratitude in a letter to Cardinal Secretary of State Ercole Consalvi.3\n\nShe led a pious and contemplative life in Rome while she waited anxiously for news of Napoleon, who was now living in exile on St Helena. After receiving the news of his death on 22 July 1821, she surrounded herself with a \"museum of memories\". Six months before her own death at the age of 87, she dictated her memoirs, almost blind, in which she said of her own final years: \"My life ended with the fall of the Emperor. From that moment on, I gave up everything forever.\"\n\nLetizia Bonaparte died in Rome on 2 February 1836. The death of \"Madame Mère\" was announced by the bell of the Capitol. The Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen removed the death mask from the deceased. At the insistence of the foreign envoys in Rome, the Bonaparte family was forbidden to inscribe the words \"Mater Imperatoris Francorum\" on the sarcophagus. They had to make do with the inscription \"Mater regum\". The imperial coat of arms could be seen at the burial, with the initials \"LRB\" for Letizia Ramolino Bonaparte and the inscription \"Mater Napoleonis\".\n\nShe left 1,700,000 francs to be divided among her children, although her inheritance was probably at least twice that amount. When asked about her enormous wealth, Letizia had the foresight to say: \"I have six or seven princes as children who will one day be in my pocket.\" 4 Letizia Bonaparte's body was transferred to Ajaccio in 1851 and buried in the imperial chapel in 1860."
