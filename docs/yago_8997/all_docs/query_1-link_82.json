Her husband soon rejoined her however. Elisa remained Duchess of Tuscany until 1814. Then Ferdinand III was restored to his throne.

Nicolas soon obtained public favour, especially in La Martellière’s Robert, chef de brigands, and as Count Almaviva in Bèaumarchais’ La Mere coupable.

Having turned against the revolutionary dictator Maximilien Robespierre, Barras was a leader of the coup against him on 9 Thermidor (July 27, 1794). As commander of Paris, he suppressed a royalist uprising on 13 Vendémiaire (Oct. 5, 1795) by turning the troops over to a young officer, Napoleon Bonaparte. Subsequently, Barras became (1795) a member of the Directory. He was notorious for his corruption and ostentation. During Napoleon’s coup of 18 Brumaire (Nov. 9, 1799), Barras consented to resign from the Directory, thus contributing to Napoleon’s success. After the coup, he lost prominence.\n\nBkXIX:Chap9:Sec1 One of the Representatives who ordered the siege of Toulon in 1793.\n\nBkXIX:Chap10:Sec1 A friend of Josephine de Beauharnais in 1795.\n\nBkXIX:Chap11:Sec1 Appointed Director of the Paris armed forces and the interior in 1795.

French political leader. An opponent of the Bourbon restoration, he aided the July Revolution (1830), but he was disappointed in the bourgeois monarchy of Louis Philippe. He became a leader of the parliamentary opposition to the July Monarchy and participated in banquets used to spread propaganda against the conservative government. He was a moderate in the February Revolution of 1848, which deposed Louis Philippe and established a republic. During the presidency of Louis Napoleon (later Emperor Napoleon III), he briefly headed (1849) the cabinet but was dismissed when Louis Napoleon replaced his legislative advisers with a personal cabinet. Under the Third Republic he was (1872–73) president of the council of state. Some of his writings were collected as Mémoires posthumes (1875–76).\n\nBkXXIII:Chap2:Sec1 A Royalist at one time.\n\nBkXXXII:Chap1:Sec1 Involved in the July Revolution of 1830.\n\nBkXXXII:Chap6:Sec1 Appointed secretary of the Municipal Commission on 29th July 1830.\n\nBkXXXII:Chap11:Sec1 Sent by Lafayette to the Chamber of Deputies.\n\nBkXXXIII:Chap3:Sec1 Appointed as one of the three Commissioners charged with escorting Charles X to Cherbourg in 1830.\n\nBarry, Marie-Jeanne Bécu, Comtesse du\n\n1743-1793. Last of the mistresses of Louis XV. Although she exercised little political influence at the French court, her unpopularity contributed to the decline of the prestige of the crown in the early 1770s. She was born the illegitimate daughter of lower-class parents. After a convent education, she worked as a shop assistant, under the name Jeanne Vaubernier, in a fashion house in Paris. While there she became the mistress of Jean du Barry, a Gascon nobleman who had made a fortune as a war contractor. He introduced her into Parisian high society, and her beauty captivated a succession of nobly born lovers before she attracted Louis XV’s attention in 1768. She could not qualify as official royal mistress (maîtresse en titre), a position vacant since the death of Madame de Pompadour in 1764, unless she was married to a noble. Hence, Du Barry arranged a nominal marriage between Jeanne and his brother, Guillaume du Barry; in April 1769 she joined Louis XV’s court. The Comtesse immediately joined the faction that brought about the downfall of Louis XV’s powerful minister of foreign affairs, the Duke de Choiseul, in December 1770; and she then supported the drastic judicial reforms instituted by her friend the chancellor René-Nicolas de Maupeou, in 1771. She spent much of her time on the estates that Louis had given her near Louveciennes, where she earned a reputation as a generous patron of the arts. On the death of Louis XV (May 1774) and the accession of Louis XVI, Madame du Barry was banished to a nunnery; from 1776 until the outbreak of the Revolution she lived on her estates with the Duke de Brissac. In 1792 she made several trips to London, probably to give financial aid to French émigrés. Condemned as a counter-revolutionary by the Revolutionary Tribunal of Paris in December 1793, she was guillotined.\n\nBkV:Chap14:Sec1 BkXXXIV:Chap12:Sec1 BkXLII:Chap10:Sec1\n\nMentioned.\n\nBarthe, Félix\n\n1795-1863.

It was directed at the Legitimists as well as those who profited from the new regime. The lines addressing Chateaubriand were from 6th November 1831. The 52 poems were published in 1832.

A French writer and numismatist who while studying for the priesthood, which he intended to join, devoted much attention to oriental languages, and the study of classical antiquities, particularly in the department of numismatics. In 1744 he went to Paris with a letter of introduction to M. Gros de Boze, perpetual secretary of the Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres and keeper of the royal collection of medals. He became assistant to M. de Boze. In 1753, upon the death of de Boze, he succeeded to the post and remained in this position until the Revolution. In 1755 he accompanied the, French ambassador, M. de Stainville, afterwards duc de Choiseul, to Italy, where he spent three years in archaeological research. After the fall of his friend Choiseul (1770), Barthélemy followed him into exile at Chanteloup, near Amboise, where unlike the abbés de cour he was busily engaged in polishing his elaborate literary productions. In 1789, after the publication of his Voyage du jeune Anacharsis en Grèce dans le milieu du IVe siècle, he was elected a member of the French Academy. During the Revolution Barthélemy was arrested (September, 1793) as an aristocrat and confined in a prison for a few days. The Committee of Public Safety, however, were no sooner informed by the duchess of Choiseul of the arrest than they gave orders for his immediate release, and in 1793 he was nominated librarian of the Bibliothèque Nationale. He refused this post but resumed his old functions as keeper of medals, and enriched the national collection by many valuable accessions. Having been despoiled of his fortune by the Revolution, he died in poverty.\n\nBkIX:Chap2:Sec1 Chateaubriand met him in Paris in1792.\n\nBartholoni, Messieurs\n\nTwo brothers, they were clerks to the Comte de La Panouse.

This contract ended in 1767, which is also when he began publishing colour prints, and continued to work with the Keeper of the King’s Drawings. His reputation was such that he was one of the five foreign original members of the Royal Academy in 1768. In 1802 he went to Lisbon as the Director of the National Academy at the invitation of the Prince Regent and died there in 1815.\n\nBkXXIX:Chap1:Sec2 His engraving of Madame Récamier in 1802.\n\nBartram, William\n\n1739-1823.

His book vividly portrays the plants and wildlife of the country and lists 215 native birds, the most complete list of that time. His influence is seen in the works of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Chateaubriand, and other writers who found his book an unexcelled source of descriptions of the American wilderness and its inhabitants.\n\nBkVIII:Chap2:Sec1 His travels.\n\nBasil, Saint\n\nc330-379.

On June 20, the deputies of the Third Estate took the oath of the Jeu de Paume ‘to not separate until the Constitution had been established.’ The Deputies’ opposition was echoed by public opinion. The people of Paris decided to march on the Bastille, a state prison that symbolized the absolutism and arbitrariness of the Ancien Regime. The storming of the Bastille, on July 14, 1789, immediately became a symbol of historical dimensions; it was proof that power no longer resided in the King or in God, but in the people, in accordance with the theories developed by the Philosophes of the 18th century.\n\nBkI:Chap1:Sec5.

It grew into a ‘Beguine city’ with a church, a chapel, a communal house, an infirmary, eighteen ‘convents’ or houses, and 103 houses. There is still one street left with a couple of buildings, and the Church, dedicated to St. Elisabeth of Hungary (the oldest part of this church is from the 13th century). The Small Beguinage was founded a year after the Great one, in 1235, and it is situated in the ‘Lange Violettenstraat’, the ‘long street of violets’. Because it was built next to the hayfields of the abbey ‘Nonnenbos’ (forest of the nuns), it was called Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-ter-Hooie. Most of the buildings, still standing, were built between 1600 and 1700.\n\nBeker, see Becker\n\nBekir\n\nA Mameluke.\n\nBkXIX:Chap18:Sec1 Executed after the fall of Jaffa in 1799.\n\nBelfort\n\nThe town is in a strategic position in north-eastern France, on the Savoureuse, in the Belfort Gap.\n\nBkXLII:Chap3:Sec1 The scene of the republican Belfort Conspiracy in the military in December 1821/January 1822 (in which Carrel was involved) and of further Carbonari insurrections in 1822.\n\nBelgiojoso, Maria Christina Trivulzio, Princess\n\n1808-1871.

She was built at the shipyard of Edward Greaves. The vessel was named for the Greek warrior who rode the winged horse Pegasus and slew the Chimera. She fought at the battle of The Glorious First of June the Battle of the Nile and the Battle of Trafalgar (with future Arctic explorer John Franklin as a midshipman), becoming one of the most famous British ships of the Napoleonic Wars. Having difficulty pronouncing the ship’s classical name, her crew affectionately called her the Billy Ruffian. She achieved further fame on July 16, 1815 when Napoleon Bonaparte surrendered to Captain Frederick Lewis Maitland (later Rear Admiral Sir Frederick Maitland) and was transported to Torbay where the ship anchored off Brixham on July 24. There Maitland received orders from Admiral Lord Keith. He was ‘...most positively ordered to prevent every person whatever from coming on board the ship you command, except the officers and men who compose her crew’. In response to his orders, Captain Maitland refused to allow the usual visits of the boats full of traders with supplies of fresh food. John Michelmore, aboard one of the boats hoping to sell bread, saw a sailor in one of the lower gun-ports who signalled to them and then set adrift a small bottle containing a message that Bonaparte was aboard. He and the baker rowed ashore and the news quickly spread. While Maitland still kept boats from actually coming alongside, there were no further attempts to conceal the Emperor’s presence. After two days, Bellerophon received orders to proceed to Plymouth harbour where Lord Keith was anchored aboard his flagship HMS Ville de Paris. Napoleon remained on board Bellerophon and the ship was still kept isolated from the throngs of curious sightseers by two guardships anchored close at hand. On August 4, Lord Keith ordered Bellerophon to go to sea and await the arrival of HMS Northumberland which had been designated to take Napoleon into exile on St Helena. On August 7, Napoleon left the Bellerophon where he had spent over three weeks without ever landing in England and boarded Northumberland which then sailed for St Helena. Bellerophon continued in use as a prison ship. She was renamed Captivity in 1824, and sold 12 January 1836.\n\nBkXXIV:Chap3:Sec1 Napoleon sends a letter to the Prince Regent via her.\n\nBkXXIV:Chap4:Sec1 Napoleon conveyed to her by the Épervier.\n\nBelleville\n\nA hill-top traditionally working-class district it is situated in north-east Paris.\n\nBkXXII:Chap11:Sec1 Fighting there in 1814.\n\nBkXXXVI:Chap1:Sec1 The earliest roller coasters descended from Russian winter sled rides held on specially constructed hills of ice, especially around St Petersburg. By the late 1700s entrepreneurs elsewhere began copying the idea, using wheeled cars built on tracks. Les Montagnes Russes à Belleville constructed and operated a gravity track in Paris from 1812. The first loop track was probably also built in Paris from an English design in 1846. A number of languages (Danish, French, Portuguese, Spanish) use the equivalent of ‘Russian mountains’ to refer to them.\n\nBellevue, France\n\nThe Château de Bellevue near Sèvres was the home of Madame de Pompadour.\n\nBkXXXIII:Chap1:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nBelliard et de l’Empire, Augustin-Daniel, Comte de\n\n1769-1832.

French mendicant and Roman Catholic saint. At the age of sixteen, he attempted to join the Trappists, Carthusians, and Cistercians, but each order rejected him as unsuitable for communal life. He therefore settled on a life of poverty and pilgrimage. He travelled to most of the major shrines of Europe, and begged for his food while giving away any alms offered to him. In the last years of his life, he lived in Rome and made only a yearly pilgrimage to Loreto. He died of his malnutrition on April 16, during Holy Week, in 1783. A cult grew up around him very soon after his death, and he was made Venerable by Pius IX in 1859, with canonization by Leo XIII in 1881.\n\nBkIX:Chap2:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nBenedictines\n\nBenedictines are members of the Roman Catholic Order of Saint Benedict of Nursia (c480-550) the father of Western Monasticism.

A Russian general, he took part in the conspiracy to assassinate Tsar Paul I, but his role in the actual killing remains a matter of conjecture. Tsar Alexander I made him governor-general of Lithuania in 1801, and in 1802 a general of cavalry. He encountered Napoleon at Eylau, but six months later met with the crushing defeat of Friedland the direct consequence of which was the treaty of Tilsit. He was present at Borodino. After the death of Kutuzov he was placed at the head of an army. Bennigsen led one of the columns which made the decisive attack on the last day of the battle of Leipzig in 1813.

Banished from Florence after fighting a duel, in 1519 he went to Rome. Under the patronage of Pope Clement VII he became known as the most skilful worker in metals of his day. Imprisoned on false charges, he worked at the court of Francis I at Paris after his release. He returned to Florence (1545), remaining until his death. The famous gold and enamel saltcellar (Saliera) of Francis I (Vienna Mus., stolen 2003) and the gold medallion of Leda and the Swan (Vienna Mus.) are perhaps the best examples of those remaining.

Unter den Linden (Under the Lindens) – named for its linden or lime trees line the grassed pedestrian mall between the two carriageways is one of Berlin’s best-known streets. A boulevard of linden trees was planted from 1647 extending from the electoral palace to the gates of the city by Friedrich Wilhelm, ‘The Great Elector’, who wanted to ride from his castle to his hunting park the Tiergarten with more appropriately Baroque splendour. This stretch became the best known and grandest street in Berlin. Das Morgenblatt, the ‘Morning Paper for the Educated Class’ ran from 1807 to 1865. Johann Friedrich Cotta came up with the idea for this periodical which appeared up to six times a week and the design of which was modelled on that of a newspaper. It was a tremendous success and employed all the talents of the period.\n\nBkXXVI:Chap3:Sec1 The Botanical Gardens mentioned (since moved to Steglitz) were in the Schoeneberg district. Chateaubriand visited them in February 1821.\n\nBkXXVI:Chap6:Sec1 BkXXVI:Chap9:Sec1 The Charlottenburg Palace is the largest in Berlin. The original, central part was constructed between 1695 and 1699. It was intended as the summer home for Sophie Charlotte, Elector Frederick III’s wife. The park behind Schloss Charlottenburg was originally laid out in French Baroque style. In the 18th and 19th century, the park was converted into a landscape garden. The Queen of Prussia, Louise, is buried beneath a marble tomb (1811-14) by Rauch (1777-1857) in the Mausoleum at Charlottenburg.\n\nBkXXVI:Chap6:Sec1 Chateaubriand left Berlin on the 19th of April, 1821, to attend the baptism of the Duke of Bordeaux.

He became King of Sweden and Norway (1818–44), after serving as a French Revolutionary general. He rose from the ranks, during the Italian campaign (1796–97), was French ambassador at Vienna (1798), and was Minister of War (1799). He played a prominent part in the victory of Austerlitz in 1805. Napoleon made him a Marshal of the Empire (1804) and Prince of Ponte Corvo (1806). However, his relations with the emperor were cool. While commanding in N Germany he negotiated with the Swedes, who were impressed by his generous conduct. In 1809, Gustavus IV of Sweden abdicated and was succeeded by his aged and childless uncle, Charles XIII. In need of both a suitable successor to Charles and an alliance with Napoleon, Sweden turned to Bernadotte. After receiving the support of Napoleon and joining the Lutheran Church the marshal accepted. He was elected crown prince by the Riksdag and adopted (1810) by Charles XIII as Charles John. The infirmity of the old king and the dissensions in the council of state put the reins of government in the hands of the crown prince. He favoured the acquisition of Norway from Denmark rather than the re-conquest of Finland from Russia, and thus he threw in his lot with Russia and England against Napoleon and Denmark. His Swedish contingent played an important part in the defeat of Napoleon at the battle of Leipzig (1813), and in 1814, having marched his army into Denmark, he forced the Danes to cede Norway in the Treaty of Kiel. Norway, was united with Sweden under a single king. The Congress of Vienna confirmed the union but restored the town of Ponte Corvo to the Pope. Bernadotte succeeded to the throne in 1818 as Charles XIV. He maintained peace throughout his reign, which was marked by internal improvements, notably the completion of the Göta Canal and a reform of the school system. However, his increasing opposition to the liberals made him unpopular by the end of his reign. The founder of the present Swedish dynasty, he was succeeded by his son, Oscar I.\n\nBkXIX:Chap1:Sec1 BkXX:Chap11:Sec1 King of Sweden from 1818.\n\nBkXIX:Chap13:Sec1 French Ambassador in Vienna in 1798.

After the defeats of Lützen and Bautzen it was the Swedish Crown Prince as he then was who put fresh heart into the allies; and at the conference of Trachenberg drew up the general plan for the campaign which began after the expiration of the Truce of Plaswitz. Charles John, as commander-in-chief of the northern army, successfully defended the approaches to Berlin against Oudinot in August and against Ney in September at the Battles of Grossbeeren and Dennewitz; but after Leipzig he went his own way, determined at all hazards to cripple Denmark and secure Norway.\n\nBkXXII:Chap4:Sec1 He defeated Ney at Dennewitz near Berlin on 6th September 1813.\n\nBkXXII:Chap6:Sec1 The defection of the Saxons and Wurtembergers to him at Leipzig in 1813 decided the outcome of the battle.\n\nBkXXII:Chap 24:Sec1 Chateaubriand is offered the Swedish embassy in 1814.\n\nBkXXIII:Chap11:Sec2 Chateaubriand pokes fun at his pretensions.\n\nBkXXVIII:Chap18:Sec1 Described by Constant.\n\nBkXXXIII:Chap1:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nBernard, of Clairvaux, Saint\n\n1090-1153.

A French naturalist and author, he was a friend of Rousseau, by whom he was strongly influenced. His chief work, Les Études de la nature (1784-88), sought to prove the existence of God from the wonders of nature; it is rich in descriptive passages, and added specific colour terms and plant names to the French language. A section of this was the sentimental prose idyll Paul et Virginie (1788), which attained an immense vogue and influenced the French romanticists.\n\nBkIX:Chap2:Sec1 BkXLII:Chap7:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nBkX:Chap3:Sec2 The reference is obscure.\n\nBkXII:Chap4:Sec2 Les Études de la nature influenced Chateaubriand.\n\nBkXXIV:Chap9:Sec1 A reference to Paul et Virginie set in Mauritius (Indian Ocean).\n\nBern, Switzerland\n\nThe Swiss capital on the River Aare, it joined the Swiss Confederation in 1353 and became the capital in 1848.\n\nBkXXXV:Chap20:Sec1 The dissensions of 1832 were part of the constitutional reform movement known as the Regeneration.\n\nBernetti, Tommaso, Cardinal\n\n1779-1852.

A French statesman and Cardinal, he became known as one of the most expert epigrammatists at Louis XV’s court, and by his verses won the friendship of Madame de Pompadour, the royal mistress. In 1751 he was appointed to the French embassy at Venice. He took an important part in the delicate negotiations between France and Austria which preceded the Seven Years War. He became secretary for foreign affairs on June 27, 1757, but owing to his attempts to counteract the spendthrift policy of the Marquise de Pompadour fell into disgrace and in 1758 was banished to Soissons by Louis XV.

His assassination by a saddler, Louis-Pierre Louvel, during the reign of Louis XVIII — an attempt to extinguish the Bourbon line—gave the ultra-royalists the opportunity to turn Louis XVIII against the liberals. Berry’s posthumous son was Henri, Comte de Chambord.\n\nBkIV:Chap1:Sec1 BkXXII:Chap19:Sec1 BkXXXVIII:Chap1:Sec1 His assassination mentioned.\n\nBkIX:Chap16:Sec1 Chateaubriand refers to his Mémoires of the Duc du Berry’s life, published in May 1820.
