        "text": "What were the two main things Napoleon I wanted? Power and an heir… To achieve this, he set aside two women: Désirée Clary and Josephine de Beauharnais. In the end, he lost everything and his son died before continuing the Bonaparte line. And what happened to the two women? Together they are the ancestors of the ruling houses of Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Greece, Belgium and Luxembourg… Quite the revenge!\n\nNapoleon\n\nBefore becoming the Emperor of France, Napoleon, a poor soldier, got engaged with Désirée Clary, a merchant girl from Marseilles. While in Paris, he met Josephine de Beauharnais. He broke off the engagement with Désirée and married Josephine. After a couple of years, Napoleon became Emperor and needed an heir. It was obvious that the couple would not get any children and he decided to divorce Josephine and marry Marie Louise of Austria. They eventually had one son, Napoleon (roi de Rome). After Bonaparte’s fall, Napoleon was brought up in Austria and died at the tender age of 21 years old.\n\nWhat about the revenge?\n\nAfter Napoleon left her, Désirée got married to Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte. They married on August 17, 1798. They got one son in 1799 and named him Oscar. In 1810, Jean-Baptiste was chosen as the new King of Sweden and Désirée became Queen of Sweden. To secure the throne, the new Charles XIV of Sweden wanted to join his blood with old royal dynasties of Europe. He made a list of candidates for the future wife of his son Oscar and decided for Josephine of Leuchtenberg, because she had connections both to the old dynasties of Europe through her mother, and to the House of Bonaparte through her father. It turned out, her father was Eugene de Beauharnais, son of Josephine de Beauharnais, the wife Napoleon I had divorced from.\n\nI found this already a fun fact. But when I started making their family tree, I figured out that there descendants still rule some Royal Houses in Europe: Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Greece, Belgium and Luxembourg. Please click on the image to see the full family tree.\n\nDo you know other examples of these kinds of historical revenges? I would love to hear them."
