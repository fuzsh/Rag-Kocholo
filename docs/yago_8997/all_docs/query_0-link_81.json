        "text": "Many books and blogs have been written about Napoleon and also about his brothers. Less is known about the rest of his siblings. Meet his three sisters:\n\nÉlisa\n\nÉlisa was born in Ajaccio, Corsica in 1777. She was christened Maria-Anna, but later officially adopted the name Elisa.\n\nAround 1795, Elisa met Felice Pasquale Baciocchi (later Levoy), a Corsican nobleman and formerly a captain in the Royal Corse. They married in 1797. They were parents of four children:\n\nFelix Napoléon Baciocchi Levoy (1798–1799)\n\nElisa Napoléone Baciocchi Levoy (1806–1869)\n\nJérôme Charles Baciocchi Levoy (1810–1811)\n\nFrédéric Napoléon Baciocchi Levoy (1814–1833)\n\nNapoleon awarded Élisa the Principality of Piombino. In June 1805, the oligarchic Republic of Lucca, was added to their domain. In 1809 she also became Grand Duchess of Tuscany. She was really involved in all her territories and ordered many improvements.\n\nÉlisa’s relations with Napoleon became increasingly strained. Napoleon frequently recalled Élisa for any irregularity in her execution of his orders in Tuscany.\n\nAt Napoleon’s fall, Élisa was forced to abdicate as Grand Duchess of Tuscany. She fled to Italy and was able to stay in Austria for a time thanks to the efforts of her brother, Jérôme Bonaparte, before moving to the Villa Caprara in Trieste. On 13 April 1814, Élisa was arrested and interned in the Austrian fortress of Brünn. She was freed and authorized to stay in Trieste with the title of Countess of Compignano. Élisa acquired a country house at Villa Vicentina near Cervignano after her release and financed several archaeological digs in the region. She contracted a fatal illness in June 1820 and died on 7 August at the age of 43. She was buried in the San Petronio Basilica of Bologna.\n\nPauline\n\nMaria Paola Buonaparte was born in Ajaccio, Corsica in 1780. She was popularly known as “Paoletta” and later “Paulette”.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte, despite the fact that Pauline was in love with someone else, married her to General Charles Leclerc on 14 June 1797. Pauline gave birth to her only son, Dermide Louis Napoleon, on 20 April 1798.\n\nNapoleon wished to restore French authority in Saint-Domingue, and appointed General Leclerc as Governor-General of the island. Leclerc, Dermide, and Pauline embarked for the colony from Brest on 14 December 1801.\n\nThe climate was taking its toll on Pauline’s health. Both she and Dermide suffered from spells of yellow fever. She did, however, find time to take numerous lovers. Leclerc wanted his wife to go back to Paris, but she refused. On 22 October 1802, Leclerc fell ill. He died on 1 November, probably of yellow fever. Seven days later, Pauline, Dermide, and Leclerc’s remains were hastily ferried back to mainland France.\n\nPope Pius VII’s envoy, Giovanni Battista Caprara, suggested to Napoleon that Camillo Borghese, 6th Prince of Sulmona, would be a suitable husband for Pauline. On 28 August 1803, they were married by Caprara.\n\nCamillo, Pauline, and Dermide arrived in Rome on November 14. The couple was happy at first, but it quickly changed into dislike. Her son Dermide, always a delicate child, died on August 14, 1804 in the Aldobrandini villa in Frascati, after a violent fever and convulsions.\n\nIn 1806, Napoleon made his sister sovereign Princess and Duchess of Guastalla. Pauline disliked Napoleon’s second wife Empress Marie Louise. This was the cause of a temporary frostened relationship between brother and sister. But that changed upon Napoleon’s fall. Pauline liquidated all of her assets and moved to Elba, using that money to better Napoleon’s condition. She was the only Bonaparte sibling to visit her brother during his exile on Elba.\n\nAfter Waterloo Pauline moved to Rome, where she enjoyed the protection of Pope Pius VII, as did her mother Letizia and other members of the Bonaparte family. Pauline lived in a villa near the Porta Pia that was called Villa Paolina. She died from pulmonary tuberculosis in Palazzo Borghese in 1825.\n\nCaroline\n\nCaroline was born in Ajaccio, Corsica in 1782. During the French Revolution, she was educated as a pupil at the school in St-Germain-en-Laye founded by Madame Jeanne Campan. She attended the school at the same time as Hortense, Joséphine’s daughter.\n\nShe fell in love with Joachim Murat, one of her brother’s generals, and they married on 20 January 1800. Caroline was seventeen years old. When Napoleon became Emperor, she and her sisters successfully asked to be made Imperial princesses. Caroline and Joachim were the parents of four children:\n\nAchille Charles Louis Napoléon Murat, 2nd Prince Murat (21 January 1801 – 5 April 1847)\n\nPrincess Marie Letizia Joséphine Annonciade Murat (26 April 1802 – 12 March 1859)\n\nLucien Charles Joseph Napoléon Murat, 2nd Sovereign Prince of Pontecorvo, 3rd Prince Murat (16 May 1803 – 10 April 1878)\n\nPrincess Louise Julie Caroline Murat (21 March 1805 – 1 December 1889)\n\nCaroline became Grand Duchess of Berg and Cleves on 15 March 1806 and Queen consort of Naples on 1 August 1808. As queen, Caroline renovated the royal residences in Naples and showed an interest in the archaeological discoveries of Pompeii and founded a school for girls.\n\nShe was described as intensely jealous of her sister-in-law Joséphine and her children. She was very much in favor of his divorce and second marriage to Empress Consort Marie Louise of Austria.\n\nThen, during the Hundred Days of 1815, Joachim came out for Napoleon. During his absence, Caroline was left as regent of Naples. Joachim was defeated and executed, and Caroline fled to the Austrian Empire. Whilst in exile, she adopted the title ‘Countess of Lipona’; ‘Lipona’ being an anagram of ‘Napoli’ (Naples).\n\nIn 1830, she married Francesco Macdonald, who had been Minister of War of the Kingdom of Naples in 1814 and 1815. She lived in Florence until her death in 1839. Caroline died in 1839 and was buried at the Chiesa di Ognissanti, in Florence.\n\nDo you want to know more about the Bonapartes?
