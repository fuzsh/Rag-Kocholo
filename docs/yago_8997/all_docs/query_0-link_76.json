        "text": "Hey, does anyone remember that bright young Bonaparte kid? Showed up out of nowhere, shot across Europe like a shooting star, had a great career ahead of him, and then BAM! Vanished. Anybody know what he’s up to these days?\n\nWell, he died of stomach cancer on a small South Atlantic island in 1821, and good riddance too, but his family is still around. Honestly, it’s pretty amazing. Napoleon was a dominant presence in European politics for less than two decades, and during that time virtually every member of his family managed to marry someone important. And while the family lost it’s political importance after 1871, its members remain embedded throughout the world. They’re like kudzu. Turn over any leaf or rock in the world and you’re likely to find a member of the House of Bonaparte or one of it’s associated families. There have been Bonaparte politicians and generals and Kings and scientists and artists and revolutionaries, in virtually every country in Europe and quite a few beyond. In this article, I’d like to continue the truly mammoth task of tracing these lines. Going through Napoleon himself and each of his siblings and children, I’ll trace the lines of descent to the present day (to the best of my ability) and note people of interest. Please note this is a non-exhaustive list, as many people are not important enough for any information to be available about them. So think of this as a highlights tour.\n\nShall we return?\n\nPrevious Installments: Part One and Part Two\n\nLucien Bonaparte (1775-1849)\n\nLike his elder brothers, Lucien was ambitious and talented. Unlike them, he was a man of principle. Whereas Napoleon viewed the French Revolution as nothing more than an opportunity, Lucien was an ardent Jacobin. According to some sources, it was Lucien’s fierce loyalty to Paris that led to the Bonaparte family being forced to flee Corsica after alienating Pasquale Paoli and the Corsican nobility. He rose to the presidency of the Council of Five Hundred, and was instrumental in the Coup of 18 Brumaire, which elevated Napoleon to the Consulship. Most famously, when the loyalty of the army was wavering, Lucien pointed a sword at his brother and swore he would kill him before allowing him to become a tyrant. In 1804, Napoleon declared himself Emperor and Lucien resigned all of his offices and went into exile in Italy. In 1809, under increasing pressure from the Emperor of the French to divorce his wife and marry a Spanish princess, he attempted to flee to the United States but was intercepted by a British warship. He spent the remainder of the war living quietly in England, and afterwards retired to Italy where he spent his last years conducting archeological excavations and writing his memoirs.\n\nLucien had thirteen children with two wives, so you will perhaps forgive me if I choose to limit our investigation to the six most interesting (i.e, the six with Wikapedia entries). From his first marriage, we gain Charlotte Bonaparte Gabrielli (1795-1865). Charlotte did not lead a particularly noteworthy life; she married an Italian prince, lived in Italy most of her life and was the patron of a number of literary and intellectual circles. Her villa in Rome is now the headquarters of the Pontifical North American College. She had eight children, most of whom do not enter the historical record, but her grandson Napoleone Parisani (1854-1932) was a successful and reasonably well-known landscape artist. Charlotte’s sister Christine Egypte (1798-1847) married Lord Dudley Stuart, a British Whig most known for his ardent support of Polish and Hungarian independence.\n\nWith his second wife, Lucien had ten children, four of whom warrant scrutiny. The eldest was Charles Lucien Bonaparte (1803-1857). An ornithologist and naturalist, Charles Lucien discovered the Mustached Warbler and the Wilson’s Storm Petrel and named the genus Zenaida, encompasing the mourning dove and it’s relatives. The name commemorated his wife Zénaïde Bonaparte, the daughter of his uncle Joseph Bonaparte. While living in America, Charles Lucien attempted, and failed, to get John James Audabon accepted as a member of the Academy of Natural Sciences. Eventually, he relocated to Rome where he wrote and lectured extensively on ornithology. That is, until, the Spring of Nations swept Europe in 1848 and the Pope was driven from Rome by popular unrest. When the Roman Republic was declared the following year, Charles Lucien showed that he had not forgotten the Jacobin principles of his father, and was elected as a member of the Roman Assembly. In July 1849, Louis Napoleon, newly elected President of France sent an army to crush the Republic and restore Papal rule. Charles Lucien fought in the defense of the city before going into exile in Britain when the war was lost. In 1850, he continued the Struggle against Tyranny on a more abstract plane, giving the newly-discovered Wilson’s Bird-of-Paradise the scientific name Cicinnurus respublica to protest the tradition of naming new species after kings, queens, and aristocrats. He dedicated the rest of his life to trying to assemble a methodical classification of the world’s birds, and died in Paris at the age of fifty-four.\n\nOf Charles Lucien’s twelve (!!!) children, only a few are worth discussing. His oldest son was Joseph Lucien Bonaparte (1824-1865), worth noting only because he inherited Lucien Bonaparte’s courtesy title of Prince of Canino and Musignano. He seems to have done absolutely nothing else of interest. His younger brother was Lucien Louis Joseph Napoleon (1828-1895). Ironically, given his father’s anti-clerical activities, Lucien Louis Joseph joined the priesthood in 1856, and was elevated to Cardinal in 1868. He participated in the First Vatican Council (i.e, the one that established Papal Infallibility), but I don’t know how he voted on any of the issues. Of their many sisters, the only one that seems to have attracted any notice whatsoever is Augusta Bonaparte Gabrielli (1836-1900). She had an illegitimate son with a Spanish nobleman, then married an Italian one. Her father named the Emerald Dove of the Nicobar Islands after her. Her marriage is only notable because it was attended by Louis Napoleon, now Emperor Napoleon III of France, who only a few years ago had driven her family out of Italy at bayonet-point. Bonaparte Family Relations: They’re Complicated. She lived most of her life in Rome, had no legitimate children, and did a lot of charity work. When she died she was buried in a chapel decorated by Napoleone Parisani, who we mentioned earlier.\n\nThe last of Charles Lucien’s children worth noting is Napoléon Charles Bonaparte (1839-1899). Unlike his revolutionary father and grandfather, he seems to have gone the convention Bonaparte route: He joined the army! Serving in the Imperial French Army he saw action in the Mexican Campaigns and the Franco-Prussian War; both disasters for France but I doubt it was his fault. He had three daughters, two of whom are very boring, one of whom is only notable because of her marriage. Eugenie Bonaparte (1872-1949), married Léon Napoléon Ney, Prince de la Moskowa in 1898. If the name is familiar, it’s because he was a direct descendant of Marshal Michel Ney, one of the original Napoleon’s most famous generals. Sadly, they were divorced in 1903.\n\nReturning back to our original Lucien Bonaparte now. While other Bonaparte lines either kept up the military tradition, were absorbed into the broader aristocratic milieu, or dabbled in politics, Lucien’s children all seem to have become scientists, revolutionaries, or both. Lucien’s third son, Louis Lucien Bonaparte (1813-1891) chose science. He was a professional philologist, most famous for classifying the various dialects of the Basque language. His system is still used today. After the Revolution of 1848, he briefly returned to France and served two terms in the Assembly before returning to London and his scientific work. He had a son, Louis Clovis Bonaparte (1859-1894), but I can’t find any information about him. Now, Louis Lucien’s older brother, Paul Marie Bonaparte (1809-1827), chose the Revolution, though he was not very successful at it. Like many intellectuals, he was deeply inspired by the Greek struggle for Independence. On August 24th, 1827, he arrived in the Ionian islands and boarded the Hellas, flagship of the Greek fleet. On September 6th, 1827, he shot himself by accident while cleaning his gun and died the following day.\n\nLast of Lucien’s sons, we have Pierre Napoléon Bonaparte (1815-1881). Another revolutinary, Pierre left home at age fifteen to fight with the Italian insurgency against Papal tyranny in the Romagna. He left Italy, traveled to America, then spent some time in South America hanging out with the Colombian war hero and President Francisco de Paula Santander. In 1835 he returned to Italy, was imprisoned by order of the Pope, and then fled into exile in Britain. Like many Bonapartes he returned to France after the Revolution of 1848 and was elected to the Assembly as a representative of Corsica. He took a hard-line Republican position, allying himself with the socialists. His support for Louis Napoleon in the presidential election that year helped solidify Leftist support for the Bonapartes. Until, of course, 1851 when Louis Napoleon decided to declare himself Emperor Napoleon III. Pierre supported his cousin and gained the title of Prince, the Republicans stopped supporting Pierre. To quote Wikipedia: “From that time on he led a debauched life, and lost all political importance”. Harsh.\n\nHis only other activity of note is that in 1869 he murdered someone under fairly confusing circumstances. You see (*deep breath*), the radical newspaper La Revanche ran some articles attacking the memory of Napoleon I and so Pierre Napoleon wrote an article calling the editors of La Revanche a pack of traitors and then the editor of La Marseillaise took offensive on behalf of the editors of La Revanche and challenged Pierre Napoleon to a duel and Pierre Napoleon, either through a miscommunication or an act of malice, informed the OWNER of La Marseillaise that he accepted the challenge from him (though he does not appear to have offered one) so when the editor of La Marseillaise sent his friends Victor Noir and Ulrich de Fonvielle to set up the duel Pierre said that he would fight the owner because the owner was an aristocrat but not the editor because the editor was a mere “menial” and Victor Noir took offensive at this so Pierre shot him dead. Anyways the court ruled it was self-defense. Pierre Napoléon Bonaparte died at Versailles in 1881.\n\nHe had two children. His daughter was named Jeanne Bonaparte (1861-1910). She was known for her interest in the occult and her skill as an artist and sculptor, but there’s not much information about her online. She had six children. Her younger brother was named Roland Bonaparte (1858-1924). Like so many of Lucien’s descendants, he chose a scientific path. In the 1880s, he participated in an expedition to northern Norway to study the Sami people. The small lake of Bonapartesjøen is named in his honor, as is Bonaparte Point in Antarctica. He served as president of the Société astronomique de France from 1921 to 1923 and president of the Société de géographie from 1910 until his death. His wife was the daughter of François Blanc, the casino entrepreneur who turned Monte Carlo into a world gambling center. They had only a single child, Princess Marie Bonaparte (1882-1962).\n\nNow, an unfortunate aspect of this project has been, I think, that I’ve been forced to focus mostly on Bonparte’s male descendants. Far too often, all I can find on his female grand-nieces and cousins are the names of those they married and the charities they sponsored. The richness and complexity of their lives was not recorded by history. Thankfully, Marie Bonaparte is an exception to this.\n\nMarie was raised mostly on isolated French estates while her father busied himself with scientific matters. It is recorded that she suffered from phobias and hypochondria as a child, which may perhaps help explain some of her latter obsessions. In 1907, she married Prince George of Greece and Denmark, the son of the Greek King George I. The marriage does not appear to have been particularly happy, and the couple spent much of their lives living apart, though they did have two children. Marie’s grandfather, the Casino King, left her an extraordinary fortune of 60 million francs, meaning that she had effectively total financial freedom to pursue her own interests. From the early 1920s onward, these tended to be psychological. In 1925, she met Sigmund Freud and struck up both a friendship and a professional relationship. She became a practicing psychoanalyst, a professional she maintained until her death, and in 1926 she founded the Société Psychoanalytique de Paris. She authored a number of books of her own, and also translated much of Freud’s work into French. Most famously, in 1938, when Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany, Princess Marie used her diplomatic status as a member of the Greek royal family and her vast wealth to help Freud escape. She was able to convince the gestapo to delay their search of Freud’s apartments until he had made his escape, bullied another German official into signing an exit visa for the elderly psychologist, and used the Greek diplomatic pouch to smuggle his savings and antiquities collection out of the country.\n\nIt is said that Freud’s famous remark that “The great question that has never been answered and which I have not yet been able to answer, despite my thirty years of research into the feminine soul, is ‘What does a woman want?'” was made to Princess Marie. I do not know what most women want. But it seems that what Princess Marie Bonaparte wanted was to have an orgasm. Marie was obsessed with her inability to achieve sexual satisfaction, and dedicated much of her scientific career to this. Her main theory was that the distance between her vagina and clitoris was too far, a conclusion she reached after conducting measurements of 243 other women. In 1924 she published these results under the pseudonym of A. E. Narjani in the medical journal Bruxelles-Médical. She also designed an operation to correct this, which she had preformed on herself twice. Despite this, the princess conducted a fairly legendary series of extramarital affairs. She slept with the French Prime Minister Aristide Briand between 1916 and 1919, leading to a number of theories about her seducing him in an effort to secure Allied support for Greece during WWI. At various other times she slept with Freud’s colleague, Rudolph Loewenstein, her husband’s aide-de-camp, and a “prominent married French physician”. There may well have been others. As I said, her marriage seems to have been rather strained. (It’s worth noting here that George is alleged to have been having a homosexual affair with his uncle Prince Valdemar of Denmark.) In 1919, she modeled for the Romanian sculptor Constantin Brâncuși, who’s resulting bronze sculpture, titled “Princess X“, resembled a very large penis. To quote Wikipedia: “This phallus symbolizes the model’s obsession with the penis and her lifelong quest to achieve vaginal orgasm”.\n\nIn her spare time, Marie Bonaparte also funded Géza Róheim’s anthropological expeditions to Australia and wrote a biography and interpretation of the work of Edgar Allen Poe. She died of leukemia in 1962.\n\nMarie had two children. Princess Eugénie (1910-1989) and Prince Peter (1908-1980). Both were raised mostly by their mother and by their granduncle Prince Valdemar, whom they supposedly refereed to as “Papa Two”. It has been alleged that due to all of this Peter developed an Oedipus complex and that Freud had to provide counseling for him. To be honest, I suspect the source for this is Freud himself and I am skeptical. Eugénie was not very interesting I’m afraid. She wrote a biography of the last Tsarevich entitled Le Tsarevitch, Enfant Martyr. She married a Polish aristocrat and army officer named Dominik Rainer Radziwiłł in 1939, divorced him, and married an Italian duke. She had three children, two of whom, Carlo Alessandro, Duke of Castel Duino (1952-?) and Princess Tatiana Radziwiłł (1939-?), are still alive and have children. But I can’t find anything about them.\n\nPeter decided to follow his mother’s footsteps into the sciences, becoming an accomplished anthropologist. In the 1930s he took a long journey into Southeast Asia, studying the peoples of Pakistan, South Indian, and Sri Lanka. His main academic focus was the study of polyandry, unsurprising, I suppose, given his family history. In 1939, he married a Russian divorcee named Irina Ovtchinnikova against his family’s wishes and was disinherited. When the Axis invaded Greece in 1941 he returned home and was (partially) reconciled with his family. He served his cousin, King George II, as aide-de-camp during the Crete campaign, and was then placed in charge of reorganizing the Greek Army in Egypt after the evacuation while the rest of the Greek royal family decamped to London. He served in the Western Desert campaign and the Allied invasions of Scily and Italy. However, he was kept under surveillance by his family throughout this time, who suspected his wife of being aligned with communist interests, and after the war he was forbidden to return to Greece.\n\nAfter the war Prince Peter continued his archeological researches, spending most of the period between 1949 and 1957 studying the Tibetan refugees now living in northern India as a result of the Chinese invasion of their homeland. His expedition only ended when the Chinese government pressured the Indian government into expelling him. Still, he was able to return home with a vast collection of notes, blood samples, anthropological data, books, artifacts, etc, most of which now reside in the National Museum of Denmark. After his return to Europe, Peter split his time between academic pursuits and meddling in Greek politics, which were a Godawful mess. The Greek Kingdom suffered from roiling succession disputes and crises, and Peter believed that his disinheritance was illegal and that he was the rightful heir. He continued this campaign without avail until the abolition of the monarchy and the proclamation of the Third Hellenic Republic in 1973. His academic pursuits were more successful. He wrote a thesis on polyandry at the London School of Economics, and served as president of the Nordic Council for Tibetan Assistance. In the 1970s, the People’s Republic of China allowed him to return to Tibet at last. He died of a brain hemorrhage in 1980. He had no children.\n\nJoin us next time for our exciting conclusion! We’ll examine the descendants of Jerome Bonaparte, the pretenders to the Throne!"
