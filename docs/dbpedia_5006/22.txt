Bill grew up in Memphis, TN and joined the Air Force after graduation. He served his country for 23 years. After retiring he worked in automotive service and ended his working career with Rochester Armored Car.

Bill enjoyed spending time with his family, working on his coin and two dollar bill collection, as well as spending time at the lake. He was also known to never turn down an opportunity to play a game of spades. His favorite thing, however, was playing with his grandchildren.
