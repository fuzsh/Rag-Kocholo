Bill Gray’s Regional Iceplex formerly known as The Sports Centre at MCC and The ESL Sports Centre, is a 2,500-seat multi-purpose arena. It was built in 1998. It was home to the Rochester Raiders indoor football team in the 2006 season. It is also home to four regulation size sheets of ice for semi-professional and youth hockey teams' use.

In 2013, Bill Gray's signed a 30-year agreement to take over sponsorship of the facility.

2012-08-23 09:37:58 I have been here to watch a few hockey games (Craig C games, and USA Jr team games). The place is alright. Only issue I have 2 times was parking but it was still nice to be close to the ice. I have read about how this place is having money issues. Hopefully this place can stay open as it is a good asset. —bonnev659

I've been playing here for 10+ years and I don't think the downstairs bathroom has been cleaned once, and the hot water has never worked. Most importantly, the ice is total sh*t, it's wavy like they let it freeze with a nice breeze flowing over it. Unfortunately it's the closest and most convenient rink to my house so I will continue to play there and complain about it. —PDub
