        "text": "Bill Gray’s Regional Iceplex will soon offer sports rehabilitation on site as phase 1 of a $2.2 million expansion plan gets underway at the Brighton facility.\n\nA new addition at the 170,000 square-foot complex, which hosts everything from hockey tournaments to train shows, will include a Lattimore Physical Therapy location with a sports rehab area, plus a fitness center, according to an Empire State Development release this week.\n\nThe 3,000 square-foot addition should be completed by the fall, said Iceplex general manager Chris Woodworth. Given the dreary, cold atmosphere of typical ice rinks, Woodworth and his team have been working in recent years to create a more welcoming scene at the Iceplex.\n\nTo that end, the addition of physical therapy and a gym onsite will allow athletes to access convenient care and parents to access the treadmills while their kids are playing hockey, said Woodworth.\n\n\"It's high end amenities — something that we focus on having for our customers,\" he said. \"It differentiates us in the world of participatory sports facilities.\"\n\nThe facility has already installed fiber optic WiFi, welcoming lobby seating and live streaming cameras on all four facility rinks.\n\nOut-of-town Iceplex attendees booked over 30,000 area hotel rooms in recent years and helped generate millions in direct visitor spending, according to a 2015 economic impact study done by Camoin Associates.\n\n\"Our community is really recognizing the fact that sports is a huge tourism boost for our region,\" said Woodworth.\n\nPhase 2 of the expansion plan will include energy efficiency upgrades, which could take several years to complete, he said.\n\nThe project was awarded a $700,000 grant from the Finger Lakes Regional Economic Development Council.\n\nSTADDEO@Gannett.com"
