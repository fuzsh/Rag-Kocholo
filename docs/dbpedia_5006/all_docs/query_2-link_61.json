The BC Pipeline has been the backbone of the province’s natural gas industry since 1957.\n\nEnbridge is proud to be working with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) on a project that would provide affordable and cleaner energy for the utility’s customers.\n\nWe are proposing to design, construct and operate the Ridgeline Expansion Project (Ridgeline), an expansion of Enbridge’s existing East Tennessee Natural Gas (ETNG) system.\n\nWestcoast Energy, an Enbridge company, is proposing an expansion of the T-South section of its BC Pipeline to serve growing regional demand for natural gas and potential West Coast LNG exports.\n\nThe Project will provide up to 300 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of additional natural gas transportation capacity on T-South. The BC Pipeline has been the backbone of the province’s natural gas industry since 1957.\n\nWoodfibre LNG will help reduce the world’s greenhouse gas emissions by expanding global access to natural gas, displacing coal in power generation.\n\nThis 2.1 million-tonne-per-year LNG export facility will have 250,000 m3 of floating storage capacity and be based near Squamish, BC."
