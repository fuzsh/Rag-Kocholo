Bill is the second-generation owner of Gray Ridge Egg Farms, one of the largest farm-to-table egg companies in Ontario. The Gray’s know first-hand how vitally important mobility and activity can be, and responded in kind providing a $7.5 million gift to St. Joseph’s to establish The Gray Centre and continue their family's more than 80-year legacy of community support and philanthropy.\n\n“We’re delighted that our philanthropic investment is being utilized for both frontline patient care today, and research efforts that will continue to transform care in the future,” says Bill Gray. “Compromised physical mobility and activity adversely affects the well-being of many, many people, and we’re very pleased to help support the advancement of care that can help so many people.”"
