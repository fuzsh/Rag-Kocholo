        "text": "This past weekend I had the privilege of traveling to the USA Olympic Marathon Trials with many of the Run Elite Program (REP) athletes that I work with as an Intermountain Health Physical Therapist who were racing to earn a spot on the USA Olympic Team that will be competing in the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. What an amazing weekend it was! With eight REP athletes competing, two of them finished in the top three spots and punched their tickets to the Paris Summer Olympics! Conner Mantz (Nike) and Clayton Young (ASICS Corporation) took home Gold and Silver in incredible fashion. To say that was one of the best moments of my career in physical therapy is an understatement. As a witness to what goes on behind the scenes in order for these two amazing athletes to accomplish what they just did is remarkable. When they crossed the finish line together in 1st and 2nd, it was so symbolic of everything they did to get there. These athletes ran 120+ miles each week, they were dedicated to their strength and conditioning, they prioritized their recovery in the form of sleep, nutrition and physical therapy, they pushed through extremely difficult workouts, they worked on fortifying their mental health and ultimately they sacrificed so much to live an ELITE lifestyle to make sure they were able to perform better than anyone else they toed the line against. Being able to work with these athletes each week in the clinic is a honor and privilege I do not take lightly. I am so proud of the entire REP team for what they achieved this weekend and what they continue to do on and off the track and marathon course. More than being extremely fast runners, they are also amazing PEOPLE. As all of these athletes continue to train and compete at the worlds highest stages, make sure to keep an eye out for what they will accomplish! #running #physicaltherapy #sportsmedicine #healthcare #marathon #olympics #olympicgames #olympics2024 #paris2024 #intermountainhealth #nike #asics #runeliteprogram #utah #usa Intermountain Health Run Elite Program"
