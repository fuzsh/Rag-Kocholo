        "text": "During his 20-year career as an ice hockey official, Chris Woodworth was selected to work top international tournaments, including the World Junior Championship in Calgary in 2012, the World Senior Championship in Sweden in 2013 and the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia in 2014.\n\nHe holds the World Junior event for players under age 20 as his most memorable.\n\n“It was the best hockey I’ve ever seen in my life,’’ said the Canandaigua native who officiated 10 seasons in the American Hockey League. “I hold that event higher than even officiating in the Olympics which I was lucky enough to do also. It was wild. These kids skate their tails off every single night.’’\n\nWith the WJC being a showcase for each year’s NHL draft, it’s easy to understand why.\n\nAnd now some of that talent is headed to Rochester for final preparations for the IIHF World Junior Championship taking place Dec. 26-Jan. 5 in Buffalo.\n\nRussia, Slovakia and Denmark will each conduct nine-day, pre-tournament camps at Bill Gray’s Regional Iceplex with practices starting Saturday, Dec. 16. (Check the Iceplex website for a practice schedule).\n\nThe teams will also play a series of exhibition games while being housed at the Marriott Airport in Greece and the Double Tree Inn in Henrietta. Team Sweden will also be here for one tuneup game.\n\n“We’re beyond excited and we’re also very fortunate,’’ said Woodworth, Iceplex general manager. “You’ll have these high-level players, potential top draft picks, all around the facility for more than a week. It’s a great opportunity for kids to see the future of hockey, for coaches to watch some drills, and then you have the international flare to it. It’s going to be special for anybody who loves hockey to be around the rink.’’\n\nFans could be treated to watching the current No. 1 and 2 ranked players for the 2018 NHL Draft in Rochester.\n\nRasmus Dahlin, 17, a 6-foot-2, 181-pound defenseman for Sweden will likely be in the lineup when his team travels to Rochester to face Denmark at 7 p.m. Monday, Dec. 18. Dahlin, who was good enough to play in the WJC at 16, has been called the next Erik Karlsson.\n\n\"He's a smart, two-way defenseman; an excellent skater and puck-handler,\" Goran Stubb, NHL director of European scouting, told NHL.com. \"He loves to join the rush and does not shy away from the physical part of the game. As it looks right now, he will likely be the No. 1 player.’’\n\nMeanwhile, Russian forward Andrei Svechnikov, 17, is projected as the No. 2 overall pick. In addition to practicing daily at Bill Gray’s, his team is scheduled for two exhibition games – 7 p.m., Dec. 20 vs. Denmark and 4 p.m., Dec. 23 vs. Slovakia.\n\nThe 6-2 Svechnikov, who had 17 points in 13 games for Barrie of the OHL, is recovering from a broken hand suffered in October that required surgery.\n\nThe WJC is one of the most anticipated events on the hockey calendar. Competing teams this year are defending champion USA, Canada, Denmark, Slovakia and Finland in Group A and Russia, Sweden, Czech Republic, Switzerland and Belarus in Group B.\n\nBuffalo (2011) is the first U.S. city to play host for a second time. Numerous players in the Sabres organization have taken part in the WJC, including Jack Eichel (USA), Josh Gorges (Canada), Evander Kane (Canada), Johan Larsson (Sweden), Robin Lehner (Sweden), Alexander Nylander (Sweden), Kyle Okposo (USA), Sam Reinhart (Canada), Rasmus Ristolainen (Finland) and Rochester Americans star goaltender Linus Ullmark (Sweden).\n\n“Here in the states people don’t understand the magnitude of the World Juniors,’’ Woodworth said. “In Canada, it’s a nine-day national holiday it’s so heavily followed.’’\n\nTeams are holding pre-event camps around western New York, including Buffalo’s Harbor Center (USA), Jamestown, Lockport as well as Erie, Pennsylvania. Bill Gray’s is the only facility hosting more than one team, a coup for the facility that not long ago had fallen into physical and financial disarray.\n\nEnd 2 End Sports management, which took over in April 2013, has invested $5 million in infrastructure, locker room, training, fan amenities and retail space upgrades, Woodworth said. A 3,000-square foot addition, phase 1 of a $2.2-million expansion, is adding space for Lattimore Physical Therapy sports rehab and a fitness center scheduled to open Feb. 1. Energy efficiency upgrades are in the pipeline.\n\nRecognizing what the four-rink facility means to generating economic activity, mainly through youth hockey games and tournaments, the project received a $700,000 grant from the Finger Lakes Regional Economic Development Council.\n\nWithout the improvements, getting back on the radar of USA Hockey as a capable host of major events would have been impossible, Woodworth said.\n\n“We’re fortunate to have the space we do to host three teams (for the WJC),’’ said Woodworth, who maintains strong USA Hockey ties through his officiating circles. “Five years ago, we probably had no chance of getting something like this. We hope this leads to something more. They run the Four Nations, Six Nations, some of those cups and exhibitions for all the national teams every season so we’re hoping to do more of this in the future.’’\n\nLROTH@Gannett.com\n\nWorld Junior Hockey\n\nLattimore Arena at Bill Gray’s Regional Iceplex will host exhibition games leading up to the World Junior Championship in Buffalo, Dec. 26-Jan. 5. General admission is $5 online or at the door. The schedule:"
