        "text": "The not-for-profit organization operating Bill Gray’s Regional Iceplex claims the facility’s naming rights’ holder and concessionaire owes more than $300,000 in rent, sponsorship fees and advertising dues.\n\nIn a complaint filed Friday in state Supreme Court in Monroe County, the Monroe Community Sports Centre Corp. alleges Bill Gray’s, Inc., hasn’t paid monthly rent for the bar, restaurant and snack bar since June 2019 and hasn’t paid monthly naming rights fees since October 2019.\n\nBill Gray’s, Inc., has operated the bar and restaurant at the four-pad ice complex since 2012 and bought naming rights for the facility in April 2013 for up to 30 years.\n\nIn return for the name Bill Gray’s Regional Iceplex on the exterior and interior of the building as well as the website and all communications, the Webster-based restaurant chain agreed to pay $50,000 a year, as well as a $15,000 annual advertising credit, court papers say.\n\nThe complaint, prepared by Richard Bell Jr. of Adams Leclair LLP, claims Bill Gray’s now owes $163,469.32 in minimum monthly rent, plus $154,166.67 in sponsorships fees and interest.\n\nThe alleged balance for back rent is based on monthly rent requirements, which increased annually by approximately $80 per month, court documents show. The current rent for the period of July 2022 through June 2023 is $4,231.96. A portion of the nonpayment of rent includes parts of 2020 and 2021, when the state mandated the shutdown of restaurants and recreational facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe contract also calls for an additional rent payment of 6 percent of gross annual sales over $700,000, and court papers allege the concessionaire has not provided financial reports for recent years.\n\nThe multi-purpose recreational facility opened in 1998 as the ESL Sports Centre, and ESL Federal Credit Union held naming rights through 2009. From the end of the original naming rights deal until Bill Gray’s became the title sponsor, the facility within the Monroe Community College property at 2700 Brighton-Henrietta Townline Rd. was known as the Sports Centre at MCC.\n\nBill Gray’s Regional Iceplex will be home to nearly two dozen hockey tournaments featuring 1,000 teams during the 2022-23 season. In October, 25 girls from across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic participated in a three-day tournament that generated around $550,000 in direct visitor spending and nearly $400,000 in indirect spending, based on the Destinations International Economic Impact Calculator.\n\nFounded in 1938, Bill Gray’s now operates 14 restaurants in the Rochester area, including the restaurant and Tap Room at the sports center.\n\nd"
