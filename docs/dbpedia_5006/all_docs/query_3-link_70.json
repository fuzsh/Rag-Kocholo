        "text": "Watching the Chiefs and 49ers play in the Super Bowl last weekend got me thinking: What makes an exceptional organization? There are lots of variables and constants to that equation, but I believe there are five constants that apply to sports teams, the military, or any civilian company. 1. It starts with people of differing levels of skill/talent/experience (variable) -or- exceptional people (constant) 2. To perform a function or job (variable) -or- mission with meaning (constant) 3. Under the direction of someone in charge (variable) -or- an outstanding coach/leader with vision (constant) 4. That creates an organizational perspective ranging from contempt to apathy (variable) -or- enthusiasm/winning attitude (constant) 5. And results in either a poor/mediocre culture (variable) -or- great culture (constant) Exceptional people are key. There are hundreds of very, very good football players who are not good enough to make it into the National Football League. Only the highest level of athlete is capable of being invited to play in the NFL, even if to sit deep on the bench. Brock Purdy is the perfect example. He was selected by the 49ers with the 262nd and final pick of the 2022 NFL Draft to start his professional career as a third-string quarterback. He barely made the cut, but he made it—to ride the bench. Yet, he led his team to the Super Bowl. Exceptional organizations in the civilian world are no different. I’ve been a part of many teams over 29 years in the military. I’ve been a member of good units and not so good. I’ve served with some exceptional people and not so exceptional. I’ve seen good leadership and leadership I wouldn’t wish on the hardest felons. I say all that to say this: in my 30 years since graduating from college, I have never served with the quality and character of people I work with now. The talent across the board—I mean every single individual—is eye watering. That includes the half of the company comprised of tech and data experts, most of whom have never served in the military. I’m proud to be on their team and work with them every day. The leadership of SteerBridge believe the most important decisions they make are who they hire. They will only invite the absolutely most talented to interview. They then consider the candidate’s character and if they will fit into the SteerBridge culture. The bar is very high, and most don’t make it over. Those who do want to stay. Now I know what it’s like to be part of an “invitation-only” unit (for Navy and Marine Corps pilots, think MAWTS-1 or Top Gun). You will find the rest of the constants above at SteerBridge. Some of our young, new teammates have never known anything different and think this is just the way most workplaces are. Those of us who have been around the block a few times recognize just how special this place is. Today marks my 1-year anniversary at SteerBridge. Today marks my 1-year anniversary at an exceptional organization!"
