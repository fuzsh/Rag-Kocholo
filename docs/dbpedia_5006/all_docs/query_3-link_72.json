        "text": "William “Bill” Andrew Gray\n\nOctober 22, 1954 – July 26, 2021\n\nOn Monday, July 26th William “Bill” Andrew Gray went to be with the Lord. his Savior after suffering complications from Covid-19.\n\nA lifelong Central Florida resident, Bill recently retired from Taylor Pharmacy in Winter Park, where he worked as a pharmacist. His life was spent serving the needs of others through medicine. First at his Dad’s store, Silver Star Pharmacy. And later on at other pharmacies throughout Central Florida.\n\nA graduate of the University of Florida, Bill was a life-long Gator fan. He found great joy in teasing his friends faithful to the other Florida college.\n\nHe was also an avid fisherman. Any time he was free you would find him on the lake casting for his next fish.\n\nAs on the lake, so also in his life. He opened up about his love for Jesus to anyone who would listen. Casting his testimony out to others in their time of need to help pull them into the safety of Christ’s love for them.\n\nHe was a faithful husband to Sherry for 42 years.\n\nHe was a faithful father to Tim (Carolyn) and Amy (Chris) McKelvey for 40 years.\n\nHe was a faithful Papa to his grandchildren: Peyton, Riley and Jackson McKelvey, and to Tanner and Jacob Gray. These five children were the joy of his life; he attended every sport event in which they participated with excitement and enthusiasm. He loved nothing more than being their greatest fan. Papa’s lap was the preferred seat wherever they gathered.\n\nHe was a faithful brother to his sisters Bettie (Dennis) Jackson of Gainesville, and Debi (Tom) Walter of Orlando, his brother Stan (Terry) Wade of Umatilla, and his brother-in-law Terry Newmons of Apopka.\n\nHe was a faithful Uncle to Jason (Ashley), Tracy Lytle (Seth), Heather Aznaran (Matt), Mitzi Nielson (Drew) and PJ (Kiersten) Jackson.\n\nA faithful friend, he was loved by all who knew him, as he loved them in return.\n\nBill and Sherry were members at Grace Church in Orlando where he led a home group of couples also seeking to know Jesus more.\n\nBill is preceded in glory by his Father, Stanley E. Gray and his Mother, Leota Gray.\n\nA virtual service will be held on Saturday morning at 10a. Details will be announced on Bill Gray’s Facebook page."
