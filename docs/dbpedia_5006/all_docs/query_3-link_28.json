        "text": "Nov. 3, 2003\n\nBIRMINGHAM, Ala - The Samford football team begins preparations for a critical Ohio Valley Conference rivalry game Monday night with a workout at Seibert Stadium. The Bulldogs and Gamecocks will kickoff at 1:00 p.m. in Seibert Stadium in a game that matches two of the top three teams in the OVC.\n\nQ&A With Head Coach Bill Gray:\n\nWhy did you wear blue uniforms against Tennessee Tech?\n\n\"Their head coach wanted to start a tradition over there with wearing white on Homecoming, so he asked if we didn't mind. I had been waiting for an opportunity to bust out those blue uniforms. Once he said that they wanted to wear white, there was no question what we were going to wear when we got up there. Last time we beat Tennessee Tech we wore blue and I just wanted to do something to spark the team a little bit. When they walked in from pregame warm-ups and saw the blue uniforms in their lockers it was neat to see their expressions. I don't know if we are going to see them again or not, it will be a wait and see decision. We play pretty good in red, but I am sure they might be busted out again at the opportune time.\"\n\nOssie Buchannon had a breakout game on Saturday. What impact has he had this season?\n\n\"He is continuing to play well for us. Against Tennessee Tech he caught a little hitch and ran through tackles because he is so strong and also has the speed to go the distance. We need him to continue to play like this to take some pressure off of Efrem (Hill) and balance up the defense a little bit. We always thought that he could play like this, but he has been struggling with injuries ever since he has been here. He is healthy this year, and you can really tell by his performance on the field.\"\n\nIt is Jacksonville State week and this time the game means a little more, with a conference championship on the line. What do you see in this game?\n\n\"It is Jacksonville State week and that is all that you have to say. A lot of these guys went to schools as teammates in high school, we recruit some of the same people and now that we are in the same conference it adds a little more luster to the rivalry. They are coming in leading the OVC and we are playing to stay alive in the conference race. You can't ask for any more reason to go out and play hard. My concern as a head coach is to make sure that we wait until Saturday to peak, because I am sure that they are ready to get after them tonight.\"\n\nIt will be the last time that the seniors play at home. What impact have they had on Samford University?\n\n\"Those guys have been through a lot as a class. They have been through a coaching change and through some down times. I am very proud of what they have done; they are great leaders for the younger guys that will be taking over the program the next few years. Everyone of the guys is special in his own way. Many coaches can sometimes say that about a group, but these guys really are special. A majority of the seniors have spent most of their time here in back-up positions, but they have endured and their leadership has been great, both on the field and off. They can all look back and say that they were the first OVC team, the first team to win an OVC football game, and hopefully the first group of seniors to win an OVC Championship ring.\""
