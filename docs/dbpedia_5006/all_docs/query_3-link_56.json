        "text": "Ten individuals were inducted into the George Stevens Academy Sports Hall of Fame at a ceremony in late May.\n\nAfter Head of School Tim Seeley welcomed the athletes, Bill Gray ’83 introduced Steve Bemiss Jr., who accepted the honor on behalf of his father, who passed away in 2020. Steve Sr. was best known as the GSA girls’ soccer coach, though he also coached girls’ basketball and track. In his first decade, he led the varsity girls to four regional soccer championships (2000, 2001, 2004, 2006). In 2000, Steve Jr. recounted, the team had a losing regular season. The team stuck with Steve Sr.’s advice to “focus on the process,” not the wins and losses, and they made it all the way to states by beating one favored team after another.\n\nThe second inductee, Nikki (Allen) Capone ’00, was introduced by her father, Don Allen ’76. Nikki competed in softball, track, and soccer at GSA, but she is best known for her four seasons of varsity basketball, during which she scored 1,210 points. Her success, she said, is due to her family, teammates, and coaches, without whom she would not be here today. It also may have been that her father was the coach and had a key to the gym. For years, Nikki said, she took “500 shots at the gym every day, but maybe got Christmas off.”\n\nFormer cross-country coach Tim Farrar introduced Catherine Galipeau ’94, a standout runner in cross country and indoor track who placed third in the state in cross country, set the state record when she won the two-mile state championship, and went on to compete nationally. Catherine, who accepted the honor via video recording, said that participating in sports set her up for success in life. She also emphasized the importance of lifelong fitness.\n\nThe fourth inductee, Owen Gilmore ’04, was introduced by Athletic Director Larry Gray ’79, who was Owen’s tennis coach. The team could count on Owen to win, Larry said, and Owen did just that at every match right up to the state championship his senior year, the only GSA tennis state championship. Owen said that the baseball team also won at states that year, and Class Night was delayed as everyone waited for both teams to return to the school for their senior celebration.\n\nLarry Gray also introduced Bill Gray ’83, who was inducted into the Sports Hall of Fame for his contributions as an athlete, coach, and groundskeeper. In his moving remarks, Bill acknowledged the “wise support of Dwight Webber” and noted the impact of many others in the room on his development as a coach. “You can have an impact on more people than you know,” he said.\n\nDan Kane then introduced Collin Henry ’06, who played soccer and basketball but is best known for his success on the baseball field. Among other accomplishments, Collin helped lead his team to back-to-back state championships and received the Maine Mr. Baseball award, given to the top player in the state. In his remarks, he thanked “the players who maybe weren’t the stars of the team but who stepped up in important moments.” Collin also said that now that he lives in Southern Maine, he is much more aware of the advantages he had growing up in a small community and attending a small high school like GSA.\n\nMatt Mattson ’91 then introduced by video the next inductee, Nick Henry ’03, who played on the soccer, baseball, and basketball teams. Nick helped bring home state championships in baseball and basketball his senior year. “It was never about me,” Nick told the audience, “it was always about the team and what we were trying to accomplish.” He credited much of his success to his family, coaches, and Jesus Christ.\n\nLarry Gray introduced Forrest A. Horton ’61, a standout runner who won the state mile and state cross-country races, among others. “I loved my Naval career, but Millbrook Farm, scouting, 4-H, church, GSA, and family were all absolutely foundational” to his success, Forrest said in recorded remarks. He also challenged the others to “polish your own GSA stories, to share those stories with everyone you know and let them know why you support George Stevens Academy, then build your own GSA legacy. The need for more believers, doers, and donors is greater than it has ever been.”\n\nDwayne Carter ’80 introduced Matt Mattson ’91, who scored 1,396 points while on the basketball team at GSA. Matt also played baseball and soccer. Later on, Matt coached basketball at GSA at all three levels from 1998 to 2020 and was part of state championships in 2003, 2016, 2017, and 2018. Dwayne said that Matt’s “passion for the game when he played and his passion for the game when he coached was incredible.” In his video acceptance, Matt remarked on the hundreds of athletes he coached over the years and the relationships he built with them. “I cherish those relationships much more than I cherish the winning or losing,” he said.\n\nThe final inductee, Misha Mytar ’98, was introduced by Tim Farrar, the then and current coach of girls’ varsity tennis, a sport at which Misha excelled. “We knew when we showed up [at a five-set match],” Tim said, that Misha’s win was a given and that we only had to win two of the remaining four sets to take the match.” He also noted that Misha was “also willing to help the other players on the team.”\n\nCongratulations to all the inductees!"
