        "text": "Why do you support Urbana Parks?\n\nOur family supports the Urbana Park District and Urbana Parks Foundation because of all it has to offer. We moved to Urbana in 1993, and at the time our children were six and three years old. Over the years our family has participated in many programs particularly sports like soccer, basketball, dance, and we annually bought a Crystal Lake pool pass to swim and dive.\n\nI recall my son and I helped to build the Meadowbrook playground wood structure. To this day we enjoy regular visits to Meadowbrook Park to meet friends, picnic, walk and ride bikes. My daughter found the youth summer theatre productions to be the perfect place to develop her interest, hone her talents and have a great time meeting others with similar interest.\n\nUrbana parks hosted some of our birthday parties too. One memorable birthday was at Anita Purves Nature Center. The park staff showed my son and his friends all the bugs and tadpoles in the water and animals and birds in the woods. Another birthday gathering was at Blair Park for my 50th.\n\nOther activities that are favorites of ours include neighborhood nights that moves to various parks around our city, the tot lot playground at Sunnycrest, the disc golf course at Lohmann Park and hoorah for the Kickapoo Rail Trail!\n\nWhat makes you excited for the future of Urbana Parks?\n\nThe beautification of Crystal Lake Park rises to the top for me. This park is such a hidden gem in our community. I am also very excited for the opportunity to be involved with the possibility of a new wellness center. If the grant is received the foundation would certainly be activated into fund raising for a beautiful new facility."
