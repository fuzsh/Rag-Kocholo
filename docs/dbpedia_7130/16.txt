Europe: Abandoned Buildings

" As far as I can remember, I have always been fascinated by abandoned places, so there’s no surprise that after a few childhood explorations, I decided to take a camera with me to bring back memories of my trips. I started giving more and more importance to the place I was shooting, to get the satisfaction of perfectly capturing the spirit of the spot I was visiting. It has been nearly three years now that I have travelledromainveillon around Europe, to find and capture these amazing locations. From communist relics in Bulgaria or Hungary to the incredible villas and palaces in Italy, passing by the tremendous factories and power plants in France or Belgium, I try to grasp the aesthetic beauty that emerges from the chaos of decay. I love when nature takes over human constructions which creates a unique and unreal atmosphere. It puts in perspective our presence on earth and reminds us that we are only passers-by. For me, it’s like traveling in time. Every room is special and has its own history."

Portugal: Chow down Vegan Style in Lisbon

Lisbon is a lively, friendly, beautiful city and we loved our time there. We were especially amazed at how easy it was to be vegan i

Ursula O'Reilly Traynor's insight:

Lots of European cities are recognizing the need to offer much more in the way of Vegan and Vegetarian eating options. Recently, Turin's mayor has declared the city Vegetarian, with a five year plan. Majorca wants to be the Vegan Island Capital of Europe. and now Lisbon is declaring its interest and delight in all things Vegan. I love this progressive attitude, especially as so many young travellers favour the vegan way of life. Nice one, Lisbon.
