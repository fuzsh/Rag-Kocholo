        "text": "USA: Cindy Chinn Carves Miniature Trains Out of Carpenter Pencils\n\nWith a steady hand and very sharp knife, artist Cindy Chinn turns everyday carpenter pencils into works of art.\n\nUrsula O'Reilly Traynor's insight:\n\nI want!\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nTiny Living in a Cardboard Box? It Looks Better Than It Sounds\n\nDutch design studio Friction Factory recently unveiled the Wikkelhouse, a gabled structure constructed from 24 layers of cardboard. And it actually looks quite nice.\n\n↧\n\nUK: Brighton Fringe\n\nTickets are now on sale! Browse over 900 events - from cabaret to comedy, theatre to dance, there's something for everyone!\n\nUrsula O'Reilly Traynor's insight:\n\nBrighton never disappoints and is especially lively during the annual Brighton Festival with its ever growing and insanely popular fringe festival. Get there before it disappears for another year! Sun highly possible, fun guaranteed.\n\n↧\n\nCzech Republic: A Rotating 42-Layer Sculpture of Franz Kafka's Head by David Cerny\n\n\"Located in a busy shopping center in Prague, this twisting and reflective sculpture depicting the head of writer Franz Kafka is the latest kinetic artwork by controversial Czech artist David Cerny\"\n\nUrsula O'Reilly Traynor's insight:\n\nDefinitely going to turn heads!\n\n↧\n\nGuatemala : Visiting The Craft Markets of Chichi (Chichicastenango)\n\nUrsula O'Reilly Traynor's insight:\n\nLondon blogger Momtaz Begum-Hossain gives a colourful and detailed account of her visit to the craft markets of Guatemala. Full of charming insights and atmospheric photographs. Do take a looksee!\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nInternational: Photographer Karen Knorr\n\n\"Karen Knorr was born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany and was raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico in the 1960s. She finished her education in Paris and London.\"\n\nUrsula O'Reilly Traynor's insight:\n\nWe love the work of Karen Knorr. Read about this photographer and view her contemplative, considered compositions on her beautiful website : www.karenknorr.com\n\n↧\n\nIceland: 19th century green-roofed church is straight out of a fairy tale\n\nAlthough sod-topped structures may seem like they're straight out of a movie, the fascinating earthen-enclosed Hofskirkja church was built in 1884.\n\n↧\n\nEurope: Abandoned Buildings\n\n\" As far as I can remember, I have always been fascinated by abandoned places, so there’s no surprise that after a few childhood explorations, I decided to take a camera with me to bring back memories of my trips. I started giving more and more importance to the place I was shooting, to get the satisfaction of perfectly capturing the spirit of the spot I was visiting. It has been nearly three years now that I have travelledromainveillon around Europe, to find and capture these amazing locations. From communist relics in Bulgaria or Hungary to the incredible villas and palaces in Italy, passing by the tremendous factories and power plants in France or Belgium, I try to grasp the aesthetic beauty that emerges from the chaos of decay. I love when nature takes over human constructions which creates a unique and unreal atmosphere. It puts in perspective our presence on earth and reminds us that we are only passers-by. For me, it’s like traveling in time. Every room is special and has its own history.\"\n\nPhotographs credited to Romain Veillon.\n\nUrsula O'Reilly Traynor's insight:\n\nAtmospheric, sometimes eerie photographs depicting Europe's decaying buildings..\n\n(With thanks to fellow scoopiteer Laura Brown, for the suggestion)\n\n↧\n\nPortugal: Chow down Vegan Style in Lisbon\n\nLisbon is a lively, friendly, beautiful city and we loved our time there. We were especially amazed at how easy it was to be vegan i\n\nUrsula O'Reilly Traynor's insight:\n\nLots of European cities are recognizing the need to offer much more in the way of Vegan and Vegetarian eating options. Recently, Turin's mayor has declared the city Vegetarian, with a five year plan. Majorca wants to be the Vegan Island Capital of Europe. and now Lisbon is declaring its interest and delight in all things Vegan. I love this progressive attitude, especially as so many young travellers favour the vegan way of life. Nice one, Lisbon.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nThe Fantastic Street Art by Kislow\n\nThis Ukrainian artist is as original as it gets. Just randomly found his pieces. But how good are they? http://www.lostateminor.com/2012/10/16/ukrainian-street-art-by-kislow/\n\nUrsula O'Reilly Traynor's insight:\n\nit's great to stumble upon something new and exciting. In this case it's street art from the Ukraine.\n\n↧"
