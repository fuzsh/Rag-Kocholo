        "text": "There’s this ‘thing’ in the social media world where you’re supposed to find your tribe. But IRL (In real life) and in the online sphere I’ve never felt like I’ve belonged to a group, a niche or a tribe. I’m individual. Which has its good and bad moments. Some days I feel amazing, ruling the streets with my idiosyncratic style and other days I walk into a room and it feels as though everyone pities me and is thanking god they aren’t me.\n\nSo turning up to yesterday’s Colour Walk was a total revelation. I felt accepted, finally. I’ll explain why shortly, but first have a scroll through these outfits I came across at the event…a mere sample of the incredible artistry on display at the Old Spitalfields Market Colour Walk.\n\nIt’s nigh impossible to pick out a favourite, everyone had curated a look that signified something about them and that therein lies the beauty of fashion: wearing what makes YOU feel good.\n\nIn my mind I assumed I’d turn up and discover a clique of people who all looked amazing but were probably so tight as a group they’d be chatting away with in-jokes and me a newcomer would be there smiling but feeling very awkward. I could not have been more wrong.\n\nThe event, spearheaded by artist and fashion designers Sue Kreitzman, Sophie Cochevelou and Florent Bidois was a hive of activity when I arrived. And I felt immediately welcome. Everyone was chatting to eachother, welcoming new faces, telling everyone how amazing they looked and lots of cameras were flashing. Breaking into conversation was so easy. It wasn’t like all those horrific networking events where you find yourself in a room wondering who to make eye contact with and who to tag onto – this was a gathering of artists, creatives, lovers and appreciators of fashion and personal sense of style.\n\nEvery single person I spoke to had a genuine interest in me asking about every outfit detail, where things were from, commenting how well thought out the whole ensemble was, every detail was appreciated and it felt amazing. It was also a very different feeling to when random strangers in the street mention what I’m wearing, sometimes that’s nice other times it feels uncomfortable. People call me ‘colourful’ and ‘colour queen’ all the time most just think it’s costume, but not here.\n\nAt the event Sue gave a speech where she reiterated that the event and colour walk was people being normal and being themselves that it’s ‘just us’ and it was so poignant. I wear colour because colour fuels my energy and strength. On cold grey days (and we’ve had a lot in London lately) wearing colour is my fuel for living. To some I look like a clown or a novelty, or I’m dressing to young or too weird but at the Colour Walk everyone was ‘normal.’\n\nIt made me question all the other times I’ve tried and failed to fit into a tribe – I’m not a typical travel blogger, I’ve often felt rejected from the craft world, I don’t attract much of a South Asian following, I don’t fit into ‘alternative’ categories, I’m too old to fit in with Millenials, too young to use the hashtag #advancedstyle….but here in an East London market surrounded by likeminded rainbow hued souls I felt I’d found my place.\n\nSo thank you to each and every single person who stopped to chat to me and made me feel so welcome. If I have to pick a tribe to align myself to it’s this one – Colour Lovers of London. I am with you.\n\nThe Colour Walks take place monthly in Old Spitalfield Market, East London.\n\nTo find out when they are get in touch with Florent.\n\nMore pics from the event below. Enjoy!\n\nI’m so clueless about t-shirts that it wasn’t until I went on a tour of the new T-Shirt: Cult – Culture – Subversion exhibition that opened this week at The Fashion & Textile Museum in London that I realised they are ‘T shaped.’ I mean how can I be a fashion fan and not know that? Seriously that bit of knowledge completely passed me by, but maybe it’s because in truth I have absolutely no interest in t–shirts.\n\nI don’t own any other than a couple from my youth (three band t-shirts which I didn’t actually wear, I bought them as memorabilia). You won’t even find me wearing them at the gym, I opt for vests, and when I’ve ever been in a situation where I’ve been told to wear one as a uniform, I tend to revolt. That said I did once teach a how to customise a t-shirt workshop but then again, the object of the session was to transform them as much as possible from their original form. So when I heard about this exhibition I wanted to go because I realised this was my opportunity to get a better understanding of what this most common of, casual garment is all about. And while I have in no way converted, I have a new found respect for the humble tee…\n\nThe exhibition ends on a ‘plain white t-shirt’ (I don’t even own one of them) but before you get there, there’s another 100 tees to look through spanning 50 years, sourced from the archives of artists, fans and collectors. It’s not a definitive history (t-shirt shaped garments are thought to be one of the earliest ‘fashioned’ items of clothing worn in as early as the 5th century – now there’s a fashion fact for you.) But what you will find is 11 distinct sections considered ‘milestones’ in t-shirt evolution.\n\n‘The earliest t-shirt shaped garments can be traced back to the 5th century’\n\nThese include techniques such as screen-printing which opened up the ability to make them on bigger scales, band t-shirts which although are now considered a fan item actually originated as the uniform of the roadies and crew and political tees – and there’s me thinking they all came under the heading ‘slogan tees’, there’s so much more to them than that. The message you wear can broadcast a social, political or even musical message and if you truly want to broadcast with todays tech you can, there’s an LED t-shirt on display which can even display live Tweets.\n\nOne of the things that is fascinating that I didn’t appreciate before, is that t-shirts are universal because of their price point, you can pick one up for a few pounds, from an ordinary store or you can spend £700 on a designer one (why I’m not sure but it happens!)\n\nAnother aspect I found of interest is the ‘power of the t-shirt’ and this dynamic explains one of the reasons I’m not a fan. I like to look ‘unique’ different, knowing it’s highly unlikely I will cross paths with someone wearing the same as me, but because t-shirts are mostly mass-produced that’s not the case but also does that weaken their message too? If there’s one t-shirt with a political message on is that strong alone or will it have no impact and if everyone is wearing the same t-shirt does that empower the message or make it meaningless – so much food for thought? My original feeling at the exhibition was that it lessens the impact but now I think if everyone is wearing the same t-shirt with the same message then that message will make its mark.\n\nAnother aspect I found interesting was the smiley faced t-shirts, my association with them was the 90s rave scene but I a) didn’t realise that the smiley was actually from the 60s and 70s and more interestingly b) the current emoji faces are also versions of the smiley – yup that never clicked with me either, maybe I’m just really late but it does help me make more sense of why humans have taken to them so much, smileys in general have a universal appeal.\n\n‘How does the meaning of a Superman t-shirt change when a woman wears one?’\n\nThere’s also a display of unisex t-shirts. In stores you often find male and female sizes of the same t-shirt or variations (yes the pink and blue versions) but one could just ignore that and wear a t-shirt meant for a different body, and if you do is there any specific effect? How does the meaning of a Superman t-shirt change when a woman wears one? It’s again not something I considered but in truth if you asked me I would associate a girl with wearing a Superman logo as being Supergirl but now I realise I’m completely rigid in my thinking a girl can be Superman if she wants right?\n\nA: The Typography of T-Shirts\n\nSeparate to the main sections in a room of its own is an extraordinary exhibition by New York photographer Susan Barnett. Her work spans a decade during which time she’s photographed hundreds of people she’s spotted on the streets, from the back, and 65 of them are on display. It’s so striking to see all the same composition but each image telling such a different story. Her work touches on themes of identity and how you can form an opinion about someone just from seeing what the back of their t-shirt says. Susan was at the exhibition opening where she said: ‘Their choice of t-shirt tells us who they are, who they want us to think they are, who they aren’t – they want to be noticed, they are putting their message out there and it starts a conversation.’\n\n‘You can form an opinion about someone just from seeing what the back of their t-shirt says.’\n\nI’d never thought of it life this. Commonly I see people in what I think are ridiculous messages which I feel says nothing about their personality but in fact I have over-looked the fact that they have made a conscious decision to wear that t-shirt so it must mean something to them.\n\nSusan has also made some fascinating observations about how messages can change over time, explaining that in the US in 2009 just after Obama has been elected in the States she saw a lot of people wearing hopeful messages but as time has gone on and people have started to get more angry and dissatisfied the more political their slogans become and the more swear words you’ll see.\n\nWhile the main exhibition is all about the front of t-shirts, seeing just backs of them worn on people is a completely different experience because we get just a hint of the person, but we never see them. It’s a powerful piece and has really got m thinking about when I next see someone wearing a t-shirt, in particular with words or a slogan, I’m going to wonder more about what kind of person they are for choosing to wear it.\n\n‘T-shirt: Cult Culture Subversion’ takes place at the Fashion and Textile Museum London from 9th February to 6th May 2018. Tickets cost £9.90 for adults and there are also a series of accompanying talks.\n\nhttp://www.ftmlondon.org\n\nAt a travelblogger’s conference earlier this year I was horrified to learn that I am not a proper travel blogger. If I was, I would have written a dozen ‘packing advice’ posts by now. It’s the done thing: guaranteed to get you views. But hey I’m not fickle* and I’m not interested in packing posts. I can’t think of anything more dull to read than an article on ‘go to this shop and buy this’, just to wear once on holiday. Having that that, I did meet a lady whose sole ‘packing advice’ blog got so popular she now employs over 30 people.\n\nSo *this is not strictly a packing post, I merely added the word ‘pack’ in the title to test out if there is any ‘clickbait’ reaction. The main reason I am writing is a couple of weeks back the UK came to a standstill after ‘some’ snowfall. So I’m tying in ‘snow style tips’ with packing; this doubling up makes me feel less ashamed about writing a ‘packing post.’ (Seriously who are these hundreds and thousands of people around the world who read blogs about ‘packing’? Surely there’s none in my friendship network?)\n\nOn to the topic in question. I used to be so freaked out by snow. As a Londoner with little exposure to the white stuff I didn’t get how on earth you walk in it. One time on a ski trip in Slovenia the snow got to me so much I cried on the slopes. Much of my lack of confidence was that I just felt so uncomfortable. My hired ski suit was so un-me and I was handed big bulky boots that I’d never have chosen to wear myself. Leaving any fashion decision in someone else’s hands is a massive risk.\n\nLast month, I faced my snow fears again by spending a few days in Iceland, only this time I was determined not to get upset by abiding by convention and wearing dull clothes. Instead I decided to pack as myself. The only addition I made to my normal wardrobe was thermals. When you’ve got thermals on under your clothes you can get away with wearing anything. Maybe that’s obvious but if it is, I’d like to know what the excuse is for there being so much blandness being worn at this time of year? (Minus the Christmas jumper which is as adventurous as most British people get.)\n\nSo here’s what I discovered about what to wear when it snows, or if you’re in a snowy place.\n\nHiking books? Whatever. You just need some decent crampons\n\nI did actually look into walking and hiking boots but any that were remotely pleasing on the eye were painfully expensive. I mean I only wanted boots for a three day trip, there was no way I was going to invest is a pricey pair and justify it by telling myself I’d wear them again. So I decided on the best possible option, buy the cheapest but nicest pair I could find that would do the job then add on crampons, a portable teeth-like device you place on your shoe which aids walking on snow and ice. They’re pretty cheap and discreet and make walking in snow a breeze. For the boots themselves I bought a pair from Ebay for £10 and they totally did the trick. I only needed the crampons on a couple of occasions when the snow walking turned to snow trekking.\n\nDress up\n\nSee I’m the kind of girl that wears dresses pretty much every day. I don’t own a pair of jeans and I hate trousers, I find them annoyingly restricting. So I consulted my dress collection and picked out the ones which had long sleeves and came below the knee. Then I teamed them with two layers of thermals underneath and the result was I felt happy wearing a dress and I didn’t get cold. Win.\n\nColour\n\nI’ve come across a couple of travel bloggers who have declared it’s winter, so they will be wearing dark colours. Eh? Fine if you want to blend into the grey skies but there’s no law to say colour is just for sunshine. Truth is colour brightens up your mood and those around you. In a winter landscape, colour increases in vibrancy and as many would describe it, makes your photos ‘pop.’ (Yeah, I don’t know what that means either.) You don’t need to go out like a rainbow, think about a key colourful piece – like my red poncho – every time I’ve ever worn it it gets compliments. In fact it’s a travel staple. I take it everywhere, even warm destinations because it acts as an aeroplane blanket and shelter from the draft of air con.\n\nAccessorise appropriately\n\nTo be fair, I don’t normally put the words ‘appropriate’ and ‘fashion together’ but it does alarm me when it’s snowing, people complain and they aren’t even wearing a hat, scarf or gloves. When you’re wrapped up warm for winter your jewellery like necklaces and bangles may get covered up by your layers, but those key items that will be seen are a chance to enjoy your personal style. There’s a scarf type for everyone. And hats… we lose most body heat through our heads yet still there are folk that don’t wear hats. Don’t feel self-conscious, just get one that’s warm and snug – same for gloves. Part fingerless are my favourite because they allow you to do so much more than mittens do despite the fact visually I prefer a mit.\n\nGet cosy in your coat\n\nYour coat is your shield. Your armour. You could be wearing all the thermals in the world but your coat is what will keep the winds out. Yes they are a pain to travel with and mine is so huge it actually took up the same space as hand luggage but lugging it around was so worth it, especially in the waterfall areas of Iceland where the conditions are literally biting cold.\n\nSo…should it snow again where you are, or if you’re off to somewhere snowy this Christmas or New Year don’t feel compelled to wrap up and look drab… snug can be stylish too.\n\nFancy going to Iceland. I was invited by and stayed at Hotel Ranga in Southern Iceland, which is an incredible spot in which to witness the Northern Lights as they have a policy that they give you a wake up call in your room at whatever time they come out whether that’s midnight or 4am, you won’t miss them!\n\nImage credits: Craft and Travel\n\nSeriously. What is it with people who do nothing on their birthday? It astonishes me when friends claim they ‘don’t bother anymore’, ‘they are too old’, blah, blah, blah. The day you were born is an essential celebration in my books, after all; we’ve survived another year. If we honestly care about ourselves, then birthdays are the time to show it.\n\nCreating a ‘birthday suit’ is something I love doing. In previous years I’ve sewn new dresses, but this year I wanted something a little bit different. So I thought about all the things I love. Batman is high up on the list. My favourite superhero, I’ve long wanted to be Bat Girl. And that’s when it clicked; I’d create my own Bat Girl Suit…but not a conventional one. I designed an ensemble that represents me and my story: my very own Bat Sari. Keep reading to see how I created it…\n\nCHOOSING MY DESIGN\n\nClothing is a form of self-expression though not everyone takes advantage of the possibilities. Designing my own sari was a chance to play with six whole metres of fabric so I opted to tell my own story through the design.\n\nIt starts from the bottom: my very own pink Bat Girl logo. Every super hero has their own logo and a pink bat was exactly what I wanted: fierce yet unashamedly kitsch. I then created a border of a Gothamesque city but it’s not a crime ridden fictional town, it’s infact a silhouette of the Taj Mahal: built in India to commemorate the Mughal Empress Mumtaz after her death, who I’m named after. I mounted it on a photograph of a sunset I took one Christmas in Brighton, where I was a student. It looks like a painted backdrop but it’s an untouched actual photograph of a magical horizon.\n\nI’m a sunset chaser, every time I travel seeing the sunset is my number one priority so seeing one on my sari makes me happy and proud, knowing it’s my phoneography skills.\n\nThe main visible section of the sari is called the pallu, this is the area that gets styled over the shoulder and this was the area I couldn’t wait to create. As a crafter I’m most comfortable when I’m sewing and collaging so that’s what I did.\n\nI gathered all my fabrics, beads, sequins, gemstones, broken jewellery, made some handmade paper, raided my trim stash and used these items to create a pattern that depicts my love for colour and appreciate of textiles and texture and were all sourced from different times of my life, including a beaded trim I bought in Kenya and a sample from a handbag I made back in 2001.\n\nDIGITAL PRINT FABRIC\n\nI am utterly obsessed with digital print. If I was Graphic Designer I would be translating all my ideas onto fabric…hang on a minute. Should it stop me just because I don’t have the skills? Hell no. I may not be a dab hand with Illustrator, In-Design or Photoshop (or whatever other packages designers use) but I do know how to sew and craft things. And I know designers – a perfect excuse to collaborate. So that’s what I did. Of course there was also the question of printing fabric. My friend Tree who knows about these things suggested I check out Fashion Formula who allow you to print your own designs onto fabric and wallpaper and then sell your designs via their website.\n\nOOH. So much lovey fabric at Fashion Formula to choose from\n\nThey have over 50 fabrics to choose from, from craft felt (imagine the possibilities) to luxury velvet and waterproof shower curtain material. It’s mind-blowing when you think about the potential but I had to reign myself in. I was looking for the perfect sari fabric, that had to be light and floaty. I had no idea where to start so I popped into their West London office to have a good feel of their fabrics. Oh my. It was like being in fabric heaven. Seeing so many different textures lined up isn’t something you can witness in normal fabric shops. You don’t need to trek to West London though, Fashion Formula send out sample books. They are only £1 and they help you compare the feel and weight of the fabric before you choose.\n\nI knew I wanted something floaty and light to give my sari a touch of Bollywood romance (I’m a sucker for watching those) so I asked the Fashion Formula team what they recommended and they suggested a silky soft, light crinkle chiffon lurex which has a natural glistening stripe to it and is new on their fabric list. As I knew my sari would feature images of shimmering, glittering stones it was perfect.\n\nDESIGNING MY SARI\n\nThe design for my pallu\n\nMy sari is a collaboration piece, I knew I couldn’t do it all myself to I had a think about all the awesome people I know and Graphic Designer & Stylist Sally Hughson came to mind. She designs the fliers for the Craft Night I co-run with my friend Mia, The Make Escape and her ideas are always so imaginative. Sal helped me turn my collages into a digital design while my friend Tree also assisted with creating the patterned section on the main body of the sari. The three of us constructed the design of my dreams, and it was great to have their support rather than me spend hours alone trying to figure out how to cut out and blow up photos of giant jewels.\n\nSARI STORY\n\nIt took Fashion Formula just a couple of days to print my sari and though they post out nationally and internationally I was too excited to wait, so I went to collect it.\n\nFirst look at my printed sari fabric at Fashion Formula\n\nWhen I arrived the sari was wound around a cardboard pole, I actually couldn’t believe my vision was alive. Alex from Fashion Formula unwound the fabric to show me the pattern and I was utterly amazed, the finished print surpassed all my expectations. The material printed faultlessly and the patterns were so clear and beautiful.\n\nBIRTHDAY PHOTOSHOOT\n\nChecking into the MakeUp Surgery\n\nAgain collaboration was in order. I teamed up with Halima @MakeUpSurgery who shares a similar vision to me about fashion and styling: that it’s a form of art and expression and that there is absolutely no reason to conform to any ideals other than your own.\n\nWe spent an afternoon at her East London ‘creative surgery’ where she did my make-up, styled me for the shoot and did the photography – with this much skill, she’s clearly a Wonder Woman herself. Halima opted for purple lashes and a gorgeous white shimmer on my skin and dressed me in Adidas tracksuit bottoms and white gloves. I felt like I could conquer the world. We took over 1000 photos and all of them were incredible.\n\nI felt so proud wearing a sari that represents me: a British, Bangladeshi, South Asian, Muslim, Londoner, Colour Addict, Craft Queen, Batman loving, Urban Warrioress who is a firm believer in freedom – freedom to be who you want, live where you want, love who you want, go where you want and do what you want as long as it makes you happy. Life is precious and short. Sieze it, do it, say it, be it. And as my friend Karen Arthur says ‘wear your happy.’\n\nOh and I’ve decided Birthday Photoshoots should be A Thing so celebrate being alive and do one too.\n\nVOILA!\n\nHappy Birthday me!\n\nIt’s my birthday today and my sari is the ultimate present to myself. Making it was one of the best uses of my time all year. Every second I spent on it made me happy so I’ve decided not to stop here. In 2018 I’ll be launching my own range of sarees, designed for the modern woman who loves dressing up. I’m also keen to collaborate with other designers and artists so if you want to work with me on a sari, get in touch.\n\nNow where’s the cake…\n\nMy birthday sari was a collaboration with these awesome people:\n\nFabric printing: Fashion Formula\n\nMake-Up, Styling & Photography: Halima @MakeUpSurgery\n\nDigital/Graphic Design: Sally Hughson Additional design: Tree @StitchlessTV Re-touching: Richard Elsley.\n\nTHANK YOU!\n\nPortraits by: Horaczko Photography\n\nCamden Town. Any alternative teen growing up in London (or those visiting the UK capital) will confess that Camden is the stuff their dreams are made off. A sea of subcultures, united by their individuality, finally having a space they can call their own, and most importantly, go shopping in to find all the things they will never be able to source on the high street, like psychedelic hooded tops, fluorescent plastic jewellery, rare vinyl records, quirky items for their bedroom, gifts for hippy chick friends and of course; infinite places in which to pick up hair dye.\n\nAt 15 I remember hanging out here, being in awe of all the clothes, while stocking up on Aubergine Stargazer hair colour. These people around me were my tribe, none of them went to my school, but oh how I wish they did. Here was where the hip folk hung out and I was pretty much one of them. This feeling though fuelled by passion, sadly doesn’t last beyond your 20s.\n\nIt’s a fact that as soon as you hit your 30s, Camden is suddenly a no-go area: you’re no longer cool and you’ve been replaced by humans half your age. But does this mean you can longer enjoy it?\n\nMy view is this: you can, but you need to take a different approach and attitude. The same types of shops you loved in your younger days may no longer appeal but that’s ok, there are others to explore. Accept that and move on. It’s the only way to survive.\n\nWhere age doesn’t matter…\n\nA few Camden haunts that you can fully appreciate when you’re well into your 30s and beyond, without fear of feeling like everyone else there could potentially be your own teenage child…\n\nTea & Crafting\n\nAnd relax! If it’s craft and travel you’re after quite literally, than look no further than Tea and Crafting, Camden’s very own crafty haven. Regular workshops run here, all of which include materials, tuition and of course: tea and cake. There’s no need to commit to a course, you can simply turn up and do workshops that interest you, from weaving to calligraphy, during evenings and weekends…the adult in you can finally feel like ‘yes there is a space where I can feel at home in Camden that isn’t as ludicrously as loud as Cyber Dog, but is equally as cool.’ Head to their website to see what’s coming up.\n\nCanal boating\n\nOne for adults and kids, there’s no denying that a trip on the canals is one that fills everyone with excitement, especially if you board the departure that gives you entrance into London Zoo. Yes there will be children, but you and they will be so excited you won’t even notice each other.\n\nJazz Café\n\nThere’s a lot of bars in Camden and while some will undoubtedly be occupied by ageing rockers who have been coming to Camden their entire life, you will see a lot of kids too. Bigger bands play in epic venues like the Roundhouse and here you may find yourself at a gig with fans who look underage but that’s when you just need to allow it and remember you were young once.\n\nThe venue you probably didn’t go to when you were a teen but is filled with appeal now you’re 30 and upwards is the famous Jazz Café. A bit rough round the edges and with an intimate charm, Sunday’s are a perfect time to visit for some laid back sounds post lunch.\n\nCamden Stables Market\n\nWith over 50 food stalls in this part of town, it’s where to come when you’re hungry. Filled with more tourists than youth, you’ll feel slightly more at ease navigating this quarter where you’ll also find all the usual Camden creativity like fashion, jewellery, quirky gifts and homewares.\n\nRegent’s Park\n\nGet off at Camden Town tube, skip the crowds and head straight up to this iconic park where it’s perfectly acceptable to laze on the grounds, wonder through the well-pruned gardens and even get a bit cultured watching sunset over Regent’s Park mosque amidst lake views. If you’re going any time soon the Frieze Sculpture exhibition is still on too.\n\nOpt for Camden, rather than Camden Town\n\nVenture further afield, Chalk Farm, Primrose Hill, Mornington Crescent…Camden isn’t just about the markets. Go to the places that the youth have no interest in, find a coffee shop or quaint café, read the papers in peace and breathe in the solitude that doesn’t exist when you’re right in the thick of this buzzing part of London, that can only be enjoyed when you step off the beaten tourist track.\n\nWhere to stay clear of unless you want a teenage trip down memory lane and aren’t afraid of the fact that everyone else looks so young they are practically babies…\n\nElectric Ballroom\n\nThe indoor market just near the station as you exit on Sundays is filled with fake vintage clothing and gothic attire. Even if you are a goth, there are better places to shop: leave this haunt to the youth.\n\nThe main high street\n\nTruth is it’s not just weekends Camden is busy 24/7 but good luck to anyone who tries to navigate the busy main thoroughfare at peak times. If it can be avoided, do so at all costs. Leave it to the youth who have the energy for this craziness, opt for the back and side streets instead…peace at last.\n\nFinal warning…\n\nI’ve positioned this post within the Wish List section as Camden is a shopper’s paradise but be careful, be honest and don’t buy anything that you would have wanted to wear when you were 15…because no one wants to be mutton dressed as lamb.\n\nPortraits by: Horaczko Photography\n\nWith less than a week to go until Glastonbury gets the UK festival season kick-started there’s a deluge of articles about what to wear, buy and what beauty looks to create for Glastonbury across the blogosphere. Now I for one am not in a position to buy clothes every season and for every occasion, my trick is changing up my accessories to make it look like I have a never-ending wardrobe. Truth is if you make just one change like swapping a necklace or scarf, it automatically looks like you have a new outfit.\n\nGlastonbury like many festivals has become one giant moneyfest. Once you’ve added up your ticket price, travel, food and expenses you’re looking at spending around £500 and that’s without you even starting on your wardrobe. Save a few pennies instead because you’ll need them, by making DIY accessories that look awesome and keep with the original roots of the festival which was never about commercialisation.\n\nPompoms & smoothie bowl\n\nAs I said it’s less that a week away so you clearly won’t have much time to spend on making, so here’s a super simple idea that doubles up as fun jewellery while being super useful and best of all, it can be knocked out in less than an hour.\n\nPOMPOM Chain necklace\n\nYou will need:\n\nPompom maker (I used a medium and a small one from Fabrications you’ll find in most craft shops)\n\nYarn\n\nChain\n\nScissors\n\nTo make pompoms\n\nPompom makers vary slightly so these instructions are for the most common type.\n\nStart by opening up the pompom maker by separating the two sides.\n\nWrap yarn across the full surface of one side.\n\nEnsure there are no gaps. The more you build it up, the fluffier your pompom will be.\n\nWhen you get to the end, cut the yarn and repeat winding yarn on at the other end.\n\nWhen you’ve done both ends, close up the pompom maker.\n\nTake your scissors and cut through the yarn in the centre where you’ll feel a slight ridge in the pompom maker.\n\nCut a separate piece of yarn and tie it around the centre of the pompom maker, tying it really tightly, then wrap around and tie up a couple more times.\n\nPull the pompom maker apart to release the pompom and gently whack it on a table to help it fluff up into shape.\n\nAttaching the pompoms\n\nYou’ll be left with the two ends of yarn which you tied around the centre. Feed these through the chain and tie up so that you’ve got a ‘pompom charm’ and continue all the way around tying on as many as you want – use a mirror as a reference point to ensure the balance and pompom positioning is right.\n\nFinishing touches\n\nGo full swing with the charm potential. The chain allows you to attach anything you want onto your necklace so as well as pompoms you could attach small charms, beads, ribbons and tassels. You can also sparkle up the pompoms by gluing gemstones and sequins directly onto the pompoms and of course during the initial pompom making stage you can also mix up colours so your pompoms are multi-tone.\n\nYou can also double it up into something super useful like dangling keys off your chain and any other small things you might need which in my case is usually lipgloss.\n\nAbout the pictures…\n\nEarlier this week I went along to Palm Vaults, the hip East London vegetarian eatery which has been named the most Instagrammable café in London (and is in the running as the pinkest!)\n\nDesign is everything inside this mint and pink themed pastel heaven so here’s a few more photos and yes the food and drinks are pink too…\n\nIf you can get to Palm Vaults in the week you’ll have a more relaxing experience, at weekends you’ll need to book ahead.\n\nExpect yummy concoctions like lavender latte, dragon fruit breakfast bowls and pink wafer sponge cake.\n\nI am most definitely going to be coming back here, it’s a great place to photograph crafts projects and there’s plenty more on the menu I still want to try!\n\nFestival fashion shopping\n\nIf you are doing some festival shopping then forget the high street. Check out online store Purple Mayhem instead which specialises in handmade festival fashion…their tassel shrugs are about as perfect as festival fashion gets.\n\nVisit Purple Mayhem.\n\nI nearly exploded from excitement the day I heard there was going to be an Anna Sui exhibition at The Fashion and Textile Museum in London. Embodying everything fashion should be, I love how Anna’s work is deeply rooted in counter-cultures and scenes like punk rock and pop art. Anna has taken alternative lifestyles and celebrated them on international catwalks not just for one season when they might be ‘on trend’, but always: these styles and influences are intrinsic to all her work, whatever the year or decade, she’s stayed true to herself and the Anna Sui brand.\n\nSeeing Anna’s work on the pages of a magazine or online is the closest I had previously got to seeing her work, but now with the opening of The World of Anna Sui, the biggest retrospective there’s ever been of the New York Designer, everyone can experience her cool and quirky designs in the flesh. There are 125 items on display at the new exhibition at The Fashion and Textile Museum, with pieces from her first fashion show in 1991 right up until her 2017 collection; it’s the ultimate exhibition of modern fashion.\n\nThe exhibition is thematically arranged showing Anna’s different archetypes such as The RockStar, The School Girl, The Punk Grunge (above) and The Nomad. Within each collection you can get up close with her gorgeous designs, admiring the cuts, textures and colourful printed fabrics. The exhibition is one two levels, a main room which is filled with mannequins and then an upper level where you can see the accessories, cosmetics ranges and even the mood boards which Anna creates to help her design her collections.\n\nThe main room resembles what I would love my own walk-in wardrobe to be. I wanted to wear every outfit and I’m sure they would all look great on me too!! Instead however I took home my own piece of Anna Sui DIY fashion mentality by getting an iron-on patch from the museum’s shop where there are also some other cool Anna memorabilia, I’m going to save for the notebook and go back to get it before the exhibition closes!\n\nBring money for The Fashion and Textile Museum shop!\n\nIn the opening days of The World of Anna Sui, Anna was there too (on the 25th for a main launch and on the 26th where she did a public book signing of the book that accompanies the exhibition.)\n\nHearing first hand from Anna at the launch about her experiences and influences was rather special so I decided to share her ‘In Conversation With’ which she did in front of an audience to coincide with the launch of her new perfume Fantasia. I was thrilled that she also answered one of my questions in the Q&A…\n\nAnna being interviewed at the launch\n\nHow did you feel when you walked in today and saw your life’s work unfold in front of you?\n\nI really feel that this has been one of the biggest thrills of my career. As a Designer we’re always looking forward, thinking about deadlines, trying to make things happen on time for a show, a launch, ensure there are fabric deliveries, that you never tend to look back. One of the most exciting things is actually seeing these outfits together again because I haven’t seen them since the fashion shows 20 years ago or however long ago, so it’s kind of like seeing all my different babies.\n\nWhat was it like to know that your clothes were being worn by celebrities?\n\nSo exciting and it gave me the confidence to go on because when Madonna was wearing my dress I hadn’t even thought about doing my own fashion show. But then I thought hang on, here’ someone who could have worn anything and she was wearing my design. So when we went back to New York, I started on my own show as I thought if Madonna likes it than other people will too.\n\nHow did you get into being a Fashion Designer?\n\nAt my aunt and uncle’s wedding I was the flower girl and I was so taken by New York City and the glamour of my aunts all dressed up for the wedding that when I got back to Michigan I said to my parents I wanted to design. At the back of my babysitter’s Seventeen magazine there was an advert for registering at Parson’s School of Design in New York so I wrote to Parsons got the registration catalogue and applied. That’s why my saying is live your dreams because a dream can really take you further than anything.\n\nWere you making clothes at this point?\n\nMy mum did sewing at home so I would take the scraps and make doll clothes for my cousins and I would change their Barbie outfits into things I had created, much to their own trauma and then eventually I took sewing classes and learned how to sew myself. I started taking patterns and taking the sleeves and putting them with the bodice of another pattern. I kind of knew I had to understand the structure of clothing and know how to sew, not that I was ever a great craftsman, but I started making all my own clothes so that I had lots of outfits to wear.\n\nYou have a myriad of inspirations where does your love for colour and pattern come from?\n\nI think the fact my parents were so modern. They were both educated in France but they both came from China. So they were educated in France met, married and then my father went to university in Michigan, so I think that was quite adventurous for both of them and it made the world seem like a smaller place for me because I always heard them talking about different cities they had visited in Europe. I think it helped when I was offered freelance jobs like working in Italy or working in Japan, I was never afraid to do it because I thought well my parents went from China to France to the United States so gave me that gift of having a global spirit. I think that it also coincided with the world becoming globalised and that helped me think about it as one whole unit, rather than places being so far away.\n\nAre there standout pieces we should look for out for in the exhibition?\n\nWhen you first walk into exhibition on the left there’s the dress from my Marie Antoinette inspired collection. So this is an example of my thought process. I had gone to Paris and seen my friend Sofia Coppola filming the ballroom scene of Marie Antoinette and I thought ok I’m going to use this inspiration for the collection but then I went on vacation with two of my nephews and we went to Turkey and we went to a palace and there I saw the harem and I thought to myself oh my god, this is the same period as Marie Antoinette so I’m going to incorporate some of what I’m experiencing on this trip. We had also gone to see a museum display of Barbarossa the pirate so I thought ok pirates and Marie Antoinette why not? But I also had my favourite band the New York Dolls poster on the wall and there was a dress code back in that day – you could wear black, white, red, stripes, roses and you can see all of that in that dress: it’s all those things mixed together and some how it comes out an Anna Sui thing.\n\nAlso the inspiration boards, they tell the design team and the people I work with what the collection is going to be about. All the boards are grouped by colour and the fabric swatches below reflect that colour. I think that one of the craziest was a collection inspired by punk rock but then I saw a catalogue by Madeleine Castaing and they were auctioning off her possession and in the catalogue you can see all the personal furniture they collected which was all Napoleon the third. She loved blue and aqua and that became the colour palette for the collection while the designs and prints we chose really reflect Madeleine Castaing’s style but then the style itself has all those punk elements thrown in: fishnets, zippers, studs, leather, and there’s just a total mixture but if you look at the garments it just works.\n\nWhere do the designs for your cosmetics range come from?\n\nMy lifestyle, the style of how I decorate and how I dress is really incorporated into my work and when we started designing the packaging for the cosmetics I was wearing these rings and we decided ok all packaging has to reflect these rings which had roses carved from black lacquer. It was also what I put into my first store I ended up painting it black lacquer. One of the most important aspects of my job is I have to make my product as exciting as my fashion. I think not everyone has the lifestyle or budget or accessibility to buy an Anna Sui dress but I want them to have the same thrill the same tingle when they have a tube of lipstick or a nail polish so that’s why I make boxes that you’re not even ever going to throw away because you have to save them. The container itself too has to be so evocative of my world and then of course the best quality products and the most beautiful interesting textures and colours.\n\nHow did you create your own signature make-up look?\n\nOnce I started being able to wear make-up I experimented and had colours on my face, glitter, whatever, but then I fell into this black eyeliner and red lipstick look and I’ve stuck with it and that was the first product we developed in the cosmetics line, my signature red no. 400 lipstick and to this day I wear it every day.\n\nWhere does fragrance fit into this fantastical universe for you?\n\nAnna’s new fragrance Fantasia\n\nFragrance is another accessory it really completes a look, evokes the mood and as a child I remember my mum wearing Chanel no. 5 and every time I smell that fragrance I remember her all dressed up and going out with my dad. I think that it becomes almost your second signature when you recognise a scent that someone wears you always think about that person so I was so excited when I got approached to do a fragrance collection and I wanted it to be my signature. You’ll notice fragrances have been named after me Sui Love, Sui Dream and Dolly Girl after the mannequin heads that we decorate the store with.\n\nThere’s a British mood to your work but there’s no British in you, do you feel British?\n\nEver since I saw The Beatles and Rolling Stones I dreamed about London even though it seemed like such a far away place. Whatever glimpses I got these inspired me. I came to London first in the punk days I knew a lot of the bands went to see a lot of shows, went to see Vivienne Westwood’s collection, every chance I got I came to London and I think you see a lot of that inspiration in my work.\n\nHow has international travel influenced your work?\n\nWell I think I’m kind of a gypsy and like gypsies themselves, they travelled and picked up culture along the way and incorporated it into their dress, their traditions, their lifestyle and I think everywhere I go, the first thing I want to see is a flea market and I go to the museums there and then I also go shopping and see what the stuff is there that I haven’t seen before, so all of that really inspires me – there’s nothing better than to discover something I knew nothing about.\n\nWhat would you like people to understand from seeing this exhibition?\n\nIf you want to be a Fashion Designer, you have to establish your identity and you have to stick with that identify. You can see throughout the exhibition book where and how I decorated my apartment all became icons of my brand;the butterflies, the roses, the black and purple and as we developed the licensed products each off these have that same identity so I think that it’s important for fashion designers to come up with their own icons and identity too.\n\nI also want people to know there’s a team behind the brand, the fragrance, the cosmetics, the shows, all the people involved are essential in making a total look, I couldn’t have done it all myself, I want people to realise it’s not just a name, but a team.\n\nAt the end of the In Conversation With I had a chance to speak to Anna briefly she said she really liked my colours and my glitter lips so I guess it’s apt out photo came out pink!\n\nThe World of Anna Sui\n\n26th May – 1 October 2017\n\nThe Fashion and Textile Museum, 83 Bermondsey Street, London, SE1 3XF\n\nwww.ftmlondon.org/exhibitions"
