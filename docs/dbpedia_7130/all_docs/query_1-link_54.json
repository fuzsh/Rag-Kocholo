        "text": "Crafters are a generous community and many makers regularly enjoy contributing handmade projects to good causes. If you’ve always wanted to get involved in knitting for charity or are looking for your next charity knitting project, then look no further than these important organisations in the UK who are seeking knitting donations for babies, made by volunteers.\n\nTIP: Check out our guide to the non-baby-specific charities which would love your knitted garments.\n\nWhat baby garments to knit for charity\n\nThe typical donation request for babies is tiny premature-size garments and accessories such as hats, booties, gloves and cardigans. Knitted baby blankets and toys are also welcomed by some charities. Make sure you check the requirements before you send in a donation. For example, one of the charities we’ve recommended below (Sands), specifically wants white blankets.\n\nAlways be mindful of the types of yarn you use, ensure they are safe and comfortable for babies. Check out our guide to the best baby yarn to be sure.\n\nHow to knit\n\nIf you’re a proficient knitter, you may have previously participated in charity knitting campaigns. If you’re new to knitting, are a beginner or simply haven’t yet built up your confidence in knitting then don’t worry. Knitting campaigns are a great way to practice your knitting skills and if you need a recap on how to knit, check out our video designed to help you master the knitting basics.\n\nIf there’s a local knitting club or group you can attend, they’re a great place to get help from other members, so if you get stuck and need a hand, that’s a good first point of call.\n\nBaby charities looking for your knitting\n\nGet involved!
