The British Bengali community of Tower Hamlets have never failed to adapt to their circumstances, from the rag trade era to its current curry houses, with many young entrepreneurs also starting their own businesses in the East end. However, the area faces devastation as the widespread of Brick lanes 'hipster movement' have started a new wave of cultural Wipeout led by the Truman Brewery as they are planning to redevelop the area by building a large mall in the heart of Banglatown! Emphasised with great \"job opportunities for the locals\" by organisers, this may just be the end of an era for Brick Lanes authenticity.
