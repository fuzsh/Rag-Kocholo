        "text": "I attended two very interesting talks – one at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) by Vijayandara Rao Co-author of the World Bank (WB) report – ‘Localising Development: Does Participation Work’ and then a presentation by David Satterthwaite on the United Nations (UN) post Millennium Development Goals 2015 Goals – at UCL, organised by the Bartlett Development Planning Unit (DPU).\n\nI will try to keep this short – and it probably deserves more references of case-studies + also reflections from our work in Bangladesh.\n\nBoth were reflections on past community development and how to go forward and presented two different world-views for development – there are countless other views of course, but these two, succinctly put forward arguments for a development that includes distributive power and control, and more action oriented towards progress.\n\nRao critically unpacked the failure of the WB to actually support participatory models, and the clarity gained from analysing projects over a 10 year period of WB funded projects. His analysis was that – with project investment often failing to reach the people it was deemed to serve – his closing remarks – ‘less talk, less money, more time’ sticks with me along with the importance of Data collection and Monitoring and Evaluation. It is the most boring part of a project design perhaps – but clearly one of the most important. It fosters and builds accountability and trust in the process, it also helps learning from mistakes easier – yet he says only 40% of WB projects included effective monitoring and evaluation at the DESIGN stage of the project.\n\nSatterthwaite put forward a ‘fun’ presentation on the MDGs – looking to see whether we ‘avoid’, ‘bury’ or ‘improve’ the goals as they come the end. HE argued that the MDGs were developed in a top-down, rushed manner, that were then forced upon central governments to try and implement, with little data and contextual appreciation. He contested the very way that the MDGs were translated into results, with criteria which were badly flawed to begin with and with the way the UN has marketed the success of the MDGs and also presented a set of data that would make you take note of the UN’s own PR machine, and also often without an actual understanding of where real development takes place – at the local government level. He then continued on to discuss ways forward, mostly focusing on the model developed by his own cohort of academics and practitioners – a rights based, co-productive framework for urban development, which puts the community at the heart of the development – And so what the post MDG 2015 could look like.\n\nLessons I am taking from the two talks is this:\n\nLeadership\n\nThere is still a BIG GAP and a REAL NEED for local, grass-roots leaders with structural support from partners across the spectrum of power.\n\nA poor community – urban or rural, to challenge injustice, actually cannot do it on their own and especially, if their priority is to survive on a daily basis.\n\nThere needs to be smarter ways to empower – more targeted strategies and tactics that actually deal with training, developing and creating leaders from within communities. This requires time.\n\nInspirational leaders make a significant difference and can definitely push the agenda – Jockin Arputham and others of his ilk need huge support but also have the innate charisma to perhaps create miracles. The journey is not an easy one, and I can imagine so many others who have failed to sustain the stamina needed to push and become effective leaders.\n\nOf course, a question will always be ‘ARE LEADERS BORN/ OR ARE THEY NURTURED? Jockin’s story is a testament to an amazing set of leadership qualities, but he was also blessed with an amazing network of support.\n\nIf we seriously look to the idea of the venture capital world – Investors spreading risk – then investing in training and seeking leaders – 1000’s, with the promising few to be fast-tracked and given a support structure to grow and expand might be an interesting way forward – but this is often coupled now with ‘business’ as opposed to strategic and emotive leadership thinking.\n\nI think also, the conversation needs to be really about sharing and exchanging knowledge, something that SDI and ACHR have prized themselves on, this requires what Rao has stated multiple times.\n\nTIME. Fast-tracking leaders does not work, and not investing the time necessary – often 5-10 years to help realise the leadership qualities within communities and organisations is important. Experience has to be experience, you cannot beat that – simulations can only go so far in the classroom – So how do we bridge the gap between the desire to push leaders out into the world, with development of leaders who already exist in the world?\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation (Accountability…)\n\nAccountability and learning – learning from failure, this is a repeated mantra (at least to me) that has yet to fully filter through Donor agencies, government institutions and NGOs and charities.\n\nWith Vijay’s findings also, it is clear that M&E, and data collection are two crucial components – especially data at the community level. Which often does not exist – it puts the horrible real question – if you don’t know who and what the community is, how are you ‘developing’ them. There has to be serious acceptance across the board that the investment in technologies that are aiding monitoring and evaluation, and allowing data collection to happen quicker, faster and easier – with analytics being deployed efficiently through clean graphs and charts and available through open-source platforms means there is no real excuse anymore.\n\nSimple tools like Mapyourworld.org are great and apps such as ODK are beginning to find their space for data collecting. Better relationships with universities and training schools is also important – it creates then a culture of learning from those that are becoming knowledgeable on one topic, with communities that are rich in data and willing to share. A stronger relationship with IT needs to be embraced, they are seen as disruptive tools, which can mobilise, analyse, trigger and create effects unforeseen in the past.\n\nSupportive state institutions\n\nHere, I think it is important to articulate that without state institutions at the local level equipped to react and respond to the needs of the people they are to serve, then it is unlikely any form of justice (social, spatial or environmental) will be achieved. This is where donor agencies could focus on, in strengthening local institutions to better manage resources, in developing systems that are practical and effective as well as in developing inclusive strategies and policies, will really enable and empower communities to also come forward. This is an on-going debate and many models exist.\n\nInducing Development – to conclude..\n\nAs planners and facilitators, (the often crude – development practitioner) its critical look at our own role in development – we hold more power than most, we have access to resources, knowledge and data that communities will never see. We are also part of a power structure that can bypass local politics, we can instigate dialogue or propose ideas that are adaptable, we can also observe and provide feedback and fine tune ideas. We also have a foresight and the social mobility to travel and learn from others. It then puts the dilemma, a continuous one for me – one how involved I get, how engaged I am or when to pull out. It is not about pulling out, it is about continuous evolution of a relationship, of a process that works towards justice. This means the relationship will significantly transform over time, from facilitator, to designer, to listener, to mentor, to friend, to advisor, to entertainment planner – the roles shift and so do the learning modes – from the meeting room, to the classroom, to the open field or the dirty toilet cubicles. Being open to growth – personal and professional is important here – as we will see the communities we are working with also change\n\nand grow, and our goal should always be to make ourselves irrelevant in the community.\n\nODI talk with David Booth (left) and Vijayandra Rao (WB) (2nd Right)\n\nDavid Satterthwaite at UCL\n\nAfter 20-odd intense days in Bangkok, Thailand, – laptop-less and armed with just a camera and a notebook. I had to make do with being not the expert on the field, but rather a student eager to learn. I was not in the mode or mood to churn out a million idea’s and hope one of them sticks. A resounding thought always came to me: ‘Unleash the knowledge of the streets’ and the idea’s of small change. Our job as Urban Development Practitioners would be to do just that and perhaps no more. 16 days doesnt give you enough time on the field to comprehend the nature of a community, the nature of a city or the nature of the country. The intensity of the program meant that we worked hard, and also played a little. Bangkok, in its entirety is a city like many others but unlike any other. Its unique identity grips you and at the same time makes you question it. recreated as an economic centre for Thailand as well as being a hot tourist destination, the city looks to attract diverse energies, and perhaps our first nights’ conversation will leave a lasting imprint on my mind. The contradiction and complexity of managing such a city is obvious, and to say that any one individual will be able to tame this beast is an insult to the time and energy invested in nurturing it.\n\nFor me, when you can begin to understand the realities of the everyday people living in a country, beyond the idea that you get from a windscreen survey, when you can understand a community beyond just some subjects that you have come to study, only then, can you begin to comprehend the nature of the task that is at the foot of a community, the city or a country. Our collective hours spent on site, in meetings and in lectures has given us a rich amount of information. More than we could possibly digest. However, this information gathered requires time to simmer and become knowledge. The program that we went to learn from, Baan Mankong, is an enigma like no other, developed over the last 30-odd years in creating a demand led program for housing and secure tenure, it has become hybrid in form and implementation, it has a curiously serious and focused approach to citizen rights in the city. Carefully balanced between government and individual rights, and as a program of the Community Organizations Development Institute (CODI). CODI is a Thai government agency formed in 2000 through the merging of the Urban Community Development Office (UCDO) and the Rural Development Fund. CODI is an independent public organization under the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security. It launched the Baan Mankong Program in 2003 and its old director, Somsook Boonyabancha has been spearheading, along with her colleagues a desire to create demand led development. Although its not difficult to understand the complexity in trying to decipher something that has taken decades to develop. In practice, it delivers.\n\nHow do I begin to unpack such a program? as the days went on, we were exposed to a variety of situations, both on the sites we were allocated in the Nonthaburi Province, as part of the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) and an upcoming province in relation to the development of Thailand. We had a chance also to hear and see the stories we heard of other sites which were located in and around Bangkok.\n\nI come to some simple conclusions for the purpose of this post, both on my initial reaction to such a program and the impact it has made on me. Apart from the complexity of group dynamics and looking to work with fellow colleagues, my mind and energies was really focused on learning as much as possible about the program on the ground. The chameleon like nature of Baan Mankong makes me wonder how it will be scaled up to both city level and possibly impacting at a wider national scale. As it has put people at the centre and as the driver for the program, its biggest question to answer will always be do people want more rights than the basic ones they need to continue living their everyday lives? We seem to have gotten into our head that the desire to participate in the City development is a must for every urban citizen. That communities, somehow, once empowered, need to continue on and continue fighting for the city. That somehow, when empowered, the poor would miraculously only want to work collectively and in communities to achieve a utopian city. We neglect that like everybody else, they are human beings first, citizens second. When you recognise the rights of the human being, you recognise at that instant the ability of the human being to make choices. As I question this notion of the ‘Rights to the City’, I often ponder that it has become a bourgeois notion, being pushed by academics as a blueprint for securing rights. Critique and focus often is on institutional change and often through the law. In developing countries, we can add all the law’s in the world, if they cannot be implemented, the energy spent can be questioned.\n\nI have been reading E.F Schumacher’s Small is Beautiful since coming back. His thoughts are that democracy works upto a certain scale, that the inverse viewpoint – that decentralised and empowered local governments are best able to deal with the issues on the ground, that regional and central government has a specific role in ensuring information, budgets and policies are developed so that these local governments can flourish. His notion that traditional wisdom and knowledge of the people is best utilized in small communities, and that the desire to participate wanes after a certain period. How much of the city is any one community really going to understand? the megacities of today work because there are so many micro cities within it. There is no denial in this, Yes, granted city infrastructures and governance enable this to continue, the everyday citizen will not be so focused on wanting to influence change in the City, not so far as it does not impede his or her rights. In challenging giantism, in challenging systems of oppression, one needs to be tactical and often the answer is not to charge full steam ahead but rather to create the room for manoeuvre required to ensure that the rights are attained – with as little damage to the poor as possible.\n\nThe Baan Mankong program creates empowered citizens, giving them tools to get onto the rungs of economic and social security, people working collectively not towards an ideal such as a Just City, but rather towards a tangible and secure right, that of housing and land security. Its perhaps a bonus that this is an entry to other rights and other opportunities for participation, but to scale up Baan Mankong to act as it can do more than that, especially when it is chaotic within each unique sets of conditions it looks to address in each unique location, its ability to scale up rests not in its policy to build capacity within itself, but perhaps its ability to work better with other government and private sector organisations. It creates and acts as a legitimate and valuable catalyst in transforming the right of urban poor citizens, but it’s ultimate desire is not to stifle peoples’ creativity and drive towards participation, but rather to ensure they can participate as much, or as little as they want. Empowered citizens, or leaders, can become tricky propositions, simply because, at some point, if they have not been taught the importance of collaboration, trust and collective action effectively, they may struggle to lead their community out of poverty. Collectively then, the co-produced knowledge that is being created is in the hands of the people, then the next step, to claim other rights as communities and local districts etc, is left to the people. There isnt a need for CODI or the Baan Mankong program to lead this, they have already planted the seeds as the catalyst in getting people to start re-thinking about the role they have to play in creating sustainable and just communities.\n\nThe wonderful thing about the program is that, when it does begin to utilize fully the architects, planners and other practitioners towards creating empowered citizens in urban spaces, along side the institutions, then it can continue to contribute positive change in the cities it is working in. Its future does look bright, but it is also one of careful negotiations and focuses. Perhaps its ultimate success lies in both the people it is working with on the field, who have been practical and also producing results that Baan Mankong have aspired to, and its ability to negotiate complex situations effectively. Indeed, its premise of putting people at the centre, ensuring that they are the experts that drive the change that they seek, means that it has little accountability when a community fails to achieve the glossy images and the beautiful sites that many go to visit. Perhaps it is here where the program needs to focus its attention on, when communities arent so successful, and they need assistance in pulling together and going forward, the Baan Mankong team needs to dedicate energies beyond just being a tool kit. Otherwise, this can spread too, and like anything that does spread, there is no telling the lasting damage it causes.\n\nI do think the scale that the program is working on is phenomenal, it does however have room for improvements. It would be interesting to understand further then how they do support the failing communities that enter the program, those unable to build trust, negotiate, appoint a leader that can actually lead. The pre-requisites are clear in Baan Mankong, the future, however, has a huge question mark, in the creation of community networks that have little accountability to government or its respective institutions, what will be the outcome of a community network that could challenge on a political level? what happens when it begins making demands that the Baan Mankong program cannot sustain and what happens when the empowered citizens shift towards participating in the global phenomena of the market?\n\nIts one assurance perhaps is that the country is homogeneous, that a majority of the people are Thai, and there is a collective understanding as a nation although there is a shift in the political sphere of Thailand. These conditions seldom exist in other counties, torn between heterogeneous communities, corruption and in-fighting. Collective action on community scale, let alone on City scale and national scale are still distant utopic visions for many communities in developing countries.\n\nFor me, Schumacher, if he was here and alive, would applaud this program. It embodies everything that he believes in and more, the need for small and powerful steps rather than global and utopian ideals, staying practical and quick on the feet, learning as you go along, and tapping into the local knowledge and wisdom that already exists rather than trailblazing ideas that will often not apply. Continuing this thread of practice, building momentum, continuing the creation of small communities empowered to take action rather than a focus on creating policies and strategies for scaling up, will ensure that communities and people will lead the change, not governments and ideal planners. There is much to be learnt and understood from this project, most importantly, its ability to really put people at the centre of development and letting them make the decisions for their communities.\n\nThis is a meditative and contemplative reaction to the last 20 days.. and reading back, it seems I myself am empowered to continue the journey that I have begun all those years back.. 🙂"
