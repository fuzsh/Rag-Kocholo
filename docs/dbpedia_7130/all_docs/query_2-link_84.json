All proceeds raised will be equally distributed between the performing musicians and Bangladeshi charity organisation Friendship, which provides healthcare for climate change refugees and promotes women’s rights in Bangladesh.\n\nCONCERT FROM BANGLADESH IS A MIXED REALITY MUSIC CONCERT, USING CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY TO TAKE AUDIENCES ON A VIRTUAL AUDIO-VISUAL JOURNEY THROUGH BANGLADESH PAST AND PRESENT, ENCOMPASSING MYSTICAL BAUL SINGERS FROM RURAL KUSHTIA, EXPERIMENTAL ELECTRONICS AND HIP HOP FROM THE STREETS OF DHAKA.\n\nConcert From Bangladeshis a groundbreaking mixed reality digital collaboration between UBIK Productions (London) and Samdani Art Foundation (Dhaka) supported by the British Council Digital Collaboration Fund. The organisations have commissioned acclaimed British-South Asian artist Shezad Dawood to create a virtual reality stage for a concert released on 1 August 2021 via Pioneer Works’ (NYC) website, expanding on the 50 year legacy of Concert For Bangladesh: the original charity concert initiated by Ravi Shankar and George Harrison of Beatles' fame, in aid of the relief effort and refugee crisis during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971.\n\nCo-curated by Diana Campbell, Artistic Director of the Samdani Art Foundation (SAF), with Dhaka-born music producer and artist Enayet Kabir, together with assistant curators Ruxmini Choudhury and Shoummo Saha, Concert From Bangladesh updates the 1971 concert to showcase a wealth of talent across varied Bangladeshi musical traditions – from mystical Baul singing to experimental electronics and socially engaged Dhaka hip hop – and raise funds for the Bangladeshi climate change and human rights charity Friendship.\n\nThe concept was developed by Campbelltogether with multiple collaborators including Dawood. In the words of SAF Founder Nadia Samdani, \"As Bangladesh celebrates 50 years of independence, we are delighted to be a part of producing a work that allows the world to listen to the wealth of music and culture found in our country, and to reconsider the role that music and art can play in banding people together to fight for a better and more equal future.\" Miranda Sharp, UBIK Productions Director, says,“We’re thrilled to be working with SAF and\n\nShezad Dawood on this multidisciplinary, transnational project that pushes the boundaries of art and music production and develops new digital collaborative workflows.”\n\nConcert From Bangladeshwill go live to audiences on the Pioneer Works’ digital platform on 1 August 2021, accompanied by live events at Yorkshire Sculpture Park (Wakefield)as part of Yorkshire Sculpture International and Pioneer Works (NYC), 50 years on from the original concert. Additional events will take place with Chisenhale Gallery (London), at Leeds City Varieties Music Hall (Leeds) and Srihatta Samdani Art Centre and Sculpture Park (Sylhet). These institutions are located in significant diasporic or rural Bangladeshi areas and will further de-centre and democratise the project’s reach, amplifying the experience to diverse Bangladeshi and international communities.\n\nThe concert will take viewers on an expansive sonic journey spanning six centuries, beginning with renowned Baul singer Arif Baul accompanied by instrumental virtuosos Nazrul Islam, Saidur Rahman, and Sohel. This will be followed by a piece composed by Enayet and Nishit Dey exploring the shared musical language between Nazrul sangeet, classical raga and 90s jungle, by blending cutting edge electronic production and arrangements by Enayet, Provhat Rahman and Siaminium, with classical raga and Nazrul sangeet vocals by Meerashri Arshee and Moumita Haque, Bansuri flute by Jawaad Mustakim Al Muballig and sitar performance by Nishit Dey. The concert will end with the Bangladeshi hip hop duo Tabib Mahmud and 12-year-old Gully Boy Rana, whose socially engaged lyrics highlight some of the pressing issues the Concert aims to fundraise for.\n\nShot against a green screen at 3rd Space Studio by a Bangladeshi team in Dhaka, Concert From Bangladesh will feature the musicians performing against shifting virtual sets that will immerse audiences in vibrant Dhaka streets, and transport them to the riverbanks of Gorai River Kushtia via mangrove ecosystems and Somapura Mahavihara – one of the best known monasteries in the Indian Subcontinent built in the 8th century AD –, culminating with a performance in the iconic Beauty Boarding, a historically vibrant literary hub in Dhaka and a meeting place for intellectuals to this day.\n\nThe performances will be interspersed with archival and contemporary documentary footage, and the concert will be amplified by Augmented Reality assets, including a free filter activated through audiences’ phones and laptops, bringing 3D objects from the screen into viewers' immediate surroundings. The Concert’s graphic identity is developed by long-time Samdani Art Foundation collaborator Fraser Muggeridge Studio.\n\nConcert From Bangladesh will revisit the history of solidarity embedded in the historical Concert For Bangladesh: a concert album and ethically produced merchandise will be made available via the online streaming platform on Pioneer Works.

The designs include symbols of tigers and Paharpur, which are anchored in Bangladeshi culture and the concert itself. All proceeds from the sales of merchandise will support the work of Friendship, an NGO supporting and empowering climate change refugees in Bangladesh, as well as the musicians who participated in this project. The organic tee and sweatshirt are produced in collaboration with No Sweat, a UK based anti-sweatshop campaign and clothing brand that partners with the garment factory, Oporajeo (meaning invincible in Bangla), a worker's initiative in Bangladesh that emerged in the wake of the Rana Plaza tragedy to promote ethical factory practices as an alternative to sweatshops. The scarves are handwoven and hand-embroidered by women in the chars of Bangladesh (riverine islands made of silt which are vulnerable to flooding) through Friendship, and each scarf will therefore be unique and carry the traces of its maker. Merchandise will be produced on demand and mailed to buyers in late 2021.\n\nCREDITS\n\nShezad Dawood Artist / Director / Visual Concept\n\nDiana Campbell Curator / Concept Designer\n\nEnayet Kabir Co-curator\n\nMiranda Sharp Producer\n\nInês Geraldes Cardoso Assistant Producer\n\nRuxmini Choudhury Assistant Curator, Research and Archive Producer\n\nSazzad Hossain SAF Production Lead\n\nAmit Ashraf DOP\n\nHimel Tariq Line Producer\n\nShoummo Saha Assistant Curator, Audio Coordinator\n\nAdittya Arzu Recording Engineer- Dhaka\n\namoeba Visual interpretations and code\n\nMikayl Dawood Editor\n\nRupert Clervaux Audio Mixing and Mastering Engineer\n\nFraser Muggeridge Graphic Design\n\nRuxmini Choudhury Translations and Subtitles\n\nMUSIC & AUDIO\n\nEnayet SFX\n\nRupert Clervaux Mastering Engineer\n\nGREEN SCREEN SHOOT CREW\n\nArifuzzaman DOP- MD.\n\nNivan Hossain Assistant Director\n\nFerari Sumon Production Manager\n\nMosarof Hossain Gaffer\n\nNazmul Focus Puller\n\n3rd Space Studio Venue"
