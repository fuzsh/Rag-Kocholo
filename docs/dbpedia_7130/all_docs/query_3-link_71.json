        "text": "LITTLE BADMAN, is a funny and fast-paced adventure story created by comedy duo Humza Arshad and Henry White and with illustrations from Aleksei Bitskoff. Full of mischief, silliness and with a delightful cast of characters the series is sure to appeal to fans of traditional British Asian comedy.\n\nHumza Khan, he is the greatest eleven-year-old rapper Eggington has ever known: he is Little Badman and he is destined to be rich and famous. But when Humza’s music teacher is taken ill his dreams are put on hold. His Auntie has stepped in as substitute, and nobody seems to care about the unorthodox teaching because of the endless sweet treats. As other teachers start to disappear, with more Aunties appearing in their place, Humza knows something isn’t right. With the help of his elderly Uncle and friends Umer and Wendy, Humza discovers that the suspicious Aunties might not be as friendly as they seem. Now he must find a way to destroy them before they take over the world…\n\n“I love my aunties, but any Asian kid will tell you, a gang of aunties is a force to be reckoned with and to make them extra powerful and extra scary was a lot of fun. Exaggerating some of my childhood experiences and turning it into a kids adventure is a bit of dream.” - Humza Arshad\n\nHumza Arshad (@HumzaProduction) is one of the UK’s most popular British Asian personalities. After graduating from Richmond Drama School Arshad wrote, directed and edited an episode called Diary of a Badman. Over 90 million views of the series later, Humza became the first British YouTuber to have his own scripted comedy series on BBC Three in the mockumentary series Coconut. Equally important to Humza has been using his influence and comedy for a greater purpose. In 2015, Humza partnered with the UK Counter Terrorism Unit and he is YouTube’s first ambassador for the Creators for Change campaign. Humza has spoken and shared the stage with the likes of Will Smith, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, Kevin Hart and Whoopi Goldberg.\n\nHenry White is a comedy writer working in television and children’s fiction. He grew up in west London and began his career in online animation. Henry went on to write and direct adverts for a number of British comedy channels, before working as a sitcom writer.\n\n​\n\nAleksei Bitskoff is an Estonia-born British contemporary illustrator, character designer and children's book illustrator.\n\nLITTLE BADMAN AND THE INVASION OF THE KILLER AUNTIES will publish on 7th March 2019 in Puffin paperback, ebook and audiobook\n\n...ends...\n\n·Nelson’s Column transformed into a giant set of wickets as cricket takes over Trafalgar Square to mark 100 days until the start of the tournament\n\n·ICC Cricket World Cup Trophy Tour, driven by Nissan, commences 100-day tour of England and Wales and will be at over 100 locations and events before arriving back in London ready for the opening match on May 30\n\n·Managing Director, Steve Elworthy: “The tournament is within touching distance now and it’s amazing to see the takeover of the iconic London location of Trafalgar Square to mark 100 days to go!

The Asian Awards is a pioneering event that has quickly evolved into the most prestigious global acknowledgement of pan-Asian success across all walks of life, emphasising inspiring accomplishments and highlighting international role models in the fields of business, sport, entertainment, philanthropy and popular arts & culture.\n\nThis year The Asian Awards in partnership with Payswiff honoured Bana al-Abed with the Rising Star Award. When eight-year old Bana al-Abed took to Twitter to describe the horrors she and her family were experiencing in war-torn Syria, her heartrending messages touched the world and gave a voice to millions of children. Bana has since become known globally for her work to create awareness and direct attention towards the problems in her home, and earlier this year was invited to the Oscars to stand in support of children in war.\n\nOn collecting her award, Bana Al-Abed said: “It is my pleasure to be here with all of you tonight. I am happy that the voice of the Syrian children is being heard. This award is for all the children who lived in war. A child should have the right to live and grow up in peace and a child should have the right to education. I want to thank The Asian Awards for giving me this honour.”\n\nPaul Sagoo, Founder of The Asian Awards, said: “The Asian Awards is an event which honours exceptional individuals who have captured the attention of the world. Bana al-Abed is a perfect example of exactly that and at only 8 years old she has bravely shared her perspective on one of the biggest humanitarian crises in history. I am so glad that she accepted our invitation to attend this year’s Asian Awards and collect the Rising Star Award in recognition of her resilience, unconquerable courage, and hope for herself and for other children around the world who are victims and refugees of war.”\n\nThe 8th Asian Awards paid tribute and honoured legendary Bollywood actress Sridevi, who’s passing earlier this year was a tragic loss to Indian cinema. The timeless actress, who is regarded as one of India’s most iconic stars rose to worldwide fame in the 80’s with several starring roles in films such as Himmatwala, Jaani Dost, Ghar Sansar, Mr India and many more. Winner of the prestigious Padma Shri and voted India’s Greatest Actress in 100 years in a national centenary poll in 2013, Sridevi receives the posthumous honour of Outstanding Achievement in Cinema at this year’s Asian Awards.\n\nPaul Sagoo, Founder of The Asian Awards adds: “Sridevi was a remarkable figure in the Indian cinema industry. An icon on-screen, she was the greatest actress of her time in a golden generation for Indian cinema. Her untimely passing earlier this year reminded the world of her talent and sheer brilliance in her art and highlighted her iconic status. We are honoured to pay tribute to Sridevi and celebrate her astonishing career at the 8th Asian Awards.”\n\nAward-winning British TV star Anita Rani picked up the Outstanding Achievement in Television and on collecting gave an impassioned speech about her ground-breaking broadcasting career thus far and representation in the media industry, closing: “Thank you to The Asian Awards, I’m going to use this to break more glass ceilings.”\n\nOther winners on the night included legendary Pakistani squash player Jahangir Khan, Entrepreneur of the Year Sunny Varkey and Ramesh and Pratibha Sachdev who were awarded Philanthropist of the Year. Pratibha Gai picked up the Science and Technology Award for her pioneering work in electron microscopes, whilst Arundhati Bhattacharya, the first woman to chair the State Bank Of India, won Business Leader of the Year and Nepalese District Police Chief SP Kiran Bajracharya was honoured with the Public Servant of the Year Award. Finally Korean boy-band BTS, the K-Pop phenomenon who have conquered the globe in recent months and have a huge fan following worldwide, were awarded the Outstanding Achievement in Music Award.\n\nThe Asian Awards was founded in 2010 to celebrate the outstanding achievements and excellence of pan-Asians across the globe. This year’s event is hosted once again by comic genius, and winner of the 2015 Outstanding Achievement in Television award, Sanjeev Bhaskar. The Asian Awards will partner with UK based charity One Family for the 2nd consecutive year.\n\nThe event will be attended by the who’s who of politicians, dignitaries, celebrities, industrialists and influencers from across all sectors.
