        "text": "#FreeToBeMe. #southasianheritagemonth The thought is always there, lurking in the background, people will think I have truly gone mad. Sometimes the mad ideas do make sense. Having the game of Kabaddi was the most fun we have all had for a long long time. So much laughing, shouting, making up the rules, physical exercise - none of us had so much cardio work out (!) for a long time. Followed by eating together, talking, relaxing - 'adda' - time to hang out with no worries or concerns. The saying goes, 'laughter is the best medicine'. That is true, with a little bit of time and space for ourselves. #FreeToBeMe #southasianheritagemonth\n\nMaking Our Way A throw away comment in a recent conversation made me think, 'well, what have I really, really done in the last few months - to be specific, January - to date?' First point of correction - not I. What have WE Oitij-jo done as a team. Central to all our work: 1) creativity in all its forms & more for all 2) equitable collaborative engagement and partnership with multiple layers of stakeholders simultaneously and continuously 3) sustainability - financial and environmental 4) inclusive and open to all to interact with outputs of the work produced; whilst focusing narrowly on the demographic criteria of the, 'active designer-makers'. Work So Far: January 1) \" I Don't Call Enough but I am Here Now\" - a contemporary art installation by artist #LaisulHoque , curated by #JannatHusaain and production support by #GabrielOrengoWalter.
