Box 91Rue des Bains 33GenevaSwitzerland\n\nAnnex 122\n\n8 Section 11 of the Constitution provides for a certain separation of powers, including the independence of the judiciary (although qualified),54 and Chapter 6 of the Constitution describes the jurisdiction of Myanmar’s courts. The Constitution recognizes the right to redress in accordance with principles of judicial independence and due process,55 including the right to appeal judicial decisions,56 and to seek judicial review of administrative decisions by executive powers, including those of ministers, civil servants and statutory bodies.57 Procedures established to implement legislation must be in conformity with the Constitution.58 Where constitutional provisions appear to conflict with one another, the Constitutional Tribunal may, under certain conditions, provide an authoritative interpretation;59alternatively, constitutional reforms can clarify the law. Myanmar’s Constitution recognizes obligations arising out of international treaties, including human rights instruments binding on the country, so violations of the State’s international human rights law obligations are also unconstitutional.60 4.2 The 1982 Citizenship Law The 1982 Law is read together with three separate bylaws, the 1983 Citizenship Procedures, that guide implementation of the law: Notification 13/83 (with respect to full citizenship), Notification 14/83 (with respect to “associate” citizenship) and Notification 15/83 (with respect to “naturalized” citizenship). Together these four legal instruments contain an unwieldy total of 26 chapters, with 251 sections and 51 forms. Governance The 1982 Law authorizes the establishment of a ministerial-level “Central Body,” with broad determinative powers, including for revocation and termination of citizenship.61 Its four members are the ministers of Defence, of Home Affairs, of Immigration and Population and of Foreign Affairs (two of whom are military appointees).62 While the Ministry of Immigration and Population is a key authority with respect to citizenship, the Law and its procedures list a range of other State actors and authorities with responsibilities, from Village Tract or Ward officials all the way up to the Union level.63 The President or Union Government (formerly “Council of State”)64 has a range of powers, including: “to decide whether any ethnic group is national or not” (section 4); to confer or revoke citizenship of an individual (section 8); to set out procedures (section 75); and to review decisions of the Central Body (section 70).65 With respect to this, it is worth noting that the four members of the Central Body are also members of the Union Government with relatively powerful portfolios. Categories of citizenship The 1982 Law introduced a three-tiered hierarchy of citizenship categories: (full) “citizen,” “associate citizen” and “naturalized citizen”. Each category is based on different criteria for citizenship and involves different legal privileges, protections and penalties (criminal penalties in the case of “associate” and “naturalized citizens”). Full citizenship is conferred under section 3 of the 1982 Law to persons considered to be “nationals such as the Kachin, Kayah, Karen, Chin, Burman, Mon, Rakhine or Shan” groups, which the 2008 Constitution broadly refers to as “national races”.66 Full citizens enjoy legal rights and protections to the extent prescribed in Myanmar law. Members of groups falling outside “national races”, but who are descendants of families permanently living in Myanmar since before the first Anglo-Burmese War of 1824, may also qualify for full citizenship.67 Those who are not members of an officially designated ethnic group may also be full citizens, provided they were citizens when the 1982 Law entered into force,68 or by meeting criteria listed in section 7.69 “Associate” and “naturalized citizenship” categories generally apply to persons who are not considered to be a member of a “national race” group, and/or who do not have two parents who are citizens, and who therefore do not qualify as “citizens by birth.”70 The key distinction between these two categories is whether or not the applicant, or their parent/s, had applied for citizenship under the 1948 Union Citizenship Act prior to the enactment of the 1982 Law.71 Chapters 3 and 4 of the 1982 Law list ancestral scenarios that qualify or disqualify persons from these Annex 122\n\n9 citizenship categories. Laws existing before 1982 are relevant to determining if a person or their family members were considered as citizens prior to the enactment of the 1982 Law. The relevant ones include provisions of the 1947 Constitution, the 1948 Citizenship Act and the 1974 Constitution.72 The 1982 Law grants “associate” and “naturalized citizens” the rights of full citizens “with the exception of the rights stipulated from time to time by the (President or Union Government).”73 In addition to this qualification of their rights under the 1982 Law, and the limitations on their rights included in the Constitution, a range of grounds are included for possible revocation of their citizenship. Section 8(b) permits the revocation of “associate” or “naturalized citizenship” “in the interests of the State.” More specific grounds for revocation of citizenship include failure to provide a written pledge of allegiance to the State,74 “showing disaffection or disloyalty to the State by any act or speech or otherwise”,75 or “committing an offence involving moral turpitude…”76 Revocation of citizenship may also accompany sentencing upon conviction for certain criminal offences prescribed in the 1982 Law (see below). In comparison, for persons who have lawfully obtained full citizenship, the only grounds for citizenship revocation are if the person takes citizenship of another country.77 Unlike the 2008 Constitution, the 1982 Law explicitly excludes, or contemplates the exclusion of, certain individuals from qualifying for any citizenship. Exclusions are generally, although not uniformly, subject to administrative discretion wielded by authorities at various levels. This can include, in circumstances prescribed in law, the child of a citizen and a non-citizen,78 and the adopted child of citizens if the birth parents are non-citizens.79 Persons who have been a citizen or would otherwise qualify for citizenship but have taken citizenship of another country have no right to reapply for citizenship.80 Marriage to a Myanmar citizen does not qualify a foreigner for citizenship; 81 conceptually, use of the term “naturalization” in Myanmar law is somewhat misleading, as there are limited, if any, pathways for foreigners to gain citizenship, unlike in many other jurisdictions. Criminal offences and penalties The 1982 Law and its 1983 procedures define certain criminal offences, and set out severe penalties upon conviction, including, for example, 10 years’ imprisonment and a fine for failure to surrender a cancelled certificate of citizenship,82 or 15 years’ imprisonment and a fine for forgery.83 Section 18 of the Law stipulates criminal penalties and revocation of citizenship for persons who are considered to have “acquired citizenship by making a false representation or by concealment.” This can only apply to persons not considered as a “citizen by birth.”84 Persons who have lawfully acquired full citizenship are exempt from criminal penalties, except if they abetted a crime.85 A range of other criminal penalties may apply only to “associate” and naturalized citizens;86 as noted, these can be imposed alongside revocation of citizenship. Non-citizens may also be subject to criminal penalties under the 1982 Law and its procedures, as well as under other applicable laws.87 In cases involving an alleged criminal offence, the 1982 Law and its procedures reaffirm the role of the judiciary,88 and the applicability of the Code of Criminal Procedure89 (note: section 71 of the 1982 Law may affect a prosecution or appeal).90 Decision-making and appeals Chapter 7 of the 1982 Law allows persons to appeal a decision of the Central Body regarding citizenship91 to the Union Government (formerly “Council of Ministers”).92 Various authorities at multiple levels of government also play roles in the appeal process, mainly by exercising procedural functions of an administrative nature, such as by receiving and processing appeal applications.93 Under Chapter 5 of the 1983 procedures, an application to appeal a decision of the Central Body can be lodged with local authorities, who are responsible to transmit this to the Union Government. Section 71 of the 1982 Law states that “no reason need be given by organizations invested with authority under this Law in matters carried out under this Law.” The Law also states that a Union Government’s decision regarding a citizenship matter “is final”, thus notionally exempt from judicial review, according to the common Annex 122\n\n10 interpretation of this provision in Myanmar (see analysis in part five).94 As noted above, the four members of the Central Body are also part of the Union Government. 4.3 Other applicable laws, rules and regulations As with most areas of law, the 1982 Law cannot be viewed in isolation, as it closely intersects with constitutional provisions and other legislation, as well as the State’s obligations under international human rights law. The law regulating citizenship is particularly important because it can determine or influence the ability of individuals to access a range of rights and services provided for in other laws. In Myanmar, laws with particularly significant reference to citizenship arrangements tend to include implicit or explicit references to the 1982 Law. For example, section 10 of the 1993 Child Law states that “Every child shall have the right to citizenship in accordance with the provisions of the existing law” (drafts of the 2019 Child Rights Bill, seen by the ICJ, contain a similar provision).95 Interpretations of this provision, including by government officials, typically privilege the existing law – in this case the 1982 Citizenship Law – over the primary objective of the Child Law, which is to implement Myanmar’s obligations under Convention on the Rights of the Child (see below).96 Various other instruments exist that are specifically related to citizenship, including procedures and guidance. Their legal basis is generally unclear, and most are not publicly available. These instruments include, inter alia, an oft-cited “list of 135” ethnic groups which appears to have emerged in 1990,97 and the 2014 Immigration Department Handbook, which compiles previously issued directives.98 Terminologies included within these instruments, such as the so-called “mixed-blood nationals” category of citizens (Burmese: ေသြးေႏွာႏုုိင္ငံသားမ်ား / thwey naw naing nan tha mya), are widely applied in practice throughout Myanmar,99 and are common vernacular of officials at the highest levels of government.100 Procedures governing applications for citizenship “scrutiny”, registration and the issuance or revocation of documentation, including for National Registration Cards and cards associated with a “citizenship verification process” are also understood to be informed and guided by these other instruments, in addition to laws and bylaws. 5. Findings 5.1 The 2008 Constitution The narrow framing of “fundamental rights” in Chapter 8 of the Constitution, and the restrictions placed upon these rights, including for citizens, run contrary to principles of non-discrimination, democratic governance and the State’s obligations under international human rights law. This necessitates constitutional reforms to introduce a more expansive definition of “fundamental rights” which includes greater protections from discrimination regardless of a person’s citizenship status, consistent with international law and standards including the obligations binding on Myanmar. The Constitution generally limits “fundamental rights” to citizens. This is contrary to the principle of equality before the law and equal protection of the law in section 347 of the same instrument, which states: “The Union shall guarantee any person [emphasis added] to enjoy equal rights before the law and shall equally provide legal protection.” For example, the rights to health, education and livelihoods, which the Constitution guarantees, are restricted to citizens, in violation of the State’s obligations to respect and to protect these rights under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The constitutional right to freedom of religion or belief is also limited to citizens only, contrary to international human rights law, including the UDHR. These illustrative examples demonstrate that restrictions are also incompatible with rule of law principles of non-discrimination and non-arbitrariness. Such restrictions should removed, to protect and guarantee in law the “fundamental rights” of all persons within Myanmar, regardless of citizenship status, with exceptions limited to specific political rights, consistent with article 21 of the UDHR.101 Constitutional provisions for persons recognized as citizens, that restrict “fundamental rights” of a political nature on the basis of their familial relationship with a non-citizen, are also arbitrary and discriminatory. Perhaps the most glaring example of this is section 59(f), which appears to have been designed specifically to exclude\n\nAnnex 122\n\nAnnex 123\n\nPhysicians for Human Rights, Shot While Fleeing: Rohingya Disabled by Myanmar Authorities’ Targeted Violence (June 2019)\n\nShot While FleeingJune 2019Physicians for Human RightsRohingya Disabled by Myanmar Authorities’ Targeted Violence\n\nAnnex 123\n\n3 Shot While Fleeing: Rohingya Disabled by Myanmar Authorities’ Targeted Violence Physicians for Human Rights phr.org Executive Summary In August 2017, Myanmar security forces and Rakhine Buddhist civilians attacked hundreds of villages in northern Rakhine state, massacring thousands of Rohingya Muslim residents and burning their homes to the ground.1 As of January 2019, that targeted violence and ongoing abuses had prompted approximately 740,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh, where they remain.2 Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) has collected extensive medical evidence of the human rights violations committed against the Rohingya in those attacks. A PHR report published in July 2018 presented clear medical evidence to corroborate survivors’ accounts of how shootings, beatings, stabbings, and other forms of violence inflicted upon the Rohingya in the village of Chut Pyin made it an emblematic example of the targeted, systematic violence that unfolded in hundreds of other villages across northern Rakhine state.3 This supplemental report focuses on a separate, underreported outcome of the August 2017 attacks on the Rohingya: survivors who suffered physical impairments from their wounds that will potentially become long-term disabilities.4 These disabilities will hinder these survivors’ ease and freedom of movement, limit their ability to seek gainful employment, and otherwise obstruct their ability to live productive, pain-free lives. The plight of these disabled Rohingya survivors highlights how the ruthless violence that the Myanmar security forces and others inflicted on the Rohingya in August 2017 will have a decades-long, painful, life-altering legacy for potentially thousands of survivors and their families. PHR approached 120 survivors living in refugee camps in Bangladesh to request interviews and interviewed a total of 114 survivors who gave their consent to be interviewed. Ninety survivors out of that pool of 114 reported physical injuries resulting from the violence and consented to and subsequently underwent clinical evaluations by PHR medical partners. In total, 43 of these injured survivors were left with long-term disabilities as a result of violence they experienced in or around August 2017. The vast majority of Rohingya who were disabled as a result of that targeted violence were gunned down as they fled attackers. Many of the bullet wounds have resulted in permanent neurological impairment that limits limb function and causes severe and persistent pain: both can make simple tasks like walking, grasping a pot, or lifting a bag of rice extremely painful or impossible. Other survivors suffered shrapnel wounds from grenades or were injured by landmines laid in fields surrounding Rohingya villages in an apparently deliberate strategy to inflict maximum harm on Rohingya fleeing attack. Some Rohingya survivors who were unable to flee were reportedly seized by Myanmar security forces and brutally beaten, kicked, stabbed, raped, and killed. The Rohingya profiled in this report are the survivors: unlike the estimated 10,000 killed in the attacks,5 these people escaped death by being rescued by relatives or by taking refuge in surrounding forests or nearby villages before making the long overland journey to Bangladesh. In many cases documented by PHR, survivors said they had heard that it was unsafe to seek medical treatment inside Myanmar because Annex 123\n\n4 Shot While Fleeing: Rohingya Disabled by Myanmar Authorities’ Targeted Violence Physicians for Human Rights phr.org doctors would allegedly report injured Rohingya to Myanmar authorities. This fear, combined with a longstanding de facto policy of denying health care services to Rohingya, meant that survivors often resorted to traditional natural remedies for wound treatment and pain relief during the days- or weeks-long trek to refuge in Bangladesh. PHR clinicians have concluded that this lack of adequate medical attention often exacerbated already severe wounds: these injuries were often worsened by delayed surgery, while infections led to amputations that earlier treatment might have prevented. PHR asserts that the attacks by Myanmar security forces should be investigated as crimes against humanity and supports recommendations by a United Nations fact-finding mission to refer Myanmar to the International Criminal Court or an ad hoc criminal tribunal for accountability for those abuses. PHR is convinced that, by inflicting indiscriminate injury and thus long-term disability on many Rohingya, Myanmar security forces also violated the right to health and the right to work of their Rohingya victims. Myanmar now has forward-looking redress obligations toward Rohingya who were disabled by the 2017 attacks, including guarantees of financial compensation for those who can no longer work; free and comprehensive access to medical services and education; and long-term rehabilitation services for disabled Rohingya if and when the Myanmar government and the international community can guarantee their safe and voluntary return to Myanmar. 6, 7 Muriam’s Story Five-year-old Muriam Khathu (Profile 5) was at home with her parents and grandparents when soldiers began approaching their village, firing rifles and throwing and firing grenades at some of the Rohingya houses. The family ran out of the house. Soldiers shot and killed Muriam’s father, while several members of Myanmar’s security forces grabbed the 40-pound Muriam and threw her against a wall. They began stomping on her and kicking her with their combat boots, ignoring the pleas of Muriam's mother and grandparents that they stop. When Muriam’s assailants moved on, Muriam's family took shelter in the forest near their village before setting out on the long journey to Bangladesh. They carried Muriam on a makeshift stretcher, but she still cried out in pain every time she was moved. Once in Bangladesh, Muriam was sent to a hospital, but the damage could not be undone: she had suffered a pelvic fracture and serious neurological injury as a result of the attack. She could move her legs only slightly and was unable to walk or bear any weight on them. Months after the attack, she said she still felt pain whenever she moved. According to a clinical examination carried out The vast majority of Rohingya who were disabled … were gunned down as they fled attackers. Many of the bullet wounds have resulted in permanent neurological impairment that limits limb function and causes severe and persistent pain: both can make simple tasks like walking, grasping a pot, or lifting a bag of rice extremely painful or impossible. Annex 123\n\n5 Shot While Fleeing: Rohingya Disabled by Myanmar Authorities’ Targeted Violence Physicians for Human Rights phr.org by PHR medical partners on the ground, the presence of ongoing pain and Muriam’s inability to walk more than two months after the injury indicated a low likelihood that Muriam would ever be able to walk or move without pain. If Muriam and her family return to northern Rakhine state, many difficulties await. The rural region faces severe food insecurity and its residents are highly dependent on subsistence farming. Muriam will most likely be limited in her ability to work or do the physically demanding chores intrinsic to life in rural Rakhine State. Muriam is unable to play, walk, or even sit up. Her mother is responsible for basic personal hygiene tasks such as helping her use the toilet. Muriam will most likely have extremely limited medical support if she returns to Myanmar: the Rohingya have faced state-sponsored discrimination in accessing health services for years.8 Even if Myanmar were to end such discriminatory practices, there are fewer than 1,400 hospital beds in Rakhine state to service a population of more than three million people,9 imposing extremely limited access to services. The lack of adequate support services for people with disabilities in Rakhine state will likely place severe burdens on their caregiver family members. Longtime caregivers of people with disabilities are at high risk of poor health outcomes themselves, including depression and shortened life-expectancy due to the stresses imposed by caregiving.10 For those like Muriam whose interviews are documented in this report, the violence directed at them over a period of days in 2017 has resulted in the high likelihood of a lifetime of chronic pain and disability. Members of Myanmar’s security forces grabbed the 40-pound Muriam and threw her against a wall. They began stomping on her and kicking her with their combat boots, ignoring the pleas of Muriam's mother and grandparents that they stop.… [Today,] Muriam is unable to walk, play, or even sit up.

In 1991, Rohingyareceived ‘White Cards’ as a temporary identification and then in 2015 ‘White Cards’ were abolished and the Rohingya received a paperreceipt in return as an evidence when they handed them in to authorities.Burma’s authorities have made any Rohingya repatriation conditional on Rohingya participation in the National Verification Cards (NVC)scheme.NVCs deny Rohingya their right to self-identify as Rohingya.Current NVC holders in Rakhine State are still victims of human rights abuse including tight restrictions on their ability to freely travel.NVCs are a key instrument of Burmese’s apartheid system in Rakhine State.NVCs must not be a condition for Rohingya repatriation to their homes in Burma.MethodologyThe research for this report was conducted between February and June of 2019. 25 Rohingya civilians were interviewed in Rakhine State andrefugee camps in Bangladesh. Interviews in Bangladesh were conducted in person by BHRN staff. Because of restrictions in Rakhine State,interviewees in Rakhine State were conducted over the phone or through written correspondence. BHRN focused on refugees and civilians whocame from or currently live in affected areas, particularly Rathedaung, Buthidaung, Maungdaw and Sittwe Townships. The questions posed tothe interviewees were open ended to avoid leading them to any particular conclusions. Refugees interviewed for this report were interviewed inRohingya language and informed of the purpose of the interview. Most interviews in Rakhine State were conducted in Rohingya languageexcept for those with community leaders or NGO workers who spoke fluent English. Interviewees who gave pictures for this report gaveinformed consent to do so. BHRN has declined to publish any photographs or personal details of persons still living inside of Burma to helpensure their safety.BackgroundThe Rohingya are a Muslim group from Burma’s Rakhine state. Despite centuries of connection to the Rakhine State area, the Rohingya’sheritage is disputed by Burma’s government and military. Rohingya have been denied Burmese citizenship and the rights and protections thataccompany it.While there is compelling evidence the Rohingya were acknowledged as citizens of Burma during the democratic era prior to the1962 military coup, since then the Rohingya’s citizenship standing has been consistently diminished. The 1982 Burma Citizenship Law has beenweaponised by Burma’s authorities to deny legitimate Rohingya citizenship claims.Burma’s citizenship laws are based on group rights associated with ethnicity, race, and religion, and key rights accrue to groups accepted asresidents in the country before the start of the colonial era in 1823. While British chroniclers documented meetings with Rohingya (spelledRooinga at that time) in Burma during the pre-colonial era, Burma’s authorities do not accept the Rohingya as a group resident in Burma priorto the British colonial period. For the Rohingya, the consequences of this have been dire.Today the Rohingya are collectively without Burmese citizenship rights and many Rohingya in Burma live in pitiable circumstances where theyare forced to endure deplorable restrictions on travel, economic activity, marriage and pregnancy outside of marriage. The authorities’ strategyof separating Buddhist and Muslim communities means that, for the Rohingya, large parts of northern Rakhine state resemble an open prison,The 1982 Burma Citizenship Law has been weaponised by Burma’s authorities to deny legitimate Rohingya citizenship claims.3\n\nAnnex 124\n\nor worse. Nationalist politicians have called for the incarceration of Rakhine state’s Rohingya in concentration camps, and today as many as120, 000 Rohingya are confined indefinitely to camps surrounded by armed guards.As well as violating Rohingya human rights, Burma’s authorities reject the Rohingya’s right to self-identify using the Rohingya name and insteadseek to label the Rohingya as foreigners. Burma’s authorities refused, for instance, to enumerate any resident claiming their identity asRohingya during the 2014 national census process.The widely reported Burmese military operation against the Rohingya during 2017 led to the forced migration of around 700, 000 Rohingyafrom Burma to Bangladesh. This military operation was characterised by crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocidal intent, and theforced migration it created brought the decades of human rights violations of the Rohingya by Burma’s government and military to theattention of the global mainstream. Around 300 Rohingya villages were utterly destroyed during this Burmese military action which the UN HighCommissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein described as, “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing”. A Preliminary Examination bythe chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court into Burma’s 2017 forced migration of the Rohingya is on going.Rohingya’s Kutupalong refugee camp is the world’s largest and there are now more than one million Rohingya living in temporary camps nearBurma’s border with Bangladesh. Bangladesh is not a signatory to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, does not formallyrecognise Rohingya as refugees insisting their camps are temporary and has negotiated with Burma’s government for a Rohingya repatriation.Any repatriation would require the cooperation of the United Nations.While Rohingya who are now resident in refugee camps have frequently made clear that Burma is their home and has been their people’s homefor centuries, their repatriation is challenging because they understandably fear returning to face further violence and abuse from Burma’sunrepentant government and military.The evidence from northern Rakhine State indicates that conditions for Rohingya there have not improved since the 2017 forced migration, andstrict rights restrictions remain in place. Rohingya within Burma continue to have their lives restricted and they are denied rights to freedom ofmovement. Any return is made challenging because Burma’s authorities have blocked humanitarian actors, independent investigators, andforeign media from much of northern Rakhine State.Rohingya repatriation is made difficult too because Burma’s authorities have remodelled many destroyed Rohingya villages, obliteratingevidence of previous Rohingya residency there. In at least one instance, a former Rohingya village has been remodelled as a Burmese militarybase. Burma’s authorities have indicated they would require returning Rohingya to initially live in camps surrounded by barbed wire fences andarmed guards. Considering 120, 000 of those Rohingya displaced in Rakhine State during 2012 are still confined to camps, there is a highpotential returning Rohingya would face a similar fate. Further complicating Rohingya repatriation is ongoing military action in northern RakhineState where the Burma military is in conflict with a mostly Buddhist ethnic armed militant group, the Arakan Army.Yet, despite no noticeable improvement in conditions for Rohingya in Rakhine state, the Burmese government has made Rohingya repatriationconditional on Rohingya participation in the National Verification Card (NVC) process.NVCs have a deeply problematic history in Burma. The authorities refuse to allow participants to self-identify as Rohingya on these identitycards. NVCs have historically recorded Rohingya using religious labels (Muslim/Islam) or foreign identifiers (Bengali). NVCs are widely regardedas another method by Burma’s authorities to diminish the citizenship standing and future rights of Rohingya by indicating they are foreigners.NVCs have played a key role in the apartheid system in Burma’s Rakhine state and have been described by researchers at the InternationalState Crime Initiative as a, “tool of genocide”.Senior UN figures, including the Special Envoy of the United Nations Secretary-General on Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, whodiscussed Rohingya repatriation with Burma’s government, have made statements supportive of NVCs for potential returnees. While the UNSpecial Envoy claimed to have received assurances from Burma’s authorities that NVCs would no longer include information about the holder’sreligion or ethnicity, the use of NVCs is a serious concern and risks UN complicity in Burma’s policies of apartheid against the Rohingya.The NVC, according to the Rakhine State Minister in conversations with Ms. Burgener, said, “NVC cards are not for foreigners, but for peopleresiding in Myanmar.” While the reassurance is meant to be helpful, it also gives the implication that NVCs verify the identity of refugeesreturning to Myanmar. The secretary of the Arakan Nations Party, Tun Aung Kyaw, reiterated that the NVC should be used to identify whobelongs saying, “ There are a lot of people who have entered Rakhine illegally, and if they are given NVCs and allowed to travel freely, it will bevery dangerous.”4The evidence from northern Rakhine State indicates that conditions for Rohingya there have not improved since the 2017 forcedmigration, and strict rights restrictions remain in place.5678\n\nAnnex 124\n\nSweTinSit (Map Record Check) SurveysPhoto 1 - A family’s collection of SweTinSit photos spanning several years from Buthidaung Township The Burmese authorities have extensive records of the Rohingya who were living inside of Northern Rakhine State prior to the 2017 forcedmigration.

Donors andconcerned governments should press Myanmar to protect their basic rights, facilitate internationaljustice for victims, and ensure that any returns of Rohingya refugees are voluntary, safe, and dignified.August 25, 2019, marks two years since the Myanmar military began a campaign of ethnic cleansing andcrimes against humanity that drove 740,000 Rohingya to neighboring Bangladesh. A United Nations-\n\nAnnex 125\n\nbacked Fact-Finding Mission found sufficient information to warrant the investigation and prosecution ofsenior military officials for grave crimes, including genocide, in Rakhine State.“Two years since the Myanmar military carried out ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya population, thegovernment still denies its troops committed any atrocities,” said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director.“The bulldozing of Rohingya homes to destroy evidence after the ethnic cleansing is emblematic of thegovernment’s campaign to whitewash its crimes.”The Myanmar government has not acted to improve conditions or address the causes underlying thehuman rights crisis facing Rohingya in Rakhine State.An estimated 500,000 Rohingya remain in appalling conditions in Rakhine State. Security forces haveconfined them to camps and villages and severely restricted their freedom of movement. The governmenthas denied them fundamental freedoms and deprived them of access to sustainable livelihoods and basichumanitarian services including adequate food, medical care, and education.The government restricts access to Rakhine State by news media and aid workers and since June 21 hasimposed an internet blackout across nine townships, including one in Chin State. The disruption ofinternet services has increased difficulties for humanitarian agencies and human rights groups to assistvulnerable people in the face of increased fighting in the area. The government should not use broad,indiscriminate shutdowns to curtail the flow of information, or to harm civilians’ ability to assemblefreely and express political views.The government should immediately amend its discriminatory 1982 Citizenship Law to provide Rohingyaequal access to Myanmar citizenship. The government should also take necessary steps to ensure thesecurity of the Rohingya population from abusive security forces and other groups.In July 2018, in the face of mounting criticism from the UN and various governments for the lack ofaccountability for grave crimes, Myanmar authorities established the Independent Commission ofEnquiry to investigate alleged human rights violations during the Rohingya crisis. In March 2019, the UNHigh Commissioner for Human Rights reported that following discussions with the Myanmarcommission’s chair, the High Commissioner was “seriously concerned about the impartiality of themechanism and whether it can implement its mandate independently.”“The composition, mandate, and statements of the Independent Commission of Enquiry reveal that it isfollowing the same failed path of past commissions,” Robertson said. “The Myanmar government hasdemonstrated its inability and unwillingness to investigate and prosecute grave crimes committed by itssecurity forces.”\n\nAnnex 125\n\nIn September 2018, the UN Human Rights Council created the Independent Investigative Mechanism forMyanmar to collect and preserve evidence of crimes for possible use in future criminal proceedings. TheMyanmar government should cooperate with this body and with other UN bodies, including the Office ofthe High Commissioner for Human Rights and the special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar.The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Fatou Bensouda, is seeking an investigationinto the crime against humanity of deportation, since Rohingya were deported to Bangladesh, a party tothe ICC. However, even if the judges grant her request, an ICC investigation would not cover most of thecrimes committed in Myanmar. The UN Security Council should refer the situation in Myanmar to theICC so that all ICC crimes can be considered.The Security Council and other governments should also impose or expand targeted sanctions onMyanmar military leaders and key military-owned enterprises. Sanctions should include travel bans, assetseizures, and restrictions on access to financial institutions, as well as a comprehensive military embargo.The Myanmar government recently verified that 3,450 people are eligible to return to Myanmar out of anoverall list of 22,000 refugees submitted by Bangladesh authorities. The Bangladesh government askedthe UN refugee agency, UNHCR, to consult individually with these refugees and determine who amongthem may wish to return at this time.Many of the refugees with whom Human Rights Watch spoke said they feared returning under the currentconditions. They said they did not feel safe going back to a country where they faced systematicpersecution and violence. “On the way to Maungdaw, the law enforcers will stop and harass you, demandbribes, or end up finally torturing you,” one refugee said. “All of this they can just do because we areRohingyas who don’t have any freedom of travel to anywhere. All this has to end if they want us torepatriate, so that we can live there as citizens and without discrimination.”Returnees will be required to sign up to a digitized National Verification Card (NVC) process thateffectively identifies them as a foreigner and could subsequently deny them Myanmar citizenship rights.They said that without recognized citizenship before they return, they felt they would be subject tofurther persecution in Myanmar. “If we will take NVC cards, then the Myanmar authorities will neverrecognize us as Rohingya,” one man from camp 24 said. “Because taking NVC means you areacknowledging yourself as a foreigner.”Human Rights Watch and other human rights and humanitarian groups have determined that conditionsfor voluntary, safe, and dignified return of Rohingya refugees to Rakhine State do not currently exist. TheMyanmar government has restricted UNHCR from reaching or monitoring areas where the Rohingyawould return, and so the UN agency has not publicly stated that conditions are suitable for their return.In an August 22 statement, UNHCR said that they visited families in shelters to establish whether they\n\nAnnex 125\n\nwished to return to Myanmar, but none had accepted: “So far, none of those interviewed have indicated awillingness to repatriate at this time.”Before any refugee returns, the Myanmar government should significantly improve conditions andaddress the root causes of the crisis, including systematic persecution and violence, statelessness, andmilitary impunity for grave violations.“Myanmar’s rampant atrocities and the failure over two years to address them has been made even worseby the Security Council’s apathy,” Robertson said. “For Rohingya languishing in camps in Bangladesh andMyanmar, concerted international action to provide them with justice could not come a moment toosoon.”\n\nAnnex 125\n\nAnnex 126\n\nFortify Rights, ”Tools of Genocide”: National Verification Cards and the Denial of Citizenship of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar (September 2019)\n\nSEPTEMBER 2019GENOCIDENational Verification Cards and the Denial of Citizenship of Rohingya Muslims in MyanmarTOOLSOF““\n\nAnnex 126\n\nFortify Rights works to ensure human rights for all.

The timing, content, and commentary on the 1982 law demonstrate that it deliberately targeted Rohingya on racial and religious grounds, though the authorities did not fully enforce it for several years.34 For instance, on October 8, 1982, General Ne Win, the President of Myanmar from 1962 to 1981, delivered a speech about the incoming citizenship law at a meeting held at the President’s House in Yangon, saying:We, the natives or Burmese nationals, were unable to shape our own destiny . . . [s]o at the time of independence there were not only true nationals, but also guests . . . We are, in reality, not in a position to drive away all those people who had come at different times for different reasons from different lands . . . we have therefore designated them eh-naing-ngan-tha (associate citizens) in this law.3528 William L.

Cheesman writes that the “work of introducing the new citizenship regime appears to have gone on lethargically and without fanfare,” and other accounts differ as to when the government began implementing the law. Most accounts, including government data, indicate that by 1989 the authorities were implementing the law as designed.

Annex 126\n\n36BackgroundAlthough associate citizens would be allowed “rights to a certain extent,” including “the right to live” and “to carry on a livelihood,” General Ne Win emphasized that “[w]e will . . . not give them full citizenship and full rights.” 36 General Ne Win further described the 1982 law as a way to “clarify the position of guests and mixed-bloods.” He explained that “foreigners who had settled in Burma [Myanmar] at the time of independence have become a problem” and that those who could demonstrate long-term residency would be given “associate” citizenship under the law in order to prevent them from obtaining any role in government.37 A week after General Ne Win’s controversial speech, on October 15, Myanmar passed the proposed citizenship law, which remains in force at the time of writing.38The 1982 Citizenship Law creates three categories of citizenship—full, associate, and naturalized citizens—each with varying rights and accompanying identification cards. Under the law, anyone belonging to one of the eight specified “national ethnic groups” identified in the law are considered full citizens by birth, as are persons belonging to ethnic groups that are considered to have settled in the country prior to 1823.39 Moreover, the 1982 Citizenship Law provides authority to the government to “decide whether any ethnic group is national or not.”40 Since at least 1989, Myanmar government officials have claimed that there are officially 135 ethnic groups in Myanmar—a dubious and highly disputed claim.41 The Rohingya are not recognized under the law or by the government as a “national ethnic group” of Myanmar.4236 General Ne Win, “Speech by General Ne Win: Meeting Held in the Central Meeting Hall, President House, Ahlone Road,” The Working People’s Daily; South and Lall, eds., Citizenship in Myanmar 37 Ibid. 38 José María Arraiza and Olivier Vonk, European University Institute, Report on Citizenship Law: Myanmar, October 2017.

Annex 126\n\n40Background2012-PRESENT: BUILDING TO THE NVC PROCESSAs early as 2012, the Government of Myanmar initiated efforts to identify Rohingya in official documents as “Bengali.”69 Under President Thein Sein in 2014, the Myanmar authorities initiated a pilot “citizenship verification process” in Taung Pyo internment camp in Rakhine State’s Myebon Township in an attempt to register Muslims holding White Cards, including Rohingya and ethnic Kaman—a predominantly Muslim ethnic group recognized by the government.70 The government at the time registered Rohingya “applicants” as “Bengali” or “Bengali/Islam.”71 As a result, the government effectively required Rohingya residents in Myebon Township to officially disavow their ethnic identity. While the authorities forced some Rohingya to participate, the process was met with resistance and, consequently, it stalled.72 In 2014, the government used the Rohingya lack of citizenship to exclude them from the U.N.-supported national census, which the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and others funded.73 The White Card, held by many Rohingya at the time of the 2010 elections, enabled Rohingya to vote as well as join and create Rohingya-led political parties. The cards officially expired nationwide on March 31, 2015, ahead of national elections, and the government announced that all holders of “temporary identity cards” should surrender their cards to the government authorities and submit to the citizenship “verification” process.74 Beginning in June 2015, through the citizenship verification process, the government issued Identity Cards of National Verification (ICNV), ostensibly to identify applicants who meet the eligibility requirements to become a citizen of Myanmar.75 While the cards did not mention race or religion, the application forms required applicants to specify their “race” and “religion.”76 Like before, the 69 See, Todd Pitman, “AP Exclusive: Myanmar Verifying Muslim Citizenship,” Associated Press, November 30, 2012, https://news.yahoo.com/ap-exclusive-myanmar-verifying-muslim-citizenshi…; Fortify Rights, Policies of Persecution; Human Rights Watch, “All You Can Do Is Pray.”70 Human Rights Council, Report of the Detailed Findings of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, para. 482.71 Human Rights Watch, “All You Can Do Is Pray,” p. 110.72 Fortify Rights, Submission to United Nations Periodic Review: Myanmar, November 2015, https://www.fortifyrights.org/downloads/FR_UPR%20Submission_September_2… (accessed August 23, 2019); San Yamin Aung, “Burmese Govt Resumes Citizenship Verification of Rohingyas,” The Irrawaddy, June 16, 2014, https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/burmese-govt-resumes-citizenship-v… (accessed August 23, 2019).73 United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), “UNFPA Concerned about Decision Not to Allow Census Respondents to Self-Identify as Rohingya,” April 1, 2014, https://myanmar.unfpa.org/news/statement-unfpa-concerned-about-decision… (accessed August 23, 2019).74 Guy Dinmore, “Uncertain Future for Hundreds of Thousands as White Cards are Revoked,” Myanmar Times, April 1, 2015, https://www.mmtimes.com/national-news/13852-uncertain-future-for-hundre… (accessed August 23, 2019); Amnesty International, “Caged Without a Roof,” p. 29.75 Human Rights Council, Report of the Detailed Findings of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, para. 484.76 See, Annex II: National Verification Card (NVC) Application Form. The terms “race” and “ethnicity” are often used interchangeably in Myanmar. More broadly, race is commonly regarded as reflecting objective biological or genetic traits, whereas ethnicity is regarded as reflecting subjective cultural or religious traits. However, international jurisprudence increasingly looks to subjective understandings of groups in conjunction with an analysis of objective elements. The Genocide Convention lists four types of protected groups: national, ethnic, racial, and religious. As expressed by the ICTY in the case of Jelisić, there is increasing skepticism of the accuracy of objective definitions of the four protected groups under the Genocide Convention, particularly the ethnic, racial, and national categories.

Stakic, ICTY, Case No. IT-97-24-T, Judgment (Trial), July 31, 2003, para. 25 (noting that the jurisprudence does not allow for the consideration of subjective definitions alone without reference to objective elements). Moreover, tribunals typically refer to the subjective perceptions of the perpetrators, though some have left room for perceptions of the survivors or others in society. See, for example, Jelisić, ICTY, Case No. ICTY-95-10-T, Judgment (Trial), para. 70 (referring to the “stigmatisation of the group as a distinct national, ethnical or racial unit” and the propriety of evaluating groups “from the point of view of those persons who wish to single that group out from the rest of the community”); Prosecutor v. Kayishema and Ruzindana, ICTR, Case No. ICTR-95-1-T, Judgment (Trial), May 21, 1999, para. 98 (defining an ethnic group as “one whose members share a common language and culture; or, a group which distinguishes itself, as such (self identification); or, a group identified as such by others, including perpetrators of the crimes (identification by others)”), quoted in Fortify Rights, “They Gave Them Long Swords,” p. 87.77 Fortify Rights interviews with Rohingya refugees, Cox’s Bazar District Bangladesh, 2018 and 2019.

Rohingya villages are typically represented by ethnic Rakhine or Burman administrators and village heads, while Rohingya appoint yar ein hmu or “persons-in-charge” to liaise with local administrators and represent their interests.

Ibid. According to Human Rights Watch, in 1974, Rohingya were offered FRCs, which many refused to accept. FRCs are white in color and many Rohingya at the time used “family lists,” as proof of residence in the country. See, Human Rights Watch, Burma: Rohingya Muslims.82 The FFM noted, “[a]s of January 2017, over 16,000 NVCs had been issued in Shan State and 3,500 in Kayin.

Annex 126\n\n42Background2014 to present: National Verification Card (NVC)/Identity Card for National Verification (INVC) The National Verification Card is a temporary identification document for “foreigners.” The card is light blue in color and states, in English and Burmese language, “[h]olding this identity card does not testify that the card holder is [sic] Myanmar citizen.”84 Under the Thein Sein administration, a similar card was known as an Identity Card for National Verification. 1948 to 1982: National Registration Card (NRC), known as the “three-fold card” The Myanmar government issued the National Registration Card, also known as the “three-fold card,” to citizens under the 1949 Residents of Burma Registration Act and its 1951 Rules. Cards issued to men were green and pink for women. The NRC provided full citizenship rights.1993 to 2015: Temporary Registration Card (TRC), known as the “White Card”The Myanmar government issued the Temporary Registration Card, also known as the “White Card,” under the 1949 Residents of Burma Registration Act to replace lost or damaged NRCs. In 1955, the government began issuing the White Card to Rohingya, which allowed them to vote in the 2010 national elections. However, the government revoked the White Cards in March 2015, ahead of the national elections and issued White Card receipts to Rohingya who surrendered their White Card. Like the cards, the receipts conferred no rights.1989 to present: Citizenship Scrutiny Card (CSC)The Myanmar government began issuing the CSC to citizens after 1989. The CSCs are color-coded based on citizenship status–pink for full citizens, blue for associate citizens, and green for naturalized citizens. These also included the Associate Citizenship Scrutiny Card (ACSC) and the Naturalized Citizenship Scrutiny Card (NCSC).85 The government has, for the most part, excluded Rohingya from obtaining a CSC. 1970s Foreign Registration Cards (FRC) In the 1970s, the Myanmar government reportedly issued Foreign Registration Cards (FRC) to Rohingya, identifying them as “foreigners” residing in Myanmar. FRCs were issued in accordance with the Emergency Immigration Act ostensibly to address unauthorized migration from India and Bangladesh to Myanmar. At this time, the authorities required all citizens to carry identity cards, mainly the NRC. However, the government issued FRCs to Rohingya, which many refused.84 See, Annex I: National Verification Card (NVC). 85 There were also brown color cards for Buddhist monks. See, Thant Myint-U, The Making of Modern Burma, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 245. Annex 126\n\n“Tools of Genocide”Through the application of the 1982 Citizenship Law and the implementation of the various “citizenship scrutiny” processes, the Government of Myanmar effectively stripped more than one million Rohingya Muslims of citizenship status and continues to deny Rohingya equal access to citizenship.86 The NVC, which requires Rohingya to identify as “Bengali” or other foreign identities, is the latest iteration of these processes. This chapter documents how the Myanmar authorities are using NVCs to deny Rohingya the right to nationality and all other rights.87 This chapter also documents how the Myanmar authorities force Rohingya to accept the NVC, including through the use of torture, and rely on the NVC to further restrict the rights of Rohingya to move freely and access livelihoods.Rohingya believe the NVC is a tool to erase their identity. “The NVC is a tool of genocide,” a Rohingya refugee in Bangladesh stated in English, later adding, “We want our citizenship restored first, and there should be equality, safety, and security in our motherland.”88 86 The government excluded Rohingya from the 2014 national census. The government’s report on the census in Rakhine State “estimated that a population of 1,090,000 was likely not to have been counted during the enumeration.” Department of Population, Ministry of Immigration and Population, The 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census: Rakhine State, p. 8, https://myanmar.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/Rakhine%20State%2… (accessed August 26, 2019).

I. HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND NATIONAL VERIFICATION CARDSI. HUMAN RIGHTS VIO\n\nAnnex 126\n\n44I. Human Rights Violations and National Verification CardsRESTRICTIONS ON THE RIGHT TO NATIONALITYIn a March 2019 report on the human rights situation of the Rohingya in Rakhine State, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that Myanmar has, under the current legal framework, “systematically denied the right of citizenship to members of the Rohingya community, effectively rendering them stateless.”89The Government of Myanmar asserts that NVCs are “the first step before the scrutinisation of citizenship, in accordance with the 1982 Citizenship Law.”90 However, the NVC itself does not guarantee citizenship in Myanmar, and holders are still required to apply for citizenship under the 1982 Citizenship Law.91 On the back of the card, the NVC states in the English and Burmese languages “[h]olding this identity card does not testify that the card holder is [sic] Myanmar citizen,” as well as “[t]his identity card holder is a person who need [sic] to apply for citizenship in accordance with the Myanmar Citizenship Law.””92 The 1982 Citizenship Law effectively denies Rohingya full citizenship and, as mentioned above, was drafted with discriminatory intent to deny Rohingya access to full citizenship.93 As recently as July 29, 2019, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary Myint Thu affirmed that Rohingya with the NVC would be ineligible for full citizenship and would instead be considered “foreign nationals,” saying Rohingya at a later date could be granted “naturalized citizenship” in Myanmar.94 The authorities do not allow Rohingya to identify as Rohingya when applying for NVCs, which also contributes to the decades-long administrative erasure of the Rohingya ethnic identity.95 A pamphlet distributed in July 2019 by government officials says that the NVC physical card will be “without mention of ethnicity or religion.”96 While information on “race” and “religion” is not recorded on the physical NVC, Rohingya applicants, at the time of writing, are still required to provide their “race” and “religion” in the application for an NVC.97 Rohingya who applied for the NVC told Fortify Rights that “Rohingya” is not an accepted option for “race” on the form, and the Myanmar authorities instead require Rohingya to register as “Bengali,” or another foreign identity.98 Also, a June 2019 report by Burma Human Rights states, 89 Many Rohingya reject the term “stateless,” saying they already have a “State” and are indigenous to Myanmar. 90 The Republic of the Union of Myanmar President Office, “NV Process is First Step Towards Citizenship,” October 29, 2017, http://www.president-office.gov.mm/en/?q=issues/rakhine-state-affairs/i… (accessed August 23, 2019).91 Ibid. 92 See, Annex I: National Verification Card (NVC) 93 Ibid.

The same pamphlet also indicates the authorities will collect biometric data from returnees,’ including a “Facial scan,” “10-digit fingerprint scan,” and an “Iris scan,” suggesting a potential digitized NVC.97 There appear to be multiple NVC application forms with varying questions. See, Annex II: National Verification Card (NVC) Application Form. 98 Fortify Rights interviews with Rohingya refugees, Cox’s Bazar District Bangladesh, 2018 and 2019. Corroborating this a Myanmar civil society leader explained how the Myanmar government make Rohingya identify as other races on immigration forms. He told Fortify Rights: “In immigration offices, they always favor Buddhists . . . I have Rohingya friends. They already have citizenship cards, but in the cards, their race is India and Burmese or Bengali. Most Rohingya do not like the NVC . . . My Rohingya friends tell me that’s the reason they do not want to be verified again in Myanmar. Annex 126\n\n45“The authorities [in Myanmar] refuse to allow participants to self-identify as Rohingya on these identity cards.”99 For example, a 30-year-old Rohingya village leader from Maungdaw Township who saw the NVC application form many times said: “On the NVC form it asked, ‘Where are you from? What border did you enter? How did you come to Myanmar?’ We are not migrants. The document that you have to fill out for the NVC makes us feel shame. It says we are outsiders.”100The application form also includes questions such as, “[d]ate and place of arrival in Myanmar,” “[t]ype of vehicles and route taken (to Myanmar),” “[r]ace (ethnicity) and citizenship (nationality),” and other biographic details, indicating that the NVC is intended for foreigners, not members of a community indigenous to Myanmar.101 Several Rohingya said that previous government-issued identity documents and documents held by their ancestors specified their legal status in Myanmar as “full citizens.”102 A 45-year-old Rohingya refugee woman from Buthidaung Township, who refused to exchange her White Card receipt for an NVC, told Fortify Rights: The NVC is another policy of our government to persecute us in a new way. It’s like many of the old polices and old cards that didn’t give us benefits . . . The NVC is for [foreigners] not for Rohingya. I had a three-fold card [NRC citizenship card]. [The Myanmar government] then gave me a White Card, and after, the [Myanmar government] replaced it with a White Card receipt. I don’t need a new card.103Another Rohingya woman told Fortify Rights: The NVC is for guests. We are native people in Myanmar . . . My parents had three-fold [NRC citizenship card] cards. When I was born, I held a White Card, then [the government] replaced it with a receipt paper. My receipt paper, including [household] family list, were burned when the army forces set fire to my house during the violence in August 2017.104A displaced Rohingya woman, 26, from Buthidaung Township, who fled to Bangladesh after military-led attacks in 2017, explained how the NVC process is complicating the situation for refugees in Bangladesh: “We don’t trust Myanmar . . . Our forefathers were verified citizens in Myanmar. My grandfather was a police officer in Maungdaw [in northern Rakhine State]. I will not return unless we have rights and are granted citizenship.”105An internal UNCHR document from April 2016 further explained that, “communities are reluctant to accept them [the NVC]” because the “legal status, rights and citizenship verification” attached to the NVC are “unclear.”106 As of August 2017, the Government of Myanmar had issued an estimated 10,000 NVCs in Rakhine State and recognized as citizens or naturalized citizens only 4,000—less than 0.5 percent—of the estimated one million Rohingya people in Rakhine State at the time.107 They are already citizens.” See, Fortify Rights interview with A.W.C., undisclosed location, April 5, 2019.

Annex 126\n\n49TORTURE AND ILL-TREATMENTFortify Rights documented how Myanmar authorities beat and threatened Rohingya residents to accept the NVC, and beat, threatened, and deprived Rohingya prisoners of food in order to force them to accept NVCs.129 For example, a 32-year-old Rohingya man from Maungdaw Township, whom the authorities charged and imprisoned with “illegal border crossing” in 2015, told Fortify Rights:Prison guards beat me in the face and on my chest. I was bleeding . . . I kept refusing [the NVC]. They did not feed me. They stopped feeding me for not taking the NVC . . . They [forced me to take the NVC] in June 2017. [The immigration police] took a photo [of me] and told me I had to take [the NVC]. After I refused to take the NVC, they stopped feeding me food in prison. I was hungry.130The authorities released the man from prison on April 18, 2019 after he accepted the NVC. During his time in prison, he witnessed prison guards torture and kill other detainees: “[The prison guards] tortured many people. I was very lucky. I know some people who died. I saw people die in front of my eyes from torture.”131A Rohingya farmer, 62, from Maungdaw Township, imprisoned for three-and-a-half years, told Fortify Rights how authorities threatened to kill him if he refused to take the NVC card: I was imprisoned because I was accused of being a terrorist. I am only a farmer, not a terrorist. I was in prison for 42 months. I was put in prison with five other Rohingya men. One of the five men died in prison because he was beaten to death . . . I was also beaten. I was beaten so badly that I lost [some of] my teeth . . . I was beaten everywhere—my head, back, chest, and all over my body. All my clothes were red with blood. I threw up blood when they beat me . . . In jail, I was threatened to take the NVC. One [officer] told me, “If you don’t accept the NVC, we will kill you.”132He went on to tell Fortify Rights: “I feel very sad that I had to accept the NVC. I didn’t want to. It is not for Rohingya people . . . We are indigenous to the Myanmar land. If I did not take the NVC, I would have either been kept in prison, killed, or imprisoned again upon my release.”133 Another Rohingya man, 33, imprisoned in 2014, told Fortify Rights how the authorities tortured him in prison and predicated his release on accepting the NVC, saying: In 2014, authorities came to our village and took me and some other men away. I don’t know why I was arrested. They burned me and beat me. See my arms and my legs still have scars. They burned me with an iron rod. It was so painful. I was screaming . . . Before I was released from prison, I was forced to take the NVC. I didn’t want an NVC. I had to take it. The prison authorities said, “If you don’t take the NVC, then you’ll have to stay in prison for many more years.” I was scared.134129 Fortify Rights interview with A.C., Cox’s Bazar District, Bangladesh, November 4, 2018.

Annex 126\n\n50I. Human Rights Violations and National Verification CardsIn August 2018, Human Rights Watch documented how Myanmar officials pardoned 62 Rohingya prisoners, took them to a Border Guard Police (BGP) compound in the village tract of Nga Khu Ya in Maungdaw Township, and forced them to take NVCs, threatening them with re-arrest if they attempted to leave the compound.135 A Rohingya man, 51, from Maungdaw Township imprisoned in Buthidaung Prison for five years similarly told Fortify Rights how the BGP brought him to the Nga Khu Ya transit point and forced him to accept an NVC.136 He said: [The BGP] kept me [at the Nga Khu Ya transit point] for five days and forced me and others to take the NVC. They told me that I was coming from Bangladesh and had to receive the NVC. In the end, I was made an immigrant from Bangladesh. They forced me to receive it. They threatened me. I was unable to deny it and did not want to go back to jail. In May 2018, my NVC was issued.137 In some cases, the authorities reportedly threatened Rohingya with re-imprisonment if they did not accept the NVC. For example, a Rohingya man from Nyaung Chaung village in Maungdaw Township told Fortify Rights: I was in prison from August 2016 until May 2017. I was forced to take the NVC. I told the Myanmar authorities, “I don’t want this. I am from Myanmar.” The authorities threatened me, saying, “If you don’t take it, we’ll throw you back in prison.” I was angry. I was sad.138He described his treatment in detention, saying: “The authorities beat me. They kicked my back and chest. I think I experienced over 50 beatings by police in jail. I still feel pain in my chest from the beatings.”139 The authorities also issued NVCs to Rohingya upon their release from detention without discussion or violence. For example, a 52-year-old Rohingya man from Maungdaw Township imprisoned in Kyauk Pyu Prison in Kyauk Pyu Township between 2015 and March 2018, said: When I was released from prison, they gave me an NVC. I knew it was an NVC. I didn’t say anything, out of fear. There in prison, they can do to us what they wish and [would have] tortured me again . . . I received the NVC without saying anything because I wanted to see my family.140The man also described being tortured while imprisoned in Kyauk Pyu Prison, saying: “I was made to lay on the ground . . . There was a [soldier]. He punched my chest three times . . . He took a big rod and rolled it on my knees. I lost my control then. It was unbearable.”141135 Human Rights Watch, “Myanmar: Security Forces Torture Rohingya Returnees,” August 21, 2018, https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/08/21/myanmar-security-forces-torture-roh… (accessed August 23, 2019). 136 Some Rohingya refer to Nga Khu Ya transit point as “Nga Khu Ra.” 137 Fortify Rights interview with B.C., Cox’s Bazar District, Bangladesh, November 30, 2018.138 Fortify Rights interview with F.B., Cox’s Bazar District, Bangladesh, June 16, 2019. 139 Ibid.140 Fortify Rights interview with D.E., Cox’s Bazar District, Bangladesh, March 10, 2019. 141 IbId.

The Office of the President in 2018 reiterated the NVC requirement to engage in fishing and other economic activities, saying: “[T]hose who already possess the cards can use it as an official fishing license. Moreover, they can overcome the difficulties of procuring food, clothing and shelter by holding this card.” The Republic of the Union of Myanmar President’s Office, “Union Minister Inspects of Issuing NVCs in Sittway,” January 15, 2018, http://www.president-office.gov.mm/en/?q=issues/rakhine-state-affairs/i… (accessed August 23, 2019).

Human Rights Violations and National Verification CardsAn internal UNHCR report from February 2018 said that the requirement of the NVC “to renew the fishing boat licenses continues to impact the livelihood, food security and overall protection environment of the Muslim community and is still the main issue of concern of IDPs [internally displaced persons] in central Rakhine.”206A 45-year-old Rohingya man living in a village in Sittwe Township explained to Fortify Rights the consequences of the NVC requirement on his access to livelihood in Rakhine State: The government makes fishing very restrictive . . . I can’t travel for work or go outside. I have a very small paddy field. I was fishing before, but now I cannot since I did not take the NVC. I can’t travel. It’s very difficult. I sell [rice] to the Rohingya village close by. If I don’t have the NVC, I can’t do anything. It’s very difficult if we don’t have permission to travel or work.207Several Rohingya told Fortify Rights that they had to accept the NVC in order to maintain their livelihoods. For example, a Rohingya fisher, 30, in an internment camp in Rakhine State, said: Last year, in September 2018, the authorities told me I could not fish. Without the NVC, we cannot"
