Founder and co-director of Outside The Frame Arts, she is passionate about championing voices outside the mainstream. Winner of the Jerwood Compton Poetry Fellowship 2019, she is writer-in-residence with Manchester Literature Festival, Associate Artist with the Poetry Exchange, Associate Artist with Oldham Coliseum Theatre and Supported Artist at the Royal Exchange Theatre. She has worked creatively with Manchester International Festival, HOME, Ballet Black and ANU Productions.\n\nâ\n\nThe commission: Ede: Past and Present\n\nHafsah explains:\"My commission will take the Muslim Festival of Eid from being celebrated intimately with family and friends privately, right into the heart of a public space by encouraging the local community to submit their stories.Iâm keen to shine a light on how Eid celebrations, cultural practises and family dynamics have changed over the decades and contributed to the rich fabric of society we have today.\n\nA gallery exhibition will explore both pre- and post-millennium traditional family photographs accompanied by a soundscape of community voices talking about the importance of Eid and what it means to them.\"\n\nWhere to view the commission:\n\nThe Eid Exhibition was exhibited Oldham Coliseum Theatre and the Kushi Festival until August 2022.\n\nâ\n\nYasmin Wilde is an actress and playwright of dual heritage (Pakistani/Austrian) and has been performing for over thirty years in British theatre and TV. As an actor she has been lucky enough to work with some of our best British Asian writers including Tanika Gupta and Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti and has performed at Watford Palace Theatre twice - once in Guptaâs version of A Country Wife and then in Kaur Bhattiâs one woman show Fourteen. Yasmin has always harboured a desire to write for the stage, and has a drawer at home full of ideas, plays and musicals in various states of completion. Yasmin was a 2020 â 2022 Rifco Associate.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nThe commission: Glitterball\n\nYasmin explains that Glitterball is a play with music, saying: âI wanted to tell the story of a very ordinary middle-aged woman, Sonia. She is haunted by her late mother, Gloria, finding strange solace in the Shirley Bassey numbers her mother loved to sing. My new play is a gentle comedy about finding your own voiceâ.\n\nWhere to view the commission:\n\nYasminâs commission Glitterball will be touring this autumn - Watford Palace Theatre 15th - 24th September, Riverside Studios, London 27th September - 8th October and Oldham Coliseum Theatre 11th - 15th October.\n\nâ\n\nTaqi Nazeer is a writer, performer, presenter and voice-over artist, who has worked extensively with theatre companies across Britain. He is also the creator, producer and presenter of the hit BBC Asian Network podcast Scotistan. Taqi Has previously worked with Rifco playing the character of Mahesh in the hit show The Deranged Marriage.\n\nâ\n\nâThe commission: Rishta\n\nTaqi says about his play: âRishta is a satirical rom-com that is deliberately unapologetic in celebrating South Asian marriage culture in all its beauty, glory and flaws. At its core, it is about challenging misconceptions that being British and South Asian is mutually exclusive. Working with Rifco to craft the bold world of Rishta is a beautifully creative challenge. From day one, Pravesh and Ameet have been committed to not only developing Rishta, but to honing my professional practice as a playwright.â\n\nWhere to watch the commission:\n\nYou can watch a reading of his play Ristha on our youtube channel here.\n\nâ\n\nSatinder is an award-winning playwright whose previous plays include Zameen, Made in India and Lotus Beauty, as well as various book-to-stage adaptations, are being produced across the UK and internationally.\n\nâ\n\nâThe commission: Koh-i-Noor Trilogy\n\nSatinder explains about her commission for a new play: âAs a (British) Punjabi Sikh woman, I have long wanted to tell the compelling, oft-neglected story of Maharaja Duleep Singh, the last Maharaja of Punjab and favourite of Queen Victoria, later nicknamed the âBlack Prince of Perthshireâ. But I wanted to connect Duleepâs story to the equally fascinating stories of two formidable women in his life: his mother Jindan Kaur (once Regent of the Sikh Empire) and his suffragette daughter Princess Sophia Duleep Singh.\n\nAgainst the rise and fall of the British Empire in India, the Koh-i-Noor Trilogy will be an epic drama of family, exile and belonging, of stolen power, stolen identities and the coveted, cursed, Koh-i-Noor diamond, taken from the boy Maharaja along with his inherited kingdom of Punjab by the British.\n\nThe Koh-i-Noor Trilogy captures the spirited resistance of these three feisty figures, each separately fighting a controlling and oppressive British establishment, across generations and continents, bound by blood.â\n\nâ\n\nSarah Isaac is a playwright who grew up in Yorkshire and now lives in London. She studied philosophy at Kingâs College London and was a member of the Royal Courtâs writing group.

The culture I inherited and the one I was brought up in are worlds apart but there are millions like me who are also trying to figure it all out. Music is my creative outlet to explore that journey.â\n\nThis unique perspective allowed Raxstar to create songs like âJaanemanâ \"Sun Raha\" and \"Ankhiyaan\" drawing from the influences of Bollywood and the smooth R&B records he grew up with. The mixtapes Lost Ones (2008), Spring Cleaning (2010), About A Girl (2011) and Late On Time (2012) continued to showcase his work ethic, versatile subject matter and lyrical prowess.
