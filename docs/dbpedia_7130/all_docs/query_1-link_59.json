        "text": "Today, Clovellys former Harbour Master, Ticker and I put flood defences at my front door …just in case…\n\nLiving in such a special and unusual home, I feel a big responsibility to honour the unique history of the building and ensure that the we look after the property. Perched right on the beach, twice a day, the tide creeps up across the pebbles and laps at our cottage, which means that at certain times of the year, we live with a very real threat of the property flooding.\n\nIf there is very bad weather and strong winds during a high tide, there is a very real possibility that waves could wash straight into our house and/or the rough sea could throw pebbles up against the house, which could smash the windows in our kitchen.\n\nUntil I lived in the harbour, I hadn’t appreciated the powerful connection between the tides and moon phases. When the Sun lines up with the Moon and the Earth during a New Moon or a Full Moon, the ‘tidal movement’ increases. Known as Spring Tides (named not for the season, but because the water “springs” higher than normal). I understood that there was an intrinsic link between the gravitational forces of the Sun and Moon which cause a rise and fall in sea level, but it wasn’t until I lived so close to the sea, watching the tides change and the way the fishermen adapt, that I truly appreciated the powerful connection and it is truly incredible.\n\nLuckily, my lovely neighbour Ticker makes sure that I am prepared when the tides are particularly high and he helps to put the flood defences in place. There are big boards which slot in front of the doors and on the rare occasions that storms hit at the same time as a high tide, we even have boards ready to cover the windows on the front of the property too.\n\nLiving as we do, in one of the most recognisable cottages in Clovelly, it’s impossible to escape the fascinating history of the place. (You can read more about living in Crazy Kate’s in one of my previous posts, here: Living with Crazy Kate on Fish Street).\n\nNext weekend Kirstie Allsopp presents The Handmade Fair 2015 and once again I am delighted to be included as one of Kirstie’s Craft Experts!\n\nCan it really be a whole year since I was invited to take part in the first ever Handmade Fair ~ Where on earth has the time gone?\n\nThis year I am running daily Skills Workshops ~ Join me as I show you how to make your own No-Sew bag and accessories!\n\nI will also be taking part in another Mollie Makes Mash-Up!\n\nWhat an honour to have my name listed amongst some of the most famous designers in the world ~ Emma Bridgewater, Annie Sloan and Dawn O’Porter to name but a few!\n\nhttp://www.thehandmadefair.com/kirsties-experts\n\nSet in the tranquil surroundings of Hampton Court Palace, draped in *miles* of bunting and *millions* of Pom-poms, the fair will no doubt be a *feast* of vibrant colour and a hive of exciting craft activity!\n\nThe Handmade Fair last year was a surprisingly intimate gathering of lovely, like-minded craft enthusiasts and this year, I predict an atmosphere even more friendly, vibrant, positive, and celebratory than last year ~ rather like a giant crafting tea-party!\n\nThe whole Clovelly Silk family will be there ~ and we hope to see some of you there too!\n\nClovelly is a close and thriving community, uniquely linked to the past, fiercely proud of its fishing heritage as well as the history of its residents, and the traditions which have meant so much to so many. For generations every Shrove Tuesday, the children of Clovelly have taken part in a curious custom, which is said to rid Clovelly of all the bad things from the previous year, chasing bad spirits away and banishing the Devil into the sea with a perfect riot before the season of Lent begins. Tin cans (and just about anything else that makes a suitable racket) are tied to strings and dragged down the famous cobbled street, right to the end of the harbour wall. There, the strings are tied together and the metal objects are thrown into the sea; it is said to take the evil spirits with them. As Clovelly is a fishing village they would never be left to litter the sea, so having served their purpose the cans are retrieved from the water and recycled! Not much is known about exactly when the tradition started in Clovelly, but the ‘Lentsherd’ is detailed in the Clovelly Chronicles. It seems that each generation has a different name for the custom ~ “Lanshard”, “Tin Night”, “Rattlin’ Tin Night”, “Tinning” to name but a few. I have researched this event and it appears to be quite unique ~ How fitting for such a perfectly unique village and community. My family set up our ‘Clovelly Silk’ textile workshop 20 years ago. When my eldest child was first able to toddle and Shrove Tuesday was approaching, I asked a friend and neighbour about how we could get involved with this custom which I had quietly admired for so many years. I was shocked to discover that the previous year, only three children had taken part and that nothing was planned for this particular year. Concerned that this tradition must not be lost, I began contacting other families in the village and very quickly arranged for us to meet. I wanted my child to take part in a tradition which to this day, means so very much to those who carried out this ancient custom when they were children. I sincerely hope the tradition continues for generations to come and meanwhile, my own Clovelly children are thrilled at the mere thought of starting to save their tin cans, and look forward to enjoying delicious pancakes afterwards!\n\nEvent: Clovelly “Lentsherd” aka “Tin Night”\n\nDate: Tuesday, 17 February starting at 5:00 pm\n\nLocation: Clovelly village, North Devon\n\nAdmission: Free from 4:30 pm\n\nJoin in the celebration of a wonderfully unique tradition at Clovelly! Lentsherd has recently evolved (via social media) to include tags bearing the names of children from all over the world. These names are sent via the ‘Clovelly Village’ Facebook and Twitter pages. The tags are tied to a string of tin cans, then dragged down the cobbles on their behalf! Shrove Tuesday this year is February 17, during Half Term, so do come and help Clovelly celebrate this ancient tradition. Children are invited to meet at 4:45 p.m. for a 5:00 p.m. start at the Victoria Fountain on the cobbles, bringing with them tin cans tied to string. Children must be accompanied by an adult. There will be free entry for visitors to Clovelly after 4:30 p.m. The custom is most certainly not a race and all participants are encouraged to head safely down the cobbled street at a pace that suits them. Following the riotous fun, children taking part can enjoy building a free pancake with ice cream, squirty cream, a selection of fruit syrups or lemon juice and sugar to decorate with sprinkles and other toppings at the Red Lion. Families can enjoy the ‘Tea Time Specials’ ~ Fish and chips with peas and tartar sauce, or Cheeseburger chips and salad in a bun, available from 4:30 pm to 6:30 pm at the Red Lion. In traditional Shrove Tuesday style, delicious pancakes will be available for all to buy at The Red Lion, with delicious and indulgent toppings, such as Chocolate Baileys ice cream and a real orange syrup or Rum Flambéed Bananas with clotted cream and a toffee sauce, or of course, a plain pancake with lemon and sugar! For latest details, please contact me or visit the Clovelly website: www.clovelly.co.uk\n\n50.999281 -4.399824\n\nEvery day, the tide washes up across the stones in the harbour and touches the cottage in which I live. I’m blessed to call the picture-perfect fishing village of Clovelly my home ~ World famous for its donkeys and steep, cobbled, traffic-free street which tumbles down to an ancient, working harbour.\n\nThe description of our cottage on the Clovelly website is as follows:\n\n“Kate Lyall, known as Crazy Kate, died in 1736. Her pretty cottage with its picturesque balcony overlooking the harbour is said to be the oldest in Clovelly. Kate’s husband was a fisherman, and she would watch him from her upper window as he fished in the bay. One day, a terrible squall blew up and he was drowned before her eyes.\n\nThis terrible sight drove her mad, and she remained demented until the day of her death. On that tragic day, she put on her wedding dress and walked into the sea to join her husband in his watery grave.”\n\nClovelly is a village like no other ~ Like stepping back in time, the village has hardly changed in a hundred years. Historic paintings and beautiful vintage photographs could easily depict the village today.\n\nIt’s likely that you’ve visited Clovelly at some point (it certainly seems like most people have!) and if you’ve visited, you will know just how enchanting the village is. If you haven’t heard of it, take a look!\n\nhttp://www.clovelly.co.uk\n\nI’ve had the honour of living in three houses situated on the cobbled street. Each beautiful whitewashed cottage is totally unique and with its own place in Clovelly history.\n\nMoving in Clovelly is worthy of its own blog (in fact I may well blog about that soon!). Any one who has visited Clovelly will know that the village is built on a very steep, cobbled street. Vehicles are banned from the cobbles and residents use purpose-built sledges to transport shopping etc. to our houses. Moving is no exception and all belongings are sledged down the hill!\n\nOver the years, I have amassed a collection of gorgeous, vintage postcards showing each of the Clovelly houses I have lived in. What a joy it is to delight in how little the village has changed in the past century and I have felt compelled to discover more about the Clovellians captured in the photographs, all those years ago.\n\nFor a short while, I lived in Rat’s Castle. A tiny cottage, perched on the edge of the Clovelly cliff. My first experience of living in the village, I quickly became used to hearing visitors exclaim the name Rat’s Castle and this was the first time I encountered visitors trying to walk into our home! (Some visitors mistakenly think that the cottages are open to the public, and several times I have met people who expect Clovelly residents to be dressed in period costume!)\n\nI also lived on Independent Street for several years. A hidden gem in Clovelly. Quiet and peaceful, my beloved ‘Indie Street’ will always hold a special place in my heart ~ Both of my babies were born during my time on Indie Street and I found the most incredible friend in my next door neighbour. We’ve been on some adventures I can tell you… In fact one day, I may well blog about our friendship.\n\nWe moved into ‘Crazy Kate’s’ just in time to enjoy the exceptionally beautiful weather this summer. We spent every moment we could, swimming from the slip and my children searched tirelessly for ‘treasure’ on the beach. (They’re yet to discover any “real pirate treasure”, but our flower pots are now peppered with beautiful old bits of broken crockery and all manner of ‘precious’ flotsam and jetsam!).\n\nMy children are young and Clovelly provides the most magical backdrop for their childhood adventures, I cannot think of a finer place to inspire their vivid imaginations. How incredible to grow up in a house so intimately connected with the sea, so intrinsically linked to the tides, the weather and the wonderful characters associated with Clovelly life.\n\nAs the village takes on the beautiful golden hues of autumn, I have been warned by my neighbours that soon the stormy winter tides could wash right up onto Fish Street, and it’s important for us to have boards to put at the doors ‘just in case’! I know from having lived higher up the cobbled street, that it doesn’t happen often, but if there is a storm during a high tide, it’s important to protect this incredible property.\n\nI love talking to the Clovelly fishermen. Fiercely proud of their heritage, the beautifully told and incredible tales can give overwhelming feelings of hope and contentment, making me laugh or just as easily filling me with sadness as they recount the stories of love, life and loss.\n\nThe time we live in our houses is transient and I love the saying ‘We only ever borrow a home’.\n\nI often overhear visitors discussing the house and thinking out loud about life in Clovelly. It wasn’t so long ago that I looked on from the harbour, daydreaming about what it would be like to live in a house like this…\n\nClovelly history is very much a part of every day life and I take great comfort in living hand in hand with history.\n\nDesigned to allow crafters to indulge themselves, learning, making and taking home beautiful things. Inspired by Britain’s top crafting experts.\n\nI was invited to take part in the Handmade Fair and was utterly delighted to be included as one of Kirstie’s craft experts. What an honour to have my name listed amongst some of the most famous designers in the world ~ Cath Kidston, Kaffe Fassett and Annie Sloan to name but a few!\n\nDuring the weekend of 19th – 21st of September, the Handmade Fair was held in the stunning and surprisingly intimate, tranquil surroundings of Hampton Court Palace. Draped in miles of bunting and millions of Pom poms, the fair was a visual *feast* of vibrant colour! There was the most wonderful, positive, celebratory and respectful atmosphere, rather like a giant tea-party!\n\nAt Clovelly Silk, my family and I have had the absolute pleasure of working with Kirstie and her incredible team on several occasions.\n\nI’d just like to take a moment to say what an absolute inspiration Kirstie Allsopp is. I am in awe of her ability to inspire people, be that with creativity, house-hunting, home-making or indeed serious political debate.\n\nClovelly Silk first appeared on screen with the queen of craft in ‘Kirstie and Phil’s Perfect Christmas’. Anyone who saw this programme couldn’t fail to notice that during our piece, I was flirting *outrageously* with the handsome and oh-so charming Phil Spencer!\n\nIf you saw Kirstie’s last Christmas show, ‘Kirstie’s Crafty Christmas’ you will have seen me, with my dad Bill, on the show, making Tie Dye pants and socks! My goodness didn’t *that* cause a perfect stir(!) and I’m quite sure that you’re all wearing your tie-dye undergarments as you read this!\n\nThe Handmade Fair was crammed full of such *lovely* creative people ~ Crafters, performers and experts. There was a veritable feast of Artisan food available and overall, there was a genuine feeling that it didn’t matter if you were an absolute beginner, or an experienced crafter, because the weekend was about sharing knowledge and experiencing exciting, and inspiring things.\n\nAll too often, large-scale events and indeed many craft/design related projects involve spending a small fortune on equipment, materials and/or training. I am blissfully happy to report that the Handmade Fair had a great emphasis on using recycled or reclaimed materials and workshop packages were included in the price of tickets. Several stands had free classes/tuition and use of equipment, as well as helpful advice and discussions about setting up a craft-related business.\n\nOf course there was plenty of opportunity to buy gorgeous, handmade delights, but what a relief that the atmosphere was so friendly and conducive to selling/buying.\n\nI was struck by the distinctly nostalgic, vintage feel to the fair and it was so much fun seeing the fair-goers wearing such creative, colourful and gorgeous outfits, showcasing nothing but style!\n\nI was asked to take part in a Mollie Makes Mash Up ~ Live, on stage in the ‘Super Theatre’. Pitched as a battle of the crafts, where the lucky audience were able to watch stars of the craft world go head-to-head with their different craft disciplines!\n\nFollowing a ‘Ready Steady Cook’ style format, I was to ‘battle against’ Momtaz Begum-Hossain. Our challenge was to transform 1 metre of fabric in 45 mins.\n\nWith much excitement I started to plan what I could do on stage. I could never have imagined how difficult that would be! I had too many ideas and had to keep reminding myself that I only had 45mins! I decided to imagine what I would like to see, if I was in the audience, I guessed that my ‘opponent’ would do some sewing, so I chose to do something different and use not one, but lots of ‘no sew’ techniques, hoping to inspire the audience with my simple techniques, which achieve such stunning results!\n\nI chose the most gorgeous, foil-printed jersey fabric to work with and opted for a black, gold and silver theme, as I knew they would have maximum impact on stage and show up beautifully under the strong stage-lighting.\n\nI made some examples, showing alternative end results, using vintage fabric and even and old square scarf. I couldn’t wait to share my techniques.\n\nThe backstage area was dreamy, with a Bedouin-style tent, brimming with Kirstie’s beautiful furniture and dotted with strings of colourful pom-poms! In fact, the whole fair was held in a series of beautiful tents. The ‘Super Theatre’ tent, resembled a ‘Big Top’ and really was an incredible space!\n\nOur time on stage positively flew by and I was *so* pleased to meet members of the lovely audience afterwards, to answer questions and offer advice about their own craft projects. What a fantastic way to spend an afternoon!\n\nTo top it all off, I was honoured to be placed in the ‘Handmade 100′ top 100 crafters, as voted for by Handmade Fair Twitter followers!\n\nHow wonderful to be a part of a show which inspires creativity so wholeheartedly whilst encouraging and celebrating thriftiness, recycling as well as a love and respect of pre-loved items.\n\nOrganisers of the Handmade Fair and Kirstie, with her incredible team did such a fantastic job!\n\nWell done to the enthusiastic, super friendly crowd\n\nWe can’t wait ’till next year!"
