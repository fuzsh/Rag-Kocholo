        "text": "Without women’s contributions in the country’s economy and recognition of the value of their labor, development is no more possible in the society. The women society is on the dire need of being provided more facilities to ensure their participation in academic activities, development activities including business entrepreneurship and ownership facilities in the garment sectors. The women should also be encouraged to move forward by winning the social, familial, religious and surrounding impediments. We hope that Bangladesh would be able to build up a country on the basis of equal rights and justice between men and women. According to many scholars, if the efforts of women development and politico-economic empowerment of women continue to prevail, Bangladesh will be able to certainly overcome all of the impediments and go many steps ahead. The Bangladesh government, relevant organs, civil society and NGOs including all other organizations and institutions should recognize women’s dignity and status and provide them their due rights. In the context of globalization and international relations, Bangladesh would be more progressive and sustainable if women are properly paid their wages and other dues. We have carried out this study based on observation, focus group discussions, and exchanges of views on the conditions of female workers in the garment industries of Bangladesh. Besides, secondary data have been used in this study. After analyzing the women’s condition in the garment industries, we have provided some strategies in improving the women’s rights and dignity with due salary."
