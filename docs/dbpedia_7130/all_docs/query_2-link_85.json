        "text": "One of our favourite things about gift giving is getting creative with the wrapping, but when it comes to how to make a bow from ribbon, most of us are left stumped!\n\nMaking a bow using ribbon is actually quite easy, and a brilliant craft project to work on. All you need to remember is that bunny ear trick you learned when tying your shoelaces for the first time.\n\nIf that feels like a while ago, don't fret! Our step-by-step how to make a bow guide is guaranteed to get you up to speed on bow-tying fast, so you can add an extra special finishing flourish to your presents in seconds whether you're wrapping up a Mother's Day present or gifting a homemade present.\n\nOur step-by-step guide for how to make a bow from ribbon is the easiest method there is to make a bow and though the example uses satin ribbon, you can also use the same technique for twine or thin curling ribbon.\n\nWhat do you need to make a bow from ribbon?\n\nRibbon\n\nFirst you need to choose your ribbon. Silk, grosgrain and velvet ribbons all work well for bow-tying. Choose a colour that co-ordinates with your wrapping paper.\n\nScissors\n\nYou'll need a good quality pair of fabric scissors for a smooth, clean cut.\n\nMeasuring tape\n\nThis will help you cut the amount of ribbon you need and if you're making several ribbons, having the same length with help your ribbons look consistent.\n\nHow to make a bow out of ribbon\n\nSTEP 1: Use a measuring tap to cut a length of ribbon that measures 36cm. You can adjust the length to whatever size you like. Shorter lengths will lead to shorter bows and if you want your bow to have long tails, you'll need to allow for that when you cut your length of ribbon. Similarly, the wider the ribbon the bigger the bow, so bear that in mind.\n\nSTEP 2: Fold the piece of ribbon on half and with you finger press at the fold to that you have a crease, this won't be seen, it's just to guide you so you know where the centre point is.\n\nSTEP 3: Fold the right side of your ribbon over the left to create a classic charity ribbon shape. Use the centre crease you made to help you make each size even. It doesn't matter how much you leave for the ribbon tail at this stage as the shape and size of your ribbon will be adjusted in the final step.\n\nSTEP 4: Push down on the larger loop you made to create two even-sized loops or bunny-ears.\n\nSTEP 5: Fold both loops over each other and pull the ends, you'll begin to see the bow shape forming.\n\nSTEP 6: Slowly pull tight to make a knot in the centre. Then play around with the loops and tails to get your bow just right, trying to keep the ear loops and tails equal lengths. Finally, trim the ends of each tail at an angle.\n\nYour bow is now ready to be stuck onto gifts, instantly transforming them into extra special presents.\n\nDo you love crafting?
