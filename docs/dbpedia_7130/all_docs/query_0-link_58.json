        "text": "Weekdays are all about breakneck breakfasts. You know the sort – a few spoons of instant oatmeal or an overpriced pastry that’s bolted at desk, leaving telltale trail crumbs littering your keyboard to taunt your still-rumbling tummy until the bland sandwich at lunchtime.\n\nBut Saturdays and Sundays are for slowing down; merging the first two meals of the day into that thoroughly pleasing portmanteau: brunch. If that meal appeals, then you’ll go wild for an Indian-style spread.\n\nIdle over idlis, dilly dally over dosai, unwind over upma, putter over pittu, or catch up over kichuri – plan your spread wisely, eat well, yawn widely, then head back to bed and treat yourself to a good long post-prandial nap.\n\nThe cookbook\n\nMaunika Gowardhan’s ‘Indian Kitchen‘\n\nWhether you grew up with authentic Indian food or came to it later in life, Maunika Gowardhan’s Indian Kitchen will have you rushing to your own culinary salon quicksmart to rustle up a big ole brunch. Think spongy, soft khaman dhokla, scrambled paneer to serve with crisp toast triangles, Mumbai sandwiches, potato burger-like dabeli, masala omelettes, savoury semolina upma, and flaked spiced rice with potatoes. You’ll want to make everything – so ensure your table has strong legs and a large surface area.\n\nTo read more about ‘Indian Kitchen’, click here\n\nThe easy way\n\nPapi’s Pickles Big Stacks\n\nWhether you opt for a South Indian or Sri Lankan stack, Papi’s packs a lot of satisfaction into a few plastic pots. The menus might not be typical brunch fare, but it’s fair to say the dishes would be delightfully received at any time of day. In the former, you’ll find semolina kitchadi, devilled aubergines and green bean thoran; the latter will make a platter of coconut rice, mackerel sambal and aubergine curry. Just heat’n’eat – or, if you can’t wait to be replete, skip the second step and enjoy as is.\n\n£8 – available on selected days through Farmdrop – for more info click here\n\nThe Recipes\n\nK.O. Rasoi\n\nBrit-born, Indian-and East-African-rooted Sanjana is a complete culinary badass when it comes to brunch or indeed any other meal. Steal slick style ideas from her pretty plating, but don’t just look – cook! Keep carbs firmly on the menu, and say hello to aloo parathas, mini masala dosa, and masala pooris served alongside heaping helpings of Gujarati potato-cashew curry. Loosen your belt, add piles of bottlegourd dumplings and Tanzanian donuts to the mix, and wash it all down with lashings of cardamom chai.\n\nFollow Sanjana on Twitter @KORasoi\n\nVeg Recipes of India\n\nWhether your eyes are bigger than your belly, the two are of similar sizes, or the latter is larger, Dassana’s vast recipe remit will sate your appetite for Indian brunch ideas. Her dedicated ‘breakfast’ section includes around one hundred and fifty dishes and, whilst there’s an emphasis on awfully authentic items like Keralite kadala and pittu and Sindhi pakwan, this cook doesn’t shy away from convenience. Want to know how to make instant oats dosa or whip up upma in the microwave? Dassana is your woman.\n\nFollow Dassana on Twitter @Dassana\n\nCook In A Curry\n\nBefore Maunika published her Magnum Opus cookbook, Indian Kitchen, she showcased her skills and culinary heritage through the recipes and stories on her blog. Love egg and chips? Pop on a pan of Parsi-style kanda papeta per eda. Or use those eggs to make masala omelettes and spicy scrambles. Breadhead? Keep it light and lean with cornbread-like, curry leaf-strewn, steamed khaman dhokla, or plan a sinful spread with a menu led by deep-fried potato-stuffed bread pakoda and Mumbai chilli cheese sarnies.\n\nFollow Maunika on Twitter @cookinacurry\n\nDeena Kakaya\n\nDeena’s dishes are not the norm. Don’t expect anything unadulterated, because this lady likes to tweak, twist and turn a classic comestible into something entirely her own; almost always incorporating Indian flavours. If a brunch with punchy flavours is on the agenda, Deena’s recipes deliver. For an eye-opening, sense-awakening spread, prepare pancakes with Courgette, butternut squash and gram flour or Apple, yogurt, lime and cardamom; Spinach, ricotta, saffron and fennel cakes; and Gajar halwa porridge.\n\nFollow Deena on Twitter @deenakakaya\n\nThe gear\n\nIf you want to make incredible idli, perfect patra AND divine dhokla, you should get…\n\nA 3-in-1 idli, dhokla and patra steamer and handi!\n\nIf you’re partial to paratha or want to chomp chapattis, you should get…\n\nA chappati fluffer!\n\n…And a stylish velan!\n\nIf you want to make use of the microwave, you should get…\n\nA microwave idli-maker!\n\nIf you’re dotty about dosa, you should get…\n\nAn electric crêpe maker!\n\nIf you’re crazy about coconut chutney, you should get…\n\nA coconut scraper!\n\nBrunching for a cause\n\nIf you’ve got the brunch bug and need an excuse to lay on an Indian spread, invite guests to gather and chow down for a cause.
