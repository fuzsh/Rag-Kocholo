        "text": "𝐁𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐓𝐕 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐰𝐞𝐞𝐤: 𝐈𝐓𝐕 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠; 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐁𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐬𝐡 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭; 𝐒𝐨 𝐋𝐨𝐧𝐠 𝐁𝐨𝐛 ITV is grumbling about the BBC spending money on acquired programming (specifically Suits). Kevin Lygo seems to ask the BBC to spend all its money on new commissions and not compete with ITV for acquired shows. Managed competition anyone? It sounds impractical. Originals are expensive and the BBC will always need some cheaper acquired content to pad out its services. And is ITV really saying there is not enough US content to go round, or that Suits is so distinctive? There is nothing new in BBC competitors complaining: why spend public money on shows the market would provide anyway? I complained when at Sky but was ever vulnerable to the riposte that the BBC was rescuing content from behind the paywall. ITV had a better case, subject to the lesser riposte that the BBC was rescuing us from watching ITV ads. Fair in principle, if hard to value, but the market has now answered the question. Several streamers offer bundles with ads that are typically c£3 cheaper than one with no ads, so it seems people will pay £36 pa to avoid ads. So should I think about the £169.50 licence fee as £133.50 for the content plus £36 for avoiding ads? Meanwhile, I was intrigued by media coverage across several countries on Sky NZ (where I am a board director) agreeing an expanded content deal with the BBC. The coverage zeroed in on the value of BBC content (and British content generally) as highly differentiated among the sea of US content from the streamers. Differentiation really matters in the modern media industry. Sport is king of differentiation, but beyond sport, the British voice is perhaps a prince. Something to remember in the UK and, going full circle, why we value original British content over importing more US shows. Finally, so long Bob Bakish, now defenestrated from Paramount. I liked Bob. He and I were on the board of Nickelodeon UK together. I learned a lot, we did some deals together – carriage on Sky and Viacom ad sales representation – and he was good company. But when you fall out with the family, it can end quickly. I empathise. The Paramount saga has now moved beyond parody, with Bob replaced by an “Office of the CEO” with three co-CEOs. Really? The press release claims these three will work “to develop a comprehensive, long-range plan”. I suggest don’t bother, the new owners will bring their own plan and won’t care what you think. Reflecting this, the gang of three exited this week’s earnings call to the tune from Mission Impossible. Does any of this matter in the UK? Whoever emerges as the new Paramount owner, a key question is which bits do they like (the studio?) and which bits do they not (all else?). Then, among the latter, will they maintain, or sell, or close? Uncertain times ahead at Five, and I wonder if this could fire the starting gun for broadcaster consolidation in Europe?\n\nThe BBC defies a UK commissioning downturn in 2023 A new report from #AmpereAnalysis reveals an 18% decline last year in the UK’s market for scripted TV commissions (#Drama, #SciFi, #Crime & #Thriller, etc.) as major UK broadcasters cut spend and most global SVODs trimmed investment in international content. Changes in consumer behaviour and a weak advertising market saw #PayTV operators and commercial free-to-air broadcasters slash scripted commissions. UK scripted commissioning activity fell by 48% at local Pay TV operators, 36% at commercial free-to-air broadcasters, and 21% at #SVoD services. However, the #BBC’s scripted commissions remained stable with the public service broadcaster focusing on Kids, Family and Crime genres and ramping up literary adaptations and multiple-episode series orders. As other players reduced their scripted commissioning activity, the BBC managed to maintain constant levels, increasing its share of UK #scripted TV commissions to 50% last year. Early last year, the broadcaster announced a raft of cost-saving measures in response to the license fee freeze and wider economic pressures. One of the actions was to cut 1,000 hours of original programming annually and trim spending on original content. However, the impact of these reductions has initially been felt by reductions in cheaper-to-produce unscripted programming. As the BBC tackled budgetary pressures, changes in the scripted commissioning strategy of 2023 can be seen versus prior years. Children & Family grabbed the most orders of the BBC’s scripted commissions, up by 23% year-on-year. Crime & Thriller titles were up 16%. Comedy fell out of favour, enduring a 27% drop. It was the most heavily impacted of all scripted genres in 2023 with an overall decline of 41% among UK commissioners As the Corporation responds to evolving media consumption, it is making the switch from one-episode specials to a multiple-episode content strategy to expand its iPlayer audience and satisfy VoD binge-watching. As a result, the proportion of BBC commissions which were one-episode specials dropped to just 7.5%, its lowest for five years. In another risk-mitigation move, the BBC increased its investment in IP with an existing following. Roughly a fifth of BBC scripted commissions last year were book adaptations. Favoured by many other European broadcasters, co-commissioning offers cost-sharing potential that the BBC could further explore. Last year, 13% of the BBC’s scripted commissions ordered were co-commissions. Co-commissions involve trade-offs around control of rights, but may offer cost-efficiencies. German broadcaster #ZDF uses co-commissioning more extensively, with over 30% of its scripted output co-commissioned. The BBC’s late 2022 co-production deal with #DisneyBrandedTelevision for Doctor Who offers an idea of how funding for high-end scripted commissioning could evolve in the UK. Ampere Analysis\n\n🗓 June 7th: BBC's Return to Broadcasting & Starting Over On June 7th, 1946, the BBC resumed regular television broadcasting after a seven-year hiatus caused by World War II. This momentous event marked a significant step in post-war recovery, symbolizing the resilience and determination to rebuild and move forward. 🎥 The Return to Broadcasting The first program to be broadcast was the Mickey Mouse cartoon, the same cartoon that was last shown before the suspension, symbolizing a return to normalcy and continuity - more than mere technical restoration. 🌟 Modern-Day Parallels The BBC's return to broadcasting after a long hiatus draws striking parallels to recent military conflicts, as well as other global disruptions such as COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic forced many industries to pause, adapt, or transform. As we emerge from these disruptions, we are reminded of the importance of resilience, adaptability, and the spirit of starting anew. 🔄 Starting Over After Disruption In our professional and personal lives, we might face unexpected (or even planned) disruptions that require us to pause and then restart with renewed determination. Whether it's navigating the aftermath of a global pandemic, returning to work after an extended long maternity leave, recovering from a severe illness, or coming back to the workforce after a sabbatical, finding the motivation to start again can be challenging but ultimately rewarding. Here are some key lessons we can draw from the BBC's experience and apply to our own lives: 💪 Resilience and Adaptability Just as the BBC adapted to the changing circumstances during and after the war, we must be resilient and adaptable in the face of disruptions. Embracing change and finding new ways to overcome challenges is crucial for growth and progress. 👁 Optimism and Vision The resumption of broadcasting was a beacon of hope and optimism for a war-weary nation. Similarly, maintaining a positive outlook and a clear vision for the future can help us navigate through difficult times and emerge stronger. 🕸 Community and Connection Broadcasting played a vital role in reconnecting the nation and fostering a sense of community. In our lives, staying connected with others and seeking support from our communities can provide the strength and encouragement needed to start again. 🏆 Celebrating Small Wins The simple act of resuming the Mickey Mouse cartoon symbolized continuity and a return to normalcy. Celebrating small milestones and achievements can boost morale and provide motivation as we work towards larger goals. BBC's return to broadcasting provides inspiration to navigate through challenges and build a brighter future by embracing resilience, optimism, community, and celebrating our progress. 🎶 \"It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me, and I'm feeling good.\" – Michael Bublé, 2005 🌟Let's be the best version of ourselves!\n\nThe BBC is one of the world's most respected broadcasters, but it has its fair share of dodgy practices; one stands out. Not so long ago, I switched to Radio 2, and Tony Blackburn—one of the BBC's most experienced presenters—did a 'shoutout' for a listener. I immediately switched off. 'Shoutouts' are a strangely popular bedrock of BBC broadcasting. I can only imagine that some time back, someone with sufficient managerial heft but bereft of any programming experience had the idea that because the BBC is partly funded by TV licence fees paid by the British public, the public should be on the radio. Bad idea. One of the outcomes is the 'shoutout'—a link presented by a show host that includes a message from a listener, e.g. \"Billy Bob from Brighton wants to send a shoutout to his mother, Eunice, driving to Bognor Regis\". At first consideration, it sounds harmless, but it's terrible and lazy radio. What a host says between songs or components on a show—is either a stand-by, step-back or step-in link. By default, when they open the microphone and start talking, they create a stand-by link—the listener is standing by for something that is ideally compelling, interesting, entertaining or informative; essentially, something with *value*. There is expectation on the part of the listener. If the host doesn't deliver value, they are essentially wasting the attention paid by the listener. This risks being annoying. If the host does say something annoying, it becomes a step-back link—metaphorically, the listener becomes increasingly detached from the programme and is one step closer to tuning out. Ideally, whenever a host switches on the microphone, they should do so with a step-in link in mind—something that will encourage the listener to metaphorically *step in* to the conversation. This can simply be nodding in agreement. And this is where one of radio's programming paradoxes kicks into gear. Radio is a mass medium aimed at the individual. Wait; it gets weirder: You have to consider the broader audience to create the intimacy of talking to a single listener. And this is where the BBC gets it wrong. A shoutout for Billy Bob from Brighton to his mother, Eunice, is only a step-in link for Billy Bob and Eunice (if they're listening); it's a step-back link for everyone else. The BBC think the shoutout secures an individual connection by creating links for individuals. It doesn't; it alienates all but the individuals concerned. Plus, because the host doesn't have to think of a link, a shoutout is lazy. Creating step-in links requires considerable thought and expertise. It also demands knowledge of the target audience's typical traits and an intimate understanding of human behaviour, notably its commonalities. This increases the chance that the listener will think, \"Hey, they're talking to me.\" For more free insights into successful #radio #broadcasting, click on the link below. #training https://lnkd.in/eyajfWcf\n\nTelevision: Its Role, Effects, and History What is Television? Television is a communication system that broadcasts visual and auditory signals from a transmitter to electronic receivers equipped with screens and speakers, converting them back into images and sound. It is also a mass communication tool that delivers broadcasted images and sounds to viewers. Etymology: The term television is derived from the Greek word tele (meaning “far”) and the Latin word visio (meaning “sight”). The Turkish Language Association suggested alternatives such as uzgöreç and uzgörüm, but these were not widely adopted . About Television: Television broadcasting involves transmitting moving or stationary images, with or without sound, in color or black-and-white, via electromagnetic waves directly to the public. Broadcast Types: • NTSC: Developed in 1954 in the USA, still used in the USA, Canada, Mexico, and Japan. • PAL: Developed in Germany, used in European countries and Australia. • SECAM: Used in France, Russia, Hungary, and Algeria. Social Impact: Before digital broadcasting, viewers were merely recipients of TV content. With digital broadcasts, interaction became possible. The accessibility and impactful visual and auditory elements of television have caused many intellectuals to view it with skepticism. Today, the primary goal of television broadcasting is advertising and commerce, but it also has psychological effects, leading to what is known as television addiction. Television Addiction: Television addiction, while not a physical addiction, refers to the significant role TV watching plays in a person’s life due to its euphoric effects. It is similar to addictions to drugs, video games, the internet, and gambling. Factors such as poor time management, unhealthy eating, and psychological issues can contribute to television addiction . Television in Turkey: Television broadcasting in Turkey began on July 9, 1952, by Istanbul Technical University. The widespread introduction of television in Turkey occurred with the enforcement of the TRT Law on May 1, 1964. The history and development of television broadcasting in Turkey are extensive, with Star TV becoming the first private television channel in 1990 . Harmful Effects of Television: • Prolonged TV watching can damage the immune system and cause hormonal imbalances, potentially leading to cancer. • Children who watch a lot of TV may experience psychological issues and early puberty. • Exposure to violence, sexuality, inappropriate news, and low-quality programs can lead to psychological problems. • Excessive TV watching can lead to insomnia and eye problems. • Social activity decreases and obesity rates increase among heavy TV watchers .\n\nThe first commercial radio station opened in Pittsburgh in 1920...two years before the BBC started broadcasting. In those 104 years, the medium has changed...especially in Presentation style. Radio became the dominant medium in America between the 1930's and 50's. Radio sets were cheap and mass produced. Every home could own one (more than phones or gramaphones). Americans began to become more 'auditory minded'. Instead of addressing an audience, radio encouraged speaking TO an audience. That idea of speaking to one person isn't new. In 1936, psychologist Rudolf Arnheim said \"If a man is speaking before others, he should also speak TO them...as if they were sitting in front of them.\" A BBC producer in 1933 said that broadcasters need to have certain qualities: \"...human, sincere, unaffected.\" That they need to use \"...cadence, hesitation, stresses, changes of pace and general vocal gesture.\" Precisely what we aim for in 2024. People are people and relate in the same way, no matter the era. Then along came TV. Supplying visuals to the sound. The speaking style reverted back to type - formal, authoritative and dramatic. Next in the evolution - the place we sit now. Social Media. Social Media gave a voice to everyone. We all have a phone. We can all record 'video'...we can all broadcast. With this enormous resource came an upheavel in presentation style, on screen. As with radio, presentation on Social Media mirrors the creator's audience. It changed from authoritative to informal...just like radio before it. But still, the aim is the same: connect through sincerity. Be real. Show your passion. Help me understand. As a radio host, podcaster, youtuber, blogger...your task is not new. The rules you work from have existed as long as radio has (over 100 years.) Radio took the stylings of actors and public speakers and altered them to relate better to the new environment that it caused - personal, honest communication. Radio brought new ways of listening and with it, new ways of speaking. Social Media has done the same thing. It's a natural progression. The difference is that you are no longer limited to what dictates 'content'. You can do or say almost whatever you wish in whatever style you wish. Learn the techniques that are most effective for you and you will attract an audience. Be real. Be sincere. Be honest. Be passionate.\n\nHow I Built Confidence as a Broadcaster Being a broadcaster requires that you're about your wit all the time. Talking and analysing issues, asking pertinent questions and being a source of information and education to your listeners can be a daunting ask for anyone. And if you're the type of person whose reserved, always conservative and barely likes airing their opinions, then broadcasting is not for you! That's a lie ❌❌❌ You can succeed as a Broadcaster even if you're a shy, introverted person. Some even call us sharp shooters because we always speak our minds. Some of us are. But the majority of us aren't. If you're aiming to start your career in broadcasting and you're the shy type, then you need to read this because this is how I built my confidence as a broadcaster. Building your confidence as a Broadcaster is not a nice should-have; it is a must-have. You'll not sound compelling on the mic if you're not confident. Confidence is knowing what is, and speaking fearlessly on what is. But how do you build the type of confidence that gets your listeners hooked? 1. Know what you're talking about: Broadcasting is a knowledge business, not a voice business. Know your stuff. Do the research. Read the articles and newspapers. Read the old and new research. Do the work. The grind is in knowing your numbers and facts and counterarguments. Your confidence first comes from knowing deeply what you're talking about. 2. Speak with a cadence and tempo: Knowing what you know is useless to the listeners if it isn't communicated well. Good communication in broadcasting differs from program to program, and from issues to issues. Listen to the best broadcasters, the ones with years of experience, and imitate them. Copy what works, that way you don't have to stress so much. 3. Have a script: Having a script is one of those broadcasting skills that is being extinguished at the alter of spontaneouity. If you're not a professional yet, then get that script ready. The script acts as a guide for you on the show, so you don't move haphazardly, depriving the show of flow and structure. 4. Listen to your off-air dub: Some media organisations conduct programs post-mortem immediately after a show. A post mortem is a producer and a broadcaster(s) listening to a show after it ends, analysing and dissecting segments of the show, the program's flow, how words were used, and many more. If your organisation doesn't do a postmortem, then do it yourself. Either record yourself while you're on air, or get the recording from the production's office. Go home and diligently listen to how you sound on air, and the things you can improve on. Listening to your off-air tapes allows you see your flaws and correct them fast. The better you get at it, the more confident you'll become. Are you a broadcaster journalist? What are some important lessons you can share with new broadcasters?"
