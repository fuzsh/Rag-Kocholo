        "text": "After the partition of India in 1947, Shashikanta's family, like millions of other Hindu families of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), faced the dilemma of whether to migrate from the land in which they have been living for centuries. But Shashikanta Sengupta, an eccentric lawyer, stubbornly refuses to leave his motherland. Widower Shashikanta has two children, Minoti and Bidyut. Anuprava Devi is an affectionate old aunt who lives with the family. The family has a house in Narail, a small provincial town on the bank of the Chitra river. Some Muslim neighbors eye Shashaikanta's house. But the family refuse to migrate. Shashikanta's children Minoti and Bidyut are friends with the neighboring Muslim children- Badal, Salma and Nazma. Minoti and Badal become more than friends. The children grow up. Badal goes to Dhaka University. Those were the days in 1960's when the atmosphere of the universities was charged with political radicalism. Badal got involved in anti-military student movement and while participating in a demonstration for democracy was killed by police firing.Shashikanta's brother Nidhukanta is an idealist doctor who lives in their ancestral village on the other side of the Chitra River. During the 1964 riot between the Hindus and the Muslims, his daughter Basanti, a widow, is raped. Basanti commits suicide by drowning herself in the Chitra River. Nidhukanta's family migrate to India. All these untoward incidents happening around affect Shashikanta's failing health. He suffers a heart stroke and passes away. Minoti and Anuprava finally leave for the border en route to Calcutta.\n\nDuring the 1971 liberation war of Bangladesh against Pakistan in a remote village beside the river Modhumoti, Motaleb Mollah, a landlord and a local Muslim leader, collaborated with the marauding Pakistan army. After the death of his elder brother, Motaleb married his sister-in-law who had a young son named Bachchu, by the elder brother. There was an idealist Brahmin teacher in the village, Amulya Chakrabarty, who had some influence over the young Bachchu. The teacher had a daughter, a widow, named- Shanti. When the war with Pakistan broke out, watching a genocide perpetrated by the Pakistani soldiers, Bachchu joined the Bengali guerrilla's. The experiences of the bitter war shattered Bachchu's world of innocence. His guerrilla unit was deployed on the other side of the Modhumoti river to conduct operations against the Pakistani soldiers and their collaborators. Motaleb Mollah, spurred by the title Chairman conferred upon him by the wily Pakistani captain, continued to create havoc on the people around. With his gradual moral degradation Motaleb developed a carnal desire for Shanti. Then one day Motaleb's retainers killed teacher Amulya Chakrabarty and Motaleb forced Shanti to marry him. In the code of the guerrilla's the penalty of a collaborator was death sentence. But as Motaleb was Bachchu's father, his comrades were procrastinating. Then one evening Bachchu himself took a decision and crossed the river Modhumoti with a dinghy and a rifle and with a determined sense of mission.\n\nThe main setting of the movie was a disastrous cyclone and tidal bore which attacked Bangladesh in 1970. That vast spate washed away an opulent girl and a destitute man to a secluded island where no sign of other human was found. Dumping the class-distinction, they fell in love and founded that isolated island as their paradise. Even after their rescue, brutal social prejudices could not separate them and thus they forded across that primitive fringe with the message of love and equal-ism.\n\nOnce upon a time, there lived a king. The king was not able to produce any heir to the throne through his three wives. The king was depressed and spent large amount of time by himself in the forest. A priest in the forest saw the king's misery and gave him mangoes of bearing. The priest instructed the king to feed the fruits to his wives and then they would conceive children. The king gave his three wives the fruits as instructed by the priest. Two elder queens did not produce any children, as they ate it with disbelief. However, the younger queen gave birth to catapults: seven boys and one girl, when the king was on a voyage. The elder queens became jealous and buried the babies in the garden before the younger queen gained consciousness from pregnancy. The babies magically blossom into seven champak flowers and a trumpet flower. The last baby, the girl, was born some time after first seven babies in a time when the elder queens left the room with seven babies and this enabled the maid to hide the baby from the elder queens and named the child Parul. Elder queens, then, placed seven puppies on the younger queen's bedside and claimed the queen gave birth to seven puppies. Champa grew up in the forest. After learning her origin from her maid, she helped to revive her brothers into princes."
