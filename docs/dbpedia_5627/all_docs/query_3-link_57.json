My job as principal surrounds me with 11-14 year olds on a daily basis and I go in and out of classes frequently, interacting with this age group. But I asked myself the question “Can I remember what it was like to spend a whole day as a 12 year old?” My classes were double Social Studies, French, Maths, English and double Art. The students were wonderful and really took part in the experience by helping me feel welcome in their world. At lunch I went to sit on my … Continue reading Mr. Kestner becomes 7th grader for a day\n\nGrade 5 Halloween Trail @ Le Musee d’Art Ancien in Brussels\n\nThis month, our Grade 5 students discovered the fabulous Musée’s collection through a fun “Halloween Trail”. Pupils followed the trail in groups of 4, answered questions and found many skulls, skeletons and spooky monsters along the way. They also practiced their observational skills by drawing some of the artworks. After lunch, they walked to the Grand-Place to practice their French (each group had to ask 3 questions in French to someone in the street or in shops), to draw the gorgeous guild houses and of course … dig in a waffle!! Continue reading Grade 5 Halloween Trail @ Le Musee d’Art Ancien in Brussels\n\nMindfulness in the Middle School Classroom\n\nEvery day, first period, middle school students sit in silence, clear their minds of what has been and what will be and pause. The teacher takes them through a process called mindfulness. Mindfulness can be defined as: “paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally.” We know that practicing mindfulness has shown to offer benefits such as increased self-awareness, better … Continue reading Mindfulness in the Middle School Classroom\n\nHigh School art trip to London – a reflection\n\nThough I live one hour away from any large city in Belgium, I consider myself psychologically a city person; I absolutely adore the thrill that a city brings me. London was no exception. There were a multitude of memorable moments experienced during our four-day stay in the city-center, but a few truly highlight the great time I had. One was the trip to both the Tate Britain and Tate Modern galleries. We started off at the Tate Britain and made our way to the Tate Modern across the river Thames by boat. The Tate Modern impressed me with its stupendous … Continue reading High School art trip to London – a reflection\n\nPC tablets in Timbertops\n\nIn Timbertops we were delighted to receive PC Tablets for the children, two per class. The children like to sit around the table in small groups and are learning to take turns; this is very important as the Tablets are very sensitive. They love to use them to play their favorite games on Poisson Rouge, especially Ten Green Bottles! It’s also great fun to use the Tablets to draw using the 2simple software. We are still in the discovering stage, but we are looking forward to seeing what else we can use them for! Continue reading PC tablets in Timbertops\n\nFrench book club for 2012-13 has been launched\n\nOur 2012-2013 French book club called LEGERE (to read in Latin) has been launched. We have 33 members that will rotate all year long. After deliberation, our members have chosen 7 fields of interest: Coups de coeur (1): 1. Toni MORRISON (USA): Home/Bourgois 2.

Cebile, Alicia, Lisa, Marie, Joséphine and Magalie were able to raise a total of 686 € and 14 new sponsors. Says Marie des Neiges de Lantsheere, one of the students involved in the fundraising ”This was the very first time, this year, that our new team came into action to help the Annai Erika school in India. Although the idea was simple; selling cakes as well as bracelets at the entry of the parent teacher conference, it was … Continue reading High Schoolers raise 686 Euro for Annai Erica home\n\nLearning French through Art\n\nIn October, one French class has discovered a French artist called Niki de Saint Phalle. She was born in France and grew up in New York. She became famous in 1964 when she started to make colorful figures, first made of wool, yarn, paper-maché and later of polyester. Niki’s biggest project was the “Tarot Garden” which she began to work on in Tuscany in 1979. Niki de Saint Phalle died in California of emphysema on May 22, 2002 as a consequence of years of inhaling toxic polyester fumes while working on her art projects. Thanks to this artist, the students reviewed shapes, colours … Continue reading Learning French through Art\n\nTime Riders author Alex Scarrow visits St. John’s\n\nOn Monday, October 15, the Middle School and the MHS Library welcomed visiting author Alex Scarrow to St. John’s for an all-day visit. Mr. Scarrow addressed Middle School students in an assembly where he talked about his background as a rock musician and video game concept developer, and explained what his series the Time Riders was all about. The page-turning, action-adventure stories that centers on three kids who have been recruited to help save the world from people going back in time and changing the present, were made vivid by his re-enactment of scenes and his enthusiastic portrayal of the … Continue reading Time Riders author Alex Scarrow visits St. John’s\n\nHigh School speaker lectures\n\nBeing new at St. John’s, I was delighted to have been invited last week to a talk by Dr. Alexis Tengan, the first in a series of colloquia organized by Dr. Castillo-Coronado. We were greeted by a number of exquisite artifacts lying solemnly on an African-themed green and white cloth on the table. What marvel to see those “out of this world” artifacts most of which were from Dr. Tengan’s native Ghana: human-shaped wood carvings, animal figurines, a large round spiked jar, and the like. Dr. Tengan gave us an idea of their original context by talking about a worldview … Continue reading High School speaker lectures\n\nThe Tower of Babel – a grade 5 art project\n\nGrade 5 looked at Bruegel’s Tower of Babel and has started building a gigantic Tower of Babel with cardboard. Each pupil has been given a cardboard box to make a house with it. They have been busy learning how to decorate it with Alix and Philippe, 2 artists from the art group Boite a Clous (cardboard/recycling art). They have already started to place their houses on a 2 meter diameter cardboard structure to create a huge city. The finished piece will be exhibited in the PAC foyer after the break. We will post updates as we progress with the project! … Continue reading The Tower of Babel – a grade 5 art project\n\nWhy ‘Well-Being and Happiness’ will enhance our St. John’s Community\n\nOn Thursday 11th October, Mr. Daniel Johnston and I attended a ‘Positive Psychology’ Conference at Wellington College in Berkshire UK. We were there to learn about a school, which is very similar to St John’s and how they developed an approach to community wellness, which is both radical and completely obvious for a school with a 150 year tradition based upon Christian Values. You can find out more about Wellington College, its IB programme and it’s proud tradition by visiting the website. At St John’s, in June this year, The High School hosted a meeting of interested parents and teachers … Continue reading Why ‘Well-Being and Happiness’ will enhance our St. John’s Community\n\nFantastic Forrestia – 3rd graders enjoy companionship\n\nRecently, the 3rd grade students and teachers enjoyed going to Forestia, a wonderful adventure park where we did lots of activities which encourage working together, team-building and healthy risk-taking! All of that fitted extremely well with the central idea of our “Budding Buddies” Unit of Inquiry: We need to communicate and collaborate to achieve a common goal. Some memorable student quotes (taken from student reflections): “My favourite part was petting the ponies. They were soft and cute. I wanted to stay there forever.” Martina “I really enjoyed the Forestia Field Trip because we were all playing together and caring for each … Continue reading Fantastic Forrestia – 3rd graders enjoy companionship\n\nInternational Festival: celebrating our diversity\n\nInternational Festival is one of the most popular events on the St. John’s calendar. It is a day to show nationalism while celebrating diversity. Most students and many parents participate in the parade, while 28 countries have decorated a booth to teach students about their country during and giving people a taste of the national food or drink in the evening. The daytime parade video is already available, the evening parade will be live streamed at 19:00, both at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/st-john-s-international-school Continue reading International Festival: celebrating our diversity\n\nThe Road Less Traveled: Podcasts, Photo Puzzles and Flipbooks!\n\nExperiences: Middle school media courses are off to an exciting start this year. 8th graders are creating podcasts, while 6th graders have had a great experience making photo puzzles. 7th graders have worked hard on storytelling through drafting narrative short stories, creating storyboards and topping that off with animation, sound effects and film. Reflections: After a wide range of experiences in each course- viewing and analyzing model work, producing their own work, getting feedback and revising their work… we’ve also taken some time to reflect on our experiences thus far. Quotes from 7 th grade Students’ Reflections on the Media … Continue reading The Road Less Traveled: Podcasts, Photo Puzzles and Flipbooks!\n\nFlying paper airplanes for bricks\n\nToday at lunchtime, students came out in force to buy and fly paper airplanes as far as they could on “the bridge”, the connector between Middle School and the Performing Arts Center. The 10th grade students were hosting the event in support of their charity in Sri Lanka. The proceeds will go to building houses there and, as Mr. Macdonald says, “Each plane is another brick in the wall”. Continue reading Flying paper airplanes for bricks\n\nThinkers in action\n\nOur professional journey: departure point – St John’s fifth grade classroom; destination – unknown. So how did it all begin? We had been using a range of thinking strategies in the classroom for several years and had been encouraged by the students’ responses. We decided to find out more about the theory attached to thinking routines, questioning strategies, brain development etc so we immersed ourselves in a range of up to date educational literature which was to have a dramatic impact in our classrooms. Excited and encouraged by the insights into our students’ thinking and their learning we really wanted … Continue reading Thinkers in action\n\nFall sports season and ISSTs\n\nFall is here. The days are shorter, the air is colder, the grass is muddier. This sports season is nearing its end, and ISST Championships are approaching. Our teams have worked hard up to this point, and results show it. The St. John’s varsity girls and boys soccer and volleyball teams have played a combined 41 games – and have only lost 8. Our cross country team has placed several runners in top ten finishes. Hard works pays off, and talent is a crucial ingredient to success. Our highly qualified and committed coaching staff takes care of the rest. We … Continue reading Fall sports season and ISSTs\n\nParents celebrate teachers on World Teachers Day\n\nThe St. John’s staff were in for a treat this afternoon as parents baked cakes and served teachers a glass of wine to celebrate World Teachers Day. The Parent Teacher Program (PTP) took the opportunity to thank the teachers for all they do for the students. The PTP has been very active in their appreciation of teachers and staff: they put a thank you card in each teacher’s mailbox at the start of the school year and put “cup-a-soup” boxes in the staff rooms in September to give the teachers a healthy, hearty snack as fall approached. The staff showed … Continue reading Parents celebrate teachers on World Teachers Day\n\nThe High School staff goes conkers\n\nAn average Friday lunch period turned into a fun one for High School faculty when one of the teachers suggested a game of conkers. Conkers is a traditional game in Britain and Ireland played using chestnuts. The game is played by two players, each with a conker threaded onto a piece of string: they take turns striking each other’s conker until one breaks. Some teachers thought they could gain an advantage by manipulating the chestnut, but ended up injuring themselves in the process. Continue reading The High School staff goes conkers\n\nKindergarten students use bottles to build a maze\n\nTrue to the Reggio Emilia pedagogy and the Primary Years Programme (PYP), our Kindergarten is collecting recyclable material for many projects that we will work on throughout this coming school year. The project we are now working towards is a maze for the Timbertops garden made of wine bottles. Two weeks ago, in our Friday letter, we asked parents to send in their empty and label-free wine bottles and we have been thrilled with the response. The children have already started reflecting on what a maze is and how they would like their maze to look. This is the start … Continue reading Kindergarten students use bottles to build a maze\n\nElementary students are writing and publishing a book in French\n\nWe are pleased to announce that this year, our French-speaking students from Grade 2 onwards will be writing a book in French. The students will be guided by an expert who has already conducted many workshops in Belgian schools. “Les Aventurêves” is a very well-known workshops organizer throughout Belgium, Switzerland, Canada and France. Many stories and books have been published already. We are very excited by this new venture, which will take place throughout the school year and will conclude with an evening reception, during which our budding writers will be able to present and sign their books, the plot … Continue reading Elementary students are writing and publishing a book in French\n\nFirst grade movie stars\n\nToday, the first graders in Mrs. Gardner’s class had quite an exciting experience: they were filmed by a professional crew. The crew had built a small studio in our dance studio, with lighting and cameras and microphones. The kids were asked the following question: “What do you want your computer to do in the future?” Since first graders often have quite an imagination, the responses were quite diverse. One of the students “wants my computer to make my dreams come true”. Another student envisions computers to “go to the store and buy hot dogs.” The students were quite mature in this daunting … Continue reading First grade movie stars\n\nSt. John’s varsity soccer teams host American International School of Bucharest\n\nThe varsity soccer teams hosted the American International School of Bucharest, Romania this weekend for the first time in our history. The trip to Belgium came as a result of the basketball varsity teams visit to Bucharest this past winter.

During the summer, Ari and her family discussed her soon to be birthday party. Ari realized that she has been a fortunate little girl, receiving so many wonderful things in her life but that it was time to give back. Thus the idea to give back to someone else was germinated. And it grew and grew, with a little help from family, friends and Saint John’s community. Ari’s idea … Continue reading Fourth grader raises 2,700 Euro for Autism Europe by organizing talent show\n\nFounders Day celebration\n\nToday, we celebrated Founders Day, the day the Faithful Companions of Jesus (FCJ) foundress Marie-Madeleine D’Houet was born in 1781.

The students performed so well and behaved so well in the studio that they were asked to come and record more songs for the soundtrack. Since these students could not miss school to record, the record company sent a few of their music specialists to the ICP studios in Brussels to record our students. These students will be giving up weekends to record the next few songs and I know they … Continue reading St. John’s recording artists!\n\nThe St. John’s art gallery\n\nThe St. John’s International School Art Gallery, has an important role to play in raising awareness of the visual arts and encouraging cultural diplomacy between the international and local Belgian communities both in its extensive programme of exhibitions and workshops by visiting artists and its many students shows in elementary, middle and high school.

Despite initial uncertainties with the rain, the students climbed the 226 steps to the top of the monument. After a very long trek, they got a bird’s-eye view of the infamous battle grounds of Waterloo. “Climbing the steps was easy.

The students have learned a lot about the events leading up to and following the battle which took place on June … Continue reading St. John’s second graders tour Waterloo battlefields\n\nSecond place for students in ECB High School Challenge!\n\nSt. John’s International School came in second place at the first ever Generation Euro Students Award held by and at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt yesterday!

Dana quoted … Continue reading The Rachel’s Challenge Organisation visits Middle School\n\nMessage in a Bottle has been placed into the Sea of Success!\n\nIB Visual Art Show and Auction on Friday the 27th of April wowed the visitors and showed them the skills and uniqueness of each artist. Three words, ‘outstanding,’ ‘interesting,’ ‘unique,’ those three words would be the best ones to describe the work of the IB Visual Art year two students. However, the first question would be, why was it called a message in a bottle? While I was interviewing the teacher, mentor, and person who organized this show, Mr. Alan Mitchell, he told me that “a message in a bottle is a way to communicate to people from different distances, … Continue reading Message in a Bottle has been placed into the Sea of Success!\n\nMessage in a bottle\n\nCome and see the IB Visual Art student’s final exhibition featuring a selection of their work as it has progressed over the two years of their course and take part in the exciting auction of selected works.

He is so clearly oriented … Continue reading High School Art Newsletter March 2012\n\nAre the Arts the Universal Language?\n\nCommunication, according to many experts, is the creation and sharing of meaning. Is there a form of communication that transcends linguistic boundaries and cultural divides?Can art, dance, drama and music speak to all people everywhere? If the Arts are a Universal Language, are they capable of uniting all of us? The arts can be used to develop intercultural relationships, inspire creativity and influence how people “see things” and open them up to new possibilities. Just as the painter gazes at the blank canvas, and the actor steps onto the darkened stage, and the musician is surrounded by the silence that … Continue reading Are the Arts the Universal Language?\n\nLions End Winter Season On A High Note\n\nSt. John’s hosted the 2012 ISST Girls Division 1 Basketball Championship this past week, March 8-10.

From philosophers to politicians to rock stars and religious folks, a longing for peace is expressed in a variety of ways and through a variety of mediums. It is a daunting subject for adults resulting into discussions and even arguments over the role of politics, the cause and results of warfare, the rights and wrongs of countries and more. But for young children, the topic is limited in scope. It involves every day conflicts with their peers in the school yard, the classroom, and the cafeteria – all part of the … Continue reading Little Peacemakers\n\nWhy students should come to St. John’s\n\nLearning life lessons through sports\n\nby Robert Fronk, grade 9 and 10 counselor As I reflect back many years ago regarding my participation in sports, I can’t help but think about the support and encouragement I received. From my parents to my coaches and others as well. Additionally, I think about the thousands of hours I put into sports. This ranged from summer camps attended at a young age, to summer leagues and camps during the high school years. The days and nights of shooting baskets in the rain all by myself, all in the hopes of obtaining my dream. I appreciate the phrases, “the … Continue reading Learning life lessons through sports\n\nR.I.P.\n\nWe received the sad news that Mary McGowan, long-time purchasing officer here at St. John’s, passed away on January 19, 2012. Mary was born in 1945, in Dublin, Ireland. She came to St. John’s in 1989 and stayed with us till her retirement in the summer of 2010. We all knew Mary as a person who lived intensely, had a tremendous sense of humour, and a big heart. Not only was she dedicated to her work but she was a person many turned to for advice, for help, or for a laugh. Mary volunteered at numerous school events, helped in … Continue reading R.I.P.\n\nBig Ideas Week on water\n\nWe are getting towards the end of the second Big Ideas Week to be held here at St. John’s.

There is no life without water.” So said the Hungarian biochemist Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1937. Our students will have opportunities to explore water from angles not examined before. Why do we sell water in bottles? Is access to water a human right? Why bother to save water when it rains all the time? Why do holiday destinations often include access to water? Why worry about pollution in water? Why worry about droughts and floods when it never happens where we are? How do we … Continue reading Big Ideas week 2 in Middle School next week\n\nHappy 2012!\n\nIt’s great to be back after a winter holiday break.

The gallery is a beautiful space for exhibitions because of large windows, open spaces, good lighting and white walls. It was great to see my work in this surrounding.

With the retirement from the Advisory Board of Mr. Christian Varin and Mr. Andrew Renshaw after many years of service, the Advisory Board was looking to fill the vacation positions with people that have specific expertise and background relevant to our school. The aim was to bring in one new Board member with extensive educational expertise and another with legal experience and background. In addition, the Faithful Companions of Jesus (FCJ) have … Continue reading Appointment of three new Advisory Board members\n\nWhy the arts?\n\nWe believe that art and design, dance, drama and music are essential components of human life, a doorway to a whole new world of expression. In an international school like St. John’s, with a diverse student body from different cultural backgrounds, the Arts become the language of all students. Most academic classes exercise the left side of the brain and the Arts enable us to have a balance as much of what we do is, in essence, is “right brain” activity. Howard Gardner has been making sound arguments for a broad and balanced curriculum based on the theory of multiple … Continue reading Why the arts?\n\nFrom the New York Times\n\nHow About Better Parents? By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN Published: November 19, 2011 In recent years, we’ve been treated to reams of op-ed articles about how we need better teachers in our public schools and, if only the teachers’ unions would go away, our kids would score like Singapore’s on the big international tests. There’s no question that a great teacher can make a huge difference in a student’s achievement, and we need to recruit, train and reward more such teachers. But here’s what some new studies are also showing: We need better parents. Parents more focused on their children’s education can … Continue reading From the New York Times\n\nAthletics at St. John’s\n\nIt has been an eventful and positive start of the year for the Athletic Department. One highlight of the past three months was the visit of Genazzano FCJ College from Melbourne, Australia. They stopped by the St. John’s campus for a day as part of a three-week tour of Europe. Genazzano is an all-girls school and our teams played games of soccer and volleyball with our fellow FCJ students from Australia. It was wonderful to welcome the girls to St. John’s and to strengthen our FCJ legacy. Another great moment was hosting the Alistair Thorpe Memorial Cross Country Meet and … Continue reading Athletics at St. John’s\n\nThe HS parent coffee morning presentations\n\nDear parents, Once again thank you for supporting our High School Coffee on the issue of ‘Parenting Teenagers through a rigorous academic programme”.

This very succinctly sums up why schools, earnest in seeking to improve, choose to participate in self-studies and accrediting projects. It is only in taking the time to look within that we can move forward to becoming better. Self-studies offer schools and educators an opportunity to face the truth or ‘brutal facts’ of the current situation and find a way to make positive changes. During the school year, 2011 – 2012, Saint John’s Elementary School is participating in not one, but two self-studies … Continue reading Life-long learning\n\nEvolution of the Hub\n\nAbout a month ago, we launched our password-protected parent portal, The Hub.

That means that all of our children at St. John’s below 7th grade were born in the Google age and our 12th graders were only four or five when Google was ‘born’ and cannot remember life without Google. The World Wide Web has been with us for a miniscule amount of time in relation to the development of the human race. The industrial revolution lasted for approximately one hundred years and had an amazing impact on the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of the time. Today the internet revolution or knowledge revolution has lasted … Continue reading The Language of the Internet\n\nStudent Leadership\n\nOver the past few weeks since the beginning of school we, in High School, have been building structures for student representation and providing opportunities for student leadership.
