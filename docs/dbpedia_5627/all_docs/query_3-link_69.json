        "text": "Spain or Australia? We are on the cusp of a new season and the riders are in the sun. Very bad news for Chris Hamilton down under ‚Äì Top Story. Another win for Mathieu van der Poel ‚Äì Report and video. All the other cycling news: Tour Down Under up-date. Race news from Het Nieuwsblad and USA Crits. Rider news from Nico Roche, Michael Rogers and Bernhard Eisel. Team news from Lotto Soudal, Israel Start-Up Nation, UAE Team Emirates, Movistar, Team Novo Nordisk and Deceuninck ‚Äì Quick-Step. We finish with a video from the BEAT Cycling Club ‚Äì Goodbye Brexit Britain!\n\nTOP STORY: Chris Hamilton: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just as painful as you think it is!‚Äù\n\nChris Hamilton has undoubtedly imagined a better start to the new cycling year. The Team Sunweb rider sustained a ruptured testicular in an innocent fall during a training ride.\n\nHamilton‚Äôs fall dates back to two weeks ago, he writes on his social media. ‚ÄúI wish I could say that I was doing something dangerous, but no, it only happened on a bike path,‚Äù says the Australian. ‚ÄúNo fractures but because people are going to ask what I have done, I have torn a testicle. Indeed guys, it‚Äôs just as painful as you think it is.‚Äù\n\nThe unfortunate Hamilton cannot yet say how much time his recovery will take. ‚ÄúAll I can say is that the operation to make a number of repairs went well and I will find out more about it next week.‚Äù Hamilton didn‚Äôt ride the Australian championships.\n\nChris Hamilton on Instagram:\n\n‚ÄúAlmost 2 weeks ago, I had a small crash in training. I wish I could say I was doing something gnarly, but no, just on a bike path. Nothing broken but since someone is going to ask what I did anyway, I ruptured a testicle. Yep. Fellas it‚Äôs just as painful as you think it is üòÖ. At the moment it‚Äôs a bit unknown how long my recovery will take but at this stage all I can say is the surgery to do some repairs went well and I‚Äôll find out more in a follow up next week. I am pretty devastated to be sidelined for the Aussie summer, but who knows, maybe a change will be for the best! See you all out on the road soon ü§ò‚Äù\n\nHappier times for Hamilton at the TDU‚Äô19:\n\nOtegem Cyclocross 2020\n\nWorld and Dutch champion, Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Fenix) won the Otegem cyclocross on Monday in his usual dominating manner. The World champion started quietly, but once he attacked, he was gone. Van der Poel won his fifth victory in a row in Otegem ahead of Creafin-Fristads teammates; Tim Merlier and Gianni Vermeersch.\n\nThijs Aerts (Telenet Baloise Lions) had a good start, but it was Mathieu van der Poel who first turned onto the off-road ahead of his brother David. After the first lap, the World champion still had a big group in his wheel. New Belgian champion, Laurens Sweeck had a bad start, but was still able to join the front group.\n\nThe youngest Van der Poel changed his tyres early in the race from Grifo‚Äôs to Rhino‚Äôs and many of its competitors also dived into the pits to change bikes. Despite an acceleration from Tim Merlier, nobody really got away in the opening section of the race.\n\nDue to the rainfall, the course became increasingly muddy and heavy. Sweeck put his new Belgian champs jersey on the front after three laps. When Van der Poel accelerated a little later, the lead group split. He put the pressure on and forced the others into making mistakes. Sweeck and Iserbyt (Pauwels Sauzen-Bingoal) clashed, so they eliminated each other. Tim Merlier, Gianni Vermeersch and Wietse Bosmans (SpotIT-Isorex) made up the chase group.\n\nBosmans couldn‚Äôt hang on and so Merlier and Vermeersch were heading for the podium. Toon Aerts fought back just before the end of the battle for the podium, as Vermeersch was unable to follow Merlier‚Äôs pace, two laps before the finish.\n\nAerts and Vermeersch had to keep the speed high in the final lap as a strong Iserbyt was coming back from behind. The Pauwels Sauzen-Bingoal leader was getting close to Aerts and Vermeersch and due to an error by Aerts, Iserbyt finished fourth, a few seconds after Vermeersch. Tim Merlier claimed second place behind the regular win from Mathieu van der Poel.\n\nRace winner, Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Fenix): ‚ÄúI always think this is a super fun cross. The start is a playground, very slippery and technical. We raced expectantly and everything stayed together for a long time. I was waiting for the right moment to go. I quickly tried to make a big difference and then focused on making no more mistakes. We celebrated a little less than in Belgium. I am happy with the title, but no party has been celebrated with us. We ate something with friends. It was a pleasant and relaxing evening. I didn‚Äôt do anything special and was in bed earlier than usual.‚Äù\n\nBelgian national champion Laurens Sweeck was 11th: ‚ÄúDrinking a lot of beer the day before a cross is not a good combination. I now have a stomachache, so that doesn‚Äôt work for me. The legs were good, but I had not had a too fresh a night.‚Äù\n\nOtegem Result:\n\n1. Mathieu van der Poel (Ned) Alpecin-Fenix in 1:00:27\n\n2. Tim Merlier (Bel) Creafin-Fristads at 0:40\n\n3. Gianni Vermeersch (Bel) Creafin-Fristads at 0:51\n\n4. Eli Iserbyt (Bel) Pauwels Sauzen-Bingoal at 0:56\n\n5. Toon Aerts (Bel) Telenet Baloise Lions at 1:10\n\n6. Jim Aernouts (Bel) Telenet Baloise Lions at 1:16\n\n7. Wietse Bosmans (Bel) SpotIT-Isorex at 1:27\n\n8. Thijs Aerts (Bel) Telenet Baloise Lions at 1:50\n\n9. David van der Poel (Ned) Alpecin-Fenix at 1:53\n\n10. Nicolas Cleppe (Bel) Telenet Baloise Lions at 1:54\n\n11. Laurens Sweeck (Bel) Pauwels Sauzen-Bingoal at 2:40.\n\nOtegem‚Äô20:\n\nUAE Team Emirates Kick Off 2020 Season in Australia\n\nThe 2020 UCI WorldTour gets underway with the Tour Down Under in less than a week‚Äôs time. The UAE Team Emirates riders will face just over 900km of racing and more than 12,000km of climbing. Key general classification stages include stage 2 to Stirling, with its uphill finish, an even stiffer uphill finish in Paracombe on stage 3, and then the final finish atop Willunga Hill. Philipsen won stage 5 last year in unique circumstances so could be the man to watch this time around.\n\nSports Director Allan Peiper will lead the following riders:\n\n‚Äì PHILIPSEN Jasper (Belgium)\n\n‚Äì ULISSI Diego (Italy)\n\n‚Äì BJERG Mikkel (Denmark)\n\n‚Äì RIABUSHENKO Aleksandr (Belarus)\n\n‚Äì MARCATO Marco (Italy)\n\n‚Äì LAENGEN Vegard Stake (Norway)\n\n‚Äì BYSTROM Sven Erik (Norway)\n\nAllan Peiper said: ‚ÄúUAE Team Emirates is really looking forward to the start of the season. We come with multiple objectives having Diego Ulissi for the hilly stage finishes and GC and stage winner from last year Jasper Philipsen for the sprint stages. We have a great support team with Bjerg, Bystrom, Laengen, Marcato and Riabushenko.‚Äù\n\nJasper Philipsen said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking forward to starting the season early in Australia. We started really well there last year with a win, so we will be hoping to build on that this year. It‚Äôs always nice to get the season going well and off on the right foot.‚Äù\n\nPatrick Bevin Ruled Out of Santos Tour Down Under\n\nPatrick Bevin will miss the Santos Tour Down Under after undergoing treatment for an episode of cardiac arrhythmia.\n\nBevin experienced an irregular heartbeat during training with an electrocardiogram (ECG) later confirming supraventricular arrhythmia, which has since been treated.\n\n‚ÄúPatrick Bevin was admitted to the Calvary Wakefield Hospital in Adelaide after noticing some irregularities in his heartbeat during training. Patrick does not have a history of heart problems however, an electrocardiogram detected an episode of supraventricular arrhythmia. Fortunately, this is a non-life threatening condition and is quite common, but it did require immediate treatment to regulate the heart rhythm,‚Äù CCC Team Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Testa explained. ‚ÄúThankfully, Patrick experienced this episode whilst with the team and we were able to treat the arrhythmia immediately. We will continue to monitor his recovery and run further tests as a precaution however, as we are less than a week out from the race, Patrick will not be in a position to line up at the Santos Tour Down Under. Patrick will return to New Zealand, where we are confident he will make a full recovery and will be able to resume his racing program shortly.‚Äù\n\nPatrick Bevin is understandably disappointed not to return to the Santos Tour Down Under, the first goal of his season, after winning a stage and leading the race in 2019. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs disappointing to miss the race after preparing all off season for it and especially after coming so close to the win last year. I was looking forward to returning and trying to repeat my success however, it‚Äôs definitely a case of being safe than sorry and the timing has made it impossible to race here in Adelaide,‚Äù Bevin said. ‚ÄúI feel completely fine now and it‚Äôs now just a matter of rest and recovery to ensure it doesn‚Äôt happen again. With the solid block of off season training in my legs, I‚Äôm confident I can still have a strong start to the season one month later than planned.‚Äù\n\nGuillaume Van Keirsbulck is en route to Adelaide to replace Bevin in the team‚Äôs roster. ‚ÄúObviously, this is an unexpected change to my program but I am looking forward to starting my 2020 season in Australia. I‚Äôve raced the Santos Tour Down Under once before in 2016 and really enjoyed the racing and the atmosphere,‚Äù Van Keirsbulck added.\n\nSantos Tour Down Under (21-26 January)\n\nRider roster:\n\nJosef ƒåern√Ω (CZE), Simon Geschke (GER), Joey Rosskopf (USA), Szymon Sajnok (POL), Guillaume Van Keirsbulck (BEL), Francisco Ventoso (ESP) ≈Åukasz Wi≈õniowski (POL).\n\nPEZ spoke to Patrick in December:\n\nLineup: Tour Down Under\n\nWe are thrilled to announce our line-up for the Santos Tour Down Under, the opening WorldTour race of the 2020 season, that features and exciting blend of youth and experience.\n\nIt sees a debut at this level for two of our new riders in the form of the under 23 World Champion Samuele Battistella, who steps up from our Continental team, and Australia‚Äôs Dylan Sunderland. Both will be looking to the race in a supporting role along with gaining invaluable experience in the process.\n\nNorwegian Rasmus Tiller, who had a strong debut season in 2019, as well as top South African Stefan de Bod will slot in alongside the experienced head of Danilo Wyss in the 6-stage race.\n\nOur sprint hopes will rest upon the shoulders of Italian Giacomo Nizzolo and South Africa‚Äôs Ryan Gibbons. The former scored two top-10 stage finishes during his last outing Down Under in 2016 while for the latter, it‚Äôs a race that he excelled at in 2018 taking two top-10 stage finishes as well as a very impressive finish at Wilunga Hill, that saw him finish 11th on the GC.\n\nLars Michaelsen ‚Äì Head Sports Director: ‚ÄúWe are excited to start the 2020 season and showing our new NTT Pro Cycling jersey in race action. We have been preparing well and will confront the Tour Down Under with eagerness but like every year it‚Äôs with an unknown factor of where we actually are compared to our opponents. The total of six stages will normally see four sprint finishes and here we will support our two fast riders Ryan Gibbons and Giacomo Nizzolo. For the two uphill finishes in Paracombe and on Willunga Hill we will know after the first 2 stages who of our NTT riders has the legs to support them.‚Äù\n\nRyan Gibbons: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thoroughly looking forward to kicking off the season here in Australia. After a promising performance last year and another season of experience I‚Äôm excited to see what we can achieve in 2020. The team is highly motivated and want to take every opportunity we can, I‚Äôm confident it will be a promising start to 2020 for NTT Pro Cycling.‚Äù\n\nSantos Women‚Äôs Tour Down Under\n\nNicolas Marche ‚Äì Team Sunweb coach: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre excited to get our season underway at the Women‚Äôs Tour Down Under; it is the first time that we will have raced here so we are all looking forward to it. Before travelling to Australia we gathered at the Keep Challenging Centre for some training in a climate control room to adapt to the heat we will face during the race, so we‚Äôre prepared for the conditions as best as possible. The four stages offer opportunities for the sprinters and puncheurs, with stage three the toughest and the one that is expected to decide GC. We want to bring Leah, Liane and Juliette as fresh as possible into the finale of each stage so that we have multiple cards to play in the unpredictable stage finishes. Julia will be road captain and we‚Äôll also see British duo Pfeiffer and Anna start, with Anna making her debut for us.‚Äù\n\nLine-up:\n\nPfeiffer Georgi (GBR), Anna Henderson (GBR), Leah Kirchmann (CAN), Juliette Labous (FRA), Liane Lippert (GER), Julia Soek (NED).\n\nSchwalbe Classic\n\nLuke Roberts ‚Äì Team Sunweb coach: ‚ÄúOur season kicks off Down Under with the Schwalbe Classic, which is a very fast and flat criterium in the city centre of Adelaide before the Tour Down Under itself gets underway two days later. The race normally ends in a sprint and it is expected to do so again this year so it will offer us a good chance for our new Italian sprinter Alberto, who makes his debut, to chase a good result with support from the rest of the team.‚Äù\n\nLine-up:\n\nAsbj√∏rn Kragh Andersen (DEN), Alberto Dainese (ITA), Jai Hindley (AUS), Max Kanter (GER), Robert Power (AUS), Michael Storer (AUS), Florian Stork (GER).\n\nSantos Tour Down Under\n\nLuke Roberts ‚Äì Team Sunweb coach: ‚ÄúThe Tour Down Under has a good mix of opportunities for the sprinters, with the traditional Willunga Hill stage and the return of the finish in Paracombe the two stand-out GC days. We bring a young and diverse team to the race and look to take our chances throughout the race. With Chris [Hamilton] sidelined due to injury Jai, Robert and Michael will be our climbers that will be up there on the tougher stages where we hope to get a good GC result, particularly with Jai who is in good shape. In the flatter sprint stages there are a couple of good chances for Alberto but there are also some more difficult sprints which could suit Max‚Äôs abilities, with Asbj√∏rn and Florian assisting them in the lead outs.‚Äù\n\nLine-up:\n\nAsbj√∏rn Kragh Andersen (DEN), Alberto Dainese (ITA), Jai Hindley (AUS), Max Kanter (GER), Robert Power (AUS), Michael Storer (AUS), Florian Stork (GER).\n\nHindley Down Under:\n\nAG2R-La Mondiale in Australia\n\nRomain Bardet: ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken part in a race since July 28th when the Tour de France finished on the Champs Elys√©es. So I am particularly impatient to pin on the new bib number that will launch me into the 2020 season. I have been preparing for many months for this, and have mixed it up a bit by riding track and doing some cyclocross, which has helped in getting me out of my traditional winter pattern. I have been in Australia since December 28th with Cl√©ment Chevrier, Axel Domont and Larry Warbasse, where we have been able to acclimatise to the summer conditions and even heat waves. I‚Äôm happy to discover the Santos Tour Down Under which is a popular event that is eagerly awaited here despite the environmental disaster that is affecting Australia today. We‚Äôve seen some of the devastation in various places around Adelaide. I hope that the race will be an additional lever in the solidarity movement emerging all around the globe to help the regions stricken by fire. On the sporting side, I have never before returned to racing so early in the year, but I think that these are the ideal conditions for a calm start to a great 2020 season, progressing day by day on short but hilly stages.‚Äù\n\nAndrea Vendrame will race his first event with AG2R-La Mondiale Cycling Team. The other 2020 recruits for the team are Lawrence Naesen, Harry Tanfield, Cl√©ment Champoussin, a member of the Chamb√©ry Cyclisme Formation will join the professionals with AG2R-La Mondiale on April 1st.\n\nTour of Catalonia 2020 Route\n\nWe still have to wait for the stage profiles, but the organisation of the 2020 Volta a Catalunya has revealed all the stage places. In addition to the previously announced individual time trial, the 100th edition includes finishes in Vallter 2000 and Port Ain√© ski resorts.\n\nAt the end of December the organisers of the Catalan stage race announced that the hundredth edition would have a longer individual time trial for the first time since 2007. Rabobank rider, Denis Menchov, won the 17-kilometre time trial from Sornas to Vallnord-Arcal√≠s. On the second stage of this year‚Äôs race, an individual time trial will be ridden over 21.1 kilometres around Banyoles, capital of the comarca Pla de l‚ÄôEstany.\n\nThe opening stage starts and finishes in the seaside resort of Calella. Stage three starts at the Canal Ol√≠mpic de Catalunya in Castelldefels, where the canoe competitions were held during the 1992 Summer Games. From there, the peloton will head to the Vallter 2000 ski resort, where Thomas De Gendt and Adam Yates have won over the past two years. The next day there is more climbing to the stage finish in Port Ain√©.\n\nStages 5 and 6 finish in Manresa and the coastal town of Matar√≥. Stage 7 is the traditional final stage in Barcelona on the climb of Montjuic. More details of the route will be announced on 6 February.\n\nVolta a Catalunya 2020 (23-29 March):\n\nStage 1: Calella ‚Äì Calella\n\nStage 2: Pla de l‚ÄôEstany (Banyoles-Banyoles) ITT\n\nStage 3: Canal Ol√≠mpic de Catalunya ‚Äì Vallter 2000/Setcases (Vall de Camprodon)\n\nStage 4: Ripoll ‚Äì Port Ain√© (Pallars Sobir√†)\n\nStage 5: La Pobla de Segur ‚Äì Manresa\n\nStage 6: Tarragona ‚Äì Matar√≥\n\nStage 7: Barcelona ‚Äì Barcelona.\n\nVolta a Catalunya 2019 full race recap by NBC Sports:\n\nOmloop Het Nieuwsblad 2020 Course\n\nThe 2020 Omloop Het Nieuwsblad will have thirteen climbs, just like last year. The opening Classic of the season will also start at the velodroom ‚Äôt Kuipke in Gent, while the finish is in Ninove.\n\nThe route of the Omloop covers 200 kilometres and includes thirteen climbs and cobblestone sections. It all starts with the Leberg (three times), then Den Ast, followed by the Valkenberg, Wolvenberg and Molenberg. The race will probably be decided on the cobblestones of the Muur van Geraardsbergen and the Bosberg, the iconic duo were restored to the Omloop Het Nieuwsblad in 2018 by the organisation. The finish line is on the Educationlaan in the centre of Ninove, after a flat final ten kilometres.\n\nThe 75th edition of Omloop Het Nieuwsblad will be held on Saturday 29 February.

Making the sport of criterium racing more watchable, and as part of that, more of a team based sport. In 2019, there was a 15% increase in D1 team participation at the eleven races that make up the nationwide season. For 2020, the most teams ever have committed and all Series races will be streaming for free on USACRITS.tv.\n\nD1 is the nomenclature used by USA CRITS to identify Series teams. Teams agree to promote and race the Series and in return USA CRITS provides benefits to the teams. The largest of these benefits being the ability to race on a live stream production and in front of the largest crowds in American cycling. The top four finishers in each race qualify for season team points and individuals earn the same points in the three season long jersey competitions.\n\n2019 Series team champions ButcherBox Cycling (men) and Colavita/Cavaliere d‚ÄôOro Women‚Äôs Pro Cycling (women) will return to defend their 2019 team titles. They will be joined by nine new teams and four teams racing both male and female squads bringing a new dynamic for fans to engage. The 2020 race calendar has been shared with teams and will be announced to the public on January 23rd. The Series will once again begin with the Hammerfest pre-season event in Birmingham, Alabama, on March 14th.\n\n‚ÄúSeeing new teams develop with the sole purpose of racing the Series and existing teams gaining new sponsors because they are getting exposure from our broadcasts is exciting. The creation of season long team and rider storylines is what the sport needs. We are making progress toward our goals,‚Äù said Scott Morris, USA CRITS Development Director.\n\n2020 USA CRITS D1 Teams:\n\nRoche Talks 2019 and Looks to 2020\n\nNicolas Roche is preparing for his sixteenth season with the pros in Calpe, Spain. The 35-year-old Irishman has won stages in the Vuelta a Espa√±a in the past, but dreams of even more success in the Grand Tours. ‚ÄúI still hope to win a Tour stage‚Äù, he told TuttoBiciWeb.\n\nThe Sunweb rider has been at the start of the most important cycling race of the year nine times, but is still looking for his first stage victory. ‚ÄúI want to win another stage in a Grand Tour in the future, especially in the Tour. A Tour ride is still missing on my palmar√®s.‚Äù The former rider of more than a few teams, including AG2R-La Mondiale, Tinkoff and BMC wore the red leader‚Äôs jersey in the Vuelta, although he had to give up after a serious crash.\n\n‚ÄúI can‚Äôt complain about the last season, since I managed to perform the whole year. The highlight of course followed in the Vuelta, although unfortunately I also had to give up early after a major crash. But that is part of cycling.‚Äù The experienced Roche will again combine the Tour and Vuelta in 2020.\n\n‚ÄúThis season I will be employed by my younger teammates, but in the Vuelta I will get the freedom to do my thing again. I hope to ride a good overall classification in Spain.‚Äù Roche will start his season at the Tour du Haut Var.\n\nRoche leading la Vuelta‚Äô19:\n\nRiis Brings in Michael Rogers as Time Trial Coach\n\nNew team boss at NTT Pro Cycling, Bjarne Riis has added Michael Rogers in his team staff. The 40-year-old ex-pro will be involved with the South African formation as their time trial specialist.\n\nRogers, who in the past has raced for Quick-Step, HTC, Sky and Tinkoff, was World time trial champion three times during his career. The Australian won the rainbow jersey in Hamilton (2003), Verona (2004) and Madrid (2005). Rogers was also seen as a promising GC rider, but in the end he never managed to win a Grand Tour.\n\nRogers was forced to retire from competitive cycling in 2016 due to a heart problem. Four years later he is now back in cycling with NTT. ‚ÄúHe will be given the task of improving the time trial equipment for every rider, but he will also be in charge of the time trial races,‚Äù says Riis to Ekstra Bladet.\n\n‚ÄúWe need to improve as a team as much as possible and Michael can really do his bit.‚Äù Rogers and Riis were previously together in the Tinkoff team and the Danish company Virtu Cycling.\n\nMichael Rogers with Tinkoff:\n\nBernhard Eisel Retires\n\nAfter nineteen years as a professional cyclist, Bernhard Eisel has had to hang up his bike. The Austrian could not find a new team and announced his retirement on Wednesday. He will remain active in cycling he said via social media.\n\n‚ÄúIt was an absolute privilege to be allowed to ride for the biggest teams and to compete in the biggest races. I have made friends for life and have traveled all over the world, but now it is time to take the next step in my journey,‚Äù, Eisel explained.\n\n‚ÄúCycling is a great sport, but it also has a dangerous side,‚Äù said the winner of Gent-Wevelgem in 2010. ‚ÄúIn 2018 I had an injury that could very well have meant the end of my career. I am happy that I have been able to race another season, which means that I leave the sport with pride and content. What I am perhaps most proud of is that I have raced in Paris-Roubaix 16 times.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI am grateful to teammates, staff members, race officials, organisers, media representatives and the fans. I also want to thank my family for all the sacrifices they have made and the love that you have always given me. I hope I have made you proud. Finally, I am happy to say that I will not leave the sport,‚Äù concluded the cycling veteran.\n\nIn 2001 Eisel made his professional debut on with Mapei ‚Äì Quick-Step. This was followed with contracts with Fran√ßaise des Jeux (2003-2006), T-Mobile and HTC (2007-2011), Sky (2012-2015) and Dimension Data (2016-2019). The Austria‚Äôs honours list includes five stage victories in the Tour of the Algarve, two stage victories in the Tour of Switzerland and one in the Three Days of De Panne. He also won Paris-Bourges. The 2010 Gent-Wevelgem is the biggest win on his palmar√®s.\n\nMark Cavendish Tweeted: ‚ÄúGenuinely cried reading this. Closer than teammates, closer than friends, we‚Äôre brothers. I could never win an argument with you, but I could never win anywhere near the races I have without you. Thank you for all you‚Äôve done for me, the peloton and cycling. Love you mate.‚Äù\n\nBernhard Eisel:\n\nNo Alcohol for Lotto Soudal\n\nAn alcohol ban applies to Lotto Soudal from this season. When riders and staff members of the Belgian WorldTour team are at a training camp or a race, they are not allowed to consume alcoholic beverages.\n\n‚ÄúAt special events such as a victory, a birthday or a reception, a glass of champagne can of course be added. During a race it is up to the DS to judge when there is a special event,‚Äù team manager John Lelangue told Het Nieuwsblad.\n\nAccording to Lelangue, the incident with Kevin De Weert during last year‚Äôs Vuelta has nothing to do with the new rule. ‚ÄúWe already had a code of conduct. I have now adjusted it a bit for safety reasons. Almost every staff member has to drive a car at certain times of the day. Then it seems better to ban alcohol.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúEvery staff member wears clothing from the team with our sponsors names during the races. We are all Lotto-Soudal ambassadors,‚Äù Lelangue continued. ‚ÄúThe punishment is also black and white in the code of conduct, which everyone signed, but remains internal.‚Äù\n\nLotto Soudal boss John Lelangue:\n\nIsrael Start-Up Nation to Cooperate with Formula 1 Team Williams\n\nIsrael Start-Up Nation will work with the British Formula 1 team Williams.

Another cycling team is joining forces with a Formula 1 team after McLaren (Bahrain-McLaren) and Mercedes (Team Ineos).\n\nWilliams is an illustrious name in motor racing and one of the most successful teams ever in Formula 1. The team achieved its greatest successes in the 1980s and 1990s with drivers Alan Jones, Nigel Mansell, Damon Hill and Jacques Villeneuve.\n\nIsrael Start-Up Nation to work with Formula 1 team Williams:\n\nUAE Team Emirates Teams up with Enervit from 2020 Team Inks Three Year Deal\n\nUAE Team Emirates is pleased to announce a new three year deal with Enervit who from 2020 will become the team‚Äôs official nutrition supplier.\n\nBy joining forces with Enervit, UAE Team Emirates will benefit from 40 years‚Äô experience in sports nutrition with one of the main European players in the sector of sporting supplements.\n\nUAE Team Emirates now joins the list of top level sporting teams and federations to partner up with the historical nutrition brand.\n\nPaolo Calabresi, Enervit Marketing Director Sport&Fitness, says: ‚ÄúWe are proud to support such a high-profile team and to offer these athletes all the expertise we have gained working alongside great champions.

The C64 features carbon fiber tubes and lugs glued together, which are made entirely by hand in Cambiago, Italy. The Concept, V2r and V3r frames push the boundaries of aerodynamics. The Concept was designed in a wind tunnel and is suitable for racing on flat terrains, fast, and sprints. The V2r is a compromise between lightweight and aerodynamic that makes it ideal for climbing thanks to its versatility. The V3r is the newest edition with improved lightness and aerodynamics that provides a stiffer and more comfortable ride.\n\nFor the first time in its eight-year history, Team Novo Nordisk will race on disc brakes. Industry-leading cycle component manufacturer Shimano‚Äôs disc brakes dominate the global market thanks to their superior modulation, heat management, and all-weather stopping power.

This as well as embarking on an ambitious round of cultural and behavioural changes, aimed at limiting their environmental impact on the planet.\n\nThe end of the 2010s saw a tidal change in way that we view our environment and the impact that our everyday lives have on it. A globalised world has opened new horizons, building opportunities to explore and collaborate in ways unimaginable until recent times. But in recent years it has become obvious that out habits, along with the building of a throwaway culture, has started to take a toll on the planet.\n\nSport has played a huge part in this, encouraging athletes and fans to travel vast distances to explore opportunities in new lands. In order to be aware of our contribution and climate impact Deceuninck ‚Äì Quick-Step have calculated their carbon footprint to be 1288 tons of CO2, which is the equivalent of driving a car 179 times around the world, or 539 return flights between Brussels and New York. The amount of forestation required to capture this amount of CO2 is the equivalent of around 3099 football pitches.\n\nThe team has pledged to a ‚Äúmanifesto of changes‚Äù that is aimed to reduce its environmental impact, make positive changes that can help reduce its wastage and help to educate riders, staff, partners, and supporters on the subject, with the hope of evolving habits. The pledges are:\n\n‚Ä¢ Reducing the usage of plastic in the next two years and increasing recycling\n\n‚Ä¢ Creating consciousness and networking among the team‚Äôs partners / suppliers\n\n‚Ä¢ Promoting selling of recycled product through the team‚Äôs digital platform\n\n‚Ä¢ Encouraging fans and partner staff to travel more via bicycle\n\n‚Ä¢ Reducing the energy consumption at the headquarters\n\n‚Ä¢ Dividing and recycling the waste and using biodegradable products as much as possible\n\n‚Ä¢ Promoting the culture of recycling and reduce littering\n\n‚Ä¢ Educating riders and staff to respect the environment\n\n‚Ä¢ Offset our remaining CO2 emissions by supporting certified climate projects\n\nDeceuninck ‚Äì Quick-Step are quick to recognise their part in the current situation, with their Marketing & Communication Manager Alessandro Tegner saying: ‚ÄúRecently there have been almost daily stories in the news speaking about our environment and how it is evolving. Compared to many other sports, cycling has a unique relationship with the environment in that it is our stadium and like any stadium it needs to be cared for and looked after. As a team we travel thousands of miles every year and expand a large amount of energy, so we have to take our share of the responsibility. We see this as a long-term process of educating and changing habits and it is not about just one thing. Like everything we do as a team, we want this to be about everybody getting involved; the riders, staff, sponsors, supporters and those around us at races and events. It will not happen overnight, but if we all do our little bit, but the benefits will be long lasting. We are also delighted that our partners supported since the first moment our initiative with ideas and comments that will become part of the project in the next future.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe are very pleased with the Deceuninck-Quickstep climate engagement and collaboration. This will set an example for all sports. Cycling is a beautiful and originally low-carbon sport that brings people around the world together. Unfortunately, due to the travelling requirements CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere. Together we will keep calculating and reducing the teams climate impact through daily actions and by supporting certified climate projects‚Äù, said Antoine Geerinckx, Founder and Manager of CO2logic.\n\n#itsstartswithus will see Deceuninck ‚Äì Quick-Step tackle their environmental impact on several fronts, headlined by two large carbon offset schemes. The first is a project to provide and install a safe water supply to the Kaliro District in Uganda. As well as the humanitarian benefits to installing the supply, there are serval environmental benefits, especially when it comes to tackling and reversing deforestation in the area. A readily available supply of safe water through boreholes also negates the need to have water delivered, and thus vastly reducing the reliance on heavy goods vehicles or the burning of wood to boil the water, therefore avoiding deforestation and reducing CO2 emissions.\n\nThe second offset scheme, in cooperation with CO2logic, takes place in a location that is very close to the heart of cycling fans ‚Äì the region around the iconic Mont Ventoux. The Deceuninck ‚Äì Quick-Step #itstartswithus campaign will partner a project developed by Centre R√©gional de la Propri√©t√© Foresti√®re, which is implementing a number of conservation and reforestation projects in the area. The area is progressively known to be a habitat for wolves, an animal synonymous with the team, with the increased forest area giving them a larger area in which to roam.\n\nAbout CO2logic\n\nCO2logic is an independent consultancy office specialized in calculating, reducing, and offsetting CO2 emissions. CO2logic also supports and develops climate projects in developing countries (Burkina Faso, Benin, Uganda, DRC, etc.) in partnership with local NGOs in order to offset the incompressible carbon footprint of its clients and partners. The CO2 Neutral label (validated by Vin√ßotte) ensures that organisations also take responsibility for their remaining emissions and climate impact.\n\nwww.co2logic.com\n\nBurning Brexit with BEAT Cycling Club\n\nA final farewell to Great Britain from the Dutch team.\n\nThe PEZ INSTAGRAM Take a look at our Instagram page for a live feed and giveaways straight from your phone: https://www.instagram.com/pezcyclingnews\n\n*****\n\nThe PEZ NEWSWIRE!\n\nDon‚Äôt forget to check the ‚ÄúNEWSWIRE‚Äù section, you can find it on the homepage, just above the EuroTrash section.
