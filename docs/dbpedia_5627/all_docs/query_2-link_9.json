(private collection)\n\nExpressing Grief and Gratitude in an Unsettled Time\n\nTemporary First World War Memorials in Belgium\n\nLeen Engelen & Marjan Sterckx\n\nIntroduction: Temporary Monuments and the Great War\n\nThere will be, there would be, if one is not careful, something atrocious: memorials! Let’s denounce this peril. Certainly, let’s write the names of the martyrs in bronze and marble on the threshold of our village halls; let’s plant commemorative trees […]; let’s erect in some larger cities the column or temple that eternalises the painful image of this grand era. But, let’s be wary of cheap memorials of poor quality, a threat that is surrounding us on all sides. […] Can you see that? […] on all the squares, a Lady Belgium in bronze by a local artist […] To make things worse, no doubt every Lady Belgium will be accompanied by a lion, that formidable Belgian lion.1\n\nThis warning against a deluge of average-quality war memorials was published in the Belgian satirical magazine Pourquoi Pas? as early as December 1918. In his bantering critique, the author was referring to the thousands of memorials that had been erected in French villages after the Franco-Prussian war. Alas, his warning fell on deaf ears. As of November 1918, and continuing well into the 1920s and 1930s, a large number of monuments commemorating the Great War were erected throughout France and Belgium. Although the act of commemorating conflict through monuments indeed long predated the Great War, no previous war had instigated the creation of such a large number of memorials.2 In formerly occupied territories such as the majority of Belgium and Northern France, the need to express grief as well as gratitude had been actively suppressed by the occupational regime for over four years. The occupation army’s departure triggered a rapid and intense surfacing of the need to create monuments. Instantaneously and enthusiastically, ideas began to surface on both the national and local levels and many of these initiatives involved active and intense public participation. Plans were forged by formal as well as informal local associations such as parishes, professional guilds, schools, (sports) clubs and neighbourhood associations. Occasionally, independent initiatives were taken by bereaved families or individual artists. Only a minority of these intentions actually materialised and many took a long time to develop.3\n\nThis essay looks into a phenomenon which slightly predates the large-scale post-war “statue mania” that flooded municipal squares and parish grounds starting in the early 1920s. We will explore the emergence of temporary public memorials in Belgium during and immediately after the First World War, assessing how they developed and established a commemoration trajectory which lasted for decades. Although ephemeral monuments were an international phenomenon characterised by a great diversity, they took on a specific form in (previously) occupied territories such as Belgium, both during and after the war. These monuments – made of temporary materials such as greenery, wood, earth and plaster – were created with the intention of alleviating the urgent (and sometimes long repressed) need for a place of remembrance, a lieu de mémoire. They emerged from a deeply felt and shared desire to mourn, remember and commemorate singled-out (groups of) people, specific war-related events or causes. They emerged from below in the absence of official permanent monuments – which usually came about via top-down procedures – and were often conceived to structure collective commemorations and commemorative practices according to familiar, ritualised patterns. In his essay on “The Living”, John Horne describes people’s coming to terms with death in wartime as a process which takes place in three concentric circles: the innermost circle is the private loss of a loved-one, the second circle is the formation of temporary mourning communities (small-scale to nationwide) and, finally, the third circle – public commemoration – gives mourning an enduring public form. In general, the early temporary monuments are firmly rooted in the innermost circle. They develop within small mourning communities and sometimes – if their replacement by a permanent structure is envisaged – they are the harbinger of enduring commemoration.4 As such, they play their part in private, collective as well as public processes of mourning and healing. Through involvement people gained the opportunity to do more than just visit the monuments and leave flowers and wreaths: in what were often grassroots initiatives, they could also participate in their conceptualisation and collaborate in their creation. At the same time, hierarchical committees (such as parish groups or comités de patronage) often played some part in their realisation. These memorials often were conceived and constructed in a short time. Therefore, they mostly by-passed the generally cumbersome official procedures for erecting public monuments and were able to disregard conflicting agendas of official bodies as well as aesthetic discussions. It was often hoped that before these ephemeral monuments deteriorated, regular top-down procedures would lead to their replacement with permanent structures in stone or bronze. In a way, the ephemeral character of the monuments created a kind of a space “in between”: their presence eased an immediate need and thereby gave communities and authorities time to think about durable monuments and future commemorative practices. When in the early 1920s an increasing number of permanent memorials were built, their temporary predecessors quickly began to disappear.\n\nIn order to contextualise the emergence and meaning of ephemeral First World War memorials in Belgium, we will shed light on the different historic and international manifestations of this phenomenon before, during and after the First World War. First, we will show that in the context of the Great War temporary memorials were an international phenomenon that manifested itself in many different forms depending on the place where they emerged and those involved in their conception. Next, we will show that these temporary monuments took a specific shape in occupied areas such as Belgium, both during and after the war. In our discussion we will pay attention to the variable temporalities of different types of temporary monuments and to the changing roles played by the various stakeholders (the public, the authorities, the artists).\n\nWartime Temporary Memorials: An International Phenomenon\n\nThe specific nature of the Great War partly accounts for the popularity of temporary monuments in the countries directly involved in the conflict. For the first time, a total war was being fought and the consequences of war were forced home on civilians. The massive involvement of citizens revealed that the general population had a pressing urge to commemorate or celebrate specific and often local events or to come together to publicly express and share grief. These needs had already begun to arise during the conflict. Although the circumstances differed depending on the country or region, the erection of ad hoc, co-created, do-it-yourself memorials, such as flower shrines or modest wooden columns or crosses, was an international phenomenon that manifested itself in many different forms. Some early British instances are well documented. As early as October 1914, for example, the London fire brigade proposed to honour its fellow firemen who fell in the first weeks of the war (five by then) by erecting a temporary memorial at the brigade’s headquarters. The memorial was erected as an immediate, emotional response to the loss this local community of firemen was confronted with and became a tangible symbol for their grief.5 In 1916, likewise in London, inhabitants of a working-class neighbourhood in the East End marked the voluntary enlistment of 65 of their boys and men with a street shrine. Their example was followed by several other neighbourhoods in the area and led to what came to be called the “war shrine movement”.6 As the movement caught on, institutional (funding) bodies such as parishes and local governments quickly became involved and a standard design was proposed. By the end of October 1916, more than 250 shrines had been erected or were planned and many more would follow.7 Evidently, public wartime shrines such as these British examples were rare to non-existent in occupied or frontline areas. In Britain, these early initiatives often already carried within them the intention for a later permanent memorial. In August 1916, the British parish of Dorking for example erected “a handsome oak cross with a figure of bronze representing Christ crucified” along with the roll of honour of the parish. Immediately, it was made clear that this was “only intended to be a temporary memorial, to suffice until the end of the war, when, doubtless the town will desire something of a more enduring character shall take its place”, as indeed many communities envisaged.8 As Mark Connelly argues, the war shrines indeed laid the foundations for later remembrance, but this was by no means a paved way and many hurdles lay ahead.9 A case in point is the Hyde Park memorial shrine: a 24-foot spire with Allied flags around the top placed on a Maltese-cross-shaped base. It was inaugurated on 4 August 1918 and attracted vast audiences.10 Due to its popularity, the shrine remained in situ for over a year and prompted debates on official war memorials. Architect Edwin Lutyens (1869-1944) was asked to design a monument to replace the temporary shrine, but this project never materialised.11\n\nSome temporary memorials inscribed themselves in more vernacular practices. An out of the ordinary example are the snow memorials. These are at once rooted in the popular pastime of snow sculpting and in the artistic tradition of open-air snow and ice sculpture exhibitions, commonly organised during frost fairs. The latter were quite popular in the Low Countries during the Little Ice Age that struck Europe from the fourteenth to the nineteenth century. In some cases, the extremely ephemeral nature of snow sculptures occasioned more daring or even provocative designs or themes.12 This was not the case when, in January 1915, a snow sculpture of the German Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg (1847-1934) – at that time already known in Germany as “the victor of Tannenberg” – was unveiled in Stuttgart. The large bust of Hindenburg in uniform (complete with iron cross) was placed on a massive rectangular plinth and flanked by pine trees (Fig. 1). The structure was approximately three metres high. The almost alabaster or marble white of the snow as well as its transient qualities stood in stark contrast to the serious posture of the bust and the stately elaboration of the plinth in an imitation granite texture. As it was placed in an outdoor ice rink, people skated around the statue, which was guarded by two guards on ice skates. Before it melted, this first memorial to Hindenburg in Germany was documented in articles in the local press, press photos, a Messter Woche newsreel item and picture postcards.13\n\nFig. 2. Georg Marschall, Der Eiserne Hindenburg zu Berlin, erected in 1915 in Berlin. Picture postcard, Oscar Peters Verlag, Darmstadt. (private collection)\n\nThis type of documentation – more long-lasting than the objects themselves – also exists in relation to a so-called Nagelman (nail man) sculpture of the same Hindenburg which was erected in Berlin in the autumn of 1915. In the years that followed, the 13-metre-high wooden structure by German painter and sculptor Georg Marschall (1871-1956) was covered with 14.000 kg of nails (Fig. 2). The Eiserne Hindenburg von Berlin, as the monument came to be known (later “the wooden Titan”),14 was removed and put into storage after the war and reportedly largely used as firewood (except for the head which was placed in the Deutsche Luftfahrtsammlung in Berlin in 1938).15 The nail men are a typical phenomenon that gained popularity during the First World War. The first Nagelmänner emerged in the spring of 1915; by 1918 hundreds of nail figures had been made, mostly in Germany and Austria Hungary. They represented not only military figures, but also symbols such as coats of arms and iron crosses.16 Often these resulted from grassroots initiatives by local communities (for instance schools or charity organisations) raising money for war-related aid organisations. The communities participated either directly in the nailing itself, or indirectly by purchasing or supplying iron silver- or gold-plated nails.17 The ephemerality of these sculptures is complex. On the one hand, the wooden sculpture is made more durable through the application of nails; on the other hand, the massive application of nails eventually destroyed the wooden structure.\n\nTemporary Memorials in Occupied Belgium\n\nAs the examples above demonstrate, temporary memorials were conceived in a remarkable variety of shapes, materials and sizes. In occupied territories like Belgium, monumental or eye-catching memorials, even when temporary, were largely forbidden. One thus had to resort to inconspicuous improvised shrines or memorials.18 We can assume that a lot of ephemeral memorials in this fashion were created in the private or domestic space, to be seen only by the members of a specific family or association: a photograph or postcard on the wall adorned with a candle, a cockade or a flower arrangement… These mostly stayed under the radar. The (censored) press was not likely to report on this phenomenon either, making it even more difficult to grasp. On the (semi)public level, it is noticeable that under the occupation religious celebrations and gatherings often took on patriotic undertones and cemeteries became important loci of remembrance. This was reluctantly tolerated by the occupier.19\n\nFrom early on, local inhabitants, parishes, patriotic associations and occasional groups began to erect improvised funerary steles and temporary monuments in cemeteries. These were likewise covered by the mourners with chrysanthemums and wreaths. A few months after the invasion, for instance, in the cemetery of Kessel-Lo near Louvain a fugitive gravestone-like memorial made from earth, flowers and wood was created to mark the mass grave of the 65 Belgian soldiers20 who died in nearby Kessel-Lo(o) in August and September191421 (Fig. 3). As of December 1914, the grave was managed by the local veteran society (De Bond van Oud-Soldaten van Blauwput-Kessel-Loo) and it is likely that the memorial was created under their auspices. In 1915, they placed an additional temporary wooden cross on the grave, with the inscription “to the memory of our Belgian heroes who died for their country in Kessel-Loo” (“à la mémoire de nos héros belges tombés pour la patrie à Kessel-Loo”). In mid-1915, the group pleaded for a permanent memorial with the city council, but the latter decided it preferred to wait until the end of the war.22\n\nFig. 3. Temporary memorial at the cemetery of Kessel-Lo (Leuven), 1914. (Leuven City Archive)\n\nThe Catholic tradition of laying flowers on the tombs in the local cemetery on All Souls’ and All Saints’ Day (1-2 November) developed into massive commemorations of the fallen during the war. On those days, monuments related to the allies, such as the French monument for the fallen of 1870 (inaugurated in 1880) and the Wellington Memorial (inaugurated 1890), both at the cemetery of the Brussels commune of Evere, became sites of mourning and patriotic manifestations. In a solemn procession, people walked quietly before the monuments, leaving flowers or lighting candles. At the same cemetery, for All Saints’ Day in 1915 a chrysanthemum flower carpet representing the Belgian lion and the initials of the Belgian royals was laid around the graves of the Belgian officers and soldiers who died in Brussels’ hospitals following the invasion. At another Brussels cemetery (Saint-Josse-ten-Noode), a temporary monument (probably in plaster) by an unnamed sculptor (the press mentions only that he was a pupil of the famous Thomas Vinçotte (1850-1925)), representing a Belgian lion holding the Belgian flag in its claws mounted on a stone plinth was erected.23 A year later, in November 1916, a pyramid-shaped wooden memorial was erected at the cemetery of the Brussels district of Ixelles, and a temporary sculptural group embellished the soldiers’ cemetery in the nearby municipality of Etterbeek.24 Participating in these events was not only a religious token, but also an act of patriotic resistance.\n\nMeanwhile, the occupying regime occasionally celebrated its own heroes with temporary monuments on Belgian soil. In December 1915, a bas-relief of the German general Otto von Emmich (1848-1915) – celebrated as responsible for the fall of Liège – was inaugurated in the city’s courthouse. It was executed in the traditional Nagelmänner style and came to be called the “Eiserne Emmich”.25 Von Emmich, who was already gravely ill at the time, died barely a week later. On this occasion, a cast iron bust on a nailed wooden pedestal was erected in Liège as well.26 The Belgian exiled press was not impressed by the (particularly German) nail men tradition. A few days before the inauguration of the “Eiserne Emmich”, a journalist had commented on the “Eiserne Hindenburg” in terms that can hardly be misunderstood: “this crouched Hindenburg, made out of wood, in which the faithful push nails in iron or gold. A ridiculous spectacle for which the boche illustrated magazines made ample and ludicrous publicity”.27\n\nWhat most of these wartime ephemeral sculptures, both in Belgium and abroad, have in common is their co-creation by the local community. While the model of financing public sculptures by subscription was already well-established in the nineteenth century, the tangible and hands-on involvement of the public at large is a feature that came to prominence during the war. The people were involved in both the decision-making process and the actual construction of the memorials and monuments. The nail men – which were literally nailed by the public – are probably the most radical emanation of this trend. But their involvement is also palpable in the snow sculptures, cemetery memorials and street shrines. A second, closely connected feature is their ad hoc nature. These monuments emerge almost unexpectedly and are the result of improvisation. They are built for the most part with non-durable materials that are readily available, such as snow, greenery and derelict wood or metal, and that have been effectively repurposed. As such, they might be considered early examples of “upcycling” and of what design theorists such as Charles Jencks and Nathan Silver, and Joseph Grima call “adhocism” or “adhocracy”, which they describe as the art of doing things ad hoc – tackling problems at once, using materials at hand, rather than waiting for the perfect moment or “proper” approach.28 Such an ad hoc approach questions authorship, standardisation and bureaucracy; and favours collaboration, sharing and bottom-up initiatives.29 This is exactly what also happened in the wartime emanations of ephemeral monuments.\n\nNovember 1918: An Abrupt Series of Temporary Sculptures in Brussels\n\nAs the Armistice and the end of the war approached, the nature of temporary memorials changed. Design was increasingly prioritised, the prospect of eternalising became more prominent, and official bodies became more and more involved.30 The end of the occupation of Belgium in November 1918 was above all a cathartic moment. People were finally able to speak out, give in to ecstatic patriotism, and publicly ventilate anti-German sentiments. At the same time, space was created for mourning and commemoration which was no longer limited to the private inner circle or local community. A feeling was shared by many that places of commemoration were important and necessary. Almost instantly, questions arose about whose efforts should first be eternalised in monuments: soldiers, high ranking military, the royals, civilian victims or resisters…? This, of course, brought up the matter of who was to build and finance these memorials, where they should be placed, and what they should look like. It was clear that local or national authorities would play a role in this, but in a state where they were overwhelmed with financial and logistic problems, they initially did not consider monuments a priority and were reluctant to make decisions. As a consequence – and despite the urgency felt by the population – the building of official monuments did not start immediately after the Armistice.31 At this point, temporary monuments provided an answer. They were less cumbersome to realise and allowed at least temporarily for actual lieux de mémoire to emerge.32 Realising that it would take a considerable time to finance and conceive official and expensive permanent monuments, local authorities were interested in involvement in the realisation of these temporary counterparts. These not only offered a possibility quickly to acknowledge military effort and sacrifice but they were also instrumental in the legitimation of the victory of the nation state, and in some cases in consolidating the emerging post-war world order.\n\nIn this respect, they were reminiscent of the longstanding tradition of political use of temporary sculpture. Already in the sixteenth century the contribution of artists to patriotic celebrations – such as Joyous Entries or anniversaries of nations and rulers33 – through the design of ephemeral sculptures was customary in countries such as Belgium:\n\nIn every epoch of our history, Belgian art has largely contributed to rejoicing the fatherland, and the grandest artists have not looked down upon attaching their name to ephemeral creations whose glory helped to perpetuate the memory.34\n\nThis type of work involved artists from many different trades: architects, stage set designers, decorators, craftsmen, painters, sculptors… In Antwerp, for example, painter Pieter Paul Rubens (1577-1640) created and oversaw the ephemeral decorations for the festive entry of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria in 1634 and turned it into “what was beyond doubt the most splendid of all princely pageants”.35 Temporary sculptures and architectural contributions remained part of the pomp and circumstance of official celebrations over the centuries.36 The close involvement of artists in patriotic celebrations further intensified with the foundation of the nation state in 1830. Every year on this national holiday the streets of Brussels underwent a true metamorphosis. The capital was reshaped into a grand open-air fair with flags and pennants, large flower arrangements, paintings and temporary sculptures and architectural structures. These ephemeral artworks had a legitimising, educational and commemorative function: they represented the grandeur and the history of the nation while at the same time contributing to it. The mostly short-lived constructions and adjoining sculptures depicted the glorious past and future of the country and focussed on the monarchy and the constitution to legitimate the nation state.37\n\nThe use of ephemeral sculptures was also customary in traditional religious, folkloric and historical pageants (which had been common since the late Middle Ages),38 and in International and World Exhibitions which Belgium enthusiastically organised in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (Antwerp 1894, Brussels 1897, Liège 1905, Brussels 1910, Ghent 1913).39 Joyous Entries, patriotic celebrations, historic and religious pageants and International Expositions were all temporary spectacles, built to be wondered at and then dismantled. To a greater or lesser extent, official bodies were involved in their creation as commissioners and financiers. Through their spectacular qualities, artistic merit and the use of well-known iconographies they consolidated political ideologies.\n\nThe first temporary memorials which were erected in Belgium after the war were direct exponents of these traditions. On the occasion of the festive re-entry of the Royal Family into the Belgian capital on 22 November 1918 an exceptional series of ten temporary monuments was made.40 Although this event took place 11 days after the actual signing of the armistice (on 11 November 1918), this day was considered the real end of the occupation and marked the beginning of the post-war era in Belgium.41 The monuments were commissioned by the city of Brussels and placed in the historic centre as part of the festal decorations. Compared to most wartime temporary memorials, their emergence was obviously less spontaneous and less bottom-up. The enterprise was supervised by city architect François Malfait (1872-1955), assisted by peintres décorateurs Jean Delescluze (1871-1947) and Albert Dubosq (1864-1940).42 Next to these lavish decorations, the military parade and the festive atmosphere, the public monuments were an important attraction – they were also photographed and as such disseminated via postcards. The monuments were made in plaster, following the traditional “staff” technique that was also used for the temporary buildings and monuments for the Belgian International Exhibitions and World Fairs. As the project was conceived in the short transitional period between the armistice and the Royal Entry, the usual commissioning procedures for public monuments were not followed, which resulted in fewer restrictions than usual and more freedom for the participating artists.\n\nAs late as mid-November 1918, local newspapers reported that the city council had voted a budget of 500,000 francs for the city’s decoration on the occasion of the Royal Entry, including the monuments.43 According to the newspaper Le Soir, the sculptors completed their plaster projects in only a fortnight – an almost impossible exploit, as just the casting in plaster of such large models takes a considerable time.44 Le Soir spoke of “improvised” monuments,45 but it seems – and this is only logical – that most artists involved creatively reused or adapted existing models or designs from their studios. Art critic Sander Pierron (1872-1945) formulated it as such: “[a] not so quite spontaneous flowering, for if some of these works were realised as quickly as the victory of our armies asserted, others had been long conceived and executed in the silence of the workshops”.46 For instance, Charles Samuel (1862-1938) corresponded already in 1916 with the Brussels’ Compagnie des Bronzes concerning his statuette La Brabançonne, which he reworked into a larger, more detailed statue in 191847 (Fig. 4). Pierron spoke of “sketches” that would have to be reworked or fine-tuned when later realised in marble or bronze.\n\nFig. 4. Charles Samuel, La Brabançonne, plaster and wood, November 1918, Brussels, Grand-Place, photograph Sylvain. (Ghent University Library)\n\nApparently, no clear programme, formal guidelines or templates were provided, which left room for improvisation in the design and iconography on the part of the sculptors. As a consequence the monuments varied remarkably in style, genre, height and format, and featured reliefs and busts as well as full-length statues. The all-figurative statues represented personalities as well as small realist groups (the troops, the wounded or grieving women) and semi-nude historical and abstract allegories (e.g. Lady Belgium – sometimes called La Brabançonne – with different qualities, triumphant, fierce or grieving). Moreover, the statues were adorned with patriotic attributes such as flags, lions, Adrian helmets and laurel wreaths in various combinations. The monuments paid homage to a variety of causes in the military sphere: to the heroism and sacrifice of the Belgian soldiers, the wounded soldiers, the British nurse Edith Cavell executed in Brussels48 (Fig. 5), King Albert I, the Allies (monuments dedicated to France, Italy, England and the United States) and more abstract subjects such as “liberty”, “law” and “peace”. By honouring the Allies, international diplomatic concerns were covered. This was much less the case for internal sensibilities regarding the suffering of different groups in the civilian population, who had lived different war experiences (at the front, as resisters in occupied Belgium, in German labour camps, as refugees abroad…). After the war tensions rose between them as to who had suffered most and which experiences should be commemorated (first), influencing post-war decisions about monuments.49 Thus, the only semi-improvised nature of the monuments as well as the fact that they were official commissions makes them very much an “in between” series, bridging the transition from war to peace, from ad hoc remembrance to orchestrated commemoration.\n\nCompared to the international avant-garde en vogue at the time, most of the temporary monuments described above were designed in a fairly academic or realist-allegorical style indebted to the nineteenth-century sculptural tradition. After all, these were artworks aimed to appeal to the public at large, to local communities, with particular demands concerning form and content and with a specific function. This led to straightforward, uplifting and recognisable figurative designs. Moreover, several of the authors of the 1918 monuments belonged to the “older” generation (born in the 1850s and 1860s) and had well-established careers. Many were trainees from the Brussels Academy (most of them being pupils of Charles Van der Stappen (1843-1910)) and stemmed from higher social classes. The 1918 project provided them with not only an opportunity to show generosity and patriotism, but also the chance to obtain visibility and remuneration after a grim financial period. The Fédération Professionnelle des Beaux-Arts, set up in September 1914, provided sculptors in occupied Brussels with plaster and a monthly sum in order to help them survive, but they could hardly work and sell during the war. Marble was scarce, and bronze was requisitioned by the occupier from late 1915.50 Whereas exhibitions and salons were still organised during wartime in some Brussels museums and galleries, for the benefit of the artists in need, they mainly exhibited portraits and salonfähige, charming paintings. Sculptures – even in plaster or terracotta – were largely absent, as were avant-garde works that were considered too much of a risk and thus less attractive for buyers and collectors of art seeking secure investments in times of devaluation.51\n\nFig. 5. Jacques Marin, Monument to Edith Cavell, plaster and wood, November 1918, Brussels, Grand-Place, picture postcard. (Brussels City Archive, Guerre 1914-1918 [Monuments provisoires érigés dans la Ville de Bruxelles (en 1918 ou 1919) en reconnaissance aux soldats et victimes de la guerre], C-1879)\n\nProgressing Towards Permanent Memorials… But Not Just Yet\n\nThe statues erected in Brussels in 1918 were made without any immediate prospect of making them permanent, even if Le Belge Indépendant called them “plaster models of future commemorative monuments”.52 According to the same newspaper, the statues were intended to remain in place until Christmas. Some stayed a few weeks longer, but by February 1919 all sculptures were removed from the public space and most likely returned to their authors or demolished.53 However, the monuments had struck a chord, and several plans to perpetuate them were initiated.54 Three out of the ten temporary monuments would ultimately be given a permanent character, albeit only after a considerable time and with some minor changes. Not surprisingly, only “unproblematic” monuments representing Belgium in the most general sense were retained: Jules Lagae’s (1862-1931) monument to King Albert, Guillaume Charlier’s (1854-1925) La Belgique reconquise, and Charles Samuel’s La Brabançonne (the latter two represent Lady Belgium holding the national flag). Monuments referring to specific groups (À nos blessés by Jos Van Hamme, or À nos soldats morts pour la patrie by Jules Mascré) or to the allies, and monuments airing anti-German sentiments (La Belgique repoussant l’invasion des barbares by the French-born Marquis Jean de Pouilly) disappeared after the festivities.\n\nSamuel’s La Brabançonne seems to have been the most popular of the series. It was the last stucco monument to be removed and already before that a possible permanent location was discussed by the Brussels city council. In January 1919, François Malfait suggested the Place de la Chapelle in the popular Marolles neighbourhood, but this idea did not materialise.55 In April 1920, on the occasion of the first post-war Brussels Commercial Fair, the plaster monument reappeared briefly in the Royal Park, only to be quickly removed afterwards.56 Finally in 1930, Samuel’s Brabançonne model was cast in bronze to mark the Belgian centenary. Prior to the festivities, money had been raised by public subscription. It was then relocated to the slightly peripheral Surlet De Chokier Square where it still stands today.57 The statue was put on a new pedestal and reframed by a new inscription: the first couplet of the national anthem, La Brabançonne.58\n\nThat only a few of the November 1918 temporary monuments were re-used later is remarkable. Nevertheless, several of the sculptors, most notably Georges Vandevoorde (1878-1964), Léandre Grandmoulin (1873-1957) and Jacques Marin (1877-1950), as well as architect François Malfait, moved on to make war memorials in Brussels and elsewhere in the 1920s and 1930s. Commonplace dedications like “à nos soldats morts pour la patrie” or “à nos héros”, which were featured on the early temporary monuments, as well as representations of King Albert, personifications of the Belgian poilu or La Brabançonne, allegories such as the Belgian lion devouring the German eagle, as well as symbols such as the Belgian flag or laurel wreaths were commonly reused in the permanent war memorials. Yet, most of these elements can hardly be considered original. They had been common throughout the war and stemmed from laic iconographical imagery predating the First World War. In that respect, the impact of the 1918 temporary monuments on post-war sculpture was limited.\n\nThe temporary monuments erected in Brussels in November 1918 were the first, but certainly not the last, post-war emanation of the urge to commemorate. They were quickly followed by other initiatives, material as well as immaterial. Several patriotic associations established after the war, such as the Ligue des patriotes (Patriotic League) and the Ligue du Souvenir (Remembrance League), aimed for the commemoration of war heroes through immaterial commemorations such as public funerals and remembrance ceremonies. Some associations, such as the Bond der Politieke Gevangenen van den Oorlog (League of Political Prisoners of War), specifically focussed on the commemoration of civilian heroes. The latter also became the focal point of remembrance in towns that had suffered exceptionally during the war, such as the villes martyres. In the Walloon village of Tamines for instance, which lost over 380 inhabitants overnight in August 1914, a large wooden cross with a commemorative plaque was erected on the Place Saint Martin immediately after the armistice59 (Fig. 6). Although discussions about a permanent official monument of a more suitable design to remember the civilian victims had been ongoing since January 1919, the deteriorating wooden cross was replaced with an almost identical concrete one in 1923. It took another three years, until August 1926, before an official monument in honour of the civilian victims was inaugurated: a sculptural group by Louis Mascré (1871-1927) (also one of the sculptors involved in the 1918 Brussels temporary monuments). In Louvain (Leuven), another ville martyre, a wooden column was erected in the municipal cemetery on 12 January 1919 on the occasion of a patriotic manifestation in honour of the city’s civilian martyrs.60 Already in December 1915, the city had been planning a permanent memorial for its civilian victims after the war. What followed was a ten-year agony. Finally, the permanent and large-scale “monument to the martyrs” was inaugurated in April 1925.61\n\nFig. 6.

(private collection)\n\nOn a different scale, a robust temporary cenotaph (an empty tomb) was placed in the park in front of the Royal Palace in Brussels on the occasion of the national jubilee and the subsequent Marche de la Victoire (21 and 22 July) in 1919. The cenotaph gave death a literally massive presence amid the victory celebrations. This temporary structure was erected in anticipation of a great national war memorial to be built in Brussels later on – a project that would be abandoned altogether in 1924.62 The Brussels cenotaph was designed by city architect François Malfait, and put on the same spot where in November 1918 one of the temporary monuments had stood: Philippe Wolfers’s (1858-1929) group of two female nudes, À nos héros.63 Some ceremonies took place at the cenotaph and it was removed immediately thereafter. Following the capital’s example, in 1919 and 1920 provisional cenotaphs appeared in numerous Belgian cities, such as Arlon, Bouillon, Engin, Halen, Halle, Koekelberg, Marcinelle and Mechelen.64\n\nAs a common typology for a funerary monument, the laic and solemn design of the cenotaph had wide international appeal. In the summer of 1919 temporary cenotaphs were erected in many different countries on the occasion of memorial festivities. For the French national holiday, on 14 July, cenotaphs were raised in several French cities, such as Nancy, Lisieux and Paris, where a short-lived cenotaph was placed under the Arc de Triomphe.65 In London, the Peace Parade on 19 July, celebrating the Versailles Peace Treaty, was the occasion for placing a cenotaph by architect Sir Edwin Lutyens in the middle of Whitehall. It remained in situ until it was replaced with a permanent stone cenotaph of roughly the same design in 1920.66\n\nConclusion: Temporary, Untimely and yet Timeless\n\nThis essay has explored the phenomenon of temporary memorials erected during and immediately after the Great War in Belgium. These temporary memorials initiated a trajectory of material commemoration of the Great War that strongly marked the 1920s and 1930s and is still ongoing today. They were conceived to share grief and structure collective commemorations at an “untimely time”. During and immediately after the war the grief was overwhelming, and the need for these memorials was deeply felt by the people. At the same time official bodies were paralysed by not only occupation, cumbersome procedures and the lack of financial means and debate, but also a lack of consensus as to who or what was to be commemorated and in what way. Temporary monuments immediately provided for people’s commemorative needs and intentions with a locus – a place to grieve and gather. As such, they had a lot in common with their permanent counterparts, from which they differed mostly in terms of their immediacy and their often bottom-up genesis.\n\nDespite their variety, the temporary memorials discussed here shared some important characteristics. First, their creation interactively involved three different actors: the people (usually united in informal or ad hoc groups), (commissioning) local authorities or official committees, and the artists and artisans involved in their conception and design. The degree to which each actor was involved depended on both the place and the time the monument was conceived and created. Small and simple memorials emerging during the war – such as street shrines or graves decorated with flowers – were much more bottom-up and the result of ad hoc co-creation by local inhabitants than larger more official memorials such as the November 1918 series of temporary monuments in Brussels and the post-war temporary cenotaphs, created by professional sculptors and architects. The momentum they created allowed for a creative investment of the people and the artists in public space that was hitherto seldom seen.\n\nYet – and this is a second feature – despite their spontaneous and temporary nature, these temporary memorials were generally not original: their concepts and designs were mostly traditional and timeless. Abstract shapes such as steles, crosses or cenotaphs that could appeal to all were open to a variety of commemorative needs and interpretations and therefore did not require – or instigate – extensive debate. Nor did these designs require the input of the most skilled, famous artists, who were not always readily available. This might also explain why the fleeting character of the temporary memorials did not inspire more daring experiments. Only the larger and more official, top-down initiatives – such as the November 1918 series of temporary monuments in Brussels – displayed considerable artistic and political ambition and as such echoed a long tradition of the use of temporary sculptures and architectural structures in patriotic festivities.\n\nA third shared characteristic of the temporary monuments is their ad hoc character and improvised nature. They went against the grain of bureaucratic procedures and long consensus-oriented debates and were characterised by quick decision-making processes, creative workarounds and the use of readily available materials. Even if their design was traditional, their execution (process) could still be original. This makes the November 1918 series in Brussels all the more exceptional. Thanks to the short time-span and lack of a clear programme, there was room for improvisation and recuperation on the artists’ part. No fewer than ten figurative plaster monuments were quickly made, some hastily created from scratch, others based on existing elements or fragments that were recuperated, adapted or reoriented for this purpose. Each monument was dedicated to a specific cause. The series and its “pop-up” wartime precedents preceded or avoided debates about worthy causes, finances and aesthetics that would erupt in full force barely a few months later. They were improvised ad hoc solutions for an “untimely time”."
