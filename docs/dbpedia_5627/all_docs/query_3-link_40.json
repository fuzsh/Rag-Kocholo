Which FPMT teacher said this: “Without the moisture of devotion, our enthusiasm for practice dries up and our heart becomes hard. The wellspring of our devotion needs to be constantly renewed.

Thubten Dondrub, Resident Teacher, Hayagriva Buddhist Centre, Kensington, WA, Australia)\n\n2. About which FPMT teacher did one student remark: “In addition to being a great teacher, I also consider her a friend. She visited me at the hospital after my cancer surgery and stayed with me the night I got home to make sure nothing bad happened. She also presided at my sister-in-law’s memorial service. She encouraged me to sit with the dying. Although I was reluctant to do this, I found it very rewarding in the end. She seems to know how to stretch people beyond where they might normally consider their boundaries. She’s compassionate, witty, and wise as well as exhibiting a surprising geekiness when it comes to technology.” (Answer: I; Ven. Losang Drimay, Resident Teacher, Gyalwa Gyatso Buddhist Center, Campbell, California, USA)\n\n3.

About which FPMT teacher did one student remark: “She has this amazing energy, incredible sense of humor and a way of teaching Dharma that is both personal and practical.

Amy Miller, FPMT Touring Teacher)\n\n5. About which FPMT teacher did one student remark: “I love the way his teachings have no mention of a single ‘don’t do this or that.’ He does not impose or preach.” (Answer: P; Glen Svensson, FPMT Touring Teacher)\n\n6. Which FPMT teacher said this, “The advantage with journeys to the inner world is that you don’t need ticket, visa, passport or whatever. You can go whenever you want, you only need some courage. Now I don’t know about your inner world, but mine is definitely full of crap but fascinating. If you are not afraid of the crap, and you have some humor, the inner world certainly becomes the perfect travel ground.” (Answer: L; Ven. Rita Riniker, FPMT Touring Teacher)\n\n7.

Which FPMT teacher said this, “Buddha says basically, the extent to which we are not in touch with the truth, the extent to which we are not in touch with how things exist, at many levels, is the extent to which we suffer. So the getting of wisdom, as far as Buddha is concerned, isn’t so you can end up being a smarty pants and getting full marks in your philosophy exam. The reason to get wisdom is to get happy and to benefit others. So there is a really practical basis for it. It’s not just being clever. And this, across the board, is how the Buddha talks.” (Answer: R; Ven. Robina Courtin, Resident Teacher, Tushita Meditation Centre, Dharamsala, India)\n\n11. About which FPMT teacher did one student remark: “I find him humble, humane, funny, friendly, warm, honest, open, approachable and know ledgeable, his teaching very practical, his instruction and explanation very simple and effortless to follow, his analogies so down to earth and easy to relate to as they often come from his own experiences and observations, and his responses to my questions profound.” (Answer: N; Wai Cheong Kok, Resident Teacher, Vajrayana Institute, Ashfield, NSW, Australia)\n\n12. About which FPMT teacher did a student share, “To be in the presence of him is to feel loved, understood and deeply cared about. His great intellectual understanding, monastic experience, language and translating skills are vast and complemented by a teaching style that is warm, gentle and filled with an extraordinary depth of wisdom and compassion … He is affectionately referred to as ‘Grandpa Love’ by my children.” (Answer: R; Jampa Gendun, FPMT Touring Teacher)\n\n13.

About which FPMT teacher did one student remark: “As a teacher he is warm, dedicated and always down to earth on a very honest and personal level. He is an inspiring and warmhearted person, very easy to get along with and humble too. What I admire most is his compassion, honesty and sincerity.” (Answer: S; Stephan Pende, Resident Teacher, Tong-nyi Nying-je Ling, Denmark)\n\n16. About which FPMT teacher did one student remark: “Not only was she perennially kind, supportive and adaptable, but rare was the day that did not start with the greeting, “Good morning, beautiful people!” nor involve crossing paths with at least one ‘happy little Vegemite.’ In awe, I once asked her how she managed to be so irrepressibly positive.

The cause of suffering (craving desire) has to be abandoned. Contentment has to be experienced. And restraining the senses has to be cultivated. By restraining the senses, craving desire is cooled. By cooling craving desire, one is more content. And by being content, one stops dissatisfaction.” (Answer: A; Ven. Fedor Stracke, Resident Teacher, Munich, Aryatara Institut, Germany)\n\n19. Which FPMT teacher said this, “One obstacle is to push ourselves beyond our ability and impose on our practice an idea of how much we should meditate rather than looking at how much we are actually able to meditate.

Lobsang Namgyel, FPMT Touring Teacher)\n\n22. About which FPMT teacher did one student remark, “Meeting him was a revelation and a breath of fresh air.

(Answer: S; Ven. Sangye Khadro, FPMT Touring Teacher)\n\n30. About which FPMT teacher did one student remark, “She has provided me with invaluable guidance with her reviews of my Discovering Buddhism at Home module assessments.

For a while I was lucky, then life hit me like a ton of bricks and I lost faith in my heart.
