        "text": "13 September 2014\n\nBioplastics: Are They the Solution?\n\nBy Sarah (Steve) Mosko\n\nBioplastics are simply defined as plastics derived from renewable biomass sources, like plants and microorganisms, whereas conventional plastics are synthesized from non-renewable fossil fuels, either petroleum or natural gas. Itâs a common misconception, however, that a bioplastic necessarily breaks down better in the environment than conventional plastics.\n\nBioplastics are nevertheless marketed as being better for the environment, but how do they really compare?\n\nThe Problems with Petroleum-Based Plastics\n\nThe push to develop bioplastics emerges from alarming realities starting with the staggering quantity of plastics being produced, over 20 pounds a month for every U.S. resident, according to the latest numbers from the American Chemistry Council.Conventional plastics do not biodegrade (defined below) within any meaningful human timescale â they just break apart into smaller plastic fragments. This means that, except for a tiny fraction of plastic that is combusted for energy production, all plastic eventually ends up as trash, either in landfills or as litter.\n\nPetroleum and natural gas are actually organic substances, but why plastics synthesized from them do not biodegrade is straightforward. The exceptionally strong carbon-carbon bonds created to form the backbone of plastic polymers do not occur naturally in nature so are foreign to microorganisms which readily eat up other organic materials.\n\nMolecules of conventional plastic are also gigantic, making them extra difficult to digest. Each is composed of literally thousands of repeating units called âmonomersâ so that the weight of a finished polymer molecule is typically over 10,000 (for comparison, the weight of a single water molecule is 18). The simplest is polyethylene (grocery bags, ketchup & shampoo bottles, e.g.) which is just an enormous string of carbon atoms with attached hydrogen atoms.\n\nCaptain Charles Mooreâs latest trawls in the North Pacific Garbage Patch between California and Japan revealed that the ratio of the weight of plastic debris to zooplankton has risen to 36:1, a six-fold increase in a single decade. Plastic debris is increasing in even the most remote of ocean areas, like the Arctic seafloor.\n\nBuildup of plastics in the marine environment is particularly worrisome. Creatures as varied as sandworms, barnacles, krill, jellyfish, birds, turtles and whales are known to ingest plastic debris, which can block digestive tracts, while many forms of sea life die instead from entanglement.\n\nFurthermore, ingested plastics are a vehicle for transfer of toxins in seawater into the food web because we know from Japanese researchers that the oily nature of plastics allows them to concentrate oily toxins (like polychlorinated biphenyls, nonylphenols and derivatives of DDT) from seawater onto their surfaces. Food web contamination from potentially risky chemicals added to plastics during their manufacture (like bisphenol-A, phthalates and nonylphenols) is a parallel concern.\n\nTo understand if bioplastics are less of a hazard to the marine and other environments, itâs first helpful to clear up the meanings of often misconstrued terms describing the breakdown of plastics.\n\nDegradable â Biodegradable â Compostable\n\nStandards for measuring how plastics break down in particular environments have emerged only recently so are still in development. Comparisons among plastics are further complicated by the fact that no one entity is universally recognized as setting those standards.\n\nNevertheless, international standards have been established by two bodies, ASTM International (formerly American Society for Testing and Materials) and the Switzerland-based International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Despite the confusion this fragmentation generates, there is consensus on the distinctions between the key terms: degradable, biodegradable and compostable.\n\nDegradable simply means that chemical changes takes place, maybe from sunlight or heat, that alter a plasticâs structure and properties, like clouding or fragmenting.Biodegradable more narrowly denotes that the degradation results from naturally-occurring microorganisms (bacteria, fungi or algae) but makes no guarantee that the degradation products are non-toxic or make good compost. Compostable goes a step further: ASTMâs definition, for example, specifies that the microorganismsâ breakdown products must yield âCO2, water, inorganic compounds, and biomass at a rate consistent with other known compostable materials and leave no visible, distinguishable or toxic residue,â such as heavy metals.\n\nPlastics can potentially be designed to meet any standard(s) set by ASTM or ISO for breakdown in either aerobic environments, like water or soil, or in anaerobic ones (lacking oxygen), like enclosed wastewater treatment systems. The sealed-off environment within conventional landfills, however, is not amenable to biodegradation of any materials, so there has been little interest in developing standards for landfills.\n\nPlastics manufacturers submit finished products to independent testing organizations which certify whether they meet standards for biodegradable or compostable in given environments.\n\nThe Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI) in New York offers a single certification, guaranteeing compostability (as defined by ASTM) in an industrial composter where conditions like temperature and humidity are tightly controlled. However, the significance of this certification within the United States is undermined by the reality that there are very few industrial composting facilities nationwide.\n\nIn Europe, where development of an infrastructure for composting is further along, the organization VinÃ§otte offers not only certification for industrial compostable but also for home compostable, biodegradable in agricultural soil, and biodegradable in fresh water.\n\nThe sole standard for biodegradation of plastics in the marine environment basically requires that, within six months, the plastic must be disintegrated into bits smaller than two millimeters and that biodegradation must have progressed so that at least 30 percent of the carbon has been converted by microorganisms into carbon dioxide (ASTM D7081). Neither BPI nor VinÃ§otte yet offer certification for this, so any company making this claim would be basing it on their own testing.\n\nA Look at Bioplastics on the Market Today\n\nThe following compares the certifications and other environmental merits of some contemporary bioplastics grouped according to the source material (i.e. feedstock). Although starch and cellulose are actually biopolymers found in the natural world which can be converted into plastics (like packing peanuts which dissolve in water), the following discussion is limited to biopolymers synthesized by microorganisms in industrial settings because they represent the frontier of bioplastics and can be processed on the same equipment as conventional plastics.\n\nBe mindful that you canât rely on the internationally-recognized numbered chasing arrows system to identify bioplastics. Nearly all bioplastics fall under the â#7 OTHERâ label which is a catchall for plastics not made of the conventional resin types, labeled #1 â #6.\n\nCorn\n\nJust one company worldwide claims to make bioplastics that meet ASTMâs marine biodegradable standard, Metabolix based in Massachusetts.\n\nPolyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biodegradable monomers, naturally made by bacteria during fermentation of sugar, which can be combined to make high molecular weight polymers suitable for plastics. Metabolix is using bacteria genetically altered to produce high yields of PHAs from the sugar in corn kernels. The resulting biopolymer, Mirelâ¢, is pure PHAs except for proprietary additives mixed in to impart desired properties. According to company spokesperson Lynne Brum, the additives do not include bisphenol-A, phthalates or nonylphenols which have been linked to health problems in lab animals or humans.\n\nVarious Mirelâ¢ resins are available for fashioning into many typically disposable items, such as eating utensils, food storage tubs, jars and lids. All are certified for industrial composting, and some are also certified for home composting and/or biodegradation in agricultural soil or fresh water.\n\nHowever, only the thinnest film grades of Mirelâ¢, appropriate for making carryout bags, yard waste/kitchen compost bags and agricultural film, supposedly meet marine biodegradable standards because greater material thickness would impede biodegradation.\n\nAs is true of conventional plastics and organic materials in general, Mirelâ¢ will not biodegrade in landfills. Brum stated that although closed-loop recycling of Mirelâ¢ is certainly possible, the companyâs focus thus far has been on biodegradation as an end-of-life option.\n\nPolylactic acid (PLA) is a different biopolymer derived from corn through fermentation by bacteria that naturally produce lactic acid which is then tweaked to form polymers. The primary U.S.manufacturer, NatureWorks LLC, advertises that its PLA resin family, Ingeo,relies on no genetically-modified materials and uses 50 percent less energy and produces 60 percent fewer greenhouse gases than petroleum-based polymers. The range of possible applications is very wide, including clothing, durable goods like mobile phone casings, credit cards, drink bottles and all sorts of food packaging & food service items.\n\nAlthough Ingeo does not biodegrade in any water or soil environments, it has received certifications for industrial composting. NatureWorks points out that used Ingeo is being recycled in a closed loop into new Ingeo, but recycling on a large scale is not yet feasible because Ingeo products lack a unique identification code and they have to be shipped to the sole recycler inNebraska.\n\nAn Italian company, Novamont, is manufacturing a family of biodegradable resins under the label MATER-BIÂ® which do not necessarily qualify fully as bioplastics because unspecified âmonomersâ derived from âfossil fuelsâ can be used in the proprietary blends of ingredients which include cornstarch plus other renewables, like vegetable oils. Nevertheless, MATER-BIÂ® resins are certified for industrial composting, and the company claims the feedstocks do not rely on genetically modified crops or deforestation. MATER-BIÂ® can be made into a myriad of products including doggie poop bags, mulching film, shopping bags, bubble wrap, pens and rulers\n\nSugarcane\n\nPolyethylene (PE), the most ubiquitous plastic, is made by polymerizing ethylene synthesized from ethanol derived conventionally from petroleum, though synthesis of ethanol from plant sources is also possible. In Brazil, where sugarcane grows abundantly, a company namedBraskem is manufacturing ethylene instead from ethanol made from fermented sugarcane. Braskem touts that its âGreen Ethyleneâ is 100 percent renewable source-based and the resulting âGreen PEâ resins are at least 84 percent renewable content.\n\nBecause Green PE is identical to that produced from petroleum, it can be made into the very same products and recycled together with conventional PE. However, this also means it is no more biodegradable than conventional PE in any environment and poses the same risks to the ocean food chain.\n\nNevertheless, Braskem asserts that Green PE merits its green label on other grounds, like the fact that growing sugarcane draws carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. For every kilogram of Green PE produced, 2.5 kilograms of carbon dioxide are supposedly sequestered in the resin. Also, 50 percent more ethanol can be fermented from sugarcane than from corn.\n\nAre Plastics Really Convenient?\n\nSingle-use, disposable plastics were a direct outgrowth of industries developed during World War II and quickly became symbolic of the convenience of modern day living. The supply of fossil fuels felt endless at the time, and the fact that plastics could be made into just about anything and were so long-lasting seemed a good thing.\n\nNowadays, the prospect of mass conversion from conventional plastics to ones made from renewable sources is raising concerns typically centered on deforestation, monocultures, fresh water supplies, soil erosion, food supplies and food prices as arable land would be diverted to growing feedstock for bioplastics.\n\nBioplastics manufacturers like to point to the fact that the fraction of global food crops or farm acreage currently used to make bioplastics is miniscule, sidestepping the obvious question of what the realistic impacts would be if bioplastics ever replace conventional ones on a large scale. Consider that ethanol gas, for example, is already in competition with the food supply for available corn.\n\nA research institute in Rotorua, New Zealand called Scion is experimenting with an alternative renewable feedstock, sewage sludge. The idea is that, by cooking sewage sludge, reusable substances can be recovered and converted into bioplastics as well as fertilizers and biofuels. However, the first pilot plant began operations just a year ago, so it will be a long while before the feasibility of making any plastics from sewage is known.\n\nEven if the feedstock issues can be resolved, what to do with plastics at the end of their useful life looms as the more daunting problem. Global figures from 2011 say the world is currently consuming over 450 billion pounds of plastic products a year (99 percent from fossil fuels), and plastic industry experts expect demand to rise exponentially within the next five years.\n\nEven without any change in average per capita consumption (~65 pounds/year), humanity and the planet will be burdened with well over 700 billion pounds ofadditional plastics each year by mid-century when the worldâs population is expected to top nine billion.\n\nBioplastics designed to biodegrade in industrial composters are no doubt an important step in reducing the burden placed on landfills, although widespread municipal composting in less developed countries is, at best, a pipedream at this point. Furthermore, making plastics compostable does nothing to prevent the continuing buildup of plastics in the marine environment. Ocean plastics derive primarily from land-based sources, like street litter carried via storm drains which empty into rivers flowing into the sea.\n\nWhile the development of marine biodegradable plastics should be encouraged, it is wishful thinking to assume they will ultimately be the solution. Marine biodegradable plastics do not just dissolve in seawater. ASTMâs marine biodegradable standard allows that decomposing plastics can linger in seawater for many months, ample time to endanger sea life by ingestion or entanglement. Furthermore, we know nothing yet about how bioplastics compare to conventional ones as vehicles for transferring oily toxins in seawater into the food chain.\n\nItâs even conceivable that wide availability of marine biodegradable plastics would add to the volume of ocean plastics because labeling as marine biodegradable might encourage dumping at sea, even though any ocean dumping of plastics has been illegal since 1988 by international treaty (MARPOL Annex V).\n\nHalting the flow of all types of plastics into the ocean is the most rational solution to the crisis of plastic ocean debris. On a local level, this simply entails placing secure lids on trash receptacles and well-designed grates across all storm drains and river mouths that outflow to the sea. On a societal level, however, this means a deliberate shift away from the throwaway culture that led to the exponential rise in the production of plastics in the first place.\n\nAfter more than a half century of profligate consumption of plastics, we are face-to-face with the reality that there is nothing convenient about getting rid of it all and preventing it from trashing our oceans and contaminating the marine food web.\n\n16/12/2013\n\nM&G Chemicals Launches Green Revolution in the Polyester Chain\n\nSHANGHAI, M&G Chemicals announces today its decision to construct a\n\nsecond-generation bio-refinery in the region of Fuyang, Anhui Province of China for the conversion of one\n\nmillion metric tons of biomass into bio-ethanol and bio-glycols.\n\nThe project is expected to be realized through a joint-venture with Chinese company Guozhen which will\n\nmake available one million metric tons of straw biomass and use the lignin resulting as a by-product from\n\nthe bio-refinery to feed a 45 MW cogeneration plant which will be constructed at the same time as the\n\nbio-refinery in the same site. M&G Chemicals will be majority partner of the bio-refinery and minority partner\n\nof the power plant.\n\nThe bio-refinery will employ PROESATM technology licensed from Beta Renewables, a joint venture between\n\nBiochemtex (a company belonging to the Mossi Ghisolfi Group), US private equity fund TPG and Danish\n\nenzyme producer Novozymes.\n\nThe second-generation bio-refinery will be approximately four times the size (measured by volume of\n\nbiomass processed) of that built by Beta Renewables in Crescentino, Italy, which was recently inaugurated.\n\nThe plant, which is expected to require capital expenditures of approximately half a billion US dollars, is\n\nexpected to be brought on stream in mid 2015.\n\nNecessary enzymes will be supplied by Novozymes, one of the world's largest enzymes producers and one\n\nof the partners in the Beta Renewables joint venture, which owns the rights of the PROESATM technology.\n\n\"This is the first act of a green revolution that M&G Chemicals is bringing to the polyester chain to\n\nprovide environmental sustainability to both PET beverage packaging and polyester textile,\" said Mr. Marco\n\nGhisolfi, CEO of M&G Chemicals. \"The timing and scope of our green polyester revolution and our\n\nmanufacturing entry in China from the green PET raw materials avenue is even more relevant considering\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company has announced plans to use PlantBottleâ¢ packaging, which is partially made from\n\nplants, for all of their PET plastic bottles across the globe by 2020,\" Marco Ghisolfi added.\n\n\"M&G Chemicals is today taking a big step towards a bio-based society where biomass is used for\n\nproducts like fuel, chemicals and plastics.

But, the opportunities do not come without some key challenges that Europe needs to address.\n\nEurope remains an important producer of chemicals on the global stage, but it has faced severe competition in recent years from a wave of lower-cost capacity in the Middle East. Now, another rival has emerged as the US reaps the benefits of large reserves of low-cost shale gas which has radically boosted its competitiveness.\n\nâEurope has its own shale gas resources and these deserve to be explored and developed, if economically feasible, in an environmentally responsible and transparent manner,â states Peter Holicki, EPCA vice president and vice president of operations for Europe, Middle East & Africa at Dow Chemical. âEurope is well positioned to learn from the US experience in terms of best technologies and operational practices. It would be extraordinary if we do not look to the same possibilities for securing our own industrial competitiveness and future economic success,â he adds.\n\nTom Crotty, group director of corporate affairs at INEOS agrees. âIf Europe misses out on shale gas development, it will be a huge mistake. It is essential,â he says emphatically. The pace of development is not going fast enough for Crotty, but INEOS is already taking steps to secure its own shale gas/ethane source for its cracker in Rafnes, Norway.\n\nUnder a 15-year shipping agreement with Denmarkâs Evergas, three customised gas carriers are being built in China to transport ethane from Marcus Hook in Pennsylvania, US, to Rafnes. The vessels will enter into service in 2015 when a new ethane storage tank and expanded infrastructure at Rafnes is also expected to be commissioned. Investment is also being considered at the port in Grangemouth, UK, where INEOS operates its other gas cracker, to facilitate imports of US ethane.\n\nEuropean producers have been rationalising capacity to bolster their competitive position, and this will continue for the smaller, less efficient plants. But, the industry has also been considering alternatives to traditional production methods in a bid to address several factors, namely: the ongoing need to reduce emissions and energy use; expanding its use of renewable sources, and the ongoing volatility of oil-based feedstock prices.\n\nBIOMASS PROJECTS COME ONSTREAM\n\nBiomass and biobased feedstocks have been growing in importance and development. INEOS Bio has its own, proprietary, biomass technology and has been running a pilot plant for several years in Wisconsin, US. This year, the company, in partnership with New Plant Energy, has commissioned its first, full-scale commercial plant based on its gasification and fermentation technology which converts biomass from vegetative and wood waste to bio-ethanol and renewable power. Annual output is 24,000 tonnes/year of cellulosic ethanol and 6MW power. Crotty says INEOS Bio is looking to build a second facility in Europe, possibly in the UK.\n\nLars Hansen, president Europe of Danish industrial biotechnology firm Novozymes, says the availability of sustainably produced biomass in Europe is quite significant. âStudies have shown that if you take around 17% of the sustainable biomass available today, you can produce more than 60% of European gasoline,â Hansen says.\n\nNovozymes is just one of 48 companies that are part of the European Commissionâs â¬3.8bn ($5.0bn) Public Private Partnership (PPP) on biobased industries, proposed in July this year. The initiative â Bridge 2020 (Biobased and Renewable Industries for Development and Growth in Europe) â has been set up to accelerate the commercialisation of bio-based products in Europe. The Commission will invest â¬1bn, and industry â¬2.8bn, from 2014 to 2020 to boost market uptake of new biobased products that are made in Europe. It is envisaged that large-scale bio-refineries will be built in Europe as flagship projects, becoming a catalyst for future development work in different bio-residues and paving the way for the next generation of plants.\n\nHansen welcomes Bridge 2020 but suggests other criteria are also required to support and cherish international investment. These are the future availability of sustainable biomass; a review of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) so that it focuses not just on food, but also on biomass for industrial production; and legislation to underpin demand and provide support for bio-products (advanced biofuels, bio-chemicals and bio-materials) in the first steps.\n\nâThe realisation that our agricultural potential is much bigger in Europe than has been perceived is crucial. Agriculture is a huge opportunity for rural development and job creation, and to address some of our energy issues. We need to look at agriculture as an opportunity, not a liability, and a mindset change is needed in political and public perception,â states Hansen.\n\nCHALLENGES FOR BIOMASS\n\nDaniele Ferrari, CEO of Italyâs Versalis, says by 2030, a significant proportion of overall EU demand for chemicals, energy, materials and fibres, will be fulfilled using biomass feedstock, although he believes biomass production areas will remain fragmented in Europe. âA key challenge for Europe is to manage mid-term constraints on biomass availability without jeopardising long-term sustainability of supply,â he says.\n\nVersalis, which will be joining Bridge 2020 soon, is growing its own on-purpose biomass to feed its biobased chemical production. The company is building a biobased complex in Sardinia through its Matrica joint venture with Novamont. Matrica products will be available soon through two of the six planned facilities which will be operational by end 2013.\n\nOther partnerships have been formed with Genomatica to produce bio-butadiene, with Yulex for guayule-based natural rubber, and with Pirelli in a joint research project on using guayule-based natural rubber in tyre production.\n\nâBio-butadiene is a significant example of unlinking the production process of a key building block material from a fossil source,â says Ferrari. He believes too that guayule, a desert shrub that produces latex and is adaptable to the Mediterranean climate, is the answer to Europeâs need to grow a renewable key raw material like natural rubber which today is totally imported.\n\nMuch progress is being made on biobased chemicals and one example of successful commercialisation is bio-succinic acid. Both BioAmber and Reverdia, a joint venture between the Dutch material and life sciences company DSM and French starch firm Roquette Freres, have made strategic advances here.\n\nLast December, Reverdia started up the worldâs first large-scale plant for sustainable succinic acid (Biosuccinium), which can be used to make polyurethanes (PU), polybutylene succinate (PBS), phthalate-free plasticisers, coating and composite resins, and Spandex/elastane fibres. The facility in Cassano Spinola, Italy, produces about 10,000 tonnes/year and is based on proprietary, low pH technology that converts sugar into succinic acid. According to a study by the Netherlands Copernicus Institute, Reverdiaâs yeast-based process generates less waste and impurities than the bacteria-based route.\n\nBIOPOLYMERS PROGRESS\n\nReverdiaâs general manager, Will van den Tweel, says the Cassano plant is a first step in the companyâs strategy towards a larger production facility which is expected to be operational in early 2016. The company is evaluating locations worldwide and should make a selection towards the end of this year. Longer-term, Reverdia anticipates that, by 2020, multiple plants could be built via licensing alliances.\n\nAlthough the existing market for succinic acid is small (about 30,000 tonnes/year for petrochemical-based product), the market for PBS, a fairly new biodegradable polymer, is expected to grow rapidly. âWe are getting close to a tipping point where the market for PBS will grow significantly. Increasing product development is being done and we will get better economies of scale that will contribute to lower prices and accelerate growth,â says van den Tweel.\n\nAt present, PBS is 50% biobased and it could reach 100% in the future, once commercially available quantities of bio-butanediol (BDO) are available â PBS is made by reacting succinic acid with BDO. He says various technologies will be available to make bio-BDO in the future, once economies of scale are reached to be competitive with petrochemical-based BDO.\n\nAnother potential application for bio-succinic acid is in replacing adipic acid where it is virtually a ânear drop-inâ in molecule terms. Van den Tweel says this could open up opportunities in polyester polyols used in the foam, footwear, coatings, and automotive industry.\n\nBioAmberâs chief commercial officer, Babette Pettersen, says the market for bio-succinic acid is projected to grow at 25-30% in the next 10 years based on the unique combination of performance, economics and sustainability that it offers across various applications. âBio-chemicals offer a whole new chemistry set with competitive performance and different functionality. Customers are looking for performance; customers pay for performance; it is not just about being green,â she comments.\n\nA successful initial public offering (IPO) in the US and France raised $80m to fund investment in what will be the worldâs largest bio-succinic acid plant. The 30,000 tonne/year facility in Sarnia, Canada, will be mechanically complete in quarter four 2014. The company has been operating a 3,000 tonne/year commercial scale plant in France since 2010.\n\nSome of the money raised will be used to scale up BioAmberâs process for converting succinic acid to BDO and further development of its C6 technology platform. Pettersen believes BioAmber could have commercial-scale production of bio-BDO within the next four years. Toll production of 2,000-4,000 tonne/year bio-BDO will start in the US by early 2015.\n\nSupport for bio-chemicals has undoubtedly grown, but, stresses Pettersen: âWe need more initiatives to create and build awareness that biobased chemicals offer not only an improved environmental profile, but also differentiated performance and competitive economics, which is better for profit, people and planet.â\n\nBio-chemicals will be a significant complement to petrochemical-based products. But government policies and incentives, technology and market development, and consumersâ attitude will be major factors in how the biobased chemical industry evolves.\n\n30/10/2012\n\nJapan: Bio-based materials develop on a wide front\n\nJapanese chemical companies are focusing on the production of sustainable bio-based commodities in order to improve their environmental footprint\n\nChemical companies in Japan are joining the move towards plant-based feedstocks\n\nUS start-ups continue to make headlines with the development of technology platforms for bio-based chemicals, often with the support of major chemical producers.\n\nBut Japan's leading chemical concerns are making their own strides towards sustainable chemistry. And as often as not they too are joining forces with Western technology providers.\n\nThe goal is to allow a shift away from oil and gas feedstocks for petrochemical intermediates, towards the use of renewable feedstocks, such as crop-derived sugars and celluloses.\n\nBig brand names in the consumer goods, food and automotive sectors are providing a stimulus for development as they seek \"greener\", more sustainable products with a strong marketing message.\n\nBut the chemical producers are also driving the move, as they seek a lower environment footprint and alternatives to increasingly expensive and volatile petrochemical feedstocks.\n\nThe range of bio-based intermediates is steadily expanding, but leading the way are bio-ethylene propylene and their polymer derivatives, bio-acrylic and adipic acids, and bio-butadiene and paraxylene.\n\nNewer bio-materials, such as bio-succinic acid and farnesene, are also attracting a lot of attention.\n\nJapanese companies active in this area include Mitsubishi Chemical and its subsidiary Mitsubishi Rayon, Toray Industries, Teijin, Mitsui & Co, Ajinomoto, Sojitz, Kuraray and Showa Denko.\n\nLate last year, Toray announced that it has produced lab-scale samples of fully bio-based polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibre, using bio-paraxylene (bio-PX) produced in the US by Gevo and commercially available renewable monoethylene glycol (MEG).\n\nThe US technology company uses biomass-derived bio-isobutanol to make the bio-PX, using conventional chemical processes, which Toray subsequently converts to terephthalic acid.\n\nThe success of the trial, says Toray, \"is proof that polyester fibre can be industrially produced from fully renewable biomass feedstock alone\". Toray is already active in the bio-polymer sector through its polylactic acid activities.\n\nIn June this year, Toray signed an offtake agreement with Gevo for bio-PX, to enable it to move to pilot-scale production of bio-PET and polyester fibre and to offer samples to business partners in 2013.\n\nAjinomoto is developing a bio-based synthetic rubber with tyre-maker Bridgestone\n\nCopyright: Bridgestone\n\nCLOTHING OPPORTUNITIES\n\nIn another initiative, Toray is working with Ajinomoto to develop and commercialise a bio-based polyamide, based on 1,5-pentanediamine (1,5-PD), which it will produce from the amino acid lysine, itself derived from plant materials by Ajinomoto using fermentation technology.\n\nThe 1,5-PD is reacted with dicarboxylic acid to produce the bio-poly amide 56, which Toray says \"is not only sustainable because it is plant based, but shows promise for highly comfortable clothing\".\n\nAjinomoto is also using its biotechnology fermentation expertise in a collaboration with tyre-maker Bridgestone. The two companies are developing bio-isoprene-based high-cis polyisoprene synthetic rubber for use in tyres.\n\nIn May they confirmed that they have successfully produced samples of the rubber. Bridgestone noted that the bio-based rubber could be \"one of the means of diversifying raw material sources for tyres and a major catalyst for achieving the group's goal of a sustainable society\". A decision on the potential for commercialisation will be taken next year, says Ajinomoto.\n\nKuraray has enhanced its renewable offering through a partnership with US-headquartered Amyris to replace petroleum-based feedstocks for polymer production. The renewable hydrocarbon building block, Biofene (farnesene), will replace conventional raw materials such as butadiene (BD) and isoprene.\n\nJapanese chemical trader and producer Sojitz is also making moves into bio-based materials. Late last year it signed an agreement with US-based Myriant to market its bio-based succinic acid in Japan, China, South Korea and Taiwan. Target sectors are plasticisers, polymers, urethanes and solvents.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Sojitz will build a commercial-scale, 150m lb/year (68,000 tonne/year) plant that will produce derivatives of bio-based succinic acid supplied by Myriant. The facility should be operational by 2015.\n\nSojitz says that: \"By gaining access to Myriant's bio-based succinic acid, we will be in a position to grow our business of green chemical derivatives.\n\nThis year, Sojitz signed an agreement with Brazil's Braskem to sell its green polyethylene produced from sugar-derived ethylene in Japan and Asia.\n\nThe Japanese company aims to be selling 20,000 tonnes/year of the material within the next three years through its Sojitz Planet subsidiary.\n\nMyriant is also supplying its bio-succinic acid to Showa Denko, in a deal signed in January this year.\n\nThe Japanese company will use the acid to make polybutylene succinate (PBS), a high-performance biodegradable polymer. It expects to use some 10,000 to 20,000 tonnes/year of the bio-derived succinic acid by the end of this year.\n\nThe PBS is made on a commercial scale at Showa Denko's Tatsuno plant in Hyogo prefecture, and sells under the tradenames Bionolle and Bionolle Starcia, when compounded with starch.\n\nShowa Denko is now providing film-grade samples of the material and test marketing to come customers, including Natur-Tek of the US.\n\nMitsui & Co has been making advances in bio-based materials on several fronts, notably in bio-succinic acid in partnership with Canada-based BioAmber, and in bio-polyethylene with Dow Chemical, in a joint project in Brazil.\n\nCOMMERCIAL SCALE\n\nThe BioAmber deal was announced in November last year and involves Mitsui & Co and BioAmber establishing a joint venture to build a commercial scale production facility in Sarnia, Canada, to go on stream in 2013. The 70:30 BioAmber/Mitsui jv will subsequently consider projects in Thailand and then Brazil or North America, so that capacity will eventually total 164,000 tonnes/year.\n\nThe Thai plant is likely to be built also in partnership with PTT MCC Biochem, a joint venture between Mitsubishi Chemical and PTT of Thailand.\n\nMitsui has been an investor in BioAmber since 2009 and has supported its growth through capital increases.\n\nIt is putting $15m (â¬12m) into the new as-yet unnamed joint venture. It has also been carrying out pre-marketing activities for bio-succinic acid in Asia.\n\nThe aim of the project joint venture is to produce cost-competitive succinic acid and to promote its use in a variety of applications, including biodegradable resins and polyurethanes. The Sarnia unit will also produce the derivative products 1,4-butanediol and tetrahydrofuran.\n\nAlso in 2011, Mitsui signed up with Dow Chemical to acquire a 50% stake in Dow's Brazilian subsidiary Santa Vitoria Acucar e Alcool (SVAA) and form a joint venture aimed at production of biopolymers, notably bio-polyethylene, made from renewable sugar-cane derived ethanol. Mitsui's initial investment is $200m.\n\nThe move, says Mitsui, will \"enhance further development of important opportunities in securing sugarcane-based resources for Mitsui's green chemical business\". In green chemicals, Mitsui's goal \"is to contribute to industry and society by securing a stable supply of renewable resources as well as by producing low environmental impact chemicals for those resources\".\n\nWhile now confirmed figures have been released, observers expect a 350,000 tonnes/year PE plant could be operation by 2015.\n\nSojitz will take bio-succinic acid from a new plant Myriant is building in Louisiana, US\n\nCopyright: RexFeatures\n\nESTABLISHING PARTNERSHIPS\n\nThe past year has also seen Mitsubishi Chemical form several strategic alliances with key players in the bio-sector.\n\nLast April, the Japanese major agreed an exclusive supply agreement with renewable firm BioAmber and its Asian distributor Mitsui & Co for bio-based succinic acid.\n\nThey also started a feasibility study for the construction of a plant alongside Mitsubishi's planned polybutylene succinate (PBS) facility in Thailand.\n\nThat same week, Mitsubishi Chemical unveiled a joint venture with US-based Genomatica to produce bio-based butanediol (BDO) and other renewable chemicals. This included plans for their first commercial bio-BDO plant in Asia, using Genomatica's technology. Mitsubishi also made an equity investment in the company as part of Genomatica's recently-announced $45m Series C-1 funding.\n\n\"Asia is the fastest-growing chemicals market in the world and we see great potential to deliver bio-based chemicals to this market as a growing complement to our current conventionally-sourced chemicals,\" said Hiroaki Ishizuka, representative director of Mitsubishi Chemical. \"We believe that a strategic partnership with Genomatica will provide market-leading economics and quality which will benefit both parties.\"\n\nIn November 2011, meanwhile, Mitsubishi Rayon and its subsidiary Lucite International announced the development of biomass as a feedstock for methyl methacrylate (MMA). Commercial production of the raw material for MMA was expected by 2016.\n\nThey aim eventually to produce 50% of their MMA monomer output using biomass.\n\nDevelopments such as those discussed above will inevitably help Japan in its goal of moving to a 20% share of bio-based polymers in overall consumption by 2020.\n\nBut the aim is wider than this, and there is scope to extend bio-based materials globally as technology advances and consumers demand more sustainable products.\n\n27 September 2013 [Source: ICB]\n\n[Source: ICB]\n\nAuthor: John Baker and Andy Brice\n\n22/10/2012Sustainable Packaging and Recycling\n\n16/10/2011The \"Jesus\" Molecule: ParaxyleneJim Lane\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company invests in Gevo, Virent and Avantium partnerships, in the race to develop renewable plastic bottling entirely from renewables.\n\nThereâs been an awful lot of press this week about progress in the search for the God particle. Thatâs the subatomic Higgs Boson â a key, but as yet undetected, anchor in the standard model of the universe.\n\nThen thereâs the Jesus molecule. As in, \"Kind lord Jesus in Heaven, grant me an affordable way to make one of those.\"\n\nItâs renewable PX, also known as your friend, paraxylene â a key, but as yet undiscovered at affordable cost, anchor in the production of plastic bottles entirely from renewables. (\"PX\" also accidentally looks not entirely unlike the Chi-Rho, one of the earliest symbols for Jesus Christ.)\n\nThatâs the story for Main Street. Hereâs the story for Wall Street. Itâs the key molecule to unlocking a global market for renewables of 54 million metric tons, and an annual trade of $100 billion.\n\nThe search for renewable PX took a new twist yesterday in New York, when the lt Coca-Cola Company turned on the klieg lights to announce multi-million dollar investment and partnership agreements with Gevo (GEVO), Virent and Avantium. The goal? To accelerate development of the first commercial solutions for its next-generation PlantBottle packaging, using renewable PX.\n\nSince introduced in 2009, the Company has already distributed more than 10 billion first-generation PlantBottle packages in 20 countries worldwide with up to 30 percent renewable content. With this announcement, Coke aims for 100 percent plant-based packaging, at scale, by mid-decade.\n\nThe goal with each of these three agreements is to ensure that the companies a) produce the materials that Coke needs, b) produce them in big quantities, and c) as soon as possible, please.\n\nCoke and its 3 renewable PET shops\n\nFrom left: Virent CEO Lee Edwards, Gevo CEO Pat Gruber, Coke VP Ron Frazier, and Avantium CEO Tom van Aken\n\nWhat is Coke plastic bottling? It is a material called PET (For you Digest purists: polyethylene terephthalate. Say that three times real fast.) For now, key in on that polyethylene, then that ethylene. Itâs a form of polyester that is see-through, and is an excellent barrier material. Not much gets through these little molecules.\n\nAccordingly, itâs become the third most widely-produced polymer in the world, after polyethylene and polypropylene. PET makes up about 20 percent of the worldâs polymer production, and about 30 percent of that PET goes into making plastic bottles.\n\nIn short, Coke and Pepsi have a big stake in a big game.\n\nOver the past few years, both companies have been working flat-out to produce a plastic bottle made entirely from renewables. Two years ago, Coke came out with its first-gen PlantBottle technology.\n\nOk, hereâs where the story will get a little technical, so grab a snack and a pencil.\n\nTo make a partially-renewable PET, Coke is using about 30 percent MEG (that is, mono-ethylene glycol), which it is making from biomass already. The other 70 percent comes from PTA (purified terephthalic acid).\n\nIn other words, MEG+PTA = plastic bottle.\n\nTo date, they still have been using traditional fossil materials for the PTA. Thatâs where Cokeâs announcement makes waves.\n\nOK, how do you make PTA from renewables?\n\nWell, to make PTA, you have to make something called paraxylene, itâs the principal precursor. In the industry, itâs known as PX. And bottle production chews up about 98 percent of global paraxylene production each year. (Read this, and then forget it: Basically, itâs a benzene ring, with a pair of methyl molecules attached to it.)\n\nWhat you need to know is that PX is a hydrocarbon.\n\nWhy not just use, say, polyethylene?\n\nGood news, Coke does, in Odwalla juice products. Works for juice in the fridge. Does not work for products outside of the fridge, especially carbonated ones.\n\nWhat about some other molecules?\n\nWell, thereâs PEF. Thatâs a new bio-plastic that Avantium makes, using its YXY chemical catalytic technology. Hence, Cokeâs interest in Avantium.\n\nFirst milestones in that agreement include the start-up of an Avantium PEF pilot plant, officially opened on December 8th in Geleen, the Netherlands. It is expected that other large co-development partners will join from early 2012.\n\nBack to the PX, then. The tip-offs.\n\nOK, turns out that, according to all of the 30 or so companies they looked at, Virent and Gevo had the best available technology (available for co-development, that is) that can make paraxylene.\n\nThatâs something that several astute Digest readers picked up at the time of Gevoâs last analyst presentation:\n\n\"Production ramp on pace. The retrofit of Gevoâs first commercial plant in Luverne remains on track for a 1H12 start-up. The 500,000 liter/year plant at the South Hampton facility should come online by year-end, initially producing jet fuel, and later, gasoline and paraxylene (for PET applications) to support certification processes. Gevo expects to receive ASTM certification for its jet fuel in 2013. Management affirmed the target of 350 million gallons in 2015, unchanged from the IPO.\"\n\nIn fact, back in March it has already announced a first paraxylene production deal.\n\nBack in July, Virent tipped its hand as well:\n\n\"Virent says that producing PET from waste such as cornstover and pine residuals is more difficult than from sugars but that it can be done. The company makes paraxylene, a PET feedstock, from sugars. Expectations are that its commercial scale facility will be online in late 2014.\"\n\nAs far back as June, Digest readers had an early tip from Avantium:\n\n\"Avantium is building a pilot plant to demonstrate its YXY technology which enables the cost effective production of Furanics building blocks for green materials and fuels. This will facilitate the development and commercialization of Avantiumâs next-generation polyester: PEFâ¦Avantium has demonstrated that PEF has numerous superior properties when compared with PET, including lower permeability of oxygen, carbon-dioxide and water and an enhanced ability to withstand heat.\"\n\nThe business case\n\nHereâs the good news, from our report last June on paraxylene and its opportunities:\n\n\"In the case of a Gevo-retrofitted plant, the biorefiner can produce biobutanol plus co-products, or paraxylene and the same co-productsâ to give one example. Turns out, in renewable fuels as well as elsewhere, it takes two (products) to tango. Pricing moves around in these volatile markets, but as a rule of thumb, paraxylene prices at around a 25 percent premium to ethanol (after taking into account the lower yields of isobutanol, per ton of feedstock). PET sells for roughly a 125 percent premium.\"\n\nBotttom line, you can make good money in this market. Things, as it turns out, do go better with Coke.\n\nWhatâs a Pepsi to do?\n\nWell, over at Pepsi they havenât tipped their hand, except that last March they declared that they had a solution in hand of their own to produce renewable PET. This week, they said they were planning a pilot run of up to 200,000 bottles using their new process, but no one is sure when this will reach commercial scale, or even if the Pepsi process will be commercially feasible.\n\nIn Cokeâs case, it is looking like 2014-15.\n\nReaction from Gevo\n\n\"We are extremely gratified to have won the confidence of The Coca-Cola Company and are excited to support Coca-Colaâs sustainable packaging goals with this agreement to develop and commercialize technology to produce paraxylene from bio-based isobutanol,\" said Patrick Gruber, CEO of Gevo. \"New technologies need champions. The Coca-Cola Company is in a unique position to drive and influence change in the global packaging supply chain with this development. You cannot ask for a better champion than one of the most respected and admired consumer brands.\"\n\nReaction from Avantium\n\n\"Our YXY solution for the packaging industry creates a new biobased plastic with exceptional functional properties at a competitive price. We believe it is economically viable and has a significantly reduced environmental footprint,\" said Tom van Aken, CEO of Avantium. \"We have produced PEF bottles with promising barrier and thermal properties and look forward to our work with Coca-Cola to further develop and commercialize PEF bottles. Our production process fits with existing supply and manufacturing chains and we are targeting commercial production in the next few years.\"\n\nDutch research and technology company Avantium has developed a patented technology YXY to produce 100%biobased PEF bottles. Currently PET is the most widely used oil-based polyester. Based on the performance of the new PEF material, Avantium believes PEF will become the next-generation biobased polyester.\n\nReaction from Virent\n\n\"The company is targeting early 2015 for the opening of its first full-scale commercial plant. Virentâs long term agreements with The Coca-Cola Company are pioneering milestones in the commercialization of our technology to produce plant-based materials\" said Virent CEO Lee Edwards. \"Our patented technology features catalytic chemistry to convert plant-based sugars into a full range of products identical to those made from petroleum, including bio-based paraxylene â a key component needed to deliver 100% plant-based PET packaging.\"\n\nReaction from Biofuels Digest\n\nIâd like to buy the world a home\n\nand make it very green\n\ngrow apple trees and honeybees\n\nto make my bottles clean\n\nIâd like to teach the world to synth\n\nin perfect laboratories\n\nIâd like to buy PX for Coke\n\nfrom these three companies.\n\nView Cocaâ Colaâs actual \"Iâd like to teach the world to sing\"commercial, in a 1970s holiday incarnation, here.\n\nThe \"Jesus\" Molecule: Paraxylene was posted on lt AltEnergyStocks.com.\n\n16/10/2011\n\nGerman scientists have found a way to create a polyester compound from bacteria, and it may chance how bioplastics are manufactured.\n\nPoly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a thermoplastic polyester which occurs naturally in bacteria as Ralstonia eutropha and\n\nBacillus megaterium.\n\nEven though PHB is biodegradable and is not dependent on fossil resources, this bioplastic has been traditionally too expensive\n\nto produce to replace petroleum-based plastics.\n\nNew research reported in BioMed Centralâs open access journalMicrobial Cell Factories describes an alternative method of producing PHB in microalgae.\n\nPHB is synthesised in bacteria from acetyl-CoA using the enzymes Ã-ketothiolase, acetoacetyl-CoA reductase and PHB\n\nsynthase. The genes coding for these proteins were inserted into a diatom (Phaeodactylum tricornutum) resulting in expression\n\nof the enzymes and synthesis of PHB in cytosolic granules. After only seven days, about 10% of the dried weight of the diatoms\n\nwas PHB.\n\nDr. Franziska Hempel and Prof Uwe Maier from the LOEWE-Centre Synmikro in Marburg, and Prof Alexander SteinbÃ¼chel from WestfÃ¤lische Wilhelms-UniversitÃ¤t, explained, âMillions of tons of petroleum-based plastic are consumed every year worldwide\n\ncausing immense amounts of waste that can take thousands of years to biodegrade â if at all.\n\nBacterial fermentation is expensive and while people have introduced a similar system into plants, plants are relatively slow\n\ngrowing and biofuel agriculture uses up valuable land. P. tricornutum needs little more than light and water to grow and can produce similar amounts of PHB to the plant systems in weeks rather than months.â\n\nIn the quest to find biodegradable and renewable sources of plastics these photosynthetic bioreactors may well provide an answer.\n\nThe article is available at www.microbialcellfactories.com\n\n10/16/2011 â ScienceDaily.comâ\n\n01/08/2011\n\nGreencol Taiwan Corporation Bio-MEG Plant, Taiwan, China\n\nKey Data\n\nProject type Bio-MEG manufacturing plant\n\nLocation Kaohsiung, Taiwan\n\nOrder year October 2010\n\nCompletion 2011\n\nCapacity 100,000tpa\n\nOwner and Operator Greencol Taiwan Corporation\n\nPartners Toyota Tsusho Corporation and Taipei-based China Man-made Fiber Corporation\n\nFull specifications\n\n________________________________________\n\nGreencol Taiwan Corporation (GTC) announced that it planned to build a new plant to manufacture bio-mono ethylene glycol\n\n(bio-MEG) in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in October 2010.\n\nThe plant will have a capacity of 100,000t per year, and is expected to be completed by the end of 2011.\n\nGTC, which will also operate the plant, is a 50:50 joint venture between Nagoya-based Toyota Tsusho Corporation (TTC) and\n\nTaipei-based China Man-made Fiber Corporation.

In the next phase, starting in 2012, Dow and Mitsui will build a\n\npolyethylene plant.\n\n\"The flexible packaging market is currently booming, not only in Brazil but throughout Latin America,\" Luis Cirihal,\n\nDow's business director for Green Alternatives and New Business Development for Latin America, told Design News.\n\n\"At the same time, consumers are increasingly turning to sustainable solutions.\n\nFor these reasons, we are certain that there is ample market demand and growth potential for biopolymers, particularly\n\nwithin the high-performance flexible packaging, hygiene, and medical markets.\"\n\nThe development is fascinating for a number of reasons, particularly because it validates a significant shift in feedstocks\n\nfrom petroleum and natural gas to renewableresources, in this case sugar.\n\nClearly, the volatility of oil pricing is a major concern long-term.\n\nThe importance of the carbon footprint argument is expected to grow, with increased awareness by consumers and\n\npotentially government regulators.\n\nMany regulatory bodies in Japan and Europe are already signaling increasing concern over the impact of hydrocarbons on\n\nclimate change.\n\nDow's involvement is noteworthy because it is one of the largest producers of plastics in the world.\n\nThe company has shifted from low-margin commodity plastics in recent years toward specialty chemicals and polymers\n\nthat command higher prices and leverage Dow's technical capabilities.\n\nThis announcement clearly signals a strong interest to stay in polyethylene, and the economics are also interesting.\n\nIn a speech at the Annual Technical Conference of the Society of Plastics Engineers in 2008, Dow executive\n\nvice president and CTO William F. Banholzer said: \"The utilization of biofuels as a primary feedstock for production of\n\ncommodity chemicals will most likely be constrained by a shortage of cropland, limited capital, and the availability of\n\nlower-cost alternatives.\n\nAbsent unforeseen technological innovations or significant government mandates, this situation is unlikely to change\n\non a wholesale basis in coming decades.\"\n\nThe comments were surprising because Dow had announced its first major project to make polyethylene\n\nfrom sugar feedstock in Brazil in 2007.\n\nThat effort later derailed because of problems at its partner, CrystalSev. The sugar-growing properties announced in\n\nthe Mitsui deal are the same properties developed for the CrystalSev JV.\n\nIn an interview after his Antec presentation, Banholzer told Design News that Dow's plan to make polyethylene\n\nfrom sugarcane in Brazil made sense because the company needed more capacity in South America, and sugar cane\n\nwas a competitive feedstock in South America.\n\nIt would be interesting to see Dow's projections of the economics today. In 2008, Bahnholzer said: \"For corn ethanol\n\nto compete with Middle East ethane on an energy basis, it would have to sell for a mere $0.15/gal.\n\nEthanol from corn costs about $1.74 per gallon to produce.\" No data is available on what the cost will be for sugar\n\nethanol produced in Brazil.\n\nAccording to the Soybean and Corn Adviser, the average price of ethanol in Brazil at the pump is R$2.22 per liter,\n\nor approximately $5.27 per gallon.\n\nDow's cost, of course, would be less because there are no distribution costs and no middlemen.\n\nPlastics made from the Dow-Mitsui plant will be chemically identical to plastics made from hydrocarbon feedstocks.\n\nThey will not be biodegradable.\n\nPlastic soda bottles made from sugar-derived polyester are already making a big splash, with the key players being\n\nBraskem and Coca-Cola.\n\nMost bioplastics made in the US are polymerized from corn and have chemical properties different from well-known types\n\nof plastics.\n\n15/03/2011\n\nPepsiCo Develops World's First 100 Percent Plant-Based, Renewably Sourced\n\nPETBottle\n\nBuilding upon its heritage as an innovator and leader in environmental sustainability, PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) today announced\n\nit has developed the world's first PET plastic bottle made entirely from plant-based, fully renewable resources, enabling the\n\ncompany to manufacture a beverage container with a significantly reduced carbon footprint.\n\nPepsiCo's \"green\" bottle is 100 percent recyclable and far surpasses existing industry technologies. The bottle is made from\n\nbio-based raw materials, including switch grass, pine bark and corn husks. In the future, the company expects to broaden the renewable sources used to create the \"green\" bottle to include orange peels, potato peels, oat hulls and other agricultural\n\nbyproducts from its foods business. This process further reinforces PepsiCo's \"Power of One\" advantage by driving a strategic beverage innovation via a food-based solution.\n\n\"This breakthrough innovation is a transformational development for PepsiCo and the beverage industry, and a direct result of our commitment to research and development,\" said PepsiCo Chairman and CEO, Indra Nooyi. \"PepsiCo is in a unique position, as\n\none of the world's largest food and beverage businesses, to ultimately source agricultural byproducts from our foods business to manufacture a more environmentally-preferable bottle for our beverages business â a sustainable business model that we believe brings to life the essence of Performance with Purpose.\"\n\nCombining biological and chemical processes, PepsiCo has identified methods to create a molecular structure that is identical\n\nto petroleum-based PET (polyethylene terephthalate), which results in a bottle that looks, feels and protects its product identically to existing PET beverage containers.\n\nPepsiCo will pilot production of the new bottle in 2012. Upon successful completion of the pilot, the company intends to move directly to full-scale commercialization.\n\n\"As You Sow applauds PepsiCo's innovative packaging design,\" said Conrad Mackerron, Senior Program Director of As You Sow, a San Francisco-based foundation, which promotes corporate social responsibility through shareholder engagement. \"By reducing reliance on petroleum-based materials and using its own agricultural scraps as feedstock for new bottles, this advancement should deliver a double win for the environment and PepsiCo.\"\n\nWith this development, PepsiCo continues its leadership position in environmental sustainability and driving progress against\n\nthe global goals and commitments it announced in 2010 to protect the Earth's natural resources through innovation and more\n\nefficient use of land, energy, water and packaging.

Methane gas is still produced by steam cracking, a high-temperature, energy-intensive and expensive industrial process first developed in the 19th century. In this process, hydrocarbons found in crude oil are broken down into a range of simpler chemical compounds. The search for more efficient, less expensive approaches to the production of ethylene has gone on for more than three decades, and although some progress has been made no new techniques have yet proved commercially viable.\n\nNow a small group of researchers at Siluria Technologies, a Silicon Valley startup is reporting progress in commercializing a nanoscience-based approach to ethylene production. Their technique for producing ethylene depends on the ability of a genetically engineered virus to coat itself with a metal that serves as a catalyst for an ethylene producing chemical reaction.\n\nThe key is that the virus can create a \"tangle of catalyst coated nanowires - the researchers call it a hairball - that provide so much surface area for chemical reactions to occur that the energy needed to produce the reactions is much reduced. The basic process, or chemical reaction, known as oxidative coupling of methane, was an area of intense research for the petrochemical industry beginning in the late 1980s.\n\nResearchers had some success but never achieved enough of an improvement in energy efficiency to justify displacing the traditional steam-cracking process. With its hairballs of virus-created nanowires coated with unspecified metals, Siluria has been able to create ethylene-producing reactions at temperatures 200 to 300 degrees lower than previously achieved, said Erik Scher, a chemist who is one of the company's researchers.\n\nThe company won't say specifically what the coating is, but say that magnesium oxide is an example of the kind of metals involved. The work is based on a technique for genetically engineering viruses pioneered by Angela Belcher, who leads the Biomolecular Materials Group at MIT.\n\nThe technique involves manipulating the genes of a virus, in this case one that usually attacks bacteria, so that it will collect and coat itself with inorganic materials, like metals and even carbon nanotubes. The viruses can be used to create a dense tangle of metal nanowires, and the potential applications for these engineered materials are remarkably diverse. Dr. Belcher's lab is busy with research on more efficient batteries and solar cells, biofuels, hydrogen separation and other fuel cell technologies, CO2 sequestration, cancer diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, as well as an effort to create a catalyst that can convert ethanol to hydrogen at room temperature.\n\nIn contrast, the Siluria researchers said their advance in developing catalysts is the most significant step yet toward commercialization of the bacteriophage technique. \"We are learning from nature, but going to new places in the periodic table and working with the same tools and techniques to use materials that nature has not worked with,\" said Alex Tkachenko, a molecular biologist who is a co-founder of Siluria. The researchers acknowledged that they do not yet have a complete scientific understanding of the surface behavior of their new catalyst.\n\n01/06/2010\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\nOnwards and upwards with bio products Growth in bioplastics despite crisis; industry remains optimistic\n\nBerlin - 1 June 2010 - Green investments are the best way to beat the crisis - a sum- mary of the findings of a poll conducted by the European Bioplastics Association of its members. The bulk of companies questioned reported healthy growth figures for 2009, in some cases considerably more than 5% up on the previous year. The figures fulfilled\n\n- and sometimes exceeded - expectations. In May, 38 companies, among them many world leaders in polymer manufacture, revealed how they had fared in 2009 and voiced their expectations for the current year and 2011.\n\n47% of companies recorded growth in turnover, while another 32% managed to at least draw level and only 10% of companies posted losses. 70% of those polled had their expectations confirmed, as against a quarter of firms questioned who were not able to live up to their own forecast. Companies see a positive trend overall for both this year and the year to come: in all, 80% of those polled were optimistic, with 20% anticipating satisfactory results, 40% good results and 20% excellent results. Based on these healthy expectations, two thirds of the companies will be increasing their investment in the sector this year.\n\nBiodegradability and the bio-based component are what distinguish bioplastics from con- ventional plastics. Many applications, - packaging materials, mulch films, shopping bags and others - are both biodegradable and bio-based products. Bioplastics are also increasingly used in durable products, providing the material for cell phone housings, car parts and many other products. In this way the carbon derived from the carbon dioxide taken in by plants is re- moved from the atmosphere for a period of years. Climate protection and reduced consump- tion of fossil fuels are important drivers of technological improvements and market evolution. The advantages of biodegradability are particularly evident in products with a short life-span.\n\n\"This is a clear indication of the strength of green innovation and the companies driving it forward,\" says Andy Sweetman, Chairman of the European Bioplastics board. With a market share of less than one percent, bioplastics still represent a niche product, despite generally high rates of growth. \"What is missing are incentives from an effective stimulus programme to boost the market,\" adds Harald Kaeb, political consultant to the Association. \"Then com- panies would be better placed to finance their innovations and the necessary expansion in capacity.\" It would also give a strong signal to both large plastics users and consumers. The sector is ready to expand further.\n\nSee graphs on the next pages.\n\nEuropean Bioplastics is the European association representing the interests of the industry along the complete bioplastics' value chain. Its members produce, refine and distribute bioplastics i.e. plastics that are either bio-based, compostable, or both.\n\nMore information is available at http://www.conference.european-bioplastics.org\n\n:\n\n.\n\nTel: +49 (0) 30 28482 356, Fax: +49 (0)30 284 82 359, presse@european-bioplastics.org\n\nANNEXE\n\nDid the year 2009 met, exceeded or failed your expectations?\n\nHow did the year 2009 compared to the year 2008 with regard to the development of turnover?\n\nTel: +49 (0) 30 28482 356, Fax: +49 (0)30 284 82 359, presse@european-bioplastics.org\n\nFor the year 2010, do you expect investments of your company to:\n\nPress Contact: page 3/3\n\nMelanie Gentzik, Head of Communications, European Bioplastics, Marienstr. 19/20, 10117 Berlin, Tel: +49 (0) 30 28482 356, Fax: +49 (0)30 284 82 359, presse@european-bioplastics.org\n\n13/05/2010\n\nSorona apparel biz grows 300% in last two years, Dupont\n\nMay 2010 (USA)\n\nDuPont is executing a rapid commercialization strategy in its Applied BioSciences business for a diverse portfolio of high-performance, renewable products that address the needs of large markets, DuPont leaders told security analysts and investors.

The company has appointed Dennis McGrew as executive vice president of business development and chief business officer, and Joseph Kuterbach as the vice president of operations, engineering and technology transfer. Both executives join at a critical juncture for the company, following the initial close of a $15 million fundraising round and just before the rapid scale-up of its flagship manufacturing process.\n\nMcGrew and Kuterbach join the executive team, which includes founder and CEO Christophe Schilling and Chief Technology Officer Mark Burk. Both McGrew and Kuterbach bring decades of direct chemical industry experience and relationships to their newly appointed roles. Most recently, McGrew served as president and CEO of NatureWorks, the global leader in bio-plastics, which he joined after a series of commercial executive roles at Dow Chemical, while Kuterbach is a career veteran of Lyondell Basell where he was most recently the manager of process engineering for butanediol, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and acetyls.\n\n\"With an executive team of this caliber, Genomatica is poised to lead the market in commercializing sustainable chemicals,\" said Patrick McCroskey, principal at TPG Biotech and member of Genomatica's board of directors. \"Since co-founding the company, Christophe Schilling has guided the team through successive milestones to perfect the platform while Mark Burk has achieved rapid success producing BDO\n\nand other chemicals on the way. Combined with industry veteran board members William Baum, Warren Clark, and Robert Pangborn, the additions of Dennis McGrew and Joseph Kuterbach provide Genomatica with extensive chemical market expertise and foresight. The team's combined network of industry relationships has driven considerable interest in the 'sustainable chemicals' vision that Genomatica is bringing to market.\"\n\n\"Dennis McGrew and Joseph Kuterbach bring decades of direct experience in Genomatica's target markets each with substantial careers with two of the largest chemical companies in the world,\" said Christophe Schilling, president and CEO of Genomatica. \"They are vital assets to the leadership team and to the company's vision of commercializing bio-based BDO and other sustainable chemicals.\"\n\nGenomatica has begun the commercialization process of 1,4-butanediol ( BDO ) , a key raw material in the manufacturing of hundreds of plastic, rubber and fiber products. BDO has a worldwide annual production value estimated at more than $4 billion across the automotive, textile and consumer goods industries.\n\nMcGrew's primary focus with Genomatica will be developing commercial partnerships and strategic relationships to bring Genomatica's bio-manufacturing processes to commercial scale. He will focus on three types of customers: existing producers of BDO or other chemical intermediates, sugar producers or other upstream suppliers of low-cost feedstocks, and large consumers of BDO and its derivatives or other chemical intermediates, including fibers manufacturers, and plastic resin suppliers. McGrew will also look to facilitate relationships throughout supply chains to bring low-cost, performance-equivalent bio-based chemical intermediates to market.\n\nMcGrew served as CEO of NatureWorks from 2006 to 2008, attracting a new investor and securing capital to double its production capacity to 300 million pounds per year. From April 2004 to January 2006, McGrew served as NatureWorks' vice president and chief marketing officer, gaining significant market traction by leading global commercial efforts for NatureWorks PLA packaging and Ingeo ( TM ) fibers, environmentally beneficial replacements for petroleum-based materials. He has more than two decades of sales, marketing and business development experience. McGrew served as Dow Chemical's global commercial director for the Engineering Plastics business and commercial director for Dow Automotive Europe. He joined Dow in 1983 as a sales representative, and during his 20 year career with Dow, he held numerous sales, product management, marketing and business development roles with the organization.\n\nKuterbach has established himself as a 30-year veteran of the chemical industry with extensive management and process design, engineering, and operations experience. As Genomatica's vice president of operations,\n\nengineering and technology transfer, he will be responsible for driving the demonstration plant scale-up of\n\nBDO and commercial scale-up of the technology with future customer-partners.\n\nWhile at Lyondell Basell, Kuterbach was a recognized engineering leader having managed teams of process engineers, providing technical support, and driving capital expansions to the ethylene oxide plant, acetic acid and BDO units in Texas, as well as the propylene oxide plants in Texas, France, and the Netherlands. Kuterbach brings direct experience in the development of novel process technologies for chemicals such as\n\nBDO, having managed a newly constructed BDO unit in the Netherlands, and provided the process design for the plant, along with transferring technical knowledge to the local staff and offering start-up support. His leadership and effort to troubleshoot operating problems and include technology improvements in the design of the new BDO unit resulted in a capital cost reduction of 10 percent.\n\nAbout Genomatica\n\nGenomatica is a sustainable chemicals company developing groundbreaking technologies to transform chemical production processes through bio-manufacturing.

The VinÃ§otte OK biobased certification meets the ASTM D6866 standard for determining the renewable/biobased carbon content of products.\n\nThe certification recognizes four levels of renewable carbon content: one star for content comprised of between 20 to 40 percent biobased carbon, two stars for 40 to 60 percent, three stars for 60 to 80 percent, and four stars awarded for more than 80 percent biobased carbon content. According to the test, NatureWorks Ingeo plastic resin is made from 99 percent renewable plant sugars - that is, renewable carbon. (In actuality, all of the carbon is biobased, but 99% reflects the accuracy of the test.) Every grade of Ingeo resin 40 in all received the four-star certification.\n\n\"We are proud to announce the first OK biobased certificates, and we congratulate NatureWorks on its across-the-board four-star rating,\" said Petra Michiels, contract manager for OK biobased. \"With the Ingeo resins now certified, the four-star rating can be used as the foundation for downstream products, earning them an OK biobased rating.\"\n\n\"The OK biobased star rating serves as a sustainability indicator for consumers by identifying materials and products that are helping to alleviate the environmental problems associated with fossil fuels and greenhouse gases,\" said Steve Davies, director of corporate communications and public affairs, NatureWorks. \"Symbols on packages and products relating to the environment, such as the OK biobased stars, inform and influence consumer buying decisions.

This makes Rhodia the first company to overcome three frequent obstacles to the recycled products market:\n\n\" its supply is guaranteed by sustainable sources provided by its partners\n\n\" the consistent quality of its recycled products is guaranteed, and finally\n\n\" long-term economic viability is ensured.\n\nOther advantages of 4earthâ¢ products include their technical competitiveness with non-recycled products and their environmental benefits, which are duly measured on a case by case basis by the Life Cycle Assessment method.\n\nSeveral 4earthâ¢ programs have already been agreed with key players from various industries such as automotive and sports.\n\n18/02/2010\n\nVerdezyne Produces Adipic Acid Biologically\n\nCARLSBAD, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Verdezyne, Inc., a privately-held synthetic biology company developing processes for renewable chemicals and fuels, today announced they are developing a new fermentation process for the production of adipic acid.\n\nVerdezyne achieved proof of concept in this development program by demonstrating production and recovery of adipic acid by a yeast microorganism from an alkane feedstock. Using proprietary technologies, Verdezyne discovered and is engineering a proprietary metabolic pathway that can utilize sugar, plant-based oils or alkanes.\n\nThis is Verdezyne's first major milestone towards demonstrating an entirely feedstock flexible fermentation process for the production of bio-based adipic acid. The benefit of a feedstock flexible process is the ability to maintain a sustainable cost advantage regardless of future energy volatility. In addition to cost advantages, Verdezyne's fermentation process will reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to the traditional petrochemical production of adipic acid.\n\n\"Our estimates indicate at least a 20% cost of manufacturing advantage for bio-based adipic acid depending on the feedstock selected,\" stated E. William Radany, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer, Verdezyne. \"Rising consumer interest in bio-based products combined with a sustainable cost advantage makes Verdezyne's adipic acid process a compelling proposition for future production.\"\n\nVerdezyne is engineering the metabolic pathway to boost organism performance at lab scale and intends to partner for scale-up demonstration in the next year. In parallel, Verdezyne continues to make metabolic pathway improvements to utilize renewable feedstocks such as sugar.\n\n\"The petrochemical industry is looking for a cost-efficient alternative to produce this valuable chemical and we are thrilled that Verdezyne's platform is demonstrating considerable promise for commercialization of bio-based adipic acid,\" says Stephen Picataggio, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer, Verdezyne.\n\nThe global adipic acid market was approximately $4.9 billion in 2009 with its two major applications being polyamides and polyurethanes. Adipic acid is an important engineering resin for well-established markets like automotive, footwear, and construction and is used in everyday products such as carpets, coatings, furniture, bedding and automobile parts\n\n.\n\nVerdezyne's Platform Technology\n\nVerdezyne's novel combinatorial approach to pathway engineering rapidly creates and harnesses genetic diversity to optimize a metabolic pathway. The company's unique computational and synthetic biology toolbox allows effective design, synthesis and expression of synthetic genes in a heterologous recombinant microorganism. Rather than manipulating one pathway gene at a time, the company uses synthetic gene libraries to introduce diversity into each pathway gene. Combinatorial assembly of multiple pathway genes introduces enzymatic diversity into a metabolic pathway, and biological selection or high-throughput screening identifies the most productive combination of pathway genes.\n\nAbout Verdezyne\n\nFounded in 2005, Verdezyne, formerly known as CODA Genomics, is a privately-held company that integrates its proprietary core technologies to direct the evolution of novel metabolic pathways for cost-effective commercial production of biofuels and platform chemicals. Investors in Verdezyne include OVP Venture Partners, Monitor Ventures, Tech Coast Angels and Life Science Angels.

First application is on the 2010 Ford Flexâs third-row interior storage bins. This application alone reduces petroleum usage by some 20,000 pounds per year, reduces CO2 emissions by 30,000 pounds per year, and represents a sustainable usage for wheat straw, the waste byproduct of wheat.\n\nFord researchers were approached with the wheat straw-based plastics formulation by the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, as part of the Ontario BioCar Initiativeâa multi-university effort between Waterloo, the University of Guelph, University of Toronto and University of Windsor. Ford works closely with the Ontario government-funded project, which is seeking to advance the use of more plant-based materials in the auto and agricultural industries.\n\n<!ââ>The wheat straw-reinforced resin is the BioCar Initiativeâs first production-ready application. It demonstrates better dimensional integrity than a non-reinforced plastic and weighs up to 10% less than a plastic reinforced with talc or glass.\n\nWithout Fordâs driving force and contribution, we would have never been able to move from academia to industry in such lightning speed. Seeing this go into production on the Ford Flex is a major accomplishment for the University of Waterloo and the BioCar Initiative.\n\nâLeonardo Simon, associate professor of chemical engineering at the University of Waterloo\n\nThe University of Waterloo already had been working with plastics supplier A. Schulman of Akron, Ohio, to perfect the lab formula for use in auto parts, ensuring the material is not only odorless, but also meets industry standards for thermal expansion and degradation, rigidity, moisture absorption and fogging. Less than 18 months after the initial presentation was made to Fordâs Biomaterials Group, the wheat straw-reinforced plastic was refined and approved for Flex, which is produced at Fordâs Oakville (Ontario) Assembly Complex.\n\nAn interior storage bin may seem like a small start, but it opens the door for more applications, said Dr. Ellen Lee, technical expert, Fordâs Plastics Research. Lee said that Ford sees a great deal of potential for other applications since wheat straw has good mechanical properties, can meet our performance and durability specifications, and can further reduce its carbon footprint. Already under consideration by the Ford team: center console bins and trays, interior air register and door trim panel components, and armrest liners.\n\nThe case for using wheat straw to reinforce plast"
