At that time, steam was a key means of propulsion in industry. Vinçotte soon extended his work to other machines.\n\n1890\n\nIn 1890, Henri Adan founded the AIB (Association des Industriels de Belgique). The company’s objectives included research into accident prevention and the implementation of related workplace measures. The AIB activities thus both competed with and complemented those of Vinçotte.\n\nThe 1930’s\n\nIn 1938, Vinçotte started performing radiographic tests on pressure vessels and other pressurised containers.\n\nThe 1940’s\n\nWhen the General Occupational Safety and Health Regulation was drawn up in 1947, AIB and Vinçotte already had extensive experience in the health & safety and inspection field, resulting in the competent ministers accrediting them to oversee the correct application of most of its provisions.\n\nThe 1960’s\n\nIn the 1960s, AIB organised the first international congresses on the non-destructive testing of materials and on workplace health & safety. At that time, Vinçotte was mainly active in the fields of lifting equipment and electricity.\n\nThe 1980’s\n\nOn 29 August 1986, the companies signed an association agreement, with the new association operating under the name AIBLUX asbl. Internationally, AIB and Vinçotte continued to expand, becoming global players in the field of health & safety. In 1989, the two companies merged.\n\nThe 1990’s\n\nAIBLUX became AIB Vinçotte Luxembourg asbl in 1990.\n\n2004\n\nAIB Vinçotte became Vinçotte.\n\n2023\n\nVinçotte Luxembourg now has 100 employees working side by side with our customers and partners. Together with more than 10,000 engineers and specialists belonging to the Vinçotte & Kiwa Group, they are committed to protecting the environment, safety and quality."
