        "text": "Private individuals and liberal professions have been able to easily order their domestic inspection on our Vinçotte Home website (https://lnkd.in/dMnMnrdk) for a while now. Since recently, this can be done even faster and more efficiently thanks to the possibility of online payment with Bancontact, Visa and Mastercard! Powered by POM (Peace of Mind).\n\nLast week, the latest meeting of the ASME NQA (Nuclear Quality Assurance) international working group Europe, Middle-East & Africa took place in the offices of Vinçotte in Belgium. The working group, including Vinçotte experts, discussed many topics, such as use of ASME codes & standards at Barakah nuclear power plants in the UAE, the safety guide on ageing for the study of the life time extension of Belgian nuclear power plants, cybersecurity and a variety of other subjects. Read more about it in our new blog! https://lnkd.in/ebkNf295 #nuclearindustry #nuclearsafety #nuclearsecurity #qualityassurance\n\nWe are happy to announce that as of this week, Vinçotte has been appointed as a certified body for nuclear inspections in the Netherlands. This means that Vinçotte is now authorised to carry out inspections of nuclear pressure equipment in all phases of the inspection process, from design to commissioning and use in The Netherlands. As we are already recognised by the Belgian and French authorities, this designation by The Netherlands once again confirms our expertise and experience in this field. Read more about what it means here: https://lnkd.in/eWKyrvuD #nuclearsafety #nuclearsecurity #certifiedbody\n\nRecently, we took on the challenge of checking the Borealis flare pipe in the Port of Antwerp. Thanks to MRT, Magnetic Rope Testing, the 39m high tether cable attached to the flare pipe could be checked efficiently and safely. Read all about it in our new case study. https://lnkd.in/eBxG3HJ9 #MagneticRopeTesting #MRT #NDT #NonDestructiveTesting #Inspection\n\nJust before the start of the Summer holidays, we got invited to the Innoptus Solar Team 'Race to South Africa' partner event. A bright sunny day where we learned more about the history of the team, the upcoming challenge and a chance to see the solar car in action. Soon the car will be leaving for South Africa! Good luck to Innoptus. Let's hope the upgraded Infinite car can go for gold again!\n\nHard to believe it was already a week ago that Innoptus Solar Team invited us to their partner event to unveil the upgraded Infinite solar car in preparation of the Sasol Solar Challenge in South Africa later this year. It was great to hear about the solar team's history and to see the car and its pit crew in action (Tire change in under 1 minute!) Thanks for the invite Innoptus Solar Team. Looking forward to seeing you win the 2024 race.\n\nAvoid your company having to go back to pen and paper, due to a cyber attack.
