        "text": "The proposed paper offers a preliminary comparative study of the construction and afterlife of four war memorials that were erected, or initiated at least, by different Belgian war veterans’ associations, reflecting different nationalisms that had slumbered in the trenches of the Belgian front of the First World War. The Belgenmonument in Amersfoort in the Netherlands was built as a job-creating and learning project for interned Belgian soldiers in the Netherlands towards the end of the war. It wanted to express the gratitude of the Belgian nation towards the Dutch people for taking in refugees during the war, but became subject to a diplomatic riot between both nations after the Armistice and was not inaugurated before 1938. The IJzertoren memorial (1925-1930) in Dixmude, a crowdfunded private memorial constructed by Flemish nationalist veterans, evolved into an ambiguous and divisive symbol already during its construction process, and reflected growing tensions between regionalist and belgicist factions in the interwar years. It’s entanglement with collaborationism during the Second World War ultimately lead to its destruction in 1946, and its reconstruction between 1952-1965. The Albert I gedenkteken (1938) in Nieuport, initiated by the National Belgian Veterans Association, was heralded as Belgium’s official memorial but never came close to fulfilling that role. Finally, the Mémorial Interallié (1925-1938) in Liège-Cointe was to represent international solidarity and reconciliation between all former belligerents, but failed to include the defeated nations and instead developed into a memorial of the victorious. It was erected on a symbolic location by diverse international veterans associations. Looking into neutrality, regionalism, nationalism, and internationalism, a quick-scan of these four memorials illustrates the diversified political landscape of the interwar years that had emerged in circles of war veterans, and hints towards the divisive nature of post-war commemoration, which would resonate until deep into 20th-century society. Furthermore, this study unveils the until now underexposed agency of war veteran associations within the material and memorial culture of the First Word War.\n\nAs the start of the centenary commemoration of the First World War (wwi) in 2014 drew closer, Belgium saw the rise of a bigger ‘commemorative competition’. The different governments launched their own commemorative programmes, parallel to (and sometimes against) each other. In the slipstream of this, a huge commercial and business competition erupted in a struggle for funding and visitors. There was also an unprecedented funding of new academic wwi-research. This contribution first makes some remarks on this research, and then looks briefly at the commemorative and memorial policies. On the one hand, current wwi policies confirm (and reinforce) the differences in similar policies related to the Second World War. The narratives, as well as the moral or didactic categories, are clearly distinct. On the other hand however, there are some similarities to be found in the policy frameworks created after 1995. Some characteristics of such policy mechanisms are a more pro-active role (national) authorities adopt in the construction of memories, a strong interconnectedness between public and private interests and an underlying driving meta-narrative of a national duty to remember connected to the target of an emotional and active investment of each individual citizen.

By focusing on how a group reacts to some monuments that honor the dead and recall the trauma, I hope to have a look at the complicated psychology that exists between large groups. This may tell us not to make the concepts of “apology” or “forgiveness” magical tools in international relationships without first considering the slow and complicated mourning processes associated with them.\n\nDavid Lowenthal has observed that in today’s museums, “nothing seems too horrendous to commemorate” (Lowenthal 1985). Yet museums frequently portray a sanitised version of warfare. The twentieth century saw the development of commemorative traditions: customs and narratives by which individuals, groups and nations remember, commemorate and attempt to resolve memories of the traumatic experience that is war. These conventions often also govern museum interpretation of war. This dissertation examines the representation of war in two very different museums: Britain’s national Imperial War Museum, and the regional In Flanders Fields Museum at Ypres, Belgium. The Imperial War Museum tends to follow established commemorative traditions. In its recently-opened Holocaust exhibition, however, it has made use of a different style of commemoration. In Flanders Fields has consciously attempted to avoid traditional forms of commemoration, which could be seen as glamorising or sanitising war. This museum focuses on the experiences of individual soldiers of all nations, and tells visitors that they must learn from the First World War to work for peace. “They shall not grow old, As we that are left grow old: Age shall not weary them, Nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun And in the morning We will remember them.” – Laurence Binyon (1869-1943)"
