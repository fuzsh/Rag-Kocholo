In 1880, Vinçotte made a portrait of King Leopold II. This work earned him the friendship of the sovereign and numerous official commissions. After a period of reflection, in 1882/83, he specialised in the execution of busts of personalities from the good society that he assiduously frequented. His portraits have often been compared to those of 18th century France, particularly in the way they treat folds and draperies. In 1889, he presented a head of expression at the Ghent Salon that distanced himself from his more mundane production. Here Vinçotte proved to be more original and more personal than in other aspects of his work. Deep-set eyes, a face with energetic features and a certain arrogance in the carriage of the head characterise this fantasy bust. In front of this haughty face, a critic wrote "it looks like Catilina's head", since then the sculpture bears this title.
