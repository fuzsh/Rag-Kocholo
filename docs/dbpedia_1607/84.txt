The geomagnetic storm has turned on another light show, with aurora australis and borealis dancing across the night skies in the southern and northern hemispheres on Saturday evening.

Amateur and professional photographers flocked to beaches and other vantage points to capture the spectacular colours. Many commented they had never before seen anything like it.

"Words just cannot express what I've experienced today with my daughter," one user wrote on social media.

Others called it "a sight for the ages", or said: "I have seen things tonight that have blown my mind."

Most agreed it was "spectacular", "beautiful", or simply "stunning".

Here's what you need to know about the aurora australis southern lights show

The aurora australis was seen much further north than usual, with sightings reported from Mackay in Queensland.

While it was much more vivid away from city lights, the aurora was also visible to the naked eye in suburban areas.

Sydneysider Robin Moon dropped everything and flew to Tasmania to experience the southern lights.

"The flight landed at five o'clock which was right on sunset," she told ABC Radio Hobart.

Ms Moon drove to a nearby beach which she said was filling up with people keen to see the aurora.

"Normally if it's strong you can just see white beams with the naked eye, but on that beach we could see red and greens and not just side on â€¦ the whole sky was going red."

This is what the aurora australis looked like across the country.
