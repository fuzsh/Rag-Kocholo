        "text": "Finding the Metro Station\n\nIf you're driving, look for the large Metro signs to direct you to stations.\n\nLook for tall brown columns with a large \"M\" identifying the station entrances. Colored stripes around the column show which lines serve the station.\n\nView the Metrorail System Map.\n\nGet detailed information about a particular Metro station.\n\nWhat's the Fare?\n\nTo determine the fare between two stations, visit your starting station's page and use the Metrorail Fares fare finder in the middle of the page. For fares on trips that involve trains and buses, use our Trip Planner. SmarTrip® card users get the lowest fares.

If the train is full, step back and wait for the next train. Unlike elevator doors, train doors do not reopen automatically.\n\nExiting the Train and Station\n\nUse the same farecard you used to enter the system when you exit the system.\n\nRules\n\nSee a list of Metro rules and manners for riding smart on Metrorail.\n\nRail Station Schedules/Hours\n\nFirst and last trains vary per station.
