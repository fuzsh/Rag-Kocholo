        "text": "An extreme geomagnetic storm sent the Northern Lights as far south as Central Florida on Friday night.\n\nThe rare G5 geomagnetic storm is the first to impact earth since 2003.\n\nDuring that event, power outages were observed in Sweden, and transformers were damaged in South Africa. The Northern Lights were also seen in the southern United States.\n\n[HAVE ANY PHOTOS OF THE NORTHERN LIGHTS IN FLORIDA? SHARE THEM WITH NEWS 6 ON OUR PINIT PAGE!]\n\nNOAA officials announced that several coronal mass ejections (CMEs) — eruptions of plasma and magnetic field from the Sun — are expected to continue through the weekend.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the source has mostly been a large, complex sunspot cluster that is 17 times the diameter of Earth. Additional activity from this region is still expected.\n\nThese solar winds can significantly disturb Earth’s magnetic field, producing Aurora Borealis (i.e. “Northern Lights”) around the poles.\n\nAnd thanks to the strength of this geomagnetic storm, the lights are expected to be seen far more south than usual.\n\nCAN I WATCH THEM FROM FLORIDA?\n\nIf the Aurora were to materialize in Central Florida with the current storm, it would likely be red and very low on the horizon.\n\nWhile there is no guarantee the Northern Lights will be seen in Central Florida, hopeful sky watchers should allow 15 minutes for their eyes to adjust to the darkness.\n\nLook north and low on the horizon.\n\nA planetary K index of 9 is needed to catch glimpse in Florida. That value has been reached and is expected to continue through Saturday morning.\n\nWHEN WILL THEY HAPPEN?\n\nA G5 geomagnetic storm was observed just before 7 p.m. Friday , growing stronger through the early hours of Saturday before dipping back down again by Sunday morning.\n\nHowever, the best time to view the aurora usually falls between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m., the institute’s report shows.\n\nIS THERE ANYTHING I SHOULD WORRY ABOUT?\n\nAccording to the SWPC, the geomagnetic storm that causes these Northern Lights could impact communication infrastructure.\n\nThis infrastructure includes:\n\nelectric power grids\n\nnavigation (i.e. GPS-based apps)\n\nradio\n\nsatellite operations\n\nspacecraft\n\nHowever, the storm could also impact everyday appliances, such as microwaves, stoves or dishwashers.\n\n“It’s the computer inside that you don’t want to fry if there’s a power surge,” said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers.\n\nMyers recommends turning off the breakers to those types of appliances rather than unplugging them."
