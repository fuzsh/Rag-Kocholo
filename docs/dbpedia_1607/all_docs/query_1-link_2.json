        "text": "How auroras form\n\nThe Sun blasts charged particles (electrons and protons) into space, which is called the solar wind. Earth's magnetic field forms an invisible shield that redirects the solar wind around our planet.\n\nAs Earth's magnetic field protects us from the solar wind, the magnetic field lines are dragged and stretched. They snap back like an elastic band, launching charged particles down towards Earth's surface along the magnetic field lines.\n\nAuroras occur when these charged particles launched along Earth's magnetic field collide with gases in Earth's upper atmosphere.\n\nThose collisions produce tiny flashes that fill the sky with colourful light. This light works the same way as a neon lamp or an old cathode ray tube television set. As billions of flashes occur in sequence, the auroras appear to move or \"dance\" in the sky.\n\nAuroras can be seen almost every night in the northern sky, from August to May. We see auroras in northern Canada because of how space connects down to the ground. The part of space where most of the \"dragging, stretching, and snapping\" happens is connected by magnetic fields down to the north and south ends of Earth. Because of the shape of Earth's magnetic field, these magnetic field lines create two ovals of aurora around the North and South Poles.\n\nAs a rule, auroras are:\n\nmost common around the spring and fall equinoxes\n\neasier to see in the winter than in the summer because the winter night sky is darker\n\nAlso, the more active the Sun is:\n\nthe more stunning the auroras will appear on Earth\n\nthe further south that the oval positioned above northern Canada will stretch\n\nDuring active conditions auroras are visible across Canada, and in parts of the United States! When solar activity decreases, the oval returns to its normal position and the auroras become less intense."
