        "text": "About the Northern Lights Express\n\nThe Northern Lights Express (NLX) is a proposed passenger train between Minneapolis and Duluth, making four round trips each day. It will also stop in Coon Rapids, Cambridge, Hinckley, and Superior, WI.\n\nThe train will operate at speeds up to 90 miles per hour. A one-way trip between the Twin Cities and Twin Ports will take about 2Â½ hours. This is comparable to driving. It may be faster during rush hour and in bad weather.\n\nTrains will run on tracks owned by BNSF Railway.\n\nNews release (Dec. 8, 2023): MnDOT receives federal funds to move forward with Northern Lights Express planning\n\nView our frequently asked questions.\n\nRidership\n\nAbout 700,00 to 750,000 people are projected to ride the train the first year. In 20 years, it is estimated that ridership will be about 1 million per year. These numbers consider how likely someone is to take the train instead of driving. Factors include age, gender, car ownership, cost of gas and reason for travel.\n\nCosts\n\nConstruction cost\n\nThe estimated cost for construction is $592.3 million. This includes final design work, track and signal upgrades to accommodate higher train speeds, new and longer sidings to improve traffic flow, grade crossing improvements to increase safety, new train stations and the expansion of existing stations. The Federal Railroad Administration and MnDOT will share the construction cost:\n\nFederal (80%)\n\nState (20%)\n\nAnnual operating cost\n\nThe estimated annual operating cost is $18.9 million.\n\nDuring the first few years of service, revenue from rider fares will average about $12 million per year and should increase over time. Other Midwest regional trains offering three or more round trips per day cover about 75% of their operating costs.\n\nThe $12 million from rider fares will cover about 63% of the operating costs. The State of Minnesota will fund the rest of the operating costs, about $6.9 million. Federal grants are available to help pay for the first six years of operation. This will help reduce the cost to Minnesota while ridership grows.\n\nTicket prices\n\nWhen service begins, a one-way ticket between Minneapolis and Duluth will cost about $30 - $35.\n\nSafety improvements\n\nPublic grade crossings along the route will be upgraded to include gates and flashing lights. Some roadway approaches will also be improved to reduce the slope and improve sight lines.\n\nOther benefits"
