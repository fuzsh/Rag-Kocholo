        "text": "Winter Solstice\n\nWinter Solstice occurs this month in the southern hemisphere. On the 21st the sun rises and sets at its most northerly points, its path is the lowest of the year giving us our shortest day, and its rays arrive at their shallowest angle giving the least energy per square metre.\n\nSolstice comes from the Latin sol (sun) and sistere (stand still). At the winter solstice the Sun is said to “stand still” at its northernmost extreme after which it begins its daily southwards progression to the spring equinox. This daily shift and the solstices and equinoxes result from the Earth’s rotational axis being titled at an angle of 23.5 degrees from its orbit around the Sun.\n\nExplore more at:\n\nTimeanddate - June Solstice\n\nMuseums Victoria - Reasons for the Seasons\n\nAurora Delight\n\nAcross media and online last month beautiful pictures appeared of the Aurora Australis (Southern Lights) so we prepared this brief explainer about the extraordinary phenomenon enjoyed by so many, including from metropolitan Melbourne as seen below.\n\nSpace Weather includes the effect our local star, the Sun, has on Earth. In the current Solar Maximum period in the Sun’s 11-year cycle of energy output, increased solar activity has generated higher than normal levels of solar particles in the solar wind that blows out across the solar system in all directions. This current ‘solar max’ is occurring a year earlier than predicted and is creating auroras further from the polar regions where they normally appear.\n\nEarth’s force field\n\nAs our planet rotates its solid iron-nickel inner core and liquid iron outer core act as a massive dynamo generating electric currents which produces an extended protective magnetic field enveloping Earth. Physics has shown that an electric current in a conducting material, whether it be copper wire or an entire planet, will produce a magnetic field. The reverse is also true; a magnetic field can induce an electric current. Such is the dual nature of electro-magnetism.\n\nEarth’s dynamic field deflects most of the high energy charged particles of protons and electrons that form the solar wind which travels at 400 to 800 km per second. Some particles, however, spiral in between field lines and are trapped over our planet’s magnetic poles. In a process not fully understood billions are released and collide with air molecules in the upper atmosphere\n\nColourful curtains\n\nThese particles impart energy to high altitude air molecules which become temporarily charged and then release photons of light at specific wavelengths (corresponding to the aurora colours we see) as they return to their normal un-excited state. With Earth’s magnetic field lines constantly fluctuating, the overall effect is shifting patterns of colour in the upper atmosphere, looking very often like vast curtains rippling in a gentle breeze.\n\nAuroras typically occur at between 100 to 300 km altitude and sometimes as high as 600 km. Colours are green from oxygen, pink from nitrogen, red from higher altitude oxygen, and blue or purple from hydrogen and helium (although these last two are not easily seen). The auroras occur at all times but are best seen on clear nights when they can be a spectacular sight.\n\nAurora opportunities\n\nBeing Solar Maximum it is highly likely there will be more good times to observe and photograph auroras. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology’s Space Weather Forecasting Centre advises on cloud cover, aurora conditions and solar wind activity, along with useful videos: SWS - Aurora (bom.gov.au).\n\nExplore more:\n\nAustralian Antarctic Program - Awesome Aurora\n\nNASA - Aurora Fact Sheet\n\nMelbourne Sun times\n\nDate Rise Set Day length Solar noon* Tuesday 1st 7:26am 5:09pm 9:42hours 12:18pm Sunday 11th 7:32am 5:07pm 9:34hours 12:20pm Wednesday 21st 7:35am 5:08pm 9:32hours 12:22pm Friday 30st 7:36am 5:11pm 9:34hours 12:23pm\n\n*When the sun is at its highest, crossing the meridian or local longitude.\n\nMoon phases\n\nPhase Date New Moon Thursday 6th First Quarter Friday 14th Full Moon Saturday 22nd Third Quarter Saturday 29th\n\nMoon distances\n\nLunar perigee (closest to Earth) is on Thursday 27th at 369,286 km.\n\nLunar apogee (furthest from Earth) is on Friday 14th at 404,077 km.\n\nPlanets\n\nMercury, after its passage behind the Sun, is not visible this month being still too close to the Sun.\n\nVenus is not yet visible after having just completed its superior solar conjunction and passage behind the Sun.\n\nMars can be seen in the early morning rising in the east around 3:30am and moving to the north-east before fading from view by dawn.\n\nJupiter rises around 6am early in the month and a little earlier each morning before quickly fading in the early dawn light.\n\nSaturn rises by 1am early in the month and moves across the north eastern and northern sky before fading by dawn. Mid-June it will rise at half past midnight and by the end of the month by 11:30pm.\n\nMeteors\n\nThere are two minor meteor showers this month. The Arietid Meteor Shower (in the constellation of Aries) occurs through to June 24 but peaks on June 11th. From Melbourne the shower is likely best seen just before dawn. Although low in number (less than 10 per hour) they can often be spectacular and bright with many displaying a yellow/orange colour.\n\nThe Bootid Meteor Shower (in the constellation of Bootes) appears late in June and into early July. The best time to see meteors is after midnight with no moon in the night sky.\n\nLearn more at:\n\nIn-the-sky – Arietid Meteor Shower\n\nIn-the-sky – Bootid Meteor Shower\n\nStars and constellations\n\nIn the west\n\nAlthough Orion has disappeared below the western horizon but his two dogs Canis Major with the star Sirius (low in the west) and Canis Minor with the star Procyon (low in the north-west) are still both in our skies.\n\nIn the north\n\nLeo the lion is still visible in the north-west with the bright star Regulus. Look for a large hook of stars, or inverted question mark, to locate his curving mane and shoulders.\n\nIn the east\n\nScorpius is in the south-east this month with the red-giant star Antares as the middle of three stars that form the scorpion’s body. During winter the centaur-archer Sagittarius suits below the scorpion with its bow and arrow (the famous ‘Tea Pot’ asterism).\n\nIn the south\n\nHigh in the south-east is Crux or The Southern Cross with the Pointers (Alpha and\n\nHigh in the south-east is Crux or The Southern Cross with the Pointers (Alpha and Beta Centauri) lower down. In darker skies the two neighbouring galaxies, the Large and Small Clouds of Magellan, can be seen as small isolated patches in the south-west. From our southern latitude they are easily seen every night.\n\nIn dark locations the broad band of the Milky Way’s billions of stars and numerous interstellar dust clouds stretches across the sky from horizon to horizon. While some foreground stars in our local region of the galaxy can be seen, the dark dust clouds obscure our view further into the galaxy since our eyes and optical telescopes ‘see’ in only the visible part of the spectrum.\n\nSee NASA-JPL video Interstellar Clouds and Dark Nebulae\n\nInternational Space Station\n\nISS orbits every 90 minutes at an average distance of 400 km appearing like a bright star moving slowly across the night sky.\n\nHere are some of the brightest morning and evening passes expected this month over Melbourne:\n\nMorning\n\nTuesday 4th 6:19am to 6:25am South-West to North-East\n\nEvening\n\nSaturday 15th 6:51pm to 6:54pm North-West to South-West\n\nSunday 16th 6:02pm to 6:08pm North-North-West to East-South-East\n\nHeavens Above gives predictions for visible passes of space stations and major satellites, live sky views and 3D visualisations.
