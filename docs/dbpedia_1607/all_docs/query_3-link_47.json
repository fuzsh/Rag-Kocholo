        "text": "Net sales for the quarter increased 0.3% driven by organic Net sales growth of 1.2% versus the prior year.1\n\nGross margin improved 160 basis points over prior year, up 270 basis points on an adjusted basis.1\n\nNon-cash impairment resulted in a loss per share of $0.61. Adjusted Earnings per share were $0.79, an increase of approximately 46% over prior year.1\n\nPaid down $150 million of debt year to date.\n\nFiscal year outlook for Adjusted Earnings per share and Adjusted EBITDA expected to be at the high end of the original range.1\n\nST. LOUIS, Aug. 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Energizer Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: ENR) today announced results for the third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n\"We are extremely pleased with our third quarter performance,\" said Mark LaVigne, Chief Executive Officer. \"Improving category dynamics supported a return to organic growth and combined with our strong gross margin expansion drove a 46% increase in adjusted earnings per share, exceeding our expectations. This over-delivery is expected to put us at the top end of our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the year.\"\n\nMr. LaVigne continued, \"By focusing on our strategic priorities we remain on track to exit the year with the right investments in place to capitalize on this momentum and enable long-term growth and value creation for our shareholders.\"\n\nTop-Line Performance\n\nFor the quarter, we had Net sales of $701.4 million compared to $699.4 million in the prior year period.\n\n1) See Press Release attachments and supplemental schedules for additional information, including the GAAP and Non-GAAP reconciliations.\n\nOrganic Net sales increased 1.2% due to the following items:\n\nVolume increase in Battery & Lights driven by improved category trends and new distribution globally resulted in 3.6% organic growth; and\n\nVolume increase in Auto Care driven by favorable refrigerant sales due to warmer weather and international distribution gains resulted in organic growth of 1.0%.\n\nPartially offsetting these increases were pricing declines of 3.4%, primarily within Battery & Lights, driven by planned strategic pricing and promotional investments in the quarter.\n\nGross Margin\n\nGross margin percentage on a reported basis was 39.5% versus 37.9% in the prior year. Excluding the current year and prior year restructuring costs and current year integration costs, adjusted gross margin was 41.5%, compared to the prior year adjusted gross margin of 38.8%.(1)\n\nAdjusted Gross margin improvement was driven by both Project Momentum initiatives, which delivered savings of approximately $14 million in the quarter, as well as lower input costs, including improved commodity and material pricing and lower ocean freight. These benefits were partially offset by the planned strategic pricing and promotional investments noted above.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense (SG&A)\n\nSG&A, excluding restructuring and related costs and acquisition and integration costs, was 16.9% of Net sales for the third quarter, or $118.4 million, compared to 16.2%, or $113.3 million in the prior year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by an increase in labor and benefit costs, higher travel expense, increased depreciation expense related to our digital transformation initiatives and increased legal fees. This increase was partially offset by savings from Project Momentum of approximately $7 million.(1)\n\nAdvertising and Promotion Expense (A&P)\n\nA&P expense was $37.9 million, or 5.4% of net sales, compared to 5.4% in the prior year.\n\nThe net loss for the quarter is driven by the $110.6 million non-cash pre-tax impairment charge recorded on the Company's indefinite lived intangibles. Adjusted Net Earnings, Adjusted Earnings per share and Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter were positively impacted by improved Gross profit and reduced Interest expense, partially offset by increased SG&A spending and unfavorable currency movements.\n\nFree cash flow and Capital allocation\n\nOperating cash flow for the first nine months of the year was $260.7 million, and free cash flow was $195.1 million, or 9.4% of Net sales.\n\nThe Company acquired an Auto Care appearance and fragrance manufacturer and distributor based in Southern Brazil for an initial cash payment of $10.6 million during the quarter.\n\nDividend payments in the quarter were approximately $22 million, or $0.30 per common share, and approximately $66 million for the first nine months of the year.\n\nLong-term debt pay down in the first nine months of the year was approximately $150 million. Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA was 5.0 times as of June 30, 2024.\n\nFinancial Outlook and Assumptions for Fiscal Year 2024(1)\n\nOur third quarter organic Net sales were within our guidance of up approximately 1%, while Project Momentum savings resulted in Adjusted gross margin and Adjusted earnings per share ahead of expectations.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, we expect organic revenue to be down roughly 2%. We also expect Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $610 million to $620 million and Adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.30. For the fourth quarter, we expect organic revenue to be roughly flat and Adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.20.\n\nProject Momentum total savings have increased and now are expected to be in the range of $180 to $200 million over the life of the program. Cash costs to achieve these savings over this same period are expected to be $150 to $170 million. For fiscal year 2024, savings are expected to be in the range of $80 to $90 million with one-time cash costs to achieve between $70 to $80 million.\n\nWebcast Information\n\nIn conjunction with this announcement, the Company will hold an investor conference call beginning at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time today.

However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful comparisons to the corresponding historical or future period, and are used for management incentive compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that are not reflective of the Company's on-going operating performance, such as impairment of intangible assets, restructuring and related costs, acquisition and integration costs, the loss/(gain) on extinguishment of debt and the December 2023 Argentina Economic Reform. In addition, these measures help investors to analyze year over year comparability when excluding currency fluctuations as well as other Company initiatives that are not on-going. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are an enhancement to assist investors in understanding our business and in performing analysis consistent with financial models developed by research analysts. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in methods and in the items being adjusted.\n\nWe provide the following non-GAAP measures and calculations, as well as the corresponding reconciliation to the closest GAAP measure in the following supplemental schedules:\n\nSegment Profit. This amount represents the operations of our two reportable segments including allocations for shared support functions. General corporate and other expenses, amortization expense, impairment of intangible assets, interest expense, loss/(gain) on extinguishment of debt, other items, net, restructuring and related costs and acquisition and integration costs have all been excluded from segment profit.\n\nAdjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share (EPS). These measures exclude the impact of the impairment of intangible assets, restructuring and related costs, the costs related to acquisition and integration, the loss/(gain) on extinguishment of debt and the December 2023 Argentina Economic Reform.\n\nNon-GAAP Tax Rate. This is the tax rate when excluding the pre-tax impact of the impairment of intangible assets, restructuring and related costs, acquisition and integration costs, the loss/(gain) on extinguishment of debt and the December 2023 Argentina Economic Reform, as well as the related tax impact for these items, calculated utilizing the statutory rate for where the impact was incurred.\n\nOrganic. This is the non-GAAP financial measurement of the change in revenue or segment profit that excludes or otherwise adjusts for the change in Argentina operations and impact of currency from the changes in foreign currency exchange rates as defined below:\n\nChange in Argentina Operations. The Company is presenting separately all changes in sales and segment profit from our Argentina affiliate due to the designation of the economy as highly inflationary as of July 1, 2018.\n\nImpact of Currency. The Company evaluates the operating performance of our Company on a currency neutral basis. The Impact of Currency is the change in foreign currency exchange rates year-over-year on reported results, which is calculated by comparing the value of current year foreign operations at the current period USD exchange rate versus the value of current year foreign operations at the prior period USD exchange rate. The impact of currency also includes gains/(losses) of currency hedging programs, and it excludes hyper-inflationary markets.\n\nAdjusted Comparisons. Detail for Adjusted Gross profit, Adjusted Gross margin, Adjusted SG&A and Adjusted SG&A as percent of Net sales and Adjusted Other items, net are also supplemental non-GAAP measure disclosures. These measures exclude the impact of restructuring and related costs, acquisition and integration costs and the December 2023 Argentina Economic Reform.\n\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as net earnings before income tax provision, interest, the loss/(gain) on extinguishment of debt, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes the impact of the costs related to restructuring, acquisition and integration costs, the settlement loss on US pension annuity buy out, the December 2023 Argentina Economic Reform, the impairment of intangible assets and share based payments.\n\nFree Cash Flow. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by capital expenditures, net of the proceeds from asset sales.\n\nNet Debt. Net debt is defined as total Company debt, less cash and cash equivalents.\n\nCurrency-neutral. Currency-neutral excludes the Impact of currency as defined above on key measures. Hyper inflationary markets are excluded from this calculation.\n\nEnergizer Holdings, Inc.\n\nSupplemental Schedules - Segment Information\n\nFor the Quarter and Nine Months Ended June 30, 2024\n\n(In millions - Unaudited)\n\nOperations for Energizer are managed via two product segments: Batteries & Lights and Auto Care.
