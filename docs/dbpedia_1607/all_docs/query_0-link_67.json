        "text": "The man said there was no sign of the aurora - “nah, nothing” - and he doubted it would be visible at all due to the intense light generated by all the cars.\n\n“I didn’t go down last night so I thought I’d give a crack. But you’d be better off going anywhere else in Wellington I reckon.”\n\nOtago University physics professor Craig Rodger told the Herald Aucklanders have received a stroke of luck, with the US Space Weather Prediction Centre (SWPC) now predicting another G5 solar storm from 9pm tonight.\n\nRodger initially said Tāmaki Makaurau was set to miss out in the once-in-a-decade event, but now a new “solar tsunami” could mean northern skies may well see another aurora.\n\nA national power grid emergency notice has just been extended until 4am tomorrow due to the extreme solar storm.\n\nStargazers across New Zealand were treated last night to an incredible display of dazzling light across the southern skies.\n\nThe Herald was inundated by readers’ photos, documenting what for many is likely to be a once-in-a-lifetime event.\n\nWith more clear skies tonight, many across the country will be hoping for another chance to capture the aurora.\n\nRodger had today been telling people what he thought was the best information, but by mid-afternoon the forecasts had changed.\n\n“A little bit longer of the really intense activity, much like we had last night.”\n\nRodger advised hopeful aurora watchers with a keen eye to look south and watch for clear skies between 9pm and 3am.\n\nMetService meteorologist Clare O’Connor said the stunning visual display was an uncommon sight for New Zealanders, but even more so for those in the Far North.\n\n“In New Zealand, we’re not that far south, and the closer you are to the poles, the easier they are to spot. We do see the stronger ones, but to see them from Northland, that’s very uncommon,” O’Connor said.\n\nThe SWPC showed the incredible patch of activity was set to fade by midnight, but another flare explosion on the sun has hurled a solar tsunami towards Earth.\n\nAuroras result from magnetosphere disruptions caused by solar wind, altering the trajectories of charged particles.\n\nThese particles then rise into the upper atmosphere, creating colourful displays.\n\nAre we set for another week of cold temperatures?\n\nToday was the coldest morning of the year for some parts of Aotearoa. It has set the standard as we roll into the beginning of next week.\n\nTemperatures dropped below zero in several regions in the early hours of Mother’s Day and Auckland reached a chilly low of -0.4C in Whenuapai.\n\nO’Connor said the coldest temperature recorded was in east Rangitāiki along State Highway 5 between Taupō and Napier, a low of -8.7C.\n\nAbout 6.30am this morning, Rotorua recorded its second-coldest temperature for the month since 1972 at -3.3C.\n\nLooking towards next week, O’Connor said people living in the central North Island should continue to expect cooler-than-average mornings on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nTemperatures are then likely to head back to a slightly warmer May average from Wednesday onwards.\n\nO’Connor said the North Island may be up for a wet Wednesday morning, which could also affect the top of the South Island.\n\nThe rain is expected to clear for a mostly dry period at the end of the week for most of the country.\n\nNational power grid emergency\n\nThe national power grid emergency notice has been extended until 4am tomorrow.\n\nThe cold start to the day risked putting extra strain on the country’s power supply, with some transmission lines in the North Island and South Island closed on Saturday as a precaution.\n\nTranspower, which operates the national power grid, said in a statement the storm could affect the Earth this weekend because of significant solar activity.\n\n“As part of our contingency plan, we are removing some transmission lines from service across the South Island as a precaution. In order to do this, we have to issue a grid emergency notice. However, this initial action should not impact supply of electricity to consumers.”"
