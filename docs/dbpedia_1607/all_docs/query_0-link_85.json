        "text": "9AM SUNDAY UPDATE: We’ve been closely monitoring the chance to view the Northern Lights again Sunday night. Viewing was difficult Saturday and the aurora appeared much dimmer than Friday. It’s looking like tonight might be similar to last night.\n\nA level 6 or 7 on the geomagnetic storm scale is forecast tonight, which isn’t quite high enough to get same view we saw on Friday. We’ll keep you updated throughout the day as we get new data!\n\n11 PM: SATURDAY UPDATE: The latest update from Space Weather Saturday night suggested we may have seen the peak of the solar storm before it got dark and it slowly faded overnight.\n\n“The current planetary K-index is indicative of this at 7.33 (strong storm), but may continue to quiet down to minor to moderate geomagnetic storms this evening. Thus, my hunch this evening is that aurora viewing may only be limited to the northern tier of the United States tonight, particularly in the northern fringes of the Northeast and Northwest, Montana, Idaho, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. [View Full Details Here]\n\nThat said, we’ve seen a few reports of some faint lights as far south as the Blue Ridge Parkway toward Charlottesville, Rockbridge, Roanoke and even as far south as Rural Retreat.\n\nIt might be worth giving it a try tonight, but the data is showing Sunday might end up being the better of the two days to spot the lights as a new solar storm is expected to hit earth during the day with leftover energy into the evening.\n\nVIEWING TIPS\n\nWILL I SEE THEM WITH THE NAKED EYE? Likely not. Unless you’re in a super dark area, the images you see floating around were taken with ordinary cellphones, but you weren’t able to spot them with your eyes well last night.\n\nHOW DO I KNOW THEY’RE OUT? We use the Kp forecast. (Click here for the latest Kp number) Typically if it reaches 7 or above, the darkest areas away from city lights may be able to see them. Last night, it reached an 8 and 9 which made it a stellar show. That may happen again tonight. As of this afternoon there have already been some 8/9 readings, but it’s still light here now.\n\nWHEN TO LOOK: Anytime after dark, but the later you go past sunset, the darker the skies will get. Friday night, once we got past 9pm or 10pm the show began. These solar storms come in waves, so it can be great one hour, then not as vivid the next. These typically last into the night and can go even until the sun comes up.\n\nHOW TO TAKE IT WITH MY PHONE? You don’t have to be a professional photographer (I’m not), but you do need a steady hand and basic understanding of how your phone camera works. You’ll want to set you phone camera to PHOTO and put it on a longer exposure time. I used a 3 second on my iPhone last night. You need to keep the phone very still while it’s taking the photo. Once it’s finished, you’ll see those amazing colors, even without a filter. Study up on your camera settings before the fun begins.\n\nWHAT COLOR WILL IT BE TONIGHT? Hard to say because each storm is different. It’s a geomagnetic storm Oxygen gives off the fluorescent green and yellow colour of the aurora (most common) when hit by electrons in the solar system. Nitrogen causes blue or red colors and sometimes pink. Neon turns them orange. You never really know what you’ll see until it starts. And sometimes you see them all.\n\nSHARE YOUR PHOTOS WITH FIRST ALERT WEATHER!\n\n9AM SATURDAY UPDATE: Thank you to everyone that shared your beautiful aurora photos with us!\n\nTonight’s geomagnetic storm forecast is a level 7 out of 9. In comparison, Friday was a level 9! The Northern Lights certainly won’t be as vibrant as last night, but in the right conditions, you should be able to see them again.\n\nTo get the best view, travel to a high elevation location, away from light pollution, after sunset tonight. You might not be able to see the aurora with a naked eye, but a long-exposure camera should capture some beautiful green, pink, and purple colors.\n\nWe’re forecasting partly cloudy skies tonight with lows in the 50s.\n\n11PM FRIDAY UPDATE: In what might be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, the northern lights made their way as far south as the Carolinas Friday night. We have been inundated by hundreds of photos of the aurora across the WDBJ7 coverage area this evening. Thank you!\n\nThe solar storm hit the earth Friday afternoon and once it got dark, the colors became spectacular shades of purple and green.\n\nEven in the cities where light pollution is higher, you’re likely still able to see it with your phone camera.\n\nTIP: You may not be able to see it with the naked eye. Put your phone camera toward the northern sky and put on long exposure if you have that option. Photo works better than video. Remember, if you don’t know which way is north, use your phone’s compass.\n\nThe northern lights are expected to continue into the night, so be sure to head outdoors and look toward the northern horizon.\n\n9PM UPDATE: The Northern Lights are currently underway! In areas of the globe where it’s already dark, the skies have been lighting up with a colorful glow.\n\nThe colors are showing up all the way to Virginia with some reports from Blacksburg tonight of a hint of purple along the horizon. It could only get better if you head to a dark location away from city light pollution.\n\nAnother photographer near Charlottesville, VA managed to snap a photo of the northern lights.\n\nAccording to SpaceWeather.com, “the southern latitude of Victoria, Australia, 37 degrees, is the same as the northern latitude of central California.” That’s how far down auroras could be seen.\n\nFor perspective, the 37th north latitude runs right through Virginia.\n\nWHAT COULD IT LOOK LIKE?\n\nWHERE TO LOOK: The northern horizon\n\nWHEN TO LOOK: Friday night between 11 p.m. and 4 a.m. Saturday\n\nVIEWING TIPS\n\nFind a clear view of the northern horizon\n\nGet away from city lights\n\nBe patient\n\nDon’t look at your phone and let your eyes adjust to darkness\n\nIn New Zealand, it’s the southern lights which are putting on a show, painting the skies with hues of red and purple.\n\nNOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center has increased the Geomagnetic Storm Watch from Moderate to Severe (G4), the largest since 2005, after a massive cluster of sunspots emerged over the past 24 hours and sent several M-class (second largest) solar flares toward Earth.\n\nAt least 5 earth-directed coronal mass ejections were observed heading toward Earth and are expected to combine and slam into the Earth’s atmosphere sometime Friday.\n\nThese are expected to arrive as early as midday Friday, May 10, and persist through Sunday, May 12, according to NOAA Space Weather.\n\nMike Overacker, a NASA Ambassador based in Roanoke, Virginia, managed to snap these photos of the large cluster of sunspots Thursday. The astrophotographer says this may end up being the biggest grouping spotted since the 1800s.\n\nFor perspective, the sun spot grouping is the diameter of 15 earths. The sun itself could hold 1.3 million Earths inside of it.\n\n“Watches at this level are very rare,” the NOAA Watch states.\n\nNORTHERN LIGHTS\n\nWhile details are still coming in, the solar storm may end up producing an aurora (northern lights) which may reach as far south as Virginia and even Alabama late Friday into Saturday.\n\nFORECAST: Skies are expected to be partly cloudy to mostly clear locally Friday night into Saturday morning. The moon is currently <5% illuminated, so that should also allow for good viewing should the northern lights make it this far south.\n\nSevere geomagnetic storms can also cause major issues and even damage satellites, GPS systems and even cause blackouts of high-frequency radio equipment.\n\nOnly three “Severe” geomagnetic storms have been observed during this solar cycle which began in December 2019. The last G4 was March 23, 2024 which created an incredible viewing of the northern lights.\n\nThe last G5 (Extreme) was the Halloween Storms in October 2003 which resulted in power outages in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the story into the weekend.\n\nLATEST UPDATES FROM NOAA SPACE WEATHER\n\nLOOKING BACK\n\n“The last (observed) Severe geomagnetic storm was on March 23, 2024, and the last Extreme was the Halloween Storms in October 2003,” the SWPC stated. “That G5 (Extreme storm) resulted in power outages in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa.”"
