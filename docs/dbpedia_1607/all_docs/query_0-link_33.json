        "text": "People across Aotearoa have been given a rare glimpse into the mechanics of the Sun and its effects on our planet this weekend after a strong solar storm caused aurora to be visible across vast swathes of the Northern and Southern hemispheres.\n\nThe solar storm spurred infrastructure companies, including Transpower, to issue warnings and take steps to minimise any disruptions.\n\nScientists agree that the Sun is undergoing a period of intense activity, which occurs in 11-year cycles.\n\nSolar flares and coronal eruptions have been detected by the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) in the United States, which has been tracking several flares from a cluster of sunspots since 8 May.\n\nThe cluster is estimated to be 16 to 17 times the diameter of the Earth and led to the first severe warning since 2005.\n\nHow frequent are solar storms in NZ?\n\nOtago University physics Professor Craig Rodger told RNZ that despite the storm reaching G5 - the top of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) SWPC scale for geomagnetic storms - it had only just done so.\n\nIt was the largest such solar storm for more than a decade in New Zealand - but not as big as those of 2003 or 2001, and he said we had learned a lot since then.\n\nRodger had been working on understanding and modelling the impacts of a severe solar storm on New Zealand's electricity grid.\n\nThe current storm was smaller than the one in 2001, which knocked out a power transformer in Dunedin - an event also known as a geomagnetically induced current hot spot.\n\nWhy are the Southern Lights so colourful?\n\nUsually, particles from solar flares bounce off the Earth's magnetic field, but when there is a severe eruption, they can penetrate the ionosphere and interact with gases around the magnetic poles - causing the ribbons of colour.\n\nAuroras are usually confined to certain latitudes in the north and south, which makes them relatively rare to observe for most of the population.\n\nThe pinks, purples and greens that are often associated with aurora are the particles interacting with different gasses. Simply put, oxygen - which emits greenish-yellow or red light - and nitrogen - which emits blue light - in the upper atmosphere release specific colours when bombarded by solar radiation.\n\nAtoms, molecules and ions in the atmosphere are excited by the electrically charged particles and, in turn, release photons - which is the light we see."
