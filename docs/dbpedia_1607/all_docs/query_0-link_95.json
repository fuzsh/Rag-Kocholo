        "text": "(KTNV) â€” If you weren't expecting to see the northern lights in Southern Nevada this weekend, you're not alone. It's a rare occurrence that some residents were lucky enough to see for themselves late Friday night.\n\nLuckily those who missed that brief window could have another chance to glimpse the aurora borealis on Saturday night.\n\nAurora borealis and high pressure in Las Vegas, oh my!\n\nHow can I see the northern lights in Southern Nevada?\n\nStrong solar radiation storms are in progress and expected to continue through Monday.\n\nThe aurora borealis is very active, and while NOAA is not forecasting it to be visible from the naked eye in southern Nevada...try your luck! Some viewers were able to snapshot the show last night, and Saturday evening is expected to be a strong forecast once again.\n\nSunday night into Monday, the storms are expected to become weaker and less visible.\n\nLight pollution is a factor in your ability to see the northern lights. Here's a map for where to find a darker sky in Nevada.\n\nLong exposure on your iPhone may be able to capture the colors!"
