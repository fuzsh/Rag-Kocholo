        "text": "What process gives rise to the aurora borealis and aurora australis?\n\nShort Answer\n\nExpert verified\n\nAuroras are formed when charged particles from the sun collide with Earth's atmosphere near the poles, emitting light.\n\nStep by step solution\n\n01\n\n- Understanding Auroras\n\nAuroras, also known as the northern lights (aurora borealis) and southern lights (aurora australis), are natural light displays in the Earth's sky, predominantly seen in high-latitude regions around the Arctic and Antarctic.\n\n02\n\n- Solar Wind\n\nThe process begins with solar wind, which is a stream of charged particles (mostly electrons and protons) emitted by the sun. These particles travel through space and reach the Earth.\n\n03\n\n- Earth's Magnetic Field\n\nWhen the solar wind reaches the Earth, the planet's magnetic field redirects these charged particles towards the poles. The interaction between the solar wind and the magnetic field is crucial for the formation of auroras.\n\n04\n\n- Collision with Atmosphere\n\nAs the charged particles approach the poles, they collide with atoms and molecules in the Earth's atmosphere. These collisions cause the atoms and molecules to become excited.\n\n05\n\n- Emission of Light\n\nThe excited atoms and molecules return to their normal state by releasing energy in the form of light. This light is what we observe as the beautiful colors of the auroras.\n\nKey Concepts\n\nThese are the key concepts you need to understand to accurately answer the question.\n\nsolar wind\n\nAuroras begin with solar wind, which is a flow of charged particles streaming from the Sun. This wind is made up mostly of electrons and protons. These particles escape the Sun's outer layer, called the corona, and travel through space at speeds ranging from 300 to 800 kilometers per second.\n\nWhen solar wind reaches the Earth, it carries with it the Sun's magnetic field. It interacts with the Earth's magnetosphere, which plays a vital role in the formation of auroras. Without the solar wind, there wouldn't be enough charged particles to create the light displays we see.\n\nEarth's magnetic field\n\nThe Earth's magnetic field acts like a shield, protecting the planet from many harmful effects of solar wind.\n\nWhen the charged particles from solar wind collide with this magnetic field, they are directed towards the poles. This is because the magnetic field lines are closer together near the poles, guiding the particles to these areas.\n\nThe interaction between solar wind and Earth's magnetic field compresses the field and creates regions known as the auroral ovals around the polar regions. Here, the particles are funneled down towards the Earth's atmosphere, setting the stage for auroras.\n\natmosphere collisions\n\nAs the redirected charged particles from the solar wind approach the Earth's poles, they enter the upper atmosphere. Here, they collide with atoms and molecules, mostly oxygen and nitrogen.\n\nThese collisions transfer energy from the particles to the atoms and molecules, causing them to become excited. Excited atoms have extra energy, which makes them unstable. This extra energy needs to be released for the atoms to return to their normal state.\n\nThe specific gases present in the atmosphere and the height at which these collisions occur determine the colors of the aurora.\n\nlight emission\n\nWhen excited atoms and molecules return to their normal state, they release the extra energy as light. This process is called photon emission.\n\nThe various colors of the auroras are due to different gases and their excitation levels. Oxygen gives off green or red light depending on its altitude. Green is the most common and occurs up to 150 miles above the Earth. Red can happen above 150 miles. Nitrogen can produce blue or purplish-red hues, depending on its interactions.\n\nThese emissions collectively create the stunning and varied colors of the auroras we are accustomed to witnessing in the night sky."
