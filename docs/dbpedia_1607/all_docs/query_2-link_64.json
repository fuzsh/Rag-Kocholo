        "text": "SP usedÂ two oil type \"markers\" lightsÂ SP used green and red lenses. Red faces to the rear while green is to the side and front. The 1951 SP rules book mentions only green and red lights. Incidentally an engine running backwards would at night would have markers lit on the pilot beam. However a train operations book of 1916 written by the SP Chief Examiner mentions green or yellow if used. Amber does make sense when you consider Santa Fe practice and Tehachapi and mixing equipment from both roads. The Class lights on locos would never be Red running in reverse, there would be marker lights lit on the pilot instead.\n\nRule 19 states in effect that rear markers are to be red to rear, green side and front unless in a siding to be passed. Then front, side and rear are all to be green. There is also an instruction to display one red(outside or away from second track) and green on in-side (against a second track) when running AGAINST the current of traffic on double track. In reference to another portion of this discussion, all signal lamps, both front and rear, whether displayed on locomotives, tenders or cars are referred to as markers or marker lamps.\n\nDiesels retain their classification lights have two colored spectacles that can be turned in place. They are green and red, enabling the class lights to display four aspects, white, green, red and out, depending on the situation. Therefore, the class lights are able to be used as markers when an engine is running at the rear end of a train. The red mars/gyralight has also been used as an auxiliary marker in this situation.\n\nSome rear end cars had \"bullet\" markers on the sides at the end of the letterboard. The rounded-corner 10-6s (called in some circles \"blunt end\" as if the other ends were not blunt) designed for rear end service had a large oscillating red light in the center of the roof over the end door. It appears that at first its use was akin to that of the red oscillating light on locomotives (UDE, for example) On either side of this was a pair of much smaller, vertically mounted, lights which it appears also served as markers This light package was also present on business cars and other rear end cars. Early pictures show the lower of each of these lights to have been red. The rulebook is indecisive about exactly how these lights were to be used, perhaps it may be safe to assume that at the outset they were used in the same fashion as traditional markers. Absent this array, a red light or flag to the rear was the substitute. The rulebook even stipulates how the rear end is to be identified absent the customary markers.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the 1960 rulebook kept the same drawings and basic rules for the display of markers and indicators as were in the 1943 and 1930 rulebooks, even though the drawings were of steam engines which had a pilot beam sufficient to serve as a support for the lights being displayed as markers. A quick glance shows no accommodation for diesels, and since there are no correction pages (in my two copies of the 1960 book), The deletion of the \"pilot\" requirement was by bulletin. The 1969 rulebook eliminated the drawings and most of the older rules, but added the requirement that both markers and green or white indicators on locomotives must be illuminated day or night.\n\nIn CTC territory there were usually no classified freight schedules so they were all extras.Â The rules usually permitted display of train numbers that were used on adjoining territory that was TT&TO territory, as when a train ran through the isolated CTC segments on the Western Division.Â In AC days, on the Shasta route. in the CTC section between Redding and Black Butte, locomotives carried the train numbers that were applicable for the timetable and train order territories beyond the CTC section even though all trains technically were extras in CTC.\n\nAn an example is shown in the 1943 rulebook where a indicator has the number 2 in the indicator and the note that the last section would use only the number 2. This is a good example of how rules varied from railroad to railroad in the years before unified rules.\n\nRecall that until at least 1943, SP still used green flags; all sections except the last were supposed to carry green flags, in daytime. So any pre-1943 pic of a train carrying a section number in the indicators, in daylight, with no green flags-- is evidence that at that time the last section did show its section number.\n\nIt was a 1960 rulebook that had rule 21C about the last section running with only the schedule number in the train indicator. Remember, Sections were run 1st 2nd 3rd, etc. First section would run before Second before Third...and the last section would not have a section number prefacing the train number.\n\n2.Â A small piece of thin styrene painted black and numbered as you need (repeat as necessary), and put some 'Tacky Glue' on the back and they stick pretty good; store these on a hunk of cellophane or an old negative sleeve, between uses.Â The Tacky Glue is sold at many craft stores and is also useful for figures and placards, as it sticks and then comes off without leaving much (if any)Â residue. Make sure your base surface decals are well sealed.\n\n4.Â Buy 8 x 11 sheets of laser printable matte transparent film by the box. Itâs sold as a drafting supply so one can print up a company logo and title block for velum drawings. When you peel off the paper backing you have a sheet of what looks like 3m Magic mending tape (a matte finish transparent office tape). Since the clear film is being laser printed it can be black letters on clear or clear letters surrounded by black.\n\nIn Santa Marguarita and SLO, they didn't know if the helper would be on the point with a passenger train or in midtrain on a freight. It would be easier to have just two open spaces to slip in passenger numbers than to have to put all back in. It would make no difference on a mid-train.\n\nGreen flags and/or green light was the signal that was displayed to indicate that another section of a schedules was following, one at each side of the rear end of the last passenger coach on trains. This was the same before and after the rules changed about placing the section number in the indicator of the last section. If, for example, there were two section of a train running under the old rules then the second section would have a two before the train number to identify the train but no flags/lights because there was no following section. In pre â50 photos the last section with a section number in the indicator and no flag is operating under the rules.\n\nThe 1903 rule book has a generally identical stipulation.Â There is no differentiation as to freight and passenger trains. The next book is 1923, wherein all has changed and red (at night) or dark (during the day) is the rearward display. Locomotives do not display markers, except when running light (on the tender if running forward or on the pilot beam if running in reverse).\n\nGreen flags by day, green flags and lighted green class lamps at night, in their usual place on the smokebox.Â A loco might also display green flags on both the smokebox (classification) AND the pilot beam (markers), if it was running backward by day at the rear of a train, or even if it was running without cars as a section of a following train. At night, the pilot beam green flags would give way to red marker lights.\n\nOne long and two short blasts of the whistle is an indication that a train is displaying (green) signals for a following section and will be given at both front and rear end of the train affected thereby.Â Two short blasts of the whistle and by the rear of the train by the trainman (conductor)isÂ in accordance with rule 12 (g).Â If not answered then the passing train will be stopped and the reason for not answering obtained.Â A report of such violations shall be reported to the superintendent from the first open train order station.\n\nThe earliest Daylight-liveried ob car with an oscillating red rear rooftop lamp is the former set of Coast Daylight parlor obs cars assigned to the new Shasta Daylight. Thereafter SP gets pretty much into the retrofit of other obs cars with oscillating rooftop red lamps, including a large number of the division superintendents' and higher-officials' business cars and in new construction with the blunt end sleepers for the Lark, Cascade, COSF and Sunset.\n\nThe \"white\" backup lamp at the center rear of the roof on the Coast Daylight was only illuminated when the train was being turned as a whole in reverse on a wye, or when the consist was being backed down into LAUPT or S.F. station (or if the the train on the road had to make some sort of a special backup move), and definitely would not be flashing. It was also an emergency (red) light. Otherwise only the side markers were lit, red to the rear, green to the sides. They ought NOT to be simultaneously red and green. The SP most certainly DID use green to the rear when the train was in the clear on a siding, whether freight or passenger.\n\nThe SP blue flags are12 x 13 inches, is metal, and is lettered \"MEN AT WORK\", and not a \"blue flag.\" The metal ones are attached to hooks or staffs so that they can be put onto brackets or stood up in the track. Without those things, they could not be used in the normal way. Mine has a staff and a hook on one end."
