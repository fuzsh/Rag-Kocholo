        "text": "Is seeing the world-famous Southern Lights phenomenon on your bucket list? The Aurora Australis—also called the Southern Lights—is the southern cousin of the Northern Lights. To witness this breathtaking spectacle, you would need to go as far south as Tasmania—but even then, the chance of seeing the Southern Lights is spotty at best, with only a 1-2% chance on any given night.\n\nFor those who want to ensure that they’ll see the Aurora’s spectacular light show, Rachel Williams of EO New Zealand has the solution. Rachel and her company, Viva Expeditions, created a service called Southern Lights by Flight. It flies guests from Christchurch, New Zealand down toward Antarctica and through the Auroral zone and back—all in one unforgettable night!\n\nWe asked Rachel about Southern Lights by Flight. Here’s what she shared:\n\nIs it true that Southern Lights by Flight was your Covid pivot?\n\nYes. Pre-Covid, we specialised exclusively in travel to Latin America and Antarctica. The pandemic was a terrible time as all business ceased, followed by repatriation, refunds, redundancies and pretty much every cost-cutting thing we could do other than complete hibernation. We needed to do something to generate revenue until international travel resumed and Southern Lights by Flight was our solution. Not only have we filled the gap, we have also created a quality sustainable product that will continue into the future.\n\nIs your company the only one offering this unique opportunity?\n\nWe created the service and are the only ones running it in New Zealand. I reached out to an astronomer who I knew had organised a similar experience for his friends and followers but it had never been commercialised. I asked him to help me, and he agreed. So we went to the airline, chartered the plane, and brought our own astronomy team onboard to assist the pilots with navigation.\n\nOur business partners in Australia subsequently launched similar flights. However ours is different in that:\n\nNew Zealand is further south than Australia, so it takes us less time to reach the active Auroral zone, and we can stay there much longer. We have an exclusive contract with Air New Zealand, so replication is not possible at this time.\n\nThe International Antarctic Centre is located next to the airport in Christchurch. We have enhanced our guests’ experience by including an inspiring pre-flight mission where people learn from astronomers and NASA educators about the Aurora and can join photography sessions prior to the flight. (See our guests’ in-flight photos in our Facebook Group.)\n\nWhat challenges did you overcome around organizing flights to see the Aurora?\n\nWe coordinated with Greenpeace—they worried about unnecessary burning of carbon—so we have a thorough carbon offsetting programme in place.\n\nWe had some upset families of the Erabus disaster (when a plane full of New Zealanders crashed into Mt. Erabus in Antarctica 43 years ago). We don’t go to Antarctica but there was still a lot of push back.\n\nWe have dealt with aircraft availability restrictions, rescheduling flights due to Covid lockdowns, and navigating constantly changing rules about gathering sizes, vaccination status, etc.\n\nWe had to reschedule eight flights due to Covid lockdowns and have managed to get three away, with lots of people still waiting for upcoming flights.\n\nWe have done it all with a team of four (we were 14 pre-Covid)\n\nThough there are no safety issues around flying through the Aurora, we also manage things like:\n\nAll cabin lights are turned off when in the Auroral zone, so we provide everyone with a red light torch that allows them to see without impacting their night vision.\n\nWe have special permission to turn off the plane’s outside safety lights (wingtips and roof lights), but this is done on the basis that there are no other planes within 3,000km of us at the time of flying.\n\nHow are you increasing environmental awareness?\n\nAt our pre-flight mission at the Antarctic Centre, we do a great presentation about the environment and how important Antarctica is in environmental protection and the work being done by aerospace experts in the field. We find that people who have a passion for Antarctica are more likely to help protect it, so we aim to transform our guests into Antarctic ambassadors.\n\nWhat does the total experience entail?\n\nThe flights itself is 10 hours, departing Christchurch at 7pm and returning to Christchurch at 5am. So basically it’s:\n\n3pm – International Antarctic Centre pre-flight mission experience\n\n5pm – Check-in and welcome drinks\n\n7pm – Boarding\n\nDinner on the plane before all lights are turned off and Aurora viewing begins\n\nLots of fun throughout the night, approximately 6 hours of Aurora viewing\n\n3am – The lights come on for breakfast\n\n5am – The plane lands and everyone disembarks feeling tired but completely thrilled\n\nWhat entrepreneurial lessons have you learned from this experience?\n\nTo think outside the box.\n\nHow to market with a zero dollar marketing budget.\n\nHow important it is to look after yourself in order to run a successful business.\n\nHow important relationships are, and why working collaboratively is often a better approach than straight out competition.\n\nWhat’s next for you?\n\nI’m going to Antarctica in November, so I released a MyEO trip to see who wanted to join me. I now have 66 EO members coming onboard—which is fabulous."
