        "text": "A pair of meteor showers peak early this week\n\nPeaks of the Southern delta Aquariid and alpha Capricornid meteor showers coincide during the last week of July, but no more than a few meteors per hour are expected.\n\nTony Rice, NASA Ambassador\n\nSevere geomagnetic could bring aurora to the upper midwest\n\nThough very strong, this geomagnetic storm is not expected to produce aurora as far south as were seen in May.\n\nTony Rice, NASA Ambassador\n\nIf you missed the northern lights, don't fret. More sun 'burps' mean there could be another chance this year\n\nThe geomagnetic storms need to be really intense, like on Friday, for the northern lights to be visible here and that short window of notice makes it nearly impossible to plan a trip around seeing them.\n\nAli Ingersoll, WRAL Investigative Data Journalist\n\nWhat you need to know about tonight's rare appearance of the northern lights\n\nPlasma, particles and energy released from the Sun on Thursday are heading for Earth and they could produce a light show in the sky visible into the Deep South.\n\nTony Rice, NASA Ambassador\n\nRare solar storm could trigger auroras above US, be visible in NC\n\nStargazers have the chance to see something pretty special on Saturday morning. A severe solar storm could supercharge the auroras, making them visible in North Carolina.\n\nGeomagnetic storm could bring northern lights to the Carolinas\n\nA geomagnetic storm approaching strong levels is expected to reach Earth Sunday night, peaking around midnight. If the weather cooperates, aurora could be visible on the northern horizon.\n\nTony Rice, NASA Ambassador\n\nSpaceX rocket lights up skies above Alaska with a blue spiral\n\nAurora filed skies above Alaska also features a blue spiral moving through the skies for a few minutes as the upper stage of a SpaceX rocket vented fuel.\n\nTony Rice, NASA Ambassador\n\nLook up: More Northern Lights could be visible in NC tonight\n\nA recent solar storm produced aurora seen as far south as New Mexico, space weather forecasts predict increased activity Saturday night as well.\n\nTony Rice, NASA Ambassador\n\nIncredibly rare: Northern Lights dazzle in North Carolina overnight\n\nAn Asheville photographer captured an incredibly rare event Thursday night: The Northern Lights, typically not visible this far south, dazzling in the starry, purple North Carolina skies.\n\nHeather Leah, WRAL multiplatform producer\n\nWhy the northern and southern lights appear to be so active right now\n\nThe breathtaking dancing shimmer of the aurora borealis and its counterpart in the southern hemisphere, aurora australis, dazzles those lucky enough to catch a glimpse of Earth's greatest light show.\n\nBy Katie Hunt, CNN\n\nWhy was the forecasted aurora a bust?\n\nNot unlike predicting how much snow a winter storm might bring, forecasters at NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center are working with many variables, and each has to line up just right to produce a significant event.\n\nTony Rice, NASA Ambassador\n\nSolar flare could make for green glow on the horizon Saturday night\n\nThe greatest effects of this geomagnetic storm are expected to arrive between 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. Saturday.\n\nSolar flare could make aurora visible into Virginia and North Carolina on Saturday night\n\nThe best viewing will be under the darkest skies. Look to the northern horizon between around 8 to 11 pm.\n\nTony Rice, NASA Ambassador"
