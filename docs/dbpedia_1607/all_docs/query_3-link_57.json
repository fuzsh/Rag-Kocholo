He and his wife Judy have been married for 30 years and have two adult children – Melissa, mom to his ‘awesome’ granddaughter Aurora, and Conner who was recently married in August 2017. Depending on the day of the week, Todd’s favorite Jack’s items include: a double cheeseburger with extra pickles, chicken fingers with Comeback sauce or a smoked sausage and egg biscuit.\n\nMatt joined Jack’s in October, 2016, and serves as Jack’s Chief Financial Officer. Prior to joining Jack’s, Matt worked in a variety of industries and with companies ranging in size from start-ups to global Fortune 10. Most recently, Matt was the CFO of CHEP North America, a leading global supply chain solutions company based in Atlanta. Prior to that role, Matt held a variety of progressively senior financial positions at Mrs. Fields, Savoy Pharmaceuticals, Kmart, and DaimlerChrysler. Matt holds a Masters of Business Administration degree from the Brigham Young University Marriott School of Management in Provo, Utah. He is married with five children and loves living in the Birmingham area and eating a delicious Big Bacon burger when he has the chance.\n\nBillie Jo Waara, Chief Marketing Officer, joined Jack’s in January 2020. She is responsible for overall brand positioning, marketing, creative, media and culinary product development for this Southern company. Since joining the team, Billie Jo has launched several strategic initiatives including key technology-enabled Guest occasions such as online ordering and loyalty rewards. She has led innovative marketing initiatives for several industries including hospitality, quick service restaurants, travel, tourism and retail for the past 20 years.\n\nPrior to joining Jack’s, Billie Jo served as the Chief Marketing Officer for other restaurant brands including Cicis Pizza and Taco John’s.

Waara graduated from Augustana College with a double major in Business Administration and International Government, and received her MBA from the University\n\nof South Dakota.\n\nBillie Jo and her family recently moved to Birmingham and are having fun exploring the area’s many hiking and biking trails–they usually stop by Jack’s for fried chicken, mashed potatoes and lemonade milkshakes on their way back home.\n\nIn her current role as Chief People & Strategy Officer, Dana Taylor leads all human resources and operations services functions while fulfilling her personal mission to make lives better for those who work at Jack’s.\n\nShe first joined the team in 2021 as Senior Vice President of Operations Innovation & Strategy, where she quickly implemented a data-driven approach for solving tough issues. She is passionately committed to making Jack’s the best possible — improving day-to-day efficiencies while building a runway to allow Jack’s teams to grow and develop into future roles.\n\nDana is a 15-year veteran who previously held finance, operations, innovation and strategy leadership roles with both Panera Bread and Bain & Company. She obtained her master’s from Harvard Business School and her bachelor’s in chemical engineering from the University of Texas. Her happy place is hiking or being at the beach with her husband, two daughters and their dogs. And while Jack’s famous biscuits are her absolute favorite, her daughters and husband can’t pass a Jack’s without asking for a milkshake!"
