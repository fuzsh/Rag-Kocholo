        "text": "Safety is a foundational value at Metrolink and is at the heart of our daily operations — from keeping our communities safe around our moving trains to ensuring our riders feel safe and secure throughout their journeys with us. Together, we can ensure everyone's safety on and around our trains.\n\nbe alert. Use all your senses at crossings.\n\nVehicles at train crossings and trespassers walking on tracks account for 95% of all rail-related deaths. Nearly all are preventable. Don’t become a statistic. Be aware of railroad tracks and crossing gates when walking or driving and follow these important, life-saving tips:\n\nNever walk around or behind lowered gates at a crossing and do not cross the tracks until the lights have stopped flashing.\n\nNever try to beat a train. Trains travel faster than they appear, and it takes the average train going 55 mph more than a mile to stop. By the time a locomotive engineer sees a person or vehicle on the tracks, it is too late.\n\nTrains can come from either direction so always look both ways at crossings.\n\nStay alert around railroad tracks. Don’t use your phone or wear headphones. Avoid any other distractions that would prevent you from hearing or seeing an approaching train.\n\nNever take photos or videos on or near railroad tracks. It’s not only dangerous, but it’s also illegal to be on the railroad right of way – this includes tracks, bridges, tunnels, signal towers and other facilities.\n\nMore than 50% of people who die while walking on railroad tracks have alcohol or drugs in their system. Always make responsible decisions with your safety in mind.\n\nThe following safety PDFs, in English and Spanish, are available to download or print.\n\nPersonal Safety Guidelines\n\nEmergency Evacuation Information\n\nAutomated External Defibrillators (AEDs)\n\nThere is an AED located on board every Metrolink train operating systemwide. An AED is a portable electronic device that automatically can diagnose certain life-threatening cardiac conditions and can treat them through the application of electricity. To view the Red Cross AED demonstration video, click here.\n\nOperation Lifesaver\n\nIncreasing the awareness of the potential dangers that exist at highway-rail grade crossings is an integral component of our safety education program. Therefore, we partner with Operation Lifesaver to maximize our impact on preventing highway rail grade crossing collision and trespass prevention.\n\nOperation Lifesaver’s mission is to end collisions, deaths and injuries at highway-rail grade crossings and on rail property through a nationwide network of volunteers who work to educate people about rail safety.\n\nOperation Lifesaver regularly provides speakers on railroad safety to visit with community groups, motorists, emergency responders, schools and professional drivers.
