        "text": "The Northern Lights are a stunning display of glowing, swirling lights in the night sky that have amazed humankind for thousands of years.\n\nThe UK has seen more activity in 2024 than in many recent years, as the Northern Lights splash vivid colours across the stars all throughout the country.\n\nBut what causes them? And how can you see them?\n\nWhat are the Northern Lights?\n\nThe Northern Lights - or aurora borealis - appear as bright, swirling curtains of lights in the night sky and range in colour from green to pink and scarlet.\n\nThe Southern Lights - aurora australis - are seen in latitudes near the South Pole.\n\nThe lowest part of an aurora is typically 50 miles (80 km) above the Earth's surface. The highest part could be 150 miles (800km) above the Earth.\n\nWhat causes the Northern Lights?\n\nBoth the Northern and Southern Lights are caused by charged particles from the sun hitting gases in the Earthâs atmosphere.\n\nThey occur around the North Pole when the solar wind carrying the particles interacts with the Earthâs magnetic field.\n\nThe most impressive auroras occur when the Sun emits really large clouds of particles called \"coronal mass ejections\".\n\n\"Picture this as a big sneeze by the Sun,\" says Dr Affelia Wibisono, from the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. \"It can contain up to a million tonnes of charged particles.â\n\nWhy can we see the Northern Lights so much in 2024?\n\nThe Northern Lights have been seen all across the UK in 2024.\n\nThis is thanks to the biggest geomagnetic storm since 2003, according to Sean Elvidge, a professor in space environment at the University of Birmingham.\n\nThe 2024 storm has been so powerful that, as well as lighting up the night sky, it interfered with satellites and power grids around the world.\n\nA flight from San Francisco to Paris was re-routed to avoid flying over the Arctic where solar radiation was stronger, explains Dr Elvidge.\n\nWhy are there different colours in the Northern Lights?\n\nDifferent gases produce different colours when energised.\n\nThe two most common gases in the Earth's atmosphere are nitrogen and oxygen. Oxygen atoms glow green - the colour most often seen in the Northern Lights.\n\nNitrogen atoms emit purple, blue and pink.\n\nThese colours are seen less often because nitrogen atoms are harder to energise than oxygen atoms. Only a really big ejection of solar particles produces this kind of display.\n\nSometimes the Northern Lights are scarlet. This is the colour seen when oxygen is energised by solar particles at very high altitudes.\n\nWhere can you see the Northern Lights?\n\nAccording to the British Geological Survey (BGS), the Northern Lights are seen most often in regions close to the North Pole such as Scandinavia, Greenland, Alaska, Canada and Russia.\n\n\"The bigger the coronal mass ejection from the Sun, the wider the area around the poles in which particles enter the atmosphere,\" says Prof Jim Wild from Lancaster University. \"Then, auroras will be seen in lower latitudes.\n\nâThey have been seen as far south as the Caribbean.\"\n\nWhere is the best place to see the Northern Lights in the UK?\n\nThey are visible in the far north of Scotland every few months, but less often further south.\n\nIn November 2023, the Northern Lights were seen across Shropshire and the West Midlands.\n\nThe greatest probability of seeing the Northern Lights is in Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England, according to Met Office space weather manager Simon Machin.\n\nHowever, only stronger geomagnetic storms are visible right across the UK. Large ejections of solar particles can mean the northern lights are sometimes seen as far south as Cornwall, Kent and Jersey.\n\nWhich month is best to see the Northern lights?\n\nAccording to the BGS, there are bigger Northern Lights displays around the equinoxes (March-April and September-October), because there are more magnetic storms during those periods.\n\nThe Southern Lights occur just as frequently as the Northern Lights, and are commonly seen across Antarctica.\n\nHowever, since relatively few people live in latitudes close to the South Pole, they are not as well-known as the Northern Lights.\n\nIs the Aurora Borealis the same as the Northern Lights?\n\nThe Aurora Borealis is the scientific name for the Northern Lights, named after the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek god of the north wind, Boreas.\n\nThe scientific name for the Southern Lights is the Aurora Australis after the Greek god of the south wind, Auster.\n\nWhat time are the Northern Lights visible?\n\nThe Northern Lights can be seen best at night with a clear sky.\n\nâThe brightest aurora are typically around 11pm to midnight local time,â according to Andy Smith, a researcher at Northumbria University working on using artificial intelligence to predict space weather.\n\nBe aware that they often wonât look as bright to the naked eye as they do in photos and video. Professional photographers often set their cameras to take in more light and make the displays look more spectacular.\n\nA team of space physicists at Lancaster University runs the social media account AuroraWatch UK on X, formerly Twitter, which lets people know when the Northern Lights might be seen in the UK.\n\nWhere is the best place to go on holiday to see the Northern Lights?\n\nThe Northern Lights form in an oval around the Earthâs north pole in an area called the auroral zone.\n\nAreas in the auroral zone include north Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Greenland, and Canada, the north of American state Alaska, and northern Siberia, in Russia.\n\nThis zone will bulge and move depending on the geomagnetic activity but Mr Smith said the most reliable locations are places like Scandinavia, Iceland and Canada."
