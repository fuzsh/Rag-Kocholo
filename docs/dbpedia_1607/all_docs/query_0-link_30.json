In southern Australia, the aurora australis, could also be visible from Victoria to Western Australia.\n\nWherever you are in the world we would like to see your pictures of the auroras from Monday. When and where did you see them? If they are uncommon where you live, how did it feel to glimpse a sighting?\n\nThis Community callout closed on 9 April 2024."
