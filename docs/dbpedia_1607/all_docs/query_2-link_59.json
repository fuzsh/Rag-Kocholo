        "text": "The impetus for this crazy project was to match the Victorian one first posted on this blog – and specifically respond to the problem created in NSW by having the airconditioned S and Z cars on the standard gauge returned to the broad gauge for internal VR workings…and worse…to commandeer the three RUB sets tasked to work the Intercapital Daylight Express to serve NE Victoria as part of their work.\n\nThis delivered on the challenge of ensuring all passenger trains beyond Melton, Sunbury, Craigieburn, Werribee, Cranbourne and Pakenham were air-conditioned.\n\nTo ensure consistency with the VR Counterfactual timetable, this PTCNSW Southern Network timetable needs to incorporate specific the four specific departures to/from Melbourne daily, plus the Southern Aurora, plus the need to have a Riverina Express connecting at Tocumwal (which, readers will recall, meets a train that was deleted in 1975 reality).\n\nThe classic Bradley Matthews shot of the imposter entering God’s Country to connect with the “Riverina Express” Tocumwal Division. Of course it is not an old photo, but one could imagine.\n\nIt should not be forgotten that the Riverina Express, originally to be operated by the self-propelled Tulloch cars and discussed in more detail here, should have presaged the beginning of a new service model, and for reasons that are nothing to do with the model and everything to do with the reliability of the rolling stock, that door was closed and a different door, involving XPTs and buses, was opened instead.\n\nThe Southern Routes kept in this scenario are:\n\nSydney-Canberra-Cooma\n\nSydney-Harden-Young-Cowra (first introduced here)\n\nSydney-Cootamundra-Temora-Wyalong\n\nSydney-Junee-Narrandera-Griffith\n\nSydney-Junee-Narrandera-Tocumwal\n\nSydney-Albury-Melbourne\n\nThe glaring omissions from this for some readers would be Lake Cargellico, the Tumut service and Hillston which were to be served by the Tullochs (if any readers are aware if the Tullochs ever reached these locations, and any photographic evidence is available, please comment).\n\nLake Cargellico is too close to Condobolin on the Broken Hill line to merit its own service. Tumut, while it would be a perennial favourite for fans, would only capture one significant town on route, Gundagai, a stop for the interstate buses that provide overwhelming competition. Others like Bombala are just not credible destinations.\n\nSydney-Canberra-Cooma\n\nThe Canberra service is still with us today, and in fact had a brief moment in the sun when the Statens Järnvägar X2000 cars were brought over from Sweden to operate a test tilt train, beating previous transit times and providing a new level of onboard service not seen outside the liner trains.\n\nA standard of comfort and style as yet unknown to Australian rail: SJ X2000 interior and on the tilt.\n\nThe actual 1970s timetables were very poor. The hodge-podge of services provided at the start of the decade included the signature Canberra-Monaro Express, an 8-car DEB set dividing at Queanbeyan but therefore denying people from Canberra or Cooma from visiting the other. The impact of having Canberra on a small spur line drove this. This was later replaced with a single 4-car DEB unit going to Cooma via Canberra, lengthening the journey but enabling Cooma people to travel to Canberra.\n\nOther trains included an overnight Mail train, a separate goods train with passenger cars and the movement of the VAM car that was ultimately to become part of the Vinelander (see here) but in those days can from Canberra to Melbourne.\n\nAnd for fun, it is worth mentioning the service south of Cooma to Bombala, passenger cars behind a goods and the Pay Bus.\n\nTime was certainly not of the essence, and the service did not do justice to Canberra’s role as the nation’s capital. Nor did it recognise the emergence of Cooma as both the heart of the massive Snowy Mountains Project and also the emerging skiing industry, which was aimed at the wealthiest class.\n\nBob Richardson photo Cooma line\n\nInterestingly the Canberra-Monaro DEBs were the fastest point to point time from Sydney to Goulburn, and this is preserved as the proposed times in this timetable. The aim of this timetable is to produce:\n\nDay in town travel between Sydney and Canberra both directions\n\nOne cycle of day time Cooma to Sydney and back night time (like Mildura to Melbourne) running all year\n\nAnother cycle of day time Sydney to Cooma and back night time, seasonally.\n\nA side aim, as was espoused in the Victorian example, is to provide some useful benefits from the main schedule, where possible:\n\nScheduled school travel to larger towns on route from smaller stations\n\nCapacity for Goulburn to have a fixed headway service to Sydney, when combined with the other routes through Goulburn\n\nCommuter travel from Goulburn to Canberra (this is still being talked about in 2018).\n\nDiversion Time: Ski Train\n\nIn the Victorian counterfactual two train services were proposed that took full advantage of Victorian geography to run weekend excursion trains, aimed up-market, to the Mt Buller and Mt Hotham/Falls Creek fields, each taking roughly five to six hours but providing service and entertainment for those hour. Leaving Melbourne after work on a Friday, plying the paying public with Gluehwein and beer prior to arriving in Mansfield or Bright, then being buses to motels ahead of the next days skiing, with a Sunday return.\n\nIn the PTCNSW example, the logical ski train would run to Cooma, but would be an overnight train leaving Friday night, so that cashed up skiers could have a full meal and a good sleep before an early start on Thredbo or Perisher fields.\n\nThe idea of a gay bistro is truly fascinating for 1963!\n\nThe 1970s marked the blossoming of NSW skiing. The legendary Mt Stilwell and Charlottes Pass Chairlift had long passed into memory but the blossoming of Canberra under Whitlam brought a lot more people closer to alpine skiing. The drive from Sydney was as bad as ever, and had PTCNSW bothered to run a train that cashed up people might have used, rather than the four or five that they did run that nobody with cash would ever want to use, it might have entrenched itself enough to be there to this day.\n\nThis is not a ridiculous fantasy – Denver people have reinstated the Winter Park Ski Train previously run by the Denver and Rio Grande, and Denver people already the choice of motorway-standard road to the resort.\n\nAs in the Western Network timetable, running 7 or 8 car trains to line termini is overkill by 1975. The Vline approach of 3 cars as standard makes more sense, even if in NSW it is likely that two or three sets of 3 cars are likely to be combined along a shared section of the mainline, for usually at least 5 hours from Sydney.\n\nThe Canberra and Cooma service is problematic because Canberra is merely a short spur from Queanbeyan and neither option of dividing the trains separately, as happened until the early 1970s, or running them into Canberra then back to the junction before going on, holds any joy.\n\nDEB sets, as were used, makes both options more feasible than loco-hauled.\n\nHowever, the possibility of running into Canberra as a diversion with loco-hauled could be made more likely by attaching a second locomotive to the ‘back’ end of the train between Queanbeyan and Canberra, if only to pilot the train in what would be its ‘reverse’ direction. Hence on the down run from Sydney, the train locomotive would haul the train all the way to Canberra, but here a small locomotive, eg a 73 class from the yard, would attach to the front to pilot the train back to Queanbeyan with its main locomotive still attached to the rear. At Queanbeyan, the 73 would cut off and the train proceed conventionally hauled to Cooma. A triangle/wye at Queanbeyan would also help.\n\nBob Richo Cooma line\n\nHence for the Canberra day-return trips, 4 DEB cars will be used (this appears straightforward) but for the day return and overnight Cooma runs, an unexpected set of cars, either 3 or 6 cars depending on day and season would be used (see below). These cars would stay fitted for sleeping and dining as befits the market, with some sitting capacity for their day returns. When not seasonally required for the Ski run, they would head north (to be covered in future chapters).\n\nSydney-Albury-Melbourne\n\nThis was covered at length in the Victorian counterfactual scenario. With the focus on the NSW side of the border, it suffices to add that it is assumed that while much of the demand on the Intercapital Daylight Express and Spirit of Progress trains is for travel the full length of the route, and much of the demand is for travel from Melbourne to Benalla, Wangaratta, Albury/Wodonga (and for this reason, a third train runs on the broad gauge, the Hume and Hovell).\n\nTherefore capacity opens up for a down train as it drops its passengers from Melbourne in Victorian towns and into NSW, for the train to take on passengers from NSW towns. But as with the Hume and Hovell, the need for an additional train from Albury towards Sydney exists. Two cycles are provided, a day and overnight in each direction using four-car DEBs.\n\nIt would be cute for this train to connect with the broad gauge train (though questionable because if the connection dovetailed too well, the question would arise why it wasn’t a through train). However there is little practicality to the idea. The obvious gap in the timetable from Albury on the up is in the morning. The Intercapital Daylight Express, leaving Melbourne at 11:45 does not reach Albury till mid-late afternoon, but a suitably early departure from Albury around 08:00-0:900 would have a connection from Melbourne at an unreasonable time.\n\nNot the ski train, but looking like it, a 45 heading a 1965 Riverina Express in snow at Goulburn, credited to O Jacobson in Railway Digest.\n\nAnd the mooted Hume and Hovell, reaching Albury at 22:45 after providing a day in Melbourne for residents of Victoria’s North East, would not usefully connect with a PTCNSW train (the Spirit of Progress runs only 2 hours after this, capturing much the same potential patronage.)\n\nSydney-Junee-Narrandera-Griffith and Narrandera-Tocumwal\n\nAs noted previously the decision to retain Tocumwal could be contentious. Demand for a service would probably low among the total list of lines retained. The area is fairly remote, and ominously, being so close to Victoria, the Victorian train would probably be the more appealing. Hence it is crucial to maintain a connection at Tocumwal so that local traffic from Jerilderie and Narrandera towards Melbourne might find it useful.\n\nThis scenario sees the fourth self-propelled Budd, with the fifth (trailer) car converted to self-propelled operation for backup, available to operate a connecting service between Junee or Narrandera and Tocumwal.\n\nThe defining feature of the Narrandera-Tocumwal line was its lengthy trestle across the Murrumbidgee and its floodplane, now sadly falling to ruin. The last train movement on the line was inadvertant -some wheat wagons ran away from the yard and headed in that general direction before derailing (wikipedia photo)\n\nAs with other services in the 10-12 hour transit time from Sydney, the aim is to provide 2 cycles per 24 hours, with some cycles potentially not working on some days of the week to provide for fleet servicing. Small stops have been eliminated, leaving only the current Xplorer stops on the Griffith route and headline towns on the Tocumwal line.\n\nBeautiful big Jerilderie Station in contemporary NSWGov photo.\n\nThe Griffith route survived with the self-propelled Budds connecting with XPTs on the mainline until 1986, and was resuscitated first as a loco-hauled service as in this photo, and when the second batch of Countrylink Xplorer cars arrived, they were pressed into a weekend-only service which seems pretty token, but at the moment it is better than nothing.\n\nRolfe Bezier photo, that could have been the Griffith bound Riverina Express in 1975, except it was the Griffith train 20 years later, the HQ in the foreground would be less beaten up in those days one would imagine.\n\nHarden-Young-Cowra\n\nThe Cowra service was discussed with limited detail in the Western chapter. Cowra people already have 3 cycles daily via the Western route however only one of these cycles provides the people of Young with access to the rest of the network.\n\nYoung is another one of those beauties among railway stations, that sadly will probably not see another train – despite recent announcements to the contrary by NSWGov. Govt photo.\n\nAt least one other cycle is required, this is provided by a diversion of the Wyalong service (below) that extends the journey to Wyalong. It uses both sides of the Demondrille triangle to avoid shunting Harden. To avoid a second shunt, this service does not stop at Cootamundra which would also require the shunt, but stops at Coota West with passengers provided with a taxi if needed.\n\nSydney-Cootamundra-Wyalong\n\nRetaining the Wyalong service is an even more contentious notion than even the Tocumwal service, where the proposed Victorian connection provides a fig leaf or spurious rationale for retention.\n\nBut looked at as a whole, it retains connectivity for Temora and Wyalong, as well as boosting the service out of Cootamundra, Harden and Yass for the other services that by this point would go over to buses.\n\nOne service diverts via Young in one direction, adding one hour to the journey overnight, but this does not reduce the appeal of the service, as it is when most people would be asleep. This service takes one sideof the Demondrille triangle to Young, where the set reverses and takes the other side towards Cootamundra.\n\nThere is the possibility of further reducing the complexity of such a move by not serving Cootamundra station, but Cootamundra West. However, on balance given the reversibility of the DEB sets it makes sense to have a second reversal at Cootamundra main station.\n\nStockinbingal saw a small number of diverted Griffith Xplorer services in contemporary times. Neither Stockinbingal or Temora were revenue stops; but trains helpfully stopped for safeworking and afforded the railfan passengers the chance to inspect the remaining facilities at Stockinbingal. Photo David Johnson used with permission.\n\nIt is a pleasing memory that the passenger services continued beyond Wyalong in the early 1980s, but definitely not worth retaining in this scenario. Lake Cargellico has the same rationale as Eugowra would, but on a different chord of the network. That is, it would be easier for Lake Cargellico travellers to be bussed to either Condobolin or Forbes where a better service awaits, just as Eugowra people would be infinitely better off making their way to Cowra or Forbes if they wish to catch the train.\n\nContemporary photo of the line at Wyalong, showing it in as good fettle as it would have had in 1975. Apart from needing new stations at Barmedman and Wyalong, and major repairs to Stockinbingal, such a service could be easily restarted. Photo sourced from ABC to avoid needless infringement of rail fans’ copyright.\n\nTemora has been fortunate in recent years, while no scheduled passenger trains pass here any more, the SMUT specials, various other specials and charters and three Countrylink Xplorer services deliberately sent that way while the Junee section was closed; all have graced the magnificent restored station. National Trust photo.\n\nThe timetable\n\nThe proposed timetable is balanced to provide as regular a departure from Sydney to each destination as possible.\n\nGoulburn has eight air-conditioned departures a day (not counting the Southern Aurora), or one every few hours.\n\nCanberra has three departures a day including the crucial “day in Sydney” return service. The Cooma trains as noted above, are piloted in reverse from Queanbeyan to Canberra or vv.\n\nCootamundra and Junee have five down trains a day, also with a reasonably balanced spacing. Wagga and Albury achieve four trains a day (also not counting the Southern Aurora).\n\nFinally, the Griffith via Narranderra, Wyalong and Tocumwal routes achieve 2 cycles each day.\n\nOne of the down trains comprises DEB sets amalgamated for the mainline run, with cut-offs taking place at both Harden and Junee.\n\nProposed southbound timetable. Note the footnotes covering connections to the Victorian Railways services shown here.\n\nRolling Stock\n\nWith the three RUB sets devoted to ICD/SOP service and the failure of the Tullochs to work motorised, PTCNSW is left somewhat short. NSWGR had previously also been left short on two other orders – the Ebasco Report recommending the U sets be gutted of their air-con, and the truncation of the Brisbane Ltd order which at least created the Budds.\n\nIn the chapter on Illawarra services here the Tulloch operation is discussed; in the West chapter here the operation of three self-propelled Budds is discussed, as is the removal of the Silver City Comet sets and replacement with stainless steel Indian Pacific cars configured for sitting and attached to the IP.\n\nTwo RUB sets, split in half, provide an up and back twice daily service to Dubbo and Forbes. The first V sets provide an air-conditioned link between Sydney and Mt Victoria that saves the Budds having to enter Sydney.\n\nThe rolling stock pool is thus seriously depleted. Two ingenious solutions are proposed.\n\nPending more rolling stock orders (ideally versions of the successful WAGR Prospector cars) the Silver City Comet cars are pressed into service in the South to provide air-conditioned comfort on the lesser routes, just as the elderly E set cars in Victoria get to see out their days in that scenario.\n\nEight of nine possible DEB four car sets are required for the proposed southern timetable, working to Canberra on a return daily basis as well as to Albury, Griffith and Wyalong. The ninth is needed to rotate for maintenance.\n\nDiversion Time: The DEBs (900/800 class)\n\nNSWGR themselves built the DEB air-conditioned rail cars in early 1950s and apart from some early dramas with the power plant, resolved by 1975, they were tough and enduring, working to the furthest reaches of the state. Places like Bourke, Coonamble, Cobar, Walgett and Tenterfield as well as some of these southern routes – where they had worked to Griffith and Albury at different times.\n\nAside from the thirty six driving and trailer cars already spoken for in this scenario, three trailer cars designed for parcels traffic, would no longer be needed in the scenario as from 1975 only a single Budd travels out to Nyngan. These cars would be rebuilt in the scenario to build up the passenger-carrying fleet. Finally, to boost the flexibility of the arrangements, a few of the non air-conditioned 600-700 sets would be rebuilt as follows to enable more three-car sets to be deployed:\n\nThe power plant in the 600 class driving motor carriage replaced with the same Cummins-Voith package that has become standard across the Australian scene, and consistent with the eventual repowering of the DEBs.\n\nThe middle car being a former DEB trailer rebuilt for this purpose, and fitted with a small buffet area.\n\nThe 700 class driving trailer as well as the 600 to be air-conditioned, with the 700 fitted with first class couchette fitout as suggested for the RUBs\n\nThe absence of power from one car of three should not trouble the DEBs on the south. The Wyalong and Griffith routes are lightly grade; the Cummins NTA-855 produces considerably more output than the GMs they replaced, and the cars would be coupled at a minimum of 9 cars to transit the steeply graded main line.\n\nWith the DEB fleet expanded thus to at least 12 3 or 4 car sets, maintaining the southern routes should be much more straightforward.\n\nThe surprise held over from above: In this scenario, PTCNSW would acquire a set of the Wegmann cars from Commonwealth Railways (soon to be Australian National Railways). At this point the Wegmann cars are not particularly old, of similar age to the RUB/HUB cars and younger than the N set cars (N and Z) in the Vline consists of today.\n\nDiversion Time: The Wegmann Cars\n\nChris Drymalik’s ComRails website is an ideal reference on these cars. Most Australian rolling stock came from a set of usual suspects – Commonwealth Engineering later Comeng/ABB/Adtranz and finally Bombardier; or the Clyde/Downer/Walker; Goninan or Tulloch stables.\n\nOnly the special few came from further afield, and usually if it came from Continental Europe it was some sort of track machine or specialist vehicle.\n\nBut the Commonwealth Railways in the early 1950s broke with the pack and sourced cars from the German manufacturer Wegmann. This company has since become part of the empire that also contained Krauss, famous to many fans of the small industrial locomotives used on sugar and other lines around Australia.\n\nTwenty-odd cars were ordered in all. They were absolutely the ‘bees knees’ when they arrived, with air-conditioning through out, a classic blend of the finest of old styling of mahogany and birch, with the new in the way of aluminium and double glazing.\n\nA mainstay of the Trans-Australian when it ran from Port Pirie to Kalgoorlie, and briefly, Perth, they were replaced on the prime run by the Indian Pacific stainless steel cars in 1970. They lingered on the old Ghan from Port Pirie to Marree and a separate set on the narrow gauge to Alice Springs.\n\nEven in miserable old age, this car’s German origins are clearly visible.\n\nBasil Fawlty might have cautioned “don’t mention the war” but of course the story of these cars involves Nazi Germany. The shape and line of the CR cars are quite clear in the Deutsche Reichsbahn set that the Nazis commissioned to run from Berlin to Dresden prior to the war. This set later served for Wehrmacht officers and then for transporting the wounded.\n\nPostage stamp of the Henschel-Wegmann set.\n\nPost-IP the Wegmann cars started to find their way into the ‘miscellaneous’ category of departmental usage that often happens before retirement.\n\nIn this scenario, these spares would be leased by PTCNSW: cars, crews, GM locomotive and all, for operation within NSW. Sufficient would remain in SA for the Ghan, until its replacement, by the stainless steel cars, on the Tarcoola route.\n\nIn summary, a fully air-conditioned service is built out of two cycles daily of DEB cars to Albury, Griffith and Wyalong; a marginal service to Young through extending the Blayney Budd from Cowra, and one Wyalong trip taking a short detour from Demondrille; capacity on the PTCNSW-operated Intercapital Daylight Express and Spirit of Progress trains; a day-in-town DEB working from Canberra; and the Wegmann cars to Cooma.\n\nFinally, the fifth Budd works alternately a Junee-Tocumwal cycle (building Narrandera services to 3 daily) and a connection at Narrandera off the Griffith train daily.\n\nUnlike the Victorian Railways operation in the first counter-factual, most of the destinations are well-beyond the 4-5 hour ‘day in town’ zone, and require full-day or overnight operation, as shown in the table below:\n\nDestination Transit time Sydney Cooma 6:40 Sydney Wyalong 7:22 Sydney Griffith 9:06 Sydney Albury 8:01 Sydney Melbourne 12:00 Sydney Tocumwal 10:29 Sydney Canberra 4:30\n\nLayover time in Sydney is not wasted for the DEB and Wegmanns, as will be shown in the northern timetable which is the next chapter in this scenario.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED"
