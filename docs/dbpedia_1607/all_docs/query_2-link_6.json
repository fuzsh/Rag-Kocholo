        "text": "Four men and three women were admitted to Wangaratta hospital, five men and 10 women to Mooroopna, three men and seven women to Benalla and one man and 11 women to Euroa.\n\nRescue operations were under way within an hour of the crash. The State Disaster Plan was put into action and within two hours police, the army, ambulance officers, the Red Cross, and doctors were on the scene.\n\nThe deputy chairman of the Victorian Railways Commissioners (Mr. E. P. Rogan) said last night human error was probably the cause of the smash.\n\nState Cabinet will hear a report on Monday from the Minister for Transport (Mr. Wilcox) on the train crash.\n\nAnd the Chief Secretary (Sir Arthur Rylah) said yesterday an inquest would be held as soon as possible.\n\nThe two trains collided at 7.10a.m. as most of the passengers were preparing to eat breakfast.\n\nThe impact crushed the first two sleeping carriages, pinning most of the passengers in the wreckage. The third sleeping carriage and the dining and lounge cars were thrown from the track and finished on top of the express engine.\n\nAs screaming passengers in the first two carriages fought to free themselves an explosion rocked the train’s power van. Within minutes fire swept through seven carriages.\n\nPolice said some of the bodies might never be positively identified because they were so badly burned.\n\nBroke Windows\n\nWhen the fire swept through the carriages, passengers broke windows and jumped from the train. Others tried to free those who were trapped but were forced to leap for their lives when the heat became too intense.\n\nThe sound of the crash was heard three miles away and woke most of the people at Violet Town.\n\nA railway ganger a few hundred yards from the crash scene said the train seemed to explode on impact.\n\n“At first I thought she’d exploded,” he said. “But then I heard the people screaming. I yelled to my mate to come and help me.\n\n“We ran along the carriages breaking windows to let the people out. When she caught fire there was nothing we could do,” he added.\n\nThe fireman on the goods train, Armfried Bendeke, 27 of Wodonga, jumped from the guards van seconds before the crash. The train was travelling at more than 50mph when he jumped.\n\nMr. Bendeke, who broke his arm and was severely bruised, said he had looked up and saw the Aurora bearing down on his train.\n\n“When I hit the ground, the first thing I did was to run to the Aurora and smash windows,” he said. “It was not until I started to pull one of the passengers clear that I realized my arm was broken,” he said.\n\nPassengers who escaped from the leading sleeping cars told of a “slow motion” ride as the carriages were thrown from the track.\n\nOne of the survivors from the wrecked carriages, Mr. Alan Etherington, 42, of Emarald, said he was aware of “vicious” breaking and then a shattering jolt as the trains hit.\n\n“It all seemed so unreal at first. I braced myself and then we seemed to stop in time. The carriage seemed to turn slowly and then crashed with a roar on its side.\n\n“I found myself standing naked in the corridor. The conductor was nearby. There were people screaming. I could hear children crying.\n\n“Then the carriages caught fire. There seemed to be no way out. God knows how the conductor and I pulled ourselves from the wreckage.”\n\nThe Prime Minister (Mr. Gorton), in a special message last night, extended his sympathy to the injured and to the relatives of those killed in the crash.\n\n“I am sure all Australians are shocked at this terrible accid3ent and join me in an expression of sympathy,” he added.\n\nThe Governor-General (Lord Casey) sent a message to the Governor of Victoria (Sir Rohan Delacombe) saying both he and Lady Casey were appalled by the tragedy.\n\nAnd the Minister for Shipping and Transport (Mr. Sinclair) last night offered, on behalf of the Commonwealth Railways, to lend the NSW railways 14 cars to resume Southern Aurora services.\n\nMr. Rogan said last night the locomotive of the Southern Aurora had run through and damaged points at the Melbourne end of a siding half a mile from the crash scene.\n\nSignaling equipment was later tested and found to be in order, he said.\n\nMr. Rogan stressed that a Board of Inquiry was inquiring into the accident. He did not want to anticipate its findings.\n\nHe spoke after conferring by telephone with the Chairman of Commissioners (Mr. G. F. Brown) who flew to the scene early in the morning and spent all day there.\n\nHe said the Victorian Railways’ signaling system was equal to the best in the world.\n\n“Without anticipating the findings of the inquiry a human error probably was the cause of the accident,” he said.\n\nHe described as “magnificent” the response by the rescuers.\n\nHorror in survivors’ stories\n\nA woman who moaned gently, “I’m dying… Oh God, I’m dying.”\n\nA little girl who started to cry because she saw some blood on her mother.\n\nA trapped nun crying for help.\n\nThree busloads of people who know now the anatomy of horror arrived in Melbourne late yesterday from the Southern Aurora. Many were dirty, some were blood-stained. Most blurted out their own special impression of the disaster.\n\nOne of them, Carl Amer – just 10 weeks old and unhurt – will one day be told about his place in the disaster.\n\nThis is how newly-wed Jeff Culnane, 26, of South Yarra, will remember it:\n\n“My wife just broke down and cried. The flames were everywhere. The carriage was filled with smoke. All I could see was two carriages piled up like a steeple; the rest were bent like a banana.\n\n“We were reading in bed when the crash came. Ours was the second carriage from the front. A severe jolt sent my wife flying off the bed on to the floor.\n\n“The carriage started to fill with smoke. People were running everywhere. The noise was fantastic.\n\n“Someone smashed a window. We climbed out and we could see other cars in flames.”\n\nMrs. Tom Watson and her family searched the wrecked carriages for survivors,\n\n“We got the children clear and no one appeared to be hurt. One woman did have a broken toe and she had to be helped down,” she said.\n\n“My husband heard a nun crying for help. She must have been in tremendous pain. The confusion was frightening. A guard came along and asked if everyone was all right.”\n\nCoral Keane from New South Wales wandered around the crash scene in a daze.\n\n“My husband was taken from the spot by ambulance. I was so worried. I didn’t know how badly he was hurt, although he kept saying he was all right,” she said.\n\nEighteen-year-old Allan Pembshaw, of Enfield, SA, was one of those who brought blankets out to injured people lying around inside and outside of the wreck.\n\nHe had been travelling to Melbourne with his friend Phillipa Burges, also 18, of Asquith, NSW.\n\n“We were all thrown out about like tiny puppets. There was a rending, screeching sort of noise; people didn’t even have time to cry out. It was all so quick.\n\n“The carriages up ahead were a mess, a smoking, horrible mess.\n\n“We got out and the sight of it was sickening. There were people lying in smashed up carriages. I even saw one man pinned under a huge heap of smoking metal.\n\nPhillipa took up the story: “I was dazed. Frightened out of my wits. I saw this bloke walk up and collapse in front of me. He came to when, afterwards, we’d got him a blanket, and he started shaking like he had an advanced case of DTs.\n\nI could only see smoke and carriages piled up around us,” she said.\n\nOne man, who would only give his name as Peter, said he had watched helplessly as an elderly woman was thrown on to a pile of bouncing, jagged metal as the carriage shuddered under the impact.\n\n“There were a number of shuddering jerks after the initial impact,” he said. “I just caught a glimpse of an old woman opening a door, then there was another jerk and she fell out.\n\n“It is all sort of hazy now, but I do remember that large chunks of metal were bouncing on the ground outside and she fell straight towards them.\n\n“I never saw her again, although I spent at least two or three hours hunting around for her afterwards.”\n\nMrs. Clifford Harris, in her sixties, from Woombye, Queensland, had been sitting up in bed reading, but escaped with only shock.\n\nHer 65-year-old husband did not know for several hours what had happened to her.\n\nSnowy-haired Mrs. L. Hollingworth, 79, of Sydney, said she normally travelled by plane – “But I decided to go by train instead because of so many plane accidents recently.”\n\nMr. Frank Shank, of Hawthorn, had his arm slightly burnt when he stayed behind in a burning carriage long enough to help three people out.\n\nMaria Pickett, 19, a nurse at a psychiatric hospital at Orange, NSW, said she had just left carriage six to go to the dining car when the smash came.\n\n“Carriage six was sent right up into the air by the impact and all my luggage must have been burnt.\n\n“I helped as many people out of the train as possible, including a woman with a broken pelvis. Then I collapsed myself.\n\n“The young people did not seem to be doing enough to help the injured, but they were probably suffering from shock.”\n\n“There was no slamming on of breaks – just a crash,” said Mr. Frank Muldready, 66, of Sydney, “I was with my wife in the dining car. We were badly jolted, but not injured.\n\n“We felt something going overhead – it must have been the carriage ahead buckling on the dining car roof.”\n\nAfter many hours the smash was still causing dread in those who wait for news of relatives and friends."
