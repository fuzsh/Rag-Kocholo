Arthur Levinson is an American businessman who serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors for Apple Inc. He has served on their board since 2000, making him one of the longest-serving directors at Apple. His net worth is estimated to be around $1.2 billion, and he owns about 0.029% of Apple stock, according to MarketScreener. Additionally, he also holds various options, which would increase his stake if exercised fully.

Tim Cook

Tim Cook (Timothy Donald Cook) is currently the CEO of Apple and was appointed to that position back in 2011 when Steve Jobs passed away. He owns about 0.021% of Apple’s shares, with a net worth of $1.8 billion. He reportedly received these stocks through various grants offered by the company throughout his tenure as CEO and executive vice president for worldwide sales and operations prior to becoming CEO.

Tim Cook as CEO of Apple

Tim Cook has served as CEO of Apple since 2011, when Steve Jobs retired from this position. His role involves leading all aspects of the business, including strategic planning, manufacturing processes, design, and product development. Before becoming CEO, Cook previously worked at IBM for a 12-year period, after which he went on to serve as COO at Intelligent Electronics for six years. From there, he would later join Apple in 1998 as Senior Vice President, under Jobs’ leadership. Since taking up this position at Apple, he has earned various awards, such as numerous Fortune Businessperson rankings throughout the last decade, along with the Financial Times Person of the Year in 2014.

Does Steve Jobs still own Apple’s stocks?

Steve Jobs no longer had any Apple shares after selling off his holdings when he left the company in 1985. He used the money from selling his stocks to purchase Pixar, which was sold to Disney in 2006, granting Steve Jobs an 8% stake in the company. When it comes to documents regarding the exact amount of stocks held by Jobs’ wife’s trust fund, there is conflicting data available; however, documents from 2011 (when Jobs died) indicate that 5,546,451 shares were still held by it at that time representing a 0.60% stake in Apple Inc. As this percentage has gone below 5%, there is no obligation for information about such ownership to be reported, making it difficult to know what Steve Jobs’ widow currently holds.

Does Steve Wozniak still own Apple’s stocks?

Steve Wozniak expressed multiple times his disinterest in investing and money matters and how they could potentially “corrupt one’s values”. In 2014 while talking about the release of the movie “Jobs” he declared that he had given away $10 million of his own stocks because it was the right thing to do. Fortune magazine articles about Wozniak’s net worth seem to place it around $100 million. Still, with this figure being expressed through stocks which will result in less than 5%, then it will not have been reported publicly, meaning we can’t determine if he still owns Apple shares.

Who Owns the Most Stock in Apple (Institutional Investors)?

According to Yahoo Finance, it is estimated that institutional investors own approximately 61% of Apple’s shares, while insiders hold just 0.07% collectively. According to CNN Business, individual stakeholders own about 0.35% of the company’s shares. Some major funds include Vanguard Group Inc., which currently holds around $157 billion (7.60%) worth of shares; Berkshire Hathaway Inc.; SSgA Funds Management; Capital Research & Management Co.; and BlackRock Fund Advisors, each representing over $500 million worth of shares, although exact stakes could change depending on market conditions at any given time.

History of Apple Ownership

Founding of Apple Inc

The history of Apple ownership dates back to the 1976 founding of Apple Inc., when Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne decided to start their own business. At the time, Jobs and Wozniak had already become friends through their involvement in the Homebrew Computer Club, and were looking for a way to turn their passion for technology into a business.

In April 1976, they founded Apple Computer Company (now Apple Inc.) in California with an investment of $1,350 in starting capital from them (Jobs had to sell his Volkswagen microbus, while Wozniak sold his Hewlett-Packard calculator). They created an initial partnership agreement that made Jobs and Wozniak equal partners with 50/50 stakes. The third partner, Ronal Wayne, was offered a 10% stake, but he soon backed out due to his concerns that the company wouldn’t be able to succeed, so he sold his 10%.

Founders/Initial Owners

Steve Jobs (1955-2011) and Steve Wozniak (1950-) were the original founders who brought together resources to create what is now one of the largest companies in the world – Apple Inc. Both came from humble beginnings; Jobs grew up by himself after his adoptive parents divorced, while Wozniak was raised by Polish immigrants living near San Jose. Despite their disadvantageous backgrounds, both excelled academically, which led them to meet at Cupertino Junior College; however, their working relationship did not begin until they met again at HP, where Wozniak was employed and Jobs was a summer employee.

At first, they weren’t planning on starting a business, but it eventually became clear that their skillset could make something special if put together properly, thus giving birth to what would later become Apple Inc. During those early days, both contributed significantly towards making sure everything ran like clockwork while trying relentlessly against all odds — calming down investors one day only so that complex logistics could be solved the next, etc.

Eventually, it paid off, resulting in over 35 years of being undoubtedly successful for everyone involved – especially the co-founders whose contributions are still memorialized today within Apple itself thanks to its name being suggested to Wozniak after Jobs visited an apple orchard, symbolizing the unity between the two men who left behind powerful legacies as entrepreneurs and providing valuable lessons about risk-taking amidst the uncertainty that even today’s tech innovators can learn from.

Contributions to the Company

The contributions made by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak cannot be underestimated when discussing how far Apple has come since its founding days in 1976. In addition to having great ideas about computers, such as creating ready-to-use systems instead of kits meant solely for hobbyists or engineers and only coming preassembled with specific capabilities directly related to people’s use cases, both co-founders also did most manual labor themselves during those early days, thus saving considerable amounts on overhead expenses! Through these efforts, they managed to successfully secure funding either through self-investing or obtaining outside investments throughout different stages until reaching IPO status, ultimately leading the company towards the wild success seen today.

Impact of Shareholders on Apple’s Decisions

Apple’s shareholders have a significant degree of influence on the company’s decisions. Major shareholders can affect decision-making processes at Apple as they own large percentages of the company’s stock, which can give them voting power when it comes to certain matters. As such, these major shareholders can exercise their influence over important corporate events, such as executive compensation and capital expenditure decisions. The actions taken by these major stakeholders can also shape investor sentiment and play an integral role in impacting strategic business decisions made by the company.

Shareholders are also able to call for special meetings and propose resolutions for consideration. Although Apple has traditionally had a decentralized approach with regard to decision-making, having multiple stakeholders with various interests involved in major corporate events allows different perspectives to be considered. This helps foster collaboration between investors, executives, and employees, which ultimately benefits the direction that Apple takes.

Conclusion

Apple is owned by a broad base of individual shareholders, as well as institutional investors and mutual funds. Its shares are one of the best investments in the world due to its high profile and long history of success. Since its creation in 1976, Apple has seen tremendous growth, and with the help of its lauded management team, it will continue to be one of the top technology companies around for years to come. However, despite its wide ownership base, ultimately it is up to those at the helm of Apple — Tim Cook, CEO, and Luca Maestri, CFO— to decide how Apple’s products are designed, marketed, and sustained over time.
