        "text": "Apple's Global Tax Strategy\n\nTo significantly reduce their worldwide tax liability, Apple has set up a financial operation (a subsidiary company) called Apple Sales International (ASI) which is registered within the Republic of Ireland (ROI) to benefit from a low corporate tax rate (12.5%).\n\nHaving registered ASI within the ROI, Apple has taken further advantage of the tax legislation within the ROI by negotiating a tax rate with the government. Since the tax position of ASI within the ROI is not strictly clear, as Apple operates in multiple countries, Apple has used this situation to negotiate a corporate tax rate of just 1.8%."
