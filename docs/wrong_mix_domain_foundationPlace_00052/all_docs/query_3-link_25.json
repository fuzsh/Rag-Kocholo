        "text": "Since time immemorial, the apple has been viewed in world folklore, literature, and history as a symbol of knowledge, power, and wealth. The twentieth and the twentieth-first centuries have given rise to a different type of apple ‚Äì the technology company Apple (AAPL) ‚Äì which retained its association with knowledge, power, and wealth.\n\nKnowledge: Since its inception in 1976, Apple has strongly emphasized knowledge, understood as the management of information and the creation of a material and nonmaterial environment where knowledge can thrive.\n\nPower: The company has also wielded considerable power in the technology world, creating products that outclassed and outsold those of its competitors. Apple‚Äôs founder, Steve Jobs, was named the ‚ÄúMost Powerful Person in Business‚Äù by Fortune and, in building his successful company, he drew on French and Raven‚Äôs six forms of power: legitimate, expert, reward, information, coercive, and referent. Tim Cook has appeared on Forbes‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe World‚Äôs Most Powerful People‚Äù list seven times.\n\nWealth: Apple became the first US company to hit a market cap of $3 trillion. By the end of his life, Jobs had a net worth of $10.2 billion. Tim Cook is considered the highest-paid CEO after Elon Musk: as of March 2022, his net worth was $2 billion. The Apple CEO earned $770.5 million in 2021 alone, as part of a 10-year grant of shares worth $1.7 billion. Apple is also giving him over $38 million in stock to stay with the company through 2025. And according to Business Insider, owning an iPhone or iPad shows that a person is wealthy and belongs to a higher-income class.\n\nOther facts and statistics further confirm the association between Apple and knowledge, power, and wealth. Continue reading to learn more about these notable characteristics of the company.\n\nApple Earnings üí∞üíπ\n\nInterested to see how Apple is currently performing? Check out the latest Apple earnings data.\n\nFacts about Apple\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nSome information about Apple might sound as though it‚Äôs been purposely made up to create a myth. And yet, everything in the below statistics is absolutely true:\n\nApple has a bigger cash hoard than Alphabet or Microsoft. In March 2022, Apple reported $202.5 billion in cash and investments. This is 7.4% of all the S&P 500‚Äôs cash. This amount is also nearly 4% up from 2021. By comparison, Alphabet presently holds $169.2 billion in cash and investments, while Microsoft has $132.3 billion, or 5% of the S&P 500‚Äôs cash pile.\n\nSeveral years ago, Apple had three times as much cash as the American government and over twice as much as the United Kingdom. In 2014, Apple reported that it had $158.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents plus short- and long-term securities. US Trust reported that the American government had just $48.5 billion in reserves in the same year.\n\nIn 2014, Apple made more money than Amazon, Google, and Facebook combined.\n\nThe Apple I was released in 1976 for a diabolical price of $666.66. Steve Jobs later explained that he chose this ominous number not because he wanted to hint at his demonic powers but because he loved repeating digits.\n\nApple‚Äôs Retina Display has increased the popularity of the iPad. Yet few iPad owners know that it is Samsung, one of Apple‚Äôs main competitors, that manufactures the display for Apple.\n\nApple was the first to create a digital color camera. Launched in 1994, it was called The Apple Quick Take 100 and cost less than $1,000. The camera packed a 640√ó480-pixel CCD and could store up to eight 640√ó480 images in the internal memory.\n\nBy 2011, the Apple iPhone accounted for 40% of the company‚Äôs annual revenue. It is also estimated that more than ¬æ of Apple‚Äôs income stems from products invented within the past 10 years.\n\nThe name iPod was inspired by the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nSources: Forbes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple Product Innovation 2024: M4 Chip\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nApple announced its M4 chip on Tuesday, May 7 at its ‚ÄúLet Loose‚Äù event. The chip will be coming to Apple‚Äôs next generation of devices, beginning with the iPad Pro. At the event, Apple also announced the redesigned 11-inch and all-new 13-inch iPad Air, which is ‚Äúsupercharged by the M2 chip.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHistorically, the iPad has been a testing ground for Apple products, a less scrutinized line that allows the company to experiment without the risks associated with doing the same with the iPhone or the Mac,‚Äù said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. ‚ÄúAgainst this backdrop, I do not think Tim Cook‚Äôs main aim here is to solve Apple‚Äôs sales problem with this line specifically but rather to lay the groundwork needed for better, more innovative products in the months ahead.\n\n‚ÄúThis means he can do two things with the iPad launch, which may be just as important as direct sales right now: test the functionalities of the new M4 chips at a less risky part of the operation and create tremendous expectations for future iPhone/Mac products. While the remaining features may have disappointed investors who were expecting more groundbreaking innovation, I think this puts Apple on the right path to reconquer sales growth in the mid-term via a (finally) working application of AI hardware-to-software direct integration,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúAlong with the recently announced buybacks and the positive sales in the company‚Äôs Mac division, this could very well drive investor sentiment back into the stock, supporting the company at a rather volatile moment in its recent history. If Tim Cook manages to show that the new chip line is finally the groundbreaking innovation for Apple products we have been waiting on for years; this could mark the start of Apple‚Äôs new growth cycle. However, real-world testing will be required, and that‚Äôs what the iPads are mainly here for.‚Äù\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple Event 2023\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nApple unveiled its iPhone 15 and new Series 9 Apple Watch during its annual September event on Tuesday, September 12. Here are a few facts about the new Apple iPhone 15 and the new Series 9 Apple Watch release:\n\nApple iPhone 15\n\nIt will come in four models: iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max.\n\nThe iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will have a 6.1-inch display, while the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will have a 6.7-inch display.\n\nAll four models are powered by the new A16 Bionic chip.\n\nThe Pro versions are expected to be powered by the new A17 Bionic chip.\n\nThe iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will have a dual-camera system on the back, while the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will have a triple-camera system.\n\nThe iPhone 15 starts at $799, the iPhone 15 Plus starts at $899, the iPhone 15 Pro starts at $999, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max starts at $1,199.\n\nPre-orders begin Friday, September 15, with availability beginning Friday, September 22.\n\nApple Watch Series 9\n\nIt comes in two models: Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 9 has a 41mm or 45mm display, while the Apple Watch Ultra 2 has a 49mm display.\n\nBoth models are powered by the new S9 SiP, which increases performance and capabilities.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 9 has a new double tap gesture, a brighter display, faster on-device Siri, and Precision Finding for iPhone.\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 comes with a titanium case.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 9 starts at $399, and the Apple Watch Ultra 2 starts at $799.\n\nThe watch will be available for purchase on September 22. You can pre-order the watch on the Apple website or at authorized retailers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple Statistics by 2022\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nSince its launch, Apple has sold over 1.3 billion iPhones worldwide.\n\nApple sold an average of 572,603 iPhones per day in 2018.\n\nThe number of iOS devices sold crossed the 2 billion mark in 2018.\n\nIn Q3 2019, the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR models accounted for 67% of all iPhone sales in the US, with the iPhone XR alone accounting for 48% of sales.\n\nIn 2019, Apple TV sales were 13 million.\n\nMac computers generated $9 billion in 2020.\n\nApple paid iOS developers $26.5 billion in 2020.\n\nApple sold more than 34 million Apple Watches in 2020.\n\nApple shipped 3.2 million iPhones to India in 2020.\n\nApple sold 194 million iPhones in 2020.\n\nApple sold 438 million products globally in 2020.\n\nMore than 70 million iPads were sold in 2020.\n\nApple shipped 15.5 million MacBooks in 2020.\n\nPeople bought 34 million Apple Watches in 2020.\n\nApple had the best-selling smartphones worldwide in 2021.\n\nIn Q1 2021, Apple sold 55.2 million iPhones.\n\nIn Q2 2021, the Wearables, Home, and Accessories category of Apple reached record revenues of $7.8 billion.\n\nMore than 100 million people use Macs globally.\n\nToday, the App Store has nearly 1.82 million apps, and developers continue to release new apps almost on a daily basis.\n\nApple brick-and-mortar stores welcome more than 1 million people per day.\n\nThe largest Apple store in the world is located in Amsterdam (27,000 square feet). Its upper floor features the world‚Äôs longest Genius Bar (82-foot-long) with seats for over 20 visitors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple Q2 2024 Earnings\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nApple reported its 2024 second-quarter earnings on Thursday, May 2, with EPS of $1.53, $0.03 better than the analyst estimate of $1.50. Revenue for the quarter came in at $90.8B versus the consensus estimate of $90.32B.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an earnings report that leaves no margin for doubt about Apple‚Äôs current state of affairs. More than ever in the past decade, the company needs new products and solutions that will shift its behemoth operating costs back into the sustained growth path,‚Äù said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. ‚ÄúAgainst this backdrop, Apple will need massive mid-term investor support and trust, which is why it announced its largest-ever round of buybacks. It‚Äôs certainly a great time to resort to this strategy as, on the one hand, the stock remains relatively fairly priced, and, on the other hand, it needs to garner solid support for a structural shift that may very well take several quarters to play out.\n\n‚ÄúThis should most likely refer to higher and better hardware-to-product AI integration, something that has already begun to show some success on a smaller scale on the Mac operation, which did surprisingly well despite the overall woes,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúHowever, the sustained downtrend in iPhone sales and pressured margins show that the revenue growth plateau is more than a regional problem and should keep on deepening without new, more innovative products.‚Äù\n\nThomas Monteiro, Senior Analyst at Investing.com\n\nWant to buy Apple Stock? üì±üìà\n\nInvest in Apple shares quickly and without hidden charges by checking out our list of the best broker and trading platforms.

Its annual revenue has also been consistently growing, as is reflected below:\n\nSource: Apple\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple‚Äôs Annual Revenue by Region\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nApple has always enjoyed its largest popularity in the US. The American region is accountable for 45% of all revenue generation. In Q2 2022, the Americas brought in net sales of $40.88 billion. Approximately 40% of the revenue comes from the United States alone. Europe and China are two other major markets for Apple, as is evident from the table below. . Americas brought in net sales of $39.81 billion in the fourth quarter of the company‚Äôs 2022 fiscal year.\n\nApple‚Äôs Revenue by Region, from 2015 to 2022 ($bn)\n\nSource: Statista\n\nAdvertisement\n\niPhone Statistics\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nAs Apple‚Äôs most popular and valuable product, the iPhone has been the company‚Äôs main source of revenue since 2008, a year after its launch. Apple‚Äôs invention of Watch and AirPods did not diminish the attractiveness of its iPhones. iPhone still accounts for 50% of the company‚Äôs revenue.\n\nDespite its unflagging popularity worldwide, iPhone has not shown a consistent increase in revenue. Apple had double-digit year-on-year iPhone growth from 2008 to 2015. From then to 2021, however, revenue stalled. The last year proved to be a breakthrough for iPhone: there was a significant jump in its sales, which brought revenue up by 39%. In the 2022 fiscal year, Apple surpassed $200 billion in iPhone revenue for the first time, hitting $205 billion.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2023, iPhone revenue was $65.78 billion, compared to the $68.78 billion analysts thought Apple would earn in this sector. The figure registers an 8.17% drop year over year. The challenging macroeconomic environment affected iPhone sales, Mac sales, and sales of wearables like the Apple Watch.\n\nThe table below reflects the uneven trajectory of iPhone revenue:\n\niPhone Revenue from 2008 to Q1 FY2023 ($bn)\n\nSources: Statista\n\niPhone Sales\n\nThe table below demonstrates that there has always been a direct correlation between iPhone revenue and its sales. Like its revenue, iPhone sales followed an upward trajectory between 2008 to 2015. Then, like revenue, sales decreased between 2016 to 2020, pushed down by fierce competition and the boycott of Apple‚Äôs products in China.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, known as a holiday quarter, Apple sold 2 million iPhones to India, which helped boost sales growth by 18% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. In Q4 2022, the iPhone 14 series caught 59% market share, followed by iPhone 13 series at 32% share. In 2021, Apple‚Äôs iPhone shipments in India during the same quarter increased by 8% on a year-over-year basis and 44% sequentially after Apple shipped 1.7 million units.\n\nYet, although Apple‚Äôs iPhone business pushed sales by over 9% annually, it disappointed analysts‚Äô expectations. Annually, however, Apple did better than other makers of smartphones. In 2022, the company clocked in its highest-ever shipment share of 18%. Its revenue share also topped the revenues of other companies, reaching 48% of the entire smartphone market. Apple‚Äôs operating profit share skyrocketed to a staggering 85%.\n\nAt the end of fiscal 2022, several factors negatively influenced Apple‚Äôs sales of the iPhone. The most damaging of them were weeks-long issues with iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max production that carried over to Black Friday and made the iPhones unavailable to consumers.\n\nAnother culprit on which Apple‚Äôs CEO blamed poor sales was the challenging microeconomic environment. Inflation increased Apple products‚Äô prices, especially outside the United States. For many people, iPhones thus became simply unaffordable. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, sales of iPhones slipped 8% to $65.8 billion.\n\niPhone Annual Sales from 2008 to Q1 FY2023 (mm)\n\nSources: Statista\n\niPhone Sales by Region\n\niPhone has always been an incredibly popular smartphone in the United States and Europe. Americans and Europeans have been purchasing iPhones with nearly unwavering devotion.\n\nIn China, by contrast, sales have consistently fallen since 2015. Trump‚Äôs trade war on China and export blacklisting of Huawei were responsible for Chinese citizens‚Äô boycotting of Apple‚Äôs products. By 2019, it had become embarrassing to use iPhones in mainland China. In his letter to Apple investors published in 2019, Tim Cook squarely put the blame for ‚Äúover 100 percent of [Apple‚Äôs] year-over-year worldwide revenue decline‚Äù at China‚Äôs doors. The tide in China turned for Apple only in 2021, when iPhone sales received a boost in the country.\n\niPhone Sales by Region from 2015 to 2021 (mm)\n\nAdvertisement\n\niPhone Usage\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nPeople around the globe prefer iPhones over Androids for several reasons, the most crucial of which is security. Information security companies agree that Apple devices are more secure than Android ones. Forbes reported once that 97% of smartphone malware targets Android phones. Another reason why people are drawn to the iPhone is its ease of use. All the apps on the iPhone are launched from the home screen, and all the settings are found under one menu. As it is generally considered that only the wealthy can afford an iPhone, people also feel good about themselves when buying an Apple smartphone. Thanks to the iPhone‚Äôs usability, advanced security, and prestige, Apple adds more active iPhone users every year. It is estimated that at the beginning of 2022, over a billion people in the world used iPhones. At the beginning of 2023, there were 1.74 billion iPhone users worldwide.\n\nThe table below reflects an upward trend in the number of active iPhone units since 2008:\n\nTotal Number in Active iPhone Units from 2008 to Q1 2023 (mm)\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nAdvertisement\n\niPad Statistics\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nLovers of the iPhone eagerly awaited the appearance of the iPad on the market once its launch was announced in 2010. Therefore, its introduction to the public was an immediate success, adding $19 billion to Apple‚Äôs revenue in the first year. Once the iPad Mini was launched in 2013, iPad sales jumped even higher. As about 97 million people immediately rushed to buy the iPad Mini, 2013 has so far remained the record year for Apple. Then, Apple‚Äôs iPad revenue reached the highest mark of $31.9 billion. Apart from that peak year, iPad revenue has remained between $18 to nearly $30 billion. In the 2022 fiscal year, iPad brought in $29 billion, down from $31.8 billion in fiscal 2021.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, iPad revenue reached $7.17 billion, missing estimates of $7.94 billion. In Q1 2023, the revenue was down by 13.06% year-over-year. Overall, in the 2022 fiscal year, iPad brought in $29 billion, down from $31.8 billion in fiscal 2021. The first quarter of fiscal 2023 presented a brighter picture. iPad celebrated its strongest quarter since 2014, and Services broke $20 billion for the first time. iPad brought the company $9.4 billion this quarter, up 30%. Tim Cook announced that Apple hit 2 billion active devices for the first time, adding that over half of iPad customers and two-thirds of Apple Watch buyers were new to the platforms at the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis trend is seen in the table below:\n\niPad Annual Revenue from 2011 to Q1 2023 ($bn)\n\nSources: Statista\n\nAdvertisement\n\niPad Sales\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nThe first year of the pandemic proved to be highly profitable for the company, partly because of a notable increase in iPad sales. In 2020, people bought 57% more iPads than in 2019, needing them for working and learning from home. Apple CEO Tim Cook remarked then that the company had ‚Äúthe strongest product line-up in both Mac and iPad that [it] ever had.‚Äù During the second quarter of 2022, Apple shipped about 12.6 million tablets worldwide, showing growth in comparison to the first quarter of 2022.\n\nThe fourth quarter of 2022 proved to be challenging for the company. Apple‚Äôs iPad was hampered by supply issues and decreased 10% year-over-year, becoming the company‚Äôs most minor individual line of business. The iPad brought in $29.2 billion for the year, down from the $31.8 billion in sales Apple saw in 2021. Supplies were constrained, and iPad lost some of its popularity. To attract customers‚Äô attention to its product, Apple refreshed the iPad Air in March but failed to introduce a new design, concentrating on adding an M1 chip. iPad sales dipped sharply to under $7.2 billion versus nearly $8.3 billion a year earlier.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the tide changed for iPad. Its performance was more impressive. The primary catalyst for the rise of iPad sales was the launch of several new iPad products in October 2022. The 10th generation iPad came in four colors, and the new iPad Pro was equipped with Apple‚Äôs novel M2 chip. Boosted by the release of this relatively inexpensive model, iPad sales grew nearly 30% year-over-year to $9.4 billion.\n\nThese figures are presented in the table below:\n\niPad Annual Sales from 2011 to Q1 2023\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple‚Äôs Achievements in 2022\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nThe tech giant released some valuable additions to its products in 2022. Far from inventing innovative devices, Apple tried to keep existing elements and added new spins to them. It introduced functional upgrades to take its previous innovations to a higher level. In March 2022, it brought to people‚Äôs attention a wide range of devices, the most notable of which became the iPad Air 5. The M1 chip, the most powerful and fastest Mac chip, was inserted into the relatively affordable iPad and boosted its efficiency.\n\nAnother memorable event of 2022 was the introduction of the M1 Ultra chip. Exclusive to the all-new Mac Studio, this computer offers an unrivaled powerful version of the M1 Pro and M1 Max. WWDC22 is also noteworthy. In 2022, Apple launched the first developer betas for iOS 16, iPadOS, macOS Ventura, and watchOS 9. By upgrading its operating system, Apple gladdened the hearts of many customers with these products.\n\nAlthough 2022 was devoted mainly to software releases, there were still significant, eagerly expected, new launches. People worldwide were offered the iPhone 14 Pro, MacBook Air M2, Mac Studio, and Apple Watch Ultra.\n\nApple‚Äôs creative strategies will push it forward in 2023. Analysts expect iPhone 15 Pro to be effectively updated. Customers can finally applaud the debut of the highly anticipated mixed-reality headset. They can welcome, in 2023, the new Mac Mini, iMac, Mac Pro, MacBook Air 15, and MacBook Pro 14/16 models. And considering Apple‚Äôs inventiveness, it may also be that it will surprise its users, treating them to devices they did not see coming at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConclusion\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nApple has long been the most formidable company in the technology sector. Its products are well-loved by global consumers, and Wall Street seems to favor the company over other tech giants. Apple‚Äôs 5G iPhone continues captivating people‚Äôs minds, and there is no predicting what new fascinating product Apple is going to pull out of its hat next. Seeing how consistently Apple stock has outperformed over the last three years, analysts foresee a brilliant future for the company. While AAPL is trading at $163.62 at the time of writing, a general consensus is that its shares might reach $330 by 2025. Investors expect that whatever it does, Apple will always have a major advantage over its competitors because it has knowledge, power, wealth, and a clear vision of the future, and, so well-equipped, will be able to make a bold, successful move in any direction it chooses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInvestingPro: Unlock Additional Apple Data\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nUse The InvestingPro Stock Screener To Outsmart The Market! üõ†Ô∏èüìà\n\nCompare the performance of Apple against industry leaders, access vital financial stats and make smarter investment moves.\n\nSay goodbye to inefficiency ‚Äì choose InvestingPro for swift Apple insights and more profitable decisions within minutes of signing up.\n\nAdvertisement"
