Apple was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in Jobs' parents' garage. They created the Apple I computer and sold it fully assembled to Paul Terrell, owner of Byte Shop, who ordered 50 units. This helped finance Apple's creation. The Apple II, released in 1977, was highly successful and helped launch the personal computer industry. Jobs and Wozniak incorporated Apple in 1977. Apple grew rapidly in the 1980s but faced challenges in the 1990s before Steve Jobs returned and revitalized the company with products like the iMac and iPod.",
