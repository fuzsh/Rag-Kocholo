        "text": "Careers at Apple\n\nMission\n\nApple's mission is to manufacture top quality computer hardware and software for businesses and personal users, while retaining its status as market leaders and innovators in the world of premium consumer electronics.\n\nHistory\n\nWhen Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne first started Apple Computer, Inc., personal computers were a relatively new and very niche-interest thing, beloved only by a small number of dedicated hobbyists. The year was 1976, and their first product was the Apple I. Designed by Wozniak, it was a basic computer kit that came with no case – customers had to build their own, usually wooden one, or simply install it in a suitcase. To fund its release, Jobs had to sell his car and Wozniak had to sell his calculator.\n\nWayne soon left the company, but Jobs and Wozniak remained, incorporating their company in 1976, before releasing the vastly improved Apple II. Aided by mentoring and investment from Mike Markkula, the following three years saw an average annual growth rate of 536% as they carved a niche for themselves in the small, but lucrative, home computing market.\n\nIn 1980, Apple also sought to break IBM and Microsoft's grip on the business computer market with the Apple III. Later that year, their initial public offering became the most lucrative of any company since 1956. Share prices instantly rocketed and over thirty early investors became overnight millionaires.\n\nEarly on, Jobs had realised that to sell computers to a mass market, rather than just to people with programming skills, a quality graphical user Interface was key to success. In 1984, trying to realise this ambition, Apple released the first Mackintosh computer. They advertised their new product with a commercial during the 1984 Superbowl. Some have come to regard this event as a historic moment when personal computers ceased to be the preserve of a small number of dedicated hobbyists and broke into the mainstream.\n\nAfter an ongoing feud with CEO John Sculley, in 1985, co-founder Jobs was ousted from the company as the board grew increasingly frustrated by his expensive and highly experimental approach to product development. Jobs then founded rival firm NeXT.\n\nWithout Jobs, Apple shifted to producing more expensive equipment. Apple had garnered such a dedicated core of enthusiastic consumers, that the higher price tags didn't seem to adversely affect sales and profits initially continued to rise, although as the 1990’s progressed, Apple increasingly blundered with a series of expensive and unsuccessful forays into PDAs, digital cameras, cd players, video consoles and TV appliances.\n\nWhile it was focusing on these unsuccessful ventures, Microsoft was rapidly usurping its market share of the personal and business computer markets, as Windows became a universally standard operating system found in homes and offices across the globe.\n\nIn 1997 Apple brought their co-founder Jobs back on board when they acquired NeXT. He became CEO, and oversaw Apple's return to success as they released new models of Mac as well as developing lots of well received software packages such as Final Cut Pro.\n\nThe 21st century saw Apple fully return to form, far exceeding even their early successes, with iPods becoming dominant in the portable media player market, as Apple Macs increasingly established their reputation as an upmarket, “cool” alternative to machines running the more popular Windows OS. From 2003-2006, Apples stock increased tenfold, as investors were impressed not only by Apple products and the company's performance, but also by Jobs' prodigious talents as a product developer and marketer.\n\nIn 2007, Apple Computer, Inc became simply “Apple Inc.”, as Jobs announced a new focus on consumer electronics. Since then Apple products such as the iPhone and iPad have become ubiquitous parts of modern life and the company's growth continued even through the global recession. They achieved in 2015 a record market capitalization of $775 billion, and today, Apple is the world's largest tech company in terms of revenue generated.\n\nJobs passed away in 2011, months after stepping down as CEO, but the company continues to enjoy growth. Apple also continues to engage in many high-profile acquisitions, in recent years buying companies such as Beats Electronics and hardware sensor giant Primesense.\n\nBenefits at Apple\n\nOur team"
