        "text": "Apple Inc. has become one of the world’s top corporations, generating billions of dollars annually.\n\nApple provides jobs worldwide and introduces astonishing new technologies and products.\n\nThe company upends the apple carts of technology, politics, social events, and more.\n\nTheir achievements cover so many areas that it would take days to spotlight.\n\nApple’s rise to power has been an up-and-down battle of mega proportions; they’ve had to go up against fierce competitors, government regulations, and more.\n\nHowever, when all is said and done, Apple still is a leader in innovation and originality.\n\nSo let’s look at 20 fun facts about Apple.\n\nThe name ‘Apple’ came from founder Steve Jobs’ like of the fruit. Mystery surrounded the reason for the name Apple, but in truth, it was just the fruit that Jobs’ liked and named the company after that.\n\nApple originally had three co-founders. The third co-founder, a man named Ronald Wayne, had joined co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, but he left the company only 12 days after it was founded. He sold his 10% share for only $800 and got an additional payout of $1,500. Had Wayne stayed with the company, his shares would be worth today around $60 billion!\n\nApple has a ‘no smoking’ ban regarding their computers. As ridiculous as it sounds, if your computer is found to have been damaged by an external source, such as cigarette smoke – you’ve been warned!\n\nApple employs more people than a good-sized city. Apple employs over 90,000 people. However, millions more make money from Apple, and that ranges from sales affiliates to mom-and-pop shops around the world.\n\nWith the first Apple iPod, an Easter Egg was implanted. The way to get the Easter Egg is to go to the ‘About’ menu and hold down the center button for just a few seconds. Users could then see and play a game called Breakout. The game had previously been developed by Apple co-founders Wozniak and Jobs when they worked at Atari.\n\nApple is so successful it has twice the amount of money than the U.S. Treasury.\n\nApple scored big time with the iPod. The creator, Tony Fadell, had originally offered the device to both Real Networks and Philips. Both companies turned it down.\n\nIn 1983, Apple launched its Lisa line of computers. It failed. Word is that around 2,700 of the devices are buried in a landfill in Utah.\n\nApple is so successful that in the first quarter of 2014, it made more money than Amazon, Google, and Facebook combined.\n\nApple has around $150 billion in excess capital. It could buy companies like Netflix, Twitter, Tesla, and Facebook.\n\nIt was no evil Satanic reason the Apple I sold for $666.66. Steve Wozniak saw that the price was $667.00 and liked repeated numbers, so he changed it to $666.66.\n\nApple’s first company logo featured a drawing of the father of physics, Sir Isaac Newton.\n\nTo raise capital for Apple, co-founder Steve Wozniak had to sell his scientific calculator.\n\nApple was the first to make a digital color camera.\n\nThe name iPod was inspired by the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nAt present, Apple is the largest publicly traded company in the United States.\n\nApple’s cash on hand, around $155 billion, could give everyone in the U.S. $490.00!\n\nIf Apple was a country, it would be the world’s 27th largest country, between Venezuela and Belgium.\n\nBy 2011, the Apple iPhone accounted for 40% of the company’s annual revenue. It’s estimated that over three-quarters of Apple’s income is from products that were invented within the past 10 years.\n\nEven with an estimated net worth of $7 billion, for the last 15 years with the company, CEO Steve Jobs was only paid $1, so he could qualify for the company’s health benefits.\n\nOverall, Apple’s history is one of astonishment. It’s now one of the most powerful players in the computing and mobile fields.\n\nApple continues to surprise the world with its innovative products and services."
