        "text": "If You Are a U.S. iOS App Developer You Could Get a Payment from a Settlement with Apple\n\nA settlement has been reached with Apple Inc. (“Apple”) in an antitrust class action lawsuit brought by U.S. app developers about Apple’s App Store. The lawsuit alleged that Apple monopolized (or attempted to monopolize) an alleged iOS app and in-app product distribution services market in violation of U.S. antitrust and California unfair competition laws. Apple denies all allegations and the settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing by Apple.\n\nYou may be included in this settlement and entitled to receive a payment if you are or were a U.S. developer of any Apple iOS application or in-app product (including subscriptions) that:\n\nWas sold for a non-zero price;\n\nWas sold via Apple’s iOS App Store between 2015 and 2021; and\n\nEarned, together with any other iOS applications or in-app products (including subscriptions) sold through all of your associated developer accounts, proceeds equal to or less than $1,000,000.00 through the App Store U.S. storefront in every calendar year from 2015 to 2021 in which you had a developer account.\n\nThe criteria to be a “Settlement Class Member” are defined more fully in the notice relating to this settlement. U.S. developers who meet the criteria are entitled to a minimum cash payment ranging from $250 to $30,000.\n\nYour legal rights are affected whether you act or don’t act. Read this website carefully. It addresses each of the following options available to you:\n\nYOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OPTIONS IN THIS SETTLEMENT\n\nSTAY IN THE CLASS AND FILE A VALID CLAIM AND RECEIVE PAYMENT\n\nDEADLINE: MAY 20, 2022\n\nIf you submit a timely and valid claim form, you are entitled to a cash payment (with minimums ranging from $250 - $30,000) from the $100 million Small Developer Assistance Fund established as part of this settlement.\n\nYou will lose the ability to sue Apple for claims related to this case. (See FAQs 11-13.)\n\nASK TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE SETTLEMENT\n\nDEADLINE: MARCH 21, 2022\n\nIf you decide to exclude yourself from this settlement, you will lose the ability to obtain a payment from the Small Developer Assistance Fund. But you may keep the ability to sue Apple for claims related to this case. (See FAQs 14-16.)\n\nOBJECT TO THE SETTLEMENT\n\nDEADLINE: MARCH 21, 2022\n\nIf you do not exclude yourself from the settlement, you may still object to it by writing to the Court to explain the basis for your objection. (See FAQ 20.)\n\nSPEAK AT THE HEARING ON JUNE 7, 2022 AT 2 P.M.\n\nIf you object to the settlement, you may ask the Court for permission to speak at the Final Approval Hearing about your objection. (See FAQ 24.)\n\nDO NOTHING (NO DEADLINE)\n\nIf you take no action, you get no payment and you give up your legal right to continue to sue Apple for claims related to this case."
