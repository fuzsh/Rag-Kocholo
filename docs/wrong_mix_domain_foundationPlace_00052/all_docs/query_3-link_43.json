        "text": "Apple Inc. is a consumer electronics, software and personal computer manufacturer based in Cupertino, California, that is widely known for products, like the Macintosh computers, iPod, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. Its former CEO, Steve Jobs, was also the founding father of Pixar Animation Studios, and its CEO until the studio's acquisition by the Walt Disney Company. Jobs became Disney's largest individual shareholder and served on Disney's board of directors until his death in 2011.\n\nSeveral allusions to Apple and its products have appeared throughout Pixar films.\n\nDisney was also one of the first companies to unveil the new iMessage sticker collections in fall of 2016.\n\nReferences in Pixar films[]\n\nMonsters, Inc.[]\n\nThe back cover of the magazine Mike Wazowski receives near the end of the movie presents an advertisement for a computer that parodies Apple in a monster style. Its tagline \"Think Different\" is changed to \"Scare Different.\"\n\nThe Incredibles[]\n\nThe keyboard of the computer Mirage uses onboard Syndrome's manta jet has a key with Apple's logo.\n\nCars[]\n\nOne of the Piston Cup racers, named Mac iCar, has Apple for sponsor. His racing number is 84, in reference to the year Apple released the Macintosh personal computer.\n\nWALL-E[]\n\nIn his truck, WALL-E watches Hello, Dolly! on an old iPod.\n\nThe sound made when WALL-E's power is regenerated is the \"Boot-Up Chime\" heard when an Apple computer is turned on suggesting he runs an Apple OS.\n\nApple's MacInTalk software was used to voice AUTO.\n\nEVE's design is extremely similar to the one of Apple's products. She was designed with the help of Apple’s major designer Jonathan Ive.\n\nUp[]\n\nThe computer shown in the end credits bears an uncanny resemblance to an Apple computer.\n\nToy Story 3[]\n\nThe computer Woody and Bonnie's toys use is an iMac running OS X (now called macOS), and they are seen using Apple's web browser Safari.\n\nMolly has an orange iPod Nano.\n\nAndy has an iTunes window open on his laptop.\n\nCars 2[]\n\nFinn McMissile says Holley Shiftwell's cover identity is “designing iPhone apps”.\n\nBrave[]\n\nOne of the lords' names is Macintosh, which is also the name of Apple's series of computers. However, Macintosh is the name of a real Scottish clan and a type of apple (the fruit), and it remains unconfirmed whether it was an allusion to Apple or not.\n\nThe end credits feature a dedication to Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple and chief executive of Pixar, who died in 2011.\n\nInside Out[]\n\nWhen Riley's father is talking on the phone, the interface of his phone is the same as the one in some iPhones.\n\nThere's also Apple, Inc logos in some memory orbs when Joy and Sadness are in the Long Term Memory.\n\nCars 3[]\n\nDuring the beach training scene with Lightning and Cruz, when the white truck's screens go on, the Mac startup sound plays.\n\nWhen Cruz Ramirez gets a call, her ringtone is the mobile ringtone \"Opening\", introduced on the iPhone 5.\n\nDuring the post-credits scene with Mater, his ringtone for his device is the same sound for FaceTime on mobile (iPhone, iPad and iPod).\n\nGallery[]\n\nPixar[]\n\nWalt Disney Animation Studios[]"
