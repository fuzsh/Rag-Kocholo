        "text": "Apple’s journey began in Steve Jobs’ parents’ home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California. Looking at the trillion-dollar company now, it is difficult to imagine that some hungry entrepreneurs decided to pursue a venture from humble beginnings and focus their talent and skill on making the world’s most recognizable firms in the world. Today, the technology giant turned 48 years old on April 1, and it is difficult to argue that Apple transformed the computing world that we see before us. From portable computers to smartphones and mixed-reality headsets, the Cupertino giant is regarded by many as having changed the face of the industry.\n\nBefore the iPhone was ‘bread and butter’ for Apple, the company was focused on making personal computers, starting with the Apple-1\n\nWhere everyone else was drawing up ideas for April Fools, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak partnered up in an effort to deliver revolutionary computing products for the consumer. Being an early company with immature founders, Apple had to learn various aspects of being a successful entity, and even though the first run of Apple-1 was a successful one, as 50 units were sold, there were a multitude of lessons that had to be learned. When Jobs was pitching the Apple-1 to Paul Terrel, who ran Byte Shop at the time, he wanted to sell motherboards and kits that assemblers would pick up to make into a computer.\n\nHowever, Terrell wanted the devices assembled to be sold as standalone computers, and ultimately, this idea forced Jobs to change the company’s business model, as Apple now focused on selling pre-assembled computers to the public. Of course, these changes were just the start of Apple slowly taking over other categories. However, just like its competitors, Apple suffered significant setbacks, and there was a time when the now-Cupertino giant would have declared bankruptcy as it was bleeding tremendous amounts of cash."
