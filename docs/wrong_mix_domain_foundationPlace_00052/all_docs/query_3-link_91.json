Here they came up with the idea of creating an inexpensive and user-friendly computer. Wozniak being the engineer had been working on an encased circuit board which included switches with flashing lights. Jobs insisted that he and Wozniak try to sell this play toy for computer hobbyists which they called the Apple I. That day the Apple Computer was born and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nEarly successes\n\nThe Apple Inc. is established\n\nProgress in the 1990s\n\nFailure\n\nApple Interactive Television Box\n\nApple Pippin\n\nPlatform Wars\n\nDisadvantages of closed hardware\n\nHamstrung by an Established User Base\n\n2000s resurgence\n\nSmartphone revolution\n\nAfter Jobs"
