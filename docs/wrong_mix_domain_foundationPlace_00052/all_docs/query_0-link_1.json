Mr. Bucher combined unique, patented AC Plasmatron technology with advanced optimal control techniques to develop a hazardous waste to energy conversion system with unequalled performance and efficiency. The United States Customs Service, in conjunction with the U.S. Army Advanced Technologies Directorate, selected this system for sole source development and demonstration in 1999. This demonstration program, which has handled toxic gases, illegal contraband, medical waste, spent tires, car fluff, Freon, PCBs and numerous other wastes, has successfully passed U.S. EPA and State of California emissions standards by independent lab certification tests. This system was recently sold to a Swiss company and is now being deployed in Taiwan for medical waste and lab solvent destruction and synthesis gas production. Mr. Bucher has also procured product development and demonstration programs for the AC Plasmatron with the U.S. Industrial Coalition, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the Department of Energy and the International Science and Technology Center. Numerous commercial projects with several large private corporations are now in negotiations.
