Apple's devices show Apple as the Vendor in my scanner. Even the ones that start 00.\n\nI've tried a couple of online MAC searchers, and it the vendor doesn't even show up. I was hoping that there was a key to the MAC ID assignments.\n\nPS: don't know how this got into this forum, but there really wasn't anything close to it."
