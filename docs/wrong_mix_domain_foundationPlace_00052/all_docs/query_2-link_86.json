        "text": "The Start Of Apple Company\n\nSteve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne started Apple to sell Wozniak’s hand-built Personal Computer named Apple 1. They wanted to make computers small enough so that people can have them in their homes and offices. Ronald Wayne decided to leave the company only 12 days after it was founded by accepting a cheque of $800. Wayne made the hand sketch of the first Apple logo which was later replaced by the bitten apple logo designed by Rob Janoff in 1977. It was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc., in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the Apple II, grew quickly.\n\nApple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. Then Apple shipped new computers that include graphical user interfaces, like the original Macintosh in 1984, and Apple’s promoting advertisements for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high value of its products and limited application library caused issues, as did power struggles between executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple peacefully and remained an honorary employee, to pursue other ventures, expressing his frustration with Apple’s treatment of the Apple II division and stating that the company had “been going in the wrong direction for the last five years. Steve Jobs resigned to found NeXT, taking some of Apple co-workers with him.\n\nAt that time, new desktop publishing programs appeared on PC clones that offered mostly similar functionality as Macintosh but at a lower price. So the company lost its monopoly in this market and had already estranged many of its original consumer customer bases who could no longer afford their high-priced products. The Christmas of 1989 was the first in the company’s history, to have recorded declining sales, which led to a 20% drop in Apple’s stock price.\n\nIn October 1990, it introduced three lower-cost models, the Macintosh Classic, Macintosh LC, and Macintosh IIsi, which showed significant sales. Apple also experimented with several other unsuccessful consumer-targeted products during the 1990s, which were digital cameras, portable CD audio players, speakers, video consoles, the eWorld online service, and TV appliances. In 1991, Apple introduced the PowerBook and also System 7, a major upgrade to the operating system which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities, the success of which and other products brought increasing revenue.\n\nCome Back Of Steve Jobs\n\nSteve Jobs overthrew Amelio and took Apple’s control once more in 1997, and at that time hardware had caught up to his vision for all things digital. The company was in tough shape. It had a bewildering array of products, no clear strategy, and was losing tens of millions of dollars every quarter. He canceled 70 percent of Apple’s products and laid off more than 3000 people, turning a $1 billion loss in 1997 into a $300 million profit in 1998. Then he started work building products that became Silicon Valley legends.\n\nIMac was released in 1998, which was one of the most affordable computers Apple had ever made. iPod music player was released in 2001. By the end of the decade, Apple had sold more than 200 million iPods. Steve Jobs released the iPhone in 2007 and changed the name to Apple Inc. because it shifted from computer to consumer electronics.\n\nIn 2009, Jobs announced that he would be taking a six-month medical leave of absence from Apple and would spend the time focusing on his health. Apple enjoyed success with its iPhone, iPods, iPads, and other products which introduced innovations in mobile phones, portable music players, and personal computers respectively. In 2011 Apple released iCloud, online storage and syncing service for music, photos, files, and software which replaced MobileMe, which was the last launch by Jobs before his death. After the death, Tim Cook took the leadership of Apple."
