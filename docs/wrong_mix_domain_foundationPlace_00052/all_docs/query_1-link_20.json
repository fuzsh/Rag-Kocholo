        "text": "RALEIGH, N.C. (WTVD) -- Apple's development of an East Coast hub in Raleigh will not begin construction until 2026, according to new documents.\n\nABC11 obtained the documents Monday. A Traffic Impact Analysis prepared by Raleigh engineering firm Kimley-Horn as part of Apple's preliminary filings hints at 2026 as a possible year for construction to start. Apple first announced back in 2021 that it would bring an engineering hub and campus to the Raleigh area.\n\nAccording to the documents, the project is expected to consist of up to 682,000 square feet of office and \"various employee support facilities\" located on the north side of Little Drive and NC 540 in Morrisville.\n\nThe executive summary says the build-out is expected for 2026.\n\nABC11 reached out to Kimley-Horn for comment but did not hear back Monday.\n\nMorrisville Mayor TJ Cawley said they are addressing things for the town now such as building two bridges to prepare for Apple even if it is a few years away.\n\n\"It definitely feels like they're going to be moving forward with this, and we're very excited about it and it's really going to change the region for the better,\" Cawley said. \"There are so many ancillary benefits of having Apple. They are such a big name internationally, and we're already an international town.\"\n\nThe mayor said they are recruiting people and competing with Boston, Texas, and Silicon Valley,\n\n\"We're already on the map and this will only make it more important for us to think of Apple associated with us,\" Cawley said. \"Life sciences have come to us like crazy. I think they are going to build that campus to the max, and they are going to do great work there, innovate, one of our four values is innovation, so we're welcoming them.\"\n\nApple's $1B investment to build East Coast hub in Research Triangle\n\nRecords from the Department of Commerce show the state's Economic Investment Committee approved an $845 million jobs grant that would be tied to new jobs created for the proposed project through the end of 2032.\n\nApple would have to create a minimum of 2,700 jobs by then to avoid defaulting on the grant.\n\nREAD MORE: Wake County leaders discuss the significance of Apple to RTP\n\nThe jobs would be created between 2023 and 2032.\n\nIn the first three years, the jobs must pay a minimum of $133,000 a year and $168,000 every year after that.\n\nWATCH: State leaders explain why Apple's investment is such a big deal\n\n$100 Million Infrastructure Fund\n\nApple says it will also establish a $100 million fund to support schools and community initiatives in the Raleigh-Durham area and across the state. There will also be a more than $110 million investment to fund infrastructure going toward broadband, roads and bridges, and public schools, in the 80 North Carolina counties with the greatest need.\n\nThe investments are expected to generate $1.5 billion in economic benefits annually for the state.\n\nBreaking down the economic impact of the Apple announcement\n\n\"By 2029, Apple's investment and job creation is expected to generate at least $1.5 billion annually for the state of North Carolina,\" said Dr. John Connaughton, UNC Charlotte's Belk College of Business.\n\nApple's Racial Justice and Equity Initiative\n\nApple's move into the Triangle brings it closer to the students of color the company has made recent strides to empower through racial justice efforts. Late last year, the company announced a $100 million initiative to help dismantle systemic barriers and promote racial equality for people of color. Saint Augustine's University in Raleigh partnered with the tech company for a first-of-its-kind education hub for historically Black colleges and universities based in Atlanta. Monday's announcement has the potential to bring that partnership much closer to home.\n\n\"Our region (Triangle Area of North Carolina) is bursting with creative, innovative, and problem-solving partnership opportunities between Apple and Saint Augustine's University,\" said SAU President Christine Johnson McPhail. \"We are excited about the opportunity to become a hub to build the capacity to promote pathways for more of our students and community residents to enter the STEM workforce.\"\n\nApple news could have effect on housing market: If you want to buy or sell a home, Triangle Realtor says 'do it now'\n\nWith 1,100 current employees in North Carolina, Apple's hub in RTP would more than triple the company's Tar Heel state footprint."
