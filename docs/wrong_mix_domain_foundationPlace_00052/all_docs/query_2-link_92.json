        "text": "With the release of the new iPhone 7, it is a great time to examine how far Apple Inc. has come since its inception in 1976.\n\nApple Computers, Inc. was founded by college dropouts Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak on April 1, 1976. Their mission was to create a user friendly computer that could be used in people’s homes and offices, but what they developed in Steve Jobs’ garage became so much more than simply a computer.\n\nOne of the first patents Apple Computers, Inc., was granted was MICROCOMPUTER FOR USE WITH VIDEO DISPLAY “Apple II” (U.S. Patent No. 4,136,359). This invention revolutionized the computer industry, as it introduced the first-ever color graphics. Although the computer was a breakthrough, Steve Jobs thought it to be unsightly and asked Jerrold Manock to design a new case. Manock came up with a foam-molded plastic case that was sleeker and more professional in appearance, which is PERSONAL COMPUTER (U.S. Patent No. D268,584).\n\nAs time went on, so did the interests and goals of Apple’s creators. Wozniak left in 1983 and was replaced with PepsiCo’s John Sculley, who became the president of Apple. A couple years later in 1985, Jobs left in pursuit of new and bigger things. These things included the creation of NeXT Software and the purchase of Pixar from George Lucas.\n\nAfter Apple reached its peak in 1990, the company slowly started to decline and experts believed the company to be doomed. In 1997, Apple became desperate to increase their sales, and they reached out to Jobs. The company offered him employment and also purchased NeXT Software. Jobs, named CEO, got right to work making big changes around the company. One of the biggest changes he instituted was an alliance with Microsoft developer Bill Gates. This alliance led to the creation of a Mac version of the popular Office software.\n\nJobs’ return to Apple was a pivotal moment for the company. Jobs revamped Apple with the creation of a new line of computers and accessories such as the iBook, LAPTOP COMPUTER (U.S. Patent No. D464,344), Bondi Blue iMac, COMPUTER ENCLOSURE (U.S. Patent No. D413,105), and the CURSOR CONTROL DEVICE (U.S. Patent No. D418,125). Steve Jobs even obtained a design patent for the signature glass STAIRCASE (U.S. Patent No. D478,999) that is seen in Apple stores today.\n\nIn 2000, Apple acquired the company Sound Jam, a music organization playback program that was re-released as the now popular iTunes. The acquisition of Sound Jam led to the creation of a personal listening device, known as the iPod, METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR USE OF ROTAIONAL USER INPUTS (U.S. Patent No. 7,345,671). The iPod utilized the iTunes music software as a way to organize personal music libraries stored on an external device.\n\nWith the huge success of the iPod and the increased comfort the younger generation had with technology and personal electronics, Steve Jobs decided to take Apple to another level. On January 9, 2007, Jobs gave a keynote speech to the Macworld Convention where he announced a new product; iPod with cellular phone and internet browsing capabilities, now known as the iPhone, TELEPHONE INTERFACE FOR A PORTABLE COMMUNICATION DEVICE (U.S. Patent Application No. 7,860,536). The design for the new iPhone was also patented ELECTRONIC DEVICE (U.S. Patent No. D558,756)."
