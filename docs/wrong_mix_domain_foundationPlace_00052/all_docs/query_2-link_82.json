It could buy companies like Netflix, Twitter, Tesla, and Facebook.\n\nSteve Wozniak changed the price of the Apple I to $666.66 because he liked repeated numbers.\n\nApple's first company logo featured a drawing of Sir Isaac Newton.\n\nTo raise capital for Apple, co-founder Steve Wozniak had to sell his scientific calculator.\n\nApple was the first to make a digital color camera.\n\nThe name iPod was inspired by the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nImage credit: WSJ\n\nApple is the largest publicly traded company in the United States.\n\nCEO Steve Jobs was only paid $1 for the last 15 years with the company so he could qualify for the company's health benefits.\n\nOverall, Apple’s history is one of astonishment.
