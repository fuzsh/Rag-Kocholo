'Dancing with the Stars' celebrity Maksim Chmerkovskiy and his fiancé Peta Murgatroyd have announced the Hebrew name the duo gave to their new son days after welcoming the beautiful baby boy into the world on February 14. Murgatroyd, an Australian dancer, explained on her blog over the weekend that she and Chmerkovskiy had struggled to decide upon a fitting name for their little one. The pair finally agreed on the name "Shai," which means "gift" in Hebrew, for their own little Valentine's Day present. "Honestly, it’s a perfect fit because from the very beginning, we felt like this little life we made was the most precious gift God could grant us," wrote Murgatroyd on Friday. "It took months and months to find a name that both Maks and I loved and kind of embodied what he means to us. We knew that we wanted a shorter name that wasn’t super complicated because ‘Chmerkovskiy' is kind of a mouthful and he’ll always have to spell it out for people," she quipped. Chmerkovskiy, 37, was born in the Ukraine to a Jewish father and Christian mother, and has described himself as Jewish. Mazel tov!
