        "text": "Kirstie Alley has been called out by a US Dancing with the Stars professional dancer for her since-deleted tweet about the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nMaksim Chmerkovskiy, a Ukrainian-American Latin–ballroom dancer, called out the Hollywood star for saying she doesn't know what's \"real\" or \"fake\" about Russia invading his native country.\n\n\"I don't know what's real or what is fake in this war,\" Alley wrote in a post she has since deleted. \"So I won't be commenting. I'll pray instead.\"\n\nGALLERY: Every arrival at the SAG Awards red carpet\n\nThis did not sit well with Chmerkovskiy, who has been posting live social media updates from Ukraine's capital Kyiv, where he has been stranded since Russia invaded the region last week.\n\nChmerkovskiy was Alley's dancing partner when she was a contestant on Dancing With the Stars back in 2011, where they came second in the competition. They were paired up again the following year for the All-Stars season, where they placed 7th.\n\n\"Dear Kirstie, We haven't spoken in a while, but I clearly remember being right next to you while you were organizing trucks of aid during Hurricane Sandy and I remember all that you were saying to me about situations where innocent [people] are suffering,\" he wrote via Instagram Story while sharing a screenshot of Alley's tweet.\n\n\"That same energy is needed right now. No one needs your prayer if you don't know what's real or fake.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Prince Harry and Meghan facing $200,000 bill\n\nIt seems the pair had a sudden falling out after they appeared on the show. Chmerkovskiy would later tell Us Weekly in 2016 that Scientology was at the centre of their estrangement.\n\n\"Scientology happened. You can thank [my friendship with] Leah Remini for that,\" he explained. \"A note was sent to a friend telling me I was 'disconnected', as in, I am no longer allowed to be Kirstie's friend. I find it ridiculous for an adult human being to 'disconnect' from someone. But everyone is entitled to their own insanity.\"\n\nIn 2014, he also told Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live that Alley \"stopped getting along with me. I think the world of her. I'm not judging people by their religion. I'm Jewish. I don't really believe in science fiction, whatever. I thought we had a great relationship.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Savvy batch cooker reveals how she saves $74 a week\n\nChmerkovskiy has been sharing videos of himself and his homeland since last Thursday when they were invaded by Russian forces.\n\n\"There's ALWAYS another way! WAR is NEVER an answer!\" Chmerkovskiy wrote on Instagram. \"P.S. I will never be the same. This is stressful and I'm getting old feelings back, like I've done this before. This does feel like the way it was when and why we left in the 90s.\"\n\n\"Everyone was hoping that the finality of this situation would be averted. That there's not going to be this kind of aggression… this kind of aggressive measure.\"\n\nHe said he wanted to return to the US and realised that he has a way to because of his American passport.\n\n\"What I'm realising is that my friends whose kids are here, whose mums, dads are here and elderly people who are here, they can't just escape,\" he said.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here."
