She danced with the NPG from 1992 to 1996. Mayte has appeared in numerous music videos, tours, award shows, and international television shows. She has gone on to provide dance instruction to artists such as Britney Spears, and continues to teach dance with limitless enthusiasm.\n\nWhile working with Prince, Mayte recorded and released her debut album Child of the Sun, which charted in Europe; the video of which was in rotation on MTV Europe and on VH1 in the US. She was a songwriter and singer on various Prince and NPG albums and directed many of Prince's tours and music videos.

She has also led the way as designer, collaborator and entrepreneur, with eponymous forays in fashion, beauty, music, publishing, spirits and entertainment production.\n\nOn stage, Dita is renowned for delighting audiences with a nonpareil romp into fantasy and spectacle, her original and ornate sets and haute couture costumes swathed in Swarovski crystals dazzling transcontinental audiences. Jean-Paul Gaultier, Elie Saab, Alexis Mabille, Jenny Packham and Zuhair Murad are among the fashion designers who create looks for her performances, and her custom footwear is always by Christian Louboutin. Many of her most awe-inspiring costumes are realized in collaboration with legendary corsetier Mr. Pearl and burlesque star-turned-designer Catherine D’Lish.\n\nSo extraordinary are her performances and productions that Dita is a marquee ambassador worldwide for the artform.\n\nTaylor Swift tapped Dita to play a burlesque-styled fairy godmother to the pop icon’s Cinderella in the star-studded video “Bejeweled,” the chart-topping track off Swift’s 2022 bestselling album, Midnights. Dita even shares two of her trademark martini glasses in the video, the two icons taking a sparkling spin within them. Weeks before, Dita teased cinema goers across the globe in the 2022 critically acclaimed film “Don’t Worry Darling,” with Harry Styles, Florence Pugh and Olivia Wilde.\n\nIt is a style that Dita has also taken to market with namesake collections in lingerie, gloves and jewelry; hats with Hood London; and a signature clothing collection in collaboration with Austrian-based designer Lena Hoschek that is in the works.\n\nIt always comes back to the curtain call, of course, and Dita’s four full-length revues are the grandest tours in burlesque history: “Strip, Strip, Hooray!” (2013-2016), “The Art of the Teese” (2017), “Dita Von Teese and the Copper Coupe” (2018), and “Glamonatrix” (2019 and 2022-2023).\n\nThese sensational spectaculars showcase a gender- and body-diverse cast of the crème de la crème of neo-burlesque performers, hailing from all over the world. In 2022, as in 2019 (a tour interrupted due to the pandemic), Dita and her star troupe staged “Glamonatrix” in historic theatres across Australia, New Zealand, Europe and the US—including five sold-out nights at the London Palladium, and packed houses at the prestigious Folies Bergère in Paris and Burgtheatre in Vienna. Dita made theatrical history bringing burlesque to the Opera Garnier Monte Carlo, with Prince Albert II of Monaco in attendance.\n\nDita Von Teese Links\n\nTickets: https://www.ticketmaster.com/ditavegas\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ditavonteese\n\nWebsite: https://dita.net/\n\nSubscribe to the audio podcast of Allison Interviews on Apple Podcasts and Spotify, and subscribe to the video podcast on YouTube. :-)\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

With his unique ball handling skills and 44-inch vertical, while he never dunked in an NBA game, Muggsy could dunk a ball. After initially playing for the then Washington Bullets, the expansion draft that occurred when the NBA added teams for the 1988-89 season put Bogues where he belonged, with the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nHe quickly became a fan favorite in Charlotte, North Carolina, especially with younger fans. He raised his points-per game average to ten in the 1992-93 season and helped lead the Hornets to their first ever appearance in the NBA playoffs. They made the playoffs again in 1995. In 1997 Muggsy Bogues led with an assist per turnover ratio of 4.34. He was traded to the Golden State Warriors early in the 1997-98 season, but not before becoming the Charlotte Hornets’ all-time leader in both steals and assists, which he still holds today.\n\nMuggsy Bogues’ storied career with the NBA lasted fourteen years, and to this day, he remains the shortest player to ever make it into the NBA. In 2014, Bogues was named as the Hornets Ambassador and Special Projects Advisor, a position he still serves today.\n\nMuggsy Bogues currently travels around the U.S. doing speaking engagements, and he and his daughter Brittney Bogues run the Muggsy Bogues Family Foundation. The Muggsy Bogues Family Foundation works to empower underserved youth and families to improve their quality of life through food security, access to education, and workforce development. The Foundation envisions equitable, thriving communities where everyone has a shot at a better life.\n\nVisit https://boguesfoundation.org/ and https://www.muggsybogues.com/ and follow on Instagram @ https://www.instagram.com/therealmuggsy.\n\nSubscribe to the audio podcast of Allison Interviews on Apple Podcasts and Spotify, and subscribe to the video podcast on YouTube. :-)\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Earlier this year he returned with an all-new EP, executive produced by DJ Mannie Fresh: Images. He also released a new music video, \"The Last Days\", which speaks to the current war and global crisis in Ukraine, and the impacts of the past two years that we have been feeling here at home.\n\nYello’s upcoming documentary film will be the first step in significantly increasing minority and youth participation in midterm elections in years to come, as it simplifies the voting process for a younger generation. This informative, yet entertaining film project takes the power out of the president's hands. It equally balances the power throughout every branch, at every level of government in a way that young adults and even children will understand. It reimagines government in a way that we all wish we would have learned in school, and is an attempt to raise a politically aware generation of people.\n\nHis goal is to explain not only the importance of voting, but exactly why it is absolutely imperative that it happens.\n\nFollow YelloPain on Instagram @yellopain\n\nAnd YouTube @yellopain\n\nSubscribe to the audio podcast of Allison Interviews on Apple Podcasts and Spotify, and subscribe to the video podcast on YouTube. :-)\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
