        "text": "Vikings star Katheryn Winnick has backed Ukraine and shared photos of her ancestors amid Russia’s invasion.\n\nRussia launched airstrikes across the country as they invaded on Thursday, while President Vladimir Putin has warned other world leaders that they will ‘face consequences greater than any in history’ if they interfere.\n\nThe 44-year-old star was born in Canada but is of Ukrainian descent, while spoke the native language and didn’t learn to speak English until she was eight.\n\nOn Thursday, she shared a simple but poignant message responding to Putin’s attack as she wrote: ‘Stand with Ukraine’.\n\nDeclaring herself ‘a proud Ukrainian’, she added on her Instagram Story: ‘I woke up this morning with texts from my Ukrainian family & friends saying “It has begun”.\n\n‘Some feeling, some taking shelter underground & others staying to fight. We are a peaceful country. We do not deserve this war. #STANDWITHUKRAINE’\n\nMeanwhile, singer Regina Spektor – who was born in Moscow before her family left the former Soviet Union and moved to New York in 1989 – has reflected on her Ukrainian and Russian heritage as she shared a lengthy post about the ‘terrifying’ events.\n\nShe wrote on Instagram: ‘Today my heart hurts because no matter how many great works of art and music (Guernica…. Masters Of War… Most of Okudzhava and Vysotsky… Vonnegut… Remarque… all those films in all those languages…) portray the horrors of war, new Masters of War seem to rise up again in all the nations…\n\n‘Sending new children to slaughter each other… Yes there’s nothing funny about Peace, Love and Understanding… it’s so needed right now. There were, and still are, real Nazis in the world.\n\n‘But in Ukraine that are just millions of civilians being pulled into a war, and in Russia there are children being sent to fight and die for no reason other than the bottomless and horror filled “more more more more more more more” of politicians and corporations.’\n\nThe Conjuring and Up in the Air actress Vera Farmina – who was born to Ukrainian parents – posted a picture of the country’s flag alongside some verses of the national anthem.\n\nShe added: ‘#IStandWithUkraine’\n\nFormer Dancing With The Stars pro Maksim Chmerkovskiy – a Ukrainian star currently appearing as a judge on the country’s show World of Dance – shared a video from inside Kyiv during the invasion.\n\nHe wrote alongside the clip: ‘I will never be the same. This is stressful and I’m getting old feelings back, like I’ve done this before. This does feel like the way it was when and why we left in the 90s. Like my old PTSD I’ve finally fixed is coming back.\n\n‘I literally only just forgot about those “always on the edge” feelings and actually started worrying about things like bbq grills. I’m crying as I’m typing this because all man deserves to worry about “bbq grills” and not f***ing war. Hug your loved ones.’\n\nFormer Eurovision Song Contest winner Jamala – who won the competition for Ukraine in 2016 – was also among those to voice her stance, as she wrote: ‘We don’t want war! We are for peace! Please support Ukraine.’\n\nMeanwhile, Russian pop star Valery Meladze shared a video with his followers on social media and said: ‘Today something happened that could and should never have happened. History will judge everything one day. Now I want to beg you to stop military action and sit down to negotiate.’\n\nAnd TV presenter Ksenia Sobchak added: ‘We are now all trapped in this situation. There is no exit. We Russians will spend many years digging out from the consequences of this day.’\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : John Cena slammed by fans for ‘using Ukraine invasion’ to promote Peacemaker in ‘tone deaf’ tweet"
