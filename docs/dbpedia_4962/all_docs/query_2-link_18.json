        "text": "Maksim Chmerkovskiy and Peta Murgatroyd are showing off their sizzling moves … on each other. The professional dancers from the ABC's \"Dancing with the Stars\" were seen getting hot and heavy over the weekend, complete with a steamy kiss!\n\nFresh off her mirror ball trophy win, Peta, 30, was in Las Vegas with Maksim, 32, over the weekend. During the day they hung out at the Encore Beach Club, where the swimsuit-wearing twosome openly cuddled in front of guests. Later, they took things up a notch when they went to the XS nightclub. Wearing a pink dress that was practically painted on, Peta made out with Maksim, who had his arms wrapped around her.\n\nAlthough they have denied that they are dating, People reports that Peta “had a crush” on her competitor for a long time. “It's early but I think this will last,\" a source told the magazine. \"They’re a good match, a good couple. She says they’re not dating but they are. Everyone knows it.”\n\n[Related: Kym Johnson and Tristan MacManus Preview the New 'DWTS' Game: It's Like You're Dancing With One of Us!]\n\nThe weekend before, they were both in Connecticut where Maksim opened a dance studio with his brother Val and fellow pro Tony Dovolani. Asked by People if they were dating, Murgatroyd said, \"I'm here to support Maksim.\" Maksim wouldn't kiss and tell either, saying: \"I try to keep certain things private just because – what's the politically correct way of saying it? It's none of anybody's business.\"\n\nMaksim has experience in the showmance department. The Ukrainian-American dance champ started romancing his fellow \"DWTS\" performer Karina Smirnoff in the summer of 2008. By the end of the year they were engaged, but called things off the following September prior to walking down the aisle. He was later linked to his celebrity dance partner Erin Andrews in 2010, but neither of them ever confirmed the relationship. Erin is now dating \"Gossip Girl\" star Chace Crawford.\n\n[Related: Donald Driver & Peta Murgatroyd Crowned Winners of 'Dancing with the Stars']\n\nAfter joining the cast of \"DWTS\" in 2011, Australia native Peta was crowned the big winner of season 14 last week, along with her celeb partner NFL-er Donald Driver. Maksim made it to week eight with partner Melissa Gilbert, who suffered a head injury early on. He was also dealing with a cyst on his ankle."
