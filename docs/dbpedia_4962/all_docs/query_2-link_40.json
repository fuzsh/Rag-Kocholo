Throughout her career, she’s also appeared on TV and film, most recently portraying Madame de Garderobe in the live action remake of Beauty and the Beast. Regardless of the part, McDonald’s soaring soprano is always instantly recognizable. On March 17, she’ll share her otherworldly talent with audiences at the Kravis Center in West Palm Beach. PBI caught up with McDonald to talk all things Audra—and a bit of Billie, too.
