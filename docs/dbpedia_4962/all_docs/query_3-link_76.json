        "text": "Month: February 2018\n\nVillianous Retellings.\n\nIt’s kind of funny to me when I was a little girl, Ursula the Sea Witch terrified me. I would quite literally scream and cry if I saw her. Yet, I’ve come to love villains as I’ve gotten older. I don’t think it’s because I’m a villain myself, but I just love the darkness that surrounds them. (My friends tease me that I’m a villain at heart. Haters gonna hate cause that just means I’m a bad ass.) Some aren’t actually villains, some are just misunderstood. (Like Loki and Bucky Barnes in the Avengers and the Winter Soldier respectively.) I think it’s fun when a villain gets their happy ending, which is why I thoroughly enjoy when there’s a book or movie told from their point of view.\n\nIt was when the show Once Upon A Time came out, that I really got into it. Lana Parilla’s Evil Queen/Regina Mills won me over and in season two, Colin O’Donoghue’s Hook/Killian Jones. (Don’t get me started on how that show now annoys me to no end. Both are AMAZING villains and they made Hook into a lovesick puppy and they keep screwing Regina out of her redemption, damn it.) I remember watching the first episode with my mother and Lana barges in and I was like O_O “YASSS QUEEN.”\n\nEvil Queen fan born here. It made me rewatch Disney movies and I began to appreciate villains more. Ursula, Maleficent, the Evil Queen, Gaston, Frollo. The last time I was at Disney World, I was looking through one of the many stores and I found a curious thing. ‘Fairest of Them All’. (Cue my fangirling, because I’d just bought an Evil Queen shirt and met her (no, not Lana) at Mickey’s Not So Scary Halloween Party.) I was intrigued and I picked it up, a retelling of Snow White from the Evil Queen’s point of view? I was in love. The cast member was eyeballing me but hey, zero poisoned apples given. (See what I did there? Lol.)\n\nAs you can see, it’s a series as written by Serena Valentino. I think there’s going to be another one later this year. I think it’s pretty inventive to have the villain’s tell their side of things. Maybe I’m peculiar because I find most of the stories to be biased in their telling. You see one perspective; I want to hear the other one. A villain is a subjective thing. A ‘hero’ may be a villain to some and vice versa. The Beast to me, was never a villain and I haven’t read his book yet, but I will. (Because Beauty and the Beast…you guys already know how obsessed I am.) Gaston was the villain to me and even in the live action version, he was though they gave him a more comical side. (Although I have a crush on Luke Evans, so I was a little more forgiving..lmao. Yes, I’m shallow. But he was perfect! Is he not the physical embodiment of the animated version?)\n\nI think Susan Kay’s retelling of Phantom is a brilliant example of a ‘villain’ retelling his story. We learn what made him the way he was; we get inside of his mind and it’s such a delicious tale. He seems less the terrible person that people think he is. I see him as a tragic figure, made bitter by the world and its treatment of him for things beyond his control. Would I have chosen him? No. But I understood him and his motives more. I always enjoyed the original story, I love the Andrew Lloyd Webber version but this is right up there. I also wanted to mention this because I didn’t want you guys to think that I was just limiting it to just Disney villains. Don’t get me wrong, some are beyond redemption, but some really are just misunderstood. I suppose it depends on one’s point of view.\n\n“A dark and towering shadow, rising like the phoenix from the ashes… malevolent… omnipotent…The Phantom of the Opera!”\n\nHow do you guys feel about it? Do you like retellings of stories? Do you like to hear villains point of views or are you a purist when it comes to stories? Sound off below! ❤\n\nThe Paris Wife: A Review.\n\nA deeply evocative story of ambition and betrayal, The Paris Wife captures the love affair between two unforgettable people: Ernest Hemingway and his wife Hadley.\n\nChicago, 1920: Hadley Richardson is a quiet twenty-eight-year-old who has all but given up on love and happiness—until she meets Ernest Hemingway. Following a whirlwind courtship and wedding, the pair set sail for Paris, where they become the golden couple in a lively and volatile group—the fabled “Lost Generation”—that includes Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, and F. Scott Fitzgerald.\n\nThough deeply in love, the Hemingways are ill prepared for the hard-drinking, fast-living, and free-loving life of Jazz Age Paris. As Ernest struggles to find the voice that will earn him a place in history and pours himself into the novel that will become The Sun Also Rises, Hadley strives to hold on to her sense of self as her roles as wife, friend, and muse become more challenging. Eventually, they find themselves facing the ultimate crisis of their marriage—a deception that will lead to the unraveling of everything they’ve fought so hard for.\n\nA heartbreaking portrayal of love and torn loyalty, The Paris Wife is all the more poignant because we know that, in the end, Hemingway wrote that he would rather have died than fallen in love with anyone but Hadley.\n\nMy knowledge of Ernest Hemingway is reasonably small. I think I have read one of his books. I know that he was married a few times, was a bit of a drinker and an ass. I kept hearing about this book and although it sat on my TBR shelf for ages, I only just now got to it.\n\nFortunately, I finally have. What a read! The curious thing is…I enjoyed this book but I didn’t like one of the main characters and I’m torn about who Hadley was.\n\nI loved learning about Hadley and Ernest’s sort of whirlwind romance and the beginnings of their relationship before Hemingway was the ‘it’ writer of the time. In the beginning, Hadley was reserved but there was a bit of a magnetism about her that drew you in. You couldn’t help but like her. Yet, once she married Hemingway, he was such a larger than life figure that he eclipsed Hadley, which is why most people probably don’t realise she even existed.\n\nShe became dependent on him and when he would leave to report on things, she was miserable. I found it sort of amusing that she was in Paris and surrounded by all of these famous names (Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda to name a few!) and yet, she was a bit of a recluse. I don’t know if she wanted to be a traditional housewife or if she was just too fearful of putting her foot down. She had my sympathy; I would have liked to have seen her really come into her own. She eventually gained some friends of her own; but Ernest didn’t like them.\n\nStill, getting a look from her perspective was interesting and I think when it was the beginning of the end, we really got to see more of her spirit. I am happy she eventually remarried and lived a long happy life with her second husband. Ernest married three more times and ultimately killed himself. Whether it was intentional or not, no one is quite sure. (I tend to think it was. He seemed an unhappy man. The trend has continued in his family, several descendants have also killed themselves.) He also wrote an account of their marriage called A Moveable Feast.\n\nI learned a few things. Firstly, Ernest was a creep. I don’t care how talented he was; he did Hadley wrong. But I also fault her; she let him ram over her. I wanted her to fight, to yell, to fight. But she kind of just allowed Pauline Pffifer to take her place. I mean, she straight up climbed into bed with Ernest and herself. She was pretty clear in that she wanted him and Hadley…I don’t know why she put up with it as she did.\n\nSecondly, I am pretty certain that they all had cast iron livers because they all drank a lot and that’s putting it mildly. Seriously, I don’t know how they all functioned or got any writing done because they were all wild and drunk a lot. I mean, it was the time, but still. It definitely made me cringe.\n\nThirdly, I really wanted to slug Ernest. Especially when he tried to convince her that he loved them both. Maybe he did. But you don’t hurt someone who has stuck by you since you were a nobody like that. She was there from the beginning and then once he hit it relatively big; she was pushed aside. Total creep move. Also, he was a jackass to his friends.\n\nI really did enjoy Ms. McLain’s writing though; it was vibrant and lively; bringing 1920’s Paris alive in a way that I never really experienced. I think it would have been amazing to live then; to be part of that crowd, if only to observe all that genius in the room.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\nI’d give it ★★★ stars.\n\nI bought this copy.\n\nI would recommend this to a friend; I’d want to see if they agree with me!\n\n“A beautiful portrait of being in Paris in the glittering 1920s—as a wife and as one’s own woman.”—Entertainment Weekly\n\n“[Paula] McLain has brought Hadley [Hemingway] to life in a novel that begins in a rush of early love. . . . A moving portrait of a woman slighted by history, a woman whose . . . story needed to be told.”—The Boston Globe\n\n“The Paris Wife creates the kind of out-of-body reading experience that dedicated book lovers yearn for, nearly as good as reading Hemingway for the first time—and it doesn’t get much better than that.”—Minneapolis Star Tribune\n\n“Exquisitely evocative . . . This absorbing, illuminating book gives us an intimate view of a sympathetic and perceptive woman, the striving writer she married, the glittering and wounding Paris circle they were part of. . . . McLain reinvents the story of Hadley and Ernest’s romance with the lucid grace of a practiced poet.”—The Seattle Times\n\n“A novel that’s impossible to resist. It’s all here, and it all feels real.”—People\n\nPaula McLain is the New York Times bestselling author of the novels Circling the Sun, The Paris Wife, and A Ticket to Ride, the memoir Like Family: Growing Up in Other People’s Houses, and two collections of poetry. Her writing has appeared in The New York Times, Good Housekeeping, O: The Oprah Magazine, Town & Country, The Guardian, The Huffington Post, and elsewhere. She lives in Ohio with her family.\n\nSpotlight: This Is Me\n\nI know I must have some ‘This Is Us’ fans on here. And if you haven’t seen it? You need to. I’m not one of those who cries easily, but this show always gets me in my “feels.” I also love Chrissy Metz, who plays Kate Pearson. She’s a big girl and so am I, representation matters, guys! I love her to pieces because she is herself. So, obviously, I’m on a memoir kick here. The link to pre-order is on the pic. (Give it a click!) And be sure to give ‘This Is Us’ a look-see if you haven’t already. ❤\n\nHardcover: 320 pages\n\nPublisher: Dey Street Books\n\nPublish Date: March 27, 2018\n\nAn inspirational book about life and its lessons from the Golden Globe and Emmy nominated star of NBC’s This Is Us.\n\nWhen This Is Us debuted in fall 2016, a divided America embraced a show that celebrates human connection. The critically acclaimed series became America’s most watched—and most talked about—network show, even building on its fan base in the drama’s second season. As Kate Pearson, Chrissy Metz presents a character that has never been seen on television, yet viewers see themselves in her, no matter what they look like or where they come from. Considered a role model just for being her authentic self, Chrissy found herself on magazine covers and talk shows, walking red carpets, and as the subject of endless conversations on social media “I don’t know what you’ve been through to play her,” she is often told by fans, “but it was something.”\n\nIn This is Me, Chrissy Metz shares her story with a raw honesty that will leave readers both surprised but also inspired. Infused with the same authenticity she brings to her starring role, Chrissy’s This is Me is so much more than your standard Hollywood memoir or collection of personal essays. She embraces the spirit of Shonda Rhimes’ Year of Yes, and shares how she has applied the lessons she learned from both setbacks and successes. A born entertainer, Chrissy finds light in even her darkest moments and leaves the reader feeling they are spending time with a friend who gets it.\n\nChrissy Metz grew up in a large family, one that always seemed to be moving, and growing. Her father disappeared one day, leaving her mother to work a series of menial jobs and his children to learn to live with the threat of hunger and the electricity being cut off. When her mother remarried, Chrissy hoped for “normal” but instead experienced a form of mental pain that seemed crafted just for her. The boys who showed her attention did so with strings attached as well, and Chrissy accepted it, because, for her, love always came with conditions.\n\nWhen she set out for Los Angeles, it was the first time she had been away from her family and from Florida. And for years, she got barely an audition. So how does a woman with the deck stacked against her radiate such love, beauty, and joy?

I don’t generally read a whole lot of memoirs but if the person writing it is someone I like or someone interesting in general, I tend to pick it up. Do any of you guys watch Dancing With The Stars? Val and his brother Maks are my favorite male dancers and they have an interesting story. I am looking forward to hearing Val speak on it at length.\n\nHardcover: 336 pages\n\nPublisher: Dey Street Books\n\nPublish Date: March 6, 2018)\n\n“Val embodies what it means to live the American dream.” — Robin Roberts, Good Morning America\n\nValentin Chmerkovskiy, the world championship-winning and beloved Dancing with the Stars ballroom dancer invites fans into his life as never before, sharing the experiences, including the failures and successes, that have shaped him, from his early childhood in Ukraine to growing up as an immigrant in the U.S. to his rise to international fame.\n\nVal has captivated viewers of Dancing with the Stars since his first performance in 2011. While DWTSdemonstrates Val’s beautiful physicality, this moving memoir illuminates his soul, revealing a deep, thoughtful person who channels his emotions and socially conscious views through his art. The beloved dance champion and choreographer assesses his life and career so far—where he’s come from and where he hopes to go.\n\nFor the first time, Val looks back at his childhood in Odessa, Ukraine, and his Jewish family’s immigration to the United States—including what it was like to grow up as a stranger desperate to fit into a different culture, how he worked to become a premier dancer, and, of course, the collaborations and competitions with his brother and fellow DWTS sensation, Maksim “Maks” Chmerkovskiy.\n\nVal speaks warmly of his close-knit family and shares intimate and inspiring stories meant to offer hope and motivation not only to fans but to everyone with a dream. Enduring anti-Semitism in their native land, Val’s parents wanted a better life for their children—a desire that led them to leave everything they knew and start again thousands of miles away in a foreign country. It was a gamble that paid off—after years of practice and discipline, Val, along with his older brother Maks, have reached the pinnacle of success. Though he admits he sometimes still feels like an outsider, Val expresses his enduring gratitude for everything that America represents and pays homage to his adopted nation and the opportunities it has afforded him and his family.\n\nInspiring, heartfelt, and compulsively readable—and showcasing sixteen-pages of never-before-seen photographs, as well as a foreword by brother Maks—Val’s memoir is filled with the moments that have moved and shaped him and is sure to touch readers’ hearts as well.\n\nValentin “Val” Chmerkovskiy was born in Ukraine, immigrated to the United States at the age of eight, and grew up in Brooklyn. He is the first American to have won two IDSF World Championships, one in Juniors and one in Youth. He is also a fourteen-time US National Champion, a classically trained violinist, and a mentor. Val is a co-founder and creative director at Dance with Me Studios, a national chain of dance studios, which he co-founded with his brother and fellow DWTS pro, Maks. Most recently, Val won the Season 23 Mirrorball Trophy with Olympian Laurie Hernandez. He splits his time between Los Angeles and New York City.\n\nTag! I’m It! #7BookishSins\n\nWe all have them, right? We all commit ‘sins’ in whatever topic it may be. I came upon this tag and I thought it would be fun. I seem to be falling back into a rut after posting with some regularity for awhile there. Not to mention, I’m kind of laid up with a sprained ankle and now cramps. (Yay PCOS! *sarcasm*) Thus, I’m not feeling my best. And my last post featuring Mrs. Obama didn’t quite go over well. (I never realized just how many of ya’ll hate her. 😦 ) Anywho…here’s the #7bookishsins tag!\n\n1. Greed. What is your most inexpensive book? Your most expensive?\n\nMy most inexpensive book is Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. As I’ve mentioned, I borrowed it from school and it somehow didn’t make it back.\n\nThe most expensive…that’s hard to say. I have a lot of big books that I got discounted. I’ll say my illustrated Harry Potter books. They’re worth every penny though. They’re so beautiful and they add another dimension to the Wizarding World that we all know and love.\n\n2. Wrath. What author do you have a love/hate relationship with?\n\nThis is a good question…I can’t really decide on that, can I? Hrm. I think I would choose Alison Weir and also Phillipa Gregory.\n\nAs for reasons I have discussed, I hated Ms. Weir’s last book but I love some of her other ones. Her books about Anne Boleyn and Eleanor of Aquitaine have long been on my, DNF/will never finish pile because they read a bit like novels my Grandmother used to read.\n\nMs. Gregory deserves her own post of why I find her to be a love/hate figure.\n\nThis drives me crazy because they both take tawdry unsubstantiated things and try to present them as fact. Just because you are writing historical fiction doesn’t mean you should be loosey-goosey about facts. Your misinformation may be taken as someone else’s truth.\n\n3. Gluttony. What book have you devoured over and over again with no shame?\n\nHarry Potter, obviously. Little Women, Gone with the Wind.\n\n4. Sloth. What book/series have you neglected reading due to laziness?\n\nA Court of Roses and Thorns. I devoured the first book but I haven’t gotten to the other two yet and I would like to before the novella comes out in May.\n\nI really want to get back into it though because I was loving it.\n\n5. Pride. What book do you talk about most in order to sound like an intellectual reader?\n\nI don’t think I really do try to sound like something I’m not. I’m not an intellectual. I’m just me. I do love a good debate though. If I had to choose…there are so many good choices. Hrm. I know what I’ll choose. I read it for a Lit class I took.\n\nThe Great Gatsby is an amazing book and always debatable. There’s a lot of themes and it’s fascinating to hear what each person takes from it. I love the vivid description of the Jazz Age, the highs and lows. What do you think, Old Sport?\n\n6. Lust. What attributes do you find attractive in male characters?\n\nI love a guy with a dark side and secrets. But I am picky; I don’t like the badassery to seem forced.I sort of have a literary crush on Tyrion Lannister. Blunt, jaded, smart, funny. His dark side comes from his experience, his bitterness. He’s still in possession of a kind heart, which most wouldn’t expect.\n\n7. Envy. What book would you most like to receive as a gift?\n\nI am such a Hamilton fangirl!\n\nI love the soundtrack and I really, really want to see it on Broadway someday. It’s going on tour next year, so I’d like to see it when it comes to Tampa. I want to get the soundtrack on vinyl too. But I can’t freaking afford it, lol.\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda is a genius; I really love how his mind took a book he read and then made this amazing show. It’s funny to me because who would have thought that Alexander Hamilton would be such an apt topic. I couldn’t see a show about Jefferson or Washington work like this. They work as supporting characters. So, this would be a really nice gift. I’m not that optimistic it’ll happen though; I’ll probably end up buying it myself for my birthday or something.\n\nThis tag was a lot of fun!! For anyone who’s looking for a fun tag to try, feel free to do this! Consider anyone reading tagged. (:\n\nUpcoming Release: Becoming Michelle Obama.\n\nIN A LIFE filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African-American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare.\n\nIn her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.\n\nI don’t know about you guys, but I am very excited for this memoir and I can’t wait to get it. Mrs. Obama has an undeniable spark around her that is magnetic and inviting. As soon as I see some pre-order links, I will happily share them. But for now, I’m just sharing what Mrs. Obama herself shared in an Instagram post today. I’m equally as excited for President Obama to release another book. I read his first two and I love them. No matter one’s side of the political spectrum, I think it’s still a good read. It’d give insight into what it’s like to be First Lady.\n\nI am ready! How about you guys?\n\nSpotlight: The Once and Future Queen\n\nThe Once and Future Queen: Guinevere in Arthurian Legend by Nicole Evelina\n\nPublication Date: November 21, 2017\n\nLawson Gartner Publishing\n\neBook & Paperback; 281 Pages\n\nGenre: History & Criticism/Fairy Tales, Folk Tales, Legends & Mythology\n\nGuinevere’s journey from literary sinner to feminist icon took over one thousand years…and it’s not over yet.\n\nLiterature tells us painfully little about Guinevere, mostly focusing on her sin and betrayal of Arthur and Camelot. As a result, she is often seen as a one-dimensional character. But there is more to her story. By examining popular works of more than 20 authors over the last one thousand years, The Once and Future Queen shows how Guinevere reflects attitudes toward women during the time in which her story was written, changing to suit the expectations of her audience. Beginning in Celtic times and continuing through the present day, this book synthesizes academic criticism and popular opinion into a highly readable, approachable work that fills a gap in Arthurian material available to the general public.\n\nNicole Evelina has spent more than 15 years studying Arthurian legend. She is also a feminist known for her fictional portrayals of strong historical and legendary women, including Guinevere. Now, she combines these two passions to examine the effect of changing times and attitudes on the character of Guinevere in a must-read book for Arthurian enthusiasts of every knowledge level.\n\nAmazon | Barnes and Noble | Chapters | IndieBound | Kobo\n\nAbout the Author\n\nNicole Evelina is a multi-award-winning historical fiction, romantic comedy and non-fiction writer, whose four novels have collectively won over 20 awards, including two Book of the Year designations (Daughter of Destiny by Chanticleer Reviews and Camelot’s Queen by Author’s Circle). Her most recent book, THE ONCE AND FUTURE QUEEN, traces the evolution of the character of Guinevere in Arthurian legend from her Celtic roots to the present day, showing how the character changed along with the period’s views of women. Nicole is currently working on MISTRESS OF LEGEND (2018), the final book in her Guinevere’s Tale trilogy.\n\nAs an armchair historian, Nicole researches her books extensively, consulting with biographers, historical societies and traveling to locations when possible. For example, she traveled to England twice to research the Guinevere’s Tale trilogy, where she consulted with internationally acclaimed author and historian Geoffrey Ashe, as well as Arthurian/Glastonbury expert Jaime George, the man who helped Marion Zimmer Bradley research The Mists of Avalon.\n\nNicole is a member of and book reviewer for The Historical Novel Society, as well as a member of the Historical Fiction Writers of America, International Arthurian Society – North American Branch, Romantic Novelists Association, Novelists, Inc., the St. Louis Writer’s Guild, Alliance of Independent Authors, the Independent Book Publishers Association and the Midwest Publisher’s Association.\n\nFor more information, please visit Nicole Evelina’s website.

When her beloved Papa dies during a conjurer’s show, she abandons her magic and surrenders to grief and guilt. Life as a female illusionist seems too dangerous, and she must honor her father’s memory.\n\nConcerned for her welfare, family friend Professor Delacroix secures an audition for her at the Nouvel Opéra—the most illustrious stage in Europe. Yet Christine soon discovers the darker side of Paris opera. Rumors of murder float through the halls, and she is quickly trapped between a scheming diva and a mysterious phantom. The Angel of Music.\n\nBut is the Angel truly a spirit, or a man obsessed, stalking Christine for mysterious reasons tangled in her past?\n\nAs Christine’s fears mount, she returns to her magical arts with the encouragement of her childhood friend, Raoul. Newfound hope and romance abounds…until one fateful night at the masquerade ball. Those she cares for—Delacroix, the Angel, and even Raoul—aren’t as they seem. Now she must decide whom she trusts and which is her rightful path: singer or illusionist.\n\nTo succeed, she will risk her life in the grandest illusion of all.\n\n“Heather Webb combines music and magic seamlessly in The Phantom’s Apprentice, weaving glittering new threads into the fabric of a classic story. Romantic, suspenseful and inventive, this novel sweeps you along to its breathless conclusion.”—Greer Macallister, USA Today bestselling author of The Magician’s Lie and Girl in Disguise\n\n“Heather Webb’s The Phantom’s Apprentice delivers a performance worthy of the Paris Opera. Unlike so many other renditions of the Phantom’s tale, Webb breathes life into Christine, so often portrayed as the helpless victim. Christine’s evolution from ‘damsel in distress’ to self-reliant woman is masterfully done, hooking the reader from the first page. Webb’s work is immersive, well-crafted, and beautifully paced. A must-read for fans of this bewitching legend!”—Aimie Runyan, author of Daughters of the Night Sky\n\nAmazon | Barnes and Noble | IndieBound | Kobo\n\nBrava, brava, belissima…\n\nI had been anxiously awaiting this book since Ms. Webb announced that she had written it and that it would be released. I’m a HUGE Phantom fan and so is the author, which made me excited. Phans tend to respect the source material–the book and the play–so I trusted Ms. Webb. This is a reimagined version yet I still sensed the respect and love for the original versions. Christine is a bit more assertive in this version and to that I say “hell yeah!” She’s always been portrayed as this meek figure but I loved that she had a bit more spirit. By the end of the novel, she no longer allows for anyone to decide her fate but her.\n\nIn a shock to me, I was actually invested in Raoul and Christine’s romance. It isn’t a huge factor; this is not romance novel. He comes off more as someone you root for, rather than a fop. As to our Phantom, I found he was more similar to Susan Kay’s version; he is far more malevolent and threatening. This is to say, he was a bad ass and I loved him still. (I’d never want to be with him but I am a fangirl.)\n\nThe story itself is strong and it will stay with you, you’ll find yourself thinking about it and that’s a good thing. The characters are well developed–even the secondary ones. The scenery is richly described and it’s easy to lose yourself whilst reading. Ms. Webb is a powerful writer and I daresay the ‘Angel of Music’ was on her shoulder as she wrote this. It was a wonderful read and I can’t wait to read it again.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\nI’d give it ★★★★ stars.\n\nI received a copy of this in exchange for my honest review. Thank you! ❤\n\nI would (and have!) recommend this to a friend.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nHEATHER WEBB is the author of historical novels Becoming Josephine and Rodin’s Lover, and the anthology Fall of Poppies, which have been featured in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Cosmopolitan, Elle, France Magazine, and more, as well as received national starred reviews.

She is taught only to obey, but she always finds ways to rebel—gossiping with her sister among the fragrant roses of her mother’s walled garden, venturing to the forbidden rooftop to roughhouse with her three brothers, writing poems to impress her strict, disapproving father, and sneaking out to flirt with a teenage paramour over café glacé. It’s during the summer of 1950 that Forugh’s passion for poetry really takes flight—and that tradition seeks to clip her wings.\n\nForced into a suffocating marriage, Forugh runs away and falls into an affair that fuels her desire to write and to achieve freedom and independence. Forugh’s poems are considered both scandalous and brilliant; she is heralded by some as a national treasure, vilified by others as a demon influenced by the West. She perseveres, finding love with a notorious filmmaker and living by her own rules—at enormous cost. But the power of her writing grows only stronger amid the upheaval of the Iranian revolution.\n\nInspired by Forugh Farrokhzad’s verse, letters, films, and interviews—and including original translations of her poems—Jasmin Darznik has written a haunting novel, using the lens of fiction to capture the tenacity, spirit, and conflicting desires of a brave woman who represents the birth of feminism in Iran—and who continues to inspire generations of women around the world.\n\nIndieBound | Book Passage | Powell’s | Barnes & Noble | Books-A-Million | Amazon | Hudson Books | Target | Walmart\n\nJasmin Darznik’s novel Song of a Captive Bird is a fictional account of Iran’s trailblazing woman poet, Forugh Farrokhzad, and will be published by Random House on February 13, 2018. Jasmin is the author of the New York Times bestseller The Good Daughter: A Memoir of My Mother’s Hidden Life. Her essays have appeared in numerous periodicals, including the New York Times, Washington Post, and Los Angeles Times.\n\nJasmin was born in Tehran, Iran and came to America when she was five years old. She holds an MFA in fiction from Bennington College and a Ph.D. in English from Princeton University. Now a professor of English and creative writing at California College of the Arts, she lives in the San Francisco Bay Area with her family."
