It means the world to me!\n\nI would love to share more of my story with you through my book,Journaling Fame: A memoir of a life unhinged and on the record. Funny title, right? I try to inject irony and humor into everything I do. It makes life more interesting.\n\nHumor aside, my book delves into my life as an entertainment journalist with lots of fun and interesting behind-the-scenes moments. However, I also take you on an intimate journey through my experiences with anxiety, panic attacks and OCD that I experienced since childhood; and how I found healing and strength through those experiences. I would be honored to have you read my story, and I hope it helps you or someone you love.\n\nJust click the link above, below my book cover, to get your copy.\n\nWith Love,\n\nAllison\n\n​XO​​"
