Left alone to close down Paddy’s Pub one night, Charlie Kelly inadvertently scored himself, and his friends, the opportunity of a lifetime—a book deal with a real publishing company, real advance money, and a real(ly confused) editor. While his actual ability to read and write remains unclear, Charlie sealed the deal with some off-the-cuff commentary on bird law and the nuances of killing rats (and maybe with the help of some glue fumes in the basement with an unstable editor on a bender). While The Gang is stunned by the news, and the legally binding, irrevocable contract left on the bar, they are also ready to rise to the task and become millionaires—and of course, help Charlie actually write the book.\n\nIn their own inimitable voices, Charlie, Mac, Dennis, Sweet Dee, and Frank weigh in on important topics like Relationships, Financial Success and Career, Fashion and Personal Grooming, Health and Diet, and Survival Skills, providing insane advice, tips, tricks, and recipes (Rum Ham anyone?) as only they can.\n\nFans of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia rejoice and welcome the most influential work in the history of the written word (or at least since the script for The Nightman Cometh): The 7 Secrets of Awakening the Highly Effective Four-Hour Giant, Today.\n\nPublication Date: January 2015\n\nPages: 256\n\nProduct Dimensions: 5.90(w) x 8.90(h) x 0.80(d)\n\nOrdering Information\n\nReturn Policy: We will gladly accept returns for any reason within 30 days of receipt of delivery.\n\nShipping: Ship times are estimates of time in transit after your product leaves the fulfillment center.

Played by Wendi McLendon-Covey and based on creator and show-runner Adam F. Goldberg's real mother, Beverly Goldberg takes every opportunity to cook for her family, putting forth her philosophy: food is love-- and a way to manipulate.\n\nThese seventy recipes, most taken from the same recipe box prominently featured in the show's sixth season, give hungry fans their best chance to cook like Beverly, who uses outlandish quantities of cheeses and meats (with veggies few and far between)--and who doles out unwanted help and snuggies to her ungrateful kids as she goes.\n\nRecipes include Beverly's infamous Shrimp Parm-- and many other Parms, since Parming is her thing; meaty family favorites such as Rib Pot Pie (No Peas, No Carrots), 7-Meat Meatloaf, and Big Tasty Pork; and recipes Bev makes with good (unsolicited) intentions, including Barry's Special Power Chili and Bran Muffins to Help You Make, among many others. Retro food photographs accompany many of the recipes and show stills will showcase the entire Goldberg family in all of their high-strung glory.\n\nPublication Date: 4/2020\n\nPages: 160\n\nProduct Dimensions: 6.40(w) x 8.90(h) x 0.90(d)\n\nOrdering Information\n\nReturn Policy: We will gladly accept returns for any reason within 30 days of receipt of delivery.\n\nShipping: Ship times are estimates of time in transit after your product leaves the fulfillment center. Some items in your order may ship separately to arrive faster.\n\nAvailability: Ships to the United States and Puerto Rico.\n\nShipping Policy: For more information, see our Shipping Policy."
