        "text": "Gail Edwards was born and raised in Coral Gables, Florida. In 1975, after graduating from the University of Miami cum laude, Gail Edwards wrote, produced, and starred in the off-Broadway musical 'Becoming'. It won the Miami Herald Critics' Choice award three times before debuting in New York. While in New York, Edwards signed with the LeMond/Zetter Management Group. Soon afterward, she landed the role of Sandy opposite Peter Gallagher in an East Coast tour of the very long-running musical 'Grease'. After producing and starring in two additional productions, 'The Good One' and 'Vanities', both earning her the Drama-Logue Critics' Award, Edwards turned her focus toward television.\n\nUpon moving to Los Angeles in 1976, Edwards signed with the Ro Diamond Agency (later with the Gersh Agency) and immediately began landing guest-star roles on such television series as Happy Days (1974), Lou Grant (1977), M*A*S*H (1972), and Taxi (1978). In 1979, Edwards auditioned for a Witt/Thomas production, in which she landed the role of Dot Higgins on ABC's It's a Living (1980). The series ran on ABC from 1980-82, and was revived in first-run syndication from 1985-89. Edwards, along with Barrie Youngfellow, Paul Kreppel, and the late Marian Mercer, were the only four members of the It's a Living cast who lasted during the network and syndicated runs. After that show was canceled in 1982, her management was informed by the producers of Happy Days (1974) that they were offering her the role of new character K.C. Cunningham, the niece of Howard and Marion Cunningham, who was moving in with the family.\n\nWithout informing Edwards of the offer, her management declined the opportunity, reportedly stating that they did not want Edwards \"playing a new character on an old show\". Crystal Bernard was then hired for the part. Edwards did not learn of the incident until many years later. In 1985, Edwards and Bernard wound up as co-stars on It's a Living (1980) when it resumed production for first-run syndication. She appeared in many movies-of-the-week during the 1980s, along with numerous other guest-star appearances in such series as Benson (1979), Buffalo Bill (1983), Doogie Howser (1989), Knight Rider (1982), Harrys wundersames Strafgericht (1984), and the premiere episode of Unglaubliche Geschichten (1985), directed by Steven Spielberg.\n\nIn 1990, Edwards was reunited with former Happy Days (1974) producers Thomas L. Miller and Robert L. Boyett, when she was cast as divorced mother \"Hilary Kozak\" on the short-lived CBS sitcom Wo brennt's, Daddy? (1990). Upon that series' cancellation in mid-1991, Edwards was asked by Miller and Boyett to join the cast of their hit ABC series Full House (1987), feeling Edwards was just right for the role of \"Vicky Larson\", a talk show host who strikes up a relationship with Danny Tanner. Edwards made her debut late that year, when the Larson character first appeared as a substitute host on the fictional morning show \"Wake Up, San Francisco\". Vicky and Danny soon embarked on a long-term relationship and were engaged by the seventh season. Edwards' co-star on 'The Family Man', Scott Weinger, was also transferred over to Full House as \"Steve Hale\", D.J.'s high school boyfriend. During her tenure on Full House, Edwards also had a recurring guest role on NBC's Blossom (1990) as \"Sharon LeMeure\", the fast-talking mother of \"Six LeMeure\" (best-friend of the series' titular character).\n\nEdwards concluded her roles on Full House (1987) (with Vicky and Danny breaking up) and Blossom (1990) in 1994. She retired from show business and relocated to Sedona, Arizona. Twenty-three years later, she reprised her role as \"Vicky Larson\" on the reboot of \"Full House\" titled Fuller House (2016) for a 2017 episode reasoning that \"Once an actress is always an actress\". Three years later, she would reprise the role again for the series finale. In 2022, she shared warm memories of working with her leading man Bob Saget to the media, upon learning of his sudden death.\n\nBob Saget was an American actor, stand-up comedian, and television host from Philadelphia. His best known role was playing pater familias Danny Tanner on the hit sitcom \"Full House\" (1987-1995). He played the character again in the sequel series \"Fuller House\" (2016-2020). Saget served as the original host of the long-running clip show \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" from 1989 to 1997. Saget voiced the narrator in the hit sitcom \"How I Met Your Mother\" (2005-2014), depicted as an older version of main character Ted Mosby.\n\nIn 1956, Saget was born to a Jewish family in Philadelphia. His parents were supermarket executive Benjamin Saget and hospital administrator Rosalyn \"Dolly\" Saget. The Saget family eventually moved to Norfolk, Virginia. Bob received his early religious education at Temple Israel, a synagogue of Norfolk which adhered to Conservative Judaism. He was reportedly a rebellious student.\n\nSaget spend part of his high school years in Los Angeles, where he befriended veteran comedian Larry Fine (1902-1975). He attended a Philadelphia high school during his senior year. He was originally interested in a medical career but his English teacher Elaine Zimmerman convinced Saget to aspire to an acting or filmmaking career instead.\n\nSaget received his college education at the \"Center for the Performing and Cinematic Arts\", a college associated with the Temple University of Philadelphia. One of his student films won a merit award at the Student Academy Awards. He graduated college with a Bachelor of Arts in 1978. He had already started performing in comedy clubs during his college years.\n\nIn 1978, Saget intended to take graduate courses at the University of Southern California. He dropped out due to health-related problems. He almost died due to a gangrenous appendix, costing him a loss of confidence. He decided afterwards to lose some weight, in the belief that it would improve his health.\n\nFollowing his graduation, Saget spend about a decade working mostly as a comedian. He appeared in minor acting roles in both films and television. In 1987, Saget was performing comedy bits for the short-lived non-fiction show \"The Morning Program\". The show offered a mix of \"news, entertainment and comedy\", but was canceled due to low ratings.\n\nSaget's big break came when he was chosen to portray widowed father Danny Tanner in the sitcom \"Full House\" (1987-1995). The series depicted Danny's efforts to raise three young daughters, with the assistance of his best friends. The show suffered from poor viewership in its first season, but attracted a family audience due to its portrayal of the struggles associated with parenting. By its third season, it was ranked among Nielsen's Top 30 shows. Saget became a household name, and the series lasted for 8 seasons and 192 episodes. The series was eventually canceled due to its increasing production costs. Its rating had remained high until its final episode.\n\nIn 1989, Saget was chosen as the host of the clip show \"America's Funniest Home Videos\". The show featured humorous homemade videos which were submitted by its viewers, often highlighting physical comedy, pranks, or unusual behavior by children and pets. While the show was popular with viewers, Saget himself was increasingly frustrated with its repetitive format. When his contract for the show expired in 1997, Saget was not interested in negotiating for a renewal.\n\nIn 1996, Saget directed the dramatic television film \"For Hope\". The film depicted the struggles of a woman who is slowly dying due to being afflicted with scleroderma, an autoimmune disease with no known cure. Saget was reportedly inspired by the life and death of his sister Gay Saget, who had died due to scleroderma. The film received high ratings in its debut.\n\nIn 1998, Saget directed the comedy film \"Dirty Work\". It depicted two half-brothers who offer to perform revenge schemes for paying clients, but have a personal grudge against a man who reneged on a deal with them. The film under-performed at the box office, but gained a cult following due to its reputation as a \"gag-fest\".\n\nFrom 2001 to 2002, Saget had the starring role of Matt Stewart in the sitcom \"Raising Dad\". The premise of the series was that widowed father Matt Stewart was trying to raise two daughter, while pursuing a teaching career at his eldest's daughter's high school. Despite the series having a similar concept to \"Full House\", it failed to find an audience. It lasted for a single season.\n\nIn 2005, Saget was cast as the narrator in the sitcom \"How I Met Your Mother\" (2005-2014). The premise of the series was that middle-aged Ted Mosby narrates his life story (and the life stories of his best friends) to his son and daughter. The series repeatedly implied that Ted was an unreliable narrator, who either embellished or censored aspects of his various stories. The series was quite popular, lasting for 9 seasons and 208 episodes.\n\nIn 2007, Saget directed the direct-to-video parody film \"Farce of the Penguins\". The film was a full-length parody of the documentary film \"March of the Penguins\" (2005), featuring penguins conversing about their love lives. It featured the voices of several then-popular actors, including several of Saget's former co-stars from \"Full House\".\n\nIn 2009, Saget was cast in the main role of Steve Patterson in the sitcom \"Surviving Suburbia\". The premise of the series was that the members of a suburban family have problems in interacting both with each other, and with their new neighbors. The series only lasted a single season, and struggled with low ratings.\n\nIn 2014, Saget published his memoirs under the title \"Dirty Daddy\". In 2016, a sequel series to \"Full House\" was introduced under the title \"Fuller House\". It featured the lives of two of Danny Tanner's daughters, and Danny's grandchildren. Saget played the recurring role of Danny for 15 episodes. The sequel series lasted for 5 seasons. This was Saget's last major role in a sitcom. He continued, however, to regularly host television events.\n\nIn January 2022, Saget was in Florida for a stand-up tour. On January 9, Saget was discovered dead in his hotel room at the Ritz-Carlton Orlando, located south of Orlando, Florida. He was 65-years-old. His autopsy revealed that the cause of death was blunt head trauma from an accidental blow to the back of his head, likely from a fall. He had died in his sleep. He was buried at the Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery, next to the graves of his parents and his sister. Mourners honored Saget by offering donations to the charity \"Scleroderma Research Foundation\" (SRF), since Saget had long served in its board of directors. Saget is gone, but his popularity endures due to his acting and directing roles in several popular films and television shows."
