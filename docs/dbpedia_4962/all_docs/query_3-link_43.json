Fans,\n\nJewish or not, have\n\nbeen outraged by the\n\nway Disney, and other\n\nstudios, have eliminated the Jewish origins of Marvel Comic\n\ncharacters when they\n\nappear in films or TV.\n\nThe site InsideMagic\n\nrecently said that fans\n\nare anxious because\n\nâMarvel Studios has\n\nerased the Jewish heritage of similar characters such as Wanda\n\nMaximoff/AKA the\n\nScarlett Witch.â\n\nThis site, and others,\n\nalso noted that Wanda,\n\nlike other Jewish characters, were played by\n\nnon-Jewish actors, and\n\nthat casting practice\n\ncontinued in âMoon\n\nKnight.â Oscar Isaac,\n\na Hispanic actor who\n\nwas raised an evangelical Christian, plays\n\nMoon Knight in the\n\nDisney series.\n\nIsaac has had a good\n\non March 30.

Mr.\n\nSmukler, a Moscow born and bred Jewish entrepreneur,\n\nhas spent roughly half of his life as a Russian and half as\n\nan American; as a businessman with interests both here\n\nand in the former Soviet Union, heâs got connections\n\nthere, and so he can learn things that are harder for\n\noutsiders to glean. Although conditions on the ground\n\nand in negotiations may change daily, Mr.Smuklerâs\n\ninsights and analysis are aimed at giving our readers the\n\nmost comprehensive overview of the situation possible.\n\nHereâs the fourth in our series of talks with Mr.\n\nSmukler.\n\nAs we know, so far almost four million refugees,\n\nalmost all of them women and their children, or men\n\nwho are too old, too young, or too disabled for military\n\nservice, have fled Ukraine.\n\nâThe U. S. has confirmed that they are willing to\n\naccept about 100,000 refugees from Ukraine,â Mr.\n\nSmukler said; last week, before that decision had been\n\nannounced, heâd been worried about the United Statesâ\n\nreluctance to open the golden door that heâd walked\n\nthrough as an immigrant, more than 30 years ago.\n\nOne hundred thousand people might be a small percentage of the four million refugees â some of whom\n\nwould like to go back home if that would prove to be\n\npossible â but âit seems to me that itâs just a first step,\n\nand that is very promising,â Mr. Smukler said. The logistics involved in bringing the refugees over are formidable, so 100,000 is a realistic number to start with, he\n\nadded. âI applaud it.\n\nâI hope that HIAS will open their hotline and start\n\naccepting applications from refugees from Ukraine with\n\nJewish backgrounds and direct relatives already in the\n\nUnited States,â he said. Mr. Smukler has been unhappy\n\nwith HIASâs reluctance to do so until now. (HIAS is the\n\nU.S.-based organization once clearly called the Hebrew\n\nImmigrant Aid Society.)\n\nAs for the battlefield that is Ukraine, âWe already\n\nrealized that the situation is kind of frozen now,â he said\n\nâPutinâs army is losing territory that it recently occupied. They recently occupied Irpin, a very important\n\ntown, a strategic point in front of Kiev. The Ukrainians\n\ntook it back. That is extremely important.\n\nâIt seems to me that the Russians have not moved at\n\nall, but at the same time they are trying to improve and\n\nsolve their logistical problems, trying to get supplies to\n\ntheir armies.\n\nâI think that right now they are replacing the soldiers\n\nand officers who already have spent a month in the\n\nfight. Theyâre replacing them with fresh soldiers. Thatâs\n\nparticularly true of the national guard. Their morale is\n\non such a very low level that they really need to bring\n\nin new soldiers.â\n\nAnd no, he added, the supply of new soldiers has not\n\nrun out yet. Russia has not yet started a military draft.\n\nInstead, âtheyâre sending more and more troops from\n\nthe regular army, from the national guard, and from\n\nChechnya. There are already more than 40,000 troops\n\nfrom Chechnya fighting in Ukraine.â\n\nThe sanctions that the United States, NATO, and\n\nother Western powers have imposed on Russia have\n\nstarted to bite, Mr. Smukler said. âThe economic situation is rapidly going down. More and more people\n\nrealize that the sanctions basically took all their wealth,\n\nbecause their bank accounts, particularly hot currency,\n\nare totally frozen.\n\nâThe sanctions really targeted the Russian middle\n\nand upper middle classes. Middle-class Russians are\n\nvery much hurt.\n\nâDuring the last month, according to unofficial information, more than 800,000 Russians lost their jobs\n\nThis pro-Ukraine march took place in Krakowâs Main Square on March 24, 2022.

One of the\n\nadvantages a dictator holds is the\n\nability to control the information his\n\npeople are fed. âAmazingly, during\n\nthe last week, Putinâs ratingâ â his\n\nfavorability rating, that is, and of\n\ncourse who knows how truthful\n\nrespondents feel they can be as they\n\nanswer these questions â âwent up\n\nfrom 71 to 79 percent in support and\n\npopularity,â Mr. Smukler said.\n\nâI got these numbers from independent sources that are not controlled by the government. Some\n\nsay they went from 71 to 74, some say to 78, and several\n\nindependent sources say it reached 79. To me, personally, based on my knowledge and understanding and\n\ncontacts, I think thatâs a true number.\n\nâThis is the scariest of all to me.â\n\nOddly, ironically, itâs because of the sanctions, Mr.\n\nSmukler continued. âInstead of making Putinâs regime\n\nweaker, at least until today itâs making it stronger,â he\n\nsaid. âThatâs because people\n\nunite around him.\n\nâItâs extremely important to\n\nunderstand the Russian mentality, and how it is different\n\nfrom the U.S. mentality,â he\n\nsaid.\n\nFor one thing, thereâs Russiaâs history up until the 1917\n\nrevolution. Life for most Russians was hard then. It was\n\nhard after the revolution, and\n\nnightmarish during World War\n\nII and its aftermath. But, Mr.\n\nSmukler stressed, the countryâs hard times did not end\n\nwith the Cold War.\n\nâItâs totally different for Russians than for Americans,â he\n\nsaid. âDuring the last 35 years\n\nsince the collapse of the Soviet\n\nUnion, Russians have suffered\n\nso much.\n\nâThere were very difficult\n\nyears at the beginning of the\n\n90s,â when it was good to be a friend of Vladimir Putinâs\n\nbut not so good to be an ordinary, not particularly connected plebian as the economy cratered; âthe default\n\nin 1998,â based on the governmentâs decisions about\n\nIsraelis listen to Ukraineâs President Volodymyr Zelensky as they demonstrate against\n\nPutinâs war in Tel Aviv on March 20, 2022. CHEN LEOPOLD/FLASH90\n\nP:08\n\nLocal\n\nJS-8\n\n8 JEWISH STANDARD APRIL 1, 2022\n\nthe ruble; âthe world financial crisis in\n\n2008, and then the sanctions that were\n\nimposed in 2014, after the invasion of\n\nCrimea.\n\nâSo Russians are used to sanctions, and\n\nthey are used to how much they hurt them\n\npersonally,â Mr. Smukler said. âInstead of\n\ngoing to the streets to start demonstrating\n\nand demanding Putinâs impeachment, we\n\nsee the opposite reaction.\n\nâMost of the Russians are united with\n\nthe regime.â\n\nHere is a good place to remind our\n\nreaders that Mr. Smukler calls Vladimir\n\nPutin the angry dwarf and describes him\n\nas a man fueled by hatred, much of it left\n\nover from the world war that had ended\n\njust a few years before his birth, and\n\nmuch of it based in his own relationship\n\nto power.\n\nIn this, he is very Russian.\n\nOne reason for the Russiansâ response\n\nto the privations theyâre facing is their\n\nhistory and their ingrained pessimism,\n\nbut thatâs far from the only reason.\n\nâPutinâs regime has completely shut\n\ndown almost all sources of information\n\nfor the Russian population, so today\n\nthey can see only Russian propaganda\n\non Russian state TV stations,â Mr. Smukler said.\n\nâOn Monday, the last independent\n\nnewspaper shut down.â Thatâs the\n\nNovaya Gazeta âin English, the New\n\nGazette â whose editor, Dmitry Muratov,\n\nwon the Nobel Peace Prize just last year.\n\nHe and the other winner, Filipina-American journalist Maria Ressa, were cited\n\nfor âtheir efforts to safeguard freedom of\n\nexpression, which is a precondition for\n\ndemocracy and lasting peace.â\n\nYeah, right.\n\nâThe Novaya Gazeta was the last independent paper not controlled by the\n\ngovernment,â Mr. Smukler said. âIt was\n\nthe only one that published true information. So on Monday, they distributed\n\na statement saying that they cannot\n\noperate under such strong pressure\n\nfrom the government.\n\nâSo today the Russian population has\n\nabsolutely no way to get independent\n\ninformation from the West, except maybe\n\nfrom short wave stations, like the Voice\n\nof America and Liberty Radio from Germany, and the BBC, in Russian. Itâs Cold\n\nWar style, old-school style, and because\n\nitâs on short wave the younger generation\n\ndoesnât know how to listen to it.â\n\nWhat about phone calls? âSo far\n\ntheyâre still getting through, but the\n\nRussians never talk openly on the phone\n\nbecause they believe that all calls are\n\ntapped.\n\nâWhatsApp,â which had been working last week, âFacebook, Instagram,\n\nand TikTok have been shut down,â Mr.\n\nSmukler continued.\n\nHe has been able to talk to his contacts\n\non the one platform thatâs still available.\n\nâWe are using a special communications\n\nchannel through Telegram, which we\n\nestablished on a VPN. Itâs still working.â\n\nGiven that Putin has near-complete\n\ncontrol over the information Russians\n\nget, he is working hard to shape that\n\ninformation.\n\nâToday, Russian propaganda has such\n\nan important card to play,â Mr. Smukler said. That card, he believes, is Joe\n\nBidenâs concluding statement, the nine\n\nwords with which he ended his well-received 27-minute speech in Warsaw on\n\nSaturday. Those words, which seem to\n\nhave been ad-libbed and heartfelt, which\n\nthe White House since has walked back,\n\nalthough the president has refused to\n\ndo so, and which have galvanized public\n\nopinion here in the United States, were\n\nâFor Godâs sake, this man cannot remain\n\nin power.â\n\nFor Vladimir Putin, those words were\n\npure gold, Mr. Smukler said.\n\nâHe can say, âYou see, theyââ â the\n\nUnited States in particular and the West\n\nin general â âare trying to change the\n\nregime. Biden has been doing that from\n\nthe time that he got to the White House.\n\nâSo â exactly as we said when we\n\nfirst talked a month ago â Putin is trying to present his âspecial operationâ\n\nin Ukraine as just the first stage of the\n\nglobal war against the West, the United\n\nStates, and NATO.\n\nUntil then, Putin is saying, his adversaries have denied their real goals, but\n\nânow, heâs saying, they have taken the\n\nmasks off and theyâre saying openly that\n\nthey want regime change.\n\nâUnfortunately, I think a lot of Russians believe that.\n\nâMy connections in Russia â very\n\nhigh level and knowledgeable people â\n\nsaid to me that the statement that Biden\n\nmade in Poland is the whole ballgame.\n\nIt changes everything. It has completely\n\nchanged the rhetoric of the Russian\n\npropaganda.\n\nâThe propaganda now is âSee? We told\n\nyou! We told you the truth and nothing\n\nbut the truth.\n\nââAnd the truth is that it has nothing to\n\ndo with Ukraine. Ukraine is just a battlefield in the global war. We are defending\n\nourselves in this global war.\n\nââJust listen to what their president\n\nsaid!â\n\nâThis is making me really nervous,â\n\nMr. Smukler said, as he stopped channeling Russian propaganda and spoke\n\nonce again in his own voice. âThis is a\n\nreal escalation of the global conflict. I\n\ndonât understand how our president is\n\nmaking such statements. It is basically\n\nclosing the door for his negotiations or\n\nfor any negotiations between Russia and\n\nNATO or the United States.\n\nâSo I am even more scared today than\n\nI was three weeks ago, because as of\n\ntoday we are not moving toward peace.\n\nThe conflict is escalating to a new level.\n\nItâs becoming more like a global conflict\n\nbetween Russia and the United States.â\n\nAnd if this werenât enough, thereâs\n\nmore.\n\nâSanctions are giving an enormous\n\nbenefit to China,â Mr. Smukler said.\n\nâSanctions were implemented at the\n\nbeginning of March, and the Chinese\n\nare everywhere, buying every asset. The\n\nChinese already are in every possible\n\nniche in the economy. Theyâre already\n\nthere.\n\nâTheyâre buying strategic Russian\n\ncompanies, especially oil and gas and\n\nmineral resources. Russia is moving with\n\nunbelievably rapid speed to becoming a\n\nChinese colony.\n\nâThe situation in Ukraine and global\n\nconflict is benefitting China.â\n\nThere is one more historic irony that\n\nMr. Smukler pointed out.\n\nâThe brutal sanctions that were\n\nimplemented on the Russian economy are turning the Russian economy\n\ntoward so-called national socialism,â\n\nhe said. If that sounds familiar to readers, itâs because Nazis called themselves\n\nnational socialists.\n\nâIt took just one month,â he said.\n\nâThis is a real revolution, like the revolution in 1917 when the monarchy was\n\noverthrown.\n\nâRight now, almost all of the foreign\n\ncompanies and foreign investors are\n\ngone, and most of the Russian companies are controlled by the government.\n\nIt reminds me of Germany at the beginning of the 1930s.\n\nâThis is very similar to that,â Mr.\n\nSmukler said. âThe country is moving\n\ntoward national socialism.â\n\nBut at least this time, Europe and\n\nnow the United States are taking in refugees. Itâs a small ray of hope, but itâs not\n\nnothing.\n\nA staffer at the Israeli field hospital Kohav Meir plays with children near Lviv,\n\nUkraine, on March 23, 2022.

They were looking for things like\n\nmezuzot, kiddush cups, candlesticks, Russian-language\n\nprayerbooks, and also Purim costumes and decorations for the holiday that was coming up the following\n\nThursday.\n\nAnd that is how Rachel Piontnica and her fellow\n\nYU students ended up bringing 1,440 kippot and 350\n\nPurim costumes, plus many other items, packed into\n\n45 duffel bags.\n\nWhen they landed in Vienna on March 13, they sorted\n\nall the donations and set up a costume pop-up shop for\n\nthe children among the 500 Jewish Ukrainian refugees\n\nalready in the city.\n\nWhy Vienna? Aliza Abrams Konig, the senior program director for the universityâs Leadership Scholars,\n\nexplained that she was asked by Erica Brown, director\n\nof YUâs Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks Center for Values\n\nand Leadership, to organize a student response to the\n\nUkrainian refugees. The request came from YUâS president, Rabbi Dr. Ari Berman of Teaneck. (Rabbi Berman\n\nwrites about the trip on page 16.)\n\nâMy husband, Sam, is from Austria and my in-laws are\n\nPolish, so we have a lot of contacts there,â Ms. Konig\n\nsaid. âI reached out to several people, and in Poland\n\nthey said it wasnât helpful to have non-Russian speakers,\n\nbut in Vienna they really needed help.\n\nâSo within 48 hours we put together the whole trip.\n\nWe posted an application late Tuesday night, and by\n\nWednesday night we had 125 applicants.â\n\nIn addition to seeking Russian and German speakers,\n\nthe administrators were looking for students âready\n\nto roll up their sleeves and do whatever was needed,\n\nwhoâd understand that extreme flexibility would be\n\nneeded as the situation changes rapidly,â she said.\n\nâWe knew it would be an intense and emotional environment so we wanted students who could handle that\n\nas well.â\n\nYU subsidized the trip; each student paid $500 to offset the cost. Meanwhile, Ms. Konig worked with someone\n\nAt left and right, Yedidya Schechter and young friends show off their Purim costumes; center, Rachel Piontnica and another friend display their art projects,\n\nwhich are self-portraits.\n\nFrom left, Stern College students Meira Axelrod, Annabelle Muller, Ayelet Brown, and Rachel Piontnica\n\nplay with refugee kids.

But often we\n\nhad to find other ways to communicate with them. We\n\nsometimes used Google Translate on our phones, or we\n\nwould use a smile or hand gestures â anything just to\n\nshow that we were there for them.â\n\nThe YU students were housed in an apartment building owned by a local Jewish couple who also arranged\n\nShabbat meals with community members.\n\nOn Purim, the 13 men and 15 women from YU celebrated with the refugees and their local hosts.\n\nâThere was this one little girl, she was probably 9,\n\nwhom Iâd met the day before, and when I saw her there,\n\nI started dancing with her. She walked away for a second\n\nand came back and gave me the biggest hug and handed\n\nme a strawberry Laffy Taffy,â Ms. Piontnica recalled.\n\nâAnd then for the rest of the trip, every time we ran\n\ninto her, she came up to me and gave me a big hug. We\n\ncouldnât really talk to each other because I didnât speak\n\nRussian and she didnât speak English or Hebrew, but\n\njust the smile on her face and knowing that we were\n\nthere for each other was really special.â\n\nYedidya Schechter of Monsey, a 21-year-old psychology major at Yeshiva College, said he applied to go on\n\nthe mission because he was tired of feeling helpless.\n\nâYou know, we listen to the news about whatâs happening in Ukraine and just feel like we canât do anything except feel sad for them,â he said. âSo I saw this\n\nas an opportunity for me to actually make an impact on\n\npeople, to go out of my comfort zone and help people.â\n\nThe Viennese Jewish communityâs Purim gala made\n\na big impression on Mr. Schechter.\n\nâEveryone â the Viennese Jews, the Ukrainian refugees, Russians, YU students â we were all dancing and\n\nfull of happiness together, and that really left an impact\n\non me,â he said.\n\nThereâs a photo of Mr. Schechter dancing with a\n\n6-year-old girl whose father was back in Ukraine fighting the Russian troops.\n\nâThis sweet little girl didnât know a word of English.\n\nShe was standing there in a cute Minnie Mouse costume that weâd brought. And at one point she came\n\nover to me and tapped my shoulders and I understood\n\nshe wanted me to pick her up. So I put her on my shoulders and we danced for like 10 minutes. I really got\n\nteary â here is this girl whose father is still in Ukraine\n\nand we were able to bring a little bit of happiness to her\n\nat this moment. It was just so incredible.â\n\nMr. Schechter said heâd been always pictured refugees as âdisheveled people wearing sackcloth, fleeing\n\nfrom a third world country. But these were normal people who just wanted to live a normal life. They were just\n\nlike you and me except that they got displaced and lost\n\neverything and had to move. That really threw me for\n\na loop; it was not what I had expected.â\n\nMs. Piontnica added, âGrowing up, we always heard\n\nthat people had to leave their homes during the Holocaust, but it was never something that I thought I would\n\nsee in my lifetime. And I never thought it was something that I would experience. I thought it wouldnât\n\nreally become a reality, but it is. It is definitely a reality,\n\nwhich was terrifying and devastating.â\n\nShe and Mr. Schechter said they are encouraging\n\npeople to give financial support to the communities\n\nin several countries that are housing and feeding thousands of Ukrainian refugees.\n\nâIt costs the Jewish community in Vienna over\n\n$100,000 a week to support them,â Ms. Piontnica said.\n\nâWhat was really incredible is that they take in anyone\n\nwho needs a place and, afterward, they try to figure out\n\nhow theyâre going to help them. Theyâre never going to\n\nleave anyone stranded who needs a place to go.â\n\nYedidya Schechter holds a Minnie Mouse look-alike\n\non his shoulders.\n\nThe YU group is at the airport, ready to leave for Vienna.\n\nP:15\n\nJS-15\n\nJEWISH STANDARD APRIL 1, 2022 15\n\nPlease order at least 72 hours in advance.

ARI BERMAN\n\nEarlier in March, I passed\n\nthe balcony of the Hofburg Palace where, on\n\nMarch 15, 1938, Adolph\n\nHitler announced the Austrian\n\nAnschluss to Nazi Germany. Approximately 200,000 Austrians stood on\n\nthe Heldenplatz cheering that day.\n\nI watched the grainy black and\n\nwhite video of his speech, chilled\n\nwith disbelief, as I stood in that same\n\nplace. Moments later, I met with\n\nWolfgang Sobotka, the President of\n\nthe Austrian National Council, the\n\nAustrian equivalent of our Speaker\n\nof the House, whose own grandfather was a Nazi.\n\nSobotka was addressing our group\n\nof 28 Yeshiva University students\n\nthat afternoon; they were part of\n\nour emergency humanitarian mission\n\nto Vienna to work with Ukrainian refugees. With tears in his eyes, Sobotka\n\ntold us that his grandfather closed his\n\nlast will and testament with the words\n\nâAlways trust the leader.â Sobotka\n\nshook his head, lost in\n\nthought. âBut his library\n\ncontained the works of\n\nSchiller and Goethe,â he\n\nsaid, as if beautiful literature alone can produce\n\nvirtue. Sobotka has forged\n\nhis own path as a fighter\n\nagainst antisemitism and\n\na champion of the Viennese Jewish community.\n\nMoreover, Sobotka and his\n\ncountry are responding\n\nto the current call of history by sheltering 1,000 to 2,000 new\n\nUkrainian refugees a day.\n\nStudying in New York, our students\n\nprayed on behalf of the Ukrainian refugees. They gave charity, tzedakah. But\n\nbeing heirs to a tradition that demands\n\npersonal responsibility in the face of\n\ngreat human need, we understood that\n\nthis was not enough. As the flagship Jewish university, we had to respond immediately and in person. And so Operation\n\nTorat Chesed was born.\n\nIn two days, we organized a group\n\nof student volunteers. More than 100\n\nstudents applied to be in the group of\n\n28 students who were to join this trip,\n\nwhich was led by two of our distinguished educators, Rabbi Josh Blass\n\nand Dr. Erica Brown. We received a list\n\nof needs for the refugees, and students\n\ninstantly began to raise money and collect items, including laptops so they\n\ncould create an internet cafÃ© to process\n\npapers and cell phones for refugees so\n\nthey could be in touch with loved ones.\n\nMost of the refugees\n\nwere women and children,\n\nsince men from the ages of\n\n18 to 60 are either drafted\n\nto the Ukrainian army or\n\nawaiting notice of that\n\ndraft. We met boys and\n\ngirls who were not sure\n\nwhen they would see their\n\nfathers again. Within days\n\nof arriving in Vienna, they\n\nwere sent to new schools,\n\nwhere they do not know\n\nthe language but, at least,\n\nare given a daily structure, surrounded\n\nby other children.\n\nThe studentsâ humanitarian efforts\n\nput them in contact with all of the\n\nUkrainian refugees traveling through\n\nVienna, with a significant amount of\n\ntime focused on the Jewish community.\n\nThe Viennese Jewish community of\n\n8,000 already had taken in 500 Jewish refugees and is expecting an additional 1,000 in the weeks ahead. Oskar\n\nDeutsch, the president of the Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien, Viennaâs\n\nJewish community, told our students\n\nthat his council met to discuss how\n\nmany refugees they could take in. But\n\nthey refused to quantify the number or\n\ncreate a cap. âCan we take more? We\n\nhave to. Itâs our obligation.\n\nâWe have to take as many we can.â\n\nThe YU students played games and did\n\narts and craft projects on the floor with\n\nchildren, who represent 40% of the Jewish refugee population in Vienna. The\n\nstudents also mopped floors, cleared\n\nout garbage, and prepared new hotel\n\nrooms to house incoming refugees. They\n\nwent to the central offices of the community to work on a database and a social\n\nmedia campaign. The charity drive they\n\nlaunched successfully raised more than\n\n$100,000 to pay for a weekâs worth of\n\nfood for the refugees. They sat with refugees at meals, and sometimes with nothing more than the universal language of\n\na smile, tried to bring comfort.\n\nHumanitarian work can feel overwhelming. More than one of our students broke down during the trip,\n\nwondering how they could possibly\n\nmake a difference in the lives of so many\n\nrefugees, whose needs are so great and\n\nincrease every day. Their volunteer work\n\nbrought some insight to the answer. Narrowing millions of faceless refugees to a\n\nfew hundred people with whom we had\n\nregular contact throughout the week\n\nenabled our students to forge a connection not with ârefugeesâ but with the\n\nperson in front of them.\n\nWe could not help everyone, but we\n\ncould be present for the person in front\n\nof us, at this moment in their lives.\n\nI opened with a view from the balcony, so to speak, and want to close\n\nwith it as well. Nobel Prize laureate Elie\n\nWiesel delivered a speech from that very\n\nspot, a place the Viennese call Hitlerâs\n\nBalcony, on June 17, 1992.\n\nâThe balcony is nothing,â he said. âIt\n\nis a symbol, nothing more. The purification, the change cannot come from the\n\nbalcony. It must come from below.â We\n\nstood below that balcony and understood\n\nthat while we pray that God brings peace\n\nto the region and shelter to the refugees,\n\nwe cannot leave it all to God. In the Talmud, we have an expression, âDo not\n\nrely upon a miracle.â Our job is to create\n\nsmall miracles for others. By seeing the\n\nDivine in the face of every stranger and in\n\nthe face of every refugee, we partner with\n\nGod in the work of salvation.\n\nMay we see the blessings of peace\n\nflourish throughout the world.\n\nRabbi Dr. Ari Berman of Teaneck is the\n\npresident of Yeshiva University.\n\nRabbi Dr. Ari Berman\n\nThe two men in the center of the group of YU students are Rabbi Ari Berman, in a suit, and Austrian politician Wolfgang\n\nSobotka, in a YU sweatshirt.\n\nBy seeing the\n\nDivine in the\n\nface of every\n\nstranger and in\n\nthe face of\n\nevery refugee,\n\nwe partner with\n\nGod in the work\n\nof salvation.\n\nP:17\n\nJS-17\n\nJEWISH STANDARD APRIL 1, 2022 17\n\nexplore\n\nWell-known for its majestic views and breathtaking scenery, the\n\nPacific Northwest is also home to one of Americaâs premier wine\n\ngrowing regions.\n\nBenefiting from the warm stable weather of the West Coast, mixed\n\nwith the cooler nights of northern latitudes, wines from Oregon and\n\nWashington feature lively ripe fruit of New World wines mixed with\n\nthe refreshing acidity that Old World wine.

Itâs morally deadening\n\nbad teaching, two high-school students in Oswego, N.Y.,\n\ndecided in 2017, when their teacher gave their class that\n\nassignment. They were in a class of 75 students, and the\n\nproject had been assigned for four years, drawing no\n\ncomplaints, before it was their turn.\n\nThe two students â who, by the way, were not Jewish; it seems that no one in their class was â tried to\n\ntalk to their teacher about their discomfort, but he was\n\nunsympathetic. So, eventually, was New York Stateâs\n\ncommissioner of education, at least at first. But then\n\nthe Anti-Defamation League took on the cause, and\n\nthe media picked up the story, and eventually the commission backed down, the teacher backed off, and the\n\nproject was pulled.\n\nSoon after the story unfolded, Liza Wiemer, a Milwaukee-based writer with a background in education\n\nwho had written nonfiction and novels for both adults\n\nand teenagers, was in Oswego, on her way to Syracuse,\n\nfor a book reading when she happened into a bookstore called Three Rivers. Sheâd just read a story about\n\nthe assignment that included photos of the two students whoâd fought against it, and she was astonished\n\nto find one of them in the bookstore. âYou could call\n\nthat Divine Providence, or you could call it a series of\n\nremarkable events,â Ms. Wiemer said. Either way, it\n\nwas inspirational.\n\nFeeling compelled to write a book about the incident,\n\nMs. Wiemer researched the Holocaust, as well as the\n\nmore recent national and local history, sociology, and\n\npsychology that must be incorporated into the narrative. That book, âThe Assignment,â shows what happened in the class, and after it.\n\nThe book is fiction; Ms. Wiemer made the kind of\n\nchanges that make it easier for a reader to be enveloped by the story. In real life, the class had 75 students;\n\nin âThe Assignment,â there are 17, so that Ms. Wiemer\n\ncan examine each one more thoroughly. The heroes\n\nof âThe Assignmentâ are not exactly the heroes of\n\n2017 Oswego; the real teensâ courage, passion, and\n\npersistence are in the book, but their specific backstories do not belong there and so are not included, Ms.\n\nWiemer said.\n\nMs. Wiemer will be in north Jersey next week to\n\ntalk about the book; the details of her trip show the\n\nwide-ranging appeal of âThe Assignment.â She will\n\nspeak at the Solomon Schechter Day School of Bergen\n\nCounty in New Milford, the Roosevelt Middle School\n\nand the Liberty Middle School, both in West Orange,\n\nand Maâayanot Yeshiva High School for Girls in Teaneck.\n\nIn other words, sheâll be at public and day schools, at\n\nmiddle and high schools, at Conservative, Orthodox,\n\nand secular schools.\n\nThatâs rare.\n\nOne of the reasons that her novel â technically itâs a\n\nYA book, but it appeals to adults as well, as its diverse\n\nreadership shows â is so widely read now is because\n\nthe teaching technique it describes, and against which\n\nit argues, is popular. And it is harmful.\n\nâMy novel works on many levels, but one is to\n\nenlighten educators and prevent assignments like the\n\none in the book from happening in the first place,â Ms.\n\nWiemer said.\n\nâThe book is being used as part of the curriculum that\n\neducates about the Holocaust, but also teaches that\n\nantisemitism and hatred and bigotry and injustice connect the Holocaust and World War II to antisemitism,\n\nbigotry, and injustice in society today.\n\nâThis book also empowers our youth, and all human\n\nbeings, to be allies and upstanders against any form of\n\ninjustice.â\n\nThe teaching method used in Oswego, and in her\n\nbook â asking students to imagine themselves into the\n\nminds and contexts of people in very different times,\n\nplaces, and situations than their own â âis widely used;\n\nthe vast majority of these assignments are misguided\n\nand thoughtless,â Ms. Wiemer said. âThey are being\n\ngiven on a regular basis across this country, and the\n\nvast majority of them go unchallenged and unreported.\n\nâTeachers feel that they should teach history from\n\nboth sides. They donât recognize that this is extremely\n\nharmful and hurtful. A typical assignment is asking students to recreate the Underground Railroad.\n\nâThere is no way that doing obstacle courses in any\n\nway recreates the trauma.â Nor do other, similar exercises, like putting Black students in pretend chains to\n\nsimulate what their ancestors must have felt. It does\n\nnot, but it does harm both them and the white students\n\nwho watch. Such exercises both demean the people\n\nwho had to undergo and either survive or fail to survive\n\nthem and diminish their brutality and evil.\n\nâItâs like having students sleep in a tent for a night so\n\nthey can understand what itâs like to be homeless,â Ms.\n\nWiemer said.\n\nWhen students are given assignments like these and\n\nthey object â most of the time they donât, and neither\n\nLiza Wiemer holds copies of her book in Italian,\n\nEnglish, and Polish.

Sometimes a school will double down\n\nand justify why they feel that this is right. Or they will\n\nimmediately recognize the harm it causes and stop it.\n\nâPersonally, I think that it is much better for the\n\nschool and the community if it can be handled without\n\nit hitting the media,â she continued. âOverall, that is a\n\nmuch healthier experience, and it leads to better communication.â But sometimes, as in Oswego and then in\n\nâThe Assignment,â that doesnât work. âThen it has to hit\n\nthe news in order for it to be stopped.â\n\nThe assignment in her book is meant to teach about\n\nantisemitism, but in trying to recreate a scene of deadly\n\nhistoric antisemitism that had catastrophic effects on\n\nreal lives, it went too far. âIt crosses a moral line,â Ms.\n\nWiemer said. âThere is absolutely no justification for\n\ngenocide,â but the students, in their roles as Nazis,\n\nwere asked to provide such justifications. âThe real\n\nteens,â the ones she based her story on, ârecognized\n\nthat. So did the teens in my novel, and they stick to\n\ntheir guns. They have the courage to draw a clear line\n\nbetween whatâs right and whatâs wrong.â\n\nHer novel does not discuss the real teensâ motivations and backstories. That would be an invasion of\n\ntheir privacy, something Ms. Wiemer does not want\n\nto do. âIn my novel, one of the characters recognizes\n\nclearly that it is immoral to justify genocide. It is necessary to learn about the Holocaust and what the Nazis\n\nbelieved, but we should never try to justify it.\n\nâThis assignment creates cognitive dissonance. The\n\nmoment you open the door to those arguments, you\n\nallow them some justification. Unfortunately, we live in\n\na society where people feel that these kinds of value systems, which we see in white supremacy, are acceptable.\n\nâBut there has to be a clear line. This doesnât belong\n\nin the classroom.â\n\nSomething about Ms. Wiemerâs novel seems to have\n\nhit a societal nerve. Itâs won many awards and has been\n\nnamed a 2021 Sydney Taylor notable book; Sydney Taylor wrote the deeply beloved All-Of-A-Kind Family novels.\n\nMs. Wiemer is a speaker as well as a novelist and she\n\nleads workshops; sheâs been going around the newly\n\nreopened-after-covid country to talk about her book.\n\nSheâs spoken at Jewish and secular private and public\n\nschools, as well as to other Jewish groups.\n\nAs deeply Jewish as she is â âyou canât take the Jewish out of Liza Wiemer,â she said â âI am so grateful\n\nand humbled to see that this book is having a direct\n\nand concrete impact on putting a stop to antisemitism.â\n\n(Sheâs also passionate about other kinds of hatred and\n\nbigotry; her Jewish values make her want justice for\n\neveryone, she added.)\n\nâWe have seen similar projects across the country.\n\nThe book has empowered students to speak to their\n\nteachers, and because of it these assignments have\n\nbeen stopped again and again.\n\nâAnd I have been contacted by teachers who have said\n\nthat theyâve given similar assignments in the past, but\n\ntheyâll never do that again.\n\nâThatâs what we want,â she continued. âWe donât\n\nwant it hitting the news. The vast majority of teachers say this is something theyâve done for years. They\n\ndidnât see how it could be harmful.â Now they know,\n\nshe added.\n\nâWe often say that if we donât learn history, we are\n\ndoomed to repeat it,â Ms. Wiemer said. âBut I see history differently. History is not stuck in the past. It lives\n\nwithin and outside of us, influencing our actions today.â\n\nHistory is never over. âIf you are a Holocaust survivor, that still impacts you today, and it also impacts our\n\nchildren and grandchildren. Thatâs the same for all of\n\nus who have suffered something in the past. Being in\n\nthe past doesnât mean that itâs over. It still influences\n\nour actions.\n\nâThatâs why a novel like âThe Assignmentâ is so\n\nimportant. It makes that connection. It shows clearly\n\nhow the past influences the choices and the actions of\n\nthe characters, and of society.\n\nâAnd until we learn from it, until we chose different\n\nways to treat each other, then we are going to have to\n\ncontinue to deal with it in the now.\n\nâI see each human being as a thread in the fabric\n\nof humanity,â Ms. Wiemer concluded. We are each a\n\nthread. Our actions and our words from the past and\n\nfrom now can have a profound effect on the future.â\n\nLearn more about Liza Wiemer from her website,\n\nlizawiemer.com.\n\nP:20\n\nLocal\n\nJS-20\n\nScheduled acts of random goodness\n\nSchechter celebrates âYom Kindness and Empathyâ\n\nLARRY YUDELSON\n\nI\n\nt was a day of kindness and empathy\n\nat the Solomon Schechter Day School\n\nof Bergen County in New Milford last\n\nFriday.\n\nOr more accurately, it was âYom Kindness and Empathy,â to use the blended\n\nHebrew and English title the school coined\n\nfor the occasion.\n\nFor students from pre-pre-K through\n\nmiddle school, the day offered a break from\n\nthe usual academic rigors, with a variety of\n\nage-appropriate activities.\n\nItâs not that kindness and empathy ordinarily are lacking in the school. But last\n\nyear, the school decided to emphasize five\n\ncharacter strengths and virtues â selected\n\nby parents, faculty, and school leaders from\n\na list of 28 as identified by psychologists\n\nChris Peterson and Martin Seligman in their\n\nwork on positive psychology.\n\nâOur long-term goal is that those character strengths\n\nwill be embedded in the curriculum, whether weâre\n\ntalking about the weekly Torah portion or social studies,â Dr. Ilana Kustanowitz, the schoolâs psychologist\n\nsaid. âBut thatâs a process. We did not want to wait for\n\nthat curricular change to happen.â\n\nMeanwhile, there was Yom Kindness and Empathy,\n\nand the other âspecific days that really focus on and\n\npromote these character strengths so they become part\n\nof the vernacular of the students.â\n\nThe other three traits are gratitude, curiosity, and\n\nperseverance. Yom Gratitude and Yom Curiosity were\n\nobserved in in October and February; Yom Perseverance is scheduled for later this year.\n\nKindness and empathy were grouped together\n\nbecause âtheyâre very connected,â Dr. Kustanowitz\n\nsaid. âWhen you have empathy toward another person\n\nyouâre more likely to respond with kindness.â\n\nThe day began with the eighth graders carpooling\n\nto school early, in order to greet the younger students\n\nwith warmth and paper flowers.\n\nâIt was a really kind and beautiful way to start the\n\nday,â she said.\n\nThe day at Schechter begins with Shacharit prayer\n\nservices; on Yom Kindness and Empathy, a student\n\ngave a dâvar Torah connecting the prayers or the weekly\n\nTorah portion to kindness.\n\nFor the younger grades, guests came in to the classrooms to read appropriate storybooks.\n\nâWe had our security guard and a police officer\n\nread,â Dr. Kustanowitz said. âWe thought they would\n\nbe amazing ambassadors for kindness and empathy.â\n\nIn a project that embodied the motto of writer Anne\n\nHerbert to âpractice random kindness and senseless\n\nbeauty,â students wrote short, kind, encouraging messages on post-it notes and placed them on random\n\npages of books in the school library.\n\nâThe hope is that in the future,\n\nwhen someone picks up the book,\n\nthey will come across the kindness,â\n\nAlexandra Tal, the schoolâs social\n\nworker, said.\n\nStudents were also asked to think\n\nabout kind wishes for one of their\n\nclassmates â and these then were forwarded to Jerusalem to be placed in\n\ncracks in the Western Wall.\n\nMore global still, students learned\n\nhow to make origami and took part\n\nin the Peace Crane Project, which\n\ninvites âevery student on the planet\n\nto fold an origami crane, write a\n\nmessage of peace on its wings, then\n\nexchange it with another student\n\nsomewhere in the world,â according\n\nto its website.\n\nThey also wrote kind expressions\n\n(or drew pictures, for the younger,\n\nless literate students) on magnets, which were placed\n\non door frames throughout the school building.\n\nThe day also featured a basketball game between the\n\neighth graders and faculty members â whose kindness\n\ndid not, in fact, extend to letting their generally shorter\n\nopponents win the game.\n\nThe students learned about empathy with help from\n\na âsilent DJâ who brought a set of headphones for each\n\nstudent, and programmed three channels of music:\n\nOne was contemporary Israeli pop music; one was\n\nIsraeli a capella; and one was classical music played by\n\nIsraeli musicians.\n\nThe students danced to the music on the channels\n\nthat they selected. Amid the resulting fun, a lesson was\n\nbeing taught: Just as they didnât know what music their\n\nfriends were hearing on their headphones and dancing\n\nto, âWe donât know what the other personâs experience\n\nis,â Dr. Kustanowitz said. âWe donât know whatâs in\n\nTaylor Gross and Gideon Apter display a âkindness recipeâ they created.\n\nTali Bruhim and Harry Konotorvich show their origami. Anabel Enis and Or Bar-Oz show the kindness notes they left in random books.\n\n20 JEWISH STANDARD APRIL 1, 2022\n\nPHOTOS COURTESY SSDS-BC\n\nP:21\n\nLocal\n\nJS-21\n\nJEWISH STANDARD APRIL 1, 2022 21\n\n*CDs require a $1,000 minimum balance to open and earn interest.

As a judicial referee,\n\nRabbi Markus, who is a lawyer, presides over\n\ncivil discovery, settlement, and trial proceedings and writes legally binding decisions.\n\nAccordingly, he is bound by all the ethics\n\nrequirements that apply to judges, including\n\nthose those barring public comment about most matters of political or public controversy.\n\nIn determining how these principles apply to a pulpit\n\nrabbi presiding as a judge, Rabbi Markus has asked the\n\nAdvisory Committee to apply established judicial ethics rules to a whole new set of very Jewish situations.\n\nRabbi Markus is believed to be the first practicing pulpit\n\nrabbi to hold a full-time judicial role at the same time.\n\nIn response to a question he raised about his situation, the committee ruled he may âteach, preach, and\n\nwrite on Israel-related issues concerning the law, the\n\nlegal system or the administration of justice, but not\n\non non-legal matters of substantial public and political\n\ncontroversy, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.â\n\nNow, Rabbi Markus hopes to become a full-fledged\n\njudge in the Ninth District, serving on New Yorkâs confusingly named Supreme Court (which actually is a\n\nlower court, not an appellate court, and is not the state\n\nequivalent of the U.S. Supreme Court).\n\nThe path to a Supreme Court seat runs through a\n\nNovember election conducted on partisan lines for a\n\n14-year term, and perhaps more significantly, an August\n\nDemocratic nominating convention to which voters will\n\nelect delegates. (Do partisan nominations and election\n\nseem at odds with judicial standards of nonpartisanship? Yes they do. Does Rabbi Markus want to discuss\n\npolitics? Only so far as to note that with the initials DEM,\n\nperhaps his voter registration was predetermined.)\n\nRabbi Markus, 49, grew up in Westchester County,\n\nand attended the Solomon Schechter day school there.\n\nHis father, Jaacob, is an immigrant. Born in 1945 in a\n\nDisplaced Persons camp in Turkmenistan to Polish\n\nrefugees who had fled east after the Nazis invaded,\n\nhe grew up in Israel and then came to America in the\n\n1960s. His mother, Mona, was born and raised in Yonkers. Rabbi Markus inherited a love of America and a\n\ndesire for service from his father, who was always grateful to the country for taking him in. He continued to\n\nfeel grateful, even after he was severely injured while\n\nserving with the U.S. Army in Vietnam.\n\n(Both Rabbi Markusâs parents are alive and live with\n\ntheir son in Briarcliff Manor. âKibud av vâem means\n\nsomething very direct to me,â he said. âI get to be able to\n\ntake care of them and keep them safe.â)\n\nAfter graduating from Williams College, where he\n\nstudied political science and environmental studies,\n\nRabbi Markus went to Harvard, earning both a law\n\ndegree there and a graduate degree in public policy\n\nfrom its Kennedy School. He graduated from both\n\nthose Harvard schools in 2001. After clerking for two\n\nyears for Judge Albert Rosenblatt on the New York State\n\nCourt of Appeals, he went to work for New York Court\n\nof Appeals Chief Judge Judith Kaye.\n\nâShe was a visionary,â Rabbi Markus said. âNot only\n\nwas she New Yorkâs first female chief judge, she was\n\nalso someone who understood that the structure of our\n\ncourts needed to be transformed if weâre going to do\n\nequal justice for everyone. She gave me an opportunity\n\nto help do this.â\n\nAfter taking a leave of absence in 2008 to become\n\ndeputy director of voting protection for Barack\n\nObamaâs presidential candidate, he worked for two\n\nyears as special counsel to the New York State Senateâs\n\nDemocrats, where he negotiated and drafted legislation. And then in 2011 he took the post as a judicial\n\nreferee.\n\nBut his religious side also exerted a strong pull.\n\nLeading Jewish ritual and talking about spiritual matters came naturally to him. After being raised in the\n\nConservative movement, he spent time in the Reform\n\nmovement. Then, in 2008, he enrolled in Alephâs rabbinical program, which offered both remote classes and\n\npart-time enrollment. That meant that he didnât have\n\nto abandon his legal calling. And at the end of the program, the prospect of a part-time pulpit awaited.\n\nâMaimonides was not a full-time rabbi,â he said. âThe\n\nRambam was a doctor in the palace of the king. The\n\nnotion of the full-time professional rabbi is relatively\n\nnew. The community I serve and the causes I support\n\nin the Jewish community not only donât need a fulltime rabbi. They are best served by rabbis and other\n\nJewish professionals who are fully immersed in the\n\ncommunity.â\n\nThat said, when after ordination he chose a pulpit,\n\nTemple Beth El was particularly appealing because it\n\nwas about as close to his Westchester home as he could\n\nget while still being outside his judicial district, thus drastically decreasing the already\n\nslim likelihood that one of his congregants\n\nmight appear in his courtroom. (Congregants\n\ndo come from beyond City Island, including\n\nWestchester as well as Queens, and since\n\ncovid added an online dimension to his rabbinate, he has a student attending his Torah\n\nstudy class Zooming in from the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean east of Africa.)\n\nRabbi Markus also is on the faculty of the\n\nAcademy for Jewish Religion in Yonkers.\n\nâI get to help people find meaning in their\n\nlives,â he said. âI canât imagine anything\n\nbetter.â\n\nBut heâs also sees his judicial role as\n\ndirectly affecting people.\n\nâI learned first-hand what Chief Judge Kaye\n\ntaught me 20 years ago: Courts are the emergency room of society. Thatâs true whether a\n\ncase presents a family dispute, a business dispute, a medical malpractice claim, an issue of constitutional rights, or seeks to hold power accountable. Courts\n\nare like first responders: We need them to be fair, speedy,\n\nexpert, efficient and kind. Our societal health, and our\n\ndemocracy, hang in the balance.â\n\nHeâs proud of the work he did in helping create New\n\nYorkâs first special foreclosure court.\n\nâIn 2018, Rockland County had a severe foreclosure crisis,â he said. âIt had one of the highest rates of\n\nresidential foreclosure in the state. I was sent to lend\n\na hand. I came to understand that when cases are\n\ndelayed it doesnât help anybody â it doesnât help the\n\nfamily because the debts rack up; it doesnât help the\n\ncommunities because sometimes you end up with zombie properties that can diminish safety and property\n\nvalues; and it doesnât help the banks.\n\nâEvery foreclosure is something else in disguise. Itâs a\n\ndeath, a divorce, a job loss, or an illness. Whenever somebody was in foreclosure, the odds are pretty good something bad was happening in the family, and that weighs\n\nheavily on all of us.â\n\nHe said his aspiration as a judge is to âuse the law to\n\nserve the lawâs genuine objective, which is to do justice, allocate rights, impose responsibilities, and hold\n\npower accountable. Sometimes the path to justice\n\nflows through decisions. Sometimes the path to justice\n\nflows through talking with people about their concerns\n\nâ hearing them deeply â with a clear sense of whatâs\n\nreally going on. It helps to bring the skills of a listener\n\nand problem-solver to those cases.â\n\nAnd as for his pulpit, he said that the restrictions on\n\nhis preaching imposed by his judicial role proved to be\n\na blessing.\n\nâRather than focus on outside matters, the judicial ethics rules focus me pastorally on inside matters â matters\n\nof the heart, community resilience, ethics, and compassion â tender places that need our focus now especially,â\n\nhe said. âHow can we make meaning and find resilience\n\nin a world that needs all we can give?â\n\nPerhaps even better: The ethics rules freed him from\n\nfundraising, another judicial no-no. âIt makes me perhaps the only pulpit rabbi who can never talk about the\n\nproverbial building fund,â he said.\n\nRabbi David Markus\n\nP:23\n\nLocal\n\nJS-23\n\nJEWISH STANDARD APRIL 1, 2022 23\n\nSignature SELECTÂ®\n\nSeltzer Water 1 ltr. btl.\n\nKosher for Passover\n\nPlus deposit where required\n\nYehuda\n\nFarfel, Matzo\n\nor Cake Meal\n\n9-16 oz. pkg.\n\nKedem Concord\n\nGrape Juice\n\n64 fl. oz. btl.\n\nLIMIT 2\n\nYehuda Candles\n\nMemorial\n\nTumbler 1 ct.\n\nAFTER MFR.\n\nREBATE ON BTL.\n\n**Coupon must be downloaded\n\nto your ACME for U account prior to purchase and is one time use\n\nonly.

So has a complementary adage, âBetter safe than sorry.â Weâve\n\nheard those messages in many variations on\n\ntelevision and in the news for a long time, and we\n\nremember them.\n\nFor good reason. Theyâre important.\n\nThose sayings are crucial to remember and to integrate into our lives at all times.\n\nWeâve all heard stories about scammers and the\n\nuptick of crime. We have to protect ourselves, and one\n\nmeans of protections is using our wits, our common\n\nsense, and our instincts.\n\nI thought of those two sayings just the other day.\n\nAfter shopping at the mall, I got into my car, which\n\nwas parked farther away than usual. It had been busy\n\nwhen I pulled into the mall, but it was much quieter\n\nwhen I returned to my car, and it had begun to rain.\n\nAs I was getting settled and about to start the car\n\nto leave, a van pulled up alongside me.\n\nThere were two men inside the van, and\n\none was trying to get my attention. He\n\nmotioned toward the passenger door, as if\n\nthere were something wrong with the car.\n\nThe only way for me to check the door\n\nwas to get out of the car, and that wouldâve\n\nput me very close to the menâs van.\n\nFor a few seconds, I watched as they\n\nkept motioning to my door. As I tried to\n\nfigure out what they were trying to tell me\n\nthrough the car window, I grew curious. I\n\nwas tempted to get out to examine that side of the car.\n\nSo many thoughts flashed in a matter of seconds.\n\nWhat are they trying to tell me?\n\nDo I have a flat, or is there some major damage to\n\nmy car?\n\nTheyâre smiling at me, maybe theyâre a little\n\ntoo friendly?\n\nIf I get out, Iâll be really close to their van.\n\nBut then my heart started beating faster.\n\nSomething felt very off.\n\nMy instincts kicked in and spoke to me in a loud voice.\n\nâStop looking in that direction, turn on the ignition,\n\nand get the heck out of here. NOW,â my\n\ninstincts shouted to me.\n\nI drove out of there toward a parking\n\nlot that was closer to the stores, and to\n\nother people. The van didnât follow me.\n\nNow that I felt safe, I got out and\n\ninspected my car. There was no damage\n\nat all. Then I drove straight home.\n\nWhen I shared this weird experience\n\nwith some friends, a few wanted to tell\n\ntheir own stories. I learned that these\n\nencounters are not so unusual.\n\nA few days later, I had the opportunity to speak with\n\nBergen County Sheriff Anthony Cureton about my incident and to learn some general safety tips.\n\nSheriff Cureton began by saying, âI believe in the\n\nsixth-sense theory. When something doesnât feel right,\n\ngo with your instincts.\n\nâStay in your car if there is any doubt at all. Lock\n\nyour doors and try to get a license plate number. If\n\nsomeone is following your car, drive to a police station, or flash your lights when you see a police car on\n\nthe road.\n\nEsther Kook\n\nSEE INSTINCTS PAGE 51\n\nEsther Kook of Teaneck is a reading specialist\n\nand a writer.\n\nP:24\n\nAround the Community\n\nJS-24\n\n24 JEWISH STANDARD APRIL 1, 2022\n\nSaturday\n\nAPRIL 2\n\nTanakh and\n\nsuperstitious: Rabbi\n\nHayyim Angel gives an\n\nin-person, pre-Mincha\n\nshiur, âTanakh and\n\nSuperstition: Debates\n\nWithin Traditional\n\nCommentary,â for\n\nRinat Yisrael in\n\nTeaneck. 5:45 p.m.\n\nRinat.org.\n\nSunday\n\nAPRIL 3\n\nRabbi Hilly Haber\n\nRev.
