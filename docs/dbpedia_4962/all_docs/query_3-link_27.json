Hence there's a lot of content here.)\n\nDancing is fundamental in life.\n\nSince people have walked, people have danced.\n\nHuman beings are born to dance - we have dancing in our genes, which means you do too.\n\nDancing improves quality of our lives, and the health of societies.\n\nAncient civilisations knew about the amazing powers of dance and dancing, and increasingly the modern world is re-discovering how important dance is for living happily and healthily and long, and how dancing can transform people in so many ways\n\nBesides being great fun, dance delivers benefits that will amaze you. This extends to people you might teach or train or entertain or manage - or the children and the young people that you parent or care for.\n\nFor many thousands of years, across all cultures, nations and peoples, dancing has been vital to human life.\n\nDancing is in our genes. The urge to dance - and to watch others dance - is deeply rooted in all of us.\n\nDance is immensely significant in our health, wellbeing and overall happiness.\n\nDancing enriches us, and enriches our communities.\n\nDancing is truly global and its benefits and joys are infinite.\n\nDance is far more beneficial and potent than we might imagine - as a way of living a happy good life, and helping others to be happy and healthy too.\n\nWhile experienced passionate brilliant dancers and dance teachers recognise and understand the wonderful powers that dancing gives people - of all ages - many people have yet to realise what dancing can do and enable.\n\nDance promotes incredible benefits, and brings dramatic improvements, in motivation, and personal development too.\n\nDancing offers fabulous ways to motivate people towards brilliant achievements.\n\nDancing also diffuses stress, and fosters wellbeing - really like nothing else can - in individuals and groups, and bigger communities and societies.\n\nDancing is deeply embedded within us all.\n\nIf the origins of humankind first appeared in Africa, then dancing first happened in Africa too, and this was at least 150,000 years ago.\n\nIf instead the emergence of humankind is considered to be at least six million years ago, when humans separated from apes.. then we have been dancing for six million years.\n\nFor those who believe that humankind was created with the world itself, then this is 14 billion years ago, and we have been dancing for 14 billion years.\n\nFrom most perspectives, Africa usually represents the oldest origins of dance - dancing for joy, for work, for play, for pleasure, for rain, for mating, for child-rearing, for ceremony and ritual, for a happy body - dancing for whatever was meaningful.\n\nDance is as old as people's existence on Earth, and arguably before - like we see many animal species 'dancing' - bobbing, swaying, nodding, jumping, soaring, moving and shaping, in response to the rhythms of nature - the wind in the trees - the ebb of the tide - the fall of the rain.\n\nAnd in modern times - after millions of years of dancing - we are still dancing..\n\nWe are dancing our most basic human ways, and in our most innovative modern ways.\n\nWe are dancing traditional dances and modern dances and folk dances and street dances.\n\nOur dancing is increasingly and excitingly fused into countless different dance styles, reflecting the fabulous rhythmic diversity and creativity of people and cultures on our planet.\n\nVariations of dancing styles grow ever more astoundingly, particularly accelerated now by the globalized digitally and socially-connected video-sharing age.. and by young people more empowered, inspired, educated and confident than any previous generation.\n\nDance styles are borrowed, blended, invented, and combined from every imaginable dance type - in amazing ways - From Jazz and Jive, Bollywood and Bhangra, Samba and Zumba®, Waltzing and Quickstepping, Disco and Dancehall, to Ballet and Tap, Flamenco and Folk, Breakdance and Swing, Belly and Burlesque, Hip-hop and Street..\n\nWherever there is humanity, there will be dance and dancers dancing.\n\nMain Index\n\nIntroduction to dance and dancing\n\nAbout this article and how to use it\n\nOrigins of dance - dancing in human history\n\nDefinitions of dance - word origins, language\n\nBenefits of dance - physical, mental, workplace, society\n\nWho can dance?..

About this dance article and how to use it\n\nThis is a big article about dance, so here's an explanation of its aims and how to use it..\n\nThis article intends to cover every main aspect of the subject of dance and dancing.\n\nFirstly - please understand that this article is a basic easy introduction to dancing and its history, theory, terminology, etc - this is not a highly technical or complex explanation of dancing and how to dance.\n\nThe article aims to be accessible and easy to understand, especially for young people.\n\nIt is written in a relaxed non-technical way, so that people who are not experts in dance - or dance language - can understand it quickly and enjoyably.\n\nThat said, while the article is not academically complex, it certainly aims to be academically useful and reliable, as a basic introduction and guide to the subject of dance, for example for people beginning to study dance , or considering careers in dancing , or who might want to start a dance business of some sort.\n\nThis article also aims to be a useful and reliable reference resource for people researching dance - or different types of dances, or what dancing can do for people.\n\nAnother main aim of this article is to explain the considerable and varied things that dancing can enable , that are seemingly quite unrelated to dance, but which dancing can influence and improve enormously in one way or another.\n\nFor example, how dance can improve people's health and happiness - in life, and at work too - and extending this point, how dance is a wonderful activity to use in work and group situations as a means of motivating people, of building relationships, and for improving wellbeing and fitness and mental attitude.\n\nThis article also seeks to explain how dancing can transform the lives and feelings of young people .\n\nThis article also offers lots of definitions and descriptions for dances and dancing , and a glossary of dancing terminology - so that the reader gains a solid platform for understanding the subject of dance, on which further studies, research, work, and skills can be planned and built.\n\nThis article aims to offer a fabulous free introduction to the subject of dance, enabling further development or use of dance for every imaginable direction and purpose.\n\nThe main index above will help you see in detail what this article covers .\n\n4. Origins of dance - dancing in human history\n\nSince humans first began living together in small tribes over 100,000 years ago, and probably millions of years before this, people have enjoyed dancing and used dance in a variety of ways.\n\nOur ancient ancestors began to dance as part of play and social interaction, and then later in worshipping their gods, and also as an important rite of passage to various life stages . Dance has for thousands of years been a part of growing up and entering new life stages - from children to teenagers, to adults, to parenthood, to being wise elders.\n\nSince people have lived in groups, dance has been used in rituals and celebrations and festivals of all sorts:\n\nfor growing and harvesting,\n\neating and drinking,\n\nfarming and livestock,\n\nfishing,\n\nrelationships and bondings,\n\nbirths and sickness and death,\n\nplagues and pestilence,\n\nthe weather - the sunshine, the rain, the snow, the drought, the flood, the wind and storms,\n\nthe elements - the fire, water, earth, the air,\n\nthe heat and the cold\n\nthe sky and stars,\n\nnature - the trees and hills, rivers and seas, mountains and streams, birds and bees, every animal on the earth, every plant every herb every shrub\n\nhuman conflict and wars\n\nfamilies and tribes and nations,\n\ncultures and creeds,\n\nreligion and rule, revolution and independence...\n\nand thank goodness peace and cooperation and love and harmony too.\n\nIt is difficult to suggest a single aspect of human existence and experience that is not connected to dancing. Everything that exists is at some time or place touched, celebrated, asked for, feared and defended, or otherwise the subject of a dance.\n\nThese dances might be performed by a single person for a few seconds, or these dances might be performed by millions of people for thousands of years.\n\nAnd these dances might be private, or unseen, or might be watched by millions, or billions. And everything in between these extremes.\n\nThroughout the development of human history, dance has developed too, in parallel, reflecting humanity and civilisation, in terms of:\n\nculture,\n\nvariety,\n\nstyles,\n\nstructure and established patterns,\n\nrules and laws\n\nand learning and teaching and transfer through writing and media.\n\nThe earliest dancing, like the earliest singing, music and cooking, was instinctive, intuitive, experimental, and taught personally by demonstration and observation, shown person to person, tribe to tribe, and passed down from generation to generation - thousands or millions of years before books and writing. This type of dancing, after evolving to varying degrees, persists as folk dancing, as it is commonly technically called.\n\nFor tens of thousands of years, dance in this most basic form was accompanied by people's voices, and the most rudimentary of musical and percussive instruments, Later, when humans had evolved more and could make better tools, about 100,000 years ago, dance became more commonly accompanied by percussion - basically wooden things (hollow logs, blocks, etc) that people would strike with smaller wooden things (sticks essentially). Various shakers made from seeds and husks and shells, or sand/seeds in shells etc., would also have been used in prehistoric times around the world.\n\nIncidentally the drum (with skin membrane stretched over a wooden shell) was invented in Chinese Neolithic culture around 5500BC (over 7,500 years ago). Shakers in natural forms (certain dried seeds in husks/outer coverings) such as the rainstick, and dried seaweeds, animal bones and teeth, or other naturally occurring shakable percussive objects, certainly existed before the membrane drum, and were used as part of ceremonial activities along with smoke and fire and water, etc., at the most basic times of human (homo sapiens) evolution. We know this from ancient archeological evidence, and more particularly from studying 'lost' tribes (especially in recent South America), whose cultures have not been touched or altered for many thousands of years.\n\nAnd this happened for hundreds of thousands of years relatively unchanged, until humankind developed the capability to write and draw on paper - to record and transfer knowledge - and to make more sophisticated musical instruments and music.\n\nAnd so around 500 years ago, like most other human activities, dance interpretation and performance (in celebrations and ceremonies, and socially and as audience entertainment) exploded into far greater complexity and variety - because people were able to build new ideas on previous dance concepts/movements, and share expertise and creativity. As part of this growth and development, in both cause and result, dancing became more formalised and structured - with descriptions, and types and styles, and standards and rules, and all sorts of variations that could be recorded, and shared and taught and learned by everyone.\n\nThis stage of dance development coincided with the beginnings of the modern age and globalization, which dramatically influenced the evolution of dance. Humankind began to travel and communicate like never before. Social and political structures became more organized around the world, and ideas and customs were shared and spread and blended, which is reflected in the development of dancing.\n\nThe age of the European colonial powers (mainly 14th-19th centuries) increasingly exported European rule and people and ideas into Africa, Asia and the Americas, and also moved ideas and people from these regions back into Europe and elsewhere, especially from Africa to the Americas, through the appalling slave trade, and use of slavery particularly in the Americas and Caribbean. North America especially became a vast laboratory for the importing and blending of dances.\n\nAll over the world, early tribal and folk dances were preserved and clung to by people who were oppressed, relocated or disenfranchised. This is particularly significant in South and North America, where slaves, stripped of everything, and randomly mixed together from different tribal origins, having no common languages, used percussion and song and dance as a way to bond, relate, and maintain and reform communities and social groups. Slave owners typically banned drums and other attempts to create music. Slaves were largely treated far worse than animals. Think about it.. Through generations, millions of African people were forced to work and live in the most desperate living conditions imaginable, having only their voices for singing, and their bodies for dancing, and it is from these roots that much 'Western' and 'Latin' dancing grew, becoming absorbed and adopted into new national cultures and identities as slavery declined and ceased, and the new countries of the Americas were formed. And all the time, these developments were imported back to Europe, often adapted, and then spread further, including back to where they'd been first found.\n\nThis is a very broad overview of the Africa-Americas dance history that can be regarded as an example of a major aspect of dance history internationally. Similar evolution of dance, alongside massive social and demographic movements, has always happened in other parts of the world. Dance is a mirror of civilizations and societies, whether in the Americas, or the Far East, or the Russian Empire, or the Arab world, or India or Australasia. Dance grows and spreads and blends with the changing world, especially when people are forced to live in very basic ways.\n\nAcross the globe, dance has been a central feature of human behaviour and culture for all religions, creeds, societies and ethnic groups.\n\nWe know from records, stories and rituals as well as from modern day observations of tribal rituals that dance - alongside music, singing, cooking and eating - has played a pivotal role in group bonding and identity.\n\nWe dance to teach - children especially - but also young people so they learn about relationships and love and mating and socialising.\n\nWe dance to tell stories, and dancing is in all sorts of storytelling.\n\nDancing is in customs all over the world, and dancing helps groups and communities stay and work together - to communicate, to bond and to feel part of the whole.\n\nWe dance for our worship and our churches and or Gods and our beliefs.\n\nWe dance to play, to rejoice, to entertain and be entertained.\n\nWe dance because it is part of our human make-up. Dancing is as much a part of being human as eating and drinking, as walking, seeing, singing, smiling, loving, and laughing.\n\nIf we do not dance, then we do not fully live.\n\nHowever the significance of dance and dancing is not widely and fully appreciated. Millions of people simply do not dance - just as millions of people do not eat fresh fruit or vegetables, or walk, or smile, or love or truly seek to be happy.\n\nSo part of the purpose of this article is to encourage, enable, and facilitate more people to dance, and to use our minds and bodies more naturally, as they are made to be used.\n\nThis article's purpose is also to encourage people to teach children to dance - especially those who will benefit most from doing so - just as we want people and especially our children to live more happily and healthily.\n\nSo please take what you can from this article - vast sections of content - of just a simple single sentence or phrase or maxim - and dance for yourself a little more joy and wellbeing - or a lot - or help in some way in teaching others about dance and encourage others to dance - and bring a little more dance into our world - or a lot if you are so inspired - because doing so will surely make this world a better place.\n\nMain Index\n\nIntroduction to dance and dancing\n\nAbout this article and how to use it\n\nOrigins of dance - dancing in human history\n\nDefinitions of dance - word origins, language\n\nBenefits of dance - physical, mental, workplace, society\n\nWho can dance?..

Definitions of dance - dance word origins, history... what is dance?\n\nIn the conventional sense, the word 'dance' basically means moving one's body , in some sort of rhythmical way, usually to the accompaniment of music.\n\nHowever, the degree to which 'the accompaniment of music' and 'rhythmical' must feature in any definition of dance is matter of interpretation and opinion (especially in terms of technical language, and/or in terms of dance context).\n\nStrictly speaking (no pun intended - the word 'Strictly' has become synonymous with dance due to the TV series 'Strictly Come Dancing') dance does not necessarily require music , and plenty of formal definitions do not require that music be part of any activity which legitimately can be called 'dance'. The matter of 'rhythm' or 'rhythmical' being an essential aspect of dance is also debatable, since plenty of legitimate actual forms of dance do not entail moving to a rhythm as such, especially when we consider conventional definitions of 'rhythm', which generally include the movement criteria of regular, repeated, systematic, measured, and sequential.\n\nIf we apply 'rhythm' and/or 'to the accompaniment of music' absolutely to the definition of dance, then a completely improvised 'dance' (that is irregular, non-repeatable, unmeasured, unsystematic, and non-sequential) to the sound of ocean waves, or the wind through the trees, or to complete silence, would not qualify to be called a 'dance', when by all reasonable appreciation it most certainly would be regarded as dance.\n\nSo we must be careful not to define 'dance' too rigidly, or we begin to exclude many activities that correctly should be called dance.\n\nNow as regards more formal definitions and language, the word 'dance' is extraordinary for a number of reasons.\n\nFirstly the word 'dance' is both a noun and a verb :\n\nA dance is a thing - a noun . And dance is an action - a verb (a 'doing word').\n\nAlso the word 'dance' alone does not need the word 'a' in front of it, in which case it's a rather bigger sort of noun - like 'life' has a big meaning of 'life' (e.g., 'life on earth') as well as meaning your life or my life or a person's life.\n\nSo 'dance' is a noun meaning a single dance 'a movement to rhythm', and it's also a noun meaning the concept or entire subject of dance.\n\nLet's look first at 'dance' as a noun..\n\nDefinitions of the noun 'dance':\n\nThese dictionary definitions are offered here with the warning, explained above, that we should not define 'dance' too rigidly, and especially we should be flexible in the notion that dance be rhythmic and accompanied by music..\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary main definition of dance, the noun, is: “Dance (noun) - A series of steps and movements that match the speed and rhythm of a piece of music...”\n\nInterestingly the definition from the 1922 OED is more flexible than the above modern definition, because it does not say that music is essential: \"Dance (noun) - A rhythmical skipping and stepping, with regular turnings and movements of the limbs and body, usually to the accompaniment of music...\"\n\nWebsters Dictionary (an important USA dictionary) defines dance as: \"Dance - To move the body and feet rhythmically, especially to music...\"\n\nDefinitions of the verb 'dance':\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary definition of dance, the verb, is: \"Dance (verb) - Move rhythmically to music, typically following a set sequence of steps...\"\n\nThe 1922 OED definition of dance, the verb, is: \"Dance\" (verb) - To leap, skip, hop, or glide, with measured steps and rhythmical movement of the body, usually to a musical accompaniment...\"\n\nSamuel Johnson's 1755 English dictionary - the first dictionary of common English - says that dance (verb) means: \"... To move in measure; to move with steps correspondent to the sound of instruments..\"\n\nThesaurus words for dance, dancing, dancer\n\nA thesaurus is a dictionary-type of book that offers synonyms - words of equivalent meanings - and similar and related alternatives to words - rather than strict definitions.\n\nThe equivalent/similar/related words offered by a thesaurus aid the appreciation of the meaning and range of the word dance, and its associated forms, such as dancing and dancer.\n\nHere are some of the main alternatives and variations that a thesaurus offers for the word 'dance' and 'dancing' (from the 1982 thesaurus published by Penguin, UK).\n\nThesaurus alternatives for 'dance' and dancing (noun):\n\nball, masquerade, 'the dansant', tea dance, ceilidh (Irish pronounced 'kay-lee'), square dance, hoe-down' hop, jam session, disco, ballet, old time dance, folk dancing; country dance, Scottish dance, sequence dancing, ballroom dancing, Terpsichore, war dance, sword dance, corroboree, shuffle, soft-shoe, cake-walk, pas seul, clog dance, step dance, tap dance, fan dance, toe dance, dance of the seven veils, hula-hula, high kicks, cancan, belly dance, gipsy dance, flamenco, morris dance, barn dance, hay, hornpipe, keel row, polonaise, mazurka, fling, Highland fling, reel, Strathspey, Gay Gordons, strip the willow, Dashing White Sergeant, tarantella, bolero, fandango, cotillion, galliard, ecossaise, gavotte, quadrille, minuet, pavane, saraband, schottische, polka, waltz, valeta, lancers, foxtrot, quickstep, Charleston, black bottom, two-step, pasa-doble, tango. rumba, samba, mambo, bossa nova, habanero, beguine, conga, cha-cha, hokey-cokey, Palais Glide, stomp, shimmy, jive, rock'n'roll, twist, Paul Jones, snowball, corps de ballet, jitterbug, choreography, modern dance, solo, pas de deux, chasse, glissade, arabesque, fouette, plie, pirouette, rotation, entrechat, jete...\n\nThose are just the main synonyms and words which might equate to a dance and dancing, and mainly from a British angle. There are hundreds more synonyms and alternative possible words meaning dance and dancing, especially when we consider more recent or informal or international words, that might not be included in official dictionaries and thesaurus books yet..\n\nA similarly long list of alternatives would be shown by a thesaurus for the word 'dancer'.\n\nBesides illustrating the depth and variety of words that exist for the concept of dance, a thesaurus perspective also demonstrates the vast cultural implications of dance, which is a different matter compared to the strict definitions of dance offered by a standard dictionary.\n\nOther interesting points about the word dance...\n\nA word that is both a noun - (especially where it is a single limited individual thing, and also an entire concept) - and a verb can be powerful, and this this is certainly the case with 'dance'.\n\nSome profound fundamental words do not have these qualities - for example 'food', 'life', 'song', 'birth', and 'death', all of which have rather different verb forms.\n\nDance is in a special group of words - which are both noun and verb, and fundamental to human existence - for example 'love', 'drink', 'talk', 'walk', and 'rain'.\n\nMoreover there are few words - in the same form - that refer to an entire universal concept ('dance' as a concept), and to a single example within the concept ('a dance'), and to a verb ('to dance').\n\nDance refers to the entire universal concept of dancing (big noun)\n\nA dance can be a single event or action (small noun)\n\nAnd dance is the verb to dance (verb).\n\nSo besides its more complex meanings and interpretations, the word dance is grammatically quite unusual.\n\nA definition of dance/dancing according to its characteristics..\n\nWhen a big concept can mean different things it is difficult to define it in a short sentence.\n\nFor example, a 'hatpin' is easy to define in a short sentence. There is absolutely no doubt what a hatpin is from the short definition, i.e., \"Hatpin (noun) - a long pin with a large ornamental head, that holds a woman's hat in position by securing it to her hair.\"\n\nIf we try to define bigger concepts such as love or life or death or air - or dance - in a short sentence then we can confuse and complicate matters, either by offering a definition that is too vague, or by trying to cover all possible interpretations, in which case the definition becomes a big description containing mostly unhelpful information for a given single perspective.\n\nSo another helpful way to define a big concept like dance is to offer the main defining characteristics - some of all of which might apply to any particular example.\n\nHere is a list of characterizing or qualifying characteristics for 'dance'. This can be regarded as another way to help to define dance. This is not an official list, it is created for this webpage by the author. You can devise your own characteristics if you wish, or adapt this. Remember some or all of these might apply, in order for something to be considered a form of 'dance' or 'dancing':\n\nMovement of the body - typically rhythmic and coordinated or in some way following a pattern or method.\n\nUsually, but not necessarily, music accompanies dancing.\n\nDance is a way of communicating and expressing ideas and emotions, as well as a way of exercising and enjoying life.\n\nDance is non-verbal, physical and empowering - it attracts interest and attention, and is an extension of human moods.\n\nFor many people, the urge to dance is an irresistible impulse, that starts at birth and lasts throughout life. Many people start instinctively foot tapping and moving to certain music.\n\nDance is infectious and communal - it is a natural social lubricant, bond, and relationship builder. Throughout human existence dance has been a main method by which men and women meet and discover each other, test compatibility, and date and mate.\n\nDance is also an art form. Dance performance combines the skills of amateur or professional dancers, ballerinas and choreographers, etc., to produce entertainment that can be intensely expressive, so that dance delights and thrills people, some of whom might not actually enjoy or feel confident in dancing themselves.\n\nOrigins of the word dance..\n\nOrigins of words offer information as to their meanings and history.\n\nChambers Etymological Dictionary (of word origins) suggests that dance came into English from French about 1300, firstly as dauncer, from Old French dancier, and before this either from Frankish dintjan (like Middle Dutch deinsen, and densen, to shrink back), or from Vulgar Latin deanteare, from Late Latin deante, meaning 'in front of', from de and ante.\n\nCassells etymological dictionary is certain that dance came into English from Old French dancer, to dance, 12-14thC, and which also became the modern French word 'danser' meaning to dance, and that these words came from Frankish dintjan, which is of uncertain origin.\n\nCassells also explains that the Old English word for dance is sealtian, from/related to Latin saltare, dance, in turn from salire, to leap, and which is the same Latin root as that of the saltarello, a Spanish/Italian dance for one couple, characterized by leaps and skips.\n\nSamuel Johnson's 1755 English dictionary - the first English dictionary for common words - says that dance is from French, danser, and dancar, Spanish, and thought by some to derive from tanza, in the 'Arabick' language (meaning Arabic).\n\nInterestingly the origins of the word dance via Latin through French became confused because there was a religious ban on dancing in the Middle Ages, which affected the evolution of the word. Significant in 'dance word history' is that dance was such a powerful concept that religious authorities in France decided to ban dancing altogether. English culture and language is substantially influenced by French (about 50% of English language is basically from French), mainly due to the Norman Conquest invasion (1066) and subsequent French governance, and widescale occupation and conversion of English society and national identity. The word dance is heavily influenced by this aspect of Anglo-French history. We 'dance' because the French (notably the Norman French) invaded and colonized England. Had the Romans or Vikings been similarly colonial, and left more of their culture after invading England, then our word for dance might be 'danza' (Italian) or similar, or 'danzleikr' (old Norse) or similar. Or if the Normans had not invaded, then given the prevalence of Germanic words in English, conceivably 'dance' would today instead be closer to the German dance noun/verb 'tanz' and 'tenzen'.\n\nWithin this brief overview of dance etymology and its main European equivalents, we also see similarities in the words for dance in the different languages, suggesting a very old word from a very old root, way back in time when European language was first developing from 'Indo-European' and similar ancient languages, prior to western civilisation itself, in the prehistoric times of hunter-gatherers. This was before the need to have words beyond the most basic in life - before paper and books and pencils and writing. This would be in the days when people's language vocabularies were spoken only, and included just essential words like food and drink, and run and sleep and sun and sky... and dance.\n\nThe word 'dance' in other languages...\n\nThis is delightful and interesting.\n\nThis is not a full list of all the international words for dance.\n\nIf you want to add one, please tell me .\n\nThis is the noun 'dance'..\n\nAlbanian - valle\n\nBasque - dantza\n\nBosnian - ples\n\nCatalan - dansa\n\nCroatian - ples\n\nCzech - tanec\n\nDanish - dans\n\nDutch - dans\n\nEsperanto - danco\n\nEstonian - tants\n\nFinnish - tanssi\n\nFrench - danse\n\nGalician - danza\n\nGerman - tanz\n\nGreek - χορός\n\nHungarian - tánc\n\nIcelandic - dans\n\nIrish - rince\n\nItalian - danza\n\nLatin - choro\n\nLatvian - deja\n\nLithuanian - šokis\n\nMaltese - żfin\n\nNorwegian - dans\n\nPolish - taniec\n\nPortuguese - dança\n\nRomanian - dans\n\nRussian - танец\n\nSerbian - плес\n\nSlovak - tanec\n\nSlovenian - ples\n\nSpanish - baile\n\nSwedish - dans\n\nUkrainian - танець\n\nWelsh - dawns\n\nThe use of dance and dancer and dancing in historical language, slang, expressions, etc..\n\nThe words dance, dancing, and dancer feature strongly in English sayings, slang and colloquial (informal common) language.\n\nThese expressions and descriptions of dance imagery are part of the cultural history of dance - and life - and illustrate the richly textured relationships between people and societies, with dance and dancing. The varied ways that dance/dancing features in metaphors and common expressions emphasise that dance/dancing has been a deeply symbolic concept for hundreds of years in the English language, and therefore life.\n\nDance/dancing metaphors and expressions and slang feature widely in other national languages and cultures, so these English language examples below are just a tiny fraction of the extent of dance imagery, in language and communications to convey feelings and ideas, all over the world.\n\nEric Partridge's famous Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English first published in 1937 offers several fascinating uses of the word dance. These examples are interesting because they reflect society and language of the 1800s and early 1900s:\n\nlead (someone) a dance - to cause someone excessive worry or effort\n\ndance a haka - to exhibit joy - from and referring to the New Zealand Maori haka ceremonial dance\n\n\"(She/you/I will) dance at your funeral..\" - a personal jibe or piece of banter or insult\n\ndance barefoot - referring to a woman whose younger sister marries before her\n\ndance in the half-pick - (Yorkshire England) reference to a man 'left behind as a bachelor, on a brother's marriage'\n\ndance the reel of o'Stumple (or reel of bogie) - sexual intercourse\n\ndance to a person's whistle or pipe - unquestioningly obey someone\n\ndance the stairs - (quickly) burgle an office or flat\n\ndancer - a cat burglar\n\n'fake a dance' - meant to improvise a forgotten step\n\ndancers - stairs - incidentally Captain Francis Groce's 1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (English slang) provides an earlier reference than Partridge (1937) for 'dancers' being slang for stairs.\n\ndancing - locomotive wheels slipping on the tracks\n\ndancing on the carpet - summoned to the superintendent's office for reprimand (this expression is nowadays shortened to 'on the carpet' - meaning receiving a reprimand at work)\n\n'dance' was a slang reference being hanged - a shortening of various longer terms including: dance upon nothing (in a hempen cravat); dance the Tyburn jig (Tyburn was the famous London prison); and dance the Paddington frisk (Paddington refers to Tyburn) - all meaning to be hanged - and also - dancer and dancing master referred to a hangman.\n\nBrewer's 1870 dictionary of Phrase and Fable says of dance: \"Dance. The Spanish danza was a grave and courtly dance. Those of the seventeenth century were called the Turdion, Pabasna, Madama Orleans, Piedelgiba'o, El Rey Don Alonzo, and El Caballer'o. Most of the names were taken from the ballad-music to which they were danced. The light dances were called Bayle...\"\n\nBrewer continues, and offers a list of the 'National Dances', which gives us a perspective of national dances as perceived in 1800s England:\n\nBohemian (Romany gypsy) - the Redo'wa\n\nEnglish - the Hornpipe and the Lancers\n\nFrench - the Contredanse (country dance), Cotillan, and Quadrille\n\nGerman - the Gallopade and Waltz\n\nIrish - the Jig\n\nNeapolitan - the Taran'tella\n\nPolish - the Mazurka and Krakovieck\n\nRussian - the Cossac\n\nScotch - the Reel\n\nSpanish - the Bole'ro and Fandango\n\nBrewer significantly also offers a list of 'Religious Dances', for example:\n\nAstronomical dances - invented by the Egyptians, designed (like our orreries [an orrery is a clockwork model of the Solar System]) to represent the movements of the heavenly bodies.\n\nThe Bacchic dances - of three sorts - grave (like our minuet), gay (like our gavotte), and mixed (like our minuet and gavotte combined).\n\nThe Dance Champetre - invented by Pan, quick and lively. The dancers (in the open air) wore wreaths of oak and garlands of flowers.\n\nChildren's dances - in Lacedemonia, in honour of Diana, the children were nude, and their movements were grave and modest and graceful.\n\nCorybantic dances - in honour of Bacchus, accompanied with timbrels, fifes, flutes, and a tumultuous noise produced by the clashing of swords and spears against brazen bucklers (small round shields).\n\nMilitary dances - the oldest of all dances, executed with swords, javelins, and bucklers (small round shields). Said to be invented by Minerva (Roman goddess of wisdom, knowledge, crafts and war) to celebrate the victory of the Gods over the Titans. (Brewer refers to Minerva the Roman goddess and implies Roman mythology, when nowadays we refer more to the Titans and Gods war - the Titanomachy - being represented in Greek mythology - whether Roman or Greek, the reference is to the beginning of time, when the Titans were an earlier group of godlike characters, defeated and replaced by the Greek Gods of Olympus, i.e.,, Zeus, etc. It is in this context that Brewer asserts military dances being the oldest form of dance.)\n\nNote that Brewer asserted in 1870 that the oldest of all dances are military dances, and he basically positions this assertion with Roman mythology about the beginning of time. This is not a modern scientifically robust argument.\n\nSayings and expressions including dance/dancing references:\n\n'Dancing on the head of a pin' - a criticism of someone's argument tactics on the basis that the tactics are concerned with tiny incidental or irrelevant matters and the main issue is not being addressed - (this is an abbreviation of a fuller expression originally used in theological or religious argument, 'You are arguing about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin/the point of a needle')\n\n'Bring on the dancing girls' - a reference to introducing thrilling elements or entertainments for an audience or gathering.\n\n'Dance the night away' - a reference to dancing enjoyably into the night and probably early morning too.\n\n'Dance and the whole world dances with you' - said frequently in praise or celebration or advocation of dancing as a beneficial socially connecting activity.\n\n'Takes the cake' and 'piece of cake', and takes 'the biscuit' - especially USA - alludes to competitive dances for enslaved/poor black people in which the prize was a cake (hence also cake-walk)\n\n'Lead (someone) a merry dance' - refers to someone being caused great nuisance or wasted time by another person or organization, in providing obstacles or complexity in the way of a particular task or aim\n\n'(It was a proper/right) song and dance' - alluding to an unnecessarily convoluted or complex process or experience in resolving a problem or achieving an aim.\n\n'Make a song and dance (of/about something)' - (this differs from the above 'it was a song and dance') - this alludes to someone creating or introducing or using unnecessary fuss or complexity or resistance in planning or doing a relatively simple task.\n\n'Dance attendance on (someone)' - act in a servile inferior way towards someone.\n\n'Have a ball' - have a grand and enjoyable time - alluding to holding or attending a ball dance.\n\n'Out of step' - failing to maintain cooperation or synchronization or harmony in a partnering or joint project or relationship.\n\n'All-singing, all-dancing' - reference to a piece of equipment or specification which contains virtually every imaginable functionality or gadgetry, including many functions that are not required.\n\nQuotes about dance and dancing..\n\nThere are thousands of sayings and quotes about dance and dancing.\n\nMany appear in books and songs and poetry and other literary works.\n\nMany others are part of our social history and have no known origins - they just exist, and are used, because dance and dancing is so fundamental to life.\n\nHere are a few of the most popular sayings and expressions about dance and dancing, and some other rarer quotes.\n\nQuotations are helpful for people studying dance, especially from a sociological and literary or dramatic standpoint, and also they help us appreciate the countless dimensions of dance and dancing, and how dance can mean so many different things to different people, depending on culture, mood, season, and the purpose of dance, etc.\n\n\"Dance and the whole world dances with you..\" (Anonymous)\n\n\"Let's face the music and dance..\" (Irving Berlin)\n\n\"We get it on most every night.. when that moon is big and bright.

Benefits of Dance\n\nThere is a lot of content here about the benefits of dance and dancing... This is because there are so many extraordinary, deep, exciting, and wide-ranging benefits from dance... and also I like to offer a big choice of materials for trainers and teachers (for your own learning materials).\n\nEveryone can benefit from dancing - actually regardless or how well people can actually dance (of which more later) - and increasingly adaptable, inclusive, and accessible in different ways to people with physical or mental disability.\n\nDance offers benefits of one sort or another to every person living, and also to every community, and group, and organization.\n\nWhy is this true?\n\nWhat makes dance so empowering and beneficial?\n\nConsider first that people dance for different reasons, and these reasons naturally point to the benefits that arise from dance, and that are available to everyone.\n\nSo this list of reasons for people enjoying dancing gives several good examples of the main benefits and positive outcomes of dancing.\n\nReasons people enjoy dancing...\n\nTo express emotion. Whether happy or sad, relaxed or anxious - people dance to express emotions.\n\nAs a physical release. We can dance for fun and to feel good, and to reduce stresses in life.\n\nTo improve your mental health. Dancing can certainly help reduce mental health problems - exercise is proven to be beneficial for mental health, and dancing offers much more than exercise, depending on the type of dance.\n\nAs part of rituals. In most cultures today, probably all cultures, people still perform dance as part of a specific ceremony or activity, religious or otherwise, like the traditional first dance at a wedding.\n\nFor social and romantic experiences - people dance to make friends, build relationships, and perhaps to find a partner for dating or mating or for life - and generally people dance with other people to share the enjoyment of positive physical and sensual activity.\n\nTo develop and reinforce a common 'code' and mutual understanding among particular social or ethnic groupings - humans have evolved this instinct since prehistoric times - it was especially prevalent among dispossessed uprooted 18th-19th century African slaves, through to the modern day dances of street gangs, high-school students.\n\nFor team-building and group relationships - to share experiences, learning, aims, and enjoy a sense of community. Dance is an excellent way to break down barriers between people, boost collaboration and harness team dynamics to foster a better and more productive working environment.\n\nAs exercise. Dancing is now proven to be one of the best ways to exercise - dancing burns calories, tones muscles, and keeps bones strong. The many different types of dancing offer different forms and intensities of exercise - there are variations to suit everyone.\n\nAs a profession. Dancers, choreographers, ballerinas, teachers… many people earn their living performing, teaching and managing dance.\n\nFor entertainment - as a spectacle and experience for an audience - all sorts of dancing in all sorts of venues - ballet, street-dance, theatrical shows, burlesque, modern dance, artistic dance.\n\nThe benefits of dancing from a more scientific and factual viewpoint are given below in sections:\n\nPhysical benefits of dance\n\nMental benefits of dance\n\nStress-reduction (physical and mental) benefits of dance\n\nWorkplace and motivational benefits of dance\n\nCommunity/society/cultural benefits of dance\n\nPhysical benefits of dancing\n\nDancing is increasingly understood and proven to produce extraordinary physical benefits.\n\nMuch of this understanding is from recently developed technologies and science, that are enabling new sophisticated physiological analysis of how the human body reacts to dance. This in turn has encouraged and enabled new research and study initiatives into the science of dance and exercise and wellbeing, etc., especially in universities, all around the world.\n\nAt a basic level, dancing improves physical condition in two main ways, and this has been known for a century or more:\n\nDancing exercises your entire body (including connective tissue, nerves, brain, etc) which tones your muscles, and stimulates and sharpening your senses.\n\nDancing increases the amount of oxygen that you take into your body - developing your cardiovascular system (heart, lungs breathing, etc) - because muscles and brain are being exercised and so demand more oxygen.\n\nMore modern research has now extended this understanding to the following broader and more detailed benefits.\n\nDancing tends to:\n\nImprove the condition of your heart and lungs.\n\nIncrease muscular strength, endurance and motor fitness.\n\nIncrease aerobic fitness.\n\nImprove muscle tone and strength throughout your body from your neck to your feet.\n\nHelp with weight management.\n\nImprove brain functioning, particularly cognitive function - Learning a dance routine helps increase memory and general brain function.\n\nDancing definitely aids - inevitably and unavoidably - the development muscle memory, which is the unconscious capability of the nervous system and muscles to 'remember' and reproduce patterns of movements. Music greatly assists this process, which is a feature of unconscious competence . Muscle memory - and the ease by which you can convert conscious movements into unconscious competence - is hugely useful for all sorts of physical activities beyond dancing.\n\nDancing can help you to ‘reshape’ your brain so that, for example, you don’t get dizzy spinning. (For example, ballet dancers tend to have slightly different structures in their brain which stop them from feeling dizzy when they pirouette.)\n\nEnable stronger bones and reduce the risk of osteoporosis.\n\nImprove coordination, flexibility and agility, because dancing improves the communication between your brain and your body.\n\nImprove balance, posture and spatial awareness.\n\nDancing suppresses signals from the balance organs in the inner ear linked to the brain, so it can help improve general back problems and reduce accidents.\n\nImprove sleep and counter insomnia.\n\nDancing tends to make you look younger and more vibrant, and helps delay effects of ageing.\n\nA major physical benefit from dancing is that it gives you a 'molecular massage': Dancing shakes, vibrates and resonates your core, promoting detoxification at a 'sub-atomic' level.\n\nLearning and practising steps can help dancers benefit from ‘superfluidity’ - which enables a dancer to glide across the dance floor seemingly effortlessly.\n\nMental and emotional benefits of dance\n\nBesides the range of physical benefits that dancing brings, dancing also brings powerful mental and psychological benefits.\n\nThis includes improvements to:\n\nMental health generally.\n\nMotivation.\n\nHappiness and positive outlook.\n\nPersonal relationships.\n\nSelf-esteem and self-image.\n\nAssertiveness and confidence.\n\nStress, anxiety and depression.\n\nBereavement and grief recovery.\n\nCoping with life-changes and emotional trauma.\n\nAgeing healthily and avoiding isolation and withdrawal.\n\nHere's how and why dancing can help these psychological issues and aspects of mind, mood, and attitude..\n\nDancing helps you feel good about yourself: The human body craves movement, because it is designed for movement and activity, but modern life mostly makes it easier for us to sit or be inactive. Dancing satisfies our natural need to move our bodies, so that the mind and body are stimulated in the many ways described here and above, especially producing helpful hormones, and diffusing unhelpful ones such as cortisol, the stress hormone.\n\nDancing tends to help people feel more positive and optimistic about life. Learning to dance, and dancing itself, helps expand your imagination and appreciation of the world, because dance involves and connects to so many aspects of international culture and life as a whole.\n\nAs with any exercise, dancing releases endorphins, one of our body’s natural 'feel-good' chemicals.\n\nSpecifically dancing counteracts and diffuses stress virtually immediately - try it - it is physiologically impossible to maintain a level of stress while dancing. If you are very stressed you might remain stressed to a degree, but your stress level will reduce, and the more you dance, then the greater the stress reduction.\n\nYou feel more alert - more alive - as more oxygen reaches your brain.\n\nYou feel energised - because you are energised. Dancing energises you. It's that simple.\n\nYour mental capacity and functioning are boosted as you dance - this is proven repeatedly by all modern research and advanced ways to measure mind/body.\n\nYou feel more confident, with a greater general feeling of wellbeing - again modern research consistently confirms this.\n\nYour self-esteem tends to improve with dancing in social situations - and this also improves your social and communication skills, and how you feel about relationships, other people, and your self-image. Dancing socially and sharing the experience of dancing with others helps to validate and affirm you as a happy fulfilled loved person. This is supported by a vast amount of modern research which shows that enjoyable social engagement is a crucial aspect of good mental health.\n\nVery significantly, dancing with other people removes barriers and insecurities - it is a leveller and remover of status/authority or inferiority or superiority - especially work-related rank - because it is a different environment and range of activities, that are very different to normal habitual relationships, and it so makes people feel and behave more equally and respectfully to each other. Where people have dancing expertise, the experts help the learners, and these learners in other situations might be the bosses, or the judges or the people in the big houses. And the experts might in other situations be the subordinates - but dance changes all this, because dancing is a different world. Dance is a leveller, and a new social order, where everyone can feel comfortable.\n\nDance can also help you cope with life’s more negative emotions and events. Dancing can help you come to terms with rejection, grieving and loss, and help you move on.\n\nYou can also experience feelings of euphoria and liberation, when you are completely immersed in the movement and music.\n\nFor those people for whom dancing is significant, or for whom dancing has appealed but been untried or inaccessible, starting to dance can ignites a major passion. Bringing a passion to life like this - whether for the first time, perhaps one you never thought existed, or rediscovering a buried past love of dance - is powerful and actually changes people's lives - because it changes the way people feel about themselves and their place in the world.\n\nAs with other enablers of emotional wellbeing, positivity, etc., dancing tends to motivate people to explore additional ways of improving your health and wellbeing. This is because you become more aware of your body, and you naturally then become more interested and drawn to other ways of improving how you live and feel, and how you take care of your mind and body and spiritual wellbeing.\n\nTypically when people start dancing, especially on a regular basis, they become attracted and often explore ways to improve aspects of life such as and via:\n\ndiet - how we buy food, prepare it and cook it\n\nwhat we drink - we might reduce alcohol intake\n\nour approach to fitness and exercise - we might take the stairs more often, or cycle, or walk, rather than drive\n\nwe might start meditation or practice yoga\n\nwe might explore mindfulness and trying to live more 'in the moment'\n\nwe might consider a change of career or a bigger life change\n\nwe make new friends and this enables new relationships and shared social activities and interests - and all of this is amazingly good for emotional wellbeing and mental health - and living long and well\n\nand we might share some of these ideas with family and friends, children, parents\n\nand we might share some of these ideas at work or in other groups where we can inspire or lead others\n\nSo in terms of mental and psychological health, and in many other ways, dancing encourages people to widen their view of living more healthily and happily, and trying new beneficial experiences.\n\nDancing opens doors in the mind, and windows to the world, through which we can see and explore lots of life-improving things.\n\nDancing can help manage stress and anxiety.\n\nGiven the challenges of modern life, and the shocking degree to which mental problems can affect anyone - from simple mild stress to far more serious or even life-threatening emotional difficulties, it is appropriate to comment further and more specifically about how dancing can alleviate or resolve problems of stress and anxiety or worse.\n\nAs a therapeutic device, dance has been shown to be a powerful tool in the treatment of severe and chronic mental health conditions from depression to bipolar disorder, from eating disorders to obsessive compulsive disorder.\n\nDance is frequently proven in studies and personal stories to help manage stresses of all sorts.\n\nDancing can do this because of the variety of positive effects it produces in the mind and body, and in terms of stress or emotional difficulty this might be because:\n\nDancing unlocks or releases suppressed feelings which can hurt us or stop us recovering if the feelings are 'bottled up' or denied.\n\nDancing aids the processing of toxins in the body, which under stress become blocked. There is long-standing and widely held opinion that distress in the mind is directly related to bodily ailments. Massage, reflexology, reiki , and yoga are examples of healing our minds by touching or moving or using our bodies. Dancing is another way to move the body and thereby heal or care for our mind.\n\nWe do not necessarily need to understand how and why this relationship exists, or how doing things with our body actually results in improvements for our mind, for these processes to work. They just do, and so we can consider using these connections.\n\nBenefits of dancing for workplaces and organizations - for motivation and wellbeing, etc\n\nThe benefits of dance for workplace situations - notably for the motivation and development of groups and teams - naturally extend from the benefits already discussed.\n\nThe main outcomes of dancing that impact positively on workplaces are:\n\nSocial interaction, relationships, and team-building.\n\nRemoving barriers between people and teams - by virtue of rank/seniority, department, geography, culture, age, race, and other differentiating aspects of groups and organizations.\n\nIndividual and collective mood improvement - helping increase people's happiness.\n\nIndividual and group health and fitness - mind, body and soul.\n\nThe process of learning a specific dance routine is both an artistic endeavour as it is a memory exercise. It therefore involves mental and physical discipline: structure, agility, strength and flexibility, particularly when we dance with others.\n\nWhen we dance with others there are substantial relevant benefits for the workplace, in terms of:\n\nTeam-building and relationships.\n\nEquality, and actually helping people relate to each other as equals and fellow humans.\n\nConflict diffusion.\n\nCommunications.\n\nMutual respect and awareness (see the JoHari Window mutual awareness theory ).\n\nDancing helps develop attention and concentration. It can boost ability to multi-task because dancing is more than just moving. When you dance you have to move of course, but you also have to be in control of your balance and posture, be aware of who or what’s around you (even if to avoid collisions), respond to the beat and rhythm of the music, respond to the lyrics, and follow the steps, or create your own interpretation.\n\nFor example, learning a dance routine requires that you:\n\nPut your foot in the right place\n\nAt the right time\n\nWith your arms in the right place\n\nAt the right time\n\nAnd your head in the right place\n\nAt the right time\n\nDance is a fusion of movement, music, space, communication and awareness.\n\nDancing improves physical and mental health and wellbeing, which in turn boosts personal and team productivity.\n\nWhen people feel good, and feel better about themselves, people generally work better too.\n\nDancing is different from typical work tasks - Dancing tends to be very absorbing, requiring a level of movement and concentration and control that shifts our minds away from our normal 'stuck' or habitual thinking patterns and opinions and stresses.\n\nDancing - because it is radically different from normal 'work' - can open new possibilities for problem-solving, creativity, decision-making, and action. All of these things are crucial for effective working.\n\nN. B. Emergent Knowledge offers interesting ideas and explanation as to how changing our position and what we are doing, changes so dramatically how we think and feel , and consequently how we then behave and perform and relate to others and the world.\n\nWhen we dance our motivation increases, because as already explained, our bodies produce positive 'feel-good' energising chemicals when we start to exercise. Dancing produces lots of these chemicals, and generates particularly strong emotional feelings. Motivation is vital for being productive and cooperative in work situations, and also for improving our job and career prospects.\n\nSee the materials about motivation for more information and ideas about what motivates people and why it's helpful to do so.\n\nDancing makes us more alert, more creative, and more driven to succeed, or to overcome challenges.\n\nDancing makes us healthier and fitter, which helps performance, and reduces absenteeism.\n\nDancing also enables better awareness and understanding of non-verbal communication: ' body language ' - our own and other people's body language - all of those hand gestures, facial expressions and body movements - that make up so much of what we say and communicate.\n\nBy dancing, people can discover skills they never realized they had, that can open new and unexplored career pathways.\n\nPeople who dance are also more likely to be open to new possibilities (because they feel happier, safer and less vulnerable) and so are more likely to find new opportunities - directly by meeting new people and embracing new skills that dancing regularly brings, or by approaching external situations with a more open mind and greater confidence.\n\nGroup dancing is an excellent teambuilding activity. Learning a dance routine as a team helps build team relationships as the group works towards a common goal. Dance help people get to know each other in a fun and non-threatening manner, and so helps remove professional barriers between team members that often get in the way of cooperation.\n\nIf a work group dances, then their collective creativity, motivation and work ethic all tends to improve.\n\nRelationships and trust improve as people dance together. People dance tend to work harder, better, and smarter.\n\nDance is a tool for social change..\n\nDance has been an aid and driver of social change for thousands of years - and especially the past 500 years.\n\nIn more recent times - assisted by social networking platforms on the web - dance is increasingly recognised and used more proactively and directly to advocate and achieve social changes on a relatively bigger quicker scale.\n\nTwo notable examples, whose efforts to prompt highly positive social change have reached audiences of millions of people, are Matt Harding ('Where the heck is Matt'), and Peter Sharp (founder of The Liberators organization). Matt Harding and Peter Sharp have each innovated some wonderfully powerful ideas, using dance, with flash-mobs and street activities, leveraged by social networking - and achieved vast followings, to promote improvements in societal attitudes.\n\nWe can expect this sort of use of dance to grow, because it is irresistible to millions of people seeking inspiration and purpose, and this is further evidence of the extraordinary power of dance to generate good positive outcomes for people and our wider world.\n\nThe benefits of dancing In summary..\n\nDance offers amazing benefits for human wellbeing - physical and emotional, extending to reducing serious stress and psychological pressures.\n\nDancing, especially as part of a group, is highly motivational. It brings people together to share experiences, and builds friendships, bonds, and is often the beginning of marriages and families.\n\nDancing in various ways improves virtually every aspect human existence, for individuals and groups.\n\nIn an age of incredible technology and gadgetry, online social networking, fast-food, fast pressurised lifestyles, fashion, celebrity culture, materialism and artificial constructs, dancing offers some of the simplest easiest ways to feel good - that money simply cannot buy.\n\nMain Index\n\nIntroduction to dance and dancing\n\nAbout this article and how to use it\n\nOrigins of dance - dancing in human history\n\nDefinitions of dance - word origins, language\n\nBenefits of dance - physical, mental, workplace, society\n\nWho can dance?..

Who can dance? Everyone can dance...\n\nPut simply, Everyone can dance. Really, anyone can dance.\n\nRegardless of shape, size, age, race or religion, ability and disability, anyone can experience and delight in dance, and enjoy its benefits.\n\nThis is because dancing takes so many forms - there is a type of dance for everyone - and because each of us has dancing inside us.\n\nIf you doubt this, take a few minutes to read about Multiple Intelligences Theory - you can even do a free self-test to indicate your own 'multiple intelligence profile' - and the degree to which music and body movement feature in your own personality. We all possess musical and body movement capabilities - some more than others - but it's basically impossible for a human being to exist who has none. Besides this many people are drawn to dance for its artistic and spatial and social/interpersonal qualities, and these are also separate multiple intelligence aspects that every person tends to possess to a lesser of greater degree.\n\nDance at its simplest is self-expression - so ability is irrelevant. Self-expression is utterly separate from, and and not dependent on skill.\n\nIf you have natural talent and passion for dance, learning to dance might be easier.\n\nAlso some dance styles are easier to enjoy and perform when learning begins at a young age (ballet, for example).\n\nNevertheless people can dance, and learn to dance better, at all ages.\n\nMoreover, certain types of dancing are much easier to learn when older.\n\nThe variations of dance also make dancing accessible to people of all physical conditions - and mental conditions.\n\nDisability is not an obstacle to dancing.\n\nSo ability and age and physical ability are not relevant. And we have already discussed the substantial benefits that can be derived from dancing by people with all sorts of mental challenges and conditions.\n\nWe know that human beings have been dancing for millennia.\n\nWe are genetically ‘hard-wired’ to move in rhythm and we are programmed to respond when other people dance. The global TV phenomena of Strictly Come Dancing and Dancing With The Stars are clear proof of the universal appeal of dance - competing alongside the most popular sports and dramatic entertainment - for what people choose to follow on TV and other media.\n\nNevertheless, there is a wide belief that only a few people can really dance, and that many people can’t dance at all.\n\nYet dancing is in all of us to varying degrees. When we are young we naturally move to music as soon as we hear it. We tap our feet and nod our heads spontaneously, automatically, intuitively, instinctively.\n\nWe dance at events, discos, functions and weddings, in front of the mirror, with friends, with our children and grandchildren, drunk or sober, in groups of tens of thousands (at festivals and sports grounds), and alone when no-one is looking.\n\nWe can all dance, but, of course, many of us do not.\n\nMany of use choose not to dance; convincing ourselves that we are not good enough or we will embarrass ourselves. or we might think we are not a ‘dancer’.\n\nJust as everyone can boil a kettle and make a sandwich, and plant a seed, and hum a tune, so each of us can dance if we choose to.\n\nDancing is for everyone, and everyone can dance.\n\nDancing and disability\n\nIt is important to note that dance is accessible in various forms to people of different disabilities - temporary or permanent.\n\nWheelchair dancing or Wheelchair DanceSport, which is well established in over 40 countries, and as an international competitive form of dance, is a wonderful example of the increasing adaptability and accessibility of dance for people who are not as physically able as the majority of dancers.\n\nThere are also types of dance for people who have visual impairment, and other forms of sensory disability.\n\nDance is increasingly used as a social, therapeutic, healing, and fitness activity for people suffering from mental challenges of one sort or another.\n\nDancing is also a hugely helpful activity for people who suffer from illness and disease of some sort, whether temporary, or permanent, or even terminal.\n\nSpecialist dance classes and groups exist now, and continue to grow, all around the world, for people of all ages who are impaired or challenged in some way.\n\nResearch is discovering more and more ways that dance can help treat, soothe, heal or comfort people who are battling physical or mental adversity.\n\nTeaching and learning dance for dancers who have a disability of some sort logically requires specialist knowledge and methods, but the basic principles of teaching and learning are the same as for able-bodied dancers - particularly the concept that the needs of the dancers must be understood before learning/teaching commences .\n\nIn this respect dancing for people with disabilities is much like dancing for everyone else:\n\nTeachers must be suitably qualified, and must understand the form of dance they plan to teach.\n\nThe dancers needs and capabilities must be assessed, so that teaching can be planned and explained.\n\nTeachers and dancers should have a mutually agreed view of what the aims are - the purpose, the standards and measures, and opportunity for students to influence and control their rate and intensity of development, so that people remain happy and committed, and stresses and confusions avoided.\n\nEquipment, clothing, and venue considerations must be satisfied properly, so that everyone is safe, and that people have what they need to dance.\n\nDancers' learning and development must be monitored, and students given careful sensitive feedback and coaching, with suitable reference to proven learning and teaching methods.\n\nAppropriate notes of theory and instruction must be provided by teachers to students, so that dancers have a printed (or other media) reference to aid their development, besides the practical learning that happens in the class/studio situation.\n\nTeachers must ensure that learning happens according to an appropriate mix of fun, enjoyment, social engagement, physical exercise/development/therapy, variety of dance experience, measurement/assessment/qualification, and perhaps competition too if wanted, and certainly lots of acknowledgement and recognition of progress and achievement.\n\nDancing for disabled people, and people howsoever challenged or impaired physically or mentally, is an aspect of dancing that offers unlimited potential for good - for societies and communities everywhere. Much of this potential has yet to be identified, and new ideas and methods are emerging all the time.\n\nIf you have an interest in this area of dance please follow your passion, because so much good can be achieved.\n\nThe benefits of dance, for people who are physically or mentally disadvantaged, are powerful medicine indeed.\n\nSo as you read more of this article - remember that with a little adaptation and imagination - dance really is for everyone.\n\nMain Index\n\nIntroduction to dance and dancing\n\nAbout this article and how to use it\n\nOrigins of dance - dancing in human history\n\nDefinitions of dance - word origins, language\n\nBenefits of dance - physical, mental, workplace, society\n\nWho can dance?..

How to learn to dance. How to teach dance. Tips and principles.\n\nAnyone can learn to dance, whether you teach yourself, or join a dance class.\n\nIf you join a dance class, having a good teacher is important too.\n\nYou perhaps already understand how you prefer to learn new things.\n\nIf not, here are some helpful references:\n\nTips about how we learn, and how best to teach others..\n\nThese principles apply to all sorts of learning - and certainly to learning and teaching dance.\n\nAs mentioned at the introduction to this article, people learn in different ways.\n\nThis is a simple concept, and extremely worthwhile considering and applying.\n\nBy understanding these different ways or styles of learning/teaching, and the natural preferences of the learners - and our own preferences - we can design or follow learning that best suits our needs.\n\nPeople prefer to learn in different ways - there are various ways to understand this and our own preferred learning styles - see VAK theory , Multiple Intelligence Theory , and Kolb's Learning Styles\n\nWe learn all things in stages (no pun intended), not all at once - the Conscious Competence Model is a super easy concept for appreciating the stages of learning\n\nMeasuring the effectiveness of learning and teaching is crucial for its success - see especially Kirkpatrick's Learning Evaluation Model , and for deeper detail/assessments see the Learning Evaluation Process and Tools\n\nExperiential Learning - this concept offers some useful ideas for teaching dance\n\nFrom a teaching standpoint it is important to understand our own natural preferences and strengths too (including Multiple Intelligence profiling ), so that we know how best to adjust our own natural style/preferences/strengths to fit the needs of learners. For example, if a teacher has a strong preference for physical involvement and demonstration (kinesthetic and experiential), and is teaching a student who has strong visual and reading preferences for learning, then the teacher must adapt the teaching style accordingly. Conversely if we try to teach a kinesthetic learner using only verbal instructions and written notes, then the learner will struggle. Many learners will naturally prefer a learning style that is the natural preference or way of the teacher, and to a great extent dance requires and implies that much of the learning will be kinesthetic (experience, or doing it, rather than seeing/reading/listening to instructions); nevertheless the teacher must always ensure that teaching style/method is matched sufficiently well with the learner's preferences . It cannot be a perfect match all the time, and in group class situations, where there is usually a mix of preferences, it is impossible to please everyone at all times - moreover it is generally good for learners to experience all styles of learning, because that's good for growth too - so it's a matter of optimizing learning style as far as reasonably possible, rather than teaching/learning 'blind' and in total ignorance of the importance of learning styles and preferences.\n\nIn summary, whether we are teaching ourselves, or teaching others, it is helpful to:\n\nUnderstand the learner's preferred learning styles, so that..\n\nAs far as possible we design/orientate/access methods of learning/teaching that match the learner's natural strengths and preferences, so that..\n\nWe optimise the learner's absorption and understanding and use of the new knowledge and skills.\n\nAn additional way to see this is that we must guide the learner (even if the learner is ourself) through the stages of learning (see Conscious Competence theory ) in ways that as far as possible match the learning style preferences of the learner.\n\nTips about learning how to dance..\n\nThe first step (excuse the pun) is deciding what kind of dance style you want to learn.\n\nThen decide whether to teach yourself or join a local dance class. Or a mixture of the two.\n\nTips for self-learners\n\nIf you want to learn to dance without going to a dance school or classes, then first decide which dance style is for you.\n\nThere are many dance styles - from ballet to belly dancing, from tap to salsa.\n\nEach style is different.\n\nTap dancing’s fast beats are different to the sharper movements of hip-hop.\n\nSome dance styles ideally or absolutely require a partner or group; other dance styles are more solitary.\n\nTo discover what you like, watch videos of the different dances online, and see what moves you most.\n\nLook at the basics of each style to see what suits and does not suit you.\n\nMaybe you like the way your hips would move in salsa. Perhaps you like the staccato and percussion of tap.\n\nMaybe you like the social organized flow of line-dancing. Perhaps you would be thrilled by the sparkle and elegance of ballroom.\n\nMaybe you seek the work-out and high energy of Zumba® (note that Zumba® is a trademarked protected style with licensed teachers and class leaders). Perhaps you prefer the challenge and edginess of burlesque.\n\nSelecting a dance genre to pursue is partly a matter of the dance itself (its physicality), and partly a matter of the style and dress and situations within which the dance happens.\n\nThe music might be specifically defined by the dance style, as in Latin ballroom, or Lindy Hop or Swing.\n\nOr the music might be much less specifically defined or implied by the dance style, as with modern line-dancing, which is choreographed nowadays popularly to many types of music besides its origins in traditional US/Nashville country music.\n\nExplore dance magazines, dancing websites and videos, and dance books. Look for ways to understand the basics of each dance style, so you have a good idea of what to expect, and can learn about any specialist equipment you might need, for example different types of dance shoes.\n\nWatch professional dancers and dance shows and other dance entertainment for inspiration - seek to discover styles of dance that are new to you, because these could hold more even more appeal for you than dance styles that are already familiar to you.\n\nMany dance schools/classes offer free 'taster' classes that enable you to experience different dance styles to help you decide which you enjoy most.\n\nWhen you decide which style of dance to learn, the process for teaching yourself to dance is basically as follows:\n\nFind or make a space to practice - minimum about five feet square - ideally with a flat solid non-carpeted floor, and where you can make some noise without disturbing others.\n\nOrganize a music-playing system that's easy to operate and reach, and which produces a good sound quality so you can hear and 'feel' the music properly (again be mindful of neighbours and use a volume level that's acceptable for your situation).\n\nChoose some music that fits your chosen dance style.\n\nLearn to hear the beats - when you listen to a piece of music, hear/feel the beats, and tap your foot in time. This is also called the rhythm.\n\nStart by moving just your arms then add in leg and foot movements - really listen to the beat and allow and be aware of the 'feel' of your body, so that it moves in time with the beats (timing) of the music.\n\nTake your time - know that there are limitations and stages of learning. You will become a good or perhaps great dancer over the course of time, not immediately or overnight or in a few weeks. So give yourself time. Expect to learn gradually and enjoyably. Enjoy the time it takes and the journey of learning, rather than wishing to be an expert before you are ready. It takes time to learn to dance.\n\nPractise little and often - generally when learning anything new - especially involving mind-body coordination - it is much better to practise 'little and often' rather than lots all at once. If you try to practise for too long, especially early on when it is all new to you, your brain will become tired after as little as 5 minutes. To practise intensively for more than 10 minutes is not easy for experienced people. The brain has a natural limit of operating at high performance.\n\nAvoid risks of strains and overloading yourself by building up practice duration and intensity gradually and gently. Also build up your fitness gradually. You will be using muscles and tendons and ligaments that probably have never been stressed, and it is easy in early stages of new exercise to tear muscles and connective tissues.\n\nFocus on the basics and practice them until you are proficient at them, before moving on to more complex movements.\n\nRespond to the more subtle rhythmic 'feel' the music - after you have confidence in basic timing (beat), your body additionally might begin to feel and express more of the musical rhythm (the accent or emphasis of different beats and half-beats, etc) - for example rock and reggae might be the same beat, but the emphasis of the beats vary (these differences can be heard in all music to varying degrees) - so that your body reacts more fully to the mood and emphasis of the rhythm, in addition to the basic timing and beat.\n\nUse the pattern/shape/feeling of the music - all music has emotional variation and structural shape - and this provides additional cues/inspiration for your movements - for example in some dance styles and accompanying music the dance movements can be changed along with the different parts of the music, for example choruses, and stops, quieter sections and crescendos, etc. This is not applicable to all dance styles, and is not relevant to certain dance types; also much of this is a matter of personal preference anyway, so great freedom exists in pursuing these ideas or not.\n\nConsider joining a dance school or classes - when and if you feel that you would improve better or quicker with outside coaching, join a dance school or classes. While it's possible to develop considerable expertise via self-learning, you might find that your progress and competence - and awareness and scope - increase markedly when you expose yourself to help and guidance of good teachers and other like-minded learners.\n\nWhen/if you decide to go to dance class or school, it's important to select the level best suited to your ability.\n\nIf you’ve never danced before naturally go to beginner classes.\n\nIf you have some experience in your chosen dance style, then a more advanced class might suit you.\n\nTalk to the class provider or dance teacher to establish which level, or class, is best for you.\n\nHow to choose a dance class or dance school ..\n\nIn choosing a dance class and teacher, consider your lifestyle and budget, and your aims, for example:\n\nWhat day(s) of the week is best for you?\n\nWhat time of day is best for you - afternoons, weekends, evenings?\n\nHow long you want the class to be - 30 minutes, 1 hour, longer?…\n\nHow long the course lasts - 8 weeks, 2 months, 3 months. Can you commit to that length of time?\n\nIs it a drop-in class or much more structured? A drop-in class can be convenient but you might find that progress is slow and patchy. A class or school that offers qualifications to a set curriculum will enable more structure and discipline, and probably faster progress, but this is not something that everyone can commit to.\n\nDoes the teaching allow/encourage a progression so that you can move to a more advanced class as you improve?\n\nIs the size of the class suitable for you? Are you more comfortable in a small or large class?\n\nHow qualified and experienced is the teacher? Read his/her biography online. Anyone can set up a dance school or dance class but not everyone who does this is a good teacher. A good teacher understands people and the teaching/learning process, and understands how to lead a group enjoyably - a good teacher takes care of people (this is especially important for young people) and is able to support people's needs and concerns, fears and hopes, etc., in addition to knowing and being expert in the subject itself.\n\nAre you attracted to the social/cultural characteristics of the other people in the class - will you enjoy being with the other learners, assuming group aspects are important to you - (this does not mean the other students must all be exactly like you in age and outlook, etc - it means will you enjoy being a part of the group?)\n\nWhere are the classes held? Are the facilities comfortable and good for what you want - the room/dance hall, floor, other facilities, etc? If you want a strong social dimension, is there a strong social dimension?\n\nIf you want to perform in front of an audience, does the dance school offer the opportunity to do this?\n\nIf you want to gain qualifications and gradings, does the dance school offer this, and is the school properly accredited with a good reputation?\n\nIf you want to become a dance teacher, does the dance school offer this training and qualification, and perhaps also opportunity to teach?\n\nCan you get to the venue easily and reliably?\n\nDo you need any specialist equipment? If so what, and how much does it cost?\n\nHow much do the classes cost? Can you afford them?\n\nWhen you choose the perfect dance teacher and dance school or class for you, and continue learning to dance, again take your time - expect for improvements to come in stages when you ar ready, not immediately and overnight. Ask for lots of advice and feedback from your teacher. Teachers generally love to help students who are enthusiastic, positive, and love the subject, and ask lots of questions. Definitely ensure you ask for help with any problems that you encounter.\n\nTo progress faster, practise in your own time what you learn at school - at home and at dance clubs and other venues.\n\nLearning a new skill is a mixture of absorbing knowledge, being inspired by mentors and teachers and other great students, learning the skills and techniques, and then importantly practising the skills and techniques .\n\nThe more you practise, the more brilliant you will become.\n\nTips for dance teachers\n\nIf you are an experienced dancer, then you might be attracted to teaching other people to dance.\n\nYou might want to become a dance teacher even before you can dance brilliantly yourself.\n\nYou might want to teach dance more than become a great dancer yourself.. This is perfectly ok too.\n\nTeaching is a skill in itself.\n\nNot all teachers have to be brilliant at actually doing what they teach. It's helpful to be good at what you teach, but it's not essential to be brilliant.\n\nThis is rather like the fact that some of the greatest football coaches were not actually great footballers.\n\nTeaching is a special capability, quite different to dancing.\n\nOf course you will need a good level of dancing ability and good dance knowledge to be a dance teacher, but to be a great dance teacher you do not necessarily need to be a great dancer.\n\nConversely there are plenty of great dancers - or specialists/artists in other disciplines - who do not make good teachers.\n\nBeing a dance teacher can be approached as a hobby, or part-time job, or as a full-time career.\n\nIf you are interested in teaching people to dance, then you will need to consider the following:\n\nWhat dance style(s) are you going to teach?\n\nWhat level of dance ability are you going to teach?\n\nDo you want to teach beginners? Experienced dancers? People seeking to be qualified in dance? People wanting to be dance teachers? All of these?\n\nWho are you going to teach? And particularly what age?\n\nTeaching young children is in many ways different to teaching teenagers, which is different to adults, which is different to teaching elderly people..\n\nSome things in dance teaching apply to all ages; other things do not. There are things about teaching little children that do not apply to any other age group. And the same applies to teenagers. And the same applies to adults and especially older people.\n\nWhere are you going to teach? Would you prefer to teach locally or are you happy to travel further?\n\nWhen are you going to teach? What days of the week? What hours of the day?\n\nHow long will your classes be? Will they be in a drop-in style, so that people attend when they can do, or something more structured and progressive where each class moves students onwards?\n\nAre there enough people to fill your class? If you want to teach a popular, well-known style like tap dance or ballet then it may be easier to fill a class than say flamenco or belly dance.\n\nDo you want to work for somebody, or work for yourself? Or a mixture of the two?\n\nIf you want to start your own dance classes or school, how will you recruit students?\n\nWhat sort of venue/hall/studio do you imagine using - what availability and continuity and hire cost do you seek?\n\nWhat will you need to charge each student per class? How many students will you need to cover your costs, and earn enough money as your wage, and to reinvest in your development costs?\n\nOr do you prefer to join an established respected company to teach dance - as a freelancer or employee, so that you can benefit from proven systems, structure, processes, support, etc.\n\nDo you have the necessary qualifications and experience to teach dance to the level you want to, and if not do you know reliably how best to become suitably qualified and experienced?\n\nSetting up your own dance class or dance school - starting your own business\n\nHere are some guidelines for setting up your own dance class or dance school venture. This is effectively setting up a small business, even though it might begin with just a single hour-long lesson, once a week. It's still a little business, and you must follow some simple rules:\n\nYou will be self-employed, so you must notify your tax authority. In the UK this is HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs)\n\nYou must obtain necessary insurances - for public liability especially, and ideally specialised insurance for self-employed dance teachers running their own dance classes or dance school. This is not complicated or particularly expensive, but it is extremely important. If one of your students slips and injures themselves at your class then you are personally liable, and so you need to be insured.\n\nYou must consider and decide what to call your dance business - even if it is simply \"(Your name) Dance Classes\", or \"(Your name) Dance School\".\n\nIf you want to use a brand-name that you think of yourself, then you must check that this is free/available to be used. You can do this by checking if there is already a dance business of that name on the web. Additionally you should check existing registered tradenames, which typically are listed and searchable online on a national authority for trademarks. In the UK this is part of the Central Government website.\n\nIf you plan to build a sizeable business with a website and potential international reach, then you should seek some professional advice about trademarks and registrations. In any event, you should ideally check that you can buy the website domain name for your chosen business name, because these days a website presence is helpful and important.\n\nAsk for help from people about setting up a business. There are many things that you need to do that are not actually about dancing and dance teaching, but they are important for your success. These things are not especially difficult, but for many artistic and creative people, they are strange and sometimes do not seem natural or enjoyable - and so can be time-consuming and difficult to get right - they can even be quite (and unnecessarily) worrying. There are many people who can help you with these things - for example, find a good accountant or bookkeeper to do your accounts and tax returns. This will save you lots of time and money compared to trying to do it all yourself unless you are expert in such things.\n\nThere is a lot of help and advice on this website too for setting up a business, and for when your business is established and you wish to grow it bigger, for example marketing and planning . Also leadership and negotiating .\n\nIf you are establishing your own class or dance school, here are some of the things you must consider:\n\nEstablish and publicise the purposes and aims of your dance class or school.\n\nEnsure you have the knowledge and experience and qualifications for the teaching that you plan.\n\nWhat will each lesson include? How much time will be allocated to recapping and practising what you learnt in the previous lesson? How much time will you allocate for teaching new dance moves and skills?\n\nHow flexible will you need to be? How will your plan change if you find out that your students can’t learn as quickly as you thought they would?\n\nHow will you deal with a student that misses a class and falls behind?\n\nHow will you deal with a student that distracts others or is disruptive?\n\nIt is helpful in considering these questions and others if you write a code of practice , which you can give to your customers/students/parents (of younger students). A code of practice clarifies what you will do for your customers, and what you expect in return. It can be a tremendously important document, especially for a new business. It's important if you have staff too, or helpers. By having a code of practice you demonstrate professionalism and good command of your subject, and business, "
