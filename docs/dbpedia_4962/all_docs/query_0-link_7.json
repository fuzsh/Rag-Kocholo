        "text": "Big Stars, Ukrainian Bios\n\nWith the world having been fixated on the Russian invasion of Ukraine since it began Feb. 24, 2022, a lot of people have thought about this European country of over 43 million people. Plenty of celebrities, politicians, authors, and other notable figures are from Ukraine or have ties to the embattled nation. Some of them have even focused their efforts on giving back during the conflict, including actress Mila Kunis, who has raised millions for Ukrainians with husband Ashton Kutcher. Here are several notable folks who can trace some of their roots back to Ukraine.\n\nMila Kunis\n\nThe star of \"That '70s Show\" was born in Chernivtsi, Ukraine, and lived there until she was 7. The actress told the Los Angeles Times in a 2008 interview, \"It was right at the fall [of the Soviet Union]. It was very communist, and my parents wanted my brother and me to have a future, and so they just dropped everything. They came with $250.” Kunis and her husband, actor Ashton Kutcher, have raised over $34 million for temporary housing and humanitarian aid for Ukrainians and encouraged more than 65,000 additional donations.\n\nLeonard Nimoy\n\nWe might always associate Leonard Nimoy with Vulcan blood, but he was born to two Jewish immigrants from Iziaslav, in what is now known as Ukraine. His story of growing up the son of immigrants also became a children's book.\n\nFollow us on MSN for more of the content you love.\n\nBob Dylan\n\nFolk singer Bob Dylan might be the most famous singer with Ukrainian roots. Both his grandfather and grandmother were Ukrainian Jews, living in Odessa before immigrating to the U.S. in 1905 following pogroms in their home country.\n\nDustin Hoffman\n\nThe star of \"The Graduate\" and \"Rain Man\" is the grandchild of immigrants from Bila Tserkva, Ukraine.

I think that Russian film is interesting, but I have nothing to do with Russia or Russian film. My parents were born in Ukraine: I'm Ukrainian. I'm not Russian. So, excuse me, but I don't belong here. It's best if we leave.\"\n\nJoseph Conrad\n\nThe \"Lord Jim\" and \"Heart of Darkness\" author was born in Ukraine and, despite being considered one of the greatest writers in the English language, didn't actually speak English fluently until he was in his 20s.\n\nGolda Meir\n\nThe \"Iron Lady\" of Israeli politics, Meir became only the third woman ever to become a prime minister and was one of 25 people to sign the Israeli Declaration of Independence. She was born in Kyiv, Ukraine, immigrating to America when she was 8.\n\nNatalie Wood\n\nIf her real name, Natalia Zakharenko, wasn't clue enough, Natalie Wood, though an American citizen, was the child of Ukrainians who immigrated to the U.S. Her family fled from Kharkiv and made several stops before finally making it to San Francisco.\n\nRelated: Rich, Famous — and Cheap! 40 Frugal Celebrities\n\nSteven Spielberg\n\nThe Oscar-winning director had two grandfathers from Ukraine, and has never been dismissive of his heritage.

They met at a time when Ukraine and Russia were one country.\"\n\nDavid Duchovny\n\nAfter \"The X-Files\" star Duchovny starred in a Russian beer commercial, some digging into his great-grandfather's paperwork found he hailed from Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine.

It's never too late to change.\"\n\nLenny Kravitz\n\nPreviously, the most interesting part of Lenny Kravitz's family background was his status as second cousin of Al Roker.
