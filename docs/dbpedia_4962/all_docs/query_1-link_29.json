Post-Soviet migrants have arrived more recently than the largest contemporary groups from Asia and Latin America who benefited from the passage of the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. Even though small numbers of political dissidents and Jewish refugees were able to leave the Soviet Union in the 1970s, only the demise of the socialist East Bloc and the triumph of neoliberalism in the late 1980s initiated large-scale emigration from the former USSR.3 An ideology, collection of policies, and mode of governance, neoliberalism entered former East Bloc countries at a time when it had already been dominant in the United States and across Western Europe for about a decade. Neoliberalism promotes the idea that self-regulating markets best allow individuals to pursue the acquisition of wealth. While they took different forms in the United States and several Western European countries, depending on each nation’s historical legacies and institutional structures (Hall and Soskice 2001), neoliberal policies have included the deregulation of markets, the liberalization of trade, the privatization of public sectors, the dismantling of social services and welfare programs, and the promotion of the financial sector over other economic activity (Harvey 2007).4 1\n\n2\n\n| Introduction\n\nThe Cold War constrained capitalism’s tendency to gravitate toward growing inequalities until the fall of state socialism in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe allowed global corporate and political elites to more intensely promote neoliberal ideologies and practices in order to build consensus for the further upward redistribution of wealth and power (Piketty 2014; Duggan 2014). The subsequent dramatic widening of inequalities between individuals and communities in the United States, as measured in the 2000 Census (Steger and Roy 2010, 60), pushed this issue to the top of Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders’s political agenda in the 2016 presidential election. Neoliberal transformations in the United States have been accompanied by the emergence of a “security state” apparatus (Hyatt 2011), which employs increasingly antidemocratic forms of governance to contain the growing dissent that accompanies increases in inequality. Differences among populations, such as those constituted by race or legal status, are further mobilized to justify increasingly segmented access to wealth and citizenship rights. While restrictions to legal entry and social rights, the rise in statesponsored anti-immigrant sentiment, and tightened immigration enforcement are directed at all noncitizens, they have targeted the largest groups of immigrants from Mexico and Central America, and are also extended to those from Muslim nations. The overrepresentation of Latina/os and African Americans in prisons, the spate of police shootings of unarmed black men and children that have received increased public scrutiny since 2014, and the profiling of “Arab/Muslims” through “antiterrorist” security measures further exemplify how racial profiling works to justify the deepening unequal treatment of various US populations. Capitalism and its neoliberal variant were exported beyond the United States and Western Europe through free trade agreements, structural adjustment programs, and so-called shock therapy approaches to economic reform (Steger and Roy 2010, 10). Shock therapies serve to rapidly advance neoliberal policies that promote the liberalization of price and currency controls, the withdrawal of state benefits, and the large-scale privatization of public assets. First implemented in Chile in the 1970s, since the late 1980s these policies helped abolish socialist property regimes in Eastern Europe where they created some of the largest increases in social inequality ever (Harvey 2007, 17). Shock therapies found their deepest expression in the Soviet Union. They led to the country’s dissolution in 1991 and the\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n3\n\nemergence of twelve successor states and three Baltic nations, which claim continuity with the pre–World War II states that existed prior to their annexation by the Soviet Union. The most rapid neoliberal transformations took place in Russia, the officially-recognized heir of the Soviet Union. As they occurred without financial mitigation or concern for the large-scale suffering of the populace, these processes led to years of severe economic stagnation, high unemployment, widespread impoverishment, and the rise of a small but powerful class of oligarchs who reaped most of the benefits of the transition (Klein 2007). Surging global commodity markets helped improve Russia’s economy between the late 1990s and early 2000s, but after the global drop in oil prices and the imposition of international sanctions in response to its 2014 intervention in Ukraine, Russia has found itself in a period of prolonged economic stagnation.5 While Ukraine, the second largest Soviet successor nation, was not subjected to the same level of shock therapy after it declared its independence in 1991, the country experienced a deeper crisis than other post-Soviet nations until its economy stabilized in the late 1990s. In 2008 Ukraine’s economy slowed, and it lapsed into a second recession in 2013. The massive social upheavals in post-Soviet countries have largely been attributed to the lingering effects of state socialism, such as corruption, authoritarianism, and the inability to commit to ethnic pluralism (Suchland 2015, 2011). But scholars of postsocialism have shown that developments in the former East Bloc, including the USSR and successor nations, also exemplify the delirious effects of neoliberalism (Keough 2006).6 The New Immigrant Whiteness examines representations of migration from the former USSR and successor nations to the United States—in TV shows, memoirs, fiction, and interviews—as equally important responses to the extension of neoliberalism, which has reshaped the causes and forms of migration to the United States as well as the ways in which immigrants are received and in which they adapt and maintain connections to their regions of origin. Transformations in the USSR and successor nations propelled significant diasporic outmigration to the United States, Western Europe, and Israel throughout the 1990s and into the twenty-first century.7 Ukraine has experienced an especially large population decline, partially as a result of emigration. The country’s population has decreased every year since its peak of 53 million in 1993 to 45 million in 2016 (World Bank 2017). In 2007\n\n4\n\n| Introduction\n\nUkraine ranked third among top labor exporting countries in the world (Tolstokorova 2010a, 84–85). Post-Soviet migrants employ virtually all forms of human movement available under current US migration law, which in turn afford them differentiated access to segmented citizenship rights. They have arrived as political and religious refugees, and as highly skilled, temporary labor, marriage, and adoptive migrants. Some also overstay nonimmigrant visitor or work visas. The majority of the early Soviet migrants were admitted as refugees from socialism (Logan and Rivera 2011, 30; Solari, 2010, 217). Large numbers also benefited from US legislation that established presumptive eligibility for asylum from religious persecution primarily for Jewish migrants, but also for Evangelical Christians and Ukrainian Catholics, who had sponsors in the United States (Korobkov and Zaionchkovskaia 2012, 328; Hardwick 2008, 38).8 Between 1993 and 2000, close to 400,000 immigrants arrived annually from the former Soviet Union, a majority of whom came as Jewish refugees (Kasatkina 2010, 200). By the early 2000s, when it had become more difficult to receive refugee status, the proportion of Jewish migrants in the post-USSR migration decreased significantly (Korobkov and Zaionchkovskaia 2012, 328).9 Throughout the 1990s, post-Soviet migrants became the second largest group of US marriage migrants and transnational adoptees (D’Aoust 2009, 7; H. Jacobson 2008). In addition, post-USSR migrants have participated in highly skilled migration in significant numbers. Post-Soviet immigrants who overstay their nonimmigrant tourist, student, or work visas to become undocumented are placed in a position similar to that of other migrants who do not meet the increasingly restrictive requirements for legal entry or cannot endure the long processing times for visas or status adjustments, and thus arrive unauthorized at US borders.10 Undocumented immigrants are not only denied the legal right to enter, reside, or work in the United States, but they are also excluded from access to most welfare rights. Available statistics on undocumented migration collapse arrivals from Europe and Canada. Their combined number surpasses migrants from the Caribbean and approximates those of migrants from South America (Passel and Cohn 2014).11\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n5\n\nIn addition to participating in all forms of migration to the United States, the post-Soviet diaspora is ethnically diverse, though the concept of ethnicity is defined differently in post-USSR nations and in the United States. In the former Soviet Union, major ethnic groups were often assigned their own republics (which have now become independent nations) and were considered “nationalities,” while minorities residing within such administrative units were regarded as “ethnic.” Substantial internal migration also led to the development of ethnicized identities where migrants lived in one Soviet republic but identified with another nationality (as ethnically Russian in Kazakhstan, for example), and where the descendants of a relatively high percentage of interethnic marriages may have identified with the national or ethnic origin of only one of their parents (Kolossov 2005). Migration to the United States from Russia decreased after the country’s economy doubled in size between 1998 and 2008 (Kotkin 2015), while the percentage of migrants from other Soviet successor nations increased.12 In the 2000 Census, those who were born in Russia made up nearly 40 percent of the diaspora, followed by 31 percent from Ukraine, 7 percent from Armenia, and smaller numbers from Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Uzbekistan, Moldavia, and Azerbaijan. In the 2014 American Community Survey (ACS), the percentages of Russians, Ukrainians, and Armenians had changed to 35 percent, 27 percent, and 7 percent, respectively. The remainder of the diaspora had become more diverse, with Belarusians, Uzbeks, Moldavians, Lithuanians, Kazakhs, Azerbaijanis, Georgians, and Latvians making up between 2 and 5 percent of the population. The ethnic and “national” identities that evolved in the former USSR continue to be assigned differential value in post-Soviet nations. Socalled ethnic “Slavs” (Russians, Belarusians, or Ukrainians) rank higher than individuals residing in or with ties to Asian countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan as well as those from the Caucasus region, which spans today’s Russia, Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan, and whose residents are called “Caucasian” and are often considered “black.” Immigrants may self-identify with their nationality or ethnicity—rather than as Russian—even if they hold a Russian passport (Kasinitz 2013), and those with backgrounds in Asia or the Caucasus may not identify as\n\n6\n\n| Introduction\n\nwhite or be racialized as such in the United States. For example, in the 2006–2010 ACS, 4.3 percent of Kazakh migrants identified as “Other Asian or Pacific Islander,” 7 percent of Kazakhs and 2.5 percent of Uzbeks as members of “two races,” and 1.4 percent of Georgians saw themselves as “black.” An analysis of the legal and ethnic diversity of the post-Soviet diaspora complicates the emphasis in immigration studies on the significance of the collective characteristics of immigrant groups for their adaptation and transnationalism. These features include the human and cultural capital with which members arrive, such as their education, language and workplace skills, as well as their racialization into US specific ethnic and racial categories. Members of the post-Soviet diaspora share features that render them distinct from other contemporary arrivals. Both men and women generally arrive with high levels of education and work experience (Logan and Rivera 2011; Kasinitz 2013).13 Despite their internal ethnic diversity, members of the diaspora are also collectively racialized as white in the United States. The diaspora is associated with views of the East Bloc as a monoracially white intolerant “other” that emerged during the Cold War (Atanasoski 2013) and with notions of a pan-European whiteness that is supposedly shared by all those of European descent in the United States and that consolidated after World War II. The New Immigrant Whiteness examines the emergence of representations that not only associate the post-Soviet diaspora with these general ideas of a pan-European whiteness, but more specifically characterize its members as successors of turn of the twentieth century European immigrants who became fully incorporated into whiteness by the 1940s. These representations are especially visible in US reality TV shows, a genre that, like the post-Soviet diaspora itself, emerged in the context of global neoliberal transformations. In the early 1990s, demands for lower program production and airtime cost led the TV industry to adopt new techniques and genres that resulted in the development of reality TV shows (Friedman 2002; Dubrofsky 2006). In these shows, the new immigrants are uniquely associated with mythologized accounts of turn of the twentieth century European immigrant adaptation and upward mobility, which describe how immigrants lifted themselves up by their bootstraps to achieve the American Dream. This portrayal keeps alive\n\nIntroduction\n\n| 7\n\nthe exceptionalist mythology of the United States as an immigrant nation. At a time of rapid national and global transformations that are characterized by increasingly segmented access to scarce resources, this narrative of exceptionalism ascribes to members of the post-Soviet diaspora the ability to access the same post–World War II regime of US citizenship rights that have linked a white racialized identity to upward mobility. Their association with this narrative renders members of the new diaspora significantly different from other contemporary arrivals who are collectively racialized as nonwhite. In fact, just as the pan-European whiteness of turn of the century immigrants emerged in direct opposition to the “blackness” of African American populations and as immigrant descendants consolidated their white ethnic identities in reaction to the 1960s civil rights movement, representations of the post-USSR diaspora as white are explicitly contrasted with immigrant groups racialized as nonwhite. But rather than opposing the whiteness of the postSoviet diaspora to notions of “blackness,” it is most often contrasted with the “brownness” of Latina/os who have become the focus of antiimmigrant rhetoric and politics. The extension of a historically constituted pan-European white identity and its association with a larger network of privileges to postSoviet migrants assumes that whiteness has remained unchanged since World War II when it was consolidated through US federal policies in the context of a relatively well-functioning capitalist economy. While an ascribed white racial identity continues to shield individuals from systematic and institutionalized privilege and racialized violence that manifests itself, among other things, in the profiling and unequal treatment of diverse groups, such as the association of African Americans with crime, Latina/os with migrant illegality, and “Arabs/Muslims” with terrorism, other US citizenship rights, which were more readily available to immigrants racialized as white, have undergone significant transformations. Access to education, unemployment, retirement, and social security, which brought modest prosperity and security to an earlier European immigrant working class and its children, and ensured them fuller entry into the labor market, has markedly declined. Noncitizens have increasingly been excluded from what Linda Bosniak has called “internal citizenship rights,” such as free choice of employment as well as access to\n\n8\n\n| Introduction\n\npublic services, welfare benefits, and jobs in the public sector (Bosniak 2006, 34, 49). In addition, while European immigrants and their descendants benefited from discriminatory hiring in the industrial labor force when the working class was built, that labor market has largely disappeared in the context of a neoliberal economy. Unlike US-born whites, post-Soviet migrants also generally do not have access to intergenerational savings, which George Lipsitz (1998) identified as a decisive factor in the consolidation of white post–World War II privilege. Through interviews with marriage migrants and the analysis of parental adoption memoirs that have proliferated as part of a boom in nonfiction since the 1990s, The New Immigrant Whiteness examines the extension of these mythologized and US-specific notions of whiteness to residents of the former East Bloc. The emphasis on family unification in US migration law has enabled the expansion of transnational marriage and adoptive migration—and the development of neoliberal migration markets—to the former USSR, in which post-Soviet immigrants are constituted as white even before they leave their countries of origin. In contrast, turn of the twentieth century Europeans were, in historian Thomas Guglielmo’s words, only considered “white on arrival” (2003). While nineteenth-century immigrant men brought marriage partners from their countries of origin, today predominantly Europeanidentified US citizens sponsor the migration of children or women from the former USSR so that they can create what they perceive as monoracial families. Older notions of a shared familial culture that is based on a common national or ethnic background have thus been replaced by the belief in a globalized form of US whiteness that signifies a shared racial identity. The attribution of this concept to residents of the former USSR or its successor nations transforms them into neoliberal commodities whose presumptive white racial identities increase their desirability and afford them preferred legal admission to the United States through sponsorship as wives and children. The transnational expansion of US whiteness racializes the new immigrants as white even before their arrival in the United States, while their supposed turn of the twentieth century European immigrant predecessors often oscillated between efforts to assimilate into whiteness and to maintain their national, religious, ethnic, or cultural differences. Turn of the century European immigrants struggled to keep their cul-\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n9\n\ntural distinctiveness and group ties, and Jewish immigrants in particular resented assimilation pressures because they interfered with their efforts to assert a distinct racial identity (Goldstein 2006). Even though their ascribed white identities provide post-Soviet immigrants with immediate racialized privilege, the neoliberal value assigned to these identities exposes marriage and adoptive migrants to heightened expectations of their fast-track assimilation to a middle-class whiteness. This pressure obscures the neoliberal conditions occasioning post-Soviet migration and erases migrants’ national, cultural, and linguistic differences, thus also impeding the maintenance or creation of bicultural or transnational identities. To differing degrees and with the exception of those who construct their identities exclusively in terms of their “nationality” or ethnicity, post-Soviet migrants are currently developing a “Russian” cultural identity through shared media, language, cultural institutions, and consumption patterns (Gold 2013; Kasinitz et al. 2004; Kasinitz et al. 2008, Kasinitz 2013). While this Russian identity can encompass Soviet Jewish immigrants, a minority of whom exclusively identify as Jewish (Kasinitz 2013), the emerging “Russiannenss” cannot simply expand upon an existing American Jewish identity that evolved from earlier immigration. The turn of the twentieth-century immigrants who largely came from the Russian empire, the geographical predecessor of the USSR, and often spoke Yiddish, assimilated to a Jewish American identity that had evolved from mid-nineteenth century central European Jewish immigration, has had a rather complex relationship to US notions of whiteness, and is simply not available to all post-Soviet migrants. Through interviews and the study of an emerging body of fiction by first- and 1.5-generation (post-)Soviet writers, The New Immigrant Whiteness moves beyond histories of the consolidation of immigrant whiteness and the association of this racialized identity with the postUSSR diaspora toward examinations of contemporary immigrants who are racialized as white but differently positioned in their access to segmented citizenship rights based on their legal status. The book establishes a comparative perspective through which to study undocumented migration from the former Soviet Union, explores post-USSR immigrants’ attitudes toward immigration from Mexico and Central America, and analyzes parallels between post-USSR and Asian immigrants who are similarly associated with the American immigrant dream of upward\n\n10\n\n| Introduction\n\nmobility. Such a focus renders members of the post-Soviet diaspora less exceptional from other contemporary arrivals and creates an agenda for further comparative work in a context where changes in the US economy and a declining welfare state are reshaping the US ethnoracial hierarchy. Even though race continues to function as a euphemism for geographical origin, ancestry, and culture, in the neoliberal context the concept also works to normalize deepening differential access to wealth (Melamed 2011, 44). Or as Ramón Saldívar has put it, while essentialist notions of race have given way to more complex understandings of multiethnic racial formations, structures of inequality continue to divide populations based on their perceived physical and behavioral characteristics within the larger context of white supremacy (Saldívar 2013, 2). The New Immigrant Whiteness adds a focus on the importance of differential legal status on arrival (which moves beyond the familiar distinction between legal and undocumented status) to the emphasis on the significance of collective characteristics, such as racialization and educational achievements, for immigrant adaptation and transnationalism. Differential legal status or the lack thereof shapes migrant access to segmented citizenship rights. Post-Soviet migrants of Jewish descent who benefited from refugee policies in the 1980s and 1990s generally came with their families, were able to naturalize quickly, received assistance from Jewish organizations, and had access to welfare benefits, housing, as well as language and employment training. While they benefited from early eligibility for public assistance and a fast track to citizenship, these immigrants work in occupations with lower prestige and earnings when compared to immigrants from Western Europe and Canada who are also considered white (Logan and Rivera 2011, 29, 39). Migrants admitted on highly skilled visas tend to be inserted into temporary and flexible positions that illustrate how highly skilled jobs have become associated with conditions of precarity. At least initially, these migrants tend to earn less than US-born workers and have fewer employment opportunities because their visas are dependent on their employers and because the adjustment of their legal status generally takes a long time (Banerjee 2006). For those who arrive with nonimmigrant work or visitor visas and overstay them, even higher levels of education, improved language skills, or longer stays in the United States usually do not translate into higher\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n11\n\nwages, and their upward mobility is severely restricted. Like other postSoviet women migrants, marriage migrants who are incorporated into the middle-class lives of their US husbands often experience a loss of occupational status, although they are legally able to work in the United States and are generally well-educated. Post-Soviet immigrant women frequently end up working in the lower-skilled jobs that dominate the postindustrial US economy and that tend to be held by immigrants (Logan and Rivera 2011, 27).\n\nPan-European Whiteness The field of whiteness studies, which consolidated in the late 1980s and 1990s in history, legal, and cultural studies, and later in sociology (Doane 2003), has emphasized the centrality of institutionalized white privilege and its link to white supremacy for any understanding of a white identity in the United States.14 In its origins, this work rarely considered distinctions between native-born and immigrant populations. Historians have filled in the gap by exploring the emergence of a panEuropean whiteness through a focus on the large numbers of so-called “new” immigrants who came to the United States between 1840 and 1920, primarily from Ireland, Italy, and the Russian empire. The size of this immigration far surpassed the Irish, Germans, and Scandinavians who had arrived primarily in the mid-nineteenth century.15 While eastern Europeans came from diverse regions, including Romania and the Austro-Hungarian empire, most were Jewish and arrived from the Pale of Settlement in the Russian empire (Gold 1999, 115). Its borders largely correspond to the historical boundaries of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth that included much of present-day Lithuania, Belarus, Poland, Moldova, Ukraine, and Russia. Because the Russian empire controlled emigration by granting exit permits predominantly to ethnic minorities such as Jews, ethnic Poles, Lithuanians, Finns, and ethnic Germans, these groups were disproportionally represented among US migrants (Schneider 2013, 37).16 Whiteness historians have focused on the place of these “new” European immigrants in the US “color” hierarchy, which divided nativeborn/established immigrant Europeans from nonwhite populations, particularly African Americans and the smaller population of Chinese\n\n12\n\n| Introduction\n\nimmigrants who had been arriving in the United States since the midnineteenth century. The black-white dichotomy, which originated in seventeenth-century African chattel slavery, informed legal definitions of US citizenship as limited to “free, white men.” As this binary was extended to new arrivals, Asian migrants were excluded from naturalization until 1943 and Mexican migrants were treated as members of a nonwhite, persecuted minority in the Southwest at the turn of the twentieth century.17 Because they were ascribed a white racial identity despite their origins in different European countries, however, immigrants from Ireland, Italy, and the Russian empire had access to naturalization and to better jobs than African Americans or Asian immigrants who worked almost exclusively in their own communities or in domestic/personal service (T. Guglielmo 2003, 29). The new European immigrants were also largely exempt from the kind of systemic, institutionalized racial violence that was directed at African Americans, Chinese, and Mexican immigrants as well as Mexican Americans (Fox and Guglielmo 2012). Noel Ignatiev’s work (1995) on the role of Irish immigrants as leaders in the crusade for Chinese Exclusion has shaped the view that European immigrants’ efforts to access all facets of whiteness required their embrace of white supremacy, particularly hostility toward their nonwhite contemporaries (Satzewich 2000). The scholarship cites Irish immigrant support of slavery and of the 1917 Literacy Act, the participation of Irish immigrants in conflicts with indigenous people and Mexicans in the war with Mexico, as well as efforts by some Italian and Jewish immigrants to prevent the influx of larger numbers of African Americans into their neighborhoods in the early twentieth century (Guterl 2001; MacDonald 1998, 301; Garner 2006, 260; T. Guglielmo 2003, 146; Goldstein 2006). The experiences of Jewish immigrants in particular question the notion that their efforts to enter the privileged echelon of the US racial hierarchy also necessitated their full support of white supremacy. Because they saw themselves as members of a racially and religiously distinct group that had been persecuted in several multinational empires, were exposed to revolutionary ideas about working-class unity, possessed skills that qualified them for occupations where they did not compete with African Americans, received coreligionist support that provided\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n13\n\nthem with an avenue for economic mobility not available to other immigrant groups, and faced social exclusion, Jewish Americans tended to withhold strong support for white supremacy, especially state-sponsored racial violence or exclusion (Goldstein 2006, 59, 75–76).18 Jewish newspapers and organizations systemically opposed Chinese Exclusion and the 1917 Literacy Act (Roediger 2005, 15; Barrett and Roediger 1997; Goldstein 2006, 31). In addition, despite their acceptance as racially white which enabled them to naturalize, the new European arrivals were considered not “quite white” as they faced social stigma, including occasional exclusions from schools, public accommodations, labor unions, and institutions of elite society; and Italians in particular experienced some racialized violence and lynchings (J. Guglielmo 2003, 11). With the exception of eastern European Jewish immigrants who often worked as peddlers or in the Jewish-dominated garment industry, immigrants were also confined to unskilled occupations where they earned less than native-born whites (Schreuder 1989, 133; Garner 2006, 265). They tended to concentrate in ethnic ghettos (Goldstein 2006; Ignatiev 1995) and were selectively excluded from admission to the United States through 1920s Quota Laws that were based on pseudo-scientific racial theories of differences among European national origins. These laws created a system of annual quotas that allowed greater numbers of arrivals from northern Europe while restricting immigration from southern and eastern Europe and completing barring Asian immigration, thus anticipating the biopolitical racialization of contemporary immigrants from Latin America (Roediger 2008, 159). Most of the new immigrants could only claim full inclusion into whiteness after World War II when they had achieved socioeconomic mobility from urban ethnic ghettos to suburbs, and had acquired educational and workplace skills (Alba and Waters 2011).19 At this time, European immigrants, and particularly their descendants, began to disproportionally benefit from expanded social rights under New Deal legislation that built the postwar middle class and provided European immigrants with a path toward socioeconomic mobility not available to African Americans. These welfare rights included subsidized mortgage loans, unemployment, Social Security retirement funds, and GI Bill benefits as well as job protections. In fact, European immigrants became\n\n14\n\n| Introduction\n\nthe greatest beneficiaries of FHA loans, having achieved higher rates of home ownership than native-born populations by 1940 (T. Guglielmo 2003, 147–148), and they were more likely than native-born whites to work in occupations covered by Social Security and nearing retirement when the program was instituted (T. Guglielmo 2015). While the unequal distribution of welfare policies enabled immigrants who had come from different countries and regions of Europe with divergent migratory goals, skills, and human capital to achieve similar outcomes three generations later (Alba 2009), it also led to the kind of residential and educational segregation that still characterizes much of the United States (Roediger 2005; Alba 2009; Lipsitz 1998). George Lipsitz has also emphasized the important role that the intergenerational transfer of inherited wealth to succeeding generations has played in helping to solidify white economic privilege into the contemporary moment (Lipsitz 1998). The scholarly emphasis on the fact that opportunities for upward mobility were selectively provided to those racialized as white emerged in response to the ethnic revival of the 1960s. Descendants of immigrants consolidated what Mary Waters has called “symbolic” ethnicities by selectively borrowing elements from disparate European immigrant backgrounds at a time when these cultural and national distinctions had only a minimal impact on their daily lives (Waters 1990). Some white ethnics employed these identities to disavow their white privilege by arguing that the hardships experienced by their turn of the twentieth century immigrant ancestors were comparable to the treatment of contemporary nonwhite groups (M. Jacobson 1998, 2006; J. Guglielmo 2003).\n\nThe Chapters This book brings together a variety of scholarly fields and perspectives to complicate the extension of a historically constituted pan-European white identity, and its association with an entire network of privileges, to post-Soviet migrants. A study of post-USSR migrants’ participation in various forms of human movement bridges existing scholarship on refugee, highly skilled, marriage, adoptive, and irregular migration, which have largely been examined in isolation from one another and with an\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n15\n\nemphasis on the groups that dominate each type. As a result, separate bodies of work have emerged to explore refugee streams from various Third World countries, highly skilled migration from East and South Asia, low-skilled and often undocumented labor migration from south of the Mexico-US border, “mail-order brides” from the Philippines, and transnational adoptions from China and Korea. Each chapter focuses on one such form of human movement in which members of the post-Soviet diaspora participate, and places it in dialogue with developments in the fields of American, media, whiteness, immigration, adoption, and Jewish studies, from which an analysis of this migration has largely been excluded. Historians and migration scholars have examined turn of the twentieth century migration from the Russian empire, predominantly by Jewish migrants from the Pale of Settlement, but have rarely explored post-1980s migration from geographies in Europe and Asia that made up the USSR. Some work in Slavic studies is emerging to examine historical outmigration from the former Russian empire to the United States—including the Russian colonization of Alaska as well as migrations after the 1917 revolution, World War II, and in the 1970s and 1980s—but, like US immigration scholarship more generally, the field has paid little attention to immigration since the late 1980s.20 Two separate forms of scholarship analyze the gendered movement of women who have migrated to the United States from the Global South and from the former East Bloc in the context of global economic restructuring (Suchland 2015, 6). The post-Soviet, Central European, and Eastern European women who have entered the intimate economy of sex work and marriage through migration tend to be examined from the perspective of human trafficking. They are treated as victims of criminal organizations, failed political systems, and corrupt political elites in former East Bloc countries. In contrast, migration from the Global South is considered in the context of the systemic structural exploitation of women under neoliberal conditions (Suchland 2015, 10). A small body of scholarship in Jewish studies has focused on Soviet and post-Soviet migrants who came as religious refugees, by emphasizing their similarities to migration from the Pale of Settlement in the Russian empire (e.g., Gold 1999), or at times by including this group\n\n16\n\n| Introduction\n\nin studies of second-generation immigrants to New York City (Kasinitz et al. 2004; Kasinitz et al.2008; Waters et al. 2010). The latter work has found that while Soviet Jews who came in the early years of the diaspora were able to benefit from the help of coreligionists and Jewish assistance organizations, many are participating in the creation of a new ethnic “Russian” identity. However, some construct their identities by using Soviet and post-Soviet notions of national origin or ethnicity, which includes more specific considerations as Ukrainian or Russian Jews, with only a minority seeing themselves as exclusively Jewish (Kasinitz 2013). Some scholarship has also examined the role of religion in slowing the acculturation of Protestant post-Soviet immigrants who came as refugees (Hardwick 2008). Having arrived as entire congregations and settled in West Coast localities with preexisting religious networks, these groups do not seem to have acculturated well, and many migrants have suffered from a loss of occupational status or unemployment (Hardwick 2002, 269). In the virtual absence of an established body of scholarly research on post-Soviet migration, this book employs analytical tools and theoretical frameworks from a variety of disciplines. My search for portrayals of post-USSR migrants led me to the medium of reality television, where some programs have turned their attention to the rise in global migration. I engage perspectives from media scholarship, including work on the development of the genre and the use of format adaptation, to understand how US reality TV represents post-Soviet immigrants as inheritors of the mythologized European immigrant dream in ways that diverge from their more established media portrayals as communists, terrorists, or villains. In my search for alternative representations of the post-Soviet diaspora, I had to create my own “archive” of materials, using the methodologies of several scholarly fields. One of those is the interview method, which is integral to much scholarship in the social sciences. While scholars have explored Soviet Jewish immigrants on the East Coast, I focus on the smaller numbers of post-USSR migrants in the US Southwest and examine their migration experiences and return considerations as well as their attitudes toward anti-immigration policies that have targeted Latina/os and, so far, have taken their most visible form in Arizona’s 2010 Senate Bill 1070. I also analyze the turn of the twenty-first century\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n17\n\nsurge in memoirs by US parents who adopted children from Russia and Ukraine. Finally, I use my training as a literary scholar to examine fiction by first- and 1.5-generation immigrant writers, which places Soviet and post-Soviet migration into comparative frameworks with other forms of contemporary human movement to the United States. The medium of fiction allows authors to articulate alternative views of the present and of a speculative future that do not need to be based on empirical evidence. The use of fiction also enables writers to highlight connections between issues that have not yet been brought together in academic scholarship or popular discourses. The first chapter, “The Post-Soviet Diaspora on Transnational Reality TV,” examines Lifetime’s short-lived series Russian Dolls and ABC’s Dancing with the Stars, a widely watched US reality TV show. Both shows exemplify the emergence of new narratives that associate the post-Soviet diaspora with idealized accounts of turn of the twentieth century European immigrant adaptation and upward mobility. While they focus on 1.5-generation immigrant participants who came to the United States as young children or teenagers, most likely as religious refugees who initially dominated the diaspora, the two shows consistently downplay the Jewish identities of their cast members. As they give representational shape to the ongoing construction of a collective “Russian” identity, Russian Dolls and DWTS characterize this identity as another ethnicized version of pan-European whiteness. Post-Soviet migrant cast members are portrayed as following in the footsteps of idealized early European migrants, and they are set in firm opposition to Latina/os. The chapter also examines media commentary surrounding the two shows as well as interviews with participants, their own use of social media, and their participation in a Ukrainian TV show in order to highlight issues left unrepresented on DWTS and Russian Dolls, particularly postSoviet migrants’ engagement with growing anti-immigration sentiment and their efforts to establish transnational and diasporic identities. This approach opens up perspectives that render post-USSR migrants less exceptional from other contemporary US arrivals. Chapter 2, “Highly Skilled and Marriage Migrants in Arizona,” discusses the results of my interviews with post-USSR immigrants in Phoenix, Arizona, in order to place the post-Soviet diaspora in the context of US scholarship on adaptation and return migration. The ma-\n\n18\n\n| Introduction\n\njority of my interviewees participated in two highly gendered forms of movement—they either arrived on male-dominated highly skilled or female-dominated marriage migration. These migratory forms have been spurred by the interests of US men in creating monoracial families and by the neoliberalization of US academic institutions that has enabled the hiring of large numbers of academics in contingent and precarious positions. Their differential legal status upon arrival provides marriage and highly skilled migrants with diverging access to economic, social, and cultural forms of US citizenship, community building, and opportunities for return. Highly skilled migrants live middle-class lives, appear less interested in participating in a coethnic community, and maintain limited physical transnational connections. In contrast, marriage migrants experience downward mobility and dependency on their husbands, encounter greater difficulties connecting to post-Soviet migrants who arrived on other legal categories, and consider return more often. While they are immediately provided with temporary green cards and membership in their husbands’ middle-class lives, the globalized form of US whiteness that the women were assigned even before they left their countries of origin also creates heightened expectations of their complete assimilation to a middle-class whiteness at the cost of their and often their children’s bicultural and transnational identities. Chapter 3, “The Desire for Adoptive Invisibility,” explores the surge in US parental memoirs of adoption from Russia and Ukraine in the 1990s and early 2000s to complement scholarship on transnational adoption that has focused on questions of race when examining the largest and earliest forms of adoption from China and Korea. The chapter explores three of the most influential parental memoirs of adoption from the former Soviet Union—Margaret L. Schwartz’s The Pumpkin Patch (2005), Theresa Reid’s Two Little Girls (2007), and Brooks Hansen’s The Brotherhood of Joseph (2008)—in order to highlight the centrality of race for adoptions from the former USSR. Like many other memoirs that have been produced since the boom of this genre, these three works propagate affective structures of neoliberalism that obscure growing domestic and global inequities (Gilmore 2010; Thoma 2014). In these memoirs, parents explicitly eschew the traditional humanitarian narrative of adoption and portray themselves as neoliberal consumers who have the right to select healthy white children from an\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n19\n\ninternational adoption market in order to forge families whose members look as though they could be biologically related. The authors’ belief that they share a preexisting white racial identity with post-Soviet children confers immense and immediate privilege onto adoptees. But this notion also reaffirms old-fashioned assumptions about immigrant adaptation. Because they are considered white like their parents, post-Soviet adoptees are expected to quickly and completely adapt to the middleand upper-middle-class cultures of their new US families in ways that ignore their cultural and linguistic distinctiveness, the reasons for their relinquishment, and the many challenges associated with their status as adoptees. The belief that US adoptive parents share a racial identity with children in the former East Bloc not only turns them into preferred commodities but also renders them particularly vulnerable to rejections or adoption disruptions, which may help explain the significant numbers of abuse and death cases of post-Soviet adoptees at the hands of their US parents. Chapter 4, “Fictions of Irregular Post-Soviet Migration,” explores Sana Krasikov’s short story collection One More Year (2008) and Anya Ulinich’s novel Petropolis (2007) to develop a comparative approach to representations of contemporary irregular and unauthorized migration, a form of movement that has been largely associated with migrants from Mexico and Central America. The fiction by Krasikov and Ulinich represents ethnically and racially diverse protagonists from Russia, Georgia, and Uzbekistan who arrive in the United States on nonimmigrant visas and become undocumented migrants. Even though they are often associated with the tradition of American Jewish literature, these two works clearly move beyond the themes of assimilation and family migration that dominated twentieth-century cultural productions by eastern European immigrants of Jewish descent such as Mary Antin, Abraham Cahan, and Anzia Yezierska. Their work laid the foundation for a literature of assimilation to a middle-class white US racial identity that only became fully available to European immigrants by the mid-twentieth century. Rather than continuing the traditions of earlier Jewish American writing, the fiction by Krasikov and Ulinich emphasizes their postSoviet characters’ experiences of diminished access to the US labor market, residency, and citizenship rights, and thus places this fictional work in the larger context of contemporary US immigrant writing.\n\n20\n\n| Introduction\n\nChapter 5, “The Post-Soviet Diaspora in Comparative Perspective,” analyzes additional data from my interviews with post-Soviet immigrants and Gary Shteyngart’s novel Super Sad True Love Story (2010) to outline other areas of cross-ethnic comparative research. In the interviews, post-Soviet migrants largely stressed their ambivalence toward laws targeting undocumented migration like Arizona’s 2010 Senate Bill 1070 from which they expected exemption because of their differential modes of entry as documented or highly skilled migrants (but rarely their ascribed whiteness). They also empathized with Mexican immigrants as the group most targeted by the law based on their shared status as immigrants or their experiences with state surveillance in the former USSR or in today’s Russia. Their views are reminiscent of the ways in which turn of the twentieth century European immigrants insisted on differences from their nonwhite contemporaries who were targeted by institutionalized racial discrimination. But the attitudes of post-Soviet immigrants also recall how eastern European Jewish immigrants expressed overwhelming ambivalence toward or rejected expressions of white supremacy through empathy with African Americans, which was often based on comparisons with their own marginalization in the Russian empire (Goldstein 2006). The ambivalent or empathetic attitudes of many of my post-Soviet interviewees, most of whom are not Jewish, do not serve to shore up their racial identities but largely underscore their social distance from Latina/os. Set in a near-future, dystopian United States that is undergoing similar shock therapies as the former Soviet Union, Shteyngart’s novel speculatively explores the position of second-generation Russian Jewish immigrants in the US neoliberal racial hierarchy through comparisons with Asian Americans. Shteyngart arrived in the United States in the late 1970s, before the immense growth in post-Soviet migration, but his novel addresses how second-generation Korean and Russian Jewish immigrants are similarly linked to the myth of upward mobility while Latina/os and African Americans are marginalized as losers of neoliberalism. The New Immigrant Whiteness calls for comparative studies of immigrant whiteness that set it alongside other racial formations through examinations of contemporary immigrants who are racialized as white but are differently positioned in their access to segmented citizenship rights\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n21\n\nbased on legal status. Such an approach addresses the growing discrepancy between the ability of whiteness to deliver on many of its promises to newcomers racialized as white, such as social acceptance and upward mobility through cultural assimilation on the one hand, and its ideological function as a means of pressuring immigrants to assimilate to racialized power structures that benefit an increasingly smaller elite, on the other. Eric Goldstein has argued that early European immigrants’ assimilation to whiteness was already less a matter of individual choice than the result of systemic pressures. While whiteness provided immigrants with significant economic and social privileges and largely exempted them from institutionalized racism and racial violence, the strongest pressures on immigrants to assimilate emanated from native-born elites who employed the black-white binary to obscure other fissures in US society and project an optimistic view of the US nation (Goldstein 2006, 3, 6). US elites have relied on this binary to gain the allegiance of the white underclass in order to retain their affluence and political power since the institution of chattel slavery (Morgan 1975). Anti-immigrant discourses and politics also served the interests of employers who promoted the belief that certain groups genetically fit specific jobs in order to undermine labor unity, depress wages, and spur competition (Barrett and Roediger 1997, 16–17). The extension of whiteness to new US arrivals and to populations who reside in countries of the former Second World that are portrayed as monoracially white provides them with even less of a choice over their own racialization and upholds the ideological dominance of a now globalized whiteness that obscures growing economic, social, and racial inequities among and within nations. In its focus on the importance of differential legal status on arrival, The New Immigrant Whiteness points toward comparative approaches to whiteness that move beyond the currently prevailing emphasis on groups of migrants of the same geographical and national origins. This focus threatens to reaffirm narratives of stark historical and contemporary divisions between differently racialized immigrant groups, in part through an emphasis on the importance of shared group characteristics. While acknowledging the continued centrality of whiteness as a racial category to which many members of the post-Soviet diaspora have differential access, this book explores the participation of post-USSR migrants in various migratory forms in order to call for work that outlines\n\n22\n\n| Introduction\n\nsimilarities between individual segments of the diaspora and other contemporary migrants in their encounters with increased socioeconomic inequality, tightened immigration restrictions, segmented access to diminished citizenship rights, the growth in anti-immigrant sentiment, and the challenges of establishing new collective immigrant identities with transnational and diasporic dimensions.\n\n1\n\nThe Post-Soviet Diaspora on Transnational Reality TV\n\nWhile they have largely been neglected in academic scholarship, residents of the former Soviet Union are often represented in US popular culture. Throughout the 1990s, they continued to be portrayed in Cold War terms as US enemies and mail-order brides or fetishized as political refugees from socialism (Katchanovski 2007; Carruthers 2009). In the late 1990s and early 2000s many Hollywood movies featured criminal characters with Russian and Ukrainian names, referenced the existence of a “Russian mafia,” and depicted “Russians” as terrorists and arms dealers (Katchanovski 2007). Popular serial dramas from the turn of the twenty-first century like NYPD Blue (1993–2005), The Sopranos (1999–2007), and 24 (2001–2010), similarly represented former USSR residents as terrorists or villains.1 A newer series like House of Cards (2013–present) has portrayed Russia and its president as one of the main US adversaries in the contemporary era. At the time of this writing, Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating Russia’s involvement in the 2016 US presidential elections. Even after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, highly stereotypical depictions of residents of the former Soviet Union as evil have tended to outnumber those of Muslim Arabs (Katchanovski 2007).2 Since 24’s first season in 2001, for example, its protagonist Jack Bauer of the fictional Counter Terrorist Unit tirelessly struggled to foil more “Russian” terrorist plots than attacks by Muslim Arabs. The “Russian” protagonists in 24 are always former military or KGB agents, come from some unspecified part of the former USSR, speak something barely resembling Russian, and are played by German, British, Irish, and US actors (Ohanyan-Tri 2015).3 The fact that the USSR’s largest successor nations, Russia and Ukraine, and their citizens are more frequently depicted as terrorists than are the residents of an equally homogeneously constructed ideological US opponent located in the “Middle East” shows that Cold War views of a world divided into two ideological camps remain entrenched. Different 23\n\n24\n\n| The Post- Soviet Diaspora on Transnational Reality TV\n\nUS enemies are simply conflated to help justify the US wars on terror in the old binary Cold War terms. As one of the newest and most widely watched media forms, reality TV shows from the 2000s have lent themselves especially well to portrayals of the post-Soviet diaspora that depart from these established media representations of Russians as major post–Cold War foes. The short-lived 2011 Lifetime show Russian Dolls (2011) and the immensely popular Dancing with the Stars (DWTS), which has been on ABC since 2005, exemplify the emergence of a new narrative that explicitly associates the post-Soviet diaspora with idealized accounts of turn of the twentieth century European immigration. Russian Dolls and DWTS highlight their cast members’ cultural assimilation to a “Russian” ethnicity and their upward mobility into the white middle class as they appear to be following in the footsteps of their supposed European predecessors who assimilated to a pan-European whiteness and whose descendants developed ethnicized identities in the 1960s. Just as turn of the twentieth century European immigrants were often positioned and placed themselves in explicit contrast to African Americans, post-Soviet immigrants are assigned a pan-European whiteness or one of its ethnicized versions through contrast with the largest group of contemporary migrants from Latin America. The reality TV genre emerged in the late 1990s at a time when the television industry was undergoing drastic transformations. The privatization and deregulation of large sectors of the industry and the subsequent arrival of new cable and satellite channels, created a need for programming that was predominantly driven by economic considerations, such as lower production and airtime cost (Biressi and Nunn 2005, 16). The use of program concepts or so-called formats is a cost-saving staple of reality TV. As they document and systematize the production knowledge gained from the development of a particular show, formats are duplicated or modified for introduction into other national markets in order to save money.4 DWTS is an adaptation of the British Broadcasting Corporation’s most successful reality show format Strictly Come Dancing. While it is not a format adaptation as such, Russian Dolls is modeled after MTV’s notorious docusoap Jersey Shore. As additional cost-saving measures, reality TV shows typically cast nonactors and employ minimal scripting in order to eliminate the need to pay unionized writers and actors. Par-\n\nThe Post- Soviet Diaspora on Transnational Reality TV\n\n| 25\n\nticipants in reality TV shows are placed in highly constructed and often unusual situations that encourage behaviors and interactions designed to produce maximum emotional effect. The live or recorded surveillance footage of these responses is then edited into narrative structures that mimic the storytelling employed in other, more scripted shows and that play to audience expectations by reaffirming familiar views of the social world (Friedman 2002; Biressi and Nunn 2005, 3). While reality TV thus actively constructs the “reality” it features through production and editing practices, the genre markets itself as providing audiences with unmediated, immediate, and intimate representations of ordinary people in unscripted situations, often by employing the tropes of revelation, truth telling, and exposure through interviews with participants (Biressi and Nunn 2005, 3–4). As it emphasizes drama and conflict to provide maximum entertainment, reality TV also engages with questions that other media forms rarely touch. The genre often addresses issues of individual and collective identity formation, and may even have taken over the task of constructing, not just representing, these identities (Turner 1996, 160). Dancing with the Stars and Russian Dolls give representational shape to the ongoing construction of a collective “Russian” identity, which the two shows portray as a contemporary version of turn of the century European immigrant adaptation and upward mobility. A game show, DWTS focuses on the relationships between predominantly US-born B-list celebrities and their professional dance partners, many of whom are post-Soviet immigrants who have become stars in their own right through participation in the show. Reality TV promotes the notion that cast members can attain celebrity status through involvement in the genre as a way to gain access to upward mobility. While the two shows depict their post-Soviet participants as updated versions of generic turn of the twentieth century European immigrants, Russian Dolls models its portrayal of post-USSR participants more specifically after Italian Americans. This collective identity consolidated in the 1960s alongside other white ethnicized identities to reference the immigrant roots of European-descended Americans with ancestors from Ireland, Italy, and the Russian empire (M. Jacobson 2006, 5). The mythologized accounts of turn of the twentieth century European migration that DTWS and Russian Dolls associate with the post-Soviet\n\n26\n\n| The Post- Soviet Diaspora on Transnational Reality TV\n\ncast erases differences in the arrival and adaptation of various European immigrant groups. The identities of descendants of turn of the twentieth century Italian migrants thus become interchangeable with those of contemporary post-USSR immigrants. The two shows depict an equally homogeneous ethnic “Russianness” that obscures intradiasporic distinctions, such as cast members’ diverse ethnicities and origins in different Soviet republics and their successor nations. While DTWS and Russian Dolls focus on 1.5-generation immigrant participants who most likely arrived as religious refugees, the two shows consistently downplay the Jewish identities of many of their cast members. Their association with a homogeneous whiteness or with one of its ethnic versions obscures the fact that, unlike other earlier migrants, turn of the twentieth century migration by those of primarily Jewish descent from Russia’s Pale of Settlement did not result in the development of a “Russian” ethnic identity to which contemporary immigrants could assimilate. Turn of the twentieth century arrivals instead largely identified with a Jewish Americanness that had been created by earlier arrivals from Central Europe. To acknowledge that members of the post-Soviet diaspora may be connected to facets of an American Jewish identity, however, would severely complicate the emerging association of the diaspora with a mythologized and monolithic European immigrant whiteness to which Jewishness has a complicated relationship. Just as the white ethnic identities that DTWS and Russian Dolls attribute to the new immigrants emerged in direct response to and in part as a backlash to the civil rights movements and growing immigration from Latin America and Asia in the 1960s, the two shows’ cast members are ascribed a white racial identity through direct contrast with new arrivals from Latin America. Emerging academic scholarship has similarly associated post-Soviet migrants with processes of racialization that were experienced by earlier European immigrants. As historians of whiteness have established, these migrants first sought entry into and then worked to maintain membership in whiteness by differentiating themselves from nonwhite populations and simultaneously denying their white privilege. The two shows represent members of the post-Soviet diaspora as setting themselves deliberately apart from and often engaging in hostility toward Latina/os. Thus, Russian Dolls devoted an entire episode to addressing prohibitions against interracial dating with Latina/os, while\n\nThe Post- Soviet Diaspora on Transnational Reality TV\n\n| 27\n\nsocial media and academic discourses surrounding DWTS have focused on how the spray tanning that is used by post-Soviet dancers underscores both their fascination with Latin American dance forms and their efforts to set themselves apart from Latina/os as the main target of antiimmigrant discourses. Because the two shows’ production of “Russianness” as an updated version of US immigrant whiteness relies on the idea that reality TV grants unmediated access to the “reality” it depicts, it is difficult to determine the degree to which the post-Soviet participants have been complicit in these portrayals. But some of the media commentary surrounding Russian Dolls and DWTS, particularly interviews with the shows’ cast, their use of social media, and their participation in other non-US TV shows where their identity is differently constructed, foreground the neoliberal push factors for post-Soviet emigration, significant intradiasporic differences, and post-Soviet immigrants’ efforts to engage with their homes and counter heightened US xenophobia. An acknowledgment of these factors underscores that post-USSR immigrants experience similar processes of adaptation and transnationalism as other contemporary new arrivals, which creates opportunities for comparative work across various diasporas.\n\nIntergenerational Upward Mobility through Dancesport on DWTS A BBC franchise, US DWTS is a dance competition and one of the most widely watched reality TV shows in which celebrities are cast. Created in 2005 after an Australian adaptation successfully debuted in the fall of 2004, the US version of DWTS format illustrates how the notion that celebrity status affords access to upward mobility has spread beyond elites and into the larger population (Turner 1996). By casting upcoming, established, or fading B-list celebrities who use the show as a springboard to jump- or restart their entertainment careers, DTWS highlights that reality TV now produces, markets, amplifies, and sells its own stars rather than simply features already established ones (Turner 1996, 156). DWTS follows its celebrities over the span of several months as they are trained by professionals in International ballroom dancing and related styles. Live footage of the couples’ dance performances and\n\n28\n\n| The Post- Soviet Diaspora on Transnational Reality TV\n\nof the judging are interspersed with recorded documentary footage of participants’ back stories, rehearsals, behind the scenes moments, and confessional testimonials. Because it is part of the BBC franchise, the US adaptation needs to reproduce the main generic elements of the original British format, particularly its use of the International style of ballroom, which originated in the United Kingdom in the mid-twentieth century and is considered the most prestigious style of dancing (McMains 2006, 95). This style differs significantly from the type of ballroom dancing that developed in the 1920s in the United States and has been most widely taught here. To be able to showcase International ballroom, the US version of DWTS cast a large number of foreign-born professionals who were trained in this style and participated in its dancesport version in locations outside the United States. Out of the original six professionals cast in the first season of DWTS, four were foreign born, and one, Alec Mazo, had emigrated from the former USSR as a child. When the cast was significantly expanded in 2006, several post-Soviet dancers were added as regulars. They included Maksim Chmerkovskiy, Karina Smirnoff, and Anna Trebunskaya. Maksim’s younger brother, Valentin Chmerkovskiy joined the show as a regular in fall 2011. Inna Brayer, who came to the United States as a young child and several first-generation immigrants, including Elena Grinenko, Dmitry Chaplin, and Anna Demidova, have also appeared in several seasons of the show. Gleb Savchenko and Artem Chigvintsev, who both left Russia as adults, were added in the last few seasons. In addition to hiring talent from Western Europe and Australia, DWTS was able to recruit from a large domestic pool of post-USSR immigrants whose arrival and settlement in the United States coincided with the adaptation of DWTS. Post-Soviet migrants brought with them a high regard for and training in ballroom. In the former Soviet Union, many parents sent their children—both boys and girls—to ballroom dance classes. Rigorous government-supported dance programs also prepared students for international competitions (Berger 2003). After the demise of the USSR, many highly trained ballroom dancers came to the United States and were able to make a living by teaching dance, opening dance studios, and seeking success as dancesport athletes (McMains 2006, 21; Berger 2003). Just as those fleeing Russia’s 1917 Bolshe-\n\nThe Post- Soviet Diaspora on Transnational Reality TV\n\n|\n\n29\n\nvik revolution made important contributions to the development of US American theater, the much larger migration from the former USSR has initiated a surge in ballroom dancing and an astounding growth in the number of dance studios in the United States. Ballroom dancing continues to be most popular among immigrants from the former Soviet Union and their children, whose parents see participation in the dancesport as a way to achieve the American Dream (McMains 2006, 24; Solomon 2002; “Why Russian-American Jews” 2015). Participation in ballroom is also viewed as a sign of education and a means of creating community (“Why Russian-American Jews” 2015). Even though the post-Soviet professionals in DWTS were originally envisioned as mere background to the celebrities whose apprenticeship as dancers was to be the focus of the show, over several seasons many of the dancers have become stars in their own right with a loyal following among the show’s audience (Barnes 2011). While US critics have explored issues of gender, ethnicity, and disability on DWTS with regard to the stars featured on the show, the representation of its professionals has not yet received scholarly attention.5 These cast members are not just hired to train celebrities. As members of a new diaspora, they act as what Anne Cooper-Chen (2005) has called “factors of glocalization” that facilitate the introduction of a global reality TV franchise like DWTS to another national media market like the United States. As regulars who have stayed on the show season after season, the professionals have increasingly been featured talking to the stars, the judges, or the show’s hosts. Many of these interactions highlight the post-Soviet dancers’ status as immigrants through an emphasis on their accents and their frequent lack of knowledge of older forms of US popular culture, with which the new immigrants tend to be unfamiliar. In season 10 (2010) audiences learned more about the show’s dancers through short videos that featured some of their biographies. These clips placed the post-Soviet cast squarely within established narratives of white immigrant success. The videos singled out these professionals from the show’s other foreign-born dancers of Western European and Australian background to highlight their stories of intergenerational upward mobility through immigration and participation in US dancesport. The clips about Chmerkovskiy and Trebunskaya briefly address the migration experiences of the two dancers who\n\n30\n\n| The Post- Soviet Diaspora on Transnational Reality TV\n\ncame as young children with their families. Trebunskaya is shown talking about her hard childhood in industrial Chelyabinsk, Russia, without providing specific details about the difficulties she experienced, and declaring that dance functioned as a form of escape. Her mother states that the family emigrated to help alleviate her daughter’s asthma. Chmerkovskiy’s immigration story is told by his father, who recounts that the family left Ukraine to provide a better life for their children and to spare their boys mandatory military service. The video clips reduce the push factors for the families’ migration, including social upheavals following the introduction of neoliberalism, to a more universal immigrant story, according to which movement is driven by the parents’ desire to provide better lives for their children. The clips also never address the legal circumstances under which the families of the two dancers were able to enter the United States. They make it seem as though any family that wanted a better life for their children, especially those from Europe, could just freely enter the United States. The videos thus reify the mythic notion of turn of the twentieth century European migration, particularly from the Pale of Settlement, in which entire families left behind their difficult lives in the “old” country so that the next generation could have better opportunities in the United States and in which immigration was not as tightly regulated as today. This myth of an immigrant America appeals to the show’s audience, which is dominated by women over forty who tend to vote Republican (Harnick 2010). It is unclear if the dancers and their families articulated their migration stories in these terms to the video producers. In her ethnographic work, Natalia Kasatkina has found that first-generation post-Soviet immigrants in Tucson, Arizona often provide rather vague reasons for their emigration (Kasatkina 2010, 125). In the narratives of Soviet and postSoviet Jewish families, however, their emigration from the Soviet Union or successor nations tends to be more specifically framed as a way to provide better lives for the next generation (Senderovich 2016). Compared to the DWTS portrayal of post-Soviet dancers as following in the footsteps of earlier European migrants on a path toward upward mobility, the large numbers of post-USSR dancers on the BBC original Strictly Come Dancing are depicted very differently. The BBC’s 2015 documentary, “Strictly Russian,” about two of its professional post-Soviet\n\nThe Post- Soviet Diaspora on Transnational Reality TV\n\n|\n\n31\n\ndancers who have most often won the show, instead highlights their exposure to government-sponsored training programs in the former Soviet Union.6 The film also acknowledges that the dramatic changes in the former USSR and successor nations shaped their emigration, asserting that participation in dancesport enabled post-Soviet dancers an escape from poverty and from gangs, crime, and drugs (Creighton 2015). The narrative of upward mobility that is so central to the videotaped biographies of US DWTS’s post-Soviet dancers not only reaffirms the exceptionalist notion of the United States as a nation of immigrants, but it also minimizes the national and ethnic diversity of the post-USSR diaspora. I was only able to verify that one of the post-Soviet professionals on the show, Inna Brayer, entered the United States with her family as religious refugees in 1989 (“Why Russian-American Jews” 2015). Asylum not only qualified Jewish migrants for public assistance, but it also allowed them to sponsor the migration of family members and provided them with shorter waiting periods for citizenship (Solari, 2010, 217). But other post-Soviet dancers on the show are also of Jewish desent. Karina Smornof has a Jewish father. Even though it is not stated in the DTWS video clip about him, Maksim Chmerkovskiy’s father is Jewish (but his mother is not), and in season 18 viewers were introduced to his monolingual grandmother who lives in New York. In the Soviet Union, ethnic intermarriages like that of Chmerkovskiy’s family were relatively common, so that a large number of post-Soviet family members arriving under US refugee policies were not Jewish, and even after 1989 small numbers of Jewish refugees were still allowed to enter the United States annually. While his portrayal on DWTS completely ignores this facet of Chmerkovskiy’s identity, judging by their social media presence he and his brother are highly aware of their Jewish background. They sometimes integrate symbols of Judaism into their self-representations, which is a relatively common practice even for secular post-Soviet immigrants of Jewish background. For example, in 2014 the Chmerkovskiy brothers used their Twitter accounts to post pictures of Maksim wearing a Star of David necklace and Val using arm tefillin in a Jewish weekday morning service. In addition to downplaying Chmerkovskiy’s Jewish descent and its likely significance for his family’s migration, DWTS’s focus on portraying his “Russian” identity also never addresses his origins in the former\n\n32\n\n| The Post- Soviet Diaspora on Transnational Reality TV\n\nUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (UkSSR) and its successor nation, Ukraine. Chmerkovskiy’s family left Odessa in 1994, three years after Ukraine had declared its independence from the former USSR. But throughout most of its seasons, DWTS simply referred to him as “Russian,” with host Tom Bergeron calling him a “blushing Russian” as late as May 2014. Probably because the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine had by then been widely reported in the US press, media accounts surrounding the show in 2015 sometimes also described Chmerkovskiy as “Ukrainian” or “Ukrainian American.” In interviews and on social media Chmerkovskiy has also oscillated between calling himself “Russian” and “Ukrainian,” but he did so using notions of ethnicity that were prevalent in the former USSR. While his use of the term “Russian” may simply refer to his identification with the Russian-speaking diaspora and the fact that Russian is his first language (Kolstø 1999; Wilson 1997, 181), Chmerkovskiy more likely employed it to refer to Soviet notions of ethnicity as denoting parental heritage. Both of Chmerkovskiy’s parents identify as ethnic Russians who resided in Ukraine and Turkmenistan, a former republic in Asia, for long stretches of their lives (Skripnikova 2011). Although he must have been exposed to Ukrainian in the media and in school when he lived there until the age of fourteen, Chmerkovskiy seems to have little knowledge of the language (Litskevich 2011a), which has only limited mutual intelligibility with Russian. Such monolingualism is more common among the ethnically Russian, Russophone minority than among Ukrainian- or Russianspeaking Ukrainians (Wilson 2002, 35).7 DWTS’s representation of post-USSR immigrants as homogeneously white Europeans who follow in the footsteps of earlier European migration is echoed in popular and academic discourses about the growing participation of post-USSR dancers in US dancesport, which contrast members of the diaspora with Latina/os. Instead of highlighting potential conflicts between post-Soviet dancers and the African American or Latina/o celebrities with whom they are often paired, discourses surrounding DWTS have focused on the centrality of spray tanning in International ballroom. Dance professionals use spray tan during competitions and performances as routinely as athletes in other sports, particularly in bodybuilding, to highlight their body image. A spray tan is assumed to make athletes appear healthier, slimmer, and more fit under\n\nThe Post- Soviet Diaspora on Transnational Reality TV\n\n| 33\n\nharsh camera lights, and to accentuate their body shape and contours as well as their muscular definition. The rise in the popularity of spray tanning is intricately linked to historical changes in attitudes toward skin color in Europe and the United States. Until the beginning of the twentieth century, pale skin was regarded as a marker of wealth and leisure, while a darker complexion was associated with those having to make their living by toiling outside. But when scientists in the 1920s determined that sunlight produced vitamin D and could prevent childhood diseases, the sun began to be regarded as a form of medication. Exposure to the environment was also prescribed as a treatment for tuberculosis, which was a leading cause of death. By the 1930s tan became a marker of vitality, beauty, and health, and beach resorts emerged as iconic vacation spots (Freund 2012, 3–4). As celebrities began to adopt and embody the trend toward tanned skin, the arrival of package holidays in the 1970s and 1980s made tanned skin accessible to a larger public. When health concerns about the negative effects of sun exposure arose, spray tanning products emerged to fill the gap. Especially in the United States, where skin color has been central to determining questions of racial identity, tanning raises questions about racial identification. Even though tanned skin is sometimes theorized as indicating individuals’ desire to change their race or become “the other,” the practice also enables the performance of a modified form of ethnicity within accepted parameters of whiteness. Popular discourses surrounding DWTS that are invested in trying to determine the place of post-Soviet immigrants in the US racial hierarchy often associate cast members deemed to have a more ambiguous physical appearance with spray tanning. Though he has repeatedly denied subjecting himself to the procedure, Maksim Chmerkovskiy has frequently been accused of engaging in the practice (Carter 2012). The determination that he must have artificially darkened his skin places Chmerkovskiy within the parameters of established US racial categories and ignores the high degree of ethnic intermarriages and population shifts in the former USSR that have produced differential appearances and forms of ethnic identification. On DWTS, spray tanning has also been employed to maintain strict divisions between white immigrant and nonwhite cast members. When in season 6 (2008) Polish-born dancer Edyta Śliwińska suppos-\n\n34\n\n| The Post- Soviet Diaspora on Transnational Reality TV\n\nedly “overtanned” and her skin looked darker than that of her partner African American football player Jason Taylor, for example, he also had to get spray tanned so as not to confuse accepted ways of differentiating between white (European) and nonwhite individuals in the United States in the interracial coupling (Chozick 2009). Academic discourses about spray tanning in dancesport have made similar assertions. Like scholarship that has traced the emergence of twentieth-century European immigrants’ white racial identity in opposition to “blackness,” this work positions post-Soviet dancers who spray tan in explicit contrast to the “brownness” of Latina/os. Dance scholar Juliet McMains (2001) has likened spray tanned post-USSR dancers to nineteenth-century blackface minstrelsy performers. Minstrelsy shows were especially popular between the 1820s and 1840s, when issues of slavery were moving to the forefront of US national debates. White male performers used burned cork to blacken their skin in order to create racial stereotypes through public ridicule. Initially minstrelsy perpetuated negative stereotypes about several racialized groups. Though it was focused on African Americans, native-born white minstrels often made fun of Irish immigrants who were seen as racially other and similar to African Americans. Whiteness scholars have posited that minstrelsy helped turn of the twentieth century European immigrants enter and assimilate into whiteness (Lott 1993; Rogin 1996). When Irish Americans began to dominate minstrelsy and became its most famous stars (Kibler 2015, 22), they challenged Irish stereotypes and asserted their Americanness, in part by ridiculing and thus distancing themselves from African Americans (Nowatzki 2006). These performers created an abject but fascinating blackness with which they partially identified in order to show that they shared a white racial identity with their audiences. When blackface reemerged in early twentieth-century film and on the stage, Jewish Americans took center stage (Kibler 2015, 23). Their use of blackface minstrelsy served to Americanize and whiten Jewish blackface performers against the backdrop of growing US anti-Semitism. By donning blackface, Jewish performers were able to distance themselves from negative perceptions of Jewishness and position themselves as both white and American (Rogin 1998). In a rare publication on the contemporary use of blackface by Asian American performers, Rachel Lee (2002) has argued that for\n\nThe Post- Soviet Diaspora on Transnational Reality TV\n\n|\n\n35\n\nthem the practice may not just be functioning as a form of racial appropriation, which would reinforce existing power structures and allow Asian Americans to escape the cost of being black. Lee speculates that their use of blackface may instead be read as an allusion to Asian Americans’ identification with African American struggles for emancipation and civil rights, and could thus be understood as a way of setting the grounds for potential alliances. In contrast, McMains extends the US history of European immigrant minstrelsy performances into the contemporary moment to read the spray tanning by post-Soviet dance professionals as a cross-racial act of appropriation. Probably because post-Soviet immigrants and their children have come to dominate the sport, McMains singles out postUSSR dancers from the much larger number of (white) professionals who spray tan for performances and competitions. She argues that for the post-Soviet dancers, spray tan functions as a form of “brownface” that allows them to appear Latina/o, particularly when competing in the “Latin” dances that were inspired by Latin American and Caribbean dance forms, and in which post-USSR dancers often specialize. According to McMains, their spray tan signals the post-Soviet migrants’ interest in Latin American dance forms and simultaneously their privileged white status, which indicates their difference from Latina/os who have been the focus of contemporary anti-immigration debates in the United States. As was the case with earlier European immigrants who had conflicted relationships with African Americans, McMains argues that spray tanning helps post-Soviet migrants assimilate to US whiteness at the expense of those who do not have that option because of their nonwhite appearance. The historical comparison is fraught, however. Differently from turn of the twentieth century European immigrants who participated in minstrelsy as a cultural practice that had evolved domestically in explicit response to assimilation pressures, the post-Soviet dancers on the US version of DWTS imported spray tanning from the former USSR, its successor nations, or other countries where the practice has been as integral to the ballroom dance industry as it has to other sports. Unlike minstrelsy, spray tanning did not emerge as part of conscious efforts to solidify a white US racial identity through opposition to and the denigration of cultures and individuals deemed nonwhite. In a different\n\n36\n\n| The Post- Soviet Diaspora on Transnational Reality TV\n\nnational context, the spray tan that post-Soviet and other professionals employ on the BBC’s original Strictly Come Dancing has also not been associated with racist attitudes or opposition to immigrants from other nations. Nevertheless, when used in the United States, spray tanning needs to be understood in the context of the US ethnoracial hierarchy, and post-Soviet and other dancers need to rethink their use of this practice.\n\nRussian Dolls and Intergenerational Mobility through Ostentatious Consumption While DWTS represents its post-USSR migrant cast as assimilated white “Russians” who have achieved the American immigrant dream of upward mobility through dancesport in order to appeal to the show’s mostly conservative audience, the first short-lived reality show to focus exclusively on post-USSR migrants, Lifetime’s Russian Dolls, was geared to an audience that also included the new immigrants and their children. The twelve twenty-minute episodes, which aired from August to October 2011, were cocreated by two post-Soviet Jewish immigrants. Alina Dizik arrived from Minsk, today’s Belarus, in 1989 and Elina Miller came from Kharkov, today’s Ukraine, in 1990. The two women met as teenagers in Chicago and fondly remembered New York City’s Brighton Beach from childhood trips (Alston 2010). Originally called “Brighton Beach,” the docusoap set out to focus on the life stories of residents of this Russian-speaking enclave as representatives of a larger community in the process of assimilating to a white US racial identity. First settled by early twentieth century eastern European Jewish immigrants, many of whom worked in the garment industry, in the late 1960s Brighton Beach was inhabited by retirees from the Amalgamated Clothing Workers’ Union. After the decline of this community, Jewish immigrants who were beginning to arrive in the 1970s, predominantly from today’s Ukraine, were resettled there (Orleck 2001, 123–124). Popularized in the 1994 Tim Roth film Little Odessa, Brighton Beach has also been linked to organized crime syndicates. With the recent arrival of migrants from various former Soviet republics, the percentage of the Jewish population in Brighton Beach has decreased and the influence of migrants from post-Soviet Asian countries has become visible in ethni-\n\nThe Post- Soviet Diaspora on Transnational Reality TV\n\n|\n\n37\n\ncally mixed restaurants and other businesses. Dizik and Miller seem to have been aware of the ongoing transformation of the enclave and the post-Soviet diaspora before they created the show. They have stated that they wanted to cast a variety of “ethnic” archetypes on Russian Dolls, such as “a very straightforward ethnic Russian who’s proud of the motherland,” a Russian Jew, and someone from the Caucasus in order to “create a microcosm of the former Soviet Union” (Alston 2010). But the show’s cast does not reflect the diversification of Brighton Beach or engage with the internal ethnic and national composition of the former Soviet Union. Instead, Dizik and Miller selected mostly Jewish cast members who, like them, came mainly from today’s Ukraine, Belarus, and also from Moldova as part of the large post-1980s migration. Many of the cast do not even live in Brighton Beach. As in DWTS, cast members are identified and at times are also shown to self-identify as “Russian,” while their more complicated forms of association with various Soviet republics and successor nations are ignored, and their Jewish identities are downplayed. The show also perpetuates several stereotypes about “Russians.” The change in the show’s title from “Brighton Beach” to Russian Dolls introduced explicit visual imagery in its opening credits that placed the female cast inside Russian nesting dolls. Even though these dolls are traditionally associated with notions of motherhood, the term “Russian Dolls” also gestures toward escort services, prostitution rings, and mail-order brides. In addition, while the show’s promotional slogan, “The Russians aren’t coming, the Russians are here,” signals that a sizable post-Soviet community has already developed in the United States, it also alludes to Cold War fears of the USSR as a country intent on invading the territory of the United States. In its advertisement of the docusoap, Lifetime insisted that Russian Dolls provides “a glimpse into the lives of members of an immigrant community who are American without having yet become fully American” (Reddy 2011). Russian Dolls highlights how the cast’s low-brow, conspicuous consumption patterns provide them with the illusion of upward mobility and also reveal that they are not yet fully assimilated, but remain part of the “ethnicized” lower class. Russian American novelist Michael Idov (2011) has described Russian Dolls as a form of minstrelsy, where members of one ethnic or racial group created and perpetuated stereotypes of other groups thought to be inferior. Idov has argued that\n\n38\n\n| The Post- Soviet Diaspora on Transnational Reality TV\n\nthe reality TV show similarly allows one segment of a particular group, namely “assimilated [middle-class] Russian-Americans,” to enter show business by ridiculing and “exploit[ing] the image of the unassimilated Russian-American.” The majority of Russian Dolls’ multigenerational female cast arrived in the United States as part of the post-USSR migration that started in the late 1980s. While details of the cast’s migration background were rarely shared on the show, according to the Lifetime website and publications surrounding Russian Dolls, forty-seven-year-old Renata Krumer came from Belarus when she was in her twenties, thirty-four-year-old Marina Levitis came from Ukraine in 1991, twenty-three-year-old Diana Kosov arrived from Moldova in 1991, twenty-six-year-old Anastasia Kurinnaya came from Ukraine in 1988, and twenty-two-year-old Anna Khazanov arrived from Ukraine in 1998, at age nine. But the show represents members of the two generations very differently. The lives of the younger, 1.5-immigrant generation cast are portrayed through parallels to the hedonistic ethnicized youth subculture embodied in the notorious MTV docusoap Jersey Shore. In contrast, representations of the first-generation immigrant women in their late thirties and fifties who are culturally less assimilated but have made it into the middle or upper-middle class, are modeled after the (supposedly ethnicity-free) culture of ostentatious consumption showcased on The Real Housewives, which was itself modeled after soap operas that focus on the lives of upper-class women. The women on Russian Dolls—a jeweler, a radio show host, and the wife of the owner of Brighton Beach’s well-known nightclub, Rasputin—are identified by displays of their wealth in ways that also allude to the stereotype of the newly rich “New Russian” elite, which is associated with criminality and gaudy consumption habits. In keeping with this stereotype, Marina’s husband, the owner of Rasputin, was convicted of felony charges during the airing of the show.8 Like DTWS, Russian Dolls emphasizes the stories of its 1.5-generation protagonists, whose experiences resemble those of the two shows’ coproducers. These cast members have not yet arrived in the middle class and are aspiring to the kind of white ethnicized identity presented in the notorious Jersey Shore to which writers and producers explicitly compared Russian Dolls. A casting call for the show, posted in Brigh-\n\nThe Post- Soviet Diaspora on Transnational Reality TV\n\n|\n\n39\n\nton Beach, asked: “Are you the Russian Snooki or The Situation? Are you a super outgoing and fun-loving Russian-American that sometimes sneaks kalbaska, pel’meni and vodka from the fridge? Can people hear the Euro/Techno/Russian music blasting from your car before they see you pull up? . . . The cameras will roll as you do what you do best—eat, drink and PARTY.” Jersey Shore was the first US reality show to sport a white ethnicized but ethnically homogeneous cast, which was supposedly Italian American. This premise very much contrasted with that of the earliest US reality show, MTV’s The Real World, which assembled a racially and ethnically heterogeneous cast in order to generate conflict among cast members. Jersey Shore highlights the persistence of remnants of twentiethcentury southern European racialization by marking a white, workingclass subcultural Italian American identity as ethnic. Many Italians remained poor and working class longer than most other European immigrants (J. Guglielmo 2003, 3). These migrants and their descendants came to be associated with an ethnicized group identity. Donald Tricarico (2007) has theorized that the Italian American youth subculture originated in pejorative views of new arrivals from Italy at the turn of the twentieth century, and was reinforced in the 1940s and 1950s—at the same time that a pan-European notion of whiteness emerged—through association with notions of the “Italian mafia,” street gangs, and the movie Saturday Night Fever. In the film, working-class Italian American youngsters try to escape the restrictions of their class by participating in the glamorous world of disco clubs. Like these Italian American youths of the 1950s, Jersey Shore’s cast is not quite part of the middle class, but they are also not members of an oppositional youth culture that tends to be linked to urban youths who are racialized as nonwhite. Rather than escaping from the presumed constraints of their ethnic identity or its negative connotations, the Italian American youngsters reaffirm it by creating an ethnicized style that incorporates several sites of consumption such a"
