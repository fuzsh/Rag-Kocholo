Know that I love my kids more than myself,\" he wrote to his Instagram on Monday, February 5, alongside a carousel of photos of Jett.\n\n\"My son was in a car accident and was airlifted out,\" he continued. \"He lost the battle with his right leg and is fighting for his life.\"\n\n\"I'm completely shattered,\" Josh admitted. \"Please pray that my son pulls through this with no more complications. I love him more than life itself. Love you all.\"\n\nFellow 90 Day universe alums flocked to the comments section to share words of love and support for the heartbroken father.\n\nTyray Mollett wrote, \"Sending prayers to you and your family bro üôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæ he‚Äôs got this,\" and Kimberly Menzies chimed in, \"Praying for him and sending positive thoughts on his recovery.

Praying for his recovery,\" one user said of Jett, and another added, \"That‚Äôs absolutely devastating, as a father reading this really hurts. Praying for young Jett‚Äôs speedy recovery.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, February 7, Josh provided an update in a short video shared to his Instagram Story.\n\n\"I've been here in the hospital with Jett and I wanted to say thank you to everybody reaching out and messaging me [and] the prayers,\" he said at the time. \"I appreciate everybody. It's been a very tough time. Jett just went into surgery ... things are looking up. He's been alert, he's been ornery and he's been arguing with me and I'm happy about it.\"\n\nSeveral hours later, the TLC star shared that Jett just got out of surgery for his left leg, noting the \"muscle, tissue, veins and nerves are all healing and progressively getting stronger.\"\n\n\"Vitals have consistently been holding for the past few days!! He's no longer sedated and waking up with lots of questions and not understanding why he has a breathing tube,\" he added. \"He's feisty and sweet, just like he's always been.\""
