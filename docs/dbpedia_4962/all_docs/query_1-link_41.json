        "text": "March 21, 2018\n\nI've put off writing this review for a couple of days because this is a hard one for me. I'm a fan. I've followed Val since he first appeared as a guest on Dancing With the Stars. I've watched him grow as a teacher and coach. I've admired his relationship with Maks, there is no doubt it is genuine. I've seen him with children with special needs or who are ill and they just love him.\n\nAll that being said, I enjoyed the book but I didn't love it. I liked that he didn't hide the struggles his family had. It wasn't all easy when they migrated to America but they put in the blood sweat and tears to get where they are today. The love for his adopted country also comes through although I found it interesting that nothing was mentioned about actually becoming a citizen. I also like the way he respected his dance partners when discussing his time with them. Other authors haven't been as kind. What I didn't like, first the profanity could have been toned down. As Val would say, it was extra. It didn't necessarily offend me, it just detracted from the story he was telling. With his creativity and background, I think he could have got his point across with a whole lot less of it. Second, he comes across as arrogant and cocky. I'm not saying to some degree he isn't, but he is also so much more and I feel that got lost.\n\nFor a fan it was an enjoyable read with a few insights I didn't already know.\n\nMarch 28, 2018\n\nI gobbled up this book in three airplane flights. On one leg, my seatmate, a 10 y/o boy remarked, ‘wow. You read fast. You’re the only one in our row who didn’t watch a movie’. I tried to tell him what pleasure there was to be had in reading, but he wasn’t buying it.\n\nI can’t think of many 30ish authors whose autobiographies are worth reading. But here is one of them. Bias alert: I am quite a fan of the brothers Chmerkovskiy and squarely in their camp. This book is frank (let me repeat, candid as in nothingheldback candor, the kind that made me realize the age gap between Val and me. My proper Bostonian mother would have been mortified had I written a book this truthful at that age). But Val is authentic and dishes out his life just as it has been served to him - straight up and fast.\n\nVal connects with people - very well. To his thinking, there is not much purpose in a life without connection and helping others. His large and generous heart beats true on every page. I appreciate his love, pride and loyalty for his family (see #familyovereverything). His life is an immigrant’s patriotic love story for America. He’s a hugely accomplished ballroom dancer and one of the great delights of the book, having followed Val for some years now, were the behind-the-scenes backstories on his partners, their triumphs and trials. Val also provided insight into the mind-boggling elements of choreography (he makes it look so easy!). He melted me with the line, “I paint with movement”.\n\nIn 2016, I had the pleasure of seeing Val and his brother Maks’ dance tour. During the performance, there were women with their smartphones held up for much of the show, catching it on video. (I should mention these women were in the first two rows of the audience!). Maks and Val actually asked them - WHY are you doing this?! Wouldn’t you rather be IN THE MOMENT, savoring the sheer joy of an artist’s live performance?\n\nVal mentions this 21st century issue in his book - that being on a cell phone is taking us out of the moment, away from actually living and experiencing life. This is a lesson worth learning young.\n\nDecember 8, 2023\n\nI have loved and admired this man long before I’ve read this book. After reading his book I feel a deeper love and admiration for him. Getting to read about his upbringing and how he started compared to where he is now was so inspiring. Forever proud of Val.\n\nApril 15, 2018\n\nThis book really let us get a glimpse of the man behind the ballroom shoes. I've always felt like Val puts up his most professional side, as anyone should ... really. But with his book, written in his words? I got more of a complete picture. He's a man with a lot of charisma, and he's been through a surprising amount. And side note ... I've never in my life read a book where the sexiness of the individual comes through in the written word quite as well as this. Holy hell, Val.\n\nI thought he did a great job with the audiobook, and I'd definitely listen through this again at some point.\n\nJanuary 12, 2018\n\nYawn! Boring read, not particularly engaging or well-written. Just trading on the supposed fame of the author.\n\nMay 12, 2021\n\nI really enjoyed Val's story and how he told it. I couldn't get my hands on an actual copy of the book, but I got the audio version and I loved that Val narrated it! I feel like it made it more real. I think the fact that he didn't shy away from saying his feelings about all the people he's danced with or almost danced with (or could've possibly married 🤣🤣 ) made it interesting. I had no idea that him and Julianne Hough almost partnered up. That story was interesting and the outcome kind of hmm worthy. Several years ago, momma and I went and saw him and Maks on tour and you could see their bond through their dancing. Everything that Val tells makes that bond even deeper. And yeah Val still gives off his cocky attitude, but that's who those boys are and I'm glad he didn't dim it down for the story!\n\nFamily means a lot of the Chmerkovskiys and I love that so much because I feel the same way ❤❤\n\nSeptember 2, 2019\n\nI’m a huge fan of Val on DWTS. I also really enjoyed listening to his book about his experiences leading up to and including DWTS. I was surprised how the first 1/3 of the book felt like it was a tribute to his brother Maks, but he did a good job of explaining how very instrumental Maks was in shaping his life and career. As such, I can see dedicating so much of the book to his appreciation for his brother.\n\nI love that he read the book himself as I love hearing how an author means various comments to be intended in the author’s voice. He’s funny, intelligent, and brash at times. Overall, I enjoyed listening to his book and was thankful I invested the time listening to it.\n\nOctober 9, 2018\n\nDancing has been a passion of mine since I was a kid, so it is no surprise that I'm a complete fan of \"Dancing with the Stars,\" and, consequently, the dancers on it. This book is a combination of information about the show, the Chmerkovskiy family's immigration, and Val's personal life.\n\nYou've heard of tell-alls? Well, Val definitely tells ALL. Sometimes that is fascinating, and sometimes that is a little uncomfortable. That said, I truly enjoyed reading his book.\n\nApril 8, 2024\n\nLove Val! Love his story! I listened to this book on audible read by Val himself and that definitely contributed to the enjoyment! Took me a while to finish because I only listen in my car on longer rides but there was nothing better than driving along with Val by my side!\n\nIt was a good balance of stories from all aspects of his life along with his family (especially Maks!). If you’re a Chmerkovskiy fan, I highly recommend the audible version of this book!\n\nMarch 20, 2024\n\nsuch a great read and really exactly what I wanted out of this book.\n\nlearning about his background with dance and how he rose in the ballroom world with the partner drama and then discussing his time on DWTS and how each partner had an impact on his was awesome. I wish we got more jenna and more dwts but he said there will be other books so i’ll wait\n\nAugust 7, 2018\n\nI listened and enjoyed! He’s a character and also very inspiring and hard working!\n\nMarch 31, 2024\n\nI learned a lot about competitive ballroom dancing and Valentin Chmerkovskiy but the profuse profanity detracted from the story. In terms of the quality of writing let's just say that Val is my favorite Dancing with the Stars pro.\n\nJuly 25, 2022\n\nAs a fan of DWTS, and the Chmerkovskiy brothers in particular, this was an interesting look into what brought them to where they are now.\n\nSeptember 9, 2018\n\nAll time DWTS fan who previously liked Val, but came away from this book with a much more negative feeling about him. Although he said/wrote all the right words about thanking people and being humble, I found the entire book (including his Best Man's speech at Maks' wedding!) to be totally self-serving and egocentric. I'm cure that was not Valya's intent, but it's how I perceived it.\n\nBook itself described incidents totally out of order. Jumped around a lot...not my style for a memoir.\n\nSorry I read it.\n\nMay 24, 2018\n\nI am an avid fan of \"Dancing with the Stars\" and was ecstatic when Val Chmerkovskiy decided to join his brother, Maks, on the show. Knowing Val's many talents including his music, I expected this book to be phenomenal. Perhaps my expectations were too high in that regard. Although I did enjoy the book, it wasn't the most exhilarating for me. There were points in the middle where I had to put the book down for a while and return to it later. It wasn't that the topics were particularly heavy at that stage, but that I had no incentive to keep reading. I understand how the setup worked, switching back and forth between entertainment world and personal world, but I felt that made the story disjointed at points. I would have preferred a chronological progression but I can understand that authors would not want readers skipping parts of the story to get to others. I have seen a few reviews that complained about the amount of profanity in the book, but I felt that added authenticity. I could hear Val's voice in my head (no, I did not purchase the audiobook) as I read the story. It helped me to get the flow of the story and made the sarcastic moments that much better. (By the way, the sarcasm was my favorite part!) Overall, I found this to be a good book, but not one that stands at the top of my favorite memoirs.\n\nJune 11, 2018\n\nHow can a sidekick dancer write one of the more interesting recent memoirs? My expectations were low when starting this book but this is an engaging book (written with a lot of help from Gil Reavill) that wisely places the author's season-by-season experiences with dance partners as the focus of many chapters. Instead of just starting with his life story in Ukraine he uses the first fifth of the book to tell stories about how he got on Dancing with the Stars and what it was like to work with celebrity partners. After the first few chapters he then mixes in his life story with that of his time on the show, making for mostly entertaining reading.\n\nThis man is deeply dedicated to his family and we get to know them well here. The early years in Ukraine are interesting (though there could have been more details) and when the family moves to the Bronx it's a shock that they encounter more violence and insults in America than they ever did in Russia. The book becomes half about his famous dancing brother as well, with the two boys in competition with each other. Val goes overboard teasing his brother, putting him down, revealing embarrassing stories (he could have skipped the part about Maks filling his pants on the airplane when they moved to America!), and bragging that Val the younger had become equal to the elder. But through it all there is demonstrative love, with family first above everything else in life.\n\nIf there's one problem with the book it's that Val brags about himself way too much and has a bigger ego than any I've ever encountered before in a book. He thinks incredibly highly of himself and makes sure you know about his successful dance career. He repeats mentions of his awards over and over, and the book starts to drag as he goes into too much detail about his world competitions or successes. Cutting out 30 or 40 pages would have made the read a little smoother and made the reader appreciate the author more. We don't need to have him continue to tell us how great he is--we got it the first time it's stated on the very first page!\n\nI actually learned a life lesson from the book. Val had to make a distinction between the children he taught at the family's dance studio in New Jersey and the adults that he coached on the TV show or in their adult dancing clubs. The kids that wanted to become champions were disciplined strictly and barked at in order to improve, but that would have only upset adults that were dancing for fun who needed to be finessed with lower expectations and a lot of personal charm. I took away that when teaching someone you have to think about the expectations of the audience (the student) and adapt the goals or teaching style to what they're there of, even if you're training multiple groups the same thing.\n\nAlso what's interesting is what Val doesn't say in the book. There are a couple of his celebrity partners that he basically ignores (Danica McKellar must have been trouble because he quickly skips past her while devoting a dozen pages to each of most stars). There are also some private details that he leaves out (his dad's shifty finances, implying that the Mafia was involved in some of his family's business dealings, and failing to talk much about women Val was involved with). But overall it's a surprisingly good book that has a lot of depth and in the end is turned into an inspirational story.\n\nDecember 3, 2018\n\nUpdate 7/3/2018: So far Val has explained how he met Laurie, how Maks got onto DWTS, how he got onto DWTS, complained that he screwed up with Elisabetta Canalis, how he redeemed himself with Sherri and Kelly, and how he creepily went on chat forums to defend Maks. And all I kept thinking was \"He isn't as into himself as I thought.\" Yet at the same time, I had this reaction:\n\nDon't get me wrong, yes he redeemed himself after his first season but at the same time it kinda strikes me as hilarious that he and Kelly faked their romance angle so much just to stick around. You weren't fooling anyone Val....we knew it was fake. The thing that bothered me more was that he still comes across as a bit over confident still.\n\nUpdate 7/4/2018: His family story/background is amazing. I never knew some of this. It was touched upon on DWTS but now I'm getting why Maks and Val are different in a sense.\n\nUpdate 7/5/2018: The stuff about his partners on the show in this section was VERY enlightening. Kinda feel bad for Janel to be honest though. She must have thought \"boyfriend and a great experience\" and like Val said, they were quickly overtaken media-wise with the romance angle. But at the same time they could have stopped it. Just could have went instead of writing about it and complaining. Just a thought:\n\nElizabeth was a fun section since she did this on the show:\n\nDanica was a sweetheart. Boring but a sweetheart. LOVE her Hallmark movies though.\n\nRumer falls into the same catagory as Danica but anyone that can do this and look that good doing it....you have my respect.\n\nAnd Zendaya......oy. Ok so I hated this pairing on the show because I still think she was over scored. She definitely had an experience though according to Val. Kinda weird she went from this to this though at the drop of a hat:\n\nThe stuff about how his life in America when he was younger was captivating. I have to give him credit on one thing in particular: He can do it all. Dancer? check. Media personality? check. Rapper? check. Writer? Check. Violin player? Check. Basketball player? Apparently so.\n\nThe insight about Maks is just eye opening though. Maks has softened a bit as he got older it seems.\n\nHis insight into Italian first names is SPOT ON.\n\nUpdate 7/6/2018: The sections about competitions and Dance With Me were captivating. Not so much the section about the Ukranian version of the Bachelor. But it gave me my favorite quote from the memoir:\n\n\"According to the concept of The Bachelor , Sasha was the supposed love of Maks's life. She lasted with my brother for all of two days.\"\n\nThe chapters about the remainder of his celebrity partners were great. He and Tamar were a fun pairing but I still got the sense from Val that he liked that season a bit more than others. Plus they did this:\n\nGinger is the perfect example of unexpected. She is a gem.\n\nLaurie is the highlight of the past couple of seasons of the show in my opinion and it seems like he loves her as much as the rest of the world does, which is great.\n\nNormani was a tough section and season for me due to two reasons: 1)Overscored and 2)Overrated in general. She has a great voice but she isn't that good of a dancer and America must have picked up on that since she came in third and\"shocked\" everyone. Nice that Val made the band have fun on tour though? In hindsight, not a surprise the band broke up.\n\nOnly minor complaint I had about the ending was that he should have just added a bit more about Victoria but I guess the next book will have more about her experience on the show?\n\nFinal Review\n\nThis was an unexpected treat and he is a great writer. Saying that, I cannot wait for his next one.\n\nNovember 24, 2018\n\nI’ve watched Dancing with the Stars (DwtS) off and on over the years. Who wins doesn’t really matter, and I don’t vote for anyone. I don’t care for the manufactured melodrama and suspense elements of the show; when I watch, it’s only for the dance performances. I’m not much of a dancer myself (though sometimes I’d like to be), and some steps/styles appeal to me more than others. I’ve never heard of many of the “stars” before their appearances on the show. Val isn’t my favourite of the pro dancers, but I don’t say that to be mean; it’s just that I’m not a fangirl. I never gave any previous thought to what sort of life Val (or his somewhat infamous brother, Maks) had beyond the show. But I was browsing the library shelves one day in a “let’s see what’s here”/“maybe I’ll try something different” mindset, and I ran across this. I thought: “Immigrant from Ukraine? Okay, I’ll give it a try.”\n\nTurns out things on DwtS are even more contrived than I figured. And Val’s not crazy about that aspect of it, either.\n\n“When someone labels you, it means they can stop thinking about you as a human being” (page 11). Val explains that he’s writing to reveal different aspects of himself and others and to show the patriotism of a grateful immigrant. He hopes to be inspirational, or at least entertaining. He believes in being encouraging to others, as he was given encouragement and opportunities throughout his life.\n\nThere’s not enough of some things and a little too much of others. Val’s over-the-top but big-hearted. His unique voice definitely comes through. He’s funny. And he achieves his goal of showing that people have many aspects and of being entertaining at times. Some of the stuff about competition was lost on me. He says he believes personal growth (whether his own or his dance partner’s) is more important than winning a competition, he likes to win, too. The humble brag can get a bit old.\n\nAnyone hoping for any really juicy gossip or nasty comments about celebrities won’t find it here. Val keeps it positive and doesn’t get into graphic details, which is absolutely fine with me.\n\nOverall, I liked it enough that, if he does write another book--as he says he’d like to--I’d be up for checking it out.\n\nApril 29, 2018\n\nI have such mixed feelings about this book. I am a fan of DWTS and pro dancer Val. It was interesting learning about his early life, and I admire him for how he has survived through so much at such a young age. I enjoyed the light and fluffy parts where he discussed his time on DWTS. I appreciated how he divided up his book going back and forth between growing up and DWTS/ current things. However, things became out of order and took a few pages to catch back up. I thought that the foul language was unnecessary at times and distracted from his story. I know this is how he grew up and who he was —BUT there were times where the foul language seemed forced and like I said earlier, unnecessary. There were times he came off arrogant and brash - other times he was genuinely humble and loving. There were a few times where his description of some of his earlier partners was bordering on distasteful. But the majority of the time, he showed the utmost respect for his partners. Again, mixed feelings.\n\nOverall, a good book: slow at some points, but learned more about Val and the incredible things he is doing.\n\nAugust 19, 2018\n\nBook rating: 3.5 stars\n\nI won the ARC version of this book through goodreads giveaways.\n\nI was looking through a list of all good reads giveaways and saw this title. There was no book cover photo. From the blurb, I assumed it was a fictional immigrants story. I was excited when I found out that I had won a copy because the book sounded like it had a good premise. Imagine my shock when I saw Val’s picture on the book! I am a casual GWTS fan and was excited that I had won the book. In the beginning he writes about how his parents discussed about immigrating to America. He talks about how difficult it was to get traveling papers and such. He goes on in a linearly style, talking about comming to America, meeting and living with family who lives in America and that he and his brother Maks each being gifted something they were surprised and excited to be given. I enjoyed the story and sympathized with Val and Maks when they were unwelcome by other kids in their neighborhood. The story about how Val and Maks became dancers and how their parents became owners of a dance studio was very interesting. Val gives an expert understanding of why Maks is so hard on the celebrity dancers. It has nothing to do with dislike or anything else I thought. Honestly until he worked with Kirstie Alley, I thought he was a smug and arrogant jerk. He really worked with her and I saw a teacher trying to really help his student. Van gives the reader a greater understanding of why his brother teaches the way he does. I do still consider him a little arrogant, but now I understand why he is that way. I enjoyed learning about them and their parents. Some of the stories were very interesting.\n\nOverall I liked the book but I just couldn’t finish it. I stopped about half way through. There were some problems I had with it. Mainly, I am someone who prefers to read a book that is in the progression from beginning to end. This book jumps all around going backwards and fowards. In the beginning there is a linear progression but than the book changes from someone writing to someone talking. It goes from deciding to go to America to being immigrants to Maks getting a call from GWTS to him working on DWTS back to when they were teens than back when they first immigrated and than to when he was writing the book. Annother problem I had was because the book went from event to event and time to time I was often confused as to what year the event he was talking about was taking place. The book is written as more of a long conversation/monologue rather than in a normal written format. It may be better to use audible rather than to read it.\n\nMy cleaning lady found the book while doing her job and asked me about it. I gave it to her after I stopped reading it. She was very happy. I did ask her if she would post a review on Amazon, hopefully she will enjoy it more than I did and leave a good review. If I were to recommend this book to someone, I would suggest they use audible as they may enjoy Val reading his book more than trying to read it themselves. I applaud Val for not using a ghost writer. He did a good job for someone who has never written anything before.\n\n*EDIT*\n\nI gave the book to a friend of my parents who saw the book on my coffee table. She asked me a lot of questions and I could tell she was intrested in the book. I gave it to her as I just couldn't finish it. She returned it two weeks later. She told me that she couldn't finish because of the same problem I had. The book goes from the past, to the future and back again which is very confusing to read. It is now sitting on my burow. My brother vacations at a time share. The time share has a lending libary. Next time he goes, I will ask him to add this book to their shelves. My hope is that someone who can read the whole book finds it and enjoys it. I also hope for Val that if there is a person like that, they review it and pass the book on.\n\nApril 15, 2022\n\nPart immigrant biography, part dancer memoir, I'll Never Change My Name is a no-holds-barred look at Val's life, from his early childhood in Ukraine to be becoming a world champion ballroom dancer and Hollywood celebrity. Val's conversational writing style combines the colorful language he learned growing up in Brooklyn with beautiful insights and famous quotes from classic poetry and literature, and overall it feels as if he's telling stories to a close friend.\n\nThe biography itself is broken into chunks that are purposefully interspersed with stories from Dancing with the Stars, making it feel disjointed at times, and as if the reader or listener would need the thread of Dancing with the Stars to run throughout in order to make the story more interesting. At times, it can make it feel as though the story is about Dancing with the Stars and not about Val, himself. That is, until you hear the beautiful way that he speaks about creating a new dance, and how each season of the show, and each of his new partners, and all of those experiences, affected him and his life.\n\nJune 17, 2023\n\nI've had this book on my to-read list for years, but my local libraries only had print copies, which I checked out many times, but was never able to get around to reading. Then, I noticed the audiobook was on Hoopla. The book is read by the author in a very conversational tone that makes you feel like you are chatting with him over a cup of coffee as he recounts his journey in the world of competitive and then professional dancing.\n\nThe story alternates between telling of how his family immegrated from Russia/Ukraine when he was a child and went to build a dance studio business in which both of their sons became top-ranked competitive dancers and behind the scene details about Dancing with the Star and his various partners. This structure works well, It prevents it from just being a laundry list of juicy details about his various partners. If the book were purely chronological, I think people would skip ahead to the celebrity gossip and miss out on the backstory of how Val and his brother earned their roles on Dancing with the Stars.\n\nJanuary 14, 2018\n\nI won an ARC of this book through Goodreads Giveaways. While not a diehard DWTS fan, I am a casual viewer, so I know of and admire Val and Maks. I loved the parts that dealt with Val growing up in Ukraine and immigrating to the US with his family when he was still very young, then having to navigate Brooklyn and the international competitive dance world as a kid and teenager, before ultimately landing his first gig on DWTS. The writing felt very open and honest, inviting the reader in, rather than keeping them at arms length.\n\nThe DWTS parts felt a bit chaotic in the way they were presented, jumping around in time. It made keeping track of the chronology a bit difficult, but nonetheless, it was fun and insightful reading about the unique connections with each different dance partner.\n\nI'd recommend this if you are a fan of DWTS, memoirs, or just looking for an uplifting and inspiring story.\n\nJuly 11, 2022\n\nI read this book on 2020, on the way back from New York to Jakarta, my hometown on the plane. As I deep dive into Val's life before becoming a professional dancer like now I see on youtube, instagram, television... he was just a boy from Ukraine that has a big dream.\n\nI love the foreword written by his elder brother, Maksim Chmerkovskiy (I hope I still can write their surname right. Teehee-). Sometimes, I understand his struggle before being famous, travel around the world with such a sophisticated yet cool surname itself, hard to pronounce by others. I knew it. But, this book turned out to be heartwarming because made myself realize... how to feel being blessed and always being grateful with the family you have right now.\n\nAlso, I saw a pride being Ukrainian-American in this book. So proud of you, Valentin Chmerkovskiy. I'm happy now you get to marry such a beautiful woman like Jenna.\n\nxoxo\n\nMarch 20, 2018\n\nI'll Never Change My Name: An Immigrant’s American Dream from Ukraine to the USA to Dancing With the Stars by Valentin Chmerkovskiy is his story. Valentin Chmerkovskiy shares the hard with the good of his life. He and his family show that you have to work hard but The American Dream is still attainable. The stories from his childhood thru his time with Dancing With The Stars gives a glimpse into how close his family is and his hard work to achieve his goal. It is a first person account of history which in reality is everyday life written down. Valentin Chmerkovskiy explains and shows why he is proud of where he came from and why he is happy to be in America. this book is well written and a great addition to the genre of bibliographies.\n\nI received a copy thru a Goodreads Giveaway.\n\nMarch 29, 2018\n\nDancing with the Stars is one of my guilty pleasures. I love to dance, have taken ballroom dancing and have recently went to the DwtS Tour. The day after the performance, I was in B&N and saw this. Since it's an autobiography and that's the PBT tag this month, I decided to read it. Val (and his big brother Maks) grew up in Odessa (Ukraine) and due to their jewish ancestry were able to immigrate to US with their parents. The book covers all aspects of his life so far (he is in his early 30s).\n\nThis was an interesting read. Val is quite the character - he is a really talented guy and he is a very family oriented guy. He is pretty arrogant and definitely an alpha male (he calls himself that) -- these aspects of his character was a little off-putting sometimes. The love and gratitude he has for his parents, brother and the US are evident on every page. His toast at his brother's wedding brought a tear to my eye. Overall, if you are a fan of the show (and him), you might want to pick this up. He doesn't really dish a lot of dirt about his co-stars or celebrities but he does talk about how the show has changed him and how he hopes that it impacts the celebrities that he is paired with.\n\nFebruary 6, 2019\n\nProbably the first nonfiction book I've voluntarily read and wow. Such an eye-opening read. Things I never knew about the Chmerkovskiy brothers, about how they got their start on DWTS. Their struggle to become American, to make something of themselves but not lose who they were in the process. I love how close they were and are, how much Val loves dance . . .\n\nAnd to be able to read about America from the perspective of an immigrant family, to see what we take for granted or don't see at all but he saw as, well, as he said in the book: \"freedom.\"\n\nReading about his experiences with his celebrity partners was surreal, almost, seeing how he interacted with each of them, how he learned from them as much as they learned from him . . . I was moved to tears several times during this book.\n\nDefinitely recommend this."
