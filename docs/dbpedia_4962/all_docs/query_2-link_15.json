        "text": "Actress Josie Davis stars in director Drew Water's hilarious Christmas comedy, Festival of Trees, out this holiday season.Also set to release this year is her role as evil government astrophysicist, Dr Barboux, opposite James Remar, in the comedy Glowzies in which she and Remar were nominated at the Houston Film Festival. The movie premiered at the respected Sitges Film Festival, in Spain. She also has a watchable podcast on You Tube and can be heard on Apple, Spotify etc but you can watch clips from it on her Instagram page - @JosieDavis. Updates for her career are also found there.\n\nA Hollywood, California native, Josie Davis began her career at the age of three years old. She starred in numerous television commercials, and as just a child, she was cast as a series regular, on the hit television show, Charles In Charge, rated number-one in syndication. Josie received three nominations for her performance on the series and also won the respected Youth In Film Award for her role as the adorable, shy and bookish, Sarah Powell.\n\nJosie was the youngest student to study with respected acting teacher from Brooklyn, Paul E Richards, for twenty years until his passing. He had been referred to as Lee Strasberg's \"right hand man.\"\n\nAt the age of twenty four, Davis auditioned in front of Hollywood heavyweights, Martin Landau, Mark Rydell, Shelley Winters, and Barbara Bain. After only one audition Davis was accepted into the legendary Actors Studio as a \"Member with working privileges\", then was made a Lifetime Member after only one callback. Over one thousand actors auditioned, making Davis only one of two actors to be accepted that year.\n\nAfter wanting to focus on film, Academy Award winning director Mark Rydell told Josie even though she wanted to be thought of as a film actor she should be proud to be a new series regular on the last season of the iconic television series, Beverly Hills 90210. After the series ended, legendary Aaron Spelling cast Josie again as a series regular on his next show for NBC called, Titans, until it's final run.\n\nJosie 's additional series credits include: a recurring role on CSI: NY with Gary Sinese, the fan favorite Christmas episode of Two and a Half Men that USA Today called \"A must see\". Comedy King, Chuck Lorre and the ex President of Warner Brothers, Peter Roth, told Davis she should've been nominated for an emmy as Sandy, the multiple personality cook. Lorre said, \"I couldn't imagine anyone else playing that part\". Davis' other television credits include: CSI: Miami, Hawaii Five-O, NCIS, Rules of Engagment with David Spade, The Mentalist, and the list goes on and on. Josie was cast opposite Ed O'Neil and Jennifer Love Hewitt in the television comedy, In the Game, playing a diva sports reporter which guest starred Tom Brady, for ABC.\n\nIn 2011, Martin Landau and Mark Rydell cast Josie in the stage production out of The Actors Studio - David Mamet's Speed the Plow where her performance extremely well-received.\n\nJosie took a break from television to focus on films. First up was Wizardream, playing the British Evil Queen, opposite Malcolm Mc Dowell. Nicolas Cage cast Josie in his directorial debut, Sonny, opposite James Franco with the late Harry Dean Stanton. Josie has played the lead in numerous independent films as well as Lifetime movies, which earned her Lifetime Movie Network's Lifetime Achievement award as well as one for her lead role in Backstabbed, both voted entirely by Lifetime fans.\n\nJosie is writing her Memoir, which will take years to complete. She is involved in a variety of animal charities, but has especially loved her anonymous volunteer work at the South Los Angeles Animal Shelter where she adopted her two cats\n\nJim Carrey, Canadian-born and a U.S. citizen since 2004, is an actor and producer famous for his rubbery body movements and flexible facial expressions. The two-time Golden Globe-winner rose to fame as a cast member of the Fox sketch comedy In Living Color (1990) but leading roles in Ace Ventura - Ein tierischer Detektiv (1994), Dumm und Dümmer (1994) and Die Maske (1994) established him as a bankable comedy actor.\n\nJames Eugene Carrey was born on January 17, 1962 in Newmarket, Ontario, Canada, and is the youngest of four children of Kathleen (Oram), a homemaker, and Percy Carrey, an accountant and jazz musician. The family surname was originally \"Carré\", and he has French-Canadian, Scottish, and Irish ancestry. Carrey was an incurable extrovert from day one. As a child, he performed constantly, for anyone who would watch, and even mailed his résumé to The Carol Burnett Show (1967) at age 10. In junior high, he was granted a few precious minutes at the end of each school day to do stand-up routines for his classmates (provided, of course, that he kept a lid on it the rest of the day).\n\nCarrey's early adolescence took a turn for the tragic, however, when the family was forced to relocate from their cozy town of Newmarket to Scarborough (a Toronto suburb). They all took security and janitorial jobs in the Titan Wheels factory, Jim working 8-hour shifts after school let out (not surprisingly, his grades and morale both suffered). When they finally deserted the factory, the family lived out of a Volkswagen camper van until they could return to Toronto.\n\nCarrey made his stand-up debut in Toronto after his parents and siblings got back on their feet. He made his (reportedly awful) professional stand-up debut at Yuk-Yuk's, one of the many local clubs that would serve as his training ground in the years to come. He dropped out of high school, worked on his celebrity impersonations (among them Michael Landon and James Stewart), and in 1979 worked up the nerve to move to Los Angeles. He finessed his way into a regular gig at The Comedy Store, where he impressed Rodney Dangerfield so much that the veteran comic signed him as an opening act for an entire season. During this period Carrey met and married waitress Melissa Womer, with whom he had a daughter (Jane). The couple would later go through a very messy divorce, freeing Carrey up for a brief second marriage to actress Lauren Holly. Wary of falling into the lounge act lifestyle, Carrey began to look around for other performance outlets. He landed a part as a novice cartoonist in the short-lived sitcom Die Entenfabrik (1984); while the show fell flat, the experience gave Carrey the confidence to pursue acting more vigorously.\n\nCarrey also worked on breaking into film around this time. He scored the male lead in the ill-received Lauren Hutton vehicle Einmal beißen bitte (1985), and had a supporting role in Peggy Sue hat geheiratet (1986), before making a modest splash with his appearance as the alien Wiploc in Mein Liebhaber vom andern Stern (1988). Impressed with Carrey's lunacy, fellow extraterrestrial Damon Wayans made a call to his brother, Keenen Ivory Wayans, who was in the process of putting together the sketch comedy show In Living Color (1990). Carrey joined the cast and quickly made a name for himself with outrageous acts (one of his most popular characters, psychotic Fire Marshall Bill, was attacked by watchdog groups for dispensing ill- advised safety tips).\n\nFollowing his time on In Living Color (1990), Carrey's transformation from TV goofball to marquee headliner happened within the course of a single year. He opened 1994 with a starring turn in Ace Ventura - Ein tierischer Detektiv (1994), a film that cashed in on his extremely physical brand of humor (the character's trademark was talking out his derrière). Next up was the manic superhero movie Die Maske (1994), which had audiences wondering just how far Carrey's features could stretch.\n\nFinally, in December 1994, he hit theaters as a loveable dolt in the Farrelly brothers' Dumm und Dümmer (1994) (his first multi-million dollar payday). Now a box-office staple, Carrey brought his manic antics onto the set of Batman Forever (1995), replacing Robin Williams as The Riddler. He also filmed the follow-up to his breakthrough, Ace Ventura - Jetzt wird's wild (1995), and inked a deal with Sony to star in Cable Guy - Die Nervensäge (1996) (replacing Chris Farley) for a cool $20 million--at the time, that was the biggest up-front sum that had been offered to any comic actor. The movie turned out to be a disappointment, both critically and financially, but Carrey bounced back the next year with the energetic hit Der Dummschwätzer (1997). Worried that his comic shtick would soon wear thin, Carrey decided to change course.\n\nIn 1998, he traded in the megabucks and silly grins to star in Peter Weir's Die Truman Show (1998) playing a naive salesman who discovers that his entire life is the subject of a TV show, Carrey demonstrated an uncharacteristic sincerity that took moviegoers by surprise. He won a Golden Globe for the performance, and fans anticipated an Oscar nomination as well--when it didn't materialize, Carrey lashed out at Academy members for their narrow-minded selection process. Perhaps inspired by the snub, Carrey threw himself into his next role with abandon. After edging out a handful of other hopefuls (including Edward Norton) to play eccentric funnyman Andy Kaufman in Der Mondmann (1999), Carrey disappeared into the role, living as Kaufman -- and his blustery alter-ego Tony Clifton -- for months (Carrey even owned Kaufman's bongo drums, which he'd used during his audition for director Milos Forman). His sometimes uncanny impersonation was rewarded with another Golden Globe, but once again the Academy kept quiet.\n\nAn indignant Carrey next reprised his bankable mania for the Farrelly brothers in Ich, beide & sie (2000), playing a state trooper whose Jekyll and Hyde personalities both fall in love with the same woman (Renée Zellweger). Carrey's real-life persona wound up falling for her too--a few months after the film wrapped, the pair announced they were officially a couple. By then, Carrey had already slipped into a furry green suit to play the stingy antihero of Ron Howard's Der Grinch (2000).\n\nAlthough Carrey maintains a foothold in the comedy world with films such as Bruce Allmächtig (2003) and Mr. Poppers Pinguine (2011), he is also capable of turning in nuanced dramatic performances, as demonstrated in films like Vergiss mein nicht (2004) and the drama/comedy Der Ja-Sager (2008). In 2013, he costars with Steve Carell in Der unglaubliche Burt Wonderstone (2013).\n\nCarrey has one child with his first wife, Melissa Carrey, whom he divorced in 1995. He married actress Lauren Holly in 1996, but they split less than a year later."
