        "text": "If you are more than a few decades old, the invasion of Ukraine was horrific but familiar. It was what TV had taught you to expect since childhood.\n\nThere was the buildup of tensions over a supposed “military exercise,” the scenario that opened “The Day After” in 1983. There were the columns of tanks, an image out of the invasion of Czechoslovakia, Soviet newsreels and the 1984 movie “Red Dawn.” There were the maps of Europe, with arrows diagraming pincer attacks and fire-red explosion graphics.\n\nThere was the American president pledging that this aggression would not stand. There was his glowering Russian counterpart proclaiming his country’s destiny and threatening woe to any who interfered. There was the live video from the United Nations, as desperate diplomats flung mere words, no competition for the detonations on the other side of the split screen.\n\nThis was the worst kind of nostalgia programming. This was the background chatter in the first act of a Very Special TV Movie, just before the whistle overhead and the blinding flash in the distance.\n\nAt the same time, especially if you grew up with Cold War TV specials and bomb drills, this was also nothing that you had expected to see. Some of the differences were technological — smartphone video, discussions of cyber warfare.\n\nBut above all, you would not expect to see programs on an American news channel, if not taking the side of the Russian aggressor, at least giving a platform to its excusers and sophists.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
