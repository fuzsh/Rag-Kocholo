        "text": "Another season of Dancing with the Stars is around the corner, and this week, the cast of 13 “stars” was revealed. To be honest, a handful of these wannabe dancers are so generic and fit into pre-existing DWTS roles that I thought they were already on the show before. Or Marilu Henner was just destined for this show.\n\nA couple seasons ago, I broke down the usual suspects when it comes to casting DWTS, since every star can usually fit into a pre-existing category. I’ve done it again for this season and also determined who actually has a shot of winning the coveted MIRROR BALL TROPHY (it’s worth noting I correctly guessed two of the final three from S21, so I’m pretty much an expert on this kayyyy?).\n\n*denotes winner of season\n\nSeason 23 Contestant: Maureen McCormick {Actress}\n\nFilling the Quota: Actress That Was Somewhat Relevant At Some Point In Their Career\n\nPreceded by: Tia Carrere and Tatum O’Neal (S2), Jennie Garth (S5), Shannon Elizabeth (S6), Shannen Doherty (S7), Denise Richards (S8), Melissa Joan Hart (S9), Pamela Anderson (S10 & 15), Ricki Lake (S13), Melissa Gilbert (S14), Elizabeth Berkley Lauren (S17), Danica McKellar (S18)\n\nUsually Partnered With: Tony Dovolani, Artem Chigvintsev\n\nNotes: I have a feeling Maureen will at least make it through the halfway point. She’s got the nostalgia factor going for her, and she’s probably got some moves she’s been hiding since Sunshine Day? Also, I predict she will say something along the lines of this in the first episode: “Hi, I’m Maureen McCormick and I’m an actress. You probably know me best as Marcia on The Brady Bunch… I have asked my TV mom Florence Henderson for some pointers, and she just told me to be confident, and most importantly have fun!”\n\nSeason 23 Contestant: Marilu Henner {Actress}\n\nFilling the Quota: Older Actress/TV Personality\n\nPreceded by: Paula Deen (S21), Suzanne Somers (S20), Betsey Johnson and Lea Thompson (S19), Valerie Harper (S17), Ricki Lake (S13), Kirstie Alley (S12), Florence Henderson (S11), Cloris Leachman (S7)\n\nUsually Partnered With: Tony Dovolani, Artem Chigvintsev\n\nNotes: Marilu and Maureen are basically filling the same role, except Marilu lucked out with Derek Hough. Because of this alone, she has a good shot of staying in the game longer than Maureen.\n\nSeason 23 Contestant: Jake T. Austin {Actor}\n\nFilling the Quota: Younger actor/singer\n\nPreceded by: Carlos PenaVega (S21), Riker Lynch (S20), James Maslow (S18), Brant Daugherty (S17), Roshon Fegan and William Levy (S14), Romeo Miller (S12), Kyle Massey (S11), Cody Linley (S7)\n\nUsually Partnered With: Alison Holker, Witney Carson, Jenna Johnson\n\nNotes: Usually this person is the underdog, surprisingly good and consistent throughout the show, a force to be reckoned with towards the end. I can definitely see Jake doing this, and he’ll have a good story to tell too: former Disney star who got into some trouble with the law (DUI) a few years ago? Golden. Too bad there’s another cast member who has a better redemption story.\n\nSeason 23 Contestant: Kenneth ‘Babyface’ Edmonds {Singer/Songwriter/Producer}\n\nFilling the Quota: Rando singer/musician\n\nPreceded by: Andy Grammer (S21), Redfoo (S20), Gavin DeGraw (S14), Master P (S2), Billy Ray Cyrus (S4), Chuck Wicks (S8), Donny Osmond* (S9), Michael Bolton (S11).\n\nUsually Partnered With: Allison Holker, Sharna Burgess, Emma Slater\n\nNotes: You’d think musicians would have good rhythm as dancers, but most of the time, it just means their rhythm is better suited off the dance floor. Babyface will probably hang on past the mid-season mark.\n\nSeason 23 Contestant: Calvin Johnson {NFL Star}\n\nFilling the Quota: Athlete\n\nPreceded by: Michael Sam (S20), Michael Waltrip (S19), Keyshawn Johnson (S17), Jacoby Jones and Victor Oritz (S16), Donald Driver (S14)*, Metta World Peace (S13), Sugar Ray Leonard and Hines Ward (S12)*, Rick Fox (S11), Chad Ochocinco (S10), Warren Sapp (S7), Helio Castroneves* (S5), Apolo Anton Ohno (S4), Emmitt Smith (S3)*\n\nUsually Partnered With: Witney Carson, Karina Smirnoff, Cheryl Burke, Lindsay Arnold\n\nNotes: I honestly have no idea who this is, but NFL stars usually excel when it comes to DWTS.\n\nSeason 23 Contestant: Vanilla Ice {Rapper}\n\nFilling the Quota: Rando singer/musician\n\nPreceded by: Redfoo (S20), Gavin DeGraw (S14), Master P (S2), Billy Ray Cyrus (S4), Chuck Wicks (S8), Donny Osmond* (S9), Michael Bolton (S11).\n\nUsually Partnered With: Allison Holker, Sharna Burgess, Emma Slater\n\nNotes: Unlike Babyface, Ice actually dances when he performs, so he’s got a good shot here. Will he dance to Ice Ice Baby? 100 million percent yes. (Ed note: I swear I found that video after writing that. Dancing on Ice is a DWTS/Strictly Come Dancing spin-off in the UK. He placed 7th out of 16.)\n\nSeason 23 Contestant: Amber Rose {Model/Talk Show Host}\n\nFilling the Quota: Reality TV Star\n\nPreceded by: Kim Zolciak Biermann (S21), Lisa Vanderpump (S16), Kristin Cavallari (13), Kendra Wilkinson (S12), Audrina Patridge and Bristol Palin (S11), Kate Gosselin (S10), Joanna Krupa (S9), Holly Madison and Melissa Rycroft (S8), Kim Kardashian (S7), Trista Sutter (S1)\n\nUsually Partnered With: Tony Dovolani, Louis van Amstel, Mark Ballas\n\nNotes: I never really know what to call Amber Rose, but per her ABC bio, she’s a “proud mother, activist, entrepreneur, spokesperson, talk show host, model, actor and published author from Philadelphia, PA.” Ok then. She’ll do alright. She’ll also get in heated arguments with Maks. But muva won’t be taking home a trophy for Sebastian.\n\nSeason 23 Contestant: Terra Jole {Reality TV Star}\n\nFilling the Quota: Inspirational hero\n\nPreceded by: Alex Skarlatos (S21), Heather Mills (S4), Chaz Bono and J.R. Martinez* (S13), Amy Purdy (S18), Noah Galloway (S20)\n\nUsually Partnered With: Karina Smirnoff, Derek Hough\n\nNotes: The demographic for DWTS LOVES a good inspirational story, one that makes you cry in the video package shown before their dance every week. This contestant usually does really well.\n\nSeason 23 Contestant: Jana Kramer {Country Music Star}\n\nFilling the Quota: Rando female singer who needs to overcome adversity\n\nPreceded by: Toni Braxton (S7), Wynonna Judd (S16),\n\nUsually Partnered With: Karina Smirnoff, Derek Hough\n\nNotes: Jana fills two quotas, one as a rando female singer, but the other unfortunately because she recently separated from her husband. Who knows if she’ll discuss why she decided to do the the or if she signed up prior to her split, but she’ll grab some sympathy votes in addition to her natural talent.\n\nSeason 23 Contestant: Rick Perry {Former Governor of Texas}\n\nFilling the Quota: Older actor/Comedian/Not a chance in hell\n\nPreceded by: Gary Busey (S21), Tommy Chong (S20), Andy Dick (S16) David Hasselhoff (S11), Buzz Aldrin (S10) Tom DeLay (S9), Steve Wozniak (S8), Jeffrey Ross (S7), The Holy Trinity – Steve Guttenberg, Penn Jillette and Adam Carolla (S6), Wayne Newton (S5), Jerry Springer (S3)\n\nUsually Partnered With: Kym Johnson, Cheryl Burke, Emma Slater, Anna Trebunskaya\n\nNotes: Here’s a hint – any older male contestant whose initial promo photo features them standing and not doing any sort of dance move – they probably won’t get too far in the competition.\n\nSeason 23 Contestant: Laurie Hernandez {Olympic Gymnast}\n\nFilling the Quota: Female athlete\n\nPreceded by: Laila Ali (S4), Monica Seles and Kristi Yamaguchi* (S6), Misty May-Treanor (S7), Shawn Johnson* (S8), Natalie Coughlin (S9), Hope Solo (S13), Martina Navratilova (S14), Dorothy Hamill and Alexandra Raisman (S16), Lolo Jones (S19)\n\nUsually Partnered With: Mark Ballas, Derek Hough, Maksim Chmerkovskiy\n\nNotes: WE’RE NOT PLAYING COY, WE WANT THIS CINNAMON ROLL OF A HUMAN EMOJI TO GO ALL THE WAY AND WIN THAT MIRROR BALL TROPHY\n\nSeason 23 Contestant: James Hinchcliffe {Racecar Driver}\n\nFilling the Quota: Reality TV/Internet Person/WHO?\n\nPreceded by: Hayes Grier (S21), Mark Cuban (S5), Rocco DiSpirito (S7), Steve-O (S8), Jake Pavelka (S10), Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino (S11), Carson Kressley and Rob Kardashian (S13), Sean Lowe (S16),\n\nUsually Partnered With: Emma Slater, Peta Murgatroyd, Karina Smirnoff\n\nNotes: Although this person has plenty of fans, the contestant has a lot of work to do in the dance studio. He gets frustrated often and knows how to be dramatic in front of a camera.

He wouldn’t be the first star to help fix their reputation – remember racist Paula Deen? She made it to 9th place and bested four other contestants!\n\nOther Random Quotas Not Filled This Season:\n\nFemale Models: Rachel Hunter (S1), Shanna Moakler (S3), Kathy Ireland (S9), Petra Němcová and Elisabetta Canalis (S13), Charlotte McKinney (S20)\n\nMiddle-Aged Actor That Were Somewhat Relevant At Some Point In Their Career: John O’Hurley (S1), Joey Lawrence and Mario Lopez (S3), Ian Ziering (S4), Ralph Macchio (s12)\n\nYounger Actress: Alexa PenaVega (S21), Rumer Willis (S20)*, Janel Parrish (S19), Chelsea Kane (S12), Sabrina Bryan (S5), Monique Coleman (S3), Kelly Monaco* (S1)\n\nMost likely to be on cover of CosmoGirl or Teen People: Willow Shields (S20), Sadie Robertson (S19) Bethany Mota (S19), Zendaya (S16)\n\nBBW: Patti LaBelle (S20), NeNe Leakes (S18), Amber Riley (S17)*, Sherri Shepherd (S14), Gladys Knight (S14), Wendy Williams (S12), Niecy Nash (S10)\n\nPop star and-or actor/has plenty of dance experience/ringer: Nick Carter (S21), Alfonso Ribeiro (S19)*, Corbin Bleu (S17), Aaron Carter (S9), Lance Bass (S7), Mario (S6), Joey Fatone (S4), Drew Lachey (S2)*, Joey McIntyre (S1)\n\nSeason 21 Predictions: Final Three – Laurie Hernandez, Jana Kramer, and Jake T.

This year, I had no choice, since my boy Nick Carter signed up for the show. (BTW my first reaction upon hearing he was cast was ‘Oh no. Nickolas. What are you doing.’ It changed to, ‘I guess I’ll be voting this season?). Of course this isn’t the first time a pop star or even boy bander has joined the competition, and it got me thinking – over the course of 21 seasons, the casting department and producers of DWTS, especially over the past few years, have made it a mission to fulfill certain “stereotypes” when it comes to the contestants on the show. Nick isn’t the first pop singer to join the program, and he’s certainly not the last.\n\nLet’s delve into the certain characters and qualities that appear on the show every year – and determine who actually has a shot of winning the coveted MIRROR BALL TROPHY.\n\n*denotes winner of season\n\nSeason 21 Contestant: Nick Carter {Backstreet Boys}\n\nFilling the Quota: Pop star and-or actor/has plenty of dance experience/ringer\n\nPreceded by: Alfonso Ribeiro (S19)*, Corbin Bleu (S17), Aaron Carter (S9), Lance Bass (S7), Mario (S6), Joey Fatone (S4), Drew Lachey (S2)*, Joey McIntyre (S1)\n\nUsually Partnered With: Sharna Burgess, Alison Holker, Cheryl Burke\n\nNotes: This contestant usually comes in having an impressive background in dance, but not necessarily with ballroom, making them meet high expectations on the dance floor. They’ve also got a sufficient fan base that will vote for them, no matter what.\n\nSeason 21 Contestant: Chaka Kahn {Soul Singer}\n\nFilling the Quota: BBW\n\nPreceded by: Patti LaBelle (S20), NeNe Leakes (S18), Amber Riley (S17)*, Sherri Shepherd (S14), Gladys Knight (S14), Wendy Williams (S12), Niecy Nash (S10)\n\nUsually Partnered With: Tony Dovolani, Artem Chigvintsev\n\nNotes: This contestant usually makes it fairly far (not eliminated the first two weeks), even though they’re not usually the best dancer, but they’re universally loved and bring personality and charisma to the show.\n\nSeason 21 Contestant: Bindi Irwin {Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin’s Daughter}\n\nFilling the Quota: Most likely to be on cover of CosmoGirl or Teen People\n\nPreceded by: Willow Shields (S20), Sadie Robertson (S19) Bethany Mota (S19), Zendaya (S16)\n\nUsually Partnered With: Mark Ballas, Derek Hough\n\nNotes: The teens are eager to learn, and quick to learn, maybe most importantly. They also make it fairly far in the competition, and it’s always a fine line between being sexy on the dance floor and remembering they’re underage.\n\nSeason 21 Contestant: Andy Grammer {Singer/Songwriter}\n\nFilling the Quota: Rando singer/musician\n\nPreceded by: Redfoo (S20), Gavin DeGraw (S14), Master P (S2), Billy Ray Cyrus (S4), Chuck Wicks (S8), Donny Osmond* (S9), Michael Bolton (S11).\n\nUsually Partnered With: Allison Holker, Sharna Burgess, Emma Slater\n\nNotes: You’d think musicians would have good rhythm as dancers, but most of the time, it just means their rhythm is better suited off the dance floor.\n\nSeason 21 Contestant: Tamar Braxton {R&B singer/Reality TV star}\n\nFilling the Quota: Rando female singer\n\nPreceded by: Willa Ford (S3), Marie Osmond and Mel B (S5), Toni Braxton (S7), Belinda Carlisle (S8), Macy Gray and Mya (S9), Nicole Scherzinger * (S10), Brandy (S11), Chynna Phillips (S13), Wynonna Judd and Kellie Pickler (S16),\n\nUsually Partnered With: Maksim Chmerkovskiy, Val Chmerkovskiy, Derek Hough\n\nNotes: Same as Rando Male Singer. Unless you’re former Pussycat Dolls star Nicole Scherzinger, who should could as a boy band ringer.\n\nSeason 21 Contestant: Victor Espinoza {Jockey/Triple Crown Winner}\n\nFilling the Quota: Athlete\n\nPreceded by: Michael Sam (S20), Michael Waltrip (S19), Keyshawn Johnson (S17), Jacoby Jones and Victor Oritz (S16), Donald Driver (S14)*, Metta World Peace (S13), Sugar Ray Leonard and Hines Ward (S12)*, Rick Fox (S11), Chad Ochocinco (S10), Warren Sapp (S7), Helio Castroneves* (S5), Apolo Anton Ohno (S4), Emmitt Smith (S3)*\n\nUsually Partnered With: Witney Carson, Karina Smirnoff, Cheryl Burke\n\nNotes: Unless they’re an NFL star, they have no chance of winning.\n\nSeason 21 Contestant: Hayes Grier {Vine Personality}\n\nFilling the Quota: Reality TV/Internet Person/WHO?\n\nPreceded by: Mark Cuban (S5), Rocco DiSpirito (S7), Steve-O (S8), Jake Pavelka (S10), Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino (S11), Carson Kressley and Rob Kardashian (S13), Sean Lowe (S16),\n\nUsually Partnered With: Emma Slater, Peta Murgatroyd, Karina Smirnoff\n\nNotes: Although this person has plenty of fans, the contestant has a lot of work to do in the dance studio. He gets frustrated often and knows how to be dramatic in front of a camera.\n\nSeason 21 Contestant: Alexa Penavega {Actress}\n\nFilling the Quota: Younger actress\n\nPreceded by: Rumer Willis (S20)*, Janel Parrish (S19), Chelsea Kane (S12), Sabrina Bryan (S5), Monique Coleman (S3), Kelly Monaco* (S1)\n\nUsually Partnered With: Val Chmerkovskiy, Mark Ballas, Artem Chigvintsev\n\nNotes: Is the underdog, surprisingly good and consistent throughout the show, a force to be reckoned with towards the end.\n\nSeason 21 Contestant: Carlos Penavega {Actor/Singer}\n\nFilling the Quota: Younger actor/singer\n\nPreceded by: Riker Lynch (S20), James Maslow (S18), Brant Daugherty (S17), Roshon Fegan and William Levy (S14), Romeo Miller (S12), Kyle Massey (S11), Cody Linley (S7)\n\nUsually Partnered With: Alison Holker, Witney Carson\n\nNotes: Is the underdog, surprisingly good and consistent throughout the show, a force to be reckoned with towards the end.\n\nSeason 21 Contestant: Gary Busey {Actor/This Guy}\n\nFilling the Quota: Older actor/Comedian/Not a chance in hell\n\nPreceded by: Tommy Chong (S20), Andy Dick (S16) David Hasselhoff (S11), Buzz Aldrin (S10) Tom DeLay (S9), Steve Wozniak (S8), Jeffrey Ross (S7), The Holy Trinity – Steve Guttenberg, Penn Jillette and Adam Carolla (S6), Wayne Newton (S5), Jerry Springer (S3)\n\nUsually Partnered With: Kym Johnson, Cheryl Burke, Emma Slater, Anna Trebunskaya\n\nNotes: Just. No.\n\nSeason 21 Contestant: Paula Deen {Former Food Network Star/This Guy}\n\nFilling the Quota: Older Actress/TV Personality\n\nPreceded by: Suzanne Somers (S20), Betsey Johnson and Lea Thompson (S19), Valerie Harper (S17), Ricki Lake (S13), Kirstie Alley (S12), Florence Henderson (S11), Cloris Leachman (S7)\n\nUsually Partnered With: Tony Dovolani, Artem Chigvintsev\n\nNotes: Depending on the star herself, they could either fail (Cloris) or do really well (Kirstie).\n\nSeason 21 Contestant: Kim Zolciak Biermann {The Real Housewives of Atlanta}\n\nFilling the Quota: Reality TV Star\n\nPreceded by: Lisa Vanderpump (S16), Kristin Cavallari (13), Kendra Wilkinson (S12), Audrina Patridge and Bristol Palin (S11), Kate Gosselin (S10), Joanna Krupa (S9), Holly Madison and Melissa Rycroft (S8), Kim Kardashian (S7), Trista Sutter (S1)\n\nUsually Partnered With: Tony Dovolani, Louis van Amstel, Mark Ballas\n\nNotes: Because this is a REALITY competition show, after all.\n\nSeason 21 Contestant: National Guardsman Alex Skarlatos {one of the Americans who helped stop a gunman on a Paris-bound train}\n\nFilling the Quota: Inspirational hero\n\nPreceded by: Heather Mills (S4), Chaz Bono and J.R. Martinez* (S13), Amy Purdy (S18), Noah Galloway (S20)\n\nUsually Partnered With: Karina Smirnoff, Derek Hough\n\nNotes: The demographic for DWTS LOVES a good inspirational story, one that makes you cry in the video package shown before their dance every week. This contestant usually does really well.\n\nOther Random Quotas Not Filled This Season:\n\nFemale Athletes: Laila Ali (S4) ,Monica Seles and Kristi Yamaguchi* (S6), Misty May-Treanor (S7), Shawn Johnson* (S8), Natalie Coughlin (S9), Hope Solo (S13), Martina Navratilova (S14), Dorothy Hamill and Alexandra Raisman (S16), Lolo Jones (S19)\n\nFemale Models: Rachel Hunter (S1), Shanna Moakler (S3), Kathy Ireland (S9), Petra Němcová and Elisabetta Canalis (S13), Charlotte McKinney (S20)\n\nMiddle-Aged Actress That Were Somewhat Relevant At Some Point In Their Career: Tia Carrere and Tatum O’Neal (S2), Jennie Garth (S5), Shannon Elizabeth (S6), Shannen Doherty (S7), Denise Richards (S8), Melissa Joan Hart (S9), Pamela Anderson (S10 & 15), Ricki Lake (S13), Melissa Gilbert (S14), Elizabeth Berkley Lauren (S17), Danica McKellar (S18)\n\nMiddle-Aged Actor That Were Somewhat Relevant At Some Point In Their Career: John O’Hurley (S1), Joey Lawrence and Mario Lopez (S3), Ian Ziering (S4), Ralph Macchio (s12),\n\nSeason 21 Predictions: Final Three – Nick Carter, Bindi Irwin and Carlos Penavega\n\nRelated articles\n\nDefinitive Ranking of Dancing with the Stars Season 18 Contestants\n\nLast Minute Pop Culture Inspired Halloween Costumes\n\nGoodbye, Sochi: Olympics GIF Wrap Up\n\nThe Jennifer Lawrence Victory Tour\n\nPeople Under the age of 25 More Successful Than You\n\nFor those of you just tuning in to this blog, I write about celebrities for a living. I literally get paid to write news stories about celebrities, movies, music, and basically anything to do with entertainment. But prior to this position, I used to exclusively write about reality TV. My days were filled with picking sides between the Housewives, deciphering Honey Boo Boo’s ramblings, and actually Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\n\nAs you probably know, Dancing with the Stars is one of the biggest reality TV shows in America, so I was basically forced to watch it (and all the other shows for that matter). The first couple of seasons I surprisingly found myself getting really into it. Then last season I really couldn’t be bothered and lost interest completely. I’m writing this to say I will not be keeping up with it this season, but I will be writing this post because this year’s crop of ‘celebrities’ is worth talking about (and possibly throwing shade at). Here are the 12 celebrities and their pro partners that will be taking the dance floor starting March 17th, and here is the official completely unofficial ranking of how they’ll fare as ballroom hoofers, from worst to best, last to first.\n\nUPDATE: JUST FOUND OUT THE PARTNERS MIGHT SWITCH PER AUDIENCE VOTE, SO THIS ENTIRE LIST MIGHT BE INVALID. WHATEVER. DEREK HOUGH PROBS GONNA WIN AGAIN ANYWAYS.\n\nBilly Dee Williams (Actor) with Emma Slater\n\nDiana Nyad (Long-Distance Swimmer) with Henry Byalikov\n\nSean Avery (Former NHL player) with Karina Smirnoff\n\nNeNe Leakes (Housewife/Actress) with Tony Dovolani\n\nDrew Carey (Actor/The Price Is Right Host) with Cheryl Burke\n\nCody Simpson (Singer) with Witney Carson\n\nJames Maslow (Singer/Actor in Big Time Rush) with Peta Murgatroyd\n\nCandace Cameron-Bure (Actress/DJ) with Mark Ballas\n\nDanica McKellar (Actress/Mathematician) with Val Chmerkovskiy\n\nCharlie White (Gold Medalist in Ice Dancing) with Sharna Burgess\n\nMeryl Davis (Gold Medalist in Ice Dancing) with Maksim Chmerkovskiy\n\nAmy Purdy (Paraolympic Snowboarder and actress) with Derek Hough\n\nRelated articles\n\nBest of: So You Think You Can Dance Auditions\n\nPoint/Counterpoint: Televised Weddings – Gauche or Glorious?\n\nIt’s Been a Bad Week for Jessica Spano\n\nAs you may (or may not) know, Elizabeth Berkley is one of the cast members of this season’s Dancing with the Stars.\n\nThat is until she unexpectedly got kicked off the show on Monday. Oops. Sorry. “Spoiler Alert”.\n\nElizabeth has been a frontrunner the entire season, getting TWO perfect scores. And her cumulative score from the judges lands her at third place, so theoretically, this means she should have an easy entry into the semi-finals and even the finals, but because America gets to weigh in, this wasn’t the case. Looks like Elizabeth’s SBTB and Showgirls fans didn’t vote enough to beat out all of middle America and the southern states who are voting for Bill Engvall. Like, really.\n\nMost notably this season, Elizabeth recreated her famous “I’m so excited!” scene from SBTB, and it was weird and awkward and awesome all at the same time.\n\nNote to self: never take “Jive Pills”. Or do, because it’s freaking me out how it doesn’t look like she’s changed one bit in over 20 years. IDK anymore.\n\nBut lest we forget from whence she came. Elizabeth may not be the winner of the mirrorball trophy on DWTS, but she’ll always be a winner in our hearts.\n\nThe video that made one of the best girl groups of all time\n\nIt’s worth noting that they were called ‘Hot Sundae’, not ‘Jesse and The Sundaes’. Come on.\n\nBuddy Bands: Hey, They Work.\n\nJessie, resident dancer, helps teach Zack how to dance.\n\nJessie and Zack: The couple that never was?\n\nJessie shows off her skills in ‘band’ class\n\nBonus vid: MTV2’s brilliant promo vid for SBTB.\n\nBonus vid #2: Rare interview with the kids before the show got super popular. Why do Mario and Elizabeth look exactly the same 20+ years later? Time-travelling demons.\n\nI’m a Rhoda, not a Mary. If you’re a classic tv fan, an old person, or both, you’ll remember Mary Richards and Rhoda Morgenstern as one of the sitcom world’s best buddy duos on The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Mary was sort of the straight man, and eminently sweet and lovable. Rhoda was sassy, self-deprecating, others-deprecating (is that a thing?) and had a disastrous dating life.\n\nI watched Mary Tyler Moore repeats as a kid, but it was by and large a “grown-up” show to me. See, I could watch shows about adults in my era (see: Friends), but a bunch of adults in the 70s didn’t really resonate with me. Now that I’m a young professional, The Mary Tyler Moore show is my life. Since college, my friend and I have even used “throwing our hats in the air” as a catchall expression for just generally succeeding at life.\n\nRhoda Morgenstern probably reminds you of either yourself or one of your friends (in which case you’re a Mary, and likely far more likable and bubbly than I am). When prepping for a beauty contest, Rhoda introduced herself: “My favorite hobbies are cheerleading, liking people, and living in America.” Still, Mary always had the good luck, as Rhoda informed her on a down day: “You’re having a lousy streak. I happen to be having a terrific streak. Soon the world will be back to normal. Tomorrow you will meet a crown head of Europe and marry. I will have a fat attack, eat 3000 peanut butter cups and die.” Then, there’s the voice-over from season one of Rhoda:\n\nWhomever decided that a voice-over monolog would make a good theme song was freaking crazy. It was the 70s, and everyone was just kind of trying things I guess. But still. Rhoda. I love Rhoda.\n\nOf course, there’s no Rhoda without Valerie Harper. The fact is, Harper’s pretty great in her own right. She got her start touring with Second City, and appeared on the super-60s (but still funny) comedy album When You’re In Love The Whole World Is Jewish. She ran for SAG president but lost to Melissa Gilbert, which isn’t even really fair because who could vote against Half-Pint Ingalls, except for Nellie Freaking Olsen? Harper even advocated for the ERA in the 70s, and you can tell that I have the boundless, baseless optimism of someone who was raised in Buffalo Bills territory, because every time it’s introduced I’m like “you know, maybe this is our year.” In 2006, she called Britney Spears a “Disney Hooker.” Harper also offered one of my favorite bits of life advice:\n\n“Stop working so hard at being interesting and focus on what’s outside yourself. There are universes out there that need to be explored. And, an interested person is extremely interesting.”\n\nThis fall, Valerie Harper has advanced cancer and a reality tv contract – because she’s Rhoda Morgenstern and she does what she wants. So, on Monday I voluntarily watched Dancing With The Stars even though I am not a suburban lady in my early 60s. I’ll keep watching as long as she’s on the show – and possibly longer if Bill Nye and Jessie Spano make it farther. I was a 90s kid, after all. I’m not watching because it’s amazing that Harper is responding unbelievably well to treatment, or inspiring that she’s undertaking a serious dance regimen on top of a serious illness. I’m watching because Rhoda Morgenstern was hilarious, and so is the woman who plays her. Which means that – at the very least – if a routine is really awful, or someone falls down, or the costumes are atrocious, I think we can count on her for some witty, Rhoda-like commentary.\n\n[Ed. note: This was initially written to appear this past Monday, but was postponed to write about one of our other favorite funny ladies. I don’t think Valerie Harper cares, though. Meaning: I don’t think she’s one of our readers. But, the delay allowed me to watch DWTS before posting, and Harper did not disappoint. But would it have killed them to put her in a turban? For old time’s sake, I mean.]\n\nDancing with the Stars is one of the biggest reality TV shows on the air, and naturally I have to watch it and keep up with it and write any news pertaining the show. But I always forget that the one person who is pretty much the ideal demographic fort this show is my mother. Like suburban, older, women usually like this show. Naturally, she was excited about the season finale. I just happened to be with my parents on the night of this past week’s season 16 finale, and I could only get her reactions to the last hour of the two-hour finale, but they’re still entertaining none the less. It’s like she was betting money on it or something, that’s how into it and stressed she was over the show. I mean, I tend to get emotional about telveision, but it’s so uncharacteristic from her that I was more amused than annoyed. Here are some quality quotes from the Dancing with the Stars shit show. BTW – this was mostly said in Filipino, so this is all a rough translation of what she said…\n\nDuring Pitbull’s performance: “(Judge) Len (Goodman) better be careful or he’ll break something!”\n\nThis man may be 69 years old, but he’s a ballroom champ and legit was helping finalist Jacoby Jones in practice the day before.\n\nWhen cameras panned over to the audience: “Oh it’s Kristi! Kristi’s there!” (Yamaguchi, because she’s on a first name basis with her, apparently.)\n\nWhen missing the part where the top four was narrowed down to three, and NFL pro Jacoby Jones was still in the competition: “JACKoby? JACKoby will probably win now!!” – It’s pronounced Jah-CO-bee.\n\nAnd finding out Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman placed fourth, below Jacoby: “Aly probably cried… Jacoby’s good but not as good as the women. How disappointing.”\n\nAfter Jacoby’s instant salsa: Jacoby’s mom is too much (she was holding up her own a ’10’ sign from the audience): “They’ll probably give him a 10. That is not right… That’s why he has a lot of fans- because of this touchdown dance.”\n\nOn Zendaya’s instant jive dance: “Ohhh her music is so good (It was the classic, Rockin’ Robin).”\n\nOn 16-year-old Zendaya’s footwear choices: “See, she can’t dance in heels. She should be dancing in heels. But she’s a kid… she’s not wearing heels.” (She actually wears heels 90% of the time on the show)\n\nZendaya’s video package talking about her final dance on the show: “It’s definitely going to suck” – Zendaya\n\n“HA ‘SUCKS’! SHE’S A KID!” – My old mom\n\nOn appreciating figure skate alumni in the audience: “Oh Dorothy’s there too. Dorothy and Kristi are sitting next to each other!” (the DWTS mom version of fangirling)\n\n“They need to improve the mirrorball trophy.”\n\nOn last season’s American Idol runner-up (and 1/2 Filipino), Jessica Sanchez, who performed: “Ay it’s Jessica!!! She has too much makeup on… she has on too much makeup.”\n\nStill not over Jacoby making it over Aly: “It will be so disappointing if Jacoby wins… See he has the lowest cheers.” (from the audience)\n\nAfter Jacoby was eliminated, leaving Zendaya and American Idol alum Kellie Pickler in the top two: “There – there it won’t matter who wins between the two of them… even though I like Kellie.”\n\nWhen Kellie Pickler was named the champion of DWTS: “They’re (Kellie & pro partner Derek) shocked!! It’s because of their performance from last night. Because she’s very artistic… But derek won again – how many is this that he won? She didn’t become the American Idol but she was the Dancing with the Stars champion.”"
