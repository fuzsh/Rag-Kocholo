In an amiable way of speaking, the eternal struggle between American men and American women is the passionately controversial theme of Metro's new comedy, "Dream Wife," which came to the Rivoli yesterday. But in an equally amiable way of speaking, it must be said that the theme is pursued with less passion than sportive affection, and less controversy than sweet accord.Here, in as gay a movie mix-up as the summer is likely to bring, and, indeed, in as cheerful a trifle as we're likely to see this year, Cary Grant, who has often fought the battle and now bravely wears his obvious scars, goes down in inevitable surrender to an irresistibly feminine Doborah Kerr. But he does have his momentary triumph; for the better part of the film he is left to appear as the lordly idol of a deliciously exotic Betta St. John.It is a brightly conceived little notion that Sidney Sheldon and a couple of other scribes have whipped up for this frothy amusement. And it is nicely escorted to the screen, with just the right amount of unmistakable winking, under Mr. Sheldon's directorial command.Service Before CareerBriefly, it is the story of an urbane, but plain, American male who thinks that a wife should serve her husband before she devotes herself to a career. Indeed, he feels rather strongly that women are allowed to get away with a great deal more arrogance and authority in our society than are rightly deserved.And so, when he finds that his fiancée is more concerned with business than with him, he minds himself of a young princess whom he met on a trip to the Near East. He minds himself that her powerful father has offered him her hand, and that she has been trained in the tradition of her people to think of nothing but the happiness of her man. He minds these things rather strongly, and a proposal of marriage is exchanged.Next thing you know, the princess is arriving in New York, accompanied by a retinue of servants and preceded by a shipment of dowry goats. And from here on it is a gleeful matter of juxtaposing the baffling customs of the East and the equally baffling customs of American society and commercial intrigue, stubbornly maintained by big oil interests, which are represented by the fiancé.In such a helpless situation, you can imagine the stew of Mr. Grant—that is, if you've seen him cornered by tireless females in other films. Rebellion rises in his spirit and tart sarcasm drips from his tongue, but defeat is measured in his glances. He is very amusing in this film. And so, too, in contrary fashion, is the cool and elegant Miss Kerr. She is most amusing as the by-passed fiancée when she serves as interpreter for the princess and Mr. Grant.Less comical but no less charming is the newly recruited Miss St. John, who was wooed from the stage and "South Pacific," in which she played the original "Younger Than Springtime" girl. And Walter Pidgeon, as a straight-faced oil executive; Eduard Franz, as the father of the intended bride, and Buddy Baer, as the latter's ruthless guardian, contribute much to the fun.On the large screen at the Rivoli, the light conceits may loom fearsomely at times and the pace may drag slightly in some places. But, for the most part, "Dream Wife" is a doll.
