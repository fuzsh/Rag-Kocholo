        "text": "Alice Go and Bella Podpadec - two-thirds of the punk-pop band Dream Wife - are sharing a laugh in their south London home as they wait for bandmate Rakel Mjöll to join us online from a cafe in her native Reykjavik.\n\nThe singer returned home to Iceland in mid-March at the request of her family, who were concerned about the UK's response to the impending coranavirus crisis.\n\nThe small Nordic nation launched its testing programme, albeit for a far smaller population, at the end of January, and was praised for having \"virtually eliminated\" the virus by June.\n\nIn the UK, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said the government \"took the right decisions at the right time\", including imposing the lockdown on 23 March, but a leading scientist has claimed the delay \"cost a lot of lives\".\n\n\"I remember there was a statement where the prime minister said senior citizens should avoid going on cruise ships, and I was like, 'What is happening?'\" recalls Mjöll, as she arrives (virtually) to the conversation.\n\n\"How on earth are countries going into lockdown and the prime minister is telling people not to go on cruise ships?\"\n\nMany countries imposed strict lockdown restrictions earlier than the UK did - with a few notable exceptions, such as Sweden.\n\n\"After that my family was quite afraid and asked me to come home and I've been here ever since,\" Mjöll continues.\n\nAllow Google YouTube content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Google YouTube .

As her band drop their subversive second album on Friday, there are currently no UK venues open (drive-ins aside) for them to perform it in anyway.\n\nInstead, their fans have had to sink their teeth into the \"beautifully gruesome\" music video for its punchy title track So When You Gonna... as well as the colourful one for album opener Sports! - which was directed, produced and edited by the band themselves.\n\nAllow Instagram content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Instagram .

They then worked with the feminist collective Girls Against to ensure that their live gigs were safe spaces for their young female fans - who they named the \"Bad Bitches\" - and even put out an open call for a succession of marginalised female and LGBT acts in the UK, US and Europe to support them on different nights of their tour.\n\nA few years on, they are continuing to try to redress the gender imbalance of the music industry with their follow-up record, produced by \"an incredible team of women\", they say.\n\nRecent studies have suggested that last year, between 2-5% of popular music was produced by women.\n\n'Sensitivity and power'\n\n\"It was, for us, a real putting-our-money-where-our mouth-was situation,\" says guitarist Go, quoting the lyrics to the rock opera-style Sports!\n\n\"Having the time to actually be like, 'How do we want this record to be recorded? What is the process we want to be supporting here?' And for us it was practising what we preach in that respect,\" she adds.\n\n\"And certainly the themes, the spaces it's going to sonically, there's a sensitivity and also power in equal measure that I think was really delicately handled by [producer and mixer] Marta [Salongi]. We couldn't have made this record without her and the conversations she held with us.\"\n\nWhile working with an all-female production team was a \"deeply important part of the process\", Podpadec points out, \"it wasn't a contrived position or decision\".\n\n\"We were working with the right people, the best people to make what we've made,\" she adds, referring to Salogni, engineer Grace Banks and mastering engineer Heba Kadry.\n\n\"Them all being women kind of really helped and enriched it.\"\n\nAllow Google YouTube content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Google YouTube .

It tells tales of love, lust, ignorance, not fitting in, and, in the case of Temporary, a heartfelt consolation to a friend who endured multiple miscarriages.\n\nAnother track, Validation, begins with its protagonists drinking whisky in a cemetery (or so they think) and leads to them pondering over life, and their need for approval from other people.\n\n\"Lyrically, it's cut between three verses examining different types of validation within our community,\" explains Mjöll, who is the band's lead lyricist.\n\n\"And asking, 'why do we need this validation?' From a lover, from an art show community, from your musical peers - and just questioning why that's so important to us.\"\n\n'Inspiring and educational'\n\n\"The Wives\", as they are affectionately known, are part of a growing number of young stars in the UK, which includes Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford, who are using their online platform to try and bring about societal change.\n\nSo, as well as delivering the album, they've also launched its namesake So When You Gonna... podcast series, for which they interviewed friends, collaborators and creative professionals who inspire them, in order to help fire the imaginations of their fans, in turn.\n\n\"I wish I could have had these conversations when I was like a teenager,\" admits Go. \"The normalisation of non-males in these particular roles in the creative industry.\n\n\"It felt important to just hear people's journey from A-to-B is, as it's never the same, and hopefully it's inspiring and educational for people.\"\n\nThe indie-rockers believe the pandemic may have given more people more time to get creative, as well as \"casting such a bright light\" on global and domestic issues - such as climate change, domestic abuse and racial inequality."
