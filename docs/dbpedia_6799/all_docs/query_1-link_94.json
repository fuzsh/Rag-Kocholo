        "text": "Advertising changes all the time, but the slogan has been a cornerstone of advertising for more than a century, with some slogans dating all the way back to the 1800s. As a consumer, you can probably think of a handful of popular slogans off the top of your head. These slogans might seem a little cheesy, but the fact that they stick in your head so well makes them a powerful tool for advertisers.\n\nIf you want to boost your marketing campaign, crafting a slogan is a great way to do that. A good slogan gives customers something they can associate with your business or its products and services. Your slogan also helps keep your company in the minds of customers; when a customer sees something similar to your slogan, they’re more likely to think about your brand.\n\nFrom McDonald’s in the 1960s to Nike’s “Just Do It” slogan, there are countless examples of slogans that have stuck with people for years or even decades. That being said, it can be hard to come up with a slogan to make your brand stand out. Some of the biggest companies in the world have spent a lot of time creating and testing slogans with no luck.\n\nLooking at examples of successful slogans is one of the best ways to create an effective slogan for your business. With more than a century's worth of slogans to look back at, there are countless examples of great slogans over the years. If you want to boost your branding and come up with a slogan that sticks with your customers, here’s what you need to know about writing your own slogan.\n\nComing up with your own slogan can be tough, especially if you're not sure what to look for in a good slogan. Looking at popular slogan examples is a good way to figure out what makes a slogan work, that way you can write a better slogan for your business. In this next section, we'll take a closer look at 10 popular slogans from some of the biggest brands.\n\nBounty \"The quicker picker upper\"\n\nBounty did a good job of creating an effective slogan by directly approaching a problem that people who use its products have. For everyone who felt like they used too many paper towels to clean up a mess, \"The quicker picker upper\" sounded like a dream come true. By manufacturing paper towels that are thicker and more absorbent than some other brands and telling people about it, Bounty became a top paper towel brand. To this very day, \"The quicker picker upper\" is still printed on every package of Bounty paper towels.\n\nOld Spice \"The original. If your grandfather hadn't worn it, you wouldn't exist.\"\n\nThis popular male grooming brand has been around since 1937, but this iconic slogan didn't come about until 2008 when the company launched a new shower gel that was sold using the slogan. Old Spice coined the phrase \"The original. If your grandfather hadn't worn it, you wouldn't exist.\" as a way to appeal to a younger generation of men looking for male grooming products. This slogan is witty and memorable for younger men, but still pays homage to the older generation of men who have been using Old Spice products for years.\n\nAllState \"You're in good hands\"\n\nAllState is a popular insurance company that has been around since the 1950s, and in the decades since then, the company has been connected to the recognizable phrase \"You're in good hands.\" But as simple as this phrase is, it certainly is memorable. The slogan was coined by one of the company's sales executives and was based on a similar phrase that he would use to calm his wife when taking their children to the doctor. \"You're in good hands\" is simple, straightforward, and clearly tells the customers what they want to hear, especially when it comes to insurance.\n\nSubway \"Eat fresh\"\n\nThe idea behind Subway is that it's a healthy alternative to other fast food restaurants and a good choice for people who are in a time crunch but want something fresh and healthy to eat– hence the slogan \"Eat fresh\". This iconic phrase started in 2000 and has been connected to the brand ever since. The slogan is reflective of Subway's mission to be a healthy fast food alternative that provides its customers with real, fresh ingredients. At only two words, the slogan provides everything you need to know about the quality of food you'll get at Subway.\n\nDollar Shave Club \"Shave time. Shave money.\"\n\nDollar Shave Club does a lot of things right when it comes to marketing, and its slogan is no exception. The Dollar Shave Club slogan is \"Shave time. Shave money.\" This is an excellent slogan because it's exactly what the company is trying to do for its customers. By subscribing to regular razor deliveries and shopping online, customers can save time and money while making sure they always have fresh razors to shave with. When your slogan tells customers what your brand is all about and you deliver on those promises, that's a recipe for an effective slogan.\n\nAirbnb \"Belong anywhere\"\n\nAirbnb started back in 2008, but the brand has evolved tremendously since. While Airbnb originally was used as lodging for short term travelers, it now provides housing for a variety of situations, from vacation rentals to homestays. The phrase \"belong anywhere\" is an indication of the brand's mission to help people feel at home, no matter where they are in the world. The phrase is only two words, but it's enough to highlight Airbnb's brand identity and encourage people to use Airbnb so they can feel at home wherever they may be.\n\nDunkin' \"America runs on Dunkin'\"\n\nA lot of people see coffee as fuel to start their days, so \"America runs on Dunkin'\" is a fitting slogan for one of the country's most popular coffee chains. You don't have to wonder where you can go to get a cup of coffee and breakfast to start your day because you know where America goes for that. What's interesting is that this slogan was introduced in 2006, making it one of the newer slogans on the list.\n\nKellog's Rice Krispies \"Snap! Crackle! Pop!\"\n\nIt's safe to say that most people are familiar with Kellog's rice krispies famous slogan of \"Snap! Crackle! Pop!\". This slogan dates all the way back to 1932 when it was used to promote the brand in a radio commercial. \"Snap! Crackle! Pop!\" is meant to show people how rice krispies sound when you eat them– and if you've ever had a bowl of the delicious cereal, you know just how accurate it is. This slogan is catchy, memorable, and resonates well with people of all ages. For a phrase that's been around for 90 years, it's still as iconic as ever.\n\nToyota \"Let's go places\"\n\nThe purpose of a car is to get you places, so it only makes sense that Toyota coined the phrase \"Let's go places\" as the brand's official slogan. The slogan \"Let's go places\" started in 2012 and is meant to show people how they can drive Toyota cars to get them where they need to go. This simple phrase captures Toyota's mission to be a reliable brand that encourages people to live their lives to the fullest and embark on their own adventures– and to drive Toyota cars to help them do so.\n\nKay Jewelers \"Every kiss begins with Kay\"\n\n\"Every kiss begins with Kay\" isn't just a slogan, it's a catchy jingle that will get stuck in your head as soon as you hear it coming from your television. Kay Jewelers' famous slogan \"every kiss begins with Kay\" was introduced in 1985 and has brought the jewelry company significant business and brand recognition ever since. The intention of this catch phrase is to show customers that if they buy from Kay Jewelers, love will follow. The slogan is simple and sweet, which is everything you want when it comes to jewelry."
