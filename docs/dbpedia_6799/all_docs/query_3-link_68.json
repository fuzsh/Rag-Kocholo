        "text": "Wonder Woman's apartment is located in the heart of the metropolis, and the lights of the night view. But, in her bedroom, everything was quiet. The silver moonlight poured in through the window, covering the room with a soft glow.\n\nDiana's bed is a wooden bed with classical style, covered with white as snow sheets. Her toned, linear body lay quietly on the bed.\n\nIn the moonlight, Diana's skin was as white as China and slightly rosy. Her long hair cascades down, in sharp contrast to the white sheets spread on the bed. In the deep sleep, the expression on her face is so quiet and sweet, as if dreaming of a beautiful dream.\n\nDiana's body showed a serene sense of beauty. Her face was quiet, almost like a statue carved by a master, without any flaws. Her fair skin almost forgot the incredible power of her.\n\nHer body is graceful and balanced, and every part of her reveals her extraordinary constitution. Her breasts were plump, highlighted in a way, in perfect harmony with her whole body. Moonlight gently sprinkled on the above, let a person can not help but see a few more eyes.\n\nThe sheet half covered her body, and moonlight and shadow interweave on her skin for an almost artistic visual effect.\n\nOutside the window, the wind blew gently, bringing a cool night breeze to the room, gently blowing the curtains and Diana's long hair. All of this seems so harmonious, so beautiful.\n\nThe atmosphere in the room has changed subtly. An almost imperceptible array began to form centered on Diana's bed. Although the array is huge, its energy is so cleverly dispersed that no one can detect its existence.\n\nBut Diana's body, with her demigod intuition, began to feel that something was wrong. Although the array was designed to be extremely secretive, the strange energy that crept into her began to influence her.\n\nDuring her deep sleep, Diana's body began to spasm, as if countless knives pierced her skin and muscles. An look of pain began to rise on her face, and cold sweat dripping from her forehead and wet the sheets.\n\nHer breathing became lighter and faster, almost as if in a struggle against some invisible force. Her long black hair began to tremble slightly like an electric shock.\n\nShe wanted to wake up, and her body and intuition told her that it was definitely not an ordinary dream, but she could not break free from this sudden predicament.\n\nThe energy of the array continues to slowly but firmly invade her body, like an invisible snake, beginning to have an impact on her divine power and artifacts.\n\n。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。\n\nThe sun hits the streets of the metropolis, bringing a new day to the city that never sleeps. However, the peace of the city was broken by a gang of robbers. They hurried to load the money in the car, while they secretly congratulated themselves that they were about to succeed.\n\nHowever, at the moment they pressed the engine button, the car did not move, as if it were locked by an invisible force. The robbers looked surprised and puzzled.\n\nThen they turned their heads and finally saw Wonder Woman standing in the back of the car. Diana grabbed the back bumper of the car, looking firm. Even though the engine of the car roared and roared to move forward, it seemed so weak in front of her strength.\n\nDiana wears a soft armor made by the Vulcan, which fits to her body and shows off her fitness and strength.\n\nThe robbers now fully understand that they are as insignificant as ants compared to this superhero.\n\nDiana let go, went to the front of the car, looked at the stunned expressions of the robbers, and then smiled softly.\n\nGive yourself over to the police and have a chance to reform. Otherwise, you will have more serious consequences, \" Wonder Woman said calmly.\n\nWonder Woman Diana stood, smiling and waving to the citizens gathered around. Her eyes are full of confidence and strength, as if the symbol of the new era of women. However, at this point, the Amazon crown on her forehead became abnormally activity.\n\nA feeling of pain passed through her head like an electric current, and the golden crown on her head suddenly began to contract, contracting tightly around her forehead, and every inch brought indescribable pain. She tried to remove it with her hand, but even her almost unmatched strength could not shake the crown.\n\nThe pain grew stronger, and every inch of her muscles was tightening tight, as if to tear apart. She clenched her teeth and used all her strength to endure the sudden torture. But the pain reached a polar point, and even a demigod as powerful as her had to yield.\n\nDiana, eventually unable to stand, fell to her knees on the ground, holding her head in her hands and exposed unguarded to the crowd. Big beads of sweat were dripping from her forehead, and her muscles were trembling, as if in a silent contest with this unknown power. She clenched her teeth to making any sound. It was her last insistence, and she didn't want to be vulnerable to everyone.\n\nThe surrounding citizens were shocked and puzzled to see this scene. Their hero, the omnipotent Wonder Woman, is now kneeling on her knees, twisted and trembling, completely losing her usual style.\n\nAt that moment, Diana was filled with confusion and panic, but she did not understand what had happened. It was all so sudden, so incomprehensible. But whatever it was, she knew that it was definitely not a small thing, but a precursor to a bigger crisis.\n\nDiana felt her crown feel like a heavy hammer, which almost overwhelmed her. That feeling of suffocation, pain, contraction...... Everything gathered in her mind, let her eyes appear twinkling stars.\n\nThe pain came like a tsunami, the crown was like a tightening iron hoop, and every second made Diana's head feel like tearing apart. Her hands kept scratching at the golden crown, but the golden hoop seemed to fit deep into her skin and could not move it.\n\nThe crowd around had been stunned by the sudden situation, they had never seen the invincible Amazon princess so fragile and so painful. Many people even took out their mobile phones and began recording, but more people stood still, filled with concern and panic.\n\nWonder Woman's blue eyes have lost their focus, leaving only the blur and confusion, her body seems to have lost its strength, soft fell on the cold asphalt road. The hot sun hit her, but she felt only the great pain of the golden crown on her head.\n\nHowever, just as Wonder Woman was about to fall into a coma, the tightening of the crown suddenly stopped, and the tearing pain slowly subsided, leaving only the deep fatigue that had just been tortured by great pain.\n\nMoments later, she tried to move her finger, then slowly supported her arms on the ground, trying to sit up. Her body was still somewhat weak, but at least the pain on her head was gone. She tried her best to remove the stubborn crown, but it was as well with her skin.\n\nLooking around the citizens, she saw their concerned and afraid eyes, and she knew how shocked she looked like at the moment. An indescribable feeling came into her heart, and she lifted herself up, leaping quickly into the air, leaving the place where she felt embarrassed and miserable.\n\nDiana flew in the sky, and although she was fast enough to cross the busy metropolitan sky, her thoughts were clearly out of flight. The sudden pain before that seemed to indicate more disturbing conditions in the future. For a while, she could hardly believe that she would be influenced by the golden crown, which was the symbol she had been wearing, but now it has become a tool to hurt her.\n\nJust then, she suddenly felt a sharp pain coming back into her mind. This time, she had no warning. The crown began to contract again, as if an invisible hand held her head and pressed it in.\n\nThe pain peaked almost instantly, and this time Diana could not control herself. A sad scream pierced the sky, and she lost control of the flight, and fell from the sky like a meteor.\n\nBelow is a primeval forest with a dense canopy like a large net, but for a Wonder Woman out of control, that can hardly provide any buffer.\n\nPoof ——, she fell hard on the ground of the forest, with the impact of the leaves around her. Every cell in her body screamed in pain, but it was less than the great pain of the golden crown on her head.\n\nShe lay on the ground, almost unable to move, only to feel the severe pain from her head. Her eyes were so blurred that she could not even see all of her surroundings, except that she was in a very bad situation.\n\nThen, as before, the pain slowly began to ease. But this time, Diana did not immediately stand up. She lay there, looking at the sky with her blue eyes, filled with questions and uneasiness.\n\n'What's all about?\"She asked herself in her heart,\" I need to find the answer, no matter what makes this abnormal, I have to find the reason behind it.\"\n\nHowever, she also knew that the most important thing now is to get out of the forest first and then plan the next step. She took a deep breath and supported herself to leave the place where she let her experience the pain again. But in her heart, a wake-up call has quietly sounded —— she knows that all this is just the beginning of the problem.\n\nDiana was about to stand again, to tidy up her emotions and plans, but, sensing the signs of her recovery, she began to shrink ruthlessly again.\n\n'No.... impossible! She exclaimed, and the pain ran through her body like lightning. This time, there was no slowdown, no stop, the pain just increased.\n\nHer body again out of control and fell to the ground, twisting painfully as if hit by a heavy hammer. Her hands involuntarily clasped her head, as if it could relieve the unbearable pain.\n\nSweat began to drip from her forehead, a drop, two drops, soon merged into a stream, flowing through her white face, soaked the leaves on the ground.\n\nHer body rolled and twisted like an electric shock. The veins rose on the surface of her skin, highlighting the great stress and pain she endured. She tried her strength to break free from the indescribable torture, but the golden crown seemed to have its own consciousness, firmly locked in her head, so that she could not get rid of it.\n\nTime seemed to stop at this moment, and to Diana, every second seemed like an eternity. She no longer had the power to think, and even began to wonder if she could survive the incident.\n\nThe surrounding forest seemed to feel her pain, the birds stopped singing, the small animals have hid in the trees, the whole nature fell into a kind of depression and silence.\n\nThe pain did not stop, and Diana felt that her consciousness began to blur and her vision became increasingly indistinct.\n\nWonder Woman struggles on the edge of the pain, trying not to lose consciousness. But just then she felt another physical oppression —— her soft armour began to change.\n\nOriginally strong and flexible, the soft armor began to make incredible changes. Wonder Woman first felt a subtle sense of tightening, as if an invisible hand was slowly tightening her belly. Her brow frowned because the feeling was new and very uncomfortable.\n\nThen, the changes begin to accelerate. The soft armor gradually loses its elasticity, becomes hard and firm, and its shape begins to distort, gradually tightening the shape like the waist. Wonder Woman can feel her abdomen compressed, as if she were constantly oppressed by an invisible force.\n\nThe otherwise strong abdominal muscles began to feel stressed, as if they were stuffed into a smaller and smaller space. Her breathing became more difficult because she also oppressed her lungs.\n\nWonder Woman's face began to turn pale, a pressure that hurt her. Her waist was gradually compressed even thinner, almost to its limit, a level that was only achieved by extreme means such as the removal of some ribs.\n\nAlthough her demigod body had great resilience and tolerance, she still could not resist the oppression of being both inside and outside.\n\nFinally, the change of the soft armor stopped, but left behind an almost incredible thin waist. Wonder Woman feels like her internal organs are compressed together, and every breath is a torture.\n\nThis is a whole new kind of pain. Her soft armor is like a shackle made of steel, gradually thinning her waist into an unnatural fineness.\n\nAlthough her body has a flexibility and endurance different from that of ordinary humans, it does not relieve her pain now. Her internal organs seemed to be squeezed together, and her breathing began to become extremely difficult.\n\nShe tried to open her mouth to breathe in, but she felt as if her lungs had been compressed, and every breath was a torture. Everything began to blur, and she realized that she was in a state of extreme danger.\n\nIn desperation, Diana tried to use all the power left to untie the \"waist\" that was pressing her, but her hands became weak in pain and weakness. Her fingers gently touched the soft armor, trying to find a way to unwind it, but everything was in vain.\n\nEventually, Wonder Woman collapsed weakly, holding her hands around the deformed waist. In this remote primeval forest, she felt as if she had been abandoned by the whole world, facing an unexplained and understanding torture.\n\nShe closed her eyes and tried to relieve the pain with thought and concentration, but no matter how hard she tried, the pain and pressure felt nothing less.\n\nWonder Woman's boots also began to change, and despite the already constrained waist and tight gold crown, the change worsened. She could feel the texture and shape of the boots change rapidly, and then she felt a silky touch extending from the ankle to the thigh, as if some material was replacing her boots.\n\nThe next moment, her legs were tightly wrapped in a pair of transparent silk stockings, while her feet were fixed by a pair of extremely tight high heels. The Angle of the heels made the soles of her feet almost 90 degrees, and every step was like walking on the tip of a needle.\n\nAt this moment, Wonder Woman feels that her whole body is firmly bound, and that no one part is free from head to foot. Despite the extraordinary endurance and strength of her divine body, all of them seem meaningless at the moment.\n\nShe struggled to stand up, but the design of the heels and her now bound physical state made it almost an impossible task. She used all her strength to stand up, but could only walk a few steps.\n\nTo make matters worse, she didn't understand why this happened or how to reverse it.\n\nWith all the changes, Wonder Woman feels gradually deprived of her strength. From the gold crown on her head to the bondage at her waist to the heels on her feet, every change weakened her strength. When this dealt her a heavy blow as her guardian silver bracelet also began to change.\n\nShe could feel the fading power of the silver bracelet turn into pure decoration. The pair of translucent silk gloves slowly climbed onto her arms, like a snake, replacing the original solid guardian silver bracelet. She could see the silver wristbands of her arms decrease, eventually becoming two slender silver bracelets, which shone but completely lost their original function.\n\nIn her pain, she clung to the tree trunk, trying to find a trace of balance. Her otherwise bright, firm eyes are now full of vacant and lost. The original combat uniforms and weapons have now become decorations, as if laughing at her inability.\n\nShe wanted to cry and vent the pain of losing everything, but the physical pain and the inner blow made her almost unable to breathe. Every breath was a test of her will. But even in the face of such despair, she still had sparks of hope.\n\nShe remembers how many times she had faced despair, each time is relying on the tough will and unyielding will to overcome the difficulties. Although she has lost power, she will not give up. She knew that whenever there was a glimmer of hope, she would try to find the truth and find a way to get her back.\n\nIn the ancient forest, where the sun shines, a woman, once a confident, strong, and representative of the power and wisdom of modern women, has now become a sad picture. Her image has been completely different from the past, bound by the tradition of the old era, appears extremely fragile.\n\nThe originally bright golden crown was tightly bound to her head, and as it oppressed her, her hair became messy, with several strands scattered on her sad cheek. The protective silver bracelets are now pure decorative, shining in sharp contrast to her dim eyes.\n\nHer combat suit also underwent a huge change, turning her originally strong soft armor into a tied waist, making her waist unusually slender and could hardly breathe, and every breath became a burden on her. And the boots, which allowed her to walk freely, became her silk stockings and high heels, and every step is full of pain.\n\nShe held on to the tree trunk, trying to find a little balance. She was about to bear the endless pain and humiliation, the oppression from the inside out, let her consciousness almost blurred. But at that moment, a drop of water slipped from the corner of her eye and fell on her bound jade hand. It is her tears, is her unwilling to lose their strength, is the fate of this unfair protest.\n\nShe tried to breathe deep, but also struggled because of her tightly bound waist.\n\nIn Wonder Woman's consciousness, an indescribable sense of heaviness slowly begins to linger. The feeling is like a layer of invisible haze in her heart and body quietly spread. Each heartbeat was like saying goodbye to her strength, little by little, as if the sand had escaped from her palm.\n\nWhen the guardian silver bracelet was completely turned into a pure decorative silver bracelet, she could almost feel an invisible chain holding her tightly. Her muscles suddenly felt so heavy that they were being suppressed by a shot. He tried to wave his arm, only to fall down weakly.\n\nShe tried to gather the rest of her power to awaken the power hidden in her body. But her thoughts seemed to sink into the endless darkness, and she could find no response. In her body, the originally surging force, is now weak, as sealed in an untouchable abyss.\n\nHer breath became lighter and lighter, and every breath seemed like a struggle. The moment the divine power was sealed, her body seemed to endure a huge shock that almost sank her consciousness into darkness.\n\nFwas combined with pain, like a heavy mountain on her. She felt completely drained, and her despair made her unable to concentrate. All she left in her mind was chaos and endless darkness.\n\nShe closed her eyes, as if she had accepted her fate, completely in despair. But even in such a moment, the voice in her heart that has been fighting with the fate still exists, although weak, but it is there, waiting for the cocoon into a butterfly moment. At this moment, however, Wonder Woman completely lost her divine power and became a mortal crushed by fate.\n\nWonder Woman is so miserable at the moment. She collapsed on the ground of the forest, with her back against a big tree, as if seeking its shelter. Her face lost its former luster and confidence, replaced by a deep weakness and despair.\n\nHer waist was uncompressed, and was forcibly shaped into a deformed standard for women under the feudal rule of the old era. This oppressed image is a huge contrast to her appearance as a symbol of freedom and justice.\n\nHer originally strong thighs and jade feet are now tightly wrapped in silk stockings and high heels, extremely narrow and limited. The heels made her toes bend tightly as if every cell were screaming.\n\nHer long, toned arms, now wrapped in translucent silk gloves and decorative silver bracelets, have lost their former majesty and strength.\n\nHer whole body seemed to have been deprived of life, and had become extremely weak. This weakness is not only physical, but also a complete mental breakdown. She opened her mouth hard to shout, only to find that she could not even speak.\n\nA Wonder Woman, crushed, changed, and stripped of her power and dignity. She could not break free of this bondage, can only wait for the future uncertainty in pain and despair.\n\nIn the rich shade, Wonder Woman, who had lost her divine power, was defeated by her own pain and weakness. The strength and confidence of the past, completely dissipated at this moment. With her deformed waist and her arms, she was stripped of her former fighter.\n\nEach breath becomes difficult. Her chest rose violently and seemed to be making a final struggle with the pain. Those ornaments and clothes that changed her, like invisible chains, bound her tightly.\n\nHer blue eyes, which should be bright as a star, were now shrouded with fatigue and pain, until they finally lost its luster. Her lips trembled slightly, and her body gradually relaxed after a spasm. The deep forest, as if to build a quiet small universe for her, isolated from the outside world.\n\nFinally, Wonder Woman's consciousness is engulfed by darkness, and her head is gently tilted, completely unconscious.\n\nWonder Woman wakes up like she comes from a long dream, but the pressure and pain tell her that it's all reality. She felt her abdomen still wrapped in a strange waist, and the feeling of pressure made her frown slightly.\n\nShe moved her toes gently and the heels disappeared, but that didn't reassure her. The golden crown is still on her head, and although it no longer continues to tighten, its existence is like a warning that it may put her into unbearable pain again at any time.\n\nShe tried to move her body, but felt a sense of weakness that she had never felt before, as if every muscle, every cell had been deprived of its strength. Her divine powers did not return at all.\n\nShe only then noticed that she was in an extremely luxurious room. The noble tapestry, the delicate crystal chandelier, the elegant furniture, and the soft large bed in which she was lying, all revealed a classical and aristocratic atmosphere.\n\nThen the door opened slowly, and a man in traditional French aristocratic dress came in. His eyes revealed a twisted satisfaction and satisfaction. Wonder Woman sees him, and immediately understands everything.\n\n'Welcome, Wonder Woman, and welcome to my castle. I am the Duke of Darren.'He said, with a smile.\n\nWonder Woman holds back the pain in her body and mind and forces herself to sit up, despite her little physical strength, but her eyes are still determined.\n\n'What did you do? Why do this to me?\"\n\n\"Because you need to be educated, to be corrected. As a woman, you should know where you are.\"\n\nWonder Woman heard this, feeling a deep sadness and anger. She was a warrior, a symbol of freedom and equality, but now stripped of it by a sick man.\n\n'Even if you deprive me of my strength, and bind my body, you will not bind my soul. You will never succeed, the Duke of Darren.\"\n\nThe Duke of Darren gave him a sneer.\n\n'We'll see it, Wonder Woman.\"\n\nWonder Woman knows that she needs to find a way to regain all she has lost while also making her voice for all the oppressed and bound women. Anyway, she cannot and will never give up.\n\n\"Come someone, change the clothes for my princess.\"The Duke of Darren left the room after giving orders. After the Duke of Darren's orders, the door was opened again, and the maids crept in. They quickly but carefully put Wonder Woman out of bed and forced her to stand in front of a large and luxurious dressing mirror.\n\nAlthough weak enough to barely stand, Wonder Woman tries to straighten herself. She looked at herself in the mirror: her godless blue eyes, her messy black hair, her skin that had lost its usual healthy color and turned pale. What hurt her most was the deformed waist, tightly compressed by the tied waist, hardly like her own body.\n\nAll this, let her feel a deep sadness and disappointment. She closed her eyes and tried to escape all this reality, but she knew that it was all true.\n\nWonder Woman stands in front of the changing mirror and sees the maids take out her old real silver bracelets, boots and their deformed silk stockings, silk gloves, bracelets and high heels. A moment of fear and uneasiness rose from her heart, and her eyes were filled with resistance.\n\nDespite her weakness, she subconsciously began to struggle, trying to escape it all. But several maids overcame her limbs, and no matter how hard she struggled, she could not break them. Without the support of her divine power, she felt like being deprived of everything.\n\nThe maids came closer, holding objects that had been symbols of her power, but now \"instruments of torture.\"Wonder Woman can't do anything, just watch them put these things on her.\n\nShe felt powerless and desperate, and a sense of unprecedented helplessness surrounded her, almost suffocating her. She knew that even inside was being deprived bit by bit. At this moment, her eyes are more dim, as if all the hope and dignity were strangled in this moment.\n\nThe two maids skillfully break open Wonder Woman's legs, and although she tries to use her last strength back, her physical reaction is almost negligible. One of the maids took up the silk stockings that had changed from her war boots and began to slowly wear them on her legs.\n\nAs the stockings climbed and wrapped tightly around her toned but now weak legs, Wonder Woman felt a sense of bondage that began to diffuse. Her leg muscles seemed to be locked, losing the ability to stretch freely and force.\n\nThis added to the weakness she had already felt, and made her legs begin to tremble slightly. She felt that she was about to collapse, but her body was unable to perform any resistance or escape.\n\nWonder Woman feels an unprecedented weakness and bondage, which is not only physical, but more spiritual and spiritual oppression. Her legs were eventually completely wrapped in silk stockings, weakening her already limited mobility, and she felt completely deprived of her freedom and dignity as a warrior, as a woman.\n\nTwo maids stood on both sides of Wonder Woman and broke her arms with her determination. Despite Wonder Woman's efforts to tighten her muscles to resist the hand that controls her, she is unable to produce effective resistance. This feeling of helplessness stimulated her every nerve and filled her heart with anxiety.\n\nThe other two maids stood in front of her and picked up the silk gloves changed from her guardian silver bracelet. They slowly began to put Wonder Woman on the smooth, soft gloves. Wonder Woman watched the silk gloves rise slightly from her fingertips, gradually wrapping them around her entire arm. Every time the silk gloves touched her skin, she felt a sense of bondage, as if an invisible chain were gradually reinforced.\n\nThe gloves eventually wrapped around her arms, and every inch of her skin felt the ubiquitous bondage. She could hardly bend her arms, let alone clench her fist. And her hands, which were once so powerful hands, are hanging weakly at this time, each fingertip is slightly trembling, as if it is telling their own unwilling and helpless.\n\nAfter completing the task, the maids stepped back a few steps, quietly observing the former heroine. The expression in their eyes was complicated, some showing sympathy, others indifferent. But Wonder Woman, without her original fighting power, can only stand there silently, letting herself be bound and controlled.\n\nWonder Woman stands there like a statue, and although her appearance is still elegant, her inner despair and helplessness cannot be hidden. The maids came up to her side and gently picked up the gorgeous and delicate bracelets that had been changed from the guardian silver bracelet. The pair of bracelets shone in the sun like cold chains.\n\nOne of the maids slowly and carefully placed one bracelet on Wonder Woman's left wrist, and then placed another one around her right wrist. Every time the bracelet touches the skin, it creates a cold touch that makes Wonder Woman feel her lost power awake.\n\nWonder Woman was s of tight tight. Her chest rose slightly, and every breath seemed like a struggle for life. Her limbs, once strong, trembling with bondage and weakness, seemed to fall at any moment.\n\nShe tried to raise her head, blue eyes in addition to confusion, more is that unbelievable and unwilling. She was once the most powerful heroine in the world, but now she stood like a imprisoned bird, with her wings cut and her hands tied.\n\nThe maids walked up to the front of Wonder Woman, holding the high heels that had changed from her war boots. These high heels, although seemingly elegant, have actually brought her endless pain. In the hands of the maids, the heels were like a tool of judgment, full with the power to make her fear.\n\nSeeing those high heels, Wonder Woman's heart tightened. She wanted to escape, wanted to get rid of all this, but when she tried to take the first step, her body involuntarily lost her balance and fell straight to the ground. She wanted to support herself with her hands, but the silk gloves, changed from the silver bracelet, provided little grip to keep her grasp the ground.\n\nThe maids came to her side and bent over and pinched her feet. Those feet that were once invincible on the battlefield are now very soft and powerless. The maids carefully put high heels over Wonder Woman's feet, as if they put shoes on a statue of a lost power.\n\nWonder Woman can only watch this happen, feeling a despair and helplessness she had ever felt before. At that moment, she completely realized that she had lost not only strength, but also freedom and dignity. Her body, which was once a symbol of her freedom and power, was now made into an instrument of restraint and shame. It was a humiliation that she had never experienced before, and a reality that she could not accept.\n\nAt that moment, Wonder Woman's inner defense line completely collapsed. She felt a deep sense of powerlessness and despair, an emotional experience she had never experienced. Once, she was an omnipotent warrior, with their own strength and courage to protect the world, but now, she has become so fragile and vulnerable.\n\nThe pair of high heels, like a shackle, tightly bound to her. She could not escape, nor resist, but could only accept it helplessly. Every detail, every movement, seems to be eroding her self-esteem and dignity.\n\nHer blue eyes were full of fear and unwillingness, but the eyes gradually became blurred and godless. She began to doubt herself, if she had a chance to get rid of it and be the Wonder Woman of power and hope again.\n\nWonder Woman feels that every tiny part of his body is tightly bound. The maids forced her feet into the heels, which seemed to be designed to be uncomfortable. The Angle was nearly 90 degrees, making her strong, flexible toes tight and barely immovable.\n\nWhen the maids made sure the shoes were put on, Wonder Woman felt that the shoes began to be \"alive\" and they began to tighten. The soles of her foot were deformed, and her toes were close together, as if bound by iron chains.\n\nIn order to relieve the sudden pain, she opened her mouth to breathe, only to find that the waist was like an invisible hand holding her waist, leaving her unable to expand her lungs. Her breath became rapid and shallow, and every breath seemed to come out of a tiny pipe.\n\nHer limbs began to tremble, but the tremor was not out of free will, but because her body had almost reached its limit.\n\nThe maids gently lifted Wonder Woman up and began to give her a seemingly gorgeous and elegant dress. The design and quality of the dress itself is undoubtedly superior, but for Wonder Woman today, it's all become ironic and mean. In her eyes, the dress was like a metaphor for the lost freedom and power.\n\nThe maids quickly and skillfully buckled each button, adjusted the skirt, and finally gently tied it with a thin belt to her waist. All this may seem skilled, but with every touch, Wonder Woman feels like a knife.\n\nWhen the costume was finished, the maids began to organize her long black hair into an elegant bun. All these actions, should have made her appear more outstanding and noble, but in this special environment and situation, but only let her feel a deep chain tightening in the heart.\n\nShe lowered her head and gently touched the deformed abdomen from her waist. Despite her almost overwhelming physical discomfort, she tried to take shallow breaths, trying to calm the pain that had ravaged her mind and body.\n\nWonder Woman struggles to gain her feet, feeling that heels and silk stockings form an almost unbearable sense of pressure on her legs and feet. She needed almost all her strength to keep standing under the costume.\n\nThen she walked slowly up to the changing mirror and stared at herself. The figure reflected in the mirror was so contradictory: on the one hand, in a gorgeous dress, she looked like a socialite at a fancy party; on the other hand, her body was so weak that she almost lost her old energy and strength. All this, combined with the unsuitable girdle and other decorations, made her figure look somewhat deformed.\n\nShe pursed her mouth gently, and her heart was filled with mixed emotions. Then a thought flashed through her mind: she had to persevere, and no matter how much oppression and insult her heart suffered, she could not break down her body and mind. Only by sticking to it can we have a chance to defeat the Duke of Darren and find everything she has lost.\n\nThen she looked down and touched the dress. Although the dress became a part of her physical and mental oppression, she had to admit that it was really made of good material and exquisite craftsmanship.\n\nWonder Woman walks out of the bedroom slowly, guided by the maids. Every step of her was full of difficulties and struggles, as if every inch of her movement required great effort. As she walked down the stairs, she had to use the extra strength to maintain her balance to avoid falling in those unbearable heels.\n\nAfter crossing the corridor, she eventually reached a huge room with a gorgeous long table in the center. Although she knew all were elaborate traps by the Duke of Darren, she had no spare energy to analyze or revolt. Her only concern now is how to keep standing and walking with an oppression on both body and mind.\n\nThe waist band strained her abdomen, almost preventing her from breathing freely. She tried to tighten her abdomen, straighten her back and try to look a touch of dignity. It did make her look like a woman tied to the traditions and norms of the old society, which was exactly what the Duke of Darren wanted to see.\n\nWonder Woman walks very hard under the double pressure of high heels and tied waists. Each step was like walking on a thin wire, and she had to use all her strength to maintain her balance. Her hands were slightly open as if looking for some support in the air, but the silk gloves caused her to feel hardly anything.\n\nHer pace was very slow, almost moving steps. She tried to keep every step in the same position on the ground, so as not to fall because of the instability of the high heels. Her legs trembled slightly under the pressure of the silk stockings, as if they could collapse at any moment.\n\nShe tried to straighten her back, but the tension of her waist made her hardly breathe freely. She had to use shallow breathing to maintain the most basic physiological needs. At the same time, her head hung slightly, as if looking for the way ahead, but perhaps because the bun was too tight.\n\nDuke Darren stepped suddenly forward, putting a quick arm around Diana's tight waist. The sudden movement struck Diana, who was already struggling for her balance, as she staggered and fell feebly in his arms.\n\nDarren's hand rubbed along her almost deformed waist, appearing to enjoy the power and control he temporarily had. The expression on Diana's face was extreme discomfort and disgust, but in this case she had little room for resistance.\n\nShe felt like every breath was fighting against the waist, as if she had to use all her strength at every breath. In this situation, Diana can only choose to temporarily snuggle in the person that she is extremely disgusted with, with this short moment to restore a little physical strength and balance.\n\nDiana's body trembled slightly in Darren's arms, her head slightly to the side as if to avoid facing him directly. Her arms, bound by their tight gloves, were rather stiff, and were almost close to her sides, without making any hug or resistance. Her breathing became significantly more shallow and rapid, in sharp contrast to Darren's breathing. Her toes barely touched the ground, and her whole body weight depended almost entirely on Darren's arms. Her eyes were closed, as if she were avoiding everything around her. Whenever Darren's hand rubbed around her waist, her body involuntarily contracted a little, as if avoiding the touch. Overall, a strong sense of discomfort and tension was evident from her movements.\n\nDuke Darren hugged Diana firmly, leading her to the solemn long table. The maids walked nimbly to the table, first gently opened the chair of the master, and then turned to the secondary seat. The Duke of Darren also had his arms around Diana's waist in one hand, and on the other hand he politely made a guiding gesture in the direction of the chair.\n\nThe weak Diana felt like she was being ushered in to the second seat. Her body has almost reached its limit, and high heels and girth make even short walking a test. The Duke of Darren gently helped her to sit down, and then slowly came down to the main seat, sitting down himself.\n\nAs she sat down, Diana felt a little relief, although the secondary seat was not as luxurious and comfortable as the host. She looked at the long table before her, with all kinds of fine porcelain and silver ware, and seemed to have prepared a grand banquet.\n\nThe Duke of Darren looked contentedly at Diana, and then turned to the maid, as if everything were in his control.\n\nThe Duke of Darren sat comfortably on the Lord, glancing deeply over the room, and then had his eyes fixed on Diana. His mouth turned slightly up, with a sneer.\n\n'You know, Diana, I have always felt that history is one of the most valuable treasures of mankind. It can teach us a lot of things, especially about how to treat women properly.\"\n\nThere was no expression on Diana's tight face, and her body was weak, and she used almost all her strength to maintain her most basic posture. Nevertheless, she remained unwilling to give up her hearing, and listened carefully to every word of the Duke of Darron.\n\n\"In feudal society, women were a beautiful and delicate existence,\" Darren went on. \" Their task was very simple —— to serve men, maintain family harmony, and have children. But now? Modern women, especially yours, think they can challenge it all.\"\n\nDiana took a deep breath and, though suffering, struggled to remain calm. The Duke of Darren's words did make her want to scream, but she knew she cannot fight back at the moment.\n\nDo you think breaking tradition is progress? What you do can only prove that you are a morally corrupt woman, worthless. Darren's tone grew colder and harder, almost mocking.\n\nDiana quietly lowered her eyes, not wanting Darren to see the anger and pain in her eyes. She knew that every word of him was to humiliate and suppress her, to make her yield.\n\nBut she also knew that such humiliation and pain were temporary. Her heart was still full of determination and faith, even if it seemed weak and weak, it was only temporary. When she has a chance to fight back, she completely breaks the Duke of Darren's narrow and biased worldview in her own way.\n\nDuke Darren smiled with satisfaction at Wonder Woman, or Diana. He noticed that she was weak back in her chair, could only take a small breath, and had no power to refute his point. It gave him a thrill of victory.\n\n'Look, Diana, that's what you should be like. Elegant, weak, and totally dependent on men. What do you think right now?'Darren asked defiantly.\n\nDiana's mouth twitched slightly, but she knew that it was not the time to argue with him. Her body is already too weak to maintain a basic physical balance. Darren's words are like a sharp blade, constantly stabbed into her heart, but she will not let him see her pain.\n\nShe looked up slowly and said in a barely powerful voice, \" You may have subdued me for now, but that doesn't mean you won.\"\n\nDarren heard this, but smiled even more triumphantly.'You don't even have the strength to stand up now, let alone fight against me.\"\n\nDiana was silent, and she knew that he was right.\n\nSeveral maids served two dishes in front of the Duke and Wonder Woman, and the Duke of Darren smiled at the dishes and then looked at Wonder Woman. He cut it gracefully with his silver fork and slowly tasted it, as if he were giving a lesson to Wonder Woman.\n\n\"Starting today, I will give you the manners you should learn. Start with table manners, princess.'Darren said, revealing in his tone a self-righteous sense of superiority.\n\nWonder Woman slowly turned her head to look at the dishes in front of her. Although she was very hungry, she didn't immediately. She understood that any unthinking act would lead to Darren's dissatisfaction and possible punishment. She glanced quickly at Darren's dining movements, and then imitated him, also cut a small piece with a fork with great grace, and sent it carefully into her mouth.\n\nDarren notices every movement of her and seems to be looking for any small details that could be criticized. But Wonder Woman follows exactly the \"etiquette\" he shows, giving him hardly a handle.\n\n'Yes, it looks like you learned it pretty fast. But this is only the beginning, \"Darren sneered,\" you have a long way to go to become a qualified noble lady.\"\n\nWonder Woman carefully cuts a small piece of the dish and delivers it slowly into her mouth with a fork. She could feel the waist limit the normal movement of her internal organs, causing a burst of nausea. But she controlled herself with a strong force of will, and did not let herself vomit out.\n\nHer complexion had changed slightly, however, and this slight discomfort had apparently not escaped the Duke of Darren's eyes. His face immediately became cold and his brow rowed.\n\n\"It seems that you have much to learn,\" said the Duke of Darren coldly, \" that a true noble lady would not show such an indecent look at dinner.\"\n\nWonder Woman heard this, knowing that now is not the time to fight back. She hung down her head, tried her best to calm her breathing and nausea, and then continued to finish the dishes in the most elegant way.\n\nThe Duke of Darren looked at her with his sneer even more pronounced. He seems to enjoy the sense of power that puts Wonder Woman in such a disadvantage.\n\nAs each dish was served to the table, the fragrance overflowed, and the maids skillfully decorated them with silver tableware. From salad, foie gras and seafood soup to a variety of meat and fish dishes, each dish is a perfect French meal, with a perfect balance of color, aroma and texture. Usually, such foods are intended to satisfy the needs of people's taste buds and their bodies.\n\nBut for Wonder Woman, it's an ordeal. Her internal organs felt increasingly uncomfortable under the pressure of the tied waist. Although her body repeatedly told her not to eat again, Duke Darren's eyes and repeated ceremonial emphasis made her afraid to stop.\n\nWhenever she tries to slow down or reject a dish, Duke Darren reminds her with sharp words that waste is unacceptable and that as a \"princess\" she should follow table manners.\n\nBy the time Wonder Woman barely took the last bite of the soup, her body had reached its limit. Her face was pale, and her forehead was covered with fine beads of sweat. She held her back to her twisted waist and felt pressure and pain in her abdomen. She trembled and breathed in hard, as if every breath of air had become so precious.\n\nThe Duke of Darren sat opposite, watching her pain with satisfaction. His eyes were full of control and malice, like admiring a successful work of art.\n\nDuke Darren put her arms around Wonder Woman, so weak that she could barely stand. He guided her through multiple doors and corridors, finally returning to the bedroom where she first woke up. The maids of the room stood aside, with a touch of emotion in their eyes, but at the orders of the Duke of Darren, they withdrew the room, and the door was shut closed.\n\nDarren finally let go of his hug around Wonder Woman. Without her support, Wonder Woman's legs softened and she fell heavily on the carpet. Each breath was like a small battle, and she gasped in pain, but her eyes were unusually firm and unsteady at Darren.\n\n\"It seems, princess, you don't adapt to so much... treatment and attention.'Said Darren scornfully, his lips up with a smile of triumph.\n\nWonder Woman uses her remaining strength to stand up again, but her body no longer obeys her commands. Still, her eyes were strong, as if they challenged Darren.\n\nDarren looked at her, and then turned to the other end of the room, sat down and picked up a fine book and began to read, as if all part of what he had expected.\n\nWonder Woman lies on the ground, she knows this is just the beginning and her enemies have more plans and ideas.\n\nDuke Darren stopped the book in his hand and rose slowly. He walks up to Wonder Woman, looking down at her struggling body and determined gaze.\n\n\"I will not punish you in front of your servant, but you have disappointed me today,\" his voice is full of contempt and sarcasm.\n\nThen he began to recite a spell. Wonder Woman can feel the gold crown on her head start to shrink, every letter, every syllable is like cast in fire, the pain is almost unbearable.\n\n\"Oh!no! Wonder Woman's screams went through the room as she hugged her head with her hands and rolled in pain.\n\nWonder Woman groans in pain, her golden crown tightening and pulling into her scalp to make her feel like she is about to be strangled alive.\n\n\"don't... Please... Let me go...\"She begged, tears streaming down her cheeks.\" I know I was wrong... I should not disobey your will... Please forgive me...”\n\nDarren looked at her coldly, with one hand touching her soft face. \" Good girl, just know wrong. But you also do not want to escape easily, I will slowly teach you, let you become the most obedient slave.”\n\nThe Duke of Darren observed her state, and then smiled softly, observing the result he wanted to see. He slowly stopped the spell, and the pressure of the golden crown was finally relieved.\n\nWonder Woman gasped weakly, she knows that more pain and struggle are still ahead.\n\nDarren slowly unbuttoned Wonder Woman's robe, revealing the thin white underwear wrapped inside. He licked the gap between the buttons with the tip of his tongue, while constantly rubbing Wonder Woman's plump breasts with his hands.\n\n\"Well...stay one's hand...\"The Wonder Woman couldn't help snorting, which made her both ashamed and secret.\"\n\nDarren looked up at her, joking in her eyes: \" Can't stand it so soon? Our night has only just begun.\"\n\nThen he stripped Wonder Woman's coat and underwear, revealing his naked nude. Wonder Woman hurriedly covers her chest and private parts with her hands.\n\nDarren gently removed her hand, kissed her neck and collarbone, and slowly removed her underwear. Wonder Woman struggles to put her legs together, but is easily separated by Darren.\n\nDarren's finger rubbed the last shade of Wonder Woman's body ——, holding back tightly to her tiny waist.\n\n\"It's a pity to cover up such a beautiful body.\"Murried Darren,\" In that case, let's get rid of it together.”\n\nWith that, he got down on one knee and neatly untied the Wonder Woman's ununtied waist. Wonder Woman's whole body is finally fully visible, too ashamed to look at Darren's eyes.\n\nAs the waist slipped, Wonder Woman's originally symmetrical waist gradually revealed. But when the leather was completely removed, it was replaced by a deformed, slender waist that looked much more delicate than a maiden. Wonder Woman's waist has been transformed by the long oppression of the waist and the magic on the waist, and has become as deformed as the medieval noble lady, even if the waist is untied, it cannot be recovered.\n\n\"This is......how matters stand?\"Wonder Woman looked down at her waist in horror, incredibly discovering that she was getting so thin.\n\n\"Oh, that's the result of long-term waist wear.\"Said Darren jokingly,\" You see, the strong waist is so shrunk that it looks like a porcelain doll.”\n\n\"No way to....... It's ridiculous!\"Wonder Woman screamed hysterically.\" How could my waist be like this!”\n\n\"Such is the fact.\"Said Darren calmly.\" I think you know now why I ask you to wear it all the time.”\n\n\"You devil!\"Wonder Woman roared angrily,\" I'll kill you!”\n\nDarren sneered and punched at Wonder Woman's slender waist. The punch hit the point, and Wonder Woman felt dark before her eyes and nearly fainted.\n\n\"Uh!\"She arched her back in pain, clasped her hands and curled up on the ground. Darren's blow broke her weak ribs, stirring her insides like a river.\n\n\"Well, it hurts?\"Darren looked at her down.\" This is what stands up against me!”\n\n\"Stop it....... Don't call......\"Wonder Woman weakly, with a strong nose.\n\n\"Well, I won't hit you anymore.\"Said Darren, pretengenerously,\" but you must first satisfy me a condition.”\n\n\"assorted...... What are the conditions?\"Asked Wonder Woman, on the alert.\n\n\"It's very easy. Next lesson, women should learn to serve men.\"Darren untied his trousers and took out his already high dildo.\n\nWonder Woman shivered on her knees on the floor, tears falling from the corners of her eyes. She was once so proud and powerful, but now she has become a plaything in the hands of the devil.\n\nDarren pulled her hair with one hand and forced her to look up.\"Show me if your nice little mouth will make me comfortable.”\n\nWonder Woman closes her eyes and opens her mouth to hold Darren's huge meat stick. The thing smelled fishy and made her retch. Wonder Woman tried, carefully licking the top with her tongue.\n\n\"Too slow, I said you would wait on me.\"Darren frowned dissatisfied and slapped Wonder Woman in the face. A clear sound echoed in the silent room.\n\n\"Sorry, my master, please punish me.\"Wonder Woman choked up and opened her mouth again. Her skill was so clumsy that her teeth hit Darren's body.\n\n\"You are a little talented,\" Darren sneered, \" Be stupid, but at least work hard. I'll just just teach you how to please men.\"\n\nThen he grabbed Wonder Woman's hair and rubbed it against her face.\"Stick out your tongue and take care of every inch. Remember to poke the most sensitive position with the tip of your tongue and suck on the tip.\"\n\nWonder Woman did so, stretching out her bright red uvula, and licking it like a cat drinking water, from the canopy to the column, carefully and skillfully. Darren snorted comfortably, \" Yes, that's it, work harder, lick the whole thing.\"\n\nWonder Woman's cheeks are already covered with prostate fluid, but she doesn't stop, still serving hard. Gradually, she found the hang and learned to focus on the most sensitive areas.\n\n\"Well... Well... She gave a slight groan and actively swung up and down with her tongue with the sucking movement.\n\n, \" Go on, speed up, I'll see your throat stuffed with me.\"\n\nWonder Woman obediently accelerated her handling, her soft lips and huge blades moving back and forth. Darren breathed in straight, holding her back and pushing her head deep.\n\n\"hold! Your mouth is a natural way to suck a guy! Darren shouted with excitement and worked even harder.\n\nWonder Woman has difficulty breathing, but she tries to open her mouth wide and let the large glans reach her throat. Suddenly, a strong tingling sensation rose from her abdomen, and Darren roared low, and the thick essence shot into her mouth.\n\nWonder Woman stared her eyes wide. Before she could react, she felt a large stream of sticky hydroheat burst into her mouth and choked on her trachea. She coughed violently, semen spilling from the corners of her mouth and dripping on the carpet.\n\n\"limmer! It's all out! Darren saw this furious.\n\nWonder Woman collapsed on the ground, just after the most humiliating moment of her life. She raised her head with and tearful fully at Darren.\n\n\"Master... Please forgive the slave......\"She sobbed at a request.\n\nWith a sneer, Darren came over and stepped on her neck. \" You want me to forgive? Who do you think you are, good enough for my forgiveness?”\n\nHe kicked Wonder Woman in the stomach, and she curled up in a ball in pain. Then Darren pulled her hair and forced her to look up at herself. \" I tell you that you are always the lowest being here. So, you can only choose to obey or destroy!”\n\nThen he gave her a slap in the face, so hard that her ears rang.\"Thank the master for your gift!”\n\nWonder Woman sobs, and the tears blur her eyes. She knew that only obedience could reduce Darren's punishment, although it meant giving up the last glimmer of dignity.\n\nShe shivered, swallowing a little mouthful of semen. The dense, smelly liquid ran through the esophagus and into the stomach bag, bringing a pang of nausea. Wonder Woman couldn't help retching as more semen spilled from her mouth and ran down her neck.\n\n\"Swalit all, or I'll choke you to death here.\"Darren's voice was cold and cruel.\n\nWonder Woman gritted his teeth, swallowed the feeling of vomiting, and swallowed all the liquid in her mouth bit by bit. At last she wiped the filth from her mouth and looked up, her eyes empty and desperate.\n\n\"Good, you did a good job.\"Darren seemed to be in a better mood.\" Come here, I haven't had enough yet.”\n\nWonder Woman obediently climbs to bed and straddles on Darren. Shafully separating her legs, she held Darren's still stiff huge stick, aiming at her own bare bud.\n\n\"Don't be afraid, relax, and sit down slowly.\"Darren smiled badly, his fingers pointing the two red cherries on Wonder Woman's chest.\n\nWonder Woman clenched her lips and felt the thick blade break and squeeze into every inch of her body. She was pale in pain, and her forehead was sweaty, but she was afraid to make Darren angry.\n\n\"Hiss... Clip so tight to do what, relax!\"Darren slapped Wonder Woman's white, round hip flap with discontent.\" Do you want me to go deeper in?”\n\nWonder Woman cried and shook her head. She knew she couldn't escape the abuse and allowed Darren to do whatever she wanted. So she took a deep breath, sank her waist down, and felt the hot, hard edge break through the palace mouth and wedged deep into her body.\n\n\"My goddess, you are so hot and tight that you cut me.\"Darren sighed comfortably, kneading Wonder Woman's elastic breasts.\n\nWonder Woman clenched her lips and endured torn pain, feeling every inch of Darren's entry, as well as the swelling and discomfort of the connection. Soon, however, a strange sense of pleasure arises spontaneously —— that is the body is completely opened, possession of pleasure.\n\n\"Oh...... Good deep...... No......\"Wonder Woman gasped, her path cramuncontrollable, producing a wave of honey.\n\n\"You can't stand it anymore? I have to teach you more.\"Darren evil smiled, holding Wonder Woman's slender waist to push it up.\n\n\"Oh! No, there can't......\"Wonder Woman exclaimed, and Darren's offensive was so fierce that it crashed directly into her delicate flower heart.\n\n\"Is this? Is it very comfortable? Tell me the truth, bitch!\"Darren cursed as he ran through it.\n\n\"That's your true duty, isn't it?\"Darren sneered, looking at Wonder Woman's painful, twisted expression.\" Be my toy, my sex slave, always yielding to a man's desire.”\n\n\"no...... This is not what I want......\"Wonder Woman shook her head, her voice hoarse.\n\n\"It's your immoral thinking, not yourself.\"Darren's fingers played through Wonder Woman's flat abdomen, where it was aching from the invasion of the bone marrow.\"Your body is used to this treatment, and you see how warmly it caters to me.”\n\nWith these words, Darren deliberately straightened up to keep the spaszing path around him. Wonder Woman could hardly groan aloud, and her reason told her that it was wrong, but her body involuntarily chased the pleasure, as if to prove Darren's words.\n\nWonder Woman lies weakly over Darren, going up and down with his rhythm. Her lower abdomen is still in pain, the passage has been friction to the hot, every tap has brought a tearing pain. But even so, her body instinctively yearned for more, greedily devouring Darren's size, as if to incorporate it into her flesh and blood.\n\n\"Move quickly, move by yourself!\"Darren slapped Wonder Woman's plump hip flap angrily,\" Don't let me wait too long, or you know what the consequences will be!”\n\nWonder Woman choked up and she knew Darren was right that she had to please the demon for all it cost. So she clenched her teeth, held her hands on Darren's chest, and began to swing her waist mechanically, leaving the huge blade in and out of her body.\n\n\"Yes, that's it. This you women are for.\"Darren sighed comfortably, admiring the Wonder Woman's face of shame and pain. He deliberately straightened his waist, matching her rhythm, forcing Wonder Woman to moan.\n\nWonder Woman is on the verge of collapse, lying limp, moving mechanically with only a glimmer of will. Darren's dragon ran into her, each time grinding over the delicate inner wall.\n\n\"Well...slow down... I can't do it...\"Wonder Woman groaned and begged, and her tears wet her cheeks.\n\n\"Shut up and move on!\"Darren slapped her on her white hips.\n\n\"Oh!\"Wonder Woman cried out in pain, her fragile body shrank shrank and nearly fell.\n\n\"Uuseful things, it seems that I am too kind to you.\"Darren sneered, and pulled her long hair back.\n\n\"Uh!\"The sharp pain made Wonder Woman scream, and her neck was forced to rise from an exaggerated Angle, exposing her fragile neck muscles.\n\n\"Remember for me, you are my plaything now, and you must be on call!\"Said Darren, close to her ear.\n\nWonder Woman lay on her knees, shaking slightly, tears streaming down her beautiful face. She was once the goddess of Liberty, representing a new age woman of justice and glory. But at this moment, she became the tyrant's plaything and sex slave.\n\n\"Why, unwilling?\"Darren asked jokingly,\" You were enjoying the process, too, didn't you?”\n\nWonder Woman bites her lips and doesn't want to answer the question. Yes, her body does get high, but that doesn't mean her mind is satisfied, too. She is a warrior, a hero, not a tool to please men.\n\n\"speak!\"Darren slapped her in the face impatiently. The ringing sound echoed in the room, Wonder Woman pain shrank, reluctantly opened: \" Please forgive, I volunteered to become your slave......”\n\n\"Ha ha, look at your pathetic pair.\"Darren grinned.\" Since you are so eager to be a slave, do it well!”\n\nWonder Woman rides helplessly on Darren, her strength exhausted and she has to twist her waist with her last glimmer of will. Darren's dragon, still as hard as iron, ran tirelessly inside her.\n\n\"Oh...slow down... Really not good...\"Wonder Woman groaned and begged, her voice crying.\n\n\"Shut up and move on!\"Darren mercilessly grabbed her by the waist and pressed her down.\n\n\"Well!\"The sudden deep top made Wonder Woman scream, and her body bounced and fell again, making a clatcrash.\n\n\"Ha... Ha...\"Wonder Woman gasped for breath, sweat soaked her body, sticky to her white skin. Her movements became slower and weaker, and the passage was already muddy.\n\n\"I said, move on!\"Darren slapped her buttocks dissatisfied, and the clear sound echoed in the air.\n\nWonder Woman shook her hand around Darren's neck, lifted her hips, and carefully moved up and down, trying to please the man.\n\n\"hoot... A little lighter... Really not good...\"She pleaded in a low voice, hoarse.\n\nDarren watched her confusion coldly, and one hand grabbed her soft breast and rubbed it; the other hand held down her thin waist and felt the deformed touch in her hand.\n\n\"You bitch, why pretend to be innocent? Clearly is the grass of the goods!\"He sneered viciously, while twisting a red dogwood on Wonder Woman's chest.\n\n\"Oh!\"The sensitive area was ravaged, Wonder Woman could not help screaming, the tingling current instantly ran through the limbs, let her almost soft in Darren's arms.\n\n\"Ha ha ha, look at you now, just is my sex slave.\"Darren laughed badly,\" You should give up your distorted thoughts early, serve men early, and turn under me.\"\n\nWonder Woman is exhausted and weak in Darren's arms, letting him release it in his body. The hot essence gushed out, straight into the deepest depths of the uterus. The strong stimulation made her climb the peak again, the cave hanged the Darren dragon, a large number of warm love fluid mixed with thick white turbidity from the intersection overflow.\n\nWonder Woman covered her lower abdomen awkwardly, with physiological tears running through the corners of her eyes. She never thought that one day she would lose her last dignity in front of men and completely degenerate into their lust tools.\n\nWonder Woman has lost her ability to answer, and she is into a climax, at the mercy of Darren.\n\nDarren stood up with her in her arms and threw her roughly into the bed. Wonder Woman's head hangs feebly along the edge of the bed, her collarbone covered with ambiguous red marks and a mess between her legs.\n\nWonder Woman collapses in bed, already unresponsive to Darren's touch, and her consciousness gradually sinks into darkness.\n\nAs the first rays of the morning sun shone into the bedroom, Wonder Woman slowly opened her eyes.\n\nEverything last night was not a dream —— she really suffered a terrible assault and abuse. The memory became clear, and every scene and moment were imprinted on her mind, reminding her of the humiliation she had experienced.\n\nWonder Woman shakes on her aching body, and every cell cries for the violence she endured last night. Her privacy was still swollen, covered with finger marks and bruises. Tears came to Wonder Woman's face after remembering how Darren opened her hard and ran through her.\n\nHer body felt as heavy as a piece of iron. The waist still bound her tightly like an iron ring, so that she could hardly feel her waist.\n\nShe tried to sit up, but every cell of her body seemed to be protesting, and every movement seemed to exhaust all her power. Eventually, she was unable to overcome the weakness and fell back to bed.\n\nThoughts began to pour into her mind, and the words and actions of the Duke of Darren last night went into her heart like a sharp knife. His contempt for her, in his disrespect for her, and in a narrow view of her as a woman.\n\nAt that moment, an uncontrollable emotion came to her, and she felt that she was about to collapse. Tears finally broke the limits of the dam, and quietly slipped down.\n\nAs the sun shone gently into the room, a group of maids in old uniforms came in. Their steps were brisk, with delicate combs, brushes and various gorgeous costumes in their hands.\n\nWonder Woman Diana looked at them like a rabbit wrapped in wool, dressing and dressing like depriving her of her dignity again. But she no longer struggled, but just watched calmly, and let the maids dress up for her.\n\nThe maids gently combed her hair and made up her, and made her long hair into a delicate bun. Put those of her \"torture\" on the body, and then put her on a gorgeous French dress. The whole process, she is like a silent puppet.\n\nIn the following days, Duke Darren trained her like a strict coach.\n\nHe taught her how to walk —— is not the kind of free pace, but the kind of attention of every step. He told her how graceful and dignified women should be.\n\nAt the table, the Duke of Darren taught her to use the cutlery, telling her which was a harpoon and which was a spoon. Whenever she made a small mistake, he would sneer and correct her.\n\nThe hardest part is the daily makeup. Those thick foundation, long false eyelashes, and those bright lipstick. Every time she made up, it was like hiding her true self, like hiding the brave Wonder Woman.\n\nAt night, as darkness hung over the castle, cold shone in Darren's eyes of the Duke. He stands in the middle of the bedroom, opposite the bound Wonder Woman —— Her hands, legs and body are tightly bound by her own artifact.\n\n\"Your performance today has really disappointed me.\"Said Darren coldly, and then began to pronounce the spell.\n\nAs the voice of his spell echoes, the artifact on Wonder Woman begins to shine soft, and then slowly contract. Her original war boots have now become high heels, and the matching silk stockings make her legs almost lose the freedom of movement. Every time she tries to move, the heels get tighter, like a cage that binds her feet tightly. She could feel that her toes were pressed white, almost to the edge of the fracture.\n\nHer chest was surrounded by a tight tight waist, and each breath became difficult. Her internal organs seemed to be oppressed to the extreme, and her body seemed to be held tightly by an invisible giant hand.\n\nAs Darren's mantra went faster and faster, her waist, gloves, stockings, heels, and gold crowns began to contract slowly, giving her more pain than she had ever felt before.\n\nHer eyes were tearful, but she never cried out. She clenched her lip tightly and prevented herself from making any sound.\n\nThe pain seemed endless, and her body was constantly oppressed, like a squeezed fruit.\n\nEvery dusk, Darren appears in front of Wonder Woman's bedroom. Whatever she was doing, she would immediately stop, crawl to the ground, and bow respectfully to Darren. \" Master, welcome home.\"\n\nDarren nodded in satisfaction, paced into the bedroom, and came to the bed to looked at her. \" My bitch, ready for my master's favor?\"\n\n'Yes, my master. Allow me to serve you.\"Wonder Woman answered reverently.\n\nSo she crawled carefully up to Darren, took off his trousers, pulled out the huge stiff meat stick from her mouth, and licked it carefully, making a harsh sound of water.\n\nDarren sighed comfortably, rubbing her hair with one hand: \" Good girl, good skill. It seems that practicing every day is a good result.\"\n\nAt the praise, Wonder Woman tried even harder. She learned to relax her throat and let the thick blade penetrate into the inside. Even when the retching was strong, she gritted her teeth until Darren shot into her mouth.\n\nAfter that, she humbly lies down between Darren's legs, letting her master touch and kiss her everywhere, or even maliciously slapping her buttocks and breasts, without resisting or avoiding them.\n\nGradually, she fully accepted her new identity —— a plaything and sex slave that exists only to please her master. As long as Darren gave her order, she was ready to give her all, to bear any humiliation or insult.\n\nEvery day, every day, training, torture, Wonder Woman is close to breaking down. She would serve Darren as much as she could to please him. She would try her best to learn Darren's moral education to reduce the torture of the night, and she would try her best to serve him with the beauty and flesh of her beautiful god.\n\nDespite the luxurious furnishings and gorgeous food in this castle, every day is an endless ordeal for Wonder Woman. Duke Darren continues his \"training\" unremittingly, especially at night, when he tortures her with Wonder Woman's former artifact, bringing her body and mind to the brink of collapse.\n\nWonder Woman's physical strength and shape are indeed gradually changing. Unable to get proper food and exercise, her muscles gradually decreased and she became thinner. The Duke of Darren stood before her, examining with satisfaction the once mighty and now bound and tortured female warrior.\n\nAs the days go by, Wonder Woman gets worse and worse. Those day after day \"training\" and Darren's torture made her become more and more weak, her originally strong muscles and majestic body gradually weakened, become weak as the old age of the big lady.\n\nInside the castle, Darren was increasingly satisfied with his \"masterpiece\". He appreciates the changes of Wonder Woman every day, like a perfect collection. And Wonder Woman's eyes are empty, and they have lost their former elan.\n\n。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。\n\nIn the dungeon, in the dim light, reflected the pale but soft face of Wonder Woman. There was a dull and tense atmosphere in the air.\n\nWonder Woman is hanging in a dark corner of a dungeon, tied almost tightly by her own lose. The golden noose, always a symbol of her justice and truth, is now used as a limit on her freedom.\n\nHer hands crossed overhead, and the hook joined the ceiling of the dungeon. The feet could barely touch the ground, only suspended in the air. The deformed artifacts —— heels, waists and gloves all aggravated her discomfort and made her almost unable to breathe or move.\n\nHer face was pale, and her eyes shone with pain and despair. The original energetic and determined eyes have now faded away. Her mantra bound her to her hands. And on the floor under her feet, Darren was carefully drawing a complex array of magic, drawing every symbol and line very carefully.\n\nWonder Woman's voice trembled slightly. \" Lord Duke, did I do anything wrong?\"Wonder Woman asked anxiously, her voice trembling.\n\nDarren was silent for a moment, holding out her hand to touch her cheeks and hair, and Wonder Woman obediently rubbed his palm like a kitten eager to please her owner.\n\n\"Be patient, my pet. Soon you will understand everything.\"Darren whispered,\" Now, close your eyes and feel what is coming.”\n\nMemories of her past emerge, trying to find out, but all in vain. Her eyes showed a deep confusion and fear.\n\nIn the dark dungeon, the Duke of Darren begins his rite. He approached the lifted Wonder Woman, in a mean way of intimacy, with his hands touching her face and breathing gently brushing her skin. Wonder Woman feels his touch and wants to get close to her master, but the mantra of her voice makes her impossible to move.\n\nSlowly Wonder Woman's body feels a familiar surge of energy under Darren's touch. It was her divine power, recovering again, slowly but clearly. Her breathing began to get fast, and her heart beat gradually accelerated. In the recovery of divine power, Wonder Woman's consciousness gradually clear, she realized her humiliation these days, she struggled to break free from Darren's bondage, but the mantra larose made her helpless.\n\nDarren's kiss fell on her lips, the disgusting feeling made Wonder Woman's anger peak, and she struggled, but the larose tightened, making her resistance fruitless. Still, the divine power in her body surged up, giving her a glimmer of hope.\n\nWonder Woman was still struggling to get out of her imprison. But as Darren dropped kisses on her, a thrill of strange pleasure rose, making her weak.\n\n\"no...stay one's hand... I don't want to be your plaything!\"Wonder Woman gasped, but her voice got a charm.\n\n\"oh? Our game is just beginning.\"Darren smiled a meaningful smile.\" Don't worry, when you taste the ultimate happiness, you won't want to leave me.”\n\nWith that, his fingers flashed through Wonder Woman's bright belly and finally reached the mysterious garden between his legs. It was already muddy and nectar DC.\n\n\"Look, how much your body yearns for me. It already belongs to me.\"Darren's middle finger mercilessly inserted into the warm flower path, inspiring Wonder Woman.\n\nShe tried to concentrate, but her mind was confused. Meanwhile, Darren was still whispering softly in her ears, and his warm breath was sprayed on her neck, making a shudder.\n\n\"Just relax and enjoy it all.\"Darren's fingers pushed through her sweaty hair and slid down her spine to reach the crest of her hips. He kneaded the two elastic pieces of beautiful flesh, making Wonder Woman groan.\n\n\"Well...don't...stay one's hand...\"Wonder Woman is shy, shaking her head desperately to get rid of the erosion of lust. But the lasso tied her wrist, leaving her unable to resist Darren's caress.\n\nDarren felt Wonder Woman's growing body and smiled, a smile that made Wonder Woman feel cold. Darren holds Wonder Woman's slender, deformed waist and holds his dildos into Wonder Woman's already wet stem.\n\nWonder Woman's mood quickly changes from anger to fear under Darren's kiss and touch, as she feels something is wrong. With each contact, her divine powers seem to be drawn and flow to Darren. It was a disturbing finding that both her recovery and strength were used to support Darren.\n\nIn spite of her struggles, her powers grew weakened, rushing to Darren as if drawn by an invisible force. Her eyes were full of despair, her efforts had no effect, and her mantra made her unable to stop it.\n\nWonder Woman keeps trying to break free, but she feels deeper, her power decreasing and Darren's power grows.\n\nWonder Woman feels a constant flow of power in her body flowing into Darren through a connected area, which sends a bit of panic to her heart.\n\n\"no! What're you doing to me!\"She suddenly opened her eyes, and struggled hard.\n\nDarren was not moved, but accelerated the rhythm of the lower body frequency.\"Rest assured, my love, it will only give you greater pleasure.\"He murmured, bending over her sore breast, his tongue licking.\n\n\"Uh......\"The sudden thrill kept Wonder Woman from moaning, and her body played uncontrolled to Darren's movements. Despite the psychological resistance, the thrill of being repeatedly crushed quickly overwhelmed the reason.\n\n\"no!stay one's hand!\"She looked up, her eyes scattered, and her tears slipped uncontrollably.\"I am sacrificing my precious divine power for you to absorb, and you will be punished by God!”\n\n\"Be punished by heaven? Ha ha ha!\"Darren smiled wildly.\" I just want to seize your divine power and make you all my own!”\n\nThen he suddenly flipped over Wonder Woman's body and left her kneeling with her back to him. Then the swollen desire drove in again and began to run through her.\n\n\"Oh! No, too deep......\"Wonder Woman groans helplessly, feeling every inch of her body clamoring for more, but her consciousness remains, which makes her desperate.\n\nDarren turned it ear, grabbing Wonder Woman's slender waist and hitting her more vulnerable more fiercely every time.\"Baby, you are my woman, to always belong to me!”\n\n\"No way to....... I can't be a demon like you......\"Wonder Woman murmured weakly, her tears wetting the ground. But her health had betrayed her, and she was more sensitive and hungry at Darren.\n\n\"You will, because you can't leave me anymore.\"Darren smiled low, and he knew that the victory was already in his hand.\n\nDarren hugged Wonder Woman's soft body and greedily kissed her sweet red lips. At the same time, his hands are also constantly walking on her smooth and delicate skin, touching and kneading her every sensitive belt.\n\n\"Well...don't...stay one's hand...\"Wonder Woman groans feebly, feeling the power in her body flowing down to Darren. The originally powerful body became weak and weak to support, at the mercy of Darren.\n\n\"Good boy, don't be afraid.\"Darren whispered in her ear,\" You should not have these powers than beauty and charm to serve a man.”\n\nAs he gently pressed and rubbed the two snow peaks on Wonder Woman's chest, her thumb rubbing her sore tip.\n\n\"hoot... Don't touch it over there...\"Wonder Woman is too ashamed to keep her legs together. She felt that her consciousness was fading away, replaced by an unconditional attachment and submission to Darren.\n\nDarren's dragon rushes in and out of Wonder Woman's flower path, repeatedly running over her most fragile flower heart. Wonder Woman is weak and can only shake to his rhythm.\n\n\"Oh...slow down... Can't stand it anymore...\"Wonder Woman begged, but Darren turned a deaf ear.\n\n\"No, I want you to devote yourself to this conquest.\"Darren gasped, and sped up.\n\nWith his moves, Wonder Woman feels that the powers in her body are flowing out to Darren. Her power is decaying in visible ways, and Darren seems to have gained more power accordingly.\n\n\"no...stay one's hand... I'll die like this...\"Wonder Woman cried, but Darren remained merciless.\n\n\"Don't worry, I will take good care of you.\"Darren evil smiled,\" You will be my own woman, always by my side.”\n\nThen he picked up Wonder Woman's hips and let her sit in her arms. This pose takes him to an unprecedented depth, and Wonder Woman feels like her insides are completely filled by him.\n\n\"Oh... Good deep...on the point of death...\"Wonder Woman looked up and groaned helplessly, tears wetting her eyelashes. Yet Darren still runs tirelessly through her.\n\n\"Baby, you are so hot inside it it melt me.\"Darren gasped, kneading Wonder Woman's soft crisp milk with one hand and soothing her sensitive lace with the other.\n\nWonder Woman feels a blast of current flowing from her abdomen to her body, and she has never experienced such a violent climax. At that moment, she suddenly felt that the magic power in her body was passing rapidly —— this is the release when she reached the peak.\n\n\"no ——!\"Wonder Woman opened her eyes wide in horror, her hands pushing Darren's chest, but it was too late. She saw a golden glow coming from where the two met, entering Darren's open collar. It was the last of her divine powers, which was now coming to Darren.\n\n\"Ha ha ha, what is delicious!\"Darren laughed excitedly, as he felt his body was rapidly increasing, and Wonder Woman's power was like a nutrient to him, making him stronger.\n\n\"stop! Change me back!\"Wonder Woman roared, but Darren turned a deaf ear. He held on Wonder Woman and prevents her from escaping.\n\nGradually, Wonder Woman feels a sense of emptiness sweeping in. First vision is blurred, then hearing and touch deteriorate. She felt her brain go blank and she was in a trance.\n\n\"no...... What's going on......\"Wonder Woman murmured weakly, trying to stay awake, but unable to resist her weakness. The sight grew darker, the ears were buzzing, and even Darren's hand hung down weakly.\n\n\"It's okay, my dear.\"Darren gently stroked Wonder Woman's long hair,\" you're safe now, it's over. Sleep until you wake up and forget what happened today.”\n\nWith that, he printed a kiss on Wonder Woman's forehead and watched her fall unconscious in her arms and sink into the darkness.\n\n。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。\n\nAt that big dinner party, the Duke of Darren led Wonder Woman into the room, with all eyes gathered on them. The former power and majesty of Wonder Woman no longer exists, replaced by a conquered weakness. Her waist, which was drawn, seemed to break at any time, but it looked very delicate.\n\nDarren put her arms around Wonder Woman's waist, her body close to him. His hand rubbed gently around her waist, and Wonder Woman's face now lost her previous determination, replaced by a look of submission. Her head was bowed, and her eyes were no longer sharp, but full of obedience and tenderness.\n\nEveryone was shocked by this scene. Wonder Woman, as a representative of women, was once strong and powerful, but now she was tamed by Darren, lost her divine power, and became weak and obedient. The dinner became a symbol of the bondage of women in the old times, and a demonstration of the Duke of Darren's victory in his ideas.\n\nAt the dinner party, the Duke of Darren announced his victory, his words echoed through the hall, feeling the Wonder Woman's collapse and submission. Wonder Woman stands beside him, listening to his words, unable to refute or resist, but silently accepting her new character, the conquered woman."
