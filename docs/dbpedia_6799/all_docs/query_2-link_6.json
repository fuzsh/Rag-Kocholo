        "text": "Or what to do when your art college project goes horribly wrong.\n\nIn 2014, three Brighton University art students – Bella Podpadec and Alice Go, both from Somerset, plus Icelander Rakel Mjöll Leifsdottir – were told to produce a performance art project for their course. They hit on the idea of basing it around a fake girl band who worshipped the music of the 1990s: a sort of feminised, indeed feminist, version of ‘This is Spinal Tap’. They chose a carefully ironic name for themselves, as a commentary on society’s objectification of women: “Dream Wife”, after the (surprisingly feminist for the time) 1953, romantic comedy, starring Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. They worked on a visual image and set to, to make a spoof documentary of the band touring Canada. Why Canada? They just had friends there and wanted an excuse to visit. The trio had all been in bands before. Rakel could sing and Go was already an accomplished guitarist, although Podpadec, who was previously another guitar player, had to learn the bass especially for the scheme. They wrote a few songs, produced their project and that should have been that, except for one little snag: the band turned out to be brilliant. As a result, what was once a parody quickly became reality. They now have a recording contract. They tour sold out gigs all over the world. They have released a number of videos, EPs and singles, and at the time of writing their much-awaited full-length debut album, the eponymous ‘Dream Wife’ is newly out.\n\nTheir musical style is often described as Punk. A better description might be guitar led, fast tempo New wave, or Power Pop, but frankly, arguments over exact sub-genres are largely a matter of academic pedantry. What they actually are is brash, noisy, hugely exciting and, above all enormous fun. At the same time, they also understand the importance of dynamics in music, i.e. that if everything is done flat out, then somehow nothing is. As a result even their full-throttle rockers tend to have gentler moments, for example, their anthem to defiance ‘F.U.U.’ (an abbreviation for F**k You Up). Podpadec has cited influences which include the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The Strokes and Gang of Four. It is clear that Bikini Kill is also in there somewhere, along with Patti Smith, Blondie and others.\n\nAs musicians, the three are well matched. Rakel has a vocal range comparable to her phenomenal countrywoman Björk, which ranges from out and out shrieking, to a slightly breathy, almost seductive, sigh. Even when singing, she has a strong Scandinavian accent, which somehow suits the band’s high energy material, and although most of their songs are written in English, she occasionally veers off into Icelandic. Perhaps the strongest determinant of the Dream Wife sound, however, is not, as so often, the singer, but the guitar work of Alice Go. To put it simply, Go is an absolutely superb guitarist, but she is superb in a particularly Dream Wife way. Quite a number of astonishing female guitarists have emerged over the last decade and one could name, for example, Orianthi Panagaris, Marissa Paternoster of the Screaming Females, or Annie Clark (St. Vincent), but these women tend to have one thing in common: towering, blistering solos. Paternoster’s solo in the joint Screaming Females/Garbage recording of Patti Smith’s ‘Because the Night’ is a breathtaking case in point, for example (play from 3:37), whilst St. Vincent’s 2015 re-worked live version of one of her own early song ‘Your lips are red‘ (play from 8:55) mixes vocals and solo guitar in a way that squeezes every last ounce of emotion from what is, in reality, an inherently quite limited instrument. Dream Wife, however, is very much an ensemble piece where showy soloing would somehow seem out of place. Instead, Go’s playing is a relentless series of hard-edged, quick fire and discordant riffs (which often span more than one octave), mixed with power chords. Her playing is quite distinctive and instantly recognisable. It is not a million miles from Keith Richard’s early work with the Rolling Stones, but only in its constantly shifting patterns. Her sound and style are all her own, and on recordings, she tends to be set high up in the mix to be on at least equal terms with the vocals. Interestingly, her choice of guitar is far from conventional, but perfectly suits her playing. In recent years, a return of strident, jangly guitar tones has seen a resurgence of interest in 1960s models, most notably the legendary, but once largely shunned, Fender ‘Jaguar’. Go, however, has gone for a Burns ‘Marquee’. Burns was a classic British make, and the ‘Marquee’ was highly distinctive for its violin like scroll ended headstock. But production ended in 1970 and original guitars in good condition now fetch silly money from collectors. However, like the ‘Jag’ a renewal of interest has brought the model back into production, under the business name of Burns London Ltd. Both right and left-handed models are available and Go, who is left-handed, uses two of the latter. If anything the ‘Marquee’ sounds even more ‘Jag’ than a ‘Jaguar’, with its three single coil pickups tuned, and angled to emphasise a brasher, more treble-heavy character that perfectly suits Go’s jarring style, and she further enhances this effect by picking very close to the bridge, which always adds extra bite. To this writer, however, the design also has another plus: the guitar not only sounds wonderful, it also looks gorgeous, especially the white version. As a guitar player myself, and having heard Go play hers, oh how I want one (although Santa please note: I am right handed).\n\nInterestingly, Go even plays air guitar left-handed, as can be seen on the video for ‘Kids‘, where she plays mock guitar on a tennis racket. The video also shows the band looking a lot more pink and feminine than their usual more aggressive punk personas.\n\nCompared with her bandmates, Podpadec’s role on bass, at first sight, seems relatively subdued, and it is true that she is often set well down in the mix. Closer listening, however, reveals just how vital she is. On occasions when she is more to the fore, her driving playing style becomes clear, but even when she is less prominent, she thickens and balances the band’s overall sound, which would otherwise be almost unbearably high pitched and grating. A classic example might be ‘Fire‘, a song in which Go’s guitar playing is at its most discordant. Listen to the song, and then try to imagine it without the bass. It would not be pretty. She is also a source of constant visual variety. The other two are blondes, but Podpadec is a woman of, shall we say, no fixed hair colour, and has also developed a tendency to shave ever more of her head. She plays right-handed, which has given the band one of its in-built iconic images, as they tend to play with Rakel in the centre, left-handed Go on her right and Podpadec on her left, so that the headstocks of the two guitars point outwards. This gives something of a starburst effect, a simple enough motif, but one which has been used to great effect in their videos. This is particularly well seen in the one for ‘Somebody‘, where they are filmed strongly backlit, but the image has become such a band trademark that in the video for ‘Hey Heartbreaker‘ they are portrayed as three cartoon robots and are still immediately recognisable.\n\nFinally, the band does have a token man. All female (and all bassist) band Kite Base claim a male band member in their drummer Oscar. But Oscar is actually a drum machine. Dream Wife go one better and have a real life male human on drums: Alex Paveley (yet another blond). He replaces their original stand-in drummer, Alice Go’s father, Troy Corner, who played on their debut EP (named simply “EP01”), which was a DIY affair recorded at her parents’ house.\n\nThe band’s lyrics range from the outright sexual ‘Let’s make out‘, to the powerful feminist anthem ‘Somebody’ with its refrain of “I am not my body; I am somebody”. As Go has said in an interview for the ‘Independent‘: “We’re three women in our 20s, this is what we know and these are our experiences. Ultimately this is where we’re at. We’re women: it’s noisy, it’s angry, it’s sensitive, it’s sentimental, it’s nostalgic … lyrically and musically it’s showing the different faces of women. We don’t fit into a mould of what people think a woman in music should be.” At the same time, although strongly feminist, the band are neither po-faced nor puritanical about it. They are not afraid to wear lipstick or low cut evening dresses on the video for ‘Let’s make out’, for example, although there is clearly an element of irony in both. They simply own and take an open joy in their own sexuality in a way that a previous generation of feminists might have found slightly distasteful or even disloyal.\n\nDream Wife’s live shows are noted for their exuberance, and for drawing in the audience to the point of becoming parties. They even used to form a human pyramid on stage during songs, until their music became too complex to play whilst doing so. Their wider artistry means that their shows are also often filled with handmade props and sets modelled after space themes, or even haunted graveyards. Indeed, one of their problems in recording their material has been the difficulty of recapturing the sheer zest and electrifying energy of these shows. As Podpadec said in an interview with ‘Dork’s’ Jessica Goodman “We want you to cry, we want you to dance, and we want you to scream at the world”. Famously, the band are determined to ensure that their gigs are safe spaces for women and young girls and, in particular, that women should be safe from unwelcome groping and sexual harassment from other audience members (something they describe as happening to them as teenagers). In addition to working with venue security and organisations like ‘Girls Against’, a tight clique of female Dream Wife fans has developed who proudly call themselves the ‘Bad Bitch Club’ as a cry of empowerment to turn a misogynist insult around. They are not a club in any formal sense, but they help the band protect others during gigs. There is even a relying cry in the song ‘F.U.U.’ with its repeated refrain “I spy with my little eye, Bad Bitches” and as Rakel told Jessica Goodman “It’s just so incredible being able to play to both young girls and teenagers and any age, and them to feel perfectly safe at a gig and to emphasise that with all these bad bitches. These bad bitches can take you down!”\n\n‘Dream Wife’ is a superb debut album by an extremely gifted band who, in addition to their considerable musical talent, have the artistic skills needed to properly shape and control their own broader image. They are musically a positive gust of fresh air and they also clearly care deeply about their audience, both their enjoyment and their safety, which cannot help but win them friends. This band are not going to be big. They are going to be huge, and rightly so.\n\nUpdate: Autumn 2020.\n\n2020 saw the release of Dream Wife’s much awaited second album: ‘So when you gonna …’ (Lucky Number, CD, vinyl LP and digital download, running time 40:27).\n\nSecond albums are often referred to in terms of “that difficult second album”, and certainly this one is very different from its predecessor. That said the cover art shows a typically boisterous ‘Dream Wife’ pose and the album starts with a typical Alice Go, style spiky guitar riff-driven track: ‘Sports!’, with Rakel’s vocal riding the guitar like surf. The only slight departure being that the guitar briefly impersonates a banjo (rather effectively) towards the end.\n\nFrom now on though, it becomes clear that the band’s song-writing has changed significantly. Things become more gentle, and from time to time, notably in second track ‘Hasta la vista’, Rakel’s voice loses its hard edge and takes on something of the more girlish feel of Catatonia’s Cerys Matthews. The result makes the childhood home movies of the trio in the accompanying video more than apt, with an infant Podpadec looking particularly cute, hurtling round a beach in nappies.\n\nThird track, ‘Homesick’ is perhaps a little more classic rock in feel and has Rakel’s voice back at the scream, belting out powerful lyrics about sexual roles. The track also shows something of the way Podpadec has come on as a bass player. This is evident throughout the record, although the recording generally gives her a rather bloomy ‘strings need replacing’ sound which detracts.\n\nRakel and Bella (photo Hera Says Team).\n\nFourth track, ‘Validation’ is particularly bass driven and returns to the growing theme of gentleness, as does track five, ‘Temporary’ which is almost a Calypso at times, especially on the guitar, which could hardly be further from Go’s usual style, while half way marker ‘U do U’ could almost be early Sixties in its gentle feel, vocal harmonies and tremolo electric guitar, mixed with acoustic.\n\n‘RHRN‘ (Right here right now) sees a return of the Cerys Matthews voice and again has a more powerful Classic Rock feel, especially in the guitar and drums (which shine). Podpadec’s bass is also at its best here. The track builds to an impressive finale, with multi-tracked voices and it is probably the strongest song on the record.\n\nTrack eight, ‘Old Flame’ is a complete departure for the band, unlike anything they’ve done before, with a 1980s pulsating synth-pop sound, and little in the way of guitar until the second half. That’s not a criticism. It’s actually a rather nice track. It’s just very different to the usual ‘Dream Wife’ fare.\n\nThe title track ‘So when you gonna …’ though, is a real blast from the past: a rocker with Go’s guitar at its majestic and complex best, if oddly set rather down in the mix. Rakel’s hard edged vocals are back, belting out sexually explicit lyrics, apparently to a non-binary lover (and with a twist at the end), backed by driving drums and bass, to make it one to treasure.\n\n‘Hold on me’ is an account of illicit sex behind a lover’s back, with a slight traditional Japanese feel to the music, mixed with echoed guitar that sounds almost ‘Tangerine Dream’. Again the bass shines.\n\nThe closing track, ‘After the Rain’ is another departure for the band. It’s a profoundly gentle and beautiful ballad, with the vocal set over first just piano, with guitar fading in later. Yet despite its tender calm, the lyrics carry a powerful feminist message of the sort that has always lain at the core of the band, with the chorus:\n\n“It’s my choice, my life. It’s my will my sacrifice. It’s my body, my right, not for others to decide.”\n\nThis second album shows huge development in the band both as musicians and songwriters. This might be said to be ‘Dream Wife’ grown up, with a greater versatility and willingness to experiment with different styles. Their song-writing has matured and they have learned that things don’t always have to run flat out all the time. Yet they might not yet have found quite the right compromise. At present we were able to enjoy the greater subtlety and complexity of some of the material, but we did miss the freshness and excitement of the first album, not to mention the sheer genius of songs like ‘Somebody’.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, there are great songs here too, including the serene ‘After the Rain’, and certainly this is a still a good album. We were just left with the feeling that it’s not as good as this band will eventually prove capable of. They have a great singer, a great bassist and one of the best guitarists on Earth, so it ought to be a breeze!\n\nUpdate: 16th June, 2023.\n\nWhere Dream Wife’s eponymous first album was brash, raw and exhilarating, their second, ‘So When You Gonna’ took an often gentler approach. So we were fascinated to see what direction their third, ‘Social Lubrication’ would take.\n\nIn the event, with guitarist Alice Go as producer, we get music closer to their first than their second album, but with a difference. All the old verve and excitement is back. Much of the music follows a frenetic pace, which makes it a joy from start to finish. And yet there are also clear signs of a band maturing, with a growing sophistication to their song writing and musicianship. Plus there’s a still greater emotional openness, even from a band who’ve never been exactly bashful about spelling out what they mean.\n\nThe energised spirit is obvious from the opening track ‘Kick in the Teeth’, which has Go’s guitar at its spikiest, heavy bass and powerful vocals. The bass playing is particularly interesting. Podpadec is often mixed quite low on much of the album, but not here. Elsewhere though, you only have to listen closely to hear the contribution they make. You might not immediately hear the bass, but you’d sure as hell notice if it wasn’t there.\n\n‘Who Do You Wanna Be?’ is a fiercely anti patriarchy track with thoughtful lyrics, but backed by Go at her most aggressive as a guitarist. ‘Hot (Don’t Date a Musician)’, on the other hand, is a wonderfully self-mocking piece, satirising the obsessive, competitive, if often insecure nature of so many in music, punctuated by guitar lines which range from the staccato to near Metal power-chording.\n\nThe title track, ‘Social Lubrication’ is another feminist anthem which particularly singles out music industry sexism, with lyrics like: “What’s it like to be a woman in music, Dear? You’d never ask me that if you regarded me as your peer.” The vocals are partly speak-sing, supported by growling bass and high speed pulsating guitar.\n\n‘Mascara’, provides a rather gentler interlude with a simple guitar strum behind darker, deeper pitched vocals and lyrics which comment on romanticism, if with the pace picking up towards a climactic ending.\n\n‘Leech’ is political feminist Rock at its most powerful. And for us it’s the album’s stand-out track, with speak-sing vocals, relentless palm-muted guitar and pulsating bass. In sentiment it sort of echoes Alanis Morissette’s ‘Right Through You’. It deals with Leeches of the human kind: the ones who suck the life out of others, abuse power, exploit or act inappropriately towards others and especially young women. As the lyrics say, via screamed vocals: “The Leech is out for blood. They won’t stop till they get every drop”. The song positively spits defiance. It’s just so depressing that this still needs saying, almost 30 years after Morissette’s masterpiece. But it does.\n\n‘I Want You’, on the other hand, is an unashamed hymn in praise of sex, with riffy guitar, raw vocals and a tremendous sense of fun. ‘Curious’, meanwhile, is a more downbeat and thoughtful exploration of the sexual, which takes a glance at same-sex and polyamorous relationships.\n\n‘Honestly’ by way of a change of mood, is a truly beautiful song about the sweetness of the familiar, with Go’s guitar shining echoey and atmospheric, with Mjöll’s voice at its most yearning. It makes a wonderful contrast with the more high-powered tracks without in any way seeming out of place. In fact it’s another stand-out track.\n\nFinally, ‘Orbit’ is one of those slightly oddball songs which will still strike a chord with many, especially if you’ve ever had that uncanny feeling that you may have known someone much longer than you have. You might even have known them in a past life and though they might be your lover now, who knows what they could have been before. And all with Go’s most complex guitar playing on the record. It makes the perfect closer.\n\n‘Social Lubrication’ shows a band at the height of its creative powers. In our view at least, it’s Dream Wife’s best yet. They have continued to grow as musicians as well as, as writers. We’ve already commented on Podpadec’s bass playing and while we’ve always loved Go’s guitar style, there is a greater variety here too, yet with no self indulgence. Indeed she’s not afraid to keep things very spare and simple when it fits, which can be a difficult ego-wrestle to win.\n\nMjöll’s vocal style has matured in emotional range and become a good deal more adventurous. We still hear her trademark shrill screams, which go all the way back to songs like ‘Let’s Make Out’. But she now gives us broader tones, from the glowing, deeper pitched ‘Honestly’ to an almost Cerys Matthews tinge in ‘Orbit’.\n\nAs usual with Dream Wife, the album has many serious points to make and the band never forget their feminist roots. At the same time they’re never po-faced about their politics. The music is always great fun. Nor are they afraid of the idea that a feminist woman can still celebrate sexuality. There are even little in jokes to see if you get them. For example, Dream Wife have broken with their previous tradition of having a B&W band photo on the cover. This time we get a sea of reds, with a beautiful orchid as the focus, except that the flower has a somewhat gynaecological look. Talk about hiding in plain sight. It’s a lovely little humorous touch.\n\nThis is a glorious record by a brilliant band. It’s fun, exciting, angry yet joyous and still always thought provoking. We love it.\n\nHera Says."
