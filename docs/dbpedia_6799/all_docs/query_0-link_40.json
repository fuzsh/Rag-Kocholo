        "text": "The theme of dreams is introduced at the start of the book through Georgeâs description to Lennie of the farm that they hope one day to own together. They continue to discuss this throughout the text, with Candy also becoming involved and making it finally seem possible. This dream is very important to the men because it represents freedom and having control over their own lives, which they do not have while moving around looking for work.\n\nDreams in Of Mice and Men are linked to the âAmerican Dreamâ. This is the idea that in America, it is possible for anyone to achieve success and improve their lives through hard work. This is linked to the United States Declaration of Independence which states that âall men are created equalâ. For the men on the ranch in Of Mice and Men, having dreams gives them some hope that their hard work will be rewarded. Curleyâs wife also has a dream â to be a film star â and although she no longer has any real hope that this could come true, it gives her a distraction from the unhappiness of her life, which is also true of dreams for the other characters.\n\nSure,â said George. âAll kinâs a vegetables in the garden, and if we want a little whisky we can sell a few eggs or something, or some milk. Weâd jusâ live there. Weâd belong there. There wouldnât be no more runninâ round the country and gettinâ fed by a Jap cook. No, sir, weâd have our own place where we belonged and not sleep in no bunk house.\n\nAll George and Lennie are really hoping for is described here: a place where they feel they belong and do not have to leave. These are the things that are missing from their lives, showing that the reason they need the dream is to have some hope that their lives may improve. However, despite the simplicity of their dream, the way that George recounts this like a bed-time story or folk tale suggests that it will never really come true and they need to talk about it as a comfort rather than as a real plan.\n\n[Candy] said miserably, You seen what they done to my dog tonight? They says he wasnât no good to himself nor nobody else. When they can me here I wisht somebodyâd shoot me. But they wonât do nothing like that. I wonât have no place to go, anâ I canât get no more jobs.\n\nCandy asks George and Lennie if he can be a part of their plan to buy their own farm because he feels like he does not have a value on the ranch as he is ageing and will be unable to continue working. Like George and Lennie, he aspires to have somewhere he belongs and a permanent home. Crooks also wants to escape his miserable life on the ranch and sees George and Lennieâs dream as his only opportunity for this. On the ranch, Crooks is isolated and continually experiences racism. Both Crooks and Candy see the dream as a way out of their otherwise inescapable unhappiness. However, Crooks immediately realises how futile this hope is and Candy understands at the end of the book that it was never really possible.\n\nI tell you I ainât used to livinâ like this. I coulda made somethinâ of myself.â She said darkly, âMaybe I will yet.â And then her words tumbled out in a passion of communication, as though she hurried before her listener could be taken away. âI lived right in Salinas,â she said. âCome there when I was a kid. Well, a show come through, anâ I met one of the actors. He says I could go with that show. But my olâ lady wouldnâ let me. She says because I was onây fifteen. But the guy says I coulda. If Iâd went, I wouldnât be livinâ like this, you bet.\n\nCurleyâs wife is focused on how her life could have been if she had been an actress, showing how her dream is a type of escapism for her. Curleyâs wifeâs dream is different to George and Lennieâs because hers is grander; however, the dreams are similar in that the characters rely on them as a way of coping with the difficulties in their lives.\n\nGeorge said softly, âI think I knowed from the very first. I think I knowed weâd never do her. He usta like to hear about it so much I got to thinking maybe we would.\n\nCrooks was scornful. I seen hunderds of men come by on the road anâ on the ranches, with their bindles on their back anâ that same damn thing in their heads. Hunderds of them. They come, anâ they quit anâ go on; anâ every damn one of âemâs got a little piece of land in his head. Anâ never a God damn one of âem ever gets it.\n\nCrooksâ comments remind the reader of how George and Lennieâs dream is not unusual for men like them: many others are also dreaming of a better life. This is linked to the idea of the American Dream as they believe that by working hard and saving up, they will be able to achieve the success they hope for. However, George realises at the end of the novel that his plans with Lennie really were just a dream; they would never have come true. This suggests that the dreams that men like them held during this period in America were hopeless."
