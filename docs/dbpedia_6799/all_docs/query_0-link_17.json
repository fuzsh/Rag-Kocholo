The portrayal of language use is wonderfully nuanced. It clearly demonstrates that while expressing the most vital sentiments in our lives, it is crucial to select the right vernacular. In the late-night bar scene, where all three characters finally come together for a drink, superficially, it appears as light chatter. Only those familiar with all the languages spoken in the scene are able to understand that, in this very moment, hearts are quietly breaking.\n\nPersonally, what this move says to me is that the confines of our language define the confines of our worlds. And that the more languages we speak, the more worlds we carry within ourselves. While some other worlds may remain forever closed to us, and we will never be able to access them. With certain people in our lives, we use specific language; with others, we employ a different one, giving each relationship its unique climate. Falling in love with someone from another country usually means falling in love with their entire culture. It expands our worlds and broadens our horizons immeasurably. But sometimes, the perpetual sense of being a foreigner in someone else’s world may eventually become unbearable\n\nThe meaning of every message is likely to vary depending on the language in which it is expressed. Even if you’re multilingual, you most likely swear in your mother tongue. Some utterances just come out as a reaction, unwittingly. What language would you use to say ‘I love you’ to your foreign lover? Would you say it in your own language or theirs? What language do you pray in? And which one do you speak in your dreams? I’m sure you can see where I’m coming from here. Some facets of our worlds and certain corners of our souls will always retain their assigned dialects, regardless of how far we walk away from our origins in life."
