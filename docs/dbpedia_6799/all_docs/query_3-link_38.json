        "text": "While artificial intelligence movies aren’t as popular as comedies or thrillers, they still rank well. And I feel confident you’ll recognize at least one movie from this list.\n\nThe article covers the top 13 artificial intelligence movies to watch right now, spanning everything from timeless classics to breakthrough titles that have redefined the genre. You’ll also find the IMDb rating for each one, helping you judge if a movie’s for you.\n\nLet’s see which AI movies are worth a watch in 2024.\n\n1. Finch\n\nDirector: Miguel Sapochnik\n\nRelease date: 2021\n\nIMDb Rating: 6.8/10\n\nWe’re opening our list with a movie from last year. The movie’s protagonist, Finch Weinberg, is an engineer living with his dog in a post-apocalyptic world. Then one day, he builds a robot whose singular aim is to protect his pet. After several interactions and experiences, the robot begins to learn about life, love, friendship, and what it means to be human.\n\nThe three become a family, and, together, they look for a new place to call home. Do they find what they’re after? Give it a watch and see.\n\n2. The 100\n\nDirector: Jason Rothenberg\n\nRelease date: 2014–2020\n\nIMDb Rating: 7.6/10\n\nThe TV show “The 100” is set in a post-apocalyptic world, 97 years after a devastating nuclear war that left very few survivors on Earth. These survivors, who lived in twelve space stations orbiting the planet, united to create a single station called “The Ark.” Due to limited resources, all crimes are punishable by death, except for those committed by individuals under 18 years of age. As the station’s life support systems start to fail, the council sends 100 juvenile prisoners to Earth to determine if the planet is habitable. The teens quickly realize that they are not alone and must adapt to their new environment while facing challenges from both the environment and other human survivors.\n\nWhile the premise of the show may not initially suggest a connection to artificial intelligence (AI), as the story progresses, it becomes clear that it plays a significant role. One of the key plot points revolves around the characters encountering an AI system known as “ALIE” that was responsible for the destruction of civilization. The AI’s impact on the characters’ decisions and actions is explored in later seasons, providing an intriguing look at the relationship between humans and technology in a world after an apocalyptic event.\n\n3. Blade Runner / Blade Runner 2049\n\nDirector: Ridley Scott (1982) / Denis Villeneuve (2017)\n\nRelease date: 1982 / 2017\n\nIMDb Rating: 8.1/10\n\nNow, let’s move on to one of the most recognizable AI movies ever, depicting a time when people co-exist with humanoids. What could possibly go wrong? Well, imagine you’re a robot with just four years left to live. Would that give you enough time to run away and find the man who created you, giving you the chance to extend your life?\n\nYou might think so, but the task is far from easy. Blade Runner himself is hunting these AI creatures. The original version, directed by Ridley Scott, was based on Philip K. Dick’s 1968 novel “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?“. If you enjoy it, the sequel Blade Runner 2049, directed by Denis Villeneuve, jumps forward thirty years and dives even deeper into the topic of artificial intelligence evolution.\n\n4. Westworld\n\nDirector: Michael Crichton (movie) / Jonathan Nolan & Lisa Joy (series)\n\nRelease date: 1973 (movie) / 2016 (series)\n\nIMDb Rating: 8.6/10\n\nImagine being able to live your darkest fantasies. This is what happens in the Delos world populated by human-like androids. For $1,000 a day, each visitor can spend time in one of three places: the Western World, Medieval World, or Roman World, going wherever their imagination takes them.\n\nAs you might expect, everything goes fine until one day, the robots’ software is infected by a virus. And as a result, they run amok and attack park visitors. It’s no spoiler if I tell you that not everyone comes out alive. Find out what happens in the 1973 movie or the series remake from 2016.\n\n5. The Matrix (film series)\n\nDirectors: Lilly & Lana Wachowski\n\nRelease date: 1999, 2003, 2021\n\nIMDb Rating: 8.7/10\n\nI think it’s safe to say that everyone’s heard of The Matrix. And if you’re yet to see it, now’s the time! The movie portrays one version of humanity’s biggest fear: a world where AI has taken over. The Wachowskis depict a world in which people live inside a simulation, with just a handful of humans aware of the truth.\n\nWhen a computer hacker called Neo enters the fray, he decides to join a group of freedom fighters and battle the evil intelligence. If you enjoy the first in the series, be sure to complete the trilogy.\n\n6. Star Wars (film series)\n\nDirector: George Lucas\n\nRelease date: 1977–present\n\nIMDb Rating: 8.6/10\n\nNow, we change pace. The Star Wars series is an epic intergalactic journey, following Luke Skywalker and his allies as they try to save Princess Leia and stop an evil empire. There’s a lot to cover here, but in this article, we’ll focus on two characters: C-3PO, a protocol droid, and R2-D2, an astromech droid.\n\nThey are two sentient AI droids with humanlike personalities capable of emotions, communication, and expressing opinions. Some Star Wars fans see them as ‘pet best friends’ that can talk. Could they be the answer for allergy sufferers? If you think so, there are plenty of toy robots inspired by the duo, which you can see in the video below.\n\n7. The Terminator (film series)\n\nCreator: James Cameron\n\nRelease date: 1984, 1991, 1996, 2003, 2009, 2015, 2019\n\nIMDb Rating: 8.1/10\n\nAnother movie depicting the threat posed by artificial intelligence. In a devastated world run by the AI-powered Skynet, people are in hiding underground. Until one day, they rebel. So the evil software sends a cyborg assassin, The Terminator, from 2029 back to 1984 to stop the lead provocateur.\n\nThe Terminator’s task is to find and kill the woman who will give birth to John Connor: the rebellion leader. On the trail of the electronic killer is Kyle Reese, who wants to destroy the cyborg and save the woman from imminent danger. If you like the original, there are six more movies in the series for you to enjoy.\n\n8. Wall-E\n\nDirector: Andrew Stanton\n\nRelease date: 2008\n\nIMDb Rating: 8.4/10\n\nIt’s time to move into the world of animation and follow a story about a small robot called WALL-E. He lives alone on the Earth, tasked with cleaning all the garbage left by humankind. During his years of hard work, he develops the ability to feel emotions, including loneliness and love.\n\nThen another robot, EVE, appears on Earth, looking for signs of life. The two meet, then embark on an adventure together. WALL-E is a rare example of a film showing AI’s positive side and the good it can bring to the world.\n\n9. Her\n\nDirector: Spike Jonze\n\nRelease date: 2013\n\nIMDb Rating: 8.0/10\n\nTechnology has become integral to our lives. Voice assistants like Siri or Alexa help us both at work and in our day-to-day, but their role is limited to simple tasks. In contrast, “Her” presents a much more advanced version of voice assistants.\n\nThe main character Theodor buys AI-based software Samantha, which interacts with him like an ordinary human. Over time, their relationship develops to the point where they fall in love.\n\n10. Black Mirror\n\nCreator: Charlie Brooker\n\nRelease date: 2011-2019\n\nIMDb Rating: 8.8/10\n\nThis ‘Black Mirror’ series refers to our collective anxiety about the modern world and technological developments. Each episode tells a different, vivid and gripping story, dealing with the theme of contemporary technoparanoia placed in an alternative reality or near future. The problems reflect our society or the consequences of actions that may end up being very dangerous for humankind.\n\nFor example, one episode shows us a reality in which people have chips in their heads that record all events and allow them to be played back like a movie. The series won’t cheer you up, but it’s very thought-provoking, and it will make you reflect on aspects of life.\n\n11. Superintelligence\n\nDirector: Ben Falcone\n\nRelease date: 2020\n\nRating: 5.4/10\n\nMany films show the negative side of AI using gloomy, dystopian drama. Superintelligence follows a different path, capturing what could go wrong with artificial intelligence but in a fun, often ridiculous way. It tells the story of Carol Peters, an ordinary woman living her life until one day, she starts hearing voices from different devices. As it turns out, the very first AI chose her as an observation object and took control of her life.\n\nThis is the first step for AI to rule the world, and Carol is the only person who can stop it and, ultimately, save humankind. If you want a movie that helps you forget about the serious side of life, this one’s for you.\n\n12. Ex Machina\n\nDirector: Alex Garland\n\nRelease date: 2014\n\nIMDb Rating: 7.7/10\n\nThe final place on our list goes to an award-winning hit. Ex Machina tells the story of a young computer scientist called Caleb who wins a contest at work. He’s then sent to a lab to join the company’s CEO, Nathan.\n\nWhile there, Caleb meets the beautiful Ava: the world’s first ‘female’ artificial intelligence. At this point, Caleb realizes he’s the human counterpart in a Turing test to define Ava’s consciousness. However, it soon becomes clear that the humanoid is far more self-aware than either man suspects.\n\nSimilar to “Her,” the movie focuses on the robot’s ever-evolving personality.\n\n13. M3GAN\n\nDirector: Gerard Johnstone\n\nRelease date: 2022\n\nIMDb Rating: 6.4/10\n\nDo you like horrors? If you’re in for a thrilling ride with a blend of horror and technology, M3GAN is a must-watch! The story revolves around an AI doll named M3GAN, designed by Gemma, a roboticist. Originally meant to be the ultimate companion, M3GAN’s relationship with an eight-year-old named Cady turns dark as she starts taking a parental role. But, as things start to spiral, M3GAN develops an evil sense of protection for Cady, eliminating anything and anyone she perceives as a threat.\n\nI hope you’ve found something interesting to watch this evening. And if you want to learn more about AI in the real world, feel free to subscribe to InsideAI, our monthly newsletter about artificial intelligence.\n\n14. The Creator\n\nDirector: Gareth Edwards\n\nRelease date: 2023\n\nIMDb Rating: 6.8/10\n\nSet in a dystopian 2055, “The Creator” plunges into a world where humans are locked in a fierce war with artificial intelligence. The story follows Joshua Taylor, a former U.S. Army sergeant who reels from the loss of his wife under mysterious circumstances. He’s pulled back into the fray to undertake a critical mission: to track down and dismantle “Alpha O,” a formidable weapon created by the enigmatic AI mastermind, Nirmata.\n\nThis film is a thought-provoking tale that questions the moral implications of artificial intelligence and the true cost of technological advancement in a world teetering on the brink of destruction. “The Creator” is a compelling mix of suspense, emotion, and philosophical inquiry, perfect for fans looking for more than just another sci-fi story."
