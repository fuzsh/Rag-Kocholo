        "text": "While scientists have been studying dreams for years, the images that appear while we snooze are still incredibly misunderstood.\n\nWhen asleep, our minds are active, creating stories and images that can be either vivid or fleeting; nonsensical or seemingly prophetic; terrifying or absolutely mundane.\n\nWhy do we dream? We may not have definitive answers, but there are several types of dreams and themes, and different factors that cause these dreams to occur.\n\nAccording to the National Sleep Foundation, we typically dream about four to six times per night. There’s no way, you might be thinking, but that’s only because we forget more than 95 percent of all dreams.\n\nDreaming happens throughout the night, but our most vivid and often remembered dreams happen during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.\n\nA dream can be influenced by what we’re thinking about before we go to sleep, or what we’ve experienced in our waking day. Dreams can also bring to light what we’re avoiding thinking about or our anxieties.\n\nAccording to research, 65 percent of the elements of dreams are associated with your experiences while awake.\n\nIf you’ve got job stress, your dreams might take place at work or involve your co-workers. If you just went on a date, your dream might be full of romance, or on the flip side, heartbreak, if you’re having anxiety about dating someone new.\n\nA “standard” dream will vary depending on the individual, but below are some features of dreams:\n\nMost dreams are predominantly visual, meaning that images are at the forefront of dreams, rather than other senses like smell or touch.\n\nWhile most people dream in color, some dreams are entirely in black and white.\n\nThe less stressed you are, the more pleasant your dreams may be.\n\nDreams can be very strange — and that’s totally normal.\n\nYour mood, events in the news, pain, violence, and religion may all influence your dream’s subject.\n\nNightmares are dreams that are scary or disturbing. Almost everyone has nightmares from time to time and there’s not always a good reason why.\n\nSome potential causes of nightmares include:\n\nwatching or reading something scary\n\nsleep deprivation\n\neating right before bed\n\nmedication side effects\n\nhaving a fever or being ill\n\nsleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, nightmare disorder, or narcolepsy\n\nPeople experiencing a lot of stress or who have mental health conditions like anxiety disorders may experience dreams that are more frightening. Up to 71 percent of people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may experience nightmares, which can be recurring if not treated.\n\nOne study found that the three most common nightmare themes involved:\n\ndeath or dying\n\nphysical violence\n\nbeing chased or hunted\n\nNight terrors are a type of sleep disorder that’s more common in children than adults.\n\nWhen someone has a night terror, they wake up terrified but may only have a vague idea of what they dreamed about. Most of the time, they don’t remember dreams from the night terror.\n\nIn a night terror, a person can wake up:\n\nscreaming\n\nkicking or moving violently, even jumping out of bed\n\nsweating\n\nbreathing hard\n\nwith a racing heart rate\n\ndisoriented and unsure where they are or what’s going on\n\nNight terrors aren’t technically a type of dream, but a sleep disorder.\n\nWhat’s the difference between a nightmare and night terror?\n\nNight terrors most commonly happen during non-REM sleep, while nightmares typically happen during REM sleep.\n\nNight terrors are much more common in children, who experience more non-REM sleep, while nightmares can affect those at any age.\n\nNightmares are often vividly recalled dreams while night terrors are easily forgotten.\n\nLucid dreaming means you’re aware that you’re dreaming while you’re in the dream. Like most dreams, it often happens during REM sleep.\n\nMost people don’t have frequent lucid dreams, though some research reports that 55 percent of people experience it at least once in their lives.\n\nSometimes you can control a lucid dream if you have practice. This can help you control your dreams, especially if you tend to have recurring dreams or nightmares.\n\nDaydreams\n\nThe main difference between a daydream and all other types of dreams is that you’re awake during a daydream.\n\nDaydreams occur consciously, but you may still feel like you’re not fully awake or aware of your surroundings. If someone catches you daydreaming, they may say that you look “zoned out” or lost in thoughts.\n\nDaydreams usually involve other people, whether real or imagined. Some research has shown that daydreaming about people you know predicts positive well-being while daydreaming about people you aren’t close to can predict more loneliness and worse well-being.\n\nRecurring dreams\n\nRecurring dreams are dreams that repeat more than once. They often have themes such as confrontations, being chased, or falling.\n\nYou can have neutral recurring dreams or recurring nightmares. If you have recurring nightmares, it may be due to an underlying mental health condition, substance use, or certain medication.\n\nCommon themes in recurring dreams involve:\n\nbeing attacked or chased\n\nfalling\n\nbeing frozen with fear\n\nFalse awakenings\n\nFalse awakenings are a type of dream occurrence where a person believes they’ve woken up but actually haven’t. If you’ve ever found yourself dreaming that you woke up, but it was actually a part of the dream, this is a false awakening.\n\nFalse awakenings have been noted to occur alongside lucid dreams and sleep paralysis.\n\nHealing dreams\n\nWhile there’s not a lot of scientific information on healing dreams, they’ve been described as dreams that:\n\nbring you balance or harmony\n\ngive you a sense of connection, meaning, or purpose\n\nbring about reconciliation\n\nleaves you feeling joyful or at peace\n\nProphetic dreams\n\nProphetic dreams are thought to be dreams that have foretold a future event. If you dream of something happening and then it occurs later, you may feel you’ve had a prophetic dream.\n\nHistorically, dreams were considered to impart wisdom or even predict the future. In some cultures today, dreams are still considered to be a way of receiving messages from the spirit world.\n\nThere’s no real way to tell if a dream is prophetic or not — it comes down to what you believe. Some believe that a prophetic dream is just your subconscious anticipating a particular outcome and having you dream it to prepare.\n\nVivid dreams\n\nVivid dreams are almost always associated with waking up during REM sleep when your dreams are most vivid and more easily remembered.\n\nWhile we may consider any dream that we experience in REM sleep “vivid,” with vivid dreaming, it’s used to describe a particularly intense dream that felt very real. You may also remember your vivid dream a lot easier than a typical dream.\n\nAnyone can have vivid dreams, but if you’re pregnant or particularly stressed, it may contribute to having one.\n\nHave you had a dream about your teeth falling out, flying through the sky, or being chased? These are common themes that many people dream about.\n\nSome of the most common dream themes are about:\n\nfalling\n\nbeing chased\n\ndying\n\nteeth\n\nbeing naked in public\n\npregnancy\n\nflying\n\nsex or cheating\n\nDreaming about specific things like this could mean many things, or as some researchers believe, be completely nonsensical. Interpretations will vary depending on the individual and how they’re doing in their day-to-day lives.\n\nDreams about falling or being chased may indicate experiencing anxiety or conflict, or even falling in love.\n\nDreams about teeth falling out have been interpreted as everything from stress and big life changes, to indicating dental health issues.\n\nLosing teeth, being naked in public, and test taking may all fall under fear of embarrassment.\n\nJust because we don’t always remember our dreams doesn’t mean we’re not dreaming. Everyone is doing it. Even people who were born without sight dream — their dreams are reportedly just composed more of the other senses, like sound, touch, and smell.\n\nWhile we’re all dreaming while we sleep, there may be times when you’re more likely to experience certain types of dreams or remember them more often.\n\nIn childhood. While children may not necessarily dream more than adults, they’re more likely to experience certain types of dreams, like night terrors or nightmares, than adults.\n\nDuring pregnancy. Sleep and hormone changes during pregnancy may be to blame for changes in dreaming. Those who are pregnant may experience more vivid or frequent dreams and even more nightmares. You may also be able to remember dreams better.\n\nWhile grieving. Some research has found that dreams may be more vivid and feel more meaningful when you’re mourning. This can be a part of going through the grieving process.\n\nIf you’re experiencing extra stress or anxiety, have a mental health condition, or have experienced a traumatic event, you may also be more likely to have nightmares or vivid dreams.\n\nScientists don’t have all the answers on why we dream or why we have the types of dreams we have, but there are some clues.\n\nWhether you’re having vivid dreams, nightmares, or lucid dreams, if your dreaming starts to interfere with getting enough sleep, or you believe there’s an underlying cause for your dream type, speak to a healthcare professional."
