        "text": "They don’t write ’em like they used to? Well, maybe not as often as they used to — look at the top of the Billboard charts in the 20th century and chances are you won’t find nearly as high a percentage of love songs as you might have decades earlier. Where once the love song essentially marked a sort of default mode for pop music, today top 40 encompasses more subjects than ever: Identity, sexuality, personal struggles, not talking about Bruno, and countless others.\n\nStill, look at the biggest names in music of the 21st century: Drake, Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Adele, Justin Bieber, Rihanna, Ed Sheeran. They all have multiple unforgettable love songs to their credit, earning the artists some of their biggest and most-beloved hits. The form and content may have evolved since the days of The Ronettes and The Beach Boys — hell, since the days of Boyz II Men and Celine Dion — but it remains an essential and inextricable part of the pop experience, and likely will for as long as popular music exists."
