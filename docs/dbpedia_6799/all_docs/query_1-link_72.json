        "text": "We all experience bad dreams and nightmares, whether it’s being chased, losing our teeth, or finding ourselves naked in public. Like dream meanings, we often wonder about the significance of these unsettling dreams.\n\nExperts suggest that nightmares reflect patterns of human behaviour and are linked to our personal experiences. They provide insight into our minds and emotions. Although interpreting bad dreams isn’t an exact science, understanding common themes can shed light on why we experience these frightening scenarios.\n\nEach night, we typically have about five dream episodes, lasting between 15 and 40 minutes, which means we spend around two hours dreaming. With 8 billion people on Earth, that adds up to roughly 35 billion dreams each day. While many dreams are abstract or forgotten, common themes do emerge. So, what are they trying to tell us?\n\nBeing chased in a dream suggests you are running away from something, causing you fear or anxiety in waking life.\n\nIt indicates that you tend to run away or avoid a particular issue. The chaser can also represent an aspect of yourself; for example, feelings of anger, jealousy, or fear can manifest as the threatening figure.\n\nDreaming of being naked in a dream symbolises being unable to find yourself, being uncertain, or being wrongly accused. Being naked in a public setting indicates feelings of vulnerability and a fear of not fitting in with the crowd.\n\nIf you are not the naked person in your dream but see a nude person and are disturbed by it, it means you are worried about exposing that person.\n\nExam nightmares can be so real that we wake up convinced we failed an important test. They are often related to our stress during our education – even years later. They can mean you’re putting yourself under much pressure to do well or feel like you’re falling behind.\n\nWhether this is true or not, it’s a sign to implement a relaxing evening routine for better sleep.\n\nA tough time flying in your dreams suggests that someone (or something) is stopping you from moving to the next step in life.\n\nBeing afraid to fly proposes that you might be having trouble keeping up with the high goals you set for yourself. If you are alone and struggling to fly, it implies you lack confidence in yourself.\n\nDreams of cars and other modes of transport can represent a time of change in your life and reflect if you feel in control of your direction. Therefore, nightmares about out-of-control cars or car crashes usually indicate that you have anxieties about where you are heading or that someone else is making important choices for you.\n\nAnother common nightmare is dreaming you are lost or trapped somewhere, whether in a forest, a city you don’t know, an elevator, or maybe even the bad dream itself! As a common worry we have all experienced, it is no wonder that it also rears up in dreams. These nightmares may reflect feelings about your life – maybe you’re looking for guidance or want change, but it’s causing stress and anxiety.\n\nDreaming that you are late is always a stressful experience. It can mean you feel like you’re behind or time is running out—especially for significant life changes. Dreaming that you are late is also a widespread nightmare before a big event, so try to alleviate some anxiety before heading to bed. For tips on sleeping before your event, dive into how to sleep when you’re excited.\n\nNightmares don’t always indicate a mental health condition. However, research shows that 70% of individuals with conditions such as bipolar disorder, psychotic disorders, and major depressive disorder experience chronic nightmares, highlighting the strong link between mental distress and bad dreams.\n\nNumerous other factors can also contribute to nightmares. Medications, alcohol withdrawal, and even eating before bed can influence the scary episodes we have during sleep. Sometimes, it might just be that horror film you watched lingering in your memory.\n\nWhen we have a bad dream, we may think it is a warning. While we know that nightmares often reflect our unconscious thoughts and emotional state, particularly during stressful times, there isn’t much evidence to suggest that nightmares are warning signs.\n\nAlthough prophetic dreams are a common belief – for millennia, humans have believed in the future-telling abilities of dreams – there isn’t much evidence to back this up. Often, our dreams can give us deja vu or a sense that we’ve experienced something before because we use them to process our daily lives.\n\nYour unconscious mind may have figured something out before your conscious mind, or you may have had a dream about an event in anticipation of it happening and then forgotten. Either way, it will give you an eerie sensation, but it doesn’t mean you’re psychic.\n\nOne of the best ways to combat bad dreams is to go to bed feeling relaxed and ready for rest. If we tuck in for sleep while our minds are still racing, ruminating over stresses, worries, and problems, it will likely come up in our dreams.\n\nIt’s essential to establish a calming bedtime routine, for example:\n\nAvoid social media and “doom scrolling” before bed (preferably at least an hour before!)\n\nDo mindful activities such as meditation, yoga, or progressive body relaxation.\n\nComplete your wind-down routine: shut off all the lights, do your skincare, brush your teeth, take a cooling shower, and put on comfy PJs.\n\nClear your mind of unhelpful thoughts and try positive affirmations.\n\nYou can find more snooze-worthy advice with our top tips for better sleep, where you’ll learn how to drift off peacefully."
