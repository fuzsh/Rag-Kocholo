        "text": "This week I tried something different, I am not movie fan and I don't usually watch movies, I rather prefer biographies and documentaries. While scrolling through NETFLIX, this movie named \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" came across. I was intrigued by the title, so I started watching and to my surprise, I didn't fast forwarded a single time..!!!\n\nSince there is a lot to learn from this movie, I thought of sharing my thoughts and learnings with all of you!\n\nThe movie is based on the story of Chris Gardner, a man who loses everything, but eventually gets everything with his perseverance and consistent efforts. Chris is a hard-working, caring and loving father, who struggles financially to provide for his wife and son. His wife left him in the middle and he becomes homeless, and while he had to take care of his little son, he worked as a salesman. Then, he finds an unpaid 6-month-internship position at brokerage firm. Initially he struggles to get contracts for the firm, while trying to make an honest living for his son. Eventually his talents and skills, along with his charisma and personality, earned the trust of several people who signed contracts with the brokerage firm. At the end he got the one paid position and his life changed dramatically from that point.\n\n\"The Road to happiness is full of setbacks\"\n\nIn the movie it is shown that Chris went through various setbacks before he finally made it to the success. He lost his car, his wife left him, he became homeless, he was broke, his business didn't really workout, he had to look after his son himself, the setbacks were really endless. In the similar way if you are experiencing major setbacks in your life right now in your pursuit of happiness and the fulfillment of your dreams, then you are on the right path.\n\nOne of the key lessons I learnt from the movie is that “the road to happiness is full of setbacks”. In the movie we have seen that the character will smith went through various milestones before he finally made it to the success. He lost his car, his wife left him, he became homeless, he was broke, his business didn't really work out, he had to look after his son himself, I Mean the setbacks were endless. In the similar way if you are experiencing major setbacks in your life right now in your pursuit for happiness and the fulfillment of your dreams, then you are on the right path.\n\n\"it's never too late to start something new\"\n\nChris was already in his 40's when he started the internship at the brokerage firm. I am very sure that he was very conscious of the fact that the other people competing for the position were half his age, but he didn't let that stop him, he didn't allow his age to be a barrier to his goals. May be you are looking at yourself today and thinking to yourself \"I am too old to start again \"or \"I am too young to start that \"age is nothing but a number. What matters is your drive and willingness to succeed not your age.\n\n\"Believe in your dreams and have a faith in yourself''\n\nIn the movie, his wife thought the stock broker internship was a waste of time, in fact she didn't even believe he had what it took to make it as a stock broker, she use to tease him. Can you imagine how painful that must have been for him, when his own wife didn't believe in him. And maybe that's your situation, where your own friends and family don't believe in you. What matters most isn't what they believe about you but what you believe about you.\n\n\"Be positive and earnest\"\n\nChris Gardener is nothing without his optimistic outlook and his earnest pursuit of life. He lives hand to mouth from day to day, but still does not lose his cool. Half his appeal and charm lies in his being polite, friendly, bright and vibrant. His firm handshakes and a simple “Hello” and “How are you” wins over everyone at work. A calm approach to tough situations will help keep anyone’s head above water.\n\n\"The future is uncertain, so just do your bit and everything will fall into place\"\n\nNo one can predict the next moment. So we can just be on our way and hope that we reach our destination. Who knew that the six-month payless internship would work such wonder for Chris Gardener.\n\nI hope you get to see the movie. If you have already watched, do it again. It is worth it!"
