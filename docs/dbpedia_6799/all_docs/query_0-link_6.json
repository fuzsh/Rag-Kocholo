        "text": "This sounds awfully similar to\n\nThe Truman Show\n\nA guy dreaming about the one who will love her and he tries to figure out how she looks like.\n\nSylvia, the woman, had appeared in Truman's past and tried to reveal that he was actually in a TV Show. However, the production crew took her away and kicked her off the cast. This could be quite easily mistaken or misremembered as a dream, given the flashback nature of the scene.\n\nHe starts searching for different shapes of eyes, nose... etc. and starts to collect them from magazines and pictures.\n\nTruman, the protagonist creates a collage from magazine images of Sylvia. He hides the collage at his office away from his wife, buying the magazines with the women's faces \"for his wife\" when he in fact is simply making the collage\n\nTruman believes that, as Sylvia said, he is in fact in a TV show. As such he begins to orchestrate his escape. The film concludes with him escaping the giant dome, and Sylvia running to go meet him, as can be seen in the below video.\n\nPlot Summary (from Google)\n\nHe doesn't know it, but everything in Truman Burbank's life is part of a massive TV set. Executive producer Christof orchestrates \"The Truman Show,\" a live broadcast of Truman's every move captured by hidden cameras. Cristof tries to control Truman's mind, even removing his true love, Sylvia, from the show and replacing her with Meryl. As Truman gradually discovers the truth, however, he must decide whether to act on it.\n\nTrailer:\n\nYou're describing the plot of Still Breathing from 1998. From Rotten Tomatoes:\n\nThis romantic fantasy [...] stars Brendan Fraser as Fletcher McBracken, a starry-eyed San Antonio puppeteer who, like his father and grandfather before him, has a mystical vision of the woman he's fated to marry. Believing that she'll be found in \"Formosa\" (the one-time name of Taiwan), Fletcher books a flight. During a stopover in L.A., however, he learns of a trendy bar called Formosa and decides to check it out. Sure enough, Fletcher sees his dream girl, Rosalyn Willoughby (Joanna Going), a con artist on the lookout for a new mark, a millionaire from Texas.\n\nFletcher tries to recreate her face by making various collages based on his visions of her (from the eyes, noses, lips etc. of famous women that he cuts out of magazines and such). You can see him making these collages in the trailer, around 0:16. And yes, this one kinda fits into Fantasy; IIRC he sees things in his visions that he couldn't possibly have known about her. The movie is currently available on Vimeo and also on Youtube (in parts). The poster (From TV Guide):"
