        "text": "My problem with the Khelif-Carini debate is not primarily about the eligibility of the Algerian boxer, but more about whether women should compete in an aggressive full-contact sport such as boxing.\n\nBeing a feminist, I don’t like watching women boxing at the Olympics. (I’ll explain this more in a moment.\n\nHowever, I followed with interest the debate over the Italian boxer Angela Carini pulling out after just 46 seconds into her Olympic boxing match. She did so after sustaining hard blows from her Algerian opponent Imane Khelif, who apparently suffers from Differences of Sex Development (DSD or intersex), which is when there is a discrepancy between the external (outside) genitals and the internal (inside) genitals).\n\nHence, despite having been raised as a girl, Khelif appears to have blood testosterone levels in the male range, and even XY sex chromosomes.\n\nI do not believe that men and women can compete fairly in sporting contests. Nevertheless, the case of Imane Khelif seems to be unique and complicated; it cannot be compared with the case of Lia Thomas, who is simply a biological man with no congenital conditions, identifying as a woman.\n\nHowever, my problem with the Khelif-Carini debate is not primarily about the eligibility of the Algerian boxer, but more about whether women should compete in an aggressive full-contact sport such as boxing.\n\nLet’s suppose, for a moment, that Khelif had XX chromosomes. Would it have been better? Is it progress to watch two women punching each other and causing violent, traumatic brain (and other) injuries?\n\nThe so-called progressive “feminists” want to claim that there is no difference between men and women and that women can physically do everything that men do. Progressive feminists shout against the “patriarchy” but what they really want is to abandon their woman’s nature and ultimately become like men. They shout “death to the patriarchy” but, when they say it, they mean that they want to put an end to the traditional family and to motherhood.\n\nIronically, progressive “feminists” are the real promoter of “toxic masculinity”; they are ones who want to emulate only the aggressive aspects of the patriarchy. In addition, they say that they want to substitute the patriarchy with matriarchy, believing that the latter is simply a system in which women hold primary positions of “power” and “strength,” and not a means to build a community through nurture and love.\n\nWhat do I mean by all this? I certainly don’t mean that women should not compete in sports. I simply want to stress that there is a woman’s nature, and we should gladly embrace it.\n\nSports such as boxing are too physically violent and, I think, repress the nurturing nature of a woman. This does not mean that women are less able than men. On the contrary, nurture, care, and love are strengths that characterize what a woman is and why they are pillars of a community.\n\nI am happy that Italian boxer Carini pulled out after fearing permanent injuries, as she was pummeled by powerful and debilitating blows. And, because of the intersex condition, I don’t know if Algerian boxer Khelif is eligible or not to compete in women’s boxing.\n\nBut I do know that as much as men should never hit women, it is just as upsetting and distressing to me to see women punching other women, forgetting what a woman is while doing so.\n\nIf you value the news and views Catholic World Report provides, please consider donating to support our efforts.
