        "text": "The course of true love never did run smooth.\n\n(Lysander, Act 1 Scene 1)\n\nLove looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,\n\nAnd therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.\n\n(Helena, Act 1 Scene 1)\n\nI must go seek some dewdrops here,\n\nAnd hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.\n\n(Fairy, Act 2 Scene 1)\n\nIll met by moonlight, proud Titania.\n\n(Oberon, Act 2 Scene 1)\n\nI know a bank where the wild thyme blows,\n\nWhere oxlips and the nodding violet grows,\n\nQuite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,\n\nWith sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:\n\nThere sleeps Titania sometime of the night,\n\nLulled in these flowers with dances and delight.\n\n(Oberon, Act 2 Scene 1)\n\nBless thee, Bottom! Bless thee! Thou art translated.\n\n(Quince, Act 3 Scene 1)\n\nWhat angel wakes me from my flow’ry bed?\n\n(Titania, Act 3 Scene 1)\n\nTo say the truth, reason and love keep little company together nowadays.\n\n(Bottom, Act 3 Scene 1)\n\nO, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd.\n\nShe was a vixen when she went to school,\n\nAnd though she be but little, she is fierce.\n\n(Helena, Act 3 Scene 2)\n\nCupid is a knavish lad, Thus to make poor females mad.\n\n(Puck, Act 3 Scene 2)\n\nJack shall have Jill,\n\nNought shall go ill,\n\nThe man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well.\n\n(Puck, Act 3 Scene 2)\n\nMethought I was enamoured of an ass.\n\n(Titania, Act 4 Scene 1)\n\nI have had a most rare vision. I had a dream, past the wit of man to say what dream it was… The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream was.\n\n(Bottom, Act 4 Scene 1)\n\n...not a mouse\n\nShall disturb this hallowed house.\n\nI am sent with broom before,\n\nTo sweep the dust behind the door.\n\n(Puck, Act 5 Scene 1)\n\nIf we shadows have offended,\n\nThink but this, and all is mended,\n\nThat you have but slumbered here\n\nWhile these visions did appear.\n\n(Puck, Act 5 Scene 1)"
