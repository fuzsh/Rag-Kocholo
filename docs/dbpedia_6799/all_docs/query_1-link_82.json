        "text": "Close your eyes and complete this sentence: “Before I die, I want to….”\n\nThis is your first step in creating your bucket list.\n\nThe idea of the bucket list — the experiences we want to have before we \"kick the bucket\" — has captured our collective imagination for years.\n\nIt might seem a bit sad to think about, but we all dream of things we want to do before our time is up. It isn't always about \"before we die,\" but it creates a sense of urgency.\n\nCreating and updating a bucket list of ideas for what you hope to see or do keeps us in touch with what we find moving and inspiring. The list keeps us dreaming, motivated, and working hard. It helps us stay excited about life and connected with what might fulfill our sense of purpose.\n\nBucket list ideas can be as grand or as simple as you like. But they should align with who you are and what you care about. They’re rooted in your interests, purpose, and passions — the things that get you up in the morning.\n\nThe idea is simple: dream it up, write it down, and do it. In practice, though, you might find it difficult. After all, self-reflection takes time — an asset that comes at a premium these days.\n\nThankfully, we’re here to help you get started. Here are some of our best bucket list ideas to inspire you.\n\nWhat's a bucket list?\n\nA bucket list is a list of experiences someone wants to have at some point in their life. They’re a fun method of life planning that can include professional and personal goals or anything else you can imagine.\n\nYour list will undoubtedly differ from your mom’s, friend’s, or coworker’s — and that’s okay. A bucket list should reflect what you value and desire. When creating a bucket list, it can help you determine what in your life you need to start, stop, and continue to find true happiness.\n\nShould I have a bucket list?\n\nHaving a bucket list isn’t for everyone — it depends on you and how you find fulfillment. But it helps motivate you in your everyday life. It can’t hurt to dream big, so here are some things to consider if you’re going to write one.\n\nPros of having a bucket list\n\n1. It’s a measurable form of progress\n\nYour bucket list acts as a roadmap that you can follow. It’ll help you stay on track, prioritize, and budget for your dreams. Having a life plan is smart, but does your 5-year-plan only include professional milestones? You deserve to have a dream plan, too.\n\n2. It gives you things to look forward to\n\nHope is powerful, and making a bucket list gives people a reason to nurture that spark and anticipate what’s to come when the days feel long. These goals are also great extrinsic motivators — something you should include in your personal reward system.\n\n3. It makes life more meaningful\n\nBucket lists help us look past the monotonous or daily grind to bigger and better things. Life exists beyond our self-improvement books and office cubicles. A bucket list encourages you to seek out these new experiences. You have the opportunity to engage with the world, and yourself, outside of your everyday life.\n\n4. It helps you avoid languishing\n\nIf you’re feeling unmotivated, inspired, and kind of “blah” overall, you might be languishing. If you’re in this middle state, stress can affect you more, and your mental health might suffer. Having a bucket list — and something to look forward to — will keep you excited about life and ready to take on tomorrow.\n\nCons of having a bucket list\n\n1. The fulfillment is only temporary\n\nUnfortunately, most of the experiences people have on their lists are temporary. The experience might be fantastic at the moment, but the moment will pass. It quickly becomes a memory.\n\n2. It only works for those who find meaning in reaching benchmarks\n\nSpending more time with family and having a stable job is enough for many people. But many other people are daydreamers with additional goals. This kind of imagination is especially important for young adults. They have a whole life ahead of them, and setting goals will help them find their own type of fulfillment.\n\n3. You may feel like you’re failing\n\nIf you haven’t crossed off something on your list or didn’t experience something by a particular age, it might lead to self-doubt or feelings of failure. Leaving dreams unfulfilled damages our self-esteem.\n\n4. It can be superficial and performative\n\nSome people like to share and talk about their bucket lists. That can create a sense of competition and one-up-manship. It can make us focus on big Instagrammable experiences rather than deeper, quieter everyday experiences that create life satisfaction and meaning.\n\nHow to create a bucket list\n\nInclude anything you like on your bucket list. List career goals, travel destinations, health, finance, or relationship goals. It can be as long or as short as you want. Really, if you can dream it, you can do it.\n\nCreating your list can feel overwhelming. It takes Inner Work® and self-reflection to create a list that aligns with your values. There are many ways you can approach this. But, if you need a hand, BetterUp is here. Our coaches can help you figure out what matters to you and thrive.\n\nThe different kinds of bucket lists\n\nYour list might be very long if you try to put everything down at once. If you’re overwhelmed by all you want to do, try breaking it down into categories. Here are some examples of divided bucket lists:\n\nTravel destinations\n\nCareer goals\n\nFoods you want to try\n\nSkills or hobbies you’d like to learn\n\nBands you’d like to see\n\nLife goals\n\nFears to overcome\n\nEach list can contain experiences related to your interests. Think about your current career, passions, and hobbies, and turn those into cool bucket list ideas.\n\n220 ideas to put on a bucket list\n\nWe asked some of our friends and colleagues for ideas from their bucket lists.

Yours will look different, and that’s the point. The possibilities are endless.\n\nTime to bring your bucket list ideas to life\n\nReady to make your bucket list a reality? The first step is to write it down. Listing your goals in a journal can make them feel more real. There are no rules for how to journal, so you can organize your notebook however you want. But if you’re looking for a place to start, consider these journaling techniques:\n\nManifestation journal: Whether you want to hike in New Zealand or be an ocean scientist in Maine, you must open yourself up to the possibilities. Use future-minded thinking to make your bucket list a reality.\n\nGratitude journal: Keep a place to reflect on the special things you’ve done so far. This will be a great motivator to keep working on your list!\n\nIdeas journal: A dumping ground for all of your wildest dreams and ideas. Try not to filter yourself — the sky’s the limit! You can come back to them to see if they work as true bucket list items or if they were just fleeting ideas.\n\nDaily journal: Use your notebook to set daily goals, reflect on your experiences, and document your adventures. This will help you discover what activities are most meaningful to you.\n\nVision journal: Instead of writing down your bucket list, why not visualize it? Create a vision board or scrapbook of everything you want to do.\n\nIf pen-and-paper isn’t your style, you can create your list in a computer document or spreadsheet. Better yet, create a profile on bucketlist.org or bucklist.net. Signing up will grant you access to customizable lists and goal-tracking tools. Plus, you can connect with other bucket listers online and be inspired by their achievements.\n\nMoving forward with your bucket list\n\n\"One day, you will wake up and there won’t be any more time to do the things you’ve always wanted. Do it now.”\n\nBest-selling author Paulo Coelho had it right.\n\nAccording to a 2018 study, the average employee will spend 25% of their lives working. But what we do with the other 75% of our lives is up to us. It’s important to carve out time to enjoy what the world offers, make new friends, create new family traditions, and build memories.\n\nHaving and following through on your bucket list ideas is a form of self-care. Whether you want to create a travel bucket list to go to Spain or prioritize your family and career, it’s never too late to start chasing your dreams and prioritize your emotional well-being. The world can be an overwhelming, even scary place, but you’re capable of anything you set your mind to."
