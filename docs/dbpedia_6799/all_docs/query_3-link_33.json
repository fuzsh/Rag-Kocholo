We will read some of the greatest poems ever written in English, mostly by Americans, and we'll get our heads around Modern and contemporary poems. Two shorter papers and one longer paper due at the end of the semester constitute most of the work in this course (besides, of course, all the reading). No experience with poetry is required, but one must be a good reader of books to do well in this course.\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 2305.D01: Introduction to Poetry: Form, Language, and Beauty (Distance)\n\nMark Keats\n\nW 6:00-8:50 PM\n\nCRN: 33006\n\nThe poet Marianne Moore famously wrote, \"I, too, dislike it...\" with \"it\" being poetry. And though \"We dislike what we cannot understand\" is a cliché, this seems to convey the sentiment of many students engaging with poetry for the first time. But what if poetry adhered to a set of rules and wasn't so hard to pin down? What if poetry was more \"manageable\"? Robert Frost likened free verse poetry to playing tennis without the net, suggesting that there is a certain challenge (and perhaps respect) in writing within a prescribed poetic form. And yet, what poetic form does a poem like E. E. Cummings \"I(a\" adhere to? What about Carolyn Forche's \"The Colonial\"? If a poem doesn't fit within a prescribed form, does it cease to be poetry? In this class we will begin to dislike poetry less and begin to not only understand poetry, poetic forms, and poetic language but also begin to appreciate poetry for its richness and range and beauty, encompassing everything from realizing \"so much depends upon a red wheelbarro\" to imagining the hands of Eric Gardner \"put[ting] gently into the earth some plants...\" This course will focus on contemporary poems with a sprinkling of western canonical writers but is designed with the intention of exposing students to a wide range of poets across many cultural perspectives, because, as Moore's poem continues, \"Reading it, however, with a perfect contempt for it, one discovers in it after all, a place for the genuine.\"\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 2306.001 Introduction to Drama: \"Call Me Bill: Shakespeare Adaptation and Appropriation in Film and Media\"\n\nJoya Mannan\n\nMWF 12:00-12:50 PM\n\nCRN: 38500\n\nThis course explores film adaptations of William Shakespeare's plays. We will examine early and recent adaptations, ones that preserve the original early modern English language, others that challenge genre conventions, and films from other countries and cultures, too. In addition to film adaptations of Shakespeare's plays, we will be reading Shakespeare's plays as well since it is important to understand the original source material in order to adequately analyze and interpret an adaptation.\n\nThroughout the semester, we will investigate whether film adaptations of plays should be judged as plays or as films. We will learn about staging, stylistic choices, and how to analyze films. Finally, we will explore the effect of the transposition of Shakespeare's works in different forms (printed, stage performance, film adaptation, audio, digital), and we will determine the effect modern interpretations of Shakespeare's works have on society and culture today.\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 2307.010 Introduction to Fiction\n\nDr. John Samson\n\nMWF 12:00-12:50PM\n\nCRN: 11671\n\nThe purpose of this course is to provide students with an introduction to the literary interpretation and analysis of fiction: to determine what details in a text are significant, to find and develop topics from the text, and to write analytical essays. We will read and discuss three books of short stories and two novels, all of which will focus on the diversity of American cultures, including issues relating to gender roles and relations, ethnicities, and social classes. The texts will be: Jhumpa Lahiri, Interpreter of Maladies; Sandra Cisneros, Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories; Paul Laurence Dunbar, The Heart of Happy Hollow; Sherman Alexie, Reservation Blues; and W. Somerset Maugham, The Razor's Edge.\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 2307.D01: Introduction to Fiction: The Strange and Magical Worlds of Haruki Murakami (Distance)\n\nMark Keats\n\nM 6:00-8:50 PM\n\nCRN: 11592\n\nThough Japanese, Haruki Murakami has become a household name for readers of fiction around the world. His works has often been described as magical, strange, and surreal and seeming blends Japanese and western culture through music, food, geography, etc. This course will offer to the students a large (thought not exhaustive) sampling of stories, essays, interviews, and novels that reveals Murakami's growth as a writer, novelist, and critical literary figure in world literature as well as investigating the elements of fiction and modes of narration (realism versus magical realism). Since we will read all of Murakami's work in translation and by three different translators, each known for his own way and philosophy of translating Murakami, another component of this course is focused on translation studies and considering larger questions such as what is lost and/or gained during translation?\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 2307.H02: Introduction to Fiction: Hard-Boiled Fiction (Honors)\n\nDr. Mike Borshuk\n\nTR 11:00-12:20PM\n\nCRN: 28863\n\nThis section of 2307 will introduce students to fiction's generic conventions, and to strategies for critical interpretation, by exploring one of the most distinctly American literary genres: hard-boiled crime fiction. Beginning with the foundational Black Mask school of crime writers, we will cover a wide historical range of hard-boiled writers, with attention to their influences, their artistic innovations, and their stylistic departures from the mystery and crime writers who preceded them. As we move forward chronologically, we will also pay attention to significant revisions to hard-boiled crime's signature characteristics by more contemporary American practitioners of the form. Students will leave the course with an understanding of fiction's key characteristics (including for instance, plot, narrative voice, setting, and dialogue) and will develop this understanding through extensive critical writing, including three formal papers.\n\nTentative reading list:\n\nDashiell Hammett, The Maltese Falcon (1930)\n\nJames M. Cain, The Postman Always Rings Twice (1934)\n\nRaymond Chandler, Farewell, My Lovely (1940)\n\nPatricia Highsmith, Strangers on a Train (1950)\n\nJim Thompson, The Killer Inside Me (1952)\n\nDorothy Hughes, The Expendable Man (1963)\n\nJames Ellroy, The Black Dahlia (1987)\n\nWalter Mosley, Devil in a Blue Dress (1990)\n\nChrista Faust, Money Shot (2008)\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 2308.005: Introduction to Non-Fiction: Food Writing\n\nMike Lemon\n\nTR 11:00-12:20 PM\n\nCRN: 11982\n\nThe purpose of this course is to provide students with an introduction to the literary interpretations and analysis of non-fiction: to determine what details in a text are significant, to find and develop topics from the text, and to write analytical essays.\n\nFor this section of Introduction to Non-Fiction, students will investigate food writing in its various modes. Food holds strong symbolic, cultural, and personal connections to people that move the act of eating beyond its physiological import. Through our readings, students and I will explore food's importance through different non-fiction genres. In the end, we will investigate food's place in multiple sub/cultures.\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 2308.006: Introduction to Non-Fiction: \"Good Trouble\": Voices of Color in American Nonfiction\n\nKenna Neitch\n\nTR 12:30-1:50 PM\n\nCRN: 11986\n\nWhat and who have the authority to constitute “the truth” are contentious topics of debate in contemporary political, social, and literary domains. This course is intended to engage and expand on your encounters with the genre of nonfiction, focusing on American creative nonfiction with an emphasis on gender, intersectionality, and political resistance.\n\nWe will take on questions of perspective and expectations of truth in nonfiction that cross boundaries of time – across 20th century and into our current historical moment – and medium, from the page to the stage to the screen. Our work with this genre will be informed especially by the creative nonfiction of women of color whose voices have historically been at the periphery of literary and political conversations.\n\nThe course will involve weekly onsite and online discussion, one personal response essay, one longer critical paper, and a presentation.\n\nTexts for the course may include:\n\nBorderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza, Gloria Anzaldúa\n\nSister Outsider, Audre Lorde\n\nThis Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color, Cherríe Moraga and Gloria Anzaldúa\n\nWe Should All Be Feminists, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 2311: Introduction to Technical Writing\n\nMultiple Sections with various instructors\n\nPrerequisite: ENGL 1301 and 1302.

It is likely that many of you are not architects (yet), even that many of you may have never thought about the constructions you encounter and inhabit, let alone how they are designed and built. A knowledge of building and design are not compulsory for success in this class; however, movement—imaginative, logical and physical—through and around dwellings and constructions, as well as curiosity about how construction functions are required; an earnest and soundly demonstrated effort and great attention to how you write and read is also necessary.\n\nIn this class, you will write both poetry and essays (creative non-fiction). Your final goal for the class is a portfolio of work consisting of at least six poems and one essay, revised and “finished” to the best of your ability. In order to achieve this goal, we will take a three-step approach. We will read and discuss works of published poetry and non-fiction, often in the shape of texts on or about architecture (for example, Peter Zumthor's Architectural Environments, Surrounding Objects), while analyzing various techniques discussed in Janet Burroway's text, Imaginative Writing. You will also write short exercises aimed at developing the techniques of literary non-fiction and poetry, which we will discuss in class. In early October, you will turn in the first draft of your essay, and in early November, you will hand in the first drafts of your six poems. Your peers will critique your work in a workshop setting and you will be given a written assessment of the portfolio, and meet with your professor individually to talk about the portfolio and your writing.\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 2371.001: Language in a Multicultural America\n\nDr. Aaron Braver\n\nTR 11:00-12:20 PM\n\nCRN: 13140\n\nHow does our culture influence our language? How does our language influence our culture? In this course, we will examine the role of language in the melting pot of America. We'll look at language as influenced by race, gender, sexual and gender identity, and power structures in order to see how social dynamics affect the way people speak—and the way people interpret what they hear. We'll learn about the methods involved in gathering sociolinguistic data, and even engage in some hands-on research ourselves.

Although the course is designed to carefully explore the formal components of filmmaking, most of which students intuitively understand, the ultimate purpose of the class is to inquire into the effects that these formal components produce. Why would a given director use a wide-angle lens in a particular scene, and what does such a lens, or a long-take, or an abrupt cut accomplish? These and other similar questions determine the first half of the course, whereas the second half of the class will move into considerations of the significance and specificity of different modes of cinema-narrative, documentary, and avant-garde. What distinguishes the cinema, apart from all other arts, and what makes this \"Seventh Art\" at once so conceptually rich and so potentially deceptive?\n\nSelected films for outside viewing may include the following (many of which are available for free online):\n\nA Trip to the Moon (Méliès, 1902)\n\nEntr'acte (Clair, 1294)\n\nThe General (Keaton, 1926)\n\nUn Chien Andalou (Buñel and Dali, 1929)\n\nStella Dallas (Vidor, 1934)\n\nMeshes of the Afternoon (Deren and Hammid, 1943)\n\nSingin' in the Rain (Kelly and Donen, 1952)\n\nNight and Fog (Resnais, 1956)\n\nCléo from 5 to 7 (Varda, 1962)\n\n(nostalgia) (Frampton, 1971)\n\nDo the Right Thing (Lee, 1989)\n\nJerry Maguire (Crowe, 1996)\n\nStories We Tell (Polley, 2012)\n\nWhiplash (Chazelle, 2014)\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 2388.002: Introduction to Film Studies\n\nDr. Ben Rogerson\n\nMWF 10:00-10:50 PM\n\nCRN: 13206\n\nThis course is intended to introduce students to the techniques, the vocabulary, and ultimately the \"rhetoric\" of cinema.

What does it mean when the villain, who should repel us, instead becomes an object of our fascination? What does it mean when that fascination is so powerful that it provokes our identification with characters whom morality cautions us against? What is it that distinguishes a villain from other literary characters—and what is it that makes a villain loveable in the first place? This course will provide students with an introduction to literary analysis by attempting to answer these questions. Poems, plays, novels, films, and even television shows will provide the material through which we think critically both about literature—how it is made and how it makes meaning—and about the nature of villainy in all of its ethical, artistic, and social dimensions.\n\nAssignments will include three papers of 4-45 pages, presentations, a mid-term, and a final exam. Possible readings will include the following texts:\n\nWilliam Shakespeare, Macbeth\n\nJohn Milton, Paradise Lost\n\nEmily Bronte, Wurthering Heights\n\nMuriel Spark, The Prime of Ms. Jean Brodie\n\nPatricia Highsmith, The Talented Mr. Ripley\n\nThe Norton Anthology of Poetry, 5th Edition, ed.

We will develop the skills for close reading and interpretation, for sustained academic arguments about literature, and for obtaining a familiarity with different literary approaches and critical vocabularies. To develop such skills, we will consider a variety of texts in different genres-prose, poetry, and drama-and spend considerable time discussing and, furthermore, writing about texts.\n\nIn order to focus our investigations into literary studies, this course will concentrate on the idea of maturation and adulthood. In turn, our assigned texts will depict the historical development and mutability of ideas about adulthood in the United States as the nation undergoes political, cultural, social, and technological upheavals.\n\nSelected texts may include the following:\n\nHarriet Jacobs, selections from Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl (1861)\n\nHenry James, The Turn of the Screw (1898)\n\nWilliam Faulkner, The Sound and the Fury (1929)\n\nFlannery O'Connor, \"A Good Man is Hard to Find\" (1953)\n\nJames Baldwin, \"Sonny's Blues\" (1957)\n\nJohn Berryman, selections from 77 Dream Songs (1964)\n\nSylvia Plath, selections from Ariel (1965)\n\nAugust Wilson, Fences (1983)\n\nSandra Cisneros, The House on Mango Street (1984)\n\nJhumpa Lahiri, selections from Interpreter of Maladies (1999)\n\nJennifer Egan, selections from A Visit from the Goon Squad (2010)\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 2391.007: Introduction to Literary Studies\n\nDr. Daniel Hutchins\n\nTR 12:30-1:50 PM\n\nCRN: 35479\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 2391.008: Introduction to Literary Studies\n\nDr. Daniel Hutchins\n\nTR 2:00-3:20 PM\n\nCRN: 38200\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 2391.H01: Introduction to Literary Studies: Honors First Year Experience (Honors)\n\nDr. Kurt Caswell\n\nTR 2:00-3:20 PM\n\nCRN: 24990\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 3302.001: Old and Middle English Literature: Monsters, Vikings, and Monks: Anglo-Saxon Literature\n\nDr. Brian McFadden\n\nTR 9:30-10:50 AM\n\nThis course will emphasize Old English and Anglo-Latin literature (c. 730-1066) in the context of the major events of the period, the Viking invasions and the Benedictine Reform, which began to establish the idea of England as a nation and to define it as a “self” against foreign “others.” Genres will be Anglo-Saxon history (Bede's Ecclesiastical History, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle); saints' lives (Ælfric's Lives of Saints, the Life of St. Margaret); homilies and sermons (Ælfric, Wulfstan); allegory (Panther, Phoenix, Whale); riddles; heroic poetry (Beowulf, Judith, The Battle of Maldon, Dream of the Rood); elegies (The Wanderer, The Seafarer, The Husband's Message, The Wife's Lament, Wulf and Eadwacer); and monster texts (The Letter of Alexander to Aristotle; Wonders of the East; Liber Monstrorum). We will also examine several Anglo-Norman and Middle English texts (Hali Meiðhad, Equitan, Lanval, the Bayeux Tapestry, and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight) to examine how the genres changed in England after the Norman Conquest. Course requirements: frequent participation, occasional quizzes, two short essays, annotated bibliography, midterm exam, and final exam.\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 3302.001: Old and Middle English Literature: Monsters, Vikings, and Monks: Anglo-Saxon Literature\n\nDr. Brian McFadden\n\nTR 11:00-12:20 PM\n\nThis course will emphasize Old English and Anglo-Latin literature (c. 730-1066) in the context of the major events of the period, the Viking invasions and the Benedictine Reform, which began to establish the idea of England as a nation and to define it as a “self” against foreign “others.” Genres will be Anglo-Saxon history (Bede's Ecclesiastical History, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle); saints' lives (Ælfric's Lives of Saints, the Life of St. Margaret); homilies and sermons (Ælfric, Wulfstan); allegory (Panther, Phoenix, Whale); riddles; heroic poetry (Beowulf, Judith, The Battle of Maldon, Dream of the Rood); elegies (The Wanderer, The Seafarer, The Husband's Message, The Wife's Lament, Wulf and Eadwacer); and monster texts (The Letter of Alexander to Aristotle; Wonders of the East; Liber Monstrorum).

This course will approach Restoration and eighteenth-century literature by exploring these new ideas and their expression in literature. We'll read a wide range of literary texts from the period that illustrate new ideas about what literature ought to be, new ideas about how printing should relate to literature, new ideas about who could write literature, new ideas about humans' place in the universe, and new ideas about how people ought to feel and act (just to name a few). As we study these texts, issues, and ideas, you will develop an understanding of major British literary works of the long eighteenth century and the historical and cultural contexts and influences that informed them; the ability to write with clarity, precision, and accuracy and to analyze and interpret literature; and the ability to conduct research carefully and systematically and to incorporate that research into your own interpretations of literature. Assignments will include exams, a short paper, and a longer researched paper. Absences will accrue from the first day of classes regardless of registration status\n\nReturn to top.\n\nENGL 3308:D01: 19th Century British Literature: Victorian Literature and Society (Distance)\n\nDr. Alison Rukavina\n\nR 6:00-8:50 PM\n\nCRN: 35481\n\n“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness.” While Charles Dickens wrote the opening lines of his novel Tale of Two Cities about the French Revolution, these lines also described the Victorian era (1830-1901) with its profound social, political, and cultural upheaval that transformed British society. The Industrial Revolution led to rapid economic and social changes, including demands for labor reform, Darwin's theory of evolution challenged religious faith, and developments in medicine and psychology introduced new ways of understanding mental illness. Developments in social and political thought led to debates about a woman's place in society, and the rapid growth of the British Empire spread Victorian values globally and introduced foreign cultures and concepts at home. Students in this distance course will read Victorian literary works, including novels, short stories, and poetry, by Alfred Lord Tennyson, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Charlotte Brontë, Robert Louis Stevenson, Joseph Conrad and others that engaged with these transformations.\n\nAssignments will include two essays, presentation, and other work.\n\nTexts:\n\nMary Elizabeth Braddon's Lady Audley's Secret\n\nCharlotte Bronte's Jane Erye\n\nJoseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson's Jekyll and Hyde\n\nElzabeth Barrett Browning's \"Cry of the Children,\" Alfred Lord Tennyson's \"Lady of Shallot\" as well as other poems and readings\n\nAssignments: weekly participation and discussion; 3 short reading responses; research essay (including proposal & draft); presentation\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 3309.001: Modern and Contemporary British Literature\n\nDr. Jen Shelton\n\nTR 12:30-1:50 PM\n\nCRN: 33008\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 3324.001: Nineteenth-Century American Literature\n\nDr. John Samson\n\nMWF 10:00-10:50 AM\n\nCRN: 13533\n\nThis course will focus on the variety of prose writings during the American Renaissance (1830-1860). We will read and discuss autobiographies, short stories, and novels that reflect the aesthetic achievements and cultural diversity of six major authors of this great period in American Literature. Texts: short stories by Edgar Allan Poe and Herman Melville; the autobiographical writings Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave by Frederick Douglass and Walden by Henry David Thoreau; and the novels The Blythedale Romance by Nathaniel Hawthorne and Ruth Hall by Fanny Fern.

Among the topics to which we will be attentive are frustration over traditional modes of representation and radical experimentation in literary style; assertive reconceptualizations of racial, gender, and sexual identity during the period; the influence of technology, urban space, and mass culture on artistic expression; and an ongoing aggressive attempt at American cultural self-definition in relation to the world at large.\n\nTexts:\n\nPaul Lauter, ed., The Heath Anthology of American Literature, Volume D: 1910-1945\n\nGertrude Stein, Tender Buttons (1914)\n\nF.

That means we'll take up questions such as these: How have American writers presented or created fictional American characters through their language? What American sensibilities emerge through linguistic choices in fiction, non-fiction, and poetry? How does language shape the twentieth century American experience in literature and in life? What makes twentieth century American literature distinctive? What does it mean to be an American?\n\nOver the semester we'll read, think, discuss, listen, and write our way through these and other key questions about twentieth century literature. Although students will select some texts for their independent work, we are likely to read together classics by writers such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, or William Faulkner as well as more recent work by writers such as Chang-Rae Lee, Alice Walker, Rudolfo Anaya, or Louise Erdrich.\n\nInterested students from all programs within the English Department – and interested students from all other departments – are welcome in this course. Students in English 3325 will be expected to:\n\ncomplete listening, reading, and writing assignments each week (NOTE: this is an official Writing Intensive class and counts as such for graduation requirements);\n\napply course concepts in longer papers as well as in weekly writing assignments;\n\naccess materials online through the library and through Blackboard; and\n\nparticipate in interactive discussions and presentations.\n\nBecause this is an online class, students will need reliable Internet access, and students' computers must be configured to use the university's official online learning platform, Blackboard. (Guides can be found at www.Blackboard.ttu.edu, and individualized, personal assistance is also available through IT Help Central.)\n\nQuestions about the course should be directed to the professor, Dr. Mary Jane Hurst, who can be reached by e-mail at maryjane.hurst@ttu.edu.\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 3338.001: Global South Literatures: Can We Live Together in Harmony? The Possibility of a Cosmopolitan Culture\n\nDr. Roger McNamara\n\nTR 11:00-12:20 PM\n\nCRN: 35483\n\nThe 21st century is an exciting period. Never before in our history have people from different countries, regions, and continents been interacting with each other with such frequency. This advanced stage of globalization is largely because of the internet's reach across the globe, cheaper and quicker ways to travel, and less restrictions on trade and commerce. However, even while globalization has created more opportunities and introduced new ideas, it has come with a price tag: as people from different cultures co-mingle with each other, they struggle to reconcile their competing worldviews. They have different ideas about religion, the rights of individuals versus those of communities, the roles of men and women, just to name a few. Thus, is it possible for people to reconcile or at least tolerate each other or is conflict inevitable? In grappling with this problem, some intellectuals have turned to “cosmopolitanism” —an idea originating with the ancient Greeks—where individuals believed that they were citizens, not of the individual city-states but of the world. Contemporary critics have further developed this idea by asserting the need to embrace differences, as long there is a consensus on certain basic rights.\n\nThis course explores whether cosmopolitanism is possible to achieve or whether we will be unable to reconcile our differences. We will examine the work of cosmopolitanism's advocates in conjunction with literary texts that explore diversity. These texts will be from across the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, South Africa, and India, etc., and wil be written in different genres—realism, magic realism, and science fiction/fantasy.\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 3338.D01: Global South Literatures: Can We Live Together in Harmony?

Situated somewhere between prose poem and micro-narrative, flash essays provide us the path to lyrically explore a topic whil taking both narration and syntactical leaps. Or, as Bernard Cooper says, the flash essay teaches us \"an alertness to detail, a quickening of the senses, and a focusing of the literary lens until one has magnified some small aspect of what it means to be human.\" During the course of the semester, we will approach our classworm like a writing lab, conducting in-class writing experiments and workshops of each other's works. We will write five flash essays - 750 words or less - to be revised in a final portfolio.\n\nBluets by Maggie Nelson\n\nBrief Encounters: A Collection of Contemporary Nonfiction edited by Judith Kitchen and Dinah Lenney\n\nPDFs as assigned\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 3351.006: Creative Writing: Fiction\n\nDr. Katie Cortese\n\nTR 11:00-12:20 PM\n\nCRN: 13642\n\nReading and writing literature is one of the best ways to learn about and develop empathy for cultures and peoples outside of an individual's direct experience, and thus become more sensitive to and aware of diversity within the human condition. In this course, students will write and critique short stories, as well as analyze canonical and contemporary examples of the form. Students will write several short exercises and a longer story to be critiqued in a large-group format. Class discussions will focus on the craft of writing stories as seen in published examples and highlighted in assigned craft essays. Elements discussed will include but not be limited to aspects of character, plot, dialogue, style, time, setting, inventory, epiphanies, and other topics as they arise. As students learn to read, write, and critique short stories, they will also broaden their experience of what it means to be human.\n\nAssignments will include writing, critiquing, and revising up to five short exercises and one short story, as well as reviewing a work of flash fiction, and giving a presentation on a story or article. Students will also attend and respond to one live reading and assemble a final creative portfolio.\n\nTentative Reading List:\n\nBird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life, Anne Lamott\n\nFlash Fiction Forward, James Thomas & Robert Shapard\n\nPDFs as assigned\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 3351.007: Creative Writing: Fiction\n\nDr. Kolosov\n\nTR 12:30-1:50 PM\n\nCRN: 33009\n\nIn this reading and writing intensive workshop, we will read and write a range of fiction, from very brief flash fiction pieces of 250 to 500 words to longer, traditional length stories of 3500-7000 words. In addition, we will experiment with fiction that steals from and/or integrates techniques from other genres. Examples include use of graphics and the stage directions and other cues associated with drama and film. Writers will hone fundamentals of craft, in particular plot, character development including dialogue and gesture, and world building. Readings will be eclectic and diverse, from mystery and ghost stories to domestic realism and more fabulist writings. Some of the writers we'll read are Alix Ohlin, Peter Orner, Sara Majka, Ahdaf Soueif (Egypt), Etgar Keret (Israel), Sherman Alexie, Andre Dubus III, Percival Everett, Paul Yoon, Gish Jen & Jamaica Kincaid.

From reading the morning paper to decrypting secret codes, the subconscious knowledge of language is uniquely human. In this course we'll ask what it means to have a command of language—do animals have it? Infants? By examining the structures of the world's languages, we will discover why linguists believe in a “universal grammar” in spite of the world's rich linguistic diversity. We'll also learn how to make the sounds of the world's languages—from French nasal vowels to the clicks of Africa's Bantu languages. This course is suited to anyone interested in language, how the mind works, or the characteristics that make us uniquely human.\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 3372.001: History of the English Language\n\nDr. Brian McFadden\n\nTR 2:00-3:20 PM\n\nCRN: 13870\n\nThis course will examine the development of the English language from its origins in Anglo-Saxon England through changes in the later medieval and Early Modern periods to the attempts to codify the language in the eighteenth century and the development of modern language study in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We will examine both the internal history (the linguistic changes that occur within the language over time) and the external history (the effects of social and political events on the language) of English in order to answer such questions as: Why do English words often resemble words from other languages? Why are there so many “irregular” verbs in English? Why don't we spell words as they sound? Why don't we split infinitives or put a preposition at the end of a sentence when other Germanic languages do? We will also examine contemporary issues in English to see how the language has implications for our political and social lives. We will also learn to use online tools such as the Oxford English Dictionary and the Dictionary of Old English Corpus to assist in linguistic and literary research. Texts will include Gramley, The History of English: An Introduction; Gilliver, Marshall, and Weiner, Tolkien and the Ring of Words; McCrum, Globish; Wilton, Word Myths; and various PDF documents to be delivered online.\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 3373.001: Modern English Syntax\n\nDr. Min-Joo Kim\n\nTR 9:30-10:50 AM\n\nCRN: 33095\n\nThis course offers an overview of the grammar of present-day English but it doesn't just teach you about which grammatical rules to follow; rather, it teaches you why English grammar works the way it does. Furthermore, in this course, students will uncover how Syntax works together with Morphology and Semantics in generating well-formed sentences, and how languages change over time, and what that tells about the underlying principles of human language in general. This course also gives an introduction to dialectal variation within English, how English differs from other languages, and what kinds of grammatical errors non-native speakers tend to make and why.\n\nTherefore, it will be suitable for anyone planning to become an English/ESL teacher and/or interested in linguistics/language studies in general. Finally, taking this course will help enhance one's critical thinking, logical reasoning, and data-driven analytical skills as well.\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 3385.001: Selected Plays of Shakespeare: What's Wrong With Revenge?\n\nDr. Matthew Hunter\n\nMWF 9:00-9:50 AM\n\nCRN: 13925\n\nThis course will introduce students to Shakespeare's plays, his dramatic art, and his vibrant historical moment. From his tragedies and comedies, to his innovative depictions of English history, to his forays into tragicomedy, this course will chart Shakespeare's remarkable development as a dramatist. Over the course of our readings and in-class discussions, we will investigate a range of themes that are central both to Shakespeare's plays and to the culture for which he wrote: the construction of the individual, the folly of love, the sovereignty of the crown, the value of history, and the power of performance to encroach upon all aspects of our lives. As we cover these themes, we will also find ourselves returning to a subject that troubles Shakespeare's writing from his earliest plays to his last ones: the nature of revenge. In an ethical society, can revenge be justified—or is it always doomed to corrupt the avenger? Is revenge the fault of the individual or of the state? And when should revenge give way to its opposite—to mercy?\n\nAssignments will include two papers of 6 pages, presentations, and a final exam. Readings will be from The Norton Shakespeare (3rdEdition) and will include the following plays:\n\nTitus Andronicus\n\nThe Taming of the Shrew\n\nRichard II\n\n1 Henry IV\n\nThe Merchant of Venice\n\nHamlet\n\nOthello\n\nThe Tempest\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 3388.001: Film Genres\n\nDr. Wyatt Phillips\n\nMWF 11:00-11:50 AM\n\nCRN: 14001\n\nThis course will study the horror film, the musical, and the western in order to better understand how film genres form, mature, transform, and travel.\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 3388.002: Film Genres: Horror and the Fantastic\n\nDr. Allison Whitney\n\nTR 12:30-1:50 PM\n\nCRN: 13998\n\nThis course will approach cinemas of horror and the fantastic from multiple perspectives, including audience studies, feminist criticism, psychoanalytic theory, cognitive psychology, studies of film sound, the history of censorship, and the relationship between genre development and both social and technological change. Students will develop skills of formal analysis specific to film studies, explore a variety of theoretical approaches to cinema, and become familiar with multiple modes of filmmaking, including fiction, nonfiction, and experimental film.\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 3390.D01: Literatures of the Southwest (Distance)\n\nDr. Cordelia Barrera\n\nT 6:00-8:50 PM\n\nCRN: 38641\n\nThe Southwest is a border territory where cultures meet and mix. The region brings to mind cowboy virtues, vast open spaces, and American exceptionalism. SW texts make varying claims about the region as real, unreal, surreal, and magically real, and its desert mirages and indigenous cultures evoke exotic, nightmarish landscapes and visions. We will explore these literary portrayals of the Southwest by focusing on desert spaces as we consider the Anglo, Chicano, and American Indian cultures of the region. In our efforts to capture the essence of landscape, region, and place we'll discuss novels, essays and short stories by Ray Bradbury, Larry McMurtry, Luis Alberto Urrea, Cormac McCarthy, Leslie Marmon Silko, Dorothy Scarborough and Mary Austin.\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 3392.001: African American Literature\n\nDr. Michael Borshuk\n\nTR 2:00-3:20 PM\n\nCRN: 35486\n\nThis course will examine the development of African American literature from the slave narratives of the nineteenth century to postmodern fiction at the turn of the twenty-first. We will begin with a discussion of critical approaches to African American literature, and then proceed chronologically through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Among our topics for interrogation and discussion will be: the influence of oral and musical traditions on the development of African American writing; the intervention(s) into traditional constructions of the American canon that black literature inaugurates; the ways that African American writers redress stereotypes and problematic representations of black Americans; and the “alternative” histories that African American literature proposes alongside America's dominant historical records.\n\nTentative Reading List:\n\nHenry Louis Gates, Jr. and Valerie A.

Both men were infamous political rebels and religious free-thinkers who transformed their world. Hobbes's Leviathan (1651) and Milton's Paradise Lost (1667), in particular, left a lasting mark on English thought and culture, and this course will discuss their innovations in everything from Orwellian government, to proto-feministic views of women and gender, to materialism and the denial of a spiritual world.\n\nClass discussions will alternate between three focal areas: 1) questions of aesthetics, literary genres and form, with special focus on epic, lyric, diary, and political treatise; 2) consideration of cultural contexts, especially gender and women's roles, science, Christianity, and monarchy vs. democracy; and 3) current scholarly conversations on Milton, Hobbes, and other authors of the Revolution and Restoration. Assignments include a 10-source annotated bibliography and a 12-page final research paper.\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 4311.001: Studies in Poetry: Modern British Poetry\n\nDr. William Wenthe\n\nMWF 2:00-2:50 PM\n\nCRN: 14724\n\nThis course will explore the major movements and figures in British Poetry for much of the twentieth century. The majority of our readings will cover the rapid changes in English poetry from about 1910 to World War II, when poets were working to revise the English poetic tradition into deliberately \"modern\" forms. Among the poems we read are some of the most engaging and important poems in the language. This course is geared for those pursuing an English Major or Minor; however, I do not intend to discourage any other interested undergraduate from exploring some of the richest, most exciting, and controversial writings in our language. I do require that all students be committed to the readings in this course. The readings are by no means great in quantity, but they will demand to be read differently than one would read prose. Thus we will be examining poems not only for what they say, but for what they do—that is, what effects, what possible meanings, are created by the formal qualities of the poem.\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 4313.001: Studies in Fiction: West of Everyting\n\nDr. Sara Spurgeon\n\nMWF 11:00-11:50 AM\n\nCRN: 33097\n\nWe will examine works of fiction, poetry, and film by Native American, Chicano, Anglo American, Asian American, and African American writers and directors. Some will be classics (both literary and filmic) of the genre known as the Western, and some will undermine, subvert, or expand it. We will explore these texts from a number of different angles: What did the myth of the frontier look like in the past and what shape is it assuming in literature and film today? How has it been used to justify or deconstruct American ideas about conquest, colonization, and empire? How might it work to define our modern ideas about gender, race, class, sexuality, national identity, borders, etc.? How has it formed the genre we know today as the “Western”? How does the film and fiction of non-Anglo Westerners writing from \"the other side\" of the frontier reinterpret that myth?

Authors in books like Jekyll and Hyde and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea wrote about how science and technology were both potentially marvelous and dangerous. Authors like Robert Louis Stevenson and Jules Verne touched on the reason why so many individuals in the nineteenth century were anxious about, if not completely frightened by, the fast-paced changes brought about by inventions like the combustion engine and the development of modern scientific study—the unknown consequences of marvels like steam-powered robots and medicines that promised to cure disease. In the course, students will read late-nineteenth-century science fiction and discuss how works like The Island of Dr. Moreau engaged with the fear of progress without limits and Darwin's theory of evolution. Students will also consider how the fear of “other” manifests in works like The War of the Worlds and Dracula, as well as how Stoker's novel engages with Victorian developments surrounding gender and sexuality. Science fiction was a site of inquiry as authors questioned what was the truth regarding whether scientific and technical progress was a boon or a bane for society at the end of the nineteenth century.\n\nTexts:\n\nEdward Ellis' The Steam Man of the Prairies\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson's Jekyll and Hyde\n\nBram Stoker's Dracula\n\nH.G.

This course has a dual focus of reading published stories (many of which will break convention), and writing polished, potentially-publishable short stories. Discussions will complicate and deepen students' knowledge of storytelling elements, including aspects of character, plot, structure, dialogue, style, time, setting, beginnings/middles/endings, epiphanies, and more. In addition to honing students' literary analysis skills, this course has the objectives of preparing students to (1) identify and contextualize variations on conventional storytelling techniques in published works, (2) develop editing/critiquing skills for in-progress drafts, and (3) create original fiction.\n\nAssignments will include writing, critiquing, and revising two short stories and 3-5 short exercises, delivering a presentation on a short story, analyzing and reviewing a recent issue of a literary magazine, responding to a live reading, and assembling a final creative portfolio.\n\nTentative Reading List:\n\nSteering the Craft: A 21st-Century Guide to Sailing the Sea of Story, Ursula K.

This course also introduces students to Middle English manuscript studies. The term Middle English encompasses an array of regional dialects that coexisted in England roughly between the Norman Conquest in 1066 and the standardization of English in 1430. Class time will be spent translating and pronouncing Middle English, transcribing from manuscript facsimiles, and discussing related issues in translation, manuscript context, and literary interpretation. By the end of the course, students will be able to comprehend and read aloud Middle English poetry that ranges widely in dialect, form, and genre. This course will be of interest to literature students as well as to linguistics and creative writing students interested in form, prosody, book history, and the theory and praxis of translation.\n\nRequirements fulfilled:\n\nBritish Literature, Poetry genre, high proficiency language requirement, Medieval & Renaissance Studies (MSRC) graduate certificate\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 5306: Milton: Live Free or Die: Milton, Hobbes, and the Foundations of Modern Liberty\n\nDr. Ryan Hackenbracht\n\nR 9:30AM-12:20PM\n\nCRN: 35489\n\nFrom President Trump's Muslim ban to censorship of the press, controversies over American civil liberties fill our daily headlines. Recent though they may seem, these are in fact old issues, and the language and logic we use today to analyze liberty have their origins in seventeenth-century England. During the English Revolution, the overthrow of government and the execution of the king (unprecedented events that shocked Europe) sparked new ways of imagining citizens' rights, the authority of the state, and the obligations of sovereigns to their subjects. The conflict between Thomas Hobbes and John Milton, in particular, generated important inquiries into the nature of liberty, including, what is the basis for liberty, and can it be stripped away from a person? how much freedom is too much? are citizens justified in opposing an unjust state? The Hobbes-Milton debate had a long afterlife, and the last third of this course charts its influence on the American Founding Fathers, including Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Ben Franklin.\n\nIn the age of Milton and Hobbes, theorizing about liberty was not just a political affair—it was also a literary one. To connect with their reading public, who were steeped in knowledge of the Bible and the classics, Hobbes and Milton recycled and reinvented narratives from the Old and New Testaments, ancient Greek poetry, and Roman orations. This course, then, explores the literariness of liberty—that is, how Milton and Hobbes used narrative, genre, form, and mode to convey their thoughts on the freedom of the individual. Assignments will include an annotated bibliography, a presentation to the seminar, and a research paper of 20 pages.\n\nRequirements fulfilled:\n\nBritish Literature, Poetry genre, Medieval & Renaissance Studies (MSRC) graduate certificate\n\nTexts:\n\nThomas Hobbes, Leviathan, ed. by Edwin Curley (Hackett, 1994)\n\nJohn Milton, Complete Poems and Major Prose, ed. by Merritt Hughes (Hackett, 2003)\n\nJohn Adams, Thomas Jefferson, et al., Something that Will Surprise the World: The Essential Writings of the Founding Fathers, ed. by Susan Dunn (Basic, 2006)\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 5309: Studies in Nineteenth Century British Literature: Victorian Science Fiction & Fantasy: Steampunk Past and Present\n\nDr. Alison Rukavina\n\nM 2:00-4:50PM\n\nCRN: 38597\n\nThe course examines Victorian science fiction and fantasy in relation to the contemporary steampunk genre, which combines Victoriana, science fiction & fantasy, and technology, as well as a punk aesthetic. Steampunk is not an entirely “new” genre in that it was inspired by the works of Mary Shelley, Jules Verne, and H.G. Wells. Students in the course will consider whether nineteenth-century works like Frankenstein, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, and Time Machine are steampunk and what defines the genre, as well as what historical and contemporary issues are at the heart of novels by William Gibson, Neil Gaiman, and K.W. Jeter. While technology—whether steam, nuclear, or other—and the host of issues it engenders is often at the heart of steampunk, books within the genre also wrestle with a diverse list of issues including those pertaining to gender and race. Students in the class will read historical and contemporary steampunk, considering how the authors engage with their audience and culture. As part of the class, students will also look at steampunk in other genres including nineteenth-century dime novels and twentieth-century graphic novels.\n\nReadings will include Robert Louis Stevenson's Jekyll and Hyde, Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Bram Stoker's Dracula, H.G. Wells's Time Machine, K. W. Jeter's Infernal Devices, Kim Newman's Anno Dracula, Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere, and William Gibson's The Difference Engine, as well as various secondary readings.\n\nRequirements fulfilled:\n\nBritish Literature, Fiction genre\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 5317: Postcolonial Literature: Postcolonial, Decolonial, Digital: One Billion and More Rising\n\nDr. Kanika Batra\n\nR 6:00-8:50PM\n\nCRN: 37200/37203\n\nThe multiple forms of activism we are witnessing in the twenty-first century rely on digital platforms for their success. To consider one example, the One Billion Rising movement deploys texts, technologies, and virtual-physical forms of assembly to bring sexualized violence against women into the public limelight. This course interrogates the foundations and future of such movements by placing them within theorizations of the postcolonial and the decolonial. We will begin our feminist enquiry by examining canonical works by Frantz Fanon, Aime Cesaire, Anibal Quijano, Walter Mignolo, and others. The course then moves into a discussion of nation, narration, and nativism by looking at women's life writings in the Caribbean and Latin America read with and against feminist thought by Sylvia Wynter, Maria Lugones, M. Jacqui Alexander, Emma Perez, and Linda Alcoff. In the final section of the course we examine some digital forums that document the lives of women in the global South by creating archives of activism, including but not limited to the Caribbean and Latin American International Resource Network.\n\nRequirements fulfilled:\n\nCLGT, Methods, Women's Studies Certificate\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 5320: Studies in Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century American Literature: Dissenting Imaginaries: History and Literature of the Early Atlantic World\n\nDr. Dan Hutchins\n\nW 6:00-8:50PM\n\nCRN: 38595/38596\n\nIn this course, we will go a little way towards charting, together, an alternative history for the early Atlantic World (roughly 1500-1800) that highlights intersecting themes such as indigeneity, cultural contact, mestizaje, migration, displacement, autonomy, sovereignty, socialism / collectivism, borders, spirituality, and healing. In doing so, we will seek a hemispheric understanding of the relationships between indigenous peoples, enslaved Africans, Europeans, Europe and the Americas is emphasized. In addition, through works of critical theory and history we will also explore 1) the idea of 'coloniality' as the shadow double of modernity and 2) the alternative epistemologies and histories that have been left out of the official Western knowledge project. I may also end the course with one or two texts of contemporary speculative fiction.\n\nPossible authors may include: Michel de Montaigne, Jean de Léry, Cabeza de Vaca, Lewis & Clark, Guaman Poma de Ayala, William Apess, Françoise de Graffigny, Walter Mignolo, Aníbal Quijano, Hayden White, Gloria Anzaldúa, Immanuel Wallerstein, Ian Baucom, Susan Buck-Morss, Mary Crow Dog, Karl Marx, and Chief Joseph.\n\nRequirements fulfilled:\n\nAmerican Literature, Non-Fiction genre\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 5325: Studies in American Fiction: Nabokov's American Novels\n\nDr. John Samson\n\nM 2:00-4:50PM\n\nCRN: 35491\n\nThe focus of the course will be on Vladimir Nabokov's novels written after he emigrated to America and became an American citizen in the 1940s. Our approach to the novels will be primarily aesthetic, following Nabokov's conception that “For me a work of fiction exists only insofar as it affords me what I shall bluntly call aesthetic bliss, that is a sense of being somehow, somewhere, connected with other states of being where art (curiosity, tenderness, kindness, ecstasy) is the norm.” The texts will be: The Annotated Lolita; Pnin; Pale Fire; Ada, or Ardor; Transparent Things; and Look at the Harlequins!

This course aims to introduce fundamental principles of theoretical syntax and prepare students to take more advanced courses in theoretical syntax and/or to apply the acquired knowledge to conduct research in other related sub-field of linguistics or disciplines such as semantics, language acquisition, natural language processing, language disorders, mass communication, machine translation, and artificial intelligence, to name just a few. Students will learn analytical methods used in syntactic research, in particular how to analyze morpho-syntactic data drawn from various languages, how to formulate plausible hypotheses based on linguistic data, and how to compare and evaluate different theories and/or hypotheses. Topics will include but will not be limited to syntactic categories, phrase structure rules, X-bar syntax, and constraints on movement. The course will be organized around lectures on select topics and discussions on them. The largest portion of the grade will be given to weekly homework assignments and they will make the learning process more gradual and formative than otherwise.\n\nRequirements fulfilled:\n\nLinguistics, Methods, Linguistics Certificate\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 5339: Phonology\n\nDr. Aaron Braver\n\nTR 3:30-4:50PM\n\nCRN: 38953\n\nWhy is \"blick\" a possible word of English, but not \"bnick?\" Why do foreign accents persist even after years of language training?\n\nSpeech sounds are perhaps the most basic building blocks of spoken language, but how do they work? This course provides an overview of the field of phonology—how languages organize, represent, and manipulate their sounds.\n\nWe will begin by discussing the sounds of the world's languages and their articulatory, acoustic, and distributional properties. We will examine why some sounds are allowed in certain parts of a word but not others, how sounds change based on their surroundings, and why foreign accents persist even after years of study.\n\nBoth linguists and non-linguists are encouraged to join this course. Knowledge of sound patterns has important applications across disciplines, including second language acquisition, foreign language teaching, literature, and poetry. If you have ever wondered how the sounds of language work—or how to manipulate them for various effects—this course will be of interest to you.\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 5340: Research Methods\n\nDr. Julie Couch\n\nW 9:00-11:50 AM\n\nCRN: 14987\n\nThis course is an introduction to the methods, processes, and procedures for graduate-level (MA and PhD) research in English and is for students pursuing MA and PhD degrees in English with concentrations primarily in Literature, Linguistics, and Creative Writing. Students will investigate the uses of archival, bibliographic, and web-based sources in graduate-level scholarship.\n\nLiterary criticism and textual scholarship are two routes professional readers take in presenting, interpreting, and teaching works of literature. In this course, we will posit textual scholarship—a discipline that encompasses bibliography, editing, and reception—as foundational to literary research. We will briefly explore its theories and practices, combining theoretical discussion of textual matters such as the nature of texts, authorship, readership, and translation, with practical skills in research and bibliography. In addition to completing a few research exercises, each student will develop a research project that relates to his or her own particular area of interest.\n\nRequirements fulfilled:\n\nFoundation course\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 5342: Critical Methods: Cultural Studies, Literary Theories, Readings\n\nDr. Scott Baugh\n\nT 6:00-8:50PM\n\nCRN: 33345\n\n“Critical Methods” is a graduate seminar designed to survey a range of approaches to reading texts critically. Bring in theory, some naively assume, and you lose the magic of reading; however, it is always already there, and we may gain from being fully aware of our own discursive approaches to reading texts, our critical methods, and articulating them as such, methodologies. We will explore recognized ‘schools' of criticism predominant over the last four decades or so, but we will place emphasis on significant patterns within and among these schools. As a result, we will be able to return to our scholarship in a more serious, more conscious, and more professional way. We will begin, as did Terry Eagleton, with the question, what is literature? We will move, as did Roland Barthes, from work to text. Like Judith Butler, we will inscribe bodies that matter.\n\nMirroring Slavoj Zizek, we may look awry and, following Bakhtin, avoid utter inadequacies. Rather than bound ourselves into a single anthology, an online reserve of readings will include some tried pieces for a course such as this—by Paul de Man, Stanley Fish, Julia Kristeva, Walter Benjamin, Jonathan Culler, Michel Foucault, Laura Mulvey, Manthia Diawara, among others—as well some less-tested ones like Joanna Russ' How to Suppress Women's Writing, Jesús Salvador Treviño's “Thirty Years of Struggle,” video-articles from Wired magazine, and others as they fit.\n\nAs a group, we will cross the range of critical methods, but individually participants will be encouraged to devise particularly relevant projects that facilitate larger research agendas and professional interests. Moreover, as you discover ‘schools' most useful to your own research, then you will have the opportunity to read backward and through earlier influences on that school, potentially exploring pools of information across a number of disciplines including philosophy, history and historiography, sociology, psychology, physics, among others.\n\nFormal requirements: assigned readings & several in-class ‘teaching demo' presentations; one short (5-7 pp.) research essay; one class research presentation; and one article-length (15+ pp.) essay.

We begin by raising a rhetorical question, “Who killed Shakespeare?” and examining the status quo of English studies in the context of the declining humanities and the changing environment for higher education in the twenty-first century. We then explore diachronically formalism, structuralism, deconstruction, post-structuralism, post- colonial and critical race theories, Marxism, and feminism. The focus of our course will be on globalization and transnational studies, ecocriticism and environmental studies, and new media theories, paying special attention to what critics call “the transnational turn” and “the eco-critical turn” in current English and literary studies. We conclude by reflecting upon another rhetorical question, “What happens after post-history and post-theory?”\n\nRequirements fulfilled:\n\nFoundation course\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 5351: Teaching Film and Media Studies\n\nDr. Allison Whitney\n\nM 6:00-8:50PM\n\nCRN: 15008\n\nIn this course, students will learn practical strategies for teaching film and other audio/visual media, while also becoming versed in the history of film instruction, and in the array of ethical, legal, and technical concerns facing educators in this field. While the course will be appropriate for students whose primary focus is film studies, it will also provide valuable expertise to students in other fields who wish to integrate the study of media texts and/or the use of media-based assignments into their curricula. Throughout the semester, students will design syllabi, lesson plans, assignments, and assessment strategies that are germane to their interests, and will also have the opportunity to visit classrooms. Topics will include teaching critical viewing and listening skills, assignment design, accessibility for students with disabilities, the ethics of representation in the classroom (including violence and obscenity), multicultural course design, service learning and community engagement, undergraduate research, copyright law, and online teaching.\n\nRequirements fulfilled:\n\nFilm and Media Studies, Pedagogy, Methods\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 5361: Rhetorical Theory (theory)\n\nDr. Kendall Gerdes\n\nM 6:00-8:50 PM\n\nCRN: 38063\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 5363: Research Methods in TCR (research methods)\n\nDr. Rebecca Rickly\n\nT 6:00-8:50 PM\n\nCRN: 15059\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 5363: Research Methods in TCR (research methods)\n\nDr. Rebecca Rickly\n\nM (TBA)\n\nCRN: --\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 5369: Discourse and Technology (theory & applied theory)\n\nDr. Craig Baehr\n\nR (TBA)\n\nCRN: --\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 5370: Poetry Workshop\n\nDr. Curtis Bauer\n\nW 6:00-8:50PM\n\nCRN: 33026\n\nThis workshop will examine issues of craft and vision through the practice of poetry. We will consider technical and historical aspects of poetry writing, as well as discuss and formulate our own “poetics.” The group will work to form a responsive, critical audience for one another's work.

The semester-long goal: each student will write and workshop the equivalent of 50-65 manuscript pages—whether producing a chapbook, or three singles, or two singles and several flash (whatever combination) to submit throughout and by the end of the semester.\n\nNovels:\n\nKelcey Ervick Parker's Liliane's Balcony (Rose Metal Press)\n\nJenny Offill's Department of Speculation (Vintage)\n\nCollections:\n\nRanda Jarrar's Him Me Muhammad Ali (Sarabande)\n\nJen George's The Babysitter at Rest (Dorothy Project)\n\nChapbooks:\n\nDaniel Riddle Rodriquez's Low Village (Cutbank)\n\nJoe Wilkins's Far Enough (Black Lawrence Press)\n\nTyler Gillepsie's Dirty Socks and Pine Needles (Sibling Rivalry Press)\n\nKate Bernheimer's Floater (Bull City Press)\n\nSingles:\n\nAndria Nacina Cole's “Men Be Better Or, but Never Enough (Ploughshares)\n\nMin Jee Lee's “The Quality of Your Life” (One Story) Celia Laskey's “Come as a Guest” (Amazon Single)\n\nBrandon Davis Jennings “Battle Rattle” (Amazon Single) Melanie Rae Thon's Seventh Man (Diagram/New Michigan Press)\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 5371: Foundations of TCR (theory)\n\nDr. Rachel Wolford\n\nR 6:00-8:50 PM\n\nCRN: --\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 5371: Foundations of TCR (theory)\n\nDr. Ken Baake\n\nR (TBA)\n\nCRN: 32543\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 5374: Technical Editing (applied theory)\n\nDr. Kelli Cargile-Cook\n\nW 6:00-8:50 PM\n\nCRN: 38777\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 5385: Ethics (theory)\n\nDr. Kristen Moore\n\nM 6:00-8:50 PM\n\nCRN: 38770\n\nHow ought we to make decisions as rhetoricians, technical communicators, educators, and citizens in the world? Traditionally, technical communicators call on ethical frameworks to ensure that they've engaged responsibly with their daily work and projects. But ethical frameworks do not necessarily compel actors to question the justice of their actions. This course explores the ways decisions in environmental, medical, institutional, and political contexts might be both ethical and socially just. We'll explore the relationship between ethics and justice through cases, legal and government reports, and theoretical treatise. We will read from a range of texts, but expect to order some (if not all) of these books:\n\nAhmed, S. (2012). On Being Included: Racism & Diversity in Institutional Live.

Students are expected to bring a body of work into the class to hone and submit, and while the number of individual items will vary by student and genre, the material should comprise anywhere from a minimum of fifteen pages (i.e., a chapbook of poetry or flash) to a maximum of seventy-five pages (novella, chapbook of essays or stories, or several works of translation). Students will engage in partner and small- group critique, and research appropriate venues for their work.\n\nIn addition to preparing creative work for publication, students will engage in a range of other writing projects intended to support their professional development as working writers, completing: a) an interview with the writer of their choice, b) a book review of a work published in the last year, and c) a residency, conference, grant, or fellowship application accompanied by a presentation on their target opportunity. Several times throughout the semester, Skype interviews will be held with agents, editors, publishers, and other such literary professionals. Select texts from works such as The New Writer's Handbook and magazines like Poets & Writers and Writer's Chronicle will inform discussions on querying agents, writing synopses, submitting to contests, working with editors, targeting publishers, creating an author website, maintaining a social media presence, writing craft articles, grant writing, and other aspects of building a writing career.\n\nRequirements fulfilled:\n\nProfessional Development\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 5390: Writing for Publication: Literature Emphasis\n\nDr. Jen Shelton\n\nM 6:00-8:50PM\n\nCRN: 35504\n\nThis course gives students practice in constructing documents for professional venues, including conferences and academic journals. Students will learn to draft proposals, annotated bibliographies, book reviews, conference papers and presentations, and essays for submission to peer-reviewed journals. Students whose professional goals are directed toward teaching situations will learn how to adapt these academic practices for their situations. Students should expect substantial writing and independent research as well as participation in peer-writing groups. The course meets online. Students will need a computer with stable internet access, a headset with microphone, and a Skype account to access course meetings.\n\nRequirements fulfilled:\n\nProfessional Development\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 5390: Writing for Publication\n\nDr. Marta Kvande\n\nT 2:00-4:50PM\n\nCRN: 15389\n\nThis is a pragmatic course focusing on the process of preparing an essay for submission to a peer-reviewed journal and on professional activity more broadly. Students must begin the course with a previously-prepared article-length critical paper (5,000 to 7,000 words), usually one from a previous graduate course. Revising this essay for publication (including peer workshops and other revision practices) will be one of the major projects of the course. In addition, students will also learn and practice other aspects of the scholarly process, such as preparing and presenting conference-length papers, determining appropriate venues for their work (both conferences and journals), composing cover letters, applying for grants, writing book proposals, and writing book reviews, among other scholarly genres and conventions. This course satisfies the requirement in Professional Development.\n\nRequirements fulfilled:\n\nProfessional Development\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 5390: Writing for Publication (applied)\n\nDr. Greg Wilson\n\nW (TBA)\n\nCRN: --\n\nReturn to top\n\nENGL 5391: Grants & Proposals for Nonprofits (applied theory)\n\nDr. Angela Eaton\n\nT 6:00-8:50 PM\n\nCRN: 36382\n\nReturn to top"
