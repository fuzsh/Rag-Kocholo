        "text": "Kellie Harrington is reaping the rewards of two years' hard work as she has revealed the results of her house renovation.\n\nThe Olympic boxer, 34, bought her first house with her wife Mandy Loughlin back in 2022 and they have poured in hours of hard work transforming the property and turning their 'vision' into 'reality'.\n\nToday's top videos\n\nTheir home is located in Portland Row in north inner city Dublin - just a few doors down from Kellie's own family home - and looked completely different when they bought it.\n\nThe façade of the property was painted a dull grey concrete colour when they first got the keys, however after hours of painstaking work, chipping away at the material, they have revealed a gorgeous red brick underneath.\n\nKellie clearly put in her own sweat and tears into the project as she shared a video of her working away on the outside of the house.\n\nShe gave her followers a tour of the property entrance, revealing the finished red brick façade, a pebbled front garden, a lilac door and a personalised touch on the letterbox.\n\nIn case any visitors weren't sure, they'll know they are arriving to the home of an Olympian as the letterbox is engraved with the five Olympic rings!\n\nOnce inside, Kellie gave us an insight into her taste in interior design, with a checkered black-and-white tiled floor and a wooden staircase with a cream runner in a chevron pattern.\n\nSharing the images, Kellie wrote: 'A vision that took time, a vision many said I was mad for having, but a vision I am glad we stuck with making it a reality... really looking forward to making many great memories with Mandy after the Olympic Games.\n\n'Home is wherever and what you make it.'\n\nPurchasing a property right down the road from her parents was a clever move from Kellie and Mandy as the boxer's dad helped them with property renovations.\n\nNow that Kellie has cemented her name in the history books as Ireland's only female two-time Olympic gold medalist, she has announced her retirement with the view of enjoying the 'next chapter' of her life with Mandy in their newly-renovated 'dream home'.\n\nSpeaking in a post-bout interview, Kellie said: 'The next chapter is going to be my life chapter. It’s for me and Mandy now to do what we’re doing. Who knows what that’s going to be? But I can’t wait to just live my life, not that I’m not living my life... that’s like, what are you talking about.'\n\nWe're so excited to see what the future holds for Kellie and Mandy!"
