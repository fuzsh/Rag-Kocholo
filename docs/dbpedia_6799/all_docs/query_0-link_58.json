        "text": "Wake up, sleepyheads—it's time to enter The Dreaming again! Neil Gaiman's incredible characters from the DC comic series The Sandman are back to invade your dreams, beginning September 22, in the exciting Audible Original production, The Sandman: Act II. And just like with the first installment, The Sandman, the list of celebrity talents lending their voices to the cast is just jaw-dropping.\n\nThe Sandman: Act II continues the adventures of Morpheus (James McAvoy), also known as Dream, and his six siblings, including Destiny (Jeffrey Wright), Death (Kat Dennings), Delirium (Kristen Schaal), and Despair (Miriam Margolyes). Follow along as their journey continues, unraveling haunting tales of mythology and history in our world and theirs. They'll be joined by witch Thessaly (Emma Corrin), and appear in stories featuring Emperor Augustus (Brian Cox), Orpheus (Regé-Jean Page), Lady Johanna Constantine (Joanna Lumley), and Emperor Joshua Norton (John Lithgow).\n\nWhy wait for the television series adaptation of The Sandman, set to premiere on Netflix sometime in 2022, when you can immerse yourself in the world of The Dreaming right now with an unforgettable audio experience? The star power alone is worth the price of admission—the cumulative amount of awards that have been won by the cast over the course of their careers is simply staggering. The cast features some of the most talented and esteemed actors working today, and the excitement over the stars and the release of next installment has been immense. So let's dive right into the who's who of The Sandman: Act II.\n\nJames McAvoy as Morpheus\n\nScottish actor James McAvoy made his first memorable mark on the big screen as Mr. Tumnus, the faun, in the Disney adaptation of C. S. Lewis'sThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005). A series of larger roles quickly followed, notably as Idi Amin's doctor in The Last King of Scotland (2006) and as a soldier in Atonement (2007). Comic fans might recognize him from his turn as a young Professor Charles Xavier in the latest round of X-Men films (and Deadpool II). Most recently, McAvoy has appeared on HBO's adaptation of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials (2019-2021) and in Together (2021), a film about a couple in COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nEmma Corrin as Thessaly\n\nAlthough English actress Emma Corrin's career is still in its early stage, she has already made a huge impression on the industry. Along with a few smaller roles, Corrin's work includes a recurring character on the series Pennyworth (2019-), which is about the origins of Bruce Wayne's butler, Alfred. But it was her recent performance as Princess Diana in season four of The Crown (2020) that had critics and audiences standing up and taking notice. For her portrayal of Princess Di, Corrin received a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series: Drama; two Golden Derby Awards; and several prestigious nominations. She will next be seen in the film My Policeman.\n\nBrian Cox as Augustus\n\nAnyone who's a fan of HBO's recent smash hit Succession (2018) will immediately recognize Brian Cox as the Roy family patriarch. While it's a standout role, the Scottish veteran of stage and screen has had a long and illustrious career. Cox has appeared in dozens of television productions and graced the big screen in huge movies such as Rob Roy (1995), Braveheart (1995), Rushmore (1998), and The Bourne Supremacy (2004). What's more, as too few people realize, Cox was actually the first actor to portray Dr. Hannibal Lecter, in the the first screen adaptation of the novel Red Dragon: Michael Mann's Manhunter (1986). It's also worth noting that (like Kat Dennings in the two Audible Original Sandman productions), he has voiced Death, lending his talents to several episodes of the series Good Omens (2019).\n\nKat Dennings as Death\n\nPennsylvania native Kat Dennings got her acting start on an episode of Sex in the City (2000). That led to a role as Bob Saget's older daughter on the short-lived series Raising Dad (2001). She continued on through the first decade of the 21st century with several smaller roles, including turns on ER (2005) and in The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005), before her breakout starring role alongside Michael Cera in Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist (2008). She has since appeared in dozens more roles of note, including Thor (2011), and had starring roles in the sitcom 2 Broke Girls (2011-2017) and the Hulu show Dollface (2019). She most recently appeared in the miniseries WandaVision (2021). And Dennings is no stranger to voice work. She has had guest appearances on The Simpsons (2017), Robot Chicken (2012), and American Dad (2009). She was also the voice of Leah Birch on the Netflix animated series Big Mouth (2017).\n\nJohn Lithgow as Emperor Joshua Norton\n\nJohn Lithgow was born into the business—his mother was an actress; his father worked in the theater as a director and producer. Though he launched his onscreen career in the 1970s in several small roles in film and television, it was his turn as transgender ex-football player Roberta Muldoon in The World According to Garp (1982) that first gained him attention and accolades, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Two years later, he would be nominated for that same award for his work in Terms of Endearment (1984). Lithgow's career continued with dozens of roles, including the outraged reverend in Footloose (1984), the loving father in Harry and the Hendersons (1987), the unhinged villain in Cliffhanger (1994), and the voice of Lord Farquaad, the main antagonist in Shrek (2001). But it was his role as Dick Solomon, the leader of a group of aliens masquerading as a typical human family, in the hit sitcom 3rd Rock from the Sun (1996-2001) that brought him into the most homes and hearts, earning him several nominations and awards. Lithgow has gone on to be nominated for several more of his roles on television series, includingDexter (2009), The Crown (2016), and Perry Mason (2020). He's also no stranger to audio work; we adore his performances in both The Didomenico Fragment and Stories by Heart.\n\nJoanna Lumley as Lady Johanna Constantine\n\nWhat two words best sum up British actress Joanna Lumley? Absolutely fabulous. While Lumley has had a long, successful career in show business, she is best known for her award-winning role as the always-inebriated, chain-smoking Patty on the enormously popular comedy series Absolutely Fabulous (1992-2012). Lumley started her career as a model and was first recognized for her role in The New Avengers (1976-1977). One of the UK's most beloved and talented actresses, this star of stage and screen has appeared in such other hits as James and the Giant Peach (1996), Ella Enchanted (2004), and Paddington 2 (2017). She can most recently be found on the TV comedy-drama Finding Alice (2021) and the film adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray (2021).\n\nMiriam Margoyles as Despair\n\nA veteran of stage and screen for more than half a century, versatile award-winning British actress Miriam Margolyes has 187 acting credits under her belt, including her award-nominated turns in The Age of Innocence (1993) and Little Dorrit (1987). She has had roles in hit movies such as I Love You To Death (1990), Babe (1995), andHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002). She was featured as Aunt Prudence in the TV series Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries (2012-2015) and made a memorable appearance as Sister Mildred in an episode of Call the Midwife (2018). Her esteemed talents can most recently be seen in her role as Queen Victoria in The Windsors (2020).\n\nBebe Neuwirth as Bast\n\nBebe Neuwirth is immediately recognizable for her Emmy Award-winning role as Lilith Crane, the no-nonsense wife (and then ex-wife) of Frasier Crane on Cheers (1982-1993) and Frasier (1993-2004). Beyond her sitcom fame, Neuwirth is an accomplished singer and dancer, noted for her Tony Award-winning roles in the Broadway revivals of Sweet Charity (1986) and Chicago (1996). She has been featured in recurring roles on series such as The Good Wife (2012-2013), Madam Secretary (2014-2017), and Blue Bloods (2013-2014; 2017-2019). Neuwirth can most recently be seen in the hit HBO series The Flight Attendant (2020) and will definitely be heard in the upcoming animated series Teenage Euthanasia.\n\nBill Nighy as Odin\n\nBeloved character actor Bill Nighy has been acting for more than four decades and has 155 acting credits in his accomplished career. Listeners may recognize his voice from his onscreen roles as Davy Jones in Pirates of the Caribbean (2006), Billy Mack in Love, Actually (2003), Philip in Shaun of the Dead (2004), and Minister Rufus Scrimgeour in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2010). Throughout his storied career, Nighy has also had roles in such hits as The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005), The Constant Gardener (2005), and Ordeal by Innocence (2018). Most recently, he can be seen in Castlevania (2020) and Buckley's Chance (2021).\n\nRegé-Jean Page as Orpheus\n\nAnyone who watched the first season of Bridgerton (2020) on Netflix will instantly recognize the voice of Regé-Jean Page, whose acting work as Simon Bassett catapulted him into superstardom. And while Page will not be returning for the next season, he can soon be seen in the films The Gray Man (2022) and Dungeons & Dragons (2023). Fans can also see him in his accomplished past roles, such as Solanio in The Merchant of Venice (2016) and Leonard Knox in the series For the People (2018-2019).\n\nKristen Schaal as Delirium\n\nAmerican actress Kristen Schaal has a voice made for narration. Her unique sound and pitch-perfect delivery can be heard in her long-running performance of Louise Belcher on Bob's Burgers (2011-2021), as well as in the acclaimed animated series Gravity Falls (2012-2013) and BoJack Horseman (2014-2020), which earned her an Emmy nomination. Schaal is also a versatile character actor, appearing in more than one hundred roles in films and television, including parts in Flight of the Conchords (2007), 30 Rock (2012), The Last Man on Earth (2015), and, most recently, The Mysterious Benedict Society (2021).\n\nAndy Serkis as Matthew the Raven\n\nAnother actor known for his work both on and off the screen, talented English actor Andy Serkis has appeared onscreen hidden behind makeup and animation more often than he has appeared as himself. With his incredible range of vocal work, his most famous roles include Gollum in the Lord of the Rings film trilogy (2001-2003), Caesar in the Planet of the Apes remakes (2011, 2014, and 2017), and Supreme Leader Snoke in the most recent Star Wars trilogy (2015, 2017, and 2019). Serkis can most recently be seen in the flesh in the television series The Letter for the King (2020).\n\nMichael Sheen as Lucifer\n\nIn The Sandman and The Sandman: Act II, accomplished Welsh actor Michael Sheen is the voice of Lucifer, which fits him just fine. Over his impressive career, Sheen has played several supernatural roles, including a werewolf in the Underworld film series (2003, 2006, 2009); a vampire in the Twilight Saga movies New Moon (2009), Eclipse (2010), and Breaking Dawn (2011, 2012); and the fussy angel Aziraphale in the series Good Omens (2019). He has had roles in such hit series as 30 Rock (2010), Masters of Sex (2013), and The Good Fight (2019). He is also well known for playing David Frost in the Academy Award-nominated Frost/Nixon (2008) and can be heard as the voice of the white rabbit in Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland (2010). He can currently be seen playing a serial killer in the series Prodigal Son (2019-2021).\n\nKevin Smith as Merv Pumpkinhead\n\nActor, writer, and director Kevin Smith got his start by making his own low-budget film, Clerks (1994), which became a cult classic, and his role in it as the lovable Silent Bob, who became one of the most memorable characters of the 1990s. Smith has reprised the role for multiple films and shows and has also directed several films since his debut, including Mallrats (1995) and Chasing Amy (1996). He is presently working on filming Clerks III. A self-described nerd, Smith has lent his voice to several superhero and science fiction cartoons, movies, and video games.\n\nDavid Tennant as Loki\n\nWhile many of the actors in the Audible Original productions of The Sandman can claim to have appeared on the sci-fi smash Doctor Who, none can claim to have actually been the Doctor themself—except for Scottish actor David Tennant. Tennant played the Tenth Doctor for three seasons (2006-2008), as well as in nine specials. And while it may be the role he is best known for playing, he has 149 other stage and screen acting credits to his name. More recently, he has had starring roles in the series Broadchurch (2013-2017), as a detective working alongside the brilliant Olivia Colman, and as the major villain in Jessica Jones (2015-2017). Tennant also starred opposite another Sandman voice actor, Michael Sheen, in his role as Crowley in Good Omens (2019).\n\nNiamh Walsh as Nuala\n\nWhile young Irish-born actress Niamh Walsh may not have as accomplished a career (so far) as many of the other Sandman cast members, she has had roles in several great productions. She landed her first leading role in the series Jamestown (2017-2019) and appeared with fellow Sandman cast members Michael Sheen, Brian Cox, and David Tennant in Good Omens (2019). Most recently, she can be seen starring in the six-part Netflix drama The English Game (2020) and the ongoing mystery-family drama series Smother (2021-).\n\nJeffrey Wright as Destiny\n\nJeffrey Wright has received more acting accolades than we have space to mention—he's just that good. His breakout role in Hollywood was his heart-wrenching portrayal of young artist Jean Michel Basquiat in the film Basquiat (1996). Wright has had major roles in hit series such as Angels in America (2003),Boardwalk Empire (2010-2014), and Westworld (2016-), for which he received an Emmy nomination. He is known to James Bond fans for playing fellow spy Felix Leiter in Casino Royale (2006), Quantum of Solace (2008), and, most recently, No Time to Die (2021). He will soon be appearing as Commissioner Gordon in the upcoming film The Batman (2022) and has a role in a yet-to-be-titled Wes Anderson film, also coming next year.\n\nNeil Gaiman as The Narrator\n\nAnd last but not least, we come to the narrator of The Sandman and The Sandman: Act II, the creator of the series himself: Neil Gaiman. Several of Gaiman's works have now been adapted for the screen, including Neverwhere (1997), Stardust (2007), Coraline (2009), American Gods (2017-2021), and Good Omens (2019). Television adaptations of The Sandman and Anansi Boys are headed our way in the near future, and an adaptation of his best-selling YA novel The Graveyard Book has been announced."
