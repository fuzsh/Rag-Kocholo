        "text": "Dear Prudence is Slate’s advice column. Submit questions here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI am happily married and have been with my wife for almost five years. We have a great relationship and tell each other everything—to a fault on my part, so it seems. I mentioned to her that many years ago, I dated a woman in a different country. She is triggered any time that this country comes up in the news, accents in movies, etc. I do not think about this relationship at all but she seems disgusted with me whenever the slightest related thing reminds her of this long passed relationship. Do you have any advice on how I can help ease her frustration and discomfort? This past relationship is just that, in my past, though it seems that my wife is forever pained by it.\n\n—Hoping She Can Move Past\n\nDear Hoping,\n\nWhen I first skimmed your letter I assumed you’d cheated with a woman from a different country. But no, you dated this woman in your past, before you ever even met your wife. Wow.\n\nSo one of two things is going on here. It could be that your wife is extremely, deeply jealous and some part of her is thinking that this ex-girlfriend was better than her in some way, that you still have feelings for her, or that you secretly want to go to that other country to find her and reconnect. If that’s the case, you can offer patience and reassurance when she hears an Australian accent and begins to spiral, but it’s above your pay grade to get to the root of the problem. You should go to couple’s therapy, which will hopefully lead to both of you (especially her!) doing your own individual work.\n\nThe other possibility—and this occurred to me because you don’t mention a pattern of jealousy, and because you use the word “disgusted” when describing her reaction to any mention of this country—is that there’s some kind of xenophobia or racism at play. If you suspect this is even at all possible, ask some probing questions about the source of her issues with the country in question and the people who live there. Ask her about why it’s so upsetting for her to think about your connection to it. You might learn something about her worldview that is upsetting. But it will be better to know who she is and to make whatever decision you need to make based on that intel than it will be to wonder why she’s suddenly outraged every time you’re watching the news and the word “immigration” is mentioned.\n\nGive Prudie a Hand in “We’re Prudence”\n\nSometimes even Prudence needs a little help. This week’s tricky situation is below. Submit your comments about how to approach the situation here to Jenée, and then look back for the final answer here on Friday.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI have moved a lot in my life. At first, it was due to divorced parents and then it just became my pattern. I’ve been in my current spot for 20 years now though and I’m a fun-loving person. I always have a large group of friends around. However, I haven’t had a bestie since I was 12 and It seems like I just don’t ever get to that level with friends. I desperately want a ride-or-die, close friendship. I’ve tried everything I know to be vulnerable, supportive, interested, attentive, etc. and to let certain women know I adore their company and want to lean in more but it never “takes.” I’m coming to fear I’m only superficially likable and maybe that’s true. Yet I’ve seen all types of folks have besties. I’m surrounded by lovely people but I’m lonely. Why am I never on the shortlist for the real deal, genuine best friend?\n\n—Why Not Me\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI have a car. My girlfriend doesn’t. Usually, I am fine about driving her places to take care of errands, but her two new roommates are driving me nuts. They just invite themselves along whenever we go out and make demands to stop at other shops because they happen to be along the way. What should be a short trip to the grocery store turns into a two or three-hour-long affair because they can find item A at this store so we have to try another one. Or they forgot item B and needed to go back. They never offer to pay for gas or get a meal unless I have to prompt them. It is like pulling teeth.\n\nMy girlfriend had a bad fallout with some of her friends and has been lonely. She really likes the company of her roommates and bends over backward for them. We keep fighting about it. I finally snapped when they invited themselves to a fair that I was taking my girlfriend to on a date. They proceed to ditch us and refuse to answer their phones when it comes time to leave. We couldn’t find them. I had an early morning because of work. My girlfriend refused to leave without them so I gave up and said she could stay with me or wait and get an Uber. She chose Uber. I later apologized but we still fight all the time about it. I love my girlfriend but I feel like I am at a breaking point. Help!\n\n—Not a Taxi\n\nDear Not a Taxi,\n\nYour girlfriend is prioritizing her new and much-needed friendships over her relationship with you. Given that I get a “We’re all pretty new to being adults” feeling from your letter, I don’t actually think that’s a terrible idea, especially as she works to recreate her social circle after having lost a few people. It’s a healthy instinct for her to want to solidify her closeness with the people she lives with, who could be in her life long after the two of you break up. But she’s not navigating this well, She’s taking advantage of you and she’s being a jerk about it.\n\nThe solution, as you’ve learned, isn’t to get into situations in which you feel used and then fight about it. Instead, you should decide what you are and aren’t willing to do. So you might say something like, “I’d really like to hang out one-on-one. Let me know if you have any time this weekend,” or “I need a break from including your roommates when we go places in my car. Making extra stops and wrangling everyone when it’s time to leave the outings makes it more stressful for me. I wanted to let you know so you can tell them and we can make sure they aren’t relying on me for any rides tomorrow.”\n\nThere is a decent chance your girlfriend won’t take this well, and won’t want to see you as much. That will tell you a lot about how she values you in comparison to your vehicle, and in comparison to her friends. If this is what she communicates, remember, don’t fight it. There are plenty of people who would be happy to date you and enjoy your company without the expectation that you serve as a free Uber, but arguing with her won’t turn her into one of them.\n\nHow to Get Advice From Prudie\n\nSubmit your questions anonymously here. (Questions may be edited for publication.)\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy nephew announced his engagement to “Bree,” A friend of mine used to babysit my nephew as a child and offered a free engagement shoot. They are semi-professional photographers. Well, Bree turned out to be a diva. She wasn’t content with having the shoot in town but wanted a place 75 miles away. My friend arrived to set up only for Bree to call and cancel because her make-up artist flaked, so no shoot. She wasn’t apologetic at all. I was so embarrassed that I paid the cancellation fee and gas for my friend.\n\nMy friend went on to contact my nephew with an offer to do a low-cost shoot in town. Bree threw a fit that it wasn’t her dream and made false and unflattering reports on social media. She later deleted them but this is my friend’s livelihood! At this point, I was fed up and told my nephew to consider the money I paid my friend to be their wedding gift from me. I have been very generous to my other nieces and nephews but not one of them acted as horribly as Bree. My nephew and sister are upset with me. They were counting on the money. This has caused a large amount of drama. What should I do now?\n\n—Drama in Dallas\n\nDear Drama in Dallas,\n\nYour friend sounds like a very generous person who is not great at business and is not a good custodian of their own livelihood. There was no reason for them to offer a free shoot, to agree to do it 75 miles away, or to reach back out after that incident to suggest doing it at a different location. And while it goes without saying that Bree behaved badly at every possible moment, this whole debacle is between the two of them—your friend and the person they used to babysit. Not you. You aren’t part of the story and you aren’t at fault. You didn’t ask for the favor, introduce them, or promise your friend that Bree was a delightful person who would be easygoing and write her a glowing Yelp review. Therefore, you had no reason to be embarrassed and no obligation to pay the cancellation fee.\n\nYou’ve gotten yourself emotionally and financially entangled in something that’s none of your business. That’s your mistake, and your nephew (who has done nothing wrong except possibly picking a life partner with a bad personality!) shouldn’t pay for it. Take a deep breath, let all of this go, and give the wedding gift you would have given before you spontaneously and unnecessarily threw your money out the window.\n\nWant Advice on Parenting, Kids, or Family Life?\n\nSubmit your questions to Care and Feeding here. It’s anonymous! (Questions may be edited for publication.)\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI’m a 48 M and I have a sister who has four kids (two boys and two girls). My sister and I have a decent relationship, mostly because we give each other a lot of space to avoid conflict. I’m fairly supportive of the kids (I have none), but I don’t always hold my tongue if I disagree with them. A few years ago, my nephew decided to buy an old dodge charger (think serial killer). I advised him against it, since it looked like it needed a lot of repairs. He bought it anyway. It broke down less than a year later.\n\nFast forward several years later: This rusty car still doesn’t work. I periodically remind him and his mom that they need to get rid of that car. They aren’t concerned. I recently purchased a luxury SUV and every time I’m home, I have to park on the street because of that car. It’s not even fully parked up the driveway. My mom avoids conflict, so she won’t force the issue. I’ve thought about reporting it to the HOA, but I’m pretty sure the family will know who reported it. I’ve thought about having it towed myself, but that feels wrong. I’m just not sure what to do about this.\n\n—Sick of this Hooptie!\n\nDear Sick of This,\n\nPolitical organizing. Volunteering. A fitness challenge. A cooking class. Arts and crafts. Bingeing Netflix shows. This is a list of possible places to redirect your attention and energy as you pull it away from an old car that is not at your home, is not costing you any money, and has absolutely nothing to do with you. You may have been totally right about the misguided purchase of the charger, but the reward for that is that you get to say to yourself, “I knew it,” not that you get to enforce your rules for someone else’s driveway. Parking on the street will not hurt you. Pissing off your sister and nephew by criticizing them and making their life hard ultimately will.\n\nClassic Prudie"
