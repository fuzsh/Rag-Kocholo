So after calling off their engagement, he decides to marry Tarji (Betta St. John), a Middle Eastern princess who is far less liberated. However, foreign customs dictate that the wedding must wait several months, during which time he and Tarji must live apart. As the new bride adjusts to Western ways, State Department employee Effie is assigned to chaperone the pair, further complicating matters.",
