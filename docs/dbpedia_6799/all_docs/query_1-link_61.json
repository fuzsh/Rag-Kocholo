        "text": "The IMportance of a Tag\n\n1. What is a movie tagline?\n\nThe best tagline is a delicate art unto itself. A balance of informative, compelling, and silly. The very best ones cut dangerously close to the very worst.\n\nSo what's the secret?\n\nHow can you learn the art of the tagline? Let's first define it. Then we'll start in the past.\n\nTAGLINE DEFINITION\n\nWhat is a tagline?\n\nA movie tagline is a short text which serves to clarify an idea for, or is designed with a form of, dramatic effect. Many tagline slogans are reiterated phrases associated with the film.\n\nGeneral considerations for movie taglines:\n\nIt can speak directly to the plot of the film\n\nIt can speak to the experience you might have watching the film\n\nIt will often use puns or turns of phrase\n\nSome examples of movie taglines could be unrelated to the plot of the movie. They can also be super plot-specific.\n\nSome work because of the puns. Others work because they don't work at all. But they are concise and memorable.\n\nLet's take a walk down memory lane.\n\nClassic Movie Taglines\n\n2. A look at the classics\n\nAhh, the classics. Some of them feel a little dated, but the core of what would define the greatest taglines were established in the early days.\n\nDouble Indemnity\n\n\"From the moment they met it was murder.\"\n\nOne of the great noir tagline examples\n\nBilly Wilder's Double Indemnity is a work of noir genius. Every line of dialogue is as sharp as the tagline itself. If you haven't seen it, you're in for a treat.\n\nLearn more dialogue tips for your own writing and also for your inevitable tagline. It might spark the creativity that you need.\n\nFather of the Bride\n\n\"The Bride gets the THRILLS, the father gets the BILLS.\"\n\nThis one feels a bit dated, but the rhyme works, and the comedy of the situation is pretty clear.\n\nThe Lady Eve\n\n\"When you deal a fast shuffle, love is in the cards.\"\n\nAnother Barbara Stanwyck starrer, The Lady Eve is about a con where real feelings get involved. There is a pivotal card game as well, so the famous tagline says it all in snappy fashion.\n\n12 Angry Men\n\n\"Life is in their hands -- Death is on their minds.\"\n\nMore Henry Fonda! Sidney Lumet's terse jury room drama gets a movie tagline that brings the stakes to the fore. This is necessary because it's a movie about a conversation in one room.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven\n\n\"They were 7... and they fought like 700.\"\n\nA play upon the number in the title that also gets us excited for an epic showdown. The best movie taglines do this with such ease.\n\nEasy Rider\n\n\"A man went looking for America, and he couldn't find it anywhere.\"\n\nEasy Rider was a true game changer. The tagline, and movie capture a cultural moment where everything shifted. It speaks to a specific movement. Powerful.\n\nThe Sound of Music\n\n\"The Happiest Sound in All the World.\"\n\nPerhaps the most famous musical of all time, with a movie tagline that emphasizes genre and a desired emotional result.\n\nSome modern musicals like \"La La Land\" stand without a tagline but captured audiences in a very different way. Learn more about how to write a musical, and analyze the hit.\n\nTaxi Driver\n\n\"On every street in every city in this country, there is a nobody who dreams of being a somebody.\"\n\nIntrigued? Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader's study of existential loneliness is a film buff favorite. Robert De Niro had already broken out, but as Travis Bickle, he became a true screen icon.\n\nBonnie and Clyde\n\n\"They're young, they're in love, and they kill people.\"\n\nThe \"sudden left turn approach\" teases our interest. Juxtapose the young couple with murder, and you've got people hooked.\n\nHigh Noon\n\n\"The story of a man who was too proud to run.\"\n\nOne of the most memorable movie tags\n\nPure, straightforward and admirable. A lot like it's star, Gary Cooper. If you aren't inspired by the old-fashioned heroism hinted at in this movie tagline, you will be when you see the movie.\n\nTreasure of the Sierra Madre\n\n\"The nearer they get to the treasure the farther they get from the law.\"\n\nAnother movie tagline that implies an uncertain danger within the story, almost asking the audience a question.\n\nCOMEDIC MOVIE TAGLINES\n\n3. These get â€˜em laughing\n\nComedy is a great genre mainly if you're looking for the best taglines. Best taglines often have a little humor even if the subject matter isn't a comedy in nature... If it is?\n\nWell, then they have free reign to be silly. Here are our picks for the best:\n\nDumb and Dumber\n\n\"For Harry and Lloyd, every day is a no-brainer.\"\n\nAccurate.\n\nGhostbusters\n\n\"Who you gonna call?\"\n\nThis is one of those best taglines that became synonymous with the movie itself, and part of the cultural lexicon.\n\nCatch Me if You Can\n\n\"The true story of a real fake.\"\n\nA fun play on words which is an excellent movie tagline tactic, and reflects this particular movie's plot.\n\nGrosse Pointe Blank\n\n\"Even a hitman deserves a second shot.\"\n\nThe title is a pun; the tagline is a pun. If you don't like puns, you probably don't like movie taglinesâ€¦\n\nNaked Gun 33 & â…“\n\n\"From the brother of the director of Ghost.\"\n\nThe Naked Gun movies are spoofs. The taglines are spoofs of taglines. Here, they take on the movie tagline tactic of mentioning tenuous connections to recent big hits.\n\nNaked Gun\n\n\"If you only see one movie this year... you need to get out more often.\"\n\nAnother funny parody of a typical movie tagline tactic.\n\nOffice Space\n\n\"Work sucks.\"\n\nIt's funny because it's true.\n\nWeekend at Bernie's\n\n\"He may be dead but heâ€™s the life of the party.\"\n\nWeekend at Bernie's belongs on any list. It would be here even if the tagline was awful. Fortunately, it's pretty good.\n\nA personal favorite\n\nTommy Boy\n\n\"If at first you don't succeed, lower your standards.\"\n\nThe beloved Farley and Spade comedy has a great tagline. This tactic is to put a spin on a well-known turn of phrase. It's effective and done in taglines quite a bit.\n\nChicken Run\n\n\"Escape or die frying.\"\n\nPuns. Common sayings. Short and to the point. This one has it all.\n\nThe Truman Show\n\n\"On the air and unaware.\"\n\nThis tagline tells you the story of the movie with a nice little rhyme. This sort of movie tagline is part of why people sometimes confuse a tagline with the more informative cousin: the logline.\n\nIf you want to know more this, check out our post on how to formulate loglines.\n\nStudioBinder also provides an entirely free masterclass for tv writing. Video essays like \"How to Write a Treatment\" can be very helpful in the stages prior to crafting your tagline.\n\nMars Attacks!\n\n\"Nice Planet. We'll take it\"\n\nSimple, yet effective.\n\nOâ€™ Brother Where Art Thou\n\n\"They have a plan but not a clue\"\n\nThis one is a lot like the Dumb and Dumber tagline, but not quite as strong because it doesn't tell us that much about the movie.\n\nFerris Bueller's Day Off\n\n\"One man's struggle to take it easy.\"\n\nAn effective tactic in many of the best taglines is to combine opposites. A struggle to take it easy is a contradiction. It makes us wonder a bit. It catches us off guard. Keep this in mind when you think about taglines, or getting people's attention. It works.\n\nIrony in tags\n\nMy Cousin Vinny\n\n\"A comedy of trial and error.\"\n\nEvery comedy that has a courtroom involved is forever jealous of My Cousin Vinny for nabbing this one.\n\nThe First Wives Club\n\n\"Don't get mad. Get everything.\"\n\nThere can be no more perfect tagline for a movie about divorce.\n\nHot Shots! Part Deux\n\n\"Just Deux it.\"\n\nHotshots went with the French word for two in their sequel. Combine that with Nike's famous slogan, and you have a solid comedy tagline.\n\nHorror Movie Taglines\n\n4. Make them scream\n\nThe best horror taglines tease out the fear factor in an audience. But they sometimes play with comedic elements like any other tagline might.\n\nGremlins 2\n\n\"Here they grow again.\"\n\nAnother pun. This one feels pretty close to comedy.\n\nThe Thing\n\n\"Man is the warmest place to hide.\"\n\nThis tagline is both disgusting and a little funny. You want to know more, and you don'tâ€¦\n\nWhatever Happened to Baby Jane\n\n\"Sister, sister oh so fair why is there blood all over your hair?\"\n\nThe sister on sister crimes of this cult classic are all on full creepy display in the tagline.\n\nJaws\n\n\"You'll never go in the water again.\"\n\nFor many moviegoers, this tagline came true.\n\nNightmare on Elm Street\n\n\"If Nancy doesn't wake up screaming, she won't wake up at all...\"\n\nThis poster is paired perfectly with its tagline\n\nThis tagline exemplified the horror movie craze of the 1980's. The tagline and the movie poster captures exactly what makes Nightmare on Elm street scary.\n\nDisney Movie Taglines\n\n5. A whole new world\n\nDisney has its own unique and compelling kind of branding. They've built an actual media empire, and the movies and their taglines have been a part of it.\n\nPinocchio\n\n\"For anyone who ever wished upon a star.\"\n\nThis movie belongs in the horror section. Scariest movie ever. In their marketing genius, Disney gave it a tagline that makes it seem whimsical and full of magic.\n\nSnow White\n\n\"Still the fairest of them all.\"\n\nDisney's classic\n\nSnow White was Disney's first animated feature. This movie tagline for the rerelease played on the nostalgia for the groundbreaking film and its lush visuals.\n\nThe tagline says it all\n\nCinderella\n\n\"Midnight never strikes when you're in love.\"\n\nThis is clever, but I actually feel like it's not true in the plot. Doesn't midnight strike when she's in love with the prince? Still works.\n\nFantasia\n\n\"Hear the pictures. See the music.\"\n\nFantasia was an expensive bomb for Walt Disney. Maybe because the tagline was a little confusing. There is some of his signature genius in it. Remember what we said about opposites within a movie tagline?\n\nMonsters Inc.\n\n\"We scare because we care.\"\n\nMore modern day for Disney/Pixar. This movie tagline is incorporated into the plot, and it's another effective use of contrast within the tagline.\n\nSUPERHERO MOVIE TAGLINES\n\n6. Power up with superheroes\n\nThere are a lot of superhero movies and not a lot of great superhero movie taglines. Probably because most of the movies themselves are pretty ho-hum.\n\nBut here are a select few that are pretty good, and have become part of the cultural lexicon.\n\nSpiderman\n\n\"With great power comes great responsibility.\"\n\nWe're on like our 5th reboot of Spidey since Tobey Maguire first donned the tights in 2002. Nothing from any of them has come close to having the lasting impact this one creative tagline has had.\n\nSuperman\n\n\"You'll believe a man can fly.\"\n\nThis movie tagline is simple and beautiful.\n\nIn 1978, unlike today, audiences weren't exactly flocking to see movies about men in bright colors fighting crime. It was quite the opposite.\n\nHowever, this movie suggested there was a little magic there that was worth the price of admission.\n\nOf course, if you re-watch it now, you will most definitely NOT believe the man is flying. The effects didn't age so well.\n\nThe Dark Knight\n\n\"Why So Serious?\"\n\nThis movie tagline doesn't belong on the list. It tells us almost nothing about the movie, and it's probably not what got anyone in the theater. But it has stayed with us all. The movie is arguably the best of the genre, and the tagline, as a result, is with us forever.\n\nIf you want a deeper dive on The Dark Knight, check out our post that dissects the screenplay structure using the story circle technique.\n\nDramatic Movie Taglines\n\n7. Make them feel something\n\nDrama taglines try, to use the parlance of our times, to give you the feels. All the feels, if possible. If you're trying to come up with a drama tagline think about a desired emotional state, and shoot for that.\n\nSo for this section think about how each movie tagline conjures a specific emotion or two.\n\nErin Brockovich\n\n\"She brought a small town to its feet and a corporation to its knees.\"\n\nInspired? That's the goal of this movie tagline.\n\nPlatoon\n\n\"The first casualty of war is innocence.\"\n\nNow this line is just terribly sad. You feel this emotion before you've even seen the film.\n\nSaving Private Ryan\n\n\"The mission is a man.\"\n\nDetermined. Hopeful. Inspired, again?\n\nDramatic yet inspiring tagline\n\nQuiz Show\n\n\"50 million people watching but no one saw a thing.\"\n\nCurious.\n\nEdward Scissorhands\n\n\"His story will touch you even though he can't.\"\n\nTouched...yet matched with this movie poster, slightly horrifying. A fair assessment of this film's paradox.\n\nThis movie tagline defies genre, just like the movie\n\nCrybaby\n\n\"Good girls want him bad. Bad girls want him worse.\"\n\nJealous? Intrigued?\n\nThe Social Network\n\n\"You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies.\"\n\nSchadenfreude. That's not exactly a simple emotion, but when it comes to all things Mark Zuckerberg, it's what we lead with.\n\nZodiac\n\n\"There is more than one way to lose your life to a serial killer.\"\n\nA combination of fascinated and worried.\n\nLost in Translation\n\n\"Everyone wants to be found.\"\n\nEnnui. Angst.\n\nThis tagline sums up Bill Murrayâ€™s character\n\nSchool Ties\n\n\"Just because you were accepted doesn't mean you belong.\"\n\nAlone.\n\nMemento\n\n\"Some memories are best forgotten.\"\n\nCurious and reflective.\n\nThis poster is almost unnecessary with this tagline\n\nBoogie Nights\n\n\"Everyone has one special thing.\"\n\nDare I say... excited?\n\nOrdinary People\n\n\"Everything is in its proper place except the past.\"\n\nConcerned.\n\nClose Encounters\n\n\"We are not alone.\"\n\nFilled with wonder.\n\nSome taglines pique interest right away\n\nACTION MOVIE TAGLINES\n\n8. Get the adrenaline flowing\n\nThe action movie is no stranger to puns or one-liners. In fact, we should rank those sometime in another post...\n\nAs a result, the action movie taglines tend to be pretty solid. There is a natural fit. Combining a little humor with a little edge... that's an action movie's wheelhouse.\n\nLearn how to write and shoot action here, but for now..\n\nHere are some of the best action movie movie taglines:\n\nI am Legend\n\n\"The last man on Earth is not alone.\"\n\nAgain notice the use of a contradiction here. It poses the question the movie will answer. If he's not alone... who else is there?\n\nThe Matrix\n\n\"Reality is a thing of the past.\"\n\nThe Matrix's tagline is genius in its simplicity. Six words that cover the whole concept, but leave you with questions that need answering.\n\nTrue Lies\n\n\"When he said I do he never said what he did.\"\n\nThe title of this movie is its own tagline.\n\nYou have to imagine there were a ton of solid options turned down before they settled on this one.\n\nContradiction, unanswered questions... check and double check.\n\nTagling in the title\n\nThe Good the Bad and the Ugly\n\n\"For three men the civil war wasn't hell. It was practice.\"\n\nSergio Leone is a master of anticipating violence in cinema. The violence itself isn't the point; it's the waiting. This tagline does in two sentences what his movies do in every scene. Tee you up for something brutal.\n\nT2: Judgement Day\n\n\"Same Make. Same Model. New Mission.\"\n\nThis tagline says enough will be the same that you will like this, but enough will be different that you have to see it. It's a winning formula when it comes to sequels.\n\nDirty Harry\n\n\"You don't assign him to murder cases. You just turn him loose.\"\n\nYou can bet on the action and violence in this story, and it's guilt-free because it'll be about targeting bad guys. Sign us up!\n\nSo Bad They're Terrible\n\n10 worst taglines\n\nWe're getting down to it now. The fun part. The rankings.\n\nThe difference between the best and the worst when it comes to movie taglines is slim. In some ways, this is its own best movie taglines list.\n\nBut in some ways, these movie taglines are just so awful. So beautifully terrible. Here there are in reverse order:\n\nThe Mutilator\n\n10. \"By sword, by pick, by ax, bye bye.\"\n\nThis is almost a good tagline. Maybe it is a good tagline. The mutilator truly toes that thin tagline line.\n\nScary Movie 3\n\n9. \"Great Trilogies Come in 3's.\"\n\nThis is an attempt at the type of humor Naked Gun movies employed in their movie taglines. But it doesn't quite work. It's just flat out bad. There is a fine line. Maybe the movie being awful hurts it too.\n\nBeach Party\n\n8. \"The Perfect Summer when the urge meets the surge.\"\n\nAn attempt at wordplay that just feels kinda gross.\n\nJaws the Revenge\n\n7. \"This time it's personal.\"\n\nThis became a stock bad tagline. It's almost a tagline meme. Plus, does a shark really take things personally?\n\nI take this tagline personally.\n\nThe Lift Movie\n\n6. \"Take the stairs take the stairs for god's sake take the stairs.\"\n\nI think this movie wants us to take the stairs.\n\nGlen or Glenda\n\n5. \"I change my sex!\"\n\nOk! No need to yell!\n\nThe truth is no worst list is complete without Ed Wood making a cameo.\n\nI Was a Teenage Werewolf\n\n4. \"The most amazing motion picture of our time.\"\n\nA common awful tagline tactic is just to claim general awesomeness of the movie in question. Unless the movie is Scary Movie 6 and it's an obvious joke, this sort of tagline is always a bad call.\n\nIce, Ice Baby\n\n3. \"When a girl as a heart of ice there is only one way to melt it... just add ice.\"\n\nThis tagline is too cold, too cold\n\nThis tagline doesn't make any sense. Sort of like Vanilla Ice's career.\n\nCharlie St. Cloud\n\n2. \"Life is for living.\"\n\nAnd water is wet, and the sky is blue and did someone really gets paid to write this?\n\nDay of the Dolphin\n\n1. \"Unwittingly he trained a dolphin to kill the President of the United States.\"\n\nSome of the taglines are worse than the movies and vice versa.\n\nThis is a real movie. It stars George C. Scott and was directed by Mike Nichols. So many questions so few answers.\n\nLeave Em Wanting More\n\nTop 10 best movie taglines\n\nWe finally made it. The definitive ranking of the ten best movie taglines of all time. If you read this far, you have survived countless puns and ten pretty awful movie taglines. You deserve the goods.\n\nThese tags accomplish much of what we have laid out so far as the keys to great movie taglines. But they do something more. They are greater than the sum of their parts. So here we go:\n\nJaws 2\n\n10. \"Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water.\"\n\nThis tagline plays well upon the original, which was also a winner. But it adds a new wrinkle.\n\nApollo 13\n\n9. \"Houston, we have a problem.\"\n\nThe best movie tagline of all time?\n\nThis tagline is just a line from the movie, but it teased what we all knew about the true story. Another one that's with us forever.\n\nRocky\n\n8. \"His whole life was a million to one shot\"\n\nRocky is the ultimate underdog story. The tagline embodies that. The whole franchise embodies that. With every new film, comes another montage dedicated to this tagline.\n\nThe Fly\n\n7. \"Be afraid. Be very afraid.\"\n\nThe tagline scares you into seeing the movie\n\nAnother tagline that transcends being just a tagline. It might even be more famous than the movie.\n\nRobocop\n\n6. \"Part man. Part Machine. All Cop.\"\n\nRobocop is an excellent movie, and the tagline tee's it up pretty well.\n\nThe 40-Year-Old Virgin\n\n5. \"The longer you wait, the harder it gets.\"\n\nThe tagline double entendre at its pinnacle... no pun intended.\n\nPsycho\n\n4. \"Check-in. Relax. Take a shower.\"\n\nWhen you're teeing up one of the most famous scenes in movie history, you can't go wrong.\n\nAlien\n\n3. \"In Space, no-one can hear you scream.\"\n\nThis is arguably number one. It was very closeâ€¦\n\nA terrifying tagline that gives you the creeps\n\nStar Wars\n\n2. \"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...\"\n\nThe tagline that launched a thousand starships. And toys. And spinoffs. And rides... and it's still going.\n\nCocktail\n\n1. \"When he pours, he reigns\"\n\nThey should also be cool, because they are, after all, marketing slogans. Cocktailâ€™s tagline does it all.\n\nStill reigning thirty years later with this tagline.\n\nMovie taglines should be fun. They should be simple.\n\nThey should have just the right amount of cheesy wordplay and tell us enough about the movie.\n\nIn the end, movie taglines are designed to get audiences to want to see your movie. Plant the seed of an idea, a drama, a conflictâ€¦ and it will grow into a story in their imagination. Now hopefully, you already have a fully developed story.
