        "text": "Just days before Jesse James’ pregnant wife Bonnie Rotten filed for divorce from her notorious Casanova husband, the police were dispatched to their home in rural Texas following a 911 call for an explosive “verbal disturbance,” RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.\n\nThe Hays County Sheriff’s Office confirmed deputies raced to the home 20 miles west of Austin on November 28th at 6:43 PM – hours before Bonnie, 29, went on a furious no-holds bar social media rant skewering her West Coast Chopper founder hubby and three days before she officially pulled the plug on their marriage.\n\n“We responded to a residence off [redacted] in Dripping Springs for a verbal disturbance,” Sheriff’s Spokesman Lt. Dennis Gutierrez, admitting he allegedly doesn’t have any details on the screaming match or who called 911.\n\nAs RadarOnline.com previously reported, Bonnie accused Jesse of infidelity last week only months after their June wedding. The two got hitched in a low-key ceremony in Texas on June 25.\n\n\"I’m 10 weeks pregnant I had to leave the house because we got into it the other night. He blocked me on everything,\" she claimed.\n\n\"I see his page. He’s following. His ex and a bunch of girls. I’m his pregnant wife and chooses to act like this. THAT’S NOT A MAN,” the former adult film star added.\n\nHe later went on to profess his love for his estranged wife but then claimed she was very emotional because “she’s pregnant and hormonal.”\n\nOn December 1, Bonnie slapped Jesse with a divorce petition charging the “marriage has become insupportable because of discord or conflict of personalities,” according to court documents exclusively obtained by RadarOnline.com.\n\nThe scorned wife, who filed under her real name, Alaina Antoinnette James, even asked the judge to officially banish the surname “James” from her life and revert her back to Antoinnette Hicks."
