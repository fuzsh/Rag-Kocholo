        "text": "Sandra Bullock is in mourning. The actress' long-time partner, Bryan Randall, died on Saturday, Aug. 5, after a private battle with ALS, at the age of 57.\n\nThe announcement came as a shock to fans of the Oscar-winning actress, as the reserved and deeply private couple hadn't shared the news of his ailment publicly. However, the couple had notably stayed out of the spotlight throughout their relationship.\n\nFrom their first encounter in 2015 at a birthday party for her son, through their unique and beautiful romance over the past eight years -- which included exchanging vows in December 2017 in the Bahamas -- the pair shared a private and heartfelt connection, which ET is looking back on.\n\nJanuary 2015 - First Meeting\n\nBullock and Randall first crossed paths when she hired the model-turned-photographer to photograph her son Louis' 5th birthday party. (Louis is now 13, and Bullock is also mom to Laila, 11.) The pair reportedly hit it off right away and began quietly dating.\n\nAugust 2015 - Wedding Date\n\nThe pair made their first notable appearance together when they attended the secret wedding of Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux in early August. A source told Us Weekly at the time that the pair was \"very affectionate\" together at the small yet star-studded wedding reception.\n\nLater in the month, the pair was spotted beaming bright and enjoying a night out on the town. Bullock and Randall went out for a dinner date at Craig's Restaurant in West Hollywood, and the pair was caught by cameras as they left the restaurant, Bullock smiling big in the back seat of a black SUV.\n\nSeptember 2015 - Playing Coy\n\nBullock played coy when asked about her then-rumored romance at the Toronto International Film Festival. \"Who says I have a new boyfriend?\" the actress teased ET on the red carpet. \"Everything in my life is great right now.\"\n\nMay 2018 - Kids Love Him\n\nThe very reserved Bullock opened up about her romance with Randall in an interview with InStyle, where she she talked about her beau and his bond with her kids. \"Heâ€™s super kind,\" she told the magazine. \"For the kids, he's sort of No. 1. and I'm No. 2. But I get it because he's more fun and has better treats.\"\n\nJune 2018 -- Red Carpet PDA\n\nRandall supported Bullock at the Ocean's 8 premiere in New York City, where the two adorably held hands. Though Randall didn't walk the red carpet at the star-studded premiere, he was photographed arriving to the event with Bullock. Ever the gentleman, he sweetly helped her out of the car, and the actress continued to hold on to him.\n\nDecember 2021 -- Talking Marriage\n\nBullock sat down for an episode of Red Table Talk and dished about why she wasn't in a hurry to marry Randall. She also reflected on how her previous marriage and high-profile divorce from ex-husband Jesse James affected her view of marriage.\n\n\"I am someone who went through the divorce process,\" Bullock explained. \"I found the love of my life. We share two beautiful children, three children -- his older daughter. Best thing ever. So, I don't want to say do it like I do it but I don't need a paper to be a devoted partner, a devoted mother. I don't need to be told to be ever-present in the hardest of times. I don't need to be told to weather a storm with a good man.\"\n\nAugust 2023 -- Tragedy Strikes\n\nIt was announced on Aug. 7 that Randall had died after a very private battle with ALS.\n\n\"It is with great sadness that we share that on Aug. 5, Bryan Randall passed away peacefully after a three-year battle with ALS,\" his family told ET. \"Bryan chose early to keep his journey with ALS private and those of us who cared for him did our best to honor his request.\"\n\n\"We are immensely grateful to the tireless doctors who navigated the landscape of this illness with us and to the astounding nurses who became our roommates, often sacrificing their own families to be with ours,\" his family added.\n\n\"At this time we ask for privacy to grieve and to come to terms with the impossibility of saying goodbye to Bryan,\" the statement concluded, signed, \"His Loving Family.\"\n\nRandall's family said that donations can be made in his honor to ALS Research and Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nAugust 2023 -- An 'Amazing' Caretaker\n\nBullock's sister, Gesine Bullock-Prado, honored Randall following his death. She also praised her sister for looking after her late partner.\n\n\"I'm convinced that Bry has found the best fishing spot in heaven and is already casting his lure into rushing rivers teaming with salmon,\" Bullock-Prado wrote alongside a smiling photo of Randall.\n\n\"ALS is a cruel disease but there is some comfort in knowing he had the best of caretakers in my amazing sister and the band of nurses she assembled who helped her look after him in their home,\" she added. \"Rest in peace, Bryan.\"\n\nAugust 2023 -- They Exchanged Vows in 2017\n\nJust one day after Randall's death, The Daily Mail obtained video in which Bullock and Randall exchanged vows in an intimate, albeit not legally binding, ceremony in the Bahamas, years before he was diagnosed with ALS.\n\nThe ceremony took place on Dec. 31, 2017, on Randall's birthday. In the video, Bullock referred to her longtime partner as \"the love of my life\" during the beachside ceremony. The couple was also seen dancing the night away after professing their love for each other.\n\nThe Bird Box star is dressed in a kaftan with her hair braided. It's clearly a low-key affair, as she's also seen wearing flip flops. Randall can be seen in a causal white shirt with a black hat and sandals.\n\nThe ceremony marked the end of a 14-day trip at a villa owned by the French financier Arpad Busson. A friend told The Daily Mail that they went ahead with the ceremony \"for the children, to kind of seal the deal and show them this was a forever thing.\" The outlet reported that Bullock's two adopted children -- 13-year-old Louis and 11-year-old Laila -- started calling Randall \"dad.\""
