        "text": "Jesse James and Bonnie Rotten got married on June 25, 2022, in a backyard wedding in Texas.\n\nRotten - real name Alaina Hicks - shared a photo from the ceremony to her Instagram, writing, “6.25.22 I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you @popeofwelding.” In a follow-up post, she wrote, “Yesterday was the most magical day, I am so thankful to have those close to us join us for our day of love. All the planets were aligned, figuratively and literally. I found my soul mate, I won’t be letting him go. Mr and Mrs James.” James also posted on Instagram, writing, “1 Corinthians 16:14. ‘Let all that you do be done in love,” and “Greatest day ever yesterday!” The newlyweds posed for pictures with Hicks’ six-year-old daughter from her first marriage to Dennis DeSantis.\n\nJames and the former adult star got engaged in April 2022.\n\nIn 2013, after his tumultuous divorce from esteemed actress Sandra Bullock and a very public and messy split from his fiancé Kat Von D, Jesse James settled down for marriage a fourth time with Alexis DeJoria, a professional drag racer. The pair met through mutual friends in the racing industry and were together for around 7 years before announcing their separation in 2020.\n\nAlexis DeJoria is the daughter of the billionaire business mogul, John Paul DeJoria, the co-founder of the Paul Mitchell hair product line and Patron Spirits Company. Her fame primarily stems from her successful career as a professional drag racer, making her an influential figure in the racing industry.\n\nIn 2005, Jesse James began dating Hollywood superstar, Sandra Bullock, following a tour of his Long Beach, California-based company, West Coast Choppers. The relationship was intense and led to marriage within a year. Unfortunately, the relationship was fraught with scandal and they divorced in 2010 amidst several infidelity allegations against James.\n\nSandra Bullock is an Academy award-winning actress known for her roles in major film hits such as The Blind Side and Gravity. Beloved globally, she is often considered America's sweetheart due to her kind-hearted and humble nature, despite her massive success.\n\nJesse James's next publicly known relationship was with tattoo artist and reality TV star, Kat Von D, following his divorce from Sandra Bullock. The two became engaged in 2011, but after a tumultuous on-again-off-again relationship, they finally ended things later that same year.\n\nKat Von D, born Katherine Von Drachenberg, garnered fame through her show LA Ink, which revolved around her tattoo studio, High Voltage Tattoo, in Hollywood, California. Known for her edgy aesthetic and artistic talent, she has built a massive brand that includes a successful makeup line."
