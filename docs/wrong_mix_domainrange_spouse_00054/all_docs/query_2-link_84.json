The custom motorcycle builder (and infamous ex of Sandra Bullock, who I want to be best friends with) exchanged vows with his new missus on Sunday in Malibu. (Since his breakup with Sandy, Jesse also got engaged, ungaged, re-engaged, and re-ungaged to tattoo artist Kat Von D.) Jesse's youngest daughter, 9-year-old Sunny, and Alexis' 10-year-old daughter, Bella, acted as flower girls as the two exchanged vows. From People: The couple, who got engaged late last year, married at the home of Alexis' father, co-founder of the Paul Mitchell hair care products line and Patron Spirits Company. They exchanged rings designed by jeweler designer Neil Lane. (Who also designed the engagement rings Jesse gave both Sandra and Kat. Maybe third time's a charm?) Read the full story here. Thoughts on Jesse James and Alexis DeJoria's wedding? Whatever. I suspect karma's going to be serving Mr. James a hot, steaming pile of something awful somewhere down the line, so I hope his new bride doesn't wind up stuck in it. Photo: WireImage",
