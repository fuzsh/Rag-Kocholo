Formella announces that Jesse James Sullivan (age 32) has been indicted on multiple charges in connection with the shooting death of his half-brother, Zackary Sullivan (age 19), which occurred in Concord, on January 16, 2024.\n\nThe Merrimack County Grand Jury has returned indictments charging Mr. Sullivan with first-degree murder for purposely causing the death of Zackary Sullivan by shooting him. The Grand Jury also indicted Mr. Sullivan on an alternative count of second-degree murder for recklessly causing the death of Zackary Sullivan, under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life, by shooting him. Further, the Grand Jury returned indictments on charges of falsifying physical evidence, convicted felon in possession of a firearm, and armed career criminal in possession of a firearm as well as one count of reckless conduct for shooting into an occupied home on Airport Road on the same night as the murder.\n\nA hearing will now be scheduled on these charges in the Merrimack County Superior Court."
