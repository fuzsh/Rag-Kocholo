        "text": "English: either a habitational name from Seal (Kent), Seale (Surrey), or Sele in Upper Beeding (Sussex), all of which probably derive from Old English sele âhall, buildingâ (though the Surrey placename may arise from Old English sÄale, dative form of salh âwillowâ), or else a topographic name for someone who lived at a boggy patch (Kentish Middle English and Old English sele) or a hall. Compare Sale 1-2.\n\nEnglish: topographic name for someone who lived by a willow copse or at a place marked by a willow or willows, from Middle English sele âwillowâ (Old English sele), in northern England representing Old Norse selja and in southwestern England representing Old English (West Saxon) sealh. The name was probably interchangeable with the synonymous Middle English sale (Old English salh, Old Norse salr), and in some cases the surname may have functioned as a variant of Sale . In southwestern England initial S- was frequently voiced to Z-, as in the Wiltshire placename Zeals (from the plural form of Old English sealh). However, the medieval form of the placename is overwhelmingly in the plural, and this may also survive as Sales ."
