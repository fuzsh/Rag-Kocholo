        "text": "Whenever I learn about someone super inspiring I often make it a point to try and meet them. I may cold-call them, randomly \"bump into them\"... whatever it takes to become socially engaged. It’s sort of like in elementary school when you slide someone a note asking them to check a box marked “yes” or “no” to be your friend…. only I do it with really interesting people.\n\nThat's how I met SEAL. I was running a 24 hour ultra marathon in San Diego as part of a 6 person relay team. My team was doing it to challenge ourselves and also for some group bonding. You know, friends coming together to have a good time. SEAL was running the same race except he didn’t have a team. He was running the entire 24 hours. Alone.\n\nThe event was unsupported meaning you had to bring your own supplies. My team was loaded. We had food, beverages, first aid equipment, massage therapists and a tent. SEAL’s supplies for the 24 hours: a folding chair, crackers and water. That’s it.\n\nAs the race started I couldn’t help but keep my eye on this guy. Who was he? He ran with a sense of purpose I had never seen before. His drive, determination and grit were on a whole different level. I immediately googled him after the race and was fascinated by his story.\n\nSEAL lost over 100 pounds in roughly 60 days before joining the military. He had never swam so he virtually taught himself how to swim before he left for training camp. He was an African American in a predominately white field. He was an American hero. I had to meet him. After a quick chat on the phone, I decided to fly out to San Diego where he was based. He had something I wanted, but I couldn’t put my finger on it.\n\nLike so many of us, I was looking to get better in the various buckets of my life. At the time, I was in a great routine (get up, workout, work, family, dinner, repeat), but I wasn't getting better. I knew SEAL could help me. So, about 10 minutes into our meeting I invited him to live with me (and my family)... in our house… for 31 days.\n\nOur one month together was like nothing I have ever experienced. I jumped into a frozen lake, slept in a chair, and ran through a blizzard. When SEAL moved in, I could do 22 straight push-ups. By the time he left, I was doing 1,000 a day.\n\nBut getting in shape was only a part of the experience. Sure, I wanted to be in amazing physical condition, but I was more curious with the psychological side. What made this guy tick? I kept a detailed blog of our journey which has now become a book called \"Living With A SEAL\". Here are a few of the many life lessons SEAL taught me:\n\n1. When you think you're done, you're only 40% done.\n\nEveryday SEAL forced me to dig deep into my reserve tank. Every time I wanted to quit he would convince me that this was only my brain talking... I still had way more in me. He would instruct me to “control my mind”. He was right, every time.\n\n2. You have to get comfortable being uncomfortable to get better.\n\nSEAL had a saying: \"If it doesn't suck, we don't do it.\" You have to experience the pain and challenge of going past your limits to improve. He lives his life that way and some of that rubbed off on me.\n\n3. Mix up your routine\n\nResearch shows that getting out of your comfort zone is good for the\n\nbody, mind and spirit. Mix it up. Take a different route to work, listen to a different radio station, break your daily habits. SEAL took the “mix it up” to extremes, but even small changes make a difference.\n\n4. Drive is contagious\n\nI experienced it first hand. Just being around SEAL made me want to push\n\nmy limits. Surround yourself with people that are constantly looking to get better.\n\n5. Live a gritty life.\n\nGrit is a great indicator of future success. Plus, living with grit ismore fun. Every month challenge yourself to something you don't think you can complete.\n\nRoger that!\n\nGot feedback on the book? I want to hear it! Let me know at @the100mileman on social media. \"Living with A SEAL\" is now available on Amazon!"
