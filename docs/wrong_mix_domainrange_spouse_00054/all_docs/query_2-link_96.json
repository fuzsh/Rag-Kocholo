Corona I'm seeking information about Susan James born June 26, 1856 in Lee County, Virginia, daughter of Rev. William James (mother's name unknown). She married John Elliott Conley (b. Jan. 1856, Johnson County, Ky) Jan. 11, 1877 in Johnson County, Ky. Since she is said to have lived to be 102 years old, someone must know something about this lady . . . her siblings, parents, grandparents, etc. A second cousin to Jesse James, according to rumors, she and John had nine children . . . one of whom (Everett b. Sept 1893) was my grandfather. I have information concerning the Conley lineage; hopefully someone can help me with the James' family. My snail mail is: Sandra Corona, 1908 W. Sandalwood Drive, Meridian, Idaho 83642 or e-mail me at: [email protected]. My grandmother had always said her family was related to Jesse JAMES by marriage. Her mother Elizabeth SIMS (b 1848 IN; parents unknown; d before 1900 possibly in Anderson, Madison, IN) could be related to Zerelda COLE JAMES' 2nd husband Benjamin SIMMS or her father, Junius C. SAMUELS (b 1826 Wilkes Cty NC; parents unknown; brother Andrew J. SAMUELS who was living in Frankton, Madison, IN c 1870; d 1911 Indianapolis, Marion, IN) could be related to Zerelda's 3rd husband Rueben SAMUELS. Unfortunately, I have very little about my grandmother Clara's family so far. I read \"Jesse and Frank James: The Family History\" by Phillip Steele but didn't find any connection. I would appreciate any information on Benjamin SIMMS or Rueben SAMUELS' families. Thanks.Mary Jane Leenstra HI, MY NAME IS KRISTEN HARRIS, AND I AM ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE REASEARCHING JESSE JAMES. I HAVE LOOKED EVERYWHERE AND COME UP WITH NOTHING ON HIS GENEAOLOGY. MY GRANDFATHER TOLD ME THAT WE WERE RELATED TO JESSE AND OF COURSE I SEE THE CONNECTION WITH MY GREAT GRANDFATHER BEING CALLED JESSE JAMES HARRIS. I TRIED TO LOOK ON YOUR GENEAOLGY PAGE BUT COULD NOT PULL IT UP. ANOTHER JAMES IN MY FAMILY IS LUCINDA JAMES WHO MARRIED JIM JONES. IF YOU HAVE ANY INFO ON HIM OR ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HELP I WOULD APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. Hello: I became interested in the James family line after my daughter had to put together a family tree for her BRIDGING TO JUNIORS girl scout activity. My fathers name is Ray McKinney Fetters Sr. His mother's name was Eliza Jane Kincaid (spelling). Eliza Janes mother was a James (we believe a cousin to Frank and Jesse). The link as far as I can determine is: A Dalton married a James , A James married a Kincaid ,A Kincaid married a Fetters. Since my father is dead I don't have any way to track any of this information. It would be wonderful if you could help. My daughters name is Crystal. Please help Crystal with her Bridging to Juniors activity.Thank you for all your help Janice (Fetters) Radcliff Irene James - Married Otis Moore Father of Irene was Alfonso James - Alias Frank or other possible close relationship to Frank facts are a little fuzzy. This name change purportedly occurred after Jesse was killed and after Frank supposedly was killed. Don't have a clue if it is authentic or not more than likely \"not\" Doug Fahle Our family has been researching the James / Pound family for 50 Years , most of it by my mothers cousin , Cleburn G. Pound. Most of his information has been written and included in the Crawford County Gegealogical Society, publications called Panning for Nuggets of Old. He has a nice article on the James family, and letters verifying that the Pound's were first cousins to Frank and Jesse. - i.e., \"Our Grandfather, Isaac S. Pound, a Primitive Baptist preacher and a blacksmith at Alma, Crawford County Arkansas, was awakened one night at midnight by two men who needed their horses shod. My Grandfather told them that he did not usually sho horses at that time of night. They told him he would when they told him who the were. They were Frank and Jesse James. He sod their horses.....\" Nancy James is one of our links to your tree.[email protected] I do a lot of family research, and a co-worker LaVerne asked me to help her link her family to the famous James brothers. I haven't been able to help much, but maybe you can. Her 3rd great-grandmother on her mother's side is Celia Frances James, whose parents were from TN. LaVerne thinks Celia was born in northern AL, where she married Charles Williams. LaVerne herself is from Birmingham.Anyway, she was very excited to hear that I found your gedcom file online, and she asked me to give you her address and phone number. I know she would love to hear from you. LaVerne Collier 5 Valley Drive Lawrenceville, GA 30243 770-822-0257 Take care, Laurie Langhans [email protected] My great Grandmother (or great great?) was Harriet James. She was married in Scioto County of Ohio. I was always told that she was a sister of Jesse's father but I don't know if this is true or if there is another connection. Her side of our family is one we have come to a dead end with. In your search have you run accross her. All I know is what I said above and that she married a William H. Ray. The marriage records are only entered in a ledger so I cannot find a place of birth for her.I would appreciate it if you could respond by EMAIL Thank you for your time Diana I was searching for information for my family tree when I came upon the Jesse James geneological document on AOL. I was raised in a town of 300 people in southeastern South Dakota called Hudson. The teacher who taught me German in High School in 1970's, Ita Loe, had a story to tell about a sister of Jesse and Frank James who lived outside of our town and was buried in our small town cemetery. My teacher was old when I was in high school in the 70's and has just recently died. Her father was one of the founding fathers of Hudson, and was also the owner of the newspaper in the late 1800's. She said there were reports back then of the James Bros. and their gang visiting their sister's home located along the Big Sioux River. Supposedly their horses were spotted there on several occasions. I remember someone saying they thought her last name was Black. I have never taken the time through the years to look for her grave. Could this be true or is it just a tall tale created in a small town in South Dakota? Please email me back either way. I have often wondered if this could be true. Theresa Pease I found out a couple things yeserday that may be of interest to you. There is a book in the Denver Library that is named Woodson. In it is my family name, and it shows a direct connection with the Jesse James family. His great grandmother was a Woodson. My greatgrandmother's family originated in Kentucky. They were slave-owners. I believe the last name was Thomas. Her name was Ellen Thomas. She went to Marshall, Missouri to give birth to my grandmother, Ione Gore in 1906. She had married a Mr. Cooper, a dentist at that time. She stayed with a great-aunt. I have a suspicion that this great-aunt had something to do with the Jesse James family. At any rate, I am trying to find out the direct connection with the James family and my family's involvement. If you have any information about this, EMail me at SKing 02 @aol.com Hi there, I am also doing some research to see if my family line connects with Jesse James as this has been a long standing family rumor. The only possible connect is the marriage of Ezekial Mullins to Rebecca James. Rebecca James was born circa 1793 in North Carolina and Died in Robertson County Texas in 1869. If you have any information about Rebecca James and can help I would certainly be greatful. I have everything after these two people but I just can not get beyond them. It is my undestanding that Rebecca may have been a cousin to Jesse. You can write me, Steve Foreman Would like to know if you have any information on any Busby's/Buzbee's, riding with Jesse James? I was told that there was a Busby that rode with them, but haven't found anything yet. This is a family line that I am researching. Would like to hear if you have anything on this... Thank you........Ida Reno Hi. My name is Glenna Milligan. I was browsing and saw your file on the Internet about the James boys. My mother was a James. My grandfather was directly related to the James' but we're not sure where or who. He can remember the James boys coming to their house in the middle of the night and my gt grandmother cooking chicken for them. He said by day break they would have eaten and would be gone.I wondered if you are related or just doing their lineage? Would there be anyway I could get their lineage? I don't understand the GEDCOM files nor how to read them. Glenna Milligan My wife and her family claim to be related to the James family. They say it comes through the Lee's. Her grandmother was a Lee. My wife had an uncle named Jesse Franklin Lee. b. 5/24/1918 d. 1994 He told me several times that he was named after Jesse James. His father was named Jesse Frank Lee. b. 12/4/1981 d. ? Jesse Franks father was named Jesse David Lee and his aunt was suppose to be Jesse and Franks mother. He was born in Mo. Thats about all I have.Thanks for your time.Garland Thomas Hunt\n\nHome, James\n\nAll Rights Reserved"
