        "text": "Jesse James and Kat Von D\n\nAnother month â€“ and another breakup for Jesse James and Kat Von D.\n\n\"I am not in a relationship,\" the tattoo artist said in a post on her Facebook page on Saturday. \"And I apologise for all the 'back and forth' if it's caused any confusion.\"\n\nThe couple, who had been planning a summer wedding, called off their engagement in July. A month later, Von D's reality show L.A. Ink was canceled. Despite the setback, she was on a personal high because the engagement was back on.\n\nSo what went wrong this time? \"It was clear to me that we were just on two different paths in life,\" Von D told PEOPLE.com. \"My friend put it best when he said I could never be more deserving of total, noble love. And as a woman, I think it's important to know your value and never lose sight of that.\"\n\nBeing in a long-distance relationship may have also been a factor for Von D and James, who lives in Austin, Texas. \"I am not in any way moving to Texas,\" Von D posted on Facebook. \"And I am not leaving my shop here in Los Angeles, High Voltage Tattoo.\"\n\nBut Von D clearly has no hard feelings: \"I wish Jesse nothing but the best in life and in love,\" she says.\n\nMore celeb news from people.com\n\nMust-see photos from people.com"
