Jessie and the former NFL pro began dating in 2011 after meeting through mutual friends. “I got a text from my girlfriend who said, ‘I’m having dinner with this guy I’m seeing, and this other guy just showed up, and he's stunning,’” she recalled to Access Hollywood in 2013. “Show him a picture of me, and see if he’s into it.” Eric received her number and texted her first, making Jessie want to approach their romance differently. “From now on, if a man wanted me, he was going to have to show it,” she wrote in her 2018 memoir, Just Jessie. “So I made Eric chase me.” The twosome got engaged in 2012 and married the following year in Colorado. They welcomed three children: Vivianne in 2014, Eric Jr. in 2015 and Forrest in 2018. Jessie announced in August 2023 that she was pregnant with baby No. 4.

Their third son, Denver, arrived in February 2024. Scroll down to see how Jessie and Eric's romance has evolved over the years:\n\nCredit:\n\nOctober 2018\n\nIn her memoir, Just Jessie, she shared various details about their romance, including how she made him chase her for three months. “I wouldn’t call it game playing. I’d call it common sense …. I made Eric hunt for me,” she wrote. “I never texted, called or anything-ed him first. I’m not kidding. For the first three months of our relationship, he never got an incoming call from me.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Jessie James Decker/Instagram\n\nAugust 2019\n\nJessie explained how their pair’s marriage only became stronger when they introduced kids into the picture. “We already liked each other a ton before they came along, so it’s made us like each other that much more because we get to see each other as parents and I think we both are proud of the mother and father we are together,” she said on the “Motherly” podcast.\n\nCredit: Matt Baron/Shutterstock\n\nJanuary 2020\n\nThe singer discussed the possibility of the couple expanding their brood. “He just loves our babies so much. He wants more,” she told Us at the time. “I told him he’s got to just hang on for a minute there. I’m not sure that’s in the cards for us, but you never know. He doesn’t want to permanently do anything about it, so he is leaving things open. I’m not, but he is.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Jessie James Decker/Instagram\n\nMarch 2021\n\n“Happy 10 years to the love of my life @ericdecker 💗 March 31 (which is the actual day we were introduced to each other) little did we know it would be the day our third baby was born,” the designer captioned a throwback photo with her man. “I love you baby here’s to 10 more beautiful years and beyond 🥳😘🥰 (this photo was takin 2011, the year we met. We look like kids 🥰).”\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Jessie James Decker/Instagram\n\nMarch 2022\n\n“The birthday boy In his birthday suit lookin like a statue from Greece😝 My man is 35 and aging like fine wine,” the “Should Have Known Better” songstress wrote via Instagram, sharing a nude photo of her husband. “Happy happy birthday to the love of my life, my best friend, my soulmate, my baby daddy, my ride or die. I’m so happy you were born today. I sure do I love growing old with you 🥰.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Eric Decker/Instagram\n\nJanuary 2023\n\n“I think as of right now, we we're the yin and yang [to each other]. Eric and I are very opposite of each other, but in a good way we're very different,” Jessie exclusively told Us. “It works. We are the yin and yang of each other when it comes to parenting. And I've always said like, ‘We're so blessed that we parent the way that we parent,’ because it really works together. I do think we're such a great parental match.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Eric Decker/Instagram\n\nJanuary 2023\n\n“I just think communication is everything. Just finding that time,” the musician exclusively told Us of how she and Eric balance their relationship and other obligations. “I think with parents it's really hard sometimes because you have these long, busy days and as soon as you get in bed you just like wanna decompress. We really try to make it a point [to say], like, ‘Let's have these moments where we lay in here and we pillow talk each other.”\n\nShe explained: “Being parents is a lot of work and especially having our jobs, but we definitely make sure that there's that time [as a couple]. Even early on in the day we'll be like, ‘Is tonight and night?’ We make sure that we flirt [and] we get each other excited.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Jessie James Decker/Instagram\n\nMarch 2023\n\nJessie revealed via Instagram how she “convinced” her husband to let her adopt a new dog on Valentine’s Day. “You’re the puppy master,” the singer said in an Instagram video while handing Eric the dog during a joint photo shoot.\n\nBy then end of the day, the former NFL star left the shoot with the dog by his side. The squad named her Hart Olivia Decker.\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Jessie James Decker/Instagram\n\nJune 2024\n\n“Married 11 years today to the love of my life. 4 babies and beautiful memories later ❤️ I love you mi amor❤️,” Jessie captioned a throwback Instagram photo from the couple’s wedding day.\n\nEric celebrated the special day with his own social media tribute to his wife, writing, “Happy Anniversary to my forever!! I am so grateful for your love and commitment in this life!!” He called Jessie “the queen, my rock and the light of my soul!” and gushed, “We’ve created some incredible memories and little humans over these 11 years ❤️ currently fantasizing about being on the beach alone with you!! Love you to the moon.”"
