        "text": "“The only way to really get better is to experience pain, to get uncomfortable, go to places that you don’t want to go, and improve.”\n\nJesse Itzler\n\nJesse Itzler fast-talked his way right out of college into a recording contract, ultimately taking his music all the way to MTV, the Billboard 100 and even an Emmy.\n\nJesse Itzler then took an entrepreneurial left-turn, creating and selling big companies — companies like Marquis Jet, the world’s largest prepaid private jet card company, and Zico Coconut Water — before wooing Spanx founder Sarah Blakely (worth over $1 billion) all the way to the altar.\n\nJesse Itzler eats only fruit before noon. And when he’s not raising three kids, he runs 100 mile races, raises millions for charity and can be found court side supporting the Atlanta Hawks — the NBA team he recently purchased with some friends.\n\nWhat I’m trying to say is that Jesse Itzler is a quite the character. An amazing life highlighted by one predominant theme:\n\nnever be afraid to fail.\n\nBut there is one thing that scares Jesse Itzler: stagnation.\n\nDespite all his success, in 2010 Jesse felt his life had settled into a too-comfortable routine. So he did what any rational human would do: he invited a Navy SEAL to move in with him.\n\nBut this was no ordinary SEAL (as if any such thing exists). This was David Goggins — perhaps the most intense, taciturn individual walking planet Earth. A one man metaphor for adversity destruction, Goggins’ example and words formed the original inspiration behind my own journey:\n\nWhen you think you are done, you’ve only accomplished about 40% of what you are truly capable of.\n\nGoggins military record is astonishing. As a Navy SEAL, he was one of an elite group of men regularly sent on some of the toughest missions in the world. He is the only member in the U.S. Armed Forces to complete SEAL training, Army Ranger School (where he graduated as Honor Man), and Air Force tactical air controller training. Not only has he faced combat in Iraq, he served as the body guard for Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari.\n\nTo honor his brother soldiers felled by battle and to raise money for charity, David lost 100 pounds in 60 days and went on to tackle the 10 most rigorous ultra-endurance challenges on the planet, compelling his 260-pound frame to top finishes at races like Badwater— a 135 mile jaunt across Death Valley in 130 degree heat (finishing 5th as a novice) — and Ultraman— 1 320-mile 3 day triathlon circumnavigation of the Big Island of Hawaii he completed with his tennis shoes duct taped to the pedals of an ill-fitting loaner bike to a 2nd place finish overall. He even completed 203.5 miles in the 48-Hour National Championship endurance foot race, earning a spot among the top 20 ultra-marathoners of the world.\n\nJust another training day for Goggins, topped off with a recent Guinness World record for most pull ups in a single day: 4,025.\n\nGoggins accepted Jesse’s invitation with just one rule: for 31-days, Jesse had to do every thing David asked him to do. No exceptions.\n\nWhat happened next would change Jesse’s life forever. An adventure chronicled in his new book, Living With A Seal: 31 Days Training With The Toughest Man On The Planet*. I found the book super fun and highly entertaining. So when my travels took me to Atlanta, I jumped at the chance to meet up with him.\n\nThis is a fun conversation about about Jesse’s dynamic, extraordinary life. His success equation. Why growth is crucial to happiness. Why we must always be willing to get uncomfortable. Why it’s important to never settle, never stagnate, and most of all, why we must never, ever be afraid to fail.\n\nSpecific topics include:\n\nliving outside your comfort zone\n\nthe benefits of consistent discipline\n\nthe Goggins 40% Rule\n\nevaluating self-challenge\n\nthe biggest life lessons living with a Navy SEAL\n\nputting yourself first pie chart\n\nfearlessness and confidence in business\n\nthe importance of giving back\n\nrunning as meditation\n\nAtlanta Hawks ownership and community focus\n\nbalancing work and family\n\nwhy Jesse eats only fruit before noon\n\nthe value of authentic relationships for advancement\n\nthe Goggins accountability mirror\n\nQuestion: Are you living on a plateau? What are you willing to do to continually grow?\n\nI’d love to hear all about it in the comments section below.\n\nI sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.\n\nPeace + Plants,\n\nListen & Subscribe on iTunes | Soundcloud | Stitcher\n\nThe Plantpower Way is available at these fine retailers!\n\nAmazon* | Barnes & Noble | IndieBound | Penguin\n\nAre you a company interested in sponsoring the podcast?
