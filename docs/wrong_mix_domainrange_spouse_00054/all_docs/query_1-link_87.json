Just received this in an email.\n\nSeems as if there is a new custom knife maker in town. Wonder if there will be a booth at any upcoming knife shows? Thoughts?\n\nThe (what appears to be a reverse clip point?) has me baffled but then again, I'm no expert. Perhaps a bend on the karambit or seax? Reminds me of the now aged HK advert that had rounds loaded backwards in a magazine, but then again, I'm no expert...\n\nJesse James, legendary bike builder & firearms producer\n\nhas expanded his reach into the knife industry.\n\nBig\n\nJJKC4DP Big Fixie Survival Bowie\n\n16.5\" (41.91cm) overall. 9.5\" (24.13cm) black Cerakote finish sawback A2 tool steel drop point blade. Lanyard hole. Weight: 1.94lb. A2 Tool Steel hollow handle with air/water tight capsule and O‑ring seal. Black Boltaron MOLLE compatible belt sheath. Boxed.\n\nRetail Price: $2,399.95\n\nBig\n\nJJKC4TT Big Fixie Survival Knife\n\n16.5\" (41.91cm) overall. 9.5\" (24.13cm) black Cerakote finish sawback A2 tool steel bowie blade. Lanyard hole. A2 Tool Steel hollow handle with air/water tight capsule and O‑ring seal. Black Boltaron MOLLE compatible belt sheath. Boxed.\n\nRetail Price: $2,399.95\n\nThe Jesse James Big Fixie knives are machined from a single billet of A2 Tool Steel that is 17'' long, 3'' diameter and weighs 32lbs.\n\nPretty work of art. Not a knife I would use, and I have many, many knives and use them regularly.\n\nAlso, Jesse James is a piece of who cheats on his wife and publicly berates his employees. I would no more support JJ than I would Hitler.\n\nPretty work of art.
