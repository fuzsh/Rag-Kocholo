        "text": "Limited number of studies relate laboratory studies to chip seal performance over several years. This paper investigate the relationship between chip seal sweep test results and field performance. The study compares between the performance of hot applied chip seals and emulsified asphalts chip seals using sweep test. Performance evaluation is based upon aggregate retention, texture depth and embedment properties. In addition, parameters such as: aggregate type, aggregate coating, seal type, and their combined interaction effect on chip seal aggregate retention properties are presented in the study.\n\nSweep test analysis of variance (ANOVA) findings revealed that aggregate coating has resulted in a significant enhancement in aggregate retention properties. Coated crushed stone aggregates have also provided the highest embedment percentiles, regardless of the seal type being used. However, they acquired less mean texture depth when compared to uncoated stones specimens.\n\nThe laboratory analysis further found out that hot applied modified asphalt PG (72-28) with pre-coated crushed stones combination have yielded the most enhanced aggregate retention properties when compared to the rest of examined combinations of aggregates and seal types. The highest embedment properties were observed in specimens with pre-coated aggregates and emulsified asphalt (CRS-2).\n\nFinally, the study found that laboratory performance trends were in alignment with field performance trends of six chip seal projects constructed with comparable asphalt materials and same source aggregates."
