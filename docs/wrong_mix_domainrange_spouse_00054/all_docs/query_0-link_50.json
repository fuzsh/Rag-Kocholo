Peter was living in Marion County Arkansas in 1850 with his age as 37, wife Sally 35; Elias 13;Jacob 11; Malinda 10; James 8; Mary 6; Abraham 4; Eady 3; Stephen 2;and Louis 1.\n\nStephen Friend married Screna Casebolt.\n\nJacob Friend, is mentioned many times in \"Fireside Tales\" as Jake Friend.

I have no knowledge of children from this marriage.\n\nElias was born in Ozark County in 1838. He served in the Civil War, reaching the rank of sergeant.

He was born 1861 and was her only son, his mother never coming to America. She died in Germany in 1907, leaving to her son her estate, which was a large sum of money. He put it in a bank in New York and lost it all. Jemima and Arthur lived the first part of their married life on a farm near old Theodosia. The lake has now covered their farm. Their children were: Jessie James, born 1888; Sophia Elizabeth, born 1890; Bertha, born 1892; Maggie, born 1896; Charlie, born 1895 and Joseph and James (twins), born 1902.

There they had a store, post office and livery barn. Joseph and James were born here. There the family became members of the Catholic Church and remained so.\n\nArthur became dissatisfied and wanted to move to Texas. Jemima thought a salary of $10.00 a day was good money and wanted to remain in Florida, but Arthur had his way and they soon were on the move. Jemima was afraid they might be robbed or taken from the children by Indians or other outlaws. She made each child a bag for money and sewed it to the child's clothes. They reached Randoal, Texas, homesteaded two sections of land, this being 1200 acres. They soon began to think this land was only covered with sket brush and was wortheless. Later it became a producing oil field.\n\nFrom Texas they went to Oklahoma. There they lived with Jemima's sister and her husband, John and Polly Dobbs.\n\nThey later became dissatisfied in Oklahoma and thought they would return to Texas, but they changed their minds, came back to old Theodosia, Mo., stayed with Tom and Mary Mahan (Mary was a cousin of Jemima) until they bought a general store at New Dit, Mo. in Taney County near Big Creek from Jack Wance. They had the store and post office there until 1912 when they sold to Bill Hodges and bought a farm from Bill Blank dnship. The farm was in the south eastern part of Taney County near Big Creek.
