        "text": "Constitution of 1865:\n\n__________\n\nCONSTITUTION OR FORM OF GOVERNMENT\n\nfor the\n\nPEOPLE OF FLORIDA\n\n__________\n\nWe, the People of the State of Florida, by our delegates in Convention assembled, in the city of Tallahassee, on the 25th day of October, in the year of our Lord 1865, and of the Independence of the United States the 90th year, in order to secure to ourselves and our posterity the enjoyment of all the rights of life, liberty and property, and the pursuit of happiness, do mutually agree, each with the other, to form the following Constitution and form of Government in and for the said State.\n\n__________\n\nARTICLE I.\n\nDeclaration of Rights.\n\nThat the great and essential principles of liberty and free government may be recognized and established, we declare:\n\nSection 1. That all freemen when they form a government, have certain inherent and indefeasible rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty; of acquiring, possessing and protecting property and reputation, and of pursuing their own happiness.\n\nSection 2. That all political power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority, and established for their benefit; and therefore they have at all times an inalienable and indefeasible right to alter or abolish their form of government in such manner as they may deem expedient.\n\nSection 3. That all men have a natural and inalienable right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own conscience, and that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship in this State.\n\nSection 4. That no property qualification for eligibility to office, or for the right of suffrage, shall ever be required in this State.\n\nSection 5. That every citizen may freely speak, write and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty; and no law shall be passed to curtail, abridge or restrain the liberty of speech or of the press.\n\nSection 6. That the right of trial by jury shall forever remain inviolate.\n\nSection 7. That the people shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers and possessions, from unreasonable seizures and searches; and that no warrant to search any place, or to seize any person or thing, shall issue without describing the place to be searched, and the person or thing to be seized, as nearly as may be, nor without probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation.\n\nSection 8. That no freeman shall be taken, imprisoned, or disseized of his freehold, liberties or privileges, or outlawed or exiled, or in any manner destroyed or deprived of his life, liberty or property, but by the law of the land.\n\nSection 9. That courts shall be open, and every person, for an injury done him in his lands, goods, person or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law; and right and justice administered without sale, denial or delay.\n\nSection 10. That in all criminal prosecutions, the accused hath a right to be heard by himself or counsel, or both; to demand the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor; and in all prosecutions by indictment or presentment, a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the county or district where the offense was committed; and shall not be compelled to give evidence against himself.\n\nSection 11. That all persons shall be bailable by sufficient securities, unless in capital offenses, where the proof is evident, or the presumption is strong; and the habeas corpus act shall not be suspended unless, when in case of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it.\n\nSection 12. That excessive bail shall in no case be required; nor shall excessive fines be imposed; nor shall cruel or unusual punishments be inflicted.\n\nSection 13. That no person shall, for the same offense, be twice put in jeopardy of life and limb.\n\nSection 14. That private property shall not be taken or applied to public use, unless just compensation be first made therefor.\n\nSection 15. That in all prosecutions and indictments for libel, the truth may be given in evidence; and if it shall appear to the jury that the libel is true, and published with good motives, and for justifiable ends, the truth shall be a justification; and the jury shall be the judges of the law and facts.\n\nSection 16. That no person shall be put to answer any criminal charge, but by presentment, indictment or impeachment, except in such cases as the Legislature shall otherwise provide: but the Legislature shall pass no law whereby any person shall be required to answer any criminal charge involving the life of the accused, except upon indictment or presentment by a Grand Jury.\n\nSection 17. That no conviction shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture of estate.\n\nSection 18. That retrospective laws punishing acts committed before the existence of such laws, and by them only declared penal or criminal, are oppressive, unjust and incompatible with liberty; wherefore no ex post facto law shall ever be made.\n\nSection 19. That no law impairing the obligation of contracts shall be passed.\n\nSection 20. That the people shall have a right, in a peaceable manner, to assemble together to consult for the common good; and to apply to those invested with the powers of government for redress of grievances, or other proper purposes, by petition, address or remonstrance.\n\nSection 21. That no soldier in time of peace shall be quartered in any house without the consent of the owner; nor in time of war but in a manner prescribed by law.\n\nSection 22. That no standing army shall be kept up without the consent of the Legislature; and the military shall be in strict subordination to the civil power.\n\nSection 23. That perpetuities and monopolies are contrary to the genius of a free people, and ought not to be allowed.\n\nSection 24. That no hereditary emoluments, privileges, or honors, shall be granted or conferred in this State.\n\nSection 25. That a frequent recurrence to fundamental principles is absolutely necessary to preserve the blessings of liberty.\n\nSection 26.
