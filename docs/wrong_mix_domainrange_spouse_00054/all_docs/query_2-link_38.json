        "text": "Well, that was fast.\n\nJesse James’ pregnant wife, Bonnie Rotten, has called off their divorce after just one day.\n\nIn a lengthy statement posted to her Instagram Monday, the former porn star confirmed she filed the paperwork after claiming the mechanic cheated on her, only to turn around and regret it.\n\n“I love Jesse so much and was very hurt by what I saw when I went through his phone,” Rotten, 29, began, adding that she ultimately went “back home” to James, 53, because she had not discovered any text messages mentioning sex.\n\n“That’s why I am here working out the marriage that I believe in,” she continued. “There are things in the world with much more importance than our lives.”\n\nRotten, whose real name is Alaina Hicks, said her accusations were “blown out of proportion to a degree that it didn’t need to go.”\n\n“I would like to have peace in this time as I work on my relationship with my husband. There’s nothing more to it,” she wrote, turning her statement into one about how the media reported “trash gossip” that she had posted herself.\n\n“Thankfully everything is back to status quo over here,” the model concluded. “I would appreciate an end to all of this.”\n\nIn the caption, she asked for peace so she could “focus on having a healthy pregnancy.”\n\nRotten publicly blasted the West Coast Choppers founder last week after believing he had cheated on her. In response, James took to his own account to deny stepping out and apologize for their argument.\n\n“I’m sorry we got into a fight. I’m sorry I called you a ‘retard’ when we were fighting,” he wrote. “I know that just made you more mad, and didn’t do anything to make the situation better. It was out of line and childish and immature. I’m sorry I did that.”\n\nJames, whose marriage to Sandra Bullock infamously ended in 2010 over infidelity on his part, then insisted to Rotten, “Please know. I’ve never thought about cheating on you. I’ve never tried to cheat on you. I’ve never had the urge to cheat on you. You are the only one I want, forever.”"
