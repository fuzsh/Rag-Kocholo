        "text": "Emotions like fear and anger lead to shortsightedness and poor decision-making. How can you gain ultimate mastery of your emotional state?\n\nAndy Stumpf is a former Navy SEAL who executed hundreds of combat operations all over the world. He is now a sought after public speaker and the host of the Cleared Hot podcast. Andy is an avid base jumper who holds the world record for having flown more than 18 miles in a wing suit. He is also a dad.\n\nListen to his amazing story—from the Navy SEALs, to base jumper, to father—and how he keeps his cool through it all!\n\n[bctt tweet=”‘Don’t watch people doing amazing things. Go out there and do them yourself.’ – @AndyStumpf77 #motivation #inspiration #men #dads #fathers ” username=”gooddadprojct”]\n\nAbout Andy Stumpf\n\nAndy Stumpf considers his background to be incredibly average. He grew up in a beach town in a solid middle-class family. His mom worked in the administrative field and his father owned a masonry company. Andy began to learn the value of hard work when he started working for his dad at the age of eleven. It was also during that time that he dreamed of becoming a Navy SEAL. He read books and watched movies about the SEALs and was drawn in by the combination of intrigue and challenge.\n\nAs Andy grew older, he developed his comfort level in the water as a junior life guard and a water polo player. The SEAL dream never faded and he didn’t have a plan B. He brought home a waiver to his parents to leave school early and enlist in the military. He trained like a madman and passed the BUD/s training. He was pipelined straight through the SEAL program and served just one month shy of 17 years. Andy medically retired on the last day of June 2013.\n\n[bctt tweet=”‘If there is one thing I’d change about our society, specifically for the men, I would advocate strongly for them getting out and struggling on their terms every day. Have a visceral physical experience.’ – @AndyStumpf77 #men #dads #fathers” username=”gooddadprojct”]\n\nWhat You’ll Learn\n\nWhat inspired him to fly more than 18 miles in a wingsuit\n\nAbout his 7,000 sky dives\n\nWhy base jumping is so much more dangerous than skydiving\n\nHow base jumping calms him down and makes him a happier person for months\n\nAndy’s advice for guys who do have an outlet like base-jumping in their lives\n\nThe difference in the way he fathers his sons and daughters\n\nHow his background experience with his own father and the Navy SEALs influenced him as a father\n\nHow he uses the morning drive to school as contained ‘dad time’\n\nThe motivational words he says to his kids every morning\n\nHow we must execute leadership\n\nHow to think through your problems\n\nWhy we shouldn’t detach from our emotions\n\nHow to find a healthy way to express your emotions\n\nWhy we should never make decisions in a heightened emotional state\n\nWhat’s next for Andy Stumpf\n\n[bctt tweet=”‘The things that come out of your mouth are important, but if you don’t back them up with action, they’re meaningless.’ – @AndyStumpf77 #dads #men #fathers #leadership #fatherhood #manhood” username=”gooddadprojct”]\n\nMENTIONED EPISODES:\n\nDad Edge Alliance Q&A: The Modern Revolution of the Masculine Heart with John Eldredge\n\nWild at Heart with John Eldredge\n\nYNAB.
