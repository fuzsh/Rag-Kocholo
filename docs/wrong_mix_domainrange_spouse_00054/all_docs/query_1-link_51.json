        "text": "“Jesse is busy trying to f–k other women while I’m pregnant,” wrote Rotten, who married James in June.\n\n“I’m so hurt by everything he has done to me,” she wrote in a second post. “He didn’t give a f--- about anyone but himself he’s truly a disgusting human being.”\n\n“Baby I didn’t cheat on you I swear!!” he wrote on Instagram on Friday. “I’m sorry we got into a fight. I’m sorry I called you a ‘retard’ when we were fighting.”\n\n“I know that just made you more mad, and didn’t do anything to make the situation better. It was out of line and childish and immature. I’m sorry I did that,” James continued alongside a series of photos of the couple together.\n\n“Please know. I’ve never thought about cheating on you. I’ve never tried to cheat on you. I’ve never had the urge to cheat on you. You are the only one I want, forever,” he wrote further. “Every chick that was hanging around back then got told I was in love with you and I couldn’t see them anymore. This was me making efforts to secure your trust and do things the right way. (What a ‘Man’ does).”\n\n“I really thought we were done, and I was so mad and acted out of anger and spite,” the eponymous Jesse James: Outlaw Garage host concluded his post. “I know this hurt you and I’m sorry. I unfollowed her and won’t contact again.”"
