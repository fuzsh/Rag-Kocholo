        "text": "Jesse James and the Lost Templar Treasure:\n\nSecret Diaries, Coded Maps, and the Knights of the Golden Circle\n\nDaniel J. Duke | July 9, 2019 | Destiny Books | ISBN: 9781620558201 | 150 pages | $16.99\n\n​Generally speaking, if a book opens by thanking God for his help and assistance, it’s not a very good book. Somehow, God’s literary output has declined markedly in quality since his first few bestsellers. Really, after the Qur’an, it was all downhill, even when he is just consulting, as he did with this book. Our inspired volume under consideration today, Jesse James and the Lost Templar Treasure, begins with the unpromising revelation that the author and his mother and sister were disheartened when the James Farm and Museum refused to endorse their family legend that their alleged ancestor, the outlaw Jesse James, faked his death and lived out his life in Blevins, Texas as James Lafayette Courtney—the man who is Daniel J. Duke’s actual ancestor. Our author describes becoming progressively more strident in his beliefs because of the “many rude encounters” he had with experts who declined to embrace his family’s oral tradition that Courtney was James, traditions detailed in his mother Betty Dorsett Duke’s book, Jesse James Lived and Died in Texas, which Duke expects readers to presume to be both true and correct, mostly because the scholarly elites say no.\n\n​Duke claims that the 1995 DNA testing of the body buried in Jesse James’s grave proved that the body did not belong the James, but standard accounts from the time state that mitochondrial DNA tested were consistent with a known member of the James family.\n\nDuke offers no evidence that his great-grandfather was Jesse James other than the opinion of some police detectives that the two men’s photographs look similar, as do photos of their respective mothers. It’s not terribly convincing.\n\nFrom there, the narrative branches off briefly to follow Courtney’s life, which Duke imagines to have been guided by James’s experiences. Courtney was a Freemason, and after his death, it was discovered that he had squirreled bundles of cash and precious metals around his farmstead. Duke speculates that Courtney / James was a member of the pro-Confederate Knights of the Golden Circle, though he admits to having no evidence to support the claim. Nevertheless, he believes that using “treasure templates” created by the Knights, he can locate more of Courtney’s buried treasure. By coincidence, no one can quite figure out how these templates work or how many of them are needed to find treasure.\n\nMany of the chapters in the book are … pointless, really. Even though I knew from the book description that it would touch on esoteric and occult material, I wasn’t expecting the book to be an amateurish analysis of Kabbalah that quickly forgot all about Jesse James after only a few pages, so that was… unexpected. That it turned out to be esoteric Confederate revaunchism that reimagined the Scott Wolter Templar Mythos as secret Southern science was also something I did not wholly anticipate.\n\nDuke structures the first third of the book around his quest for what he believes to be Courtney’s remaining treasure, which he also thinks is a fortune that James had gathered, perhaps under the auspices of the Knights of the Golden Circle, and buried somewhere in the United States. To this end, he investigates—by which, I mean, copies from reference books and encyclopedias—a series of local treasure stories related to such myths as the Seven Cities of Gold, sometimes localized in the desert southwest, and Bruton Parish Church in Virginia, which Manly P. Hall’s wife Maria Bauer speculated was a front for Rosicrucian secrets.\n\nIncidentally, the Bruton Parish Church “treasure” is said to be the same treasure as on Oak Island—Shakespeare’s lost plays, secret codes, ancient wisdom, etc., placed there by the same person, Francis Bacon. The two stories also share hidden vaults and secret tunnels, as well as Masonic symbolism. (Duke ties Oak Island into his conspiracy, though in a different way.) The localization of the same myth in two locations is interesting on its own, particularly in the way Oak Island absorbed Bauer’s and Hall’s speculations about Bruton Parish Church wholesale. I hadn’t heard of this particular version of the story before, and it puts the Oak Island myth in a new light.\n\nMost of the stories in the book, however, were familiar to me only from appearing on History Channel pseudo-history shows like America Unearthed and treasure hunting programs, and few seem to have more than local currency in the towns and counties where they are centered. “As I stated before,” Duke writes, “very few treasure stories seem to be useful for anything other than entertaining campfire tales.” He might have taken his own advice, since nothing in his discussion was of more than passing interest.\n\n​Having outlined several stories of buried treasure, Duke moves onto his real topic: a fantasy that America is a giant embodiment of Kabbalistic diagrams organized by Freemasons and Rosicrucians even before the founding of the country. He assumes that the “templates” used by the Knights of the Golden Circle (allegedly, anyway) are connected to Freemasonry, which he sees as the only force powerful enough to have drawn a treasure map across the continent and buried caches of gold and historically important documents at locations important to sacred geometry. This involves an effort to view Freemasonry as an extension of Kabbalah and therefore to use the cabalistic Tree of Life as a map to overlay onto the southern United States as a guide to treasure locations. He found it amazing that a template laid over part of America worked for other areas and at different scales, suggesting that America is laid out as a fractal grid. Instead, he discovered a not-so-secret secret: Cities and towns tend to be laid out at fairly regular distances from each other because there are limits to how far people can travel in a day.\n\nKabbalah's Tree of Life (Wikipedia)"
