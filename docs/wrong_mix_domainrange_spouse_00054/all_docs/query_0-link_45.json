The second picture shows Denver laying in mom’s lap.\n\nDenver joins the couple’s two older sons, Eric Thomas, 8, and Forrest Bradley, 5. and daughter Vivianne Rose, 9. Jessie tied the knot with retired NFL player Eric in 2013, and announced she was expecting baby No. 4 in August 2023, showing off her baby bump as she was taking in the view from a balcony in California.\n\nEditorial credit: Kathy Hutchins / Shutterstock.com"
