        "text": "There's a whole lot of crazy that comes from living with Gunny Man. As if we didn't already have enough of that around here. Gunny Man is . . . ahem, special.\n\nHe has lots of quirks.\n\nWhen we first brought him home, we put him to bed at night in his crate, in our room next to our bed. We put him in the crate to ensure there were no potty accidents, and that we didn't wake up on the floor because he had eaten our bed. He loves him some wood, that's for sure.\n\nWell, we took his crate away a couple months ago and gave him a little rug. He liked that just fine until recently. He has taken to army crawling his way under our bed to sleep. There isn't a lot of space under there, hence the army crawl. He thinks it's quite cozy, and I'll let him stay as long as he promises not to eat the extra leaf to our kitchen table that's under there. It's wood, so you'll understand if I'm a little nervous.\n\nSince Gunny likes to chew so much, we buy him dog toys constantly. Every time we go to the store, we come home with a new toy for him. He's so spoiled.\n\nI think it has helped some with his chewing, although Peanut Head would probably disagree with me. Gunny has completely ripped out Peanut Head's drip system, yanked out all the weed cloth in the planting beds, eaten the sandbox cover, eaten the wood rails off the wagon, and ripped out and eaten all of the dog deterrent fencing that Peanut Head installed around his raised gardening beds. I'm sure he's so glad he bothered with that fencing.\n\nAnyway, my point was going to be that Gunny's chewing also extends to his toys. I brought home this CEE-UTE little Hedge Hog the other day, and within 20 minutes Gunny had ripped off his face.\n\nI'm thinking it takes some talent to extricate the face so perfectly.\n\nPeanut Head gave Gunny Man a stern lecture about taking proper care of his toys.\n\nAnd Gunny listened intently for about 20 seconds. Then he jumped onto Peanut Head's lap and gave him a kiss with lots of tongue. I would have taken a picture of that, except he launched off me and knocked me over.\n\nI was still getting up.\n\nWe discovered recently that Gunny is quite alarmed by the sprinkler. He barks at it incessantly, chases the spray, and bites the sprinkler head over and over and over again. Our neighbors love us.\n\nWho needs a Neti Pot when you can give yourself a nasal enema in the comfort of your very own backyard?\n\nIt takes care of ear wax build up too.\n\nAnd toothbrushing.\n\nI found some similar pictures of Stinkerbell as a baby. She was pretty curious about the sprinkler for awhile too.\n\nThankfully she never barked at it.\n\nShe did learn about cause and effect though--something I'm not sure Gunny will ever get.\n\nHave you ever seen this thing? It's the Tooth n' Brush Hands Free Toothpaste Dispenser. The first time I saw it, I was standing in the check out line at Wal Mart and I said to myself, Oh Get Out! Who needs a contraption to put toothpaste on their toothbrush for them? LAME-O.\n\nThen I grabbed it and stuck it on the belt deep underneath the rest of my purchases. Yep. On account of I was embarrassed for myself. Of myself. Ashamed.\n\nThe entire time I was waiting to be rung up, and I'm not kidding you, I was mentally flogging myself for my stupidity. You are NOT going to buy that thing. It's $20 and WHY?!!!! Look at you. Up here in this line, people starving all over the world, and you're going to throw down $20 for an As-Seen-On-T.V. hoojit. You should be ashamed of yourself.\n\nThen a little Virtual WWF match started in my brain. My conscience against the Devil.\n\nPut it back.\n\nNo.\n\nPut it back.\n\nNo.\n\nPut. It. BACK.\n\nN. O.\n\nAnd guess what? The Devil won.\n\nBut here's the rest of the story. The why that allows me to rationalize my purchase.\n\nMy kids pushed me over the edge. Yes, I did not have far to go, but I up and went. You see, it's their toothpaste. The toothpaste that they cannot, for the love of Peter Pan, keep in the bathroom, where it belongs. Why must it always leave the bathroom? Why? Why? Why?!!!\n\nThe toothpaste leaves the bathroom, and then the next kid cannot brush their teeth because they cannot find the toothpaste. They walk all over the house looking for it, staring up at the ceiling kind of looking. Unproductive looking and, surprise, no toothpaste finding is happening.\n\nThen when the angry parent finds the toothpaste because the parent knows how to scan a room actively, as in aware and involved looking, the kid cannot seem to extract any toothpaste from the tube. It gets past the half gone point, and then suddenly they can't seem to squeeze their delicate flower hands hard enough to get the ding dang toothpaste on the toothbrush.\n\nReally! This is not rocket science here, kidlets. It's dental hygiene. Get some.\n\nAnd I'm not even going to go into the mess that follows the toothpaste extraction, I'm just going to tell you that this purchase from the Devil actually turned out to be quite Heaven sent. No lie.\n\nWe have not lost the toothpaste once since this device was so tackily installed in our bathroom . . . um, suction cupped right to the mirror. I'm pretty sure you won't see that in Martha Stewart Living. The toothpaste is always right there. On the mirror. No child needs to waste their precious energy on unproductive looking anymore.\n\nNot only that, but there is no toothpaste on the counters, smeared on the cupboards, the toilet, the walls, etc. It's still in the sink though, can't seem to fix that one.\n\nAnd the best part of it? We get every last molecule of toothpaste out of every tube of toothpaste. Peanut Head explained it to me. Something about gravity and the tight seal creating a natural vacuum, blah, blah, blah. Who cares, Peanut Head?!\n\nIt's magic. That's all I need to know.\n\nAnd no, I am not being paid to blow sunshine about the toothpaste dispenser. They don't even know I exist.\n\nNow it's confession time, are you going to run out and get yourself one of these white trash hoojits for your kids? Spill.\n\nPeanut Head makes this A-MAZING Cheese Bread that I looooooove. Sometimes I beg him to make it for me. The Barefoot Contessa taught him how to make it, and I remember the first time I had it at her house. It was the day I knew I was going to make her my Mother-in-Law, it's that good.\n\nThen she told me the secret ingredient was mayonnaise, and I had to rethink that whole marrying her son to get to her table thing. In the end, I decided to just pretend the mayonnaise wasn't there so I could enjoy myself properly. You really can't even taste it. Trust me. I'd be gagging on it if I could taste it. I loathe mayonnaise.\n\nThe recipe is super simple, and you can make it with any kind of cheese you want. Often we just make it out of whatever we can scrounge out of the fridge. Like if we had tacos the night before and we still have shredded cheese, we'll use that and just supplement with whatever else we can find. Then we'll dig around in the freezer for french bread that's been buried. Of course it's better if the bread is fresh. It just depends on how desperate you are.\n\nIf you're suspicious, halve the recipe and just give it a try. I promise, you'll love it. Unless you don't like bread, then I'm going to have to tell you the same thing I tell people that don't like chocolate . . . you're a freak.\n\nCome one. Give it a try, won't you?"
