        "text": "Jesse BROCK\n\n1. Jesse BROCK was born on 8 Dec 1751 in Cumberland Co., VA1 and died on 13 Oct 1843 in Harlan Co., KY2 at age 91.\n\nRemarks: Some people list Jesse Brock's name as Jesse James Brock. To date, Brock Ancestry has found no evidence to support this claim. From all indications the false claim that Jesse was married to Elizabeth Osborn, wife of James Brock, son of Jesse, caused the error.\n\nNotes:\n\n\"Jesse Brock was the first settler of Wallins Creek Kentucky. He was about a three-quarter Indian, and had so much Indian blood in him, that he had no trouble in living among the Indians who were thickly settled in the mountains when he first came, raised his family among them, hunted along with them, with no trouble whatever.\" Excerpt from the interview of Elijah Brock with Annie Walker Burns\n\nJesse Brock RW Pension alication regarding places he had lived: \"When I was called into service the last time; And the same spring after the close of the war I moved Back to Guilford County in the state of North Caroline(Spring of 1781), Where I lived a few years But I can not remember the precise time. I then moved to Franklin county in the state of Virginia where I lived several years; I then moved Back to Guilford County State of North Caroline Where I lived several years, But I cant say how many I then moved to Russell County in the state of Virginia Where I lived four years, I then moved to Knox County State of Kentucky which was after wards stricken off to Harlan County Kentucky Where I now live, I have been here thirty four or five years\"\n\nFrom Jesse's statement Jesse lived in Guilford Co. NC until 1783. He then moved to Franklin Co. VA(Henry Co. VA until 1785) for several years then moved back to Guilford Co. NC for several years. He then moved to Russell Co. VA where he lived before migrating to Knox Co. KY, now Harlan Co. KY. From Jesse's statement and with evidence confirming Jesse was living in Russell Co. VA as early as 1795, we can determine his time between Guilford Co. NC and Franklin Co. VA between 1783-1794.\n\nIn searching the personal property tax list and land tax list for Henry and Franklin counties for the years 1782-1795 there are at least two Jesse Brock's living in the area of these counties beginning in 1787. At least one Jesse Brock is listed continuously through 1802. During the years of 1789 and 1790 two Jesse Brock's appear on the Henry Count tax list. In 1790 these two Jesse's are designated as Jesse and Jesse Jr., which does not necessarily mean they were related, instead distinquish the younger Jesse with the reference Junior. The years 1789 and 1790 does fit into the time frame Jesse could have been in Henry County, however there is no way we can confirm without a doubt that it is him. The other Jesse appears to be the same Jesse who was listed in the Pittsylvania Co. Va militia unit under the command of Capt. Jonathan Hanby. This unit was placed in Henry Co. VA after it's formation. This would place the 2nd Jesse of similar to age to the Jesse Brock of Harlan County. It seems likely this 2nd Jesse was connected to the Brock's in Pittsylvania, Henry and Franklin counties that descend from George Brock Senior born 1680 and found in early New Kent Co. VA. Descendants of George Brock Senior have proved a relationship with Jesse Brock of Harlan Co. KY descendants.\n\nTax list of Henry, Franklin & Russell Counties in Virginia listing two, possibly three, different Jesse Brock's:\n\n1787 Henry Co.

Matrimony Creek Baptist Church was located in Guilford Co., NC until the formation of Rockingham Co., NC in 1785. No wife was listed with Jesse and the only other Brock listed was an Esther Brock. Additional information states that Jesse was excommunicated from the church in 1781.\n\nHe had a residence in 1780 in Henry Co., VA. Barthena Brock, daughter of Jesse Brock, listed as being born in Henry Co., VA in the 1870 Lee Co., Va census, Jonesville Twp., P O Jonesville. HH# 394-400, enumerated July 20th\n\nRevolutionary War: Enlistment, Prior to 1781, Guilford Co., NC. 4 Jesse Brock enlisted for a period of three months. After he served his term he reenlisted for 2nd three month term. Jesse reenlisted for his 3rd and final term in Feb 1781 at Surry Co., NC, where he lived at the time. 5 On 15 Mar 1781, Jesse was in a skirmish near the Alamance Creek 5 known as the Battle of New Garden Meeting House (Battle of Guilford) where his Ensign Richard Taliaferro was killed.111 (Jesse Brock's Revolutionary War Pension Application)\n\nIn the spring of 1781, after his service in the war was over Jesse lived in Guilford Co., NC. Where he lived for a period of a few years. 5\n\nOn 9 August 1782 in Salisbury District, Rowan Co., NC he recieved a pay voucher for one pound 10 shillings for his Revolutionary War service. 110\n\nHe had a residence in 1783 in Franklin Co., VA. 5 Jesse Brock moved to Franklin Co. and resided there for two years per his pension application (Franklin wasn't formed Henry County until 1785)\n\nHe had a residence in 1785 in Guilford Co., NC. 5 Jesse Brock settled once again in Guilford Co., NC after leaving Franklin Co., NC\n\nChurch Membership: 19 Feb 1785, Guilford Co., NC. 6 Matrimony Primitive Baptist Church, The church excommunicated Jesse Brock for swearing profanely.\n\nPersonal Property Tax Lis: 1795, Russell Co., VA. 9 Jesse Brock - 3\n\nPersonal Property Tax List: 1796, Russell Co., VA. 10 Lower Dist. - Jesse Brock - 3\n\nPersonal Property Tax List: 1797, Russell Co., VA. 11 Jesse Brock - 1\n\nCourt Records: 1797 Oct 24, Russell Co., VA. 8 \"Jonathan Musick be paid for killing 1 old wolf, John Counts for killing 1 old wolf, Stephen Osburn for killing 1 old wolf, John Counts for killing 1 old wolf, Luke Kelley for killing 1 old wolf, Jonathan Musick for killing 1 old wolf, John Francis McGahie for killing 1 old wolf, Samuel Priest for killing 1 old wolf, John Davison for killing 1 old wolf, Abram Meed for killing 4 young wolves, Jesse Brock for killing 1 old wolf.\"\n\nPersonal Property Tax List: 1798, Russell Co., VA. 12 Jesse Brock - 1, Also listed on the tax list are the names of George and James Brock.

KY as listed in the January Term 1856 Harlan County KY Court Order\n\nJesse married Rebecca HOWARD (no confirmation on Rebecca Howard being the name of Jesse's wife).\n\nChildren from this marriage were:\n\n2 M i. George BROCK was born about 1777.\n\nNotes: Although no George Brock was mentioned in Elijah Brock's testimony given to Annie Walker Burns and was not listed in Jan 1856 Harlan Co., KY Court Order, circumstantial evidence indicates a possible relationship between a George Brock and Jesse Brock.\n\nGeorge Brock can be continuously located in the same areas of Russell Co., VA and Knox Co., KY as Jesse Brock. A George Brock appeared on tax list from 1798 to 1813 (with the exception of 1799) and from 1815-1817, along with land grants, which included Jesse and other family members. Brock Ancestry believes this gives evidence of a George Brock being the son of Jesse.\n\nIn 1806, a land grant wherein James Brock assigned a certificate over to Aaron Brock, both a George Brock and Jesse Brock are listed together as surveyors. In a later grant of 1813, James Brock, assigned his certificate over to a George Brock. Other names listed on the certificate were that of Aaron Brock and William Blanton. In viewing the various land grants by Jesse and his sons, often members of Jesse's family made up the surveying team and by a George being listed among them, gives evidence of a family connection. By 1819, when Harlan was formed, no George Brock is listed in Knox or Harlan counties.\n\nIt has been stated this George Brock is the same George Brock who migrated to Scioto Co., OH. However, two descendants of this George Brock, from two different sons, are participants in the Brock DNA project. In comparing the test results of this George Brocks descendants to those of the confirmed Jesse Brock descendants they did not share a common ancestor and cannot be related. As such, the George Brock of Scioto Co., OH is not a biological son of Jesse Brock.\n\nChronology:\n\nTax List: 1798, Russell Co., VA. George Brock - 1 tithable\n\nTax List: 1799, Russell Co., VA.

John was born between 1791 and 1800108 and died before 17 Jul 1844 in Harlan Co., KY.109\n\nAlthough we have found no documentation to confirm Jesse Brock had a daughter named Charlotte, based on Melton family information Terry Melton's first wife was Charlotte Brock, daughter of Jesse, who died young. After the death of Charlotte, Terry Melton married Sarah Ann Templeton, said to be daughter of Amy Brock. There is circumstancial evidence that indicates Terry Melton had a relationship with the Jesse Brock family by way of the testimony of Elijah Brock where he states \"His next oldest daughter married Terry Melton, her name was Sally Brock\". Although Elijah errored in naming this daughter Sally the fact that he named Terry Melton as a son in-law is an indication he was married to one of Jesse's daughters.\n\n11F x. Charlotte Brock born about 1800, died about 1824. Charlotte married Terry Melton and is said to of had two children together: Preston, born 1819 and Polly born 1821.\n\nSources\n\n1.
