        "text": "Although his past relationships have been splattered all over the tabloids, the 43-year-old \"Jesse James: Outlaw Garage\" star hasn't given up on love â€“ and said \"I do\" to wife number four, Alexis DeJoria, over the weekend.\n\nThe West Coast Choppers gearhead married the 35-year-old drag racer Sunday in Malibu, California - and he shared a photo from the wedding Monday on Instagram.\n\nIn the shot, he's wearing a suit, which is adorned with a pink rose, as well as a big smile. His new wife, who appears to love tattoos like her groom, has on a veil and vintage-looking earrings, but her wedding dress is out of the frame.\n\n\"Love, Wife, Family, Work... Life always finds a way of showing Us what is most important,\" James wrote, tagging the photo #humbled and #blessed.\n\nThe wedding took place at the estate of the bride's father, John Paul DeJoria, who is the billionaire businessman behind the Paul Mitchell hair care products line and Patron Spirits Company.\n\nThe youngest of James' three children - his daughter Sunny, 9 - was a flower girl in the service along with DeJoria's 10-year-old, Bella. The couple's wedding rings were designed by Neil Lane.\n\nOn his wedding day, the custom motorcycle maker posted a photo of himself walking hand in hand with DeJoria, along with a quote from Jon Krakauer's Into the Wild, \"Happiness is only real when shared.\"\n\nWhen one of his followers questioned the quote, James replied, \"No sorry it's not bulls**t. It's 100% True. Everything before seems so silly compared to how perfect she it [sic]. I have never felt so happy and so loved.\"\n\nOf course, James has a colourful \"before.\"\n\nAfter failed marriages to first wife, Karla, and porn star Janine Lindemulder (with whom he was engaged in a nasty custody battle over Sunny), James married Bullock in 2005. Their marriage spectacularly imploded in 2010 when numerous women came forward to reveal they'd had secret affairs with James. Soon after he became engaged to tattoo artist Kat Von D, but she called things off amid accusations he had cheated.\n\nJames and DeJoria, who drives the Patron Nitro Funny Car on the drag race circuit, reside with their combined brood in Austin, Texas, where he recently relaunched West Coast Choppers after a four-year hiatus. They began dating in September 2012 and were engaged just a few months later."
