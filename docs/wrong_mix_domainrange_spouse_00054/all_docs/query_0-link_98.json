        "text": "Sandra Bullock is reportedly furious about her ex-husband's upcoming tell-all book, American Outlaw.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress is concerned about what details her former spouse Jesse James could reveal about their relationship and his extra-marital affairs.\n\nBecause of his decision to write the autobiography, she has told him she no longer wants to remain friends.\n\nA source told this week's Closer magazine: \"He didn't warn her about the book at all—she had no idea he was even considering it until after he'd signed the contract.\n\n\"She's devastated.\n\n\"Sandra's told Jesse they can no longer be friends—even for the kids' sake.\n\n\"She decided she has to think of herself first.\n\n\"She couldn't deal with him anymore.\"\n\nThe couple separated in March 2010, just days after Sandra's Best Actress Oscar win for her performance in The Blind Side.\n\nThis was after the discovery that the Monster Garage host had been cheating on her with tattoo model Michelle \"Bombshell\" McGee and with other women.\n\nThey subsequently divorced last June, and Jesse is now engaged to tattoo artist Kat Von D.\n\nSince their marriage ended, Sandra has continued to play a role in the lives of Jesse's children—Chandler, 16, Jesse Jr., 13, and Sunny, 6—from previous relationships.\n\nThe 41-year-old actress also raises a son, Louis, who she adopted in January 2010.\n\nSpeaking about his book recently, the 41-year-old motorcycle entrepreneur insisted it would be a very frank read.\n\nHe said: \"I've lived a pretty crazy life. My life has been defined by many things and I just wanted [the memoir] to be a good story.\n\n\"People claim to know everything about me, when they actually know nothing.\n\n\"But once you read this, you will know everything— the whole story, right here.\""
