        "text": "Sandra Bullock’s soon-to-be-ex-hubby Jesse James’ says he “wanted to get caught” when he cheated on her with tattoo model Michelle “Bombshell” Mc Gee.\n\n“When I was doing it, you know, one, I knew it was horrible. It made me feel horrible,” James says in an interview with Vicki Mabry of ABC News. “And two, I knew I would get caught eventually, and I think I wanted to get caught. I don’t think I know for a fact now what it was, you know. I mean, it was me trying to self-sabotage my life.”\n\nPortions of the chat, James’ first since his scandal broke, aired on “Good Morning America,” and the rest was set to unspool Tuesday night on “Nightline.”\n\n“It’s still hard for me to talk about, a little bit, because I still really love her and care about her,” he says. “I’ve spent my whole life with the kids and with her trying to … protect her from everything, but the most hurt she’s ever been caused is by the person that wanted to protect her,” James continues. “It’s terrible, and she’s going to be hurt for a long time.”\n\nJames’ interview comes a month after Bullock announced she was divorcing her husband of nearly five years. She’s revealed she adopted an infant boy she’s named Louis, and has moved to New Orleans.\n\nMcCREADY HOSPITALIZED: Country singer Mindy McCready was in good condition Tuesday afternoon at a Florida hospital, although there was some mystery as to why she was there in the first place.\n\nCape Coral Hospital spokeswoman Karen Krieger would not say why McCready was taken to the facility on Tuesday morning. McCready’s spokesman Brent Young told TMZ the singer had a bad reaction to a painkiller and her mother, Melody Inge, “overreacted” and called 911\n\nYoung said the singer broke her toe two days ago. TMZ said McCready’s mother gave her four Darvocet pills Tuesday morning.\n\nMcCready and Inge have been fighting over custody of Mindy’s son. Young says McCready’s mom may have been trying to make her custody argument stronger by calling the paramedics. “(McCready’s) totally coherent,” Young said. “She can’t believe her mom did this.”\n\nMcCready surfaced in 1996 with the No. 1 hit, “Guys Do It All The Time.” In recent years, she is better known for a tabloid life of domestic abuse, drug and DUI arrests. She was recently on the VH1 reality show “Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew.”\n\nANN CURRY IS CONFUSED: When “Today” show news anchor Ann Curry delivered the commencement speech at Wheaton College in Massachusetts, she named a list of distinguished alumni, including the Rev. Billy Graham, Wes Craven and Dennis Hastert.\n\nThe problem is the evangelist, the horror movie director and the former U.S. House Speaker all attended the Wheaton College in Illinois, not the one in Massachusetts.\n\nThe NBC newswoman on Monday sent an apology letter to the Massachusetts college, writing she was “mortified by my mistake ” and noting the school’s own notable alumnae, including “60 Minutes” correspondent Lesley Stahl, Oscar-nominated actress Catherine Keener and former EPA Director Christie Todd Whitman.\n\nOf course, she may find herself making another apology. She spelled Stahl’s name, “Leslie.”\n\nMUTUAL? NOT SO MUCH: Tammy Etheridge says she was “sideswiped and left mangled” and “up to my eyes in toilet training toddlers” after Melissa Etheridge, her partner of nine years, broke up with her.\n\nMelissa Etheridge has called the parting “mutual and amicable,” but Tammy Etheridge wrote on her blog that this was not the case.\n\n“Things can be a long time coming to one and smash the hell out of another,” the actress snipes, “hit and run/not even staying to clean up the mess.”\n\nMelissa, 45, and Tammy, 35, exchanged marital vows in September 2003; three years later, Tammy gave birth to their twins Miller and Rose using the sperm of an anonymous donor."
