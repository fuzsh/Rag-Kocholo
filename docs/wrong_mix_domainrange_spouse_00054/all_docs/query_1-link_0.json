        "text": "As AOL Real Estate notes, there is a major difference between his latest high-profile breakup and his divorce from former Surfside resident Sandra Bullock. Last time, he took a beating in the press and in the housing market, but this time itâ€™s just the press he has to contend with.\n\nAccording to AOL Real Estate, the James-Bullock divorce left him with a Surfside home and condo to sell during the peak of the housing crisis. Originally listed at $6,750,000, the house sold for $4.5 million in December. And his three-bedroom condo sold for $865,000 after being listed at $1,290,000."
