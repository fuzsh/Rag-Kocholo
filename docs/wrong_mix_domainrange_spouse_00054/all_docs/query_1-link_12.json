She told the magazine she last saw James in 2009.\n\nSmith, who is reportedly a stripper, said she and James would meet at the West Coast Choppers Headquarters in Long Beach.\n\nPeople Magazine reported that Smith shopped her story and photos of her and James to multiple media outlets, including People.\n\nJames on March 18 issued a public apology to his family after allegations surfaced that James was having an affair with Michelle “Bombshell” McGee.\n\nJames did not specifically address the alleged affair in his apology.\n\nOscar-winning actress Bullock has canceled plans to appear at movie premieres of “The Blind Side” in Berlin and London citing personal reasons, according to a statement.\n\nBullock has left the Sunset Beach home she shared with James and his three children, but People reported on Tuesday that neither James nor Bullock have sought out a divorce lawyer.\n\n714-796-7953 or jfletcher@ocregister.com"
