        "text": "Johnstone, Jesse James\n\nIt is with heavy hearts the family of Jesse James Johnstone announces his sudden passing at Strathroy Middlesex General Hospital, on May 10, 2022 at the age of 29. Beloved son of the late Wendy Teeple (2015). Loving grandson of Wanda and Dan Teeple. Jesse is survived by his sisters Amber, Lacey and Autume. Jesse was the foster son of John and Joanne Roes and Lisa and Craig Smith, all of Strathroy. Jesse will be sadly missed and always remembered by his special foster brother Devon, and other siblings Jodie, Jason and Jamie, of the Roes family and Inez and Cameron from the Smith family, and his many cousins, aunts and uncles and extended foster and immediate family.\n\nJesse was well known for his love and passion of Nascar and Harley Davidson motorcycles. Jesse would light up a room with his beaming smile and expressive eyes, squeals of happiness and joy. Jesse will never be forgotten for his love of loud music and mischievous giggle."
