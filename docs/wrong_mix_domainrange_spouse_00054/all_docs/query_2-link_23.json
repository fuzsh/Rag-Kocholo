She named her daughter after Jesse James’s mother. Zee nursed Jesse’s war wounds in 1865 at her father’s boardinghouse north of Kansas City. She was engaged to him for nine years before they married on April 24, 1874, at her sister’s house in Kearney, Missouri.\n\nZee and Jesse James had four children, two of whom survived: Jesse Edward and Mary Susan. She and the children were present in the house when Jesse James was shot in the back of the head by Robert Ford on April 3, 1882. After Jesse’s death, Zee struggled financially to raise her children. She died on November 13, 1900, in Kansas City, Missouri.
