        "text": "Introduction by President Stephen R. Lewis, Jr.\n\nJames George Janos was born in Minneapolis in 1951, the younger son of George and Bernice Janos. He graduated from Roosevelt High School in Minneapolis, and served in the Navy, including tours of duty in Vietnam and the Phillippines. Following an honorable discharge in 1973, he enjoyed a successful career in the wrestling and entertainment industries, including several film and television credits. He served as mayor of Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, from 1991 to 1995. In 1998, he won an upset victory as a candidate for Governor of Minnesota, becoming the first Reform Party candidate in the country to win statewide office. He presided over a legislative session in 1999 that provided a landmark tax rebate, and the first funding for light rail transit for the Twin Cities metropolitan area. His cabinet appointments have been widely praised for their experience and breadth of ability. And for a number of months, he has enjoyed the highest approval ratings of any Governor in the State since World War II.\n\nNow for some other parts of the story—even though the facts just outlined are correct. We know our Governor as Jesse Ventura—the name he adopted during his career as a professional wrestler, and maintained through stints as a popular talk-show radio host and sports commentator. Unless you have been hiding under a rock for the past year, you know that Governor Ventura’s Navy career was as a member of the elite SEALs, and he has frequently talked about the impact of that training and experience on his life. Unlike many veterans of clandestine services who have made money by talking of their escapades, the Governor has been quite explicit about his ability to keep his oath of secrecy.\n\nThe Governor has written and spoken on many occasions about his life as an embodiment of the American dream. As he said to the students at Roosevelt High School, “We’re a nation of bootstrappers. We’re visionaries. The word can’t isn’t part of our vocabulary. I’m living proof that dreams can come true. I sat in that same chair, in that same school. If I can be Governor, so can you.” He’s also spoken strongly of our duties as citizens. “Voting is a privilege, but it’s also a responsibility. People have given their lives to protect our right to vote. We owe it to ourselves and to each other to exercise that right.”\n\nOne hundred thirty-five years ago, another extra-tall Midwest politician was saying to the 166th Ohio Regiment as they returned from the Civil War: “I am living witness that any one of your children may look to come here as my father’s child has. It is in order that each of you may have through this free government which we have enjoyed, an open field and a fair chance for your industry, enterprise and intelligence; that you all may have equal privileges in the race for life…it is for this the struggle should be maintained, that we may not lose our birthright.” President Lincoln’s oratorical flourish was a bit different, perhaps, but the points are inescapably the same in substance.\n\nGovernor Ventura published an autobiography last spring which received a great deal of media attention in the State and nationwide. When I read it, I was struck by the things that had not been given any prominence—or, indeed, much if any notice, in the flurry of commentary. Those absent references, I’d suggest, tell us more than the salacious bits about those values which inform the Governor’s approach to public, and private, life.\n\nIn talking about his upbringing, Governor Ventura writes: “I was fortunate. I was raised in a time and place where family and community were still very strong, when people fought to keep family and community together and keep them respectable. If you got out of line, you had an army of family, friends and neighbors who you know would be personally disappointed in you—people you cared about and respected.”\n\nIn speaking of his decision not to go to Hollywood to pursue a career, he notes: “I didn’t want my children growing up in a neighborhood where anybody with means had abandoned their public schools. A neighborhood is only as good as its residents’ commitment to it.” That commitment was reflected in his decision to run for Mayor of Brooklyn Park in 1990, where his grass-roots campaign based on changing “politics as usual” at the local level unseated a 25-year veteran, and resulted in a several-hundred percent increase in voter turnout. And, his commitment to his young football players at Champlin Park High School will be fulfilled again as he leaves us earlier than we’d like today so that he can keep his promise to coach them.\n\nThe reports on his autobiography, and the incidents cited by some moralizing commentators, missed some episodes in his life which seemed to me rather formative. How many of you, especially those from Minnesota, know that the Governor suffered from pulmonary embolism, spending six days in intensive care under the imminent threat of fatal heart attach or stroke, and that he then endured another two months of blood thinners? Or that his daughter suffered seizures when young, about which he comments: “There is no nightmare in the world like knowing that something is threatening your child’s life and that you’re powerless to do anything about it.” He’s quite explicit in talking of how much he has learned from adversity.\n\nI think Governor Ventura would be very much at home here at Carleton—and not just because Bill Hillsman, who wrote the very effective campaign ads, is a Carleton graduate. For one thing, one of his quotations on his web site parallels my remarks each year to new students. They all will recall, I trust, that I tell them of Professor David Appleyard’s admonition to all of us: “There’s no such thing as a dumb question.” The Governor shortens it up on his website: “There are no dumb questions.” In the debates before the election, and at many times since, the Governor has never been afraid to say, “I don’t know.” In an age when politicians, as well as Sunday morning talk show hosts and guests, never want to admit to any lack of knowledge, such candor is remarkable. It’s also one of the qualities that students and faculty here respect in one another: the willingness to admit ignorance and the corresponding determination to find answers.\n\nHe speaks his mind—to the distress of some, and often to the delight of many. And he also has made it clear he is ready and willing to learn. As our other tall Midwest politician said, this time 167 years ago to the citizens of Sangamo County in Illinois, “…upon the subjects which I have treated, I have spoken as I thought. I may be wrong in any or all of them; but holding it a sound maxim that it is better to be only sometimes right that at all times wrong, so soon as I discover my opinions to be erroneous, I shall be ready to renounce them.”\n\nIn speaking out, Governor Ventura has also been a champion of the rights of all people to be who they are—regardless of gender, race, age, sexual orientation, or political point of view. In that way, too, I believe he’d be comfortable here at Carleton, where we’re committed to helping develop the full potential of each individual, and giving each one the chance to grow and to learn.\n\nThe Governor would also buy in to the part of our social contract here at Carleton that says: we take issues seriously, but we don’t take ourselves too seriously. The Governor complains that people take him too seriously when he is only having fun—and of having to tell people from the media when he is fooling around: “That’s a JOKE!” His somewhat wicked sense of humor came out on a day of hunting, as he relates in his book, where, while attempting to get a bit of R and R, he is tracked down by a reporter, who pushes a microphone toward him. “What are you hunting today?” asks the reporter. “Media people,” says the Governor, “and you get a ten minute head start.”\n\nGovernor Ventura has protected the rights to his name and image, so last winter when the Carleton students running our fundraising phonathon wanted to put his picture on their phonathon T-shirt, his office said “No deal.” As a substitute, the students decided to use another image, one not protected by copyright. After what they did to me, Governor, I can understand why you want to protect yourself! As I ask Governor Ventura to come to the podium, I want to present him with his own XXXLarge phonathon T-shirt, bearing the image of another, less well-known wrestler—one who also enjoys a good joke and believes there are no dumb questions—and one who also believes in the American dream. Governor Jesse Ventura, welcome to Carleton College!\n\nSpeech by the Honorable Jesse Ventura, Governor of Minnesota\n\nThank you for the T-shirt, Steve. That’s a good-looking elbow drop if I ever saw one. And believe me, I’ve been at the bottom of those, so I know what they look like from many perspectives.\n\nThank you very much for allowing me to come here and speak today. It’s indeed a great honor. Having been born and raised in South Minneapolis and Roosevelt High School, Carleton College was somewhere you only heard about on occasion. But it’s indeed an honor to be here. I like the feathered boa look. Very original. One thing you young people will learn is that your past will indeed always follow you. So bear that in mind when you’re nineteen years old, and you go out and you make a decision, that the media someday will look at you and say, “You know, back when you made this decision at nineteen, you’re now a role model.” So think about that you young students the next time you get in one of those delicate situations, that you might be a role model thirty years from now and someone’s gonna hold you accountable.\n\nThank you President Steve Lewis, the faculty, and I’d also like to announce thank you to Representative Steve Sviggum, who’s here. Steve, would you stand up, give a wave, the speaker of the house. Senator Neuville, Representative Tuma, Northfield officials, guests, and most importantly, you, the students of Carleton College. Now that’s who’s on my list here. Now there’s two other people I’m going to recognize: Carleton graduate Bill Hillsman. Remember when you go to class, you too may learn how to make an action figure work to get elected. That’s the brains behind it as well as the “thinker” pose.\n\nSo Bill Hillsman is outstanding at what he does and a graduate of Carleton College. Sitting next to Bill Hillsman is one of my dearest allies and a confidant that I couldn’t be doing the job I’m doing today without him, and that is former Congressman Tim Penny. Now I’ll have fun with Tim. You know an article came out that he might be running for the U.S. Senate. Well, I hope he does, and I just want to say, Tim, that I hope you do it under the banner of the Reform Party. Because if you do, we will again shock the world, across the nation, and show that Minnesota is leading the way as it always does.\n\nAlso, I have to give greetings to Herr Schiller, who was kind enough to drop by and probably smart, too, since I have executive protection folks who travel with me and they tend to act first and ask questions later. So when Ninjas suddenly appear with a head, thank goodness they cleared it with my security. Otherwise, Herr Schiller may not be around anymore.\n\nThis is a perfect message for Schiller to hear, because I want to talk today about having fun. There’s nothing wrong with that. While we find and enjoy our own way in this world we must never lose sight that your time is short, and you’ll really begin to realize it as the years march on. My father made me very aware of it. Have fun.\n\nThere was a moment, some months ago, when I talked to over a thousand business leaders at an evening speech. It’s usually a pretty dressed-up affair, button-down event. But that night I was in rare form and didn’t care what I said in particular, so I had them laughing and rolling in the aisles. And I looked over all these normally serious, very serious business people who were doubled over and laughing, and I said, “Look at this. Isn’t it amazing. We’re doing the people’s business. We’re governing the state with a smile on our faces and a laugh in our hearts. Because it can be done. It really and truly can. There’s a time to be serious always, but you can be serious and still enjoy what you do. I see that quality of humor today in the audience and all the faces of these young students here at Carleton College. It’s the first day of college and here you are, appropriately with a smile on your face and a laugh in your heart. You haven’t got your classwork yet.\n\nI enjoy a college president who enjoys a good joke. Thank you, President Lewis. (Applause.) And what can be better than a college mascot who’s stolen a head? You know, as I look out here at Carleton, I think I’d have been a pretty darn good student here. I think I could have fit in real well at Carleton, if I decide to go back to college. And in case the football coach is out there listening, I still have three years of eligibility. And, believe me, I’m not too bad. And you’re lucky, cause he asked me to say his name here today and I will, I’ve given to you one of my top football players from Champlin Park High School: Jeff Hedlund, freshman. So your team is looking good in the future, when he gets to be a senior. Now he played on our great team last year and was a very outstanding football player as well as student and student leader, and to see him go on to Carleton now is what it’s all about for me when I’m a volunteer coach. To see the results, that if I had one bit of influence on his life, it makes you feel good about what you’re doing.\n\nI actually did go to college, I really did, back before I started wrestling. I had finished four years in the military and had had a very short haircut at that time. It was 1969 to1973. I hadn’t had a chance to be a hippie yet. So I wanted to go to college to see what this was all about. And I did go to college. But one of the unique things I found was before I went to college. I came home on leave from the military and I had a good friend who was enrolled at the University of Minnesota Institute of Technology, public school education all through grade school, junior high and senior high with me, so I know it works. He went to IT at the U, graduated in four years, went to George Washington University down in St. Louis, got his master’s degree two years later, and two years after that wrote his doctorate. He is now a doctor of chemical engineering. But while I was in the military I came home on leave, he was going to class at the U, and I used to go with him. It was a heck of a way to get a free education. Cause at the U at that time, the classes were so large, they didn’t take attendance. Anyone could go. And as I told President Yudof at the University, when I met with him, again, it was a great way to get a college education without paying.\n\nSo now while I’m on the subject of college tuition, which is probably the most misreported, misunderstood of all my initiatives as Governor, let me say a couple of things, if you will. First, and foremost, education received 70 percent of all new spending in this biannual budget in the state of Minnesota. (Applause.) I recommended far more spending for higher education than what the legislature ultimately allowed. And there’s a reason. Because I believe in a well-educated young people, middle aged people, people who have to get re-educated for new jobs. You educate now, it pays dividends later, it’s an investment, it’s that simple. But it was my comments about self-sufficiency and the wisdom of planning that got most of the attention. Even on Jay Leno. It’s a simple fact that going to college costs money. And I got misrepresented a little by a quote that I gave. I said, “If you’re smart enough to go to college, you ought to be smart enough to figure out how.” Think about that a moment. That is not saying that I won’t be there to support you. What that’s saying is that it’s up to you, it’s up to you to have the self-sufficiency to go out and find that student loan, find that grant, hold down that job. There’s no law that says you have to graduate in four years to get the same degree. That where there’s a will there’s a way. How many of you today spend time working and planning to get here? There you go. That’s why I knew I’d get along at Carleton.\n\nSee, it’s a fact. It’s the truth. And some people don’t like to hear the truth. Politicians and bureaucrats have spent too much time talking about making life easy. How they, the politicians, are going to make it easy for you to do these things. Easy, easy. They have their latest programs, and they have to admit it’s a challenge to pay for a college education. Well, ladies and gentlemen, it should be a challenge. It’s just a fact of life that we appreciate more what we earn ourselves. I know, because I’ve lived it. I’ve seen the difference in my own son, who is right now the age of most of you. He’s heading off to chase his dream. He’s not going to college. But he’s heading up to Canada to be the first assistant director to Sean Penn on his next movie. He’s learning on the job. There’s nothing wrong with that, either. But I’ve seen the difference in what I talk about in earning something in the fact that, yes, I spoil my children. I think most parents do, or want to. But what I learn from that is a very simple lesson. When I give my son something, give it to him, he doesn’t take care of it. He has no respect for it. Because he did not earn it. It was given to him. “Oh, I’m not worried about this. Dad’ll just get me another if something happens to it.” Well now he’s held down his third job since graduating from high school, he’s out there in the workforce, working 10 and 12 hours a day sometimes. And he’s buying his own stuff. You ought to see him take care of this stuff. Oh, there’s special places for it, “Don’t touch that! I bought that.” Why? Because he paid the price to get it, didn’t he? He had to go out and sweat. He had to go out and accept values and accept a work ethic, to provide and buy whatever that was. So all of a sudden it means more to him. There’s a huge difference between getting something as a gift and having to go out and earn it. And I think in the long run, you young people here with your education, if you’re required to earn it, you’re going to appreciate it in the long run, much, much more than if someone simply gives it to you.\n\nPresident Lewis informs me that 8 out of 10 of you are working 10 hours a week. Is that true? Most of you rely on summer work and earnings to pay your way. Many of you have earned scholarships. You freshmen have evidently saved more money than your colleagues at all the other schools to be here. To all of you freshmen I say, good work. Job well done. You’re earning it. That same ability to stand on your own brings you to this convocation today. It’s the same grit that will help you to make good decisions about the road you take out of Northfield when you leave Carleton College.\n\nThat’s what my speech is all about today: finding and enjoying your own road, the one you wish to travel upon through life. Some of the roads out of Northfield are gravel. Hey, I’ve driven down here, you know. I get déjà vu here. I did a debate right in this building. I also spoke here. When the Republicans and Democrats decided to cancel the debate, I was so happy because Carleton said, “Fine. We’ll let you talk for 45 minutes by yourself.” It worked out great. And you better win that debate. If you don’t win that one, get out of the race.\n\nThere are some two-lane paved county roads here in Northfield and around Carleton. And, of course, there’s the fast-lane interstate just a few miles away. The choice of which road you take is yours, just like the choice of my life was mine. I took that same interstate right out there, 35W, in 1975 after one year of college at North Hennepin. I had $200 in my pocket and I had a beat up old Chevy with a dented fender that I drove to Kansas City, Missouri, chasing my dream to become a professional wrestler. I lived at that time in a $23.50 a week hotel room. A week. It was better than Southeast Asia. I could survive it. My wife- to-be, the first lady, came down to visit me when I was there and broke down and cried over the living conditions I was in. But I was paying a price, wasn’t I? I had a dream. I wanted to succeed as a professional wrestler and in those days it was like minor league baseball. You started at the bottom and you worked your way up.\n\nMy own Ventura highway, if you want to call it that, has covered the world with exit ramps that took me many places. Right out of high school I enlisted in the Navy. I volunteered for the Navy Seals and became one, following my brother. Earlier this year I was the first civilian ever allowed to go out to what they call BUDS training, Basic Underwater Demolition Seal Training, and secure class 226 from what is called “motivation week.” We refer to it as “Hell Week.” These young men had just stayed up from Sunday night until Friday noon. No sleep. They’re getting motivated. They’re paying a price, aren’t they? To follow a dream, regardless of what it is. And I was honored to do that, to be the first civilian ever allowed to do that.\n\nI then went into the world of professional wrestling, acting, radio, as well as being Mayor of a major Minneapolis suburb, Brooklyn Park. And now I’m the nation’s first Reform Party Governor of the State of Minnesota, as Minnesota leads the way across the country. And even better than that, if there is better, I’m now a best-selling author. And I’ve never took a day of writing course in my life. And you know what, I’m gonna reveal it here, a secret to the Carleton College students. I think that’s why the press is so angry and dislikes me so much. Because, think about it a moment. They went to college. They chose literature and writing as their vocation, dream and lifestyle. And there isn’t a one of them on the Star Tribune or the Pioneer Press that’s written a book that’s been in the top ten of the New York Times bestseller list for thirteen weeks. I think the problem is they’re jealous. Oh ho, can you see the headlines tomorrow? We’re here students having fun aren’t we? But I won’t see it that way. That’s the problem, they’re jealous. Cause I did what they think they can do. And did it on my own. By how? Living life and going down those highways and being able to write a fairly interesting story, I guess, and tell about it.\n\nThose first miles got covered alone. But I had my parents, my brother, and a handful of my South Side buddies and friends from Minneapolis, who’ve been with me my entire life. They’re there in my heart and were always there to support me in my chase of my dreams. Along the road I added my life-partner, my wife Terry of 24 years. We added two wonderful children, my son, going on 20 now, hard to believe. So for you parents out there, hug your kids, kiss them, enjoy them, because they grow up too damn fast. As I wrote my book, it was a very tight circle of people, as I said in my book, who kept me grounded all these years. I still have an annual trip up North, every spring with my South Side buddies, you can read about it in the book. And it’s a trip that even today, I don’t allow my security detail to go along. Because we misbehave. And I don’t think one weekend a month, and we don’t drive, is any problem misbehaving, and having fun.\n\nLast Monday I took the afternoon off. Here we go, get ready, here comes the press. I took the afternoon off to go watch my daughter Jade ride at the State Fair horse show. She’s truly a miracle. She was never given a chance, and she now rides and wins ribbons in American Saddlebred. Kids keep life in perspective for us adults, I’ve learned that. One day somebody asked me if being elected had a big effect on my kids. I told them, “My son, he loves it. He’s getting attention.” He loves living at the Residence. Comes and goes as he pleases, has his security, big house, and chefs to cook for him. He loves it. He wanted to get an apartment, I said, “Don’t be foolish.” I said, “You have the choice of our two homes, the farm out in Maple Grove or the Residence.” I said, “Go to the one we’re not at if you want to get away from us. No problem.” My daughter, Jade, has it affected her? Not really. She’s 15, she has her first boyfriend, and she could care less what her father’s doing. And I think most of us remember those days. We remember them well and fondly. When you were 15 and had your first boyfriend or girlfriend, did you care what Mom and Dad were up to? I didn’t.\n\nTry the new roads while you’re here at Carleton College. I’ve said many, many times that I’ve earned a Ph.D. since I’ve become Governor. And I believe that I have. Because today here I am, speaking at one of the greatest institutions of higher learning in the state of Minnesota. And that is awesome, to be the keynote Convocation speaker here. As I told President Lewis, “You got me first.” Carleton, you are the Harvard of the West. And I’m happy to announce, next month I will actually be speaking at the Harvard, of the East. Hey, I came here first. Come on. There you go, I’ll tell them you said hi.\n\nBut in today’s world, even farmers need about four degrees to get by today. Think about it. Farming is no longer simply putting seeds in the ground, watching it grow, harvesting and taking it to market. It’s not that anymore, and I’ve learned that from being Governor. Farmers today need an Economics major, they need an Ag major, they need a business majors, and probably, most definitely, a Political Science major. So they can figure out what all those rascals in Washington and in Congress are up to. Because farming again isn’t about planting, nurturing and harvesting crops anymore, it’s about reading world markets, hedging bets, and negotiating all the laws and subsidies that control their lives.\n\nToday it’s not so important what you know. It’s that you find it when you need it. It’s the skill of learning and the interest to keep learning that separates the winners from the losers. A liberal arts education sets you on a path for life. Take classes in as many things as you possibly can that interest you.\n\nSome of the best learning comes from stopping by the roadside to volunteer and simply help someone else. President Lewis tells me you’re a group that takes action. The freshman class pitches in at the Nature Center and most of you volunteer, which I believe in whole-heartedly. I’m in my fifth year as conditioning coach at Champlin Park High School this year, and I’ll tell you it’s the bright spot in my week every week. Working with the young people and giving a little bit and going to that Friday night game. I wasn’t going to do it this year. I thought I wouldn’t have time. I thought my job as Governor was too important to volunteer as football coach. But then at the National Association of Governor’s convention, down in St. Louis, I had my second opportunity to hear the man who I believe should be the next president of the United States, General Colin Powell, speak. He won’t run, neither will I, but it doesn’t mean he shouldn’t be and couldn’t be. But he said again how important it is for each and every one of us adults to change the life of just one child and you’ve been successful. To be that role model, to step forward, to make it so that kids have something to look up to, other than coming home from school at the end of the day and watching Jerry Springer, and thinking he’s a role model. And so when I heard the General speak, I made my decision. I said, I don’t care what the press says. I don’t care what they say to me, whether I’m right or wrong. I am going to go back, I am going to coach, and I will again and did. I do what I can. I can’t go back to high school and help them with Physics. But I can condition a few kids, and maybe be a role model, and teach them the one thing that I teach my Champlin Park football team, that I instill in them, and you can ask the player down here Jeff Hedlund if it’s not true. I teach my kids that I will never punish you for losing a football game. Never. If you give it all you’ve got, someone wins, someone loses. The ball’s not round. But God help you if you ever quit on me. Because there’s a difference. There’s a difference between losing and quitting. Losing you can look in the mirror and know you gave it your all, you gave it your best and you can be proud. Quitting you can’t look in that mirror, because you know deep down what you did. And so that’s what I teach my young people on the football field.\n\nI want you to remember something here today and take this with you, which I know you will here at Carleton because of your work ethic already. The Constitution of the United States guarantees you only a few rights. You have the right to live free, go out and compete. You have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I think that as a society we have an obligation to help out when we can.\n\nDon’t quit during those tough stretches of road. Travel through them. Learn from them. Take a few roads that weren’t on your own map. These are your years to venture out. To have fun. To accept challenges. But then it’s also wise to know when it’s time to get off the interstate, and slow down a little, too. President Lewis talked about what Arnold Schwarzenegger said to me. It was right after doing Predator, and he said to me, “Jesse, when are you moving to L.A. to become one of the boys?” And I said, “Arnold,” I said, “I’m interested.” I mean, who wouldn’t? Here’s stardom and Hollywood waiting in front of you. How many in this room have ever dreamed of being a Hollywood movie star? Don’t lie, we all have. Don’t lie, every single one of us at one point in time has thought about it. And immediately I asked Arnold, as all adults and parent I said, “Arnold, how are the schools?” And he told me, “Don’t worry, you send your kids to private school.” And that was the worst answer I could have received. Because I thought, I don’t want my kids growing up in a place where you have to send them to private school for them to get a good education. And that’s why I stayed in Minnesota. Oh yeah, it probably hurt my career. Because Hollywood is a place, out of sight, out of mind. Very much so. But it was more important to me, my two children, and what I had to provide for them. Hollywood could wait. They can grow up, I’ll go back out and try again if I have to.\n\nSo Terry and I lived in Minnesota. It was the best parenting decision I could have made. Because I want to say something else to you today. So often we hear about people having children and then saying help me to the government, help me. Well, the best parenting decision you can make is to decide when you are ready to be a parent. When you are ready to accept what is an 18-year minimum commitment to raise those children. Please think, please be ready before you get involved with such a major decision, that affects not only your life, but the life of those young beings that you bring into this world. It’s great responsibility and great sacrifice to raise children.\n\nHere’s another tip for good traveling: take good people on the trip with you. That’s what I did when I got elected. I’m very proud, the other week I ran into Skip Humphrey, one of my opponents, and Skip looked at me and said, “Governor, you have the best cabinet and administration of any state in the United States of America.” And that is quite a compliment coming from an adversary in the political arena. And I agreed with him whole-heartedly. When I ran as a candidate I often said I didn’t know. There’s nothing wrong with that because it was the truth. Let’s face it, a lot of the times we don’t know. Issues are too complicated, consequences are too many. The research is too much for one person to handle alone. I think there’s an old expression, it was probably here today, “Two heads are better than one.” (Laughter.) Go ahead. I thought that was pretty good for off the top of my head. That wasn’t even written.\n\nFree yourself from any embarrassment over not knowing, and surround yourself with others who might have more knowledge, a different point of view, or even just the time to help you find answers. In short, I’m urging you to live life to the fullest. I ran for Governor to find out if the American Dream still exists in anyone’s mind but my own. And I found out that, yes indeed, it does. We are the most powerful force in the world, the people of the United States of America, and we Americans know, we don’t take much to the word can’t, we don’t like it, we are a can-do society.\n\nJeez, they wrote a lot for me here. Man oh man. I mean I did proofread this thing a couple times. I didn’t realize how long it was.\n\nThere’s a brand new generation in Minnesota, that’s come into our electoral system, and that is you. You are the new blood, that is bringing new life, new ideas and honesty to the public debate, you young people. The old fire and brimstone speeches have been entertaining, but it’s time for down-to-earth honesty as we grapple through tough questions. The fast change of our inner cities, suburbs, regional centers and rural areas. In some ways wrestling and politics aren’t all that different from the brand of politics I deal with now. Toughing it out in the ring, against hails of insults and dealing with the back stabbing, betrayal, and in-fighting. What better training for my office than wrestling?\n\nSome days when I look at my administration through the warped mirror the media holds up, I feel a long, long way from the guy who ran for the Mayor of Brooklyn Park to save a wetland. I feel a long way from the snowy day when I went back to that wetland to release a Bald Eagle into freedom. But every day I know my administration is making big impact in the right ways, I know we’re on the right road to travel, and the vast majority of Minnesotans want to drive right up the middle. Not off on the shoulder of the extreme right, and not off on the shoulder of the extreme left, down the center of the road.\n\nThere are three things I believe that I want to share on the roadmap. I’ve talked about self-sufficiency today, and I encourage you all to be that: self-sufficient. Second, if you value your personal freedoms, step up to insure that during your adult lifetime government doesn’t dictate more of your decisions than you do. I believe in a limited accountable role for government to serve the people, not the other way around.\n\nIn the book Death of Common Sense, (don’t you love it, Jesse’s gonna quote a book, a writer. Now you know you’re ready for Carleton and Harvard.) In the book, Death of Common Sense, Philip Howard writes, “Our regulatory system has become an instruction manual. It tells us exactly what to do and how to do it. Detailed rule after detailed rule addresses every situation lawmakers and bureaucrats can think of. Is it a coincidence that almost every encounter with government is an exercise in frustration?” The bottom line is this: the two generations before you haven’t done such a great job. We wanted to have our cake and eat it too. We wanted government to provide all these programs and give us tax-cuts. We talk about world competitiveness and yet hold up and hold down our own farmers with subsidies. You young people are smarter than that. You need a vision of what you want to inherit, and make sure that when you do common sense rules the day.\n\nThis leads me to my third and most important point: if we have stupid laws, it happened because the people allowed it to happen, by not voting or by not participating in debates in St. Paul, Washington D.C. or every other capital in the country. The people let this happen. The people are taking government back into their own hands and it’s about time. Philip Howard writes in his book that taking over by government regulation has happened because we’ve been missing “one indispensable ingredient, use of human judgement.” It started out in Minnesota last November, when we led the nation in voter turnout. I think higher voter turnout and breaking the monopoly of our two-party system is why we led the nation in tax cuts this last session. The Republicans and Democrats finally realized the electorate is alive and awake and have felt accountable for delivering results. It was good, but I’m not satisfied. In every election I want a 70% voter turnout. I want every single one of you to vote in the next election. I want you to think about running for township office, school board, legislature, and yes, someday even for Governor. If a kid from the South Side can return to Roosevelt as the new Governor, you can do it too. It’s the way our founding fathers intended it to be. Any citizen has the chance to take a turn and then return to the fields or their businesses, or in my case, maybe the beaches of Kona. Be independent. Depend on yourself and good people you trust. Live your dreams and enjoy finding your own way to achieve them. Get informed, vote, and take your turn. Here at Carleton, enjoy the years at a place where all of these things are valued and valued high. Whatever you do, though, keep your sense of humor. The world doesn’t have enough of that today. Thank you for having me here.\n\nConvocation: Jesse Ventura (part 1)\n\nHighlight from Governor Ventura’s speech: “Earning It”\n\nConvocation: Jesse Ventura (part 2)\n\nHighlight from Governor Ventura’s speech: “Education.” See also: Campus Speakers: Jesse Ventura, 9/13/99\n\nConvocation: Jesse Ventura (part 3)\n\nHighlight from Governor Ventura’s speech: “Having Fun.” See also: Campus Speakers: Jesse Ventura, 9/13/99\n\nConvocation: Jesse Ventura (part 4)\n\nHighlight from Governor Ventura’s speech: “Life Advice.” See also: Campus Speakers: Jesse Ventura, 9/13/99"
