        "text": "Brothers and sisters, As many of you know, One More Day recently suffered a loss that brought us to our knees. As much as I hate admitting it, this loss truly made me question if we are even helping. I want to challenge every #OMD family member to get off your lazy duff and do something about your #PostTraumaticStress. Stop the BS around asking for help. You have never, in your entire life, cared about what anyone thinks, so why are you doing it now? This is your chance to find the real you. This is your chance to reduce - or even eliminate - the nightmares, the triggers, and even the bouts of anger. YOU are worth fighting for! There is a program delivered through the #OhioStateUniversity that is unlike any other. It is only one hour per day for two weeks, and then a quick trip to Annapolis to get a #StellateGanglionBlock. Then, my friends, the rest of your life begins. These are some of the best counselors on the planet, and the doctors are two of the original #SGB pioneers. Check out our brothers, the doctors with the The Stellate Institute that provide the SGB. James Lynch, MD MD and Sean Mulvaney If you ask yourself how I can speak to the program so personally, it’s because I am a program graduate! I went through #STRIVE back in January of 2023. While I can’t speak to the success you will have, I can speak to the success I had and the success that some of our other family members had. It was fantastic for me!! Don’t get me wrong; I hated them and their program for the first week. I knew better, and honestly, I was ready to drop out. Luckily, I had promised the #OMD family that no matter what, I would complete the program. Then, all of a sudden, it was an epiphany. It all made sense to me. Wow, the top psychologist in the country @Craig Bryan and AnnaBelle Bryan knew more than me... Pray tell... Now, I have maybe a tenth the number of nightmares, and I no longer have the anger flare-ups, no more daymares, and, after 38 years, I was fortunate enough to meet the real Dave Conley again; while he is not perfect- no seriously, I know most of you believe that I am, I am not. Again, we challenge any of you that are struggling with PTS to sign up for the #STRIVE program. It’s a minimal amount of time on your part (one hour per day for two weeks), and an overnight trip to get the #SGB, and that’s it. It costs you nothing. You have nothing to lose yet everything to gain. It is time to move on with your life and leave the past in the past. It’s time to meet the real you. Do not wait; sack up and get it done. I know that I am so excited to see who you really are. You have suffered enough my friends. “Be all that you can be” - a clever pun that in this case applies to all branches. No, tomorrow will not work. Later will not work. Do it right now. Click this link- go.osu.edu/strive Let’s thank the Bob Woodruff Foundation , Boeing and the Navy SEAL Foundation for supporting these programs.\n\nOn 4 June at 1000 local time north of Midway, and with the outcome of the battle in doubt, the Americans had yet to use their best weapon, and at this time their only weapon left, the SBD Dauntless dive bomber in the high-dive delivery for which it was designed. In this vivid and stirring Wade Meyers painting, Skipper Best and wingmen Kroeger and Weber dive on Akagi in a last-ditch effort of a last-gasp attack to put the Japanese Mobile Force - the vaunted Kido Butai - out of action. Ed Heinemann designed the SBD to attack from a 90-degree dive. Richard Best said it was a pure negative g push from 12-14,000 feet, each bomber taking interval on each other with dive brakes extended to make their own runs on the target. A small window in the cockpit floor aided the pilot in determining his pushover point. The gunner had stowed his twin-30's and swiveled forward to call out altitudes during the ~35-second vertical dive to the release point. The painting depicts the moment Best releases his 1,000-pound weapon; Kroeger has already released his. Doctrine was for bombing squadrons like Best's to carry 1,000 pounders while SBD's belonging to the scouting squadrons carried 500-pound bombs on the fuselage station and 100-pound incendiaries on the two wing racks. The fuselage weapon was attached to a mechanism they called a \"yoke\" or \"crutch\" that swung the weapon clear of the prop arc. In the painting it is retracting back up to the fuselage via spring action. The bomb came off in a 70-degree dive, 2,000 feet above the target, and at a constant speed of 240 knots that the dive brakes maintained. Once the bomb comes off, yank (with two hands) on the stick for an unaided 9-g spike to pull off just above the wave tops, retract the dive brakes, and get out of dodge. Oh yes...see those AAA rounds in the painting? SBD's from Enterprise and Yorktown mortally wounded three IJN carriers and later that day bagged a fourth in this epic and world-changing battle that we celebrate this weekend. Throughout the Pacific War, U.S. Navy dive-bombers, flown by determined and courageous pilots and radiomen/gunners, sank more Japanese warship tonnage than surface ships or even submarines.
