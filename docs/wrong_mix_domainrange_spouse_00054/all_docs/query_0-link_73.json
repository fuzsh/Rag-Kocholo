My feet are propped up a little bit on a step-up so I can be positioned around parallel to the floor.‚Å£\n-‚Å£\nYou can use straps. Prop your chest on the bench around sternum. Using your hands as hooks, pull those dumbbells as far back as you can with elbows relatively tucked, squeezing all of your back musculature at the top, control the negative and allow your scapula to flow naturally. Upper back neutral or arched (whichever preferred).‚Å£\n-‚Å£\nPick a weight to hit between 8-12 controlled reps (or 6-15), 2-3 sets, aiming to improve your performance from week to week whilst aiming for perfect technique. Pick a couple other back exercises (maybe 1-2 purely upper back focused and 1-2 purely lat focused), done on the same or a different day, approached with a focus on increasing performance with proper technique  and proper nutrition and recovery, and you‚Äôre on your way to a bigger back.‚Å£\n-‚Å£\n#backtips #backday #backworkout #fitnesstips #bodybuilding #naturalbodybuilding #gymshark #gymsharktrain #ogusdaily\".",
