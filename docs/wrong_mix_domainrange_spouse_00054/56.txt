The couple filed papers under seal last week in Texas to finalize their separation after their marriage dissolved surrounding reports of infidelity by James.

The 45-year-old Oscar-winning actress filed for divorce in April in Austin, Tex., where she has a home, reports People magazine.

According to TMZ.com, Bullock filed for divorce back on April 23, saying the marriage "has become insupportable because of discord or conflict of personalities."

Sources say the divorce clears the way for Bullock to complete a single parent adoption of her 3-month-old son named Louis Bardo Bullock. She and James, 41, had started the adoption process for four years ago, TMZ.com also reports.
