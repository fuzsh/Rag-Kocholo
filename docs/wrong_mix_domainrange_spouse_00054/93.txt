The magazine reports the pair filed papers, which were put under court seal, last week in Texas, and it says those finalized the divorce. The couple is splitting after five years of marriage after James was accused of infidelity.

Bullock, 45, filed for divorce in April in Austin, Texas, where she has a home.
