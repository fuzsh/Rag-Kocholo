Who is Jesse Gregory James’ spouse?

Gregory has dated women from all walks of life, from actresses and tattoo artists to adult film stars. Interestingly, he has been in five marriages, four of which have ended in divorce.

Here is a glimpse of Jesse James’ relationship history and the women he has romantically been involved with.

1. Karla James

The businessman was married to Karla from 1991 to 2002. Together, they have two children: a daughter, Chandler, and a son, Jesse James Jr. According to a 2020 Facebook video by West Coast Choppers, Karla shared how she manages their business’ finances due to Gregory’s spending habits.

I do not let Jesse have as much money as possible because he likes to spend a lot.

The post also revealed that Jesse James’ first wife was living with his family after being diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s and dementia.

2. Janine Lindemulder

Jesse James’ second wife, Janine, is an American adult film star. She exchanged nuptials with him in 2002, but they divorced in 2004.

Lindemulder was seven months pregnant with their daughter, Sunny, when the duo separated. In 2011, after a nasty 2-year legal battle, Gregory was awarded sole custody of the child.

Janine had previously spent six months in prison for tax evasion and was reportedly struggling with drug addiction.

3. Sandra Bullock

Award-winning actress and film producer married James on 16 July 2005 and became the stepmom to Jesse James’ children. As documented by Closer, Sandra once expressed her love for these children during a 2007 interview, saying:

I married into children. My love for them as a co-parent is no less than if I had them biologically. I feel for the children I have in my life, and I would not change that.

However, Jesse James and Sandra Bullock’s marriage only lasted five years. In 2010, several women claimed to have had affairs with the automotive mechanic during his marriage to the Hollywood star.

After this, James publicly apologised to his wife and kids for his behaviour. In a statement to PEOPLE, he said:

I am the only person to blame for this whole situation. For my poor judgement, I deserve everything wrong that comes my way. I am saddened by the pain and embarrassment this has caused my wife and kids. I am truly sorry and hope that one day they will forgive me.

In April 2010, Sandra filed for divorce, and the split was finalised later that summer.

4. Kat Von D

Gregory and Mexican-American tattoo artist Kat Von D began dating in August 2010 and were engaged by January 2011.

In July 2011, she announced an abrupt split, but the duo reunited the following month. Kat officially called the engagement off in September 2011, accusing Gregory of allegedly cheating on her with 19 women, per ABC News.

5. Alexis DeJoria

In March 2013, James married drag racer and daughter of business billionaire John Paul DeJoria. Although they remained married for seven years, the television personality was still involved with multiple other women.

According to Hollywood Life, Jesse announced their split via Instagram in 2020. He wrote:

It is with an incredible amount of sadness that I let you know Alexis, and I have decided to break our marriage.

Jesse James and Alexis DeJoria's divorce was finalised in 2022.

6. Bonnie Rotten

After dating for a year, the businessman entered his fifth marriage with adult star Rotten on 25 June 2022. Nonetheless, their marital bliss was short-lived, as Bonnie accused Gregory of cheating on her while she was pregnant.

On 1 December 2022, she filed for divorce from him, but a day later, she called it off to try to resolve their differences. TMZ reports that although the pair is still together, Jesse James’ wife refiled for divorce on 6 December 2022.

The topic of Jesse Gregory James' spouse has consistently sparked public interest due to his publicised marriages and affairs. The businessman has been in countless relationships and four unsuccessful marriages, all of which ended due to his infidelity.
