        "text": "A Rare Summer Flower\n\nCrested Coralroot Orchid\n\n(Hexalectris spicata)\n\nState-listed as threatened in Ohio, the crested coralroot orchid is truly a treasure to see. Up to 15 intricately decorated blooms appear along 12” tall stems, each up to 1” across.\n\nHikers might not notice these unassuming plants right away, as plants do not have leaves or any other structures that appear above the ground unless they are in flower. And it only blooms when environmental conditions are right, which might not be every year, making it harder to keep track of.\n\nIt is a saprophytic plant, meaning it cannot produce its own food through photosynthesis like other plants. Instead, it has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi in the soil. The fungi grow around the rhizome of the plant and are able to draw out nutrients from other nearby plants to send back to the orchid.\n\nIn Ohio, these plants only occur in a few southern counties. TNC has worked to protect and restore unique habitats that will support biodiversity. These can be found at our Edge of Appalachia Preserve along the Lynx Prairie or Joan Jones Portman Trail."
