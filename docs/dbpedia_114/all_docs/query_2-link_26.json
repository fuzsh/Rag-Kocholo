These resources work to ensure older adults are supported to remain independent as they age.\n\nEast Valley Senior Home Sharing Program\n\nSenior Home Sharing connects pairs of older adults to share living space and expenses. We conduct an intensive assessment and on-boarding with applicants including background checks and verification of finances for your safety and security.

We also offer a full array of wrap-around supports including access to benefits, financial assistance, transportation resources and other ongoing resources.
