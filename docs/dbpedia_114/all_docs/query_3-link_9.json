        "text": "What is a meadow?\n\nMost dictionary definitions of a meadow agree that it is an open tract of land dominated by grass. Meadows at Crater Lake National Park elevate that definition. They can be wet, dry, and somewhere in between with grasses, sedges, and wildflowers or any combination thereof. The most prominent meadow in the park is the Pumice Desert along the North Entrance Park Road.\n\nMeadows and wetlands represent a small portion of the park’s landscape but these open habitats are hotspots of plant and animal diversity. And needless to say, meadows contribute to the overwhelming beauty that makes Crater Lake National Park a treasured place.\n\nDry Subalpine Meadows\n\nNear the caldera rim, and along high peaks and cinder cones, dry subalpine meadows of pumice and ashy volcanic sand support grand vistas of Crater Lake and the nearby Cascadian peaks. Across these meadows grow diminutive plants that have adaptations similar to desert species. The plants resilient enough to survive here are often very short with thick, waxy leaves, and a dense covering of hairs to deflect intense sunlight.\n\nAround the caldera rim, there is one meadow plant that signals the beginning and end of the short summer season at Crater Lake National Park. Fleeceflower (Aconogonon davisiae var. davisiae) emerges from the snow as bright green, but then turns a brilliant red as the days begin to shorten in the middle of summer. Eventually it dries a strawberry color and blows around the pumice meadows, collecting in low points and drainages.\n\nGrasses and Sedges\n\nDrier grass and sedge-dominated meadows are found near Crater Peak, Sun Notch, and Rim Village. Sedges appear similar to grasses, but often have triangular stems while grasses have hollow, round stems. These expansive tree-less areas display an array of green and gold shades depending on the sun, rain, and the onset of snow.\n\nWildflowers such as Anderson’s lupine (Lupinus andersonii)(topp photo), and Cascade aster (Eucephalus ledophyllus) add highlights of color. Grass- and sedge-dominated meadows provide forage and habitat for many wildlife species.\n\nWet Meadows\n\nAt lower elevations and near streams, lush wet meadows provide ideal habitats for many species of birds, mammals, amphibians, and invertebrates, many of which are not found in higher elevations and around the lake. Colorful wildflower displays line the banks of creeks, and surround open pools and springs. Abundant tracks indicate that elk and deer frequent these meadows.\n\nThe summer months are often warm and dry. Wet meadows and wetlands, while subject to seasonal drying, often serve as water sources for wildlife.These meadows are oases of diversity in a sea of coniferous forest.\n\nDiverse Yet Fragile\n\nThese diverse habitats are also very fragile. With short growing seasons, some require hundreds of years to develop enough nutrients to feed future generations of plants. Others need every advantage to grow and re-seed across the meadow in three or four months.\n\nProtect Crater Lake’s meadows by staying on designated trails and walkways. Avoid trampling the wildflowers, grasses, sedges, and other fragile meadow plants.\n\nMeadows are beautiful to photograph.

This NPS checklist utilizes the nationwide USDA Plants Database. Crater Lake botanists use Oregon Flora as their source for taxonomy, which includes species specific to the park and state.\n\nSpecies Attribute Definitions\n\nDefinitions\n\nOccurrence\n\nOccurrence values are defined below. One or more Occurrence Tags may be associated with each Occurrence value.\n\nPresent: Species occurs in park; current, reliable evidence available.\n\nProbably Present: High confidence species occurs in park but current, verified evidence needed.\n\nUnconfirmed: Species is attributed to park but evidence is weak or absent.\n\nNot In Park: Species is not known to occur in park.\n\nOccurrence Tags\n\nAdjacent: Species is known to occur in areas near to or contiguous with park boundaries.\n\nFalse Report: Species was reported to occur within the park, but current evidence indicates the report was based on misidentification, a taxonomic concept no longer accepted, or other similar problem of error or interpretation.\n\nHistorical: Species' historical occurrence in park is documented. Assigned based on judgment as opposed to determination based on age of the most recent evidence.\n\nAbundance\n\nAbundant:\n\nAnimals: May be seen daily, in suitable habitat and season, and counted in relatively large numbers.\n\nPlants: Large number of individuals; wide ecological amplitude or occurring in habitats covering a large portion of the park.\n\nCommon:\n\nAnimals: May be seen daily, in suitable habitat and season, but not in large numbers.\n\nPlants: Large numbers of individuals predictably occurring in commonly encountered habitats but not those covering a large portion of the park.\n\nUncommon:\n\nAnimals: Likely to be seen monthly in appropriate habitat and season. May be locally common.\n\nPlants: Few to moderate numbers of individuals; occurring either sporadically in commonly encountered habitats or in uncommon habitats.\n\nRare:\n\nAnimals: Present, but usually seen only a few times each year.\n\nPlants: Few individuals, usually restricted to small areas of rare habitat.\n\nOccasional:\n\nAnimals: Occurs in the park at least once every few years, varying in numbers, but not necessarily every year.\n\nPlants: Abundance variable from year to year (e.g., desert plants).\n\nUnknown: Abundance unknown\n\nNativeness\n\nNative: Species naturally occurs in park or region.\n\nNon-native: Species occurs on park lands as a result of deliberate or accidental human activities.\n\nUnknown: Nativeness status is unknown or ambiguous.\n\nList Differences\n\nThe Checklist contains only those species that are designated as \"present\" or \"probably present\" in the park.\n\nThe Full List includes all the checklist species in addition to species that are unconfirmed, historically detected, or incorrectly reported as being found in the park. The full list also contains species that are \"in review\" because their status in the park hasn't been fully determined. Additional details about the status of each species is included in the full list.\n\nThe checklist will almost always contain fewer species than the full list.\n\nSelect a Park:\n\nSelect a Species Category (optional):\n\nSpecies attribute definitions\n\nSearch results will be displayed here.\n\nVisit NPSpecies for more comprehensive information and advanced search capability.
