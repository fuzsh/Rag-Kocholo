        "text": "Amur Maple\n\nAcer ginnala\n\nH: 15'\n\nW: 8'\n\nZone: 3\n\nHardy maple grown as a small tree or large shrub. Striking orange to scarlet fall colour for two to three weeks. Full sun will give this tree it's best fall colour but it can tolerate part shade. Produces pinkish winged samaras (helicopter seeds) in late summer. There are a few named varieties on the market now, we typically have the regular species variety and/or Ruby Slippers Amur Maple which has reliably pink showy samaras.\n\nAutumn Blaze Maple\n\nAcer x freemanii 'Jeffersred'\n\nH: 30'\n\nW: 15'\n\nZone: 3b\n\nAutumn Blaze Maple is a hybrid of the Red Maple (Acer rubrum) and Silver Maple (Acer saccharinum). It was selected for it's superior shape and hardiness. It is right on the edge of hardiness in our Zone 3 Edmonton climate, but typically within the city it has been thriving quite nicely. Many home owners over the last decade have been rewarded by taking a chance on it, but if we get a particularly harsh winter it can have a little bit of tip die back on the previous year's growth. The fall foliage is stunning as it turns red in late September against the Silver Bark.\n\nColumnar Norway Maple\n\nAcer platanoides 'Columnare'\n\nH: 25'\n\nW: 10'\n\nZone 4\n\nColumnar Norway Maple is an narrow, upright selection of the species that offers a very unique look for such a Northern climate like Edmonton. It offers large lush green leaves throughout the Summer and in the Fall it turns a golden colour. It can sometimes be hard to find but if you are looking at trying something different this is a fun option to try. It is considered a borderline hardy tree for our climate, but as this photo shows it can be grown here in Edmonton. This picture was taken in North Edmonton in the neighbourhood of Bergman.\n\nCrimson Sentry Norway Maple\n\nAcer platanoides 'Crimson Sentry'\n\nH: 15'\n\nW: 4'\n\nZone 4\n\nCrimson Sentry is a columnar maple with purple foliage throughout the Spring and Summer, followed by a brighter red in the Fall. Prefers good drainage and benefits from protection from wind (sheltered location). VERY SLOW growing in our climate but that helps to keep it compact. Some tip die-back from winter is relatively common for this variety in Alberta. Generally not recommended for open exposure in rural areas, does better within the protection of the city.\n\nThis picture was taken in the area of Beverly in Edmonton.\n\nPrairie Splendor Norway Maple\n\nAcer platanoides 'Prairie Splendor'\n\nH: 33'\n\nW: 26'\n\nZone 4\n\nPrairie Splendor Maple is a broad, oval shaped tree that has bright maroon foliage throughout the growing season. It was originally found in a mature neighbourhood in Lethbridge, Alberta and selected due to it's superior hardiness. Just like a lot of the Maples that can be grown in Alberta they are susceptible to a little bit of die back on the branch tips, but it is quite the stunning tree once established.\n\nThis picture was taken in the neighbourhood of Goldbar in Edmonton.\n\n​Red RocketMaple\n\nAcer rubrum 'Red Rocket'\n\nH: 30'\n\nW: 10'\n\nZone 4\n\nA new rising favorite in the Maple family that is showing excellent hardiness for a red maple. The red fall colour is vibrant and the upright growth habit makes it ideal for the modern small yard. It may have slight tip die back on some years but it rebounds nicely with new growth. Due to this being a newer cultivar, it is very hard to find available at most Nurseries particularly in larger sizes.\n\nThis picture was taken in North Edmonton.\n\nSugar Maple\n\nAcer saccarum\n\nH: 35'\n\nW: 20'\n\nZone: 3 / 3b\n\nNot all Sugar Maples are hardy for our climate but they are beautiful large trees that are starting to be planted successfully here due to our warming climate and new hardy varieties being developed. Oval form and soil adaptable. Benefits from some shelter/wind protection. Produces large glossy green leaves that turn shades of red to orange to yellow (often al at the same time) in Fall.\n\nHot Wings & Rugged Charm Tatarian Maple\n\nAcer tatarica 'GarAnn' & 'Rugged Charm'\n\nH: 18'\n\nW: 12'\n\nZone: 3\n\nThis is the hardiest species of all the maples. The Tatarian Maples have showy red samaras appearing mid-summer. The fall foliage can range from yellow, to orange and red depending on site conditions and the cultivar chosen. It is a small to medium sized tree that is very hardy for the prairies. A good choice for smaller yards.\n\nOhio Buckeye\n\nAesculus glabra\n\nH: 20'\n\nW: 12'\n\nZone: 3\n\nThis is one of the most exotic looking trees that can be reliably grown in Edmonton. It has beautiful creamy yellow flowers in spring followed by prickly nut-like fruit which form during the summer. It has stunning orange to red (depending on genes of individual) fall colour that make it really stand out. The palmate leaves make it a choice like no other for our climate. The corky bark that forms as it ages make it a true four season tree that can be enjoyed year round. If you want the look of the Horse Chestnut but want something more reliable or smaller this is a good choice.\n\nHorse Chestnut\n\nAesculus hippocastanum\n\nH: 35'\n\nW: 20'\n\nZone: 3/4\n\nThe Horse Chestnut is one of those truly rare trees in Edmonton but can be found if you are looking for it. Most of the original trees were planted by European immigrants who brought seeds back from their home countries at some point. Nurseries are trying to grow more of these trees in recent years but it is a long process from seed and hardy genetics are a key component for survival in our climate. It is a massive shade tree when it reaches it's full potential but it takes a long time with our shorter growing seasons. Availability is extremely limited.\n\nThis picture was taken from a beautiful specimen in the neighbourhood of Rundle Heights in Edmonton.\n\nPaper Birch\n\nBetula papyrifera species (including Chickadee)\n\nH: 30'\n\nW: 15' - 20'\n\nZone: 2\n\nThis is an extremely hardy birch native to Alberta with attractive peeling white bark adding interest even in the winter. It prefers moist, but well drained soil. The golden fall colour is really beautiful for two to three weeks each year. Shallow root system does not compete with turf grass so it is best to give it a large tree-well or plant in a shrub bed with other selections. As with any birch, this tree can be susceptible to birch-leaf miner.\n\nChickadee Paper Birch is a more upright (H: 30' x W: 12') variety that was originally selected from native Paper Birch in Northern Alberta.\n\nCutleaf Weeping Birch\n\nBetula pendula laciniata\n\nH: 40'\n\nW: 20'\n\nZone: 2\n\nA large birch with graceful weeping branches. The small cutleaf leaves give this tree an elegant look. It is fast growing and hardy and does require more water than the average tree once it is mature. It is one of the few weeping trees that can be grown in Edmonton. Shallow root system does not compete with turf grass so it is best to give it a large tree-well or plant in a shrub bed with other selections.As with any birch, this tree can be susceptible to birch-leaf miner.\n\nYoung's Weeping Birch\n\nBetula pendula 'Youngii'\n\nH: up to 10'\n\nW: up to 8\"\n\nZone: 3\n\nA smaller birch with weeping branches and interesting irregular habit. Size and shape will somewhat depend on pruning and shaping and height at which it was grafted. It can be used as a unique specimen tree for a small yard. The leaves often hang on through the winter giving it appeal throughout the cold months here in Edmonton. As with any birch, this tree can be susceptible to birch-leaf miner.\n\nDakota Pinnacle Birch\n\nBetula platyphylla 'Fargo'\n\nH: 25'\n\nW: 12'\n\n​Zone: 3\n\nA newer columnar form of Asian birch with glossy green leaves. It is very hardy and fast growing. This tree offers a dense screen that can be used as a privacy barrier. Tends to hold its leaves frozen on through the winter giving it both winter interest and privacy for a longer period of time throughout the year. Consistant moisture but with good drainage is essential for this variety. As with any birch, this tree can be susceptible to birch-leaf miner.\n\nTop-Grafted Weeping Caragana\n\nCaragana arborescens pendula\n\nH: 4' - 5' (as grafted)\n\nW: 4'\n\nZone: 3\n\nDrought & heat tolerant top-grafted caragana. Height determined by height of graft, which is usually at 4 feet. It has a weeping habit and as it ages it becomes living art with it's gnarled branches. Good drainage is ESSENTIAL for this variety, it will not tolerate standing water or soggy soils.\n\nTop-Grafted Walker's Weeping Caragana\n\nCaragana arborescens 'Walker'\n\nH: 4' - 5' (as grafted)\n\nW: 3'\n\nZone: 3\n\nFiner leaved variety of weeping caragana. Generally stays a little narrower than regular weeping caragana. Drought & heat tolerant top-grafted caragana. Height determined by height of graft, which is usually at 4 feet. It has a weeping habit and as it ages it becomes living art with it's gnarled branches. Good drainage is ESSENTIAL for this variety, it will not tolerate standing water or soggy soils.\n\nToba Hawthorn\n\nCrataegus mordensis 'Toba'\n\nH: 15'\n\nW: 10'\n\nZone: 3\n\nThis variety of Hawthorn has slightly more orange looking bark and is somewhat smaller than Snowbird. Clusters of rosette shaped flowers emerge bright white in spring for a week or so, then fade to dusty pink over the course of a couple of weeks. Vase-like form and the trunk bark becomes uniquely twisted as it ages. Considered thornless although they have been known to produce the odd thorn here and there.\n\nRussian Olive\n\nEleagnus angustifolia\n\nH: 35'\n\nW: 20'\n\n​Zone: 3\n\nThis is a very unique tree, that offers great contrast with its long, narrow silver leaves. A dark gray bark provides winter interest and the leaves hang on well into November. It is very drought tolerant once established. One of the few trees in Edmonton that offer a true silver leaf. It does have strong 3 inch thorns throughout the tree so buyer beware. Requires good drainage and prefers poor sandy soils. Exposure is not a problem for this tree so it is great for windy slopes that are hard to keep watered. Prone to suckers.\n\n​White Ash\n\nFraxinus americana ('Nobility' 'Tuxedo' 'Calypso')\n\nH: 30'\n\nW: 20'\n\nZone: 4\n\nWhite Ash has typically been a Zone 4 tree but there has been some recent success in cold hardy breeding within this species. There are three cultivars that look very promising for our Zone 3 climate which are listed above. We happen to think 'Nobility' is the best one available to date. They offer an exotic looking compound leaf while providing tremendous fall colour. It can be used as a street tree or a specimen in your yard. The leaves are green throughout the growing season followed by two weeks of spectacular colour which can be seen in the picture to the left. Prefers slightly moist conditions.\n\nGreen Ash\n\nFraxinus pennsylvanica ('Prairie Spire', 'Patmore', 'Foothills', 'Trojan')\n\nH: 40' - 50' (depending on variety)\n\nW: 15' - 30' Wide (depending on variety)\n\nZone: 3\n\nGreen Ash has been one of the most commonly planted trees on the prairies for decades. It offers a large shade tree that is resistant to urban pollution and is cold hardy. There are many cultivars that have been introduced over the years. The four listed above are what Sunstar Nurseries currently grows and what we feel do the best in the Edmonton area. They all differ a little in shape and size but they are all male selections which means no messy seed. This is one of Edmonton's most commonly planted street trees along with American Elm.\n\nTree Form Hydrangea - - In Variety\n\nHydrangea (paniculata, arborescens)\n\nH: up to 8' (as trained)\n\nW: 3' - 6' (variety dependant)\n\nZone 3 (varieties we carry)\n\nFull Sun to Part Shade. Will tolerate full shade but will produce more flowers in sun. Tree form hydrangeas are showstoppers. Can be a grafted shrub but are more often simply shrubs pruned into small trees. Flower shape, size and colour depend on the variety but are generally some combination of white to pink. Benefits from permanent staking and a sheltered location as the flowers can make the tree top heavy. Will not tolerate high heat or dry soils but does well in full sun if not too hot on the roots (beside concrete, mulched with rock or in hot dry soils). Prefer free-draining, fertile soils with consistent moisture. Will wilt quickly if dry/stressed but usually rebounds once watered. Winter tip kill is very common but hydrangeas bloom best on new wood so a hard prune in spring is just the ticket for abundant showy blooms in late summer to early fall.\n\nButternut\n\nJuglans cinerea\n\nH: 30'\n\nW: 20'\n\nZone: 3b\n\nA shade tree of medium to large height. It tends to have a wide spread on it, but offers an exotic leaf that is second to none. This is a collectors tree in the Edmonton area, in that it is not very common to find. It has large sticky nuts which drop in the fall that can create some work for fall cleanup.\n\nWeeping Larch\n\nLarix decidua pendula\n\nH: As Staked or Grafted\n\nW: 4' to 6' (adaptable)\n\nZone: 3\n\nLarch are a unique species in that they are deciduous conifers. This means that they have soft needles but unlike most evergreens they turn gold and drop each year in fall. This is a particularly interesting cultivar in that it is grafted or staked at a determined height and then proceeds to weep from that point on. Good drainage required. An excellent accent plant for any landscape. The Weeping Larch will go as high as you stake them, but most plants are typically weeping at the 5-7' high point.\n\nRosthern Flowering Crab\n\nMalus baccatta 'Rosthern'\n\nH: 20'\n\nW: 10'\n\nZone: 2\n\nRosthern Flowering Crab is a White flowering crab which has an upright, columnar growth habit with green leaves. It is a perfect tree for spaces that are restricted by width. It is a beautiful tree that is extremely hardy. It is a selection of Siberian flowering crab which means it offers tiny orange/red berry like fruit that hangs on through the Winter months and look spectacular against the snow. Despite bearing fruit it is not considered a terribly messy tree because it is small fruit and the birds eat much of it off in the Winter months. A nice hardy tree for the prairies.\n\nRoyal Beauty Weeping Flowering Crab\n\nMalus 'Royal Beauty'\n\nH: as grafted\n\nW: up to 6'\n\nZone 2\n\nSmall weeping form with dark purple foliage and nice dark pink blossoms in the Spring for 2-3 weeks followed by small hard ornamental fruit. This is a nice specimen tree for small areas, or for overhanging walls and other features. Place it in the foreground of your landscape so that it is not overpowered by larger, more aggressive plants. Widens with age. It is fairly slow growing but like many Flowering crabs they are long lived. Have some patience with this tree and you will be rewarded over time.\n\nSpring Snow Flowering Crab\n\nMalus 'Spring Snow'\n\nH: 20'\n\nW: 10'\n\nZone: 3\n\nSpring Snow flowering crab is a truly spectacular tree. It has all the features that the modern home owner is after. This tree offers a spectacular white blossoms in the Spring for 2-3 weeks, a near perfect shape with very little pruning, and best of all no messy fruit to clean up. That's right, this is the first sterile flowering crab so there it will never produce any fruit. Throughout the Summer months it is a nice rounded shape with lush green foliage that offers some shade while not over taking your yard. This is one of the best selling trees of the last 10 years for a reason.\n\nThunderchild Flowering Crab\n\nMalus 'Thunderchild'\n\nH: 18'\n\nW: 12'\n\nZone: 2\n\nThunderchild Flowering crab is a true classic in the ornamental tree industry. It has stood the test of time with it's breathtaking pink blossoms every Spring. This cultivar offers more of an upright umbrella shape with it's arching branches. Reddish-purple foliage and abundant pink blooms in spring. Fall foliage is a bronze-red colour. Like most Flowering crabs, there is dime size fruit that forms but the little bit of fruit that will drop is worth all the other features this tree has to offer. It is considered a fairly small tree so it will work in a lot of spaces. Selected for its resistance to fireblight.\n\nPurple Spire Flowering Crab\n\nMalus x 'Jefspire'\n\nH: 18'\n\nW: 6'\n\nZone: 3\n\nA very narrow flowering crab with purple leaves, and pink flowers followed by small fruit. This extremely narrow variety is great for a small yard or in mass plantings. It is generally grown branched down to the very base of the tree. Purple Spires is the new and improved version of Dreamweaver and will slowly replace it over time in the industry. This is a great new tree that is sure to be a mainstay on the prairies. These pictures are of specimens found in Edmonton and also growing in our field at the nursery.\n\nEmerald Spire Flowering Crab\n\nMalus x 'Jefgreen'\n\nH: 18'\n\nW: 6' - 7'\n\nZone: 3\n\nClosely related to Purple Spire Crab, producing identical flowers and fruit but with bronze-green foliage and is slightly wider at maturity. This is another great alternative for smaller yards and it offers a little more interesting look than most. Good longer-lived alternative to Swedish Aspen growing at a good rate of 12-15\" per year. While fruit is small and considered ornamental, they have good tart flavour and would make good jelly or preserves.\n\nTower Poplar\n\nPopulus x canescens 'Tower'\n\nH: 45'\n\nW: 10'\n\nZone: 3\n\nA fast growing and hardy, narrow tree that is used as a vertical accent or to provide shade or privacy in a row as a very tall screen. It is wider and has a more open form than the Swedish Columnar Aspen. Prone to suckering and susceptible to Poplar Borer.\n\nSwedish Aspen\n\nPopulus tremula 'Erecta'\n\nH: 40'+\n\nW: 6'\n\nZone: 3\n\nThis is the most popular columnar tree of the last 20 years in Edmonton. Commonly used as a fast growing privacy screen between neighbours or a vertical accent. Perfect for people who don't like to be patient with their trees. Prone to suckering and susceptible to Poplar Borer\n\nTrembling/Quaking Aspen\n\nPopulus tremuloides\n\nH: 40'\n\nW: 15'\n\nZone: 2\n\nIn Alberta, this is one of the most common trees you will find when walking through any of our Native forests. It is one of the hardiest, most prolific trees around. It is known for it's beautiful white bark (not to be confused with Paper Birch). In the last ten years it is being used extensively in the urban forest, whereas in the past it was seldom planted outside of reclamation projects. It is a beautiful green throughout the season followed by a spectacular gold in the Fall. The long stems of the leaves cause the foliage to \"quake\" or \"tremble\" audibly at the slightest breeze giving this poplar its name.\n\nPrairie Skyrise Aspen\n\nPopulus tremuloides 'Prairie Skyrise'\n\nH: 40'\n\nW: 10'\n\nZone: 2\n\nThis is a newer selection of the common native tree; Trembling Aspen. It was selected for its narrow, dense and upright shape. Another fantastic feature of this tree is the contrast of the shades of green that the new growth offers in comparison to the old growth. It is bright green on top of a darker shade of green and it's one more aspect that can be appreciated. This tree is best used as a specimen tree in a narrow setting in the modern front yard, or as a privacy screen to block neighbours or other unwanted views.\n\nHybrid Poplars (Assiniboine, Northwest, Sundancer)\n\nPopulus x Hybrid\n\nH: 40' - 50'\n\nW: 10' - 30' (dependant on variety)\n\nZone: 2\n\nThese are male hybrid Poplars which produce none of the Poplar fluff that female poplars would. They grow in a variety of soil conditions and dry/wet areas. Good for large yards or on acreages and will form a large shade tree in a shorter time period than any other species. This is common choice for a dependable shelterbelt or screen. Sundancer is a newer, more disease resistant cultivar with a more upright narrow (10') branching habit.\n\nMing Amur Cherry\n\nPrunus maackii 'Ming'\n\nH: 20'\n\nW: 10'\n\nZone: 3\n\nAn Amur Cherry hybrid with reddish bronze shiny bark which adds interest year round. Maintains a vigorous upright habit and is resistant to splitting and frost cracking. Produces panicles of small white flowers in spring followed by small black fruit enjoyed by birds. This tree is gaining in popularity due to its improvements, unique bark colour and vigor/growth rate despite its manageable size at maturity.\n\nPrincess Kay Plum\n\nPrunus nigra 'Princess Kay'\n\nH: 16'\n\nW: 10'\n\nZone: 3\n\nA compact, smaller accent tree with double white fragrant flowers early in the spring (Before leaves). A silver bark adds interest in the winter. It also happens to have one of the most spectacular fall colour displays with a red, orange and yellow explosion each September. On top of it all, it bears no fruit so it is not messy.\n\nMuckle Plum\n\nPrunus x nigrella 'Muckle'\n\nH: 10'\n\nW: 8'\n\nZone: 3\n\nA showy and petite feature tree great for small yards and spaces. Vibrant pink single blooms cover the tree in very early spring (before leaves emerge). Flowers are followed by nice green foliage for the rest of the season. Produces no fruit! Full Sun and good drainage are important for this species. Small and easy to maintain.\n\nMay Day Tree\n\nPrunus padus\n\nH: 30'\n\nW: 25'\n\nZone: 3\n\nA tried and true variety that is one of the first to leaf out in the spring. Beautiful white flowers in May are extremely fragrant and cover the entire tree. It forms small purple fruit that attracts birds. This is a fast growing tree that is very hardy. It has yellow fall colour. Maydays are susceptible to BLACK KNOT.\n\nMidnight Schubert Chokecherry\n\nPrunus virginiana 'Midnight Schubert'\n\nH: 20'\n\nW: 15'\n\nZone: 3\n\nMidnight is a superior chokecherry selection when compared to Bailey's Select. It has a larger, more ornamental leaf and it suckers less. It is an accent tree with green leaves turning a dark purple in late Spring. Produces panicles of small white fragrant flowers in spring followed by small black edible fruit that are loved by birds. Fruit can be used for jams or jellies. This is a fast growing tree and one of the few trees that offer Red/Purple leaves during the summer. Like all Schubert Chokecherries, Midnight is susceptible to BLACK KNOT.\n\n​Navigator Ornamental Pear\n\nPyrus 'DurPSN303'\n\nH: 25'\n\nW: 12'\n\nZone: 2\n\nVery hardy with reliably upright growth habit. Great for boulevards or when a higher headed but still ornamental tree is needed. Produces abundant white blooms in spring followed by shiny green foliage. While used ornamentally, this pear will bear fruit if a pollinator (another pear of any variety) is present/in the area. Fruit is green and about golf ball size and is edible although not the best quality for eating fresh.\n\nBurr Oak\n\nQuercus macrocarpa\n\nH: 40'\n\nW: 25'\n\nZone: 3\n\nThe hardiest of all the oaks, this tree is stunning! Beautiful dark glossy green oak leaves and corky bark make this the mother of all shade trees for Northern Alberta. This tree has a slow-average growth rate (speeding up once established) and can live for hundreds of years. Great as a memorial tree. Will produce small acorns as the tree matures. The Fall colour is a brownish gold\n\nColumnar Oaks (Regal Prince, Kindred Spirit)\n\nQuercus robur x bicolor 'Long' & 'Nadler'\n\nH: 30'\n\nW: 6' - 8'\n\nZone: 3b\n\nNarrow/columnar in growth habit. A good accent or screening tree for smaller yards. Beautiful dark green leaves with silver underneath which turn yellow in the fall. This tree becomes more oval as it matures. It leafs out in late Spring. Can be hard to find sometimes. Slow growing (part of what keeps it compact) and long lived. Kindred Spirit is the narrower selection.\n\nLaurel Leaf Willow\n\nSalix pentandra\n\nH: 40'\n\nW: 20'\n\nZone: 2\n\nA very fast growing willow with very dark green glossy leaves. A more rounded willow tree that is known for its 'tough' foliage that stays on late into the season. It is easy to grow and adaptable to a wide range of soils. It can be used as a large single specimen shade tree or even as a multi-stem tree in a shelterbelt application. Like most willows it leafs out early and holds it's leaves very late in the year. It has a tendency to self prune smaller interior branches in wind storms.\n\nPyramidal Mountain Ash\n\nSorbus aucuparia 'Fastigiata'\n\nH: 20'\n\nW: 7'\n\nZone: 3\n\nVery slow growing ornamental or specimen tree. Clusters of small white flowers followed by orange red ornamental berries. Berries hold on into winter providing winter interest as well as food for birds (loved by cedar & bohemian waxwings). Orange and red fall foliage colour. This is a very narrow variety with dainty narrow green foliage. It prefers full sun and very good drainage is essential. Good as a screening tree if the slow growth rate can be tolerated.\n\nShowy Mountain Ash\n\nSorbus decora\n\nH: 15' - 20'\n\nW: 10'\n\nZone: 3\n\nA hardy, slow growing ornamental tree. This variety has a nice uniform round shape. After the attractive white blossoms fade in the Spring the red-orange fruit forms and hangs on through the Fall and Winter for extra interest through those cold prairie winters. It is native to many parts of North America. The dark green leaves turn red and orange in the fall. Good drainage is essential for any Mountain Ash.\n\nOak Leaf Mountain Ash\n\nSorbus hybrida\n\nH: 20'\n\nW: 15'\n\nZone: 3b\n\nThis is an upright oval tree with ascending branches. This species has very nice Oak shaped leaves which make it very unique and unlike any of the other Mountain Ashes. The white clusters of flowers are followed by clusters of orange-red berries in the fall. This is a cross between European and Swedish Mountain Ash. Good drainage is essential for any Mountain Ash.\n\nDwarf Korean Lilac- Top Graft\n\nSyringa meyeri 'Palibin' T.G\n\nH: 8' - 10'\n\nW: 4' - 5'\n\nZone: 3\n\nA beautiful dense top-grafted shrub with lots of fragrant purple lilac flowers in the spring and small dainty dark green leaves. It is easy to keep trimmed and maintained. The one thing to remember when pruning any Lilac is to prune immediately after they finish blooming. By doing this you will ensure enough time for the plant to set flower buds for the following season. This is a very good choice for small yards and is typically used as an individual specimen for contrast. Cold hardy and easy to grow.\n\nJapanese Tree Lilac (Ivory Silk, Ivory Pillar, Signature, Snowdance)\n\nSyringa reticulata\n\nH: 18' - 20'\n\nW: 8' - 10'\n\nZone: 3\n\nThe Japanese tree lilac has become one of the most beloved trees in the Edmonton area. With it's tidy growth habit, beautiful late Spring blossoms, and the fact that it produces no fruit, it makes an attractive option for the modern home. It is considered a small tree and is relatively slow growing (part of what keeps it so compact). Disease and insect resistant. It also has a nice purplish fall colour with hints of yellow in it. A must for any yard!\n\nAmerican Lindens (Redmond & True North)\n\nTilia americana 'Redmond', 'True North'\n\nH: 30' - 35'\n\nW: 15' - 20'\n\nZone: 3\n\nLarge, stately shade trees with a broadly pyramidal shape. They have large, heart shaped leaves which are very attractive. Produces fragrant, small yellow flowers which appear in late spring. American Lindens are great for creating shade in a large yard, or they can be used in parks and boulevards. They are long lived and give a nice option that is less common than some of the other large shade trees.\n\nLittleleaf Lindens (Lone Star & Greenspire)\n\nTilia cordata 'Byskinner' & 'Greenspire'\n\nH: 30' - 35'\n\nW: 15' - 20'\n\nZone: 3\n\nLittle leaf Lindens have really taken off in the last decade in Edmonton.
