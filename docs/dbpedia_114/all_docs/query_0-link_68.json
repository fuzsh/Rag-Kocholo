While comprehensive sources on the North American fauna, such as Spencer (1969, 1987) and Spencer and Steyskal (1986b), already discuss these topics, important studies and discoveries have appeared since the time of those publications and it is necessary to provide updates.\n\nScope of the present study\n\nAt higher taxonomic levels, the present work examines those subfamilies and genera occurring in Canada and the continental United States (that is, the Nearctic Region north of Mexico), providing diagnoses and brief discussions on their relationships, classification, life history and diversity. To facilitate generic identification, an identification key is provided, accompanied by illustrations of the highly informative and diagnostic male genitalia, and photographs of live and preserved specimens. Discussions include the results of recent revisionary and phylogenetic studies, including redefinitions of Liriomyza Mik (Lonsdale 2011, 2017), Phytomyza Fallén (Winkler et al. 2009), Nemorimyza Frey (Zlobin 1996) and members of the Ophiomyia genus group (Lonsdale 2014), among others.\n\nThe economic importance of the family was overviewed by Spencer (1973). An update on many of the most agriculturally significant species, including their hosts and methods of control, is currently being prepared (Lonsdale et al., in manuscript) and need not be discussed here.\n\nAt the species level, this mostly collection-based study revises the fauna of the “Delmarva” states (discussed below), and is intended as a regional snapshot of the family. It will contribute to a more accurate understanding of the group when used alongside other comprehensive regional works such Griffiths’ series on the boreal Phytomyza, Lonsdale and Scheffer’s (2011) revision of the Nearctic holly leaf miners, Boucher’s Nearctic revisions (2002, 2004, 2008), Frick’s (1956)Calycomyza Hendel revision, Lonsdale’s (2011, 2017) Liriomyza revisions, Shi and Gaimari’s (2015) revision of the Californian Melanagromyza Hendel, the primarily northeastern United States surveys of Eiseman et al. (2018–2021), the catalogues compiled by Frick (1952a, 1959, 1965), and of course, Spencer (1969) and Spencer and Steyskal (1986b). The latter two works revised all Agromyzidae known to occur in Canada and Alaska, and the lower continental United States, respectively, and have served as two of the most useful stand-alone resources for the family but need updating.\n\nMore broadly, the author hopes that this manual will generate more interest in this relatively difficult and neglected family in North America and facilitate easier identifications, thereby encouraging collectors to gather more field data, preserve more specimens, and explore parts of North America where agromyzids are largely unknown and undescribed. This is an exciting prospect considering that relatively little is known of the North American Agromyzidae outside of California and the northeast, and even in these regions, many new discoveries continue to accumulate. Furthermore, while the morphology of most species in the family can indeed often be accurately characterised as small, somewhat monotonous in appearance (at least externally) and sometimes difficult to work with, it is hoped that the photographs and illustrations given here portray the hidden charm of these animals, especially when considering the often striking and elaborate male genitalia.\n\nThe “Delmarva” States\n\nThe name “Delmarva”, as used here, is an older collective term referring to the District of Columbia and the surrounding states of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia (Figs , ). Its modern usage is restricted to the Delmarva Peninsula, flanked by the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays. Defining characteristics of these states (and District), including geography, are discussed in Mathis and Foster (2007) and Murphy et al. (2018). These authors also provide interesting historical context, including background on a series of papers examining the dipteran fauna of the greater Washington, D.C. area that eventually became treatments of individual families in the Delmarva states. The present work is a continuation of this series.\n\nAgromyzidae of the Delmarva states\n\nAll species of Agromyzidae verified as being present in the Delmarva states are here keyed, described and illustrated. It is likely that the fauna of the region is much larger than represented however, if one extrapolates the known distribution of other northeastern species and their host plants, and considers the likelihood of there being many more species new to science yet to be discovered. Recent publications have illustrated that undescribed taxa are still in abundance in the northeast despite the long history of research there. Future discoveries will also certainly include taxa previously known from more distant localities that represent either recent introductions of invasive species, or previously unknown populations of more widely distributed species. These assumptions are supported by comparison to the more diverse and recently revised fauna of Hungary, initiated by Papp and Černý (2016), although unlike here, that work includes unconfirmed species predicted to be in the country. Hungary is slightly more northern in position compared to the Delmarva states and slightly smaller in size (ca. 93,030 km2, versus 99,420 km2). Since this work excludes species not yet known to occur in the region, reference to the broader Nearctic treatments of Spencer (1969) and Spencer and Steyskal (1986b) is suggested in case an identification is uncertain; reference to host plant catalogues (such as Spencer 1990 and Benavent-Corai et al. 2005) and non-Nearctic taxonomic treatments is also recommended.\n\nIn total, this study presents 346 new state and provincial records and 23 new country records, including species previously known only from Europe, Canada, and the western or southern United States.\n\nFifteen species are newly described: Agromyzaechinalis sp. nov., Melanagromyzabrunkei sp. nov., M.eoflacensis sp. nov., M.glyptos sp. nov., M.rutella sp. nov., Ophiomyiacapitolia sp. nov., O.cuprea sp. nov., O.galiodes sp. nov., O.heleios sp. nov., O.kalia sp. nov., O.laticolis sp. nov., Cerodontha (Poemyza) ungula sp. nov., Phytomyzaavicursa sp. nov., P.catenula sp. nov., P.winkleri sp. nov.\n\nFour new species-level synonyms and one genus-level synonym are provided: Agromyzamarmorensis Spencer syn. nov. is included as a synonym of A.aristata Malloch; Melanagromyzafastosa Spencer syn. nov. is included as a junior synonym of Ophiomyiatiliae (Couden); Melanagromyzaverbesinae Spencer is considered a synonym of M.vernoniana Steyskal; Phytomyzaranunculoides Spencer syn. nov. is included as a junior synonym of Phytomyzaloewii Hendel; the genus Liomycina Enderlein syn. nov. is included as a junior synonym of Phytobia Lioy. Ophiomyiaultima (Spencer) comb. nov. is recombined from Melanagromyza. Euhexomyzaalbicula Spencer stat. reinst., comb. nov. is resurrected from synonymy with E.winnemanae (Malloch). New host records are provided.\n\nThe total number of known species in the Delmarva states is now 156, representing nearly 18% of the 879 species known from the Nearctic north of Mexico (Eiseman, pers. comm.). The Agromyzinae is better represented, with ~ 25% of known species, with Agromyza being especially well-represented at ~ 43% of known species. The Phytomyzinae fauna represents ~ 15% of known species, with Aulagromyza Enderlein (27.3%), Calycomyza (30.7%), Nemorimyza (100%) and Phytobia (41.0%) being best represented, and Liriomyza (8.9%) and Phytomyza (11.3%) being much more weakly represented.\n\nTwo genus-level groups occurring the Nearctic are not known from the Delmarva states as of yet. The first is the CerodonthaRondanisubgenusPhytagromyza Hendel, which mines in Poaceae. It is known from two western Nearctic species, C. (Ph.) frankensis Spencer (Fig. ) and C. (Ph.) pusilla Zlobin, and one Palaearctic and eastern Canadian species, C. (Ph.) flavocingulata (Strobl). These species are keyed in Zlobin (1997). Secondly, species of Pseudonapomyza Hendel occur further to the north and west in North America, but discovery of this genus in the Delmarva states would not be surprising. Pseudonapomyza presently contains at least 100 species worldwide, almost entirely in the Old World, but there are likely dozens more (Černý 1992, 2008; Zlobin 2002a, 2005a; Černý and Zlobin 2008; Boucher 2004). Boucher (2004) last revised the New World fauna, recognising four species. All of these occur in the Nearctic, with P.asiatica Spencer extending into Guadeloupe and Venezuela.\n\nAlthough the inspiration for this revision was Mathis and Foster’s (2007) revision of the Canacidae (Diptera) of the Delmarva states, and discussions with Wayne Mathis, the motivation came from curating the immense acalyptrate collection at the Museum of Natural History at the Smithsonian (USNM), which contains vast amounts of historical material from these states and district. Strangely, this collection was largely ignored by Spencer and Steyskal (1986b) during their revision of the Agromyzidae of the lower United States, using it mostly to examine type specimens designated by earlier researchers. Spanning more than a century of collection, the USNM is likely the largest repository of Nearctic Agromyzidae, and certainly the most extensive collection from the mid-Atlantic states, populated quite heavily through the efforts of C.H. Curran, K.E. Frick, S.W. Frost, G. Hevel, A.L. Melander, W. Steiner, G. Steyskal, and W.W. Wirth, among others. As the author wished to take advantage of this heavily sampled fauna, and to examine all agromyzid genera in a work of reasonable geographic scope for his first study of the family, a revision of the Delmarva fauna seemed appropriate. The author’s later work on Agromyzidae at the Canadian National Collection of Insects, Arachnids and Nematodes (CNC) provided much additional material complementary to this study, and specimens from that institution also predominate here.\n\nTable 1.\n\nSubfamilyGenus# Nearctic species north of Mexico# species in Delmarva states Agromyzinae Agromyza 5825 Euhexomyza 61 Japanagromyza 81 Melanagromyza 8016 Ophiomyia 8918 Phytomyzinae Amauromyza 233 Aulagromyza 113 Calycomyza 3912 Cerodontha 7317 Haplopeodes 51 Liriomyza 15714 Metopomyza 61 Nemorimyza 22 Phytobia 165 Phytoliriomyza 276 Phytomyza 27531 Pseudonapomyza 40TOTAL879156\n\nNatural history\n\nThe larvae of all Agromyzidae feed inside the living tissue of plants, with species reared from more than 140 families across the monocots, dicots, horsetails, ferns, and liverworts (Hering 1957, 1966; Spencer 1990; Scheffer et al. 2007). At least one species may also occur on a hornwort, with a parasitized puparium tentatively identified as Phytomyza recovered from Nothocerusaenigmaticus (Gilme, 2017). The non-vascular thallophytes and mosses are not known to be hosts, nor are the vascular gymnosperms with the exception of unsubstantiated Phytobia larval traces in fossil and extant tree trunks (Süss 1979), one record of Tropicomyiaatomella (Malloch) in leaves of Gnetum (Sasakawa and Pong 1988), and presumed leaf mines of Liriomyzaschmidti (Aldrich) on the cycad Zamia (Eiseman et al. 2019).\n\nFeeding habits among taxa are diverse, with many species leaf-mining or boring inside stems, roots, twigs, and trunks, but others are known to mine in seeds, seed pods and flower heads, and species across a number of genera induce galls. Herbaceous annual plants are disproportionately affected by Agromyzidae compared to other similarly feeding phytophages such as the leaf-mining Lepidoptera, which dominate on perennials (Hespenheide 1991). Most species for which larval habits have been discovered are those that mine leaves because the mines produced are often readily observed, and the mines of some may be visible from a distance. Especially conspicuous mines can be produced by species such as Calycomyzaflavinotum (Frick), for example, where numerous larvae might mine across the entire surface of large Arctium leaves. Conversely, those species that remain hidden inside thicker, opaque structures are generally overlooked, and as such, many host relationships for these remain to be discovered. An exhaustive and invaluable compendium of these flies and their hosts was provided by Spencer (1990), with an updated list of host genera later provided by Benavent-Corai et al. (2005). Eiseman (2019) provides complete host species lists for all known leaf- and stem-mining species in North American, as well as records of observed mines of unknown agromyzid species.\n\nSince plant hosts are still unknown for many species, and it is becoming apparent that many species once thought to be faithful to a single species or genus of host are actually more varied in their diet, it is not recommended that identifications be made using host alone. Adult male dissections or molecular sequence data are crucial for confident identification, and additional details of larval host usage, mine shape and frass pattern are also useful for contributing to a diagnosis (Eiseman and Lonsdale 2018). While some agromyzids may truly be restricted to a single plant host, it is likely that most can be generally characterised as oligophagous, being limited to multiple hosts in related families or genera. The apparent monophagy of many species will eventually prove to be an artifact of incomplete observations, with a growing body of data revealing that additional rearing records will almost certainly lead to novel host records for many species (Scheffer et al. 2021; Eiseman et al. 2018–2021). The extent to which this is true, however, can only be accurately characterised after more targeted taxonomic and rearing studies, and should prove to be a rich field of study.\n\nAmong the agromyzid genera, many lineages have successfully speciated on specific plant taxa, especially on diverse groups such as grasses (e.g., Cerodontha, Metopomyza Enderlein, the Pseudonapomyzaatra group, the Agromyzabispinata group, others) and herbaceous Asteraceae (e.g., at least 1/2 of non-Cerodontha phytomyzines). Within these more specialised groups, however, there appear to be periodic but major shifts to entirely different plant families or orders followed by bursts of speciation (Griffiths 1980; Scheffer and Wiegmann 2000). This was supported by Scheffer et al. (2007) at the genus level, who found host use to be quite varied, with at least ten genera occurring on both monocots and dicots, and non-angiosperm feeders derived from angiosperm-feeding stock.\n\nTrue polyphagy is uncommon in the Agromyzidae, with only an estimated 16 species occurring on a wide diversity of host families (Spencer 1990). As would be expected, many of these occur on a variety of agriculturally significant crops and can sometimes be quite pestiferous and difficult to control, as populations easily accumulate on weeds in and around growing areas or alternate crops. They are also often readily dispersed to other countries through trade, hidden within plant tissue and potting soil. A number of these, especially those in the genus Liriomyza, appear to have originated in North and Central America, but other Old World species are similarly problematic.\n\nLarval movement of agromyzid leaf miners within the host is characteristic and can be used to differentiate them from other leaf miners such as the microlepidoptera, as discussed in Eberle (1967) and Dempewolf (2005): the larva lies on its side and sweeps its body dorsally and ventrally to shave off successive rows of cells.\n\nMine location and shape, and the pattern by which frass is deposited in the mine, is often characteristic for a given species on a particular host during a certain part of the year, which may allow for tentative field identification (Nowakowski 1962; Dempewolf 2005; Lonsdale and Scheffer 2011). This is not true for all species, however, with similar mines of different species sometimes occurring on the same host plant or population of plants, which has been particularly problematic in the early diagnosis of some pest species. An especially thorough discussion on this topic is provided in Eiseman (2019). The main categories of leaf mine pattern are linear/serpentine and blotch, although there are many variations and irregularities, and a single larva may produce different mines over time, sometimes with later blotch mines obscuring the linear original. Leaf mines are usually also associated with specific parts of the leaf, such as the midrib, margin, lateral veins or even the petiole. The usage of specific cell layers also varies between species, but a single larva may not necessarily be restricted to a single layer over successive instars. Upon pupariation, the larva may remain in the mine or slightly removed from it within the leaf, it may first emerge and drop to the ground, or it may pupariate partially to entirely emerged from the mine, anchoring itself with enlarged hind spiracles, strong threads, or a hardened frass deposit. Seed and stem miners typically pupariate within the host where feeding occurs (Spencer 1987). A few species switch from leaf to stem mining, such as the pestiferous Ophiomyiaphaseoli (Tryon), or from stem to seed mining. If a species is gall-forming, the shape and location of the gall is characteristic (Dempewolf 2005). Phytobia species are found under the bark of trees where they feed on young xylem, tissue that in the past was incorrectly referred to as “cambium”, as discussed in Ylioja et al. (1998); their feeding produces characteristic “pith flecks” that are also called “medullary spots”.\n\nEggs are introduced into host tissue by female oviposition, with the modified terminal segments of the female abdomen specialised for creating a hole in the host and guiding the egg into the appropriate position among the cell layers. The female may produce similar additional punctures in the host to release sap on which both sexes feed (Ferrar 1987; Aukema et al. 1996). These feeding punctures may be abundant and cover the entire leaf surface, with some species such as Phytomyzahorticola (Goureau) producing up to 150 punctures per leaf, despite leaving only a few eggs behind (Hill 1986). In Agromyzafrontella (Rondani), pheromones left by the female around the egg insertion point, possibly a product of the digestive tract, reduces competition as an oviposition-deterrent (McNeil and Quiring 1983). The larva emerges from the egg after a few days, and feeding may last from a single week to ten months, dependant on the species, host and temperature (Spencer 1987; USDA 2008). Some species such as Phytomyzailicis Curtis feed well into the winter (Eber 2004). Species with multiple generations per year tend to produce more rapidly developing larvae, and overwintering larvae may arrest growth to resume activity when favourable conditions return (Spencer 1987). Several forms of conspecific competition have been observed for A.frontella on the host, including larval cannibalism, larvae pre-empting competitors by mining the leaf first, and adult feeding on a leaf to preclude larval mining (Quiring and McNeil 1984a–c).\n\nParasitoids are highly effective in controlling agromyzid population numbers, often with high mortality rates that are frequently discouraging to those attempting to rear the flies. Commonly encountered families are Eulophidae, Figitidae, Braconidae, and Pteromalidae, which emerge from the host puparium, but less commonly the larva. Eiseman (2019) has provided an overview of these parasitoids and their relationships for North American taxa. The preservation of these wasps in agricultural settings is essential, as they often suppress pests to levels not requiring additional intervention. In settings where pesticides are used, misapplication may easily affect wasp populations disproportionately, resulting in the collapse of these natural controls followed by pest outbreaks, unintentionally increasing damage, and reducing crop yield and value (Weintraub and Horowitz 1995; Hidrayani et al. 2005).\n\nClassification of Agromyzidae\n\nFamily-level relationships\n\nWhile it is relatively simple to diagnose the family, the assignment of derived or synapomorphic states is problematic due to the uncertainty involved with establishing outgroups, and there is little consensus on sister group relationships. Minor similarities in wing venation, chaetotaxy and genitalia have historically allied the Agromyzidae to other acalyptrates, but these simple characters are of equivocal polarity and can be easily interpreted as plesiomorphic.\n\nThe Agromyzidae is currently treated as a member of the Opomyzoidea (McAlpine 1989), at least as a close relative of the Clusiidae (Griffiths 1972b; Frick 1952a; Spencer 1987, 1990), but it is becoming increasingly evident that this superfamily is a “dumping ground” for unplaced families of more generalised morphology, at least in part. As an example, the monogeneric Acartophthalmidae was treated as sister to Clusiidae in McAlpine’s (1989) Clusioinea on the basis of a generalised habitus and a handful of putative synapomorphies (an angulate extension on the pedicel is the only character of note and this has been independently derived in other Acalyptratae). Acartophthalmidae has recently been supported as Carnoidea using quantitative phylogenetic methods, subsequently removing it from the Opomyzoidea (Buck 2006). Most recently, Winkler et al.’s (2010) molecular study of the Opomyzoidea provided little evidence for any family-level relationships, with the exception of weak support for Agromyzidae + Neurochaetidae, a subset of periscelid genera within an expanded Aulacigastridae, and relatively strong support for Xenasteiidae + Australimyzidae (Carnoidea). There are additional other relationships among the Asteoinea supported to varying degrees by different character subsets (a summary of these is provided in Winkler et al. 2010), but the homoplasious nature of these characters and the degree to which they have been reinterpreted in the literature precludes any confident statements about common ancestry.\n\nIn an effort to identify any possible synapomorphic morphological characters shared by the opomyzoid families, the author examined representatives of all extant genera, excluding some asteiid, odiniid, teratomyzid and Afrotropical taxa; additional data on Palaearctic Anthomyzidae were taken from Roháček (2006). Except for the putatively ancestral characters of chaetotaxy and wing venation that characterise most Opomyzoidea, almost no additional external or genitalic characters were found that would serve to support relationships between these families, with two major exceptions.\n\nThe first of these is Anthomyzidae + Opomyzidae, the monophyly of which received modest support in Roháček (2006). This contrasts uncertain results regarding these two families in Winkler et al. (2010), however, and there are possible conflicting characters of the female genitalia (Kotrba and Baptista 2002). The second is an association between the Agromyzidae and the predominantly Australian Fergusoninidae, which is supported by a relatively substantial number of female genitalic and larval characters. Fergusoninidae is a similarly phytophagous family of small-bodied species that was at one time even considered to be Agromyzidae (Malloch 1924b). However, placement of this family in the superfamily Nerioidea was well-supported by Lonsdale (2020) in a quantitative analysis of the nerioid and diopsoid families using morphological data sets (external, male genitalic and female genitalic) and numerous outgroup families, including Agromyzidae. Putative similarities to Agromyzidae were supported as superficial and there is much disagreement in the structure of the male genitalia. The molecular analyses of Bayless et al. (2021) provide conflicting placement of Fergusoninidae, again suggesting closer association to Agromyzidae in a “cleft pedicel clade”. In their preferred phylogeny, Agromyzidae + Odiniidae is sister to Fergusoninidae + Carnidae, which still supports the similar female and larval characters of Agromyzidae and Fergusoninidae as convergent.\n\nPutative family synapomorphies\n\nIn his discussion of the family, McAlpine (1989) listed a number of derived characters to define the Agromyzidae: the larvae feed in living plant tissue with an associated adaptation of the mouthparts, with “mandibles toothed and angularly positioned in relation to hypopharyngeal sclerite and hypopharyngeal and tentoropharyngeal sclerites fused” (Figs ); the anterior larval spiracles lie close together dorsally on the thorax (visible in puparium, Fig. ); the cells connected to the larval fat bodies contain calcium carbonate crystals; tergite 6 and sternite 5 are enlarged in the male; the male pregenital sclerites (sternites 6–8) are reduced, usually forming a small symmetrical dorsal band; the phallus is “extremely complex” and [at least ancestrally] contains two gonopores; female segment 7 forms a large oviscape with an anterodorsal apodeme (Figs – ); the membrane between female segments 7 and 8 is densely covered with anteriorly directed denticles (Fig. ); female segment 8 is modified into one pair of serrated egg-guides; the female cercus has a group of apical trichoid sensilla (Figs ).\n\nAdditional external adult characters added here include a relatively large and subshiny ocellar triangle surrounding the ocellar tubercle (Fig. ) (secondarily reduced or obscured in several lineages, especially Phytomyzinae), and possibly the presence of only one pair of lateral scutellar setae (absent in some Cerodontha). Elaborating on the structure of the internal components of the genitalia (Figs ): the pregonite is absent; the distiphallus is discrete and capsule-like with basal insertion of the ejaculatory duct (often with basal differentiation of the segment to produce a “mesophallus”); the basiphallus is segmented basally to produce a separate cylindrical structure termed the “phallophorus”; the basiphallus is distally composed of one pair of long lateral plates flanking the ejaculatory duct; the epiphallus is a segmented, folding structure beneath the phallophorus.\n\nGeneric classification\n\nThe genera of Agromyzidae have traditionally been divided between two subfamilies, the Agromyzinae and the Phytomyzinae, which follows the same system originally devised by Fallén (1823a, b) for his “agromyzides” and “phytomyzides”. This system has recently been corroborated using morphological (Dempewolf 2001) and molecular (Scheffer et al. 2007) data. The adults of Phytomyzinae are characterised by plesiomorphic wing venation similar to that of other Opomyzoidea: the subcostal vein is either incomplete distally or it reaches the costa as a thin fold that remains separate from R1; R1 itself is sometimes slightly expanded apically, but it is almost always narrow and straight (Fig. ). Conversely, the subcosta is fused with R1 distally in the Agromyzinae and the apex of R1 is almost always expanded and sinuate (Fig. ). This venation is relatively consistent within subfamilies, although a number of Phytobia (Phytomyzinae) have converged upon the state otherwise typical of the Agromyzinae, and some Agromyza Fallén have the derived character appearing very subtly. Regarding larval morphology, the Phytomyzinae (Figs , , , ) is characterised by a reduced lower arm on the cephalopharyngeal skeleton while the Agromyzinae (Fig. ) is characterised by two strong arms (Spencer 1987). A variably developed medial longitudinal sclerotised band on the ejaculatory apodeme is here also found throughout the Agromyzinae (Fig. ), although it only frequently appears in species of the Ophiomyia genus group, being indistinct or secondarily lost in many species of Agromyza and Japanagromyza Sasakawa.\n\nSince inconsistencies in the subfamilies’ defining characters were brought to light by von Tschirnhaus (1971) it has been speculated that the lineages of Agromyzidae cannot be forced into two distinct halves. As a solution, Spencer (1990) provided an alternate system of classification that encompasses four separate genus groups: the Penetagromyza group, which is equivalent to Agromyzinae, and the Napomyza, Phytobia and Phytoliriomyza groups, which together are equivalent to the Phytomyzinae. Little to no evidence was provided in support of these groups or the relationships within them, and their use in classification here appears to be limited, but they are nonetheless mentioned below as they relate to generic relationships.\n\nSubfamily Agromyzinae\n\nAlthough there are a number of highly characteristic lineages within Agromyzinae, most of the subfamily has relatively non-descript and uniform colouration, venation and often chaetotaxy. To compound this, species are often described on the basis of slight morphometric changes in the male genitalia and subtle variations in external morphology, making species identification problematic.\n\nAgromyzinae can be divided into three relatively distinct clades. The first is the Ophiomyia genus group, an aggregate of morphologically similar and frequently confused genera that includes Ophiomyia Braschnikov (Figs – ), Melanagromyza (Figs ), Euhexomyza Lonsdale (Figs – ) and the Old World Tropicomyia Spencer. Lonsdale (2014) re-characterised this group and its genera, and aside from sharing a generally similar habitus, he found species to have a large, bulging lunule, insertion of the antenna below the midpoint of the head, brown halters (with very few exceptions) and no prescutellar acrostichal setae (also absent in some Japanagromyza). Internally, the subepandrial sclerite is divided into two well-sclerotised plates that almost meet at a point medially, the inner lobe of the hypandrium has partially separated into an arched, band-like sclerite, the postgonite is sometimes reduced to absent, modified or fused to other structures, and the mesophallus is shifted to form a small distoventral lobe on the distiphallus (with some exceptions). Species are mostly internal borers, with leaf mining largely restricted to Tropicomyia. Tropicomyia is a small genus of minute, brown leaf mining species with a disproportionate number of polyphages. While the genus is likely not monophyletic and in need of revision (Lonsdale 2014), most species appear to belong to a core lineage that produces irregular mines in the upper epidermal layer that appear “silvery” (Spencer 1973).\n\nThe second clade is made up of the genus Agromyza (Figs ), which is often paler and more slender compared to other Agromyzinae, and it is best diagnosed by the presence of a distinct saw-like stridulatory mechanism along the fused lateral margins of the first and second tergites in both sexes (Fig. ). All species also have one pair of prescutellar acrostichal setae and three or more dorsocentral setae (Fig. ), although a number of grass-feeding species have only two well-developed pairs.\n\nThe last clade is composed solely of Japanagromyza (Figs ), which was redefined by Lonsdale (2013) in his revision of the African species. The genus shares a combination of features characteristic of both Agromyza and the Ophiomyia genus group, leading some authors to treat it as an “intermediate” of the two. Like Agromyza, it often has prescutellar acrostichal setae and the mesophallus is basal to the distiphallus (not ventral). Japanagromyza and a minority of Agromyza also have an inner-distal comb of setae on the hind tibia (von Tschirnhaus 1991). Like the Ophiomyia genus group, Japanagromyza lacks the stridulatory file on the abdomen, it is quite dark in colour and sometimes iridescent, and it has a reduced number of dorsocentrals. Furthermore, while most species leaf-mine like Agromyza, Sasakawa (2010) revealed that the genus presented a broader range of habits otherwise characteristic of the Ophiomyia genus group. Based on the relatively high degree of variation in these characters, and because of the unusual diversity in genitalic features seen across Japanagromyza species globally, it seems unlikely that the genus is monophyletic (Lonsdale 2013).\n\nSubfamily Phytomyzinae\n\nThe Phytomyzinae represents a comparatively heterogenous group that varies widely in external and male genitalic morphology, contrasting the often uniform species of Agromyzinae. A genus-level phylogeny of the subfamily was produced by Dempewolf (2001), but portions of his proposed relationships were challenged by Scheffer et al. (2007) and still remain partially unresolved. Despite this, several groups of genera appear to be moderately well-supported.\n\nThe first of these is what Spencer (1990) called the “Napomyza group”, and it is largely comprised of the diverse genus Phytomyza (Figs ), which is characterised by proclinate orbital setulae in combination with a costa that extends to vein R4+5, M1 is weak or spectral, and crossvein dm-m is absent or situated basally. There is also slight to strong costalisation of the wing veins. The classification of this genus was recently advanced by Winkler et al. (2009), who provided the most robust quantitative analysis of Phytomyza to date. Winkler et al. (2009) maintained Napomyza and Ptochomyza Hering as subgenera of Phytomyza because they are readily diagnosable, they were both supported as monophyletic, and were both recovered near the base of Phytomyza sensu lato. Winkler et al. (2009) also re-synonymised Chromatomyia Hardy with Phytomyza, supporting the findings of a number of historical studies. An argument for retention of Chromatomyia was proposed by von Tschirnhaus (2021), but reanalysis of the evidence by Lonsdale and Eiseman (2021) revealed that synonymy of the genus was well-founded and should be maintained for a number of reasons: Chromatomyia renders Phytomyza paraphyletic, it is unlikely to be monophyletic itself (although proof is not definitive), larval characters in support of the genus are homoplastic, and male genitalic characters supporting the genus are impractical for use, frequently misdiagnosed or misinterpreted, and also possibly homoplastic.\n\nOther genera in the Napomyza group are poorly represented or unknown in the New World. These resemble Phytomyza in having the costa extend to R4+5, and many species also exhibit costalisation of the wing veins, but the orbital setulae are erect to reclinate or absent. The smallest of these genera is Gymnophytomyza Hendel, which has two Palaearctic species that were treated by Zlobin (1999); species lack the proepisternal seta and there are records of leaf mining in Galium. Aulagromyza and Pseudonapomyza are differentiated by characters of wing venation and their monophyly is yet to be confidently established. Most Aulagromyza are dark-bodied species (Fig. ), but the A.populicola group (Fig. ) is made up of bright yellow species that feed on Salicaceae and may not be related, as discussed by Zlobin (2007c) and Winkler et al. (2009). Pseudonapomyza is divided into two groups, the most abundant and widespread of which is the P.atra group (Zlobin 2002a) (Figs , ), which has an angulate first flagellomere (with at least one exception), the male mesophallus and distiphallus are distinctive, and larvae feed on Poaceae (Zlobin 2002a). The P.acanthacearum group may be paraphyletic (Zlobin 2002a), and it is restricted to Old World tropical regions, where species feed on Acanthaceae, Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae (Černý 2008) and Bignoniaceae (Madire et al. 2010).\n\nThe remaining Phytomyzinae were considered by Spencer (1990) to belong to either the “Phytoliriomyza group” or the “Phytobia group”. There is no strong morphological or molecular support for the Phytoliriomyza group (Scheffer et al. 2007), but a subset of six genera with tubercle-like setae on the posterodistal margin of the epandrium and surstylus is possibly monophyletic: Calycomyza (Figs – ), Haplopeodes Steyskal (Fig. ), Liriomyza (Figs – ), Metopomyza (Figs , ), Phytoliriomyza Hendel (Figs ) and Selachops. These genera were recovered together in Scheffer et al. (2007), but not in Dempewolf (2001), although results in the latter were discussed as possibly being attributable to the inclusion of homoplastic features. Another likely monophyletic lineage within this group is Liriomyza, Haplopeodes and some Phytoliriomyza, where the number of tubercles on epandrium and surstylus is reduced to one, although these structures are sometimes secondarily lost, modified or duplicated. In Metopomyza and the remaining Phytoliriomyza there is usually a discrete comb or otherwise ordered arrangement of tubercles, contrasting the dense, scattered tubercles seen in Calycomyza, Selachops and the unusual L.quadrisetosa (Malloch) (Figs ). Only the small Palaearctic Selachops is not known in the Nearctic (Zlobin 1984); the host of S.flavocinctus Wahlberg was recently revealed to be Carexacuta (Cyperaceae) (Kostromina et al. 2016).\n\nWithin this group characterised by tubercle-like setae on the external male terminalia, there is gathering consensus that at least some genera are artificial groupings (Dempewolf 2001; Scheffer et al. 2007). As such, there is a strong need for boundaries to be re-evaluated so that genera can be reconstructed as entities that are both monophyletic and easily diagnosable using external characters. For example, if it is supported that Phytoliriomyza is indeed paraphyletic, it will have to be divided into at least two groups if other genera such as Metopomyza and Liriomyza are to be retained. However, while some lineages of Phytoliriomyza can be diagnosed externally (such as that with an entirely black first flagellomere and that with an apically brown halter and setose eyes), others are inseparable from species in related genera without male dissection, reducing potential generic utility. Dissection is currently also necessary for confident diagnosis of Haplopeodes and most Liriomyza, given that characters of colour, chaetotaxy and wing venation are overlapping and frequently convergent. Some progress has been made to provide natural boundaries for Liriomyza, such as including Galiomyza Spencer as a junior synonym, but consistently useful external diagnostic characters are still lacking and much additional work needs to be done (Lonsdale 2017). Lonsdale (2017) discussed the polyphyly and variant morphology of Galiomyza species in detail before synonymizing it, but Papp and Černý (2017) resurrected it soon thereafter, unusually noting that they preferred to retain it in order to avoid reorganising their as yet unpublished chapter on it, which was to appear in print soon after the synonymy appeared; an unclarified statement on the monophyly of Galiomyza was also mentioned. It is recommended that the synonymy of Galiomyza be retained until scientific evidence is provided to the contrary. The position of the New World genus Haplopeodes is uncertain, although some have proposed it to be an offshoot of Liriomyza (Spencer 1990) or at least a close relative of it (Steyskal 1980). Determining Haplopeodes’ ancestry has proven to be difficult, however, due to an extreme reduction in size and other features that may have been phylogenetically informative, especially those of the male genitalia.\n\nThe positions of the other phytomyzine genera have not been confidently resolved and their relationships remain uncertain (Dempewolf 2001; Scheffer et al. 2007). Molecular data weakly supports Cerodontha (Figs ) as sister to the rest of the Phytomyzinae, and there is variable support for a lineage encompassing those genera without tubercles on the surstylus and epandrium, including those in the “Napomyza group”. Of these genera, Amauromyza Hendel (Figs ), Nemorimyza (Figs ) and Phytobia (Figs , ) belong to what Spencer (1990) called the “Phytobia group”. Spencer (1990) considered these genera to be basal in the family because they share a large body size and a supposedly plesiomorphic feeding mode (Nowakowski 1964; Spencer 1990), that is, stem-boring, even though all Nemorimyza and some Amauromyza are leaf-miners. Both of these historically held assumptions of evolutionary progression were found to be erroneous by Scheffer et al. (2007), who instead supported leaf mining as the ancestral state.\n\nThe status of two genera placed by Spencer (1990) in the Phytoliriomyza group is uncertain. Genitalic illustrations of Xeniomyza Meijere in Spencer (1990: figs 237, 238) strongly suggest that the genus should be synonymized with Liriomyza. The type species is known from Amaranthaceae (Spencer 1990), and the two Palaearctic species are characterised by loss of dm-m and costalisation of the wing veins (Zlobin 1979). The monotypic Pseudoliriomyza Spencer (host unknown) is known from Tanzania and Indonesia (Spencer 1966d) and has some similarity to Liriomyza, but additional specimens are required for further study. The genus is characterised by loss of vein dm-m, the fourth dorsocentral, the surstylus and the epandrial spine, and there are some genitalic similarities to Amauromyza in the structure of the hypandrium and the ejaculatory apodeme.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nThe majority of material examined for this study is deposited in the Smithsonian Institution, National Museum of Natural History, Washington, D.C., USA (USNM), and the Canadian National Collection of Insects, Arachnids and Nematodes, Ottawa, Canada (CNC). Additional material was examined from, or is deposited in the following institutions:\n\nBLTJ Biological Laboratory, Yazu High School, Tottori Pref., Japan;\n\nBPBM Bernice P. Bishop Museum, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA;\n\nCASC California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco, California, USA;\n\nCFS Canadian Forest Service, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;\n\nCSCA California State Collection of Arthropods California, USA;\n\nCUIC Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA;\n\nDEBU University of Guelph Insect Collection, Guelph, Ontario, Canada;\n\nINHS Illinois Natural History Survey, Champaign, Illinois, USA;\n\nMCZ Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA;\n\nMNHN Museum National D’Histoire Naturelle, Paris, France;\n\nNHMUK The Natural History Museum, London, United Kingdom;\n\nNMW Naturhistorisches Museum Wien, Vienna, Austria;\n\nNRS Naturhistoriska riksmuseet, Stockholm, Sweden;\n\nOUMNH Oxford University Museum of Natural History, Oxford, United Kingdom;\n\nRNH Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie, Leiden, Netherlands;\n\nSMNS Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde, Stuttgart, Germany;\n\nUDCC University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, USA;\n\nUZMH Finnish Museum of Natural History, University of Helsinki, Finland;\n\nVPIC Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia, USA;\n\nWVDA West Virginia Department of Agriculture, Charleston, West Virginia, USA;\n\nZIL Russian Academy of Sciences, Zoological Institute, St. Petersburg, Russia;\n\nZMHU Museum für Naturkunde der Humboldt-Universität, Berlin, Germany;\n\nZMUC Zoological Museum, University of Copenhagen, Denmark;\n\nZMUN Zoological Museum, University of Oslo, Norway.\n\nFor the following keys and species descriptions, an emphasis was placed on adult description and diagnosis, especially with regards to the highly derived components of the male terminalia, as the majority of material examined was collected as adults with little or no associated host or habitat data. Host genera are provided only, with plant species listed when only a few are known. While external morphology is of course also useful, findings strongly support Nowakowski (1962), who noted that the external characters usually used to separate closely related agromyzid species, such as wing vein ratios, body size, fronto-orbital number, and subtle colour characters, are often of “negligible taxonomic value”. Many of these external characters were here found to vary subtly to widely within species previously thought to be morphologically conserved. This is of particular significance considering the frequent use of these characters in historical identification keys, which often only provide a single character at each couplet.\n\nAdult terminology and definitions are outlined below in the family description. Terminology for external structures largely following Cumming and Wood (2017), except where noted. Genitalic terminology mostly follows Lonsdale (2020), which expands on Cumming and Wood (2017) by discussing structures of the terminalia peculiar to families of Acalyptratae that are not otherwise considered in the earlier work. A few deviations are made here for structures of the hypandrial complex specific to the Agromyzidae, wherein the terminology presented by Steyskal (1969) is provided: specifically, the phallophorus, proepiphallus, and metepiphallus. Gena height is measured vertically at the lowest point of the eye. Dorsocentral setae are numbered starting from the posterior-most seta because setae number often varies anteriorly. Rows of acrostichal setulae are counted at the transverse suture. New host records, and new country/province/state records are indicated by an asterisk.\n\nMost specimens are pinned, and either air-dried or prepared in a critical-point drier. Some voucher material collected by D. Smith or S. Scheffer, excluding most specimens designated as types, was retained in 95% ethanol for potential future study. Abdomens of dissected specimens were initially prepared by dissolving the soft tissue in hot potassium hydroxide, followed by washing in demineralised or deionised water, neutralisation in glacial acetic acid, and further washing, but later dissections used hot lactic acid exclusively. Thorough washing and neutralisation of the potassium hydroxide still leave minute traces of the chemical, which continue to dissolve pigment and weaken sclerotised tissue, and it is not recommended for use. Genitalia were stored in glycerine in microvials pinned with the specimen. Most illustrations were prepared by the author, excluding several figures scanned from the literature, which are indicated in the text and in the acknowledgements. The sizes of illustrated structures are shown in correct proportion to each other, with the epandrium reduced due to space constraints; some structures were not illustrated if they were damaged, could not be found (ejaculatory apodeme), or were uninformative for diagnosis within the genus.\n\nResults\n\nAgromyzidae – adult diagnosis\n\nAdults generally small-bodied, wing length usually 1.5–3.5 mm, but as small as 0.5 mm and as large as 6.5 mm. Postocellar setae diverging. Frons usually with inclinate anterior and reclinate posterior fronto-orbitals. Orbital setulae usually present. Vibrissa present. Arista dorsobasal (Figs , ). Ocellar tubercle surrounded by often large and subshiny ocellar triangle (usually less distinct than in Chloropidae) (Fig. ), but sometimes reduced or with triangle absent. Lunule distinct, sometimes large. Scutellum with one pair of apical setae and almost always with one pair of well-developed laterobasal setae. Costa with break at end of subcostal vein, which is complete or nearly complete (Figs , ), but sometimes fused to R1 if that vein is apically sinuous; humeral break absent. Vein CuA2 present, enclosing anal cell. Dorsoapical tibial setae absent. Basiphallus segmented into basal phallophorus and usually one pair of distal plates flanking duct. Distiphallus sometimes segmented to produce basal mesophallus. Female with oviscape distinct, dark, and heavily sclerotised (Figs , – ); membrane between female segments 7 and 8 densely covered with denticles; sternite 8 modified into one pair of serrated egg-guides.\n\nA number of other small-bodied acalyptrate families are similar to Agromyzidae, but differ as follows. Chloropidae can be similarly small-bodied and stout with a large ocellar triangle, but this family lacks the anal cell and oviscape, and has a sharp propleural carina. Anthomyzidae are slender and sometimes pale with a vibrissa and larger ocellar triangle, superficially similar to some genera such as Cerodontha, and vein R1 is sinuous apically, similar to Agromyzinae, but in this family, a ctenidial spine is almost always present on the fore femur, the anepisternum is usually bare (with at least one large seta in Agromyzidae), the subcostal vein is clearly fused to R1 apically, and there is no stout oviscape. Odiniidae and Clusiidae have similar chaetotaxy, but preapical tibial setae are usually present, the large oviscape is absent, and Odiniidae have an incomplete subcosta; some Clusiidae do not have these tibial setae, but all species have a projection on the outer- and sometimes inner-distal margin of the pedicel. Other taxa with a large, conspicuous oviscape and complete subcosta, such as Tephritoidea, usually have strongly patterned wings and lack a vibrissa; Fergusoninidae are bright yellow with an anteriorly flattened head with small antennae concealed in deep recesses, a small face, and a very large parafacial and lunule.\n\nAgromyzidae – adult description\n\nGeneral: Wing length small, usually 1.5–3.5 mm (sometimes as small or as large as 0.5 mm and 6.5 mm). Colour varying from almost entirely black or brown to yellow, but many with some degree of pattern that may be more of less typical of a genus (for example, species of Liriomyza and Calycomyza are more conservatively patterned than Phytomyza and Phytoliriomyza); dark species of Agromyzinae sometimes with metallic shine (many Melanagromyza and some Ophiomyia and Japanagromyza); often subshiny to heavily brown or grey pruinose, uncommonly glossy.\n\nHead: (Figs , ) Frons with frontal vitta usually soft, but sometimes better sclerotised, sometimes with several setulae bordering lunule (common in Agromyza and Phytobia); fronto-orbital plate (fused frontal and orbital plates) and variably sized ocellar triangle either indistinct from vitta, more sclerotised, or delimited by difference in texture; ocellar triangle variably sized, sometimes reaching lunule, sometimes reduced and restricted to small, raised ocellar tubercle bearing ocelli. Lunule usually distinct; small soft and sunken, to large heavily sclerotised and bulging. Antenna porrect, first flagellomere rarely angled ventrally; arista subbasal, usually pubescent to bare, rarely with rays more elongate. Eye upright to distinctly oblique; bare to microtrichose. If parafacial continues under eye onto gena, band-like region referred to as “cheek”, and remaining ventral region is referred to as “jowl” (“subgena” in Cumming and Wood 2017). Face shallowly concave, often with broad lateral depressions to receive antennae, sometimes with medial carina that may have a central swelling or “bulb”. Gena usually straight or angled posteriorly, uncommonly deeper or produced anteriorly (many Ophiomyia with gena strongly projecting). Clypeus broad and U-shaped, posteromedial margin sometimes emarginate and anterior margin sometimes truncated (Ophiomyia). Proboscis normal, uncommonly elongate; palpus normally narrow, small, and cylindrical, rarely enlarged or swollen.\n\nChaetotaxy: In remaining consistent with names occurring in most agromyzid publications, terminology here largely follows that outlined in McAlpine (1981) in the Manual of Nearctic Diptera, with the fronto-orbital setae (usually four pairs, rarely less than three, sometimes five or more) divided into two classes: the inclinate anterior fronto-orbitals are treated as the inferior orbital setae (ori), and the reclinate/slightly inclinate posterior fronto-orbitals are treated as the superior orbital setae (ors); the two sets are most distinct when viewed anteriorly, and are sometimes difficult to differentiate. Pedicel small, margins shallowly rounded, with one dominant dorsomedial seta. Postocellar setae (one pair) divergent, arising from immediately behind ocellar tubercle. Ocellar setae (one pair) divergent and arising from ocellar tubercle at, or behind level of anterior ocellus. Vibrissae (one pair) distinct; multiple vibrissae sometimes present and fused into pointed “fasciculus” or “horn” in male (some Ophiomyia). Orbital setulae usually in one or two rows, sometimes in several rows, rarely absent, reclinate to proclinate, sometimes inclinate or exclinate; mostly or entirely arising from orbital plate lateral to fronto-orbital setae. Two pairs of divergent vertical setae arising from orbital plate near posterior margin of frons, divided into inner vertical seta and outer vertical seta.\n\nThorax: Sclerites labelled in Figures , , typical of adult Schizophora.\n\nChaetotaxy: (Figs , ) One postpronotal seta. Usually two notopleural setae, uncommonly one. One presutural and two postsutural supra-alar setae (sometimes mistakenly termed the intra-alar); one or two postsutural intra-alar setae (sometimes mistakenly termed the intrapostalar, but these may be distinguished in other families of Diptera as illustrated in Cumming and Wood (2017: figs 41, 42) by being on a discrete swelling in the extreme posterolateral corner of the scutum, the “postalar callus”, which is absent in Agromyzidae; default designation of the posterior-most intra-alar as the post-alar is not justified). Usually two to four dorsocentral setae (fourth seta near or anterior to transverse suture), with additional setae sometimes extending presuturally. One pair of prescutellar acrostichal setae present or absent; acrostichal setulae usually present in 2–10 rows (measured at level of transverse suture), but sometimes absent, becoming sparser and more irregular posteriorly, disappearing at or behind level of posterior dorsocentral. Scutellum with one pair of apical setae and usually one pair of anterolateral setae (absent in two subgenera of Cerodontha); scutellum otherwise bare, but Palaearctic Selachops with dorsum densely setose. One strong, upcurved proepisternal seta (absent in Gymnophytomyza). At least one strong anepisternal and katepisternal seta, but sometimes with additional smaller setae posteromarginally on anepisternum and mediodorsally on katepisternum (mostly Agromyzinae).\n\nLegs: Short, slender, fore and mid legs not widely separated. Segments labelled in Figures , .\n\nChaetotaxy: Posteroventral margin of femora with row of strengthened setae (sometimes indistinct); posterior margin often with scattered setae. Fore tibia sometimes with one posteromedial seta (most Japanagromyza and some Melanagromyza, Nemorimyza and Phytobia). Mid tibia sometimes with one or two posteromedial setae, rarely three. Hind tibia sometimes with inner-distal “cleaning comb” (von Tschirnhaus 1991). Tibiae without dorsal preapical setae; at least mid tibia usually with small ventroapical seta.\n\nWing: (Figs , ) Usually clear, rarely whitish or with faint to more distinct clouding, uncommonly patterned (more frequent in Neotropical species). Subcostal break present, humeral break absent; costa extending to R4+5 or M1+2; subcosta sometimes attaining costa, either as a vein or as a fold if the vein proper ends within the costal cell, but sometimes the subcosta is fused to R1 apically. Crossvein dm-m usually near midpoint of wing, sometimes shifted basally or absent; crossvein r-m present; vein bm-m rarely absent (some Pseudonapomyza). M1 and M4 sometimes faint to spectral; CuA+CuP usually faint to spectral, not reaching wing margin. Anal cell (cell cua) present, closed by vein CuA. Calypter (= squama of previous authors) prominent, semi-circular, and fringed with long hairs. Halter white, yellow, black, or bi-coloured.\n\nFemale abdomen: (Figs – ) Tergites and sternites 1–6 well-developed and setose, sternites narrower; tergites 1 and 2 fused. Segment 7 with tergite and sternite completely fused, enclosing spiracles; forming non-retractable, well-sclerotised, and usually elongate and partially shiny oviscape (= ovipositor sheath of Sasakawa and Basalglied of Hendel) that is usually dark brown to black but uncommonly paler; tergite 7 anteromedially with large, hollow, keel-like apodeme that projects into segment 6; remainder of abdomen past segment 7 usually retracted within oviscape, with membranous region past oviscape. Elongate membranous region between segments 7 and 8 (= segment 8 of Sasakawa) with two pairs of sclerotised bands; dorsal and ventral membrane past these bands densely covered with anteriorly directed denticles used to drill into plant tissue. Tergite 8 absent; sternite 8 divided into one pair of short egg guides with shape and arrangement of posteromedial sensilla variable; used for scraping out hole for egg positioning. Segment 9 absent (McAlpine 1981: 44). Segment 10 with tergite and sternite narrow, sometimes fused and often variably modified, terminating in one pair of short, rounded setose cerci that bear stout apical trichoid sensilla. One pair of usually subspherical spermathecae, often with basal invagination at point of insertion to spermathecal duct (reinforced with minute spiralled sclerotisations, excluding smooth apex), which connects spermathecae to elongate, membranous genital chamber. Ventral receptacle recurved with variably shaped apex.\n\nMale abdomen: (Figs , , ) Tergites and sternites 1–6 well-developed and setose, sternites narrower; tergites 1 and 2 fused; sternite 6 often large and broadly emarginated posteriorly. Male pregenital segments largely reduced to sternite 8, which is narrow, transverse, and often symmetrical and setose; sternites 6 and 7 absent or occasionally represented by lightly sclerotised regions anterior to epandrium ventrolaterally; tergites 7 and 8 absent. Epandrium (= tergite 9) dorsal and dome-like with slightly thickened anterodorsal margin that often produces one pair of raised points laterally to facilitate articulation with hypandrium. Surstylus (one pair) usually present, setose, variably shaped, sometimes with small tubercle-like setae on inner surface; base articulates with, or is variably fused to inner-ventral surface of epandrium or subepandrial sclerite. Cercus (one pair) variably sized, usually setose, sometimes with short spines on inner surface. Subepandrial sclerite (= sternite 10, or ventral epandrial sclerite of some authors) variably shaped, resting between inner surface of epandrium and hypandrial complex; usually plate-like with one pair of well-sclerotised dorsolateral arms (= bacilliform sclerites); sometimes medially divided, often with a pair of setae or spine-like processes, and/or one pair of paler ventral processes that may become thickened and enlarged (Fig. ) (see Cerodonthasectionbelow for discussion of the structure called “Langfortsatz” by previous authors). Hypandrium (= sternite 9) U- or V-shaped with narrow transverse inner-basal lobe (“pregonite” of some authors, including Frick 1952a) bearing two or three apical setae that may be separate or weakly connected to the main body (e.g., Ophiomyia genus group); articulates with external components of genitalia via posterobasal “arms”. Pregonite absent (sections of postgonite or hypandrium sometimes interpreted as “pregonite”, such as by Papp and Černý 2015, 2020). Postgonite (one pair) usually long and narrow with one (but sometimes zero or several) seta and often small outer-medial sockets, usually slightly upturned and medially cleft apically; articulated with, surrounded by, or fused to inner lobe of hypandrium; subovate and plate-like in some Agromyzinae excluding Agromyza, but sometimes absent or possibly fused to epiphallus. Phallapodeme (= aedeagal apodeme of some authors) long and rod-like with extensive muscular attachment to project phallus from abdomen. Ejaculatory duct originates in ejaculatory apodeme and terminates in the distiphallus (“distal section” of Griffiths 1972a), the last section of the phallus that is sometimes divided into an apical distiphallus proper and a basal mesophallus. The distiphallus appears to be ancestrally bifid in the family, being subtly to conspicuously split in most Phytomyzinae with the paired tubules united or atrophied in a number of lineages (including species of Xenophytomyza, Aulagromyza, Haplopeodes, Phytomyza, etc.) or concealed in a basal enclosure (many Liriomyza, Pseudonapomyza and Phytomyzaparvicella (Coquillett)); the paired tubules of the distiphallus are usually less obvious or entirely unified in most Agromyzinae (but see Figs , , for example), with almost all representatives of the Ophiomyia genus group appearing to have a single exit pore (Lonsdale 2014: fig. 38); in some Phytomyza, the dorsobasal margin of the distiphallus branches into a sclerotised structure called the “supporting sclerite” (Fig. ). Basiphallus (“basal section” of Griffiths 1972a) divided into two segments, the basiphallus proper (“basal sclerites or paraphalli” of Griffiths 1972a, “endophallus” of Guglya 2013, “mesophallus” of Papp and Černý 2015), which is one or two plates (rarely more) laterally flanking ejaculatory duct before it enters distiphallus, and the basal phallophorus, a tubular or ring-like basal segment through which the duct enters; phallophorus allows for articulation between phallapodeme and remaining distal components of phallus, is fused to the epiphallus and sometimes the basiphallus, and is sometimes flanked by one pair of sclerites that may be derived from the epiphallus (some Ophiomyia) or the phallapodeme (most Phytomyza). Hypophallus (= ”medial lobe” of Griffiths 1972a, “trough-like sclerite” of Griffiths 1974 and “wedge-shaped sclerite” of Griffiths 1980) a lobate membranous region ventrally near apex of basiphallus that is variably sclerotised and/or expanded; if present, sclerites may articulate or fuse with basiphallus or (less commonly) disti/mesophallus; sclerotisations may consist of one pair of plates or rods that may meet each other ventrally and/or reach basiphallus dorsally; sclerite sometimes present as single small medial bar that may end in hair-like structures (many Liriomyza) and/or widen to form flat, irregular plate (as in some Calycomyza). Paraphallus (“paramesophalli” of Griffiths 1972a) (one pair) small, sclerotised, and usually plate or rod-like, usually directed ventrally to ventrodistally; positioned ventrolaterally at base of distiphallus / mesophallus; possibly homologous to transverse sclerite wrapped around the posterobasal surface of distiphallus / mesophallus in Agromyza. Epiphallus divided into two parts, a smaller, darker proepiphallus (“epiphallus” of Frick 1952a), which articulates with phallophorus, and a wider, flatter metepiphallus (“aedeagal hood” of Frick 1952a), which articulates/fuses to proepiphallus and postgonite and/or hypandrium; components of epiphallus lie along each other in repose and fold outwards during copulation to extend phallus, but folding mechanism abandoned in most Agromyzinae, with reduced proepiphallus and usually enlarged and elaborated metepiphallus separated by membranous space. Ejaculatory apodeme composed of large, flat sclerotised blade with asymmetrical base, and smaller, clear basal sperm pump that often has transverse sclerotisation (= pileus ejaculatorius of Steyskal).\n\nNotes on male genitalic homology. Regarding structural homology, a number of points must be clarified. Firstly, as the basalmost component of the phallus meeting the phallapodeme, the phallophorus is clearly homologous with the “basiphallus” of other Schizophora. The term “phallophorus” is here retained, and treated as the basal segment of the basiphallus proper. As the structure is present and often distinct in taxa throughout the family, and it has had wide usage in the literature, the term has utility. It is not entirely certain whether the agromyzid “basiphallus” originates from the same sclerite as the phallophorus, but in assuming this homology, continuity is maintained with the existing literature, and confusion is avoided by eliminating the need to rename structures. The alternative interpretation would be to consider the agromyzid “basiphallus” a novel, secondary sclerotisation of the lateral phallic membrane, but this explanation is not more parsimonious and it does not have the above advantages. Papp and Černý (2015) partially agree with this interpretation, although their “basiphallus” consists solely of the phallophorus; what they call the “mesophallus” is the basiphallus of this study and other works.\n\nBoth the phallophorus and folding epiphallus appear to have counterparts in other acalyptrate Diptera and may be phylogenetically informative, but the homology and polarity of these are uncertain. Both structures appear to aid in projecting the phallus from the abdomen for copulation, contrasting the lever and fulcrum method employed by families such as Clusiidae, or the method employed by Tephritoidea, etc., but functional requirements may make these prone to convergence.\n\nLastly, the position and shape of the hypophallic sclerites in the ventral region distal to the basiphallus varies widely between species, with numerous intermediate forms. Some complex forms have led some authors (e.g., Griffiths 1972a, 1974, 1980) to invent novel terminology for the sclerites present. Noting this variation, and the absence of any sclerotised structures in some taxa, there is the possibility of repeated loss and gain of analogous structures that may be difficult to interpret. Until a more thorough analysis of the structures in this region is made to establish homology, the single term “hypophallus” will be applied to the membranous lobe in this region, including any sclerotised structures found thereupon.\n\nAgromyzidae – immature description\n\nEgg: Small and clear with shape ovate to reniform; surface texture smooth to reticulate. End bearing small micropyle often broader.\n\nLarva: (Figs ) Typically maggot-like, cylindrical, soft and with ends tapered; Phytobia species often longer and narrower (Greene 1914, 1917; Spencer 1987); form varying very little between species with different feeding habits such as leaf-mining and stem-boring (Dempewolf 2005).

The second tergite itself is also produced posteriorly along the lateral margin, forming a shallow, yet distinct angle (Figs , ). Species in this genus also have one pair of prescutellar acrostichals and three or more dorsocentrals, although several, including A.bispinata Spencer, A.parilis Spencer and their relatives usually have only two that are immediately apparent. Internally, most species have a transverse sclerite wrapped around the posterobasal surface of the mesophallus (which is often fused to the distiphallus and possibly homologous to the paraphallus), but this is absent in some taxa such as A.varifrons Coquillett and A.vockerothi Spencer. There is also no basal sclerotisation on the sperm pump (also absent in many Japanagromyza), there is a haired membrane extending from the posterior face of the hypandrial lobe (sometimes indistinct), and most of those species with a transverse sclerite on the distiphallus also have a unique phallus (Figs , ): the two sclerites of the basiphallus are approximated basally, divergent distally and the apex is abruptly elbowed inwards; the S-shaped distiphallus (including the fused mesophallus) is usually capsule-like with a ventral subbasal, crack-like fissure for entry of ejaculatory duct. This phallus type is found in numerous species, including those in the A.nigripes group, a diverse, predominantly Poaceae-feeding clade (Hendel 1931; Griffiths 1963; Spencer 1990: 353).\n\nFor the purposes of species-level identification, the morphology (including shape, colour, and hairiness) of the first flagellomere is quite important, and if these are missing from the specimen it is recommended that the male genitalia be dissected.\n\nKey to the Delmarva species of Agromyza\n\n1Palpus yellow (apex infuscated in A.apfelbecki).
