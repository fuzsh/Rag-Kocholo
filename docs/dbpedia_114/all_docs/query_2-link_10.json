First move-ins are anticipated for March 2024.\n\nCommunity amenities include a clubhouse/leasing office, outdoor swimming pool, onsite park with playground, controlled access technology, fitness studio and open green spaces.

The communityâ€™s 152 two-bedroom townhomes range from 1,223 to 1,454 square feet while the 25 three-bedrooms homes measure approximately 1,500 square feet.\n\nAmavi Aster Ridge is directly adjacent to Anthem, which is well-regarded for its picturesque high-desert scenery, a high-performing school district and wide array of retail, dining and recreational outlets. The community is also situated within 15 minutes of the Taiwan Semiconductor campus, one of the anchors of the growing employment sector in the Anthem/Deer Valley area. Key commuter thoroughfares Interstate 17 and Anthem Way are also easily accessible from the community."
