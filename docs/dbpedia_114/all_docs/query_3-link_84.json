        "text": "Legacy Mode\n\nMain Gachas\n\nThese gachas are available year-round, and contain the majority of the game's creatures.\n\nDiet Gachas\n\n(See also: Diet Gacha Drops)\n\nThese gachas are the first gachas the player sees in the 'Buy Creatures' menu. These gachas sort creatures by what kinds of food they can eat; in other words, their diet. This category includes the following gachas:\n\nCarnivores Gacha ( 65 Shooms)\n\nHerbivores Gacha ( 65 Shooms)\n\nOmnivores Gacha ( 85 Shooms)\n\nType Gachas\n\n(See also: Type Gacha Drops)\n\nGachas that sort creatures by type (ex. flying, aquatic, semi-aquatic). Each gacha sorts creatures based on what environment the creature can live in. The only creature type that is not included in this gacha type are terrestrial (grounded) creatures. This category includes the following gachas:\n\nSky Gacha ( 150 Shooms)\n\nSea Gacha ( 150 Shooms)\n\nSemi-Aquatic Gacha ( 200 Shooms)\n\nStatus Effect Gachas\n\n(See also: Status Effect Gacha Drops)\n\nGachas that sort creatures based on what kind of status they inflict when biting/getting bit other creatures, such as poison or bleed. Each gacha in this category costs 350 Shooms. This category includes the following gachas:\n\nToxic Gacha ( 350 Shooms)\n\nBleeder Gacha ( 350 Shooms)\n\nSession Gacha\n\nThe Session Gacha is a unique gacha that can only be spun once the player has completed a certain set of tasks. Once the player completes these tasks, the player will be given a Session Gacha Token, and can roll the gacha for 500 Shooms. Once the player rolls the gacha, the token will be consumed and the gacha will lock back up, unlocking when the player gains another token.\n\nThe tasks are as follows:\n\nDrink 100 water.\n\nEat 100 food.\n\nKill 3 players.\n\nExperience a weather event.\n\nGrow from baby to adult.\n\nThe creatures in this gacha are as follows:\n\n(6.25% chance)\n\nCeleritas\n\nCrata Peretina\n\nDieamarjla\n\nEmphines\n\nFerrah\n\nGaltekron\n\nGobli\n\nGurava\n\nHikorshi\n\nKnalriki\n\nPernirex\n\nThykallos\n\nTsugae\n\nTurgeon\n\nVetemortem\n\nZhelijin\n\nTravelers Gacha\n\nThe Travelers Gacha is a gacha based on a similar system that the Session gacha has. As such, it can only be spun once the player has completed a certain set of tasks. Once the player completes these tasks, the player will be given a Travelers Gacha Token/unlock the gacha, and can roll the gacha for 250 Shooms. Once the player rolls the gacha, the token will be consumed and the gacha will lock back up, unlocking when the player gains another token/completes the quests. Once the gacha has been unlocked you can perform the same quests again within the same boost cycle, allowing for players to keep a pipeline which lets them do half the quests for the next token unlock once they have unlocked a new token.\n\nThe tasks are as follows (please note that in-game the travelling part is poorly indicated and seems to be inside the \"2 boost creatures\" part while in fact it is not):\n\nUse 2 or more creature species with Daily Boosts and (please note that once the daily boosts change, the incomplete progress done with a creature for those quests resets; but if the part needed for an specific creature and quest was completed before the daily boosts updated, such respective progress for that creature won't be lost)\n\nKill 2 creatures with each of those 2 boosted creatures, having the Creature Stat Boost (4 kills in total). NOTE: According to the developers grabbing a player and killing them while holding and one shot killing another player do not count for kills. Only the latter doesn't work, since the former works as long as you are lighter than the victim.\n\nGrow 2 creatures with growth boost.\n\nPlay for 30 minutes with a creature with Glimmer Boost (for each one; 60 minutes in total).\n\nTravel 35k studs on Land\n\nTravel 20k studs at Sea.\n\nTravel 50k studs by air.\n\nThe creatures in this gacha are as follows:\n\n(14.2% chance)\n\nAvothius\n\nDalghara\n\nFlickaflie\n\nGeoptxina\n\nHaxaline\n\nKonomushi\n\nMeorlark\n\nNakamaska\n\nExplorer Gachas\n\nThe Explorer Gachas are unique in that they can only be unlocked by collecting their respective capsules (also known as tokens). Once a player collects a capsule, they can unlock the respective matching gacha and choose to roll it in exchange for that Explorer Gacha's designated Shoom cost. Only one capsule can exist on the map at a time (either Photovore, Galaxy, Mecha, or Monster), there cannot be one of each at the same time), they spawn anywhere on the map where food might also spawn, and each capsule has a unique percent chance of spawning after a player collects the currently available capsule on the map.\n\nTokens cannot typically be sniffed by creatures, but can easily be spotted due to the glow they produce. However, with a Springram Plushie equipped, tokens can be located via smell and have uniquely-colored scent lines for each type.\n\nGacha Name Capsule Cost per Roll Photovore Explorer Gacha Photovore Explorer Gacha capsule 100 Shooms per roll Galaxy Explorer Gacha Galaxy Explorer Gacha capsule 500 Shooms per roll Mecha Explorer Gacha Mecha Explorer Gacha capsule 300 Shooms per roll Monster Explorer Gacha Monster Explorer Gacha capsule 600 Shooms per roll Sweet Explorer Gacha Sweet Explorer Gacha capsule 700 Shooms per roll\n\nNotes\n\nMonster Explorer Gacha tokens only appear during Famine and Drought conditions.\n\nMutation Explorer Gacha tokens were converted to Mecha Explorer Gacha tokens and the Mutation Gacha was once again removed. Upon removal, the gacha enabled rolling with the cost of 300 Shooms and the designated explorer token.\n\nCreatures which were formally included in the Mutation Explorer Gacha but did not appear in the new Mecha Explorer Gacha can now be found in the Monster Explorer Gacha.\n\nSweet Explorer Gacha tokens only appear during Cherry Blossom conditions, during which it has a 20% chance of spawning.\n\nTikit-based gachas\n\nTikit-baseed gachas are those which use Tikits to spin.\n\nTikit Gacha\n\nThe Tikit Gacha was the first tikit-based gacha. As thus, it keeps its name.\n\nEach spin costs 10 Tikits, although it has been stated by Wolfragon that this is subject to change in the future.\n\nThe creatures in this gacha follow the design theme of royalty; as of Recode, that theme has continued with further additions to the gacha.\n\nThe creatures in this gacha are as follows:\n\n(25% chance)\n\nEmpiterium\n\nErridea\n\nEskarlor\n\nLeurimess\n\nTime Gacha\n\nThe Time Gacha is a feature that can be unlocked by actively playing the game for a certain amount of hours. The more hours you play, the more Time Currency a player can accumulate to buy higher tier Time Gachas. Time Currency is not gained when in the Main Menu. Time Currency will subtract itself from the total amount of time played each time a player rolls a Time Gacha. It may be accessed by clicking on the \"TIME GACHA\" button.\n\nIt should be noted that the \"all time\" counter resets periodically, so it may not display the amount of time played accurately.\n\nThe Time Gacha is technically several smaller gachas, but each gacha contains only 1 creature, guaranteeing the player's desired drop. The Time Gacha contains the following creatures:\n\nTime Creature Tiers Creature Name 30 Minutes Tier 1 Yiepir 2 Hours Tier 3 Aesho 5 Hours Tier 3 Geogoff 10 Hours Tier 4 Verklixin 30 Hours Tier 3 Zwevealisk 50 Hours Tier 4 Haechionx 100 Hours Tier 5 Yeba'idi 200 Hours Tier 4 Seradae 300 Hours Tier 5 Hellion Warden\n\nRobux Shop\n\n(See also: Robux Shop Creatures)\n\nInstead of using an in-game currency to spin, the Robux Shop (previously known as the Robux Gacha) requires Robux to buy directly, fortunately without the need to spin. Creatures in this shop follow common design themes, much like the creatures within the Limited Gachas.\n\nTime Sensitive Gachas\n\nThese gachas contain creatures which may not be available during all parts of the year, and may cycle through creatures as time goes on.\n\nLimited Gacha\n\n(See also: Limited Gacha Drops)\n\nThe Limited Gacha contains usually 2 creatures at a time whose designs follow a certain theme. These 2 creatures stay in the Limited Gacha for a period of time before they are cycled out for another set of 2 creatures. In order to be able to roll this gacha, the player must have 55 unique species of creatures unlocked. The current price for one roll is 2,500 Shooms. The previous and current gacha themes are as follows:\n\nDinosaur (current, returning)\n\nElemental (previous)\n\nAncient History (previous)\n\nEvent Gachas\n\n(See also: Event Gacha Drops)\n\nEvent Gachas are gachas that become available according to real life holidays. Creatures that feature in an event gacha return as the gacha (or event) itself returns, alongside some new additions. The event gachas are as follows:\n\nChristmas Gacha\n\nValentines Gacha\n\nEaster Gacha\n\nRecode Mode\n\nMain Gachas\n\nThese gachas are available year-round, and contain the majority of the game's creatures.\n\nAll creatures on the diet, type and status effect gachas can also be found on the Mystery Gacha.\n\nDiet Gachas\n\n(See also: Diet Gacha Drops)\n\nThese gachas are the first gachas the player sees in the menu.

Each gacha sorts creatures based on what environment the creature can live in, according to the new mobility types and with all-terrain and glider semi-aquatics absorbed into fliers and semi-aquatics, respectively. The only creature types not included in this gacha type are terrestrial (grounded) and terrestrial glider creatures. This category includes the following gachas:\n\nSky Gacha ( 150 Shooms)\n\nAquatic Gacha / Sea Gacha ( 150 Shooms)\n\nSemi-Aquatic Gacha ( 200 Shooms)\n\nStatus Effect Gachas\n\n(See also: Status Effect Gacha Drops)\n\nGachas that sort creatures based on the kind of status they inflict when biting or being bitten by other creatures, such as poison or bleeding..

Once the player rolls the gacha, the token will be consumed, locking the gacha if no more Session Gacha Tokens are available.

As such, it can only be spun once the player has a Boosted Token, given upon completing a certain set of tasks or trading, and can roll the gacha for 250 Shooms. Once the player rolls the gacha, the token will be consumed and the gacha will lock back up if the player has no more available tokens.

Its contents rotate every week, and may sometimes be paired, or go alone, meaning sometimes there could be a 100% drop chance for an specific creature, and others a 50% for one creature and 50% for another.\n\nAll creatures stemming from this gacha are tagged as \"Death Gacha\" in-game\n\nThe creatures in this gacha can be seen here.\n\nTikit-based gachas\n\nTikit-based gachas are those which cost Tikits to spin.\n\nRoyalty Gacha\n\nThe Royalty Gacha was the second tikit-based gacha introduced in Recode, but it essentially replaced the Tikit Gacha after the 3rd November 2023 so it can be considered the first.
