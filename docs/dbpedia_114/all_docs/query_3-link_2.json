        "text": "As you wander through Yosemite National Park, you can expect to see a great diversity of wildflowers; to date about 1,450 species have been found in the park. Below are some of the more frequently seen flowers. No matter where you go in the park, different species of lupines, paintbrushes, and other genera are likely to be found. (View a list of Yosemite's plant species.)\n\nAlso see common bird illustrations of Yosemite's avian residents by John Muir Laws--who is the author of The Laws Field Guide to the Sierra Nevada.\n\nTake a wildflower walk to see Yosemite's stunning Sierra flora.\n\nSee a Yosemite National Park botanist in the \"Study the Scientist\" video series describe his job (4 minutes 23 seconds).\n\nView park botanists out in the field in the \"Wildflower\" episode of the Yosemite Nature Notes video podcast series (9 minutes 16 seconds).\n\nBecause plant species typically have both a scientific name and a common name, it's helpful to consult the Integrated Taxonomic Information System for name clarifications."
