        "text": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a liver disease affecting people who drink little to no alcohol. As the name implies, the main characteristics of NAFLD is too much fat stored in liver cells. NAFLD is the most common liver disease in Canada affecting about 20% of Canadians.\n\nIt tends to develop in people who are overweight or obese, particularly if they have lot of fat around the middle of their body (waist). It can also develop in a person whose body weight is in the healthy weight range, but who typically eats a lot of sugary and fatty foods and who has extra fat around the waist. NAFLD has shown to be strongly associated with metabolic syndrome—a health disorder characterized by a group of risk factors (large waist circumference, high blood pressure, high blood sugar levels, high cholesterol, and abnormal amounts of lipids in the blood) that greatly increase the risk of many chronic illnesses.\n\nCauses\n\nThe most common cause of fatty liver disease in Canada is obesity. In 2018, almost 30% of Canadians 18 and older (roughly 7.3 million adults) reported height and weight that classified them as either overweight or obese.\n\nBesides obesity, nutritional causes of fatty liver disease are:\n\nStarvation and protein malnutrition\n\nLong-term use of total parenteral nutrition (a feeding procedure that involves infusing nutrients directly into the bloodstream)\n\nIntestinal bypass surgery for obesity\n\nRapid weight loss\n\nCertain conditions often accompany and may contribute to fatty liver disease:\n\nDiabetes mellitus\n\nHyperlipidemia (elevated lipids in the blood)\n\nInsulin resistance and high blood pressure\n\nOther causes include:\n\nGenetic factors\n\nDrugs and chemicals\n\nHow do we define “overweight” and “obese”?\n\nAlthough many people feel they could lose some weight, few would consider themselves obese. A widely-used measure to define “overweight” and “obese” is the Body Mass Index (BMI). A BMI is a calculation based on your height and weight that gives a number that reflects either a healthy or unhealthy weight.\n\nYou can use the following formula to calculate your BMI:\n\nBMI:\n\nWeight in kg\n\n________________\n\n(Height in meters)2\n\nExample: For someone who is 1.70 meters tall who weighs 80 kilograms…\n\nBMI = 80 ÷ (1.70 x 1.70) = 27.7\n\nClick here to access the BMI Calculator.\n\nNote: Different ethnic groups may differ slightly. For example, in Asian populations the healthy BMI is lower, ranging from 18 – 23.\n\nIt is important to note that the BMI is an indirect measure of body fat. It does not take into account muscle mass, bone density, overall body composition, and racial and sex differences.\n\nDoes the size of your waist matter?\n\nExcess abdominal fat is associated with fatty liver disease and other health risks such as diabetes. Waist measurements−which differ according to gender—are used to identify the health risks associated with excess abdominal fat.\n\nFor men, health risks increase if your waist circumference is more than 102 cm (40 in.)\n\nFor women, health risks increase if your waist circumference is more than 88 cm (35 in.)\n\nIt is important to measure your waist circumference in a consistent way. The best way to do this is:\n\nWrap a measuring tape around yourself at a level 2 cm higher than your belly button.\n\nThe tape should be snug but not pressing into your bare skin.\n\nRelax, exhale, and read the measurement.\n\nHow does fat get into the liver?\n\nFat and sugars from a person’s diet are usually broken down by the liver and other tissues. If the amount of fat or simple sugar intake exceeds what is required by the body, fat is stored in the fatty tissue. Other reasons for the accumulation of fat in the liver could be the transfer of fat from other parts of the body or the inability of the liver to change it into a form that can be eliminated.\n\nSymptoms\n\nIn general, people with fatty liver disease have no symptoms. However, some people report discomfort in the abdomen at the level of the liver, fatigue, a general feeling of being unwell, and vague discomfort.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nFatty liver disease is usually suspected in people who are overweight and obese (particularly those with large waist circumferences), who have evidence of dyslipidemia (high cholesterol and lipids in the blood), insulin resistance and/or abnormal liver tests.\n\nAn ultrasound or Fibroscan® of the liver can show the presence of a fatty liver. In some cases, your doctor may advise a liver biopsy, a procedure where the physician inserts a needle into the liver and extracts sample tissue, which is then examined under a microscope.\n\nNASH stands for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and is the more serious form of NAFLD. NASH affects almost 1.5 million Canadians, even those who drink little or no alcohol. Not only can NASH cause liver scarring, called fibrosis, but about 1 out of 5 adults with NASH can develop potential damage to liver function called cirrhosis.\n\nNASH patients are also at greater risk of liver cancer, and for about 1 out of 10 people with NASH, it may lead to liver failure and the need for a liver transplant.\n\nWhat’s the difference between NASH and NAFLD?\n\nWhile a simple fatty liver is a rather benign condition, NASH is often associated with ongoing liver damage and can lead to cirrhosis of the liver, liver cancer, and the need for a liver transplant.\n\nSymptoms\n\nAs with NAFLD, people with NASH generally have limited symptoms. Although rare, some children may present with vomiting and tenderness of an enlarged liver.\n\nWhat could happen to people with NASH?\n\nCurrently, the long-term outlook of people with NASH is not well understood. In most cases, NASH seems to be a slowly progressive disease. However, there is a small proportion of NASH patients whose cirrhosis will become more severe, possibly leading to liver cancer or liver failure. In chronic liver failure, a liver transplant may be needed.\n\nTreatment of NAFLD and NASH\n\nWhen there is a buildup of simple fat, the liver becomes vulnerable to further injury, which may result in liver inflammation and scarring. The treatment of fatty liver disease is related to the cause. At this time, it is not possible to predict which patients will develop NASH.\n\nOptimal treatment for NAFLD and NASH has not yet been established. People are advised to address their risk factors (i.e., to improve their blood sugar control/monitoring if they are diabetic and to achieve gradual and sustained weight loss).\n\nIt is usually recommended that those diagnosed with NASH should avoid drinking alcohol. Lifestyle modification and excellent control of other illnesses are important for all patients with NAFLD and NASH.\n\nCurrently, there is no proven treatment with medication for NAFLD and NASH. Since it is now such a common health condition, NASH has raised much interest in the scientific community. There are numerous clinical trials for various treatments of NASH and several promising drug therapies that are anticipated to pave the way for new and more effective treatment options.\n\nCan children develop fatty liver disease?\n\nFatty liver disease is now becoming evident in children, due in large part to an alarming increase in childhood obesity. Currently:\n\nIt is estimated that one Canadian child in 10 is overweight, a number that has almost tripled in the last decade.\n\nIn Canada, fatty liver disease is thought to occur in one in five overweight or obese children.\n\nFatty liver disease affects almost 3% of children and 25–55% of obese children.\n\nFatty liver disease can be found in children as young as two years of age.\n\nFatty liver disease can also occur in children with healthy body weights but who may have larger waist circumferences than other children of the same weight and height.\n\nFatty liver disease is more common in boys than girls and tends to occur in children of Caucasian or South Asian ancestry.\n\nFatty liver disease is more common in children who have family members with fatty livers or type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe cause of fatty liver disease is understood to be related to factors such as diets high in fatty foods and simple sugars and inactive lifestyles, particularly in children or adolescents who are overweight or obese.\n\nIn childhood, a fatty liver can be caused by a variety of disorders including those related to problems with copper metabolism (e.g., Wilson Disease), viral hepatitis, or a variety of autoimmune diseases. It is very important that your doctor makes sure that your child does not have these conditions first.\n\nNAFLD can only be diagnosed in children after all other potential causes of fatty liver have been ruled out. If your doctor or healthcare provider thinks your child may be at risk for NAFLD, they may order some blood tests and an ultrasound of the abdomen to determine whether your child has NAFLD or not. Consult your doctor about what types of tests your child needs to undergo to determine if your child has NAFLD.\n\nWhen it comes to children, measuring waist circumference and your child’s height can help you determine if your child is depositing extra fat around the middle of their body. It is important to measure your child’s waist circumference, in the same way, each time it is done.\n\nThe exact number that you get for a child’s waist circumference is not what is important, as each child grows at different rates and so each child may have a different number. A general rule of thumb is to measure the ratio between your child’s waist circumference and their height (in centimetres). A ratio greater than 0.5 may mean that the child is depositing a little extra fat around their middle. However, it does NOT mean your child has NAFLD.\n\nWaist-to-height ratio = WC (cm)\n\nHeight (cm)\n\nHealthy Body Weights for Children\n\nThe best tool to decide if your child’s body weight is in the healthy range is to plot your child’s weight and body mass index (BMI) on growth curves. A healthy body weight is when your child’s weight or BMI falls between the third percentile and the 95th percentile. If your child’s BMI is above the 95th percentile then your child is obese. If your child’s BMI is between the 85th percentile and 95th percentile, they may be overweight.\n\nIt is important to follow the ‘trend’ of where your child is ‘tracking’ on the growth curve and not just one point in time. Remember your child is growing and so you should expect that your child’s BMI will change with time.\n\nBMI is calculated exactly like adults. Your child’s weight (in kg) divided by your child’s height (in meters) squared."
