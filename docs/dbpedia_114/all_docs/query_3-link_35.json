        "text": "Rising in elevation from 690 feet at the Williamstown parking lot to more than 1,100 feet, Mountain Meadow Preserve provides multiple natural habitats and rich ecology: it’s home to bears, coyotes, bobcats, fox, and deer as well as wetland amphibians and numerous small mammals and reptiles. Meanwhile, the meadow’s mix of flowers and grasses, including aster, little bluestem, and fringed gentian, attracts a variety of butterflies. From the meadow, peek through a forested ridge and enjoy mountain vistas across 240 acres.\n\nHike the four miles of trails and gather your own special memories, like watching a butterfly light on a wildflower, or catching the cry of a red-tailed hawk as it soars overhead. From the broad meadow a few hundred yards beyond the parking lot, enjoy a view of the Hoosac Valley that includes both Williamstown church spires and Mount Greylock.\n\nClimb a half-mile loop trail to a hilltop, where you can also continue your hike into the Pownal, Vermont side of the reservation. And if you prefer your vistas without the uphill walk, enter the reservation from the Pownal parking lot, meander along a network of flat trails to a woods road leading to the ruins of Mausert’s Camp, a circa-1970s rustic family getaway.\n\nMason Street, Williamstown, MA 01267\n\nBenedict Road, Pownal, VT 05261\n\nE-mail: info@thetrustees.org\n\nGet directions on Google Maps.\n\nWilliamstown, MA parking area: From the intersection of Rts. 2 and 7 in Williamstown, take Rt. 7 north for 1.7 mi. Bear right onto Mason St. (steep dirt road uphill) and follow to entrance and parking (10 cars).\n\nPownal, VT parking area: From the intersection of Rts. 2 and 7 in Williamstown, follow Rt. 7 north 1.7 mi., turn right onto Sand Spring Rd., then bear right onto Bridges Rd. Follow for 0.3 mi., turn left onto White Oaks Rd., and follow for 1.1 mi. when road becomes dirt. Continue for 0.4 mi., bear left at fork onto Benedict Rd., and continue 0.1 mi. to entrance and parking (8 cars) on left."
