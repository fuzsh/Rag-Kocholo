        "text": "Originally published July 2014; updated May 2024.\n\nHummingbirds are special. They’re brilliant, tiny, precision-flying creatures that glitter like jewels in the sun and dazzle with their aerial acrobatics. They’re glorious to watch, flying fast, stopping instantly, hovering, and zipping up, down, or backwards with exquisite control.\n\nHummingbirds live only in the Americas. They have a unique shoulder anatomy that enables them to beat their wings in a figure-eight pattern, creating lift on both up and down strokes. This skill coupled with the ability to beat their wings more than 3,000 times per minute is what enables their precision aerobatics. Some early European naturalists, on encountering hummingbirds for the first time, wondered if they were a cross between a bird and an insect.\n\nMore than a dozen species of hummingbirds regularly summer in the United States. Canada is home to 5 species, while Mexico has about 60 species. All in all, there are more than 360 hummingbird species in the world.\n\nWatch for These 9 Hummingbird Species\n\nIf you’re in the U.S. or Canada and looking for hummingbirds, these nine are the most widespread and commonly seen:\n\nMore Scintillating Species from the Southwestern U.S.\n\nIf you’re lucky enough to live in—or to visit—southern Arizona, New Mexico, or Texas, the list of potential hummingbirds nearly doubles. This area is undoubtedly the hummingbird hotspot of the U.S.—a must-visit location if you want to be dazzled by the sight of a busy feeder garden. Regulars include Blue-throated Mountain-gem and Broad-billed, Lucifer, Rivoli’s, and Violet-crowned Hummingbirds, among others.\n\nThe Secret of their sparkle: how iridescence works\n\nIt’s the mind-bending diversity of the hummingbird color palette that really sets the family apart from other birds. As a group, hummingbirds are more colorful than all other bird species put together, according to a 2022 study. That includes searing magentas, shimmering purple-and-green, night-sky violets, and iridescent rainbows that even incorporate ultraviolet colors humans can’t see.\n\nThe dazzling colors are created not by pigments but by precisely sized, perfectly arranged, microscopic bubbles in the structure of the hummingbirds’ feathers. It’s the same general process that gives blue to birds like California Scrub-Jays and a rainbow sheen to birds like Common Grackles. But in hummingbirds the structural colors take the complexity to another level, allowing the birds to create fiery jolts of color when the feathers are turned to just the right angle. For an illustrated explanation of how this works in detail, see What Is the Essence of Iridescence? (Living Bird Summer 2023).\n\nWith 360+ Species, There Are So Many More Hummingbirds to Meet\n\nWe’ve highlighted barely more than a dozen species of hummingbirds so far—there are hundreds more species to discover. And though the above species are familiar to many birders in North America, it’s no secret that Central and South America take top honors when it comes to dazzling hummingbirds, with at least 60 species in Panama and well over 100 species in each of Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador."
