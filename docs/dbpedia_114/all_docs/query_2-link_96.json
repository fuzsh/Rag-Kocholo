So for the next time you visit Aster we have put together a few of our favourite things to get up to around the area.\n\nTheaters\n\nJust a stone throw away from Aster we have two of London’s most famous theaters, London Apollo and Victoria Palace. At London Apollo you can watch world famous production, Wicked which tells the story of “two unlikely friends, Elphaba and Galinda who struggle through opposing personalities and viewpoints, rivalry over the same love-interest, reactions to the corrupt government, and, ultimately, Elphaba’s private fall from grace.” Learn more here\n\nRight next door to Aster you can watch Hamilton An American Musical which is sung and rapped-through written by Lin-Manuel Miranda. It tells the story of American Founding Fatger Alexander Hamilton. Learn more here\n\nWhen heading to the theaters, be sure to visit Aster and enjoy our pre and post dining menus. View here.\n\nShopping\n\nLooking to shop till you drop? But prefer somewhere a little quieter than the hustle and bustle of central? Well head to Victoria and make the most of Victoria Place or Cardinal place where you can find an array of retail stores including Jo Malone, Marks and Spencer plus much more."
