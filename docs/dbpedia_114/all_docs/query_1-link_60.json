As it develops, it takes on adult colouration.\n\nLarvae: 25 – 32 mm long at maturity, creamy white in colour, brown head, flat, broad shaped body; 10-segmented abdomen (bell-shaped segments) and a fork-like appendage on the tip of the abdomen.\n\nLife Cycle\n\nAdult beetles actively feed on host plant foliage throughout their lives. Adults lay eggs in crevices on host tree bark or under bark scales; peak oviposition period typically occurs between late June and early July in temperate regions (Bauer et al., 2004) but may vary depending on factors such as latitude and local climate. To hatch, larvae chew through the side of the egg that is stuck to the bark, and bore into the sapwood, phloem, or cambium part of the bark, where they form pupal chambers and overwinter. When EAB populations become large enough, larval feeding under the bark girdles the tree, eventually leading to tree death. Pupation occurs in the early spring. When development is complete, the adult EAB will chew out of the bark of the tree, leaving a distinctive D-shaped exit hole in the bark (Bauer et al., 2004). Adult EAB begin to emerge from trees in late spring, depending on temperature, and are able to fly immediately after emergence.\n\nCold Tolerance\n\nPrevious research indicated that EAB larvae could not survive below -35.3 C. However, EAB may still be able to survive these cold conditions based on several specific factors and recent research into phenotypic plasticity indicates they could survive temperatures that are much colder. Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of an organism to change its traits in response to the environment without the need for changes at the genetic level. Extreme phenotypic plasticity of cold tolerance allowed the EAB in this new study to adapt to Canadian winters and survive temperatures as low as -50 C! These findings mean that EAB have the potential to survive some of the harshest winters in regions where their host trees grow.\n\nEconomic Impacts\n\nAsh trees provide many benefits within urban environments, such as increased property values, windbreaks, temperature regulation, pollution abatement, runoff prevention, and provision of wildlife habitat. With extensive ash tree mortality caused by EAB, the cost of replacing such services can be immense for municipalities. Further, the cost of treating infested trees, removing damaged and dead trees, and replanting where trees have been lost have already been very large (NRCan, 2014). You can calculate the cost estimate of treating vs. removing your ash tree by visiting the Canadian Forest Service Ash Projection Model (CFS-APM).\n\nThe City of Toronto, for example, estimates that it will cost the city $37 million over five years to cut and replace the city-owned ash trees that are killed by the insect. Further, as of 2012, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency had already spent over $30 million to manage the invasion of EAB and had cut over 30,000 trees to slow the spread of the beetle (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, 2012). Over the next decade, some estimates suggest that 17 million trees will need to be removed and replaced within communities in the U.S. alone. This would cost approximately $10.7 billion, but could double if both urban and rural land is taken into account (Kovacs et al, 2010).\n\nAsh is also commonly used for commercial lumber, pulp, tool handles, furniture and crating (Cappaert, 2005). Loss of ash could have a significant impact on these industries. As described in Poland and McCullough (2006), ash comprises approximately 7.5% of total hardwood saw-timber volume in the U.S., with a stumpage value of at least $25.1 billion (Federal Register, 2003).\n\nPhoto: David Cappaert bugwood.org\n\nAsh trees removed from an urban area in response to an emerald ash borer infestation. Urban tree removal comes at a high economic and ecological cost for municipalities across infested areas. The City of Toronto alone anticipates costs of $37 million to cut and replace ash trees throughout the city, resulting in loss of aesthetic value to neighbourhoods, and a loss of ecological services that the trees provide.\n\nEcological Impacts\n\nEmerald ash borer has already done extensive damage to ash tree populations in North America, killing millions of ash trees in Ontario, Quebec, and many U.S. states.\n\nAlthough the direct effects of EAB on ash trees are fairly conspicuous, the indirect or downstream ecological impacts of EAB are much more difficult to quantify. Some potential ecological impacts are as follows: changes to forest structure, altered canopy gaps, reduced coarse woody debris, altered biogeochemical and nutrient cycling, and altered ecological interactions among organisms (both aquatic and terrestrial). Specifically, populations of native species that have specialized interactions with the threatened host, such as terrestrial arthropod species with a high level of association with ash, might be at increased risk (Gandhi and Herms 2010). Poland and McCullough (2006) suggest that the loss of green and black ash, which dominate riparian corridors and poorly drained sites, respectively, could produce the most significant ecological impacts.\n\nPhoto: Steven Katovich, Bugwood.org\n\nCanopy openings caused by EAB damage can increase light penetration to the forest floor, and make the area more susceptible to understory plant invasions.\n\nSocial Impacts\n\nThe aesthetic and recreational values that people place on forests and parks could be negatively impacted by EAB, since many ash trees within these natural areas have already died, or are susceptible to EAB infestation. Ash is a commonly planted street and park tree, and the loss of mature trees will negatively impact the aesthetic value of residential neighbourhoods and urban greenspace.\n\nPhoto: Daniel Herms, The Ohio State University, Bugwood.org\n\nA mature ash tree is removed from a residential neighbourhood after being attacked by the emerald ash borer. Urban areas are at high risk to EAB infestations, as ash trees line many streets, and are commonly found in parks, and urban greenspace.\n\nIn Ontario, EAB has become well established and its distribution continues to increase from natural spread of the insect flying from tree to tree and from human-mediated spread through movement of infested ash materials. Management efforts no longer focus on eradication of the insect from Canada, as this is not a realistic outcome. Control efforts are focusing on slowing the spread of EAB and striving to contain the infestation to currently infested and quarantined sites (NRCan, 2013).\n\nPrevent\n\nPrevention of an emerald ash borer infestation in a new area is the most effective way to reduce long-term impacts. To assist in preventing an EAB infestation, follow these tips:\n\nDon’t move firewood, as EAB larvae could be hiding inside\n\nLearn to identify an EAB, its signs and symptoms\n\nSpread the word: educate family and friends of the potential threat\n\nReport any sightings\n\nDetect\n\nDetection is an essential step once emerald ash borer is suspected to be in a new area. Quick detection and identification of the pest allows for rapid response and treatment.\n\nThere are two main methods of detection used for emerald ash borer:\n\n1. Detection Trapping\n\nDetection traps baited with plant volatiles and/or pheromone lures are placed on host trees, and if EAB is present in the vicinity of the tree, individuals may become trapped, and collected by surveyors.\n\n2. Branch Sampling\n\nBranches are removed from a potential host tree, and inspected using specific guidelines for the presence of EAB larvae below the bark. Branch sampling allows for detection of the pest even at low population densities.\n\nLearn how to perform both of these detection methods using the instructional videos below:\n\nBranch Sampling for Emerald Ash Borer\n\nLearn how to detect an emerald ash borer infestation using the branch sampling technique\n\nFor more information on branch sampling for EAB, see Detection of emerald ash borer in urban environments using branch sampling (Ryall et al., 2011)\n\nRespond & Control\n\nThere are several control methods currently being used to contain EAB to infested sites within Southern Ontario:\n\nMechanical EAB infested trees can be cut down and their wood either burned or buried. This method is used particularly where the infestation centre is small, and strives to reduce EAB populations and slow their spread to surrounding areas (NRCan, 2013).\n\nChemical\n\nIn Canada, chemical control of EAB is undertaken using a systemic insecticide with one of three active ingredients (imidacloprid, acephate, and azadirachtin) which is directly injected into the trunk of a recently infested tree, or a tree that is susceptible to infestation (NRCan, 2013). There are four injectable insecticides registered in Canada for use against EAB. These chemicals are injected into the tree trunk and are then transported in the conductive tissues (xylem and phloem) upwards through the tree. Even if a tree is injected with the insecticide, it may take several years to fully recover from the EAB infestation, and re-treatment may be needed to prevent additional infestations. For best results, the insecticide should be injected prior to infestation, or as soon after infestation as possible, and during adult EAB emergence in the late spring or early summer (OMAFRA, 2013)\n\nPhoto: Emmett- Muennink, https://www.farmprogress.com/conservation/injecting-ash-trees-protect-emerald-ash-borer. A technician injects an infested ash tree with insecticide to control emerald ash borer\n\nBiological\n\nIn Canada, four species of wasps have been approved for use as biological control agents of EAB. These parasitoids are being used in an attempt to control the spread of EAB and to reduce its population. Three species have been released in Canada (Tetrastichus planipennisi, Spathius galinae, and Oobius agrili), the fourth species (Spathius agrili) has not been released as research has shown it would not be able to successfully establish a population in a Canadian climate. These wasps do not sting humans and their impacts on other native species are being closely monitored after release (CFIA, 2013).\n\nPhoto: David Cappaert, Bugwood.org\n\nPhoto: Bill McNee, Wisconsin Dept of Natural Resources, Bugwood.org\n\nThe Eulophid wasp (Tetrastichus planipennisi), pictured above, is being released for biological control of EAB."
