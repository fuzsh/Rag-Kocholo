        "text": "Facts: Aster\n\nFamily: Asteraceae\n\nGenus: Aster\n\nCommon name: Michaelmas Daisy\n\nOrigin: 250 species from throughout the northern hemisphere and South America.\n\nCulture: Most garden asters thrive in well drained, full to partial sun and regular summer water.\n\nPests & Diseases: Asters are generally pest free. Powdery mildew & rust are the major diseases. If this occurs remove the infected foliage (if possible) and spray the plant with copper or other fungicide.\n\nLess common problems with asters include verticillium wilt, leaf spot, and leafhoppers (which transmit disease).\n\nMaintenance: Asters can commonly flop in the garden by the time they are blooming. To avoid this, simply prune back by one half to two thirds in early to mid June. This practice often results in more flowers as well. Plants should be divided every two to three years to maintain a healthy stand.\n\nOnce the plants turn yellow in the fall, cut to the ground. Fertilize in spring with an all-purpose slow release food.\n\nAdditional qualities: Attracts bees, butterflies and other pollinators. Deer resistant. Great cut flowers. Long, late season bloom.\n\nPropagation: Asters can be propagated by seed, division or cuttings all best done in spring. Seeds can be sown indoors two weeks before the last frost or directly outdoors after the last frost. Seed grown asters will bloom in their second year.\n\nDivision of thick plants will allow for more air circulation, which makes the plant less prone to powdery mildew. Use basal shoots or stems up to 2” long for cuttings. Keep cuttings moist until thoroughly rooted."
