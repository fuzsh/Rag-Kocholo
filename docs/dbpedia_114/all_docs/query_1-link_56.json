        "text": "Everyone knows the honey bee, but did you know that there are over 20,000 different species of bee in the world and that there are some 4,000 species that live in the US and Canada alone? In fact, honey bees (Apis species) are actually not native to North America but originated in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Bees are incredibly important insects whose pollination services help plants produce some of our most popular foods, like blueberries and squash, and keep ecosystems functioning and healthy. Unfortunately, many species are in real trouble due to pesticide use in agriculture, habitat loss, and climate change.\n\nThe good news is that each of us can do something to help the bees in our own backyard.\n\nPesticides, herbicides, and fungicides are all bad news for bees. Pesticides come in many forms and some, such as neonicotinoids, are systemic, meaning that they make every part of the plant (including nectar and pollen) toxic to bees. To avoid harming bees in this way, avoid spraying, or if you need to control more pesty insect species, use organic or biocontrol agents. The more habitat you provide for insects in your garden, the more you invite beneficial insects and other invertebrates to appear and control your pests for you. You should also always ensure that any plants or seeds that you purchase were grown organically and without neonicotinoids. Remember, these pesticides never leave the plant and can make the ground that other plants grow in toxic as well for years to come.\n\nGood luck in your journey to making your garden more bee-friendly! It is truly a “build it and they will come” scenario. If you are interested in learning more about the bees that you see, consider downloading the free iPhone and Android app, Seek. Simply take a photo with your phone, post the location and image, and experts will not only use your photos for citizen science, but they will also provide you with an identification."
