        "text": "Many different species of native plants grow in Edmonton’s natural areas, and some of our native plants are less commonplace than others. I have already written about a few rare plants in past blog posts, including shooting star, round-leaved orchid, and spotted coralroot orchid. Each of these plants requires a specific environment to grow, and these environments are often limited in urban areas. Because Edmonton has preserved much of its river valley, our city is still home to a few unique plants including one I recently found growing in Mill Creek Ravine called Indian pipe.\n\nIndian pipe begins to emerge from the forest floor in mid to late summer. It can reach up to 10 inches in height. The plant is completely white, giving context to its other common name: corpse flower. The flowers of the plant face downward until they are fertilized. After fertilization the flowers point upward and begin to produce seed. Once the seed has matured the entire plant will turn black and begin to disperse its seed, which is extremely light and easily carried by air currents or water. Few of the seeds produced will germinate the following year as the seed requires a specific type of fungus to be present in order for it to grow.\n\nIndian pipe is often mistaken for a fungus, but it is indeed a member of the plant kingdom. Like other plants, it has roots, leaves and flowers, but unlike other plants it does not have any chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is the green pigment in plants that is required for photosynthesis – the process used by plants to synthesize food from sunlight. Since Indian pipe is unable to produce its own food, it must somehow obtain nutrients from a source outside of itself. It does this by attaching its roots to a fungus and taking nutrients from the fungus, making Indian pipe a parasitic plant.\n\nThe fungus that Indian pipe attaches itself to forms its own special relationship with certain trees. The fungus attaches its thread-like roots — called mycelium — to the roots of a tree and exchanges nutrients with the tree. This relationship is beneficial for both the tree and the fungus. Unlike the tree and fungus relationship, Indian pipe does not return any nutrients to its host. It simply takes what it needs to grow from the fungus, and therefore from the tree as well. The Indian pipe is a freeloader, and part of a group of parasitic plants that make up only one percent of the plant kingdom.\n\nIndian pipe is most commonly found in old forests with rich soils that are abundant in fungi. Mill Creek has deeply forested areas with rich soil that are conducive to the growth of this plant. It has also been sighted at Callingwood Treestand – one of Edmonton’s natural area parks. The Indian pipe is another shining example of the importance of preserving Edmonton’s natural areas.\n\nHave you seen any Indian pipe growing in Edmonton? If so, please leave a comment and let us know where!\n\nPhotos: Jason Teare"
