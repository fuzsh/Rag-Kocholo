        "text": "The Aster Companies Group aims to be an institution that makes a difference for employees and communities, offering a working environment that adapts to changing trends.\n\nAt Aster, which focuses on its employees’ development by following innovative training and practices, employee satisfaction and motivation are among the important elements. All communication with Aster employees is based on trust and transparency.\n\nThis experience manifests itself as a culture that cares about the needs and expectations of all stakeholders, always following development opportunities, and takes long-term and sustainable value creation as a principle.\n\nAster Textile’s human resources policy is centred around the principles of anti-discrimination, equality, fairness and objectivity. This policy is a key component of Aster’s corporate culture and is vital to achieving its goals and making a difference.\n\nPerformance Management\n\nAster considers human resources as critical to reaching its strategic goals and creating value. Investment in and improvement for its employees is always a high priority. Aster developed its performance management system with that perspective. Not simply a measurement tool that assesses numerical targets, the system also plays a key role in supporting Aster’s development culture. Employee performance is assessed both by their numerical targets and personal and occupational development; training and development plans are designed accordingly.\n\nAster bases its performance management system on the dissemination of corporate goals from the Senior Management to all employees. The results of this system, which is tracked as per competency, position and people, are used to determine the following year’s remuneration and execute personal development and career planning.\n\nTraining and Development Planning\n\nAster’s training and development activities are designed to support employees’ continuous improvement through their career journey and enhance their vision. Significant importance is attached to the personal training and development of all employees across the organisation. Resources are allocated for the training and development of each employee.\n\nPerformance management system results are assessed by considering many factors, including job position changes and feedback received during one-to-one interviews with human resources officers. Career development plans and personal development plans are made according to these results.\n\nIn addition to traditional classroom training, Aster Textile uses coaching, e-training programs, outdoor training programs and project tasks as development tools. Training programs are also organised to meet the technical development needs of the various departments.\n\nAster offers tuition discounts to employees pursuing a Master’s Degree as part of agreements made with select private universities.\n\nInternal Communications\n\nPeriodic year-end goal assessment meetings are organised at Aster Textile with the participation of the Senior Management, where business and performance results are evaluated. Employees are also informed about Aster’s strategic objectives for the coming year.\n\nAster Textile actively encourages employees to form a cohesive community, and also to spend and enjoy time together outside the workplace. The Aster staff community spirit is strengthened at terrace parties, departmental dinners, culture trips, spring festival picnics, year-end parties, campaigns of social activity groups with charitable associations and foundations, and similar events.\n\nTalent Management\n\nEach year, Aster participates in University Career Days where promising students are invited to join the Aster family. New graduates who join the Aster team, are included in a 6-month training program on personal and professional development. Subsequently, the new graduate hires are placed in their career positions in line with their interests and talents.\n\nEvery year, Aster forms a potential manager pool as a result of regular annual assessments. High potential employees, who are identified at Human Resources Planning Meetings, are provided special training and development opportunities and given support to prepare for their next-level position.\n\nSalary & Wage Management and Fringe Benefits\n\nAster Textile uses an international job evaluation system that enables all internal business units to align with the Aster wage management policy, based on their job positions. The system also helps measure their contribution in achieving corporate goals. The competitive wage policy is defined in line with the present wage structure, position in the market, competition and ability to pay. The policy is applied without discrimination on the basis of gender, religion, sect, race, skin colour, political view, sexual orientation or ethnic background.\n\nEmployee Loyalty and Satisfaction\n\nTo better understand the needs and expectations of Aster employees and take employee satisfaction to the highest level, Aster carries out regular Employee Satisfaction Surveys. At the end of these surveys, the opinions of employees on corporate perception, training, development, performance management, career planning, and internal opportunities are conveyed to Aster Textile Senior Management. Improvement plans are developed based on survey results. For new graduate employees, Aster administers the Beginners Survey to hear about their experience during the orientation process.\n\nAster is committed to creating and fostering a working environment where employees can have a say and actively participate in company operations. Aster’s Great Idea initiative solicits employee opinions and suggestions on business processes and work life in general; practical and implementable ideas are taken into consideration and evaluated. Aster has also adopted an open-door policy that provides employees the opportunity to communicate all their demands, requests, suggestions and opinions to the Human Resources Department."
