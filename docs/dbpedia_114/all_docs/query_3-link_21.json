Remember, a common wildflower like Black-eyed Susan is called Rudbeckia hirta. Rudbeckia is the “Genus” name. Hirta is the “Species.” You’ll find these two sub-divisions way down on this list.",

This huge group, with approximately 2/3 of all flowering plants, includes most all wildflowers. Dicots have \"net-veined\" leaves, which means they have the familiar leaves with center vein plus branching veins running from it."
