        "text": "A new space that seeks to become a European reference for sustainability, mobility, technology and design. An urban district that, beyond a functional occupation, will become a territory of experience focused on people, their desires and their behaviour. An intuitive, sensory, flexible and collaborative place that will activate the osmosis between people and nature, giving rise to a truly significant relationship. The opportunity to design a differentiating discourse that capitalizes on what really matters, connecting it with the attributes and benefits of the project.\n\nA brand that connects people with their environment and with themselves. A friendly and close graphic construction, a reflection of a sustainable and dynamic community. A simple aesthetic language, designed from the confluence of lines and points, which conveys the concept of innovation and interaction through three-dimensionality.\n\nThis strength is born from the typographic construction itself, and expands to the rest of the key elements of its imagery. The icon, for example, which can work with the logo or without it, reminds us of the “A” in the name, but at the same time it is interpreted as a free, volatile element that always looks upwards, in constant evolution and growth.\n\nFrom a chromatic point of view, a clear relationship has been established with the quality of the air in the area. The use of white and blue, which extends in the form of a gradient, projects the light of a day’s cycle. The image of a clean and transparent sky. Pure.\n\nIn short, a brand that seeks to establish an intimate link with the way of life of tomorrow. More aware, more respectful and at peace with ourselves and our environment."
