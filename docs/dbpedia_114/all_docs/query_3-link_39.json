View current design concepts (PDF).\n\nForest Bark Dog Park\n\nMarch 2024 Update: The Park Planning team is evaluating alternative locations for Forest Bark Dog Park, which is a new dog park originally planned to be built at Harold Bacchus Community Park on the south side of the football field. The team is also waiting for additional community input that will be gathered through the upcoming Park and Open Space Master Plan, which kicks off in the next few weeks.\n\nGrand Park\n\nGrand Park is a world-class urban oasis designed to welcome all Frisco residents and visitors to an intentionally designed community space that invites all ages and abilities to play, explore, discover, and connect. When complete, the park will span 1,011 acres from the Dallas North Tollway west to Lake Lewisville and FM423.\n\nIn 2023, we partnered with IDEO, a global design consultancy, to create a vision for Grand Park, which will be located in the center of Frisco. In January 2024, Frisco City Council developed a vision and formally adopted a set of Guiding Principles for the development of this unique park. Read a summary of the Vision for Grand Park (PDF).\n\nIn January 2024, we partnered with consulting agency Design Workshop to conduct a site analysis for Grand Park in light of the adopted vision. This analysis is full of ideas and possibilities for the park. More concrete concepts and plans will be developed and shared in the coming months. View the Grand Park Site Analysis and Framework - January 2024 (PDF)\n\nMore updates coming soon! In the meantime, you can explore Big Bluestem Trail in the undeveloped future site of Grand Park.\n\nKaleidoscope Park\n\nKaleidoscope Park is situated within Hall Park adjacent to State Highway 121 and the Dallas North Tollway. Kaleidoscope Park will be home to year-round immersive and diverse free public programming, including films, concerts, fitness and well-being activities, and cultural music and dance festivals. The park will also include monumental works of public art, architecture, and gardens set among a childrenâ€™s play area, dog park, performance lawns, technology terraces, and shaded promenades and plaza.\n\nConstruction is underway and the park is expected to open in Spring 2024.\n\nKaleidoscope Park is owned by the City of Frisco and operated by the Kaleidoscope Park Foundation as a nonprofit, public-private partnership among City of Frisco, Communities Foundation of Texas, and Kaleidoscope Park Foundation.\n\nVisit the park's website to see design concepts and the latest updates.\n\nNorthwest Community Park and Frisco on the Green Park\n\nNorthwest Community Park and Frisco on the Green Park are both located north of Panther Creek Parkway along Teel Parkway near the PGA of America headquarters and golf courses. These sites are part of the City of Frisco Parks and Recreation Open Space Master Plan (PDF) and will serve as an important link to existing trails as shown on the recently revised Hike and Bike Trail Master Plan (PDF). The city aims to include certain elements of these plans into a new vision for the parks. These elements include:\n\nactive and passive play elements\n\nhike/bike trails and mountain bike trails\n\n55-acres of existing mountain bike trails retrofitted into a state-of-the-art bike course (Northwest Community Park)\n\na focus on preserving existing views and sightlines\n\nnature and natural resources education\n\nExplore the current plans and concept designs.\n\nRogers Settlement Park\n\nRogers Settlement Park (formerly Davis Park) will be a new neighborhood park located between the multifamily housing community and Memorial High School adjacent to Eldorado Pkwy and Research Road. The park is approximately 11 acres in size and will also add trail connections on both the east and west sides of the property, which is a part of the Hike and Bike Master Plan.
