        "text": "By early August during a heat wave, I spent a couple of hours working on removing Black Medic or Hop clover Medicago lupulina one plant at a time. It is easiest to remove when the stem is long enough to twirl around my finger, then pull. It doesn’t require any tools. It can be easily removed if the soil has been soaked. There is quite a bit in some patches of grass that survived zeroscaping. When there is a lot of hop clover in a lawn it means the soil lacks nitrogen. Hop clover is a nitrogen fixer and bees also use it to make honey.\n\nThe invasive plant that is the hardest to eradicate is the Creeping bellflower or Evil Twin Campanula rapunculoides. I once dug out a root the size of a parsnip 3 feet down. In Calgary it is listed as an invasive plant by the City of Calgary Parks Department. It has many names in Calgary Rover Bellflower, Garden Bluebell, Creeping Bluebell, Purple Bell, Garden Harebell, Creeping Campanula and even the evil twin. Home owners can be fined it they do not remove this beautiful but invasive plant. I pull it out constantly but I even found three flowering plants under my cherry tree hiding beside the delphineum.\n\nChickweed Stellaria media is easily removed manually plant by plant, and easily identified but it keeps coming back. It is edible in salads. The flower is star-shaped- stellar/star. The Latin word, Media, means between or mid-sized.\n\nQuackgrass, couch grass, Elymus repens is a long, wide leaf grass that has a rough texture to the touch. It is the most invasive plants at our community garden. It takes the most volunteer hours to remove. Like clover, it is easier to pull when the soil is moistened. Like clover it can be easily uprooted one plant at at time, by tracing the stalk to its base. If you continue to trace and gently pull the the long white rhizome underground, you can uproot several plants at the same time. When we were preparing the guilds early on, we would uncover tangled mats of white roots deep into the soil. New plants grow quickly from even a piece of these white roots.\n\nBindweed can grow 4′ long and has deep roots. Its long vine chokes surrounding plants.\n\nBroadleaf Plantain (Plantago major) is an invasive plant now. It was introduced to Canada as it has both medicinal and culinary uses. Its height is 24″ inches and width 12″.\n\nCrabgrass or quackgrass Digitaria Sanguinalis is an annual low-growing grass. Crabgrass chokes out surrounding grass and plants. The blades of crabgrass are broader than other lawn grasses and feel rough to the touch. Crabgrass is very nutritious and was brought to North America by the early arrivals. It can be foraged by hand. It is often planted for hay.\n\nThe dandelion Taraxacum Officinale is no longer the most invasive plant in the garden. When the building next door replaced the empty lot beside us, the battle with dandelions almost completely ended. I use my Lee Valley All-Purpose Lifetime Weeder and pull the plant roots and all, one at a time.\n\nCanada thistle Cirsium arvense is classified as a primary noxious weed seed in the Weed Seeds Order 2005 in Canada.\n\nIn their article article “Grow or Throw“, the Calgary Horticultural Society included Polygonum aviculare Prostrate Knotweed on their list and described it as a “low-growing perennial that is an invasive weed that releases toxins in the soil when it is not managed. You may identify this weed by its wiry stem and the ovular shape of its leaves. The size of the leaves ranges from 0.5 to 2 centimetres. The roots of the weed have been found to grow long and up to 76 centimetres. Additionally, they also possess light colored flowers. Compacted soil and poor aeration often lead to the growth of this weed. The weed also houses hazardous parasites, viruses, and fungi such as powdery mildew, therefore it is recommended that this weed is thrown away.”"
