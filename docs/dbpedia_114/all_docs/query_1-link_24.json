        "text": "There are hundreds of different wildflowers found in Alberta!\n\nBecause of the vast amount of species, it can be really hard to correctly identify one that you found. In addition, there are numerous cultivars and hybrids you may come across that probably originated at a local garden center.\n\nThese facts make it difficult to put together a list of wildflowers in Alberta. üôÇ\n\nRegardless, I did my best to find the most common and widespread species. To make the list easier to navigate, I have organized the wildflowers below by color. Click the links below to go directly to that section.\n\nBlue\n\nPurple\n\nPink\n\nYellow\n\nWhite\n\nRed and Orange\n\nPlease remember these two things as you read:\n\nThis list is not a recommendation of plants you should plant in your yard. It is an ID guide to wildflowers you may encounter. While many of the wildflowers below would make excellent additions to your gardens, there are also various species that are invasive and should be avoided and destroyed if it starts growing on your property.\n\nDetermining the color of some wildflowers is a matter of opinion. For example, certain species may appear purplish-blue to me, so I included it in the ‚ÄúBlue Wildflowers‚Äù section, but you think it‚Äôs more of a blue-purple, and it belongs under ‚ÄúPurple Wildflowers.‚Äù\n\nHere are 32 common types of wildflowers in Alberta:\n\nBLUE WILDFLOWERS:\n\nView a complete list of BLUE wildflowers in Alberta HERE.\n\n#1. Chicory\n\nCichorium intybus\n\nGrowing Information\n\nUSDA Hardiness Zone: 3-10\n\nLife Cycle: Perennial\n\nApproximate mature size: 1-4‚Ä≤ (30-120 cm)\n\nBloom Time: Summer, Fall\n\nSun Exposure: Full Sun\n\nThis non-native wildflower is found throughout Alberta.\n\nTypically you will find this plant where it‚Äôs sunny and dry, so look for it along roads and open fields.\n\nThe exciting thing about Chicory is that you can eat it! The leaves are high in vitamins and minerals. You can eat the leaves as a vegetable or in a salad, but beware, they are very bitter tasting. The roots can also be boiled and eaten with butter. Sometimes the root is roasted and ground as a substitute or additive to coffee.\n\nInterestingly, Chicory flowers only bloom for ONE day. And in hot weather, the flower may only be open for a few hours!\n\n#2. Blue Vervain\n\nVerbena hastata\n\nAlso known as the American Vervain or Swamp Verbena.\n\nGrowing Information\n\nUSDA Hardiness Zone: 3-9\n\nLife Cycle: Perennial\n\nApproximate mature size: 2-5‚Ä≤ (60-150cm)\n\nBloom Time: Early Summer-Fall\n\nSun Exposure: Full Sun\n\nLook for this hardy and drought-resistant wildflower in Alberta in plains, foothills, wet soils, ditches, shores, and wet fields.\n\nThe Blue Vervain attracts various native bees, honeybees, beneficial wasps, small butterflies, skippers, and moths. It is also a great host plant because the Verbena Moth and the Common Buckeye Butterfly caterpillars feed on the leaves.\n\nRELATED: 34 Host Plants For Butterflies & Caterpillars (UPDATED)\n\n#3. Bachelor‚Äôs Button\n\nCentaurea cyanus\n\nAlso known as Cornflower.\n\nGrowing Information\n\nUSDA Hardiness Zone: 2-4\n\nLife Cycle: Annual\n\nApproximate mature size: 1-3‚Ä≤ (30-90cm)\n\nBloom Time: Late Spring-Late Summer\n\nSun Exposure: Full Sun to Light Shade\n\nThis common wildflower is a magnet for butterflies in Alberta. In addition, it‚Äôs excellent for cutting and drying.\n\nThe Bachelor‚Äôs Button flowers are daisy-like and virtually pest and disease-free. And can you believe they are also deer and drought tolerant?! I recommend this easy-to-grow plant for borders of flower beds or rock gardens.\n\nPURPLE WILDFLOWERS:\n\nView a complete list of PURPLE wildflowers in Alberta HERE\n\n#4. Bull Thistle\n\nCirsium vulgare\n\nAlso known as Boar Thistle, Common Thistle, Dodder, and Spear Thistle.\n\nGrowing Information\n\nUSDA Hardiness Zone: 3a-8b\n\nLife Cycle: Biennial\n\nApproximate mature size: 2-6‚Ä≤ (.6-1.8 m)\n\nBloom Time: Summer, Fall\n\nSun Exposure: Full Sun, Sun to Partial Shade\n\nBull Thistle is a common wildflower in Alberta.\n\nBut be careful when handling it because it‚Äôs spiny!\n\nThe seeds of this thistle are an excellent food source for goldfinches. However, these birds also use the thistledown to line their nests; thus, they wait until the flowers bloom in late summer to raise their young. In addition, it‚Äôs also a great flower if you want to attract giant bees and butterflies.\n\nRELATED: 4 Simple Ways To Attract Goldfinches!\n\n#5. Common Burdock\n\nArctium minus\n\nAlso known as Lesser Burdock, Little Burdock, Louse-bur, Button-bur, Cuckoo-button, and Wild Rhubarb.\n\nGrowing Information:\n\nUSDA Hardiness Zone: 4a-10b\n\nLife Cycle: Biennial\n\nApproximate mature size: 4-6‚Ä≤ (120-180 cm)\n\nBloom Time: Mid Summer ‚Äì Mid Fall\n\nSun Exposure: Sun to Partial Shade\n\nLook for this wildflower in Alberta in pastures, open prairies, hayfields, roadsides, old fields, barnyards, railways, and other disturbed areas.\n\nCommon Burdock has large leaves and deep purple flowers resembling rhubarb, making it easy to identify. After the flower head dries, they are similar to velcro because they stick onto humans and animals to transport the entire seed head!\n\nThis wildflower attracts bees, butterflies, and birds. But be careful if you handle this plant; it may cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction.\n\nRELATED: 22 PROVEN Flowers That Attract BEES!\n\n#6. Bee Balm\n\nMonarda fistulosa\n\nBuy/View Seeds HERE!\n\nAlso known as Wild Bergamot, Horsemint, and Wild Bee Balm.\n\nGrowing Information\n\nUSDA Hardiness Zone: 3a-9b\n\nLife Cycle: Perennial\n\nApproximate mature size: 2-4‚Ä≤ (60-120 cm)\n\nBloom Time: Summer\n\nSun Exposure: Sun to Partial Shade\n\nThis perennial has beautiful lilac-purple blooms. Bee Balm can be found in dry areas of fields, prairies, and along roads in Alberta.\n\nThe main reason that I grow Bee Balm in my flower garden is to attract hummingbirds, butterflies, and pollinator bees. When this NATIVE perennial is in full bloom, birds and insects can‚Äôt resist visiting the nectar-rich flowers. Many people claim that Bee Balm is so effective at drawing in hummingbirds that they no longer have to worry about filling their feeders!\n\n32 Common Flowers That Attract Hummingbirds! (Native, Easy To Grow)\n\nInterestingly, Bee Balm leaves make a refreshing tea that provides many health benefits, as its antimicrobial properties help ward off colds and the flu.\n\n#7. Creeping Charlie\n\nGlechoma hederacea\n\nAlso known as Gill-over-ground, Ground Ivy, Hedgemaids, Field Balm, Tunhoof, Catsfoot, Run-away-robin, and Alehoof.\n\nGrowing Information\n\nUSDA Hardiness Zone: 3a-10b\n\nLife Cycle: Perennials\n\nApproximate mature size: 5-8‚Ä≥ (12.5-20 cm)\n\nBloom Time: Spring, Summer\n\nSun Exposure: Sun to Partial Shade\n\nThis wildflower grows in large groups in moist semi-shaded areas and tolerates the sun very well. Bees especially love collecting pollen from Creeping Charlie.\n\nMany people in Alberta consider this wildflower a weed. It‚Äôs commonly found growing in lawns, and because of the plant‚Äôs extensive root system, it is difficult to get rid of by hand-pulling or mowing. I have personally battled with Creeping Charlie in my yard!\n\n#8. Purple Loosestrife\n\nLythrum salicaria\n\nAlso known as Spiked Loosetrife and Purple Lythrum.\n\nGrowing Information\n\nUSDA Hardiness Zone: 3a-9b\n\nLife Cycle: Perennial\n\nApproximate mature size: 2-5‚Ä≤ (60-150 cm)\n\nBloom Time: Summer\n\nSun Exposure: Full Sun\n\nTypically you will see this wildflower in Alberta in wet areas.\n\nFor example, look for it in wet meadows, marshes, and along lakes. It‚Äôs hard to believe Purple Loosestrife is usually not welcome, but this invasive species can take over and push out native plants.\n\nPurple Loosestrife reproduces VERY quickly, as each flower spike can produce up to 300,000 seeds. In addition, it also spreads by growing new shoots from its roots.\n\n#9. Dame‚Äôs Rocket\n\nHesperis matronalis\n\nAlso known as the Damask-violet, Dame‚Äôs-violet, Dames-wort, Dame‚Äôs Gilliflower, Night-scented Gilliflower, Queen‚Äôs Gilliflower, Rogue‚Äôs Gilliflower, Summer Lilac, Sweet Rocket, Mother-of-the-evening, Good & Plenties, and Winter Gilliflower.\n\nGrowing Information\n\nUSDA Hardiness Zone: 3-9\n\nLife Cycle: Biennials or Short-lived Perennials\n\nApproximate mature size: 1-4‚Ä≤ (30-122 cm)\n\nBloom Time: Early to Mid Spring\n\nSun Exposure: Full Sun to Partial Shade\n\nThis wildflower is widespread throughout Alberta.\n\nDame‚Äôs Rocket is fast-spreading and found in meadows and woodlands. Look for them included in prepackaged ‚Äúwildflower seed‚Äù mixes.\n\nIn some areas, this plant is considered invasive. However, the young leaves of this spring-blooming flower are high in Vitamin C, can be eaten in salads, and have a slightly bitter taste.\n\n#10. Heal-All\n\nPrunella vulgaris\n\nAlso known as Common Self-heal, Woundwort, Heart-of-the-earth, Carpenter‚Äôs Herb, Brownwort, or Blue Curls.\n\nGrowing Information\n\nUSDA Hardiness Zone: 4-9\n\nLife Cycle: Perennial\n\nApproximate mature size: 6-12‚Ä≥ (15-30cm)\n\nBloom Time: Late Spring-Late Fall\n\nSun Exposure: Sun to Partial Shade\n\nThis wildflower is one of the most common in Alberta.\n\nYou will find Heal-all in lawns, along roadsides, and on the edge of woodlands. It‚Äôs especially aggressive in large grassy areas.\n\nThis plant attracts butterflies, bees, and other pollinators. As a result, it is often used as a ground cover on border fronts, meadows, and naturalized landscapes.\n\n20 PROVEN Plants That Attract Butterflies!\n\nPINK WILDFLOWERS:\n\nView a complete list of PINK wildflowers in Alberta HERE\n\n#11. Spreading Dogbane\n\nApocynum androsaemifolium\n\nAlso known as Fly-trap Dogbane, Bitterroot.\n\nGrowing Information:\n\nUSDA Hardiness Zone: 2-9\n\nLife Cycle: Perennial\n\nApproximate Mature Size: 24-60 in (61-152 cm) tall\n\nBloom Time: Summer\n\nSun Exposure: Full Sun to Full Shade\n\nAs you might have guessed from its name, Spreading Dogbane is a prolific grower, which is why you‚Äôll find it widespread across both North America and Europe. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúdogbane‚Äù because it is highly poisonous to dogs (and humans too).\n\nSpreading Dogbane has small, pink bell-shaped flowers and a scent similar to lilac. Look for this wildflower in Alberta in the sandy soil of streambanks.\n\n#12. Joe Pye Weed\n\nEutrochium\n\nGrowing Information:\n\nUSDA Hardiness Zone: 3-9\n\nLife Cycle: Perennial\n\nApproximate Mature Size: 24-96 in (61-244 cm) tall\n\nBloom Time: Summer to Fall\n\nSun Exposure: Full Sun to Full Shade\n\nJoe Pye Weed is the common name for plants that are in the genus Eutrochium. These wildflowers are NATIVE to Alberta and highly recommended to plant in your yard! It‚Äôs recognizable by the large pink flower clusters at the end of long stems, which attract many types of pollinators!\n\nNaturally, Joe Pye Weed grows naturally at the edges of woodlands and wet meadows. If you plant it in your yard, it does best when in partial shade. And one of my favorite things about this wildflower is that it‚Äôs deer resistant. üôÇ\n\nThere are 5 species of wild Eutrochium found in North America:\n\nEutrochium dubium: Also known as Coastal Plain Joe Pye Weed, it‚Äôs located in the eastern USA and Canada, and its range extends from Nova Scotia to Georgia.\n\nEutrochium fistulosum: This species is also referred to as Hollow Joe Pye Weed, Trumpetweed, or Purple Thoroughwort. It thrives from southern Canada to the eastern and southern USA, from Maine west to Ontario, Wisconsin, and Missouri, and south as far as Florida.\n\nEutrochium maculatum: Commonly called Spotted Joe Pye Weed, it‚Äôs found throughout much of the USA and Canada. It‚Äôs the only wild Joe Pye species that is located west of the Great Plains.\n\nEutrochium purpureum: This species is native to eastern and central North America. It‚Äôs commonly known as Purple Joe-Pye Weed, Kidney-root, Sweetscented Joe Pye Weed, and Sweet Joe Pye Weed.\n\nEutrochium steelei: Found only in parts of the Appalachian Mountains. This Joe Pye Weed species is commonly known as Steele‚Äôs eupatorium.\n\nWhen you go shopping for Joe Pye Weed at your local garden center, you probably won‚Äôt find any of the wild species listed above. That‚Äôs OK, most of the options you will find at a store will be a cultivar of a wild variety.\n\n#13.
