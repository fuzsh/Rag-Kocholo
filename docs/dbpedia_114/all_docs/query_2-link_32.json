Plans include market-rate and affordable housing options. HDC is partnering with Baltimore-based Washington Place Equities on the development, with HDC serving as the developer and owner of the new-construction affordable housing, proposed in two phases and totaling 120 homes on the master site and on two nearby parcels. Total development costs for Phase One of HDC’s development of affordable housing on the site is estimated to cost $15.4 million, one of the largest developments of new affordable housing in the city during the last 25 years.\n\nRecent news and updates are posted at: collegeavenueplanning.com.\n\nHighlights\n\nPhase one (5-stories; 64 apartments) financing includes a $1.5 million commitment from The Steinman Foundation, and a $750,000 commitment from United Disabilities Services to expand ADA accessibility.\n\nDevelopment will feature twice the typical number of ADA-compliant apartments, to be set aside for individuals with disabilities.\n\nNews\n\nState awards Lancaster nonprofit developers affordable housing money\n\nPHFA awarded $1.25 million for Apartments at College Avenue, Lancaster\n\nSteinman Foundation pledges $1.5 million toward 64 affordable apartments on College Ave\n\nFocus of former St. Joseph hospital shifts to planned $90 million project after city OKs rezoning request\n\nFinding a place to live that meets one’s basic needs and budget can feel like a never-ending challenge. The complexity of lower-income families and individuals extend far beyond simply finding a safe, affordable, and welcoming place to call home. At HDC, we are committed to being an ally in speaking to issues, programs, and policies that improve quality of life of our residents. Issues that we know are important to our residents include:\n\nLivable Wages\n\nAccessible, Affordable Transportation\n\nAccess to Healthy Foods\n\nAffordable, Quality Healthcare\n\nQuality, Affordable Childcare\n\nRacial Equity\n\nHousing affordability is something we must take on with empathy and determination. America is facing an affordable housing crisis and as the lack of affordable housing continues to grow, we need to advocate for funding and increased access to affordable housing that moves us all forward. With a shortage of nearly seven million available rental homes, and far too many renters spending half of their income on housing, we must do more. We must do better.\n\nOur policy priorities include:\n\nImprovement and expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program,\n\nIncreased resources for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) programs, such as the HOME Investment Partnership Program (HOME) and Community Development Block Grants (CDBG),\n\nExpansion of HUD project-based and tenant-based housing vouchers so no one is paying more than 30% of their income on rent, and\n\nContinued funding appropriation for NeighborWorks America.\n\nWe know we can’t solve the affordable housing challenge alone. We need champions to help change the conversation around what home means and why it matters. We are committed to educating elected officials to understand the needs and challenges of their constituents. We are here to provide solutions that work and offer affordable housing expertise that demonstrates the impact policy decisions have on lower-income families, seniors and those with disabilities. We work closely with and participate in alliances and coalitions to educate and advance shared policy priorities. Our advocacy partners include:\n\nNational NeighborWorks Association\n\nNational Low Income Housing Coalition\n\nHousing Alliance of Pennsylvania\n\nHousing Alliance Delaware\n\nHousing Partnership Network\n\nVice President of Property Management\n\nwsmith@hdcweb.org\n\nWendy Smith serves as the Vice President of Property Management, responsible for the overall strategic direction for HDC’s management portfolio and the organization’s largest staff team. Previously, Wendy served as Asset and Operations Manager for a leading real estate firm based in New York City which owned over 11,000 affordable homes. Since 2008, Wendy has held roles in regional level operations for commercial and for-profit housing agencies. Wendy holds a degree in International Studies.\n\nIn her spare time, Wendy enjoys traveling around the world with her daughter, experiencing diverse food and drink, and learning about different cultures and economies. She loves spending time with her family–including her two cats!\n\nEven with stable housing, making ends meet and covering basic needs can be challenging. Our staff share information about and help create access to benefits and programs that can reduce monthly expenses and enhance the quality of life for residents.\n\nBy investing time and building trust one-on-one with residents, our resident services staff create opportunities to provide support in accessing benefits such as rental assistance programs, including the PA rent rebate; food benefits for families and seniors; utility assistance programs; and childcare fee assistance. We help navigate what can sometimes be an overwhelming and complex system of social services and government agencies to ensure residents have the resources they need to thrive.\n\nWe partner with over 200 organizations such as community action programs, faith communities, and county assistance offices to create many opportunities for partners to bring services and resources to our residents.\n\nThese connections create over $750,000 in cost savings to residents each year.\n\nHome is about more than a place—home is a feeling of welcome, belonging, and connection to others. Our team takes care to create opportunities for residents to get to know each other, to build relationships with their neighbors, and to create common dreams for their community. In each community our staff works with residents, local organizations, and faith groups to plan unique opportunities and activities ranging from ice cream socials and cookouts to bingo games and holiday parties.\n\nWhen residents are connected as neighbors, many seek opportunities to serve and lead within their broader community. We support resident leadership by creating connections to volunteer opportunities, partnering to plan activities, and building pathways for engagement in organizational leadership at HDC. Resident leaders also participate the Community Leadership Institute of NeighborWorks America.\n\nNews: Resident leaders and community connection at Duke Manor\n\nEveryone should have access to nutritious and healthy food, but many households living on a tight budget struggle with food insecurity and access to affordable, healthy choices. No one should have to choose between paying rent and buying groceries for their family, so we work with trusted partners to provide direct access to nutritious food. By partnering with local nonprofits such as the Central Pennsylvania Food Bank, the Chester County Food Bank, Helping Harvest, and Meals on Wheels, our communities serve as food hubs for both HDC residents and their neighbors. We are actively looking to expand food bank partnerships to increase access in our housing communities.\n\nHDC currently partners with six organizations to distribute food at 22 of our housing communities, resulting in over 4,500 boxes of food provided for HDC residents and local neighbors annually.\n\nOur residents work hard to secure safe, affordable housing and can wait years to find a home that meets their needs. Often it takes only one emergency or personal crisis to jeopardize a family’s housing stability. At HDC, we have a robust Eviction Prevention Program that helps households that are struggling to pay rent due to an unexpected circumstance, such as a medical emergency, family illness, or job loss. We work closely with our residents to identify steps that will help them move through crisis and create a plan of action to catch up on rent and access other benefits.\n\nResidents enrolled in the Eviction Prevention Program can also apply for direct cash assistance from HDC’s Hope and Opportunity Fund to offset short term financial challenges. Our research has shown that the average amount of assistance needed to prevent a family from losing their housing is just $600—a small investment to ensure continued stability through a crisis.\n\nThrough this program, rooted in trusting relationships between staff and residents, 97% of HDC residents enrolled in the Eviction Prevention Program are still in their home six months later.\n\nNews: HDC MidAtlantic puts preventing evictions front and center\n\nPresident and CEO\n\ndhanchin@hdcweb.org\n\nWith 25 years of experience addressing the complex needs of lower-income communities and building and leading affordable housing initiatives, Dana Hanchin serves as President and CEO of HDC MidAtlantic.
