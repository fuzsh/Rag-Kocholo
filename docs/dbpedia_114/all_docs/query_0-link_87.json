Eelgrass declined catastrophically in the 1990s, at a time when Hydro Quebec had modified hydrology through river modification and as climate change impacts on the marine environment accelerated. Eelgrass and the associated goose hunt have not recovered. On behalf of a multidisciplinary research team and partnership with Cree communities, I present results of the Eeyou Coastal Habitat Comprehensive Research Project that aimed to identify the main factors affecting eelgrass along the eastern coast of James Bay. Eelgrass first began to decline in Chisasibi in the 1980s, which we attribute to the development of La Grande River. The onset of very early ice breakup and warm early-summer water temperatures in the late 1990s accelerated the eelgrass decline in Chisasibi and triggered declines along the entire coast. Eelgrass today are shorter, sparse, and limited to shallow water. Insufficient light during early summer due to water color is a general problem impeding recovery. In coastal areas that lost aayoshtinuukticj, recovery is also impeded by feedbacks associated with sediment resuspension. Near La Grande River, eelgrass biomass is negatively affected by high flows and warmer spring water temperatures. During the 1970s, healthy eelgrass provided very important feeding areas for migrating geese. Because eelgrass has persisted, perhaps it can recover, but much depends on how the climate varies in the coming years and future coastal management.\n\nID: 528\n\nThe Coastal Habitat Comprehensive Research Program: the current status of migrant Canada geese in Eastern James Bay, QC, Canada\n\nManon Soraisa, Martin Patenaude-Monettea, Jean-François Girouxa\n\naUniversité du Québec à Montréal, Montréal, QC, Canada\n\nAbstract: Canada geese (Branta canadensis (Linnaeus, 1758)) are an important traditional food resource for Cree communities along the eastern coast of James Bay (QC, Canada). In the last decades, isostatic rebounds, hydroelectric development, and climate change affected the number, distribution, and migration patterns of Canada geese in this region. As part of the Coastal Habitat Comprehensive Research Program, our objective was to describe the status of Canada geese migrating across Eastern James Bay. Using band recoveries reported by Cree hunters between 2000 and 2020, we identified that sub-arctic breeding geese (SABG; B. c. interior) and temperate-breeding geese (TBG; B. c. maxima) from both the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyways were harvested. Based on harvest reports, we found that in spring, SABG were mostly harvested in May before molt migrant TBG, while in fall, both subspecies were harvested in September. Two aerial surveys were conducted along the coast during each season in 2018. In spring, we observed that goose density was highest in areas with the greatest proportion of salt marshes, whereas in fall, the highest densities were observed in areas with more tidal flats and turbid water. Nine TBG tracked with GPS devices between 2015 and 2019 staged for 2.8 ± 0.6 days (mean ± SEM) in Eastern James Bay in spring, using mostly tidal flats and salt marshes. In fall, they staged for 3.8 ± 1.8 days using inland freshwater wetlands, peatlands, and tidal flats. This study complements local Cree Knowledge with large-scale information that should be useful to optimize current hunting practices.\n\nID: 513\n\nLow prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii, a foodborne zoonotic pathogen, and high prevalence of non-pathogenic Sarcocystis spp. from Inuit-harvested beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) in Canada\n\nAdrián Hernández-Ortiza, Rajnish Sharmaa, Louwrens P. Snymana, Lisa L. Losetob, Shannon A. MacPheeb, Sonja K. Ostertagb, Enooyaq Sudlovenickc, Émilie L. Coutured, Stéphane Lairdd, Emily Jenkinsa\n\naUniversity of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada\n\nbFisheries and Oceans Canada, Winnipeg, MB, Canada\n\ncUniversity of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada\n\ndUniversité de Montréal, Saint-Hyacinthe, QC, Canada\n\nAbstract: Beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas (Pallas, 1776)) play an important role in food security and culture for Inuit in the Canadian North. Toxoplasma gondii (Nicolle & Manceaux, 1908) is a food safety concern in the Arctic, where high seroprevalence in Inuit has been associated with consumption of marine animals and migratory birds. Sarcocystis spp. are related parasites with a great diversity of hosts, including marine mammals. The study will determine the prevalence and diversity of T. gondii and Sarcocystis spp. in the eastern Beaufort Sea and Hudson Bay beluga population in Canada. Heart, brain, muscle, and heart fluid samples were collected from 138 whales between 2014 and 2021. Antibodies against T. gondii and DNA by Magnetic Capture qPCR were detected in 1% of the animals. DNA of Sarcocystis, but not T. gondii, was detected in 62% of muscle samples by melt curve analysis qPCR and confirmed using nested PCR. Sequencing showed that Sarcocystis in belugas were closely related to other marine mammal isolates from multiple sites in the Western Hemisphere, suggesting marine mammals are infected by consuming sporocysts shed in feces from marine predators (orcas and polar bears). Histopathology suggests that these Sarcocystis spp. infections were not associated with significant tissue damage in belugas. This study contributes to the knowledge of the available tools to detect tissue coccidians, suggests a low risk of transmission of T. gondii to human populations who harvest and consume beluga in the Canadian Arctic, and contributes to our understanding of beluga whales as sentinels for Sarcocystis in marine ecosystems and trophic relationships.\n\nID: 511\n\nThe initiation of permafrost aggradation in drained lake basins near Old Crow, Yukon\n\nPascale Roy-Léveilléea, Fabrice Calmelsb, Fanny Amyotb, Louis-Philippe Royb\n\naUniversité Laval, Québec, QC, Canada\n\nbYukon University, Whitehorse, YT, Canada\n\nAbstract: In thermokarst lowlands, drained basins indicate where past generations of lakes expanded and drained via permafrost degradation. Post-drainage permafrost aggradation in lake basins may slow, halt, or reverse under a warming climate. While these trends are predicted, they are difficult to detect and have not yet been measured. This research investigates the initiation of permafrost aggradation in drained basins of the Old Crow Flats, Vuntut Gwitch’in traditional territory, Yukon. Thermal monitoring, electrical resistivity tomography, and earth augering were used to assess the influence of pre-drainage talik configuration, vegetation structure, snow cover thickness, and remnant pond extent in lake basins drained in the 2010s, 2000s, and 1970s and in ‘old’ basins that drained prior to the 1950s. Old basins were underlain by permafrost, which was more than 40 m thick at the oldest basin surveyed (2395 ± 20 years old). No frost was detected along transects in two 12-year-old basins when surveyed in 2019; however, in late August 2021, after a winter with a thin snow cover, a solid frozen layer was encountered less than 1 m beneath the surface in areas with a cover of Carex spp. and less than 2 m beneath the surface in a mudflat. In a neighboring basin drained in 2019, a layer of frost was also detected in August 2021 over the previously delineated sub-lake talik geometry. At these sites, frost layers detected in 2021 had persisted and thickened by late August 2022, suggesting the initiation of frost aggradation in these young drained basins.\n\nID: 506\n\nEffect of increasing sediment loads on benthic PAR in Arctic coastscapes\n\nRakesh Kumar Singha, Simon Bélangera\n\naUniversité du Québec à Rimouski, Rimouski, QC, Canada\n\nAbstract: The retreating sea ice in the coastal Arctic Ocean significantly impacts the nearshore ecosystems. The increasing sediment load in the coastal waters due to increased riverine discharge and wave-driven re-suspension has resulted in increased turbidity in many Arctic coastal zones. However, cryospheric, geomorphologic, hydrologic, and ocean exposure settings (i.e., the coastscapes) induce varying turbidity levels across the pan-Arctic coastal zone. The change in water turbidity reduces the availability of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and, consequently, the primary production of benthic vegetation. Here, we present a regional analysis of PAR and turbidity of the Arctic coastscapes at the pan-Arctic scale. We have employed satellite ocean colour data to compute the suspended particulate matter (SPM) and PAR reaching the bottom (PAR(zb)) for eight contrasting coastscapes, varying from shallow estuarine coasts to deep nearshore waters adjacent to rocky cliffs. The trends of SPM and PAR(zb) for the MODIS time series (2003–2020) were calculated for each region. Variability in SPM was correlated to PAR(zb) for different sites to evaluate the effect of turbidity on the benthic PAR. We found that increasing sediment load affects the PAR(zb) observed on the coastal seafloor. However, in some coastscapes, other factors, such as absorption by coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) or phytoplankton, play a more significant role in determining the magnitude of PAR passing through the water column. Environmental drivers of SPM, CDOM, and phytoplankton variability will be further explored.\n\nID: 500\n\nKnowledge transfer in permafrost research: bridging the gap between technical scientific communications and easily accessible information\n\nSarah Gauthiera, Michel Allarda, Pascale Roy-Léveilléea\n\naUniversité Laval, Québec, QC, Canada\n\nAbstract: Like many communities through the circumpolar North, Salluit, Nunavik faces acute challenges imposed by the presence of thaw-sensitive permafrost. Extensive permafrost research has taken place in the region over the past 20 years, but its integration in local practices remains limited for community members and stakeholders involved in land use planning, construction, and adaptation to climatic change. As a common problem persists in the Arctic between scientific communication and end user needs for accessible information, this project bridges this gap with a three-pronged approach to improve the transfer of applied permafrost geomorphology knowledge in Salluit. Initially thought as an open database to host reports, maps, and temperature data from local monitoring stations, the project was oriented by our collaborators from the community, regional, and provincial institutions towards the reformatting of data to fit users with a highly varying level of knowledge about permafrost. As a result of this redirection, the project focused on three components: (1) an early warning system for the daily assessment and communication of landslide risks within the village limits; (2) a terrain characterization, maps, and recommendation based on geomorphological and ground ice data for a planned community expansion zone; and (3) a user-friendly web platform to facilitate public access to all the information, including key sections translated in Inuktitut. This project emphasized the importance of collaborating with community members and public decision makers to go beyond traditional research practices to adequately answer local concerns and fit the needs of the key users of these results.\n\nID: 498\n\nPerishable food supply chain in remote Arctic communities: an empirical investigation of the main challenges\n\nKarima Afifa, Maurice Doyona\n\naUniversité Laval, Québec, QC, Canada\n\nAbstract: Many studies on perishable food supply chain (PFSC) have considered various contexts; however, the northern and remote communities have not gathered the required research attention in this domain. Because of the perishable nature of food products and limited shelf life, challenges in PFSCs are critical. This research aims to understand and disentangle the complexities of supplying perishable foods to Canada’s Arctic communities from a retailer’s perspective. Given significant characteristics of Arctic retailers with respect to supply of perishable foods, this research investigates the factors influencing their capacity to supply perishable foods adequately, reliably, and timely. An embedded single-case study design is adopted to understand in depth the mechanisms underlying these factors, their relative importance, and effect on the retailer’s performance. The empirical investigation is based on semi-structured interviews with key informants from different PFSC levels, including the transport, the retail, and the consumption levels. We also conducted a focus group with representatives from the retail subsidy program. The findings show that the capacity of retailers to deliver perishable foods reliably, adequately, and timely is mainly impacted by their external logistics system. The quality of fresh foods at the source, the traceability and identification of perishable foods through the supply chain, and the effectiveness of handling activities are the most critical challenges. The results show that strengthening coordination and integration within the PFSC is necessary to mitigate these challenges and reduce wastages. This study facilitates managers and policymakers to understand and enable more efficient practices to reinforce northern food systems.\n\nID: 496\n\nTemporal trends of mercury in Arctic biota: 10 more years of progress in Arctic monitoring\n\nAdam Morrisa, Frank Rigétb, Simon Wilsonc, Robert Fryerd, Philippe J.

A mixed model that included an evaluation of non-linear trends was applied to 110 time series from Arctic/subarctic biota. The goals of this assessment included establishing whether THg concentrations were changing over time in biota from the circumpolar Arctic and whether there were spatial patterns in those trends. Trends were calculated for full time series (6–46 years) but with an emphasis on the “recent trends” over the last 20 years. Few geographical patterns of recent trends in THg concentrations were observed; however, those in marine mammals tended to be increasing at more easterly longitudes, and those of seabirds tended to be increasing in the Northeast Atlantic, though geographic coverage remains inconsistent. Trends of THg in freshwater fish were equally increasing and decreasing or were non-significant, while those in marine fish and mussels were non-significant or increasing. The statistical power to detect trends was greatly improved compared to the 2011 assessment; 70% of the time series could detect a 5% annual change at the 5% significance level with power ≥ 80%, while in 2011 only 19% met these criteria. Extending existing time series and adding new, powerful time series contributed to these improvements, highlighting the need for annual monitoring, particularly given the importance of wildlife and fish as traditional food sources and the information needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Minamata Convention on Mercury.\n\nID: 494\n\nCommunity-based polar bear research in Eastern James Bay: updates and new opportunities\n\nAlexandra Langwiedera, Natasha Louttitb, Angela Coxonc, George Natawapineskumd, John Lameboye, Sanford Diamondf, Derek Okimawb, Stephanie Vartyg, Felix Boulangerc, Murray Humphriesa\n\naMcGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada\n\nbCree Trappers’ Association, Eastmain, Eeyou Istchee, QC, Canada\n\ncEeyou Marine Region Wildlife Board, Waskaganish, Eeyou Istchee, QC, Canada\n\ndCree Trappers’ Association, Wemindji, Eeyou Istchee, QC, Canada\n\neCree Trappers’ Association, Chisasibi, Eeyou Istchee, QC, Canada\n\nfCree Trappers’ Association, Waskaganish, Eeyou Istchee, QC, Canada\n\ngEeyou Marine Region Wildlife Board, Eastmain, Eeyou Istchee,QC, Canada\n\nAbstract: In 2021, we launched a community-based research program to study the polar bears in James Bay. Field teams from Waskaganish, Eastmain, Wemindji, and Chisasibi deployed 37 hair snare and camera trap sampling stations across 400 km of the Eeyou Marine Region (EMR) of eastern James Bay. These stations collected hair samples and photographs for 6 weeks in July and August. In 2022, we completed a second field season covering new areas and with modified sampling stations. The new modifications increased the stability of hair snares, reduced the number of fallen cameras, and improved the framing of the pictures captured. The two years of deployment not only provided a large amount of data on polar bears but also allowed us to accumulate information on a diversity of mammalian species such as caribou, wolves, and black bears. We deployed a series of cameras throughout the year, which provided new insights on species’ distribution and resource use in the EMR to complement Cree Knowledge of species’ presence on the offshore islands. We will discuss how this community-based program opens new opportunities to study the coastal mammalian community of James Bay.\n\nID: 491\n\nPresentation to conversation: using land-based workshops to communicate research results and lived experiences\n\nKatrina Anthonya, Mel Flynna, Nathan Jacquea, Paul McCarneyb, Caroline Nochasaka, Eric Olivera, John Wintersa, Jacqueline Wintersa\n\naDalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada\n\nbYukon University, Whitehorse, YT, Canada\n\nAbstract: There is an increased emphasis in Arctic research on producing and mobilizing results that can contribute to addressing complex challenges facing northern communities and ecosystems. To address these challenges, it is important that research results can be used across scales, including by northern community members and to inform broader decision-making. There is a widening recognition of the value of transdisciplinary research that connects multiple disciplines and knowledge systems. Researchers should focus knowledge mobilization efforts on communicating research results through methods and formats that contextualize results around the lived experiences of northerners and around the place-based contexts the research is conducted. One way to achieve this goal is to bring community members and researchers from multiple knowledge systems and academic disciplines together in integrated results’ workshops held on the land. This model enables researchers to communicate through conversation rather than presentation, opening a greater opportunity for dialogue, questions, and suggestions for future directions of research in a way that cannot come from short community presentations or written summaries. This reports on the evaluation of a second land-based knowledge mobilization workshop where community members and researchers working on projects across natural and social science came together to discuss ongoing research findings and other important questions around the theme “food in the tidal zone” in Rigolet, Nunatsiavut, in October 2021. We explore whether land-based workshops can improve understanding and relevance through embedding findings within the local context, increase connections between participants, and encourage researchers to communicate collaboratively about their research.\n\nID: 484\n\nSustaining connections to the land: barriers and factors mediating adaptation strategies for Wemindji Cree\n\nNafisa Sarwatha, Monica Mulrennana\n\naConcordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada\n\nAbstract: Changing environment and socio-economic pressures have continued to impact Indigenous people's access to land and waters in the Arctic and subarctic. This has implications for food sovereignty, stewardship practices, cultural continuity, and Indigenous self-determination. While more attention has been given to understanding how communities are adapting to changing availability of traditional food, their harvest, and consumption, there is a lack of research on factors affecting access to traditional territories and the practice of land-based activities as well as their role in driving feedback cycles with implications for a rapidly changing environment. Using theory of access, through a combination of participant observation, interviews, and focus groups, we examined barriers and mechanisms facilitating access for the people of Wemindji, a coastal Cree community in James Bay. Our findings suggest cabins and all-season roads are key access mechanisms mediating barriers such as unpredictable weather conditions, ice formation, limited available time, cost of being in the bush, as well as the health and age of land users. Additional access mechanisms include capital (e.g., cabin subsidies), family and social relations, authority (e.g., tallyman), availability of travel companions, individual health, access to small-i infrastructure, knowledge, and proximity of campsites to town. These determine the ability, duration, and frequency of being on the territory camping, hunting, and harvesting as well as the intergenerational capacity to carry out relational responsibilities. Increasing our understanding of access mechanisms utilized by communities undergoing rapid social–ecological changes can help identify areas that require support for planning a sustainable and resilient future.\n\nID: 481\n\nThe Hudson Bay Change Project: evaluating Arctic marine ecosystem resilience and resistance to environmental change\n\nKimberly Howlanda, Piero Calosib, David Deslauriersb, Erinn Ipsenc, Jesica Goldsmita, Chris McKindseyc, Daniel Smallc, Karine Blouinc, Justine Sutherlanda, Ellia Royb, Kevin Hedgesa, Andrea Niemia, Ken Jeffriesd, Heidi Swansone\n\naFisheries and Oceans Canada, Winnipeg, MB, Canada\n\nbUniversité du Québec, Rimouski, QC, Canada\n\ncFisheries and Oceans Canada, Mont-Joli, QC, Canada\n\ndUniversity of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada\n\neUniversity of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada\n\nAbstract: Hudson Bay–James Bay is among the most rapidly warming Canadian Arctic regions, subject to expanding mine production/shipping, watershed disruptions, and was identified as a hotspot for climate and shipping-related incursions of invasive species. Despite its size, diverse/unique coastal ecosystems, and importance to local Cree and Inuit communities, there is a lack of baseline data and knowledge of how these changes may impact organisms. We present an overview of the Hudson Bay Change Project (2019–2022) developed to improve the understanding of near-shore marine diversity and resilience of key commercial, subsistence, and high-risk invasive species. We worked closely with community representatives to identify concerns/key species of interest in the coastal marine environment of Kuujjuarapik–Whapmagoostui and Eastmain, QC, and introduced coastal sampling approaches to engage/train local community members in baseline data collection for tracking changes in near-shore diversity and identifying potential indicator species. These community-based initiatives were complemented with experimental studies and environmental niche modelling on species of interest to test responses to thermal stress and predict how species’ ranges of suitable habitat in the Arctic may change under future climate-change scenarios. Experimental studies were conducted using a unique transportable experimental wet lab system initially developed and tested in the south and recently successfully applied with local Arctic species in Kuujjuarapik–Whapmagoostui in 2022. Findings from these studies will facilitate the development of evidence-based tools that can be used to predict species’ distribution shifts, evaluate consequences of ecosystem perturbations, and inform strategies to mitigate or adapt to future changes in the coastal environment.\n\nID: 478\n\nFindings and reflections from the Eeyou Istchee Indigenous Fishing Derby Survey\n\nJohann Strubea, Julie Gibellib, Stephan Schotta, Kia Marinb, Jacqueline Chapmanc\n\naCarleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada\n\nbConcordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada\n\ncSchool of Public Policy and Administration, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada\n\nAbstract: Fishing derbies have become a popular pastime in Cree communities in Eeyou Istchee. Proponents of derbies stress benefits for the local economy, an opportunity to gather and get out on the land, and the fun they derive from the competition. Opponents, on the other hand, fear over-harvesting and a strain on other community resources. To better understand the benefits and risks of fishing derbies to their communities, we have partnered with decision-makers and research advisers from Eeyou Istchee to design a survey to ask participants of Indigenous fishing derbies about their experience, interests, and motivation to participate of different types and scales of derbies (both inland as well as on the coast). During the 2022 fishing season, we distributed the survey at six select derbies. In this presentation, we present the findings from this survey, discuss the process, and reflect on methodological challenges. As Indigenous peoples across the North engage in fishing derbies of all kinds and are increasingly considering recreational fishing for economic development, the findings from this study are relevant beyond Eeyou Istchee. This research is part of a Genome Canada funded project called FISHES—Fostering Indigenous Small-Scale Fisheries for Health, Economy, and Food Security with co-funding from several agencies and Northern partners, including the Cree Nation Government.\n\nID: 470\n\nCommunity monitoring in Frobisher Bay and developing materials to present back to the community\n\nLucianne Marshalla, Alex Flahertyb, Harley Veeveeb, Imoona Karpikb, Noah Alookieb, Kevin Kullualikb, Megan Kota, Stefanie Mellona, Zoya Martinc, Amber Gilesc\n\naOcean Network Canada, Victoria, BC, Canada\n\nbPolar Outfitting, Iqaluit, NU, Canada\n\ncGovernment of Nunavut, Iqaluit, NU, Canada\n\nAbstract: Iqaluit is a hub of the North. It has a population of over 7000, with many community members utilizing Frobisher Bay for numerous activities such as transportation both on the sea ice and open water and season and harvest access, making it an integral connection to land and territories. The Iqaluit community sits at the head of a 230 km fjord and serves as the access point to the water. The Fjord itself is dynamic, with seasonal sea-ice coverage, and experiences large seasonal tides (>14 m). Understanding the baseline oceanographic dynamics of the region is imperative for understanding the state of the local marine ecosystem and will allow for better monitoring of future changes. To establish a baseline of environmental data, research has been conducted by numerous groups within the area. Community Fishers is a community-driven research program supported by Ocean Networks Canada, where local community members have been conducting CTD (conductivity–temperature–depth)-based sampling since 2020, with the program becoming more rigorous in 2021. The community-based approach has proven itself successful, particularly in the time of a global pandemic when many other research projects were halted. Here, we present preliminary data from this program in approachable and varied formats, with the hopes of gathering feedback on how we can improve our science-sharing capabilities with a broader community audience.\n\nID: 469\n\nImagery–multisensory captures of Arctic-built environments: characterizing energy-efficient healthy architecture\n\nMojtaba Parsaeea,b, Claude Demersb, Marc Hébertb, Jean-François Lalondeb, André Potvinb\n\naMcGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada\n\nbUniversité Laval, Québec, QC, Canada\n\nAbstract: This presentation discusses the importance of imagery–multisensory captures to develop energy-efficient, healthy building architecture for the Arctic. Adapting building architecture to the Arctic nature fundamentally requires capturing indoor environmental conditions in relation to hourly/seasonal variations in the extreme outdoor climate. As the main architectural elements, envelopes and interior surfaces of Arctic buildings must respond to energy and health needs changing significantly with the very cold weather, drastic day–night cycles, cloudy skies, and snow-covered grounds. In situ measurements of environmental factors inside and outside a case study Arctic building are presented, underlining the vital need for imagery–multisensory capturing systems to develop envelopes, lighting, and interior surfaces in such climates. A prototype of a 360° imagery–multisensory data acquisition and logging system is also presented as a tool required for comprehensive evaluations of buildings, architecture, and climates in the Arctic. The presentation highlights the key contributions of such capturing systems to develop design guidelines and policies for Arctic building adaptation strategies. In brief, imagery–multisensory capturing devices could provide a deeper understanding of Arctic occupants’ needs and efficient indoor–outdoor connections fostering positive relationships with the harsh nature. The imagery–multisensory tools could help improve indoor environmental qualities and optimize the energy consumption of heating and lighting systems in Arctic buildings.\n\nID: 468\n\nPaulatuk Beluga Drone Project: co-producing knowledge on beluga using participatory field methods and qualitative inquiry\n\nKimberly Ovitza, Kevin Scharffenbergb, Shannon MacPheeb, Dustin Whalenc, Frank Wolkid, Joe Illasiakd, Lisa Losetob\n\naUniversity of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada\n\nbFisheries and Oceans Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada\n\ncNatural Resources Canada, Dartmouth, NS, Canada\n\ndPaulatuk Hunters and Trappers Committee, Paulatuk, NT, Canada\n\nAbstract: Beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas (Pallas, 1776)), or qilalugaq in Inuvialuktun, migrate annually from the Bering Sea to the Eastern Beaufort Sea, where they are harvested by Inuvialuit. One site frequented each year is the Anguniaqvia Niqiqyuam Marine Protected Area (ANMPA) situated in Darnley Bay near the community of Paulatuk. Although Paulatuk residents possess considerable knowledge of beluga, limited systematic evidence on beluga movement, behavior, and habitat use has been acquired for this area to date. In response to research priorities identified by the Paulatuk Hunters and Trappers Committee and the ANMPA Working Group, our transdisciplinary team developed a project using participatory field methods—drone surveys and visual observation—and qualitative inquiry to augment existing knowledge and address knowledge gaps related to beluga. Following a successful pilot season in 2021, we scaled up our research effort in 2022 to include an extended field season, additional methods (passive acoustic monitoring and habitat mapping), and in-person transdisciplinary collaboration. In this presentation, we provide an overview of this research project, present updates from our second field season, and elaborate on next steps. This research yields new information on beluga activity in the ANMPA, as well as insights into the planning and implementation of collaborative cross-cultural research using emerging technologies.\n\nID: 467\n\nEvaluating modelled concentrations of short-lived climate forcers with high-latitude measurements\n\nKimberly Stronga, Victoria Flooda, Kaley Walkera, Cynthia Whaleyb\n\naUniversity of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada\n\nbEnvironment and Climate Change Canada, Victoria, BC, Canada\n\nAbstract: Short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) are greenhouse gases and pollutants that influence the climate and have lifetimes shorter than carbon dioxide. Further, some SLCFs have negative impacts on human health and ecosystems. As such, mitigation of the emissions of these compounds is valuable and requires the attention of policy makers. The Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) was created to advise the Arctic Council on matters of Arctic pollution, climate change, and the associated threats to local ecosystems and health, providing a framework for policy and decision-making. The recent AMAP SLCF Assessment Report examines the role of various SLCFs in the Arctic and presents model-measurement comparisons to assess simulations of SLCFs by a suite of atmospheric models. The work presented here extends these model-measurement comparisons. It compares tropospheric partial columns of ozone, carbon monoxide, and methane modelled by the CESM, CMAM, DEHM, EMEP-MSC-W, GEM-MACH, GEOS-Chem, MATCH, MATCH-SALSA, MRI-ESM2, UKESM1, and WRF-Chem models with historical measurements from five high-latitude ground-based Fourier-transform infrared spectrometers (Eureka, Canada; Thule, Greenland; Ny Ålesund, Norway; Kiruna, Sweden; and Harestua, Norway). The long-term datasets from these Arctic monitoring stations are utilized to assess model biases across the five locations and four years (2008, 2009, 2014, and 2015), and these findings are compared to those in the AMAP SLCF Assessment Report.\n\nID: 465\n\nA comprehensive toolkit for monitoring polar bears—update on our Genome Canada funded project BearWatch\n\nPeter Van Coerverden de Groota, Steven Barylukb, Vincent Boutetc, Marsha Braniganb, Rute Clemente-Carvalhod, Melanie Dominiquec, Markus Dycke, Kristin Ecclesf, Kim Flockg, David Guttmanh, Kristen Haywarda, Paul Ivarea, Evelyn Jenseni, Emily Landona, Valerie Langloisc, Daniel Layton-Matthewsa, Matthew Leybournea, Monica Navarette de Salgadoa, Diane Orihela, Jennifer Provencherj, Zhengxin Suna, Christina Tschrittera, Heather Vanderlipa, Sean Vanderluita, Hayden Wainwrighta, Pauline Wangh, Jasmine Waree, Graham Whitelawa, Shouming Zhouk, Stephen Lougheeda\n\naQueen’s University, Kingston, ON, Canada\n\nbGovernment of the Northwest Territories, Inuvik, NT, Canada\n\ncInstitut National de la Recherche Scientifique, Québec, QC, Canada\n\ndHakai Institute, BC, Canada\n\neGovernment of Nunavut, Igloolik, NU, Canada\n\nfDivision of the National Toxicology Program, National Institute of Environmental Health Science, Durham, NC, USA\n\ngStone Boats Management, Toronto, ON, Canada\n\nhUniversity of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada\n\niNewcastle University, Newcastle, UK\n\njEnvironment and Climate Change Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada\n\nkNational Research Council, Ottawa, ON, Canada\n\nAbstract: Our Genome Canada Bearwatch Project (https://bearwatch.ca) sought to develop ‘tools’ for a non-invasive polar bear, ‘Biomonitoring Toolbox.’ Using sample sets of feces from the colon, liver, muscle, and fat from the same harvested polar bear and on-the-land scat collected by NT and the ISR hunters, we validated (a) a scat-based single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) DNA and genetic sexing assay, (b) health and ecology estimates from stable isotope and contaminant (including microplastic) profiles from scat, (c) new scat DNA metabarcoding methods of identifying vertebrate prey and plant diet, and (d) novel magnetic capture and digital droplet PCR assays for pathogens. Our novel Genotyping-in-Thousands method of 322 autosomal SNPs plus 2 sex markers was robust and repeatable for genotyping harvest tissues, biopsy samples, and field scat, with potential for genotyping non-invasively collected snow from polar bear tracks and hair snags. The variation in polar bear scats δ15N and δ13C is consistent with the variation in diets between terrestrial plants and marine vertebrates, although scats were depleted in δ15N and both δ13C and δ15N compared to polar bear tissues and hair, respectively. Scat-contaminant profiles predicted contaminant concentration in internal organs, with liver concentrations having the strongest predictive relationships, followed by muscle and fat. Metal concentrations, particularly total mercury and methylmercury, had the strongest scat–tissue relationships. Suspected colon on-the-land scat microplastics were assessed using Raman spectroscopy—among others—but evidence for egestion of microplastics was equivocal. These tools offer significant advances for polar bear management and monitoring and possibilities for community monitoring.\n\nID: 464\n\nRapid drainage of the Milne Fiord epishelf lake, Ellesmere Island, Nunavut\n\nBonneau Jérémiea, Derek Muellerb, Bernard Lavala, Andrew Hamiltonc, Alex Forrestd, Drew Friedrichsd, Anna Crawforde, Alexander Culleyf, Warwick Vincentf\n\naUniversity of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada\n\nbCarleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada\n\ncUniversity of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada\n\ndUniversity of California Davis, Davis, CA, USA\n\neUniversity of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK\n\nfUniversité Laval, Québec, QC, Canada\n\nAbstract: On 30 July 2020, the last intact ice shelf of the Canadian Arctic, Milne Ice Shelf, calved and lost 43% of its area. Relatively stable until then, the Milne Ice Shelf acted as a barrier for freshwater from surface runoff, resulting in a freshwater layer floating on top of the denser seawater in Milne Fiord. This freshwater layer, known as an epishelf lake, was monitored over the past several decades. The shoaling of the halocline in Milne Fiord epishelf lake (MEL) since 1983 has been used to infer the minimum draft of the ice shelf, while mooring measurements showed dynamic seasonal variations in the lake depth due to summer meltwater input. Water sampling in the fjord revealed a unique microbial consortia (including communities of viruses) and associated plankton, distinct from the biological communities in the underlying Arctic Ocean. The 2020 breakup of the Milne Ice Shelf marked the end of this remarkable ecosystem. We report on the loss of the MEL using a combination of hydrographic measurements and satellite images. We show that the lake began to drain immediately following the calving event, and by July 2022 only a thin seasonal surface layer of meltwater remained. Epishelf lakes were once common in fjords and embayments along the northern coast of Ellesmere Island, but the MEL was the last of its kind in Canada. We discuss what the drainage of the MEL means for the fjord’s physical and biological oceanography as well as for the remaining cryospheric features in this remote environment.\n\nID: 462\n\nSocial organization and associations of an endangered population of beluga whales\n\nKasey Ryana, Steven Fergusona,b, William Koskic, Brent Youngb, Marianne Marcouxb, James Rotha, Cortney Wattb\n\naUniversity of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada\n\nbFisheries and Oceans Canada, Winnipeg, MB, Canada\n\ncLGL Limited Environmental Research Associates, King City, ON, Canada\n\nAbstract: Social systems can vary widely in marine mammals, ranging from solitary individuals to family units that remain stable over time. Largely due to difficulties sampling in the Arctic environment, the social systems of Arctic species such as the beluga whale remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the social organization of the Cumberland Sound beluga whale population, which is endangered and geographically isolated from other populations. Using aerial survey photos (2014 and 2017) and drone images collected during an ongoing photographic-identification (photo-ID) program (2017–2019), we examined whales within their primary summer habitat, Clearwater Fjord. Group size averaged between 3 and 4 whales, ranging from 1 to 16. This population had a much lower proportion of beluga sub-adults (<15%) than those in other populations (typically 22%–39%), especially whales aged approximately 1–3 years old. The low number of calves may indicate that calves’ survivorship is low or that calves are primarily located outside the main study area. Calves were usually within one body length of the nearest adult, with younger calves on average closer to the adult. We were also able to identify individual whales from the photo-ID program and found several instances of multi-year associations between the same whales, indicating strong social ties. Further monitoring through photo-ID and other methods will help gain a better understanding of this population and the factors that may influence social organization in small beluga populations.\n\nID: 458\n\nExploring the variability of freshwater from tidewater glacier–ocean systems in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago\n\nClaire Parrotta, Stephanie Watermana, Paul Myersb, Maya Bhatiab, Erin Bertrandc, Andrew Hamiltonb, Terry Noahd, Eric Brossiere, David Didierf\n\naUniversity of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada\n\nbUniversity of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada\n\ncDalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada\n\ndAusuittuq Adventures, Grise Fiord, NU, Canada\n\neVagabond’s Captain, Voilier polaire, Hanvec, France\n\nfUniversité du Québec à Rimouski, Rimouski, QC, Canada\n\nAbstract: Tidewater glaciers, numerous in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA), are an important and dynamic source of freshwater to the Arctic freshwater system, with glacial inputs modifying local ocean properties and contributing to regional freshwater budgets. Despite their abundance, knowledge is lacking on glacier–ocean systems across the CAA, and these systems are often omitted in regional studies of freshwater transport or storage. In this study, we examine the nature and spatial extent of glacial meltwater influence on freshwater dynamics in Jones Sound, a tidewater glacier-rich region in the CAA, to better understand the varying influences of glacier inputs on ocean water column structure, stratification and vertical mixing nearby the glacier terminus, as well as the role of tidewater glaciers in regional oceanic freshwater storage, transport, and export. We use in situ near-shore observations at both glacierized and non-glacierized sites, collected using the sailing yacht Vagabond and local vessels operated by community members from Ausuittuq (Grise Fiord, NU) over a 4-year timespan. This novel dataset provides fjord-scale resolution of water column properties from glacier terminus to open ocean. Further, we employ a high-resolution regional model (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean framework of the Arctic and Northern Hemisphere Atlantic at 1/12 degree resolution) to examine regional freshwater transport and storage. Preliminary results show notable year-to-year variation in ocean structure at the glacierized sites, suggesting that there is potentially important spatial and temporal variability of glacially sourced freshwater to Jones Sound that should be considered in regional freshwater budget estimates.\n\nID: 456\n\nOcean acidification and marine heatwave impacts on the keystone Arctic copepod Calanus glacialis: a metabolic and metabolomics approach\n\nPiero Calosia, Peter Thorb, Marie-Hélène Carignana, Fanny Vermandelea\n\naUniversité du Québec à Rimouski, Rimouski, QC, Canada\n\nbNorwegian Polar Institute, Tromsø, Norway\n\nAbstract: Seawater temperature and pH/pCO2 exert an important influence on marine organisms’ metabolism, especially in ectotherms that are highly dependent on the thermal environment and possess somewhat lesser homeostatic abilities. Particularly relevant for the Arctic Ocean are ocean warming (OW), marine heatwaves (MHW), and ocean acidification (OA). However, we lack a critical understanding for the mechanistic pathways of impact of these drivers for most Arctic species. The aim of our work was to elucidate, through two separate experiments, the metabolic and metabolomics implications of exposure to OW, MHW, and OA in an Arctic coastal keystone species: the copepod Calanus glacialis Jaschnov, 1955. We found that MHW negative effects on the survival of C. glacialis adults worsen when combined to OW. In addition, metabolomic profiles allowed us to describe for the first time a diapause-like dormancy in copepods exposed to OW, from a quiescent state observed in copepods exposed to MHW. On the other hand, copepodites IV showed to undergo increasing metabolic rates and increasing ATP levels with decreasing seawater pH, while copepodites V showed no changes in metabolic rates with decreasing pH and also showed an increasing ATP. Further, metabolic pathway enrichment analyses suggest in copepodites IV a shift in energy production from carbohydrate metabolism to amino acid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation and in copepodites V an increased metabolism of wax esters. The metabolic shifts induced by OW, MHW, and OA in C. glacialis, given its key function in marine Arctic food webs, imply important consequences for marine coastal Arctic ecosystems.\n\nID: 452\n\nCo-located ice core and sediment core records reveal climate warming-induced acceleration of mercury inputs to Lake Hazen, Nunavut\n\nIgor Lehnherra, Danielle Lemirea, Alison Criscitiellob, Cora Youngc, Jessica Serbub, Amila De Silvad, Jane Kirkd, Andrei Ryzhkove, Ashu Dastoore, Stephanie Vartya\n\naUniversity of Toronto, Mississauga, ON, Canada\n\nbUniversity of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada\n\ncYork University, Toronto, ON, Canada\n\ndEnvironment and Climate Change Canada, Burlington, ON, Canada\n\neEnvironment and Climate Change Canada, Dorval, QC, Canada\n\nAbstract: Mercury (Hg) is a globally dispersed contaminant that can bioaccumulate and biomagnify in food webs. This research uses a unique combination of measurements in an ice core and a sediment core collected within the same watershed (Lake Hazen, NU) to determine how the relative importance of Hg inputs from atmospheric and terrestrial sources has changed over the last century. Hg accumulation in Lake Hazen sediment began increasing dramatically in the mid-1990s, exhibiting a decoupling from atmospheric sources (as estimated from the ice core record and supported by modelling of atmospheric Hg deposition), due to the increased importance of remobilized terrestrial Hg inputs to Lake Hazen. Increasing glacier melt and permafrost thaw slumping have increased the delivery of catchment Hg, via glacial rivers, into Lake Hazen. These results show that climate change is likely to slow the recovery of glacierized Arctic watersheds from Hg contamination, countering the anticipated benefit from recent international efforts to reduce anthropogenic Hg emissions.\n\nID: 444\n\nObservations of winter nutrient distributions in contrasting coastal regions of Hudson Bay\n\nAlessia Guzzia, Jens Ehna, Michelle Kamulab, Christine Michelb, Zou Zou Kuzyka\n\naUniversity of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada\n\nbDepartment of Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Winnipeg, MB, Canada\n\nAbstract: The riverine coastal domain of Hudson Bay, which acts as the initial connector between terrestrial and marine ecosystems, plays a large role in the nutrient condition and ultimately the productivity of the Bay; however, it remains poorly understood especially for the ice-covered winter period. To address the scientific knowledge gap, we examined two coastal regions, southeast Hudson Bay (SEHB) and northwest Hudson Bay (NWHB). We hypothesized that SEHB waters would have a more limited nutrient recharge during winter compared to NWHB waters because of freshwater (from ice melt and terrestrial sources) accumulating in the surface layer. Water samples, analyzed for nutrient and freshwater tracers, were collected from the two contrasting regions during winter in 2018 and 2019. From these data, we first identified the dominant sources of freshening in each region by examining the oxygen isotope ratio–salinity relationships and then compared nutrient concentrations and ratios to determine how sea ice and river water influenced the nutrient regime. Our findings show that although the freshwater budget in NWHB is generally brine-dominated in winter, the waters do not experience stronger nutrient recharge than SEHB. In both areas, nitrate concentrations did not exceed 5 µm during winter, and phosphate concentrations averaged 1 µm in deep water samples. Despite evidence of more river water in SEHB, the nutrient concentrations in coastal waters in winter were similar in the two regions. Temporal variability in winter water mass composition in NWHB was interpreted as evidence for re-circulation of river water-rich Hudson Bay outflow into NWHB.\n\nID: 440\n\nImproving data accessibility and use through integration of multiple standards and novel workflows—Canadian Watershed Information Network\n\nClaire Herberta, Yanique Campbella, Kelsey Friesena\n\naUniversity of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada\n\nAbstract: The Canadian Watershed Information Network (CanWIN) is a spatial research data infrastructure system hosted at the University of Manitoba and managed by the Centre for Earth Observation Science (CEOS) within the Faculty of Environment, Earth, and Resources. CEOS is a leading multidisciplinary and collaborative research centre, focused on understanding how the Earth, particularly the Arctic, will respond to climate change. CanWIN is also a member of the Canadian Consortium for Arctic Data Interoperability (CCADI), a pan-Canadian collaboration between six universities and multiple Indigenous, governmental, and non-profit organizations to develop an interoperable Arctic Research Data Infrastructure. To support researchers in the ethical sharing of data, CanWIN has created a series of custom reusable workflows. These combine adapting current best practices and working with CCADI to develop strategies to support interoperability, in part by using controlled vocabularies such as Natural Environment Research Council and Climate Forecast. Data are accessible via the CanWIN data catalogue, allowing us to add additional contextual metadata in the form of cookbooks and codebooks. Custom templates for user input were also created to allow collection of detailed metadata accessible via API and direct download in a variety of standards. CanWIN is also working on additional strategies to package metadata and data to create \"FAIR digital objects\" for data sharing. Approaches include creating a novel method to attach additional metadata to netcdf files and produce \"data packages\" for download. In this talk, we will discuss the benefits of each method and lessons learned.\n\nID: 437\n\nComparison of benthic communities in marine-terminated glacier fjords to land-terminated glacier fjords in Greenland\n\nGuillaume Blaisa, Philippe Archambaulta, Gwénaëlle Chailloub\n\naUniversité Laval, Québec, QC, Canada\n\nbUniversité du Québec à Rimouski, Rimouski, QC, Canada\n\nAbstract: Many fjords in the Arctic are in transition, changing from marine-terminated glacier fjords to land-terminated glacier fjords. The impact caused by this drastic change, due to climate change, has been recessed recently in the dynamic of those fjords, but no other study has compared benthic communities in those fjords. It is assumed that marine-terminated glacier fjords have upwelling due to the presence of large marine plumes that come from the melting part of the glacier in the depth of the fjord. Due to that upwelling, it is known that the primary productivity in those fjords increases during spring and summer, influencing the food web in the pelagic zone. From this situation, benthic communities should be impacted as well as increasing the biodiversity in the marine-terminated fjords. We tested this hypothesis by collecting 120 benthic samples in 10 fjords from East Greenland, 5 from each type of fjord at 5 distances from the origin to cover a total of 100 km along the fjord. We then compare abundance, species richness, biomass, and physicochemical factors at those stations. We observed that crustaceans were more abundant along the marine glacier-fjord type compared to terrestrial glacier fjords having only a large abundance near the beginning of the ocean. In contrast, filter-feeding species like bivalves were significantly more abundant in land-terminated fjords, suggesting that the type of the fjord is a major driver for benthic communities as well as physicochemical factors like the sediment size that is way more diverse in marine-terminated glacier fjords.\n\nID: 436\n\nUsing space-based Earth observation data to inform decision-making for flooding and ice jams in remote communities in the Western Arctic\n\nAneitha Mohammeda, Garfield Giffa\n\naAurora Research Institute, Inuvik, NT, Canada\n\nAbstract: In recent years, Space-Based Earth Observation Data (SBEOD) collections have become vast, readily available, and accessible to the general public on a variety of platforms. In areas where population and infrastructures are scarce, SBEOD could be fundamental in informing decision-making and research. Despite the potential, it’s still unrealistic and time-consuming for Northern communities to explore and utilize the abundance of SBEOD information. To propel the practical application of SBEOD in remote communities, issues specific to these communities have been identified and addressed through diverse partnerships. For example, in the Beaufort Delta, flooding during the ice thaw is a serious threat for communities in the region. Water levels in Inuvik, Aklavik, Tsiigehtchic, and McPherson have been increasing due to higher precipitation, rising temperatures, and ice jams on smaller water channels. Sitting in the valley of a meandering river, Aklavik is particularly prone to ice jams and flooding. With a population of 600+, resources to support the community are minimal, and as rivers thaw, in-person monitoring becomes difficult and dangerous. This project will explore whether a combination of readily available SBEOD and Traditional Knowledge can create indicators for early ice jams and(or) flood warning systems for Aklavik. The goal is to build a simple, easily accessible tool that will consider the unique obstacles for disseminating data in remote areas, such as computer accessibility, internet speed, and data display.\n\nID: 433\n\nCommunity-led solutions to improving food security in Sambaa K’e\n\nDavid Wheatleya, Andrew Springa, Carla Johnstona, David Gillespiea\n\naWilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo, ON, Canada\n\nAbstract: Food security is a pressing issue for communities in the North. There are numerous, complex problems that have led to the current situation, including ongoing colonial approaches and policies, lack of economic opportunities, and high cost of transportation of food to some of the more remote communities. We present the results of our ongoing work in the community of Sambaa K’e, NT. This fly-in community of less than 100 residents relies on a single community-run store to supplement their traditional food diet. To reduce reliance on imported food, the community has built extensive gardens and greenhouses to grow fresh vegetables and crops. We explore challenges around how to use existing funding and capital to finance the gardens and store and pay for labour, how to balance the ideologies held by different stakeholders on sharing versus selling food, and ultimately what role a community-run store can play in the local and regional food economy. We also examine the community’s history with the Nutrition North Canada (NNC) food subsidy program and consider how a small community might lack the buying power, capacity to perform supplier evaluation, and administrative know-how to properly apply for and maintain this federal subsidy. We explore possible solutions to this problem to support the community’s vision for making more food available to all those who need it.\n\nID: 432\n\nCommunity-driven vessel monitoring for coastal management in Nunavut\n\nKiyomi Holmana, Lucianne Marshalla, Ryan Flagga\n\naOcean Networks Canada, Victoria, BC, Canada\n\nAbstract: Ocean Networks Canada’s (ONC) pilot cabled Community Observatory was installed in Cambridge Bay, NU, in 2012. The platform initially hosted instruments monitoring minimal water-quality parameters, a camera, and a shore-based meteorological station. Over the last decade, it has been expanded, optimized, and challenged by the environment and technology. The Arctic Community Observatory has been a source of learning, innovation, and technological advancements. Most importantly, it has also been beneficial for community partnerships and knowledge sharing. This has shaped the path for new community partnerships and observatories supported by ONC around Canada. In 2013, the Cambridge Bay monitoring system was equipped with an Automatic Identification System (AIS) receiver. AIS is a global service used to track and identify vessels by coastal authorities. Certain vessel types require AIS systems, with stricter regulations in the Arctic (Polar Code (IMO 2015)), though unregulated vessels may volunteer to install them. While AIS is normally used for navigation and safety purposes, community-driven research and monitoring vessel traffic have the benefit of focusing research questions to topics of concern to Northern communities. It is key for local communities to be engaged in all aspects and contribute to policy decisions surrounding vessel traffic within their regions and develop guidelines for best practices. The Cambridge Bay AIS and a parallel initiative, the Kugluktuk Marine Vessel Monitoring Program, have served to expand vessel traffic monitoring in the North, meeting a number of AMSA (2009) recommendations. Here, we present the nine years of AIS data collected in Cambridge Bay.\n\nID: 429\n\nImpacts of tall shrub expansion on the hydrological dynamics of a Low-Arctic catchment\n\nCory Wallacea,b, Aaron Bergc, Qianyu Changc, Anna Colesd, Philip Marshb, Oliver Sonnentage, Evan Wilcoxb, Jennifer Baltzerb\n\naMcMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada\n\nbWilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo, ON, Canada\n\ncUniversity of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada\n\ndGovernment of the Northwest Territories, Yellowknife, NT, Canada\n\neUniversité de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada\n\nAbstract: Shrub productivity is increasing across a large majority of the circumpolar Arctic. Much of our understanding regarding the influence of this shrub expansion on tundra systems has been informed by fine-scale studies. These studies have documented a series of changing hydrological conditions related to shrub cover, including altered soil moisture, thaw depth, snow redistribution, and evapotranspiration. Substantial focus has been placed on relating these and other fine-scale observations to global-scale surface energy balances and mass fluxes. However, the cumulative effects of local impacts have yet to be extended to hydrological responses at a regional or catchment scale. Here, we propose a conceptual model that considers hydrologically relevant ecosystem impacts of shrub expansion and generates specific hypotheses about how they may influence catchment-scale streamflow response to summer rainfall. In particular, we expect increased shrub cover to increase evapotranspirative fluxes and interception, resulting in less total discharge and hydrographs with longer receding limbs. We test these hypotheses using climatic variables and streamflow responses collected from Trail Valley Creek, a watershed in the taiga-tundra ecotone of the NT. Rainfall and discharge trends are both increasing but are inconsistent, such that months showing increasing rainfall never displayed increasing streamflow. One explanation of this may be increased shrub cover across the basin. Future steps will involve isolating the shrub signal from climate trends to directly relate shrub expansion and streamflow response. Evidence of such a response would suggest that shrub expansion may mediate future streamflow–climate relationships, complicating predictions of water resource availability in Arctic systems.\n\nID: 428\n\nSummer marine migration of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) in the Coronation Gulf near Kugluktuk, Nunavut\n\nRosie Smitha, Eric Hitkolokb, Tracey Loewenc, Amanda Dumondb, Heidi Swansona\n\naUniversity of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada\n\nbKugluktuk Hunters and Trappers Organization, Kugluktuk, NU, Canada\n\ncFisheries and Oceans Canada, Winnipeg, MB, Canada\n\nAbstract: Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus (Linnaeus, 1758)) is an important food fish across the Canadian Arctic. The anadromous life history type is commonly harvested by Inuit communities, including the Hamlet of Kugluktuk, NU. Fishers from Kugluktuk have observed changes in the migration patterns of anadromous Arctic Char in the Coppermine River and Coronation Gulf, and some believe fish movement is affected by water temperature. In response to these concerns, we used acoustic telemetry to track 149 anadromous Arctic char in the marine environment of the Coronation Gulf during the ice-free periods of 2018–2021. We describe the horizontal space use of Arctic char during the summer months and how migration patterns relate to water temperature and overwintering location. Summer feeding in rich marine waters is of critical importance for anadromous Arctic char, and understanding summer migration patterns is important in the development of conservation plans for this ecologically and culturally important species.\n\nID: 424\n\nUnderstanding and predicting future climate–vegetation–cryosphere interactions in Nunatsiavut, Nunavik, and NunatuKavut\n\nRobert Waya, Andrew Trantb, Martin Leducc, Luise Hermanutzd, Laura Siegwart Colliere, Alain Cuerrierf, Rodd Laingg, Darroch Whitakere, Yu Zhangh, Jordan Beera, Victoria Colyna, Emma Davisb, Anika Forgeta, Alexandra Johnsonb, Caitlin Lapalmei, Taylor Larkingb, Patrick Lauriaultb, Nhu Leb, Antoni Lewkowiczj, Holly Lightfoote, Siobhan Mullallyb, Michelle Saundersg, Michaela Smitas-Krassb, Rosamond Tuttonk, Yifeng Wanga\n\naQueen’s University, Kingston, ON, Canada\n\nbUniversity of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada\n\ncUniversité du Québec à Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada\n\ndMemorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador, St. John’s, NL, Canada\n\neParks Canada, Glovertown, NL, Canada\n\nfMontréal Botanical Garden, Montreal, QC, Canada\n\ngDepartment of Lands and Natural Resources, Nunatsiavut Government, Nain, NL, Canada\n\nhNatural Resources Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada\n\niIndependent Researcher, Happy Valley-Goose Bay, NL, Canada\n\njUniversity of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada\n\nkWilfrid Laurier University, Yellowknife, NT, Canada\n\nAbstract: The impacts of climate change in Canada are felt prominently by Indigenous Peoples and northerners. In the Nunatsiavut, Nunavik, and NunatuKavut, regions of Labrador and northern Quebec, rapid regional warming is heightening the risks of permafrost thaw, hydrological change, and vegetation growth with potential impacts on community infrastructure, archaeological sites, and cultural keystone species like caribou and berry plants. Our ongoing ArcticNet-funded research project aims to increase the understanding of regional changes to vegetation, snow cover, and permafrost and to assess the impacts of environmental change on northern ecosystem health. This project uses field measurements, remote sensing, and numerical modelling to evaluate vegetation–permafrost–snow interactions across forest (F), forest tundra (FT), shrub tundra (ST) and tundra (T) ecosystems at three field research basins (Pinware River Hills [F, FT, T], Nain Bay Hills [F, FT, ST, T], and Nakvak Brook [ST, T]). Satellite-based mapping of environmental change hotspots in the Torngat Mountains National Park (Nunatsiavut) and Kuururjuaq National Park (Nunavik) and localized field investigations implicate enhanced shrub growth as the dominant source of ecological change in the tundra. Ongoing development of new methods for characterizing snow cover and snow thickness has also enabled a better understanding of local-scale snow variability, while co-located ground surface temperature logger deployments are facilitating a better understanding of the ground thermal regime. Improved understanding of the connections between snow, trees, shrubs, and permafrost will facilitate assessment of habitat vulnerability to future environmental changes and will inform policy decisions about climate adaptation, ecosystem management, and infrastructure development.\n\nID: 417\n\nKnowledge co-production in food systems and health research: a case study from the Inuvialuit Settlement Region, Canada\n\nSonja Ostertaga, Kelly Skinnera, Verna Pokiakb, Celina Wolkic, Richard Grubenb, Allan Torngd, Maria Ramireza, Julia Gyapaye, Brian Lairda\n\naUniversity of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada\n\nbTuktoyaktuk Hunters and Trappers Committee, Tuktoyaktuk, NT, Canada\n\ncInuvialuit Regional Corporation, Paulatuk, NT, Canada\n\ndDepartment of Health and Social Services, Government of Northwest Territories, Yellowknife, NT, Canada\n\neWilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo, ON, Canada\n\nAbstract: Harvesting activities are strongly connected to Inuit well-being, and country foods play an important role in maintaining Inuit identities, culture, and well-being. The presence of contaminants in the environment has led to the accumulation of persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals in the Canadian Arctic, which is an issue of concern for Inuit who rely on the ecosystem for their nutrition, health, and well-being. Previous studies have highlighted the need for Indigenous Knowledge (IK) to be included in the assessment of health risks and benefits associated with consuming country foods to ensure that culturally appropriate information and advice can be provided to affected communities, accounting for social, economic, cultural, environmental, and health factors. The Country Foods for Good Health (CFGH) project uses a co-production of knowledge (CBK) approach to bring together IK and western scientific knowledge to gain a deeper understanding of the Inuvialuit Food System. This project celebrates the benefits of country foods and fosters the co-development of communication materials that support a healthy diet, based on local values and food preferences. The CFGH project provides an opportunity to examine the challenges, successes, and opportunities associated with the CBK framework for food systems and health research in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. In this case study, we highlight how equitable relationships were developed and sustained, and we provide examples of how our research process bridges knowledge systems and knowledge users, using the tools and concepts of CBK to generate new knowledge and solutions for Inuvialuit health and well-being.\n\nID: 416\n\nTides, winds, and ice: uncovering ocean processes in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago\n\nLina M. Rotermunda, Ruth C. Musgravea, Clark G. Richardsb\n\naDalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada\n\nbFisheries and Oceans Canada, Dartmouth, NS, Canada\n\nAbstract: We examine the physical processes that modify and mix the water masses passing through Barrow Strait within the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) using in situ data. Ocean currents, temperature, and salinity as well as sea ice thickness and velocity were measured intermittently at five mooring locations across the strait between 1998 and 2018. Additionally, summer stratification profiles across the strait have been obtained in many years, including new data from August 2022. The CAA plays an outsized role in the global climate as it is a major pathway for Arctic water outflow to the North Atlantic. Barrow Strait, recently included in the designation of the Tallurutiup Imanga National Marine Conservation Area, accounts for 30%–50% of this volume transport. On seasonal and interannual timescales, mean flow is driven by sea surface height differences at opposite ends of the passage, but on shorter timescales, the flow is dominated by winds, tides, and coastal currents. Mixing associated with these processes impacts local sea-ice conditions and nutrient fluxes, which in turn affects primary production. Our focus is on mixing through internal waves generated by tides interacting with the variable seafloor topography or by wind and on surface processes such as formation of cold, salty, or low-salinity waters as sea ice grows or melts. Here, we highlight the temporal and vertical structure of the internal tide in Barrow Strait and its influence on mixing, as well as wind-driven internal waves and their generation and modification by seasonal sea-ice cover.\n\nID: 415\n\nCommunity-based monitoring, Inuit knowledge, and ocean modelling to help improve our understanding of local marine ecosystems within two communities: Ulukhaktok and Uummannaq\n\nPatrick Farnolea, Nadja Steinerb, Adam Monahana, Heidi Andreasenc, Caroline Bouchardd, Allen Pogotake, Simmi Løvstrømc, Mark Stollerf\n\naUniversity of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada\n\nbFisheries and Oceans Canada, Sidney, BC, Canada\n\ncUummannaq Polar Institute, Uummannaq, Greenland\n\ndGreenland Institute of Natural Resources, Nuuk, Greenland\n\neUlukhaktok, NT, Canada\n\nfQueen’s University, Kingston, ON, Canada\n\nAbstract: Arctic communities are at the frontline of global environmental changes. Yet, local impact can be very unique; therefore, mitigation and adaptation strategies require local and tailored knowledge. In the scientist toolbox, regional ocean models have proven to be very powerful to help understand and predict changes in the water column, within a given area, impacting marine ecosystems. Yet, at a very local scale, such as the coast around Ulukhaktok (NT) or within the Fjord of Uummannaq (Greenland), these models still require guidance and support from local data and insights. Over the past few years, we have been working with and within these two communities, combining Inuit knowledge, community-based monitoring, and ocean-modelling tools to help understand the changes in local marine ecosystems. Through multiple rounds of interviews, we gathered elements of traditional knowledge and contemporary observations by Inuit. In Ulukhaktok, we are co-designing a local calendar characterizing the seasonal transitions and interannual changes in terms of environmental features related to model variables. In Uummannaq, we conducted interviews about ocean temperature and Arctic Cod, a key circumpolar forage species, providing insights on changes in sea ice and local primary production. In parallel, community-based monitoring programs have been collecting ocean salinity and temperature profiles in both communities, helping us refine models so that, in turn, they could shed light on expected changes for the communities. In this presentation, we will share our learnings from combining these approaches and insist on their complementarity towards actual knowledge co-production.\n\nID: 412\n\nWater masses’ transformation along Nares Strait from 2002–2020: a numerical model study\n\nYarisbel Garcia Quintanaa, Paul G. Myersa, Kent Mooreb\n\naUniversity of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada\n\nbUniversity of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada\n\nAbstract: Nares Strait is one of the main pathways connecting the Arctic Ocean to the North Atlantic, via Baffin Bay. The southward transport of sea ice and freshwater through the strait plays an important role in the mass balance of Arctic sea ice and influences the climate of the North Atlantic region. In the last two decades, the strait has gone through some significant hydrographic changes. Given the significance of the region, we use an eddy-permitting configuration of the NEMO ocean model to explore water masses’ transformation along Nares Strait, from 2002 to 2020. The model is coupled with the Louvain-la-Neuve sea-ice thermodynamic and dynamic numerical model and is forced by the Canadian Meteorological Centre’s Global Deterministic Prediction System Reforecasts. Model data indicate that north of the Kane Basin sill, the strait has become fresher, and the overall temperature has decreased by ∼0.2 °C. These changes are more prominent below 100 m depth. This increasing freshwater signal may reflect changes in circulation and ice formation that contribute to an increased flow of relatively fresh waters from the Arctic Ocean into Nares Strait. The southern portion of the strait, on the other hand, has become warmer. This warming is more pronounced between 100 and 350 m depth. This would be consistent with an influx of warmer Atlantic Origin Water, as proposed by previous modelling results. These changes could impact the formation and stability of the southern ice arch, posing a potential risk for the formation and maintenance of the North Water Polynya.\n\nID: 407\n\nStrengthening access to animal care in Arctic communities through community-led approach\n\nMichelle Tumaa\n\naVeterinarians Without Borders Canada, Yellowknife, NT, Canada\n\nAbstract: This year Veterinarians Without Borders has operationalized their Northern Animal Health Initiative after three years in pilot mode. The organization now has partnerships with 10+ communities in the Arctic, where the program focuses on building a longer term, community-driven, sustainable animal health model. We go beyond the temporary vet clinic to support community needs in access to care, with community health at the forefront of the solutions. Community liaisons and local dog committees are the backbone of a successful veterinary clinic and implementing One Health solutions. We will walk conference participants through the multifaceted approach in identifying community members who can lead the work, how to identify the resources that will empower a community to increase access to care, and how to overcome challenges in providing consistent animal care services to these communities. As part of an organization with established international programming and guided by a One Health approach, we are bringing unique frameworks and models to our Northern Program. During our session, we will introduce these ideas as a way to build sustainable solutions with local communities taking the lead.\n\nID: 400\n\nLooking after the land and sea: fisheries, food security, and biomonitoring in the Kitikmeot region\n\nBrent Puqiqnaka, Stephan Schottb, John Bryan Idloutc, Jacqueline Chapmand, Johann Strubeb, Emmelie Paquetteb, Anne Beemelmannse, Xavier Dallairee, Jean-Sébastien Mooree\n\naGjoa Haven Hunters and Trappers Association, Gjoa Haven, NU, Canada\n\nbCarleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada\n\ncSpence Bay Hunters and Trappers Organization, Taloyoak, NU, Canada\n\ndBC Hydro, Pemberton, BC, Canada\n\neUniversité Laval, Québec, QC, Canada\n\nAbstract: Our paper considers the balancing of food security with wildlife stewardship and the development of small-scale inshore fisheries. As part of a Genome Canada project called FISHES and two Polar Knowledge studies on data stewardship and biomonitoring, we explain how our project evolved since 2017 with local collaborators in Gjoa Haven and Taloyoak, NU. We discuss how indigenous knowledge and observations by active local harvesters can contribute to the identification of culturally important and crucial subsistence harvest sites. We found that some areas used to be important harvest grounds but after recent relocations are either completely out of reach or prohibitively costly to get to. These formerly important harvest areas are often now considered for commercial activities due to the lack of interference with subsistence harvest locations and due to the ongoing attachment to ancestors’ hunting and fishing grounds. To guarantee the sustainability of subsistence harvesting and small-scale fishery sites, we engaged in sampling for genetic analysis of Arctic char from various harvest areas and potential and current commercial sites around Taloyoak and Gjoa Haven, NU. We are combining the latter work with information collected at Indigenous Knowledge and active harvester workshops and a harvest and biomonitoring study with a sample of active registered local harvesters. Based on our collaborative interdisciplinary methods, we identify criteria and risks for choosing potential commercial fishery areas and fishing methods. We furthermore evaluate future directions for independent local biomonitoring of wildlife and fish stocks and data stewardship through online mapping and atlas platforms.\n\nID: 396\n\nThe Canadian Consortium for Arctic Data Interoperability: standards and interoperable services supporting next-generation research\n\nPeter Pulsifera, Shannon Vossepoelb, Etienne Godinc, Claire Herbertd, Greg Veye, Rebekah Ingrama, Michael Allchinb, Byron Chuf, Tahiana Ratsimbazafyc, James Parker Badgerb, Munish Madanb, Alex Gaoa, Yanique Campbelld, Chantelle Verheye, Zachary Shandf, David Arthursg, Adam Stonea, Maribeth Murrayb\n\naCarleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada\n\nbUniversity of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada\n\ncUniversité Laval, Québec, QC, Canada\n\ndUniversity of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada\n\neUniversity of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada\n\nfCybera, Calgary, AB, Canada\n\ngPolar View, Herlev, Denmark\n\nAbstract: The goal of the Canadian Consortium for Arctic Data Interoperability (CCADI) is to develop an integrated Canadian Arctic data management system that will facilitate information discovery, establish sharing standards, enable interoperability among existing data infrastructures, and that will be co-designed with, and accessible to, a broad user base. CCADI brings together partners with a common interest in sharing data and information in new ways. Standards, broadly defined, are at the core of data and information sharing. In this paper, we present the results of a collaborative effort that uses standards to implement interoperable data and information services. Interoperability is defined here as the ability of information systems to readily share information and operations. We demonstrate how standard terminology, data formats, service interfaces, and analytical platforms can facilitate research on a wide variety of topics and domains (community-driven, physical, social, economic, etc.), and serve and mediate data for a wide range of different users and applications. At the same time, standards must be selected, adapted, and deployed with care and consideration for possible negative impacts on data providers, knowledge holders, and users. We use several “use cases” to show standards and services that support next-generation research. The presentation concludes with an overview of how CCADI’s standards-based services are being integrated into the global data ecosystem.\n\nID: 393\n\nAgroecology in the North: reframing the conversation around local food production in Indigenous communities\n\nCarla Johnstona, Mindy Priceb, Alex Lattac, Andrew Springc, Jennifer Temmerc, Llyod Chicotd, Jessica Jumboe, Margaret Leishmand\n\naBalsillie School of International Affairs, Waterloo, ON, Canada\n\nbUniversity of California, Berkeley, CA, USA\n\ncWilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo, ON, Canada\n\ndKa’a’gee Tu First Nation, Fort Providence, NT, Canada\n\neSambaa K’e First Nation, Trout Lake, NT, Canada\n\nAbstract: Warming temperatures in the circumpolar north have led to new discussions around climate-driven frontiers for agriculture. As part of ongoing research, we contend that an expansion of the conventional, industrial agriculture paradigm into the Canadian North would have significant socio-cultural and ecological consequences. We propose agroecology as an alternative framework uniquely accordant with northern contexts. In particular, we suggest that there are elements of agroecology that are already being practiced in northern Indigenous communities as part of traditional hunter–gatherer food systems. We present a framework for agroecology in the North and discuss its components of environmental stewardship, economies, knowledge, social dimensions, and governance. This framework was created and put into practice with Sambaa K’e First Nation (SKFN) and Ka’a’gee Tu First Nation (KTFN) in the NT, Canada. With SKFN, the framework was used to co-create a local Agroecology Plan that centers Dene law and values. To support KTFN’s vision of creating an agroforestry food forest, the framework is being used to gather Indigenous Knowledge on traditional edible plants. These projects were co-created using Participatory Action Research methods, including introducing agroecology as a potential framework through open and collaborative meetings, starting new discussion between northern communities and places that practice agro-ecological food-growing methods, and consulting community members about the future of agriculture in their community by incorporating traditional food system knowledge and the values embedded within it.\n\nID: 392\n\nThe frontal ablation and area changes of all marine-terminating glaciers in the Northern Hemisphere between 2000 and 2020\n\nLuke Coplanda, Will Kochtitzkyb, Wesley Van Wychenc, Romain Hugonnetd, Regine Hocke, Julian Dowdeswellf, Toby Benhamf, Tazio Strozzig, Andrey Glazovskyh, Ivan Lavrentievh, David Rouncei, Romain Millanj, Alison Cookk, Abigail Daltona, Hester Jiskootl, Jade Cooleyl, Jacek Janiam, Francisco Navarron\n\naUniversity of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada\n\nbUniversity of New England, Biddeford, ME, USA\n\ncUniversity of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada\n\ndUniversité de Toulouse, Toulouse, France\n\neUniversity of Oslo, Oslo, Norway\n\nfUniversity of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK\n\ngGamma Remote Sensing, Bern, Switzerland\n\nhRussian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia\n\niCarnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA\n\njCNES, Grenoble, France\n\nkScott Association for Marine Science, Oban, UK\n\nlUniversity of Lethbridge, Lethbridge, AB, Canada\n\nmUniversity of Silesia, Katowice, Poland\n\nnUniversidad Politécnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain\n\nAbstract: Glacier mass loss at the ice–ocean interface is referred to as frontal ablation and is required for closing mass balance budgets, understanding factors driving glacier changes across the Arctic, and assessing risks to shipping from icebergs. To date, there hasn’t been a comprehensive assessment of frontal ablation on a hemispheric scale using consistent methods and datasets. In this study, we quantify mean decadal frontal ablation for the northern hemisphere (excluding the Greenland Ice Sheet) for the first time from measurements of ice discharge and terminus position change from 2000 to 2020. A total of 1496 glaciers ended in the ocean in 2000, which reduced to 1327 by 2020. Marine-terminating glaciers contributed an average of 44.5 ± 6.2 Gt a−1 of ice to the ocean from 2000 to 2010 and 52.0 ± 4.6 Gt a−1 from 2010 to 2020. Ice discharge from 2000 to 2020 comprised 78% ± 13% of frontal ablation, with the remainder from terminus retreat. Near-coastal areas most impacted by frontal ablation include Austfonna, Svalbard, central Severnaya Zemlya, the Russian Arctic, and a few Alaskan fjords. Overall, 85% of marine-terminating glaciers retreated while only 2.5% advanced, with the total area of glaciers reducing by an average of just over 1 km2 per day for the past 20 years, for a total loss of 7527 ± 31 km2 between 2000 and 2020.\n\nID: 388\n\nEvolution in surface morphology and velocity of Airdrop Glacier, western Axel Heiberg Island, over a seven-decade long advance\n\nBenoît Lauzona, Luke Coplanda, Wesley Van Wychenb, William Kochtitzkyc, Robert McNabbd\n\naUniversity of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada\n\nbUniversity of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada\n\ncUniversity of New England, Biddeford, ME, USA\n\ndUlster University, Coleraine,UK\n\nAbstract: This study provides the first comprehensive reconstruction of the dynamics of Airdrop Glacier, located on western Axel Heiberg Island, NU. A variety of remotely sensed data, including historical aerial photographs, declassified intelligence satellite photographs, optical satellite imagery (e.g., ASTER, Landsat), and synthetic aperture radar data (e.g., ERS-1, ERS-2) were used to quantify changes in terminus position, ice velocity, and glacier thickness since the 1950s. Observations on Airdrop Glacier show a continuous terminus advance totalling ∼6 km since 1950 and notably less variability in its surface velocities in comparison to adjacent surge-type Iceberg Glacier. This advance can be attributed to high flow rates of Airdrop’s entire surface, resulting in significant thickening near its terminus since at least 1977. Velocities within 7.5 km from the terminus have more than halved over the last 15 years; however, without any clear evidence of previous fast-flow events, we cannot confirm whether Airdrop’s behaviour is cyclic in nature and therefore characteristic of a surge. Instead, Airdrop Glacier could be experiencing a delayed response to positive mass balance conditions of the Little Ice Age, which could also explain the advance of other nearby glaciers. Its recent slowdown could then be indicative of a gradual adjustment to recent climatic conditions. This study highlights the need for comprehensive studies of glacier surging in the Canadian Arctic to improve our understanding of the factors triggering these dynamic instabilities and causing the observed variety of glacier dynamic behaviour.\n\nID: 386\n\nIntermediate spaces for Arctic housing: establishing energy-efficient design and retrofit policies\n\nTarlan Abazaria, Andre Potvina, Claude MH Demersa, Louis Gosselina\n\naUniversité Laval, Québec, QC, Canada\n\nAbstract: This research focuses on developing intermediate spaces, i.e., medium connecting the interior to the exterior, for Canadian Arctic typical housing. Intermediate spaces can promote the performance of Arctic housings in terms of energy efficiency, indoor environmental quality (IEQ), and occupants’ connection to the natural world outside, i.e., identified as biophilic design. Arctic housings have most often been designed with vestibules to reduce heat loss through the entrance and protect mechanically air-conditioned interior spaces. These vestibules are basic examples of intermediate space that is most often used in Arctic buildings. High-performance intermediate spaces have been developed for different buildings in northern Europe. However, such spaces and systems have received negligible attention in architectural design and retrofit policies in Canadian Arctic climates. This research explores the efficacy of intermediate spaces to improve energy performance and indoor environmental qualities of Canadian Arctic housing. The research, specifically, investigated and optimized the architectural features, such as material, glazing ratio, and orientations, of intermediate spaces in relation to energy efficiency and IEQ factors for typical Canadian Arctic housing. Results show that intermediate spaces could improve Arctic housing energy efficiency by up to 20% and IEQ by 14% in terms of thermal and visual performance. The presentation outlines for future research could enlighten policymakers, researchers, and practitioners about considering intermediate spaces as an energy-efficient solution as well as recommending further specific design guidelines and building codes to apply such spaces to Arctic housing.\n\nID: 378\n\nHydrological investigation of the effects of permafrost thaw on High-Arctic watersheds, case study from Eureka Sound Lowlands, Nunavut\n\nKethra Campbell-Heatona, Denis Lacellea\n\naUniversity of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada\n\nAbstract: As temperatures continue to rise in the Canadian Arctic, there is growing concern regarding freshwater quality and quantity and the impact of permafrost thaw to these systems. This project focuses on the hydrological effects of climate-induced permafrost thaw in Eureka, NU. In July 2022, two streams (Station Creek and Blacktop Creek) were sampled daily for geochemistry, oxygen isotopes, dissolved organic carbon, and solute load. Three Solinst Levelogger 5 LTC data loggers were deployed in each stream; loggers were situated above and below an active thaw slump as well as near the stream outlet. The loggers record water temperature, level, and conductivity at 30 min intervals. A daily manual reading of the site’s pH, temperature, and conductivity was recorded to supplement the logger data. Preliminary results show a quick response of both watersheds to the heavy rain event experienced on 14–15 July 2022 (8.4 mm over 28 h). Average discharge for 7–19 July for Station and Blacktop creeks is 0.77 ± 0.53 m3/s and 0.59 ± 0.57 m3/s, respectively. Average δ18O for Station and Blacktop creeks is very similar: −23.7‰ ± 0.13‰ and −23.6‰ ± 0.13‰, respectively. Daily δ18O samples range between −25‰ and −21‰ over the study period, with a ∼3‰ depletion after the rain event. The average D-excess for Station and Blacktop creek is at 2.5 and 2.4, respectively. Results of this project will be used to understand the proportion of moisture sources to these two streams and how these moisture sources will evolve with ongoing climate change in the Arctic.\n\nID: 377\n\nEnvironmental change, eelgrass, and migratory waterfowl in Eeyou Istchee (Quebec) from a Cree knowledge perspective\n\nC. Julián Idroboa\n\naAurora College, Inuvik, NT, Canada\n\nAbstract: The decline of eelgrass in coastal Eeyou Istchee (Eastern James Bay, QC) is the outcome of profound environmental changes linked to anthropogenic activities, climate change, and isostatic rebound. This presentation summarizes the key findings from the Cree Knowledge component of the Eeyou Coastal Habitat Comprehensive Research Project in the communities of Chisasibi and Wemindji. Eeyou Istchee Cree report that eelgrass began to decline in the mid-1980s and crashed in the late 1990s due to reduced salinity and increased silt and erosion in the bay. The interplay between the eelgrass decline and other factors operating from the local to the regional scale affects geese’ feeding behaviour and migration patterns, making them harder to predict and hunt by the Cree. Eelgrass loss and fewer geese in a rapidly changing socio-ecological environment means fewer opportunities for the Cree to be on the land, affecting the continuity of knowledge, practices, values, and the way of life they value. The dialogue between the Cree Knowledge component and the scientific components of the Comprehensive Research Project aims to support evidence-based, Cree-led coastal management geared towards restoring ecological processes alongside strengthening social and cultural relations with the land in Eeyou Istchee.\n\nID: 374\n\nResilience of permafrost environments to disturbances: insights from the long-term stabilization of thermo-erosion gullies on Bylot Island, Nunavut (Canada)\n\nSamuel Gagnona, Daniel Fortierb, Étienne Godina, Karine Riouxb, Audrey Veilletteb\n\naUniversité Laval, Québec, QC, Canada\n\nbUniversité de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada\n\nAbstract: Thermo-erosion gullies (TEGs) commonly form in ice-wedge polygonal networks and are one of the most common forms of abrupt permafrost degradation. Although multiple studies have investigated the short/medium-term (years to decades) effects of TEGs, the long-term (centuries) effects and stabilization processes remain poorly documented. This study aimed to characterize the geomorphological differences between a stabilized TEG and a recent/active one and to determine the state of permafrost after long-term stabilization of a TEG. We compared two TEGs on Bylot Island (NU, Canada): one stabilized (>100 y/o) and one that recently developed (since 1999). We used permafrost cores to analyze the cryo-stratigraphy and permafrost properties of the two TEGs. Our results showed that some younger sections of the recent TEGs were characterized by major geomorphic, hydrological, and thermal disequilibria enhanced by positive feedbacks. In addition, the degradation of this TEG was uneven and changing: some were stabilizing, while others were still degrading, and sometimes they changed from one state to the other. In contrast, the stabilized TEG was not undergoing any degradation process but was still affecting the local hydrological network. We also observed that the cryostratigraphy and active layer thickness of this TEG were comparable to measurements made in unaffected conditions. We concluded that although the formation of a TEG has profound effects in the short/medium term and leaves near permanent geomorphological and hydrological scars in periglacial landscapes, in the long term, Arctic permafrost is able to recover and return to geocryological conditions similar to those pre-dating the initial disturbance.\n\nID: 373\n\nWorking towards standardized, open, and accessible water quality data with DataStream\n\nLindsay Daya, Cristina Cismasua, Carolyn DuBoisa\n\naDataStream Initiative, Gordon Foundation, Toronto, ON, Canada\n\nAbstract: Environmental monitoring programs often make significant investments in program design and capacity building to produce data that can inform decision-making. However, challenges associated with data and metadata formatting and standardization can present a barrier to the communication and use of monitoring data. DataStream is an open-access data sharing platform for Western scientific water and sediment quality data. First established through a collaboration between The Gordon Foundation and the Government of the Northwest Territories in the Mackenzie River basin in 2016, DataStream has grown and evolved to see the needs of community-led, academic, and government monitoring programs throughout Canada. Today, over 28 million unique water-monitoring results have been published on the system by over 230 different monitoring organizations—all of which are made available in a standardized format. In addition, map-based search, data visualization tools, science explainers, and a focus on storytelling help make the platform and the information it contains accessible to a broad audience. In this presentation, we will discuss our path and lessons learned through the development and adoption of appropriate data and metadata standards for the water and sediment quality data published on DataStream.\n\nID: 370\n\nOverview of climate-change-induced hydrological challenges in Yukon\n\nBenoit Turcottea\n\naYukon University, Whitehorse, YT, Canada\n\nAbstract: Climate trends and weather extremes are altering the hydrological regime of subarctic rivers. Several impacts are already documented and monitored, others are expected to gradually materialize, and some may be incubating under the scientific radar. Understanding the current and future effects of climate change on the quantity of water in northern creeks, rivers, and lakes involves sharing knowledge, monitoring targeted processes, performing key observations, and thinking differently. The analysis of hydrological data may inform some level of adaptation, but the complexity of Nature does not only reveal itself through numbers and statistics, and in many cases sustainable community adaptation such as erosion control or flood protection, although urgent, is not ready for implementation. This presentation portrays an overview of how water levels and channel patterns are changing in a diversity of northern watersheds. With the contribution of various collaborators, it also describes specific examples of confirmed and probable hydrological changes and water-related challenges that are affecting northern communities and critical infrastructure. The ultimate objective of this presentation is to provide a balanced overview of what we know about the impact of climate change on Yukon watersheds but also of what we don’t know and that prevents hydrological resilience.\n\nID: 369\n\nDoes something smell funny in this forest? An examination of muskox ecology below treeline\n\nKevin Chana, Jan Adamczewskia\n\naEnvironment and Natural Resources Government of the Northwest Territories, Yellowknife, NT, Canada\n\nAbstract: Muskox are an important and traditional dietary resource in many Arctic communities while also having economic, sociocultural, and environmental importance. While muskoxen were almost extirpated in northern Canada, extant populations in the mainland Northwest Territories (NT) have recently rebounded and are expanding beyond their previous known range. Despite being typically associated with barrenlands and High Arctic, the majority of muskox populations in the mainland NT occur at or below treeline. However, as the muskox distribution continues to expand southward, information on muskox ecology below the treeline remains limited. Using recent surveys and observations of muskox in the Sahtu and North Slave regions, we examine the habitat selection, demography, and health of two separate populations of muskox undergoing expansion below treeline in the mainland NT. This review highlights previous and ongoing work within the NT on muskoxen below the treeline and identifies gaps in knowledge for future study. It is uncertain how the increasing muskox range and distribution will affect the ecological community as a whole, and it follows that management decisions will benefit from a greater understanding of muskox ecology across their entire range.\n\nID: 368\n\nAre all fish the same? Individual specialization in an Arctic fish population\n\nStephanie Chana, Harri Pettitt-Wadeb, Lisa Losetoc,d, Nigel Husseyb, Tristan Pearcea\n\naUniversity of Northern British Columbia, Prince George, BC, Canada\n\nbUniversity of Windsor, Windsor, ON, Canada\n\ncUniversity of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada\n\ndFisheries and Oceans Canada, Winnipeg, MB, Canada\n\nAbstract: Climate-driven changes are altering Arctic marine ecosystems, forcing many species to adapt. Natural populations are often phenotypically diverse individuals that benefit from variation in resource use. This diversity, also referred to as individual specialization, can be driven by variations in morphology potentially related to specialized feeding behaviors and is useful for understanding the adaptability of fish populations to changing environments. Greenland cod (Gadus ogac) contribute to the functioning of coastal marine food webs and are an important food source for Inuit. The aim of this study was to measure individual specialization in an Arctic fish population. Greenland cod were collected along the marine coast of Ulukhaktok, NT (n = 45). Morphometric analysis was used to compare individua"
