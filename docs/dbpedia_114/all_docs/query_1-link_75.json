        "text": "Spring is one of the most highly anticipated seasons, but also one of the most unpredictable. Every year, Calgarians optimistically wait for the winter snow to melt, so they can break out the patio furniture and start preparing their gardens. However, the arrival of spring in Alberta is rarely smooth. April snowfalls regularly coat the brown landscape, but with the help of warm sunshine, that moisture is responsible for new growth. Before you know it, green grass shoots up, trees begin to bud, and early flowers burst into colour across the city.\n\nFrom late April to June, you can spot certain plants, shrubs and trees flowering in an array of colours across our parks, greenspaces, neighbourhoods, you name it. Perhaps you want to plan a photoshoot, pack a picnic or simply stop to smell the scent the next time you’re out for a daily walk or on a weekend adventure. We’ve compiled a short list of early-blooming flowers you can expect to see during springtime, and where to find them in Calgary below.\n\nIf you’re looking for more spring activities, local recommendations and outdoor motivation ideas to get you outside, download your free YYC Spring Into Action Guide here.\n\nFind These Calgary Wildflowers, Shrubs & Trees In Bloom This Spring\n\nPrairie Crocuses\n\nThis iconic Alberta wildflower is among the first to bloom, so spotting them means warmer weather is coming. You can recognize its distinct bell shape with six petals and a purple or occasionally white colour. They grow low to the ground with fuzzy, fern-like foliage, so keep your eyes peeled! Some good places to find them in Calgary are Nose Hill, Bowmont Park, 12 Mile Coulee and almost any sunny, grassy hillsides.\n\nLilacs\n\nDepending on the variety, these shrubs can grow from 8- to 15 feet, and bloom in purple and white shades. Featuring large clusters of heart-shaped leaves, these fragrant bushes bloom from late May into early June. They can be spotted throughout neighbourhoods and Calgary parks, including Prince’s Island Park, Riley Park and Reader Rock Garden. You can also find a high concentration of them in the downtown Mission community, where the annual 4th Street Lilac Festival is celebrated. It’s the perfect opportunity to engage with your community and wander the pedestrian-only market with over 500 vendors and 70+ performances.\n\nGolden Beans\n\nAlso known as the ‘Buffalo Bean,’ you can find these bright yellow flowers throughout the Alberta prairies and Calgary parks. Blooming mid-May to June, watch as these golden pea-like flowers turn the hillsides yellow. We’ve found them in Nose Hill Park, Bowmont Park and Fish Creek Provincial Park — let us know if you’ve seen them in other places too!\n\nApple Trees\n\nJust like any fruit-bearing tree, it all starts with a flower. From late April into May, countless varieties of apple trees bloom pink and white throughout Calgary neighbourhoods and parks. You can find these fragrant, stunning trees in Murdoch Park, Baker Park, Edworthy Park, Confederation Park, River Park, Reader Rock Garden, and beyond.\n\nMayday Trees\n\nKnown for its early spring blossoms and hardy nature, the Mayday tree can grow up to 9 meters at full maturity. They produce clusters of fragrant white flowers starting late April into May (hence the name). Throughout the Beltline and many residential areas, you’ll find these popular trees as they’re low maintenance and beautiful.\n\nSaskatoon Bushes\n\nOften mistaken for blueberries, these clusters of white flowers turn into blue-ish, purple-ish berries come summer. This hearty bush has adapted to the climate and you can find them in gardens, parks and natural areas throughout YYC. Some have been spotted near Fort Calgary, but keep your eyes peeled for others in deep ravines, or low-land parks.\n\nBlue Violets\n\nThese delicate wildflowers feature heart-shaped leaves and 5 petals ranging from light purple to deep. With a unique shape of one large petal on the bottom, two upper & side petals forming a hood-like structure. Between April and May, these flowers only last for a few weeks. So find them throughout the long grass in Nose Hill, Bowmont Park, 12 Mile Coulee, and Fish Creek Provincial Park.\n\nCarpet Phlox\n\nThis perennial is great for ground cover in gardens and produces an abundance of colourful flowers. Depending on the variety, it comes in all shades of pink, purple, white and red. Blooming early- to mid-spring in Calgary, you’ll find carpet phlox thriving in areas with lots of sunshine, like Bowmont Park.\n\nWildflowers, Trees & Shrubs\n\nThis list of plants, shrubs and trees in Calgary only scratches the surface of spring blossoms you can find here. Our abundance of greenspaces and a wide variety of landscapes make YYC a great home for different species of wildflowers, blooming trees and shrubs. So, next time you’re out and about, pay attention to what you see in and around your neighbourhood, local parks and pathways.\n\nIf you’re a flower fiend, we recommend checking out Silver Springs Botanical Garden, Reader Rock Garden, Prince’s Island Park and Senator Patrick Burns Memorial Rock Garden for beautifully manicured and tended beds.\n\nDo you know other places where these above-mentioned flowers can be spotted in YYC?
