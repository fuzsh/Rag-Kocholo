We are excited to welcome Senator Debbie Stabenow, Chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, and Congressman Glenn “GT” Thompson, Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, as our keynote speakers.\n\nEnjoy cocktails in the National Herb Garden and a tented dinner in view of the Capitol Columns. Spend a wonderful fall evening with colleagues, business leaders, and government representatives. The Dinner is a fantastic way to mix and mingle — senior staff and officials from Capitol Hill and the Administration will be invited, however attendance cannot be guaranteed.\n\nBy attending the Dinner, you support FONA’s work supporting and promoting the National Arboretum. As its primary 501(c)(3) nonprofit partner, we complement the National Arboretum’s work by ensuring its research and gardens are a resource for DC residents and tourists from around the world. We also invite visitors of all ages to form deep and mindful relationships with nature through education programs, recreation programs, and events."
