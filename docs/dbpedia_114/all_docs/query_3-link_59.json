There are over 20,000 species of daisies. They are characterized by their composite flower structure, consisting of a central disk of small, tightly packed flowers called disk florets, surrounded by a ring of larger, more showy flowers called ray florets. This combination of disk and ray florets gives daisies their distinctive appearance.\n\nDaisies are found all over the world and come in various shapes, sizes, and colors. They are often grown for their ornamental value and used in gardens, and flower arrangements.\n\nAfrican Daisy (Arctotis)\n\nArctotis, commonly known as African daisy or Gousblom, is a genus of annual or perennial herbs and shrubs, typically growing to about 1-3 feet (30-90 cm) tall and wide.
