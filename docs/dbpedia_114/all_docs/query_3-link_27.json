        "text": "In this article, you will learn to grow perennial late season asters in your outdoor living space, you’ll find a wide assortment of species and cultivated varieties from which to choose, and you’ll also discover some unique plants that are called asters, but don’t fit the general description.\n\nHere’s what’s in store:\n\nWe’ve got a lot to cover, so let’s get started!\n\nCultivation and History\n\nAt one time, almost 600 aster-like perennial flowers were classified as asters. However, the botanical taxonomy was revised in the 1990s, and now about 180 varieties native to Asia and Europe are classified as “true” asters.\n\nWith the botanical reclassification, North American species were regrouped into various genera, including:\n\nDoellingeria\n\nEurybia\n\nIonactis\n\nSymphyotrichum\n\nHowever, all are still called asters in common parlance, and it is not uncommon to find many identified by their original classifications in horticultural and merchandising literature.\n\nThe word “aster” is Latin for star.\n\nAnother common name for the fall-blooming perennial varieties is the “Michaelmas daisy.” It is derived from the flowers’ bloom time, which is often around the Christian feast day of St. Michael on September 26th. This name remains popular in Britain.\n\nWild species range in height from the three- to six-inch heath type, S. ericoides, with a spread of three to 12 inches, to three- to six-foot New York, S. belgii, that spreads two to three feet across.\n\nCultivated varieties are often more compact and feature enhancements such as disease resistance, wider zone suitability, and greater shade tolerance.\n\nPlants grow in a clumping fashion and have upright stems.\n\nThe North American types have sprays of multiple blossoms at their terminal ends, with diameters of one-half to one inch across.\n\nEuropean and Asian species have fewer, larger flowers per stem that measure approximately two inches across.\n\nThe stems are green or brown, hairy or smooth, and sometimes woody.\n\nThe foliage is green and may vary, with unique characteristics such as hairy or smooth, deeply serrated or smooth edged, broad or narrow, heart-shaped, or bronze in the fall.\n\nThe flowers have a daisy-like yellow center disc that contains florets, or many small flowers. In some species, it turns red-brown during the growing season.\n\nAnd as mentioned, the rays, or petals, are blue, pink, purple, or white.\n\nPlants tend to be vigorous growers that naturalize via shallow roots and self-sowing. Cultivated varieties may produce seed that is not viable, or that produces characteristics and plants with a level of quality that differ from the parent from which they came.\n\nA Look Back\n\nHistorically, the leaves of some species were used by herbal practitioners. Those of the New England S. novae-angliae were often used to relieve pulmonary distress.\n\nBy the 1700s, British plant hunters brought wild and wooly North American native species back to England to breed new and exciting cultivars.\n\nBy the 1800s, a cultural shift from formal to more informal gardening in England’s botanical showplaces boosted the flowers’ popularity.\n\nAnd in the 20th century, commercial production brought new innovations in flower color, size, and form, as well as height.\n\nA Broad Range\n\nToday, we enjoy an ever-increasing variety of cultivars suited to home gardening. And that weedy flora the British botanists sought is now appreciated for its essential role in providing habitat for local wildlife, especially the beneficial pollinators that evolved with and depend upon them in their native settings.\n\nOne species endemic to Europe that has remained prevalent in the wild is the Italian aster, Aster amellus, a widely hybridized variety with many cultivars.\n\nIt is one of the exceptions to the norm that we mentioned at the outset, and grows best in Zones 3 to 10 with slightly alkaline soil.\n\nHowever, others that are seldom cultivated sometimes become quite rare, like the North American serpentine species, S. depauperatum.\n\nA Note of Caution:\n\nPlease remember: when walking in nature, admire but don’t disturb the wildflowers. Not only do they not take well to transplanting, you may inadvertently deplete a threatened species.\n\nAnd finally, to round out our introductory deep-dive into this large group of plants, in addition to the perennial fall-blooming types, there are others that fall under the aster umbrella, including the spring-blooming perennial Alpine, A. alpinus, the midsummer to fall blooming annual China aster, Callistephus chinensis, and the spring to midsummer blooming Stoke’s, Stokesia laevis.\n\nAs you can see, when we say, “aster,” we may be referring to any of a host of flowering floral species, many of which are unrelated to any of the qualifying genera. When shopping, specify “perennial late-season” or “fall-blooming” to find what you seek.\n\nPropagation\n\nTo grow your own fall-blooming perennial asters, you’ll need to start with seeds, soft stem cuttings, divisions, or nursery plants. Let’s explore each method.\n\nFrom Seed\n\nStart seeds indoors about four weeks before the last average spring frost date for your region.\n\nUse biodegradable seed starter cells filled with a good quality potting medium.\n\nSow one or two seeds per cell.\n\nBarely cover the seeds with 1/8 inch of potting medium.\n\nMaintain even moisture, but do not oversaturate.\n\nPlace the cells in a sunny location.\n\nWhen the seedlings have two sets of true leaves, thin them to one per cell.\n\nAfter the danger of frost has passed, set the cells outside for a few hours a day for three to four days to “harden off,” or acclimate to the outdoors.\n\nTransplant the seedlings to the garden or containers that can accommodate mature dimensions.\n\nPlace entire starter cells into the ground so that the seedlings are at the same depth they were in the starter cells.\n\nTamp down and water to secure them in the ground.\n\nMaintain an inch of water per week in the absence of rain.\n\nAlternatively, you may direct sow seeds after the danger of spring frost has passed.\n\nAt season’s end, you can also harvest seeds for later planting. However, remember that only true species, not cultivated varieties, produce replicas of a parent, and some hybrids are sterile.\n\nFrom Soft Stem Cuttings\n\nOne way to replicate the traits of a parent is to take soft stem cuttings from an existing plant.\n\nThe best time to do this is in late spring or early summer.\n\nYou’ll need to use sanitized pruning shears to cut a six-inch length of the topmost portion of a soft, young stem.\n\nRemove the leaves from the bottom three to four inches of the stem.\n\nDip the cut end of the stem into rooting hormone powder.\n\nPlace the dipped cutting into a biodegradable starter pot filled with rooting or a porous potting medium, burying it to a depth of two to three inches.\n\nMaintain even moisture, but don’t let it get soggy.\n\nPlace the pot in a sunny location.\n\nAn optional action you may take is to cover the pot loosely with a clear plastic bag to create a mini greenhouse. Just take care to keep it out of direct sunlight that may cook the foliage.\n\nWhen you see new growth, you’ll know that cuttings have established roots and you can transfer the entire starter pot to the garden or a permanent container.\n\nBe sure to set the starter pot into the soil so that its surface is at ground level.\n\nBy Division\n\nAnother way to multiply a favorite variety is by digging up an established clump and cutting it into two or more sections that can be replanted as desired.\n\nPlease consult our guide to dividing perennial asters for instructions.\n\nWhile many asters form woody clumps, others do not. When you dig up non-woody types, you have the option of cutting the clumps into sections with multiple shoots, or of teasing the soft-stemmed individual shoots apart to be planted singly.\n\nFrom Nursery Plants\n\nLocal and online nurseries offer established potted varieties for transplant to the home garden.\n\nUpon purchase, unpot the plant. Leaving the majority of the potting soil attached, gently loosen any compacted roots, and settle it into the ground at the same depth it was in the nursery pot.\n\nTamp the soil, water well, and maintain moisture with an inch of water per week.\n\nHow to Grow\n\nAfter the last average frost date of spring, find a sunny to partly shady location with average to organically-rich soil that drains well. As mentioned, the ideal pH is slightly acidic, within a range of 5.1 to 6.8.\n\nContact your local agricultural extension about doing a soil test to determine the characteristics of the earth in your landscape.\n\nWork the soil to a depth of eight to 12 inches. Amend as needed with compost to increase the acidity a bit and improve soil quality and drainage. A little sphagnum peat will also increase acidity.\n\nDepending upon mature dimensions, you’ll need to sow seed or transplant stem cuttings, divisions, or nursery plants between eight and 36 inches apart to allow for their maximum widths.\n\nProper spacing promotes good airflow and inhibits humidity buildup and fungal spore activation.\n\nFor seeds, sprinkle some at the appropriate intervals, bury them in 1/8 inch of soil, and thin seedlings to one per interval when they have two sets of true leaves.\n\nFor stem cuttings, divisions, and nursery plants, space them, and settle them into the ground at the same depth they are growing in their original containers.\n\nIf you are growing in containers, be sure to choose those that can accommodate mature dimensions, plus an inch for your watering can spout to fit. As the roots are shallow, a depth of 12 inches should accommodate most types.\n\nOnce planted, apply a well-balanced, slow-release, all-purpose granular fertilizer per package instructions. Sprinkle it on the soil near but not on the stems, to avoid burning them.\n\nYou may add a two-inch layer of mulch around but not touching the stems, to aid in moisture retention and weed control. Keep it at a distance to discourage fungal development at the stem bases.\n\nAfter the first year, landscape plants only need supplemental water in dry spells. As for container gardening, you will need to remain vigilant, as pots dry out quicker than ground soil.\n\nBy the time fall comes, your flora will be firmly established and ready for winter.\n\nGrowing Tips\n\nMaintain even moisture during germination and discontinue watering once established, except during dry spells.\n\nSpace to accommodate mature dimensions and inhibit fungal growth.\n\nSave seeds if you like, but don’t expect them to produce the quality or characteristics of the parent.\n\nTake care not to oversaturate the soil, as that opens the door to fungal spore development.\n\nPruning and Maintenance\n\nIn early spring, fertilize with an all-purpose, slow-release, well-balanced granular product. Sprinkle it around, but not touching the stems, and water it in.\n\nSpring is also the time to change the layer of mulch, taking care to leave airspace around the stems to inhibit fungal growth.\n\nKeep the garden weeded during the growing season, to inhibit competition for water and deter pests and pathogens. Mulch aids in this endeavor.\n\nFor first-year plants, maintain an inch of water per week. Water established ones during dry spells, as needed.\n\nEarly on, between late spring and early summer, pinch back the growing tips by one-third. This encourages more bushy, less leggy growth, lateral stems, and blooms.\n\nAs plants mature, it may be necessary to stake tall ones with sticks and twine, to keep them from flopping over.\n\nAnd as flower stems finish blooming, you may want to prune them off to limit the self-sowing of seeds.\n\nYou can read about pruning perennial asters here.\n\nFor most varieties, dividing every three years or so is advised. For extremely vigorous growers, you can do it every year. Dividing restores vigor, resulting in better flower production.\n\nPlease see our guide to managing asters in the garden for even more ways to care for your flowers.\n\nIn addition to these species and cultivars, some others you may like are:\n\nPurple early-spring blooming Alpine aster, A. alpinus.\n\nAnnual China aster, C. chinensis, in an array of colors and bicolors.\n\nPurple late-blooming Tatarian, A. tataricus, with its preference for slightly alkaline soil.\n\nWhite wood, Eurybia divaricata, a low-water species that tolerates drought, heavy shade, and poor soil.\n\nSmooth, S. laeve, a blue to lavender, full sun, low-water, drought tolerant species.\n\nThere are options for everyone, with some cultivars having larger, brighter flowers, and others more reminiscent of their wildflower forebears, with what seem like clouds of tiny pastel blossoms.\n\nWith so many to choose from, take care to check details such as recommended growing zones, soil pH, and tolerance for shade when selecting the perfect blooms for your landscape.\n\nAlso, select products that have been bred for superior disease resistance when possible.\n\nManaging Pests and Disease\n\nWhen you start with quality products, especially those bred to be highly resistant to pests common to Asteraceae flowers, you have the best chance of having few problems.\n\nHowever, circumstances beyond our control, like summers with heavy rainfall, may foil our best efforts.\n\nSome pests to watch for are:\n\nAphids\n\nChrysanthemum Lace Bugs\n\nCucumber Beetles\n\nLeaf Miners\n\nNematodes\n\nSlugs and Snails\n\nTarsenoid Mites\n\nCommon diseases include:\n\nAster Yellows\n\nLeaf Spot\n\nPowdery Mildew\n\nRust\n\nStem Canker\n\nWhite Smut\n\nOne way to inhibit insects and the pathogens they carry is by planting diverse flora that attracts beneficial pollinators that feed on pests.\n\nAnother way is to divide clumps every few years to optimize their health and resistance, and to move them to new locations. This decreases exposure to fungal spores that may winter over from previous years.\n\nBest Uses\n\nWith their abundance of small to tiny blooms, fall-blooming perennial asters are considered a “filler” flower in the floral industry.\n\nTheir form lends itself to filling gaps between other plants, especially as summer specimens wane and leave spaces in the garden.\n\nThe larger species and cultivated varieties make great backdrops at the backs of beds, and especially in front of foundations.\n\nThey also do quite well with other tall seasonal species that lend each other support and look well in mixed meadows.\n\nPlanted en masse, the blooms merge into soft swaths of color that play well with other seasonal perennials as well as autumn leaves.\n\nThe more plants you have, the bigger the “cloud” of color is that you create.\n\nFor small to midsize types, front of bed and border as well as container placements work well.\n\nOne aspect of these vigorous bloomers to be aware of is that they tend to lose their lower leaves when they experience water stress, usually from hot temperatures and dryness, but sometimes from oversaturation.\n\nHere in the Northeast, I see this late in the season, when we have a resurgence of summer heat and humidity. The bottom foliage yellows and drops, leaving unsightly bare “legs.”\n\nTo anticipate this and not have an eyesore on your hands, place smaller seasonal flora in front to shield the lower stems in butterfly, cottage, and cutting gardens.\n\nThere are many excellent companion plants for asters that share similar cultural requirements for sun, soil, and water, including:\n\nMixed groupings that include asters enjoy its lush foliage throughout the summer. Then it bursts into bloom as a backdrop to late-season specimens.\n\nThose with contrasting colors, vertical heights, and robust textures make for appealing contrasts.\n\nDon’t forget to pair your favorites with compatible ground-covering plants, as this is another way to keep water-hogging weeds at bay."
