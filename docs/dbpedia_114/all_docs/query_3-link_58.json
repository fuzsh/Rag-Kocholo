The costs indicated below are only an estimate for one academic year and may be different from the student's total expenditures. They do not include tuition remission, scholarships, assistantships, stipends or any other funding the student might receive nor do they include expenses for travel, books or supplies, the estimated cost of living, or additional fees charged by the relative division of study. The University reserves the right to change tuition, fees, requirements and regulations without notice.\n\nProof of medical insurance is required of all graduate students. International students and their dependents must be covered by the SMU student health plan.\n\nAdditionally, the Texas State Legislature has revised the meningitis vaccination policy for students enrolled in higher education, effective October 1, 2013. Per this new requirement, all new students under the age of 22 will be required to show proof of a vaccination 10 days prior to the first day of class. For more information about the policy, visit the SMU Student Health Center. It is advised to seek vaccination through your physician/clinic under your current health insurance policy. Cost of the vaccination through the SMU Student Health Center starts at $150.\n\nTuition & Fees for the Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 Academic Year\n\nProgram Tuition per Hour Fees per Hour Hours per Term Hours per Year Total Tuition per Year\n\nThe general student fee for Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 academic year is $293 per term credit hour, not to exceed $3,484 per term.\n\n*The MFA in Theatre is a 66 hour/3 year program with years 1 & 2 totaling 24 hours each and year 3 totaling 18 hours.\n\n**The Part Time option with the discounted tuition for the Master of Music in Music Education is not available to International Students.\n\n†Full time music majors also have a $150 fee each semester in addition to recital and practice room fees which may be charged based on enrollment and will not be covered by scholarships.
