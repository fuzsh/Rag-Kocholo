        "text": "Nature lovers rejoice! We’re coming at you with a complete guide to how to identify a tree in Alberta.\n\nWith about 180 tree species in Canada, 28 of which are found in Alberta, and over 318 billion individual trees, our country knows dendrology.\n\nWhat’s even more impressive is that with close to 362 million hectares of woodland area, Canada is home to 10% of the world’s forests.\n\nHow to identify a tree: Start by learning the 2 main types\n\nTrees, whether they’re in Alberta or anywhere else in Canada, are divided into two broad categories:\n\nDeciduous: Also called broadleaf or hardwood trees, most deciduous trees drop their leaves in the fall.\n\nConifers: Also known as evergreens, softwoods, or needle-leaved trees (with some exceptions), most coniferous trees keep their needles year-round.\n\nNow that we’ve defined tree types, let’s cover how to identify a tree starting from these two broad categories. Our team of professional arborists have put together expert tips and tricks for tree recognition that you can use year-round.\n\nA quick guide for how to identify common tree species in Alberta\n\nWhat if you’re an Albertan who can’t identify a tree? Not to worry. There’s a quick way to do it.\n\nUse the Guide to the Common Native Trees and Shrubs of Alberta key to help you quickly master the art of identifying trees:\n\nLeaf type:\n\nBroadleaf (deciduous trees),\n\nLeaf arrangement:\n\nSimple: one main leaf per stem.\n\nCompound: many small leaves (called leaflets) per stem.\n\nLeaf pattern:\n\nOpposite: Leaves are attached opposite each other along a stem.\n\nAlternate: Leaflets are attached alternately to one another along the stem.\n\nNeedle (coniferous trees)\n\nNeedle arrangement:\n\nSheathed Needles: Two needles attach together at the same point on the stem.\n\nUnsheathed Needles: One needle attaches on its own on the stem.\n\nIf you follow this simple key, you’ll find yourself much, much closer to being able to name the trees you’re looking at.\n\nThe 20 Most Common Alberta Trees\n\nYou’re now well on your way to becoming an Alberta tree identification guru. Time to get to know the names of trees found in your province. Here’s a sampling:\n\nDeciduous Species\n\nColumnar or Shade:\n\nBirch\n\nColumnar Aspen\n\nElm\n\nGreen Ash\n\nLinden\n\nNorthwest Poplar\n\nOak\n\nTrembling Aspen\n\nWillow\n\nFruits or Flowering:\n\nAmerican Mountain Ash\n\nCrabapple\n\nHawthorn\n\nMayday\n\nSchubert Chokecherry\n\nTree Lilac\n\nUssurian Pear\n\nConiferous Species\n\nColorado Spruce\n\nNorway Spruce\n\nSiberian Larch\n\nWhite Spruce\n\nWe also wrote another blog about common Alberta tree species a few years back. The information still applies. Have a read here.\n\n9 of the best tree identification guides\n\nIf you’re the type that likes to kick it old school, then a physical guide is for you.\n\nWith dozens of options of guides, some of which are hardcover books the size of a phonebook, we’ve narrowed down the list for you to 9 of the best paperbacks:\n\nNational Geographic Pocket Guide to Trees and Shrubs of North America by Bland Crowder\n\nNational Audubon Society Trees of North America\n\nThe Sibley Guide to Trees\n\nA Peterson Field Guide To Western Trees\n\nWhat’s that Tree? A Beginner’s Guide by DK\n\nTrees of Western North America\n\nTrees and Shrubs of Alberta by Lone Pine\n\nTrees and Shrubs of Alberta by Kathleen Wilkinson\n\nPlants Of The Western Forest: Alberta, Saskatchewan And Manitoba Boreal And Aspen Parkland\n\nOr, you can save trees and choose a tree ID app instead. We’ll leaf through these options next.\n\nEasy tree identification: There’s an app for that\n\nSay goodbye to telephone book-sized plant identification guides. Now you can get the same amount of information in the form of a tiny app.\n\nIn the age of smartphones, a germinating arborist can have the power of plant recognition at their fingertips. (Or, is it at their thumbs?)\n\nStop carrying around heavy field guides and start downloading digital tree field guides.\n\nNext up: we’ll share a list of tree ID apps to get you started.\n\nThe 10 best apps for identifying trees\n\nHere are 10 of our favourite tree identification apps. Most come in a basic free version and a more extensive paid version. All are available to download from the Apple and/or Google app stores.\n\nDeciduous Trees 2.0\n\nIdentitree Starter Kit\n\niNaturalist (& Seek by iNaturalist) for Android/iOS\n\nLeafSnap-Plant Identification – Android/iOS\n\nMyTree App\n\nMy Tree ID by Texas A&M Forest Service (TFS)\n\nNatureID\n\nPictureThis\n\nPlantNet Plant Identification for ​​Android/iOS\n\nvTree Virginia Tech Tree ID by Virginia Tech Dendrology\n\nWhat if you’re not interested in rifling through an app to figure out what plant you’re looking at, why not get your phone to do it for you? Find out what we mean next.\n\nHow to identify a tree with a photo\n\nPhoto identification is another option for tree lovers. It works like Shazam for photos. The principle is simple:\n\nSnap a picture with your phone of a tree you want to ID,\n\nUpload the pic to a photo ID site,\n\nClick identify, and\n\nWait for your answer to arrive!\n\nIf you’re wondering where to get started with photo recognition software, here are two options:\n\nGoogle Lens: Technically an app, Google Lens lets users use their desktop smartphone camera or an existing image to search for what they want.\n\nSnap a photo of a tree you’d like to ID and—Bam!—Lens will tell you what it is.\n\nLens is available on all devices, by typing google.ca in your website browser, and in your favourite apps.\n\nPl@ntNet: This is a website that works in a similar way to Lens. The big difference: it’s plant-specific and covers more than trees.\n\nIf you’re a tech nerd who doesn’t want to go the retro field book route but wants to do more than use click-n-name photo identification, we recommend using an online interactive key.\n\nRead on to discover our list of favourites.\n\nHow to identify a tree using an interactive online field guide\n\nSomewhere between paperback field guides, apps, and photo identification tools are online field guides. These interactive tree identification keys are step-by-step tools you can use to ID plants.\n\nA few examples include:\n\nInteractive Tree Identification Key by Iowa State University\n\nWhat Tree Is It? by OPLIN\n\nTree Guide to Trees by National Geographic Kids\n\nTree Identification Guide by Discover Life – very dated in terms of design but still helpful!\n\nGuide to the Common Native Trees and Shrubs of Alberta – although more of a manual user guide than an interactive tool.\n\nWhat if you’re out in the wild without your field guide, manual, or phone? Gasp! Or, what if you’re the type who wants to learn how to ID trees using simple tips all year long?\n\nWe can help there, too. Keep reading for our seasonal tree ID’ing tips.\n\nTree identification tips for every season\n\nBudding horticultural experts can use the following seasonal-tips to name any tree no matter the weather.\n\nKeep these main characteristics in mind when naming Alberta trees:\n\nType\n\nBark\n\nShape\n\nBuds\n\nTwigs\n\nFlowers\n\nLeaves\n\nFruit\n\nLocation & Distribution\n\nDifferent characteristics will help you name trees during different seasons.\n\nWe’ll begin with the trickiest season for plan identification: winter.\n\n1. Winter: All about the bark\n\nThe best way to identify Alberta trees in the winter is by 3 things:\n\n1. Type\n\nA quick way to narrow down which tree species you’re looking at in the wintertime is whether or not it’s missing leaves (deciduous) or whether it still has its needles* (coniferous).\n\n*The one exception to this rule: the larch, a coniferous tree that is not an evergreen because it drops its needles in the fall.\n\n2. Bark\n\nAfter Alberta broadleaf trees have dropped their leaves, the best way to identify them easily is by the colour and texture of their bark. Is it pale or dark? Furrowed or smooth? Papery or flaky?\n\nWhat about colour? Is the bark:\n\nCinnamon,\n\nCopper\n\nGreenish-white (aspen)\n\nGrey\n\nSilver (beech)\n\nWhite (birch)\n\n3. Shape\n\nScan the trees in your neighbourhood and on your property and you’ll quickly be able to pick out distinct shapes.\n\nIf a tree is conical, or shaped like an inverted cone, it’s most likely an evergreen.\n\nIf the tree is a hardwood, look at the branches. Do the branches grow out from the trunk horizontally or more vertically? Does the overall shape bend gracefully upward, like a curved funnel, or does it appear more angular and thick throughout?\n\n2. Spring: Buds and flowers for the win\n\nIn the spring, two these two details to give a name to Alberta tree species:\n\n1. Buds\n\nBuds are great details to help ID trees. They can be used throughout the winter and spring and look the same regardless of how old a tree is.\n\nWhat is the shape, size, colour, and form of the buds? Are they scaly or smooth? Bare or covered in peach fuzz? Do you notice a larger bud at the end of the twig (terminal buds) or only buds along the twig (lateral buds)?\n\n2. Twigs\n\nTwigs can be used all year to ID trees as well. Take note of their texture (are they smooth or ribbed?), and whether or not they have hair or spines.\n\n3. Flowers\n\nAlberta trees only bloom in the spring. Their flowers are a great help with tree identification because they vary so much in their colour, scent, arrangement, bloom timing, and reproductive structures.\n\nWhat’s more:\n\nBroadleaf trees have flowers for reproduction, and\n\nConifers generally have cones for reproduction.\n\n3. Summer: Leaves, please\n\nFinally! It’s summer. Arguably the easiest season for ID’ing trees, novice horticulturalists can finally use leaves to help name their local trees.\n\n1. Leaves\n\nHere are the characteristics to look for when identifying broadleaf species via their leaves:\n\nShape. Common leaf shapes include:\n\nCordate (heart-shaped)\n\nDeltoid (triangular)\n\nLanceolate (long and narrow)\n\nLobbed (oak)\n\nRound (orbicular)\n\nOvate (egg-shaped)\n\nPalm-shaped (maple)\n\nSize.\n\nSimilar species of trees may have the exact same shape of leaf but their size is different.\n\n2. Fruit\n\nSimilarly to flowers, the type of fruit a species has first depends on whether you’re looking at a deciduous or evergreen tree.\n\nDeciduous:\n\nAcorns (oak)\n\nCatkins (willows)\n\nCones (alder)\n\nLarge fleshy fruits with seeds (e.g., crabapples, pears).\n\nPapery winged fruits of maple,\n\nNuts (chestnut)\n\nEvergreen:\n\nCones are the fruit of conifers and contain the seeds needed for reproduction\n\n4. Fall: Colour me identified\n\nFor our last season of the year, we bring in colour again as a tree identical tool.\n\nColour\n\nFrom golden larch needles to vibrant orange ash leaves, fall gives a beautiful way to spot various trees.\n\nTiming of colour change\n\nAsh trees tend to change colour later in the fall compared to, say, mayday species.\n\nKeep in mind factors like moisture levels, latitude, and altitude also affect the timing of when leaves change colour. In drier years, leaves will turn faster compared to wetter years.\n\nWhen leaves drop\n\nAs with when leaves change colour you can also identify Alberta trees from when leaves fall. Some species will drop theirs weeks before other species.\n\nHow to Identify A Tree In Your Backyard: When You’re Stuck, Call The Experts\n\nWe hope you’ve liked our arborist’s guide to how to identify a tree in Alberta.
