        "text": "Written by Mitchell Galarneau\n\nHave you ever walked along the side of a river and noticed the many smooth rocks, pebbles, and stones within it? Have you ever wondered where these came from or how they are made? There are so many to be found in the Edmonton area from the massive North Saskatchewan River to smaller streams like the Mill Creek. These rocks share an awesome history of both the power of water as well as the ancient material in our own province! To learn a bit more about the different rocks all around us we decided to consult our Wild Child rock expert, Magma! With his amazing background in Earth Sciences, Magma is the person to talk to for anything and everything about rocks and minerals.\n\nRiver Journey\n\nPebbles in our Edmonton area usually start their journey all the way back to the Rocky Mountains. With the changing seasons, water and ice begin to break apart the mountains into jagged pieces of stone that then fall into the raging streams. The process of moving rocks from one place to another is known as erosion. As the rocks are eroded away from the mountains, they collide with other rocks, sediments, and even the bottoms of rivers. In doing so, bits and pieces of the rocks are chipped away, and the rock undergoes what is known as weathering. Rivers continually pick up new rocks, deposit old rocks, and weather them until they are smooth, all the while making them smaller and smaller.\n\nEdmonton’s very own North Saskatchewan River!\n\nTypes of Rocky Rocks\n\nThere are three main types of rocks: Igneous, Sedimentary, and Metamorphic. What’s awesome is that we can find all three of these types in the pebbles of Edmonton rivers. These three rocks are formed by melting, cooling, eroding, compacting, or even deforming.\n\nSmashing Good Time\n\nThe best way to examine a rock is by smashing it of course! Whether this is by using Magma’s special rock pick, a trusty hammer, or even a larger rock, by breaking open pebbles we can see the treasure inside more easily. This is because as rocks are weathered their outsides become muted and strained, causing their identification to become more difficult. It is always advised that if you are going to break rocks that you use caution and safety. Safety glasses, gloves, and closed toed shoes are great ways to protect yourself from flying debris. Another easy way is to place the targeted rock in a bag or sock as this will limit the spread of any pieces. Magma usually has anyone watching stand at least four meters back so that the chance of being hit by flying debris is minimal.\n\nMagma smashing a rock with his safety glasses and special rock hammer!\n\nMagmatic Minerals\n\nIgneous rocks are not only usually the first one listed in the Rock Cycle, they are also one of Magma’s favorite rocks! Maybe that is because they form from magma! These rocks form when molten hot material cools and solidifies. This can occur both inside the earth in magmatic chambers (intrusive), or from more exciting volcanic eruptions (extrusive). When trying to determine if a rock you found is igneous the most notable feature are their crystals. They are usually black, gray, and white, though in many cases you can find vibrant pinks. Intrusive rocks, like granite, have almost a mosaic or “salt and pepper” look with varying crystals of light and dark color. These crystals cooled more slowly in the earth and thus have had more time to grow. Extrusive rocks, like basalt, cooled more quickly, and as a result have smaller crystal grains that form specks of minerals.\n\nExtrusive (left) and Intrusive (right) Igneous rocks\n\nStunning Sediments\n\nSedimentary rocks are formed by the weathering and erosional processes that we discussed above! This can happen by wind, water, or even glacier activity. There are two main types of sedimentary rocks that have completely different formation events. Clastic rocks are created when weathering events cause the newly formed rocks to be buried, compressed, and eventually solidified within the earth. These types of rocks often look like the grains of material that they formed from. Mudstone looks like layers of mud, sandstone looks like layers of sand, and conglomerates, which are larger rocks within a mud matrix (think chocolate chip cookie design), look like glacial till. Chemical rocks on the other hand form from the dissolving of certain elements in the water, the increased concentration of those elements, and the eventual precipitation of them to form new minerals. These can be seen in rocks like limestone that form from dissolved calcite (both from rocks or from dissolved seashells) or from rock salt which is formed from natural salt minerals like halite. If you happen to have a bit of vinegar on you, scratch a rock and put a couple drops on it. If the rock fizzes, then its limestone!\n\nA few different examples of Sedimentary rocks (from left to right): Sandstone, Mudstone, Conglomerate, and Chemical.\n\nMighty Metamorphosis\n\nThe last type of rock is the metamorphic rock. These rocks form when igneous and sedimentary rocks are changed, or metamorphosed, by pressure, temperature, fluids, and strain while underground. These rocks may be the hardest to find, though they usually have the coolest designs. The best ways to determine if a rock is metamorphic is usually by looking for the sparkle, the patterns, and the colors. Metamorphic rocks are filled with minerals known as micas. These thin minerals create brilliant glitter like designs, and in fact micas were originally used to make glitter. Other times this can be from when sandstone and limestone are changed, creating quartzite and marble, which both look like thousands of white sparkling crystals. As metamorphic rocks are usually bent, folded, and filled with strain, the rock patterns often share that. You can often see wavy patterns in these rocks which gives both a cool design and a hint to its rock history. Lastly metamorphic rocks can vary in bold colors like blues to greens to pinks, and can also sport brilliant gems like rubies, sapphires, emeralds, garnets, and more! If you find any in the Edmonton rivers, Magma says that he deserves a cut of the profits!\n\nMetamorphic Gneiss (left) and Amphibolite (right)\n\nNot only do rocks share with us important geological events in Alberta’s history, but they also provide good fun when exploring. Breaking them open can reveal amazing patterns and crystal designs. Now get out there and go break some rocks!\n\nAll images captured and provided by Mitchell Galarneau\n\nSpring is here! Spring is a great time to have fun in the woods, but it also creates some new obstacles to be aware of. One of the biggest examples is water! Water is everywhere in springtime. It puddles on the ground, flows through creeks, and falls from the sky! But where does all this water come from? And how can I prepare so I can enjoy my time outside?\n\nWhy so much water?\n\nThe main sources of water in the spring are falling rain and melting snow. Lots of rain falls in the spring season, which gets water everywhere and on everything. Melting snow creates big, deep puddles and pools all over the ground. Eventually almost all of this water drains down into creeks, rivers, ponds, and other bodies of water that have started flowing again. This causes water to flow very fast and very high, which can flood onto the ground even more.\n\nWhy does this happen?\n\nThe rain, melting, puddling, and thawing that creates so much water in the spring is caused by a big, worldwide chain reaction. As Rotates around the sun, the seasons around the world change to. In the winter, Canada is facing away form the sun more than its facing towards it and nights are longer. As spring arrives, Canada slowly begins to face the sun for more and more time. Because of this, we start to get longer days and shorter night. Longer days means that we have more time where the sun is out and shining. And as we get more sunshine, temperatures get warmer and warmer. Snow and ice melts off the ground, clouds begin to drop rain instead of snow, and rivers begin to flow again!\n\nHow can I prepare?\n\nNow what can you do to prepare for the wet conditions you are bound to encounter?\n\nThe most important thing is to have rubber boots, or another kind of waterproof footwear. You will encounter puddles in your path more than anything, and waterproof footwear will keep your feet dry and happy.\n\nNext, waterproof layers are super useful. This could be a raincoat, splash pants, or a full body rain suit! Always pull the leg of your pants over the top of your boot, as this will help ensure your feet stay dry. Always also bring extra clothes! Wet clothes can be uncomfortable and a real bummer, so you should always make sure to have extra clothes just in case you need to change! This should include socks, shirts, pants, underwear, and hats on cooler days.\n\nFinally, it can be super handy to waterproof your bag! Some backpacks come with a rain cover, but if you don’t have one you can cover your pack using an empty garbage bag to keep the water off. Waterproofing your entire backpack might only be needed if its rainy, but it’s always a good idea to waterproof the contents inside! Store anything that could get wet, like extra clothes, books, or snack items, inside of their own smaller plastic bags or waterproof containers before adding them to your pack. This will keep everything dry and ready to go even if your backpack itself gets wet.\n\nAnd there you have it! If you follow this, you should be fully prepared for any water obstacles you might encounter! Go out, splash in puddles, and enjoy the beautiful spring weather! Goof luck!!\n\nHave you ever been woken in the morning by a loud, nasally squawking from outside your window? That would be a Magpie! These medium sized black and white avians are one of the most common birds in the Edmonton area. At almost any given time, you can either see or see one around! But how exactly can we recognize a magpie? What are so many looking for in Edmonton, that the city has been dubbed the “magpie capital of Canada”? And how do these surprisingly smart birds interact with people? Read on in this new Urban Animals blog, Magpie Madness, to lean why!\n\nA common magpie (magpie 1)\n\nWhat is a Magpie?\n\nMost people in and around Edmonton have seen or heard a magpie, even if they haven’t known it by name. These birds belong to a family of birds called “Corvidae” or the Crow family. This family of birds also include Crows, Ravens, Blue jays, and Grey jays (also known as Canada jays or Whiskey jacks). Magpies are distinguishable by their black body, long black tail, and large white splotch on their chest. Rare, white and grey leucistic or ‘ghost’ magpies have also been seen around the city A magpie call is also very unique, letting out a loud, repeating queh-queh-queh as they go about their days. Magpies will eat all manner of things including eggs, bugs, grains, small animals, berries, and carrion. When a magpie finds a more food than it can eat at one time, it will often store food away to eat later.\n\nFrom left to right: American crow, Common Raven, Blue jay, Grey jay, Regular magpie (magpie 2), and Leucistic magpie\n\nMagpies in the city\n\nBeing both omnivorous and opportunistic eaters, urban magpies have made a habit of eating things out of the garbage and end up spreading trash around alleys or yards in the process. Magpies can also be very territorial at times, with both each other and other animals. They might perch at the top of a tree to mark their territory to other magpies, and will sometimes group together into flocks to chase off larger birds of prey like owls or hawks. In the spring when nests are built and eggs are laid, magpies may even become aggressive toward pets and people! They will squawk, chase, and dive at anyone or anything that comes too close to their home tree. So how should we deal with magpies? What should we do?\n\nMagpies in the city\n\nMagpies and people\n\nOne thing to remember is that magpies are very intelligent animals! These birds can see through tricks quickly, and can solve basic puzzles give some time. So what should you do? Firstly, never feed the magpies! Magpies will take almost any opportunity for food they see. Secure garbage containers, keep an eye on bird feeder, and absolutely never feed a magpie directly! Now, what if a magpie is building a nest in your yard or near your home? If magpies seem interested in the area, there are a few easy things you can try to scare them off before they lay their eggs. You can try a scarecrow or a decoy predator like a hawk or owl. This can be effective to keep magpies away, but make sure to move the decoy often or else the birds will see through the trick. You can also spray near them with a water gun or hose. If you do this enough times, they’ll most likely stay away for good! If your really dedicated, you can physically move the magpie nest off of your property before the birds come back or lay eggs. If none of these work and the birds successfully lay their eggs, the best thing to do is to leave them be. Don’t let pets out unattended, and keep kids or pets away from the nesting area. Inform your neighbors or others of the presence and location of the nest. Once the young are fully grown and all birds have left the nest, you can remove it to ensure birds don’t return to it next nesting season.\n\nA magpie with its nest\n\nMagpies are a staple of Edmonton and the Edmonton area. Edmonton is often called the “magpie capital of Canada”, and has the highest urban magpie population in all of North America. Even though we sometimes see them as annoying and pest animals, magpies are still important in many ways. They are important to the ecosystems of our forests, and are a captivating sight to those who have never seen them before. It is important that we find a way to coexist with these clever corvids in the places that we both call home.\n\nA magpie on a rock (magpie 3)\n\nGlossary\n\nAvian – a word describing anything related to birds\n\nCorvidae – the Crow family of birds.

Temperatures are getting a little warmer, creeks are thawing, and falling snow is being replaced by rain. But what does all of this mean? Spring is about to arrive! Springtime is a season of growth, change, and new beginnings for nature. Everything from plants, to bugs, to birds, to frogs will be coming back to the outdoors after the long, chilly winter. But how exactly will these things be changing? Why are they changing now, and not earlier or later? In this brand-new blog, read on to learn about how the wilderness adapts to the coming of spring!\n\nBrave Birds\n\nBefore the winter came, we could see all kinds of birds wherever we looked! And now those birds will be coming back. Birds that leave for the winter and return in the spring are called migrators. These birds usually can’t survive in the cold hard winter weather, so they instead choose to fly south to different, warmer places to call home, and the distance some go is truly amazing!\n\nCanada Geese are some of the first birds to return to Canada, and there are lots of them! These birds spend the winter in the southern U.S, then come back north to lay eggs and raise babies.\n\nA Flock of Geese\n\nMallard ducks are one of the most recognizable duck species, with the male’s green heads and bright yellow bills. Most mallard ducks join geese in the southern U.S, but some actually stay and brave the cold in any open water they can find!\n\nMallard Ducks\n\nYellow warblers make their nests and raise their chicks in the spring in Canada, and in the winter these tiny birds migrate all the way south to Central and South America, sometimes flying up to 200 miles in a day!\n\nA Yellow Warbler\n\nWhooping cranes are an endangered bird that spend their winters in Texas, and then fly to northern Alberta to raise their young in the spring and summer. The Whooping crane population is around 600 birds today, compared to a population of 21 birds in the 1940s.\n\nA Whooping Crane\n\nBugs are Back\n\nIn the winter you may find an odd spider in your house, but besides that bugs are nowhere to be seen. But as spring comes back, so do the bugs! Most bugs survive the winter by hibernating or just finding somewhere out of the cold. But as soon as the weather gets warm, we see bugs everywhere again!\n\nBees survive the winter by sticking together. When the weather gets cold, bees will retreat into their hives and clump together to keep warm, with the queen at the very middle. As winter ends, the queen bee starts laying eggs again and the bees prepare to go find flowers!\n\nA Honeybee\n\nMost butterflies sleep the winter away. The cool thing about butterfly hibernation is that it happens at different life stages for different species. Some hibernate as eggs, some as burrowing caterpillars, and some even as adults!\n\nA Tiger Swallowtail Butterfly\n\nWorms hibernate! Once the weather gets cold, earthworms dig their way underground into their burrows, and are stuck down there as the ground freezes above them. Once the ground thaws again, the worms wake up and start digging again!\n\nAn Earthworm\n\nPrime time for Plants\n\nBefore snow fell from the sky, leaves fell from the plants and the trees. Although they looked dead, these plants are actually in a state called “dormancy”. For woody plants like bushes and deciduous trees, they choose to store as much energy as they can to survive the winter. These plants drop all their leaves, stop growing, and store water deep inside their branches and trunks. Once spring arrive, these plants are able to start collecting more energy and growing all their leaves back.\n\nA Woody Shrub\n\nFlower, grasses, and other more fragile ground plants do many different things to survive until springtime. Some of these plants turn brown and look dead once winter comes, but they are actually just dormant. They are conserving energy and water to keep their roots alive, and once the temperature warms back up, they will turn green again! Others truly do die from the cold, but not before leaving something behind. Things like wildflowers will drop seeds into the soil before dying, and these seeds will then rest and wait out the chilly weather. Once there is enough sunlight, warmth, and water in the soil, these seeds will sprout up and begin to grow!\n\nWildflowers\n\nSpringtime is a season of both new beginning and amazing returns! Birds fly from far away to raise a new generation. Bugs emerge from their long winter naps and start preparing for the next one. Plants sprout from the ground and grow back their leaves. The world warms back up and comes alive again. Spring is the end of the last cycle of nature, and the beginning of an all new one!\n\nResources\n\nWhat happens to plants in the winter? https://www.plantlife.org.uk/uk/blog/what-happens-to-plants-in-the-winter\n\nWhat happens to grass in the winter? https://thegrasspeople.com/happens-grass-winter/\n\nHow do trees survive the winter? https://letstalkscience.ca/educational-resources/stem-in-context/how-do-trees-survive-in-winter\n\nEarthworms in winter. https://journeynorth.org/tm/worm/AnnualWinter.html#:~:text=During%20winter%20most%20worms%20stay,the%20worms%20from%20drying%20out\n\nWhere do butterflies go in winter? https://naturemuseum.org/2013/02/where-do-butterflies-go-in-the-winter/\n\nWinter bees: how honeybees survive the winter. https://www.geesbees.ca/post/winter-bees-how-honeybees-survive-the-winter\n\nWhooping Crane https://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/what-we-do/resource-centre/featured-species/birds/whooping-crane.html#:~:text=This%20bird%20species%20has%20made,the%20wild%20and%20in%20captivity.\n\nYellow Warbler range map. https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Yellow_Warbler/maps-range\n\nMallard. https://www.hww.ca/en/wildlife/birds/mallard.html#:~:text=Even%20in%20Alaska%2C%20some%20birds,ice%2Dfree%20throughout%20the%20year.

You might call it a Bunny, Rabbit, or a Hare! All these names actually refer to the same animal, and no matter what you call them they are a common sight in the Edmonton area. These creature stay here all year round and make their homes in neighborhoods and parks all throughout the city. When winter comes, they go through an interesting adaptation to survive by changing the color of their fur to disappear into the snowy background! Join us in this new blog to learn all about what rabbits are, why they change color, and how we interact with them in our urban spaces.\n\nWhat is a Rabbit?\n\nAlthough they look very similar to rodents like mice, rats, and squirrels, rabbits are in their own family called lagomorphs! We have two different species that we commonly see in the Edmonton area; the White-tailed Jackrabbit and the Snowshoe Hare!\n\nMagic Color Changing!\n\nBoth of our local rabbit species change color from autumn to winter, and winter to spring. Their fur in the summer is normally shades of brown or grey to blend into bushes and underbrush, while their winter coats will be almost entirely white to allow them to easily hide in the snow. So, if they both change color how can we tell them apart? The best way to find out is to take a closer look with your detective eyes and look at their SIZE and EARS! White-tailed Jackrabbits are larger in size and have longer black-tipped ears, while snowshoe hares have shorter solid colored ears and are a bit smaller.\n\nLiving in Urban Spaces\n\nLagomorphs can be found living equally in both the river valleys and the urban areas of\n\nEdmonton. These furry animals come into the city for almost any reason, or sometimes for no reason at all! They might be looking for a place to call home away from the territory of other rabbits, others may be looking for a place with more rabbits around or looking for more food than they can find in the forest, or even just trying not to become food for coyotes or owls!\n\nInteraction with humans\n\nRabbits are incredibly adaptable to different environments and are great at surviving by finding different places they call home! Hares will sleep and rest anywhere whether its right out in the open, under steps, or in yards and fields. They might even squeeze beneath a fence to nibble on your garden! Though hares don’t dig burrows underground, they do often scratch shallow bowls into the ground. These Hare habits can create conflicts with human that don’t necessarily want them in their backyard! But their presence is not all bad as these animals will often eat invasive plants or unhelpful wild plants that would otherwise create problems. These animals are an important part of the natural ecosystem and just like humans, have a purpose in the natural world. One way to keep these hungry herbivores away from your home is to secure any outdoor gardens. This can be done by setting up mesh or fencing around your plants so they can’t reach them. If you think a rabbit has made a home under\n\nyour deck or stairs, wait for the animal to leave, and then place mesh or wire over the entrance. All of these are easy, non-lethal ways to avoid issues with lagomorphs. Another common interaction between people and lagomorphs comes in the spring time when new baby bunnies are born. These babies will be left hidden in bushes or shrubs by their mothers to avoid drawing unwanted attention. Many people believe that these babies have been abandoned, but this is almost never the case. If you find a baby hare, do not touch it, or pick it up unless it is very obviously injured. These animals are amazing at hiding from natural predators and will be terrified if picked up and moved. If you did move an uninjured baby hare, return it to exactly where you found it as soon as possible so its mother can find it again. Moving and not returning a baby hare can be very dangerous, as without the support of their mother they will not survive. If you do find an injured or sick baby hare, contact an animal rehabilitation center, and inform them of the situation.\n\nThese cute furry animals will always be present in Edmonton. Although some people see them as nuisances or pests, they serve an important role in the ecosystems that we have moved into. The fun, furry critters call home the same places that we do, and it is up to us to create ways to share and enjoy the city alongside them.\n\nGlossary\n\nAdaptations – changes to an animal’s body or behavior to survive better in certain conditions\n\nRodents – small mammals including mice, rats, and squirrels\n\nLagomorphs – mammals including hares, rabbits, and bunnies Camouflage – the ability to blend into an environment using body colour\n\nPredators – animals that hunt and eat other animals\n\nTerritory – the space around an animals home that they protect from others of their species\n\nEnvironments – the combination of living things, nonliving things, and climate in an area\n\nBurrow – underground holes or chambers that an animal digs to live in\n\nHerbivores – animals that only eat plant material\n\nInvasive plants – plants that came from somewhere else and out compete native plants\n\nEcosystem – the interactions between living and nonliving parts of an environment\n\nSources\n\nHinterlands Whos Who: Snowshoe hares. https://www.hww.ca/en/wildlife/mammals/snowshoe-hare.html\n\nWikipedia: white-tailed jackrabbit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-tailed_jackrabbit\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict: rabbits and hares. https://www.alberta.ca/rabbits-and-hares.aspx#:~:text=In%20Alberta%2C%20there%20are%20mountain,summer%20and%20white%20in%20winter.\n\nAZ animals: hare facts. https://a-z-animals.com/animals/hare/\n\nEdmonton journal: Baby hares. https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/baby-hares-may-be-cute-but-dont-touch-wildlife-rehabilitation-society-of-edmonton\n\nAlberta animal health source: baby hares. https://www.albertaanimalhealthsource.ca/content/wild-baby-hares-and-proper-handling\n\nEdmonton journal: bunny boom. https://globalnews.ca/news/3086646/bunny-boom-edmonton-sees-influx-of-urban-adaptor-white-tailed-jackrabbits/\n\nCoyotes are a common sight in prairies, forests, mountains, and, surprisingly, urban spaces like here in Edmonton! Although these crafty canines normally spend their time in the many urban nature pockets of our city, recent years have seen more and more Coyotes journeying into neighborhoods and other places we wouldn’t typically see them. Many people see these creatures as pests or nuisances, but others want to find ways that we can both live in our city without causing issues for one another. Join us in our blog to learn how Coyotes survive in the same cities we call home, how people and coyotes interact, and what we can do to keep both ourselves and these important animals safe.\n\nFirst, we should know some background information on coyotes. Coyotes are a member of the Canidae family which also includes wolves, foxes, and our pet dogs. Coyotes are smaller than wolves but larger than foxes, and often sport coats with various shades of brown along with white, black, or grey. Contrary to popular belief, Coyotes eat an omnivorous diet. They are both predators and scavengers, and will eat rodents, lagomorphs, deer, other small animals, and carrion, along with the occasional plant or fallen fruit. Coyotes are semi-social animals that can be seen spending time both in packs or alone, depending on the time of year and age of the animal. Coyotes are at their most active in the winter months, when they need to travel more to find food and suitable areas to live. Most importantly, Coyotes are a creature that can adapt and survive almost anywhere it chooses, and this has allowed them as a species to spread to all corners of the continent!\n\nYou may be wondering, why do I see Coyotes in my neighborhood? Aren’t there rabbits and other food sources in the forest? When the winter season arrives, many of the Coyotes natural food sources become much harder to find. Rabbits will change color and camouflage into the snow, and most other small animals retreat under the ground to hibernate. Neighborhoods and other Urban areas offer some relief from this scarcity in a few different forms. Coyotes will dig through easily reachable trash bags, or hunt and eat loose pets. As Coyotes spend more time in urban spaces, this also creates the opportunity for more encounters and issue with people.\n\nAs winter is when Coyotes are most active, this is also when we are most likely to have a run in with one. If you do have a Coyote encounter, it is important to know what to do to keep you, your loved one, your pets, and the Coyote safe. The first thing to remember is to never run away from a Coyote! If you run, a Coyote is more likely to chase you in a natural predator/ prey response. Instead, make yourself large and aggressive. Stand up tall, yell and make loud sounds, and throw things near the Coyote without hitting it. This should be enough to scare a Coyote away. If the Coyote doesn’t leave after all of this, pick up any small children or small pets and slowly leave the area. This could mean that there is food or a den close by, and it’s best to leave the area. There are many ways to deter Coyotes from higher risk areas even without having an encounter. Make sure there are no Coyote attractants around your home. This can include loose or easily accessible trash, pet food, bird seed, or fallen fruit. Pets can also act as a Coyote attractant. Never leave cats outside, as this will make them an easy target for Coyotes in the area. Keep your dog on a leash anywhere that isn’t an off-leash area, and always put your dog back on a leash if you see a Coyote around. Finally, never intentionally feed Coyotes! Most recorded Coyote attacks are because people have been feeding them, and the Coyote has become too bold around people. This is dangerous not only to other people, but to the Coyote too.\n\nCoyotes are a staple of Edmonton’s River valleys and urban natural areas, and as our city grows so will our interactions with urban Coyotes. If we wish to coexist with these interesting, unique animals, it is important to respect them rather than dislike them. We need to know how to not only keep ourselves and our loved ones safe, but also how to keep our cities Coyotes safe as they share the same places that we call home.\n\nGlossary\n\nCanidae – the family of mammals containing wolves, foxes, coyotes, domestic dogs, and many other similar animals\n\nOmnivorous – an animal that eats both plant material and meat\n\nRodents – mammals including rats, mice, voles, and squirrels\n\nLagomorphs – mammals including hares and rabbits\n\nCarrion – The meat of a dead animal\n\nScavengers – carnivores that mainly eat the meat of dead animals killed by something else\n\nAttractant – something that draws an animal to a certain area\n\nSources\n\nWhen are coyotes most active? https://www.westchesterwildlife.com/blog/when-are-coyotes-most-active-and-aggressive/\n\nEdmonton Coyote Hazing. https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/edmonton-urban-coyote-hazing-1.6263581\n\nCoyotes: City of Edmonton. https://www.edmonton.ca/residential_neighbourhoods/pets_wildlife/Coyotes\n\nGuide to Coexisting with coyotes. https://www.edmonton.ca/public-files/assets/document?path=PDF/COE_Urban_Coyotes_Brochure_Final_WEB.pdf\n\nEdmonton Urban Coyote Project. https://edmontonurbancoyotes.ca/\n\nEdmonton Area Land Trust – Coyotes: https://www.ealt.ca/species-spotlight-list/coyote\n\nNeighborhood coyotes: https://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/they-re-taking-naps-in-the-trees-coyotes-getting-cozy-in-lansdowne-neighbourhood-1.5429821\n\nEvery year, you can recognize the approach of winter by the trees losing their leaves. The bushy green canopy slowly changes colour and falls to the forest floor below. Although we see these changes to many of our trees, we also see many stalwart trees who almost never change from their vibrant green colour. These spiky, cone shaped giants are known as Conifers! Conifers, or coniferous trees, grow all across Alberta anywhere you go, and stay green all year round! You may be thinking, how are these trees different? Why don’t they lose their needles in the winter? How are those needles like the leaves I see on every other tree? Join us in this blog to learn how coniferous trees stand triumphant through it all!\n\nFirst off, what exactly is a coniferous tree? Coniferous trees are characterized by their needles, their pinecones, and the fact that they all stay green through every season (at least, almost all of them!). This is in comparison to the leafy green trees that drop their leaves every winter, which are called deciduous trees. When comparing coniferous to deciduous trees, the first things you might notice are the general shape and the leafy structures that grow on them. Deciduous trees are normally tall and straight, with leaves clumped mainly at the very top. Coniferous trees, on the other hand, almost always take a cone shape and have their needles growing on branches from the base all the way to the very top. But wait, are those needles the same as leaves? Indeed they are! Instead of the soft, fleshy leaves that we see on deciduous trees, conifers grow small, flat, sharp needles. despite this, everything about these needle is the exact same as a regular leaf, just squished down to a smaller size. These needles provide may benefits to the tree, and one of the most important benefits is their ability to stay green through the winter.\n\nThe needles on conifers have many functions that help the tree survive. Firstly, the shape of the needle is very important. The small, round, long shape provides protection to the center of the needle, where energy from sun becomes food for the tree. The thin size of these needles also causes snow will slide right off instead of sitting on top and blocking the sunlight. Deeper into the needles, we see even more going on to keep the trees alive. Most coniferous trees exhibit an ability called extracellular freezing, in which the cells of the tree push water from the inside to the outside. This water freezes forming a protective coating of ice around the sensitive middle of the cell. Conifer needles are also coated in a thick waxy outer layer which keeps water from escaping. This ensures that the needles keep the perfect level of water inside them to survive any conditions. Finally, the cone shape of the entire tree helps with winter survival by allowing snow to slide right off instead of sitting on top and weighing the branches down.\n\nPine Trees\n\nAlthough “pine tree” can be used to describe the entire group of conifer trees, pines are their very own type of conifer. Pine trees are characterized by longer needles growing in clusters of anywhere from 2 to 5 and stout, round pinecones. These pinecones, once mature, will usually look thick and woody and have a very rough feel to them. The 5 species of pine trees in Alberta are the shrubby Jack pine, the giant Lodgepole pine, the rare Western White pine, and two endangered species, the Limber pine and White-bark pine.\n\nSpruce Trees\n\nSpruce trees are likely the most numerous coniferous tree you will find. Spruce trees are usually very tall and thick, with very short needles and thin, papery pinecones. The needles on a spruce tree feel square shaped, which can be noticed by rolling the needle between your fingers. Alberta has 3 species of spruce trees which are the very common White spruce, the mountain growing Engelmann spruce, and the wetland loving Black spruce.\n\nLarch Trees\n\nLarch trees are very unique compared to all other conifers. When fall comes the slender, soft needles of larch trees turn yellow and fall off, just like a deciduous tree! This adaptation allows larch trees to store extra nutrients and collect even less snow on their branches. This adaptation lets the trees grow and survive in even harsher, colder climates than other conifers. Larch trees have 3 different species in Alberta. The common Tamarack, the high mountain Alpine larch, and the massive Western larch.\n\nFir Trees\n\nThe easiest way to identify a fir is through the needles. Fir needles are much flatter than those of their pine or spruce cousins, which is especially noticeable when felt. Fir trees also often have smoother feeling bark than other conifer trees. Alberta is home to common Balsam fir and the slightly taller Alpine fir.\n\nJuniper Trees or Bushes\n\nJunipers grow as both small trees and bushy shrubs, which makes them very easy to tell apart from other conifers. The needles on junipers have a scaly feeling, and the cones produce lots of fine, yellow powdery dust. Another unique difference between junipers and other conifers is that junipers grow small edible blue berries during the summer! The species of juniper in Alberta are the bushy Ground juniper, the carpet-like Creeping juniper, and the more tree-like Rocky Mountain juniper.\n\nReferences\n\nTree Adaptations, http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/2010/panich_just/Site/Adaptations.html\n\nLarch Trees in Canada by Sheryl Normandeau, https://treecanada.ca/blog/larch-trees-in-canada/\n\nWhitebark and Limber pine recover, https://www.alberta.ca/whitebark-and-limber-pine-recovery.aspx\n\nFlora of Alberta Second Edition by E.H.

Some are migrating far away, some are eating and growing thicker fur, some are changing their colour, and some are getting ready to hibernate! Hibernation is when an animal goes into a deep state of inactivity for a long period of time to conserve energy. They don’t move, drink, or eat, they just sleep! Everyone knows bears hibernate, but did you know there are many other animals around us that sleep the winter away? Not only that, but there are many different types of hibernation. In this post we will talk about four hidden hibernators that you might not know about!\n\nGround Squirrels\n\nGround Squirrels, also called gophers, are a very common type of rodent in Alberta. There are 5 species of Ground Squirrels in Alberta, and each of them has unique colours and habits. Although they look different, all Ground Squirrels share one important trait in common. They all hibernate! Ground Squirrels will hibernate for 4-9 months out of the year, through most of the fall and winter. These little guys each hibernate in their own isolated burrow called a hibernaculum, and stay curled into a small ball to keep warm. During their hibernation, Ground squirrels will often go into a state called torpor, where all their bodily functions will get extremely slow to the point that they will not wake up to anything, even someone or something picking them up! To keep safe, they will close off any entrance into their burrow, and will have to dig a new tunnel out when they want to leave. Male Ground squirrels will begin to come out of their hibernaculum once the temperature is above freezing, while females will usually emerge 2 weeks after the males.\n\nHibernating Thirteen-Lined Ground Squirrel\n\nActive Thirteen-Lined Ground Squirrel\n\nWood Frog\n\nWhat do Wood Frogs do in the winter? They hibernate! But do you know how? The answer is even more surprising. While many other frogs spend the winter at the bottom of ponds or rivers, Wood Frogs do something much more extreme. When winter comes, these frogs will burrow under the leaves, dirt, and snow, and they will freeze solid! Wood frogs will freeze for up to 8 months to survive in even the coldest conditions, but this has other advantages too. Because they stay on land, they are able to thaw out earlier in the year and lay eggs before other types of frogs emerge from hibernation. You must be wondering, how do they stay alive? When winter comes and everything starts to freeze, the frogs body freezes too. It lets its body get covered in ice, inside and out! At the same time, it begins to produce a sugary substance called glucose and pumps it through its bloodstream. The glucose in its blood stops the water and oxygen from freezing, and therefore keeps everything flowing in its body even when the heart and brain have frozen solid! At the end of the winter, the frog is able to thaw its body and begin its year as if nothing even happened.\n\nA Frozen Wood Frog\n\nAn Active Wood Frog\n\nLittle Brown Bat\n\nLittle brown bats are very common in Alberta. These bats spend their springs and summers eating bugs and getting ready for the winter. Between August and October, bats from many different places will gather together in huge swarms at caves and abandoned mines to breed. Some of these bats will travel up to 1000 kilometers to join in these swarms, and will then stay the winter in these places. The caves or mines where these bats gather are called hibernacula, and provide the large groups of bats with a winter home that stays humid and above freezing temperatures all season. Little Brown Bats, like Ground Squirrels, will enter a state or torpor during their hibernation where they do not eat, but will sometimes wake up to drink water or go to the bathroom. Bats usually hibernate from September to May before heading back to their summer homes. A large problem facing hibernating bats is a disease called White Nose Syndrome. This disease causes the bat to wake up more often during hibernation, and as a result it spends more energy that it has saved up. Most bats with White Nose Syndrome do not survive, and it has had a very big effect on Little Brown Bat population. Although it is hard to control the spread of WNS, some Little Brown Bats have been seen to have an immunity to the disease. If these bats have offspring that are also immune, it will carry hope for the species into the future.\n\nLittle Brown Bats hibernating\n\nActive Little Brown Bat\n\nGarter Snakes\n\nGarter Snakes are a very common snake to see around during the summer. You may see them basking in the sun or zooming through a field while on a hike. These snakes are not venomous, but it is still best to keep your distance if you spot one. There are 3 different species of Garter Snakes in Alberta, but they are all not too big and look and act very similar. Garter snakes usually hibernate from October until March or April, but may come out on warmer winter days to soak in the sun. Hibernation in reptiles is called brumation! Garter Snakes come together in large groups in underground hiding places to keep extra warm during the winter months, and may travel a long way to reach a good spot that they recognize. Typically, they will find spots such as old rodent burrows, in old stumps, under rocks, or other small, hard to reach spots. Although they don’t eat anything while in brumation, Garter Snakes will still stay hydrated by absorbing moisture through their skin from the environment around them.\n\nHibernating Garter Snakes\n\nActive Garter Snake\n\nInteresting Words\n\nHibernation: When an animal spends a long period of time doing very little or no activity to save energy\n\nHibernaculum (Plural: Hibernacula): The home that an animal, or animals, use to hibernate in.\n\nTorpor: A state where all of a hibernating animals body functions get extremely slow to conserve energy\n\nBurrow: An underground area dug by Ground Squirrels or other animals to be used as a temporary or permanent home.\n\nGlucose: A sugary substance produced by Wood Frogs to keep its blood flowing when its body freezes\n\nWhite Nose Syndrome: A disease that affects Little Brown Bats during their hibernation period\n\nBrumation: The hibernation of Garter Snakes and other cold-blooded animals, who get heat from the environment around them\n\nSources\n\nGail R.

Whether it’s forests, skyscrapers, or your own backyard, you are bound to see and hear many different birds during the wintertime. But although common to see, it can be challenging to know what kind of bird you are looking. But practice makes perfect. A Great way to see more birds, and help birds through the cold, is to set up a birdfeeder in your yard. Birdfeeders can be bought at the store or made using items you have around the house\n\nBlack Capped Chickadee\n\nBlack capped chickadees are one of the most common birds you are bound to see in neighborhoods and snowy forests. These small white, grey, and black birds are loud for their size and are usually heard before they are seen, with their distinctive call that mimics their name. Chickadees enjoy eating small bugs and seeds, and will often be a regular visitor to any backyard birdfeeder.\n\nBlue Jay\n\nBlue jays are distinctive in both their call and their appearance, and can be known as soon as they are seen are heard. Their main call is a loud, screaming jay-jay-jay that usually repeats a few times. These birds have bright blue backs and white bellies, with a pointy blue crest on the top of their heads. Blue jays will eat almost anything they can find, and will be a very common sight at bird feeders in neighborhoods with lots of trees and places to perch.\n\nHouse Sparrow\n\nHouse sparrows area common sight anywhere you go in the city. These little birds will often spend time in large gatherings at any feeders of food sources, and can be seen all year round. The call of a house sparrow is a very plain, regular cheep-cheep-cheep-cheep that is very recognizable. These birds can sometimes be difficult to identify, as females are much plainer in colour and can easily be misidentified as other birds. Although named as a sparrow, House sparrows are actually not related to ant other any sparrow species in Alberta!\n\nMale House Sparrow\n\nFemale House Sparrow\n\nNuthatch\n\nNuthatches are common to backyard birdfeeders, but are very fast and will only stay still long enough to grab some seeds and go. These little birds, when not darting through the air, can be spotted hopping up and down tree trunks right-side up or upside down! Nuthatches can be confused with chickadees as both have gray backs with white and black heads, but Nuthatches will have longer, thinner beaks and more reddish colour on their underbelly. There are 2 different species of Nuthatches that are common to see, the smaller Red-breasted Nuthatch and the larger White-breasted Nuthatch.\n\nRed Breasted Nuthatch\n\nWhite Breasted Nuthatch\n\nBlack Billed Magpie\n\nMagpies might just be the most common bird to see in the Edmonton area. These medium sized black and white birds will be everywhere from forests to downtown streets, and will eat whatever they can find. Magpies are often bigger than many other birds you may see at your birdfeeder, and will use this advantage to chase off other birds when they want to eat. Magpies will also happily eat seeds that have fallen on the ground, while most other birds will try to stay up high on the feeder. These birds have a very recognizable call, and can be heard at all hours of the day anywhere you go.\n\nMaking Your Own Birdfeeders!\n\nPinecone Birdfeeder: For this you will need a pinecone, some peanut butter or no-nut peanut butter, some birdseed, and a piece of string. Securely tie your string around the top of the pinecone. Cover the pinecone in your choice of nut butter either by dipping it or by using a utensil to spread it on. Roll your pinecone in some birdseed until it is covered. Finally, find a good spot to hang your pinecone birdfeeder and watch the birds come to enjoy!\n\nOrange Peel Birdfeeder: For this you will need an orange, some string, and bird seed. Cut your orange in half. Eat the orange, but save your cup-shaped peel halves. With the help of an adult, poke 2 holes in the orange peel in a way that you can tie a string to hang it. Next, fill the orange peel cup with birdseed. Finally, find a spot to hang your feeder for the birds to come and eat! You can add extras to your orange peel cup, like nut butter to help the seed stick and give more for the birds to eat.\n\nMilk Jug Birdfeeder: Make sure to get the help of a parent for this craft. You will need an empty, clean 4-liter milk jug, some sting, and some birdseed. Using scissors or a knife, cut a large hole in one of the flat faces of the milk jug. Next, poke a hole in the cap and tie a piece of sting through. Fill the bottom of the milk jug with birdseed, nut butter, and whatever else you would like. Finally, find a spot to hang the feeder where you can easily see its visitors without scaring them off.\n\nToilet Paper Tube Birdfeeder: For this birdfeeder you will need an empty toilet paper tube, bird seeds, and some peanut or non nut butter. Start by using a spoon or knife to spread your nut butter on the bottom half of the toilet paper tube. Once you feel like you have enough on, take your tube a role it in your birdseed. Your birdfeeder is then ready to use! You can simply place the tube on a branch for the birds to access it, or you can tie some string through the half without seeds and hang it from there.\n\nReferences\n\nBirds of Alberta by Chris Fisher and John Acorn, Published 1998\n\nBlue jay, House Sparrow, Chickadee, and White Breasted Nuthatch photos taken from https://www.allaboutbirds.org/\n\nMagpie and Red Breasted Nuthatch photos taken from https://ebird.org/"
