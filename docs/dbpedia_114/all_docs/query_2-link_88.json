        "text": "Aster Town Plaza\n\nWithin the Central Park Denver development, Forest City constructed a grouping of residential buildings: Aster Town Center, Town Center North and Conservatory Green. The team created a repeatable product line of blueprints in order to execute the project—still delivering the terrific housing, amenities and more that Forest City is known for, but in a more cost-effective and time-efficient manner.\n\nThe three-story building plan repeated across the project allowed for high density in a low-rise profile, supporting the rapid development of the local community. Within the duplicated buildings, a collection of residential options at a range of prices are provided, thus ensuring housing availability for a broader, more diverse group of residents. The Aster buildings were created with wood frameworks and parking carefully tucked underneath each building. With a density at 35 units per acre, Forest City gave the land incredible value while keeping rent prices moderate.\n\nKeeping in line with the Central Park Denver master plan, the Aster neighborhoods emphasize walkability and close-knit community. Aster Town Center, Town Center North and Conservatory Green are prime examples of Forest City’s dedication to New Urbanism, establishing higher density, community interconnectivity and accessibility at a reasonable cost. The Aster blueprints were also created with a mission in mind: to bring a cost-effective product line to market beyond Denver. Because of their low-rise structure, the buildings could be occupied as they were built, reducing cost and driving income early in the process. The buildings could be tailored in character and finish, thus fitting easily into other master planned and in-fill communities. Although the intended product line remains in the Aster neighborhoods, they endure as an exceptional achievement for Forest City.\n\nLocation\n\nDenver, CO\n\nProgram\n\n+ Aster Conservatory Green: 608 units\n\n+ Aster Town Center: 85 units\n\n+ Aster Town Center North: 135 units\n\nDate opened\n\n+ Aster Conservatory Green: 2014\n\n+ Aster Town Center: 2013\n\n+ Aster Town Center North: 2013"
