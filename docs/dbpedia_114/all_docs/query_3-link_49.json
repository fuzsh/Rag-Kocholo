Check the refund deadlines for classes you are enrolled in. You are responsible for officially dropping a class you are not attending.\n\nIf are you a veteran, international student, health sciences student, work-study student or receiving financial aid, contact those departments for more information; your status may affect refund processing.\n\nIf you are not in one of the groups listed above, and you drop a class during the 100% refund period, the charges will be refunded to you. After the 100% refund period, you will still owe either 50% or all of the fees, and you will get a \"W\" on your transcript. Shorter classes have refund dates based on when those classes begin and how long they last. Check Dates and Deadlines for full term refund dates.\n\nTo determine the refund period for your specific class(es):\n\nLog in to MyTMCC and go to your Student Center.\n\nLook in the \"Finances\" section\n\nClick on the \"Class Refund Dates\" link\n\nHow do I order a duplicate diploma?\n\nComplete and submit the Duplicate Diploma Request.\n\nHow do I verify my enrollment?\n\nTo verify your enrollment follow these instructions.\n\nAccess the National Student Clearinghouse:\n\nLog in to MyTMCC and click on \"Print Enrollment Verification Certificate\" on the left-hand side.

What can I do?\n\nOnce your graduation application has been processed, your degree is posted to your transcript and a communication is sent to your communications center in MyTMCC and to your TMCC email address notifying you that you have met the requirements for your degree.\n\nIf you are a current TMCC student, you are able to view and print out your unofficial transcripts using MyTMCC. Access to request your official transcript is available using MyTMCC.\n\nThe National Student Clearinghouse provides the following services (please note that these services are not free):\n\nYou can order official transcripts.\n\nYou (or your employer) can verify your degree.\n\nIf I'm a UNR student, do I need to apply for admission at TMCC?\n\nYes. Each school in the Nevada System of Higher Education has its own admissions process. To become a TMCC student, complete the online application.\n\nWhat is MyTMCC?\n\nThe MyTMCC student portal is a \"one-stop\" gateway for accessing many TMCC applications and tools. Use it to search, register and pay for your classes.\n\nMyTMCC is part of the Nevada statewide iNtegrate project hosted by System Computing Services (SCS), a unit of the Nevada System for Higher Education, and provides TMCC students, faculty and staff personalized access to information and tools in one secure, centralized location.\n\nThrough the portal, you have 24/7 access to the following:\n\nA checklist of \"to do\" items\n\nAll communications from the College\n\nShopping cart style course registration\n\nAdvanced planning tools\n\nTo access MyTMCC, visit my.tmcc.edu.\n\nSee Also: MyTMCC Tutorial\n\nAdmissions\n\nDo I need a high school diploma or HSE (GED) to attend TMCC?\n\nNo, a high school diploma or HSE (formerly GED) is not required to attend TMCC, unless you are applying for special admission or wish to declare a degree program.\n\nDoes TMCC have an application deadline?\n\nNo, TMCC does not have an admissions application deadline.\n\nWe encourage students to apply as early as possible to ensure they can complete the needed Steps to Enroll and get their preferred classes. In addition, we want you to be successful! Research shows students who apply well in advance of the first class meeting have much better success rates.\n\nHow do I become a student at TMCC?\n\nPlease begin by reviewing TMCC's Steps to Enroll. Once you have been admitted to TMCC, you will receive your student ID number, username, and password.\n\nThen, prior to enrolling in classes, you will be asked to complete New Student Orientation (NSO) online.\n\nIf you have more questions, please feel free to contact the Admissions and Records Office.\n\nNew students are mailed (either by postal mail or email) their MyTMCC login information based on the communication preference they indicate on their application for admission.\n\nAll adults are welcome to apply at TMCC.\n\nIf you are 17-years-old or younger or not a U.S. citizen, additional information is required. Contact the Admissions and Records Office for more information.\n\nThe student admission process typically takes between 3-5 business days. Depending on the preference you selected, you will receive your admissions letter either by email or postal mail.\n\nIf you have not heard from us after 7 business days, please contact the Admissions and Records Office.\n\nWhat is the cost to attend TMCC?\n\nCost to attend full time at TMCC is considerably less than attending a university. See the tuition and fees section for current information.\n\nWhat's the difference between an NSHE ID number and a TMCC Student ID number?\n\nThere is no difference; they are the same.\n\nTMCC students are issued an official 10-digit Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE) Student ID number that is included in your official letter of admission from the TMCC Admissions and Records Office.\n\nThis is sometimes referred to as your TMCC ID or just Student ID.\n\nYour NSHE Student ID number can be used throughout all NSHE institutions. The Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE) oversees all higher education in Nevada, including TMCC.\n\nWhere can I go to prepare for taking the HSE (formerly GED)?\n\nTMCC's High School Equivalency (HSE) program (formerly \"GED\") will help prepare you to take the HSE examination.\n\nWhere do I find information about applying to TMCC as an international student?\n\nPlease visit the International Student Services website for detailed information available to international students.\n\nWho needs to complete the TMCC Steps to Enroll?\n\nAll new, degree-seeking students must complete the Steps to Enroll. TMCC requires this to ensure your success as new college students. Finishing each required enrollment step will help prepare you for your first semester at TMCC and guide you towards graduation.\n\nAdd Drop Classes\n\nHow can I find out if a class is open?\n\nSearch for open classes/class sections either through the online Class Schedule or in MyTMCC > Find Open Classes (on the Add/Drop Classes screen).\n\nHow can I find out the deadlines to drop a class and get a refund?\n\nTo find drop deadlines for classes you are enrolled in:\n\nLog in to MyTMCC and go to your Student Center.\n\nIn the \"Academics\" box you will see a list of classes you are enrolled in.\n\nTo the left of each class there is a calendar icon.\n\nClick on the icon to see drop deadline information.\n\nFor a class that you are enrolled in but has not started yet:\n\nIn MyTMCC: click on the \"My Class Schedule\" link in the Academics box in your Student Center.\n\nThe next page lists your enrollment activity for the term. You can sort to show only your enrolled classes.\n\nOn the far right of each listing you will see \"Deadlines\".\n\nUnderneath that heading will be the calendar icon.\n\nClicking on the icon will give you drop deadlines.\n\nTo find refund deadlines:\n\nLog in to MyTMCC and go to your Student Center.\n\nIn the \"Finances\" box click on the \"Class Refund Dates\" hyperlink.\n\nChoose the appropriate semester and click the green \"Check Refund Date\" box.\n\nRefund deadlines differ depending on what type of class you are taking; that is, a full-term or a short-term section. Students should check the deadlines for their specific short-term classes.\n\nSee Also: key date refund guidelines.\n\nHow do I add or withdraw from a class?\n\nAdding a class\n\nYou may add classes anytime during the published registration period. Late starting classes may be added using MyTMCC up until the published start date of the class. Note: If you add classes or register late, you become immediately responsible for the fees for these classes and should be aware that you may not be eligible for any refunds if you drop from these classes.\n\nWithdrawing from a class\n\nStudents may use MyTMCC to withdraw from classes until the mid-point (60%) of a class.\n\nUnless the class is officially dropped, the student is responsible for the fees and the instructor may assign a failing grade. It is important for students to verify the accuracy of their enrollment schedules and fees any time a change is made.\n\nRefunds for withdrawing from classes are based on the times the class has met and not on the attendance of a particular student.\n\nHow do I enroll in classes at TMCC?\n\nTo enroll in classes at TMCC, follow these instructions.\n\nFirst: submit an application for admission to the College. You will receive an admissions letter with your student ID, username and initial password.\n\nThen: log in to MyTMCC and click on the \"Student Center\". Check your Enrollment Dates (from the area on the right). If the links says \"Open Enrollment Dates\", you are eligible to enroll at any time.\n\nAll registration activity happens in the shopping cart.\n\nUnder the \"Academics\" section, click on the \"Enroll\" link or the \"Enrollment Shopping Cart\" link.\n\nIf you do not know the class number for the class you would like to add, use the search function on the shopping cart screen to search for open sections by subject and course number. From the list generated, select an open class (designated by a green circle). This puts the class into your shopping cart.\n\nTo finish enrolling in the class: select the box next to the class and click \"Enroll\".\n\nConfirm this is the correct class and then click \"Finish Enrolling\".\n\nHow do I find out my final grades?\n\nAccess your grade report through MyTMCC. Grades are available approximately one week after the end of the semester.\n\nIf you need a printed copy of the grades, you can use MyTMCC to print an unofficial copy of your transcript that will show all your classes and grades, including previous terms.\n\nI added a class but now want to drop it to add another class. How do I do this?\n\nPrior to the beginning of any term, log in to MyTMCC, and go to your Student Center. There you can drop one class and add another.\n\nIf it is past the 100% refund period, you must get permission to get into the new class late by completing an Add/Drop Form, available from the academic department. The Add/Drop Form should be completed with signatures from the instructor and the department chair, then submit it to the Admissions and Records Office.\n\nI am having difficulty adding classes. What should I do?\n\nIf you are experiencing difficulty enrolling in classes you should try the following:\n\nCheck your holds. There are a variety of enrollment holds that may affect you as a student. For example, you may have a hold because you need to complete New Student Orientation, meet with an Academic Advisor, pay a past due balance, or update your information with Admissions and Records.\n\nLog in to MyTMCC. Click on your \"Student Center\", to see if you have any holds listed. Contact Admissions and Records for clarification on any holds listed here.\n\nClick on \"Details\" in the Holds section. These \"Details\" will outline steps required to remove the hold and the appropriate department to contact.\n\nCheck your Enrollment Appointment.\n\nLog in to MyTMCC and go to your Student Center.\n\nLook for the \"Enrollment Dates\" box (in the blue column on the right side of the screen). Click on the (blue) link in that box to see the date and time after which you can complete the enrollment process.\n\nCheck your prerequisites.You may not have completed the prerequisites for the class(es) you are trying to enroll in.\n\nPrerequisites are listed in the College Catalog and also in the class schedule search, underneath each class identifier.\n\nLog in to MyTMCC and check your transcript for classes that you have completed.\n\nIf you have any further questions regarding enrollment, contact Admissions and Records.\n\nI've put classes in MyTMCC's shopping cart; now what do I do?\n\nView our step-by-step Registration Tutorial.\n\nOr, follow these steps:\n\nLog in to MyTMCC.\n\nSelect the 'Student Center' link.\n\nSelect your shopping cart.\n\nSelect the classes you wish to enroll in by checking the box next to the class.\n\nClick the 'Enroll' button.\n\nClick the 'Finish Enrolling' button to complete the process.\n\nUse the delete button to remove classes that you are not planning to enroll in.\n\nWhat does it mean to audit a class?\n\nA student who audits a course will not receive a grade nor credit for that course. A student who is auditing pays regular fees and, at the discretion of the instructor, must meet all regular class requirements.\n\nChanging from audit to credit, or from credit to audit, must be done by submitting an Audit or Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Grade Change form before the last day to drop a class.\n\nFor full term classes, these dates can be found in Dates and Deadlines.\n\nFor short term classes, this information can be found by signing into MyTMCC and then looking at your class information in the Academics box. Clicking on the small calendar icon that appears to the left of each class you are taking will bring up the last date to drop or change to audit or satisfactory/unsatisfactory.\n\nWhat happens if I drop a class?\n\nIf you are in a special student group, such as veterans or international students, you cannot drop classes without first clearing the process with the respective department. Also, if you are using financial aid to pay for classes, dropping a class can affect your award, so please check with the Financial Aid Office.\n\nRemember that an option instead of dropping a class is to change to audit. You will still pay for the class but will not receive a grade. If you are challenged by the work in a class, auditing it first and then taking the class for credit might be a good idea. You will need to speak with your instructor and complete an Audit or Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Grade Change form.\n\nIt is important to check the drop dates for the class you’re thinking of dropping. Do this by signing into MyTMCC and then looking at your class information in the Academics box. Clicking on the small calendar icon that appears to the left of each class you are taking will bring up the various drop dates.\n\nThe drop and refund dates vary based on the length of the class. This means that shorter term classes will have different drop periods than full term classes. If you drop a class during the 100% period, you will receive a full refund and the class will not show on your transcript. If you drop during the 50% period, you will receive a 50% refund and a W will appear on your transcript for the class. If you drop after the 50% period and before the final day to drop, you will not receive a refund and a \"W\" will appear on your transcript for the class.\n\nWhat is TMCC’s policy on repeating courses for a higher grade?\n\nA student who has repeated a course may petition to have the higher grade remain on his/her transcript and have the lower grade changed to an \"R\" to indicate the course was retaken.\n\nStudents may replace up to 12 semester credits.\n\nTo petition for grade replacement, please complete and submit a Grade Replacement Request for Repeated Courses form. Students will not receive duplicate credit for repeated courses.\n\nWhat should I do if I want to change a class?\n\nCheck your schedule for add/drop deadlines and use MyTMCC.\n\nRecords\n\nHow can I change my residency from out-of-state to Nevada?\n\nTo change your residency, please follow the information listed on Residency Classification.\n\nHow do I change my degree?\n\nYou may change your degree online by completing a Degree/Emphasis Change form.\n\nIf you are an International Student on an F-1 visa, you will need to meet with an International Student Advisor to change your degree.\n\nHow do I change my FERPA (privacy) status?\n\nLog into MyTMCC.\n\nClick on \"Student Center\".\n\nUnder the \"Personal Information\" area, click on the dropdown menu.\n\nSelect \"Privacy Settings\".\n\nClick on the double arrow.\n\nClick on the green \"Edit FERPA/Directory Restrictions\" button (bottom of the screen).\n\nSelect the option you would like to change to (we recommend the second option: no release for commercial purposes)\n\nClick \"Save\".\n\nHow do I formally declare a major?\n\nVisit the Steps to Graduate web page or contact Academic Advising for information.\n\nI have a new address, how can I update this information?\n\nLog in to MyTMCC to update your personal information.\n\nOnce you are logged in, click on \"Student Center\". Under \"Personal Information\" select the demographic data link to update your information.\n\nIf you have been placed on an address hold, you must contact Admissions and Records to have the hold removed.\n\nMy legal name has changed or is incorrect, how can I update this information?\n\nComplete the Request to Change Personal Identification Data form and turn it in, along with the legal proof of name change, to the Admissions and Records Office.\n\nWhat is a preferred name and how do I update it?\n\nTruckee Meadows Community College recognizes that members of our community use names other than their legal name to identify themselves. To support our community and their sense of identity, students and/or employees will be referred to by a preferred name whenever possible within the campus community. This preferred name will appear in select college-related systems and documents. The primary/legal name will continue to be used in all college-related systems and documents that require a verified legal name.\n\nTo update a preferred name, log into your MyTMCC student account. In the Student Center, under Personal Information, there is a link labeled Names. If a preferred name already exists click on the pencil icon to the right of the name to update it. If a preferred name does not exist click on the yellow button labeled Add a new name.\n\nWhere will my preferred name and legal name be used?\n\nPreferred names may be used in the following systems and records, including but not limited to: MyTMCC, Class Rosters, and Grade Rosters\n\nLegal names will continue to be used for official College records, including but not limited to: Official and unofficial transcripts, Student ID Cards, Student Account Statements (bills), Testing in the TMCC Testing Services office, Financial Aid and Scholarships, Paychecks, W2s, and other payroll documents.\n\nI updated my preferred name. Can my TMCC username and student email address be updated? Can my name be updated in Canvas?\n\nYes! If you would like to also change your TMCC username/TMCC email address, please contact Information Technology.\n\nIf you would like to change your name in Canvas, please contact WebCollege.\n\nIf you contact these offices, please have your Student ID number available.\n\nTranscripts\n\nDo I need my high school transcript or copy of my HSE (formerly GED) to register for classes?\n\nTranscripts are not required unless you are 17 years old or younger, applying for financial aid, or have recent ACT/SAT scores on your transcripts.\n\nHow can I find out If classes from other schools transfer to TMCC?\n\nView the information for Credit Evaluation for Transfer Students.\n\nHow can I obtain a TMCC transcript?\n\nCurrent students may view and print out unofficial transcripts using MyTMCC (log in to your Student Center).\n\nOfficial TMCC transcripts can be sent to other NSHE schools free of charge. Complete the online Transcript Request form.\n\nFor official transcripts being sent to all other colleges and universities, please go the National Student Clearinghouse. Note: there is a fee associated with this request.\n\nHow do I get transcripts from other schools sent to TMCC?\n\nTo have transcripts sent from another institution to TMCC, you must order the transcript directly from the institution you previously attended. Contact the institution to find out their requirements, transcript request forms and costs. Official electronic transcripts can be sent to transcripts@tmcc.edu. To have to transcript sent to TMCC via mail please use the following address:\n\nTruckee Meadows Community College\n\nAdmissions and Records RDMT 319\n\n7000 Dandini Blvd.\n\nReno, NV 89512\n\nI attended TMCC, but I'm not sure if I graduated. Where can I find out?\n\nPlease contact the Admissions and Records Office for copies of your records.\n\nSince MyTMCC is used by all NSHE institutions, do I still need to have my transcripts sent to TMCC from other NSHE schools I attended?\n\nNo. MyTMCC will not replace each institution's transcript request process.\n\nThis system allows syncing of information between institutions and the electronic delivery of transcripts from one institution to another, but it is still a student-initiated decision to have a transcript sent from one institution to another. Most schools will require that you arrange to have all previous coursework sent to the most recent institution you are attending.\n\nTransfer Credit Evaluation\n\nWhere can I see my evaluated transfer credits?\n\nOnce your transfer credits have been evaluated officially, you will see the courses in your MyTMCC Student Center on the transfer credit report, in your course history, and in your advisement report. Transfer credits will not appear on your TMCC transcript.\n\nWho decides how courses will transfer?\n\nTransfer courses are evaluated for general transferability by the Admissions and Records Office evaluators. Accepted courses at the university level may or may not apply toward a student's degree program. For more specific information, consult the Transfer Credit Policy.\n\nWill all of my accepted transfer courses apply toward my degree program?\n\nApplicability of transfer courses toward a student's degree program is determined by their the respective academic departments.
