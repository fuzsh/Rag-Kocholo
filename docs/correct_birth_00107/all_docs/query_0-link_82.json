        "text": "Singer-Songwriter Paul Simon Is Handsomely Wealthy — Just How Rich Is He?\n\nBy Tatayana Yomary\n\nDec. 21 2022, Published 4:07 p.m. ET\n\nMost folk-rock fans would agree that Paul Simon is one of the greatest contributions to the genre and popular music itself. Over the years, Paul has entertained fans as a half of the folk-rock duo, Simon & Garfunkel, with Art Garfunkel, and with his solo pursuits.\n\nFans enjoyed songs from Simon and Art like “The Boxer,\" \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,\" \"Graceland,\" and more. Additionally, the duo created four studio albums during their tenure and sold over 100 million albums to date.
