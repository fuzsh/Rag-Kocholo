        "text": "Fast Facts\n\nHad his first hit in 1957 with a singer he met in high school, Art Garfunkel: Billed as Tom and Jerry, they recorded \"Hey Schoolgirl\" when they were 16 years old\n\nHis professional breakthrough, as songwriter and singer with Simon and Garfunkel in the 1960s, came for two major reasons: producer Tom Wilson's decision to add a rock backing to the acoustic song \"The Sound of Silence\" and heavy use of Simon and Garfunkel songs in the 1967 hit movie The Graduate\n\nOne song featured in that film, \"Mrs\n\nRobinson,\" contained the line \"Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? A nation turns its lonely eyes to you\n\n\" The Baseball Hall of Fame slugger was puzzled: He once pointed out to Simon he hadn't gone anywhere, and had just done a Mr\n\nCoffee commercial\n\nSimon and Garfunkel broke up in 1970, at the time of the release of their most popular album, Bridge Over Troubled Water, as Garfunkel became focused on an acting career\n\nTheir song \"The Only Living Boy in New York,\" later featured in the 2004 film Garden State, was inspired by the changes in their relationship\n\nThe folk-rockers reunited over the years for lucrative tours, though their relationship remained strained\n\nSimon quickly rebounded from the breakup to become a huge success all over again, both critically and commercially, with such hits as \"Still Crazy After All These Years\" and \"Slip Slidin' Away\n\n\" Had a bit part as an unlikable record-company executive in the 1977 movie Annie Hall and starred, effectively, as a struggling musician in the 1980 movie, One Trick Pony, which he wrote\n\nHis landmark musical achievement---one amid many heights---came with the 1986 release of the classic album Graceland, which used South African rhythms to underscore some of his most memorable songs, including \"Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes\" and the brilliant title cut\n\nInducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, as a member of Simon and Garfunkel and as a solo artist\n\nOn May 23, 2007 he was the first recipient of the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song\n\nA founder of the Children's Health Fund, which brings medical care to children in underserved areas in the United States"
