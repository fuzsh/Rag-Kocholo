        "text": "Concert Review: Paul Simon At A Wet Forest Hills Stadium -A Triumphant Return Home to Queens\n\nPaul Simon was born in Newark, New Jersey. His family moved to Kew Gardens Hills, Queens, while he was four years old. So he grew up living on 70th Rd. near Jewel Ave, Main St. & Flushing Meadow Park.\n\nAs a teen he attended Forest Hills High School where he met Art Garfunkel starting a brilliant career. Many of his early songs were written on 70th Rd.\n\nTonight just a mile away from his old high school Paul Simon put on a fantastic show (the second of two sell outs) that was only dampened by the weather.\n\nThere was a rain delayed late start, over an hour, followed with a brief shower during & then a heavy down pour lasting just to the end of Simon's set to his first encores.\n\nThe rain was heavy, lightning was crackling in the skies as everyone crowded into the ancient stadiums underbelly below the grand stands. It was a mess but everyone survived.\n\nGod forbid Forest Hills Tennis Stadium postponed the show earlier in the day, since there was even a tornado watch. I guess if it may snow the entire city shuts down, but here it was ok to risk thousands of lives in the dangerous weather conditions.\n\nBut Simon & his band did the best to play to the wet crowd. The show even played past the usual 10PM curfew, ending at 11:10PM due to the late start.\n\nTonight Paul Simon played a variety of songs from his rather eclectic career. Songs ranging from his Simon & Garfunkel sixties days (which seemed to be the most popular with the crowd) to his solo career right, covering all types of world music influences & cultures, right up to his latest album, which is selling very well.\n\nHis nine piece band added great support behind him, but when Simon was alone with his guitar it made for the best parts of the show.\n\nAnytime one of his songs had a New York reference or Queens reference, the crowd gave a loud cheer of approval.\n\nNY References: Dazzling Blue: \"Sweet July we drove the Montauk Highway\" / That Was Your Mother: \"Well I'm standing on the corner of Lafayette, Across from the Public heading down to the Lone Star Cafe\" / Me & Julio Down By Schoolyard: \"Goodbye Rosie, the Queen of Corona\" / The Boxer: \"Going Home, Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me\" / The Sound of Silence: \"the words of the prophets were written on the subway walls.\"\n\nThe lyrics \"Girls out on the stoop\" from Late In the Evening as well as \"stepped outside to smoke myself a j\" got surprisingly loud cheers as well. Simon also had them dancing in the isles on many of the more up beat songs ie: Mother & Child Reunion / Julio / Obvious Child/ Diamonds on Sole of Her Shoes / You Can Call Me Al / Late In Evening . Oh & if rain was mentioned in the lyrics the crowd jeered!\n\nThere was even a treat covering That's All Right Mama certainly in tribute to the passing of Elvis guitarist Scottie Moore.\n\nTonight was the last night of his American tour, fittingly ending in Forest Hills for the home town boy. Simon himself has recently suggested this may be his last tour as thinks about retirement.\n\nIn any event he gave the Queens crowd a real treat as he ended the show with two surprises, breaking away from this tour's customary set list.\n\nHe did the classics: Sound of Silence & Bridge Over Troubled Waters. With the latter he stated I don't sing this one too often but everyone seems to want to hear it. And in my opinion these may have been his best vocals of the evening.\n\nSimon & Garfunkel at Simons 70th Rd. Queens Childhood home 1975\n\nSimon looks good at 74 years of age, donning a grey Queens t-shirt changing his sports jackets to a variety of different colors throughout the show.\n\nHis voice still sounds great even if not still having all the elegance it once had. Simon still carried the tunes beautifully through the Queens night, drifting over the Forest Hills Tennis club & into the overcast skies. It was certainly an amazing performance & one hell of a concert.\n\nthanks to these youtube posts from the forest hills concert:\n\nset list Forest Hills Stadium 7/1/16\n\nThe Boy In the Bubble\n\n50 Ways To Leave Your Lover\n\nDazzling Blue\n\nThat Was Your Mother\n\nRewrite\n\nHonky Tonk\n\nSlip Slidin' Away\n\nMother & Child Reunion\n\nMe & Julio Down By The Schoolyard\n\nSpirit Voices\n\nThe Obvious Child\n\nStranger to Stranger\n\nHomeward Bound\n\nEl Condor Pasa (If I Could)\n\nDuncan\n\nThe Werewolf\n\nThe Cool Cool River\n\nDiamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes\n\nYou Can Call Me Al\n\nencore1\n\nWristband\n\nI Know What I Know\n\nLate In the Evening\n\nStill Crazy After All These Years\n\nencore2\n\nThat's All Right Mama\n\nThe Boxer\n\nThe Sound of Silence\n\nBridge Over Troubled Water\n\nthanks to these youtube posts from the forest hills concert:\n\nRemembering Bobby Ojeda's Tragic Boating Accident (1993)\n\nSteve Olin, Tim Crews & Bob Ojeda March 22 nd 1993: was an off day from Spring Training, for three Cleveland Indians pitchers; Former Mets 1986 World Champion pitcher; Bobby Ojeda, Tim Crews & Steve Olin. The three friends, took out an 18-foot open-air bass boat & went out fishing & gator hunting in the darkness of the evening on Lake Nellie in Clermont, Florida. Tragedy struck, when the boat rammed into a private dock that jutted out some 250 feet into the still waters. Two other Cleveland Indians personnel had arrived to meet the fishing party just as the horror took place. They heard Bob Ojeda saying they needed help. The two men jumped into the water and called out for someone to call 911. 27 year old pitcher; Steve Olin was killed instantly. 31 year old pitcher; Tim Crews was alive but was struggling to breathe suffering from massive head wounds. Bobby Ojeda was in & out of shock, he was suffering from head lacerations but was coherent.

At the time the Mets were still holding Spring Training in St. Petersburg Florida. Morris was filmed being interviewed by his SNL cast mate, Bill Murray as the fictional Mets player: Chico Escuela who wore uniform #5 (cinque). Escuela was famous for his spoof of the Latin players of the time, who did not speak much English. His famous quote \"baseball been berry- berry good to me\" began the previous year on SNL's weekend update. Bill Murray & Ed Kranepool It was said during the mock 1979 Spring Training interview, that Chico who was a nine time All Star second baseman, had given up his job at the Weekend Update Sports desk to make a comeback with the Mets at age 41. Chico had fictionally written a tell all baseball book; \"Bad Stuff About the Mets\" which tick\n\nRemembering Vixen Founder / Guitarist; Jan Kuehnemund (1961-2013)\n\ncenterfieldmaz was shocked to learn of the sudden passing of Jan Kuehnemund, the founding member of the all female metal band Vixen. Jan was a fantastic guitarist, song writer & women pioneer in Heavy Metal. I am a huge fan of hard rock all girl bands & Vixen were one my long time favorites. Janice Lynn Kuehnemund was born November 18th, 1961 in St. Paul Minnesota. The female guitarist formed one of the first all female Metal bands in Minnesota with singer Janet Gardner while in high school in 1980. By 1985 they moved the band to Los Angles California, to be part of the Heavy Metal scene. In 1987 the classic Vixen line up of Jan Kuehnemund (lead guitar) Janet Gardner (vocals/ guitar) Share Pederson (bass) & Roxy Petrucci (drums) formed & released their debut album the following year. Vixen 1988 In a world of all male Heavy Metal bands during its heyday, Vixen were groundbreaking in being an all female metal band.
