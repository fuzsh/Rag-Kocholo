        "text": "Paul Simon is an American singer-songwriter perhaps known best for being part of the folk rock duo Simon & Garfunkel, but he has also carved out a very successful solo career.\n\nSome of his well-known songs include \"Slip Slidin' Away\", \"Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard\", \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\", and \"You Can Call Me Al\", as well as Simon & Garfunkel Classics such as \"The Sound of Silence\" and \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\".\n\nPaul Simon has won numerous Grammy Awards alongside Art Garfunkel and as a solo artist and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, among numerous other awards and honors.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly Life and Simon & Garfunkel (1941-1970)[]\n\n(Main Article: Simon & Garfunkel.)\n\nPaul Simon was born in Newark, New Jersey to parents Louis Simon; a college English teacher, and Belle Simon; who taught in elementary school. He had one younger brother, Eddie Simon. In 1945 their family moved to Queens in New York City.\n\nPaul Simon met Art Garfunkel at their local school when they were both 11, and they began performing together when they were 13. Their first recorded song together was \"Hey Schoolgirl\" in 1957, which became a minor hit, gaining radio airplay and charting at #49 in record sales.\n\nPaul Simon recorded several songs under different aliases between 1956-1964, and he was also a member of the band The Mystics, as well as Tico and the Triumphs for a brief period of time.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in Forest Hills, Paul Simon majored in English in college and graduated in 1963. A year later, Simon & Garfunkel released their first album, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M..\n\nWhen this album was decidedly not a commercial success, Simon & Garfunkel split up and Paul Simon moved to England, where he met Kathy Chitty (the inspiration for \"Kathy's Song\") and recorded The Paul Simon Songbook.\n\nAfter a remix of \"The Sound of Silence\" from their début album was gaining traction on the U.S. east coast, Paul Simon moved back to the United States to reconnect with Art Garfunkel, and they quickly recorded a second album, named Sounds of Silence after the hit.\n\nIn the remainder of the '60s, Simon & Garfunkel recorded three more albums, plus The Graduate Soundtrack before splitting up in 1970.\n\nEarly Solo Years (1971-1981)[]\n\nAfter Simon & Garfunkel split up in 1970, Paul Simon once again began pursuing a solo career, releasing his eponymous album in 1972, which was preceded by the early release of \"Mother and Child Reunion\". It also notably featured the hit single \"Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard\".\n\nThere Goes Rhymin' Simon was released in 1973, and \"Kodachrome\", \"Loves Me Like a Rock\", and \"American Tune\" were all released as singles from the album. He went on a promotional tour to support the album, and part of that tour was recorded and released as the live album Live Rhymin'.\n\nStill Crazy After All These Years was released in 1975, with the title track and \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\".\n\nIn 1976, Paul Simon took a break from recording to host a benefit concert for the New York Public Library at Madison Square Garden. In addition to Paul Simon, Jimmy Cliff, Phoebe Snow, and The Brecker Brothers all performed at this concert.\n\nThe compilation album Greatest Hits, Etc. was released in 1977. This was the first album which \"Slip Slidin' Away\" appeared on, and it has appeared on almost every other compilation album since.\n\nAfter Paul Simon's contract with Columbia Records ended in 1977, he signed on with Warner Bros. Records. He released the album One-Trick Pony in 1980, the soundtrack to the film of the same name which Paul Simon wrote and starred in. The album produced the hit single \"Late in the Evening\".\n\n1981 marked the historic meetup of Simon & Garfunkel for the famous Concert in Central Park in New York City, where they performed Simon & Garfunkel classics as well as new songs. They followed the concert up with a Simon & Garfunkel world tour. Paul Simon also hosted the 23rd Annual Grammy Awards Ceremony in 1981.\n\nMidlife (1983-1993)[]\n\nPaul Simon released his next album, Hearts and Bones in 1983, but it was not much of a success, and Paul Simon believed that this could be the end of his musical career.\n\nIn January 1985, Paul Simon found himself as a member of the supergroup USA for Africa in the recording of the charity single \"We Are the World\" for famine relief in Africa. Not a month later, he decided to take a trip to Africa for himself, where he was inspired to record the Graceland album, often considered to be one of his best albums.\n\nThe recording took place throughout 1985 and 1986, the first part in South Africa and later in New York, and the album was released in August 1986. The lead single \"You Can Call Me Al\" is about his midlife crisis and how he 'found grace' in Africa.\n\nJust as his previous album was largely based on African music styles, Paul Simon's next album, The Rhythm of the Saints was largely based on Brazilian music, and part of the recording took place in Rio de Janeiro. It was released in October 1990.\n\nIn 1991, 10 years after his memorable concert with Art Garfunkel, Paul Simon hosted his own concert in Central Park along with African and South American musicians, and the live album version of this concert is available as Paul Simon's Concert in the Park.\n\nLater Years (1995-2015)[]\n\nIn 1995, Paul Simon appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show for its tenth anniversary, performing his new song \"Ten Years\" for the occasion. He would appear again on the final season of the show 15 years later with a new version of the song for the show's 25th anniversary.\n\nIn early 1998, a play which Paul had been working on for a while called The Capeman was finally opened, but it turned out not to be a commercial success and had to be shut down after just 2 months. The soundtrack album for the play, Songs from The Capeman can still be purchased.\n\nWith the new millennium came the release of Paul Simon's new album You're the One, and his 11th studio album, Surprise was released in 2006.\n\nHis 12th studio album, So Beautiful or So What was released in 2011, preceded by the early release of \"Getting Ready for Christmas Day\".\n\nIn 2012, Paul Simon paid tribute to Chuck Berry and Leonard Cohen at the first annual PEN Awards at the JFK Library in Boston.\n\nPaul Simon performed alongside Sting for three years in 2013, 2014, and 2015, and he has also performed with fellow New York musician Billy Joel on a few occasions.\n\nReleased in 2016, Stranger to Stranger is Paul Simon's most recent album of new material to date, and In the Blue Light, featuring re-recordings of some of Paul Simon's older songs, was released in 2018.\n\nHe cameos twice in the 2016 TV series Horace and Pete, which he also wrote the theme song for.\n\nPaul Simon announced his retirement from touring in 2018, and the final concert of his 'Homeward Bound' farewell tour took place in New York City on September 22, 2018.\n\nAwards and Honors[]\n\nIn addition to the nine Grammy Awards and a Lifetime Achievement Award given to Simon & Garfunkel, Paul Simon won many Awards as a solo artist. He won Album of the Year and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for Still Crazy After All These Years in 1976 and Album of the Year again in 1987 for Graceland, as well as Record of the Year the next year for its title track. Paul Simon also won the Brit Award for International Solo Artist in 1987, and the Polar Music Prize in 2012.\n\nHe was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and received their Johnny Mercer Award in 1998, and he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist in 2001, having already been inducted in 1990 as part of Simon & Garfunkel. He was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2011, and he performed \"American Tune\" at the induction ceremony.\n\nHe was the recipient of one of the Kennedy Center Honors in 2002 and was cited by Time Magazine as one of the \"100 People Who Shaped the World\" in 2006.\n\nHe received the very first Gershwin Prize awarded by the Library of Congress in 2007, and several artists payed tribute to him at the award ceremony, including Stevie Wonder, Alison Krauss, Jerry Douglas, and James Taylor. This event was recorded and is now available on DVD, called Paul Simon and Friends.\n\nPaul Simon received an honorary degree from the Berklee College of Music in 1986 and serves on their Board of Trustees, and another from from Brandeis University in 2010, where he performed \"The Boxer\" at the commencement ceremony.\n\nHe is cited by Rolling Stone Magazine as the eighth best songwriter of all time, as well as the 93rd greatest guitar player.\n\nPersonal Life and Philanthropy[]\n\nSome of Paul Simon's songwriting inspiration comes from artists he admires, including The Everly Brothers, Woody Guthrie, and Lead Belly.\n\nOutside of music, Paul Simon has mentioned his passion for baseball on multiple occasions.\n\nIn 1969, Paul Simon married Peggy Harper, and they had a single son named Harper Simon, but they divorced in 1975.\n\nHe married again in 1983, this time to actress Carrie Fisher, known for playing Leia in the Star Wars films, but this marriage only lasted for a year until divorcing again.\n\nIn 1992, Simon married singer-songwriter Edie Brickell, and they are together to this day. They have three children, named Adrian, Lulu, and Gabriel.\n\nIn 2003, Paul Simon became a supporter of Little Kids Rock, a charitable organization that provides free musical instruments and music lessons to children. He holds the position of honorary member on the board of directors.\n\nHe is also one of the co-founders of the Children's Health Project and the Children's Health Fund.\n\nDiscography[]\n\nSingles
