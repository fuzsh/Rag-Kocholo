        "text": "Paul Simon Born at the Right Time Tour 1991\n\nPaul Frederic Simon (born October 13, 1941) is an American musician, singer, and songwriter. Simon's fame, influence, and commercial success began as part of the duo Simon & Garfunkel, formed in 1964 with musical partner Art Garfunkel. Simon wrote most of the pair's songs, including three that reached No. 1 on the U.S. singles charts: \"The Sound of Silence\", \"Mrs. Robinson\", and \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\". The duo split up in 1970 at the height of their popularity, and Simon began a successful solo career as a guitarist and singer-songwriter, recording three highly acclaimed albums over the next five years. In 1986, he released Graceland, an album inspired by South African township music.\n\nSimon has earned 12 Grammys for his solo and collaborative work, including the Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2001, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and in 2006 was selected as one of the \"100 People Who Shaped the World\" by Time magazine. Among many other honors, Simon was the first recipient of the Library of Congress's Gershwin Prize for Popular Song in 2007. In 1986 Simon was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Music degree from Berklee College of Music where he currently serves on the Board of Trustees.\n\nThe success of both albums (Graceland and The Rhythm of the Saints) allowed Simon to stage another New York concert. On August 15, 1991, almost a decade after his concert with Garfunkel, Simon staged a second concert in Central Park with African and South American bands. The success of the concert surpassed all expectations, and reportedly over 750,000 people attended—one of the largest concert audiences in history. He later remembered the concert as, \"...the most memorable moment in my career.\" The success of the show led to both a live album and an Emmy-winning TV special. In the middle, Simon embarked on the successful Born at the Right Time Tour, and promoted the album with further singles, including \"Proof\"—accompanied with a humorous video featuring, again, Chevy Chase. On March 4, 1992 he appeared on his own MTV Unplugged, offering renditions of many of his most famous compositions. Broadcast in June, the show was a success, though it did not receive an album release.\n\nSize Very Large Format 280 x 420 mm or 16.5\" X 11.5\" Lots of great pictures and full band list including information on the tour.\n\nCondition Used 8/10 Very Good\n\nThis Item due to very large size will incur a $10.00 handling fee per item (including free shipping)\n\n(Please Note scans are low res for fast loading)\n\nAll Payments by Paypal Just Checkout as GUEST no need to register.\n\nAll Programs sold as is - Condition: Used Good 8/10 Looks Great - Souvenir Brochure"
