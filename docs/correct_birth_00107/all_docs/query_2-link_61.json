        "text": "(born 1941). Originally half of the renowned folk duo Simon and Garfunkel, the American singer, songwriter, and guitarist Paul Simon went on to become a successful solo pop entertainer. He distinguished himself from other folk-based artists with a musical style as unique and expressive as his lyrics. His expansive sound incorporated elements of rock, jazz, reggae, salsa, blues, gospel, New Orleans, South African, and Brazilian music.\n\nBorn Paul Frederic Simon on October 13, 1941, in Newark, New Jersey, Simon grew up in the Queens borough of New York City. His father was a jazz bassist who later became a college professor. As a young boy, Paul accompanied him to music stores where he was exposed to a variety of musical styles. Paul met Art Garfunkel in grade school in the early 1950s, and by high school they had formed a duet called Tom and Jerry. Their first hit single, “Hey Schoolgirl,” was recorded while they were still in high school.\n\nDuring the early 1960s Simon recorded a number of solo singles under the name Jerry Landis while continuing to work with Garfunkel. Simon attended Queens College in Brooklyn, New York, and entered Brooklyn Law School, dropping out after a year to devote himself to music full time. He earned money making demo tapes with other performers, including Carole King. Meanwhile, Simon and Garfunkel had begun performing in local New York clubs and honing their sound, eventually starting to call themselves Simon and Garfunkel. Their first album, Wednesday Morning, 3 am (1964), which included an acoustic version of the song “The Sounds of Silence,” was not a commercial success. An embellished version of the song, released two years later on the album The Sounds of Silence (1966), became a number one single and a folk-rock classic. They followed up with a string of hits, including “The Boxer”; “Mrs. Robinson,” from the film The Graduate (1968); “The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin’ Groovy)”; “Scarborough Fair/Canticle”; and “Bridge over Troubled Water.” In 1971 Simon and Garfunkel split, though they continued to perform and record together on occasion throughout their solo careers. The duo was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.\n\nThroughout the 1970s Simon had one hit after another with “Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard,” “Loves Me Like a Rock,” “Slip Slidin’ Away,” and “Fifty Ways to Leave Your Lover.” The album Still Crazy After All These Years (1975) earned Simon a Grammy Award. He played a small, nonsinging role in Woody Allen’s film Annie Hall (1977), and he later wrote the screenplay and soundtrack and starred in a much less successful film, One-Trick Pony (1980).\n\nDuring the 1980s Simon saw his career rise and fall. After the critical and commercial failure of Hearts and Bones (1983), Simon traveled to South Africa, where he jammed with local bands, including Ladysmith Black Mambazo. His album Graceland (1986) featured his collaborations with South African musicians and helped bring world music to mainstream audiences. Graceland eventually sold more than 10 million copies, earning Simon another Grammy Award. His next album, The Rhythm of the Saints (1990), combined Brazilian, zydeco, and West African music.\n\nFollowing the failure of his Broadway play The Capeman in 1998, Simon began work on the album You’re the One (2000), which was nominated for a Grammy Award. His later albums included Surprise (2006), which featured music layered with electronic instrumentation and rhythms, and So Beautiful or So What (2011), which was billed as a return to traditional songwriting.\n\nSimon was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo performer in 2001. In 2007 he became the first recipient of the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song."
