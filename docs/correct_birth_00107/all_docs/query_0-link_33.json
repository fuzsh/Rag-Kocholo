        "text": "Paul Frederic Simon (born October 13, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist.\n\nSimon is best known for his success, beginning in 1965, as part of the duo Simon & Garfunkel, with musical partner Art Garfunkel. Simon wrote most of the pair's songs, including three that reached number one on the US singles charts: \"The Sound of Silence\", \"Mrs. Robinson\", and \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\". In 1970, at the height of their popularity, the duo split, and Simon began a successful solo career, recording three highly-acclaimed albums over the next five years. In 1986, he released Graceland, an album inspired by South African township music that helped fuel the anti-apartheid movement (and brought the group Ladysmith Black Mambazo to prominence.) Besides music, Simon wrote and starred in the film One-Trick Pony in 1980 and co-wrote the Broadway musical The Capeman in 1998.\n\nThrough his solo and collaborative work, Simon has earned 13 Grammys, including the Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2001, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and in 2006 was selected as one of the \"100 People Who Shaped the World\" by Time magazine. Among many other honors, Simon was named the first recipient of the Library of Congress's Gershwin Prize for Popular Song in 2007.\n\nBiography[]\n\nDiscography[]\n\nMain article: Paul Simon discography\n\nAlbums[]\n\nThe Paul Simon Songbook (released May 1965)\n\nI Am A Rock\n\nLeaves That Are Green\n\nA Church Is Burning\n\nApril Come She Will\n\nThe Sound of Silence\n\nA Most Peculiar Man\n\nHe Was My Brother\n\nKathy's Song\n\nThe Side Of A Hill\n\nA Simple Desultory Phillippic (Or How I Was Robert McNamara'd Into ...)\n\nFlowers Never Bend With The Rainfall\n\nPatterns\n\nI Am A Rock\n\nA Church Is Burning\n\nPaul Simon (released January 1972)\n\nMother And Child Reunion\n\nDuncan\n\nEverything Put Together Falls Apart\n\nRun That Body Down\n\nArmistice Day\n\nMe And Julio Down By The Schoolyard\n\nPeace Like A River\n\nPapa Hobo\n\nHobo's Blues\n\nParanoia Blues\n\nCongratulations\n\nThere Goes Rhymin' Simon (released May 1973)\n\nKodachrome\n\nTenderness\n\nTake Me To The Mardi Gras\n\nSomething So Right\n\nOne Man's Ceiling Is Another Man's Floor\n\nAmerican Tune\n\nWas A Sunny Day\n\nLearn How To Fall\n\nSt. Judy's Comet\n\nLoves Me Like A Rock\n\nStill Crazy After All These Years (release October 1975)\n\nStill Crazy After All These Years\n\nMy Little Town\n\nI Do It For Your Love\n\n50 Ways To Leave Your Lover\n\nNight Game\n\nGone At Last\n\nSome Folks' Lives Roll Easy\n\nHave A Good Time\n\nYou're Kind\n\nSilent Eyes\n\nOne-Trick Pony (released August 1980)\n\nLate In The Evening\n\nThat's Why God Made The Movies\n\nOne-Trick Pony\n\nHow The Heart Approaches What It Yearns\n\nOh, Marion\n\nAce In The Hole\n\nNobody\n\nJonah\n\nGod Bless The Absentee\n\nLong Long Day\n\nHearts And Bones (released October 1983)\n\nAllergies\n\nHearts And Bones\n\nWhen Numbers Get Serious\n\nThink Too Much (B)\n\nSong About The Moono\n\nThink Too Much (A)\n\nTrain In The Distance\n\nRene And Georgette Magritte With Their Dog After The War\n\nCars Are Cars\n\nThe Late Great Johnny Ace\n\nGraceland (released August 25, 1986)\n\nThe Boy In The Bubble\n\nGraceland\n\nI Know What I Know\n\nGumboots\n\nDiamonds On The Soles Of Her Shoes\n\nYou Can Call Me Al\n\nUnder African Skies\n\nHomeless\n\nCrazy Love, Vol. II\n\nThat Was Your Mother\n\nAll Around The World Or The Myth Of Fingerprints\n\nHomeless\n\nDiamonds On The Soles Of Her Shoes (Alternate Version)\n\nAll Around The World Or The Myth Of Fingerprints (Early Version)\n\nThe Story Of Graceland\n\nAwards[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nSimilar Artists[]\n\nReferences[]"
