        "text": "Paul Simon\n\nSinger, songwriter, guitarist\n\nFor the Record…\n\nSelected discography\n\nSources\n\n“Paul Simon has emerged in the 1980s as a rocker for all ages, one figure from the ’60s entering midlife not as a jejune nostalgia act but thriving both financially and artistically,” wrote Jim Jerome in People magazine. Simon, one of the most successful folk-rockers of the 1960s, has indeed been able to sustain his success through two ensuing decades and through a number of fleeting pop music fads. As a member of Simon and Garfunkel, and later a solo performer, the singer/songwriter seems to have stayed in style precisely because he creates the style—from folk-influenced rock ballads to rollicking gospel and rhythm & blues numbers to jazz- and reggae-fueled tunes.\n\nA New Yorker contributor noted that Simon’s collected body of works “form one of the most original and moving bodies of pop music in America.” Addressing himself to the lyrics Simon has written, Saturday Review essayist Bruce Pollock claimed: “Simon’s songs mirrored the alienation, malaise, and despair of the [1960s] era, but did so melodiously, with a good beat, so you could dance to them…. Like the rest of us, Paul Simon has finally passed through adolescence, long considered a terminal condition not only of rock ’n’ roll but also of the generation that came to majority in the Sixties. That generation became hooked on rock music as a way of receiving its essential data. And today these same listeners, older and somewhat wiser, continue to respond to Simon [who has] arrived at a more mature perspective and [is] able to mirror in [his] works something beyond pop platitudes.”\n\nSimon grew up in the Forest Hills section of Queens, New York. The son of two schoolteachers, he describes himself as a happy child who was very interested in sports. He found popular music at the same moment that rock and roll was finding itself—in the early 1950s. At the same time he became friends with a gangly youth just his age, Art Garfunkel, who lived in his neighborhood. Together the boys would listen to the radio for hours, fascinated by Elvis Presley and Bill Haley and The Comets. They also began singing together, accompanied by Simon’s simple guitar chords. Even before they turned sixteen, Simon and Garfunkel were performing together at local sock hops; a producer from Big Records heard them and offered them a recording contract.\n\nAt the tender age of fifteen, Simon and Garfunkel, then called “Tom and Jerry,” had their first success—a single called “Hey! Schoolgirl.” They were invited to sing on “American Bandstand” and several other rock and roll television shows of the time. Simon remembers those days with mixed feelings. “I must have been very angry, probably about not growing [tall],” he told People.\n\nFor the Record…\n\nBorn October 13, 1941, in Newark, N.J.; son of Louis (a college professor) and Belle (a schoolteacher) Simon; married Peggy Harper, 1969 (divorced, 1975); married Carrie Fisher (an actress), 1983 (divorced, 1983); children: (first marriage) Harper (son). Education: Received B. A. from Queens College; attended Brooklyn Law School.\n\nSinger and songwriter, 1956—. Performed with Art Garfunkel as Tom and Jerry, 1957-59; performed with Garfunkel as Simon and Garfunkel, 1964-71; solo performer, 1971—. Has appeared in numerous cable television concerts and in several commercial television specials, including “Simon and Garfunkel,” CBS-TV, 1969, and “Paul Simon,” NBC-TV, 1977.

Office—c/o Warner Bros. Records, 3300 Warner Blvd., Burbank CA 91510.\n\n“I was doing well. When I was fifteen Artie and I played on American Bandstand.I batted first on the baseball team. I had a school jacket with letters and everything on it. I was popular. But I was a real angry guy. I spent a lot of time by myself playing guitar.”\n\nTom and Jerry did not follow up their first hit song with others. Instead, Simon and Garfunkel went their separate ways, Simon to studies at Queen’s College and Garfunkel to Columbia University. They were reunited in the early 1960s, while Simon was unenthusiastically reading law at Brooklyn Law School. Simon had never given up music entirely; in fact, he had been working as a backup player and producer in several New York recording studios. He and Garfunkel began to perform original folk tunes at outdoor concerts and small clubs, and soon they had attracted a regional following. In 1964 they earned a recording contract with the Columbia label.\n\nTheir first album, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M., attracted little attention. In late 1965, more than a year after the album’s debut, Columbia—without Simon’s knowledge—overdubbed a rock accompanyment to one of the album’s songs, “The Sounds of Silence.” Released as a single, the remixed version of the song shot to the number one spot on the Billboard Top 100 chart. A string of hits followed for the duo, including “I Am a Rock,” “Mrs. Robinson,” “Scarborough Fair/Canticle,” and “The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin’ Groovy),” most of which are still staples of “classic rock” radio stations.\n\nAccording to Dave Marsh in the Rolling Stone Record Guide, Simon and Garfunkel’s “socially relevant but gentle folk rock … quietly bridged the Sixties generation gap.” Marsh adds that Simon’s “elliptical, imagistic writing soon became very big on the rock-lyrics-are-poetry circuit, but he was really an expert popular-song craftsman, influenced by both folk and rock but owing allegiance to neither.” Simon was largely responsible for the duo’s songs, providing the lyrics and most of the music, but it was Garfunkel—whose clear tenor voice and gentle appearance charmed audiences—who frequently received credit for the group’s success. This conundrum became painfully clear when Simon and Garfunkel released their best-known hit, “Bridge over Troubled Water,” in 1970. The song and album of the same title sold more than nine million copies in two years, but even that level of achievement failed to save the relationship. After many years of heated arguments, Simon and Garfunkel split in 1971 to pursue solo careers.\n\nCritics issued dire predictions about Simon’s viability as a solo performer, underestimating his talent for incorporating various musical styles into his repertory while continuing to issue his poetic and introspective lyrics. His first solo album, Paul Simon, included a hit single, “Mother and Child Reunion,” that carried a reggae beat and an unusually optimistic message. Every Simon album since then has had at least one memorable single, and all show Simon’s enthusiasm for experimentation. His solo hits include the gospel-sounding “Love Me Like a Rock,” the calypso “Late in the Evening, “”Fifty Ways To Leave Your Lover, “”One Trick Pony,” “American Tune,” and “Call Me Al.” Almost thirty years to the day after his first recorded hit, Simon released the album Graceland, a frankly experimental collage of music featuring performers from South Africa and a spirited African beat. The album won Simon another Grammy Award and was one of the best sellers of 1987. Marsh finds Simon’s solo albums in general “among the greatest popular music anyone in the current era has attempted.”\n\nNo one shows more facility at assessing Paul Simon’s music than the artist himself. He explained how he works in Rolling Stone: “What I feel is, you take basic rock & roll as your primary vocabulary…. I don’t mean heavy metal, I mean the Fifties—doo-wop, Presley, Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, the Drifters, that kind of urban R & B and rockabilly. Now, from there I expand to other textures and rhythms. I expand the harmonic concept [to include Brazilian music and modern jazz]—that harmonic way of approaching things, and also the use of different time signatures. So, I’ll take the basic rock thing and expand it into different areas musically, and then I’ll contract it back to the rock thing. Always coming back to the basics—to either gospel, or rock—but goin’ away so it doesn’t sound like everything….\n\n“Lyrically, what I do is in a sense parallel to the music. I try to combine ordinary speech patterns—a vernacular way of speaking—… with poetic imagery…. I try to balance that between striking visual images and ordinary speech. And ordinary speech can be used with the extended harmonic thing to create a sense of irony or contrast, while I can use a strong visual or poetic image with a basic rock & roll thing to undercut.” Simon has also never apologized for the somber tone of his lyrics—noticeable since his earliest songs. “I’m investigating … all the time, asking what is the problem, what is it….” he told Esquire.”Part of my personality keeps pushing at what hurts, what hurts.”\n\nSimon’s personal life has often offered fuel for his introspective lyrics. Twice married and divorced, he admits to having difficulties sustaining close relationships. He has reconciled with Garfunkel to the extent that they occasionally play and record together (they shared a late 1970s hit “My Little Town,” for instance), but he prefers solitude or the company of his teenaged son, Harper. Simon lives in New York City, and, since he has retained rights to all of his songs, is very wealthy. He told People: “Entertainers are paid disproportionately high sums of money for their contribution to society. I used to feel guilty, but now I accept that gratefully. When someone tells me, ‘You’ve given me a lot of pleasure in my life,’ it all seems like a gratifying, very pure way of earning money.” Undaunted by the fact that he will soon turn fifty, Simon plans to continue composing and performing music as long as he has an audience who wants to hear him. “If I’m healthy,” he told People, “I’ll still be doing what I’ve done since I was 13—writing songs. It’s as exhilarating now as ever. I get a very satisfied feeling that I never get in any other part of my life.”\n\nSelected discography\n\nSimon and Garfunkel albums\n\nWednesday Morning, 3 A.M., Columbia, 1966.\n\nThe Sounds of Silence, Columbia, 1966.\n\nParsley Sage Rosemary & Thyme, Columbia, 1966.\n\nBookends, Columbia, 1968.\n\nThe Graduate (soundtrack), Columbia, 1968.\n\nBridge over Troubled Waters, Columbia, 1970.\n\nSimon and Garfunkel’s Greatest Hits, Columbia, 1972.\n\nConcert in Central Park, Warner Brothers, 1981.\n\nSolo albums\n\nPaul Simon, Columbia, 1972; reissued, Warner Bros., 1988.\n\nThere Goes Rhymin’ Simon, Columbia, 1973; reissed, Warner Bros., 1988.\n\nLive Rhymin’: Paul Simon in Concert, Columbia, 1974; reissued, Warner Bros., 1988.\n\nStill Crazy after All These Years, Columbia, 1975.\n\nOne Trick Pony, WEA, 1980.\n\nHearts and Bones, Warner Bros., 1983.\n\nGraceland, Warner Bros., 1986.\n\nSources\n\nBooks\n\nThe Rolling Stone Record Guide, edited by Dave Marsh, Random House/Rolling Stone Press, 1979.\n\nSimon, George T., The Best of the Music Makers, Doubleday, 1979.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nEsquire, June, 1987.\n\nHigh Fidelity, May, 1982.\n\nNew Yorker, September 2, 1967; April 29, 1972.\n\nNew York Post, May 26, 1973.\n\nNew York Times, February 27, 1972.\n\nNew York Times Magazine, October 13, 1968.\n\nPeople, September 5, 1983; November 3, 1980; October 6, 1986.\n\nRolling Stone, May 28, 1970; October 30, 1980; July 2, 1987.\n\nSaturday Review, June 12, 1976.\n\nTime, January 31, 1972.\n\n—Anne Janette Johnson\n\nPaul Simon\n\nSinger, songwriter, guitarist\n\nFor the Record…\n\nWords and Music\n\nGoing Solo\n\nGraceland\n\nSelected discography\n\nSources\n\nNewsweek’s Jeff Giles—in a 1993 profile celebrating Paul Simon’s three-disc career retrospective—referred to the veteran performer as “the only songwriter of his generation still curious, bent on change and utterly awake.” Tony Scherman of Life seconded this view: “Few longtime pop-music idols have steered their careers so gracefully into the present.” Simon’s recipe for long-term career vitality, it would seem, contains equal parts insatiable passion for musical growth and lingering insecurity.\n\nAfter turning his partnership with singer Art Garfunkel into a hit pop act, Simon went on to become one of the premier solo singer-songwriters of the 1970s. Though he experienced a slump of sorts in the ensuing decade, he came roaring back with Graceland, which garnered critical raves and multi-platinum sales. Even then, however, he was forced to fend off claims of musical imperialism for his use of South African song forms and employment of African musicians; his subsequent album relied on Brazilian music in a similar way and received the same criticism.\n\nFor the Record…\n\nBorn October 13, 1941, in Newark, NJ; son of Louis (a former musician and college professor) and Belle (a schoolteacher) Simon; married Peggy Harper, 1969 (divorced, 1975); married Carrie Fisher (an actress), 1983 (divorced, 1983); married Edie Brickell (a singer-songwriter), 1992; children: (first marriage) Harper, (third marriage) Adrian.

Still, his artistic and commercial growth have not seemed to alleviate the insecurity that keeps him on edge. “He’s particularly vulnerable when he’s writing, “noted Simon’s friend Lome Michaels, best known as producer of the TV program Saturday Night Live.” Sometimes he’ll play you a song and you’ll go, That’s great!’ and he seems genuinely surprised you like it. He’s pretty rough on himself.”\n\nWords and Music\n\nA quintessential Manhattanite in adulthood—his urbane lyrics are rivaled in sophistication only by his nuanced melodies—Simon was born in Newark, New Jersey, and grew up in Queens, New York. His mother was a schoolteacher; his father worked as a jazz bassist for many years before becoming a college professor. The anti-Semitic tenor of the late 1940s moved the elder Simon to disguise his Jewish surname: “He used the name Lou Sims, “Simon told Life. Further reminiscing about his father, he revealed, “When I was five or six, he would bring me to Manny’s [music store] on 48th Street, where he bought his bass strings and rosin. So I knew a world that was pre-rock and roll. “Ultimately, however, his father became bored with the musician’s life and entered academia, receiving a doctorate in semantics—the study of language. “The older I get, “Simon ventured, “the more I realize that my thing is so much like my father’s. I’m his kid, more and more interested in words.”\n\nWhat caught his fancy at first, however, was a sound—the sound of early rock and roll. During the 1950s he and his pal Arthur Garfunkel formed a duet called Tom and Jerry—camouflaging their Jewish names just as Simon’s father had—and became stars while still in high school, thanks to the hit single “Hey Schoolgirl. “Though Tom and Jerry saw no further chart action, Simon soon found himself working with another promising young singer-songwriter. “Carole King and I made a lot of demos—Carole Klein, from Brooklyn,” he recollected in Life.” She’d play piano and drums, I could play bass and guitar, and we sang all the parts. That’s where I learned how to stack [overlay] voices and do overdubs—how to make records. One moment we were making demos; the next she was making $150,000 a year writing Number One hits. It was very demoralizing to me.”\n\nSimon recorded a number of solo singles as “Jerry Landis” and saw some of them recorded by other acts. He attended Queens College while Garfunkel was at Columbia. He then tried Brooklyn Law School. Finally, the two decided to work together again and began performing in local clubs.\n\nBy the dawn of the 1960s, “ethnic” —including ethnic-sounding names—was in vogue and folk music was catching the national ear; the duo became Simon and Garfunkel. Their first album, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M., fared poorly, and Simon went to England for a time to play the folk scene there. But on its re-release in 1966—following a retooled pop version of their single “The Sounds of Silence” that featured drums—the record became a hit. Merging the evocative, lyrically dense folk-rock popularized by Bob Dylan with their own radio-friendly pop hooks, Simon and Garfunkel would send a score of singles up the charts, including “The Sounds of Silence,” “The Boxer,” “Mrs. Robinson,” “The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin’ Groovy), “the traditional “Scarborough Fair/Canticle, “and “Bridge over Troubled Waters.” They won five Grammy awards in 1969 and 1970. Their vocal harmonies were peerless, but their partnership became rocky; Simon felt his musical ambition was hampered by Garfunkel’s conservatism and acting aspirations. The pair split in 1971. They would reunite occasionally, however—as on Simon’s “My Little Town, “various Garfunkel projects, and a couple of extremely successful live engagements—and in 1990 would be inducted jointly into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nGoing Solo\n\n” Going solo was my decision, “Simon pointed out in a Time magazine profile. “But I was nervous about it.” He was met with profound skepticism from industry types who were loath to part with the duo’s proven formula, yet he persevered. “I thought, if Simon and Garfunkel is all about the voices and not the songs, so much for my career,” he remembered in Newsweek.” But if it’s about the songs as well as the voices, then I was going to be fine.”\n\nHe needn’t have worried; he proceeded to score hits throughout the 1970s, including “Mother and Child Reunion,” “Me and Julio down by the Schoolyard,” “Kodachrome,” “Slip Slidin’ Away,” “Loves Me Like a Rock,” “50 Ways to Leave Your Lover, “and many others. His 1975 disc, Still Crazy after All These Years, took a best album Grammy; in 1977 he won an Emmy award for a TV special. Noted modern composer Phillip Glass, interviewed in Life, called Simon “a great artist, “adding, “Yes—why not? The only music that counts is the music we love, the records in our collections that keep coming to the top. And for a quarter century now, Paul has generated a tremendous amount of music we love.”\n\nBut Simon’s ambitions weren’t limited to songwriting. He was a frequent host of Saturday Night Live, once lampooning his sincere image by donning a turkey suit for a Thanksgiving episode and crooning his way, deadpan, through “Still Crazy.” His friend Woody Allen cast him—comically—as a slick L.A. show biz figure in the 1977 film Annie Hall, and 1980 saw the release of One-Trick Pony, a semi-autobiographical feature written by and starring Simon. Of course, he also wrote and performed the songs on the soundtrack.\n\nAs the 1980s dawned, Simon reunited with Garfunkel for a concert in New York’s Central Park, the recording of which sold vigorously upon its release in 1981. His personal life was less rosy; he divorced his first wife, Peggy Harper, in 1975, then married actress-writer Carrie Fisher in 1983. That union foundered within a year. The dissolution of this marriage coincided with Simon’s least commercially successful album (and his first for Warner Bros.), Hearts and Bones. Many prophesied the end of his career.\n\nGraceland\n\nYet in 1986, Simon—after traveling to South Africa and working with a large group of musicians there and at home—emerged with Graceland, a pop album at once epic and personal. The record filtered a panoply of styles, including South African township jive, zydeco, and rock, through Simon’s distinctive lyrical perspective. It garnered rave reviews; Life’s Scherman quoted a New York Times critic who called it “an album-length song cycle that far transcends the normal pop record for complexity and richness.”\n\nAmong the guest artists on the record were the South African vocal group Ladysmith Black Mambazo, L.A. rockers Los Lobos, pop diva Linda Ronstadt, and guitar experimentalist Adrian Belew. The title song refers to the Memphis, Tennessee, home of rock idol Elvis Presley as though it were a haven for the weary faithful: “I have reason to believe, “Simon sings, “we all will be received in Graceland.” The album snagged a Grammy for best album; the single “You Can Call Me Al” was among the hits that took Graceland past the ten million sales mark. Simon later wrote a piece for Musician magazine about the process of writing “Al”: “At its best,” he concluded, “songwriting for me means peeling back layers. It’s discovery, and that’s the truth.”\n\nSimon’s path to musical discovery, however, was also something of a mine field. Many political activists objected to his work in South Africa, since that country at the time was in thrall to a system of racial inequality known as apartheid and was thus being boycotted by artists around the world. They argued that Simon, as a rich white musician, was exploiting oppressed Third World musicians and doing nothing about their plight. Even worse, these critics maintained, he used their musical styles merely to sing about his own life. His attempts to explain himself rarely assuaged such attacks. “I suppose someone could say,’Well, that’s very nice for you, Paul Simon, and congratulations. But there’s a whole suffering continent there.’ Which is valid,” he reflected in Life.” But my answer is,’Was I supposed to solve things in a song?” ’ Furthermore, the bridges that Simon built with African musicians have had their own impact; the leader of Ladysmith Black Mambazo gave him the Zulu name Vutlendela, “the man who opened the door.”\n\nSimon’s work on Graceland altered his songwriting process. A new emphasis on rhythm was particularly evident, and this continued on his 1990 follow-up, The Rhythm of the Saints. Born of his work with Brazilian musicians and requiring $1 million and 2 years to complete, Rhythm was a trickier beast than Graceland; though it sold some four million copies, it was less than a smashing success when compared to its predecessor. “The world hasn’t gotten it yet,” he averred to Scherman some three years after the album’s release. “It’s taking a while for people to realize that it’s more interesting than Graceland.” More interesting, perhaps, but less sunny: “There are aspects of my personal life and my family’s personal life that are more grave than they were four years ago,” he noted in a Time interview. “And that’s in there. It was on my mind, it had to be in there.”\n\nBy 1993, the various strands of Simon’s career began to look less like detours and more like parts of a cohesive musical vision. This was demonstrated in part by the valedictory three-disc boxed set Paul Simon, 1964/1993 and a performance on the popular acoustic showcase MTV Unplugged, but also by a series of mammoth stage shows billed as “The Concert Event of a Lifetime” and featuring Garfunkel, Ladysmith, a coterie of Brazilian musicians, and even a cameo by comedian Steve Martin. Audiences at these concerts saw Simon run through everything from “Feelin’ Groovy” to revamped material from Graceland and Rhythm. The perceptive among them also saw the elements in his early work that prefigured his Third World wandering. Simon, observed composer-producer Quincy Jones to Newsweek, is “smart enough to understand the African motor, which has driven pop music for so long.”\n\nLife on the home front had stabilized a bit in the meantime. Simon married singer-songwriter Edie Brickell, and the two had a child in 1993. He built a studio in his Manhattan home and continued exploring new ground. “I’m at the peak of my career,” he insisted to Scherman. “In terms of creativity, in terms of fame, in terms of drawing power, in terms of—you just name anything.” Simon next undertook a collaboration with acclaimed poet Derek Walcott on a musical, The Cape Man. Due in 1996 and based on a true story of a teenager who murdered two 16 year-olds while wearing a nurse’s cape, it was clear from various interviews that this new project tapped some old insecurities. Nonetheless, venturing into uncharted territory has been a key source of Simon’s continued vitality as an artist. “The thing that happens to musicians in middle age,” he mused to David Gates of Newsweek,” especially if you’ve had a lot of success, a lot of attention, is that there comes a point where you either rediscover why you love music or it just becomes slick.” For over 30 years, Simon has transformed his discoveries into musical treasures.\n\nSelected discography\n\nSimon and Garfunkel; on Columbia, except where noted\n\n(As Tom and Jerry) “Hey Schoolgirl, “Big, 1958.\n\n(As Tom and Jerry) “Don’t Say Goodbye, “Big, 1958.\n\n(As Tom and Jerry) “Our Song, “Big, 1958.\n\nWednesday Morning, 3 A.M.

Whether playful or poignant, Simon's songs are driven by agile, often sophisticated lyrics and engaging melodies. He has recovered from commercial and creative slumps by making incisive changes in his musical handiwork to remain at the forefront of the industry since the 1960s.\n\nPriming Rhymin' Simon\n\nSimon grew up in the Forest Hills section of Queens, New York, under the erudite auspices of a mother who was a schoolteacher and a college professor father with a doctorate in semantics. Louis Simon was also a jazz bassist and exposed a preteen Simon to the world of jazz; however, like many teenagers growing up in the 1950s, Simon soon became enthralled with the sound of rock and roll. In 1955 Simon and a boyhood friend from the neighborhood, Art Garfunkel, formed a singing duo called Tom and Jerry with Simon singing and playing guitar and Garfunkel accompanying vocally. The conservative political backdrop of the 1950s fueled the boys' idea to call the twosome Tom and Jerry, avoiding any possible stereotyping for their Jewish names. They broke up when Garfunkel went away to college but recorded several singles together, including \"Hey, Schoolgirl.\" Meanwhile, Simon went on to perform solo under the name Jerry Landis and scored some limited radio play with \"Lone Teen Ranger.\"\n\nSimon and Garfunkel re-formed in the early 1960s, this time under their own names, and recorded an album, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M. (1964). The album fared poorly, the duo broke up, and Simon moved to England to work solo in the growing folk scene there. Back in the United States, however, a song from Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M., \"Sound of Silence,\" had been remixed and released as a single. It gained tremendous popularity, eventually reaching number one on the charts. Simon and Garfunkel quickly regrouped and recorded their next album, Sounds of Silence (1966), which included their surprise hit in addition to Simon's folk anthem, \"I Am a Rock.\" Simon and Garfunkel recorded three more albums of Simon's songs until creative differences forced them apart in 1971 shortly after the release of Bridge Over Troubled Water (1970).\n\nGoing solo after such success with Garfunkel was perilous territory for Simon. Along with the two previously mentioned songs, their partnership had spawned radio classics including \"Homeward Bound,\" \"The Boxer,\" \"The 59th Street Bridge Song,\" \"Mrs. Robinson,\" and \"Scarborough Fair/Canticle\"—all written by Simon. The duo won five Grammy Awards, and their work was later acknowledged with an induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 and with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2003 Grammy Awards. Nevertheless, Simon's first solo album after the breakup, Paul Simon (1972), went platinum and started a string of successful releases and major hits throughout the 1970s.\n\nSome of Simon's best-known hits include \"Kodachrome,\" \"Slip Slidin' Away,\" \"Still Crazy After All These Years,\" \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,\" and \"Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard\" and earned him the tag \"Rhymin' Simon.\" Along the way, he reunited with Garfunkel for special projects and appearances, most notably a concert in New York's Central Park that was released as an album. Afterward they agreed to re-form and cut a studio album but ended up disagreeing about Simon's material so it was scrapped. Most of those songs went into Simon's Hearts and Bones (1983), a spectacular album that inexplicably sold poorly. Simon had been experiencing a decline in sales since his ambitious One-Trick Pony (1980), which was a soundtrack to an autobiographical film that he scripted and starred in as an actor.\n\nExploring the World's Musical Terrain\n\nAlthough no contemporary folk/pop artist in the post–Bob Dylan era was more successful at blending poetic lyrics with catchy music to produce hits, Simon still yearned for something creatively different. In addition, he felt a change in the musical atmosphere, a greater interest in ethnic, world music. Simon traveled to South Africa and soaked up varieties of the country's rhythmic music by working with many tribal musicians. Simon placed his lyrically powered songs within this framework to produce one of the greatest triumphs in contemporary music history, Graceland (1986). The album sold more than 10 million copies within two years, and critics across the board hailed it for its musical richness. Graceland earned Simon a Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1987. However, the album also brought criticism from political groups who accused Simon of carpetbagging in the struggling third world milieu and for using their music to tell his stories. Nevertheless, Simon employed a similar strategy with his next album, The Rhythm of the Saints (1990). This time he traveled to Brazil, worked with local musicians there, and produced an album of his songs that again focused on ethnic rhythms and sounds. Although interest generated by The Rhythm of the Saints paled in comparison to Graceland, it still managed to sell 4 million copies and was a major success under any other definition of success.\n\nIn late summer of 1991, Simon, a resident of Manhattan's Upper West Side, performed (as he did with Garfunkel ten years previous) in a concert just a few blocks from his home in Central Park. The free event was attended by 750,000 people who peacefully watched Simon do selections from his deep catalog of hits. The concert was released later that year as Paul Simon's Concert in the Park (1991). Although Garfunkel was conspicuously absent from the Central Park concert, Simon teamed up with him in 1993 to perform at a variety of benefits and promote a three-CD box set retrospective of their music.\n\nIn another creative adventure, Simon began writing songs for a Broadway show concept that eventually materialized when the musical play The Capeman (1997) opened in New York at the Marquis Theatre in 1997. The play, based on a double homicide in Manhattan's Hells Kitchen district in 1959, opened up old wounds for relatives of the victims—many of whom reside within blocks of the Broadway theater district—as Simon's play cast the perpetrator in a sympathetic light. The show's songs were somewhat well received, as were the musical performances of the two leading men, Marc Anthony and Ruben Blades. However, The Capeman was marred by a poorly conceived story, terrible dialogue, and clumsy staging as Simon insisted that there be little movement or anything else to distract from his music. Only a swell of interest generated by the production's skewed view of history kept it running for as long as it did—sixty-eight performances—and it now lies in the record books as one of Broadway's biggest flops. An album of the show's songs, Songs from the Capeman (1997), performed by Simon, was released.\n\nIn 1999 Simon went on tour with a singer/songwriter of equal legend, Bob Dylan. They successfully toured throughout 1999 and into 2000, performing concerts that contained their own solo sets, which were followed by a forty-five-minute set of them playing together.\n\nSimon received a Grammy Award nomination for his ninth solo album, You're the One (2000). The album was less conceptual than his work of the 1990s and harked back to the introspective and melancholic wit of his earlier work. Simon received his second induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, this time as a solo performer. He earned one of America's grandest tributes when he was honored at the 2003 Kennedy Center Honors.\n\nAside from being one of the most important songwriters of his time, Simon is also an enchanting performer with a rich voice, and his classically influenced folk guitar style is highly revered.\n\nSELECTIVE DISCOGRAPHY:\n\nPaul Simon (Columbia, 1972); There Goes Rhymin' Simon (Columbia, 1973); Still Crazy After All These Years (Columbia, 1975); Hearts and Bones (Warner Bros., 1983); Graceland (Warner Bros., 1986); The Rhythm of the Saints (Warner Bros., 1990); Paul Simon's Concert in the Park (Warner Bros., 1991); Songs from \"The Capeman\" (Warner Bros., 1997); You're the One (Warner Bros., 2000).

Jackson, Paul Simon: The Definitive Biography of the Legendary Singer/Songwriter (New York, 2003).\n\ndonald lowe\n\nPaul Simon\n\nPaul Simon (born 1928) was a newspaper publisher, state legislator, lieutenant governor, and U.S. representative and senator, serving a total of 22 years in Congress. He was a \"self-made\" man who rose from being a \"boy-wonder\" in journalism and politics to a candidate for president of the United States.\n\nPaul Simon was born November 29, 1928, in Eugene, Oregon. His parents, the Rev. Martin Paul and Ruth (Troemel) Simon, had only recently returned to the United States from Lutheran missionary work in China so that their child could be born in America.\n\nSimon grew up in Eugene and entered the University of Oregon at age 16 to study journalism. In 1946 he transferred to Dana College in Blair, Nebraska, after his parents moved to Illinois to publish a religious periodical.\n\nAt age 19, Simon became the youngest editor-publisher in America. In 1948 he dropped out of college to purchase the Troy Tribune, a defunct weekly newspaper in a small southern Illinois town. He resurrected the paper and before long he made his reputation as a crusading journalist by exposing vice and syndicate gambling connections with local government officials. Simon eventually built a chain of 14 weekly newspapers. He sold them in 1966 to devote full time to public service, teaching, and writing.\n\nSimon served a two year hitch as an enlisted soldier in the U.S. Army between 1951 and 1953. He was assigned to the Counter Intelligence Corps and spent most of his tour of duty along the former \"Iron Curtain\" in Europe. (The term, \"Iron Curtain\" referred to the political and ideological barrier between Western Europe and the Soviet Bloc nations, which continued from the end of World War II in 1945, until 1990).\n\nReturning from service in the armed forces, Simon, a Democrat, was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1954 at the young age of 25. He was reelected in 1956, 1958, and 1960.\n\nOn April 21, 1960, he married Jeanne Hurley, an attorney and state legislator. They became the first husband and wife team to serve in the Illinois General Assembly. He and his wife wrote a book, Protestant-Catholic Marriages Can Succeed (1967), to discuss interfaith marriages such as theirs. They had two children, Sheila and Martin.\n\nSimon ran successfully for the Illinois Senate in 1962 and was reelected in 1966. He was respected as a reformer and hard worker, as seen by the record number of awards he garnered. The Independent Voters of Illinois, for example, granted him the \"Best Legislator\" award during each session he served.\n\nThe next stage of public service was reached in 1968. Simon became the lieutenant governor of Illinois. He was the first—and only—lieutenant governor to be elected with a governor of another political party. After his election, the Illinois constitution was changed to provide for the joint election of governor and lieutenant governor, thus assuring that the two office-holders would be members of the same party.\n\nSimon entered the Democratic primary for governor in 1972. He lost by a narrow margin. It was his only loss at the polls. Out of public office, Simon turned to teaching. He taught history and government at Sangamon State University in Springfield, Illinois, and lectured at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy Institute of Politics.\n\nUrged to return to public service, he focused on the national level. Simon ran for the U.S. House of Representatives from a large southern Illinois district. He was first elected in 1974 and then re-elected four times. Serving on the House Education and Labor Committee, he became one of the leading advocates of teacher and educational quality. He was a strong supporter of arms control talks and civil rights.\n\nIn 1984 Simon upset three-term Republican incumbent Charles Percy to win a seat in the U.S. Senate. As a senator, he worked on legislation to achieve arms control, to support health care for the elderly, and to promote human rights and a balanced budget. He strove to combat adult illiteracy and wrote about that in one of his many books, The Tongue-Tied American (1980). His legislative priority was a public works program that would guarantee a job to anyone who wanted to work. His eleventh book, Let's Put America Back To Work (1986), outlined his ideas for the locally run, project-oriented public programs.\n\nOn May 18, 1987, Simon announced that he would seek the nomination for president in the 1988 elections. At 58, he was the oldest announced candidate in the Democratic Party race and the one with the most electoral experience. Simon was distinguishable from the other announced contenders in both his appearance and issue stands. Dressed in the bow tie and horned-rimmed glasses that are his trademark, Simon sought to get across his image as a modern day Harry S. Truman and standard-bearer for traditional Democratic Party liberal ideas.\n\nOn the day he announced his candidacy, Simon declared his unwillingness to bend to any prevailing political winds. He stated: \"I stand here as a Democrat, not as a neo-anything, as one who is not running away from the Democratic tradition of caring and daring and dreaming.\" He emphasized willingness to use the tools of government in programs for employment, education, farmers, housing, and long-term care for senior citizens. But Simon did not fare well in the Democratic caucuses and primaries, winning only his home state of Illinois.\n\nFor the next decade, Simon maintained keen interest in the politics of elections and their financing. In 1995, along with former governor William Stratton, a Republican, Simon led the newly-created Illinois Campaign Finance Task Force. Simon retired in early 1997 after serving 22 years in Congress. He intended to return to teaching at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, Illinois, and to head a public policy institute there.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nNo biography has been written about Paul Simon. However, he has authored many works which give an understanding of his interests and positions. Simon was a newspaper columnist for 40 years and the author of 11 books, including: Lincoln's Preparation for Greatness (1965), with which he acquired a reputation as a Lincoln scholar and admirer; The Politics of World Hunger (1973), written with his brother, Arthur Simon, a Lutheran minister, to highlight the problem and press for public aid programs; The Once and Future Democrats: Strategies for Change (1981); and The Glass House: Politics and Morality in the Nation's Capital (1984), in which he explained the institutional and moral problems facing members of Congress. He also wrote: Lovejoy: Martyr to Freedom (1984), a book about Elijah Lovejoy, an abolitionist; A Hungry World (1966); You Want To Change the World? So Change It (1971); and Advice and Consent: Clarence Thomas, Robert Bork, and the Intriguing History of the Supreme Court's Nomination Battles (1992). □\n\nPaul Simon\n\nBorn Paul Martin Simon, November 29, 1928, in Eugene, OR; died after undergoing heart surgery, December 9, 2003, in Springfield, IL. United States senator. Paul Simon, who spent 12 years as a United States senator from Illinois and ran for president in 1988, earned a reputation for honesty, fiscal responsibility, and a belief that government can improve people's lives. The son of missionaries, he fought against corruption as a newspaper editor, then was elected to the Illinois legislature, where he got the nickname \"Reverend.\" His bow ties and horn-rimmed glasses became symbols of his forthrightness, helping create an image that may have hurt his presidential campaign but brought him immense respect. \"I never served with anybody else who voted his conscience every time,\" Dale Bumpers (D-Arkansas), another former senator, told the New York Times.\n\nSimon was born on November 29, 1928, to Reverend Martin and Ruth Simon. Both Lutheran missionaries, they had returned from China and settled in Eugene, Oregon, while Ruth was pregnant. They instilled a social conscience in their son. Later in life, Simon recalled his father opposing the internment of Japanese Americans on the West Coast during World War II, an unpopular stance that embarrassed his teenage son, though he later decided his father was right.\n\nSimon enrolled in the University of Oregon at age 16, then transferred to Dana College in Nebraska, about the same time his parents moved to Illinois. He was elected Dana College's student body president and helped create a racially integrated admissions policy for the school. He left college at 19 when the Lions Club of Troy, Illinois, convinced him to buy the town newspaper and use it to fight local gambling interests. He exposed illegal casinos and brothels, and testified before the Senate Crime Investigating Committee in 1951. Though the gambling rings had bought off legislators in both political parties, reformers in the Democratic Party convinced Simon to run for the Illinois House in 1954.\n\nHe won a seat in the House, and joined with other reformers to pass an open meetings law and rewrite adoption and penal laws. He released his personal financial records to prove his honesty, long before it was common for politicians to do so. He married a fellow legislator, Jeanne Hurley of Wilmette, in 1960, and they went to the Democratic National Convention for their honeymoon.\n\nIn 1964, Simon wrote \"A Study In Corruption,\" an article for Harper's magazine, that alleged several fellow Illinois legislators were bought off by organized crime and the racing industry or extorted bribes from special interest groups. That made him a lot of enemies in the legislature—but he had powerful friends, too. Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago helped Simon become the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor in 1968, and he won. But when he tried to move up to governor in 1972, he lost in the Democratic primary after being attacked for his tax reform plan, which would have raised one tax while cutting another. He bounced back quickly, though: after spending some time teaching journalism, he ran for U.S. Congress in 1974 and won.\n\nAmong his fellow congressmen, Simon was not very popular; he finished third when he ran for chairman of the House Budget Committee. But he spoke out on education issues such as literacy programs and college loans and championed political morality. \"The path upwards in politics is a slippery, stumbling one for both the officeholder and the public,\" he wrote in his 1984 book, The Glass House, according to Ray Long in the Chicago Tribune. \"But unless there are those willing to tread the slippery path, willing to stumble, willing to expose themselves, warts and all, willing to give the nation something good and noble toward which to strive, we will follow the downward path .\"\n\nIn 1984, he became a star in the Democratic Party when he challenged incumbent Illinois Republican senator Charles Percy and won—in a year that brought a Republican landslide in most of the country. In the Senate, he was a strong liberal, believing in government social programs. \"Government is not the enemy,\" Simon said, according to CNN.com. \"Government is simply a tool that can be used wisely or unwisely.\" But he also supported a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution at a time when many liberal Democrats felt that eliminating the country's large budget deficit would keep them from providing enough social spending.\n\nSimon took that mix of government activism and pay-as-you-go caution into the 1988 presidential race, where he failed to excite people. He did fairly well in the early Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary, but the only primary he won was in his home state, and he dropped out, short on campaign money. During the campaign, his bow tie and proper manner seemed to attract the most attention, and he played with his public image, appearing on the TV show Saturday Night Live with the singer Paul Simon in a comedy routine where both pretended to be confused about who was supposed to be the guest host.\n\nAfter leaving the presidential race, Simon continued his work in the Senate for eight more years, winning reelection easily in 1990. He kept supporting a balanced-budget amendment and the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nWhen Simon retired in 1996, almost every member of the Senate, including conservatives, wore a bow tie in tribute to him. Dick Durbin, a fellow Democrat and former aide of Simon's, succeeded him in the Senate. Simon became director of a public policy institute named after himself at Southern Illinois University. During his life he wrote 22 books, including his autobiography which was published in 1999. His first wife, Jeanne, died in 2000, and he married Patricia Derge, a former high school government teacher, in 2001.\n\nIn early December of 2003, Simon endorsed presidential candidate Howard Dean—another fiscally responsible liberal—from his hospital bed in Spring-field, Illinois, just before undergoing heart surgery. He died on December 9, 2003, due to complications from the surgery.
