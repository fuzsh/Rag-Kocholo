He and his school friend Garfunkel, whom he met in 1953, came to prominence in the 1960s as Simon & Garfunkel. Their blend of folk and rock, including hits such as \"The Sound of Silence\", \"Mrs. Robinson\", \"America\" and \"The Boxer\", served as a soundtrack to the counterculture movement. Their final album, Bridge Over Troubled Water (1970), is among the bestselling of all time.\n\nQuick Facts Background information, Birth name ...\n\nClose\n\nAs a solo artist, Simon has explored genres including gospel, reggae and soul. His albums Paul Simon (1972), There Goes Rhymin' Simon (1973), and Still Crazy After All These Years (1975) kept him in the public eye and drew acclaim, producing the hits \"Mother and Child Reunion\", \"Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard\", and \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\". Simon reunited with Garfunkel for several tours and the 1981 Concert in Central Park.\n\nIn 1986, Simon released his most successful and acclaimed album, Graceland, incorporating South African influences. \"You Can Call Me Al\" became one of Simon's most successful singles. Graceland was followed by The Rhythm of the Saints (1990), and a second Concert in the Park in 1991, without Garfunkel, which was attended by half a million people. In 1998, Simon wrote a Broadway musical, The Capeman, which was poorly received. In the 21st century, Simon continued to record and tour. His later albums, such as You're the One (2000), So Beautiful or So What (2011) and Stranger to Stranger (2016), introduced him to new generations. Simon retired from touring in 2018, but continued to record music. An album, Seven Psalms, was released in May 2023.[1]"
