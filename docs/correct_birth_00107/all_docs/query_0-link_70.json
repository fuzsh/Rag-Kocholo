        "text": "Singer-songwriter Paul Simon has worked most of his career as a solo artist and yet, despite his many individual accomplishments, may always be best remembered for his collaboration with Art Garfunkel. The two discovered early on, as fellow Forest Hills, NY sixth graders, that they harmonized well. Although Simon was always the creative force powering the pair, it was Garfunkel's distinctive harmonies that were the group's \"hook.\" In 1957, they recorded Simon's song \"Hey, Schoolgirl\" and billed as 'Tom and Jerry' had a Top Fifty hit, leading to an appearance on \"American Bandstand.\" When subsequent 'Tom and Jerry' records failed to capture an audience, the two drifted apart, both trying unsuccessfully to establish themselves independently before reuniting and releasing (as Simon and Garfunkel) the LP \"Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.\" (1964). The following year, a remixed version of \"The Sounds of Silence,\" adding electric guitar, bass and drums to Simon's acoustic guitar, became the Number 1 single in the United States and launched them in earnest."
