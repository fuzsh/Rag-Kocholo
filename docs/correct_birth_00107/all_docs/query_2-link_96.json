        "text": "October 3, 2019\n\nI can clearly remember the first time I heard Paul Simon. To my six-year-old brain, the video for You Can Call Me Al was one of the funniest things I'd ever seen. And the song wasn't half bad either. When I was sixteen, I found Simon & Garfunkel's Greatest Hits among my cousin's vinyl collection and played it to death. The angelic harmonies and poetic lyrics were like nothing I had heard before. A couple of years later I bought Graceland on CD and it opened my mind to a whole new world of African rhythms.\n\nI feel like Simon's songs have been a soundtrack to my life so I wanted to learn more about the man behind the music. Esteemed critic Robert Hilburn has set out to write the definitive biography of one of America's greatest songwriters. He has spoken to several of the key players in Simon's career and spent over 100 hours talking to the artist himself.\n\nThe story begins with Simon's contented childhood. In those days he was more interested in baseball than music, and he was a decent player by all accounts, but his height prevented him from going any further down that road. He began to notice certain songs on the radio and dedicated several hours learning them on his guitar. In a happy twist of fate, the family moved to a house two blocks from the Garfunkels. Paul and Art soon realised that they had a unique musical chemistry. They initially had some minor chart success as Tom and Jerry but that venture fizzled out. Paul went to England and began to hone his craft. By the time he returned, his songwriting had jumped to a whole new level. Back home in New York, he recorded these new tracks with Art - Homeward Bound and I Am a Rock became chart hits and the duo were catapulted to stardom.\n\nSimon has had a tumultuous relationship with Garfunkel over the years and I was eager to find out more about this friction. Hilburn believes the resentment has always been present on Garfunkel's side, jealous that his partner took most of the glory for writing the songs. For his part, Simon was angry when Garfunkel decided to pursue a movie career without telling him, and this was what caused the pair to split in the first place. They have reunited several times for tours, but it feels like an argument is never far from breaking out.\n\nOf course, Simon has had a very successful solo career without his old pal Artie. Hilburn explores it in great detail, describing his inspiration for each album and the recording process involved. The 70s were a very fruitful period, There Goes Rhymin' Simon and Still Crazy After All These Years being commercial and critical hits. However, it was on 1986's Graceland that Simon reached his creative peak. Introduced to South African music by a friend, he travelled to the country to collaborate with local musicians and record an album there. It was a big risk - South Africa was in the grip of apartheid and Simon was criticised by other artists for violating a cultural boycott. But Graceland turned out to be huge success worldwide and cemented Simon's reputation as a musical and lyrical genius.\n\nSo what kind of a person is Paul Simon? A friend from his days in England describes him as \"paradoxical: charming, courteous, shy, arrogant, self-assured, ruthlessly determined.\" He could be aloof and opinionated, and his ego sometimes took over. But he was also very charismatic and kind - he has raised so much money for charity over the years and always been generous in crediting his collaborators. As a husband he was at times distant and preoccupied - music took first place in his list of priorities. However he seems to have found stability and true happiness with his third wife Edie Brickell.\n\nIt's a fascinating read overall. There is enough detail and juicy gossip to satisfy the most ardent Simon fan. I particularly enjoyed the chapters about Graceland, my favourite album of his. A significant portion of the book is dedicated to the fourth phase of his career (projects like So Beautiful or So What and Stranger to Stranger) and I was less enamoured with this section, but that's down to my own personal taste. Paul Simon: The Life is an absorbing, worthy portrait of a uniquely gifted songwriter.\n\nMay 6, 2018\n\nIt’s better than any other biography of Simon, but that is damning with the faintest of praise because they have all sucked. The access to Simon doesn’t bring any revelations or insights; it only brings the fear of lack of access.\n\nIf you watched the documentary about the making of Graceland, the overwhelming arrogance of Simon jumps off the screen. Dali Tambo repeatedly calls him on how he was out of line in his approach to recording in South Africa. Simon would have nothing of it; it’s pretty hard to watch. How Hilburn resolves this is really beneath him; he calls it a draw because he is afraid to call a spade a spade.\n\nIn the past two years, there have been several books written that mentioned Simon in a horrible light; his insensitive interaction with Karen Carpenter, and playing the ‘Don’t you know who I am?’ card many times. No mention of it here; his arrogance is explained away because great artists have to be focused. I call BS.\n\nBut I can’t think of an album I enjoy more than Graceland, and some of Simon and Garfunkel is the very best of the 60’s. I still love his music. You have some hope for some inner peace at the end for him, but all I could think of is that I wished the same for the many people he encountered who experienced only his unkindness.\n\nFebruary 1, 2019\n\nThe music of Paul Simon is something that has always been in my life. To wit: my parents have said more than once that as a toddler (circa '76) there were a few songs that made me dance around with joy when they came on the FM radio; one was 'The Rubberband Man' by the Spinners, and the other was Simon's rhyming (like a Sesame Street skit) and snare drum-heavy '50 Ways to Leave Your Lover.' Going into high school and college I began listening to Simon & Garfunkel's vaunted catalog (as well as the Beatles and Johnny Cash - notably, these acts all involved strong songwriters), because it was nice change of pace from the grunge and heavy metal on the airwaves and in CD bins at the time.\n\nSo when author Robert Hilburn (who also penned the great Johnny Cash: The Life five years ago - much recommended) recently released his biographical take on Simon it seemed like a 'sure thing.' And the book is detailed and well-written - Hilburn interviewed Simon over the course of a year, but retained full control editorial control over final content, so it's not whitewashed - and details the singer/songwriter's storied career. However, on the drama meter (for lack of a better term) Simon's home and work life have been fairly stable - other than a few marriages, and his on-and-off again strained musical partnership with Art Garfunkel - so if a reader is looking for a degree of juiciness it is in short supply here. However, is it a decent music-related bio - Hilburn deftly covers both the inspiration and production behind many of Simon's best-known songs - and it deserves to share shelf space alongside the other works on the great American and British acts from the 60's and 70's.\n\nSeptember 2, 2018\n\nPaul Simon gave Robert Hilburn free access to his life and associates and told him: “It’s your book”. The result is a thorough documentation of Simon’s career. The book spans 7 decades; hence, this is a big report. While there is informed critique of the music, the story of the person is like a reference book.\n\nSimon is preceded by two (known) generations of musicians. The influence of the Everly Brothers shows in his early work with Art Garfunkel and his homage to Elvis is enshrined in a mid-career album. I found it interesting how his career began in England and while having a #1 single in the US, his agent had trouble landing bookings.\n\nSimon’s body of work is fully saluted with back stories and credits to the changing supporting crews of managers and performers. The writer feels Simon's position is supreme among contemporary singer songwriters, particularly for his daring to switch genre despite a risky commercial outlook. While Hilburn notes other singer songwriters, he gives nary a mention to Joni Mitchell whose career runs parallel and has tackled tough content, changed styles and has also taken risks.\n\nHilburn keeps a neutral tone about the innuendo that follows Simon. From the facts you can see how Simon had to leave Garfunkel, an initial source of the negatives. You also see Simon’s side of this and for other sources of criticism, such as the South African performance boycott, his musical about a murder which was painful for the victims’ families and the general change of personnel in his career. We don’t know what to make of the police call for what could be domestic violence and perhaps a staged marriage re-avowal.\n\nThis might be considered a blueprint book for another writer to take this to the next level.\n\nJanuary 3, 2019\n\nOh, I love Paul Simon. But this book seemed pretty general and to only skim the surface. Also, I know the lyrics you don’t have to print entire song lyrics in the book.\n\nMay 8, 2018\n\nFirst off, I am a huge Paul Simon fan. During my moody adolescence I discovered Simon and Garfunkel and they seemed to soothe my tortured soul. I mean \"Hello darkness, my old friend...\" They got me. By the time I discovered them, they had broken up (mostly) so I had to rely on their back catalogue for material to listen to. Also, and I am dating myself here, this was well before the days of music streaming and the internet. So I had to rely on the good old record store to get my material and find out what was available. As I moved from moody teen to less moody adult (ish) I really got into Paul Simon's solo stuff. His songs spoke to me and helped me feel less alone and that someone out there understood me. For me, the lyrics he wrote got to the heart of the human existence. The line that stands out for me is from \"Slip Slidin' Away\"\n\nShe said, “A good day\n\nAin’t got no rain”\n\nShe said, “A bad day’s when I lie in bed\n\nAnd think of things that might have been”\n\nThat line got me hooked. And as I have aged it has stuck with me and gets truer and truer the older I get.\n\nSo, the book...\n\nHaving grown up in the pre-internet age, my knowledge of Paul Simon was limited to articles and what I saw on TV, and obviously got through his music. When I saw there was a book about him, I jumped at the chance to read it.\n\nI will say, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I knew the main events of his life, but didn't know much in depth of what he was about and how his writing process worked. Although Mr. Simon wasn't directly involved in writing the book, the author used many hours of interviews with him, and people close to him. The author's previous subjects: Springsteen, Johnny Cash and John Lennon lends some credibility.\n\nI don't think there is going to be anything in this book that shocks anyone. There are no gossipy insights into his relationships, which I appreciate. What there is, is an attempt to understand the man and what shaped him into becoming one of the most prolific American songwriters of our time. The portrait isn't always flattering. For me, it feels honest and not as if the author ever gushes or paints over Mr. Simon's flaws.\n\nThe section that speaks to the controversy around the Graceland album and recording with South African artists was of particular interest to me. I was a huge fan of that album and was aware of the issues facing him and the public opinion around him at that time. I was lucky enough to see one of the Graceland concerts and it was one of the coolest concert experiences I have had. (The other being Simon and Garfunkel reuniting for a benefit concert and sobbing while they sang Bridge Over Troubled Water.)\n\nI am always hesitant to read books about artists I really like. I am afraid that it will take away somehow from my love of their art. This was not the case with this book. I feel like I have an even better insight and love for the artistry and depth of Paul Simon's work.\n\nFull disclosure: I received this eARC from NetGalley for a fair and honest review. (Thanks NetGalley!)\n\nJuly 28, 2021\n\nWhen I started this book, I was a bigger Paul Simon fan than when I finished it. I got the impression from this book that even though Hilburn is obviously a good writer and knows a lot about music there something missing in this book. It feels like Hilburn obviously admires Paul Simon, but that admiration seems to temper any criticism he has of Simon. Simon has always been a deeply private man but if you want insight into Paul Simon the man, there is not much here. What I gather from reading this biography is that Simon's most visible personality traits is his ego and the propulsive pursuit of his art. He learnt early from his competitive father, a successful bandleader, who told him that \"music was something to be treated with respect\". Simon made sure that others gave him respect. His relationship with Art Garfunkel is glossed over with handful of anecdotes across the decades. It was much more than a misunderstanding. Simon didn't tell Garfunkel of his plans to record songs as a solo artist. Garfunkel felt betrayed, something it seems that he never really got over. I got the feeling that there is more to this story because S&G are still not on speaking terms. So whatever the truth is we will never know because Artie refuses to be interviewed about this problem. It really is a shame because the songs we all have come to listen to is the result of Artie's great voice. There are other biographies out on Paul Simon but this is the only biography of Paul Simon that he authorized according to the publisher. One wonders why he bothered.\n\nJune 6, 2018\n\nWhat a sterile book! This was an extended liner note, with little to offer other than basic facts.\n\nJune 18, 2019\n\nI think one of the main reasons I gave this 5 stars is that it shines in comparison with the last \"rock legend\" biography that I read on Jimmy Buffet which was pretty terrible. This one corrects the faults of that one and is an enjoyable, well organized and entertaining read.\n\nAnother reason for me to give this a 5 is that I admire Paul's music and creativity. Granted, I would find it hard to work with someone who can be overbearing, sensitive, prickly and nit picky as he often is but taking a listen to the end result probably means it is worth the suffering. He did go up dramatically in my esteem when his movie production turned out to be a bust, he gave the studio a $1 million to make up for their losses despite being under no obligation to do so. He also cut one of his business managers a check for $100,000 for arranging a profitable performance. The manager protested that he had done nothing but make a phone call but Paul, in recognition of the relationship pressed him to keep it. That type of generosity and integrity is too rare in the world of business today.\n\nI enjoyed reading the ins and outs of the business if only to be glad I am not in it and found the details of his off and on again relationships with Art Garfunkel and Carrie Fischer to be quite revealing.\n\nFolks in other reviews criticized the inclusion of many of his song lyrics - \"we already know them\" but I found that in the context of this biography they added a lot. If only to get the tunes going in your head as you read.\n\nOctober 16, 2021\n\nPaul\n\nIk kan er niet aan doen, je eerste albums zijn de beste & ik heb een zwak voor Artie zijn stem.\n\nJuly 13, 2018\n\nI'm listening to a live version of \"My Little Town\" right now because reading this reminded me how much I love that song.........and about 800 other Paul Simon songs. Anyone reading this review has probably recorded \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" so you wouldn't forget that, but when did you last hear \"Mother and Child Reunion\" or \"Kodachrome\" or \"One Man's Ceiling is Another Man's Floor\" or...........\n\nanyway, enjoying someone's music doesn't mean you have to like reading an \"authorized\" bio of him that glibly takes his side in all the various controversies [ex-wives, Art Garfunkel, record label folks, Miami Steve and others who objected to Simon's playing in South Africa during UN antiapartheid boycott, cultural appropriation watchdogs who took exception to Graceland, vicious critics of self-indulgent late-career Broadway play, you're all coming out on the short end in this book -- sorry].\n\nI lived in Los Angeles in the 1980s and got a regular dose of the author's music criticism in the LA Times -- the endless fawning over Maria McKee of Lone Justice, the \"Big Country is the new U2\" proclamations, etc. etc. I gather from the list that pops up when i plug his name into goodreads search engine that he's now done a number of musician bio books. This one does not motivate me to seek out the others\n\nin fairness, i did learn a little i hadn't known previously, ex: that Paul Simon for all his artistic genius was not above being quite concerned about record sales and Grammy nominations. But for the most part I'd recommend that you invest your time in listening to the 5-star music he put out rather than slogging through this book.\n\nJune 11, 2018\n\nThe first criteria for a great read to me is \"could I put this book down?\" This is one I definitely could not....plowed through in about eight hours. I wouldn't say I was a huge Simon & Garfunkel or Paul Simon fan although I do own several S&G and Simon solo works (70's & 80's only). I found that Hilburn's complete access to Simon over 100 hours of taped interviews gave great insight into Simon's songwriting & recording process over several decades which is what most interests me. He clearly is one of the best American songwriters of all time (Rock 'n Roll HOF for both S&G and as a solo artist, Songwriter's HOF, Gershwin Award). His constant search for inspiration in new sounds led him from Everly Brothers inspired rock 'n roll, folk, folk rock, gospel, Latin, Reggae/Ska and finally to the masterpieces of \"Graceland\" (South African and a sampling of Cajun) and \"Rhythm of the Saints\" (Afro-Brazilian-Caribbean) While reading I was listening to or sampling virtually all of his recordings going back to 1957 (thank you, Spotify & YouTube) which really added to the experience, especially for those albums with which I was less familiar. I was reminded of his greatness as a creator of compelling music with an almost unmatched lyricism.\n\nYou have to read this as the authorized biography that is....the autobiography that Simon deliberately chose not to write himself. I've found that rock star autobiographies are terribly uneven and often self-serving. But, you also won't find a lot of criticism here...which was fine by me in this case. Highly recommended.\n\nJune 19, 2018\n\nPaul Simon's words and music have been a part of my listening experiences since I was a young teen. He'd always impressed me as someone with the soul of a poet; a serious and driven human being.\n\nIn this biography, I found my intuitions validated and learned so much more about the individual and his art along the way. While Hilburn wors diligently at separating fact from the fiction that often surrounds the rich and famous, he does so in a way that remains interesting to the reader.\n\nNovember 11, 2018\n\nAlleen voor de echte fan is dit een aanrader. Andere lezers zou ik dit boek niet durven aan te bevelen. Er zitten een paar mooie anekdotes in (over de talloze ruzietjes tussen Paul Simon & Art Garfunkel en zijn mislukte projecten (One trick pony, The Capeman)). Maar het is allemaal niet genoeg om deze biografie hetzelfde kaliber te geven als de liedjes en teksten van deze grote kleine man van de popmuziek.\n\nJune 3, 2018\n\nEvery generation throws a hero up the pop charts, but not all of them should get a biography. Good on Hilburn for doing his best with a difficult subject, but Paul's guardedness means you could probably capture the dramatic arc of the book in a tweet: Queens boy writes superlative music, his record label is skeptical, he fights with Artie, he writes more superlative music.\n\nMay 27, 2018\n\nA well-documented look at Simon's artistic life, and the first authorized book on the musician. Simon's cooperation with Hilburn somewhat ensures that many of the stories told here - feuds with Garfunkel, the Graceland/South Africa controversies, the possible slighting of Los Lobos - are shown from a viewpoint that favors Simon. (Read Peter Ames Carlin's \"Homeward Bound\" for a somewhat more critical take on Simon). I'm sure the truth lies somewhere in between the two biographies.\n\nThe anecdotes are fascinating, and there are insights as to many of Simon's artistic and lyrical decisions on songs throughout his career. Hilburn chronicles the fear and freedom of embarking on his own after splitting with Garfunkel, the disappointments of One Trick Pony, Think Too Much, and The Capeman, and the triumphs (and challenges) around Graceland, Rhythm of the Saints, and his 70's output. If there's a disappointment (and it's a personal one, as many readers may not care), it's that two of his better albums of recent years (2006's Surprise and 2012's So Beautiful Or So What) receive lighter analysis here, though both show the musician and lyricist at the top of his game.\n\nStill, this is a solid overview of Simon, and a reminder that this often overlooked troubadour is one of our greatest national treasures, with perhaps only Bob Dylan making greater contributions to the poetics of popular music in the 20th century.\n\nJune 23, 2018\n\nPaul Simon is creeping close to 80 years old (remember his lyric in Old Friends? \"How terribly strange to be seventy\") and he finally relented to an authorized biography. Hilburn does an admirable job of interviewing the often testy Simon and also does a great job of researching past interviews and articles. It's clear that Simon is one of the best songwriters of our time and is often described as a genius. As with other genius writers (see my review of the latest Joni Mitchell bio) Simon is often described as difficult and testy. One wonders if Hilburn had to treat his subject with kid gloves? He does delve into some of his less savory qualities but I wondered where the Garfunkel interviews were. Their relationship was especially fractious. Within a two page span Simon is described as \"lacking loyalty\" \"pretentious and self-important\" and \"cerebral and passionate.\" Others describe him as kind and incredibly generous and very insecure. He does seem to have many close, long-term friends so I imagine the truth is somewhere in between. Anyway, the book was well-written and I appreciated some of the chapters that included lyrics that I had forgotten over the years. Simon (and Garfunkel) were a huge part of my younger days and the music has stood the test of time. An enjoyable read.\n\nJune 4, 2018\n\nSimon’s story is not spectacular. But his music is beyond spectacular, it’s legendary. Unlike so many popular artists, he never stopped growing, and never turned back. Look at what he did with Graceland and The Rhythm of The Saints albums - the risks he took were fantastically rewarded, both critically and commercially. Other risks - Capeman on Broadway - were failures, but still had musical value and integrity. His last four albums, though not as popular, maintain the freshness of a songwriter who will not quit creating anew.\n\nI finally saw Paul Simon live in 2017 and he, with his diverse band of musicians, literally stole my breath away. And, whether we’ve seen or heard the last of him - his shows or new work - his catalog of greatness will forever remain for us. Thank you, Paul. And thanks to this author for giving us a glimpse into this very private man - a genius for all time.\n\nSeptember 3, 2018\n\nAn INSANE amount of details about the publishing/business/$/boring? side of Simon's life, but an AMAZING amount of insight into the creative process of one of our greatest songwriters, and one who is typically unwilling to talk to would-be biographers about what happens inside his mind & heart to make music happen.\n\nAugust 29, 2018\n\nAn in depth look into the somewhat complex life of the one of the greatest American songwriters of all time. The first piece of Pop music I ever owned was an 8-track tape of \"There Goes Rhymin' Simon.\" The song Kodachrome is in my bloodstream.\n\nApril 25, 2021\n\nI picked this up in a bargain outlet bin mostly on a whim. While quite familiar with his music and aware that he was the songwriter for the Simon & Garfunkel catalog of music, this biography filled in much that I had no idea about. I saw him in concert probably 20 years ago and while the songs were good, I found him an uninspired performer. This sort of turned me off of him as an artist. But I learned in this biography that he considered himself much more of a songwriter than a \"showman.\" And to be fair, his inspiring catalog of music is likely familiar to most Americans and much of the world.\n\nThe book did a great job of education on this complex and talented man. I found it well-written, with a logical flow and comprehensive in it's coverage of Paul Simon's life. My biggest criticism is it's a bit of a hagiography, comparing Simon favorably to artists like Paul McCartney, James Taylor, Bob Dylan and others. While I would certainly include him in the group, I struggle to place him above them. But all in all, an excellent biography.\n\nNovember 15, 2020\n\nThis is an interesting look at the life and songs of Paul Simon. I loved his music when I was in high school. Bridge Over Troubled Water, The Sound of Silence, and then later works, Still Crazy After All These Years and Graceland.\n\nI vividly remember singing along with Paul and Art Garfunkel. Sadly, as with many musical teams, there comes a time when they split. Better alone than as a pair, perhaps. But, I also liked their individuality. I remember hearing Art Garfunkel's incredible voice, and temporarily thinking he had the better voice.\n\nPaul suffered through drugs, depression, fights with Art, marriages that came and went too soon. I enjoyed the book as I always liked his music.\n\nToward the end, I grew weary and found it difficult to continue to read.\n\nStill, I would recommend this book if you appreciate wonderful lyrics and beautiful music accompanying the soul-filled songs\n\nMarch 27, 2019\n\nIt is now over fifty years since I bought the sheet music for 'Homeward Bound' so I could learn to play the song on my guitar. (No YouTube/Internet in the mid 60's) My record/cassette/cd collection has always included 'Wednesday Morning 3am', 'Parsley, Sage', 'Bookends', Bridge over Troubled Water' and 'Graceland'. Having said that, I've never been really interested in any biography of either Simon or Garfunkel.\n\nRobert Hilburn's 2018 publication was informative and enjoyable in providing details of Paul Simon's early life and career in the music business, occupying the first half of the book. I found my interest waning in the latter half of this biography and the latter decades of Simon's work. How terribly strange to be seventy!\n\nMay 10, 2019\n\nThe first half was good reading and brought to me a younger side of Paul that made it easy to identify with him. The second half was a drag. Too much time interrupting his lyrics. There in all those words were some that were interesting insights to his creative process. Paul, like most of my musical heroes, was one generation older than me. I love all the Simon and Garfunkle catalog. My favorite Simon solo work was Graceland. How terribly strange to be seventy.\n\nRead\n\nApril 5, 2019\n\nI ended up not finishing this. Paul Simon is a terrific musician and a super boring person.\n\nJuly 12, 2021\n\nA very solid bio on a rather private Paul Simon from interviews stretching over five years and 600 hours of recordings by the author Hilburn with Simon.\n\nWe learn about Simon's upbringing, love of the Yankees, eventual friendship with Art Garfunkel, their career, and Simon's solo career in great depth.\n\nThe case can be made that Simon is perhaps the most global of American songwriters given his songs using world musicians and how he has touched on social and political issues within those songs.\n\nJune 11, 2018\n\nA workmanlike job of reviewing Paul Simon's career. Though given 100 hours of access to Paul Simon, as well as most of those in his life, there aren't a lot of insights here. We get a pretty thorough review of his quarrels with Garfunkel and a close look at the composition of some of his best known songs. Enjoyable, but not revealing.\n\nJuly 2, 2019\n\nI want to state up front that I have never been a fan of Robert Hilburn's writing. Hilburn was the pop music critic for many, many years in the Los Angeles Times and since I grew up here, I read him a lot. I just never found him very interesting. Unfortunately I found him similarly uninteresting here.\n\nSimon is clearly a great songwriter, as evidenced by his body of work. Hilburn does delve into the songwriting process and some of the stories behind the Simon's songs, but just fails to make it very compelling.\n\nThe book is definitely Simon's story, and while Hilburn might have had access to Simon and his friends and colleagues, most stories are told to make Simon out as the hero. The person who suffers most from this is Art Garfunkel, who comes across as a whiner who can't let perceived slights from the distant past go (which may very well be true). It also means that the incident between Simon and Edie Brickell when the police were called to their house because of a physical altercation between them is brushed under the rug because Simon doesn't want to talk about it. Hilburn is not exactly doing a lot of investigative reporting here, but rather is the mouthpiece for Simon's version of his own history.\n\nThe last third of the book is the least interesting, covering the time after The Capeman (Simon's misguided and unsuccessful attempt at writing a Broadway play). From that point on Hilburn recounts the albums and tours and television appearances as if he's checking them off a list. There is little color to the stories and they feel rote.\n\nThat said, the beginning of the book allows readers to get insight into the creative process of a man who wrote some of our favorite songs and that is interesting."
