        "text": "With a career spanning seven decades, punctuated by phenomenal commercial success and critical acclaim, Paul Simon is among the most influential singer-songwriters of the rock era. As part of the folk-rock duo, Simon and Garfunkel, he influenced a generation of Americans with his songs – classics like “Bridge Over Troubled Water,” “Mrs. Robinson,” and “The Sounds of Silence,” written by Simon and sung in achingly beautiful harmony with tenor Art Garfunkel.\n\nAmong Simon’s earliest memories of his collaboration with Garfunkel is listening to the Everly Brothers, Don and Phil, who were recording the songs of Felice and Boudleux Bryant in Nashville.\n\nArtie and I, we really learned to sing harmony by learning the Everly Brothers. And their model was the Louvin Brothers. Don and Phil, for me, are still the best of all of the duos – better than Artie and me, better than John and Paul – just astonishingly great. Their sound was something that we strived for, that kind of buzz that you get, you know, when the blend is just right. You couldn’t tell who was singing lead because both parts were so beautiful and sung so beautifully. So Artie and I, as we were learning the Everly Brothers, we were also unconsciously learning the Louvins. And John and Paul were, undoubtedly, doing the same thing.\n\nWhen Simon and Garfunkel split in 1970, Simon launched a successful solo career, marked by his fierce commitment to following an artistic path driven wherever his muse has taken him – a path that has led him to cultures and musical traditions from around the world. His songwriting has incorporated reggae, Peruvian folk songs, New Orleans brass bands, and traditional gospel choirs. His revolutionary album, Graceland (1986), explored and blended American and African musical forms, fusing zydeco, the street music of Soweto, South Africa, a cappella singing, and traditional Zulu singing with his pop sensibilities. The album has sold between 14 and 16 million copies to date, and earned Simon two GRAMMY awards: Album of the Year in 1987 and Record of the Year, for the song “Graceland,” in 1988.\n\nSimon has 14 additional GRAMMYs to his credit, including two more Albums of the Year (Bridge Over Troubled Water and Still Crazy After All These Years) and a Lifetime Achievement Award, presented to him in 2009. In 2001, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and in 2006 was selected by Time magazine as one of the “100 People Who Shaped the World.” Rolling Stone has added his name to two of their “100 Greatest of All Time” lists – as a guitarist (2011) and a songwriter (2015). In 2007, he was the first recipient of the Library of Congress’s Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. He released the album In the Blue Light – featuring ten re-workings of previous recordings – in 2018, and continues to perform, giving the proceeds from his concerts to charity, primarily those involved with childrens’ musical education and the environment.\n\nBorn: October 13, 1941, Newark, New Jersey"
