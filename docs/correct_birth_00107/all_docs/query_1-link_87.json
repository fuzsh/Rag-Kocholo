        "text": "“Paul Simon tries really hard with the word ‘motherfucker.’ But he has trouble with it.” This was the verdict of the critic Rob Sheffield, writing in the Village Voice in 1997. It was a tricky time for anyone who loved Paul Simon, and surely not an easy time for Simon himself. He had just released an album of songs from “The Capeman,” his ill-fated Broadway musical, which had become about as notorious as the teen-age killer who inspired it. The album wasn’t a cast recording, because Simon did almost all of the singing, delivering even the saltiest exchanges with a delicate precision that some found unduly quaint. It had been more than a decade since “Graceland,” and more than three decades since “The Sound of Silence,” and it seemed possible that Simon, one of the most accomplished overthinkers in the history of popular music, had at last grown tired of being himself. A man who once famously—if softly—proclaimed himself a rock and an island was now proclaiming himself a Puerto Rican hoodlum named Salvador Agron. “The Capeman” closed after only sixty-eight performances, and many Simon fans probably didn’t even bother to check to see if there were any sparkling little melodies tucked away on the accompanying album. (There were.)\n\nSimon responded to the disappointment by staging one of rock music’s greatest late-career comebacks. Starting in 2000, with “You’re the One,” Simon has turned out a series of clever, quietly audacious albums, containing some songs that are as good as any he has made. He has earned plenty of gravitas over the years, but he seems too restless to spend it, embarking instead on a series of experiments in rhythm and texture, and honing in his lyrics a shrugging acceptance of an imperfect world. Where some of his contemporaries were effortlessly cool, Simon always seemed like a rock star who “tries really hard,” as Sheffield put it. But now, more than half a century into Simon’s career, it is much easier to see his determination to try hard as an asset, a weapon against complacency and cheap sentiment. The title track to “You’re the One” began with a lover’s prayer. “May twelve angels guard you while you sleep,” he sang, and he let the lyric reverberate for a moment before delivering the punch line: “Maybe that’s a waste of angels, I dunno.”\n\nIn Simon’s lyrics, the decisions are invariably mixed: he once told the music journalist Paul Zollo, “I try to get all the opposites into the same song, if I can.” The longer he sings, the less he knows for sure. For “Surprise,” from 2006, he recruited Brian Eno to compose a “sonic landscape” that uplifted a rather sombre set of songs, although he appended a new fan favorite: “Father and Daughter,” from the soundtrack to “The Wild Thornberrys Movie,” an animated feature. “So Beautiful or So What,” from 2011, was a career highlight, a reflection on love and God that seemed partly addressed to his wife, the singer and songwriter Edie Brickell, whom he married in 1992. At one point, Simon, uncharacteristically overcome, bumped up against the limits of his chosen form, singing, “I loved her the first time I saw her—I know that’s an old songwriting cliché.”\n\nAnd now the “motherfucker” is back. In June, Simon will release his thirteenth solo album, “Stranger to Stranger,” which is friskier and funnier than its recent predecessors—his most danceable music in decades. He meets his old nemesis near the end, in a song called “Cool Papa Bell,” named for the great Negro League center fielder. “Motherfucker,” Simon mutters, as the warm feelings of the chorus dissipate. “Ugly word.” For a moment, he doesn’t seem to be singing at all. But then he continues, adding melody and alighting upon a rhyme that encourages us to hear the music in what came before:\n\nUbiquitous and often heard\n\nAs a substitute for someone’s Christian name\n\nAnd I think yeah the word is ugly—all the same\n\nUgly got a case to make\n\nHis brief on behalf of ugliness is belied, naturally, by music that fails to be ugly in the least. (Nothing that he sings can break the spell cast by Vincent Nguini, a guitarist from Cameroon whose buoyant lines have enlivened his music ever since “The Rhythm of the Saints,” in 1990.) Simon doesn’t apologize for his conviction that music should be easy on the ears. He has shown little interest in the grit and grunge that often signal rock-and-roll authenticity, and even now, at seventy-four, he sings in a voice that is boyish and clear. More than any other musician of his age and stature—more than Bob Dylan or Aretha Franklin or Mick Jagger, more than Paul McCartney or Joni Mitchell—he seems unburdened by the years, and by his own reputation. He has managed to become neither a wizened oracle nor an oldies act, and his best songs convey the appealing sensation of listening to a guy who is still trying to figure out what he’s doing. “I’m never gonna stop,” he sings, at the end of “Cool Papa Bell”—only, and inevitably, to reverse himself a few minutes later, on the album’s finale, “Insomniac’s Lullaby.” It ends with a promise, and a benediction: “We’ll eventually all fall asleep.” Knowing Simon, it won’t be soon, or for long.\n\nIn 1972, when Simon was still best known as one half of Simon & Garfunkel, he gave an interview to Rolling Stone in which he considered his place in the musical pantheon. “I never compare myself with the Rolling Stones,” he said. “I always was well aware of the fact that S. & G. was a much bigger phenomenon in general, to the general public, than the Rolling Stones.” The intervening decades have largely reversed this perception. The Rolling Stones endure—in memory and, to a lesser extent, onstage—as the paradigmatic rock-and-roll band. Meanwhile, Simon & Garfunkel have been eclipsed by their own beloved songs: the duo itself is less iconic than “The Sound of Silence” or “Mrs. Robinson” or “Bridge Over Troubled Water.” Later in the interview, Simon expressed a cautious but prophetic hope that his late production would outpace those early hits. “Maybe I’m not gonna do my thing until I’m fifty,” he said. “People will say then, ‘Funny thing was, in his youth he sang with a group.’ ” As it happened, Simon was forty-four when “Graceland” appeared, and for many listeners it served as an introduction to a singer and songwriter whose past they knew only vaguely, if at all.\n\nNot long after Simon’s fiftieth birthday, on an episode of MTV’s “Beavis and Butt-head,” Beavis referred to him as “that dude from Africa that used to be in the Beatles.” In fact, Simon was born in Newark and grew up in Queens, and he was a songwriter and a perfectionist by the time he was a teen-ager. He formed a fruitful but complicated partnership with Art Garfunkel, a neighborhood friend who had both a limpid tenor voice and mixed feelings about being perceived merely as a lovely singer. Simon & Garfunkel weren’t quite the Beatles, but their five albums are stocked with more left turns and experiments than you might remember. “Bookends,” from 1968, includes the wistful hit “America,” which was recently revived in an advertisement for another spry seventy-four-year-old from New York: Bernie Sanders. But it also contains “Save the Life of My Child,” a surreal excursion that starts with a squelch of Moog synthesizer and includes a ghostly, disconcerting snippet—we would now call it a sample—of Simon & Garfunkel singing “The Sound of Silence.”\n\nGarfunkel’s hymnlike harmonies served to sacralize Simon’s songs, although the significance of this became clear only after the duo split up, in the early nineteen-seventies. Recording on his own, Simon developed a lighter touch and a taste for livelier rhythms. After he got interested in a new Jamaican genre called reggae, he flew to Kingston to record “Mother and Child Reunion,” an upbeat elegy named for a chicken-and-egg entrée he had seen on a Chinatown menu. The three solo albums that made his reputation—“Paul Simon,” “There Goes Rhymin’ Simon,” and “Still Crazy After All These Years”—arrived, startlingly, during the course of only four years, from 1972 through 1975.\n\nThe critic Robert Christgau once described Simon’s vocal affect as “studied wimpiness,” and, looking back, it’s possible to imagine Simon easing into a comfortable life as a gentle singer-strummer—a species that thrived in the nineteen-seventies. As Simon tells it, his career was disrupted by his 1983 album, “Hearts and Bones,” which didn’t generate any hits. He was feeling unsure of his future in the industry when he heard a cassette of contemporary South African music. He got in touch with a South African music producer and booked a ticket to Johannesburg, as a kind of sequel to his earlier trip to Kingston. When he arrived, he began work on an album propelled by riffs and musicians from a fistful of South African bands: the Boyoyo Boys, General M.D. Shirinda and the Gaza Sisters, Tao Ea Matsekha, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Stimela. “Graceland” didn’t make much of an impression on American radio playlists: “You Can Call Me Al,” the lead single, originally failed to reach the Top 40. But the album sold millions of copies, achieving the sort of transgenerational success that made it ripe for mockery in the nineties, when Sheffield was writing, and for rediscovery in the aughts, when it helped inspire the indie band Vampire Weekend, whose members were young enough to think of “Graceland,” fondly, as their parents’ music.\n\nPart of what “Graceland” gave Simon was a set of rhythms strong and flexible enough to prevent his songs from being overwhelmed by his lyrics. Some musicians excel at giving a good groove room to breathe. Simon is often at his best when he is wordiest; on “Graceland,” he spent forty-three minutes chattering about “scatterlings” and “Fat Charlie the Archangel” and some cinematographer’s party where a guy either had or hadn’t met a woman he liked. Bakithi Kumalo, the principal bassist on that album, has remained a core member of Simon’s band, and, in the years afterward, Simon’s quest for rhythm took him to Brazil, for “The Rhythm of the Saints,” and then to New York’s Puerto Rican neighborhoods, for “The Capeman.” The albums he made after that were quieter but no less rhythmically sophisticated. “Hurricane Eye,” from “You’re the One,” began with something like bluegrass and then nimbly shifted between 4/4, 6/8, and 7/8 time. And “So Beautiful or So What” was grounded by infectious shuffling rhythms that made Simon’s intricate songs sound as sturdy as folk music.\n\nThe new album, “Stranger to Stranger,” begins with a shuffle, too, along with a well-placed howl. Simon’s collaborators include the Italian electronic producer known as Clap! Clap!, a flamenco band, and the composer and inventor Harry Partch, dead since 1974, whose homemade instruments contribute to the album’s dreamlike ambience. Death and dreaming are the chief preoccupations, which helps explain that howl: it introduces a song called “The Werewolf,” in which Simon warns of an avenging angel of death, ready to give “the winners” and “the wealthy” what’s coming to them. Part of the joke, of course, is that a rock-and-roll aristocrat like Simon would be among the werewolf’s first victims. The album lasts only thirty-seven minutes, and there are a few dead ends: the title track is a ruminative love song in which we wait, along with Simon, for a redemptive chorus that never arrives. More often, though, the music is remarkably agile and entertaining; Simon acknowledges no reason that a septuagenarian shouldn’t cut loose and get funky.\n\nSimon has endured by easing up, and even his increasingly frequent invocations of God serve less to aggrandize his observations than to deflate them; from a cosmic point of view, his joys and sorrows seem like so much quibbling. “Wristband,” scooting along atop a rubbery groove, begins as a rather obnoxious act of censure: Simon mocks an oblivious security guard who blocks a musician’s path at his own concert, saying, “You got to have a wristband.” He imagines the bouncer as St. Peter barring the way to Heaven. Then, in the final verse, the scope broadens:\n\nThe riots started slowly\n\nWith the homeless and the lowly\n\nThen they spread into the heartland\n\nTowns that never get a wristband\n\nKids that can’t afford the cool brand\n\nWhose anger is a shorthand\n\nFor you’ll never get a wristband\n\nIt is hard to tell whether Simon is ennobling his fit of pique by comparing it to the anger of the dispossessed or mocking his own overreaction. Perhaps it is possible to do both at once. Either way, the message to bouncers all over the world is clear: that mild-looking seventy-four-year-old standing outside the stage door might be Paul Simon, in which case he is certainly not as mild as he looks.\n\nSimon disdains nostalgia, but a few years ago he permitted himself to celebrate “Graceland” by returning to South Africa for a reunion concert. The trip was chronicled in “Under African Skies,” an invaluable documentary by Joe Berlinger, and it reinvigorated a long-running debate—not about the greatness of the album, which is more or less beyond dispute, but about whether it should have been recorded at all. At the time, South Africa’s apartheid government was facing international sanctions, including a cultural boycott, backed by the African National Congress, the banned opposition party, and supported by the United Nations, which called on “writers, artists, musicians and other personalities to boycott South Africa.”\n\nThe film includes jubilant scenes of Simon reconnecting with the South African musicians who helped him make his masterpiece. But the most memorable encounter is a strained meeting between Simon and Dali Tambo, a co-founder of Artists Against Apartheid, which tried to enforce the cultural boycott in the nineteen-eighties. Tambo says he worried that Simon’s collaboration with South African musicians—even black South African musicians—might confer some “legitimacy” upon the government. “It wasn’t the ideal form of cultural exchange,” Tambo says, carefully. “They weren’t free people.”\n\n“Then why did they say come?” Simon responds. “Do you think they were all so selfish that they did it for three times union scale?” (He likes to mention that he paid the musicians more than he had to.) He pleads a kind of artistic innocence. “We didn’t have anything to do with color, race—it was purely music,” he says. Historians can debate the wisdom and efficacy of the cultural boycott, but it seems clear that to Simon great music is its own justification; depending on one’s priorities, this can seem like a form of nihilism or a form of idealism.\n\nNowadays, arguments over “Graceland” focus less on the cultural boycott and more on cultural appropriation. “Graceland” was, among other things, an Afro-pop album credited to a white guy from Queens, and although Simon listed and praised his collaborators on the back cover, some of his critics weren’t satisfied. As it happens, the most sustained criticism has come not from South Africa but from Los Angeles, home of the long-running Latin rock band Los Lobos, which was featured on the album’s finale, “All Around the World or the Myth of Fingerprints.” The band’s charge, which Simon denies, is that the music came largely from a preëxisting (though unfinished) Los Lobos song. If this story is proved true, it might alter the royalty payments from “Graceland,” but it wouldn’t alter our view of Simon, who used the raucous backbeat in an unexpected way, as the base for a bittersweet fable about a gnomic former talk-show host. “This is all around the world,” he sang—a tidy conclusion for a world-music landmark, except that the singer sounded a lot less jubilant than the musicians alongside him.\n\nNone of Simon’s recent albums have come, as “Graceland” did, with a song-by-song genealogy, but they confirm his status as an expert collaborator and assembler. In a song near the end of “So Beautiful or So What,” he was accompanied by a snippet from a nineteen-thirties recording of the Golden Gate Quartet, a gospel group. “Ain’t no song like an old song,” Simon sang, creating a new one even as the old singers moaned their assent. What this kind of scavenging requires, beyond an uncanny ability to fit one musical statement atop another, is ruthless single-mindedness. No matter what Simon listens to, he hears nothing but raw ingredients for Paul Simon songs; when he finds something he likes, he makes it his own, on the correct assumption that most people will enjoy it too much to complain. From this perspective, the problem with “The Capeman” is not that Simon was laying claim to decades of Puerto Rican pop; it is that his claim wasn’t bold enough. One of the few blank spaces in his crowded discography is the great salsa-inspired album that he didn’t make: the one where the bright certainty of the horn section pulled against the wary voice of the guy on the cover, hemming and hawing about his place in the world.\n\nWhat Simon has discovered, in the post-“Capeman” years, is a way to stay stubborn without getting stuck. He is proudly unself-contained, evidently requiring regular infusions of fresh rhythms and new collaborators in order to keep up his steady pace: a short album every five years or so. It is, perhaps, a vampirish way to work, except that he seems to leave his collaborators more alive than he found them. He, too, appears to be in rude health, singing relatively cheerful songs about an afterlife that it’s not clear he believes in:\n\nThey say all roads lead to a river\n\nThen one day\n\nThe river comes up to your door\n\nHow will the builder of bridges deliver us all\n\nTo the faraway shore\n\nHe doesn’t sound as if he expects an answer. In fact, he seems to feel that if he keeps asking questions, following his curiosity wherever it leads, he may never have to find out. ♦"
