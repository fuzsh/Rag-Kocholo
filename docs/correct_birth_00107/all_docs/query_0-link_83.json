        "text": "Paul Simon: The Composer\n\nSimon and Garfunkle placed 28 songs on the popularity charts as a duo and Paul alone added 30 more – with his final single in 2013 “You Can Call Me Al” which was number 123 on the UK charts as a re-release.\n\nPaul Simon was born Paul Frederic Simon on October 13th, 1941 in Newark, New Jersey. Early on he was associated with Art Garfunkle on some recordings and the two first charted in December of 1957 with “Hey Schoolgirl”.\n\nIn the early days, Paul would compose as Jerry Landis, Paul Kane and True Taylor.\n\nEight years would pass by before the two reinvented themselves as folk singers breaking through big with the number 1 “Sounds of Silence” in late 1965.\n\nRather sadly, as is common, Art and Paul’s relationship was not good and a split came in 1970. The two going forward rarely spoke to one another yet – they did manage occasional collaborations.\n\nSimon and Garfunkle were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 as a duo and Paul would be inducted as a solo in 2001. Paul’s songs were oft-recognized through the years at the top of their categories!\n\nPaul composed songs covered by many other musicians – following is a selective listing of those.\n\nPaul Simon Selected Composition Discography\n\nTom and Jerry – Hey Schoolgirl – #54 Hot 100 – December, 1957\n\nTom and Jerry – Key Schoolgirl – December, 1958\n\nReissued by King Records\n\nTico and the Triumphs – Motorcycle – October, 1961\n\nMembers over time were Paul Simon, Mickey Borack (Tico), Marty Cooper, Howie Beck and Gail Lynn\n\nCharted on the Amy Label in 1962\n\nTico and the Triumphs – Motorcycle – #99 Hot 100 – January, 1962\n\nTico and the Triumphs – Wild Flower b/w Express Train – May, 1962\n\nTico and the Triumphs – Get Up and Do the Wobble b/w Cry, Little Boy, Cry – September, 1962\n\nTico and the Triumphs – Noise b/w Cards of Love – November, 1962\n\nThe Bachelors – The Sound of Silence – #3 UK – March, 1966\n\nThe Seekers – Someday, One Day – #11 UK – March, 1966\n\nThe Quiet Five – Homeward Bound – #44 UK – April, 1966\n\nThe Cyrkle – Red Rubber Ball – #2 Hot 100 – May, 1966\n\nHarpers Bizarre – The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin’ Groovy) – #13 Hot 100 – #4 Adult Contemporary – #34 UK – February, 1967\n\nRay Conniff – Sounds of Silence – #34 Adult Contemporary – June, 1968\n\nThe Alan Copeland Singers – Classical Gas/Scarborough Fair – #20 Adult Contemporary – #123 Bubbling Under – January, 1969\n\nJohnny Mathis – The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin’ Groovy) – #39 Adult Contemporary – March, 1969\n\nBooker T. and the MG’s – Mrs. Robinson – #37 Hot 100 – #20 Adult Contemporary – #35 R&B – June, 1969\n\nSouthwest F.O.B. – Feelin’ Groovy – #115 Bubbling Under – January, 1970\n\nBrenda Byers – Homeward Bound – #66 Country\n\nJulie Felix – If I Could (El Condor Pasa) – #19 UK – April, 1970\n\nBuck Owens – Bridge Over Troubled Water – #9 Country – #119 Bubbling Under – February, 1971\n\nGary Puckett – Keep the Customer Satisfied – #71 Hot 100 – #28 Adult Contemporary – February, 1971\n\nAretha Franklin – Bridge Over Troubled Water – #6 Hot 100 – #40 Adult Contemporary – #1 R&B – April, 1971\n\nYes – America – #46 Hot 100 – August, 1972\n\nJosh – Was A Sunny Day – #13 Adult Contemporary – July, 1973\n\nThe Dixie Hummingbirds with Paul Simon – Loves Me Like A Rock – #72 R&B – September, 1973\n\nPaul Simon with Phoebe Snow and the Jessy Dixon Singers – Gone At Last – #23 Hot 100 – #9 Adult Contemporary – August, 1975\n\nBob Yarborough – 50 Ways to Leave Your Lover – #85 Country – April, 1976\n\nJohnny Paycheck and Charnissa – Gone At Last – #49 Country – May, 1976\\\n\nDavid Sanborn – Smile – #98 R&B – December, 1976\n\nPlayed with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band and more\n\nAWB – Cloudy – #55 R&B – March, 1977\n\nLinda Clifford – Bridge Over Troubled Water – #41 Hot 100 – #11 Dance – #49 R&B – #28 UK – March, 1979\n\nEmmylou Harris – The Boxer – #13 Country – September, 1980\n\nSonny Curtis – Fifty Ways To Leave Your Lover – #70 Country – November, 1980\n\nThe Bangles – Hazy Shade of Winter – #2 Hot 100 – #41 Rock – #11 UK – November, 1987\n\nTimes Two – Cecilia – #79 Hot 100 – July, 1988\n\nThe Dramatics – Bridge Over Troubled Water – #93 R&B – April, 1989\n\nThe Lemonheads – Mrs. Robinson – #118 Bubbling Under – #8 Alternative – November, 1992\n\nEverything But the Girl – The Only Living Boy in New York – #42 UK – April, 1993\n\nWillie Nelson – Graceland – #70 Country – June, 1993\n\nAnnie Lennox – Something So Right – #44 UK – December, 1995\n\nSuggs – Cecilia – #4 UK – April, 1996"
