        "text": "Singer-songwriter Paul Simon has made hits and earned accolades for over half a century, both solo and with early collaborator Art Garfunkel.\n\nIn this eight-week session, we’ll explore how Simon (with and without Garfunkel) incorporated different musical styles into his own, from the folk and rock fusion of the 1960s and 70s to the world music influences in Simon’s 1980s and 90s solo work.\n\nWe’ll also study Simon’s poetic, storytelling lyrics, finger-picking acoustic guitar and use of world instruments, as well as the vocal harmonies Garfunkel brought to the mix.\n\nContemporary artists like Harry Styles, Conor Oberst, Lorde and Vampire Weekend have cited Simon as an important influence, and you’ll find everyone from Phoebe Bridgers to the Muppets covering his hits."
