He was born to Louis Simon and Belle Simon. Both parents were Hungarian-Jewish. Simon shares the same parents with his brother, Eddie Simon.

Simon was raised as âa specific kind of New York Jew, almost a clichÃ©, who values music and baseball highly,â according to musician Donald Fagen. I believe that the parents are to blame.

As a kid, Simon enjoyed playing stickball and baseball. Despite working late and not spending much time with his kids, he said his father was humorous and educated. At age 11, Simon and Art Garfunkel first crossed paths.

Together, Simon & Garfunkel made five albums, including the classics âMrs. Robinson,â âAmerica,â âBridge over Troubled Water,â and âThe Boxer,â with the majority of the songs being penned by Simon.

The hit tracks âMother and Child Reunionâ and âMe and Julio Down by the Schoolyardâ were featured on his 1972 self-titled album.
