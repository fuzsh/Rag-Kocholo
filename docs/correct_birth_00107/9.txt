Musician Paul Simon (born on October 13, 1941, in Newark, New Jersey), is a one-time Golden Globe nominee for Best Song Motion Picture (“Father and Daughter”), for the animated film The Wild Thornberrys Movie, in 2003.

In 1957, with his high school buddy Art Garfunkel, he wrote and recorded the single “Hey Schoolgirl” under the name Tom and Jerry. Following a break-up lasted a few years (there was always a troubled relation), Simon & Garfunkel got back together and recorded “Wednesday Morning 3 a.m.”. Then came the album “The Sound of Silence” (1966), which propelled them into folk-rock stardom. Their next album, “Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme”, features songs such as “Homeward Bound” and “The 59th Bridge Song (Feelin’ Groovy)”, all written by Simon. In 1967 director Mike Nichols asked Simon to write a score for his upcoming film The Graduate (1967), which became a “cult movie” thanks also to Simon’s songs. Simon & Garfunkel next album, “Bookends” (1968), considered one of the greatest albums of the ’60s, featured “Mrs. Robinson” (from The Graduate) and classic such as “Hazy Shade of Winter”, “At The Zoo”, “America”. Their last album together, “Bridge Over Troubled Water” was released in 1970 and became an instant best-seller worldwide. The duo was voted the 40th Greatest Artists in Rock ‘n’ Roll by “Rolling Stone” magazine.

From 1971 on Simon went on to a very prolific and successful musical career. He was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2001 (as a solo artist). The reunion concert with Garfunkel in Central Park, New York, in 1981, their last performance together, is a legendary event in the annuals of rock ‘n roll.
