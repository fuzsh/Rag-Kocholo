        "text": "Monogamy\n\nWhen a pregnant woman's unborn child is ripped from her abdomen in an horrific attack, Detectives Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni) go on a frantic search for the child, in the hopes that it could have survived. The woman's husband (guest star John Ritter) appears traumatized by the attack which upsets his orderly lifestyle. But when it is discovered that his wife may have been having an affair with a construction worker (guest star Bobby Cannavale) both men come under suspicion for an act of unconscionable jealousy and rage.\n\nMy Old Man\n\nAn assortment of moms and dads descend on their offspring at home and in the workplace. J.D.'s father is a gregarious yet lonely divorcee who's desperately trying to be just one of the guys. Elliot's folks, on the other hand, are a snooty couple whose pompous behavior dismays their daughter. Similarly rattled is Turk, unnerved by the bonding of his girlfriend, Carla, and his brassy mother. But the most vexatious parent by far is the janitor's dad.\n\nMy Lucky Day\n\nJD (Zach Braff) is riding high after correcting a misdiagnosis by Dr. Cox (John C. McGinley), but is jerked back to reality when he is unable to explain the death of his next patient. Meanwhile Elliot (Sarah Chalke) is struggling personally and professionally as she is forced to relinquish all of the luxuries that her father had been financing -- including her apartment -- and a malpractice suit is brought against her by a patient (guest star Alan Ruck, \"Spin City\") for saving his life. Carla (Judy Reyes) learns that sometimes it is better to keep her opinions to herself when the fallout of a conversation with Dr. Cox about his relationship with his ex-wife lands Jordan (guest star Christa Miller) in the hospital. Donald Faison, Ken Jenkins and Neil Flynn also star."
