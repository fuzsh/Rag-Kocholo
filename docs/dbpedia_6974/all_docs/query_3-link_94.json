        "text": "The trouble in Scotland\n\nBorn in 1542, Mary became Queen of Scotland when she was just six days old. During her childhood Scotland was ruled by regents. In 1558 she married Francis, the heir to the French crown, and in July 1559 he became king, uniting the thrones of France and Scotland. Eight months earlier, Mary’s cousin Elizabeth had become Queen of England.\n\nBut Francis died suddenly in 1560, and Mary, who had lived in France for most of her life, found herself no longer welcome there. She decided to return to Scotland to rule in person. What followed was an uneasy balancing act. As a Catholic queen, Mary struggled to govern a country that was officially Protestant and allied to its former enemy, England.\n\nThe balance tipped from 1565 after Mary married her cousin Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, who was a Catholic. Their son, James, was born the following year, but the marriage soon deteriorated. A series of disasters – the murder of David Rizzio, Mary’s secretary, by Darnley and others; the murder of Darnley himself; and Mary’s marriage to her adviser James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell, three months later – led many Scottish nobles to rise against her.\n\nMary and Bothwell confronted their opponents on 15 June 1567. Mary surrendered and was imprisoned, on condition that Bothwell be allowed to go into exile. In July she was forced to abdicate in favour of her infant son. The following May she escaped from her prison, Lochleven Castle – only for her forces to be defeated soon afterwards at Langside, near Glasgow.\n\nArrival in England\n\nIt was at this point that Mary decided to seek refuge in England. Her supporters begged her to stay in Scotland or head for Catholic France. But she was convinced that Elizabeth – her cousin, and like her an anointed monarch – would help her raise an army to return to Scotland in triumph. Before leaving Scotland she wrote to Elizabeth requesting a meeting and sending a diamond ring as a token of her friendship.\n\nWithout waiting for a reply, she and 16 supporters made the four-hour crossing of the Solway Firth (the strait that forms part of the border between England and Scotland). They arrived at the port of Workington in Cumberland (modern-day Cumbria) in the early evening.\n\nThe following morning Richard Lowther, the deputy governor of Cumberland, provided an escort to take Mary to nearby Carlisle Castle.\n\nAt this point, Mary’s status was uncertain. She had arrived of her own free will, and was neither a captive nor a hostage. From the moment of her arrival at Carlisle Castle Mary was put under armed guard. Yet on 20 May she wrote to a supporter that she had been ‘right well received and honourably accompanied and treated’.\n\nMary at Carlisle\n\nElizabeth sent Sir Francis Knollys, one of her trusted courtiers, to Carlisle to keep an eye on Mary. He was charmed by her in person:\n\nShe was a notable woman because she had no care for ceremonies beyond the acknowledgement of her royal estate; then she spoke freely to everyone, whatever their rank and showeth a disposition to speak much and to be bold and to be pleasant and to be very familiar.\n\nHowever, he lived in constant fear that Mary would escape. He let her walk on the grass in front of the castle – thereafter known as ‘the lady’s walk’. Twice he allowed her to watch members of her entourage playing football against each other. But when she went out on horseback to hunt hare, ‘she galloping so fast upon every occasion’, he put his foot down and said that this could not happen again.\n\nHaving arrived with only a handful of attendants, Mary was allowed to send for many of her old staff, as well as her own clothing – she refused to wear anything else. Cartloads of clothes and personal effects soon arrived from Lochleven. Her numerous attendants included Mary Seton, a lady-in-waiting who had helped her escape from captivity in Scotland. The queen had cut off much of her hair after the Battle of Langside to escape recognition. But Mary Seton styled it so skilfully that ‘every other day-lighte … she hath a new devyce of head dressing’.\n\nMary borrowed money from city merchants to help her keep up a suitably royal appearance. However, the cost of maintaining her little court fell mainly on Queen Elizabeth. The English queen paid an average of £56 a week for commodities such as meat, fish, spices, biscuits, butter, peat for heating and wine.\n\nQueen Mary’s Tower\n\nMary was housed in what was then known as the Warden’s Tower, in the south-east corner of the inner ward. It later became known as Queen Mary’s Tower.\n\nThis two-storey building was added to the castle in 1308 to provide fine accommodation. It was said to have a window from which Mary could look towards Scotland. This is confirmed by a description of the 1830s of ‘a spacious room called the queen’s bedchamber lighted by two windows facing to the south and one to the north’ on the first floor. The tower was also described as being ‘in a richer style of architecture than the other parts of the castle’.\n\nIn 1835 the tower was demolished when it was on the verge of collapse. All that now survives is an octagonal turret housing a staircase that once gave access to this tower.\n\nA disastrous mistake\n\nWhatever Mary may have hoped, her decision to seek refuge in England was a disastrous mistake. It put Elizabeth in a difficult position. Privately she sympathised with Mary, as a fellow monarch who had been imprisoned and deposed. However, both she and her advisers – most forcefully her chief adviser, William Cecil – saw Mary as highly dangerous.\n\nAs a Catholic with a claim to the English throne, Mary’s presence on English soil provided both a potential rallying point for Catholic rebels at home and a possible cause for invasion by Catholic powers abroad. If she was restored to the Scottish throne, England would be surrounded by Catholic countries. It suited the English to keep the Earl of Moray, Mary’s half-brother and a Protestant, as regent in Scotland.\n\nLooming over Mary was the suspicion that she had been involved in the murder of her second husband, Darnley. Cecil and Moray soon exploited this.\n\nAlthough Mary hoped for a swift return to her throne, in late May Knollys told her that there was no prospect of this unless she was cleared of murdering Darnley. Mary protested her innocence and refused to stand trial, insisting that only God could judge a sovereign. Despite her impassioned letters to the queen requesting a face to face meeting, Elizabeth would not budge.\n\nYears of captivity\n\nEventually, Mary reluctantly agreed to an inquiry into the charges against her. In late July 1568, before it began, she was moved south to Bolton Castle in Yorkshire. Four carriages, 20 packhorses and 23 riding horses were needed to convey her, her retinue and her belongings.\n\nThe inquiry began in October. Despite the Scots producing incriminating evidence against Mary (which was almost certainly falsified), in January 1569 Elizabeth declared that there was no proof either way. Yet although she was no longer accused of any crime, Mary remained in England. She was now without doubt a prisoner.\n\nBolton Castle was the first of many places where she would be held over the years that followed. From early 1569 the Earl of Shrewsbury, a leading nobleman, became her custodian, and Mary was shuttled between several of his castles and manors.\n\nAlthough under house arrest she was treated as an exiled ruler and guest – she had her own household, could receive visitors, and was afforded luxuries and privileges. This put a huge strain on Shrewsbury’s finances, as well as his marriage. Mary initially spent many hours with Shrewsbury’s countess, Bess of Hardwick. Eventually, though, the two fell out, Bess suspecting Mary of having an affair with her husband."
