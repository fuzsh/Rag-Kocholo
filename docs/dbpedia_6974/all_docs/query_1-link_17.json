It is a Common Crew Member which means it amplifies only one Racer statistics (Handling, Boost\n\nLoot Points) and enhances one skill (Shield). It also provides an extra Loot Points % Bonus. John and Mary are part of the WALL-E Collection.\n\nOrigin\n\nJohn and Mary are characters in the 2008 Disney/Pixar animated film WALL-E. Passengers onboard the Axiom, they met one another in the course of WALL-E's actions on the ship and subsequently fell in love.\n\nJohn first met WALL-E when the latter was looking for EVE onboard the Axiom. He mistakenly thought WALL-E was a waiter bot and asked him to take away his drink, but leaned too far and accidentally fell out of his hover chair. Unable to get up, two steward bots came over and began directing other passengers around him, but ignored John as he requested help getting back into his chair. WALL-E, however, came to his aid, pushing John back into his chair and introducing himself. John did the same, before WALL-E left to continue chasing after EVE.\n\nAs WALL-E continued after EVE, he met Mary, who was on a hologram call with her friend. WALL-E tried to get around her to reach EVE, but was unable to do so without being squashed. Trying to get Mary's attention, he switched off her call, causing her to notice the rest of the ship in wonder. As WALL-E introduced himself and indicated his wish to get past, Mary acquiesced and kindly moved her chair back."
