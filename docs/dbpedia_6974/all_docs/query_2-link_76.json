        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAs well as the popular shows of the 2000s, there were shows we've forgotten but loved just as much.\n\nFrom \"Pushing Daisies\" to \"Flight of the Conchords,\" we said goodbye to some quirky comedy shows.\n\n\"Freaks and Geeks\" only ran for one season but helped launch the careers of some of today's stars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Freaks and Geeks\" on NBC only ran for one season, but it helped launch the careers of stars like Jason Segel, Seth Rogen, and Busy Philipps.\n\nSeasons: 1 (1999-2000)\n\nWhat it was about: \"Freaks and Geeks\" follows two siblings, Lindsay and Sam, as they attend high school in suburban Michigan. Lindsay's friends are the \"freaks,\" while her younger brother's friends are the \"geeks.\"\n\nWhy we loved it: \"Freaks and Geeks\" was packed full of great characters, comedy, drama, and nuance, and it helped launch the careers of many recognizable names: Jason Segel, Seth Rogen, Busy Philipps, Linda Cardellini, and James Franco. Today it has something of a cult following.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nABC's \"Dharma and Greg\" was pulled from the air after five seasons.\n\nSeasons: 5 (1997-2002)\n\nWhat it was about: Dharma and Greg married despite being polar opposites: Dharma was a free-spirited yoga teacher, while Greg was a buttoned-up lawyer.\n\nWhy we loved it: While this show technically started in the '90s, it was pulled from the air in 2002 — giving this kooky comedy more than enough time to find its fans. Co-created by Chuck Lorre, who also co-created \"Two and a Half Men\" and \"The Big Bang Theory,\" the show's odd couple made for some good laughs. Stoking fans' hopes, Jenna Elfman, who played Dharma, told People in 2017 that a reboot \"would be really fun!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeri Russell starred in \"Felicity\" on the WB.\n\nSeasons: 4 (1998-2002)\n\nWhat it was about: Felicity, played by Keri Russell, follows her crush to New York City after high school, but once she's there, she finds a whole new world of possibilities.\n\nWhy we loved it: While the premise might sound like a sappy teen drama, its delivery was more adult than that, and it wasn't afraid to take on some serious themes. Clever writing, charming characters, and early star power (including Jennifer Garner) made this a fan favorite.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Roswell,\" which aired on the CW and UPN, was an edgy teen drama that ended in 2002.\n\nSeasons: 3 (1999-2002)\n\nWhat it was about: This drama follows a group of teens in their hometown of Roswell, New Mexico, which is well known for its UFO sightings. Among the characters are three human-alien hybrids with extraordinary gifts.\n\nWhy we loved it: The show made balancing drama, humor, and mystery look easy. Its science-fiction subject matter gave it a bit more edge than other teen dramas of the time, such as \"Beverly Hills 90210\" or \"Dawson's Creek.\" More recently, it's been given a reboot of sorts; \"Roswell, New Mexico,\" which was released in 2019, is based on the same book as the original, \"Roswell High\" by Melinda Metz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"So Little Time\" on Fox Family was just one of the many shows starring the Olsen twins.\n\nSeasons: 1 (2001-2002)\n\nWhat it was about: This sitcom follows two teenagers, Chloe and Riley, which were played by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. They live in a mansion in Malibu, California, while dealing with the troubles of high school heartaches.\n\nWhy we loved it: \"So Little Time\" marked a significant time in the Olsen entertainment empire. They were no longer little girls, playing hijinx in plotless movies. Now, Mary-Kate and Ashley were finally teenagers, and we got to see them act that way. For the people who grew up with the twins, this show was a natural progression and perfectly made sense. \"So Little Time\" was also one of the last acting gigs we got to see the Olsens in before they switched to fashion and left the spotlight for good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Firefly,\" which aired on Fox, still has a huge following today.\n\nSeasons: 1 (2002-2003)\n\nWhat it was about: In this space Western set 400 years in the future, a group of outlaws embark on missions aboard their spaceship, \"Serenity,\" and protect a young woman with special abilities.\n\nWhy we loved it: This show, created by Joss Whedon of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" was set in a detailed fantasy world and packed with both action and humor. Despite its short run, \"Firefly\" built up a cult following, and today that's stronger than ever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Dead Like Me\" on Showtime was a sort of \"Six Feet Under\" meets \"Buffy The Vampire Slayer.\"\n\nSeasons: 2 (2003-2004)\n\nWhat it was about: Eighteen-year-old Georgia \"George\" Lass dies in the first episode and becomes a \"grim reaper.\" Working with other grim reapers, she must remove the souls of people and escort them into their afterlives.\n\nWhy we loved it: Somehow it expertly blended death and comedy, and despite the show's dark and supernatural touches, George leads viewers on a relatable story about the pains of growing up. A direct-to-DVD movie was released five years after its demise, indicating there was still a demand for the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more than 10 years, \"NYPD Blue\" on ABC was a dark, gritty show full of complex characters and relationships.\n\nSeasons: 12 (1993-2005)\n\nWhat it was about: A fast-moving procedural drama following the day-to-day experiences of a group of fictional cops in New York City's 15th precinct.\n\nWhy we loved it: The show was packed with fascinating characters ... and some very adult themes and language. In fact, some affiliates and advertisers were so outraged by its nudity and language, they refused to touch it when it launched, but it was a mega hit for ABC. In 2013, 20 years after the show's launch, Variety said TV \"lost its edge\" after \"NYPD Blue\" ended.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe easy-to-like ABC sitcom \"My Wife and Kids\" starred Damon Wayans as a dad wanting a traditional family life in suburbia.\n\nSeasons: 5 (2001-2005)\n\nWhat it was about: A dad takes a step back from his successful career to spend more time with his wife and their three kids in suburban Connecticut.\n\nWhy we loved it: The sitcom about the ups and downs of often chaotic family life. Damon Wayans, who co-created the show, brought slapstick to his role as the dad. And while \"My Wife and Kids\" might sound like something we've all seen before, as Variety pointed out, it was actually a refreshing change at the time, when TV was dominated with extreme reality TV shows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"8 Simple Rules\" on ABC was a warm hug of a TV show.\n\nSeasons: 3 (2002-2005)\n\nWhat it was about: The show started as a family sitcom about two parents raising their three teenage kids, and the strict rules they enforced. But when actor John Ritter, who played the dad, passed away before the second season, his death was also written in to the show.\n\nWhy we loved it: \"8 Simple Rules\" could be cheesy, but Ritter's performance quickly won fans, and after his death, the show was praised for representing how a family responds to tough situations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Summerland\" starred Lori Loughlin and Jesse McCartney.\n\nSeasons: 2 (2004-2005)\n\nWhat it was about: When their parents die in a car wreck, three kids from Kansas move in with their aunt in Summerland, California, and deal with their grief.\n\nWhy we loved it: The emotional drama had everything: family problems, romantic troubles, and career struggles. Plus, the show takes place in a beach house, so it was the perfect escapism content. \"Summerland\" also starred heartthrob Jesse McCartney and Lori Loughlin (pre-admissions scandal). Not to mention, Zac Efron has a recurring role in the series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Deadwood\" on HBO won eight Emmys and a Golden Globe during its three-season run.\n\nSeasons: 3 (2004-2006)\n\nWhat it was about: \"Deadwood,\" which was based on real people in 1870s South Dakota, is set in a lawless mining town. It covers themes like Western capitalism as people traveled to Deadwood to get rich after a huge gold strike.\n\nWhy we loved it: Series creator David Milch rigorously researched the real Deadwood, creating a richly detailed town. He wrote lyrical, powerful dialogue, earning him comparisons to Shakespeare.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe adventure, twists, and turns on \"Alias\" kept us hooked.\n\nSeasons: 5 (2001-2006)\n\nWhat it was about: Jennifer Garner's character, Sydney Bristow, assumes multiple aliases while working as a double agent for the CIA and a spy organization.\n\nWhy we loved it: Packed with epic action sequences, double lives, and high-tech gadgets, \"Alias\" on ABC had high stakes. Plus, the characters made it all feel believable. As IndieWire wrote, \"Jennifer Garner as secret agent Sydney Bristow is mesmerizing as the all-American girl with a lethal edge ... The show would be nothing without the strength of her performance.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Everwood\" on the WB was a family drama with a lot of heart and a lot of raw emotion.\n\nSeasons: 4 (2002-2006)\n\nWhat it was about: After a successful surgeon's wife passes away, he moves with their two children from Manhattan to Colorado. The show follows the family as they adjust to small town living.\n\nWhy we loved it: Sometimes sickly, often charming, the conversations in this show no doubt hit pretty close to home for some families. Plus, it's set in the beautiful mountains of Colorado — and did we mention it features a young Chris Pratt?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe WB's \"What I Like About You\" wasn't a deep thinker, but it was definitely a show to lift the spirits.\n\nSeasons: 4 (2002-2006)\n\nWhat it was about: A responsible older sister, played by Jenny Garth, cares for her wild younger sister, played by Amanda Bynes, in New York City.\n\nWhy we loved it: It was a silly and easy-to-watch, showcasing Bynes' goofy physical comedy, while giving lessons on family loyalty and commitment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"7th Heaven\" featured some of today's best-known actors, such as Jessica Biel, Mila Kunis, Keri Russell, and Jane Lynch.\n\nSeasons: 11 (1996-2007)\n\nWhat it was about: A minister and his wife bring up seven children in their always-busy home in California.\n\nWhy we loved it: This safe, often sappy, family-friendly show on The WB and The CW promoted good values and supportive parenting as the Camdens overcame their problems together. The show was the WB's highest rated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCritics loved Aaron Sorkin's \"Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip\" on NBC, but it only lasted for one season.\n\nSeasons: 1 (2006-2007)\n\nWhat it was about: The show takes us behind the scenes of a fictional live sketch comedy show, which resembles \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nWhy we loved it: Created by Aaron Sorkin, \"Studio 60\" started airing just months after his wildly successful \"West Wing\" ended. Like its predecessor, \"Studio 60\" was a satirical, talk-y comedy that revealed the inner workings of a complex environment, with a dazzling cast led by Bradley Whitford and Matthew Perry. Critics loved it, and it received multiple award nominations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFans were disappointed when \"Reba\" didn't continue beyond its sixth season.\n\nSeasons: 6 (2001-2007)\n\nWhat it was about: Reba McEntire plays a mom living in Texas with her pregnant teenage daughter and new son-in-law after going through a divorce. It also follows her unlikely friendship with her ex-husband's pregnant mistress.\n\nWhy we loved it: This show could be silly but also serious, deftly handling heavier topics such as teen pregnancy and addiction. During its five seasons on The WB, \"Reba\" shattered viewership records.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFans fought to get \"Jericho\" back on the air, but unfortunately it didn't stay for long.\n\nSeasons: 2 (2006-2008)\n\nWhat it was about: This sci-fi action show focused on the small town of Jericho, Kansas, after nuclear attacks on the country.\n\nWhy we loved it: This ominous CBS show was full of twists and painted a bleak picture of a post-apocalyptic America. In fact, it was so beloved by fans that when it was canceled after just one season, they sent more than 40,000 pounds of peanuts to the CBS execs to try to change their minds — a nod to the final scene when a neighboring community demands its lead character surrenders and he says, \"Nuts\" — and it worked. The show was given one more season until it was canceled for good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Everybody Hates Chris\" on the CW was inspired by the teenage adventures of comedian Chris Rock.\n\nSeasons: 4 (2005-2009)\n\nWhat it was about: The show follows a kid growing up in the '80s as he's bussed to a predominantly white school.\n\nWhy we loved it: Its funny-yet-relatable family drama and nod to nostalgia was a mega hit. Critics loved its authentic period music, clothes, and cars, while others — expecting Rock's dark comedy — were surprised it was \"unexpectedly sweet-spirited.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Flight of the Conchords\" on HBO featured catchy, original songs and hilarious performances from its stars.\n\nSeasons: 2 (2007-2009)\n\nWhat it was about: A musical duo from New Zealand called Flight of the Conchords try to drum up support in the New York City music scene.\n\nWhy we loved it: In the quirky, deadpan \"Flight of the Conchords,\" stars Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement played fictionalized versions of themselves. It also featured one-episode cameos from other comedians, including Aziz Ansari, Jim Gaffigan, Kristen Wiig, and Patton Oswalt. The show was well received by critics and had a global fanbase, but the lead duo made the decision to cancel it after two seasons and return to other projects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nABC's \"Pushing Daisies\" was unlike anything else on TV when it started in 2007.\n\nSeasons: 2 (2007-2009)\n\nWhat it was about: This fantasy-comedy series follows Ned, a pie maker who can bring dead things back to life with a simple touch. If he fails to \"kill\" them with the same touch within a minute, someone else will die. But it gets really complicated when he brings a murder victim back to life and decides to let her live.\n\nWhy we loved it: This quirky, dark, funny show — with its eccentric characters and whimsical design — was unlike anything else on TV at the time, and it still remains unmatched. The series won seven Emmys and a DGA award and received three Golden Globe nominations in just two years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Party Down\" on Starz had a rock-star cast.\n\nSeasons: 2 (2009-2010)\n\nWhat it was about: A group of caterers in Los Angeles are all trying to make it in Hollywood, and some are more miserable about it than others.\n\nWhy we loved it: \"Party Down\" starred actors including Jane Lynch, Adam Scott, Lizzy Caplan, Martin Starr, and Ken Marino, and its storylines and characters were somehow both ridiculous yet realistic. Sadly, while it was well received by critics, its network, Starz, just didn't have the platform the comedy needed to be a hit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Brothers & Sisters\" on ABC was an often-heavy family drama with another all-star cast.\n\nSeasons: 5 (2006-2011)\n\nWhat it was about: A big, sprawling family works through their problems — mostly in their big, sprawling family home — while their mom, played by Sally Field, tries to hold them together after the death of her husband.\n\nWhy we loved it: The drama! The relationships! Multiple plotlines meandered alongside each other. It had a dazzling cast, including Field, Callista Flockhart, Rob Lowe, and Matthew Rhys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"One Tree Hill,\" which aired on the WB and the CW, covered some heavy topics for a high school drama.\n\nSeasons: 9 (2003-2012)\n\nWhat it was about: Two half brothers grow up on different sides of the track, but their worlds collide when they both join the high school basketball team. Their lives begin to intertwine as love, drama, friendship, and family comes to the forefront in the small town of Tree Hill, North Carolina.\n\nWhy we loved it: \"One Tree Hill\" was the quintessential high school soap opera that highlighted real-world problems teenagers were facing at the time. Although some plots were far-fetched, others were moving, covering topics of stalking, sexual assault, and school shootings. The series also launched the careers of some notable stars like Sophia Bush and Chad Michael Murray.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Enlightened\" on HBO was named the best series of its time and won Laura Dern a Golden Globe.\n\nSeasons: 2 (2011-2013)\n\nWhat it was about: Laura Dern plays a woman who goes through a philosophical awakening after the breakdown of her career. The show follows her as she attempts to get her life back together.\n\nWhy we loved it: This was a darkly comic show with another stellar cast (Dern won a Golden Globe for her performance). Many, including The AV Club, hailed the series as the best of 2013.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Happy Endings,\" which originally aired on ABC between 2011 and 2013, has recently found a second life on Hulu, Netflix, and HBO Max.\n\nSeasons: 3 (2011-2013)\n\nWhat it was about: The series follows a group of friends living in Chicago who love pop-culture references and ridiculous pranks.\n\nWhy we loved it: For the short time \"Happy Endings\" was on TV, it satiated the need for a hilarious sitcom similar to \"Friends.\" Much like the hit NBC series, \"Happy Endings\" put together an excellent cast and followed them through their day-to-day lives. Although it wasn't as successful as its predecessor, it had some great moments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe real strength of \"Psych\" on the USA Network was that it didn't take itself too seriously.\n\nSeasons: 8 (2008-2014)\n\nWhat it was about: Shawn Spencer possesses incredible powers of observation and deduction, and he manages to convince police detectives that he's a psychic. In each episode, he takes on a new case with help from his best friend, Gus.\n\nWhy we loved it: This network spin on \"Sherlock Holmes\" was crammed with puns and always throwing its characters into absurd situations, all while poking fun at traditional network TV shows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe CW's \"Hart of Dixie\" was comfort viewing, thanks to its setting in a small Southern town, and its endearing characters.\n\nSeasons: 4 (2011-2015)\n\nWhat it was about: Dr. Zoe Hart, played by Rachel Bilson, moves from a busy city to a rural Alabama town to take up a job in a local practice. Predictably, it's not an easy transition, and high jinx and matters of the heart ensue.\n\nWhy we loved it: The show's goofy comedy and lovable, over-the-top characters — all set in a charming fictional town called Bluebell — made this an endearing watch, or, as Buzzfeed put it, \"timeless comfort food.\" Its pilot was panned by some critics, but it went on to secure four seasons and a handful of award nominations. A later stint on Netflix garnered some renewed interest in the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNBC's \"About a Boy\" only lasted for two seasons.\n\nSeasons: 2 (2014-2015)\n\nWhat it was about: When a hippie mom and her 11-year-old son move next door to a successful songwriter (and man child), his life begins to change.\n\nWhy we loved it: Based on the hit book by Nick Hornby, and following a High Grant-led movie by the same name, this network sitcom was a cheesier approach to the well-known premise, but it still pulled at the heartstrings and made us laugh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFox's \"Scream Queens\" was an absurd, over-the-top anthology series with a stellar cast.\n\nSeasons: 2 (2015-2016)\n\nWhat it was about: A serial killer targets a college sorority.\n\nWhy we loved it: \"Scream Queens\" starred Emma Roberts and Lea Michele, and it welcomed guest stars including Ariana Grande and Alan Thicke. The horror comedy was described by Fox's chief operating officer as \"a combination of blood and bubblegum.\" Months before the show was even released, it had a huge social media following.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Good Girls Revolt\" on Amazon was canceled after just one season, ending on a cliffhanger.\n\nSeasons: 1 (2015-2016)\n\nWhat it was about: \"Good Girls Revolt\" is set at a magazine in 1969, just as the women's movement was taking off in the US. A group of hard-working female researchers sue for equal employment rights, claiming the magazine only allowed men to become reporters.\n\nWhy we loved it: This period drama followed a dynamic group of women set against a backdrop of civil unrest. It explored how their desire for equality threw other areas of their lives into doubt. It was a hit, especially among female viewers, so fans were shocked when it didn't get a second season, particularly because it ended in the middle of a major moment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Once Upon a Time\" on ABC brought our favorite fairy-tale characters to life across seven seasons.\n\nSeasons: 7 (2011-2018)\n\nWhat it was about: The residents of Storybrooke, Maine, find out they're characters from famous fairy tales who were forced to live in the real world after a curse.\n\nWhy we loved it: The series brought our favorite fairy-tale characters to life, like Snow White, Prince Charming, and Captain Hook. It even allowed us to dream up a world where fairy tales and reality came together to fight the great battle against evil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Transparent\" on Amazon was groundbreaking.\n\nSeasons: 5 (2014-2019)\n\nWhat it was about: After being the patriarch to her Los Angeles, Jewish family, Maura Pfefferman comes out as a transgender woman.\n\nWhy we loved it: \"Transparent\" gave a voice and visibility to a community that doesn't often get screen time. Even though the lead role was played by a cisgender man (Jeffrey Tambor, who later left the show because of accusations of sexual misconduct, which he denied before apologizing), the series did give several roles to transgender actors, making it a groundbreaking and emotional series.\n\nWhen you buy through our links, Insider may earn an affiliate commission.
