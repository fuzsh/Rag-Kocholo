        "text": "Mary Astor (born May 3, 1906, Quincy, Ill., U.S.—died September 25, 1987, Woodland Hills, Calif.) was an American motion-picture and stage actress noted for her delicate, classic beauty and a renowned profile that earned her the nickname “The Cameo Girl.” With the ability to play a variety of characters ranging from villains to heroines to matrons, Astor worked in film from the silent era to the 1960s.\n\nAstor’s early career was directed by her German-immigrant father, who entered her into a beauty contest at age 14; a year later she appeared in her first film, Sentimental Tommy (1921), although her role was cut from the release print. After a few bit parts in two-reelers, Astor was selected by John Barrymore to costar in Beau Brummel (1924). The two also began a lively, romantic offscreen relationship, with the legendary, 40-year-old Barrymore helping to hone the teenage Astor’s natural acting gifts. After the affair ended, Astor starred again with Barrymore in Don Juan (1926), the first silent movie with sound-on-disc Vitaphone music and sound effects. Perfecting her vocal technique in several stage productions, Astor made a successful transition to talkies.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nAstor performed as leading lady, but in reality she was a character actress. She possessed an intelligent, natural acting style and always managed to rise above lacklustre material. Although her long career included a wide range of roles, she was often typecast as either a beautiful damsel in distress or a sympathetic matron. She demonstrated her acting range, however, in her most famous role: the lovely, devious femme fatale Brigid O’Shaughnessy in John Huston’s film noir masterpiece, The Maltese Falcon (1941), opposite Humphrey Bogart. That same year, her wicked characterization as selfish concert pianist Sandra Kovak in The Great Lie (1941) earned Astor an Oscar for best supporting actress.\n\nAstor’s private life contained its share of drama and notoriety: four marriages, three divorces, alcoholism, suicide attempts, and one of Hollywood’s biggest sex scandals: her 1936 divorce and custody case predicated on her well-publicized affair with playwright George S. Kaufman. Though the scandal threatened Astor’s career, she did much of her best work in the years that followed.\n\nAstor authored two books of memoirs, My Story (1959) and A Life on Film (1971), as well as several works of fiction."
