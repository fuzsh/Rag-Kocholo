        "text": "Take any and every guide to the best Irish films with a pinch of salt (yep, including this one).\n\nWhat one person regards as a great flick another might think is shi… you get the picture.\n\nIn this guide, we’re showing you what we think are the best Irish movies of all time along with the Rotten Tomatoes score for each one!\n\nThe best Irish movies of all time\n\nBelow, you’ll find everything from funny Irish movies and old Irish films to dramas, love stories and more.\n\nThere’s everything from ‘Man About Dog’ and ‘The Van’ to ‘A Bad Day For The Cut’ and some of the best Irish movies that have been on the go for decades.\n\n1. Waking Ned (Rotten Tomatoes Score 84%)\n\nOut of the many Irish films in this guide, Waking Ned is my absolute favourite.\n\nThis is fast-packed comedy directed by Kirk Jones that tackles the popular theme of what happens when someone in the village wins the lottery.\n\nBest pals Jackie O’Shea (Ian Bannen) and Michael O’Sullivan (David Kelly) decide to pay their nouveau-riche neighbour a visit. Alas, they find Ned Devine dead from the shock.\n\nThe village puts their heads together to find a way to make the claim on Devine’s behalf with humorous results.\n\n2. The Field (Rotten Tomatoes Score 43%)\n\nYou’ll see the Field top many guides to the best Irish movies, and for good reason.\n\nDirected by Jim Sheridan, The Field follows the story of “Bull” McCabe (Richard Harris) who finds out that the land he has tended for 30 years is to be auctioned off.\n\nMcCabe is outbid by a rich American (Tom Berenger) who plans to build a factory on the site.\n\nHowever, that’s just the start of the story as McCabe joins forces with son Tadgh McCabe (Sean Bean) in a bid to hold onto the land that means so much to him.\n\n3. The Van (Rotten Tomatoes Score 38%)\n\nThis drama/ comedy starring Donal O’Kelly as “Bimbo” Reeves gives a lighthearted insight into the world of food trucks.\n\nDirected by Stephen Frears, the plot follows Bimbo who is sacked from the bakery where he works and decides to run his own food truck.\n\nHis long-suffering friend Larry (played by Colm Meaney) finds Bimbo a trying boss but when some questionable practices mean they are closed down by the health inspector, their friendship comes apart too.\n\nThis is another one of those Irish films that’s easy to watch and that delivers a clatter of belly laughs throughout.\n\n4. The Wind That Shakes The Barley (Rotten Tomatoes Score 90%)\n\nTopping high in the popularity score, The Wind That Shakes the Barley is a war drama set in the early 1920s against the backdrop of the Irish War of Independence.\n\nDamien (Cillian Murphy) is about to leave Ireland to study as a doctor in London but an attack by brutal Black and Tans (British Forces) leads him to fight alongside his brother Teddy (Padraic Delaney) in the IRA.\n\nHowever, once the peace treaty is signed, Damien finds that he and his brother are estranged. Liam Cunningham plays a supporting role as Dan.\n\nThis is one of the best Irish films when it comes to review scores.\n\n5. Intermission (Rotten Tomatoes Score 74%)\n\nAhh, Intermission. This is an absolute peach of a flick that often fails to make it onto many lists of the best Irish films.\n\nIntermission is a lively crime comedy when Dubliner John (Cillian Murphy from Peaky Blinders) suggests a trial breakup with his girlfriend (Kelly MacDonald).\n\nShe moves on to date a banker and John teams up with small-time crook Lehiff (Colin Farrell) to rob the bank in revenge.\n\nNot all goes to plan as police unravel the plot. Ably directed by John Crowley with a strong cast and storyline.\n\n6. The Commitments (Rotten Tomatoes Score 89%)\n\nBased on the novel by Roddy Doyle, the Commitments is one of the more iconic Irish comedy films. It follows music promoter Jimmy Rabbitte (Robert Arkins) starts his own R&B group in Dublin.\n\nHe brings together an all-white band who, despite an inherent lack of experience with R&B, manage to get themselves noticed.\n\nThat is, until the perils of fame and fortune create fractures right before their big break.\n\nirected by Alan Parker and starring Johnny Murphy as Joey “the Lips” Fagan on trumpet and Angeline Ball as singer Imelda Quirke.\n\nRelated read: Check out our guide to the best Irish movies on Netflix and our guide to the best movies on Netflix Ireland\n\n7. The Young Offenders Movie (No Rotten Tomatoes Score)\n\nThe Young Offenders is an Irish comedy written directed and co-produced by Peter Foott. It started its life as a series and quickly became one of the most popular Irish TV shows to hit our screens.\n\nSet in Cork, friends Conor MacSweeney (Alex Murphy) and Jock Murphy (Chris Walley) could almost be twins.\n\nThey steal bikes and head off on a road trip in search of a missing bale of heroin worth €7 million. After many twists, misunderstandings and adventures, the loveable layabouts end up with a predictable arrest.\n\nFilmed in Cork and along the Wild Atlantic Way, it’s loosely based on a true story! If you like to go off Rotten Tomatoe scores, this is one of the best Irish films ever made.\n\n8. A Bad Day For The Cut (Rotten Tomatoes Score 92%)\n\nThis 2017 Mystery Thriller directed and co-written by Chris Baugh is a tale of revenge with an interesting twist.\n\nMiddle-aged Irish farmer Donal (Nigel O’Neill) sets out to see justice done when his elderly mother Florence (Stella McCusker) is murdered during a home invasion.\n\nIt leads Donal into an unfamiliar criminal underworld as the truth about his mother is uncovered.\n\nI watched this a few years back after seeing it ranked as one of the best Irish films on Rotten Tomatoes – I’ve watched it several times since and it never fails to disappoint.\n\n9.

This first part of a folklore trilogy is directed by Tomm Moore and Nora Twomey.\n\nWhile this is regarded as one of the best Irish movies for kids, it’s also a great watch for adults!\n\n11.

Brooklyn (Rotten Tomatoes Score 97%)\n\nOK, this one doesn’t fall into the ‘Movies About Ireland’ category, but Brooklyn follows a journey that countless Irish men and women took and continue to take.\n\nThis rich period drama has more than a touch of romance.
