        "text": "Mary McCormack is one of today’s boldest and most versatile actresses, continually challenging herself with roles that defy Hollywood standards and bring to light the complex lives of ordinary women. The LA Times says, “McCormack has a kind of 20th century sass, a lively impertinence you find in classic Hollywood comedians like Barbara Stanwyck, Irene Dunne, and Rosalind Russell.” She has shown her immense talent working in film, television and onstage, and has tackled roles ranging from slapstick comedy to intense drama. Tony-nominated for her role in Broadway’s “Boeing-Boeing” opposite Mark Rylance, she is also widely known for her four seasons as a regular cast member of “The West Wing” (two SAG Award nominations), as the lead of USA’s critically acclaimed “In Plain Sight” and for her role opposite Howard Stern in “Private Parts.”\n\nMost recently, Mary stars in both seasons of the hit Starz series “Heels” in which she garnered a Critics Choice Award nomination for Best Lead Actress in an Action Series. Next up, she will appear in the Paramount horror feature, “Vicious.”\n\nMary’s recent television work includes starring roles in ABC’s series, “The Kids Are Alright,” the AMC series “Loaded,” the NBC comedy series “Welcome to the Family,” as well as arcs on such shows as HBO’s “The Newsroom,” “Scandal” (ABC), Gus Van Sant’s award-winning miniseries “When We Rise” (ABC), “House of Lies” (Showtime), and the “Will & Grace” reboot (NBC). Mary will also appear in the new Hulu Blumhouse anthology series, “Treehouse” and “The L Word: Generation Q” for Showtime. Mary can also be seen in the HBO Max feature “Unpregnant.” In non-scripted, Mary produces the hit game show “25 Words or Less” alongside Lisa Kudrow and Dan Bucatinsky, which just aired its fifth season.\n\nAdditional stage credits include a highly successful run opposite Alan Cumming as Sally Bowles in the Sam Mendes and Rob Marshall-directed Broadway production of “Cabaret” for the Roundabout Theatre Company, as well as the acclaimed London stage production of Neil LaBute’s play “Bash;” the David Warren-directed productions of “My Marriage to Ernerst Borgnine;” and Jon Robin Baitz’s “A Fair Country.”\n\nSome of McCormack’s additional television and feature credits include: a recurring role on “ER;” “Right at Your Door;” the Stephen King thriller, “1408;” Christopher Guest’s “For Your Consideration;” the Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney HBO political series, “K Street;” as Justine Appleton in Steve Bochco’s “Murder One,” as well as the USA Network miniseries “Traffic,” directed by Stephen Hopkins (“24”). In addition, McCormack has appeared in varied roles in such films as “Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star” opposite David Spade, “K-Pax,” opposite Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey; “Full Frontal,” directed by Steven Soderbergh and opposite David Duchovny and Catherine Keener, “High Heels & Low Lifes,” with Minnie Driver; “Mystery Alaska,” written by David E. Kelley and starring Russell Crowe; “Other Voices,” with Stockard Channing and Campbell Scott, “The Broken Hearts Club,” opposite John Mahoney and Timothy Olyphant; “The Big Tease,” opposite Craig Ferguson; “Gun Shy” with Sandra Bullock and Liam Neeson; the Clint Eastwood film, “True Crime;” Mimi Leder’s “Deep Impact;” “The Alarmist,” opposite Stanley Tucci; “Father’s Day” and “Miracle on 34th Street.” She also appeared in Michael G. Cooney’s “The Men” and the feature film “Drone” with Sean Bean, as well as Amazon’s period drama “American Girl: Mary Ellen.”\n\nBorn in Plainfield, New Jersey, McCormack is a graduate of Trinity College and resides with her family in Los Angeles."
