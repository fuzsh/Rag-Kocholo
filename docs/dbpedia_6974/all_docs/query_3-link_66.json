        "text": "Katherine G. Johnson, portrayed by Taraji P. Henson\n\nA physicist and mathematician, Katherine G. Johnson worked with NASA in calculating trajectories, launch windows and the return paths for many famous space flights. Her background includes such projects as Project Mercury (the first man to fly into space), 1969's Apollo 11 (first flight to the Moon) and the Space Shuttle program (plans for a mission to Mars).\n\nAt the time of her work, African-Americans and women were not respected in the workplace. In 1953, she was hired by NASA and struggled to receive equal recognition for her work. During her time at NASA, she worked under segregated conditions as a \"computer.\"\n\nStill alive at age 98, Johnson lives in Virginia, where the movie takes place. She saw the movie and enjoyed it. \"It was well done. The three leading ladies did an excellent job portraying us,\" she said, according to The Los Angeles Times.\n\nTaraji P. Henson, who portrays Johnson, said she felt pressure playing someone who is still alive and wanted to make sure she got it right. “And I owe her the truth and all of me,” Henson told The Hollywood Reporter. “I got to sit with her and started studying her mannerisms, and I asked her a lot of questions. What I did find that was parallel in our lives was math, which I hated.”\n\nIt’s ironic Henson is playing a math whiz, as she told THR she was never good at math. “I failed pre-calc,\" Henson said. \"Not calculus, pre-calc! The class that preps you for all the math you have to do.”\n\nDorothy Vaughan, portrayed by Octavia Spencer\n\nA mathematician, Dorothy Vaughan was the first African-American woman to be promoted as a head of personnel at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, later known as NASA. She was the head of the West Area Computers, leading a group of African-American mathematicians through crucial space projects.\n\nOscar winner Octavia Spencer, who plays Vaughan, told THR she knew math and science prior to the role but not to the level of a rocket scientist. “I understood her work to an extent, but she's a rocket scientist and there are very few people in the world who get that type of physics and can work interchangeably in the math disciplines,” Spencer said. “It's a small group of people, and my hat is off to them. I am not a member of that club!”\n\nSpencer said the cast wanted to present these women “in a truthful way” and “in the best light possible.” Since Vaughan died in 2008, the first audience she wanted to impress was the family, and she was proud to learn she did.\n\n“What I learned from playing Dorothy Vaughan is that I have a voice and that I have to use it for people who don't have a voice or whose voice is somehow subdued by whatever's happening in society,” she told THR.\n\nJohn Glenn, portrayed by Glen Powell\n\nJohn Glenn, an astronaut and engineer, was the first American to orbit the Earth and fifth person into space. He received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal and the Congressional Space Medal of Honor and was inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame. He died of a stroke on Dec. 8, 2016, at age 95.\n\nGlenn was unable to see the film due to his health but his family members were supportive. According to upi.com, the director of the film, Ted Melfi said, \"So, his family kept saying: 'He can't right now, he can't right now. He really wants to and he supports the film.’”\n\nGlen Powell, mostly known for his role on Scream Queens, plays the role of Glenn. \"He was a true American hero,\" he told Parade after Glenn died. \"He saw a future for America that a lot of people didn't see. John Glenn had an essence that defined America.\"\n\nLevi Jackson, portrayed by Aldis Hodge\n\nThe husband of Mary Jackson, Levi Jackson is played by Aldis Hodge. Levi Jackson was a civil rights activist who struggled with his wife's efforts in pursuing a career as an engineer and balancing her home life.\n\nHodge prepared for his role by reading Margot Lee Shetterly's book, also titled Hidden Figures, from which the movie was adatped. He's said he tried his best to give his character an accurate portrayal.\n\n\"I tried to play up the honesty of his legacy just off the fact that he was a very kind-natured soul, as a family man,\" he said in an AOL web series interview. \"He supported his wife — supported her in a very avant-garde way given the time frame. This is the '60s, so I loved what he represented and what they represented. So I was just trying to give some truth to that and made sure I did him some justice.\"\n\nPaul Stafford, portrayed by Jim Parsons\n\nPaul Stafford is a fictional character representing a number of white engineers at NASA for whom Katherine Johnson worked. A statistician and theorist, Stafford has no interest in giving up his white male privileges.\n\nJim Parsons, best known for the TV series The Big Bang Theory, plays the role. “My favorite part of it is, it is really layered,” Parsons said, according to Rotten Tomatoes. “Space exploration was a very important human event. You have a civil rights issue playing out with the way African-Americans are being treated. You have a gender equality issue playing out with the way women are being treated. It’s this triangle of three major things, three major things that are still with us today as a society.”"
