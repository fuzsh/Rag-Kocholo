KellerMusic byQuincy JonesDistributed by20th Century Fox\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n92 minutesCountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishBudget$3.5 million[1]Box office$4.1 million (US/ Canada rentals)[2][3][a]\n\nJohn and Mary is a 1969 American romantic drama film directed by Peter Yates (directly following the success of his film Bullitt), and starring Dustin Hoffman and Mia Farrow in the title roles (directly following their successes in Midnight Cowboy and Rosemary's Baby, respectively). It was the film debut of Tyne Daly.[1] The screenplay was adapted by John Mortimer from the 1966 Mervyn Jones novel.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn and Mary begins the morning after John and Mary meet in a bar, during a conversation about Jean-Luc Godard's Weekend, and go home with each other. The story unfolds during the day as they belatedly get to know each other over breakfast, lunch and dinner. Flashbacks of their previous bad relationships are interspersed throughout when something in their conversation brings the thought up.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nMia Farrow as Mary\n\nDustin Hoffman as John\n\nMichael Tolan as James\n\nOlympia Dukakis as John's Mother\n\nStanley Beck as Ernest\n\nTyne Daly as Hillary\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film premiered at the Sutton Theatre in New York City on Sunday, December 14, 1969, and opened the following day.[4][5] It received an R rating upon its original release, but was re-rated PG in 1973.[citation needed]\n\nIn February 1969, before the release of the film, both Hoffman and Farrow made the cover of Time, with the headline: \"The Young Actors: Stars and Anti-Stars\". This marked and celebrated new actors like Hoffman and Farrow (both hot off their successes in The Graduate and Rosemary's Baby, respectively) as significant to their generation.[6][7]\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, \"John and Mary is supposed to be a contemporary movie, I guess, and yet it's curiously out of touch. John and Mary shadow box uneasily with the American language, trying to sound like all people their age without sounding too much like any particular person.\"[8]\n\nVincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, \"There is nothing wrong with the idea of 'John and Mary,' just with its execution. John Mortimer's screenplay is short-focused, its action confined mostly to John's apartment where John and Mary eat, talk and lie about with such dreary verisimilitude that you eventually find yourself less interested in John and Mary than in the settings, clothes and objects that surround them.\"[9]\n\nRotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 38%, based on 13 reviews.[10]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to Fox records, the film required $6,300,000 in rentals to break even, and by December 11, 1970, it had made $8,150,000, resulting in a profit to the studio.[11]\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nWon:\n\n1970 BAFTA Award, Best Actor – Dustin Hoffman (For Midnight Cowboy and John and Mary)[12]\n\nNominated:\n\n1970 BAFTA Award, Best Actress – Mia Farrow (For: Rosemary's Baby, Secret Ceremony and John and Mary)[12]\n\n1970 Golden Globes, Best Actor, Musical/Comedy – Dustin Hoffman[13]\n\n1970 Golden Globes, Best Actress, Musical/Comedy – Mia Farrow[13]\n\n1970 Golden Globes, Best Screenplay – John Mortimer[13]\n\n1970 WGA Awards, Best Adapted Screenplay – John Mortimer[14]\n\nMusical score and soundtrack\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn and MarySoundtrack album by Released1970Recorded1969GenreFilm scoreLength31:10LabelA&M\n\nSP-4230ProducerQuincy JonesQuincy Jones chronology\n\nCactus Flower\n\n(1969) John and Mary\n\n(1970) Gula Matari\n\n(1970)\n\nThe film score was composed, arranged and conducted by Quincy Jones, and the soundtrack, featuring vocalists Evie Sands, The Strange Things, Jeff Bridges, The Morgan Ames Singers and four classical pieces performed by a brass ensemble, was released on the A&M label in 1970.[15][16]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nAll compositions by Quincy Jones except where noted\n\n\"Maybe Tomorrow (Vocal)\" (Lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman) − 3:10\n\n\"Bump in the Night\" − 1:58\n\n\"Lost in Space\" (Jeff Bridges) − 3:15\n\n\"Silent Movies\" − 2:11\n\n\"Maybe Tomorrow\" (Lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman) − 4:18\n\n\"Main Title\" − 2:48\n\n\"22nd Fugue for Well-Tempered Clavichord\" (Johann Sebastian Bach) − 1:31\n\n\"Rondo No. 1\" (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) − 1:58\n\n\"Opus 54, Variations Serieuses\" (Felix Mendelssohn) − 2:05\n\n\"Allegro from Royal Fireworks Suite\" (George Frideric Handel) − 3:58\n\n\"Maybe Tomorrow\" − 3:58\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nUnidentified orchestra arranged and conducted by Quincy Jones\n\nEvie Sands (track 1), The Strange Things (track 2), Jeff Bridges (track 3), The Morgan Ames Singers (track 5) − vocals\n\nThe John and Mary Brass Ensemble (tracks 7–11)\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of American films of 1969\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
