        "text": "When John Waters unleashed Pink Flamingos for public consumption in 1972, the response from critics was polarized (to say the absolute least).\n\n“One of the sickest American movies ever made,” Fran Lebowitz decried in Interview. “And also one of the funniest.” New York dubbed Water’s film “beyond pornography,” while Variety called it “one of the most vile, stupid, and repulsive films ever made.” But of all the reviews Waters pored over, his favorite came courtesy of the Detroit Free Press: “Like a septic tank explosion, [Pink Flamingos] has to be seen to be believed.”\n\n“Even the underground press took a while to embrace me,” Waters laughs. “[But] I always knew it could be a hit if the right people saw it.”\n\nPink Flamingos has become so much more than “an exercise in bad taste,” as the film’s tagline proudly declares. Last year, the Library of Congress added the title to its National Film Registry (alongside the less scatological Strangers on a Train and Cooley High), and this week, the Criterion Collection’s special Blu-Ray release of the film comes out, curated by Waters and meticulously restored from his original 16mm cut.\n\nWhile Hairspray might have earned the filmmaker a veneer of mainstream respectability, Pink Flamingos remains the crowning jewel in his debauched filmography. Starring his childhood friend and muse Divine, a 300-pound drag queen in cha-cha heels, the film ostensibly follows two groups of social outcasts competing for the title of “Filthiest People Alive” in ’70s Baltimore.\n\nPink Flamingos is certainly not for the faint of heart—the sins committed onscreen include, but are in no way limited to, rape, murder, incest, cannibalism, bestiality, and necrophilia. Filmed over six months on a $10,000 budget, the film remains just as shockingly repulsive now as it did 50 years ago. A recent screening of the Criterion cut at New York’s IFC Center—featuring an appearance by Waters—drew a sold-out crowd of mostly 20-somethings, many of whom were seeing the film for the first time while gripping their complimentary “Pink Phlegm-ingo” barf bags for dear life.\n\n“It feels great to see that my stuff is still resonating all these years later,” Waters recently told Vogue. “I’m still finding ways to corrupt a whole new generation!”\n\nThe filmmaker has even found new mediums. This May saw the release of Water’s long-gestating debut novel, Liarmouth, and although he hasn’t returned to the director’s chair since A Dirty Shame in 2004, Waters has kept busier than ever with his annual Christmas tour, his yearly summer camp for adults, and even a recent Calvin Klein campaign with his Pink Flamingos star Mink Stole.\n\nTo celebrate 50 years of filth, Vogue hopped on the phone with Waters to chat about his favorite Divine memories, the one scene a Pink Flamingos star refused to film, and why perverts “have to stick together.”\n\nVogue: I read that you dreamt up Pink Flamingos on a road trip to California while driving through a trailer park community. How did the concept develop from there?\n\nJohn Waters: I had just seen Boom!, one of my favorite Elizabeth Taylor movies. She plays this terminally ill woman locked in a mansion on a private island, writing her memoirs. [The film] mostly sprang from that, and seeing so many trailer parks everywhere across America. Divine and I watched Boom! all the time when we were young, so we imagined what it might look if Divine were hiding out in a trailer. I loved that tacky “pink flamingo” aesthetic because it was just so extreme. I also wanted to give it a very innocuous title that could mean anything.\n\nWere there any particular film trends of that era you were trying to satirize?\n\nI was trying to make an exploitation film for art theaters, which is a genre that I ultimately helped create! I was satirizing the idea of exploitation movies, but I knew I was also making an underground movie. And since this is Vogue, I definitely wanna talk about the influence of our costume designer Van Smith.\n\nDid you see that the final look in Balenciaga’s spring 2022 show was basically a copy of Divine’s red balloon dress?\n\nAnd that’s not a coincidence! The Balenciaga team played the Pink Flamingos theme song in the background! It’s not just me having delusions of grandeur. That dress was on the cover of Vanity Fair, and Isabelle Huppert wore it to the Met Ball last year. It’s so thrilling because that dress really is so iconic.\n\nIt’s impossible to get through an episode of RuPaul’s Drag Race without seeing Divine’s influence on most of the contestants.\n\nWell, I think Divine made drag queens hipper because they were really square before he came along. Van and I wanted Divine’s look to scare hippies, because those are the people who went to see underground movies. If you watch that documentary The Queen, all of those drag queens wanted to be Miss America. They were all trying to dress like their mothers back then, but Divine didn’t wanna be a woman—he wanted to be Godzilla!\n\nSome of the Pink Flamingos stories in your book Shock Value are just as shocking as the movie. What do you remember most about the experience?\n\nThat it was a lot of hard work. Everybody always thought we were like those people, when in fact nobody was. We’d all be in prison if we were like that! We’d work 20 hours straight, and some days the film wouldn’t develop so we’d have to reshoot everything the next day. It was also freezing because we shot in the middle of winter, so you can see everyone’s breath in a lot of shots. It was not fun, but it was satisfying.\n\nI’m sure it helped that you and most of the cast had already made movies together and had a sense of camaraderie.\n\nAnd we only got closer. Divine was an incredibly shy guy who just liked to smoke pot all day. I certainly wrote Pink Flamingos under the influence of marijuana, but nobody was on drugs when we made the movie. Danny Mills and Mary Vivian Pierce were freshly in love at the time, so those are the memories that flood back to me when I watch it. But I wouldn’t call us a happy-go-lucky bunch. We were all influenced by radical politics and rioting, so we were driven, but we were also looking for trouble.\n\nWas there anything in the script an actor refused to do?\n\nMink refused to let me set her hair on fire. I’d written a scene where her hair turned so red that it burst into flames. Mink goes, “Well how are we gonna do that?” and I said, “Well, we’ll light you on fire and throw a bucket of water when I say cut.” She thankfully said “No fucking way.” I wasn’t trying to be evil, I was just on pot!\n\nI read that Divine actually got arrested for stealing steaks during filming—\n\nDivine sometimes stole things like steaks, but I don’t think he did it that way. Once he walked into a store and got caught stealing the covers off a director’s chair. I said, “You don’t even own a director’s chair! What were you thinking?” He had no idea—he was on pot too.\n\nWhat’s your favorite Divine memory from shooting?\n\nI love when Divine walks down the streets of downtown Baltimore and the movie turns into a documentary. We drove downtown and when I yelled action, Divine would hop out of the car and we’d shoot him walking down the street. It was the middle of winter on a weekday and Divine was walking down the street in a cocktail gown. All of those people's alarmed expressions when he walks by are genuine. They recognized that the filthiest person alive had appeared in front of them!\n\nWere there many instances like that, where the real world bled into filming?\n\nNo, we weren’t in public much at all. We stayed hidden because we were scared. I filmed a nude hitchhiker scene for [1969’s] Mondo Trasho and got some of us arrested for conspiracy to commit indecent exposure. It was a nationwide news story, and the American Civil Liberties Union ended up handling our case. That’s why we shot the trailer stuff in the middle of nowhere up at my friend Bob Adam’s farm.\n\nI read that your original cut of the film ran for two and a half hours. What do you remember of the scenes that got cut?\n\nWe filmed a subplot where Cookie gets murdered that was too violent and not very funny. There were also a lot of scenes where characters talked for 10 minutes that just felt unnecessary. But we include some of them in this Criterion release for people to finally see. There’s also a documentary where we go back to the places we filmed in and tell the people who live there now about the atrocities that occurred in their homes. I don’t wanna give anything away, but just know that I continue Divine’s curse.\n\nYou’re obviously a hometown hero now, but did you always feel embraced by the Baltimore community? Particularly during the Pink Flamingos era?\n\nEven before Pink Flamingos. When I rented screening halls and threw premieres, the Baltimore community always came out and sold out my shows. The press always wrote about me and my work even when they hated it—especially when they hated it.\n\nHow was the premiere that you threw at the University of Baltimore?\n\nI remember wearing a leopard-print shirt that Divine made for me. Everyone who had anything to do with the movie came—even the dog! It belonged to Pat Moran [Water’s longtime casting director] and made a star appearance on a leash. We scheduled three shows each on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and all of them sold out.\n\nDid you think at that time, “Maybe this thing could be a hit…”\n\nI knew it would be a hit after I saw it at the premiere. Everyone reacted and laughed at all the right moments, and I always knew it could be a hit if the right people saw it. But it was quite a struggle between the premiere and Pink Flamingos finally opening in New York City two years later.\n\nWhat can you tell me about your experiences with the secretary of the Maryland Censor Board, Mary Avara?\n\nShe helped the movie, in a way, because she would get movies national attention by speaking out publicly against the ones she hated and saying shit like, “Don’t try and tell me about sex, I was married to an Italian!” I still have the receipt for a cunnilingus scene she made me cut out of Female Trouble. But censors have never given me too much hassle because they know I only make fun of things I love. The right people still win in my movie, no matter how debauched either side is.\n\nHow would you characterize the audiences who first made Pink Flamingos a hit?\n\nGay people, bikers, rednecks—basically angry people with a good sense of humor. And they were all definitely high when they saw it. Those are still my best audiences! The people who tend to like my movies don’t judge others and like to visit worlds they’ve never inhabited before.\n\nIn retrospect, are there any scenes in the film that you regret, or think went too far?\n\nMaybe the chicken scene, but only because of what I put Cookie through.\n\nNot the chicken?\n\nWe bought it at a market that advertised “freshly killed chickens,” so they were about to cut its neck and hand it over to us. Instead, it got to have simulated sex in a movie and become famous! You could honestly argue that we made that chicken’s life better.\n\nI watched the film with a vegetarian friend at the IFC screening, and he almost had to leave the room during that scene. It was more shocking to him than anything else.\n\nPink Flamingos was banned in the United Kingdom for a while, and every few years it would get resubmitted to their ratings board. A scene would usually get put back in based on the argument that it’s a gross-out comedy. The chicken scene was the last of five cuts that got approved so that Pink Flamingos could finally be screened in the U.K. uncensored. I think it happened because someone made the case that we ate the chicken afterwards.\n\nWas there ever a time when you resented the film’s success? Or, at least, the expectations it placed on you to out-filth yourself?\n\nNo, but I think Divine did. I always said that Divine could never live Pink Flamingos down and I could never live up to it. He’s really good in the movie, but nobody ever wanted to talk to him about acting. I think he got sick of talking about eating dog shit. That scene is just him being a great stunt performer. He did it because it was in the script and when you make your first movies, you really go out on a limb to get noticed. I think it worked beyond anything he could have imagined.\n\nThe film’s reputation is so intertwined with the content, but Divine gives a legitimately great performance in it. His comedic timing is flawless.\n\nHe gives an incredible performance, and I think that’s why he was weary of talking about eating shit. But he also liked the movie and was very proud of it, as am I. I still wanna make people laugh and surprise them in filthy ways, but I never felt the need to try and top Pink Flamingos because I felt I’d made my point.\n\nOne other thing I meant to ask about were some of the film’s one-scene roles, like the “singing asshole” man or the woman in the park who flashes her penis. How did you cast them?\n\nThat woman’s name is Elizabeth Coffey. She’s a great comedian who used to be a hippy chick in Baltimore and became one of the first trans women to get gender confirmation surgery under Dr. John Money, who was a famous doctor that got discredited by Oprah. David [Lochary] plays a flasher, so in the scene she’s supposed to flash her breasts, he flashes his dick, and then she flashes her dick. Elizabeth is a great friend and said, “I wanna own that joke!” She had her operation three days after we shot that scene and then came back to show her vagina in [1974’s] Female Trouble—just a hint to let audiences know what she’d been up to.\n\nDo you still keep in touch?\n\nI'm still friends with all of the people from Pink Flamingos who are living. When I gave my entire art collection to the Baltimore Museum of Art, they said they wanted to name a rotunda after me, but I said, “No, I want the bathrooms named after me!” They thought I was kidding, but I kept insisting that I wasn’t, and the museum named its first gender-neutral bathroom after me. Elizabeth came down to cut the ribbon and took the first piss to christen it!\n\nCould you have imagined you and your Dreamland crew would be attending ribbon-cutting ceremonies and booking Calvin Klein campaigns 50 years after Pink Flamingos?\n\nI didn’t think it was impossible. I was never some kind of idiot savant, but I am ambitious. I read Variety when I was 14! When I watch Pink Flamingos now, I just think, How did we do that? But when you’re young and dumb you just kinda go for it.\n\nWhy do you think Pink Flamingos is still so effective as a piece of gross-out art today?\n\nBecause it’s funny and it brings outsiders together. I’ve never been a separatist—the perverts have to stick together! And I think Pink Flamingos really united the perverts of the world. I just did that Q&A at IFC, and the audience was one of the youngest I’ve ever had. People were thanking me, saying that it made them feel good about themselves when they were younger, and a lot of them weren’t even born when I made A Dirty Shame, much less Pink Flamingos.\n\nHow have fan reactions to the film changed over the years?\n\nThe main difference now is that people tell me their parents showed them the movie. Parents used to call the police if their kids watched Pink Flamingos. I asked the audience at IFC how many of them were seeing it for the first time, and a shocking amount raised their hands. At first I thought “Uh-oh…” But everyone seemed to enjoy themselves, which was really comforting."
