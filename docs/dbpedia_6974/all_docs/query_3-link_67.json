        "text": "Emily Blunt and John Krasinski went on their first date in 2008\n\nThey got married in July 2010 at George Clooney's Lake Como estate\n\nBlunt and Krasinski are parents to two daughters, Hazel and Violet\n\nThey have collaborated on several films as costars and producers, including A Quiet Place trilogy\n\nEmily Blunt and John Krasinski are one of Hollywood's most iconic duos, both on-screen and off.\n\nThe actors first met at a Los Angeles restaurant in 2008 and wed two years later. They've since welcomed daughters Hazel and Violet.\n\nKrasinski admitted on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2011 that he \"wasn't really looking for a relationship\" when he first came to L.A., but Blunt quickly changed his mind.\n\n\"Then I met her and I was so nervous. I was like, 'Oh god, I think I'm going to fall in love with her,' \" he shared, adding that their instant chemistry was undeniable. \"It's one of those things where as soon as you meet someone you kind of know.\"\n\nFrom their first date to their costarring debut, here's a complete timeline of Emily Blunt and John Krasinski's relationship.\n\nJune 2006: John Krasinski watches Emily Blunt's movie\n\nAlthough the pair hadn't met yet, The Office star became a fan of his future wife when The Devil Wears Prada premiered in June 2006. Krasinski later admitted to Blunt that he watched it on repeat — over 70 times to be exact.\n\nIn a 2016 interview with Glamour, the actor recalled how after the couple had been dating for a bit, Blunt asked him if he'd ever seen the movie.\n\n\"I said, 'Yes,' and she said, 'How many times?' And I said, 'A lot.' She said, 'What's a lot?' And I said, '75 times,' \" he said. \"I'm lucky enough that she stayed with me and didn't realize that she had really married her stalker!\"\n\nNovember 2008: Emily Blunt and John Krasinski first meet\n\nDuring a night out in L.A., the pair first met through a friend. As Blunt would later say on Late Night with Seth Meyers in 2018, Krasinski had been sitting with actor Justin Theroux before spotting their mutual friend and making his way over to her table.\n\n\"It's kind of a sad, lame story. I was in a restaurant, he was in the restaurant. I was sitting with a mutual friend,\" Blunt told the host. \"And my friend Gray goes 'Oh my god, that's my friend John.' And that was it. He was sitting with our friend Justin Theroux, and he abandoned Justin and came over to us. He just stood there and made me laugh.\"\n\nLate 2008: Emily Blunt and John Krasinski go on their first date\n\nKrasinski told The Hollywood Reporter that it took some convincing after they met for Blunt to agree to a date. However, the actress disagreed, and said she was actually the one who asked Krasinski out first.\n\nFor their first date, the pair met for pizza at his apartment. And as the couple told THR, something else happened at their initial meetup that they've decided to keep just for them.\n\n\"It's so precious, I don't want to talk about it,\" Blunt said. \"Is that all right?\"\n\nAugust 2009: Emily Blunt and John Krasinski get engaged\n\nAfter less than a year together, a rep for Krasinski confirmed to PEOPLE that the couple was engaged in August 2009.

Blunt wore a custom gown by Marchesa, accessorized with a three-carat round diamond and platinum ring from Neil Lane.\n\nKrasinski later revealed to Elle in 2016 how Clooney offered up his estate to the couple.\n\n\"Only on the fourth ask did I say yes. Because the first three times I thought, There's no way he is serious,\" he shared. \"But I started to see his feelings get hurt. I actually hurt George Clooney's feelings.\"\n\nAugust 2010: Emily Blunt and John Krasinski attend the Emmy Awards\n\nA month after getting married, the newlyweds attended the Emmy Awards together, posing for pictures on the red carpet and at AMC's Emmy afterparty, where they smiled next to Krasinski's fellow NBC stars Amy Poehler and Ed Helms.\n\nApril 2013: Emily Blunt says meeting John Krasinski changed her life\n\nIn April 2013, Blunt was featured on the cover of InStyle's May issue, where she shared a glimpse into her marriage with Krasinski.\n\n\"Meeting John really changed my life,\" she said. \"When I feel the support that I have from him, I feel invincible.

It's like a superpower that she can just unlock and do so specifically with not many attempts.\"\n\nKrasinski also compared his own acting skills to Blunt's, saying that while he loves his profession, his wife is \"on another plane.\"\n\n\"This weird intersection happened while filming where I totally forgot I was her husband.
