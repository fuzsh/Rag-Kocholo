        "text": "Gaza\n\nDonna and Admiral Fitzwallace (recurring guest star John Amos) travel with a few Congressmen to the hotly disputed Gaza Strip on a fact-finding mission, trying to sort through the rival issues between the Palestinians and Israelis. But the killing fields soon claim some members of the delegation when a deadly bomb shatters their vehicle, prompting Bartlet to consider targets for military action. In flashbacks, Donna is attracted to a dashing British photojournalist, Goran Marik (Jason Isaacs - \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\"), who reveals to her his graphic world of recording mankind's most heinous acts of violence.\n\nMemorial Day\n\nIn the season finale, after the murders of high-ranking U.S. officials in the explosive Gaza Strip, Bartlet weighs appropriate military action. A wary Josh meets with a mysterious foreign operative while tending to Donna, who is fighting for her life.\n\nTalking Points\n\nOn the eve of the President's controversial trade summit meeting in Brussels, Josh is troubled when he learns that Bartlet will reverse his position concerning the loss of American jobs to foreign nations. C.J. is frustrated with a new Federal Communications Commission ruling allowing multimedia companies increased ownership of TV stations. Meanwhile, the administration tries to downplay job-loss statistics, and Donna tells Josh about her dissatisfaction with her limited role on his staff. During all of this, Bartlet meets Kate Harper (recurring guest star Mary McCormack - \"K Street,\" \"Private Parts\"), the brash, new deputy national security advisor.\n\nNo Exit\n\nAfter attending a formal dinner at another location, Bartlet and his staff return to the White House and experience an emergency quarantine inside the West Wing when the environmental hazard monitor detects a dangerous foreign substance. The unexpected lockdown creates odd couplings of people forced to occupy small rooms together. Isolated with Will, Toby accuses his former assistant of backstabbing Bartlet. As Secret Service agents and hazardous materials inspectors search for the source of the anomaly, the President, Fiderer (recurring guest star Lily Tomlin) and Charlie submit to physical examinations, while in another room C.J. gives Donna strong career advice. And stuck with security adviser Kate (recurring guest star Mary McCormack), Josh queries her on why one of his jokes was deleted from Bartlet's speech--and gets an unexpected response.\n\nRun\n\nWith Rebecca again tasked with defending ACN in a possible lawsuit, Will tries to protect Neal from the fallout over the DOD leak. Charlie and Leona enter the fray of a hostile-takeover gambit involving Reese's half-siblings, Blair and Randy Lansing. Sloan fears Don may be guilty of cashing in on insider information; Maggie ponders the ethics of eavesdropping; Hallie pays a price for a late-night tweet."
