Will he be able to win her back over?\n\nSeries 3 (2007)\n\nTowards the end of this series Doc Martin and Louisa finally go on a date. They find the perfect spot for romance... but the clumsy doctor manages to ruin the moment with an inappropriate remark.\n\nSeries 4 (2009)\n\nLife in the beautiful Cornish village of Portwenn has become ever more infuriating for Martin since the heart-wrenching decision to call off his marriage to local headmistress Louisa. Will he take up a job offer in London?\n\nSeries 5 (2011)\n\nIn this series the doc has a dilemma: how to cope with being a new dad while trying to resume his high-flying career as a surgeon.\n\nSeries 7 (2015)\n\nFollowing the upheavals of Series 6, can Martin and Louisa get their relationship back on track?\n\nSeries 10 (2022)\n\nThis final series sees the Doc making efforts to overcome his phobia and beginning to question whether he made the right decision about resigning - he and Louisa have also welcomed a baby daughter, Mary Elizabeth, who is a sister for four-year-old James Henry."
