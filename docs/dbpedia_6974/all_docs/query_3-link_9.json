        "text": "Nobody claims that the apostle John was a son of Mary, though (in Protestant circles) James is identified as one of four half-brothers of Jesus. In his home town, his teaching amazed the locals who said,\n\n“Isn’t this the carpenter? Isn’t this Mary’s son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon? Aren’t his sisters here with us?” (Mark 6:3)\n\nOf course, this James was not the apostle James. Four men called James are mentioned in the New Testament. The writer of the epistle of James could not have been the apostle James due to that apostle having died in A.D. 44, before the epistle was written. It is believed that, after Jesus’ death and resurrection, his half-brother James became a Christian. And that is the reason why Jesus did not charge James with care of Mary as he was dying on the cross.\n\nJesus was the eldest son, with James being next. Naturally, James should have taken care of Mary as it seems that Jospeh had died before then. This is gleaned from Mark 3:20-21 & 31-32:\n\n“When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of [Jesus], for they said, ‘He is out of his mind.’ …Then Jesus’ mother and brothers arrived. Sanding outside, they sent someone in to call him.”\n\nBut if James (and his other half-brothers) were not followers of Jesus, thinking him to be ‘out of his mind’, there was no way Jesus as eldest son would want non-believers in him as the Messiah to care for Mary. He knew John was true in his belief and love. Both he and Mary were there at the cross. That is why he charged John with care of his mother. He knew his resurrection would follow, but until that happened his dear mother’s heart would be broken, as had been prophesied by old Simeon who held the 40-day-old baby Jesus in his arms. For Mary, it would be as if a sword pierced her, and surely that happened as she saw Jesus crucified. Knowing her grief, and the faithful love of John, he entrusted Mary to the one best equipped to help her through this trauma. It would not be until later that James would become a follower of Jesus.\n\nThis reminds us of Jesus’ response years earlier to his brothers trying to take him away, thinking he was out of his mind. When told that “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you”, he responded, “My mother and brothers are those who hear God’s word and put it into practice” (Luke 8:20-21). This implies that Jesus did not regard them as being spiritually sound, but the apostle John certainly was. And John was his brother due to having heard God’s word and put it into practice. Therefore, to John he entrusted the care of his mother, and not to his half-brother, James.\n\nIf Mary had had other sons besides Jesus, it would have made little sense to assign John to be her son. But let's look at the Biblical evidence.\n\nIs not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? (Matthew 13:55)\n\nIs not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him. (Mark 6:3)\n\nNote that these texts carefully avoid any connection of the brothers and sisters of Jesus to Mary, Jesus' mother. There is no text in the Bible that would indicate or confirm that Mary had any other children. The Bible, in similar fashion, carefully sets Joseph apart from a direct fatherhood connection with Jesus.\n\nNow the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. (Matthew 1:18)\n\nAnd when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. (Matthew 2:13)\n\nAnd Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him. (Luke 2:33)\n\nAnd when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it. (Luke 2:43)\n\nNone of those passages says Joseph was Jesus' father--because, of course, Jesus was not fathered by man. But why does the writer take time to say \"Joseph and his mother\" instead of simply saying \"Jesus' parents\"? The Bible is careful with identities where these are important. And it is important that a Bible student take notice, and interpret correctly.\n\nIn similar fashion, the Bible does not state that Jesus' brothers were the sons of Mary. Having just named Mary, it could have said \"mother of James and Joses....etc.\" But that is not what it says. There is a reason for this.\n\nBy the time Jesus began his public ministry, Joseph had passed away--which is why we do not see or hear of Joseph at the wedding in Cana, as being among those waiting to see Jesus outside the crowd, at the cross, or upon any occasion during Jesus' ministry.\n\nThe other children of Joseph, for whom Mary was a step-mother, while still relatives of Mary, were not her blood relatives. She, being a woman, would have faced difficulties within the culture of her day if, following Jesus' death, she had tried to remove herself from her in-laws to seek a more peaceful residence. Jesus, knowing this, gave command that she consider John as her son, and that John take Mary as his mother. John, being close to Jesus, immediately understood the command, and took her to his home, caring for her as his own mother. This brought relief to Mary's mind, for Jesus' word gave legitimacy to her move.\n\nHad Mary had other sons of her own, they would certainly have cared for her, and John's help would have seemed unnecessary. But there is simply no text to indicate that she did.\n\nJesus' brothers were those born to Joseph before his first wife had passed away. They were older than Jesus, which is why they felt especially upset when Jesus did not listen to them and follow their directions. When Jesus said \"My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it\" (Luke 8:21), he implied that those outside the crowd waiting to speak with him (they had something they wanted to tell him to do) were his family only as much as they followed his messages from God. Jesus was turning the tables--giving them instruction when they had come to give him instruction.\n\nWithin the culture of that day, it would have been unthinkable to seek to instruct a superior. This is why Jesus himself, as a twelve-year-old boy in the temple, merely asked questions of the teachers (see Luke 2:46-47). He could not directly instruct them, but through his questions he showed that he had a more thorough understanding than they had--and they learned from his innocent questionings.\n\nTherefore, when we see that Jesus' brothers attempted to tell him what to do, we know that they were older than he was. And that is just what we see in John 7:3.\n\nHis brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest. (John 7:3)\n\nThough Jesus loved and respected his brothers, he had a mission which they did not understand; and he followed his Father's will over theirs.\n\nClearly, as Jesus' brothers were older, and as Jesus was the firstborn of Mary (see Matthew 1:25), the brothers could not have been Mary's sons.\n\nThis is why Jesus, in perfect filial love and understanding of his mother's needs, assigned John to Mary."
