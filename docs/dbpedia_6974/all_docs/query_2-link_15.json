        "text": "Mary Steenburgen (born February 8, 1953, Newport, Arkansas, U.S.) is an American actress who is known for her charming and gentle demeanor in a wide variety of roles ranging from comic to villainous and from long-suffering to authoritative.\n\nSteenburgen grew up in Arkansas and performed in high-school plays. She briefly attended Hendrix College in Conway, Arkansas, before moving in 1972 to New York City to study at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre. She cofounded an improvisational comedy troupe with other graduates of the school before being cast by Jack Nicholson as a spinster who saves his character from the gallows in the little-seen western comedy Goin’ South (1978). She played opposite Malcolm McDowell (who portrayed H.G. Wells) in the time-travel film Time After Time (1979). In her third movie, Melvin and Howard (1980), Steenburgen’s performance as the winsome go-go dancer married to the hapless dreamer Melvin Dummar (played by Paul Le Mat) won her both a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award as best supporting actress. She played a prim matriarch in Miloš Forman’s Ragtime (1981), based on the 1975 novel by E.L. Doctorow, and the writer Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings in the biopic Cross Creek (1983). Steenburgen was nominated for a BAFTA award for her portrayal of Nicole Diver in the 1985 television miniseries Tender Is the Night, based on the novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nSteenburgen’s later films included the comedy Miss Firecracker (1989), Ron Howard’s Parenthood (1989), Back to the Future Part III (1990), What’s Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), Philadelphia (1993), and Oliver Stone’s Nixon (1995). She starred with Ted Danson (her husband from 1995) in the acclaimed two-part TV miniseries Gulliver’s Travels (1996). Steenburgen and Danson also starred in the short-lived TV comedy Ink (1996–97). She later appeared in Life as a House (2001), John Sayles’s Sunshine State (2002), the romance Hope Springs (2003), and the Will Ferrell vehicle Elf (2003). During this time Steenburgen began making guest appearances on the cult favourite television show Curb Your Enthusiasm. She starred with Amber Tamblyn and Joe Mantegna in the 2003–05 TV series Joan of Arcadia. In addition, Steenburgen performed in David Lynch’s dramatic film Inland Empire (2006) and the romantic comedy The Proposal (2009)."
