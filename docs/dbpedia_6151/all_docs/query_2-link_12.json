The announcement accompanied the presentation of BUA Cement’s full-year results, demonstrating a substantial 40.3% increase in revenue, which reached ₦361.9 billion in 2022 from N257.3 billion in 2021.

Shares in the company have more than doubled since the start of the year, lifting the market capitalisation to N13trn ($10.4bn), the largest market value on the #Nigerian exchange. Authorities, under pressure to clear a crippling foreign-exchange backlog, allowed the naira to tumble by 33% on 29 January to hit a record low against the #dollar. 🔵 A Report by David Whitehouse\n\nThe wave of industrialisation blowing accross Africa is very impressive. The concept of value addition is now sinking deep into the hearts of many African governments and the days of raw exports are gradually coming to an end. Having followed closely progress of Ghana's aluminium industry over the past years, I've come to appreciate this new development. Large bauxite volumes exported overseas at <US$ 50 per tonne return to the shores of the country at >US$ 360 as alumina to feed the country's ancient smelter VALCO which faced several operational hurdles in the past. Progress towards developing an integrated aluminium industry in the country is commendable and we look forward to even more policy support especially in the downstream sector to absorb output and close the end of the value chain.\n\nLindian Resources Limited (ASX:LIN, OTC:LINIF) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée (CBG), which positions Lindian’s Gaoual project as a potential contributor to CBG’s annual #bauxite production through a prospective sales contract. CBG is one of the largest single producers of bauxite in the world with operations focused in Guinea and this MoU sets the stage to bolster yearly bauxite output while providing Lindian with an opportunity to commercialise Gaoual. The agreement outlines the initial framework for what could become a lucrative bauxite supply contract, thus paving the way for future collaborations between the two entities.

The project includes the construction of a concentrator plant, a seawater desalination plant, and a desalinated water pumping system. The permitting and construction process will take between seven and eight years, with operations projected to start in 2033. Freeport, which owns 51% of El Abra with Codelco holding the remaining 49%, aims to consolidate its position as a leader in copper production.

Through their expanded their capacity/capabilities, BUA can keep it’s unit cost per production at a minimum, unless there are undisclosed factors influencing their decision. Given the oligopoly market structure of the cement industry in Nigeria, I would expect Dangote to respond promptly to BUA's move. Again, it remains to be seen whether there are any undisclosed factors influencing BUA's decision.\n\n📢 𝐂𝐨𝐫𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐔𝐩𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞: 𝐃𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐭 𝐂𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐋𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐝 (𝐏𝐒𝐗: 𝐃𝐍𝐂𝐂) Dandot Cement Limited (PSX: DNCC) was incorporated as a public limited company in 1980 and began production in 1983.

The company faced challenges including production suspensions, high input costs, and external vulnerabilities. Key highlights include: 2019: Net sales increased by 21.97%, but operational challenges led to minimal gross profit. The company posted a net profit due to significant other income. 2020: Sales declined by 81.42%, and production was suspended, leading to a net loss. 2021-2023: No sales due to plant closure, but administrative expenses were managed, and efforts to rebuild the workforce were noted. 📉 𝗥𝗲𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 (𝟵𝗠𝗙𝗬𝟮𝟰): BMR activities were completed in 1HFY24, with net sales of Rs.1191.56 million in 9MFY24. Despite economic challenges, DNCC posted an operating profit of Rs.61.67 million. The net loss decreased by 31.32% to Rs.129.55 million. 🔮 𝗙𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗢𝘂𝘁𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗸: With the resumption of operations, increased retention prices, and the installation of a solar power plant, DNCC hopes to improve its financial performance in the coming year. However, significant doubts remain about its ability to continue as a going concern due to accumulated losses and current liabilities exceeding current assets.
