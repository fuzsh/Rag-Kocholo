        "text": "Ohorongo Cement operates the only cement factory in Namibia.[1] The Ohorongo Cement Plant is located on Farm Sargberg near Otavi in the Otjozondjupa Region. Today German group Schwenk Zement KG owns 100% of the company, but is investigating Namibian institutional investors.\n\nThe ground breaking ceremony for the construction of the plant was held in January 2009.[2] A roof wetting celebration took place in February 2010, when the preheater tower reached its final height of 109 meters.[3] The commissioning of the plant is scheduled for the end of the year 2010.\n\nThe German company Polysius AG, one of the leading engineering companies equipping the cement and minerals industries, is constructing the plant on a turnkey basis. When in full production, the plant output is estimated at 700 000 tonnes of cement per year. Ohorongo intends to satisfy local demand as well as to export the cement to neighbouring countries.\n\nReferences"
