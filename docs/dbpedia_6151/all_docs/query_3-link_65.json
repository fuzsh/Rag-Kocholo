Ohorongo, ongoing training is critical for the creation and maintenance of an adequate number of qualified staff. To enable the workforce to acquire the necessary skills, a large number of employees have already received suit- able training in Europe at Schwenk, Polysius and the Association of German Ce- ment Plants. In addition, a number of cement experts temporarily visit Ohorongo for periods of up to six months, during which Ohorongo employees receive hands-on, in-house training. Managing Director, Hans- Wilhelm SchÃ¼tte, said that the current exciting and important task is to roll out the sales and distribution network. With a production capacity of 700 000 tons of cement per annum, the Ohorongo plant will be able to supply about double the amount currently demanded by the local Namibian mar- ket. According to SchÃ¼tte, Ohorongoâs products will be available for purchase from a dense network of retailers throughout Namibia, as well as from vendors in southern Angola. SchÃ¼tte pointed out that in line with Ohorongoâs service ethos and keen appreciation of its clients, expert sales people stand by to develop made-to- measure solutions to meet their specific requirements. âMoreover, experienced and qualified technical advisors will stand by to assist cus- tomers in the appropriate application of Ohorongoâs products,â SchÃ¼tte added. All experts consulted are confident that Ohorongo will have a positive impact on the socio-economic environment of the region. This will be affected not only through poverty reduction as a result of increased employment, but also due to business oppor- tunities that will emerge as a direct result of Ohorongoâs operations. This is borne by the fact that already a number of companies have opened their doors in the Otjozond- jupa and Oshikoto regions in response to new trading openings. Given a multiplier effect of 5 â 7, it has been calculated that Ohorongoâs presence in the area will re- sult in the creation of 2 000 further additional jobs. Apart from the fact that the Otjozondjupa Region as such will benefit from Ohorongo, Namibia as a whole will also profit from the companyâs commercial activities. For example, while Namibia is currently a net importer of cement, in future Ohorongo will not only replace import- ed cement with a high qual- ity local product, but it will sell the commodity abroad, turning Namibia into a net cement exporting country."
