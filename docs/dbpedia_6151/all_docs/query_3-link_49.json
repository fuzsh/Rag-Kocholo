        "text": "On 17 August 2017, the Governor of Oshana Region, Hon. Clemens H Kashuupulwa, opened the Ohorongo Cement Ondangwa Depot, which will distribute cement to the four Northern regions, and if feasible, export markets to South Angola.\n\nThe Governor commended Ohorongo Cement for its bold decision to make this N$4 million investment, despite the current economic trying times. “It is very pleasing to see Ohorongo Cement being optimistic to continue commit to capital projects, as it will position them well for future endeavours. As for their presence in Ondangwa, I believe it will support entrepreneurial drives in the four Northern regions,” the governor said.\n\nThe new depot is the result of a Private Public Prtnership Agreement with TransNamib to lease land at Ondangwa railway station, and is part of the Northern Railway Extension project, which extends from Tsumeb to Oshikango.\n\nHon. Kashuupulwa said the partnership between Ohorongo Cement and TransNamib is a lesson for all, “as these two entities have proven to us that the Northern Railway is a good investment by our Government that could bring positive changes to this part of the country. Thus, both the public and the private sectors need take advantage of its strategic location and close proximity to Regional and International markets.”\n\nOhorongo Cement invested N$4 million into this infrastructure for the distribution of various cement types, including the CEM II 42.5 N, CEM I 42.5 R, CEM II 32.5 N B-LL. These are for the local market, while CEM II 42.5 N, Portuguese labelled, will also be available for the export markets in neighbouring Angola.\n\n“We are taking this opportunity to expand whilst building local value chains and solid business relationships. We believe that the spins for this investment toward local entrepreneurs, especially the transporters, will be great,” said Hans-Wilhelm Schütte, Managing Director of Ohorongo Cement."
