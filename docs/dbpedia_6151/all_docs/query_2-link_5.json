        "text": "A SUPER SMART BRANDING MOVE ðŸ’¡ The job of marketing/branding is to positively influence the perceptions people have of our business, organisation or mission. I scrolled past this post from Moana Minerals Ltd and thought to myself 'This is a super smart move from a branding and community engagement perspective from the MM team.\" Here's why: 1. It puts a face to the brand To bridge the gap between the public and a company, humanising the business/org where possible is always a positive. This builds a connection to real people, which in turns builds trust, improving the perception of the brand. 2. They've put a TRUSTED face to the brand Vaine Arioka MInstD was recently announced as the new -in-country manager for Moana Minerals. Through her previous role as Managing Director of Bank of the Cook Islands she built strong a reputation in the community. As the public face of Moana Minerals Ltd, people associate the positive reputation of her previous role with her current role. I find this is much the same with NGOs and volunteer organisations. A person's professional reputation can help, or even hinder, the public's perception of it. 3. Authenticity and Transparency The manner in which Vaine talks about the trip isn't in formal and 'news reporter' tone. It is informative, with a human touch and authentic tone. The post gives an insight into the mission and the outcomes of the journey - which is reinforced in the caption. All of this adds to the Know, Like and Trust factor for Moana Minerals. It's an approach that I've taken with Cook Islands Finance - where our biggest advantage is the immense experience we have in the financial services industry. here. Add some wisdom or comments below. #branding #marketing\n\n#siemreap #cambodia APOPO Cambodia Landmines & Bombs During the Vietnam War, the US dropped around 26 million bombs, with approximately 2.6 million remaining undetonated in fields, posing ongoing risks. Additionally, from internal civil conflicts, about six million landmines persist, requiring removal for the land to be returned to the people for farming. Over the past 25 years, efforts to remove these explosives have been continuous, with only 17% successfully deactivated. A notable and efficient method involves rats trained in Tanzania by the NGO APOPO, which operates in various Asian and African countries. These rats undergo a year of training before being deployed to Cambodia through the NGO to later assist in targeted areas. The cost of the explosives can reach up to $300 USD, and the overall deactivation process, which includes rat training, meals, personnel and camp sites, amounts to approximately $7,000 USD per explosive making it a costly and timely process. Life is not fair, but we can make a difference"
