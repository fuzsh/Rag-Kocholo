Ohorongo Cement, Namibia’s sole cement manufacturer, has produced about 2.4Mt of cement for both local and foreign consumption over the past five years, according to managing director Hans-Wilhelm Schütte.

Situated over 30km north of Otavi in the Otjozondjupa region of Namibia, the plant produces around 4400 bags of cement per hour, which is dispatched to local and export markets such as Zambia, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the UK.

Ohorongo Cement began production in December 2010 and has since then witnessed a steady rise in its turnover of cement, Mr Schütte added.

Ohorongo Cement is majority owned by Namibia (Pty) Ltd with 69.83 percent, the Development Bank of Namibia (DBN) with 11.73 per cent, while the Development Bank of South Africa holds 4.17 per cent shares.
