        "text": "South College has launched a new, fully online Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) program utilizing a flexible competency-based education (CBE) format to allow students to proceed at their own pace.\n\nSouth College, a multi-campus institution, founded in Knoxville, Tennessee, in 1882, offers 80-plus programs and concentrations taught at eight physical campuses and online.\n\n“South College has a long history of providing programs that are focused on the competencies needed within various fields,” South College Chancellor Stephen A. South said. “The Doctor of Business Administration program is distinctive in several ways, from the ability for students to progress at their own pace to the model that allows motivated students to accelerate through the program. We are committed to serving students by providing affordability, excellent resources, and the flexibility needed by students with families, careers, or who are serving in the military.”\n\nProgram development was led by Dr. Michael Patrick, vice president of Competency-Based Education & Academic Improvement at South College, who said, “The CBE format allows students to set their academic pace while applying existing skills, knowledge, and experience. When we designed the program, we started with the end in mind, considering the skills students would need and built from there. We’re happy to add another doctoral program to serve the educational needs of students.”\n\nProgram instructors are industry and subject matter experts who have experience teaching in a CBE model. The one-to-one faculty/student learning environment means that students aren’t in a classroom with other students but paired with one instructor for each course.\n\nThe DBA program requires satisfactory completion of 10 courses and with three specialties offered: Organizational Leadership, Healthcare Administration, and Accounting. There are four opportunities to start the program each year on Oct. 1, Jan 1, April 1, and July 1. Enrollment is now open Jan 1. Students must have a master’s degree; there is not a GRE or GMAT requirement to enter the program. To learn more about the DBA program at South College, visit South.edu.\n\nAbout South College"
