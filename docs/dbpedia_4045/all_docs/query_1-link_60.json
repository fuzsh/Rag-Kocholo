        "text": "A respected and long-standing beacon of the community, Lane College and its role in the spheres of higher education, activism, and the foundational history of Jackson continues to be significant.\n\nOn Jan. 24, Lane College President Logan Hampton enlightened members of the Jackson Rotary Club with a history of the institution and the goals he has for it under his leadership in 2024.\n\nFounded in 1882 by the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church, presently known as the Christian Methodist Episcopal (CME) Church, the historically black college aimed to educate slaves who were freed in the years following the end of the Civil War.\n\nMore: Lane College partners with CVS Health to provide pharmaceutical opportunities for students\n\nMore: 6K Energy awards first scholarship, commits to partnering with local colleges\n\nMore: Inmates become first class to receive bachelor's degree from HBCU, Lane College\n\nNamed after co-founder and Methodist Bishop Isaac Lane, the school's mission statement \"believes that oneâ€™s intellectual capability coupled with social and spiritual growth is essential to the development of a well-rounded individual.\"\n\nHampton says that academic excellence through student-centered teaching, teacher-related research, and service continue to be among the top priorities for the institution.\n\n\"Lane College is a microcosm of society and we've got to double down on the basics to achieve our CME church-affiliated higher education institution's mission to develop the whole student intellectually, socially, and spiritually,\" Hampton said.\n\nReflecting on 2023\n\nIn sharing some of the college's most notable accomplishments and milestones in the last year, Hampton noted that 236 students earned high academic honors, while 40% of student-athletes earned a grade point average of 3.0 or higher.\n\n\"This year and the last have been very difficult and trying,\" he said. \"Nevertheless, it has been fun, inspiring, and fulfilling.\"\n\nLane launched its Workforce Innovation Talent Center in partnership with CVS Health in April, providing pharmaceutical-related credentials to students in addition to their degree in a related field. This program is the first of its kind at an HBCU.\n\nIn July, Miss Lane College Jada Brown was crowned Miss Tennessee Volunteer, making history as the pageant's first black winner.\n\nMore: 'So much bigger than me': Miss Lane College makes history as 1st Black Miss TN Volunteer\n\nPresented by Jackson's newest industry partner 6K Energy, Amashia Mabone, a Lane College sophomore, was the first recipient of the \"$6K for 6K\" scholarship in November, an honor that supports students in a science-related major with $6,000 each year until graduation.\n\nThe college also partnered with Northwest Correctional Complex in Tiptonville, allowing six inmates to attain their bachelor's degrees in business administration in November. Through Lane's partnership, the men became the first incarcerated class to receive a degree from an HBCU and the first in the prison's history to receive a bachelor's degree.\n\nIn concluding remarks, Hampton encouraged kind words and prayers over the college along with financial investments and new partnerships.\n\n\"We have a faith that will not shrink. The college will continue to evolve, and transform to meet its mission in modern society for our contemporary students,\" Hampton said. \"For 142 years, Lane has achieved its mission to develop the whole student.\""
