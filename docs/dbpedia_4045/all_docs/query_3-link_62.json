        "text": "JACKSON, TN — The Lane College Board of Trustees (Jackson, Tennessee) has selected Donald W. Comer as interim president. Effective August 1, 2024, his appointment follows the departure of former President Dr. Logan Hampton, effective July 31, 2024.\n\n“The Board and I are confident that we have selected a dynamic new leader for the next level of growth of our beloved Lane College.” Bishop Marvin Frank Thomas, chair of the Lane College Board of Trustees says. Located in Jackson, TN, Lane College is a private Historically Black College established by the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church (CME) in 1882.\n\nComer’s appointment continues the historic HBCU’s legacy of excellence. He is a Jackson, TN native, earning his PhD in Urban Higher Education at Lane’s sister HBCU Jackson State University (JSU) in Jackson, MS. He also holds a Master of Business Administration (MBA), and a Bachelor of Science in Accounting (BS). After 35 years at FedEx, Dr. Comer retired as Vice President, Decision Science & Analytics and Operations Analysis; where his duties included collaborating with Tesla, Inc.’s research team to match the design of Tesla Electric Semi Truck with FedEx’s operational needs.\n\nNamed to the Lane College Hall of Distinction-Non Alumni in 2022, Comer says of the new appointment, “I am deeply honored to be appointed to lead “my hometown HBCU.” Lane College plays a pivotal role in delivering on the promise of excellence in Black higher education. I’m excited to have this opportunity to foster thriving academic pursuit, enhance student success and nurture the next generation of scholars and global leaders.”\n\nHe has been a tireless advocate, advisor, and mentor for students, dedicating significant personal time to serving on the boards of HBCUs Lemoyne-Owen College in Memphis, TN, and Stillman College in Tuscaloosa, AL. He is a Silver Life member of the NAACP, a member of the National Black MBA Association, and a Life member of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc."
