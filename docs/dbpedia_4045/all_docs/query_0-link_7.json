        "text": "Founded in 1879 as the Kentucky Normal and Theological Institute, Simmons College of Kentucky was one of the first post-secondary institute for African-Americans in the community. Like many early schools for black students, the curriculum started as a simple teacher and pastor education program.

The Valley Street Campus offers courses in Marketing Management, HVACR, Carpentry, Message Therapy and Nursing Assistant. Students can earn a certificate, short-term certificate or associate degree at Gadsden State.\n\nAs one of the most affordable historically black colleges in our ranking, Bishop State Community College started in 1927 as a Mobile branch of Alabama State College. Its original purpose was to offer extension courses to African-American teachers in the region. In 1965, it became an independent junior college.

Its most popular programs are its technical and career programs, but it still offers strong academic degree programs in subjects such as social sciences, developmental education, and health related professions.\n\nOne of the oldest and most diverse community colleges in the US, St. Philip's College is the only college that is both a historically black college and Hispanic-serving institution. It was founded in 1898 as a normal and industrial school for recently freed black girls. In 1902, Artemisia Bowden, the daughter of a former slave, joined the school administration, and under her leadership, the school rapidly grew into a thriving junior college. Since then, this affordable historically black college has continued to grow and now offers almost 70 associate's degree programs, as well as several certificate programs.\n\nJ.F. Drake State Community and Technical College is a two-year technical public institution that was founded in 1961 by Governor George Wallace to support the career education needs of African-Americans in the community. It is the first and only institution of its kind in the State of Alabama, and it provides both university-transfer and technical degrees that heavily emphasize hands-on learning. While it is one of the smaller historically black colleges and universities on our list with only about 500 students enrolled full-time, it still is able to offer several unique degree programs. Some of Drake State's most popular programs are Business Administration, Practical Nursing, Medical Assisting, and Welding Technology.\n\nTrenholm State Community College is a multi-campus institution formed by the consolidation of two technical schools that were founded in the mid-1900s.

Small class sizes are prioritized at this affordable historically black college, so students can benefit from individualized attention from faculty and an environment conducive to meaningful class discussion.\n\nLawson State Community College as it is known today was created by two mergers. The first merger was between Wenonah State Junior College and Wenonah State Technical Institute, which came together in 1973 under the Lawson State Community College name. This merger created an institution that offered both career technical education and university-parallel academics. The career technical division was strengthened in 2005 when another school, Bessemer State Technical College, merged with Lawson State.

In 1882, the school was proud to announce that the first African-American student to graduate and receive a college degree in Arkansas had graduated from Branch Normal. Gradually, curriculum was expanded, first in 1927 to include agricultural and mechanical education, and then again in 1972 to include a more comprehensive liberal arts curriculum after merging with the University of Arkansas system. Today, this affordable historically black college continues to grow its programs, but still has strong roots in agriculture and education.\n\nFounded during the Reconstruction to end illiteracy among freedmen, Clinton College is the oldest institution of higher education in Rock Hill, South Carolina. It is a small college with an enrollment of only about 200 students. However, this doesn't mean students receive an inferior education. New academic programs are being added often, and the programs that are currently available are strong and taught by highly-qualified faculty. The small student body comprising this affordable historically black college also allows students to have more meaningful interactions with peers and family.\n\nOriginally known as the Bluefield Colored Institute, Bluefield State College was founded in 1895 to provide higher education to young African-American men and women, as well as to train black teachers. It is the only non-residential four-year college in the West Virginia public education system, and it offers several associate's and bachelor's degree programs.

Popular majors include health professions, business, and marketing.\n\nCoppin State University was founded in 1900 to train African-American elementary school teachers in the Baltimore area. By 1938, the curriculum had expanded from one year to four years, and in 1963, its degree granting authority was expanded to include subjects other than teaching. Today, there are nearly 4,000 students enrolled at CSU, and the university offers 53 undergraduate majors and nine graduate degree programs. Students at this affordable historically black college also enjoy a balance between the opportunities available at larger universities and the community and the sort of access to professors that is typical of smaller institutions.\n\nLeMoyne-Owen College is the result of a 1968 merger between Owen College and LeMoyne Normal and Commercial School, both of which had a history of providing education to African-American students in the Mid-South area. As one of the most versatile historically black colleges and universities on our list, the college offers bachelor's degree programs in 23 areas of study, including urban leadership, chemistry, child development and family studies, and computer science. All programs are occupation-based and taught by experienced faculty members who are committed to student success. Students also enjoy small class sizes and individualized attention from professors and a diverse community of peers.\n\nHarris-Stowe State University is a historically black college that began as two separate normal schools for teacher education: Harris Teachers College and Stowe Teachers College. While Harris was for white students only, Stowe was founded to provide a similar education to future black teachers in the area. These two schools merged in 1954, and went on to expand the curriculum and offer a variety of bachelor's programs in teaching. One of its most unique programs is its BS in Urban Education, which prepares its students to handle the challenges faced by schools in urban settings and to this day, is the only undergraduate program of its kind in the US.\n\nSouthwestern Christian College started in 1948 as a small bible institute with only 45 students. Only a year later, the school purchased property from the recently closed Texas Military College in Terrell and expanded its scope. Today, SCC's curriculum remains simple, but comprehensive and strong. This affordable historically black college offers three degree programs: an AA and an AS in general studies, and a BS in Religious Studies. These programs are designed and taught by highly-qualified faculty, and they thoroughly prepare students for further education.\n\nRust College was founded in 1866 as a school for all ages, from elementary school children to high school-level adults. Gradually, more college-level curricula was added, and the elementary and high school programs were slowly phased out to focus on collegiate education. Today, Rust College continues to grow and offers bachelor's and associate's degree in many fields, including business administration, mass communication, and chemistry. Preparation for life after college is a priority at this affordable historically black college, so curriculum is occupation-focused and designed to carefully balance theory and practice.\n\nLincoln University was founded by members of the 62 United States Colored Infantry shortly after the Civil War ended for the purpose of educating newly freed African-Americans. The early curriculum focused on teacher training and combining labor and study, but expanded to include industrial and agricultural courses after it became a land grant institution in 1879. Today, this affordable historically black college offers 50 undergraduate degree programs, as well as a handful of master's degree programs, to a small but diverse student body.\n\nCentral State University was originally founded as an affiliate of Wilberforce University and it is one of the oldest black-administered institutes of higher education in the nation. It became independent from Wilberforce University in 1947, and it achieved university status in 1965. CSU is a land grant institution, so the curriculum focuses heavily on STEM and agricultural fields. However, this doesn't mean that other subject areas are neglected. While the STEM programs are the most popular, there are also many students who pursue degrees in fine arts or education from this affordable historically black college.\n\nLane College was founded in 1882 by the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church in order to provide newly freed African-Americans with an education after the Civil War. The curriculum originally focused on teaching and religion, but by 1896, it had gradually expanded to include natural and physical sciences as well as mathematics. Today, Lane College offers bachelor's degrees in a wide range of subject areas such as biology, engineering, computer science, and mass communication. With just over 1,400 students enrolled, Lane College is one of the smaller historically black colleges and universities in our ranking. This small size allows for better student-teacher interaction and a close-knit community of peers.\n\nFounded in 1865, Edward Waters College is Florida's oldest independent institution of higher learning and its first institution established for African Americans. This affordable historically black college is still small, with a current enrollment of just over 800 students. However, it has grown significantly in terms of its academic programs and has expanded its land as well. EWC offers eight bachelor's degree programs, including Business Administration, Communications, Biology, and Elementary Education. While this may seem like a fairly small number of degree programs, many of these programs include different tracks or concentrations, which make them very versatile.\n\nTexas College was founded in 1894 by the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church to educate young African-American men and women in the community. Over time, the curriculum expanded, and today students enrolled at this affordable historically black college can choose from 12 bachelor's degree programs, including mathematics, religion, and social work. Associate's degrees are also offered in general studies and early childhood education. Students are encouraged to take advantage of the low student to faculty ratio and work with professors and advisers to get the most out of their education.\n\nOriginally known as the Oklahoma Colored Agricultural and Normal University, Langston University was founded in 1897 as a land grant college.

However, this affordable historically black college does also offer several programs from other subject areas. Some campuses even offer master's and doctoral programs in subjects such as physical therapy and entrepreneurial studies.\n\nTalladega College was founded in 1867 by two former slaves. One of its primary goals was and continues to be teacher education, which was the first collegiate-level program offered. Today, Talladega College offers 17 bachelor's degree programs in subjects such as Mass Media Studies, Public Administration, and Sociology. It is among the smaller historically black colleges and universities on our list, with roughly 1,500 students enrolled.

However, it is also large enough to offer many benefits larger colleges and universities are able to offer, such as experiential learning opportunities.\n\nTougaloo College was founded in 1869 by local Christian organizations to provide an education to newly freed slaves and their children. From 1871 to 1892, the college served primarily as a teacher education school, but since then, many other subject areas have been added to the curriculum.

This affordable historically black college also boasts a diverse faculty, 70% of whom hold terminal degrees in their field.\n\nOne of the smaller historically black colleges and universities on our list, American Baptist College was founded in 1924 as a seminary for African-American ministers.

Today, the college is an accredited institution that offers both strong theology programs and programs in secular subjects such as entrepreneurial leadership and behavior studies.

During the school's first years, the leadership and students faced threats and harassment form racists in the nearby town of Marshall, Texas. However, instead of moving to a less hostile area, the college actually moved closer to the town, setting a great example of resilience against racism. Even under these conditions, the college thrived and expanded in terms of enrollment, property, and programs offered. Today, Wiley College offers over 30 majors, many of which are education-focused.\n\nOriginally known as the Minister's Institute, Arkansas Baptist College was founded in 1884 by the Colored Baptists of Arkansas both to train religious leaders in the African-American community and to make general higher education available to young men and women in the community.

The school is one of the smaller historically black colleges and universities, with only about 600 students enrolled, but it still boasts strong school spirit, community, and academic programs. While other subject areas have been added to the curriculum, the religious studies degree programs remain the most popular.\n\nAs the very first black land grant college in the US, Alcorn State University has a rich history. The school was founded as part of a state effort to provide an education to the descendants of formerly enslaved Africans, and has grown from a small, male-only institution with only three buildings to one of the leading affordable historically black colleges in the US with hundreds of highly qualified faculty and a campus built on over 1,700 acres of land. Today, Alcorn State offers degrees in over 50 different subject areas on both undergraduate and graduate levels.

Early on, the school leadership adjusted the curriculum to be more like the model used by Alabama's Tuskegee Institute, and has since continued to gradually expand its programs. As Georgia's only 1890 land-grant school, FVSU focuses heavily on its agriculture and STEM programs. Its biology and chemistry programs are among its most popular undergraduate degree programs.

All of these programs are designed and taught by committed faculty with real-world experience in their field, so students receive a high-quality education regardless of the major they choose.\n\nNamed after English abolitionist William Wilberforce, Wilberforce University was the first college to be owned and operated by African-Americans.

Multiple degree programs are available in business, communications, education, humanities, social sciences, and mathematics. Students at this affordable historically black college can also take advantage of experiential learning opportunities and extracurricular activities organized by an active Student Life office.\n\nOriginally known as Walden Seminary, Philander Smith College was the first attempt west of the Mississippi River to educate freedmen.

Today, Philander Smith College offers 20 undergraduate programs that emphasize research, study abroad, and other hands-on experiences. Popular majors include business, health and physical education, and psychology. Class sizes are kept small, partly because only about 800 students are enrolled at PSC, but also because meaningful interactions with peers and faculty at this affordable historically black college are a priority.\n\nAs one of the top historically black colleges and universities in the country, Allen University boasts its title as the first South Carolina university to be founded by African-Americans for African-Americans. It was founded in 1870 in order to educate newly freed slaves, including not only those of university level and age, but also elementary and high school students. After 1933, the university discontinued this grammar school to focus on its college-level programs in theology, law, and teaching. Since then, Allen University has expanded to offer 21 programs in eight different fields, including chemistry, business administration, music, and social science.\n\nOriginally known as Tuscaloosa Institute, Stillman College was founded in 1876 by Reverend Dr. Charles Allen Stillman of the First Presbyterian Church of Tuscaloosa in order to train African-American men for the ministry. It gradually expanded its scope to include a broad liberal arts education, as well as a nurse training school. Today, Stillman still offers multiple bachelor's degrees, as well as a master's degree in elementary education. Popular majors offered by this affordable historically black college include business administration, criminal justice, and special education.\n\nFounded in 1886, Shorter College is the only private, two-year historically black college or university in the nation. It is also one of the fastest growing campuses in Central Arkansas. While it only offers a handful of associate's degree programs, the few available programs are strong and provide students with the foundation they need to either transfer into a bachelor's program or further their career. The generalized nature of these programs allows them to be applicable to a wide variety of career paths.\n\nOne of the leading historically black colleges and universities in the country, Bethune-Cookman University was founded in 1904 by Mary McLeod Bethune as a literacy and industrial training school for young African-American girls. Its curriculum and student body expanded gradually starting in 1923 when the school merged with the Cookman Institute of Jacksonville, Florida and became co-ed. It received full accreditation as a junior college in 1931, had its first four-year baccalaureate program approved in 1941, and achieved university status in 2007.

Its most popular majors include nursing, criminal justice, business administration, and mass communication.\n\nHuston-Tillotson University was formed in 1952 by the merger of Samuel Huston College and Tillotson College.

Since the merger, the university has remained a primarily black college, though it is a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, and multi-faith institution that aims to serve a diverse student body. It offers undergraduate degrees in a wide range of fields, including Political Science, Biology, Education, and Environmental Studies. This impressive historically black college also offers a graduate program in Education.\n\nPaine College was founded in 1882 by the Methodist Episcopal Church South and the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church in order to train recently-freed African-Americans to be teachers and preachers. The curriculum was originally only high school level, but by 1903, enough college-level coursework was offered to justify the school's name change from Paine Institute to Paine College. However, the high school curriculum remained for roughly 40 more years due to there being no other public secondary school for blacks in the area. Today, Paine remains a small college with only about 500 students enrolled. However, the affordable historically black college's curriculum has evolved to include 16 comprehensive bachelor's programs in 16 different subject areas.\n\nThe University of the District of Columbia is the only public institution of higher learning in DC, as well as the only exclusively urban land-grant university in the nation. It started as two separate normal schools established in the 1870s: Miner Normal School for black girls and Washington Normal School for white girls. After desegregation, these two schools merged. The college was able to slowly provide more opportunities and programs of study to its students through lobbying by district residents and a series of mergers. Today, this affordable historically black college offers 81 undergraduate and graduate programs, the most popular of which include business administration, nursing education, and human development and family studies.\n\nFounded in 1872 to educate freed slaves and their descendants, Paul Quinn College is one of only eight work colleges in the US, as well as the only urban work college. As a work college, Paul Quinn promotes not only a culture of learning, but also a culture of service.
