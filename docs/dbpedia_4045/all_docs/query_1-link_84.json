        "text": "I chose Lynn for the softball program, class sizes, the block schedule, and the location! My major is a great first step for going to Law school after my undergraduate degree. I love playing softball, hanging out with my friends, going to the beach and any other athletic activity! After I graduate, I hope to go to law school and eventually become a divorce lawyer!\n\nMadison Doherty '27\n\nArdsley, New York, Political Science\n\n[email protected]\n\nI chose Lynn because forensic investigations is a niche major that not many universities have and it's small class size. Outside of class, I enjoy doing yoga, Pilates and going to the beach with friends. After I graduate I want to pursue a career as a forensic analyst for the FBI.\n\nBianca Cain '25\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina, Forensic Investigations\n\n[email protected]\n\nMusic has been a huge part of my life since I was little, so finding a good conservatory was essential for me. The conservatory and faculty here at Lynn are amazing and are really helping me prepare for a career in music! Outside of the classroom, I enjoy swimming, drawing, and reading! After Lynn, I hope to pursue my master's degree and work towards getting a job in an orchestra!\n\nOlivia Oakland '25\n\nBoca Raton, Florida, Performance: Strings, Woodwinds, Brass, Harp & Percussion\n\n[email protected]"
