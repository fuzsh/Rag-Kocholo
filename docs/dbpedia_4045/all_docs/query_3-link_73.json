        "text": "Logan Hampton lives on the Lane College campus, walks to work and smiles when students call him \"Mr. Prez.\"\n\nHe is Lane's 10th president in 132 years and is comfortable with the informal but respectful moniker bestowed by those he feels blessed to serve.\n\n\"Every day I wake up and look for ways to represent the Lord and represent Lane College,\" he said. \"I think that's what I'm called to do, and as long as I'm in this position, that will be my drive.\"\n\nThat conviction, combined with leadership skills and an extensive background in higher education, led the Lane board of trustees to choose Dr. Logan Curtis Bruel Hampton Jr. as Lane's president on June 12, 2014. He began work Aug. 1.\n\nAn ordained minister, he is 51 but could easily pass for 40. He has visited numerous area churches, black and white, and has made it a point to attend public functions throughout Jackson to promote Lane.\n\n\"He's like a firecracker, and you have to keep up with him,\" said Chief of Staff Darlette Samuels, who has worked in the president's office at Lane for 20 years.\n\nShe was hired by Dr. Wesley McClure, who died in December 2013 after two decades as Lane's president.\n\n\"I'd say Dr. Hampton is more community oriented,\" Samuels said. \"You will find him most of the time meeting outside the office, whereas Dr. McClure was more likely to be at his desk. But their passion for Lane is the same.\"\n\nBeing on the go is part of Hampton's DNA. The former track star was named Mr. Bronco, his junior high's outstanding athlete, in ninth grade, and he was an All-American sprinter on the track team at Pine Bluff (Ark.) High School.\n\nTrack earned him a college scholarship in 1981, and he became a Wonder Boy at Arkansas Tech. That exposed him to higher education and began opening doors that eventually led him to Lane 33 years later.\n\nFaithfulness\n\nHampton drove to Jackson from Arkansas in a 1998 Toyota Camry he purchased new.\n\nIt has 537,000 miles on the odometer, so one day you might see him in a Toyota commercial. The \"check engine\" light has been glowing for five years, but he has no plans to trade.\n\nThe car's radio buttons are all set on music formats, not talk radio, and Christian music prevails. He recently installed a Bluetooth car radio so he can talk on the phone hands-free while driving.\n\n\"It's like a new car to me now,\" he said, laughing. \"That car still gets good gas mileage, gets me from Jackson to the airport and from Lane College to Kroger. It has been faithful.\"\n\nThat means a lot in his world.\n\nHampton has been married 26 years to the former Susan Elise Combest from Natchitoches, La. He spotted her at a pep rally in the fall of 1985 at Northwestern State University, where he was working on a master's degree. It was love at first sight, at least for him.\n\n\"I looked across the crowd and saw this woman,\" he said. \"I remember thinking, 'She's going to be my wife.' Of course, it took me a while to convince her. She's a saint to put up with me.\"\n\n\"I don't even remember seeing him that day,\" Susan said, laughing. \"But he was really persistent, very attentive and noticed the things I liked. He'd pretend he didn't mind going to the mall to shop with me, things like that. It won me over.\"\n\nShe wasn't surprised when her husband told her he wanted to become Lane's president.\n\n\"He's always been a strong leader,\" she said. \"He's a great people person and really sensitive to the needs of others. That's what made him a great pastor and now a good president.\"\n\nSusan teaches second grade in Conway, Ark. She needs one more year to be eligible to retire with full benefits, so she and Logan decided she should remain in Arkansas until the summer of 2016.\n\n\"There are times when it's difficult being apart, but we talk on the phone every morning and evening,\" she said.\n\nThey have three children. Elise teaches fifth grade in Conway. Crystal is a second-year graduate student in speech pathology at Jackson State University in Jackson, Miss. And Logan III is a sophomore at Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia, Ark.\n\nCampus life\n\nSusan had never seen Lane's campus before Logan became president. She has since been to Jackson a half dozen times and likes it.\n\n\"It's not unlike Conway in terms of shopping,\" she said. \"I love the downtown area around the Lift (Wellness Center,) and Lane's historical buildings are just beautiful.\"\n\nWhile in Jackson, she stays at historic Lane House on campus, where Logan lives year-round. It has four bedrooms upstairs and is a five-minute walk to his office.\n\n\"Living on campus has been very beneficial,\" the president said. \"â€¦ It has accelerated my efforts to understand and learn the student culture and institutional culture at Lane. It has given me insight into where we need to make strategic changes to improve our retention and graduation rates.\"\n\nHampton is rarely in bed before midnight and usually is up by 4:30 a.m.\n\n\"I'm not a big sleeper,\" he said. \"Five hours is a lot of sleep for me.\"\n\nHe starts his day with Bible study and prayer, reads his e-mails and then reads The Jackson Sun electronically. He and Susan talk by phone until she goes to work.\n\nHe walks down the hill of Lane Avenue to his office and is usually there before 8 a.m.\n\n\"He beats everybody to work,\" Samuels said.\n\nThere are three tall windows in Hampton's office, and he has the blinds raised to the top, allowing sunlight to bathe the room.\n\nThe only change he has made to the office previously used by McClure is the addition of a Keurig coffee maker.\n\nHampton likes to cook, but living alone means most of his meals are at restaurants. He's delighted when Lane's cafeteria serves brown beans, cornbread and coleslaw, but he also loves Susan's red beans and rice. Top that off with Blue Bell vanilla ice cream, and he's content.\n\nSoul searching\n\nBorn Aug. 1, 1963, Hampton grew up in Parkin, Ark., where a single traffic light directed a populace of fewer than 1,000.\n\nThe year's biggest treat was getting to go to Memphis, 35 miles to the east, and give Santa Claus the all-important wish list.\n\n\"Memphis was a magical location for a small-town boy who went there with big eyes,\" he said.\n\nThe family moved briefly to Louisiana before returning to Arkansas, where Hampton attended Pine Bluff High School. A year earlier, he was named Mr. Bronco at the junior high for excelling in football, basketball and track.\n\nHe was a running back and thought football was his ticket to glory. But in a Red-White scrimmage game when he was a sophomore, his world crumbled.\n\nThe quarterback was Danny Bradley, who later starred at Oklahoma before becoming a wide receiver in the NFL. Bradley pitched the ball to Hampton on an option play, and the ball hit the ground short of its target. When Hampton reached for it, a tackler hit his arm, knocking his elbow out of socket and chipping off part of the bone.\n\nHampton couldn't play football in the fall, and he wept on Friday nights.\n\nThat's when he turned his back on God.\n\n\"I had a crisis of faith,\" he said. \"I decided that there obviously was not a God or he would not have allowed me to get my arm broken and miss the football season. There was no God, and I declared it.\"\n\nHampton still had to attend church with his parents, but decided prayer was useless since there was no God. For some reason, he kept attending the Fellowship of Christian Athletes meetings each Thursday morning in the cafeteria before school started.\n\nHe sat in the back and listened. One morning in the fall of 1978, the speaker asked the athletes to imagine being in a tube that went straight to heaven and you could tell God anything you wanted.\n\n\"So, I had a conversation with God, and that morning was the beginning of my faith walk,\" Hampton said. \"It was my conversion moment. That morning I accepted Christ as my Lord and Savior, and it changed the course of my life.\"\n\n\"It set me on a new path in terms of what was important and what my priorities were,\" he said. \"I put God first, and to this day that's still the priority â€” God, family, team, me. Not to take anything away from my parents or my church, but I needed that extra something that I got from those FCA meetings. I am indebted to the leaders of FCA.\"\n\nRun, Logan, run\n\nHampton said he \"never got my swagger back\" as a football player, but he was among the stars on an elite track team.\n\nTrack became his path to college. He ran sprints and relays for a high school team that won the state track meet by 99 points his senior year.\n\n\"I would have been the fastest person at many other schools, but I was probably the No. 5 or 6 sprinter on our team,\" he said. \"It was special, and five or six of us made high school All-American and got collegiate offers.\"\n\nHampton's parents, Logan Sr. and Lena Mae, stressed God and education. Both were teachers before changing careers. Logan Sr. retired from the Social Security Administration, and Lena Mae retired as a therapeutic counselor.\n\nLogan Jr. knew he had to go to college, so he and a buddy accepted offers to run track with the Wonder Boys at Arkansas Tech University in Russellville. It was another life-changing decision.\n\n\"Arkansas Tech was maybe one or two percent African American,\" Hampton said. \"Pine Bluff was thoroughly African American. So I went to Arkansas Tech with some prejudices that came from lack of knowledge. I had more interaction with whites there on campus than at any previous point in my life.\n\n\"It was really important for me to make that transition, and we jumped right in and were leaders on campus.\"\n\nHe ran track four years and earned his bachelor's degree in biology, thinking he might become a doctor. But he said God had other plans.\n\nPastor Logan\n\nAt the end of his senior year in high school, Hampton said he accepted God's call to ministry in the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\nOrganized on Dec. 16, 1870, in Jackson by 41 former slaves, the CME Church has more than 1 million members today.\n\nHampton was a member of New Hope CME Church in Pine Bluff and had studied church doctrine. But he never expected to become a supply preacher before he attended his first class at Arkansas Tech.\n\nExum Tabernacle CME Church in Russellville needed a pastor, and Hampton was assigned to fill in a few Sundays until a new pastor arrived.\n\n\"My mother and I drove up to this small church and walked inside,\" Hampton said. \"A lady took one look at me and said, 'Oh, Lord, they done sent us a boy preacher.'\"\n\nAfter that service, the same lady came to him and said, \"The Lord is on you.\"\n\n\"She became one of my biggest supporters all through my time at Arkansas Tech,\" he said.\n\nHampton became youth pastor at that church his freshman year and pastored another church each Sunday during his sophomore year.\n\n\"That was too much,\" he said. \"Preaching every Sunday and taking organic chemistry and microbiology was rough.\"\n\nDuring that sophomore year, Hampton found himself in charge of the second funeral he had ever attended. The experience became one of his most memorable moments.\n\n\"I wore the only dark suit I owned,\" he said. \"It fitted tight because I was bulking up for track. When I sat down, I heard something like a tear and wondered what it was. I had to stand up before the other pastor did the eulogy, and when I sat back down, I heard a long series of tears and felt air.\"\n\nThe inseam on the upper leg of his pants had ripped, exposing too much skin. He wore no robe and still had to preside at the graveside service.\n\nDesperate, he found a safety pin inside his coat that was left by the cleaners. He did his best to pin the gap, but it was still showing. So he shielded the front of his pants with his Bible and \"walked funny\" during the graveside service.\n\n\"It was easily the most embarrassing moment of my life,\" he said.\n\nA new calling\n\nAfter graduation from Arkansas Tech, Hampton thought he would go to medical school or enter full-time ministry.\n\nHe was placed on a waiting list for med school, and he didn't feel led to attend a seminary. A mentor suggested he continue to work in student affairs, which he had done as a student.\n\n\"I didn't know you could make a living doing that sort of thing,\" Hampton said. \"But all along I felt my life calling was to help people develop their potential ... I found my passion in student development, leadership and training. Those are things I get fired up about.\"\n\nHe earned his master's degree in student affairs and met his future wife at Northwestern State before getting his first job as a program coordinator at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth.\n\nAfter four years at TCU, where he attended Brite Divinity School part time, Hampton went to Texas A&M for a year before relocating to the University of Central Arkansas in Conway in 1993.\n\nHe was associate dean of students at UCA and found his way back into the pulpit full time at Reed Memorial CME Church in Little Rock, Ark., about 30 miles south of Conway.\n\nIn 1998, he went to the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, where he served as vice provost for student affairs. He completed his doctorate there in 2006 while working and pastoring full time.\n\nWhile there, he learned his most valuable lesson in the field of student affairs when freshman scholar leaders he worked with finished with poor grades.\n\n\"Our retention rate was not any better than the entire college,\" he said. \"Only 18 of the original 47 scholar leaders retained their scholarships. I was really heartbroken.\"\n\nHampton studied the situation and came to a surprising conclusion.\n\n\"It became clear to me that the scholar leaders had the same problems that the at-risk, marginalized, under-developed students had,\" he said. \"They did not know how to study, how to manage time, how to be college students.\"\n\nHampton changed his approach and treated the scholar leaders the same as the at-risk students, providing them the same coaching on how to read and study effectively.\n\n\"When we did that, our retention of scholarships and enrollment doubled,\" he said. \"We helped them learn how to be expert learners.\"\n\n\"That was really the first time when all the different worlds I had been working on in student affairs came together in one program,\" he said. \"It was quite a moment in my career.\"\n\nLane calls\n\nHampton thought he would live the rest of his life in Conway, retire from Arkansas-Little Rock and tour the world on vacations with his wife.\n\nBut he also had fallen in love with a place called Lane College, where in 2008 he began working with CME ministerial candidates each summer. He lived in the residence halls, ate in the cafeteria and walked the Lane campus.\n\nIn 2010, Hampton introduced himself to Dr. McClure during the general convention of the CME Church in Mobile, Ala. He gave McClure his resume and told him to call if there was an appropriate opening in student affairs.\n\nA call never came, and Hampton got busy with life. He made up his mind to approach Dr. McClure again at the CME Unity Summit in Houston in September 2013, but McClure wasn't there. Hampton had no idea McClure was ill, so he was shocked when he learned of McClure's death in December 2013.\n\nHe attended McClure's funeral in Jackson and decided to apply for the president's position at Lane.\n\n\"Although I was happy and content and not doing a job search at all, Lane College represented one of the few places in the United States where I would be able to work and fulfill all of the things I felt called to do as an educator and a pastor,\" Hampton said. \"It was an opportunity to bring together all that was in my heart to do for Christ, for the kingdom and for humanity.\"\n\nMore than 60 candidates, including some former college presidents, were considered for Lane's presidency, said Bill Hamilton, a member of the nine-member search committee. The pool was narrowed to 10 for individual interviews and eventually reduced to four finalists.\n\n\"It was very intense,\" Hamilton said. \"I felt a lot of pressure because we had to get this right. We had a lot of all-stars to consider, but we had to find the player of the year â€¦ and I think we hit it out of the park with this selection.\"\n\n\"I truly believe Dr. Hampton is a person of destiny and that God led him to this institution,\" Hamilton said. \"He has an uncanny ability to take the reins and lead.\"\n\nAfter interviews, Hampton was driving his Camry to Reggi's BBQ & Wings in Jackson to enjoy the sample platter when he received a call and was told he was one of the final two candidates. The next day, on Thursday, June 12, 2014, the Lane College board of trustees voted to hire him as Lane's 10th president.\n\nFirst steps\n\nHampton wasn't certain about what he would face when he began work at Lane on Aug. 1.\n\n\"I had a bit of anxiety building up,\" he said. \"As I was prayerfully walking after morning devotions, some words wafted into my spirit, and I say it was from the Holy Spirit, that gave me a sense of calm.\n\n\"The words were: As you work with people and build staff, find those people who love the Lord, who love and are passionate about Lane College, and then they can work with Logan. Instantly, a release came over me. I truly had a sense of peace in the midst of stressful transition.\"\n\nHe was happy to discover that his staff is passionate about Lane, passionate about the mission of the college and committed to the students. He said many are committed to living and working as Christians.\n\n\"The only changes we made were driven by economics, not by persons who were working at cross purposes with the college or the new administration,\" Hampton said.\n\nHe did not anticipate having to make significant cuts in personnel within two months of starting work at Lane. That has been his most difficult task to date.\n\nThe school had expected a 2014 fall enrollment of 1,500, the same as in 2012 and 2013.\n\n\"We had budgeted based on 1,500, but our enrollment was 1,262,\" he said. \"I guess I will always remember that number.\"\n\nIt created a shortfall in revenue of $3.3 million, and Hampton had to lay off 52 employees by Nov. 1. He said the difficult process \"brought me to my knees.\"\n\nNo academic or athletic program was eliminated, and he managed to retain the faculty. But he had to cut service positions such as groundskeepers, dining staff and custodial services and eliminate other jobs.\n\nAccording to Lane's 2012 Form 990 filed with the IRS and available at guidestar.org, its endowment was $2.2 million that year. Hampton said a \"very small amount of interest\" from the endowment has been budgeted to be used this fiscal year.\n\n\"At present, our endowment is sufficient to support us in the short term, but we need a substantial endowment that would be able to offer us some long-term support in the event that we were to need it,\" he said.\n\n\"At present, the college cash position is strong,\" he said. \"All the bills are paid. All faculty and staff are paid. We are in a strong position financially.\"\n\nAre more layoffs a possibility?\n\n\"We will do our best to retain all of our current employees,\" Hampton said. \"But we are in a position where we will need to review and make appropriate decisions\" when future enrollment numbers become more clear.\n\nHampton's handling of the layoffs impressed June Jones, local chapter president of the Lane College Alumni Association. She graduated from Lane in the summer of 1969.\n\n\"Dr. Hampton has greatly exceeded my expectations in such a short period of time,\" she said. \"It was difficult to have to displace some people and lose workers, but I didn't hear of anyone having hard feelings about it because they knew it had to be done. He handled the situation well, and I'm very impressed with him.\"\n\nJones has also noticed how Hampton is much more visible in the community than his predecessor.\n\n\"He has made his mark,\" she said. \"I think he's preached in every church around â€” black, white, purple, it doesn't matter. With God on his side, you know he's going to succeed.\"\n\nMission unchanged\n\nPrior to Hampton's arrival, Lane alumni expressed concerns about student safety and lax entrance requirements, and they were upset in 2013 when Lane lost its accreditation for preparing teachers. That's still a topic of concern.\n\n\"I can't go to church, to receptions, to any event where Lane alums are and not have a conversation about the status of the teacher preparation program,\" Hampton said.\n\nTennessee law requires a three-year waiting period before Lane can reapply for teacher accreditation, he said.\n\n\"So the earliest that we are able to reapply is the spring of 2016,\" Hampton said. \"I have in place a task force that is beginning to make preparations.\n\n\"For me, it is clear that Lane College needs to be in the business of training educators and preparing students to teach,\" he said.\n\n\"The foundation of this college was built on preparing teachers and preachers. As I said during the interview process, it grieves my heart that we've gotten away from both of those to some extent â€¦ I want to be more intentional on establishing a richer Christian ethos on campus.\"\n\nHampton, who puts on his pastoral collar and preaches at Wednesday chapel services occasionally, said Lane's basic mission and entrance requirements will not change on his watch.\n\n\"Our target population since our founding has been those persons who would not otherwise have access to a higher education,\" he said. \"â€¦ I am frustrated with educators who lament the level of preparation of students who come to us â€¦ I believe we have the responsibility as educators of meeting them where they are, bringing them to where they need to be and pointing them to where they need to go.\n\n\"We've got to be willing to challenge the mindset that intelligence and knowledge is fixed. It's not. It's like the body, like a muscle. You can develop it.\"\n\nHampton has implemented programs that he developed at previous schools to help first-year Lane students become \"expert learners.\" And he is empowering students to learn how to lead and govern themselves. For example, he hired students to run his office.\n\n\"He's not just one-minded,\" said senior Morgan Moore of Louisville, Ky., who is president of Lane's student government association. \"With his background, he's able to work with students and know what we need on campus.\n\n\"He's listening to students and allowing us to become leaders on campus. He also tells us that if we put God first, everything else will fall into place. I appreciate that.\"\n\nHampton has increased security on campus by hiring off-duty officers from the Jackson Police Department to patrol the grounds at peak times. They have the authority to make arrests, unlike Lane's security officers. Hampton lives on campus and said he feels it is \"one of the safest places to be in Jackson.\"\n\nThree Lane students were arrested in separate incidents last month, and there have been past issues. But Hampton said he has no plans to implement a strict screening process to check a potential student's background.\n\n\"Some of our students come from life circumstances that are difficult,\" he said. \"This is, for them, a second chance. If we, a Christian college, are not willing to give those students a second chance, who will?\"\n\n\"But there are those students who absolutely break our heart,\" he said. \"They violate our trust, the student code and, in some instances, they violate the law. ... We don't allow those behaviors to go unnoticed, unchallenged and unajudicated.\"\n\nHampton said he has received \"nothing but support and encouragement from alumni at all levels.\"\n\nSupport essential\n\nHampton is on a mission to engage Jackson's support for Lane. It is essential for the stability and growth of the college.\n\n\"Ultimately, what we are trying to do, we can't do without partners,\" he said.\n\nLane is one of the nation's most affordable private colleges. It costs $16,400 a year for tuition, fees, room and board.\n\nBut 98 percent of Lane's students receive financial aid from federal grants, including some for the \"poorest of the poor,\" Hampton said.\n\n\"So our students cannot stand a significant increase in tuition,\" he said. \"â€¦ If we are going to continue to deliver education to this population of students, then we must have partners who see and understand our mission and are willing to come alongside of us and help us with our mission.\"\n\nHampton has been encouraged by his reception in Jackson. He is grateful for support like that of Jackson businessman Gary A. Taylor, who is the honorary chairman of Lane's 133rd Founder's Day Celebration and Scholarship Dinner on Sunday at 3 p.m. at Lane.\n\n\"There are a lot of good people with good hearts in Jackson, and I've met a lot of folks who love the Lord,\" Hampton said. \"I believe a strong Lane builds a stronger Jackson. My hope is that our citizens will see us, pray for us, understand what we're doing and want to support us. When that happens, everyone wins.\""
