        "text": "While you come to college for your academic studies, research shows students who are actively involved in extracurricular activities have better grades and higher graduation rates.

A few of these opportunities include:\n\nLANE COLLEGE MARCHING BAND\n\nThe Lane College Dragons Marching Band consists of a group of highly motivated and talented instrumental musicians, a dance team, and color guard that performs during halftime at football games, in the homecoming parade, and other community events.

The primary goals of the SGA are as follows: to provide a forum for the expression of student ideas; to serve as an intermediary between the student and the College community; to promote intellectual dialogue; and to secure student enrichment.\n\nThe SGA participates in a wide range of activities and its purposes are intimately related to all facets of campus life:\n\nto promote the individual and collective interests of the student body\n\nto further the democratic process through student representation in institutional governance\n\nto cultivate student leadership and encourage student participation in all phases of institutional governance\n\nto convey students' views to the College faculty and administration\n\nto assist in the coordination and development of student activities\n\nto promote good relations and communications among the students, the faculty, and the administration and\n\nto promote school spirit and tradition\n\nMISS LANE COLLEGE\n\nThe title of Miss Lane College is an honor bestowed upon a young lady who, in competition against other young ladies, is determined most outstanding by a panel of experienced pageant judges. The Miss Lane College Pageant is open to young ladies enrolled in the College who meet specific criteria.\n\nSeveral personality and charm clinics and rehearsals will be held for the contestants prior to the pageant. The young ladies participating in the pageant will find the experience to be exciting, enjoyable, and rewarding. The young lady who wins the title of Miss Lane College will receive a scholarship award to include room and board.\n\nCAMPUS ACTIVITIES BOARD\n\nCampus Activities Board (CAB) is a student-led organization that works to meet the needs of students by creating involvement opportunities on the campus. Our goal is to serve students by providing engaging activities and events that cultivate their social, physical, intellectual, and spiritual development. We believe student involvement creates a healthy campus community which in turn works to support Lane's mission, vision, and values.\n\nThe purpose of the Campus Activities Board is to serve and unity the interests of students, faculty, and staff of Lane through well-rounded social, educational, cultural, and recreational activities.

Operating on the basis of voluntary participation and self-government, student organizations are an integral part of the College community, and as such are obligated to contribute to the scholastic attainment and general development of the individual student. Student organizations offer the individual an opportunity to broaden his/her environment. Skills and experience obtained through membership in student organizations serve as a valuable supplement to the formal curriculum.\n\nStudies confirm students benefit greatly from being involved in a campus organization. An active, involved student is a successful student. Through participation in activities and clubs, students can enhance the classroom curriculum with out-of-class related experiences, form relationships with other students with similar interests, and develop mentor relationships with faculty and staff while utilizing life skills such as decision making, planning, critical thinking, and more.
