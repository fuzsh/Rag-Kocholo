        "text": "Lane College\n\nOffice of Compliance\n\nDear Dragon Fans,\n\nWelcome to the Lane College Department of Intercollegiate Athletics' compliance web page. Our Athletic Department takes pride in operating our programs with integrity. Lane College, as a member of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SIAC) and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division II, seeks to assist its student-athletes, faculty, staff, alumni and friends in their understanding of compliance within both the letter and spirit of the NCAA, conference and institution rules and regulations. Lane College will fully cooperate at all times with the NCAA and take appropriate and recommended actions as necessary.\n\nThe College acknowledges that the responsibilities listed above are a collective endeavor of the institution and that effort is shared by the athletic department staff, student-athletes, individuals, institutional staff and groups representing the athletic interests of the institution. While acknowledging the collective effort the College also emphasizes that it is the individual's responsibility to practice a positive and ethical attitude toward NCAA compliance.\n\nThis information is provided as a quick reference and the examples discussed are not exhaustive. Please contact the Office of Compliance if you have questions about situations or actions which are not covered. The athletic department appreciates your interest and support, but reminds you that an inappropriate contact or an inadvertent action on your part can jeopardize the eligibility of our prospects and student-athletes. When in doubt, the safest action is to ASK BEFORE ACTING.\n\nLane College is proud to have the loyal support of our alumni and friends for its athletic programs. As we continue to celebrate our competitive and rich tradition, we must always seek the highest standard of ethical conduct. We can accomplish this goal with your support and cooperation. Thank you and go Dragons! Contact Information:\n\nRoger Ogden\n\nAssistant Athletic Director\n\nPhone: (731) 426-7659 Fax: (731) 265-1204\n\nrogden@lanecollege.edu\n\nStatement of Compliance\n\nIt is Lane College's intention and goal to be fully compliant with the letter and spirit of NCAA, SIAC, and College rules and regulations. The Department of Athletics is committed to the principle of institutional control through rules education for coaches, athletics department staff, institutional staff, student-athletes, and boosters of the athletics program.\n\nInstitutional staff, as well as the athletics staff, is responsible for knowing the rules and abiding by them. All staff follows the \"rules of compliance\":\n\n1. Each coach is responsible for knowing and adhering to all NCAA rules and regulations. WHEN IN DOUBT, CHECK BEFORE ACTING.\n\n2. The intercollegiate athletics program is monitored to assure compliance. Any instance of non-compliance that is identified is reported to the NCAA.\n\n3. It is expected that each intercollegiate athletics personnel will self-report any knowledge of NCAA violations to the Director of Athletics or to the Compliance Director.\n\nCoaches, athletic department staff, and select institutional staff are provided print materials for which they are held responsible for the content: (a) Current NCAA Division II Manual, (b) Lane College Athletics Compliance Policies and Procedures Manual, and (c) The NCAA links and newsletters.\n\nNCAA Eligibility Center\n\nNCAA Eligibility Center Instructions\n\nStudent Athlete Handbook (PDF)\n\nAcademic Success Rate\n\nEquity In Athletics Disclosure Act (PDF)\n\n2021 EADA Report (PDF)\n\nGraduation Rate for Student Athletes (PDF)\n\nOrganized Competition (PDF)\n\nSickle Cell Trait Information (PDF)\n\nLane College Sickle Cell Policy (PDF)\n\nConcussion Information (PDF)\n\nLane College Concussion Policy (PDF)\n\nQuick Reference Guide to NLI (PDF)\n\nDon't Bet on It (PDF)\n\nSports Wagering (PDF)\n\nNCAA Drug Policy (PDF)\n\nSexual Violence Prevention Policy (PDF)\n\nImportant Information for Parents, Fans and Alumni\n\nAs a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division II member, Lane College is responsible for the actions of all persons and organizations engaged in activities that promote Lane's athletic interests. Therefore the College must ensure that its coaches, student-athletes, faculty and staff, alumni, donors and friends abide by all NCAA regulations. It is especially important to note that recruitment of prospective student-athletes is the sole responsibility of Lane College coaches. Representatives of our athletics interests (boosters) cannot be involved in the recruiting process.\n\nWe therefore need your cooperation to ensure our full compliance with NCAA rules. Violations of NCAA rules could affect the eligibility of prospects or current Lane student-athletes; result in penalties being imposed on Lane by the NCAA, and lead to restrictions on your involvement with Lane's athletics programs. Here is some important information that you should know."
