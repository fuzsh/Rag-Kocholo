In the 1950’s, community-oriented adult education classes were added, and local educational leaders recognized the need to expand into a regional institution that would better serve the diverse needs of the wider community. Following the October 1964 election, Lane Community College was founded by a vote of local citizens, and the main campus opened in 1968. Lane’s second campus opened in Florence in 1976, and the Cottage Grove and Downtown Eugene campuses opened a year later.\n\nLane’s nationally renowned radio station, KLCC, was established in 1967, and is the most powerful public radio station signal in Oregon! KLCC is a charter member of NPR, serving more that 88,000 listeners each week. Lane has housed the Oregon Small Business Development Center Network since 1984. In 2016, Lane’s SBDC generated more than $1.7 million in capital for the community, created 107 jobs, helped start 13 new businesses, and provided free and low-cost classes for the business community. In 2010, Lane became the second community college in the country to house a Longhouse and annually hosts one of the largest powwows in the Pacific Northwest! Since 2006, Lane has offered Chinuk WaWa, an indigenous language specific to the Pacific Northwest.\n\nSee more Lane history"
