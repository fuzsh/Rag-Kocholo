        "text": "Established in 1882, Lane College was among the earliest Black-founded and run colleges in the United States. It opened its doors in Jackson, Tennessee as Colored Methodist Episcopal (CME) High School, soon becoming Lane College. Lane became fully-accredited with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) in 1949 and is now considered part of roughly 101 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU). The owner of this scrapbook was Lessie Belle Spann (1903-?). She was a Jackson, TN native who lived in the same home on Payne Street from her birth until the mid-1940s. At this point, little is known of her life. While at Lane, she served as historian for the Class of 1923 and studied teaching. According to census records, she seems to have built a career of teaching.\n\nThis collection consists of four folders. The first three are the pages of Spann's scrapbook which remain in the order it was received. The last contains the loose photographs of Lane College which were not attached to the album."
