Lane College is a private Historically Black College established in 1882 by the Christian Methodist Episcopal (CME) Church.\n\nAfter a decade of service at Lane, the college has benefitted from numerous achievements with Dr. Hampton at the helm.\n\n“I celebrate the accomplishments and achievements of Lane College’s students, faculty and staff. I am grateful for ten (10) years of support from the Lane College board and for the love the entire Jackson, TN community has shown me and my family,” Dr. Hampton said.\n\nDuring Dr. Hampton’s tenure, Lane College increased fundraising outcomes, experienced a significant increase in net assets and reduced long-term debt.\n\nLane College successfully received reaffirmation of its accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC).\n\nThe institution reestablished its Educator Preparation Program (EPP), established the Power of Potential Scholars Program, the Lane Institute and the Dragon Academy to improve student success, as well as established its Northwest Correctional Complex bachelor’s degree program for the incarcerated.\n\nThe College also strengthened its brand and Christian ethos, installed energy conservation measures improving campus energy efficiency, plus created healthcare partnerships to provide students pathways in pharmacy, pharmacy tech, and nursing.\n\n“We thank Dr. Hampton for his part in advancing Lane over the past 10 years and for his stewardship of this beloved institution,” said Bishop Marvin Frank Thomas, Sr., Board Chair.\n\nAn announcement of the Interim President of Lane College will be forthcoming from the Board of Trustees."
