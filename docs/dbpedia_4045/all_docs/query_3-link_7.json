        "text": "Dear Students,\n\nI want to extend my thanks to you – our new students and rising sophomores, juniors and seniors – and your families for being vigilant, patient, flexible and prayerful during this difficult time!\n\n2020 Fall Semester\n\nLane College will welcome new students (August 1, 2020) and returning students (August 6, 2020) to the campus this 2020 fall semester with a hybrid model combining both face-to-face and online classes.

Housing and Residence Life will provide additional information.\n\nPlease adhere to the move-in schedule provided by Housing and Residence Life.\n\nSeveral of our residential facilities will be single room occupancy only.\n\nHousing and Residence Life will provide updates.\n\nCampus and Community Expectations\n\nWhen on campus, you will be required to WWSS: Wear your mask. Wash your hands. Social distance. Self-check (monitor your own health). Each and every time that you return to campus or leave your residence hall room, you will be required to affirm that you are free of COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nCampus access will be limited to Lane College students, faculty, staff and guests who have checked in through the security office.\n\nCampus Community Support\n\nWell, as you have read, there are many changes. Together, we will have a healthy, safe, and supportive semester with each of us practicing personal responsibility.\n\nLet’s have a great 2020-2021 year!\n\nPlease continue to stay in touch, and know that we are planning every day for your return.\n\nGrace, mercy and peace,\n\nLogan Hampton\n\nPresident"
