        "text": "On 23 April 1879, the Science and Art Department (School of Wood carving) officially opened, founded by Colonel John Donnelly, R. Poynter EDIS, J. H. Donaldson and H. J. Wood.\n\nItalian artist Signor Anton Leone Bulletti was one of the first people to be employed to teach at the school.\n\nIn August, the school transferred to a room at the Royal Albert Hall and reopened in November. In December, they admitted women for the first time.\n\nChurch House school moved to new premises in the Mall at the corner of Hamilton Road, and opened in 1880 as Ealing College, leaving Church House to be demolished in 1882.\n\nBrook Green School of Art was founded in 1881 at Brook Green by Francis Hawke, with the establishment of a few evening classes to prepare students for science and art certificates. It was later renamed to Hammrsmith College of Art and Building.\n\nHammersmith College of Art and Building moved into premises at the junction of Dunsany and Haarlem Roads (later known as Brook Green Studios and now converted into flats).\n\nFulham Commercial Institute becomes the Junior Commercial Evening Institute and now offers courses in 6 locations. The buildings they occupied were utilised as schools for younger children during the day, and institutes for teenage students in the evenings.\n\nHammersmith Day Continuation College opens in Brook Green to provide day-release courses in general, commercial and technical education for younger students already at work but whose employers allow them time during their working week for further education or vocational training at college.\n\nActon Commercial College is moved to the Mall, Ealing, as Ealing College. Grove House is sold to Acton U.D.C. who go on to build a new college.\n\nActon Technical College was built in 1928 on the site of Grove House, High Street, by the county council, as the first of seven colleges to expand further education in Middlesex.\n\nSouthall Technical College opens.\n\nIn November Southall Technical College, comprising an Evening Institute, a Junior Technical School and Technical Day classes, is recognised as a college of Further Education. An expansion of the premises starts.\n\nBy the beginning of the first World War, commercial classes had developed rapidly while Science and Art classes had reduced.\n\nTwo adjacent Commercial Institutes, Fulham and Hammersmith, joined to form the West London College of Commerce.\n\nHammersmith Day College for Further Education in Brook Green is associated with the Shepherd’s Bush Junior Commercial and Technical College. It has 3 branches in the borough of Hammersmith at this time.\n\nHammersmith Day College is divided into a General and Technical Department (Brook Green) and a Commerce Department (day and evening) in Macbeth Street. It still also has its two evening branches in North Hammersmith and Fulham.\n\nOn completing a course at Hammersmith Day College, students are advised to join a senior course at West London College of Commerce.\n\nA site is acquired for the proposed new joint college building, with an estimated cost of £6million. The separate identities of the colleges will be preserved, although students will benefit from shared facilities, such as the common room, main entrance hall, lecture theatres and dining accommodation. Hammersmith College of Art & Building will also have classes in the building.\n\nThe main service areas are designed to act as a noise baffle, where the site borders Talgarth Road, while a concrete roof structure will reduce aircraft noise from the Heathrow flight path above.\n\nIn January, the new building for Hammersmith and West London College is completed in Barons Court at a cost of nearly £7million. All other campuses that were part of the estate are merged into the new site by August, with the exception of Lime Grove, which is retained as a school of building.\n\nThe college rents a block at the former Mary Boon School, called the Avonmore room, to teach catering.\n\nIn January, Ealing, Hammersmith and West London College is formed by the merger of Ealing Tertiary College and Hammersmith & West London College.\n\nThree colleges were part of the Ealing Tertiary College estate – Ealing Green College, Acton College (Mill Hill Road) and Southall Community College (Beaconsfield Road).\n\nOn 29 July, a large fire takes place at Ealing Green College that destroys many valuable historical documents. The fire is a result of an accident at nearby flats, which were being converted into offices.\n\nEaling, Hammersmith and West London College acquires the name West London College from Heriot-Watt University, who had previously used the name for their arts, design and fashion specialist independent school in Mayfair and Marylebone.\n\nLater that year, West London College wins the Times Educational Supplement FE Award for Outstanding Use of Technology for Teaching, Learning and Assessment."
