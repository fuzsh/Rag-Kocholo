        "text": "Testimonials\n\nThe HCLPP always offers me and other students many opportunities. They help to prepare students for college and for life after high school. Without them, there would be no individual and personal guidance as to which way to go after high school, or how to be become the greatest person one can be.\n\n- Cinetta, HCLPP Student\n\nThey gave me the support that I was not getting at home and helped open my eyes and see the best future I can have.\n\n-Yusmary, HCLPP Alumni\n\nI learned how to become a better educator because of the personal time I was able to spend with my students. The students and I have formed such a strong bond that we keep pushing ourselves to try our best because we do not want to let each other down. HCLPP has refined my outlook on teaching and has truly helped me reach my potential as an educator.\n\n-Sajeda, HCLPP Mentor"
