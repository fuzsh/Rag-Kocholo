        "text": "There is a long history of philanthropy associated with the University of Nottingham. From large donations to fund capital building projects through to small gifts to purchase library books, the University and its predecessor, the University College, has benefitted in many different ways from the generosity of individuals and companies.\n\nThese pages give an overview of the role of philanthropy in the history of the University College Nottingham and give information about some of the College’s most important benefactors.\n\nPhilanthropy and the development of the University College\n\nThe original University College was founded in 1877 following a gift of £10, 000 from an anonymous donor. Classes were established in fields such as baking, lace making and textiles as well as in traditional academic subjects. From the beginning the College was keen to establish close ties with the local business community and companies were encouraged to sponsor classes in their field. This resulted in such gifts as £300 from the Drapers Company in 1882 to fund classes in lace making and hosiery. The association between the College and local industry was again demonstrated in 1893 with the opening of a technical school attached to the College, achieved with the support of trade organisations and local businessmen. The College’s own internal community also played an important role in fundraising with students both past and present encouraged to donate to their College. A donation form was included in the back of every College calendar.\n\nOne area in which philanthropy was crucial was in achieving the conversion of the University College into a full University. To acquire full university status was an acknowledged aim of the college for many years prior to its eventual realisation in 1948. In order to be awarded a university charter the college needed to demonstrate that it had local support in the form of an endowment fund. To this end an endowment fund appeal was launched in April 1928.\n\nTwo letters which demonstrate the different size of donations to the College endowment fund.\n\nThroughout its seventy-one year existence donations were crucial in supporting the work of University College Nottingham. People chose to donate in many different ways, from bequests in wills to funding scholarships. The following page provides further information about some of the College’s most influential donors.\n\nNext page: Benefactors of University College"
