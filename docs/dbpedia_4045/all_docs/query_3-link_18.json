        "text": "Class Giving\n\nEach year, Lane College alumni bring new life to the longstanding custom of giving back in honor of their own reunions. As a reminder, all contributions made during our class reunion will count towards your annual giving. Contact De'Shawn Barnes at 731-410-6716 for more information.\n\nThe purpose of the Lane College Office of Alumni Affairs is to promote the mission of the College through the establishment of mutually beneficial relations between the College and its alumni; help support the College through growth and development; and serve, inform, connect, and engage alumni in an effort to cultivate a strong and vibrant community through active lifelong relationships. It further seeks to be the primary conduit for keeping alumni updated and informed with current news, events, and happenings of the Lane College community and its members; utilize technology and other mediums to provide timely, high quality, and succinct communications; and educate, promote and communicate the College's traditions, purposes, growth, and development.\n\nThis office strives to cultivate continuous communication and favorable relationships between Lane College and its alumni, establish programs and events that benefit alumni and Lane College, and enlighten and encourage currently enrolled students to establish giving patterns and become actively involved in College-related programs. As demonstrated by our regular email notifications, this office further enhances the College's reputation by seeking out and promoting alumni success stories in which the College's mission of educating and developing the whole person is demonstrated, and by informing alumni of news that they will find of interest.\n\nNumerous programs and services have been designed to enhance both the student and alumni experience. We are working hard to provide the services that we know are critical to keeping you engaged and connected.\n\nPrograms have been put in place to better enhance the Office of Alumni Affairs which includes:\n\nThe strengthening of the Lane College Pre-Alumni Council to connect our students to alumni and help establish and maintain Lane College traditions.\n\nThe development of a young alumni program to engage our more recent graduates.\n\nThe creation of a comprehensive volunteer program to allow alumni the opportunity of giving back.\n\nNone of these programs will be successful without your personal and financial support, so please consider the ways that you’d like to see yourself involved. Whether it’s attending College-sponsored alumni functions, mentoring a student, or volunteering to solicit monetary contributions to the College, you are needed. The Office of Alumni Affairs exists solely to nurture the close relationship between the College and alumni."
