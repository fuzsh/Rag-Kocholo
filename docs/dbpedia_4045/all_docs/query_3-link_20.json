        "text": "JACKSON, Tenn. - The Lane College department of athletics will welcome nine new members to its Hall of Fame in 2024. The class will be inducted on Friday, October 18th, with a ceremony that coincides with homecoming weekend.\n\nThe Hall of Fame was re-established in 2011 to honor the men and women who have brought distinction both to themselves and to the College through their participation in Lane Athletics.\n\nThe 2024 class includes Leslie Ballard (softball), Greg Moore (football), Chris Rini (football), the 1995 Football team coached by John Gore, the 2005 Men's Basketball team coached by J.L. Perry, Joseph Malone (Men's Basketball), Eric Martinear (football), Daryl Hart (football), and Roger Ogden (coach).\n\nLeslie Ballard\n\nA 2011 graduate of Lane College, Ballard played two seasons for the Dragons and carried a .398 batting average. As a pitcher, she set what was then school records in wins, complete games, innings pitched, and strikeouts.\n\nGreg Moore\n\nA native of Memphis, Tenn., Moore had over 1,000 all-purpose yards for the Dragons while scoring 11 touchdowns in 2013. He was selected first team All-SIAC.\n\nChris Rini\n\nAfter a banner year, Rini was unanimously selected as the SIAC Player of the Year in 2013. He led the conference in passing yards (2,926) and touchdowns (29), while completing 256-out-of-374 passes. As a dual-threat quarterback, Rini also rushed for 519 yards and eight touchdowns. Also the Dragons kicker, Rini connected on 28 of 32 point after attempts, in addition to his four field goals on seven attempts.\n\nThe 1995 Football Team\n\nLed by head coach John Gore, the 1995 team posted the best record in school history, going 9-1 and defeating three Division I (FCS) opponents.\n\nThe 2005 Men's Basketball Team\n\nUnder the leadership of J.L. Perry, the 2005 men's team captured the SIAC tournament championship, defeating Albany State in the title game.\n\nJoseph Malone\n\nA co-captain for two seasons at Lane, Malone was selected All-SIAC on three occasions. He was named team MVP in 1974 and averaged 20.9 points per game and 11.2 rebounds per game over his career.\n\nEric Martinear\n\nRegarded as one of the best offensive linemen in school history, Martinear was named All-SIAC after anchoring a unit that led the SIAC in sacks allowed during the 2006, 2007, and 2008 seasons.\n\nDaryl Hart\n\nA part of the 1982 hall of fame football team, Hart is one of the most dynamic cornerbacks in Lane history. He was named first team All-SIAC in 1982 and 1983 and was drafted in the first round of the USFL draft in 1984.\n\nRoger Ogden\n\nOgden spent nine seasons as head coach of the Lane College softball team, amassing 115 wins and twice being named SIAC Coach of the Year. He built a formidable program that before his arrival had struggled to win any games. His teams twice produced SIAC Player of the Year and accounted for the first All-America selection in program history. His 2014 squad won 20 games for the first time in school history."
