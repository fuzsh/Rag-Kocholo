In addition, the company previously announced a $50M Department of Energy grant opportunity that will partially fund the $200+ million PlusCAM factory.\n\nLane College President Dr. Logan Hampton added, \"I am ecstatic for Amashia and thankful to 6K Energy for working with Lane College in creating the \"$6K for 6K Scholars\" program. We know how overwhelming it can be trying to tackle the cost of college. We recognize the commitment 6K Energy has made with the program and appreciate how they have quickly become a desired employer for students of Lane College.\"\n\nAmashia is a member of the Lane College Power of Potential Scholarship group.
