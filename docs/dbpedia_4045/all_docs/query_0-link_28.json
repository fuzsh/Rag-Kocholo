Regions organizes the campaign as a way to build on the company’s year-round commitment to volunteer service and community engagement. This year’s theme is Back to School. It comes at a time when parents, students and relatives face higher costs for a wide range of good and services, including academic supplies.\n\n“Advancing education is one of Regions’ top priorities for community engagement, so the back-to-school focus for this year’s Share the Good campaign is a natural fit,” explained Regions Community Affairs Manager Wendi Boyen. “Regions Bank teams in several states are developing local Share the Good initiatives that are custom tailored to meet specific needs. While every local outreach is unique, the message is always the same: Regions Bank is committed to supporting education.”\n\nShare the Good initiatives are underway now and will continue through July 29. Among local examples of Share the Good this year:\n\nNashville, Tenn.: Regions associates are collecting school supplies and stuffing backpacks for United Way of Greater Nashville’s Stuff the Bus Campaign. Branch teams are also assembling goodie baskets for teachers.\n\nTampa Bay, Fla.: Regions is supporting both the Tampa and St. Petersburg campuses of Academy Prep Center with a donation for each school.

Additionally, Regions will present a donation to the Shelby County Schools Education Foundation.\n\nKnoxville, Tenn.: Regions teams are gathering school supplies for the local United Way’s Changemobile, a customized Airstream that delivers services and support into local communities. Teams are also making a financial contribution to Junior Achievement of East Tennessee.\n\nMemphis, Tenn.: Regions is sponsoring an investment summer camp called Young Wall Street Traders, which seeks to introduce more young people to financial services careers and bridge the wealth gap among African American and Latino American students. The Memphis Regions team is also supporting the Peer Power Big River Crossing Half Marathon & 10K. The Peer Power Foundation’s mission is to empower and inspire scholars through student-to-student tutoring. Additionally, Regions teams are participating in the Stuff the Bus School supply drive for United Way of the Mid-South.\n\nHouston, Texas: Twelve teams of Regions associates are supporting Junior Achievement of Southeast Texas with a bowling tournament fundraiser.

For example, every year, Regions offers associates a paid day off to volunteer in their community.

Without it, consumers will hesitate\n\nto make the transition to electric vehicles.”\n\nCAP’s letter encouraged state officials to take advantage of the core competencies of the existing private sector retailers, including gas stations, restaurants and others that dot the interstate and have the locations and amenities that customers have come to expect.\n\nThe letter comes in response to the state agencies’ request for comments on its plan to add EV charging stations along key transportation routes in the state. State officials must submit their deployment plans to the U.S. DOT to qualify for up to $13.07 million in 2022 funding from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program.\n\nThe NEVI Program is part of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) that President Biden signed into law in 2021. Tennessee is due to receive $88.3 million in NEVI funding over the next five years. States must turn in their proposals for FY 2022 funding to the federal Joint Office of Energy and Transportation by Aug. 1.\n\nThe Biden Administration is hopeful that NEVI funds will help the country develop a network of 500,000 electric vehicle chargers by the year 2030. The lack of reliable, accessible and affordable high-speed EV charging has been cited in numerous surveys as a top reason that consumers avoid buying an EV.\n\n“An idle charger in a desolate parking lot will do nothing to alleviate range anxiety. In fact, it will have the opposite effect,” Smith wrote. “Consumers should expect to be both comfortable and safe during their charging experience. That means grants should go to private sector partners who are putting their own capital at stake to install chargers. The sooner a marketplace with private sector competitors selling EV charging exists, the sooner more consumers will be comfortable buying EVs.”\n\nCAP represents a coalition of businesses, associations and individuals that share the common goal of efficiently and effectively developing a charging network for EVs across the United States. CAP is hopeful that Tennessee state officials will develop a plan that adheres to federal guidance by incentivizing long-term private investment in this new marketplace, long after NEVI funding has dried up.\n\nGenera has acquired MxG Fiber LLC\n\nVONORE, Tenn. — July 14, 2022 — Genera Energy Inc.

The company supplies customers with domestically sourced and manufactured non-wood pulp and molded fiber products made from locally grown fiber crops and agricultural residues.\n\nAbout Genera Inc.\n\nGenera is a vertically integrated U.S.-based non-wood agricultural pulp and sustainable packaging company.

Teams will design innovative ways to improve accessibility to the food security system, so providers are better positioned to reach and serve those in need.\n\n\"Hunger is limiting, affecting development and overall health, and impairing the ability to learn, work and enjoy a comfortable life. Those experiencing continued hunger often face other issues around housing, childcare, healthcare, transportation, and mental health,\" stated Matt Ryerson, President and CEO, United Way of Greater Knoxville. \"Because food insecurity does not exist in a vacuum, ending hunger means looking at much more than getting enough food to feed those in need. It requires having a holistic system in place that includes a variety of services across the community and ensures access and equity, regardless of circumstances.\"\n\nHow it Works\n\nInterested individuals and teams can register between July 12th and July 25th here (https://www.uwgk.org/fs-hackathon/). Each team will consist of up to 10 individuals and will include at least one Lead Nonprofit Agency.\n\nTeams will be invited to attend an orientation on July 27th at 9 a.m. at the UWGK offices, 1301 Hannah Avenue, Knoxville, TN. Each team will work with their Lead Nonprofit Agency and have access to members of the UWGK and other organizations within the food security system to feed their ideation and develop solutions.\n\nTeams will get together to develop innovative ways to increase food access and equity among marginalized communities in Knoxville. They will brainstorm ideas, design their solution, and submit a plan via an online form.\n\nMeetings and communications will occur at each team's discretion. Teams will submit their concepts by September 5th for a review by a panel of judges. Three teams will be selected to pitch their idea at an event on September 27th and the winning team will be awarded a $20,000 UWGK grant to take the next steps towards implementing their concept with the help of their Lead Nonprofit Agency.\n\nCo-creating Change\n\n\"United Way of Greater Knoxville launched a Food Security initiative last August for food system stakeholders, community residents, policymakers, nonprofit leaders, and community-based organizations to create a more just and equitable local food system. Through opportunities like the Unite for Change Food Security Social Hackathon, we can conceive and build a future together where no one goes hungry, enabling healthier, more productive, and economically viable lives and a stronger community here in Knoxville,\" added Ryerson.\n\nAbout United Way of Greater Knoxville\n\nUnited Way of Greater Knoxville is part of United Way Worldwide, the largest charitable organization in the world. Through more than 112 programs in nearly 48 different agencies, United Way of Greater Knoxville is an innovative problem-solver and facilitator of social change dedicated to creating a more equitable Knoxville with stable housing, financial security, quality early care and education, access to food, and more.

(Nasdaq/NGS: PNFP) today announced that Pinnacle Bank will make significant changes this summer to its overdraft services program by completely eliminating one fee, lowering another and introducing features to further reduce the total cost incurred by its clients in a single day.\n\nEffective Aug. 1, 2022, Pinnacle will:\n\nEliminate the Non-Sufficient Funds (NSF) fee for returned items for consumer accounts. This fee occurs when Pinnacle returns a check or ACH transaction due to insufficient funds in the account.\n\nReduce the NSF returned item fee from $38 to $30 for business accounts.\n\nReduce the Overdraft fee for paid items from $38 to $30 for consumer and business accounts. This is the fee Pinnacle charges for the service to pay an item even though the client does not have enough funds in the account.\n\nIntroduce an overdraft cushion of $15 for consumers. Consumer accounts can be overdrawn by up to $15 before an overdraft fee would be charged. As a result, clients won’t be charged an overdraft fee until payment of the first item that causes the account to be overdrawn by more than $15.\n\nReduce the maximum number of Overdraft Paid Item charges per day from five to three for consumers. By reducing the fee and the number of charges consumer clients can receive in a day, the maximum possible charge per day will be reduced by more than 50 percent, from $190 to $90.\n\nPinnacle will continue its longstanding practice of offering Overdraft Protection for no charge. This service gives clients who opt in the ability to link accounts so funds can be transferred automatically to avoid an overdraft.\n\n“We believe clients appreciate the service we provide by paying the item even when their balance is low, and fee reductions and the introduction of a cushion should make a significant difference to those who use it most often,” Pinnacle President and CEO Terry Turner said.\n\nThe firm anticipates that the changes listed above will result in revenue loss of approximately $3.0 million, on an annual basis, beginning Aug. 1, 2022.\n\n“While Pinnacle doesn’t rely on fee income from overdraft and NSF as much as many other banks because we focus on commercial clients, we believe these changes will lead to even greater client loyalty as we continue to demonstrate our interest in their financial success,” Turner said. “We also think making these modifications to our fee practices will help prepare us for new regulations that may come in the future.”\n\nLearn more about Pinnacle’s overdraft services program and available tools to help avoid fees altogether at PNFP.com/Overdraft.\n\nPinnacle provides a full range of banking, investment, trust, mortgage and insurance products and services designed for businesses and their owners and individuals interested in a comprehensive relationship with their financial institution. The firm is the No. 1 bank in the Nashville-Murfreesboro-Franklin MSA, according to 2021 deposit data from the FDIC, is listed by Forbes among the top 25 banks in the nation and earned a spot on the 2022 list of 100 Best Companies to Work For® in the U.S., its sixth consecutive appearance. American Banker recognized Pinnacle as one of America’s Best Banks to Work For nine years in a row and No. 1 among banks with more than $11 billion in assets in 2021.\n\nPinnacle owns a 49 percent interest in Bankers Healthcare Group (BHG), which provides innovative, hassle-free financial solutions to healthcare practitioners and other licensed professionals. Great Place to Work and FORTUNE ranked BHG No. 4 on its 2021 list of Best Workplaces in New York State in the small/medium business category.\n\nThe firm began operations in a single location in downtown Nashville, TN, in October 2000 and has since grown to approximately $39.4 billion in assets as of March 31, 2022. As the second-largest bank holding company headquartered in Tennessee, Pinnacle operates in 15 primarily urban markets across the Southeast.\n\nAdditional information concerning Pinnacle, which is included in the Nasdaq Financial-100 Index, can be accessed at www.pnfp.com.\n\nManagement Consulting Company Thrivence launches as part of Barge Design Solutions\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn.

Thrivence will help companies meet the challenges of today’s business environment.”\n\nUT Medical Center forges innovative partnerships with nursing schools to combat nursing shortage\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. (Jul. 11, 2022) – COVID-19 significantly worsened the shortage of registered nurses (RNs) across many parts of the U.S. Comprising approximately one-third of a typical hospital workforce, RNs are essential to patient care and high-quality outcomes. Thus, new, innovative solutions are required to address unprecedented nursing workforce challenges in East Tennessee.\n\nThe University of Tennessee Medical Center (UTMC) has teamed up with the University of Tennessee (UT) College of Nursing and Lincoln Memorial University Caylor School of Nursing (LMU-CSON) to develop academic - practice partnerships. The intent is to attract and retain baccalaureate prepared RNs committed to serving the health care needs of patients in East Tennessee, not only today but in the future.\n\n“We are building upon our long-standing relationships with the UT and LMU colleges of nursing to create mutually beneficial partnerships to address our region’s complex and unprecedented nursing shortage,” said Dr. Sandy Leake, Senior Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer at UTMC.\n\nThese partnerships will provide early career development and growth opportunities for Bachelor of Science Nursing (BSN) students through mentorship with UTMC RNs. Employment is guaranteed during the program and results in a service commitment upon completion of a BSN.\n\n“The University of Tennessee Medical Center is thrilled to partner with UT College of Nursing and LMU Caylor School of Nursing to find innovative approaches that will build and sustain a robust pipeline of high-quality BSN graduates. These nurses will likely live, work, and remain in our community, ensuring a long-term continuum of patient care,” said Leake. “The programs are designed to provide hands-on learning and clinical experience by working with RNs in the region’s only Magnet®-Designated hospital and to guarantee post-graduation employment.”\n\nUTMC has partnered with UT College of Nursing to create a Nurse Scholars Program providing substantial financial support to BSN students. UTMC will use endowment funding to provide tuition assistance for 8-12 student scholars annually, combined with a tuition discount offered by the UT College of Nursing.\n\n“UT College of Nursing is excited to create a win-win partnership with UT Medical Center,” said Victoria Niederhauser, Dean of the college. “We are able to reduce the financial burden for nursing students while supporting the workforce needs for our clinical partners.”\n\nThe partnership with LMU-CSON will provide substantial financial support to BSN students through a Nursing Excellence Program. UTMC will offer annual tuition assistance for up to 10 Excellence in Nursing students, who will also receive discounted tuition from LMU. LMU-CSON will expose middle school students to health care careers and recruit high school students through health science clubs, health-related affinity groups and health care career camps. This multi-faceted partnership will utilize co-branded messaging, digital marketing, co-hosted job fairs and shadowing opportunities for potential participants.\n\n“East Tennessee has long been classified as medically underserved. The pandemic has only exacerbated nursing shortages,” said Dr. Jody Goins, LMU Executive Vice President for Administration. “The LMU Health Science Institute will provide nursing touch points for students as early as middle school and hopefully inspire more students choose nursing for a career. LMU is excited to enter into this partnership with UT Medical Center to train East Tennessee students to serve our communities for generations to come.”\n\nAbout The University of Tennessee Medical Center:\n\nThe mission of The University of Tennessee Medical Center (UTMC), a Magnet® recognized hospital also certified by The Joint Commission as a Comprehensive Stroke Center, is to serve through healing, education and discovery.

For the first time since 2019, the sneaky literary character will be hiding inside downtown merchants in his signature stripes, the Downtown Knoxville Alliance has announced.\n\nThe fifth annual scavenger hunt is happening July 1-31 with a record-number of merchants participating. More than three dozen downtown shops, restaurants, museums and other organizations will display a cutout of Waldo. All players need to do is pick up a passport at a participating business, which can be identified by a window cling at the entrance, and ask for a passport stamp once they find the fellow in black-rimmed spectacles. The free Knoxville Trolley will help participants explore the city and collect stamps.\n\n“We are excited to welcome Waldo and thousands of players back to Downtown Knoxville this summer,” said Michele Hummel, executive director of the Downtown Knoxville Alliance. “In 2019, more than 5,000 people participated, and we are anticipating even larger crowds this summer as families explore the area and enjoy all the fun along the hunt.”\n\nSteadfast seekers who collect 20 or more stamps can enter to win Waldo books from Union Ave Books.

It’s designed to help manufacturers connect with each other, find local and domestic suppliers, explore production capabilities, and manage their supply chain such as identifying single supplier risks and finding opportunities for diversification.\n\n“The UT Center for Industrial Services is always looking for ways to help Tennessee manufacturers achieve their goals,” explains UT CIS Executive Director Paul Jennings. “We see CONNEX™ Tennessee as a great resource to help our state’s manufacturers mitigate supply chain risks, become stronger and grow.”\n\nCONNEX™ Tennessee is also supported by the Tennessee Chamber of Commerce and Industry whose President and CEO Bradley Jackson said, “For manufacturers, the pandemic demonstrated just how vulnerable supply chains are. Many manufacturers are now searching for ways to domestically or locally develop supply chains to protect their operations from additional supply chain disruptions. We hope that Tennessee manufacturers will be a part of the CONNEX™ Tennessee program which can help solve some of these problems.”\n\nTo help manufacturers develop more reliable supply chains and find alternate suppliers, the CONNEX Tennessee platform will help manufacturers identify potential suppliers within the state based on their capabilities, not just current production. Results can then be filtered using hundreds of unique criteria such as equipment, processes, materials, certifications and more to meet a manufacturer’s specific needs.\n\nIn addition, disruptions to existing supply chains have resulted in shortages of materials and inputs to manufacturing processes, which is hampering productivity and profitability of Tennessee manufacturers. CONNEX Tennessee will offer manufacturers the ability to post requests for information (RFIs) and requests for quotes (RFQs) for such items in the platform's B2B Exchange Center to which qualified suppliers may directly respond to the post with their capabilities and availability. These platform features will help Tennessee manufacturers quickly find the materials and inputs they need to meet their productivity and profitability objectives, while improving supply chain robustness for downstream manufacturers as well.\n\nThe CONNEX Marketplace technology was developed several years ago by i5 Services to connect the U.S. manufacturing supply chain. It’s now being used by manufacturers and suppliers across the country to connect with each other and find new business opportunities. Tennessee is the seventh state to roll out the CONNEX Marketplace™ platform, joining Missouri, Kansas, Florida, Oklahoma, Michigan and Utah. In each state, the platform is managed by a MEP center to provide a coordinated approach to outreach and direction for users.\n\n“We are thrilled to have UT CIS and the Tennessee Chamber sponsor and support CONNEX Tennessee,” said President and CEO of i5 Services Alan Davis.. “It’s a sign of their strong leadership and commitment to the Tennessee manufacturing industry which is one of the pillars of the Tennessee economy.”\n\nFree registration for Tennessee manufacturers and suppliers will begin on June 22, 2022 when the platform officially launches. In the meantime, more information can be found at: https://www.cis.tennessee.edu/connex-tennessee/connex-tennessee-faqs\n\nAbout the University of Tennessee's Center for Industrial Services\n\nUT CIS, an agency of the UT Institute for Public Services, is a member of the NIST Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) National Network™. The MEP National Network is a unique public-private partnership that delivers comprehensive, proven solutions to U.S. manufacturers, fueling growth and advancing U.S. manufacturing. It’s focused on helping small and medium sized manufacturers generate business results and thrive in today’s technology driven economy.\n\nAbout Tennessee Chamber of Commerce & Industry\n\nAs the Tennessee affiliate of the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Chemistry Council, the Tennessee Chamber works today with its national and state business allies to maintain a strong, healthy business climate in Tennessee for companies to grow, to profit, to expand and to hire.\n\nAbout CONNEX Marketplace by i5 Services\n\nFounded in 2009, i5 Services develops solutions to significantly improve complex technical processes among various industries. They are working to connect the U.S. and global manufacturing supply chain into a single platform, which will solve many of the world’s supply chain issues. Called CONNEX Marketplace, this online platform connects manufacturers and suppliers into an accurate, searchable supply-chain database allowing Primes, OEMs and governments to post their needs and quickly find suppliers based on deep data such as equipment, certifications, capabilities and more.

It’s the latest example of the impact the tiremaker has achieved through commitment to one of its core values, sustainability.\n\nNokian Tyres’ three-megawatt solar panels fully power the administration building at its Dayton, Tennessee campus and power a portion of production, which is ramping up to full capacity. In the first half of 2022, that solar energy helped the Dayton Factory conserve the equivalent of:\n\n1,074,469 miles driven by an average passenger vehicle\n\n2,024,350 pounds of coal, or\n\n55,313 gallons of gasoline\n\nThe solar panels have produced more than five million kilowatt-hours of energy since monitoring began in 2021, an average of 10,300 kilowatt-hours per day. That amounts to savings equivalent to more than 11,000 pounds of coal each day.\n\n“Sustainability is a core value of our company, and our production facility is a strong example,” said Nokian Tyres Dayton Factory EHS Manager Darren Bakkestuen. “We remain committed to minimizing our environmental footprint while making safe, sustainable tires at a world-class facility.”\n\nThe Dayton Factory is the only tire production facility in the world to earn LEED v4 Silver certification. The administration building on the production campus earned LEED v4 Gold certification last year. The latter is fully powered by energy generated by onsite solar panels and features employee amenities such as a sauna, gym and canteen.\n\nLast October, Nokian Tyres received the Tennessee Governor’s Environmental Stewardship Award, the highest sustainability honor in the state, for its extensive environmental efforts in Dayton. And the Chattanooga Regional Manufacturers Association awarded Company of the Year honors to Nokian Tyres in 2021 as a tribute to its workforce impact, safety policies and sustainable practices. The tiremaker is a member of the Natural Treasures Alliance of Thrive Regional Partnership, an organization that supports responsible growth in the Greater Chattanooga region.\n\nThe company makes sustainability a priority in its products, too. Nokian Tyres was the first tire company to remove high-aromatic oils from its tire compounds, and around 90 percent of its tires are in the lowest categories of rolling resistance, helping reduce emissions and maximize fuel efficiency.\n\nNokian Tyres began producing tires at the Dayton Factory in 2020 to better serve its customers and craft tires tailored to the needs of North American drivers. At full capacity, the Dayton Factory will produce nearly 4 million tires per year. The company employs approximately 350 workers at the facility.\n\nTo learn more about Nokian Tyres’ presence in Southeast Tennessee, visit NokianTires.com/DaytonFactory.

The White House event will offer a sector-wide display of cooperation between Cherokee Health Systems, its private sector peers, and federal health systems.\n\nCherokee Health Systems recognizes that climate change and the reduction of carbon-intensive practices must be addressed as part of comprehensive efforts to protect human health, well-being and equity. CHS has reduced carbon emissions with its support of a hybrid work-from-home model, especially for clinicians who live at some distance from their primary clinical location. CHS stopped the practice of mailing registration packets to all new patients, which has reduced paper use and waste. Most CHS clinics also have a system in place to recycle plastic, aluminum, tin, and cardboard, and CHS considers carbon-reduction and energy efficiency during all new construction and remodeling projects as well as purchases of day-to-day operating supplies.\n\nDr. Khatri stated, “As a community health center, we see first-hand the disproportionate impact of climate change on populations who are under-resourced and historically marginalized. Addressing climate change is important in our mission to improve the health and well-being of people we serve. For Cherokee Health Systems, joining this pledge acknowledges our commitment to health equity and good stewardship of our precious resources.”\n\nIn September 2021, 200 medical journals named climate change the number one threat to global public health. Millions of people living in the United States already experience associated harm —with disproportionate impacts on disadvantaged and underserved communities—through more frequent and intense periods of extreme heat, wildfires, flooding, vector-borne diseases and other factors that worsen chronic health conditions.\n\nThe Office of Climate Change and Health Equity (OCCHE), part of HHS under the Assistant Secretary for Health, developed the health sector climate pledge in conjunction with the White House to help focus industry response to climate change. In addition to reducing their carbon footprint, signatories also commit to producing detailed plans to build climate resilience for their facilities and the communities they serve.\n\nThe June 30, 2022 White House event included leaders from companies and organizations representing hundreds of hospitals and numerous health centers, as well as pharmaceutical companies, medical device-makers, suppliers and group purchasing organizations. The health care sector accounts for approximately 8.5 percent of U.S. domestic climate-warming emissions.\n\n“Public health decisions have to be based on the realities of climate change, and we all need to do more to make that happen at the national level,” said ADM Rachel Levine, the Assistant Secretary for Health. “We’re seeing right now what extreme temperatures and more severe storms can do to human health, environmental quality and our physical infrastructure. It’s great to see so many different companies and organizations come together to decarbonize and become partners in protecting human health from climate change. Today’s announcement is just the beginning of a longer ongoing effort with partners from across the medical sector, which is exactly the kind of big response we need as a country.”\n\nFor more information about how Cherokee Health Systems is responding to our nation’s climate challenges, visit Climate Network Organizations - National Academy of Medicine (nam.edu)."
