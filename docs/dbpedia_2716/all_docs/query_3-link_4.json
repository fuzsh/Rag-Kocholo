        "text": "Abstract: New information on some Heterocera families in Turkey (Lepidoptera). Misc. Pap. 176: 1-38, 96 figs. In this paper, faunistically important 107 species of 17 moth families from Turkey are discussed. New records for Turkey, provinces, and districts are reported. Adults and genitalic slides of some species are also illustrated. Dyspessa tsvetaevi (Cossidae), Isturgia suleiman (Geometridae), and Agrotis pierreti (Noctuidae) are considered as new records for the fauna of Turkey. Anarsia innoxella is recorded as a new species for Asia Continent. Recurvaria sp. and Euscrobipalpa sp. (Gelechiidae) are briefly discussed. Two new larval food-plant records, Acer monspessulanum, Frangula alnus are reported. The male genitalia of Choreutis muhabbet (Choreutidae) is given here for the first time.\n\nThis study contributes to the Heterocera fauna of eastern Turkey. The paper presents a faunal list of 208 moth species belonging to 15 families, Arctiidae, Ctenuchidae, Cossidae, Drepanidae, Lasiocampidae, Lemoniidae, Lymantriidae, Notodontidae, Noctuidae, Psychidae, Pyralidae, Sphingidae, Thaumetopoeidae, Thyatiridae and Zygaenidae from Maden district of Elazığ Province. Among these moths, 150 species are recorded for the first time in Elazığ Province.\n\nThis paper deals with the comments on their first mtCOI sequences of two subspecies, Arctia caja roshengul and Phragmatobia fuliginosa paghmani (Arctiidae) from Uighur Ili. Their identities at the subspecies level are discussed from the molecular standpoint.\n\nOn the Heterocera fauna of Lower Aras Valley in NE Turkey (Lepidoptera). Misc. Pap. 186: 1-57, 21 figs, 26 maps. This paper deals with the Heterocera fauna of Lower Aras Valley in NE Turkey. Totally 302 species of 24 families are listed alphabetically together with their synonyms and distributional information. Some faunistic and taxonomic remarks are added. The affinity of the faunal elements between Aras Valley and Central Asia is discussed.\n\nIn this paper, 333 species of 21 families of Lepidoptera are listed from Mutki district (Bitlis Province, East Turkey). Faunistically, 38 species are reported here as new to Mutki district. Similarly, 43 species are recorded here new for the fauna of Bitlis province. A nomenclatural remark is given to Polyocha transversariella (Zeller,1848). Morphological, faunistical comments or evaluations are mentioned for some species. Field observations are supported by the images taken in nature. Illustrations of the adults with their genitalia, tympanal organs, and head are given, if necessary.\n\nOn a collection of Lepidoptera from Dağlıca (SouthEast Turkey, Hakkari Province). Cesa News 139: 1-24, 42 figs. In this paper, a collection of Lepidoptera from Hakkari Province, vicinity of Dağlıca, is evaluated faunistically. Nearly 900 specimens collected were identified as 189 species of 25 families. Faunistically 58 taxa at species level are new to Hakkari Province. Male and female genitalia, tympanal organs, abdominal skins, or antennae are prepared and illustrated. They are evaluated for the purpose of identification of the taxa or morphological comparison required.\n\nAbstract: Annotated list of the Heterocera (Lepidoptera) of Anamur district (İçel Province, South Turkey) with description of a new species. Priamus 19 (1): 1-72, 87 figs. In this paper, 341 species of 29 heterocera families are reported from Anamur district (İçel Province, South Turkey). A new species, Cnephasia anamuria sp.n.

A new subspecies, Pelochrista dagestana ssp. n. alpicola is described in the family Tortricidae, with an individual new form. Totally 46 behavioural images in nature are given. Genitalia and some tympanal organs are prepared and illustrated. Totally 44 dual maps are prepared for this paper. Faunistically one species was found in Turkey for the first time, while 24 moth species were new to the Van Province.\n\nOn the fauna of Macro-Heterocera of Bahçesaray district, with some eco-faunistical notes (Van Province, East Turkey) (Lepidoptera). Priamus 14 (3): 121-159, 43 figs. 36 maps. This paper deals with the Macro-Heterocera fauna of Bahçesaray. Totally 55 species of the following 14 families, Zygaenidae are given. The species are listed alphabetically, together with their synonyms, original references, and distributional information as codes. Auto-ecological data to the species are added. Observational information in nature are illustrated. Illustrations of several genitalic preparations are given. Totally 36 triad distributional maps are prepared. Together with the previous contributions, all the species are new to the district. Among them, 7 species are new to Van Province."
