        "text": "This article follows several previous catalogues of moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera) of Slovakia and updates the current list of 3598 Lepidoptera species occurring in Slovakia. The list is conceived according to the latest taxonomy and systematics of Lepidoptera. Based on the extensive critical review of the overall list of known species of Lepidoptera found in Slovakia, species for which no data are available for more than 50 years, species with the wrong determination, wrong synonymic names or the absence of documented records were eliminated. We have added a brief comment to species with only sporadic information. For all species the authors have listed the first literary source and have added an exhaustive review of published papers on the first findings of Lepidoptera from Slovakia. The paper is also dedicated to the hundredth anniversary of the birth of prominent Slovak lepidopterist, Prof. Andrej Reiprich."
