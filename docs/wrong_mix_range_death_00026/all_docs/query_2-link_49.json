        "text": "The 25th President of the United States, William McKinley, was assassinated on September 6, 1901, inside the Temple of Music on the grounds of the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York.\n\nMcKinley was shaking hands with the people when he was shot by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist. The President died on September 14 from his bullet wounds in Buffalo, New York, aged 58. It was later known that Czolgosz killed the president to try to advance anarchism.\n\nNot less than two months later Czolgosz was executed on October 29, 1901. Vice President Theodore Roosevelt became America's 26th President of the United States of America.\n\nImages for kids\n\nLeon Czolgosz\n\nWilliam McKinley (to the left of center, with white shirtfront) delivers his final speech.\n\nPresident McKinley arrives at the Temple of Music\n\nThe operating room at the Exposition hospital\n\nSenator Mark Hanna (left), friend of President McKinley, arriving at the Milburn House after the shooting\n\nMilburn residence, where McKinley died\n\nSee also"
