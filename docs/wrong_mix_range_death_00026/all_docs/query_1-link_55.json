        "text": "There is a bloody history of US presidential assassination attempts: four US presidents have been killed, others targeted, and a number of candidates as well.\n\nThe attempted assassination of Donald Trump, who escaped with a bullet wound to his ear while he was speaking at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, joins a long list of moments of extreme political violence.\n\nAndrew Jackson\n\nAndrew Jackson was the first American president to experience an assassination attempt on 30 January 1835.\n\nThe seventh president of the United States was leaving the Capitol building in Washington DC when he was confronted by a man aiming a pistol at him - which misfired.\n\nAccording to reports, Jackson confronted the gunman - unemployed house painter Richard Lawrence - hitting him several times with his walking stick.\n\nLawrence pulled out a second pistol and misfired again. He was detained by Jackson's aides.\n\nAbraham Lincoln\n\nOne of the key moments in American political history is the assassination of Abraham Lincoln on 14 April 1865.\n\nHe was the first American president to be assassinated after being shot in the head by John Wilkes Booth.\n\nThe American Civil War was over and President Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States and a Republican, had the task of reuniting and rebuilding a divided nation without slavery.\n\nOne evening, he was watching the popular comedy Our American Cousin at Ford's Theatre in Washington DC with his wife Mary Todd Lincoln, when Booth snuck into the presidential box and shot him in the back of the head.\n\nBooth leapt from the box and yelled \"sic semper tyrannist!\" - the Virginia state motto meaning \"thus always to tyrants\" - at the audience.\n\nLincoln was taken to a house across the street from the theatre for medical treatment. He died the next morning at the age of 56.\n\nHis support for black rights has been cited as a motive behind the killing. Two years before the shooting, President Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation granting freedom to slaves within the Confederacy.\n\nBooth was shot and killed on 26 April 1865, after he was found hiding in a barn near Bowling Green, Virginia.\n\nJames Garfield\n\nJames Garfield was the second president to be assassinated - by a disgruntled Republican constituent - six months after taking office, while walking through Baltimore and Potomac train station in Washington on 2 July 1881.\n\nThe former Union general and Ohio congressman, who became the 20th US president, was on his way to catch a train to New England when he was shot by Charles Guiteau.\n\nGuiteau fired two shots at the president - one grazed his right arm, the other struck him in the lower back.\n\nAlexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, tried unsuccessfully to find the bullet lodged in President Garfield using a device he designed specifically for the president.\n\nThe mortally wounded president lay at the White House for several weeks and died in September after he was taken to the New Jersey shore.\n\nGuiteau was found guilty and executed in June 1882.\n\nWilliam McKinley\n\nWilliam McKinley, the 25th president of the United States, was shot six months after the inauguration of his second term.\n\nHe had just given a speech in Buffalo, New York, on 6 September 1901 and was shaking hands with people passing through a receiving line outside the Temple of Music when a man fired two shots into his chest at point-blank range.\n\n\"There was an instant of almost complete silence, like the hush that follows a clap of thunder,\" the New York Times later wrote.\n\n\"The president stood stock still, a look of hesitancy, almost of bewilderment, on his face. Then he retreated a step while a pallor began to steal over his features. The multitude seemed only partially aware that something serious had happened.\"\n\nDoctors had expected President McKinley to recover - but gangrene then set in around his bullet wounds and brought on a severe case of blood poisoning. He died eight days later on 14 September 1901, with his wife Ida by his side.\n\nLeon F Czolgosz, an unemployed Detroit resident and self-proclaimed anarchist, admitted to the shooting.\n\nThe 28-year-old was found guilty at trial and put to death in the electric chair on 29 October 1901.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt\n\nTheodore Roosevelt was in Milwaukee while campaigning to return to the White House having previously served two terms as president.\n\nRunning again as a third-party candidate, he was getting into his car outside the Gilpatrick Hotel on 14 October 1912 when he was shot.\n\nFolded papers and a metal glasses case in his pocket apparently blunted the bullet's impact and Roosevelt, frequently referred to as Teddy, or TR, was not seriously hurt.\n\nAccording to reports he ordered his aides get him to the Milwaukee Auditorium where he was due to give a speech, and told his audience, \"Friends, I shall ask you to be as quiet as possible\", before delivering the bombshell: \"I don't know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Fortunately I had my manuscript, so you see I was going to make a long speech, and there is a bullet - there is where the bullet went through - and it probably saved me from it going into my heart. The bullet is in me now, so I cannot make a very long speech, but I will try my best.\"\n\nOnly after the speech did he agree to be taken to hospital and recovered from the attack.\n\nJohn Schrank was arrested over the shooting and spent the remainder of his life in mental hospitals.\n\nFranklin D Roosevelt\n\nFranklin D Roosevelt was the president-elect and had just given a speech in Miami, Florida, from the back of an open car when gunshots rang out.\n\nThe 32nd president of the United States was not injured in the 15 February 1933 shooting.\n\nAll five gunshots missed him - but did hit bystanders. Four received minor injuries, but one fatally wounded Chicago mayor Anton Cermak.\n\nGuiseppe Zangara, an Italian immigrant and unemployed bricklayer was convicted in the shooting and sentenced to death.\n\nShooting from about 25 feet away, reports suggested he missed because he was only 5ft 1in tall and had to climb up on a wobbly chair to see over the crowd. A woman stood near him also claimed to have hit his hand during the shooting.\n\nHarry S Truman\n\nThe 33rd president of the United States was staying at Blair House, across the street from the White House which was being renovated, when two gunmen broke in on 1 November 1950.\n\nPresident Truman and his wife were upstairs when they heard gunshots - fired by would-be assassins Griselio Torresola and Oscar Collazo.\n\nThey escaped unscathed, but a White House policeman and one of the assailants - Torresola - were killed in an exchange of gunfire. Two other White House policemen were wounded.\n\nTorresola and Collazo were political activists and members of the extremist Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, a group fighting for full independence from the US.\n\nCollazo was arrested and sentenced to death.\n\nIn 1952, President Truman commuted the sentence to life in prison.\n\nHe was released from jail in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter.\n\nJohn F Kennedy\n\nThe assassination of President John F Kennedy is perhaps the most famous of all time.\n\nThe 46-year-old was fatally shot by hidden assassin Lee Harvey Oswald who was armed with a high-powered rifle.\n\nThe 35th president was travelling through Dallas, Texas, in an open-topped car with his wife Jackie on 22 November 1963.\n\nShots rang out as the president's motorcade turned past the Texas School Book Depository at Dealey Plaza as crowds lined the streets.\n\nPresident Kennedy was shot in the neck and head and was rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital, where he died soon after.\n\nHe was succeeded by vice president Lyndon B Johnson, who was sworn into office in a conference room aboard Air Force One - the only president to take the oath of office on an airplane.\n\nHours after the assassination, police arrested Oswald after finding a sniper's perch in the Texas School Book Depository.\n\nTwo days later, Oswald was being taken from police headquarters to the county jail when Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby rushed forward and fatally shot him on live TV.\n\nRobert F Kennedy\n\nThe brother of President John F Kennedy was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination when he was killed at a Los Angeles hotel.\n\nThe 42-year-old US senator from New York was shot in a kitchen corridor outside the ballroom of the Ambassador Hotel - moments after his victory speech for winning the 1968 California primary.\n\nFive other people were wounded in the 5 June 1968 shooting. Kennedy died the next day.\n\nSirhan Sirhan was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death.\n\nThat was commuted to life in prison, where Sirhan remains after his latest petition for release was denied last year.\n\nGeorge C Wallace\n\nGeorge C Wallace was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination when he was shot during a campaign stop in Maryland on 15 May 1972.\n\nThe incident left him paralysed from the waist down.\n\nThe governor of Alabama was known for his segregationist views, which he later renounced.\n\nArthur Bremer, 21, was convicted in the shooting and sentenced to prison. He was released in 2007.\n\nGerald Ford\n\nThe 38th president faced two assassination attempts within weeks and escaped both uninjured.\n\nThe first attempt took place on 5 September 1975 while Ford was on his way to a meeting with California's governor in Sacramento when Charles Manson disciple Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme pushed through a crowd in the street, drew a semi-automatic pistol and pointed it at Ford. The gun wasn't fired.\n\nFromme was sentenced to prison and released in 2009.\n\nSeventeen days later, Sara Jane Moore confronted the president outside a hotel in San Francisco.\n\nMoore fired one shot and missed. A bystander grabbed her arm as Moore attempted a second shot.\n\nShe was sent to prison and released in 2007.\n\nRonald Reagan\n\nRonald Reagan was leaving a speech in Washington DC and walking to his motorcade when he was shot by John Hinckley Jr who was in the crowd outside the Washington Hilton Hotel.\n\nHinckley fired six shots - hitting the 40th president of the United States and three others including President Reagan's press secretary, James Brady, who was partially paralysed as a result.\n\nPresident Reagan, apparently unaware that he'd been shot, was shoved into his limousine by a Secret Service agent and rushed to hospital.\n\nThe 70-year-old was shot in the left lung - the bullet just missing his heart - and survived the assassination attempt.\n\nAccording to reports, as he was treated and prepared for surgery, he said to his wife Nancy, \"Honey, I forgot to duck\" - and to his surgeons, \"Please tell me you're Republicans\".\n\nHinckley was arrested and confined to a mental hospital after a jury found him not guilty by reason of insanity over the shooting.\n\nIn 2022, Hinckley was freed from court oversight after a judge determined he was \"no longer a danger to himself or others\".\n\nGeorge W Bush\n\nThe 43rd president was attending a rally in Tbilisi on 10 May 2005 with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili when a hand grenade was thrown toward him.\n\nBoth men were behind a bulletproof barrier when the grenade, wrapped in cloth, landed about 100 feet away.\n\nThe grenade did not explode, and no one was hurt.\n\nVladimir Arutyunian was convicted and sentenced to life in prison."
