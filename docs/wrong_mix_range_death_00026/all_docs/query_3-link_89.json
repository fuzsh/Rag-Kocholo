        "text": "Ida Saxton McKinley was the wife of William McKinley, the 25th President of the United States. She served as First Lady from 1897 to 1901.\n\nEarly Life\n\nIda Saxton was born in Canton, Ohio, on June 8, 1847, to James and Kate Saxton. She enjoyed a privileged upbringing, attended private schools, and traveled extensively in Europe. Ida was working as a teller at her father’s bank when she met Maj. William McKinley, a local lawyer who was working to build his practice.\n\nMarriage to William McKinley\n\nIda married William McKinley on January 25, 1871, at Christ Presbyterian Church in Canton, Ohio. The couple had two daughters; Kate was born in 1871, and Ida was born in 1873. Tragically, Ida lived a few short months, and Kate passed away at the age of five. Coupled with the death of her mother, Ida never recovered.\n\nIn addition to her grief, Ida suffered from headaches and seizures, which were likely caused by epilepsy. Because the doctors didn’t know how to treat her condition, her health suffered, and she was often under the influence of strong medications.\n\nA devoted husband, William McKinley tailored his life, including his political career, around his wife’s needs. Ida accompanied William to Washington, D.C., when he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. During his tenure as Governor of Ohio, she lived with him in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nFirst Lady of the United States\n\nWilliam McKinley was elected President in 1896. Ida McKinley’s illness forced her to forgo many of a First Lady’s traditional hostess duties. However, she still served as a valued confidant and adviser to her husband and attended as many events as she could. When Ida McKinley was not available, Jennie Tuttle Hobart, wife of Vice President Garret Hobart, would often take her place.\n\nAt state dinners, President McKinley insisted that his wife be seated next to him rather than at the other end of the table in case she had a seizure. At receiving lines, she remained seated. President McKinley’s devotion to his wife made him popular among many in Washington. “President McKinley has made it pretty hard for the rest of us husbands here in Washington,” Senator Mark Hanna stated.\n\nLater Life\n\nUnfortunately, tragedy followed Ida McKinley to the White House. When William McKinley was shot by an assassin on September 6, 1901, his first thought was how it would impact his wife. Ida was by his side when he died days later. After her husband’s death, Ida McKinley returned to Canton, where she was cared for by her sister. She died in 1907. Ida McKinley is buried with her husband and her daughters at the McKinley Memorial Mausoleum in Canton, Ohio."
