The collection also includes copies of outgoing letters signed by presidential secretaries John Addison Porter and George B. Cortelyou.\n\nNotable correspondents include Alvey A. Adee, R. A. Alger, John Rutter Brooke, Joseph Hodges Choate, Grover Cleveland, Henry Clark Corbin, Shelby M. Cullom, Charles Gates Dawes, William R. Day, Joseph Benson Foraker, John Fowler, Lyman J. Gage, James A. Garfield, James Albert Gary, Murat Halstead, Marcus Alonzo Hanna, John Hay, Rutherford B. Hayes, Garret A. Hobart, Philander C. Knox, Henry Cabot Lodge, John Davis Long, John Tyler Morgan, Henry C. Payne, Thomas Collier Platt, Theodore Roosevelt, Elihu Root, John Sherman, William H. Taft, James Wilson, Leonard Wood, and John Russell Young. Additional correspondents represented in the Addition series include James G. Blaine, William E. Chandler, Charles Foster, Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen, Robert Todd Lincoln, and Levi P. Morton.\n\nThe Index to the William McKinley Papers, created by the Manuscript Division in 1963 after the bulk of the collection was microfilmed, provides a full list of the correspondents and notes the series number and dates of the items indexed. This information is helpful in finding individual letters or documents in the online version. Additional letters received by the Library after 1963 are not listed in this index.\n\nA current finding aid (PDF and HTML) to the William McKinley Papers is available online with links to the digital content on this site.\n\nBrief History of the William McKinley Papers\n\n“Generally speaking, President McKinley did not write letters on important government matters. When occasion arose, members of Congress or others interested were asked to call at The White House, where the matter would be discussed.” This was the comment of George B. Cortelyou in a letter written on October 21, 1935, to J. Franklin Jameson, chief of the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress, a few weeks after the McKinley Papers were sent to the Library.\n\nCortelyou served as an executor of McKinley’s estate with Supreme Court Justice William R. Day, but Cortelyou took the responsibility for most matters relating to McKinley’s literary remains. Cortelyou was devoted to the memory of the martyred president and intended to write a biography of McKinley, but a busy and distinguished career of his own left him no time for this task. For a generation, the Library of Congress corresponded with Cortelyou about the McKinley Papers. In March 1905, Worthington C. Ford, then chief of the Manuscript Division, first wrote to Cortelyou about the papers. In reply, Cortelyou declared his intention to present the papers to the Library but deferred action. Other Library officials communicated with Cortelyou from time to time until 1935, when he retired and sent the papers to the Library. The papers were then organized and the more important manuscripts were bound in a series of 86 volumes. Some years later, the press copies of outgoing letters were rebound into 99 volumes. Cortelyou controlled access to the papers until his death in 1940, after which his son, George B. Cortelyou, Jr., continued to exercise such control until 1954. Additions to the papers of William McKinley are comprised of material received by the Library after the original portion of the collection was prepared for description and microfilming in 1963.\n\nBesides the records created during the years when McKinley was governor of Ohio, no other large group of McKinley manuscripts is known to exist. The paucity of McKinley Papers is explained in part by his personality and his habits. He excelled in private conference and personal interview but avoided letterwriting whenever possible, and when letters had to be written he wrote them with great caution and circumspection. His official biographer explained that “. . . as a rule, McKinley did not commit to paper his plans and purposes, nor his inmost thoughts and aspirations. He much preferred a meeting, face to face, and a confidential talk.” As a member of Congress in the late nineteenth century, he had neither office space nor a secretary. His Washington office was no more than an extra room adjoining a small suite at the Ebbitt House. Only in his last term, while writing the tariff bill, did he have the regular services of a stenographer. It may be that McKinley, like many members of Congress of this period, discarded at the close of a congressional term most of the files accumulated in the preceding two years, for there is no evidence of any deliberate destruction of any of McKinley’s papers after his death.\n\nA fuller history of the provenance of the collection was prepared for the Index to the William McKinley Papers, pp. v-vi, and was subsequently reproduced in the finding aid (PDF and HTML). A version appears on this website as the essay Provenance of the William McKinley Papers.\n\nDescription of Series"
