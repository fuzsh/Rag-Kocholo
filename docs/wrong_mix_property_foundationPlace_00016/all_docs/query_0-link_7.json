        "text": "Last year my son and I were invited to perform in a holiday revue with a local group of singers and dancers, most of whom would qualify as seniors. There were young children and families in the show as well, but the bulk of the performers were from a generation I’ve now learned is termed the “Golden Boomers”—those folks born at the front end of the Baby Boomer generation who comprise more and more of the general population. The master of ceremonies (a Broadway veteran) commented upon looking at the range of ages onstage (roughly three to 90 years) on how ageless art is. Certainly art is ageless in theory, but I wondered how many opportunities are out there for folks as they move through each consecutive decade. Some folks will tell you the roles have dried up. Others say they’ve never been busier.\n\nSo I decided to look at the opportunities across the Bay Area for folks who fit this demographic and have had a life in the theatre, or maybe just harbor a dream to tread the boards someday. Yes, roles exist here and there in the mainstream theatre for people “of a certain age”—the occasional grandparent or maybe even a King Lear—but these can hardly be enough to satisfy and utilize this bulging Boomer population. So where does a 60-something-plus go for broader opportunities in the Bay Area or to hone and update his or her skills?"
