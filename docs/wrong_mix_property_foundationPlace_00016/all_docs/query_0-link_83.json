        "text": "9 /10 Telegraph expert rating\n\nIt's so good you'll want to keep this glorious Highland gastronomic hideaway a secret. Take a cookery masterclass before a superb dinner, then enjoy true contentment as you sit by the fire pit outside your pleasingly simple bedroom, drinking in the shadowy hills and starry skies. Read expert review\n\nFrom\n\n£ 125\n\npn\n\n9 /10 Telegraph expert rating\n\nAn iconic resort hotel lightly dusted with jazz-age glamour, dripping in luxury with an added measure of fun. With quietly classy bedrooms, masses of country pursuits, championship golf courses, a fabulous spa and two-starred Michelin food, there’s a little bit of (expensive) heaven for everyone, and worth every penny. Read expert review\n\nFrom\n\n£ 1,525\n\npn\n\n9 /10 Telegraph expert rating\n\nLeave modern Scotland firmly behind on the sinewy single track road that leads off in search of Monachyle Mhor. This pioneering working farm has conjured up both a superb restaurant and sumptuously stylish bedrooms one step beyond the middle of nowhere. Cosy up in the main house, or enjoy the off-kilter outbuildings. Read expert review\n\nFrom\n\n£ 238\n\npn\n\n9 /10 Telegraph expert rating\n\nStylish, cosy, comfortable and fun, this eight-room hotel in a quiet Highland village is an unexpected outpost of simple design-led chic serving the kind of food you’d happily queue for in London. It’s no wonder the locals are beating a path to the door; you’d do well to follow their lead. Read expert review\n\nFrom\n\n£ 110\n\npn\n\n9 /10 Telegraph expert rating\n\nChances to stay in private historic houses of this quality and character are vanishingly rare. This isn’t your typical b&b, but with gorgeously grand public rooms, just two charming bedrooms and a vast park with endless views, it’s a stately property on a homely scale in a usefully central location. Read expert review\n\nCheck availability for dates and prices\n\n9 /10 Telegraph expert rating\n\nYes, beds are four-postered, bathrooms luxurious, alpaca throws insanely soft. It’s all darkly dramatic and the bijou bar has a fabulously frivolous pink Murano glass chandelier. But these are mere, if attractive, distractions from the abiding passion of this Highland retreat: intriguing, imaginative, memorable food. Read expert review\n\nFrom\n\n£ 220\n\npn\n\n9 /10 Telegraph expert rating\n\nThis 19th-century inn is set on the banks of the River Tay in the village of Dunkeld. The property has undergone a series of reincarnations, taking it from a bank to a Victorian temperance hotel to a famous folk music bar. Its latest guise is a hip gastropub with rooms and one of Scotland's biggest beer gardens. Read expert review\n\nFrom\n\n£ 391\n\npn\n\n8 /10 Telegraph expert rating\n\nThe former country house of the Dukes of Atholl is now a resort hotel offering country pursuits in a picture perfect riverside setting outside the prettiest village in Perthshire. Behind the stained glass you’ll find snazzy bedrooms, a busy restaurant and inviting bar, along with an indoor pool and a spa. Read expert review\n\nFrom\n\n£ 208\n\nper person\n\n8 /10 Telegraph expert rating\n\nKinloch House offers Relais & Chateaux comfort and polished food in a warm, welcoming environment. Within 40 minutes’ drive you can find the ski slopes at Glenshee, hiking trails in the Cairngorms National Park, several world-class golf courses and fishing on the salmon-rich River Tay. Read expert review\n\nFrom\n\n£ 320\n\npn\n\n8 /10 Telegraph expert rating\n\nAn unexpectedly funky option in Rob Roy country. Mhor 84 has chucked away the tartan and embraced a fresh aesthetic, though with the comforts of log fires and squishy sofas. There’s all this plus fine food, walks right outside the door and excellent live music nights. Read expert review\n\nFrom\n\n£ 150\n\npn"
