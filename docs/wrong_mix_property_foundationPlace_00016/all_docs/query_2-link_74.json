Events with multiple co-organizers/partners are particularly welcome.\n\nPART III: Contributions to ESCAP Programme of Work and Regional Institutions\n\nWith the support of member State donors and partners, ESCAP has, over the years, contributed considerably to the development of Asia and the Pacific by establishing several key regional institutions; negotiating crucial agreements; undertaking quality normative and analytical work; advocating policies to address critical and emerging issues; and building capacities of its members to address development challenges facing the region.\n\nAt the Commission session every year, members and associate members of ESCAP indicate their support, both in-kind and financial, to the ESCAP programme of work and the regional institutions.\n\nThe contributions to the ESCAP programme of work supplement regular budget resources and help us address development challenges facing the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nESCAP's regional institutions (APCICT, APCTT, APDIM, CSAM and SIAP) are hubs of capacity building in focused areas directly linked to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They also act as a platform for exchanging good practices among member States, fostering South-South cooperation. The viability of these regional institutions is largely dependent on the financial and in-kind contributions provided by their host Governments as well as the voluntary contributions made by other donors. In its resolution 71/1, the Commission encouraged all members and associate members of ESCAP to make the necessary regular annual contributions to the regional institutions.\n\nIn this regard, we would like to invite all members and associate members to consider making or increasing their pledge for financial support to the ESCAP programme of work and the regional institutions at the seventy-eighth session of the Commission, to be held in Bangkok and online from 23 to 27 May 2022.\n\nPledges can be made by filling out the pledging form and emailed to <[email protected]> with a copy to <[email protected]>. Pledges can also be announced during the deliberations on Agenda Item 5 (b): Overview of partnerships, extrabudgetary contributions and capacity development.\n\nThe ESCAP secretariat expresses its appreciation to member and associate members for the commitment and ongoing support to the work of ESCAP.\n\nFurther information can be obtained by contacting:\n\nMs. Zeynep Orhun Girard\n\nChief, Capacity Development and Partnerships Section\n\nStrategy and Programme Management Division\n\nUnited Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific\n\nOffice: +66 22 88 1672\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nPART IV: Visa exemption request\n\nAwaiting for confirmation from Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Thailand on the arrangements.\n\nESCAP facilitates request for visa exemption upon arrival only for delegates who are from a country which does not have Thai diplomatic mission in their country. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, kindly note that this arrangement may be subject to change by the host country authorities.\n\nDelegations are requested to complete the Visa Exemption Form electronically and return it via email to [email protected] with copy to [email protected] by Friday, 29 April 2022.\n\nPART V: Protocol arrangement\n\nAwaiting for confirmation from Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Thailand on the arrangements.\n\nPlease note that owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, information concerning any change to protocol arrangements will be updated as soon as practicable.\n\nESCAP provides protocol arrangements for delegates at the ministerial level and above.
