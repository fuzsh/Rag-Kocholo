        "text": "Nice line up. These pics were taken in Atlin, British Columbia.\n\nShort Skyvan N549WB (c/n SH.1911) among the weeds. Reg'd 13Sep2011 to North Star Air Cargo Inc.,\n\nEast Troy,WI. Kenneth Swartz photographed it at Perris,CA 14Mar20.\n\nShort Skyvan N754BD (c/n SH.1907). Reg'd 19Sep2011 also to North Star Air Cargo.\n\nN754BD was registered in Nov16 for Alaska Air Taxi, but last sighted on 10Jul16 at Perris,CA missing 1 engine.\n\nKenneth Swartz photographed it at Perris 14Mar20, parked but looking operational.\n\nShort Skyvan C-FYSQ (SH.1968) 'Nomad Air'.\n\nA recent history. I took a photo of it on 23Jul03 while parked near Lake Hood (Anchorage) and found it had been registered on 22Feb99 to A.G.Sholton Company, and operated by Pioneer Airways as N491AS . And again reg'd on 23Oct06 A.G.Sholton Company, Anchorage.\n\nThen on 13aug12 it was registered to Ten Barrel Inc of Whitehorse, Yukon with tailnumber C-FYSQ.\n\nDid not last long as its registration was cancelled on 25Oct13 and the Skyvan was sold to Airborne Support Group LLC, Marion,MT while registered N52LH on 29Oct13.\n\nShort Skyvan N114LH (SH.1926).\n\nN114LH was at some point reg'd to Lawrence E.Hill but then sold to Aero Transit on 20Jan06.\n\nNext was Alberta Aircraft Leasing Inc, Las Vegas,NV (R17Mar10). Bought by Arizona Skydive Inc 14Apr10.\n\nIn Oct.2010 it went to Alaska for Wild Bill's All West Freight Inc. at Delta Junction,AK.\n\nAfter Wild Bill's death in a plane crash N114LH was reg'd on 19Sep11\n\nto North Star Air Cargo of East Troy, Wisconsin.\n\nKyle G. Cameron commented: Nomad Air did a lease-return on C-FYSQ and was sold State-side, as was N114LH (above). The others in Atlin are sitting for the time-being, under the care of Jamie B Tait; other than C-FTBI (further below) which still belongs to Nomad Air.\n\nShort Skyvan N50DA (SH.1852).\n\nN50DA was registered to All West Freight Inc. of Delta Junction,AK on 13May02.\n\nReg'd 13Sep11 to North Star Air Cargo of East Troy,WI\n\nUPDATE: in June 2016 an opportunity arose for an update on these Skyvans stored at Atlin.\n\nMurray Lundberg wrote on Facebook: \"The Shorts are all working out of Whitehorse now, for Nomad Air.\"\n\nKenneth Swartz photographed N50DA 14Mar20 at Perris,CA: R17Oct14 to PM Leasing Inc., probably\n\noperated by Perris Valley Skydiving.\n\nShort Skyvan C-FTBI (SH1847).\n\nFormer N64HB went to to Alkan Air of Whitehorse, Yukon Territory and reregistered C-FTBI on 19Apr07.\n\nI received comment that N64HB never went to Alkan Air but a photo by Terry Fletcher on www.aerialvisuals.ca proofs it, text stated that titles were found to be applied by 24May2008.\n\nWhen reg’d N64HB it was operated by Advanced Air (source: photo July 2002 on www.abpic.co.uk)\n\nKyle G. Cameron commented: \"When Alkan Air was operating C-FTBI (s/n 1847), it was owned by Ten Barrel Inc, dba 'nomad air' (see photos above), which when written as the logo or trademark, is not capitalized. It would however, be correct English grammar to capitalize it when used in a sentence.\n\nBob Garrard’s photostream on Flickr.com has the following information to it:\n\n\"Short SC-7 Skyvan 3-200 (cn SH1847). This Skyvan served numerous operators, and included the registrations\n\nG-AWKV, N735R, 4X-AYZ, SX-BBW, N80DA, C-GDRG, PT-WKU, PT-WYA, N64HB and C-FTBI.\"\n\nThe Short SC.7 Skyvan is a 19-seater twin turboprop aircraft manufactured by Short Brothers of Belfast, Northern Ireland. It is used mainly for short-haul freight and skydiving.\n\nUnidentified HU-16 Albatross at Santa Rosa on 30Jul2013; I quite like the distortion by the heatwave here!\n\nCould it be any of the planes I've seen at Santa Rosa in 2008?\n\nRoger later wrote me: \"The HU16 is N7973B,\n\naccording to the guy that runs the Albatross web site, so I think its good data.\"\n\nThat would make it a Grumman G-111 c/n 1311 and former 'Billabong Clipper', according to my database -Webmaster\n\nAlso seen here at Sonoma County Airport, Sta.Rosa,CA:\n\n131594/RT, Douglas C-118A (c/n 43697) officially registered as N777SQ to the museum here).\n\nSee also my 2008 photo when it was still sitting among the weeds. Nice work they've done on it!\n\nBtw, two DC-6's wore N777SQ as a tailnumber, c/n 44071 from 1975 - 1979 and c/n 43697 from 1982 - present.\n\nDouglas C-47A N4991E (c/n 12106) seen parked at Lodi, California.\n\nI've seen reports it was stored, even in use as a clubhouse for the Parachute Center, but it looks like it could fly!\n\nUpdate: acquired by Preferred Air Parts of Kidron,OH and reported as being prepared for ground transport in Oct.2020. I also photographed it in 2018, see my CALIFORNIA 2018 report.\n\nRoger wrote: \"A visit to Sacramento McClellan airfield found 7 of the Aero Union fleet of P3's.\"\n\nSee what I wrote on defunct Aero Union in 2008"
