        "text": "Lufthansa, part of the Lufthansa Group, is one of the world’s largest and most prestigious airlines as well as the first European 5 star airline. The airline is widely known for its premium services. Lufthansa has recently invested in introducing and upgrading a wide range of products and services, including our Signature Service in Business Class on our long-haul services.\n\nThe Lufthansa Group comprises Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Eurowings, Lufthansa and SWISS. It is the airline group with the largest network in the world. We offer well-timed, easy transfers from Glasgow and Edinburgh as well as numerous UK and Irish airports via the efficient hubs of Vienna, Brussels, Dusseldorf, Cologne, Frankfurt, Munich, Geneva and Zurich to over 400 global destinations.\n\nAdditionally, March 2018 saw the further expansion of Glasgow for Lufthansa. Lufthansa now operates a new daily flight from Glasgow to Frankfurt flying 7 times a week and has even expanded its Glasgow to Munich service to 5 times a week. All flights will be serviced with the Airbus A320 family.\n\nAnnouncing the new flight, Andreas Koester, Senior Director Sales UK, Ireland & Iceland, Lufthansa Group said: “This new daily service opens up a huge number of business and leisure opportunities to Scottish passengers. Not only does it provide access to one of Europe’s financial capitals, but it also introduces new options for onward travel to hundreds of worldwide destinations. Passengers are now able to travel to both Frankfurt and Munich, giving them more flexibility and increased connections to numerous destinations in our large, multi-hub network. We have been able to increase Lufthansa’s flight offer at Glasgow from a single weekly service to 12 flights a week in just 6 months. This level of growth is almost unprecedented and underlines the importance of Glasgow Airport within the Lufthansa worldwide network.”\n\nFurthermore as a business customer you can reward your business travel with our Lufthansa PartnerPlusBenefit programme – a loyalty programme that’s all about rewarding you and your company for your business travel. It is designed to make your travel budget go further while giving some great benefits along the way. After all your hard work, we believe you deserve to be rewarded.\n\nSo how does it work? Each time any colleague of your company travels with one of the airline partners – any Lufthansa Group carrier plus Air Canada, United, TAP, LOT and ANA – your company will earn BenefitPoints. These can be exchanged for a range of exclusive benefits that will make business travel easier and more budget friendly, like award flights, upgrades, hotel eGiftcards, limousine transfers or carbon offsetting. You can also exchange them for business, office and lifestyle accessories in our online WorldShop. You can even swap them for cashback – very wallet friendly.\n\nPartnerPlusBenefit is the first programme of its kind, letting you collect rewards for flying with a total of 10 airlines. And with so many flights covering well over 500 worldwide destinations, building up your BenefitPoints is easy.\n\nTogether the Lufthansa Group offers customers the best possible combination of all travel options. By harmonising our schedules and having joint airport facilities we create a seamless travel experience with a large, modern and environmentally friendly fleet, and we look forward to welcoming you on board soon."
