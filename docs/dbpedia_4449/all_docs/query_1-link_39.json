        "text": "The Daily Herald was a British national newspaper published between 1912 and 1964. At one point, it was the top-selling newspaper in the world, with a monthly circulation of more than 2 million.\n\nEvery photograph and negative taken for the newspaper was stored in a picture library, categorised and filed for easy access should they ever be needed again. This amazing collection—comprising 3.5 million photographs, contact sheets and glass negatives—is the Daily Herald Archive, which we now care for at the National Science and Media Museum here in Bradford.\n\nThis story is based on a selection of images from the archive.\n\nWhaling for profit: Modern times\n\nNorth American whaling declined on the East Coast in the early 20th century, but continued on a small scale along the West Coast until the 1970s. Today, it is still practised by some small communities, such as the Makah tribe in northwestern America.\n\nIn comparison, Norway, Japan and Iceland became much bigger players in commercial whaling during this period. From the 19th century European whalers increased their activity in Iceland, hunting blue and fin whales, while whalers in Japan started to adopt more modern methods of whaling, hunting the North Pacific right, humpback, fin and grey whales. Whalers in Japan became very heavily involved in commercial whaling during the 20th century.\n\nIn Norway, Svend Foyn—considered the father of modern whaling—invented, among other things, a steam-powered whale catcher in 1863, and held a monopoly on whaling in Norway between 1873 and 1883. After the monopoly broke, Norwegian whaling competition multiplied and, due to depleted stocks, expanded whaling activities to Iceland and beyond.\n\nWith the introduction of new technology in the 20th century, the whaling industry surged, and British and Norwegian whalers dominated the industry. Britain provided a lot of the capital, while Norway organised many of the expeditions and improvements. In the first decade annual catches rose from 2,000 to 20,000. This rose exponentially and reached a peak of 66,000 in 1961.\n\nFloating ship factories, some fitted with aircraft for whale spotting, replaced many shore stations just before the First World War, enabling whalers to reach previously unreachable waters. Early factory ships were converted merchant vessels.\n\nDuring the 1930s, the number of catchers per factory ship rose from four to eight, and ships became much faster. This enabled whalers to better hunt swimming rorqual whales like the huge blue whale.\n\nHuge factory ships were built after the Second World War, as whale oil and flesh became increasingly important to supplement fat and meat rations. From the 1960s, as whale populations continued to decline, many European companies started to withdraw from the whaling industry. No large factory ships sailed after 1978, but small-scale whaling and whaling for scientific purposes continue to this day.\n\nWhales are huge; the blue whale is the largest mammal on the planet. They can grow up to 33 metres long and weigh up to 180 tons. So how can humans, tiny by comparison, overpower these gigantic creatures of the sea?\n\nThe method for catching whales has evolved over millennia as humans have moved from small-scale whaling to commercial whaling and have adapted to developments in technology.\n\nEarly whalers caught small, coastal whales that came to breed in bays near the coast. Some communities only took whales that had already washed up on shore, usually dead. Early Japanese whalers used nets, while Aleut communities used poisoned spears. Inuit communities were able to go further afield and hunt whales from their boats.\n\nBasque whalers targeted the slow-moving whales that came into the Bay of Biscay, chasing them in small rowboats and striking them when they got close enough. They often sat in watchtowers, called vigias, to try and spot the distinctive twin vapour spouts of the North Atlantic right whale.\n\nThe harpoon—a long, spear-like instrument—has been the most common method of killing whales for thousands of years. Early whalers would hand throw harpoons, sometimes several at a time, to prevent the whale from getting away before it could be killed with a more effective instrument at close range.\n\nWith commercial whaling came a need for faster, more efficient methods of killing, and soon harpoons could be shot from guns attached to factory ships. If several whales were being pursued at once, they would be inflated with compressed air so they could float before being collected.\n\nFactory ships were fitted with winches attached to claws that would fasten around a whale’s tail and haul it up from the water to the ship’s deck to be dismembered. Breechloader guns were introduced in 1924 and electric harpoons that caused instant death were used from the 1960s. As the widespread slaughter increased in the 20th century, whales became more and more cautious, so aeroplanes were often used during big expeditions to help locate schools of whales.\n\nSave the whales\n\nBy the early 20th century, severe overfishing left many species of whale nearly extinct. Responding to concerns from whalers and conservators, the League of Nations proposed an international conference in 1927 on whale conservation. The conference was rejected by many nations and ultimately never went ahead; nevertheless, this development marked the first step towards whaling regulation. Then in 1931, several nations signed an agreement called the Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, although it was very limited and eventually superseded in 1937.\n\nFinally, in 1946, the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) was established, with the International Whaling Commission (IWC) as its decision-making body. Effective from 1948, the IWC initially came together with 15 whaling nations. It continued to grow, and has a current membership of 88 countries across the world.\n\nThe IWC set several restrictions in 1946, including a prohibition on killing grey, humpback and right whales and a seasonal limit of killing whales in the Antarctic region. Hunting seasons were fixed and a maximum quota of 16,000 was also set for the ‘blue whale unit’ (or BWU; one unit could include 2 fin, 2.5 humpback or 6 sei whales).\n\nDespite good intentions, these restrictions actually served to increase competition between whaling countries. They encouraged a period of intensive whaling as whalers sought to reach their quotas within a smaller timeframe. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, quotas were set but exceeded—or sometimes not set at all—and there was a lot of backlash, with some countries leaving the IWC.\n\nBy 1970, many species of whale were severely depleted. The anti-whaling movement gained a lot more support following the release of an album in 1970: Songs of the Humpback Whale by biologist Roger Payne. This album featured some of the first recordings of vocalisations made by humpback whales using a hydrophone (an underwater device for the recording of ocean sounds). It showed that whales didn’t just make noises, but had their own language and could communicate with each other. The album was very popular and went on to sell over 100,000 copies.\n\nCommercial whaling was finally banned by the IWC during the seasons 1986–90. This moratorium still holds today, though it is not honoured by all countries.\n\nNorway formally objected to the ban in 1986 and continued whaling, citing ‘scientific purposes’ at first. However, they soon resumed commercial whaling and it continues today. Japan continued to hunt whales after the ban, also citing ‘scientific purposes’. It then left the IWC in 2019 and resumed commercial whaling.\n\nIceland accepted the ban on commercial whaling at first, but continued a small-scale whaling programme, again citing ‘scientific purposes’. Iceland left the IWC in 1992 but rejoined in 2002 with a ‘reservation’ against the ban, continuing to hunt commercially between 2006 and 2018. Whaling in Iceland paused in 2019 but may resume in 2022.\n\nEvery year, roughly 600–800 pilot whales are killed in the Faore Islands as part of ‘the grind’, a ritual dating back over 1,000 years. On 12 September 2021, there was outcry from international audiences and local residents when 1,428 Atlantic white-sided dolphin were killed during one drive hunt. The scale of the slaughter forced the government of the Faroe Islands to re-evaluate some of its practices.\n\nSimilarly, concern among locals and health authorities about the high levels of certain contaminants found in whales, such as mercury and PCBs, are causing more and more people to question this ancient tradition."
