        "text": "Founded in 1927, Pan American (also known as Pan Am) opened regular commercial service throughout Latin America using both flying boats and land planes. Pan American was barred from U.S. domestic routes in return for exclusive rights to international routes. In 1935, Juan T. Trippe, founder of Pan American, introduced the first regularly scheduled transpacific service with the famous Martin M-130 China Clipper. He opened regular transatlantic service in 1939 with the Boeing 314 flying boat. Its overseas monopoly lasted until World War II, and its domestic restriction until 1978.\n\nJuan T. Trippe\n\nFor over 40 years, Pan American was the embodiment of its dynamic founder, Juan T. Trippe. During the 1930s, he inspired the famous \"Clipper\" series of Sikorsky, Martin, and Boeing flying boats. In the 1940s, he bought the pressurized Boeing 307 and Lockheed Constellation and opened the first around-the-world service.\n\nIn the 1950s, Trippe introduced the jetliner to America, sponsoring both the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8. In the 1970s, he again set the pace with the wide-body Boeing 747. Pan Am struggled after Trippe retired and the industry was deregulated. It ceased operations in 1991.\n\nFrom his office in New York City, Pan American president Juan T. Trippe used this globe to plan his airline's expansion around the world. Trippe often would stretch a string between two points on the globe and calculate the distance and time it would take for his airliners to fly between them. Made in the mid-1800s, this globe was featured prominently in many publicity photos of Trippe, and it became part of Pan Am's and Trippe's public image.\n\nSee the globe\n\nNew Competition for Pan Am\n\nTranscontinental and Western Air, with its well-developed domestic network and proven record of overseas war service, quickly became a serious competitor to Pan Am. To reflect the airline's new international status, majority shareholder Howard Hughes changed the airline's name to Trans World Airlines (TWA). Northwest Orient expanded across the Pacific to the Far East. Braniff Airways extended into South America. American Airlines also began international service, but withdrew a few years later.\n\nBoeing 707\n\nPan American introduced overseas flights on 707s in October 1958. National Airlines soon began domestic jet service using a 707 borrowed from Pan Am. Boeing's 707 was designed for transcontinental or one-stop transatlantic range. But modified with extra fuel tanks and more efficient turbofan engines, 707-300s could fly nonstop across the Atlantic. Boeing built 855 707s.\n\nThe Pratt & Whitney JT3 revolutionized air transportation when it entered service on the Boeing 707 in 1958. The new turbojet engine was a commercial version of the U.S. Air Force's J53, introduced in 1950. In the early 1960s, the JT3 was modified into a low-bypass turbofan-the JT3D. The first three compressor stages were replaced with two fan stages, which extended beyond the compressor casing to act like propellers. The resulting increase in airflow lowered fuel consumption, noise, and emissions. JT3Ds became widely used, especially on long-range Boeing 707-300s and Douglas DC-8s.\n\nBoeing 747\n\nPan American and Boeing again opened a new era in commercial aviation when the first Boeing 747 entered service in January 1970. Designed originally for Pan American to replace the 707, the 747 offered far lower seat-mile costs. It carried 400 passengers (and later versions even more)â€”more than twice the passengers than the 707 carried. Other wide-body designs soon followed, such as the three-engine McDonnell Douglas DC-10, Lockheed L-1011 TriStar, and the twin-engine Airbus A300.\n\nWith its high-bypass turbofan engines and immense seating capacity, the Boeing 747 revolutionized air travel by making flying more affordable. The 747 quickly became the airliner of choice for long-range service."
