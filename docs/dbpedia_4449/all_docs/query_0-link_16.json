        "text": "Aston Down was a RAF airfield in Gloucestershire which still operates a gliding club. For many years it was the home to the central stores that supplied the Ministry of Aviation and its any successors. Here was the home of watch logs, movement logs, notam forms, flight progress strips, MOTNE pads, met observation forms and the entire logistical underpinning of the air traffic services.\n\nThe archives include a good selection of photos. The photos were all taken on November 8th 1985, is it an open day, official visit or retirement? In stock control there are some monitors, I’m assuming early computers but maybe they are microfilm or microfiche readers.\n\nAD1\n\nAD2\n\nAD3\n\npresumably the two photos above are stock control\n\nAD4\n\nAD5\n\nAD6\n\nAD7\n\nAD8\n\nAD9\n\nAD10\n\nAD11\n\nAD12\n\nAD13\n\nAD14 this 1957 photo just came in from Barry Davidson entitled 1957 “Airfield Devils Churchyard: Cherington Tetbury, “. Cherington is only a couple of miles from Aston Down.\n\nPhil Williamson says “Here are a couple of Photos of Wyton Tower from around 2002 ish when VT Aerospace were running the place. The controllers featured are Sally Belshaw and John Hudson. I include a copy of the cheat sheet I devised for QGH approaches !”\n\nQGH approach see Chapter 10, page 29 on this link and here is a video\n\nThanks to Bob Vandereyt for a quick ident of this as Wyton, an earlier photo than the others above.\n\ntwo photos by John Freeman at RAF Cosford Show in June 2018, of a Runway Caravan that has been around a bit and is now restored.\n\nTerry Clark reminds us that “Corgi Toys did a version of the Karrier Bantam with an ACR-7/424 scanner on the roof.(Number 1106)”\n\nHandley Page HP-81 Hermes 4 G-ALDA in the background. Any ideas on a location?\n\nHere is a copy of the RAF station brochure, published after 1953 the latest date mentioned in the Text.\n\nRAF Luqa information booklet 1954 or later\n\nMaltese takeover of ATC in Malta 1979\n\nC-47 N481F of LAVCO (Libyan Aviation Company)\n\nRAF LUQA in the 1950s, the tower in the background. Three Vikings on the apron, on the left two Hunting Clan aircraft and on the right a Trek Air Coach System Viking.\n\nUSAF Fairchild C-119 “Flying Boxcar” 12608 on No 2 Aircraft Park\n\nFrench Airforce Nord Noratlas 63-VH at Luqa, nice view of the tower.\n\nPlenty of BEA activity on No 1 Aircraft Park, the military No 2 Park is in the distance with a Britannia and maybe a Valetta parked up. There is a Hastings on the Runway.\n\nLightnings of 56 Squadron at Luqa.\n\nRoyal Air Force de Havilland DH106 Comet R2 XK659 at RAF Luqa. the aircraft was originally registered to British Overseas Airways Corporation as G-AMXC on 8th January 1953, was purchased for the Royal Air Force on 2nd March 1955\n\nIt was purchased by the Compass Catering Company on 13th May 1974 and flown to Manchester Airport on the same day where it was disassembled for movement to Pomona Dock for use as a restaurant. It was eventually scrapped in late 1981\n\n“While taxiing, the engine number four failed to start due to a starter issue. The captain decided to increase speed, hoping to start the engine by windmilling the propeller. When the engine started, the pilot was unable to stop the aircraft in a timely manner. The airplane veered off taxiway, lost its undercarriage and came to rest against a small embankment. All three crew members were unhurt while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.”\n\nEE Canberra PR7 WT538 and an anonymous Nimrod coded 61"
