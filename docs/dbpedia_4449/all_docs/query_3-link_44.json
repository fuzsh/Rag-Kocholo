The Arrow had a target maximum velocity of Mach 1.9, nearly twice the speed of sound, achievable thanks to all-new Iroquois turbojets from Avro-owned Orenda Engines.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nDon't navigate the car buying road alone!\n\nJoin our thriving community on social media and connect with other car searchers and enthusiasts.\n\nArticle content\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nThe Ferguson Super Sport was a homemade sports car built from the Avro Arrow's ashes Back to video\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nWhen the nascent Arrow program was cancelled by Prime Minister Diefenbaker in February 1959, many of the engineers behind the plane and those turbojets were rendered jobless. At least one, Ross Ferguson, found himself looking not only for work, but for a project into which he could channel his untapped ingenuity. He found the former at Northern Secondary, teaching machine shop to tenth-graders; and the latter in a sports car he’d already started building from scratch.\n\nAs it turns out, a lot of the skills Ferguson honed at Orenda Engines as a machinist developing tooling for those Iroquois turbojets could be directly transferred into the design and fabrication of a Le Mans-inspired homebuilt roadster. The late Mr. Ferguson – along with his wife Blanche, who’d worked in the Orenda front offices – had planned this build for almost a decade, but in 1959, its construction began in earnest. Eight years later, in 1967, the garage of their little bungalow in Downsview had parked in it a car unlike any other.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe Ferguson Super Sport “was designed and constructed as an engineering exercise to explore the theories of chassis and suspension design,” the man wrote in his notes back then. It sits on a bespoke large-diameter tube frame, made up of two main rails braced by a drilled-and-dimpled X-shaped crossmember and three bulkheads. Highly modified McPherson struts underpin the independent front and rear suspension, with longitudinal torsion bars mounted above the frame helping out up front.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nPower comes from a Hi-Po Ford 289-cubic-inch V8 crate engine, good for about 271 horses; those ponies are routed through a three-speed manual encased in a rear transaxle, mounted to the frame. All of that grunt spins a set of 15-inch rims custom-cast from aircraft-grade A280 magnesium. The wheels use a knock-off hub nut, and are arrested by a set of inboard, chassis-mounted disc brakes with Dunlop racing calipers, front and back. The wheelbase stretches about 90 inches, the height comes in at 44-and-a-half, and curb weight is an estimated 1,800 lbs, says Ferguson’s notes.\n\nAnd all that is to say nothing of the exquisite cloth-and-polyester-fibreglass bodywork covering it all up, crafted and styled together by Ross and Blanche. “[I got my inspiration from] looking at magazines over the years, and I would kind of draw it, take it with me wherever I was working, then stay up half the night redoing my drawings,” says Blanche, now 93. Keen eyes will spot plenty of Jaguar and Ferrari influence in the car’s lines, with a bit of AC sports car mixed in. The panel gaps and general finish are near-perfect, and accessories like bumpers and door handles are deliberately absent.\n\nArticle content\n\nHow exactly did the Fergusons pull it all off? That’s a question very much on the mind of the car’s new owner, Chris Atkins of Courtice, Ontario, who acquired the Super Sport from the Ferguson family in 2020 after Ross’s passing in late 2019; he’s currently trying to reverse-engineer its construction so he can perform a handful of minor repairs. “The uniqueness of the car and its parts—it terrifies me, yeah,” chuckles the experienced exotic-car mechanic.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe car and its history remains virtually unknown to anyone outside of the Ferguson family, Chris Atkins, a smattering of Northern Secondary high-school alumni, and a few Courtice, Ontario locals. That is, until now.\n\nThe Ferguson Super Sport: Its Construction\n\n“The absolute start of everything,” says Lesley Beres, “was this little wooden car, with little wooden wheels.” Beres, the Fergusons’ only child, still has the 12-inch model, which her father gifted to her a few years ago. “It was originally just stark black,” she says, but right before he left it to her, he painted it green to match the full-size Super Sport, and added a tiny plastic windshield.\n\nLesley was born just as her parents were finishing the car, but some of her earliest memories are of the basement of the family’s home in Downsview, in Toronto’s north end, where her mother would dry clothes while dad toiled “off in the distance, machining things.” Her first “doll” was made from tuck-and-roll black leather—the Super Sport’s center console armrest, swaddled in a blanket. “Once it was installed in the car in the late ’60s, that’s where I sat, when we would drive out on the highway to visit friends,” she says.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe house was a whirlwind of oil and grease and polyester fibreglass. Dinners were delayed as Plexiglas pieces baked in the oven, baths put off as metal bits took on new finishes soaking in the tub. “We had no dining room because the table was used for parts,” she recalls of her teenage years. “We had parts under our bed.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBesides parts, the house was filled with stories of the car’s origins, from the half-dozen years she’d missed. From what she gathers, after a 10-year planning phase and the construction of tools like a massive homemade milling machine, her father began by scratch-building the frame, inspired by sports cars he’d owned – an MG, a Jaguar, a Jowett Jupiter – as well as blueprints of high-end race cars, blended with his own unique chassis and suspension ideas. Around the same time, he started on the wooden buck for the fibreglass body, and then the body itself.\n\nThe styling was a team effort between Ross and Blanche. “I would say, Well, I think there should be more of a curve, here,” says Blanche. “And he would look at it and think, and we’d talk about it.” Over time, Blanche’s role became more hands-on, literally. Ross “started fiberglassing in the garage, and he developed a sensitivity where he couldn’t work with the chemicals,” says Lesley.\n\nBlanche recalls stepping in to help finish the bodywork. “He would stand in the driveway, and instruct me what to do,” she says, thinking back to one particularly hot July. “The sweat was dripping off my forehead.” The red fingernail polish she wore to the Orenda offices by day would chip and crack while she helped build the Super Sport at night. “My dad needed an assistant,” says Lesley. “And that assistant was my mother.”\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nRoss was a perfectionist, and it shows in the Ferguson Super Sport’s flawless fibreglass. Richard Beres, Lesley’s husband, and an engineer by trade, says Ross told him that he and Blanche managed the smooth, seamless bodywork by taking on the task in smaller-than-typical sections. “He would mix his epoxy resin in little Dixie cups, one or two ounces at a time, and literally do a four-inch-square piece, get it perfect, then mix up another batch,” Richard explains. Ross applied the car’s green isocyanate paint himself.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe Super Sport doesn’t wear bumpers or door handles, and that’s not by accident. “He liked simple, streamlined [styling]—no accoutrements, no unnecessary gunk,” Lesley quotes her father. “Bumpers, to him, were not necessary. ‘What the hell do you need a bumper for?’”\n\nAfter the bodywork came the actually-necessary bits. The windshield is a Vauxhall rear window flipped around, relays Chris Atkins, but the bubble-style side screens are Plexiglas, heated up in the Fergusons’ oven and formed by Blanche standing on the molds. (The headlight covers, which carry the body lines through their length, were similarly molded.) Those side windows are manually fitted in place, then secured by a pair of knurled nuts. The fabric top is also hand-installed, but not easily, Atkins says.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nArticle content\n\nThe rims – originally body colour, and painted gold within the past 10 years – were based on a two-piece fibreglass template Ross designed himself, which was sent off to a foundry to be cast in magnesium. “It was all about using the best material for the job,” says Richard. “There were no compromises.” The 15-inch wheels are mounted via a knock-off-style hub like a period Le Mans racer, tightened using a socket made by Ross.\n\nThe black leather tuck-and-roll interior, trimmed with wood veneer panels, is all done by the Fergusons, as is the Jaguar-inspired steering wheel with its oversized “F” emblem. The “Ferguson Super Sport” emblems on the hood and decklid – with a maple leaf in the center; like the Arrow story itself, Orenda-Avro machinist Ross Ferguson was more than a little patriotic – were also homemade.\n\nLast on the list was the drivetrain. Ross’s own documentation suggests the modified transmission – a three-speed with an unsynchronized first – is derived from a Ford unit, but Chris Atkins and Richard haven’t verified what sort. It’s mounted to the differential in the rear, for a near-50-50 weight distribution to the roughly 1,800-pound car. The layout means the gearbox is turned 180 degrees from usual, and the shift pattern between the narrow gates is backwards.\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nArticle content\n\nThe V8 underhood is essentially a crate engine, though crate-engine programs didn’t exist per se in the mid-1960s. Ross ordered the Fairlane-spec K-code 289-cubic-inch Ford – a 271-hp unit with a four-barrel carburetor, date-coded May 1967 – from the manufacturer in the U.S., via a Canadian dealer. Or at least, he tried to. “The first two engines didn’t make it across the border—they were stolen, because these engines were so sought-after,” explains Lesley. Fed up with Ford’s failed deliveries, Ross eventually crossed into the States after work one evening to pick up the third V8 himself.\n\n“You give it gas and it goes, it just doesn’t hesitate whatsoever,” says Atkins of the small-block, which breathes through a set of ceramic-coated custom headers. The exhaust passes through hand-crafted side pipes, which Ross stuffed with milled stainless steel shavings. “He basically made his own glasspack-style mufflers,” says Richard. “He handmade almost every component.”\n\nThen one day in 1967, the eight-year-long project was complete, the Ferguson Super Sport, resplendent in its metallic green, sharing space in the driveway with Ross’ new 1967 Ford Mustang. It wouldn’t be long, however, before this rolling testament to one man’s ingenuity would be hidden away—a victim, ironically, to his tireless inventiveness.\n\nAdvertisement 9\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe Ferguson Super Sport: Its Desertion\n\n“You know, this car is becoming a curse to us.” Blanche Ferguson recalls the Super Sport turned the heads of everyone they passed, the first few years her husband Ross drove it around southern Ontario, and she quickly got fed up. “We couldn’t take it out anywhere—I mean, literally, we had no peace with the car,” she says. “Everybody was following us, wanting us to pull over so they could talk about it.”\n\nThe Fergusons moved east to Scarborough in 1969, to a house not far from the University of Toronto, with an attached garage and a large workshop out back. The family’s new neighbours were as taken in as everyone by the stunning roadster every time its V8 roared to life, leaving an imprint on them, and young Lesley. “I remember playing in the yard, I remember that car coming out of the garage,” she reminisces. “I remember the smell. I remember the noise. I remember the attention.”\n\nThe Super Sport ferried the Fergusons on visits to family; to Dairy Queen on warm summer nights; and on cruises with Ross’s Corvette-enthusiast friends. It was an absolute hit on the days Ross would drive it to Northern Secondary, where he taught machine shop to tenth-graders, parking the Super Sport in the faculty garage beneath the football field.\n\nAdvertisement 10\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWe couldn’t take it out anywhere—I mean, literally, we had no peace with the car. Everybody was following us, wanting us to pull over so they could talk about it.\n\nBlanche Ferguson\n\nOne of those tenth-graders was Peter Metaxas, then a budding car enthusiast who Ross sensed was interested in the Ferguson Super Sport. “One day he said, Would you like to come with me to the Toronto car show?” says Metaxas. Ross had entered the car in the 1969 Motorama, a hot-rod exhibition hosted by the Canadian Motor Club, and, besides his family, brought along Metaxas and another student. “We got to set it up, polish it, that kind of thing,” he recalls.\n\nThe Motor Club’s members went manic at the sight of the car. “They couldn’t believe it,” says Blanche. “We were both young, and we had created this car, and we were getting all kinds of praise and compliments.” Chris Atkins has inherited the hardware to back up those boasts—period Motorama trophies for “Best Engineered” car, “Best Ford-powered Vehicle,” and the overall first-place prize.\n\nRoss followed up the Toronto show with the London Auto Modifiers’ Autorama, in London, Ontario, that same year, again inviting Metaxas along; this time, his pupil rode shotgun. “We’re halfway to London, going along [Highway] 401 at about 65 mph [105 km/h], and I said, Mr. Ferguson, what’s this thing like at speed?” Metaxas says. “I don’t know,” came the reply, and, soon after, the remedy. “He downshifted and put his foot into it, and took it up to about 5,000 rpm—probably 115 miles an hour [185 km/h].”\n\nAdvertisement 11\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nArticle content\n\nAs in Toronto, the Ferguson was met with mania, mixed with literal disbelief. “I remember hot-rod-type guys looking it over, asking stuff like ‘Where’d you get the wheels?’” says Metaxas. “He’d say, Well, I built them, and they’d go ‘Yeah, sure…’” As in Toronto, Ferguson took home Best Engineered and first-place trophies. “There’s a picture of me in his arms when he was getting the biggest trophy, because I remember I wanted to be with him,” says Lesley.\n\nMetaxas believes an invitation to a Detroit show was extended in London along with the prizes—Ross turned it down. In fact, Ross would never attend another car show with the Super Sport. “He did the car, it won some things, that was it,” says Richard Beres, explaining what Ross got out of the roadster. “For him, it was the challenge of the build, the engineering, the calculations, machining parts. Ross wasn’t about the destination. It was the journey.”\n\nRoss continued to occasionally drive the Ferguson through the early 1970s, mostly to Northern Secondary or on short weekend jaunts. But by ’69, he’d resolved to take advantage of changes to Canadian aviation regulations and pursue the pilot’s licence that his use of eyeglasses had kept him from his entire life. By the mid-’70s, the workshop behind the Ferguson house was being used for its intended purpose when he’d bought the place—a space for Ross to build his own airplane.\n\nAdvertisement 12\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nArticle content\n\n“He’d always wanted to make planes,” says Lesley, “And it’s almost like [the Super Sport] got forgotten about, because my dad went to his newest toy.” He started with a Piel CP.605B Super Diamant, handbuilt from a set of blueprints but heavily modified by Ross from a tail-dragger into a tricycle-style landing-gear configuration.\n\nConstruction of the Piel consumed most of Ross’s waking hours. His routine was to come home from Northern, change into a T-shirt, make a coffee, then head into the workshop, coming back into the house only for family dinner and another coffee. “I never saw my dad, he was always in the garage,” she recalls. “He didn’t leave the property, yet I never really lived with him.”\n\nArticle content\n\nThe Super Sport was basically abandoned. “It would sit on blocks, and then it rusted out,” says Lesley. Maintenance on a one-off car isn’t easy, so a thousand little fixes piled up until after the Piel was finished in 1983. “He pulled it out of the garage, and after over a decade, it was a mess,” she recounts. “He had to strip the car down, the seats had to be redone, the [mechanicals] had to be overhauled.”\n\nThe restoration was but a brief reprieve for the Super Sport. In 1988, perhaps nostalgic for his work on the Avro Arrow’s turbojets at Orenda, Ross got the itch to engineer a warbird from scratch—a two-thirds-scale replica of a Second-World-War-era Supermarine Spitfire fighter plane, powered by a Buick-Rover automobile V8. That project is a story all its own, but suffice it to say the Super Sport was neglected yet again until the Spitfire saw its first flight in 2003, save for a second mild refurbishing in the late ‘90s. The one-time head-turner was becoming a dusty relic mired in myth.\n\nAdvertisement 13\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe Ferguson Super Sport: Its Resurrection\n\nArticle content\n\n“Didn’t somebody come from BMW?” Lesley prods her husband Richard. “I think they came to Northern Secondary, something to do with—” He interjects: “Yeah, back in the ’70s, an engineer from BMW paid Ross a visit about his brake design. But I can’t remember the exact details.” Two homebuilt planes and a few decades later, shaky stories had begun to surface about the seldom-seen Super Sport. (A customer of Chris Atkins’ who knew the Ferguson from new claims Chevrolet tweaked its Corvette’s taillights to avoid copycatting the Super Sport; a former student says Ford offered Ross a million bucks for the patent on the design. The little information about the car online was counterbalanced by misinformation.)\n\nAfter 2003, Ross would occasionally drive the car to local EAA (Experimental Aircraft Association) meets, but the Super Sport was secondary, now, to the Spitfire. He and Blanche moved to Courtice, near Oshawa, Ontario, when that plane was finished, and he decided to give the sports car one more going-over, between 2015 and 2018. “Ross pulled the body off again, did some mechanical work, the body got totally repainted,” says Richard. Less than two years later, in November 2019, Ross Ferguson passed away, just shy of his 91st birthday.\n\nAdvertisement 14\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIt wasn’t long after that Chris Atkins, an exotic-car enthusiast and owner of the Atkins Automotive repair shop in nearby Bowmanville, heard from a friend about a distinctive green roadster. “He’s like ‘My neighbor’s got a pretty cool little car. I’m not sure what it is, but she’s looking to get rid of it,’” says Atkins. He was told it was a homebuilt, and so figured it for a kit car, but decided to inspect it anyway.\n\n“When I first walked into the garage and saw the car, I just couldn’t believe the body lines,” he says. “I’d never seen anything like it before.” Atkins had recently sold off a handful of his Lotus Esprits to pay for a Ferrari F355 acquired from a customer, but was completely taken by the Super Sport and had to add it to his garage. He bought the car from Blanche Ferguson in 2020, with 14,000 miles on the odometer.\n\nArticle content\n\n“There’s no other man on this planet that could have come across that car and bought it,” says Lesley. “He was the perfect person to purchase that car, because not only do I believe he has a personal love for it, but he’s got the knowledge to think how my dad might think, and can fix this car when repairs need to be done.”\n\nThe sale included binders of schematics and diagrams, as well as some of Ross’s homebuilt tools, and the molds for pieces like the Super Sport’s rims and headlight covers. He dreads ever having to use them—despite Lesley’s confidence, the experienced mechanic is slightly intimidated by the uniqueness of the car and its parts.\n\nAdvertisement 15\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nArticle content\n\nMinor maintenance lies ahead for the Super Sport, but for now Atkins is concentrating on showing off the obscure sports car – it was the hit of the Autofest in Oshawa in 2022 and 2023, and will be shown at the 2023 Cobble Beach Concours d’Elegance – as well as correcting the myths and misinformation that matured during its decades of dormancy.\n\nThe car’s renaissance echoes its first years—turning heads wherever it goes, collecting trophies, confounding slack-jawed gawkers. “At shows, when I explain that everything was handbuilt except for the engine, a lot of people can’t conceive somebody can do that, right from beginning to the end, in their garage,” says Atkins. Not just somebody, of course—remember we’re talking about a machinist who wrenched on the CF-105 Avro Arrow’s Iroquois turbojets, here.\n\nLike Ross and Blanche in ’67, Atkins finds himself overwhelmed with attention and cursed by question-askers whenever and wherever he drives the Ferguson Super Sport. Fortunately, it’s a curse he’s elated to bear.\n\nMore in Classic Cars & Trucks\n\nWhat was the 1980s' worst year for cars?\n\nThis San Fran art university owns 150 rare classic cars—here’s why it’s selling them off\n\nWedge Play: Why the door-stop design trend was spotlighted at the 2024 Pebble Beach Concours\n\nPorsche drops Canada-exclusive 50th Anniversary 911 Turbo sneaker\n\nLEGO turns out 2024 supercar kits of Lambo Countach, McLaren P1\n\nSee more\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nNicholas Maronese\n\nNicholas has been part of the Driving.ca team since 2018, and writes specifically about classic cars – like his first and currently only car, his 1971 Plymouth Valiant Scamp – whenever possible, though he also enjoys exploring vehicular history, automotive design, and car culture.
