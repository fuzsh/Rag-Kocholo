        "text": "In Dec.2009 Neville sent another batch of photos to add on this webpage.\n\nTo start with: deHavilland DHC-3 otter CF-QOS (c/n 398) of Gander Aviation. Neville thought he'd taken this photo in 1973, at St.John's.\n\nThe authority on the DHC-3 Otter is Karl E. Hayes, who published a monograph on this 'Skytruck of the Bush'. I quote from his work (abbreviated):\n\nDHC-3 Otter c/n 398 was delivered to the RCAF on 31Oct1960 with serial 9418. It was allocated to 418 Squadron, Namao. It sustained 'B' category damage on 14Sep1961 in the course of a training flight. On landing back at base at Namao, the student levelled off too high and stalled in. The heavy landing badly damaged the landing gear.\n\nThe Otter was trucked to the Canadian Pacific Airlines depot at Lincoln Park, Calgary for repair, where it arrived on 29Sep1961. After repair it was re-issued to 418 Squadron, Namao on 11Jan62. During 1963 it was involved in two SAR missions, in February '63 for Howard DGA N58856 and in September '63 for Cessna 175 CF-LBF. On both of these missions it 501 flew alongside 418 Squadron Otter 9417 (396). It continued flying for 418 Squadron until it met with another 'B' category crash on the airbase at Namao on 15Oct67.\n\nThat accident ended its RCAF career, during which it had flown 2,127 hours.\n\nThe damaged Otter was put into storage at Namao and in Sep68 was moved to the Mountain View depot in Ontario and put up for disposal, in its damaged condition, through the Crown Assets Disposal Corporation.\n\nIt was one of three damaged Otters sold on 08Feb71 to Gander Aviation Ltd of Gander, Newfoundland.\n\nThe 3 aircraft were trucked from Mountain View to Weston Aircraft Ltd, Oshawa, Ontario where they were rebuilt for Gander Aviation. On 13May71, as the rebuilds were in progress, marks were allocated for the three Otters, CF-QOQ (46) ex 3685, CF-QOR (375) ex 9409 and CF-QOS (398) ex 9418. Two of the aircraft, QOQ and QOR, were sold on but QOS was registered to Gander Aviation Ltd in June 1971, intended for operation by the company.\n\nOn 03Jul71 William Bennett, the owner of Gander Aviation, performed a test flight at Oshawa in QOS, and on 06Jul71 he flew the Otter to Carp, Ontario where Bristol amphibious floats were fitted. On 08Jul71 he set off on the Otter's delivery flight, routing that day from Carp to Fredericton, New Brunswick and the following day via Charlottetown to Gander, CF-QOS then entered service with Gander Aviation Ltd.\n\nThe Otter was used for general charter work around both the island of Newfoundland and in mainland Labrador. It also supported outpost fishing camps in Labrador, at Michael River and Sand Hill River. It was used to fly freight and personnel to Baie d'Espoire, Newfoundland where a power station was being built. Another task was to bring patients in from outlying nursing stations to St.Johns. It was on such a flight that QOS crashed on landing at St.Johns on 11Jan72.\n\nThe Otter was flying under charter to the Department of Health. There were seven souls on board, including two pilots and a medical attendant. Two stretcher patients had been picked up at Burgeo, and two more at Harbour Breton. The Otter landed 300 feet short of runway 29 at the St.Johns IAP, shortly after 5pm that afternoon. The accident report cited as a factor the pilot's lack of familiarity with the aircraft. The Otter came down on rough gravel and was badly damaged, although no one was injured. The ambulances which had been waiting at the airport for the arriving patients drove to the scene and were able to take the patients to hospital.\n\nThe Otter was shipped to Montreal for repair, after which it returned to Gander and continued in service with Gander Aviation until August 1974. It had flown 1,304 hours while in service with Gander Aviation.\n\nIt then went to the mainland for structural modifications before being sold to Direquair Inc of Chibougamau, Quebec in 1975, registered C-FQOS. It was based at Lac Cache and served alongside the company's other two Otters C-FDIO (452) and C-FAPQ (201). There was a change of name to Air Mistassini Inc in 1981. The following year, Air Mistassini went bankrupt and the Otters were lying at Lac Cache for a time. QOS was sold to Air Melancon Inc of St.Anne du Lac, Quebec to whom it was registered in August 1983. It was to fly for Air Melancon for many years and in 1992 was converted to a Vazar turbo Otter.\n\nC-FQOS continued in service with Air Melancon until June 1998, when it was sold to Labrador Airways Ltd, trading as Air Labrador and moved to its new base at Goose Bay. The owners of Air Labrador had an associated company called Tamalik Air, used primarily to support hunting and fishing camps, and QOS was assigned to Tamalik Air and painted in its striking red overall colour scheme. When not flying for Tamalik Air, it flew as part of the Air Labrador fleet. For example, during April 2001 it was heavily tasked flying fuel in barrels and groceries from Goose Bay to Border 502 Beacon as the native Innu were moving there from Davis Inlet.\n\nQOS continued flying for Air Labrador/Tamalik Air until an accident on 12Sep2001, which occurred as the Otter was taking off from Otter Creek at Goose Bay en route to a fishing lodge. The pilot reported he was in climb mode when the aircraft pitched forward and then nosed up before entering an uncontrollable nose-down descent, although it did not exhibit characteristics normally associated with an aerodynamic stall. It impacted the water hard, resulting in structural failure of the float supports and extensive damage to the fuselage. Lab Air 911, a Twin Otter medevac flight bound for Nain witnessed the incident and raised the alarm. The pilot and three passengers were rescued by boat, but QOS sank in 55 feet of water. It was raised up, and the wreck sold to aircraft dealer Glen W.Ernst of Temecula, California.\n\nThe Otter somewhat disappeared from view until July 2007 when during a visit to the Kenai Airport in Alaska it was noted in a hangar there under rebuild.\n\nBy Jan.2010 I could find no reference that the rebuild had been completed or for whom.\n\nOn above images Neville wrote:\n\n\"Seen at Gander: NORDAIR's Lockheed Electra L-188CF assigned to a Canadian Government contract, the socalled ICE PATROL assignment.\n\nHere is a useful link: http://www.al-airliners.be/k-o/nordair/nordair.htm, which also include the following reevant information:\n\n'...... DC-4 aircraft were replaced in 1972 by two Lockheed Electra (L-188C) aircraft, CF-NAY and CF-NAZ (renamed CF-NDZ following an accident in 1977). The Electra aircraft were owned and operated by Nordair Limited of Montreal.'\n\nI don't know the registration number of this L.188 Electra.\"\n\nSteve Woolfrey followed this up (Nov.2010) with the following update and recommended links for further research:\n\n\"CF-NAZ was re-registered as C-GNDZ in 1978 when rebuilt following severe damage sustained in an incident with CAF 10737, Argus - Mar 31 '77.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/4gkrx45\n\nThis is a story reprinted in Charlottetown Guardian:\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.pe.ca/Living/World/2007-03-31/article-1374354/Vivid-memories-remain-of-fiery-Argus-crash-of-1977/1\n\nThis is a link to a Summerside newspaper image of the Electra - after:\n\nhttp://media.photobucket.com/image/argus%20summerside/iceobs/ElectraAccident.jpg?o=1 \"\n\nShows a slightly larger version of this image:\n\nI include this pic for in Feb.2014 I received following challenging email from Ken Pickford, who wrote:\n\n\"In connection with the Nordair Lockheed L-188 photos and related information, I question the accuracy of the following statement:\n\n\"...CF-NAZ (renamed CF-NDZ following an accident in 1977).\" (Neville Webb)\n\n\"All information I can find indicates that CF-NAZ was written off after the accident. I can find nothing to indicate that it was rebuilt and re-registered. And if you look at the photo of the damaged L-188 from a newspaper report of the accident, it is hard to believe that aircraft would have (or could have) been repaired.\" -Ken Pickford\n\nSince the newspaper photo supports Ken's statement that it was unlikely that this wreck was rebuilt I investigated further.\n\nTo start: details of the accident are to be found on the aviation-safety.net/database/ : 'CF-NAZ 31mar77 A landing Canadian Armed Forces Canadair CP-107 Argus (serial 10737, c/n 28), crashed into the Electra. All three crewmembers aboard the Argus were killed.'\n\nAn online database also confirmed CF-NAZ c/n 1132 written off after this accident: rzjets.net/aircraft/?typeid=149\n\nThat same database offers the history of L.188 c/n 1111:\n\nhttp://rzjets.net/aircraft/?typeid=149\n\nAs N128US del'd 12Oct59 – nov71 Northwest AL, lsd Jul72-Jul74 Air Holiday N128US, lsd Air Florida N25AF\n\nC-GNDZ regd Feb78 Nordair Canada, [enter period with 'Ice Reconnaissance' -Webmaster]\n\nmerged jan87 CP Air, merged apr87 Canadian Airlines Intl, to\n\n9Q-CRY apr92 for New ACS, w/o aug92 dbr. NOTE: no note of repair or rebuilding!\n\nThen I found the details on ATDB.Aero database (www.aerotransport.org):\n\nCF-NAZ: Destroyed 31/03/77 at YSU (hit by RCAF CL-28 10737, wreck used to rebuild C-GNDZ c/n 1111).\n\nAnd on C-GNDZ c/n 1111: Nordair ex Air Florida –rebuilt by AJI with front fuselage from CF-NAZ c/n 1132, opf Canadian Dept of Environment/Ice Reconnaissance.\n\nThen I asked myself why? Why was the front fuselage required for rebuilding C-GNDZ, surely it was CF-NAZ that was damaged?! Perhaps the term 'rebuilding' contributes to the confusion, perhaps 'modifications' should be used (as well). The answer can be found here:\n\nHistory of Ice Reconnaissance:\n\n\"The DC-4 aircraft were replaced in 1972 by two Lockheed Electra (L-188C) aircraft, CF-NAY and CF-NAZ (renamed C-GNDZ following an accident in 1977). The Electra aircraft were owned and operated by Nordair Limited of Montreal.\n\nThe first Side-Looking Airborne Radar (SLAR) used for ice reconnaissance was installed on C-GNDZ in 1978.\"\n\nI (Neville) researched and wrote the following [below] about the B-26 wreck in Labrador...\n\nI knew about this wreck years ago but never fully realised its very remote location and the follow-on tragic story following the crash event in December 1942.\n\nWas most fortunate recently to find the Link for Mission Saglek 2017 that includes flight and wreck photos.\n\nThe Diary of One Now Dead. I (Neville) knew the author Tom Drodge, of Shoal Harbour NFL, when we communicated about the B-36 wreck [Under The Radar] and had previously re-read his book about the B-26 crash.\n\nWhat I have written below has brought together relevant Sources and Links that tell this harrowing Martin B-26crash story together with a brief outline and diary by the crew after the crash until their untimely death.\n\nMartin Marauder B-26 41-17862 crash site at Saglek, Labrador\n\n2009\n\nMartin Marauder B-26 41-17862 crash site, 2009\n\nStory of Martin Marauder B-26 Times a Wastin'. The crash of USAAF B-26 at Saglek, Labrador 10Dec1942\n\nOn a ferry flight from Greenland [BW-1] to Goose Bay, Labrador, the B-26 became lost in bad weather without radio communication and through faulty navigation.\n\nBelieving the B-26 was south of Goose Bay the aircraft flew northwards along the Labrador coast before making a crash landing before its fuel ran out, close by Saglek fjord and in fact approximately 18 miles from the village of Hebron.\n\nThe links below tell the tragic story of the crew's will to survive in a remote and inhospitable region of Labrador, though in the end all the crew perished...\n\nThree crew members attempted to go for help using a boat [life-raft] but were never heard from again!\n\nInuit hunters from Hebron noticed a dark object on the hillside in the Fall of 1942...\n\nHowever, it was not until the late Spring of 1943 that hunters came across the wreck. Behind a tarpaulin over a wing they found the bodies of the remaining four crew.\n\nAlso found later was the diary kept by First Lt. Hodges, the last entry made on 3rd February 1943.\n\nToday little of the wreck remains.\n\nYears ago the fuselage, engines and tail fin were removed. Also, when the nearby runway for the Saglek Pine Tree Radar site was built the wreckage was moved aside onto the nearby rocks.\n\nSaglek Airport Runway:\n\nwww.google.ca/maps/@58.4719179,-62.6488556,268m/\n\nSources and Credits:\n\nMission Saglek 2017 includes pictures by Patrick Vergobbi, Pierre Nadon and others, August 2017 flight from\n\nQuebec to Saglek and the B-24 wreck site.\n\n[a] Flight Safety - Aviation History: asn.flightsafety.org/wikibase/\n\nUnited States Army Air Force (USAAF) Matin Marauder B-26 Times a Wastin’.\n\nRegistration: 41-17862 Saglek, Labrador, 10th December 1942\n\n[b] Mission Saglek 2017 Google Translate; including photos of flight journey and wreck:\n\nPhoto Credits: Pilotes Quebec Forum – (text translated thru Google Translate)\n\nBy: Patrick Vergobbi, Pierre Nadon and others, August 2017 www.pilotes.quebec/forum/viewtopic.php (in French)\n\n[c] Breakwater Books, 2018: The Diary of One Now Dead by Tom Drodge:\n\nPilot's Diary: www.c-and-e-museum.org/Pinetreeline/ - / - /other34bj - a moving story, all survived the crash but perished afterwards in the winter weather of neovember and december 1942.\n\n[d] Saltscapes: North Warning System:\n\nSaglek: Pine Tree Waring Line: www.saltscapes.com/ - /894-on-the-radar"
