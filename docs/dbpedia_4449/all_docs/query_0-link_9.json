        "text": "Richard Nash sent three images from his wonderful collection\n\nDouglas DC-6A PH-TGA 'Dr. Ir. M.H. Damme' at Southend.\n\nSince PH-TGA was registered 17Jul53 and rereg'd PH-DFA 19Feb1954, this is the time span this photo was taken.\n\nUPDATE: In Dec.2015 Andy Dickson wrote: \"I think the photo of PH-TGA at Southend may actually be at Prestwick, and the ‘cargo’ being off-loaded is Roy Rogers and Trigger, who arrived there on 14th Feb 1954 at the start of their UK tour.\" http://tinyurl.com/pzobjhj - Google / Glasgow Herald Feb 15, 1954 (page 8/12).\n\nFollowing information was from the website www.edcoatescollection.com: \"In 1953 KLM purchased two purpose built DC-6A freighter aircraft. KLM's cargo operations had started to take off in a big way and they needed these dedicated freighters.\n\nMany DC-6As were built as \"windowless wonders\" but KLM's both (the other was PH-TGB) had windows, making them more or less convertible to passenger aircraft should the need arise. Both were sold off in 1960, PH-TGA going to Nevead Aero Trades (who leased them out to a number of carriers) as N6574C.\"\n\nFrom my onw records I found this was actually the first DC-6A delivered outside the USA.\n\nC/n 44076 has the following remarks in my database:\n\nDlvd to KLM 18Jul53, rereg'd PH-DFA 1954. Sold May 1960 to Trans Alaskan Airlines and reg'd N6574C; remod to pax DC-6B in 1955. Operated by Great Lakes Airlines,Trans Alaskan again, to Admiral Airways.\n\nJune 1964 to Zantop (changed its name to Universal Airlines in 1966). 1967 Boreas Corp.\n\nBought by Span East Airlines and reg'd N611SE in Jan. 1970. In 1971 to Quanama West Indies; that same year to Alcon (Bolivia) and reg'd CP-947.\n\nIt was damaged on landing at San Juan (Bolivia) and was declared 'damaged beyond economic repairs', written off.\n\n'Handle with care' is written all over this bicycle. A DC-3 from the days when 'KLM Royal Dutch' was\n\nmerely 'the Flying Dutchman'!\n\nA Bristol Freighter being loaded at Southend; no further details available.\n\nNicolas Cox wrote me (sep.2015) that this is Bristol 170 Superfreighter Mk32 G-AOUU 'Venture',\n\nin operation with Channel Air Bridge (Feb 59 to Jan 63).\n\nAnd here a Bristol Freighter being loaded, or unloaded, during nighttime (no further details):\n\nThat ACL insignia may have some bearing on ACL Aviation Support, which was a handling company at Southend Airport. Comments welcomed (EMAIL, pls provide url in correspondence).\n\nAnd again Nicolas Cox to the rescue: \"this is actually an Air Charter Ltd Bristol 170 Freighter 31E,\n\nof which they had two: G-AMLP and G-AMSA. Both were later converted by Aviation Traders to the\n\nlong nosed Mk32 standard in (I believe) Jan and May 1958\".\n\nAnd here is another image of the Bristol Freighter; (un)loading is still very much a manual matter!\n\nAlso from the Richard Nash Collection, a Douglas C-54A being loaded with cargo.\n\nRichard Nash shared this photo with in 2012: G-APEP is seen at the Brooklands Museum (no date).\n\nG-APEP was built as Vickers Vanguard 953C (c/n 719). G-APEP flew with BEA, then British Airways, then to Air Bridge Carriers (ABC), which changed into Air Bridge and later to Hunting Air Cargo (1992 - 1998).\n\nThe Vickers Vanguard was a British short/medium-range turboprop airliner introduced in 1959 by Vickers-Armstrongs, a development of their successful Viscount design with considerably more internal room.\n\nThe Vanguard was introduced just before the first of the large jet-powered airliners, and was largely ignored by the market.\n\nOnly 44 were built, ordered by Trans-Canada Air Lines (TCA) and British European Airways (BEA).\n\nAfter only about 10 years service TCA experimentally converted one of theirs to a freighter configuration, calling it the Cargoliner. This was considered successful, and in the early 1970s most were converted to freighters, those from BEA becoming the Merchantman.\n\nThese freighters remained in service for many years, with the last one (G-APEP) only retiring in 1996.\n\n[Wikipedia, more..]\n\nAlso by Richard Nash is F-BASN, a Breguet 763 Provence, operated by Air France.\n\nNote in the background 2 Curtiss C-46s of Capitol Airways/Lufthansa.\n\nBreguet 763 Provence F-BASN had c/n 1. It was scrapped at Dakar at some point.\n\nThe Breguet 761/763/765 were a family of 1940s and 1950s French double-deck transport aircraft produced by Breguet. The aircraft were normally called the Deux-Ponts (Double-Decker) but it was not an official name.\n\nBreguet began design work on the Breguet 761 two-deck airliner even before the end of the WWII, in 1944.\n\nThe French Government ordered 12 production aircraft, the Breguet 76-3 which were later redesignated Br.763.\n\nSix aircraft were to be operated by Air France and the other six by the Ministry of Transport.\n\nThe 763 had more powerful engines, an 1.20 metres (3 ft 11 in) larger wingspan, strengthened wings and three-crew flight deck (earlier aircraft had four crew).\n\nThe 763 first flew on 20 July 1951 and entered service with Air France during autumn 1952.\n\nDuring 1964 Air France transferred six Br.763s to the French Air Force. The air force also acquired the three pre-production Br.761S aircraft and four new Br.765 Sahara freighter aircraft with removable cargo doors.\n\nProjects to build versions powered with British engines (for possible United Kingdom buyers) did not come to fruition. The projects would have been the 766 (with the Bristol Hercules radial engine), and the 767 with British turboprop engines.\n\nThe prototype Br.761 entered service with Air Algérie in 1952 as a cargo aircraft. It was withdrawn early the next year.\n\nSilver City Airways leased a Br.761 for three months in the summer of 1953 for use on the Hamburg - Berlin route. It was rumoured that Silver City Aws would purchase 3 aircraft, but this did not materialise into a sale.\n\nThe Breguet Br.763 Provence entered service with Air France on 10 March 1953. The inaugural route was Lyon - Algiers. The type was used on European routes from Paris, mainly to the Mediterranean area, but occasionally to London.\n\n[Wikipedia, more..]\n\nRichard Nash sent these images from his collection, taken at London-Gatwick.\n\nWikipedia has this on SA de Transport Aérien:\n\n'SA de Transport Aérien (SATA) or SA de Transport Aerien Genève, was a Swiss airline founded in June 1966, with its head office on the property of Geneva Airport,[1] and with its base in Geneva. It finished its activities in 1978. It started as an air-taxi operator and evolved to passenger and cargo charters to points in Europe, the USA, South America and the Caribbean.\n\nSATA had two major incidents with its aircraft. On July 17, 1973, while landing at Tromsø/Langnes Airport in Norway, a Convair CV-640 landed heavily, bounced, and landed back nose-down, resting 15m short of the runway end. On December 18, 1977, SA de Transport Aérien Flight 730 a Sud Aviation SE-210 Caravelle 10R crashed into the sea while on final approach to Funchal Airport in Portugal, killing 36.'\n\nLINK\n\nWikipedia however fails to mention SATA operated the Convair propliner. For this I found details on ATDB.aero\n\nwhich included the CV640 HB-IMM (c/n 412) - which must be the one depicted above.\n\nATDB also included in the fleetlist Vickers Viscounts HB-ILR and HB-ILP.\n\nAnother one taken at Gatwick, Aer Turas (a 'Freightdog' from Dublin, Ireland which was founded in 1962 and acquired by Aer Lingus in 1980) Douglas DC-7.\n\nI thought I could make out 'EI-AYY' in the photo, but according to ATDB.aero this can not be correct; the likeliest choice would be EI-ATV: DC-7C/F (c/n 45188), ex/ KLM PH-DSI (ended with Compagnie Gabonaise d'Affrêtements Aériens as TR‑LNZ, was scrapped at some point).\n\nAnother batch from the Richard Nash collection, uploaded in Sep.2015 and added the various informatio as much as I could from internet sources and own archives.\n\nU.S. Army DHC-2 Beavers, serial 82000 (58-2000) and 6405 (56-405).\n\nJoe Baugher's magnificent website states L-20A 58-2000 (msn 1326/1880) was delivered 07Apr1959.\n\nAnd for 56-405 we find '(msn 1149/1729) delivered 27Sep1957; to N6475, N354, N93E. More on DHC-2.com\n\nThe deHavilland L-20 Beaver entered the Korean War late, but proved to be a superb liaison aircraft and also served later in Vietnam. In 1962 the L-20 was designated the U-6. The U-6A 'Beaver' was manufactured by deHavilland Aircraft of Canada, Ltd. Nearly 1.700 DHC-2 Beavers were built by DeHavilland Canada, between 1947 and 1967; of those, about 970 went to the US Army and the US Air Force as U-6As. More than 200 L-20As went into USAF inventory between 1952 and 1960 to be flown in utility transportation and liaison roles.\n\nSource: www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/u-6.htm\n\nDouglas C-54 EC-BMI (c/n 10440), operated by Spantax SA. No details on where or when this photo was taken.\n\nAnother 'propliner' operating for Spantax S.A.: Douglas DC-6 OO-SDC (c/n 43064).\n\nThis tailnumber was also assigned, much later, to a Boeing 737. But this 'Six' started with SABENA (OO-AWC)\n\nin 1947, was reregistered OO-SDC, than became OD-ACY for Lebanese Int'l Airways, returned to Belgium for\n\nSobel air (OO-SDC, leased from SABENA), the lease changed to BIAS (still OO-SDC) and to Air Zaire (same).\n\nFrom there it went to Spantax and this must have been an early picture as it was registered in Spain as EC-AZX.\n\nIt was also operated by Ibera (EC-AZX, leased from Spantax, sold 1965). Then it turned an exotic page of its\n\ncareer, being reg'd as TI-A414B, the sole plane for operator Wiggins Int'l (a company I was unable to find\n\ndetails of). TI- is the country prefix for Costa Rica. Could be 'iffy', because afterwards it was reg'd N5594R\n\nfor one Gerald O'Brien Watkins, then as such to Atlas Aircraft Corporation and has been booked:\n\n'Ultimate fate unknown'... Many of these propliners saw use for smugglings drugs and vanished over sea or in the jungle.\n\nConvair CV440 Metropolitan HB-IMB (327) of Swissair.\n\nC/n 327 was purchased new from Convair and after Swissair it continued its career with the Luftwaffe (CA+034,\n\n12+02) from where it went to Air Serbia and Transadria (YU-ADU). As N47098 it operated for New Jersey AL.\n\nFrom there it went to Aerorepública (XA-HEK); it was destroyed 20may1981 in Mexico, while operating for Aero\n\nLéon; The aircraft crashed into a mountain (Mt.Pinarete) at 8867 feet, 3 crew and 21 passengers perished (ASN)\n\nDouglas DC-7 D-ABAS of Sudflug. C/n 45548 was first operated by KLM (PH-DSP) and after Südflug went to\n\nBiafra Airlines (5T-TAL), it survived the famous Biafra Airlift and became registered as VR-BCZ for ARCO\n\nBermuda (pic on Airliners.net), but did not see any use as such and was scrapped in 1970 at Basle / Mulhouse, France.\n\nI have a great book on the Biafra Airlift: 'Shadows: Airlift and Airwar in Biafra and Nigeria 1967-1970'. But while googling 5T-TAL I came across another one, 'Far Away in the Sky, a memoir of the Biafran Airlift' by David\n\nL. Koren - maybe worth to look for it one day. The infamous Frank Wharton (an American of Latvian descent) had ownership of Tango Alpha Lima at some point.\n\nHank Wharton makes up for some interesting reading!\n\nLike here on www.mercenary-wars.net/biafra/jim-townsend.html\n\nHis real name was Heinrich Wartski and he was born in Germany in 1916. He came to the USA in 1937.\n\nWharton (or Warton) operated under several diffent company names, e.g. North American Aircraft Trading Co (a.k.a. 'Biafra Airways', with all 5T- registrations being fake!) and ARCO Bermuda in 1969-71. That last one was based at Sao Tomé, Basle and Stockholm.\n\nMike Zoeller did an excellent write up on www.oldjets.net/good-guys-went-bad.html\n\nN37544 is a bit of a mystery; it would have been nice to know where this was taken and when!\n\nDouglas DC-6 c/n 43145 was delivered to United Airlines in 1950; it continued its career as N903MA for\n\nPacific American, but it seems to have disappeared, its ultimate fate unknown!\n\nColin McKeeman made me aware that the same (!) image can be found on the internet, and it has the caption \" \"N37544 - Douglas DC-6 B at Oakland Airport in 1968\".\n\nColin wrote me in April 2016:\n\n\"Sorry, but has been some time since we were in touch but life just seems so busy! Just finished writing the history of the old UK based Birdlip HF communications station, which I hope will go to print next month.\n\nRay Flynn, a long standing friend of mine, just passed me the undernoted, which has some great shots!\n\nI was particularly looking at the shot of DC-6 N37544 and based on this link http://aflyinghistory.com/search-aeroplane-photographs?query=us&page=78 I think it was taken at Oakland in 1968?\n\nLike you I can't find any history post this year except that it is quoted as being scrapped, but where (Oakland?)/when?\n\nHope this helps and great to see you still posting excellent material.\n\nColin\n\nDublin, IRL - www.flickr.com/photos/banterops)\n\nCurtiss C-46A N155Z (c/n 26433) - US Forest Service. No where and when specified.\n\nThis Curtiss Commando started its career with the USAAF (41-12306), found civil career, first as N155Z\n\noperated by the US Forest Service, from where it became CP-992 operated by Aerominas; it was 'damaged\n\nbeyond repairs' at Trinidad, Bolivia (details of the crash unspecified: ASN).\n\nIn april 2016 I added these images sent by Richard Nash (again, not clear whether these were taken by him or from the collection of Bill Hill he was allowed to scan; little info on where & when).\n\nThrough the fence: Lockheed L.1049G Constellation F-BGNI (c/n 4518) of Air France, ready to load cargo.\n\nFrom Air France it went to Air Cameroun (also F-BGNI); it was scrapped at Nîmes/Arles, Camargue/Garons airport.\n\nLockheed L.749A Constellation F-BBDT (c/n 2675) of Air France awaiting its passengers at London-Heathrow (LHR).\n\nIt went to Royal Air Maroc (CN-CCN), where (after use as a ground trainer) it was preserved (until today 2016,afaik)\n\nLockheed L.749A Constellation G-ASYF (c/n 2630) of Ace Scotland.\n\nACE Freighters existed in the UK during 1962-1966 (Aviation Charter Enterprises). In the USA during\n\n1972-1974 but they did not operate Lockheed Constellations, only one DC-3 (N18255, c/n 4583).\n\nBefore being reg'd G-ASYF for ACE Freighters it was ZS-DBS with SAA and Flitestar (leased from SAA).\n\nAfter ACE it was reg'd N1939 for COPISA, for spares supply; scrapped after such use was no longer needed.\n\nCOPISA stands for Compañia Peruana Internacional de Aviación SA (1964-1971). Info from ATDB.aero\n\nLockheed L.749 Constellation LV-IGS (c/n 2540) of Aerotransportes Entre Rios (AER)\n\nThis Connie was first delivered to KLM (PH-TEP, rr PH-LDR), acquired by SALA in Costa Rica as TI-1044P,\n\nwas registered LV-PZX for AER and subsequently rereg'd LV- IGS both for AER. Scrapped at Montevideo.\n\nLockheed Super Constellation (N-number?) of Aer Lingus, which had several Super Constellations in use at some\n\npoint: L.1049E N1005C (c/n 4557), L.1049G N611C (c/n 4602) and L.1049H N1008C (c/n 4806) and\n\nN1009C (c/n N4807). My money is on N1009C...\n\nLockheed Constellation of Air Nevada. I can only make out an 'H' as last digit of the N-number.\n\nAir Nevada was around in 1974 (based Lake Tahoe), 1964-1969 (in California) and as Air Nevada Airlines\n\nin 1975. When based at Santa Monica,CA it operated Lockheed L.049 Constellation N9412H (c/n 2072) plus\n\na selection of Douglas DC-3 (N33639 c/n 4085; N61350 c/n 4535; N15570 c/n 6320). (Credit ATDB.aero)\n\nLockheed L.1649A Starliner N179AV (c/n 1040) of Air Venturers (Houston,TX 1965-1970).\n\nThis is former D-ALAN of Lufthansa; it went on to become N45512 for World Airways and Air Venturers,\n\nwas rereg'd N974R for TMA (leased from Air Venturers), leased to CJS Aircargo, West-Air and Burns Aviation,\n\nto T C Campbell and Proimex (leased from Burns Avtn), to Aeroborne Enterprises and finally to Maine Coast\n\nAirways for preservation by Maurice Roundy. It ended up at Fantasy of Flight in Florida, where it was\n\nrepainted in basic Lufthansa livery in 2000. Read about Lufthansa's Starliner restoration project HERE...\n\nMike McHugh (Canberra,AUS)commented on this photo:\"I think the Starliner N179AV was taken at Heathrow, probably by Brian Stanier. If so it would have been February 1967.\n\nGreat pictures! Brbought back lots of memories, particularly those at the London area airports.\n\nSome of the photos at Heathrow look like the photographer was standing next to me, because I have some almost identical pictures, until you check the aircraft in the background.\"\n\nSuper L.1049G Constellation VT-DJX (c/n 4687) of Air India.\n\nAfter civil airliner use it went to (Indian Air Force as BG579), where anno 2016 it may still survive in poor condition.\n\nLockheed L.1049H Super Constellation N6937C (c/n 4830) of Airlift International.\n\nN6937C had a long list of operators: Slick Airways, Airlift Int'l, Balboa Air, Cargo Transport Leasing, Air\n\nTraders Int'l, Sky Truck Int'l, Globe Air, Save-a-Connie / Airline History Museum, where it awaits restoration\n\nin TWA c/s. During its career it had been leased by TWA and South American Continental.\n\nDouglas DC-4 of Air France\n\nDouglas C-54 9Q-CBG (c/n 10452) of Air Congo.\n\nThis image of 9Q-CBG has no signs of its 'Swingtail'-conversion, so it must be taken before end-1966.\n\nCourtesy of ATDB.aero I have its history as USAF 42-72347, Douglas NC15845, to Northwest AL, as\n\nD-ANUK to Trans-Avia Dusseldorf, BIAS OO-VAN, Air Zaïre 9Q-CHB, rr 9Q-CBG, Congo Air Force 9T-THB,\n\nZAS 9Q-CBG, finally 9Q-CBK for Kinair Cargo. Destroyed 23Aug88 at Kinshasa M'Bamon Island,River Zaire.\n\nDouglas DC-4 LV-AGG (c/n 10333) of Aerolineas Argentinas.\n\nIt started its career with the USAF (42-72228), went to Santa Fe Skyways (NC90863), to FAMA as LV-AGG,\n\nto AL Argentinas, to Aerosur, to Aeropalas (still LV-AGG), to Fri Reyes reg'd as CP-1517 and SATCO as OB-T-1279.\n\nDouglas DC-4-1009 5T-CAD (c/n 42939) of Air Mauritanie.\n\n5T-CAD is a passenger DC-4 with c/n 42939. It had first served Air France (F-BBDG) before becoming 5T-CAD\n\nand went on to become 5T-MAJ for Force Aérienne Islamique de Mauritanie (this last phase of its career seems\n\n'in need of confirmation'). How, where and when its career ended is unclear...\n\nDouglas DC-6B YU-AFE (c/n 43552) of Adria Aviopromet has its nosewheel poitioned for its turn out and departure.\n\nMike McHugh corrected me here, with some local knowledge:\"DC-6B YU-AFE is arriving at Gatwick, not departing. It is about to turn so that the fuselage is parallel to the arrow on the ground underneath it and then stop. This was the normal parking position at Gatwck, and many other airports, before aerobridges. The curved arrow in the foreground shows the path the nosewheel will take when the aircraft departs.\"\n\nYU-AFE is another ex/ KLM propliner in this batch: DC-6B c/n 43552 started as PH-TFK with the Royal Dutch Airlines, was rereg'd to PH-DFK (leased with that tailnumber to Alitalia at some point), became HK-535 for SAM Colombia, returned to Europe for Adria Airways (YU-AFE), went to Brothers Air Services Co (BASCO, in Yemen)\n\ninitially as VR-ABJ but rereg'd as 7O-ABJ and ended as TF-ABJ with Iscargo. Srapped at Reykjavik, Iceland.\n\nA Douglas DC-6 of Aéromaritime; alas, its F-number is too vague to read.\n\nAéromaritime existed as Compagnie Aéromaritime d'Affrêtement during 1966-1987 and from 1987-1991 as Aéromaritime Int'l. Over the years it operated 5 Douglas Sixes. These were-\n\nDC-6A F-BGTY (c/n 43818, ex/ TU-TBC Air Afrique) and DC-6A F-BGSK (c/n 44063, ex/ CF-CUS\n\nCanadian AL Int'l) were operated, as well as DC-6B's: F-BGSL (c/n 43558, scrapped at LeBourget),\n\nF-BGOB (c/n 43833, also scrapped at LBG) and F-BHMR (c/n 43842, to Air Djibouti).\n\nDouglas C-47A F-BJRY (c/n 12255) of Air France\n\nHistory on c/n 12255 (courtesy ATDB.aero): C-47A-DK registered to USAF (42-92453), delivered as FZ670 to RAF. It was to become F-BAXX for Air France but the registration was not used, instead becoming TS-AXX for Tunisair. Then onwards to become F-BJRY for Air France, from where it went to Institut Aéronautique Amaury de la Grange.\n\nNext it was reg'd as N57927 for Englert Industries and C-GAXT for Québec Aviation.\n\nMoving into Latin America this C-47A became TG-AFA for Aviateca Guatamala.\n\nThe last owner and/or operator was Trans World Shipping Trading, with registered tailnumber N326UN.\n\nReregistration to N667H was not put in effect.\n\nWhere, how, when its career ended remains a mysterie!\n\nUpdate of Dec.2018:\n\nDouglas DC-3 PH-TDV (c/n 12083; later rereg'd PH-DAV) of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines\n\nIt later went on to operate with Itavia and PLUNA\n\nNo doubt the same situation with Douglas C-47A PH-TDV, from another perspective\n\nC-47A c/n 12083, courtesy ATDB.aero online database (Dec.2018)\n\nFreight shipping advert featuring the DC-3 and Convair aircraft\n\nKLM DC-6 or DC-7, being loaded with freight.
