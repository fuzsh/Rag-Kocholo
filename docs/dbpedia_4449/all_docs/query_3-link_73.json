The Avro York was a similar conversion with a redesigned fuselage.\n\nDesign and development\n\nIn 1943, Avro through its wartime Victory Aircraft Canadian subsidiary converted a Lancaster X bomber for civil transport duties with Trans-Canada Airlines (\"TCQ\"). This conversion was a success resulting in eight additional Lancaster Xs being converted. The \"specials\" were powered by Packard-built Merlin 38 engines and featured a lengthened, streamlined nose and tail cone. Range was enhanced by two 400-gallon Lancaster long-range fuel tanks fitted as standard in the bomb bay. These Lancastrians were used by TCA on its Montreal&ndash;Prestwick route.\n\nOperational history\n\nIn 1945, deliveries commenced of 30 British-built Lancastrians for BOAC. On a demonstration flight on 23 April 1945, \"G-AGLF\" flew 13,500 miles (21,700 km) from England to Auckland, New Zealand in three days, 14 hours at an average speed of 220 mph (354 km/h).\n\nSince the Lancastrian had rather limited cubic capacity yet was fast and had a long range, it was most suited for transport of mail and VIP passengers. BOAC used it for flights between England and Australia from 31 May 1945. It also served with the RAF, one of whose planes named \"Aries\" (before conversion to a Lancastrian for the North Pole flight) a Lancaster I number PD328 completed the first airborne circumnavigation of the globe, as well as serving with QANTAS and Flota Aerea Mercante Argentina.\n\nLancastrians were also used during the Berlin Airlift to transport petrol; 15 aircraft made over 5,000 trips.\n\nLancastrians were also used for tests of various turboprop and jet engines. One powered with Rolls-Royce Nene turbojets is credited with the first international passenger jet flight from London to Paris on 23 November 1946; the flight time was just 41 minutes.\n\ntar Dust\n\nOn 2 August 1947, Lancastrian \"G-AGWH\" \"Star Dust\" of British South American Airways crashed in the Argentine Andes after sending a cryptic radio message, what became known as the \"Stendec incident\". The wreckage was found 50 years later but the radio message remains a puzzle. \"Stendec\" was later adopted as the name of a UFO magazine.\n\nThe probable cause of the crash was a navigation error due to the then unknown effect of fast-moving, high altitude airstreams. Headwinds meant that dead reckoning of their position was inaccurate and the pilot started the descent while the plane was still over and not past the crest of the Andes mountains.\n\nIt was found that the aircraft's wreckage had moved several miles due to the movement of the glacier that it fell onto.\n\nVariants\n\n;Lancaster XPP:Nine built by converting Lancasters at Victory Aircraft Ltd Canada.;Lancastrian C.1:Nine-seat transport aircraft for BOAC and Qantas.
