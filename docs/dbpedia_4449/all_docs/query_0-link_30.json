        "text": "A Vampire crashed on 02 Aug 1952 at RAF Luqa and from records it seems to be the only Vampire crash on the Island.\n\nQuite a few Avro Yorks have crashed in Malta, in 1958 two Avro Yorks crashed on the 25th February and 22nd May. (Incidentally one was Dan Air G-AMUT)\n\nPerhaps your friend was referring to two Valetta's which crashed the day after each other? These being 17th and 18th May 1953 although records show them to be RAF aircraft as opposed to civilian registered.\n\nIf you look at this web page it lists all the post war crashes in Malta and there seems to be quite a few despite it being only a small island. Good luck with your research!\n\nhttp://www.aviationinmalta.com/page19.html\n\nRegards\n\nFly.Buy\n\nNew\n\nRe G-ANSY from 'To fly no more' by Colin Cummings.\n\n18-Feb-56, G-ANSY, York, Scottish Av, Near the Blue Grotto, Zurrieq, Malta.\n\nThe aircraft was engaged flying service personnel from the Suez area to UK and had stopped to refuel in Malta. Immediately after take-off it was reported that the aircraft was in difficulties with various reports of engine failure or fire. In attempting to return to the airfield at Luqa the aircraft crashed and all aboard were killed.\n\nCrew-\n\nCaptain Frank COKER 40, Pilot First Officer R GORVIN 30 Co-Pilot, Radio Officer J HAY 37, Navigation Officer R BEECHLY 38, Miss G UPHAM Air Stewardess\n\n(First Officer Gorvin and Miss Upham were engaged to be married)\n\nPassengers-\n\nCorporal Raymond WILLIAMS, Leading Aircraftman John Leslie FITZPATRICK, Aircraftman 1st Class Michael Joseph FLEMING, Leading Aircraftman Peter Roy CARLTON, Leading Aircraftman Roy HAMPSON, Leading Aircraftman Dennis PARKER, Leading Aircraftman Stuart Henderson BUTCHART, Leading Aircraftman Ernest Richard HARRIS, Aircraftman 1st Class Richard YOUNG, Leading Aircraftman Michael PYE, Leading Aircraftman John Fortune WILSON, Corporal John David COLLIER, Corporal Cornelius Christopher BURKE, Corporal James Arthur EDWARDS, Leading Aircraftman John Marshall HOLLIDAY, Flight Sergeant Herbert Frederick GEORGE, Corporal William STEVEN, Sergeant Jack Ward SPENCE, Corporal Philip John BLY, Leading Aircraftman Gordon KENYON, Leading Aircraftman Frederick Robert James KEATING, Corporal John James MACKAY, Corporal Reginald Frederick WEARING, Corporal George Anderson CRAIGIE, Leading Aircraftman Alexander Murray BARBOUR, Corporal Walter George TALBOT, Corporal Brian Charles PRATCHETT, Sergeant Bryan Frederick John ALBERRY Corporal John Raymond COX, Leading Aircraftman Dougald BROWN, Leading Aircraftman Mervyn John NURSE, Senior Aircraftman Glenn WORTLEY, Leading Aircraftman William Waterson FLEMING, Leading Aircraftman Douglas MILLAR\n\nCorporal Jack BRACEWELL, Corporal John Stuart Elliott FAWCETT, Sergeant John Albert SPENCER, Senior Aircraftman Thomas Geoffrey DUMBILL, Leading Aircraftman Timothy DRURY-LOWE, Corporal Alan James PATERSON, Senior Aircraftman Sidney Andrew HODSON, Leading Aircraftman Keith Emlyn WILLIAMS, Corporal Thomas Kenneth ROBERTS, Private A SMITH RAOC.\n\nGeoff.\n\nNew"
