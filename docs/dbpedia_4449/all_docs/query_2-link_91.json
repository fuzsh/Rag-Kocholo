        "text": "LOGANAIR has axed three routes and temporarily cut services on seven others in a major overhaul to its operations.\n\nThe UK’s largest regional airline announced the changes this afternoon after a “root and branch” review under its new CEO Luke Farajallah.\n\nIt follows complaints over delayed or cancelled flights with Loganair admitting they had become stretched and “falling short of the service levels expected of us”.\n\nFrom May 10, the airline’s Aberdeen to Teesside and Newcastle services and its Glasgow to Southampton route will no longer operate.\n\nMr Farajallah said: “Since my first day as CEO of Loganair last month, I have been listening carefully to feedback from our loyal customers and hard-working crew.\n\n\"I want to personally apologise to everyone who has been impacted by the unacceptable levels of disruption that have been experienced for over 18-months whilst the airline has been undertaking a re-fleeting programme.\n\n“We appreciate the changes we are announcing today may impact some customers whose bookings may need to change.\n\n“While we apologise to customers affected, this decision is one that has been made for the greater good of the vast majority of customers who must be able to book and fly with confidence, especially from some of the most remote parts of the UK.\n\n“Loganair is the UK’s largest regional airline, and we are getting back to the basic principles that have made us successful for over six decades.”\n\nSeven other routes will see minor adjustments to frequency, in varying stages, until the end of the summer schedule on October 26\n\nThese include Edinburgh to Southampton, Inverness to Manchester, Glasgow to Derry and Glasgow to Donegal.\n\nInverness to Stornoway, Isle of Man to Birmingham, and Newcastle to Southampton will also be reduced."
