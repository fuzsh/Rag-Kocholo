        "text": "Spoiler\n\nThe Twin Pioneer (often abbreviated to ‘Twin Pin’) is a STOL transport aircraft from the late 1950s, and at first glance it is fairly unremarkable, Low speed, 2 engines, 1.5 Tonnes of cargo, nothing really unique or interesting, and if you read slightly more in the wikipedia you may notice its bomb load on the very last line, however there is far more to this aircraft than first meets the eye.\n\nFirst However let’s add some backstory, The Twin Pioneer was built and designed by Scottish Aviation Limited at Prestwick airport, Glasgow and was developed from their earlier Scottish Aviation Pioneer from the Late 40s, both aircraft had been designed to be capable of operating from extremely short stretches of land (as short as 300m) and carrying a fair amount of cargo, the twin Pioneer was an overall improvement over its predecessor and was designed with Military roles in mind.\n\nThe first orders came from the RAF who ordered 39 Aircraft in 1958, these aircraft saw extensive use in the Malayan emergency in which the Pioneers were used in moving troops and supplies, and on occasion was employed in combat, however these were not standard and were often last minute decisions due to some sort of emergency (having no other aircraft available to stop an enemy advance for example).\n\nWhere the Twin Pioneers Truly excelled though, was in the Middle east, where they were deployed to Oman, Bahrain and other areas around Aden and the Persian Gulf. This is where things get interesting, as whilst there had already been minor attempts of arming the Pioneers with Brens being fitted to rear doors or Brownings being fitted under the Gear, the most powerful addition was approved for modification. A French team from Sud aviation experimentally fitted SS.10 and SS.11 Missiles to the Underside of the wings of the Twin pioneer, initially they were not cleared for firing however during an emergency the ‘Twin Pin’ was called upon.\n\nDuring the Radfan Campaign in Yemen rebel solders had taken cover in a series of cave networks in a Valley, with Hunters launching rocket attacks on them, however the Hunters were too fast to get down into the Valley to accurately take out the Rebels, and thus a Twin Pioneer from Khormaksar was loaded up with four SS.11s and took off to engage the rebels, the slower speed of the Twin Pioneer allowed it to descend right down into the Valley where it fired two SS.11s at rebel positions, destroying them returning to base with two missiles left to spare.\n\nThis instance also happens to have been the First case of the Royal Air force ever firing a Guided weapon in anger, around 20 years earlier than when the Royal Navy is credited with during the Falklands War. Aside from this, SS.11 Trials were undertaken by the ETPS back in britain, where so far the only picture of a Twin Pioneer equipped with Missiles comes from (see images).\n\nOutside of the RAF service, the Twin Pioneer was used by several air forces, such as Malaysia, of Whom the Twin Pioneer was the First aircraft to ever be used by their are force. slightly lesser known as well is that a Twin Pioneer was also covertly operated by the CIA under the Guise of the Philippines Air Lines and other cover airlines before being irreparably damaged in a thunderstorm in 1968."
