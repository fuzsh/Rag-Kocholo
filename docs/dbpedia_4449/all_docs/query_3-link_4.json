        "text": "Avro York C1 at the RAF Museum, Cosford, Shropshire, 8 July 2020. The York was a civil and military transport employing the wings, engines and undercarriage as the Lancaster heavy bomber.\n\nThe prototype first flew in 1942 but the York only entered limited production and when it entered military service in 1943 it was on a small scale (usually as VIP transports – including for Winston Churchill and King George VI). It was not until the war ended that full scale production began (and even that was short lived). This was because the UK had obtained the American government’s agreement to supply the RAF’s transport needs so that the British aircraft industry could concentrate on producing combat aircraft.\n\nHowever, post war the York was outdated compared to American aircraft such as the Douglas DC-4 and Lockheed Constellation which came to dominate the civil sphere whilst the Handley Page Hastings was under development as a military transport to replace the York. Thus production of the York ceased in 1948.\n\nMost military examples were retired by 1950, although one soldiered on until 1957 and several civil charter airlines contracted their aircraft to the RAF as troop transports for some years to come. Nonetheless, Yorks played a prominent part in the 1949 Berlin Airlift (RAF Dakotas and Hastings also played a big part), contributing almost half of the goods supplied by the RAF. Many RAF Yorks were sold to civil airlines, although others were simply scrapped in the 1950’s. Civil Yorks continued in use until 1964, latterly as freighters."
