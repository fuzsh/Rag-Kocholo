The school had opened in 1916 along Cameron Street, just west of North West Street, where the Jefferson-Houston School is today. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/01041923AlexandriaHighSchool.jpg The old Alexandria High School.

Seen in the background of this Civil War era photo of Union soldiers taken in front of Gadsby’s Tavern, the dormered building is further marked by a large horizontal sign extending over the public sidewalk reading “Restaurant.\" /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/01051874Gadsbys.jpg Civil War era photo of Gadsby's Tavern, with the old George's Tavern in the background. 01/06 1873 1001 South Royal Street hospital, smallpox On January 6, 1873 a temporary hospital was erected on South Washington Street, near St. Mary’s Cemetery, to accommodate the huge increase in victims that had succumbed to a massive Smallpox epidemic underway in Alexandria. The attempt to isolate indigent and “outside poor” patients away from the densely populated downtown area, at a spot where Washington Street dead-ended at Great Hunting Creek, proved fruitless for those who had contracting the disease, and many died soon after they were admitted to the facility. The City provided a coffin and burial for the dead, with the price of a plain coffin reduced from five to two dollars as a result of the large quantities needed. However, at the same time transport and burial costs increased dramatically from one to ten dollars, due to the increased risk of disease posed to undertakers and gravediggers. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/01061873AlexGaz02051873Smallpox.JPG Article about expenses at the smallpox hospital, Alexandria Gazette, 02/05/1873. 01/07 2000 5005 Duke Street Beatley Library Alexandria Archaeological Commission, Time Capsule, 250th Anniversary, Alexandria Canal Tide Lock, Raymond Cannetti On January 7, 2000, a time capsule was buried at the soon to be opened Beatley Library. Organized by the Alexandria Archaeological Commission, the time capsule project was part of Alexandria’s 250th Anniversary celebration in 1999. A stone excavated from the Alexandria Canal Tide Lock site and carved by master mason Raymond Cannetti marks the burial site. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/01072000TimeCapsuleMarker.jpg Stone marking the 250th anniversary Time Capsule at the Beatley library.

Renovations to the building included game rooms, a photographic darkroom and an indoor gym. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/01091951AlexandriaArmory.jpg Alexandria Armory building, 200 block S. Royal Street. Courtesy, Alexandria Library, Special Collections. 01/10 1950 Water closet, indoor toilet, outhouses, sewer On January 10, 1950, the Alexandria City Council passed an ordinance requiring a water closet at all residences within the city. By using the term “water closet” the City did not actually mandate that each home include a full working bathroom within its interior. Rather, a single toilet installed within the confines of even a tiny room met the terms of the building code to finally eliminate exterior outhouses within the city. A year later, when Alexandria annexed a huge area of rural land from Fairfax County, west of Quaker Lane, this code was fully enforced by the Health Department, resulting in the extension of sewer lines and rapid transformation of the area from farms to high-density development. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/01101950Toilets.jpg 01/11 1798 717 Queen Street Barrett Branch Library Alexandria Library Company, Stabler-Leadbeater Apothecary, The Lyceum, Lloyd House On January 11, 1798, the Alexandria Library Company was first incorporated as a private subscription library. Over the years the library moved among locations such as the Stabler-Leadbeater Apothecary and The Lyceum and in the mid-1930s was assumed within the public budget of the City of Alexandria under the control of a Board comprised of the Alexandria Library Company and others appointed by City Council. The first public library building, now the Barrett Branch Library was built in 1937 and named in honor of Kate Waller Barrett, a humanitarian, social crusader and political reformer. It is the second largest collection in the Alexandria Library with more than 100,000 items. The Branch, located in the Old Town section of Alexandria, was renovated and expanded in 1995 and reconfigured in April 2000 to house the historical and genealogical research collections formerly located at Lloyd House. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/01011798Library.jpg The Barrett Branch Library. 01/12 1864 King Street Telegraph Company On January 12, 1864 the Clerk of the Alexandria Common Council was directed to notify the Telegraph Company whose wires and poles already traversed King Street, that the telegraph lines must be placed in a direct line with the street curb within thirty days. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/01121864TelegraphPolesSnow.jpg Telegraph Poles. 01/13 1874 121 North Fairfax Street Carlyle House Fire On January 13, 1874, a fire broke at the Carlyle House. The fire was concentrated on the roof near a chimney but firefighters extinguished it before any serious damage occurred. After construction of a large hotel in front of the 18th century home built for Alexandria founder John Carlyle on North Fairfax Street, the once elegant structure was neglected and often used as a transient boarding house, resulting in unsafe conditions. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/01131874CarlyleHouseFront.jpg Carlyle House. Courtesy, Library of Congress. 01/14 1941 3210 King Street Chinquapin Village World War II On January 14, 1941, the federal government purchased 41 acres of land at Chinquapin Hollow along King Street for $15,000, to develop the Chinquapin Village War Housing Project, created for the families of defense workers at the newly reactivated Torpedo Factory on Alexandria’s waterfront. Named for the Chinquapin tree, whose small husked acorns were used for centuries as a staple of the Native American diet, the community consisted of 300 family units sheltering nearly 1,500 people. Due to its somewhat rural isolation, the complex included internal public amenities including a community hall for social activities and church services, a softball field and children’s playground. At the height of torpedo production, three shifts of workers were continually shuttled from their temporary homes to the factory three miles away by buses, 24 four hours a day, and seven days a week. Though the duplex dwellings were small and drafty, residents who came to Alexandria from many different states loved the sense of community and friendship that developed at the site. Dismantled in the 1960’s, remnants of Chinquapin Village still remain behind the Chinquapin Recreation Center. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/01141941ChinquapinVillage.jpg Aerial photo of Chinquapin Village. 01/14 1962 4320 Seminary Road Alexandria Hospital Lyndon B. Johnson, hospital, ribbon cutting On January 14, 1962, the new Alexandria Hospital on Seminary Road was officially dedicated. Vice-President Lyndon B. Johnson cut the ribbon before a crowd of more than 5,000. The new facility cost around $3.7 million to build. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/01141962LBJHospital.jpg Lyndon B. Johnson at the dedication for the new Alexandria Hospital, 1962. 01/15 1775 George Washington, militia In a prelude of the gathering of war clouds between the American colonies and the British government, on January 15, 1775, George Washington reviewed troops of the local militia in Alexandria and selected a committee for the County of Fairfax to prepare for the possibility of conflict. Two days later he recommended a new tax on county residents to support the militia and to purchase military supplies and equipment. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/12161766Washington1772.jpg Portrait of George Washington, Charles Wilson Peale, 1772.

Built during World War II, the USO center provided recreational and social activities for service members. The City of Alexandria later acquired the building for use by the Department of Recreation and today it’s known as the Dr. Oswald Durant Memorial Center. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/01161947USOBuilding.jpg The USO building, formerly on the 1600 block of Cameron Street. 01/18 1852 Duke Street at Diagonal Road Catt's Tavern Drover's Tavern, West End, Hiring Day, African American On January 18, 1852, the annual ”Hiring Day” for free African American men took place at what was then just outside the Alexandria city limits , enabling freedmen to obtain both permanent and long-term temporary employment in the Northern Virginia region.. The tradition of setting aside one day in January for this practice had been established decades before and connected farmers and cattle drovers from settlements to the west of Alexandria with a larger pool of employable men ready and waiting for job opportunities during the coming year. The event was always held at Catt’s Tavern, also known as the Drover’s Tavern, located at Duke Street and Diagonal Road in what became known as the original “West End” of Alexandria, well known for its breweries, slaughterhouses and less than reputable businesses. The rough-and-tumble hostelry catered to the lodging needs of those transporting agricultural products and cattle from far outside the Port City, and capitalized on their constant need for additional labor back on their farms. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/01181852CattsTavern.jpg Catt's Tavern, also known as the Drover's Tavern, on Duke Street at Diagonal Road. 01/19 1807 607 Oronoco Street Robert E. Lee Boyhood Home Robert E. Lee, Stratford Hall, Light Horse Harry Lee, Hallowell School, Alexandria Academy On January 19, 1807, Robert Edward Lee, a descendant of one of Virginia’s oldest families, was born at the Lee family seat, Stratford Hall in Westmoreland County. He was the son of Revolutionary War hero, Major General Henry Lee III, known as “Light Horse Harry” lee, and his second wife, Anne Hill Carter. Two years after he was born, his father was placed in debtor’s prison, and when he was released in 1810, the family moved to Alexandria, and the following year took up residence at a home on Oronoco Street, owned by William Henry Fitzhugh, a relative of Anne Lee, and adjacent to the famous “Lee Corner” at Washington Street where other Lee family members maintained homes. In 1812 Henry Lee traveled to the West Indies where he died in 1818, leaving his wife and six children to be cared for by relatives. As a child, Robert attended school locally, at both the school operated by Benjamin Hallowell and at the Alexandria Academy, a free school for local boys. In 1825 he enrolled at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York where graduated second in his class. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/01191807RobertELee1838.jpg Portrait of Robert E.

Most ferries were able to resume their trips between Alexandria and Washington, though not all wharves were accessible. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/01201874PotomacFrozen.jpg The Potomac River frozen over. Courtesy, Library of Congress. 01/20 1942 Ambulance, Potomac Truck and Engine Company On January 20, 1942, the Alexandria City Council authorized the purchase of an ambulance for first time. Alexandria’s first ambulance was acquired in the 1930s, but it had been paid for with donations, after members of the Potomac Truck and Engine Company, which had organized the first rescue squad in Alexandria, raised money to purchase one. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/01201942RescueSquad.jpg The rescue squad at the Potomac Fire Department, ca. 1942. 01/21 1852 Potomac River frozen On January 21, 1852, the Potomac River was entirely frozen over between Virginia and Maryland. People came to Alexandria from Fort Washington and points further south by traveling across the frozen river, as though it were a road. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/01211852FrozenPotomacLOC1918.jpg Potomac River ice jams, 1918.

Price, Glenn Brown, Richardsonian Style On January 21, 1953, a large fire destroyed the City Armory located in the 200 block of South Royal Street. The armory housed military equipment but also served as a community recreation center during peacetime. Designed in 1880 by Benjamin F. Price, and expanded seven years later by architect Glenn Brown, the large armory held space for 700 people, with a slate roof, brick turrets and monumental arches in the “Richardsonian” style. Thankfully, a steel and concrete vault prevented the explosion of hundreds of rounds of ammunition stored in the building during the fire. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/01091951AlexandriaArmory.jpg Alexandria Armory building, 200 block S. Royal Street. Courtesy, Alexandria Library, Special Collections. 01/23 1866 Fire Department On January 23, 1866 an act was passed by City Council to establish a paid City Fire Department for Alexandria. For over a century, fire was a constant threat to Alexandria and even one forgotten candle could develop into a major conflagration involving dozens of homes and businesses. For decades the city had been served by a number of small, volunteer companies including the Friendship, Hydraulion, Relief, Sun and others, but the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 severely disrupted the volunteer companies as local men signed up for enlistment or fled the area. Responsibility for subduing fire in the city was left to the Union military government which by 1863 had largely destroyed existing firefighting equipment through misuse and neglect. When the war ended, city fathers realized that it would be almost impossible to recreate a reliable volunteer system, and firefighting was accepted as a municipal responsibility.\n\nOver the coming months the Alexandria Fire Department and Office of Historic Alexandria will celebrate the 100 anniversary of the AFD with a wide variety of events and activities. Of course, these commemorative programs will be highlighted in this e-newsletter each week as they occur.\n\n/uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/06301865FriendshipFirehouse.jpg Friendship Firehouse Museum. Office of Historic Alexandria. 01/24 1876 Mayor Kosciusko Kemper, police, marbles, kites On January 24, 1876, in response to growing complaints from residents and shopkeepers alike, Mayor Kosciusko Kemper ordered police to crack down on youthful offenders creating mayhem on the streets of Alexandria. Specifically, police were ordered to arrest anyone flying kites or playing the popular game of marbles on public streets or sidewalks, a directive that applied primarily to school age children seeking amusement in the city. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/01241876MarblesSketch.jpg “Marbles” by James McNeill Whistler (between 1886 and 1887). Library of Congress. 01/25 1949 Postage stamp, Bicentennial, Carlyle House, Gadsby's Tavern On January 25, 1949, the United States Senate authorized production of a 6-cent postage stamp commemorating Alexandria’s bi-centennial celebration being held that year. The special air mail stamp featured the City seal and two of the City’s most significant historical sites, Carlyle House and the original section of Gadsby’s Tavern. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/01251949Stamp.jpg 1949 postage stamp commemorating Alexandria's bicentennial. Office of Historic Alexandria. 01/26 1937 717 Queen Street Barrett Library Robert South Barrett, Kate Waller Barrett, Alexandria Library, Society of Friends, Quaker burial ground, cemetery, Alexandria Library Company On January 26, 1937, the Alexandria City Council approved a proposal by Dr. Robert South Barrett who offered to provide funds to the City to erect a public library in memory of his mother, Dr. Kate Waller Barrett. Previously, the Alexandria Library was a private subscription library with subscribers paying an annual membership fee. The site chosen for the new facility at 717 Queen Street had been used as a Quaker burial ground, but The Society of Friends granted a 99-year lease for use of its property as a site for the new building. The Alexandria Library Company then signed an agreement with City Council, turning over its collections to the City, and Council agreed to include operating expenses for the public library in its future operating budgets. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/01261937KateWallerBarrett.JPG Kate Waller Barrett.

In the years after World War II signs across the city began to become larger and larger to attract the attention of the increasingly motorized population driving through the city. Some signs, such as the one pictured here atop the 1922 George Mason Hotel, was one of three neon signs installed on engineered structural frames on the roof of the building, pointed towards City Hall and in both directions on Washington Street. With this new trend starting to accelerate, officials determined it was now time to regulate signage. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/01291947GeorgeMasonHotel1922.JPG The George Mason Hotel, 1922. 01/30 1849 Montgomery D. Corse, California gold rush, Mexican War, 17th VA Regiment, Civil War On January 30, 1849, resident Montgomery D. Corse, a prominent Alexandrian and military officer who had served in the Mexican War, left the city with a group of like-minded Alexandrians to seek their fortune in the California gold rush. Their journey westward took place one year and six days after gold was first discovered by John Marshall at Sutter’s Mill in Coloma, California. Kept a secret at first, rumors of gold found in the American River were finally confirmed by President James Polk through an address to Congress on December 5, 1848. Upon hearing the news, Corse and his associates immediately made travel and prospecting plans, arriving on April 1 and ultimately being joined by over 300,000 “forty-niners” who fled en masse to the former Mexican territory. After his return to Alexandria, years later Captain Corse went on to lead the 17th VA Regiment, C.S.A., during the American Civil War. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/01301849MDCorse.jpg Montgomery D. Corse. 02/01 1946 221 King Street Ramsay House Alexandria Historical Society On February 1, 1946, a member of the Ramsay House Restoration Committee announced the formation of the Alexandria Historical Society. The new organization would seek incorporation and raise money to save Ramsay House, the historic structure at King and Fairfax streets, which was threatened with demolition. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/02011946RamsayHouse.jpg Ramsay House.

Library of Congress. 02/02 1848 Mexican-American War, Nicholas Philip Trist On February 2, 1848, Nicholas Philip Trist of Alexandria negotiated the controversial “Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo” in Mexico, ending the Mexican-American War. Despite a questionable past, the influential lawyer was appointed as the official representative of President James Polk in the negotiations with Mexico, with specific instructions to seek acquisition of the Baja California peninsula for the United States under the terms of the settlement. A pro-slavery advocate, Trist was no stranger to controversy for his previous corruption activities associated with the production of false documents to facilitate illegal slave trading. After arriving in Mexico, his conduct did not meet Polk’s expectations and he was soon recalled to Washington. But Trist disregarded Polk’s instructions to return and continued to negotiate, signing an agreement that drew a westward line from Yuma, Arizona to an area between San Diego and Tijuana, without the coveted peninsula. Polk was furious with his representative, but the long distance between Mexico and Washington prevented new negotiations within an acceptable timeframe and he was forced to accept the result. But Trist was immediately fired for insubordination upon his return to America, and his personal expenses remained unpaid for decades. In later life he became Postmaster of Alexandria, and he died in the city in 1874. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/02021848TristLOC.jpg Nicholas Philip Trist.

Robinson was elected to chair the executive committee of the State Negro Press Association. Born in 1852, Robinson was a lifelong Alexandrian and his parents provided him with a private school education. For a time he went to Howard University, but withdrew due to a serious illness. He then turned his attention to teaching, and then journalism, becoming one of Alexandria’s most well-respected and beloved African American leaders in the early 20th century. Robinson was founder and editor of the Leader, a weekly African-American newspaper, which was first published in Washington, D.C., and then in Alexandria. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/02021904MagnuslRobinson.jpg Magnus L Robinson. 02/03 1846 Retrocession On February 3, 1846, after Alexandrians petitioned Congress and the Virginia legislature, the Virginia General Assembly agreed to accept the retrocession of Alexandria from the District of Columbia to the Commonwealth, if Congress also approved. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/02031846RetrocessionAccepted.jpg The Act of Retrocession, published in the Alexandria Gazette. 02/04 1861 Unionist, George Brent, slavery, secessionist convention On February 4, 1861, Unionist George Brent was elected to represent Alexandria at the upcoming secessionist convention to be convened in Richmond shortly thereafter. Brent, who supported slavery, correctly predicted that if Southern states seceded from the United States, they would most likely lose a potential war with the North, possibly resulting in the elimination of slavery in all states. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/04041861GeorgeBrent.jpg George Brent. 02/05 1797 Alexandria Gazette, newspaper On February 5, 1797, the Alexandria Gazette, established in 1784, began daily publication; the newspaper is considered the oldest daily newspaper in the United States. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/02051797GazetteLogo.jpg Logo of the Alexandria Gazette. 02/07 1812 Earthquake At about 4 a.m. on February 7, 1812, an aftershock from an earthquake centered at New Madrid, Missouri, rattled windows in Alexandria. This aftershock, estimated to be of a 7.7 magnitude, followed one on January 23, 1812 and the initial quake that hit on December 16, 1811. A day after the aftershock, Poulson’s American Daily Advertiser publication included the following Alexandria entry: There was another shock of an Earthquake felt at this place, at about 4 o’clock yesterday morning - its motion was about north-to-south - a gentle undulation, about the same in degree with that felt the 23d ult. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/02071812NewMadridEarthquake.jpg The New Madrid earthquake, lithograph.

Padgett On February 7, 1944, Alexandria officials reported that 15 violations of the previous night’s “blackout” had been documented. Chief Air Raid Ward Bernard J. Padgett said that the blackout, designed to protect populated areas from being seen from above during war time, was Alexandria’ 28th. Information on violators would be turned over to police for further investigation. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/02071944BlackoutPoster.jpg WPA Blackout poster.

Stewart of St. Paul’s Church was arrested by Union troops for omitting a prayer for President Abraham Lincoln during services. Within a couple months, St. Paul’s was converted into use as a Union hospital. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/02091862StPauls.jpg St. Paul's Church.

Bendheim, synagogue On February 10, 1957, congregation leaders, including Mayor Leroy S. Bendheim, laid the cornerstone at Beth El’s new synagogue on Seminary Road. First established in 1859 and the oldest Reform congregation in Northern Virginia, Beth El Hebrew Congregation had previously worshipped at a synagogue on North Washington Street from 1871 to 1954. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/02101957BethElCornerstoneGazette.jpg Cornerstone, Beth El Hebrew Congregation.

Woodson to commemorate the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln on February 12th, and Frederick Douglass on February 14th. In many black communities, these birthdays were already commemorated in the years between 1865 and 1926. Black History Week evolved into Black History Month in 1976. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/02121926UrbanSlavery.jpg Martha Ann \"Patty\" Atavis, Baltimore, with Alice Lee Whitridge, one of the children in her care.

Although all navigation ceased, townspeople that were brave enough were able to walk to the Maryland shore and back again. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/02131855FrozenPotomacRecent.jpg The Potomac River frozen over. 02/13 1897 George Washington, birthday celebration On February 13, 1897, it was announced that there would be no public celebration of the birth of George Washington in the City of Alexandria that year. Due to the very difficult economic times, potential contributors to the celebration preferred that their funds be used instead to help the poor, and a large number of out-of-work firemen stressed that did not have money for the appropriate “trimmings” associated with being in a proper parade. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/02131897GWPortrait.jpg Portrait of George Washington (cropped from unfinished portrait), Gilbert Stewart, 1796, Museum of Fine Art, Boston. 02/15 1910 Emmett C. Dunn, building regulations, City Manager, Alexandria City Council On February 15, 1910, the Alexandria City Council approved newly proposed building regulations prepared by City Engineer Emmett C. Dunn. Dunn developed these detailed regulations for architects and builders doing work in Alexandria to avoid misunderstandings. Dunn worked for the City for 46 years, including three years as City Manager.\n\n/uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/02151910EmmettCDunn.jpg Emmet C. Dunn.

The Green's lived in the home of John Carlyle, one of the town's founders, and built the hotel across the front yard. The hotel on North Fairfax Street was redone with the finest interior decoration and furnishings available and newly arriving guests were awed by the lavishness. But Mr. Green’s magnificent renovation of Alexandria’s finest hotel was to be short-lived as tensions rose between the North and South, culminating in the election of President Abraham Lincoln in 1860. Just two years after the hotel reopened, anticipating that a civil war may be inevitable, the Alexandria Riflemen, Mount Vernon Guards, Old Dominion Rifles and Alexandria Artillery merged to form the Alexandria Battalion. On May 24, 1861, Alexandria was invaded by Union forces and became an occupied city. In early November of that year, the massive hotel, with a dumb waiter big enough to vertically transport a sick or wounded soldier, was confiscated by the Union Army for a general hospital to care for the ever-increasing numbers of sick and wounded Civil War soldiers in Northern Virginia. Green received a letter that stated he had three days to vacate the premises. The hospital story is featured in the PBS series, Mercy Street, airing Season 2 in January/February 2017. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/02171859MansionHouse.jpg Mansion House Hotel.

Less than two months later, on April 15 he met with five colonial governors at the Congress of Alexandria, held at the home of John Carlyle. Braddock had hoped to raise funding from the colonies to finance the French and Indian War, but was rebuffed in his efforts by the governors, who demanded that the United Kingdom honor its past promises of financial support. The meeting was one of the first instances of tension over taxation between the Americans colonies and Britain. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/02201775BraddockLOC.JPG General Braddock, printed by Wm.

Murray, 90, was struck and killed by a car at North Washington and Oronoco streets. Murray had been one of 29 men at a meeting organized by W.E.B. DuBois in 1905 on the Canadian side of the Niagara River. The meeting called for an end to racial discrimination and disenfranchisement, and the Niagara Movement led to the founding of the NAACP four years later in 1909. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/02201950FHMMurray.jpg Freeman H.M.

That evening, Edith Bolling Galt Wilson, wife of the nation’s 28th President, Woodrow Wilson, was the guest of honor at a reception and ball held for Washington at Gadsby’s Tavern. Twelve years later Mrs. Wilson was again to be Alexandria’s guest of honor at the Woodrow Wilson Bridge dedication on her husband’s 105th birthday, December 28, 1961. Unfortunately, crowds already assembled for that ceremony learned she had died suddenly that very morning of congestive heart failure. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/02221949EdithWilson.jpg Edith Bolling Galt Wilson.

The City’s urban renewal and redevelopment process in the mid-1960’s involved the demolition of dozens of historic buildings, most directly fronting street sidewalks, and their replacement by larger buildings, often set back from the street in what were formerly backyards or open areas. As construction progressed, the remains of 18th and 19th century privies, outbuildings and refuse middens were soon identified across multiple blocks and thousands of artifacts unearthed. Initially, the Smithsonian Institute stepped in to provide emergency archaeological services, but within several years permanent archaeologists were added to City staff. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/02251975AACBrochure.jpg Alexandria Archaeology Commission brochure.

Princeton, the first screw steam warship of the United States Navy, left the docks of Alexandria with President James Tyler, former First Lady Dolley Madison and 400 other dignitaries aboard for a short pleasure cruise and demonstration of two new wrought iron guns installed on the ship after its completion in 1843. After lunching in the ship’s interior, the guests moved to the upper decks to view the gun demonstrations. As the presentation progressed, one of the guns suddenly exploded sending shrapnel into the crowd, killing nine and injuring 20. Although the President and Mrs. Madison escaped harm, Secretary of State Abel P. Upshur and Secretary of the Navy Thomas Gilmer were among those killed in the catastrophe. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/02281844USSPrincetonExplosion.jpg Lithograph, “Awful explosion of the peace-maker on board the U.S. Steam Frigate Princeton” by Currier & Ives.

The first census completed that year determined that Virginia was the most populous state in the country with 747,610 residents; well more than double that of the State of New York. Fairfax County, of which Alexandria then a part, contained 12,320 residents, with 2,482 people living within the town itself. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/03011790USMap1790.jpg Map showing the population of the United States, from the 1790 Census.

After City officials consulted with President Andrew Johnson and the U.S. Attorney General, it was agreed that African Americans could cast ballots, but that their votes would not be counted in the final tally. To keep the peace, two companies of U.S. troops and a battalion of cavalry were sent to Alexandria as about 1,000 African Americans voted for the Union ticket. It was not until 1870 that the Fifteenth Amendment was passed, granting voting rights to black citizens. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/03021867LyceumCivilWar.jpg The Lyceum during the Civil War.

The cornerstone had been set the summer before and when completed, the church building measured 45 feet by 60 feet. The church is said to have been started in 1795 when Colonel John Fitzgerald, a close friend and associate of George Washington, and an early mayor of Alexandria, took up a collection to fund construction of a small chapel at the southern end of South Washington Street, now the site of St. Mary’s Cemetery, where the street ended at the edge of Great Hunting Creek. According to local tradition, Washington himself made the first contribution to the effort to provide a house of worship for Catholics in Northern Virginia. In 1810, St. Mary’s moved to a new building closer to town, at 310 South Royal Street where it remains today. The land on which the original chapel once stood is still in use today as St. Mary’s Cemetery. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/03041827StMarysChurch.jpg St Mary's Church. 03/04 1861 Abraham Lincoln, election, Civil War, secession On March 4, 1861, Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated as President of the United States. The election of 1860 was hotly contested, with four candidates vying for the position. Lincoln received no majority in any Southern state and in Alexandria he received only two votes out of almost 1,000 cast. The outrage of his election in Southern states was so strong, that for his own safety, he had to enter the City of Washington secretly in the dark of night. Almost immediately votes of secession by state legislatures in the South began and within three months the American Civil War had begun. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/03041861Map1860Election.jpg Map of the 1860 Election. 03/05 1910 200 block Prince Street sidewalks On March 5, 1910, sidewalks were being installed on Prince Street.

Although a scrawny and somewhat homely equestrian specimen, Little Sorrel was the favorite mount of Confederate hero-general Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson, who respected the horse for his fierce charge and steady gait. After Jackson was killed by friendly at Chancellorsville, the horse became an attraction of sorts, beloved by Southerners for his dedication to his master. He died in Richmond in 1886 after falling from an improvised sling which, due to age and infirmity, was rigged together to help him stand. Soon after, he was mounted and presented to the Virginia Military Institute Museum, where he remains today, displayed near the raincoat that Stonewall Jackson was wearing when he was mortally wounded. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/03071887LittleSorrel.jpg Little Sorrel, at the Virginia Military Institute Museum. 03/09 1855 2823 King Street Ivy Hill Cemetery On March 9, 1855, stockholders for a new cemetery held a meeting to elect a president and board of directors.

In the early 1960’s “urban renewal” in the United States focused largely on the demolition and reconstruction of deteriorated downtown areas, rather than the restoration of historic buildings to revitalize city centers, a concept that emerged a decade later. In Alexandria, renewal was originally proposed for a twelve block area further west along King Street, but ultimately moved east, centered on the area around Gadsby’s Tavern, City Hall and Market Square. Ultimately, the project involved excavation of entire blocks at and near Market Square, as well as demolition of 18th- and 19th-century buildings considered at the time as contributing to blighted conditions in what would come to be known as “Old Town.” Although the project resulted in the demolition of dozens of early buildings in the nation’s third oldest historic district, the economic impact of the development soon reversed years of decline. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/03101965GadsbysBlock.jpg 400 Block of King Street, during the Gadsby's Urban Renewal Project, 1960s.

Immediately upon his return, President Washington had requested Jefferson to accept the post of Secretary of State, which he accepted. He was sworn in just eleven days after the Alexandria celebration and served as the nation’s top diplomat until the last day of 1793. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/03111790Jefferson.jpg Thomas Jefferson, engraved by Ole Erickson, c.1876.

In 1801, the national capital was officially designated on lands donated by the states of Maryland and Virginia, with the small seaport communities of Georgetown, Maryland and Alexandria, Virginia included within the diamond-shaped, 100 mile square boundary of the new city. But development of Federal government buildings was restricted almost exclusively to the east side of the Potomac River, and Alexandria’s formerly robust economy slowly stagnated, with residents complaining about their reduced influence in the planned metropolis. Further complicating the issue were concerns about laws and policies in the District, including slavery, that were evolving differently from the established view in Southern states that threatened to isolate Alexandria further from its immediate surroundings. These economic conditions, loss of voting rights and a proposal to outlaw slavery within the District in the 1840’s compelled Alexandrians to successfully petition Congress to allow their area to return to Virginia. Finally, Congress agreed with Alexandrians that the former lands of the Old Dominion should be returned to the Commonwealth as Alexandria County. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/03131847RetrocessionMap1910.jpg Map of Retrocession.

At the age of twenty he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School and soon after married Hannah Harmon and moved to Alexandria where he took over the practice of Dr. William Rumney. He became a close friend of George Washington and was the attending physician at his death. Although a fine doctor, Dick speculated extensively in real estate and ultimately went bankrupt in 1801 when economic circumstances retrenched. He lost his home at 408 Duke Street, and rented homes at 517 and 211 Prince Street. But he was always a well-respected member of the community, and was elected Mayor of Alexandria, serving from 1804 to 1805. He died in 1825 and is buried at the Quaker Burial Ground, now the site of the Alexandria Library Barrett Branch on Queen Street. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/03151762ElishaCullenDick.png Portrait of Dr. Elisha Cullen Dick. 03/17 1856 Alexandria Steam Ferry Company On March 17, 1856, the Virginia General Assembly passed legislation authorizing the Alexandria Steam Ferry Company.

The shoe had been bronzed, decorated with gold cord and the handsome picture of a locomotive, and lined with blue velvet to serve as a card receiver for the sentiments of well-wishers. Although Mr. Brown’s spinal injuries were at first considered incurable, with surgery and recuperation at St. Luke’s Home in Richmond for over two years, he was finally able to walk without a cane and declared completely cured when he returned home to Alexandria in January 1887. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/03191887Card.jpg Greeting card. 03/19 1936 King Street Storms, flood From March 15-20, 1936, the Eastern half of the United States was bombarded by four separate storms, all of which impacted Alexandria with record amounts of rainfall and melting snow causing massive flooding in the Potomac River. The weather had been unseasonably warm earlier in the month with heavier than usual rainfall that, though not a threat, caused the ground to become saturated. Then a sudden cold snap caused a heavy snowfall, followed by five days of near constant rain. As one storm passed, a new one emerged causing both polar and tropical fronts to pass over the city from all directions, with the last storm remaining stationary over the region with hours of torrential rain. By March 19, at 4:45 p.m., the Potomac reached its peak of level of 28.1 feet, isolating Alexandria for days and putting the nearby Washington Airport almost completely underwater. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/03221903FloodedKingSt.jpg Flooding at the foot of King Street. 03/21 1813 Secretary of War James Armstrong, British invasion, War of 1812, President James Madison On March 21, 1813, a group of representatives from Alexandria met with Secretary of War James Armstrong in Washington requesting that arms be provided to protect the southern approaches to the nation’s capital from a possible British invasion during the War of 1812. Although newly appointed to the post by President James Madison, Armstrong was convinced that enemy forces would not attack the city, and he took few steps to support the Alexandria appeal, even after Alexandria’s Common Council lent the federal government $35,000, obtained through bank loans, to improve fortifications and defenses southward along the Potomac. A year and a half later, after the burning of Washington and surrender of Alexandria to the enemy, Armstrong was forced to resign. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/03211813JamesArmstrongRembrandtPeale.jpg James Armstrong, portrait by Rembrandt Peale. 03/22 1903 200-400 blocks South Royal Streets Flood On March 22, 1903, heavy rains and winds caused some local streets to become flooded.

The development of pet vaccines had only begun a couple of years earlier and few municipalities had yet accepted that responsibility. But with a large number of dogs in the city, many roaming freely, officials acted quickly to curb a potential public health menace. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/03241925DogVaccinations.jpg Dog vaccinations. 03/25 1844 201 South Washington Street The Lyceum African Colonization Society, Liberia, Quakers, abolitionists, slaveholders On March 25, 1844 a meeting of the African Colonization Society was held at The Lyceum. Known formally as The Society for the Colonization of Free People of Color of America, an organization that supported the resettlement of free blacks in American back to Africa. Founded in 1816, the group helped to create the including the colony of Liberia, established in 1821. Ironically, members of the ACS represented two diametrically opposed constituencies; Quakers, evangelicals and other abolitionists that opposed slavery, and ardent slaveholders in the Chesapeake region that fought against regulated abolition but saw free blacks as a potential threat to the institution of slavery that could incite slave rebellions. Both groups viewed “repatriation” to Africa as the best option available to support their cause during the 19th century decades before the Civil War. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/03251844LiberiaMap.jpg Map of Liberia. 03/26 1839 201 South Washington Street The Lyceum Alexandria Lyceum Company, Alexandria Library Company On March 26, 1839, the Alexandria Lyceum Company and the Alexandria Library Company formally announced plans to join together in sharing a new Greek Revival-style building at 201 S. Washington Street. Alexandria’s Lyceum was modeled after the American lyceum (ly-SEE-um) movement which began in the 1820s with Josiah Holbrook, who admired various institutions in England that had been established for public education. While still a novel concept in the United States at that time, public education was rapidly gaining support through the efforts of men like Josiah Holbrook and Horace Mann.\n\nIn 1826, the first American lyceum opened in Milbury, Massachusetts, and the rocky soil of New England proved to be very fertile ground for this endeavor. Soon there were lyceums throughout the region, which benefited from numerous cities and towns as well as good transportation systems for both traveling lecturers and their listeners.\n\nThe situation was different in the South, however, where a more dispersed populace and a tradition of private schooling were among the obstacles to attracting audiences to the few early lyceums. Only in the cities did southern lyceum organizers meet with much success. In 1838, a Quaker teacher named Benjamin Hallowell and six other prominent Alexandrians formed The Alexandria Lyceum and began to offer a series of lectures and debates on a variety of topics. Typically held in Hallowell's school, the lectures most often concerned biology and philosophy, subjects which never failed to engage Alexandrians at this period. Discussions of politics and religion were expressly barred, since they frequently led to heated arguments. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/03021867LyceumCivilWar.jpg The Lyceum during the Civil War.

During the last week of March in that year, the Alexandria Amusement Co. at 426 King Street featured The New Passion Play, a one-hour film priced at 10 cents with live religious music. A block away, at the large Opera House on the corner of King & Pitt Streets, The Metropolitan Moving Picture Company featured changing one-hour “pantomimes ... of a high order,” with live singing for just five cents. On March 31, the City Engineer served an order to the Elks Club to stop work on a wood frame motion picture screen being constructed at their Prince Street site without a permit. In response, a number of City Councilmen quickly vowed to sign a paper authorizing the work to continue. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/03311908LannonOperaHouseLOC.jpg Lannon’s Opera House.

Lee, Amistad, slavery, abolition On March 31, 1841, former President John Quincy Adams visited his old friend, Edmund J. Lee, who lived at the famous “Lee Corner” at North Washington and Oronoco Streets. The visit occurred just weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court decision was announced in the famous Amistad case, which concerned an 1839 shipboard mutiny by captured Africans that occurred off the coast of Cuba. Intent on returning to Africa, the ship was later intercepted by U.S. officials off of Long Island, New York, and those escaping slavery were put on trial for killing the ship’s captain and cook, and seizing the Spanish owned vessel.\n\nAdams, who vehemently opposed slavery, was asked to represent the Africans on trial by abolitionist Lewis Tappan, and spoke before the Court for four hours straight in their defense. His arguments were successful, and the mutineers were ordered free and returned to their homeland by the Court decision. Decades before the Civil War began, Adams accurately predicted that, if not abolished, the evolving divide between the Northern and Southern states over the institution of slavery would ultimately tear the United States apart. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/03311841JQAdams.png John Quincy Adams. Daguerreotype, Philip Haas 1843. 04/01 1862 Winslow Homer, Civil War, Peninsula Campaign, Major General George McLellan, Harper's Weekly On April 1, 1862, the noted American landscape painted Winslow Homer was in Alexandria, sketching Union soldiers leaving the city for Fort Monroe as part of Major General George McClellan’s “Peninsula Campaign.” The drawing depicts “General McClellan's Sixth Pennsylvania Cavalry Regiment Ready to Embark at Alexandria for Old Point Comfort.” A native of Boston, Homer was first taught painting by his mother, but in 1859 the 23-year-old artist moved to New York City where he established a studio and attended art classes at the National Academy of design. His progress as an artist and illustrator was rapid and in 1861 Harper’s magazine sent him to Virginia to produce illustrations of the Civil War. He accompanied the Union Army units for about two months, sailing down the Potomac from Alexandria to Fort Monroe and Yorktown in the Tidewater region. His sketch of the Pennsylvania soldiers in Alexandria helped introduce his artistic style and flair for the dramatic. His work in Virginia covering McClellan and his forces as they moved towards Richmond proved to be very significant in developing a foundation for his artist style, and laid the groundwork for his true artistic transition from illustrator to painter. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/04011862Homer6thCavalry.jpg General McClellan's Sixth Pennsylvania Cavalry Regiment Ready to Embark at Alexandria for Old Point Comfort, by Winslow Homer.

The Convention began its work on February 13 of that year, nine days after seven southern states seceded to create the Confederacy. Alexandria’s chosen representative, Unionist George Brent, originally voted against secession, but changed his vote after the attack on Fort Sumter, and President Lincoln’s response calling for troops to be assembled from all states. Ultimately, Alexandria citizens voted 9 to 1 in support in of Virginia’s secession. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/04041861GeorgeBrent.jpg George Brent.

Martin’s spectacular production of “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” took place at the Opera House on the southwest corner of King and South Pitt Streets. The “mammoth” theatrical presentation, as opposed to C.H. Smith’s competing “double mammoth” production of the same play, was on tour after a successful run in New York City the previous winter. The cast and crew came to Alexandria on its own specially-built train, complete with scenery, costumes, and a host of live animals including horses, burros, donkeys, Shetland ponies and bloodhounds. Although Martin claimed his show was “America’s foremost production of the greatest book ever written,” describing it in advertisements as “mammoth,” a competitor, C. H. Smith, described his production of the same play as “double mammoth” on similar posters. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/04041901MartinUncleTomsCabinPoster.jpg Poster for A. W.

Police Officers Benjamin Franklin “Frank” Bettis and Herbert Knight had quickly arrested a young man the night before, who had fired a pistol near Royal and Princess Streets. Faced with this one issue in the Mayor’s courtroom the next morning, and with only three other “lodgers” at the Police station house overnight, the Mayor noted “. . . there is less violation of laws than ever before in the history of the Town.” The pistol-toting man was fined $10 and his gun confiscated. Later that morning, Officer Knight saw even more action when he killed a mad dog on South Fairfax Street. Although not technically on duty, the officer nevertheless responded to the alarm. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/04061900Bettis.jpg Benjamin Franklin Bettis, Alexandria Police Department. 04/07 1846 301 King Street City Hall Market House Museum, Masonic Lodge, Lafayette On April 7. 1846 the City of Alexandria authorized the first paid curator at the Market House Museum, then located in the second City Hall building which faced North Royal Street. Originally established in 1812, in conjunction with Alexandria’s Masonic Lodge which leased the space in the northwest second floor corner of the building, the museum was often the site of major events, including a festive reception for the Marquis de Lafayette when he visited Alexandria for a month in 1824. Originally, museum artifacts relating mostly to George Washington were placed decades before by the local Masonic Lodge, of which the nation’s first President was a member. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/04071846OldDrawingCityHall.jpg Drawing of the old Alexandria City Hall. 04/07 1950 717 Queen Street Barrett Library Microfilm, Alexandria Gazette, Alexandria Library Special Collections On April 7, 1950, the Alexandria Gazette announced that the Library of Congress had completed microfilming its old issues.

Lee, Fall of Richmond, Civil War When news of the fall of the Confederate capital at Richmond reached Alexandria during the first week of April 1865, days before the surrender of Robert E, Lee’s forces at Appomattox, the grim city immediately took on a festive air. The first sign was the tolling of church bells throughout the downtown, and later the firing of victory rounds at local fortifications as a salute by Union soldiers. The celebration by Union forces and those loyal to their cause lasted several days, with parades spontaneously occurring on main thoroughfares and constant noise making of citizens by blowing horns and whistles. American flags sprouted from many homes and businesses, and those structures that did not display “Old Glory’ were subject to vandalism and public scorn.\n\nIt was the darkest of times for Alexandrians that supported the Confederate cause, as they remained hidden in their homes, praying for some miracle that might yet emerge in the final days of the war. But when Lee’s surrender at Appomattox finally occurred on April 9, all hope was lost. But in their defeat they were at least comforted by the end of the conflict, and the new opportunities that lay ahead for their city.\n\n/uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/05041869RELee1867.jpg Robert E.

On April 10 of that year, it was reported that Mr. John Travers of South Henry Street had the most unusual output of all. One of his hens had laid a huge “triplicate” egg, the size of a goose egg that, when opened revealed three distinct eggs inside. The event was described locally as just “another lusus naturae,” meaning “freak of nature.” /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/04101907ThreeEggYolks.jpg Three egg yolks. 08/11 1885 Alexandria Light Infantry, President Ulysses S.

The new industrial facility opened its doors just in time to be featured on page 102 of Chataigne’s Alexandria City Directory, that also included several other listings outlining the extensive business interests of the Leatherland family in the city during the last quarter of the 19th century. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/04131876Leatherland.PNG Chataigne's Alexandria City Directory, 1876. 04/13 1943 Annexation, Fairfax County, swine, housing On April 13, 1943, nearly ten years before the City of Alexandria annexed rural land from Fairfax County west of North Quaker lane, City Council passed an ordinance prohibiting the keeping of swine within the city boundaries. Development to house federal workers and military personnel associated with the war effort, included in-fill housing downtown and suburban developments on the city’s second “West End” between North Quaker Lane and Del Ray, quickly eliminated public tolerance of livestock and agricultural pursuits in the rapidly growing city. 04/14 1865 Civil War, Abraham Lincoln, assassination, John Wilkes Booth On Friday, April 14, 1865, a procession of Union troops fourteen blocks long paraded through Alexandria to mark the anniversary of the start of the Civil War and the renewed Union control of Fort Sumter, the South Carolina fortification where the war had begun just four years earlier. But by the very next morning, Alexandrians were stunned to hear rumors of the shooting of President Lincoln the evening before, and then confirmation of his death by Dr. David P. Smith, the surgeon in charge, when he returned to Alexandria early that morning. With the escape of assassin John Wilkes Booth, and fearing a larger conspiracy, guards were immediately posted at all entry points to Alexandria preventing any passage to civilians. That evening a citizen meeting developed plans for a period of mourning, including the closing of all businesses, placement of black crepe on homes and public buildings, and the tolling of bells throughout the City. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/04141865LincolnMourningRibbon.jpg Mourning Ribbon. 04/15 1791 Jones Point Jones Point Boundary stone, Alexandria Masonic Lodge, District of Columbia On April 15, 1791, the first boundary stone of the District of Columbia was laid at Jones Point in Alexandria.

Then only nine-years-old and born in Bridgeport, CT with the name Charles Sherwood Stratton, the youngster was advertised by circus showman P.T. Barnum as much older, and brought from Europe “at great expense.” Measuring only 25 inches tall and weighing only 15 pounds, “The Man in Miniature” performed comical acts based on Napoleon Bonaparte, a Scottish Highlander, and other characters as part of his routine. After appearing in Alexandria, he performed in Richmond the same week. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/04151847TomThumb.jpg Tom Thumb and P.T. Barnum. Daguerreotype by Samuel Root, c. 1850.

Over a dozen private businesses provided teams and carts to supplement City crews in the clean-up effort. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/04151910CleanupDayBrickWagon.jpg Alexandria Brick Co. wagon.

Davis, slavery, plaster mill, Alexandria National Cemetery, Grand Army of the Republic, GAR On April 21, 1893, Alexandrians were saddened to learn of the death the evening before of George Carroll, a well-known and affable African American who had served in the Union Army during the Civil War. Before the war, Carroll had served as a slave in the home of Josiah H. Davis and as a boy, had worked at the old plaster mill on the waterfront between Prince and Duke Streets. He was described as a sort of sui generis, a one-of-a-kind individual who walked about the City in singular fashion, wearing a battered stovepipe hat pulled down over one eye, with hands in pockets.\n\nCarroll was a member of Alexandria’s Sumner Post, Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), a fraternal organization of nearly 400,000 Union Army veterans by 1890, which advocated for pensions for veterans, voting rights for black veterans and advancement of advocacy groups in American politics. Carroll was buried in the Soldier’s Cemetery with Father Kenefick of St. Mary’s R.C. Church officiating, and members of the Sumner Post GAR committing his body to the grave.\n\n/uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/04211893NationalCemetery.jpg Alexandria National Cemetery, 1860s.

Excavation for clay to make bricks took place on land that is now the Hunting Point apartment complex, and on property adjacent to the Freedmen’s Cemetery. Within two years, on March 29, 1892, an article in the Washington Post commented that the excavations within the brickyard had undermined the cemetery grounds to the point that coffins were sticking out of a hillside “like cannon from the embrasures of some great fort.” At the time, a brickworks employee commented to the news reporter that, “The bricks from that clay will be good to build haunted houses with.” This newspaper article led Alexandria Historian T. Michael Miller to discover the existence of the long-forgotten burial place for African American Contrabands and Freedmen, and to the subsequent memorial that opened on the site in 2015. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/04221890AlexBrickCoWagon.jpg Alexandria Brick Co. wagon.

Robinson, Roberts Memorial United Methodist Church On April 24, 1940, the Robert Robinson Library opened its doors to the African American community, just eight months after one of America's first “sit-in” demonstrations took place at the segregated Alexandria Library on Queen Street. The library was named after Robert H. Robinson, a former slave who became a pastor at a church on South Washington Street known today as Roberts Memorial United Methodist Church. The old Robinson Library building now houses the Alexandria Black History Museum. The present-day Barrett Branch Library, originally called Alexandria Library, was built as a public facility in 1937 but was only available to whites. In response to this inequality, young attorney Samuel Tucker prepared a select group of African American men for a deliberate act of civil disobedience. On Friday, August 21, 1939, patrons and staff at the library were shocked when several young African American men entered the building, took a seat, and began to read quietly. Police were called and the men soon found themselves charged with disorderly conduct. Tucker’s defense of the men planned to legally challenge the city on the grounds that all citizens were entitled to equal access to public facilities and services. However, the city government quickly negotiated a settlement with other leaders of the city’s African American community to construct a “separate but equal” library in the Parker-Gray neighborhood. Furious, Tucker refused to accept a card at the new “separate but equal” library, insisting that people of color be allowed to use any public facilities and resources paid for with their tax dollars. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/04241940RobinsonLibraryInterior.jpg Story time at Robert Robinson Library.

At the time, Alexandria was the county seat of Fairfax County and the move consolidated government operations at that strategic corner, making it the most important intersection in Northern Virginia. The court would remain in the Alexandria government center on the north side of Market Square for over two centuries, first for the County of Fairfax and later for the City of Alexandria. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/05111749Map1749.jpg “A Plan of Alexandria now Belhaven,” George Washington, 1749.

Construction on the monument proceeded apace until 1854, when it was stopped due to lack of funds and control of the Washington National Monument Society, and later the Civil War. Construction resumed in 1877 with the final completion in 1885. By that time, the colonnade was eliminated from the original design, and the flat top of the column was replaced by a pyramidion. The pause in construction is clearly visible by a change in stone color at the 152’ height, with Alexandria’s stone in the lower portion. At just under 555 feet, the structure surpassed the Cologne cathedral in height, and became the world’s tallest man-made structure until the Eiffel Tower was built in 1889. However, the Washington Monument remains its titles as both the tallest obelisk and tallest stone structure in the world. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/04271850WashingtonMonumentSketch.jpg Sketch of proposed plan for the Washington Monument, Robert Mills 1836. 04/27 1861 Civil War, naval blockade On April 27, 1861, just twelve days after the fall of Fort Sumter and four days after Virginia's decision to schedule a public vote on secession, President Abraham Lincoln ordered that a Naval blockade on Southern ports be extended along the coastlines of North Carolina and Virginia to prevent the Confederacy from importing weapons and other war materials from foreign governments and preventing the export of cotton and saleable goods that would provide financial resources to enrich the South's war-making machine. As seen in this 1861 political cartoon, the snakelike blockade reached right up the Potomac, past Alexandria's waterfront, with the tail of the snake curling tight at Washington, D.C.\n\n/uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/04271861NavalBlockade.jpg Political cartoon, 1861.

After the Civil War, Lee rejected the calls for a sustained insurgency against Northern forces, and promoted the reunification of the country as one. He accepted a post as President of Washington College in Lexington, Virginia (now Washington and Lee University) where he used his pulpit to espouse unification. He encouraged Northern men to attend the school, where they were welcomed as “gentlemen.” As the years went by, his popularity in the North grew, and President Ulysses S. Grant even invited him to the White House in 1869, a visit that culminated in a rare sojourn to his former hometown. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/05041869RELee1867.jpg Robert E.

The Orange and Alexandria Railroad was chartered by the Virginia General Assembly in 1848, to run between Alexandria to Gordonsville, Virginia, and connected with several other railroads at Manassas Junction, allowing travel in virtually every direction through the state. During the 1850’s the railroad was a force for great commerce, shipping agricultural produce and goods through the state, and from Virginia to other markets, faster and less expensive than ever before. By 1861 however, as a result of its strategic location and multiple connections, the O & A became a major prize of both Union and Confederate forces who continually fought over its control during the Civil War. As the sole rail link between Washington, D.C. and Richmond, control of the O & A was critical to each side’s pursuit of victory in the four-year conflict. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/05061851WilkesStTunnel.jpg The Wilkes Street Tunnel, 1860s.

Although not officially called an Inaugural Ball, the event served as a model for the tradition that actually began a decade later after the election of James Madison. Washington attended the event without his wife, Martha, who was attending to last-minute arrangements at Mount Vernon before the trip to New York to join her husband. But Washington graced the dance floor with prominent ladies of New York society, prompting Mrs. Alexander Hamilton to comment on his grace and dignity while performing the minuet.

This first year of Madison’s presidency was a prosperous time for America, and for Alexandria as well. At the time of his inauguration, the new nation had a financial surplus of $9,500,000, and in Alexandria new highways were constructed to connect with northward to Washington, and southward across Hunting Creek towards Richmond, which eventually became part of US Route 1. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/05091809MadisonOath.jpg James Madison, President of the United States.

Lewis, President of the United Mine Workers, called a nationwide strike of soft coal mine workers nationwide, seeking increased wages, a new welfare fund, and improvements in sanitary and safety conditions at American mines. The strike was successful, and was settled within three weeks as the nation’s coal supply dwindled to record lows, causing damage to the nation’s economy. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/05091946JohnLewisCartoon.jpg \"Quite a Successful Strike.\" Herbert Block, Library of Congress. 05/11 1749 Virginia Assembly, Governor William Gooch, Philip Alexander, John Alexander, George Washington, auction of lots On May 11, 1749, colonial Governor William Gooch designated sixty acres of land adjacent to a small bay along the Potomac River in Northern Virginia as the site for a new settlement to be called Alexandria. Several theories support the naming for the new settlement;\n\n• that it was named for Philip and John Alexander who formerly owned the land; or\n\n• that the name was selected after Alexandria, Egypt a center of knowledge in the early civilized world; or\n\n• that the name was taken from the tiny town of Alexandria, Scotland, known to the Scottish founders that proposed the site; or\n\n• all of the above.\n\nAn auction of 84 half-acre lots was scheduled for July 14 that same year, with a deadline of two years for successful lot purchasers to erect a structure on the property. Two lots were set aside at the center of the new community for a market place and town hall/courthouse. A seventeen-year-old assistant surveyor, George Washington prepared a map of the new town, including the names of the gridded streets, most of which are still used today. In the 17th century, plantations could be found along the Potomac River in Northern Virginia. By 1732, Hugh West had established a tobacco warehouse on high bluffs overlooking a small but deep bay, at what is today the foot of Oronoco Street in Alexandria. The Tobacco Inspection Act of 1730, one of the most successful laws promoted by colonial Governor William Gooch designated West's warehouse as the official inspection point for this area. The creation of such stations in the colony reduced fraud and affirmed the high quality of Virginia tobacco, thus allowing it to become a premium product for European trade. Hugh West oversaw the warehouse along with a ferry and tavern, while Philip and John Alexander farmed much of the surrounding land. To facilitate shipping, Scottish and English merchants petitioned the Virginia General Assembly in the fall of 1748 to establish a town at West's Hunting Creek Warehouse. After some debate that considered a competing location along Cameron Run, on May 11, 1749, Sir William Gooch, Colonial Governor of Virginia designated 60 acres of land surrounding West’s tobacco station for the founding of Alexandria. John West, Fairfax County surveyor, assisted by 17-year-old George Washington, laid out 60 acres for creation of the new town and lots were auctioned off in July 1749. /uploadedImages/historic/info/ThisDay/05111749Map1749.jpg “A Plan of Alexandria now Belhaven,” George Washington, 1749.
