Determine the widest portion of your head, typically starting just above the eyebrows and in the rear, you may feel a slight knot on the back of your skull.\n\ntip\n\nNo soft tape measure? Simply cut a 30” piece of string and grab a yard stick.\n\nUsing a mirror, place the tape so that centimeters are visible starting at the front and wrap it comfortably around your head covering the widest portion until it overlaps above the eyebrows and ears.\n\ntip\n\nIf using a string method, follow the steps above. Mark on the string where it overlaps so that you can lay it down against the yard stick to determine the length in inches.\n\nYou should be left with a measurement between 52 & 63 centimeters. Use our provided conversion chart below to determine your appropriate hat size. Enjoy.\n\ntip\n\nIt’s always good to measure a few times to ensure that you achieve a consistent result."
