Lloyd.\n\nHoward Stevenson McDonald died on October 25, 1986. He was 92 years of age. Dr. McDonald was an educator all of his life, serving as a coach, teacher, and administrator in the public schools and as a university and college president. His other great interest was his devoted service throughout his life to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nWhen Dr. McDonald arrived in the summer of 1949 to assume the presidency of Los Angeles State College, and to serve also as the head of Los Angeles City (Junior) College, he found a fledgling state college sadly in need of organization and development. Since the college had opened in September, 1947, with 136 students, it had grown in two years to over 2,000 students. Most were studying under the GI Bill, which had been largely responsible for establishment of the college. Upper division classes were being taught in borrowed spaces on the City College campus by mostly part-time faculty recruited from other institutions of higher education in the Los Angeles area and any other source where qualified instructors could be found. When Dr. McDonald retired in 1962, Los Angeles State College of Applied Arts and Sciences, as it be-came known in 1949, had its own permanent site, on which seven major academic buildings had been built and an eighth structure (North Hall, later named King Hall) was nearing completion. The college had a full-time faculty of about 700, a student enrollment approaching 16,000, and an annual graduating class of al-most 3,000 bachelor's and master's degree recipients.\n\nDuring his first year as president, Dr. McDonald put together a small team of administrators to help him build the college. To head this team, he brought in Dr. Albert Graves as Dean of Instruction, to build a permanent teaching faculty and put together an under-graduate and graduate curriculum; Dr. Morton Renshaw as Dean of Student Personnel, to handle admissions and registration; and Dr. Asael Lambert as Executive Dean, to work on finding a site and erecting buildings for a permanent campus for the burgeoning college.\n\nAs was his wont, Dr. McDonald kept fully involved in all phases of development of the new college. One of the traits for which he was well known was the dis-patch with which he sorted his incoming mail each day and routed it on to others to handle, so that he could get out of his office, and observe at first-hand what was going on about the campus. He moved in rapid strides, dropping in offices and even visiting class-rooms, putting together his own assessment of what was taking place on his campus.\n\nOne of his more difficult tasks, which he enjoyed telling about after the decision was reached, was his search for a campus site. He told of the many sites, somewhere between 27 and 50, that he checked out. He enjoyed telling how some influential supporters of USC opposed his selection of a piece of land in Baldwin Hills, and how the then Los Angeles Mayor Poulson ran him out of Chavez Ravine so that he could lure the Dodger baseball team to Los Angeles.\n\nComplicating the selection of the site was a requirement of the State Legislature that the college be located within the city limits of Los Angeles. Finally, the decision was made when a parcel of land owned by the State Highway Department was found on the eastern border of the City of Los Angeles. It was not the best of sites, but it was available and would have to do. Time had run out for the search.\n\nAlmost as difficult as finding a permanent site for the College was the task of recruiting 50 to 100 new faculty members every year. The GI Bill helped, as servicemen used their benefits to earn advanced college degrees. Los Angeles State recruited heavily from the graduate schools at USC and UCLA, but the numbers available did not fill their needs. Dr. McDonald took part in faculty recruitment, as he and Dean Graves took trips across the United States to interview prospective faculty members on university campuses.\n\nAnother activity in which President McDonald engaged with his usual vigor and determination were trips to Sacramento with Business Manager Jack Heppe and Dean Lambert, to plead the College's needs. There were visits to the State Department of Education, under whose administrative authority the College operated, and to the State Legislature to argue for increased funds for the operating budget and allotments of capital funds for building the new campus. There were many meetings with the State Architect's Office, which was charged by law with the job of de-signing the College's buildings.\n\nThose 13 years that Dr. McDonald served as president were certainly the formative years of Los Angeles State College. Ever the active, dynamic person, he was faced almost daily with demands for quick decisions which would impact upon the future of the college. Many were not the decisions that he wanted to make, but expediency demanded action. After all, the college was adding 1,000 or more students each year, and there had to be additional faculty and classrooms.\n\nIn 13 years Dr. McDonald, aided by his own hand-picked team of helpers, had created a college which was attracting nationwide attention as a model of an institution of higher education with a strong urban focus. It was destined to continue to grow and expand academically into university status. Today, California State University, Los Angeles stands as a monument to the dedicated efforts of Howard S. McDonald.\n\nThe Emeritimes, January 1987\n\nELLIOTT W. GUILD, member of the faculty at Cal State L.A. from 1949 to 1961, died in a Santa Clara hospital on February 6, 1987.

Catharine was born in Kirksville, MO, in 1912. She attended UC Berkeley and finished her BFA at USC, where she also earned an MFA in Graphics in 1950. She first came to Cal State in 1968 as a part-timer and joined full-time faculty in 1970. Cathy and her husband, Lenny, were extremely fond of the American Southwest and the Near East. They traveled throughout these areas and Mexico. She became particularly noted for her Southwest landscapes and her depictions of little known architectural antiquities from Turkey and the Balkan countries. While teaching at Cal State, Cathy was active in art and philosophy associations. She helped establish a Los Angeles chapter of Artists Equity. For three years prior to retirement she was a partner in NuMasters Art Gallery in Alhambra, which focused on prints and folk art. Cathy moved to Taos following her husband's death and, true to her nature, immediately became involved in community affairs. She started a Taos chapter of Artists Equity and initiated a local radio program about art. She spent some part of each winter working in the Yucatan.\n\nThe Emeritimes, Fall 1992\n\nERNEST R. KAMM, Professor of Criminal Justice, who started teaching in 1961 at what was at the time Los Angeles State College, died suddenly in May 1992 of a heart ailment. During his long tenure at California State University, Los Angeles, he was instrumental in the development of the Department of Police Science into the Department of Criminal Justice, and at the same time taking on responsibilities in all areas of University life. When he started teaching at Cal State he was Los Angeles County Deputy Probation Officer, a position that he left to become a full-time member of the faculty. Over the years Ernest played a leadership role in the area of curriculum development. While Chair from 1969 to 1980, he guided his department's growth and the modification and changes in the program and course offerings necessary to meet the needs of the criminal justice community. He was highly regarded as a teacher and as an administrator. In the latter role he strove to recruit highly qualified faculty, not only to teach the fundamentals of the discipline but also for the increasingly important areas relating to the forensic subjects in the department's program. Professor Kamm's professional stature was such that in 1987 he was appointed by Governor Deukmejian as the Governor's representative and trustee to the Presley Institute, an advisory body that oversees the functions of many activities, including those of criminal justice. From 1985 to 1990 he served on the Professional Advisement Committee to the Los Angeles Police Department. From 1970 to 1990 he was an active member of the reserve component of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, retiring with the rank of Reserve Captain. At the University his contributions were numerous. He served on every department and school committee and on major University committees. Recently he had served as Director of the Center for Criminal Justice Studies and continued to be involved in this area up to the time of his death. He is survived by his wife Shirley.\n\nThe Emeritimes, Fall 1992\n\nJOHN C. NORBY, Professor of Economics, who came to California State College when it was located on Vermont Avenue, passed away at his home in Langley on Whidbey Island, WA, on July 3, 1992 of lung cancer. John was born in Spokane in 1913 and married Isabel S. Clemen in 1939. His early college work was done in Washington. He obtained a B.A. in Education at Eastern Washington College of Education in 1936, then a B.S. in Zoology in 1939 from the University of Washington and taught this in high schools. He turned to Economics after World War II, earning an M.A. in 1948 and completing the Ph.D. in 1953, both from the University of Minnesota. In 1950, when John arrived at Los Angeles State College, it was a fledgling institution, its schools and departments just being formed. The areas of Business and Economics were being developed by Floyd R. Simpson, who had arrived two years earlier. John and Leonard Mathy formed the nucleus of the Department of Economics and were instrumental in establishing its curriculum and its character. John served as department chair from 1964 to 1969 and was a member of the College Foundation Board of Trustees in 1970. Very skillful in personnel matters, John was sensitive to the needs of faculty that are necessary for the success of a department; he always tried to \"sweeten the pot\" (a favorite expression) for all concerned. He and Professor Don Moore carried out feasibility studies on savings and loan associations which were presented to the Savings and Loan Commission. In 1975 John took early retirement, and the Norbys settled in Langley, where in the ensuing years they became involved in many community projects. They helped in the development of the Langley Library and worked with the South Langley Good Cheer Thrift Shop. John served in the Volunteer Fire Department and was a member of the Useless Bay Golf and Country Club (this led to his often remarking to friends that he was thinking of starting a University there: Useless U!). Surviving are Isabel, his wife of 50 years, two sons, three daughters and eight grandchildren. Memorial services were held in Langley.\n\nThe Emeritimes, Fall 1992\n\nBURTON HENRY, Emeritus Professor of Education, succumbed to cancer of the pancreas in May 1992, according to a message received recently from his wife, Lucille. The Henrys had lived in Temecula, CA, for most of their years of retirement. Burt joined the School of Education faculty in 1952 and retired in 1979. He received his B.A. degree at Harvard and his M.Ed. and Ph.D. degrees from USC. He was a person of tremendous energy, leaving his mark at the University in such diverse areas as scholarship, community relations and athletics. His work in urban education inspired students to work in inner city schools, especially during the era of the \"Watts Riots.\" The Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations gave Burt their Outstanding Citizens Award.\n\nThe Emeritimes, Fall 1992\n\nVERNON L. KIKER, JR., Emeritus Professor of Psychology, a recent addition to the ranks of Emeriti Professors, died in his sleep on August 3, 1992 after a long illness. He retired in the Fall of 1991, after almost 30 years at the University. Dr. Kiker came to Cal State L.A. in 1962, a year after completing his Ph.D. in Psychology at Ohio State University. Born in Wetumka, OK, in 1926, he did his prior college work at Oklahoma State University, where he earned a B.S. in 1948 and an M.S. in 1954. Professor Kiker taught a broad range of subjects during his extended tenure on faculty. One of his teaching strengths was the identification and preparation of potential graduate students. His research interests included the History of Psychology. He authored, presented at professional meetings, and published a number of papers. Vernon served on dozens of committees and was a faculty advisor to undergraduate and graduate students. He involved students in his research and contributed both time and money to upgrading equipment for their use. A memorial service was held on August 6, after which his body was flown to Oklahoma for internment.\n\nThe Emeritimes, Fall 1992\n\nFRED H. MARCUS, Professor of English, came to California State University in 1955. He received his Ph.D. degree from New York University. Although he retired from Cal State in 1985, he continued to teach as part of the Faculty Early Retirement Program until his death recently (Ed.: 1992). Fred was highly regarded as a teacher, having received an Outstanding Professor Award in 1968. He developed and taught courses on film, such as \"The English Novel on Film\" and \"Analyzing Children's Films,\" and \"Short Stories Adapted to Short Film.\" He also taught literature and writing courses. His film courses were highly regarded, and he was instrumental in establishing these courses as a part of the General Education Program. Professor Marcus presented many papers and lectures, and published a number of articles dealing with, among others, Hawthorne, Hemingway, Salinger, Paton and Gaines. But his primary contributions related to film, the relationship between literature and film, and its uses in the classroom. He either wrote or edited numerous books and also served as a consultant on many films. During his long tenure at Cal State, Fred served on dozens of committees at all levels and was a member of the Academic Senate. Among the administrative positions he held were Director of Curriculum Planning, Acting Vice President for Academic Affairs, and Head of Project Head Start at Cal State L.A. He is survived by two sons; his wife passed away several years ago.\n\nThe Emeritimes, Fall 1992\n\nJOHN A. GREENLEEwas born in Richland, Iowa, on Sept. 7, 1911, the only child of Martha and John Greenlee. After graduating from high school at 15, he attended Parsons College for two years, then transferred to the University of Iowa where he received a bachelor's degree in 1930, a master's in 1931, and a Ph.D. in 1934. While engaged in postdoctoral study at the Universities of Chicago, Iowa, and California during summers, he also was a social science instructor, high school principal and community college dean in Emmetsburg, Iowa, from 1934 to 1940. In 1940, he joined the faculty of Iowa State College and spent 19 years as an administrator and teacher of government and history. (He took three years off during World War II to serve as an officer in the U.S. Navy, for which he was awarded a Bronze Star.) He left Iowa State in 1959 to become Director of Personnel and Training for Engineers at Collins Radio Co. in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. From there he came to Cal State L.A. in 1965 as Vice President of Academic Affairs. He became President of the University in 1966 and served until his retirement in 1979. A member of numerous national organizations and national honor societies, including Phi Kappa Phi, Phi Delta Kappa, Alpha Kappa Psi, and Beta Gamma Sigma, he was listed in Who's Who in America and was a member of the U.S Naval Reserve, from which he retired as a Commander. After retiring from Cal State L.A., he was a consultant in higher education and also assisted in the establishment of Lutheran-sponsored Christ College in Irvine, CA, which conferred upon him an honorary LI.D. He was 81 years of age at the time of his death on Nov. 23, 1992. He is survived by his widow, Lillian, whom he married in 1955. Mrs. Greenlee continues to reside in South Pasadena, where the couple had made their home since coming to California in 1965.\n\nThe Emeritimes, Winter 1993\n\nJOHN ALDEN GREENLEE, President of the University, 1966-1979 - A Tribute by Bill Lloyd.\n\nThere is a postulate offered by some political scientists that the people of a democracy will select persons best qualified to lead them at any given time. If there be truth in this idea, and if it can be applied to the selection of a college president, the choice of John A. Greenlee as President of California State College at Los Angeles in 1966 could be cited as supporting evidence of that idea. John Greenlee came to Cal State L.A. in Fall 1965 as Vice President of Academic Affairs. The College, then in its 18th year, was still growing, with a student body of 15,000 that was increasing at an average rate of 1,000 students per year. In the area of academic affairs, it was a time of ongoing, nationwide searches for new faculty members, added classes in almost every discipline, and new courses and degree programs. The campus had outgrown its new physical facilities, and the shortage of adequate parking spaces had become a major problem. Immediately upon taking office, Vice President Greenlee became involved in converting the campus to year-round operation and adopting the curriculum from the semester system to the quarter system. The entire faculty and many staff employees were involved in this major undertaking. All of this major academic restructuring meant that the new vice president received an immediate, in-depth indoctrination into the academic affairs of the College and was able to contribute a few ideas of his own. But his full-time involvement in academic affairs, which he was to say later represented his most enjoyable times at Cal State L.A., came to an end prematurely when then-President Franklyn Johnson suddenly resigned late in the year. Dr. Greenlee was appointed Acting President but fully expected to return to his post as vice president by Fall 1966. However, the Trustees of the CSU selected him as the new president, although he reportedly had not applied for the position, and he accepted. In his 13 years (1966-79) as President, Dr. Greenlee led the campus through a second major phase of maturation. During his first year as President, the conversion to the quarter system and year-round operation were completed, a task that involved winning a budget-cutting battle with the state legislature and the governor, in which he enlisted student help in getting adequate budgetary support to accomplish the conversion. Early on, Dr. Greenlee began what he described as an \"urban thrust\" for the campus, in which he \"turned the campus around to face its community\" and enlisted faculty and student help in improving relations with secondary schools, assessing the educational needs of prospective students, and adjusting class scheduling and course offerings to best serve student needs. In academic matters, he consulted the faculty and its Academic Senate for in-depth study and recommendations. His collegial relationship with the faculty and the Senate during his administration was often praised. As the campus' enrollment continued to grow toward its ultimate high of more than 25,000, President Greenlee became deeply involved in all aspects of a second round of major construction. For an outlay of $75 million, the campus' physical facilities were doubled with the construction of the Administration Tower, a second building for the JFK Library, major additions to the Engineering and Technology building, and the new Physical Sciences and Simpson Tower buildings. Also added was a gigantic parking lot north of campus to accommodate the growing numbers of commuting students. Recognizing the campus' need to expand its ties with the outside world, Dr. Greenlee established the offices of University Development and Alumni Affairs. Mid-way through his tenure as President (1972), the California State Colleges (CSC) became The California State Universities and Colleges (CSUC), and our campus became California State University at Los Angeles (the word \"at\" was later replaced by a comma), an action that greatly pleased him. From those who knew and worked with him, Dr. Greenlee earned the highest marks as a university administrator, as evidenced by the impressive scope and number of state and city leaders, in addition to faculty, staff, students, and alumni, who praised his accomplishments highly at his retirement banquet. Everyone with whom you talk about John Greenlee describes him with such simple words as \"calm,\" \"cool, \"relaxed,\" \"never irritated,\" \"easy to talk with,\" and \"a patient listener.\" He always seemed able to deal with any issue�large or small�that was placed before him. As one top university administrator put it, \"he seemed always to know more about the subject I came to discuss with him than I did, even in the academic area I headed.� Perhaps it was because he was an assiduous reader who could be observed through the open door to his office deeply engrossed at his countertop desk, literally absorbing the contents of stacks of memoranda, reports, and other materials. With his vast knowledge, he never hesitated to make decisions about tough issues when they were presented. During his entire life as a teacher and administrator, John Greenlee devoted his efforts to promoting excellence in education. His contributions toward that objective will forever be a part of California State University, Los Angeles.\n\nThe Emeritimes, Winter 1993\n\nFRANCESCA (KIKI) ALEXANDER, Emerita Professor of Sociology, died on October 11, 1992, a few days short of her 66th birthday, losing a valiant battle against cancer. Memorial services were held on October 14 at St. Mary's Episcopal Church, Mar Visa, with many faculty members in attendance. Kiki joined the Cal State L.A. faculty in 1964 as an assistant professor of sociology, following a career in the aerospace industry as a technical writer and human factors analyst. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Chicago and a Ph.D. at the University of Southern California. Her specializations within sociology included statistical analysis of research data, social psychology, gerontology, and medical sociology, in which she developed and taught the course in our program. Her courses�from general education to graduate level�reflect her scholarship in all these areas, as do her many publications, addresses, and consultantships. Her academic record in teaching and research is matched by her record of service to the University. Following appointments to numerous department and school commit-tees, Kiki chaired the university-level Faculty Policy Committee and worked diligently to achieve reconciliation of pre-existing campus policies and procedures with the system wide collective bargaining agreement. She served thereafter as president of the campus CFA chapter, campus academic senator, system wide CFA secretary, and system wide academic senator. In all these capacities, she was noted for her sensitivity and integrity. Beyond the campus community, Kiki \"lived\" sociology through volunteer work with both church and civic groups devoted to meeting needs of the poor, troubled youth, battered women, and the elderly. She also held memberships in national and regional sociology associations and presented papers at major meetings. Kiki maintained a lifelong interest in psychoanalysis. In addition to its relevance to her work in medical sociology and social psychology, her interest was motivated by her father's pioneering work in psychoanalysis, first in Germany and later in the United States, to which her family had immigrated when Kiki was three. Over the years after his death, Kiki gathered and organized Dr. Franz Alexander's papers, letters, films, and tapes and arranged for their use in an authorized biography of which she had planned to be a coauthor. The Franz Alexander biography will not be written solely by Dr. George H. Pollock, a past president of the American Psychiatric Association, with appropriate attributions to Francesca. Francesca Alexander is survived by her husband, Jacob Levine, a retired Los Angeles County probation administrator, and their son, Alexander Levine, a Ph.D. candidate in physics at UCLA.\n\nThe Emeritimes, Winter 1993\n\nDAN CAPPA, Emeritus Professor of Education, came to Cal State L.A. to chair the (then) Department of Elementary Education in 1959.

Among her many accomplishments was the founding of Cal State L.A.'s (then) Department of Special Education (with Dr. Francis Lord) and of a program in education for individuals with physical handicaps. She was known for her work with spastic children, and she helped establish a residency program for adults. Dr. Hatcher earned a B.S. degree in 1925 at East Central Teachers College, an M.S. in 1933 from Oklahoma A&M, and an Ed.D. in 1950 at the University of Denver. She was awarded a Certificate of Clinical Competence in Speech from the American Speech and Hearing Association in 1955 and became a Licensed Psychologist in California in 1959. She was a Fulbright Scholar in Denmark and received the campus' Outstanding Professor Award (OPA) for the 1969-70 academic year. After her retirement from Cal State L.A., Dr. Hatcher continued to work as a psychologist. Her work goes on through the programs she established.\n\nThe Emeritimes, Winter 1993\n\nLEONARD F. HEATH, Emeritus Professor of Art, died in late October 1992. He had taught on campus for 30 years�from 1956 until his retirement in 1986, and was highly regarded for his mastery as a sculptor and his skill and dedication as a teacher. Dr. Heath grew up in Los Angeles and earned BFA (1950), MFA (1951), and Ed.D. degrees (1963) at USC. While at Cal State L.A., he was active in University affairs at all levels, representing his school on the Academic Senate for many years and serving on the University Beautification Committee and its subcommittee for placement of art works on campus. He also developed plans for two sculpture gardens for the campus. For his extensive, varied service, he received the campus' Outstanding Professor Award (OPA) in 1973-74. He traveled extensively, visiting the Far East, Central and South America and Russia, including Siberia and Mongolia. Very active in his field, he served on the boards of directors of the Downey Museum and the Pasadena Society of Artists and participated in the USC Postdoctoral Colloquium.
