        "text": "International Lancs...\n\nNo-one is in a position to get nationalistic over Lancaster preservation, I'd say.\n\nCanada built them too and is responsible for the majority of survivors.\n\nThe BBMF Lancaster survived, in part, due to a mapping requirement in Africa, after being allocated to attack Japan.\n\nThe BBMF Lanc's upper turret came from Argentina.\n\nThe AWM's iconic G-for-George in Canberra is a proud Australian possession, but much credit goes to the builders in the UK.\n\nThe French have been responsible for helping several survive, including their own example under restoration at Le Bourget.\n\nThe IWM Lancaster at Duxford is a Canadian machine.\n\nThe IWM Lambeth nose section was from an RAAF Squadron.\n\nWithout a multi-national team, 'Spirit of Surfer's Paradise', NX611, G-ASXX would never have returned to the UK from Australia. Without the Panton's it wouldn't be the star 'Just Jane' that she is now.\n\nAnd hats off the 44 Sqn, the BBMF (and the MOD) as well as the CWH for putting them where they belong.\n\nI thought I'd seen annd photographed most of the world's surviving Lancs until I tried to 'tick-off' the remaining Canadian survivors I hadn't seen - Oops! How many?\n\nWithout friends (and some enemies) we'd all be the poorer.\n\n* * * * *\n\nAs for e-bay, aircraft bits can be (to others than us) categorised as (specialist interest) junk. Without the buyers out there, the vast majority of whom are not rebuilders but collectors, none of this would have anything but sentimental value. Stuff being kept and then offered for sale is a factor of rarity and thus financial value - thus there are no 'bargains' on e-bay, as it's the proverbial level playing field, but it does help stuff move about.\n\nIf you want bargains, you've got to be lucky and looking elsewhere that e-bay. Otherwise pay (current) market value on e-bay."
