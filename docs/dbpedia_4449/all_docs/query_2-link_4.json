        "text": "Where are they now?\n\nMany regional airlines contributed to sector growth, before being absorbed into larger carriers and their identity lost for ever. Others disappeared because ambitious business plans could not be sustained. The rest is history…\n\nCaledonian Airways\n\nFormed in 1961 as a privately owned charter airline. The brainchild of a former BEA Viscount Captain and Cunard Eagle’s office manager in New York. With three associates, they wanted to adopt the name Scottish Airways, but found that BEA had beaten them to it. For the first ten years never made a loss. The first flight in 1961 was a charter from London Gatwick to Barbados using DC-7. Bristol Britannia added to the fleet. In December that year, the first fare-paying passengers left Prestwick for New York, the fare £40 return. The tagline “The Scottish International Airline” was added to the fuselage and the tartan uniform introduced for female cabin crew. Superior cabin service offered when compared with other charter airlines. The granting of a foreign air carrier permit by President John F Kennedy in 1963 effectively removed obstacles placed by the mainstream carriers such as PanAm and TWA. By the end of 1970, the fleet consisted B707 for transatlantic and far east operations, BAC1-11 for domestic and European flights. Then merged with British United Airways to form British Caledonian. Stringent rules meant that the only passengers were members of “affinity groups” with names including Rose & Amity Maple Club. However, the system soon became unworkable as the popularity of transatlantic travel grew rapidly. Many attempts were made to obtain a licence for transatlantic scheduled services. In 1988, British Airtours adopted the popular Caledonian Airways brand, after BA had taken over British Caledonian. The Tristar retained, B737 and B757 returned to BA. Sold to Inspirations, a UK based travel operator. When that company was taken over by Thomas Cook, Caledonian was merged into Flying Colours, then JMC. Thomas Cook Airlines then disposed of the Tristar due to poor reliability.\n\nHighland Express\n\nFormed in 1984, operating daily flights between Prestwick International and Newark. Its founder, Randolph Fields had been involved with concept and start-up of Virgin Atlantic. Late delivery of their B747-100 put a strain on building a good customer base. The first flight operated by a Cargolux B747-200; passengers had to return on Northwest Airlines. The Canadian Government blocked the issue of a licence to operate Newark-Toronto. The schedule was then amended to London Stansted-Newark via Prestwick 4xweekly and Birmingham-Newark via Prestwick 3xweekly. Cabin crew recruited in Ayrshire and Glasgow; the Cabin Crew Manager had previously been involved in the inception of Emirates. Also operated as a domestic carrier, London Stansted-Prestwick costing £19. In late 1986, introduced London Gatwick-Prestwick-Newark. Three weeks later, the lessor impounded the aircraft whilst undergoing maintenance in Brussels. Despite claiming high passenger loads, the airline’s demise was ultimately due to only operating one aircraft.\n\nAir Ecosse\n\nBased at Aberdeen, its first flight in June 1977 to Wick. A subsidiary of Fairflight Charters based at Biggin Hill, in 1988 it was taken over by Peregrine Air Services. In the same year, became Aberdeen Airways and folded soon after. Destinations included Edinburgh, Dundee, Manchester and Sumburgh. Also operated to Esbjerg, Faroe, Cork, Dublin and Shannon as well as many UK airports. The fleet consisted smaller propeller aircraft. The Embraer Bandeirante used to operate the Royal Mail and Datapost contracts with regular sightings at Edinburgh, Southend, Liverpool and Luton. Possibly due to the type of aircraft, the airline acquired the nickname “Hairy Chaos”. The album “Northern Electric” by Cruiser possibly contains a tribute to the airline, although it’s difficult to work out given there’s few lyrics!\n\nFlyglobespan\n\nCommenced operations in April 2003, from Prestwick. Also served Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen. Flights initially used two Channel Express B737-700 with their crew. Adopted the slogan “Award Winning Airline”. Linked to a travel operator, Globespan. Considered low frills, its first flights were to popular destinations in France, Spain and Italy. As the network expanded, Glasgow became the primary base, with many scheduled services to Europe, North America and Africa operating from major UK airports. An operating licence granted in 2004 resulted in rapid growth. By early 2005, had a fleet of nine Boeing aircraft. Late 2005 saw the first Glasgow-Orlando Sanford flight, using the B767-300ER. Barely a year later, massive profits were announced. The ambitious plan to operate Liverpool-Hamilton International lasted six months, due to reliability issues with the leased B757-200. Manchester-Hamilton not a success either. Flyglobespan introduced the first ever long-haul flight from Doncaster Sheffield-Hamilton. Then added Knock-JFK 3xweekly and Boston 2xweekly. Many unscheduled refuelling stops were made in the US on the JFK route. In 2007, the airline’s Skytrax rating was withdrawn, due to “product and service inconsistency”; never to be reinstated. Financial difficulties began in 2008, due to the credit card clearing company E-Clear withholding money due to Globespan. In the ensuing battle, E-Clear turned down a suggested independent audit to establish the correct amount outstanding. Shortly after, Halcyon Investments offered a large cash injection. E-Clear’s CEO also part of this company. Globespan folded in December 2009.\n\nAir Scotland\n\nFounded in 2002 by an Iraqi-born businessman. Started flights from Glasgow in 2003, using the operating certificate of Greece Airways, after unsuccessful tie-ups with Electra Airlines and Air Holland. Planned routes from Glasgow to Miami, New York and Cuba failed to materialise; Glasgow-Stansted-Baghdad also a non-starter. In 2006, it served popular holiday destinations in Spain and Greece from many UK airports. Difficulties were encountered when H Top Hotels bought the airline. Due to poor communication and difficulties with the transfer of ownership, passengers were stranded in Palma for 17 hours. The captain of the Fischer Air Polska aircraft refused service to Air Scotland because he believed, erroneously, his employer had not been paid. The company ceased operations in 2005. At time of demise, operated fleet of A321 and B757.\n\nInformation courtesy of Wikipedia, Airline History, PPRuNe\n\nImages courtesy of Wikimedia, airplanepictures.net, Anna Aero, airlinegeeks, airlinereporter"
