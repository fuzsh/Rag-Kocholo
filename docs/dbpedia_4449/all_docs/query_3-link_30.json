        "text": "On the afternoon of 06April1935, PH-AFL crashed in a heavy snowstorm near Brilon, between Leipzig and Essen on the Prague-Rotterdam route. The Fokker F.XII flew into a mountain slope in conditions of blinding snow, thunder and unusual darkness. According to a German investigation report, visibility at the time of the crash was less than 250 ft.\n\nThe machine was totally burnt out. Two passengers and five crew members were killed, including Captain Pier Soer well known for his Christmas flight in a Fokker F.XVIII called 'Pelikaan', in 1933.\n\nWebmaster- following website www.dutch-aviation.nl also has an image of PH-AFL and info on the Fokker F.XII\n\nFokker F XI, FLUGPLATZ-GENOSSENSCHAFT BERN, reg. CH-188 (HB-ALO)\n\nDuring the spring of 1929, the Alpar-Bern looked around for a suitable aircraft. The company found in the Netherlands the Fokker F.XI. For many this aircraft was a step back in the development of Fokker-aircraft. In a way this was a modernised Fokker F.II, capable of carrying just 4-5 passengers.\n\nThe power plant of the Alpar-Bern aircraft was a 240 hp Lorraine-Dietrich 7A air-cooled radial engine, providing the aircraft a cruising speed of 165 kmh.\n\nThe aircraft carried the name Universal, which was not to be confused with the famous American-built Fokker Universal.\n\nThe Swiss company decided to purchase one Fokker F.XI (c/n 5124) and received the aircraft on the June 8th that year. It was registered CH 188 (later HB-ALO) and was given the name Stadt Bern (City of Bern).\n\nFokker B. IV was use in United States of America.\n\nFirst flown in 1928 the B.IV was the final development of the Fokker flying boats and amphibians B. I, B. II and B. III.\n\nOriginally designed for the military the boat had a limited success as an airliner for seven passengers, called F.11 in the USA. Of the initially planned production of six aircraft, only two were finished. They were owned and flown by Americans Vanderbilt and Wood. The type had an all metal fuselage and wooden wing.\n\nThatâ€™s all I know about photograph..!\n\nWebmaster- see link Wikipedia for info on Fokker F.11 / B.IV"
