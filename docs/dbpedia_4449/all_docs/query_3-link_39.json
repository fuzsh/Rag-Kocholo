        "text": "An Oldham engineering plant which has been producing aircraft since World War II has shut down.\n\nBAE Systems in Chadderton opened in 1939 as Avro Headquarters, producing one of the most well-known wartime bombers, the Lancaster.\n\nIt once employed about 11,000 people but has been closed after being declared \"no longer viable\".\n\nManager Steve Kilroy said such was its importance that without it \"the country would not be what it is today\".\n\nThe site was closed with a banging out ceremony, which saw employees and ex-workers hammering out a tribute to the site with tools on the fences and lamp posts around the plant.\n\nFormer worker Tracey Rodgers, whose father and brother also worked at the site, said seeing it close was \"so sad\"."
