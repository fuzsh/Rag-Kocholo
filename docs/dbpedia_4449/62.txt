A Vampire crashed on 02 Aug 1952 at RAF Luqa and from records it seems to be the only Vampire crash on the Island.

Quite a few Avro Yorks have crashed in Malta, in 1958 two Avro Yorks crashed on the 25th February and 22nd May. (Incidentally one was Dan Air G-AMUT)

Perhaps your friend was referring to two Valetta's which crashed the day after each other? These being 17th and 18th May 1953 although records show them to be RAF aircraft as opposed to civilian registered.

If you look at this web page it lists all the post war crashes in Malta and there seems to be quite a few despite it being only a small island. Good luck with your research!
