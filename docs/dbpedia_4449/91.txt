Scottish carrier Loganair, operator of the world’s shortest scheduled flight and another that lands on a remote Hebridean beach, is repainting its fleet into tartan colors and seeking new allies as it prepares to go solo after almost a quarter of century flying in the livery of other airlines.

The Glasgow-based company, known for its routes to the far-flung archipelagos of Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles, has begun transforming its planes with a red, black and gray tail design and the logo “Scotland’s Airline” as it prepares for independence at the start of next month. The plaid pattern is listed as entry 11,744 on the official Scottish Register of Tartans.
