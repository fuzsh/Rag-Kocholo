        "text": "WHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: Trout is one of those true generational players, the type of home-grown superstar who defines a franchise long before his career is finished. And, sure, we’re calling this early for Trout, considering 2016 is only his fifth full year in the majors, but in his four seasons in the majors, he’s won one AL MVP and finished second three times. — Ryan Fagan\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Teemu Selanne, Tim Salmon\n\nMORE: Trout doesn't condone bat-flipping | Best MLB players of all-time, by jersey number\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: Aaron’s 715th home run, the blast off Al Downing that pushed Hammerin’ Hank past Babe Ruth on the career list, remains the defining moment in Atlanta sports. He came to Atlanta when the Braves made the move from Milwaukee in 1966, when he was already 32 years old. Still, he popped 335 homers for Atlanta’s team, passing legends like Jimmie Foxx, Ted Williams and Mel Ott along the way. — Fagan\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Chipper Jones, Dominique Wilkins, Greg Maddux\n\nMORE: Best MLB stars of all-time, by jersey number\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: This was not an easy selection, because Boston sports history is loaded with heroes. It would be easier to pick an iconic goat; that would be unfortunate former Red Sox owner Harry Frazee.\n\nSox heroes would include Ted Williams, Johnny Pesky, Carl Yastrzemski and David Ortiz. The Patriots bring Tom Brady, among others. The Bruins? They don't come any bigger than Bobby Orr.\n\nEven the Celtics offered a shamrock-field full of options. Bill Russell, after all, might be the most successful player in any team's history.\n\nBird gets the word because he ushered in more than just a renaissance of championship basketball in Boston. The NBA was on life support when Bird and Magic Johnson brought it back to life with their legendary rivalry. The Hick from French Lick was a show-stopping talent. He was so good, not even Harry Frazee would have traded him. No, no, Nanette. — Ray Slover\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Ted Williams, Bobby Orr, Tom Brady, Bill Russell\n\nMORE: Best NBA stars, by jersey number\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: The every-day love story. Kelly ditched Buffalo for the USFL after the 1983 Draft, but he came back in 1986 and would lead the Bills to four consecutive Super Bowls starting in 1990. The relationship with the small-market city blossomed into the perfect marriage, with the perfect number. Kelly’s No. 12 is the only jersey the Bills have retired, and he symbolized the city’s resiliency once again through his recent battle with cancer. Buffalo and Kelly simply go together forever. — Bill Bender\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Bruce Smith, Dominik Hasek\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: Newton didn’t take long to convince Carolina he was worth the No. 1 pick in the 2011 NFL Draft. Newton threw for 422 yards in his debut, and he’s evolved into a NFL MVP over the past five seasons. It’s come with a few bumps, but it’s become something special. Newton is a never-before-seen talent who does it his way, and he had the entire city of Charlotte “dabbin’” all the way to Super Bowl 50. The good times will roll in the Queen City for years to come. — Bender\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Dale Earnhardt, Steve Smith, Larry Johnson, Mugsy Bogues\n\nMORE: Best NFL players by jersey number | Gossage doesn't want bunch of 'Cam Newtons' in MLB\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: Chicago, the Windy City, the city of broad shoulders, hog butcher of the … you know. There is no individual from any of the city's pro sports teams to rival Jordan.\n\nMust be the shoes … or maybe it's the six NBA titles he helped secure in the 1990s. The dunks; the clutch shots; the awe-inspiring moments Chicago fans dream of on their way to sleep.\n\nOh, we could make a good case for Cubs icon Ernie Banks, a great player who would always want to play two for a cursed franchise. There are monsters to be considered, as the Bears gave us Sweetness, Walter Payton, and power and pain with Dick Butkus. Love the ChiSox? Name a great.\n\nMichael Jordan is Chicago. No one comes within a tongue's wag of matching. — Slover\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Ernie Banks, Walter Payton, Dick Butkus\n\nMORE: Jordan prepared for 95-96 season on set of 'Space Jam' | Best NBA stars by jersey number\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: Why didn’t we pick LeBron? Clevelanders never burned Brown’s jersey. He was the star player on the city’s last pro sports championship team in 1964. There’s no doubting Brown’s legacy. He’s considered by some to be the greatest NFL player of all time. LeBron can change this by breaking Cleveland’s championship drought, but there’s no guarantee that will happen. Cleveland is a Browns town first, and nobody represented that golden era more than No. 32. — Bender\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: LeBron James, Bob Feller, Omar Vizquel, Bernie Kosar\n\nMORE: Brown's leadership, lessons endure | Classic photos of Jim Brown\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: This is the only college selection on this list, and it comes with good reason. Columbus has NHL and MLS franchises, but the city lives through Ohio State football. Nobody represents that unbridled love for the Buckeyes more than Griffin, a two-time Heisman Trophy winner and the star piece in Woody Hayes’ Big Ten championship mechanism. Griffin still lives in Columbus and he’s arguably the most-recognizable face in the community. This is an easy choice. — Bender\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Rick Nash, Barros Schelotto\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: It has to be a Cowboys legend, and there are so many to choose from. It was tough to go against Roger Staubach, who led Dallas to five Super Bowl appearances. Yet the slight edge goes to Smith, the NFL’s all-time leading rusher and the driving force behind three Super Bowl runs in the 1990s. Smith’s toughness —best shown in the 1993 regular-season finale against the Giants when he played through a shoulder injury — still endures. — Bender\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Roger Staubach, Mike Modano, Dirk Nowitzki, Nolan Ryan, Pudge Rodriguez\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: Elway’s star power soared on Jan. 11, 1987, when he led the Broncos to a 98-yard scoring drive at Cleveland Municipal Stadium. Elway made all the right plays in leading Denver to a 23-20 win and a berth in Super Bowl XXI. While several other great moments followed — including back-to-back Super Bowl wins to close his career — “The Drive” is the moment that immortalized Elway in the Mile High City. We love that bright orange No. 7, too. — Bender\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Joe Sakic, Peyton Manning, Alex English, Todd Helton\n\nMORE: How Elway built champion Broncos\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: He is Mr. Hockey. Oh sure, his Red Wings play in Joe Louis Arena, but outside stands a 12-foot, 2-ton statue of the greatest player in Wings history who, until Wayne Gretzky arrived, was the greatest player in NHL history. Sorry, Bobby Orr fans.\n\nNo. 9 is forever. Howe is in declining health and has dementia, but a recent visit to The Joe sent chills through the team. — Slover\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Al Kaline, Joe Dumars, Barry Sanders\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: How do you pick between three Green Bay legends? Bart Starr won five championships in the Lombardi heyday. Aaron Rodgers is a two-time NFL MVP with a Super Bowl. In the middle is Favre, the one America enjoyed watching — for better or worse — the most. The three-time MVP helped Green Bay back on the NFL map, and the image of Favre sprinting around the Superdome with helmet flying high in Super Bowl XXXI carries on. Even though Favre left for a while, the love affair with Packers fans continues. — Bender\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Bart Starr, Aaron Rodgers, Reggie White\n\nMORE: Favre more fun than Manning | Favre heads Hall class\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: Given what Hakeem Olajuwon did at both the college and pro level, this seems like an impossible choice. But Campbell, widely considered the best high school player in Texas history, ushered in the “Luv Ya Blue” era in 1978 with a whirlwind of powerful runs. Who could forget the Monday Night Football game against Miami? Bum Phillips’ cowboy hat? Campbell running around with his jersey falling off? Campbell carried Houston to the AFC championship on those big shoulders. The Oilers might be gone, but that season will never be forgotten. — Bender\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Hakeem Olajuwon, Nolan Ryan, Craig Biggio/Jeff Bagwell\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: Manning’s career trajectory changed in the 2006 AFC championship game. That’s when he led the Colts back from a 21-3 deficit against the rival Patriots with a game-winning 80-yard TD drive. That propelled Manning to his first Super Bowl victory. That changed the narrative on Manning, who became more than just a fantasy football championship quarterback. Manning would leave Indianapolis for Denver late in his career, but Andrew Luck has a long way to go to reach this level of love. — Bender\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Reggie Miller, A.J. Foyt\n\nMORE: Manning should ride off into sunset | What next? TV, or team exec? | Best NFL players by jersey number\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: The Jaguars have had some good players, including Mark Brunell, Fred Taylor and Maurice Jones-Drew. Boselli, a five-time Pro Bowler, is the most-likely player to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. This isn’t a sexy pick by any means, but it’s the best pick for this city. Boselli was Jacksonville’s first-ever draft pick, and he still does play-by-play for the Jaguars. Perhaps this will be Blake Bortles someday. The young quarterback has shown promise. — Bender\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Mark Brunell, Maurice Jones-Drew\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: L.A. will always be a Lakers town, first and foremost, and Magic is the reason why. His teams changed the way the NBA operated and his skills — he was a 6-9 point guard, for crying out loud — changed the way players played the game. In the 1986-87 season, the Showtime Lakers were still at their peak—they won their fourth of five titles in Magic’s career — and Magic won his first NBA regular-season MVP award, after averaging a career-best 23.9 points per game to go with 12.2 assists per contest. And to beat Boston in the NBA Finals was a perfect cap to an amazing season. — Fagan\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Sandy Koufax, Kobe Bryant, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Eric Dickerson, Fernando Valenzuela\n\nMORE: Magic getting another talk show | Best NBA stars by jersey number\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: Gasol’s arrival in the town where he made a lasting impact is different from any other player on this list — he came to Memphis in a trade that sent his brother, Pau, out of town (to the Lakers). Marc, a two-time All-Star, has exceeded most every expectation in his time in Memphis. When the Grizzlies made their memorable run to the Western Conference Finals in 2013 — knocking off No. 1 seed Oklahoma City in the conference semifinals — Marc averaged 17.2 points and 2.2 blocks in those 15 games, up from his season averages of 14.1 and 1.7. — Fagan\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Mike Conley, Zac Randolph, Pau Gasol\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: The ’72 Dolphins are still the standard team for which others are judged by, but Marino remains the iconic player in South Beach, even ahead of Dwyane Wade of the Miami Heat. Marino’s MVP season in 1984 – the one where he passed for then-NFL records of 5,084 yards and 48 TDs en route to his only Super Bowl appearance — was simply the start of a remarkable career. Marino’s celebrity status in Miami remains today. Seriously, was there a better fit in “Ace Ventura: Pet Detective?” — Bender\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Dwyane Wade, Bob Griese, Larry Csonka\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: Puckett might not have looked much like a prototypical superstar — he was short and stout instead of tall and imposing — but he played like one during his dozen season with the Twins. Minnesota wasn’t the favorite in the 1987 or the 1991 World Series matchups, but the Twins won both, with Puckett doing amazing things along the way. — Fagan\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Kevin Garnett, Harmon Killebrew, Randy Moss, Fran Tarkenton\n\nMORE: Best MLB players of all-time, by jersey number\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: The great Richard, the Rocket, remains among the most revered players in Canadiens history. His scoring prowess was rivaled only by his fierceness, and some would argue his cruelty, as a player. Montreal defines itself bleu, blanc et rouge. No. 9, Maurice Richard, led eight Habs teams to the Stanley Cup in the Original Six era, including five in a row between 1956 and '60. Vive le Rocket. — Slover\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Gary Carter, Andre Dawson\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: Steve McNair was the quarterback who helped the Tennessee Oilers transition into the Tennessee Titans, and that materialized with the Music City Miracle run through the 1999 AFC Playoffs. McNair was just so-damn tough. He played through injuries. He lived up the first-round billing. He was a yard shot from pushing Super Bowl XXXIV into overtime. McNair’s life was cut short after his playing career, but his impact for this NFL franchise remains. — Bender\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Eddie George\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: Archie Manning is the hometown hero, and this is closer than you think. Yet Brees is the one who legitimized a moribund NFL franchise into a winner with 5,000 passing yards at a time, and the Super Bowl XLIV win was part of the ongoing healing process from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Brees has done all that with class befitting of one of the NFL’s most-underrated great quarterbacks. — Bender\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Archie Manning, Anthony Davis\n\nMORE: Best NFL players by jersey numbers | New Brees contract coming soon |\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: New York has seen legends rise and fall during its time as America’s sports capitol, but no player has captured the imagination of a nation or a sport like this iconic slugger. Baseball was never the same after Ruth started smacking baseballs over the fences at a record pace. We chose 1927, of course, because that’s the year Ruth popped an eye-popping 60 home runs and the Yankees’ Murders’ Row lineup won the World Series. — Fagan\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Willis Reed, Derek Jeter, Mickey Mantle, Joe Namath, Lawrence Taylor, Joe DiMaggio, Patrick Ewing, Mark Messier\n\nMORE: Classic photos of Babe Ruth from SN archives | Best MLB players by jersey number\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: God, we loved the Raiders. Sinister Al Davis built a football team that tweaked the nose of Pete Rozelle's button-down NFL, proving nice guys didn't always finish first because they had to best the pride and poise of the gnarly men in silver and black.\n\nThe A's have a history that is almost as colorful. Reggie Jackson and his 1970s teammates made them the counterculture team to contract against the Reds.\n\nBut we're going with the man millennials will see as the greatest player to represent a hard-scrabble city. Curry is magic, seemingly able to conjure up shots that make the most pleasing sound in basketball.\n\nMORE: Best NBA stars by jersey number\n\nSplash. That's the stuff that makes Steph iconic. — Slover\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Reggie Jackson, Rickey Henderson, Chris Mullin, Marcus Allen, Ken Stabler\n\nMORE: Curry or Jordan? President Obama weighs in | Could Harlem Globetrotters stop Curry?\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: OK, so there's not a lot of options in The Big. Is it going too far to say Durant's challengers for this mention would include rodeo stars? Durant called down thunder when he arrived, making the Thunder the NBA's best small-market team. Lightning strike us if we're wrong. — Slover\n\nMORE: Durant to Boston hype | Durant to Warriors | Best NBA stars by jersey number\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: Hardaway arrived in Orlando a year after Shaquille O’Neal, and that helped turn a young franchise into a playoff contender in a hurry. Hardaway’s versatility – a 6-foot-7 stud who could play three positions – added to that wow factor. Who could forget those commercials with Lil’ Penny? The Magic were cool, and they took advantage of their second playoff appearance in 1995 by reaching the NBA Finals. Penny stayed with the Magic through 1998-99, and that’s why he’s our choice. – Bender\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Shaquille O’Neal, Dwight Howard\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: Alfie's 17 seasons with the Senators include a stretch as captain from 1999 through 2013. The team's only trip to the Stanley Cup finals resulted in a seven-game loss to the Ducks. He was an outstanding leader; some liken him to the Wings' Steve Yzerman. He remains tops in goals, assists and points in Sens history and played in 1,178 games. — Slover\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: There are so many legit choices here, and it’s almost impossible to pick one. But perhaps nobody represents Philly quite like Iverson, the hard-edged, hard-nosed, hard-truth guard who carried the 76ers to the NBA Finals during a MVP season in 2001. He scored 48 points in Game 1, the 76ers’ only win in the series against the Lakers. Iverson wasn’t perfect and always said what was on his mind. That’s why the Philly fans still love him so much. – Bender\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Julius Erving, Charles Barkley, Mike Schmidt, Randall Cunningham, Reggie White, Bobby Clarke\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: Johnson, who was elected into the Hall of Fame wearing a Diamondbacks’ cap, won four of his five career Cy Young awards for Arizona (1999-2002). The 2001 World Series, held just a few months after the unthinkable 9/11 tragedy, captured the nation’s attention like no other in recent memory. The Diamondbacks beat the Yankees in seven thrilling games, and Johnson was named co-MVP after posting a 1.04 ERA in 17 1/3 innings. — Fagan\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Steve Nash, Larry Fitzgerald, Curt Schilling\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: Few players are as beloved in any city as Clemente is in Pittsburgh. Not only was he an easy choice as a Hall of Famer, he was one of the best people ever to wear a baseball uniform. He was still a young player when he helped the Pirates win the 1960 World Series and growing as a superstar when he won the 1966 NL MVP, but by the time he helped lead the Pirates to the 1971 World Series title (he hit .414 with a pair of home runs and seven RBIs and was named series MVP), his legend was fully secure. — Fagan\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Mario Lemieux, Joe Green, Terry Bradshaw, Willie Stargell, Franco Harris\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: It’s either Walton or Clyde Drexler for this basketball-crazy city, and it’s a can’t-lose decision. We gave the slight edge to Walton, the big, bad, red-haired MVP who carried the Trail Blazers to their first and only NBA championship 1977. Walton averaged 18.6 points and 14.4 rebounds that season, an amazing one-of-a-kind year the city still revels in today. – Bender\n\nHONORABLE MENTION: Clyde Drexler\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: In St. Louis, he’s known simply as “Stan” or sometimes “The Man” but his last name isn’t necessary. Baseball fans know. Between 1942 and 1948, the Cardinals won the World Series three times and Musial won the NL MVP three times. The only time both things happened in the same year: 1946. His legacy in St. Louis only grew after his playing days ended; a generation of St. Louisians who grew up after he retired knew him as the former Cardinal who plays the harmonica all the time and smiles a lot. — Fagan\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Bob Gibson, Brett Hull, Ozzie Smith\n\nMORE: Best MLB players of all-time, by jersey number\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: This is our only dual choice, but seriously, how do you pick one without the other? Stockton arrived in 1984, and Malone followed one year later. Together, this unlikely combination formed the greatest pick-and-roll duo in NBA history. Malone and Stockton took the Jazz to the first of five conference finals in 1991-92. Even though the Jazz lost to the Trail Blazers in six games, that appearance set the tone for the success of the franchise for years to come. — Bender\n\nHONORABLE MENTION: Pete Maravich\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: Duncan is an easy choice. He’s been the constant face through San Antonio’s five-championship run that started with the title in the strike-shortened 1998-99 season. That’s why we picked the 2002-03 season. Duncan led the Spurs to 60 wins and to a win against the Nets in the NBA Finals. Other players have fit into the master plan with the Spurs, but Duncan’s presence – however emotionless – continues to be the driving force. — Bender\n\nHONORABLE MENTION: George Gervin, David Robinson, Tony Parker\n\nMORE: Best NBA stars by jersey number\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: Of course, the jersey choice for San Diego had to be the Padres’ completely awesome brown jerseys from the 1980s. And that works out perfectly, because Tony Gwynn gave the baseball world a glimpse as to what was to come in 1984, when he hit .351 (he batted at least .350 six more times in his career) and helped lead the Padres to the World Series for the first time in franchise history. — Fagan\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: LaDanian Tomlinson, Junior Seau, Dan Fouts\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: When Montana released a third-and-3 pass on Jan. 10, 1982, everything changed in San Francisco. The 49ers became a four-time Super Bowl-winning machine with Montana at the controls. Montana became the ultimate symbol of cool – “Joe Cool” – which he flashed with that game-winning drive against the Bengals in Super Bowl XXIII. That’s why Montana is the choice here over Willie Mays, one of the toughest if not toughest call on this list. It’s a good thing Dwight Clark caught that ball, right? — Bender\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Willie Mays, Jerry Rice, Barry Bonds\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: When overwhelming public sentiment calls for a superstar to return “home” to finish his career, you know the bond between player and city is special. Griffey, known as The Kid, was an instant fan favorite when he made his debut as a 19-year-old center fielder less than two years after he was the No. 1 overall pick in the MLB draft. In 1997, Griffey won his lone MVP award (56 homers, 147 RBIs, 1.028 OPS) and the Mariners won the AL West. — Fagan\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Gary Payton, Steve Largent, Shawn Kemp, Edgar Martinez\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: The first-round pick blossomed into a Pro Bowl player and had the Redskins in the playoff hunt in 2007 when tragedy struck. Taylor’s death occurred late in the season, cutting short the life a 24-year old star-in-the-making. The Redskins rallied around Taylor’s loss to make the playoffs before losing to Seattle in the wild card round. For a city that hugs the Redskins a little tighter than everybody else, the loss of Taylor still hurts almost a decade later. — Bender\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Joe Theismann, John Riggins, Wes Unseld, Alex Ovechkin, Walter Johnson\n\nWHY HE'S OUR CHOICE: The original Jets franchise had a number of heroes, but Hawerchuk is special. The No. 1 overall pick in the 1981 draft, Hawerchuk spurred a 48-point turnaround in his first season. That season saw him with the Calder Trophy as the NHL's top rookie and set a record for rookie points that wouldn't be broken until Sidney Crosby arrived. A poll of NHL GMs in the mid-1980s asked which players they would pick to start a franchise. Hawerchuk was third behind Wayne Gretzky and Paul Coffey. In Winnipeg, there was no doubt — it was Hawerchuk. — Slover"
