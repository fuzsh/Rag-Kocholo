        "text": "A body unidentified for 30 years. A 15-year-old murder that had a suspect, but not enough evidence for trial. A murder victim whose killer was never found. All three of these cases have one thing in common: new technology is helping to unlock their secrets, bringing relief to worried family members and justice to the criminals. CBS News 48 Hours shows, in three dramatic stories, how new technology is helping investigators solve old crimes, mysteries that were once thought to be unsolveable. They include the identification of a dead woman known only as \"Tent Girl,\" the unsolved murder of a teenager from a quiet town, and the shotgun death of a college student. The Story of Tent Girl: How the Web helped solve a 30-year-old case. The Telltale Shotgun Shell: Scientists try to solve a 15-year-old murder. Who Killed Laura Long?: DNA tests may warm up a murderer's cold trail.\n\nIt has been exactly a year since Princess Diana, Dodi Fayed, and their driver, Henri Paul, were killed in a horrific car crash in a Paris tunnel. But there are still many unanswered questions about the circumstances surrounding the accident. Monday night, CBS.com, in conjunction with CBS News 48 Hours, took a look at some of the issues. Among the people interviewed: Kes Wingfield, one of the two bodyguards protecting Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed the night of the crash. He tells 48 Hours that he testified to French authorities that two bodyguards were not enough that evening. On the morning of August 30th, Wingfield said he called Mohammed Al Fayed's security headquarters in London requesting more bodyguards, but the request was denied. Rene Delorm, butler and longtime confidant of Dodi Fayed. Speaking for the first time on American television, Delorm says that around the time of the accident, Dodi was becoming increasingly angry at the intrusions of the paparazzi. Did Dodi order his driver, Henri Paul, to speed up to escape the paparazzi the night of the crash? Delorm thinks not, saying that Dodi wanted only to protect Diana.\n\nCBS News 48 Hours examines the case of Kenneth McDuff, a man who was given an extra chance and used it to kill again. In 1966 McDuff, then 20, brutally murdered three innocent teenagers in his hometown of Rosebud, Texas. He was caught, convicted and sentenced to death. But McDuff got lucky, with dire consequences for others. First, in 1972, the Supreme Court declared capital punishment unconstitutional, sparing McDuff. Then, in 1989, McDuff was paroled from prison. He returned to Rosebud. After he pulled a knife on someone, he was sent back to prison. He was paroled once more. This time he went on to kill at least two others: Between late 1991 and early 1992, he kidnapped and killed two young women, Colleen Reed and Melissa Ann Northrup. He was convicted of the latter crime in 1993 and was sentenced to death. Authorities suspect that he may have killed as many as 14 other women as well. In November 1998, McDuff was executed by injection in Huntsville, Texas. His last words: \"I'm ready to be released. Release me.\" But the question remains: Why was he ever let out?\n\nIs seeing really believing? Eyewitness testimony can be a decisive factor in a courtroom, but what a witness sees - or more precisely, remembers seeing - is not always what really happened. In \"Eyewitness,\" CBS News 48 Hours examines how faded memories can jam the wheels of justice, convicting the innocent and allowing the guilty to go free. Consider the following situations: Dale and Ronnie Mahan: Two Alabama brothers were convicted of kidnap and rape, largely on the basis of compelling eyewitness testimony from the victim. After more than 13 years in prison, they were released when DNA evidence showed that a semen stain on the victim's clothing did not come from either of them. Anne Pope: Despite the DNA evidence used in the Mahan case, the victim continued to be totally convinced that the Mahans are guilty. When the DNA turned out instead to match that of a man with whom she was having an affair, the district attorney decided to retry the case. Then an even more sophisticated test was performed on another piece of semen-stained evidence; the results didn't match the samples from the Mahans or the boyfriend. Late last year, a judge dismissed all charges against the Mahans, who are now seeking $1 million each from the state. Daniel Rubin: After being wounded in a San Diego bank heist, Daniel Rubin was asked by San Diego police to try to identify his masked assailant using his split-second memories. How reliable could he be?\n\nThink it's too late to find fame and fortune? Think again. CBS News 48 Hours takes a look at a few people who dreamed of making it big in entertainment. They were regular Joes and Josephines, without million-dollar bank accounts to fund their projects. How did they do? Among the extraordinary people you'll meet on this Thursday's show are: Nicholas Sparks, a pharmaceutical salesman who dreamed of becoming a novelist - and did. He's just finished his third book, and his second book, a bestseller like the first, is being turned into a movie starring Paul Newman and Kevin Costner. Vin Diesel , a charismatic young filmmaker/actor who dreams of breaking through at the famed Sundance Film Festival. Darren Aronofsky , another obsessive filmmaker with dreams of cinematic stardom.

Unlike crack cocaine, which primarily targeted the inner-city during its reign of terror in the 1980's, crank is making it's mark in Small Town, U.S.A. The drug's users range from middle class and well-educated people to teens -- even mothers who have passed on their addictions to their babies. One of the reasons crank is growing so quickly is that methamphetamine is easily produced in makeshift labs from inexpensive raw materials. In addition, users experience a \"high\" lasting up to 30 hours -- much longer than many other drugs. \"Methamphetamine may be the worst drug ever to hit America,\" says retired General Barry McAffrey, the nation's Drug Czar. \"It's expanding in a very bizarre manner. It's all over the Midwest. It's in Idaho, Arizona, Hawaii, San Francisco, Southern California. It's now showing up in Georgia.\" Crank's explosive growth is being fueled by mass production labs run by Mexican nationals. Authorities say they produce up to 95% of the crank on America's streets. CBS News 48 Hours took a close look at methamphetamine on Thursday, and found a drug that threatens to tear apart the lives of countless Americans.

It's a crime she says she did not commit. \"The charges against me are preposterous and they're obviously false,\" Berenson said. \"I am not a terrorist by any means; quite the contrary I do not believe in any act of terrorism.\" Peter Van Sant brings an exclusive interview from Peru. Love Crosses Boarders: Jason and Meriam Johnson insist nothing will ever come between them But there are powerful forces trying to pull them apart. Their romance has become an international incident. In the name of love, they've broken laws and defied a royal family. Correspondent Harold Dow reports.\n\nDr. Mary Howell is probably the last person you'd expect to be unraveling a 17-year-old murder case, but it's one that still haunts the 87-year-old still-practicing chiropractor. On the night of June 4, 1983, her daughter Peggy and husband Doug Ryen, both 41, were savagely hacked to death in the affluent California community of Chino Hills, along with their 10-year-old daughter Jessica and a friend who happened to be spending the night, Christopher Hughes. Floyd Tidwell, then the sheriff of San Bernadino County, described it as one of the most brutal, senseless crimes. Howell's grandson, 8 and 1/2-year-old Josh, was also found in the carnage, his throat cut, but somehow he survived. He was rushed to Loma Linda Hospital. While Howell and a frightened community mourned, the search for the killers was on. Initially the sheriff was looking for several people because of the number of victims and the injuries, he said. The killer or killers left no fingerprints; nothing was taken from the Ryen house, except for the family's station wagon. Then they got a break. While searching what they thought was a vacant house next door to the Ryen house, the sheriff's deputies found evidence that someone had been hiding out there. When they checked phone records, they discovered that two phone calls had been made by a Kevin Cooper, a convicted burglar who had escaped from a minimum-security prison nearby two days earlier.\n\nOn December 2, 1999, a vacant warehouse caught fire in Worcester, Mass. As many as 40 firefighters tried to put out the blaze. Some entered the building, trying to rescue a homeless couple believed to be inside. But firefighters searched for them in vain. First two firemen, then two more became lost in the smoky haze. Heavy black smoke, fueled by the petroleum lining of the cold storage lockers, poured from the lockers and into the stairway; it was impossible to see. District Chief Mike McNamee made a tough call: He ordered everyone out. But when it was all over, the fire had claimed six of Worcester's bravest. More than 12 hours passed before the conflageration was finally controlled. Then the nation mourned the fallen heroes at a ceremony attended by firefighters from across the country. In the weeks following the blaze, the building that had taken such a terrible toll on the city finally surrendered to a demolition crew, and the remnants of the old Cold Storage Warehouse were torn down and cleared away. Now, almost a year and a half later, the lot is vacant, with just a thin layer of gravel to mark the outline of where the six-story warehouse once stood. A fence now surrounds the site, and there's a kind of make-shift memorial: tributes, reminders, personal expressions of people touched by this tragedy. Worcester will never forget.\n\nWill the next winner of the White House be a matter for the courts? And when will the countdown be complete? It may be the greatest political mystery of all time. Two men - but only one will lead. 48 Hours covers the wait for a president. The race to decide the presidency is venturing further into uncharted territory, leaving the outcome, and history itself, on hold. In Palm Beach County, Fla., there will be a hand-counting of the ballots beginning Saturday, so this recount is sure to go until at least next week. And the outcome could be a long way from settled - overseas absentee ballots are still uncounted. The level of acrimony between the two camps is escalating with voter protests building, and lawsuits looming. Both the Bush and Gore campaigns are searching for any small opening, any angle to work that would pull the vote in their direction. In the annals of presidential races, is there anything that can compare with these last 48 hours? 48 Hours looks at the highs and lows, all the twists and turns for two candidates and two campaigns, on a wild election ride.\n\nForgiveness doesn't always come easily, even during a season of good will. In some cases, however, it can provide a chance to shed the burden of anger and move on with life. 48 Hours presents three stories of individuals who have overcome considerable obstacles to make peace with their past. The Prodigal Father: When Jon Dupre was 14, his father, a prominent attorney, walked out on the family. Correspondent Bill Lagattuta reports on how Dupre, who now has a family of his own, decided to look for his father after having not seen him for 20 years. A Soldier's Story: Correspondent Peter Van Sant reports that 30 years after the Vietnam War, Paul Reed was still tormented by the experience of having served. Then Reed found in his wartime knapsack something that was to have a dramatic impact on his life. My Dad's Killer: At age 15, Tim Streett of Indianapolis witnessed a murder in his family's driveway. Years later, Streett was still grieving and desperately unhappy. Then, one evening while driving, he had an epiphany.\n\nThey are women of distinction, from all walks of life, making a difference, doing so on their own terms, each with her own unique perspective. 48 Hours has chosen some \"great dames,\" if you'll pardon the expression (no disrespect intended.) They're not just talented and accomplished; their achievements are marked by sheer will and resiliency. These women have staying power. They demonstrate dignity and grace, style but also substance. They live life with a sense of fun as well as purpose. Dynasty's Queen: Joan Collins is the most popular difficult lady in television history. She knows that fame for her only comes with playing these types of characters. Her latest project: a television movie These Old Broads. Madame Secretary: Think you know Madeleine Albright?

They began dancing in the '30s as part of the famous Apollo Theatre and Te Cotton Club, and they're still at it. We get to know these high steppers in their old sto\n\nImagine you're living inside a bathroom for more than two years. And that the confinement is self-imposed. Sound implausible? That's the reality of a 27-year-old man who shared his experiences with 48 Hours. 48 Hours provides a rare view into obsessive-compulsive disorder with a profile of David. Once he studied philosophy in college; he dropped out two years ago when his fears overtook him. A Cell of His Own Choosing: David confines himself to one room, his parents' bathroom. Why? He fears he'll contaminate others. His parents feed him flattened food that can slide under the door. His parents wrestle with how to best help him. Eleventh Hour Chat Dr. Michael Jenike answered questions about treatment options on a 48 Hours chat after the show at 11 p.m. ET. Read the transcript here.

Believing you know who the killer is, but not being able to prove it. 48 Hours tracks two families who are desperate to find out what really happened when their relatives died. Kristine's Story: In the weeks before Kristine Kupka's disappearance in 1998, family and friends say Kristine had a new man in her life. Darshanand \"Rudy\" Persaud was her college instructor. One afternoon, Rudy reportedly picked up Kristine at her home. She was never seen again. Did Rudy have something to do with her disappearance? What Do You Think? Do you think Dick Dow and Rudy Persaud are getting away with murder? Add your post to the 48 Hours bulletin boards. Just An Accident? A family is torn apart by mysterious deaths. Nineteen years ago, Steven Dow and his mother Janet were incinerated in a car fire not far from their house. Some people believe that Janet's husband at the time had something to do with their deaths. Was it an accident or something more?\n\nThe Internet has become a haven for some of the oldest scams in the book. Among the criminal offenses in cyberspace, 48 Hours reports, are adoption fraud, pyramid schemes and Internet pen pals. Preying on Hope:The Mostroms thought the Internet was the answer to their frustrating search to adopt another child. But they found themselves caught in a web of deception and fraud that shattered their dreams. Prosperity at a Price: It was a deal that sounds too good to be true. An e-mail solicitation for easy money leads to a labyrinth of big promises and pyramid schemes. Forbidden Love: The Collins' were happy when their 14-year-old son found a friend online he could confide in. Tara Hulin was a 30-year-old mother of two who suffered from the same mental condition as Chad. But when the relationship became more than friendly, authorities stepped in. Was it love or sexual assault?\n\nIn the early morning hours of December 31, 1999, 10-year-old Krystal Surles and her friend Kaylene Harris, 13, were brutally attacked by a knife-wielding intruder, who slashed their throats. Kaylene died, but Krystal walked to a neighbor's house for help, and survived. Despite her injuries, she helped police identify the killer. Two days after the crime, police arrested a 35-year-old drifter named Tommy Lynn Sells. During questioning, Sells told police that he had committed dozens of murders over the past 20 years. An eighth-grade dropout who often made money as a carnie, he said he had committed his first murder in Hollywood, Calif., in a street fight. Sells said that he had killed people all over the country, from California to West Virginia. Harold Dow reports on a man who for 20 years got away with murder in a big way and the child whose courage put an end to the killings.\n\nOn Dec. 30, 1999, a drifter named Tommy Lynn Sells broke into a home in Del Rio, Texas, and brutally killed 13-year-old Kaylene Harris. Krystal Surles, 10 years old at the time, had her throat slit but managed to escape and go for help. Krystal helped authorities identify her attacker, eventually leading to Sells' capture. She also became the star witness in Sells' capital murder trial. While under arrest, Sells shocked authorities when he freely admitted that he had been crisscrossing the country for 20 years, murdering men, women, and children. His confession may have closed a 13-year-old case in Illinois. In 1987, Elaine Dardeen, seven months pregnant at the time, and her 3-year-old son, Peter, were found bludgeoned to death in their home. The shock of the attack caused Elaine to give birth. The newborn girl, who authorities believe was alive at the time, was also clubbed to death. Since this story was first broadcast early in 2001, authorities have linked him to 22 homicides.\n\nOver an 18-month period from 1962 to 1964, the city of Boston was terrorized by a serial killer, the infamous \"Boston Strangler.\" But in 1964, Albert DeSalvo confessed to the brutal killings of 13 women, and authorities and the city at large breathed a collective sigh of relief, believing the killer was finally behind bars. When he confessed, DeSalvo was a patient in a mental hospital, and his confession could not be used against him. With no evidence linking him to any of the 13 murders, DeSalvo was convicted of unrelated crimes and was sentenced to life in prison. Now, 36 years later, 48 Hours reports that some investigators, as well as the family of one victim, are not sure that DeSalvo was the killer. They believe DeSalvo lied in his confession, and they want to force the state to open the case.\n\nIn nice neighborhoods all over the country families are hiding lives of violence. According to the U.S. Justice Department, 1.5 million women are targets of domestic abuse - and the problem is not isolated to poor communities. As 48 Hours reports, some of the worst domestic violence may be found in the best of homes. Armed And Dangerous: Police officer Tori-Lynn Heaton, a former Miss Rhode Island, was trained to recognize and deal with domestic abuse. But when the abuser was her husband and fellow officer, she didn't know what to do. Unnecessary Roughness: Is there hope for batterers? Cheered for the punishment he dished out on the football field, former NFL superstar Mark Gastineau is now in a New York prison for the violence he inflicted on the women in his life. He now says faith and counseling have helped him understand his behavior.\n\nDespite leading the industrialized world in obesity, America is obsessed with being thin. Fashion magazines are filled with unrealistic - and for many, unattainable - images of the perfect body, fueling a billion-dollar industry of exercise fads, diet books and nutritional supplements. The Kindest Cut:Debbie Mackenzie was desperate to lose weight. So she decided to take a radical step: she got gastric bypass surgery. Did it work? Find out. Beauties' Ugly Secret: Famous for their pinup calendars, the Barbi Twins made a handsome living displaying their bodies. But they were hiding a dangerous diet secret. Now they reveal it.

At Your Own Risk: Margo Ellis lost 107 pounds; she says she owes it all to an herbal diet supplement. But Doug Hanson believes that same supplement is partly responsible for his wife's death. Is ephedra safe?\n\nLong before Mark Burnett ever dreamed of trapping 16 Survivors on a deserted island, he stranded 300 people in some of the most remote and forbidding places on Earth. The contest is called \"The Eco-Challenge\" and last year the seventh annual competition took place halfway around the world in Borneo, Malaysia. 48 Hours trails three teams of Americans as they take on physical and emotional challenges in a pursuit that few people would dare attempt. Contenders face 12 brutal days and sleepless nights of jungle trekking, whitewater paddling, sailing, swimming and biking over a 320-mile course. Team Earthlink, from Southern California, believes they can win it all. This foursome includes two seasoned race veterans, plus a millionaire couple from Malibu who agree to pay all race expenses for their chance to compete. It is costing them $70,000; will it cost them their marriage? 48 Hours follows the team led by Charlie Engle, a recovering drug and alcohol addict. During the race, Engle is forced to make a choice between his passion for racing and his battle against addiction. Inexperience didn't deter Team Goonies, a happy-go-lucky group of 30-somethings from Santa Monica, Calif. Last year, they watched the race on television, but this year, the gung-ho rookies will compete in it. To prepare for the race, this team quit their jobs, maxed out their credit cards and embarked upon a crash course in jungle survival. They say they're in it just to finish, but considering their skill level, they'll be lucky to even survive it. In all, 76 co-ed teams of four, representing 20 countries, believed they have what it takes to finish the race. The race was eventually won by Team Salomon/Eco-Internet, which won the race in 5 days, 23 hours, and 41 minutes. Despite the travails, all three teams profiled on the broadcast will be back in this year's race, which will take place in New Zealand in October.\n\nJerry Jones spent a decade behind bars proclaiming his innocence after being convicted of killing his wife. And with the help of his devoted daughters he got a second chance to clear his name. But as 48 Hours reports, Jones' freedom was short-lived. Two years after his release, he was again facing murder charges. In 1988, the Jones family seemed to be living the American Dream. Jerry, a successful pharmaceutical salesman, and his wife Lee were raising two teen-age daughters and a young son. But on the night of Dec. 3, Lee Jones met a gruesome fate when she was stabbed to death as she prepared to take a bath in their suburban Seattle home. Shortly after Lee's death, the stunned and grief-stricken children were hit with another tragedy: their father was being charged with murder.\n\nIn April, hundreds of thousands of high school seniors will have to decide which college and university to attend. One of the things they probably won't consider is safety on campus. 48 Hours looks at the hidden dangers of university life. A Deadly Haze: Last winter, Steven Petz, a freshman at Ferris State University in Michigan, was pressured into drinking 27 shots of liquor as part of his initiation into an unauthorized fraternity. He later died from alcohol poisoning. Six of his fraternity brothers were charged with crimes, including manslaughter. Will they be convicted? Sound The Alarm: It may be one of the best-kept secrets on college campuses. Almost 2,000 campus fires, like the one that claimed lives at Seton Hall University in New Jersey, occur each year. Seton Hall survivor Ken Simmons, who thought his only college worries would be over grades, describes his experience. 48 Hours reports that there are no national regulations requiring sprinklers on campus. Missng Bryan: Do universities do enough to watch students? Some parents say no. Find out about the case of one student who disappeared and was later found dead. His parents say the school delayed informing them that he was missing, and are suing the school.\n\n48 Hours reports on the strange world of sleep. According to the National Sleep Foundation, 7 of 10 adults say they have frequent sleep problems, while half have symptoms of insomnia at least a few nights a week. Researchers say that sleep is being directly linked to quality of life. 48 Hours looks at drowsy drivers - is it crime to drive tired? After her daughter was killed by a sleepy driver, Carole McDonnell is on a crusade to make it a crime to fall asleep while driving. Not sure why you're gaining weight? You may be \"sleep eating,\" raiding the refrigerator while you are asleep. One man let 48 Hours put cameras in his house. The cameras caught him eating a variety of foods, including brownies and soda. Later, he has no memory of his munching. Does snoring contribute to ADD? New research suggests that it could. Snoring is also linked to sleep apnea - a disorder that prevents the flow of oxygen from reaching the lungs. Sleep apnea causes sufferers to wake up repeatedly, destroying restful sleep. New research suggests that there may be a link between this problem and attention deficit disorder. For some people, sleep can be too much of a good thing. Those who suffer from Kleine-Levin Syndrome sometimes sleep for days or weeks at a time. No one knows the cause of this strange disease. Spencer Searin, a 15-year-old from Florida, talks about trying to overcome the problem. Patti Teel claims she has created a new way to get any child to sleep. She combines lullabies with relaxation techniques, and says her method is almost foolproof. 48 Hours puts the game to the test.\n\nBeing a celebrity isn't always easy. For some, the stress can be overwhelming. 48 Hours reports on five famous people who have faced crisis and persevered. A duchess, a race-car driver, a comedian, a boxer and a model reveal that their success did not grant them immunity from adversity. But all are making their way back from misfortune and mistakes. After being imprisoned for rape and banned for biting Evander Holyfield's ear, former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson says he is turning over a new leaf. He wants his children to look up to him. \"I want them to be people of dignity. I want them to have respect. I always show them the right thing to do. I tell them daddy is a monster on television but that is not who he is at home.\" Tyson, who dropped out of school in the 9th grade, has become an enthusiastic reader. Sarah Ferguson, The Duchess of York, earned contempt from the royal family and was humiliated by the press for her troubled marriage, financial problems and weight gain. \"They wanted me to be a certain way and I wouldn't fit into that,\" she says now. Exiled from the palace, Ferguson pulled herself up by her bootstraps, fought back and launched a lucrative career in America, as a spokesperson for Weight Watchers and other companies. Kyle Petty is a key member of a famous auto-racing family. Last May, Petty lost his 19-year-old son, Adam, in a race-car crash. Adam, who was just hitting his stride as a driver, died just a month after Kyle lost his grandfather, Lee, the family patriarch who helped build auto racing into the biggest spectator sport in the world today. Kyle and his family were devastated by the loss of Adam but were able to work through their grief. \"I hope I never get over it,\" Kyle says. \"I pray every night that it hurts as bad tomorrow as it hurts today because that way, then I know that I'm as close to him as I always have been.\" Taunted as \"overweight Kate\" when she was 12, Kate Dillon did what many self-conscious young girls do:\n\n48 Hours profiles ordinary people who have faced extraordinary tests of survival. Among the people you'll meet: Four people who survived a jumbo jet crash in Taiwan in 2000. They tell how they lived a terrible crash that killed almost half of the passengers when the jet crashed into some construction equipment during a storm. John Diaz: A producer who has made more than 1,000 music videos, Diaz was on the plane when it crashed. \"Right next to my feet the wall and the floor started to split, and then the next thing I know there's fire shooting right up next to my leg and that's when I undid my belt and stood up and screamed 'Move! Everybody move!'\" John Courtney and his wife, Deborah Brosnan, scientists traveling from a coral reef conference in Bali back to the U.S. By chance, the couple changed seats just before takeoff. If they hadn't, they would have died. They tell how they lived through the fireball that swept through the cabin after the jet crashed into some construction equipment. Once they exited the plane, they led a group of survivors to safety. \"You wonder if it really comes to a difficult situation, \"Will you panic, will you run away, will you stop and help? What will you do when your life is on the line,\" says Courtney. \"We were there so we got tested. We came through. Am I proud of myself? Yeah.\" John Wiggins, a salesman whose product is, ironically, airplane interiors. Although he survived, the experience affected him, and he says he doesn't know if he will be able to fly anytime soon. Also on the show: Tillie Tooter, an 84-year-old Floridian who survived more than three days trapped in her car, which had crashed off a highway into a swamp. \"Now everybody knows that in Florida, you've got terrifying alligators, you've got snakes, you've got all kinds of critters,\" she says. \"I was afraid to fall asleep because I felt that if anything crawled in, I could at least kick it away with my feet"
