        "text": "Can Jon Scheyer change the stigma around former Coach K assistants?\n\nWednesday’s news that Duke head men’s basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski will retire after the 2021-22 season sent shockwaves throughout the basketball community.\n\nThe all-time Division-I men’s wins leader will hang it up in 2022, shortly after he turns 75 and completes his 41st season at Duke, where he has guided the Blue Devils to five national championships.\n\n—Why Jon Scheyer will succeed at Duke\n\n—College basketball coaching changes ’21-22\n\n—Subscribe for premium HeatCheckCBB.com premium content\n\nMultiple reports surfaced shortly after that current Duke assistant Jon Scheyer is expected to be named the coach-in-waiting and will likely succeed Krzyzewski when he retires. Scheyer would join the long list of former Krzyzewski assistants who later became D-I head coaches.\n\nOverall, the tenures of these Krzyzewski-assistants-turned-head-coaches have been a mixed bag. The 12 coaches who took head jobs after assisting Coach K are a combined 2,367-2,028 (.539) overall. In their combined 147 seasons as head coaches, 32 have translated into NCAA Tournament appearances with an average of 0.88 wins per tournament. No former Krzyzewski assistant has reached the Final Four.\n\nBut although Krzyzewski’s former assistants have had their challenges, none of them have had the luxury of beginning their head-coaching careers at a program as prestigious as Duke. While Scheyer will have all of the resources to continue Duke’s dominance, questions will linger about whether a Krzyzewski disciple can become an elite head coach.\n\nBelow is the list of former Krzyzewski assistants who became first-time head coaches after their stints under Coach K.\n\nMike Brey\n\nDuke assistant: 1987-1995\n\nHead coach career W-L: 547-300 (.646)\n\nCurrent: Notre Dame head coach\n\nMike Brey has the strongest track record of any former Krzyzewski assistant. After eight years with Duke, Brey accept his first job as head coach with Delaware, taking the Blue Hens to the NCAA Tournament in 1998 and 1999. He used Delaware as a springboard to land the Notre Dame job in 2000. In the two decades since, Brey has coached four All-Americans, punched 12 March Madness bids, and is the winningest coach in school history.\n\nTommy Amaker\n\nDuke assistant/AHC: 1989-1997\n\nHead coach career W-L: 427-278 (.606)\n\nCurrent: Harvard head coach\n\nTommy Amaker has made three separate head-coaching stops since his time on the Duke staff. He took Seton Hall dancing in 2000, went to Michigan in 2001 and failed to punch a tournament bid in six seasons and has been at Harvard since 2008. A run of four consecutive NCAA Tournament trips from 2012 to 2015 is the highlight of Amaker’s career to date.\n\nMike Dement\n\nDuke assistant: 1982-1983\n\nHead coach career W-L: 329-368 (.472)\n\nFormer: UNCG head coach\n\nMike Dement spent a season under Krzyzewski at Duke in Coach K’s third year at the school.

Dement reached the tournament with Cornell in 1988 and was named the Ivy League’s coach of the year but failed to return to March Madness in his final 23 years of coaching.\n\nJohnny Dawkins\n\nDuke assistant/AHC: 1998-2008\n\nHead coach career W-L: 250-175 (.588)\n\nCurrent: UCF head coach\n\nJohnny Dawkins was elevated to associate head coach after one year as a Duke assistant.

In Dawkins’ third season at the helm, UCF nearly upset top-seeded Duke in the 2019 NCAA Tournament second round against Zion Williamson and RJ Barrett. Aubrey Dawkins, Johnny Dawkins’ son, was the team’s second-leading scorer that season.\n\nBob Bender\n\nDuke assistant: 1983-1989\n\nHead coach career W-L: 176-199 (.469)\n\nFormer: Memphis Grizzlies assistant\n\nAfter his time as a Coach K assistant, Bob Bender had two D-I head-coaching stints spanning a combined 14 seasons.

As a head coach, Collins guided Northwestern to its first-ever NCAA Tournament appearance and victory in 2017. However, it is still his only winning Big Ten season to date with a 49-100 (.329) conference record overall.\n\nDavid Henderson\n\nDuke assistant: 1996-2000\n\nHead coach career W-L: 85-93 (.478)\n\nFormer: Delaware head coach\n\nDavid Henderson played under Krzyzewski at Duke and enjoyed a 13-year professional career before joining Duke’s staff in 1996.

In 1995, Gaudet stepped in when Krzyzewski took a leave of absence due to a back injury. The Blue Devils were 9-3 and ranked 6th in the country but fell apart under Gaudet, going 4-15 the rest of the way and missing the tournament altogether.
