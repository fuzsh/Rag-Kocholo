In the league, he finished 6th in points and 2nd for rebounds.\n\nMike Virden - Football\n\nThe Ellsworth Community College Football Quarterback was a part of the 1987 National NJCAA Football Champions & 1988 Football Team. Arguably one of the most talented Ellsworth football teams in school history, the 1987 Panther squad simply dominated every opponent. Ellsworth was faster, more physical, and more athletic than any team they faced. Along with a focused and businesslike attitude made the Panthers unstoppable through all ten games. Virden routinely connected with his wide receivers, especially Steve Lester and James Bradley, and running back Ulysses Bentley. He was also the recipient of the Rod Mather Award during his time at Ellsworth Community College. Virden finished his collegiate career when he transferred to Boise State University (1989-1990).

The 1987 Panther squad simply dominated every opponent that season. The athleticism, focus, and businesslike attitude made the panthers unstoppable throughout all ten games. Special teams were no less spectacular with punt and kick returner James Bradley's exciting returns. In addition to being an excellent wide receiver and returner, Bradley was named a 1st team All-American as a punter. In 1988, Bradley would be named All-American as a wide receiver, making him the only Ellsworth football player to be named an All-American at two different positions.\n\n2019\n\nMario Galanakis - Wrestling: After becoming a prep four-time placer at the Iowa High School State Tournament, Mario continued his career at Ellsworth Community College.

The Panthers went 3-0 at the National Tournament that was held in Fort Dodge, IA. In the fall of 1976, the Panthers went 14-3 and were the Northern Juco Conference Champions as well as winners of the Waldorf Tournament. The spring of 1977 brought even more success to the Panther Softball Team. They finished with a record of 23-3-1 for an overall 37-6-1. They again captured the Northern Juco Conference Title as well as the Region XI Championship 2-1 over North Iowa of Mason City to advance to the NJCAA National Tournament. The Panthers found themselves down 1-0 in the Region XI Championship but managed to score two runs on a walk and three consecutive hits from Teri Kirk, Gloria Anderson, and Carol Faris. In the National Tournament, the Panthers won all three of their games en route to winning the championship.

Offensively, quarterback Mike Virden routinely connected with wide receivers Steve Lester and James Bradley, and running back Ulysses Bentley set an Ellsworth career rushing record that lasted more than 20 years. Linebackers Greg Taylor and Melvin Coleman, defensive backs James Vernon and Jason Juhl, and defensive linemen Robbie Harris and Jeff Herter were part of a defense that set school records for fewest rushing yards allowed (673) and fewest first downs allowed per game (7.9). Special teams were spectacular with punt and kick returner Bradley, and kicker Dan Miller was one of the nation’s leaders for extra points. Bradley was a 1987 All­-American as a punter, and in 1988 was named All-American at wide receiver, making him the only Ellsworth player to be All-American at two positions. In the RC Cola Bowl, Ellsworth bested third-rated William Rainey Harper 41-9. Two weeks later, the Panthers learned they had won the National Championship.\n\n- 1987 Football Roster\n\n1976 National Championship Football Team: The right combination of talent, timing, and good fortune helped the 1976 Panthers achieve one of the most memorable seasons in school history. Led by first-year Coach Vern Thomsen, the team went undefeated during the nine-game regular season and was awarded the NJCAA National Championship. After the regular-season finale, a 61-13 home win over Marshalltown Community College, there was no doubt in ECC coaches’ and players’ minds that the next step would be the Junior Rose Bowl. Facing Bakersfield College, winner of the California playoffs, the game was televised on Iowa Public Television. Even though the Junior Rose Bowl didn’t end the way the Panthers had hoped (it was a 29-14 Bakersfield victory), the national exposure helped Ellsworth build upon an already well-known reputation as a national powerhouse in junior college football. The NJCAA national title was still theirs, and offensive guard Reggie Hall was named All­-American, as was defensive lineman Darrell Hobbs. Quarterback Walter Grant earned honorable mention All-American.\n\n- 1976 Football Roster\n\n2015\n\nGary Rabe has been on the E-Club for the last 20 years and is the current E-Club president.
