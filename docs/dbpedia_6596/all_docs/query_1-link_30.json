        "text": "GASTONIA - Ivan \"Pudge\" Rodriguez wasn't the best player on his first professional team when he played for the 1989 Gastonia Rangers of the South Atlantic League.\n\nBut as Rodriguez becomes the third former Gastonia minor leaguer to be inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame on Sunday in Cooperstown, N.Y., longtime local baseball fan Brian Rushing welcomes the \"Father Knows Best\" moment he was taught back when Rodriguez was a 17-year-old rookie.\n\nBrian Rushing, then a 16-year-old student at North Gaston High, says his father Jerry Rushing knew greatness lay ahead for Rodriguez, even as his son thought many of his Gastonia teammates were better.\n\nIn truth, Rodriguez hit only .237 with seven home runs and 42 RBIs in 112 games in his first professional season out of Manati, P.R.\n\nBut Jerry Rushing, who died in 2013 and worked nearly 50 years at Burlington Industries, was a longtime Gastonia baseball fan who had previously seen future major-leaguers like Bob Robertson, Al Oliver, Mike Hargrove and Leon Durham among others play at historic Sims Legion Park. And he thought Rodriguez had what it took to be a major league star.\n\n\"Pudge was one of the few players my dad ever talked about,\" said Brian Rushing, now coordinator of athletics broadcasting and promotions at Belmont Abbey College. \"I was always reminded of the guys that came up previously. They were the standard bearers my dad always touted as the good ole days of minor league baseball in Gastonia.\n\n\"To him, Pudge was special. Being a catcher himself, dad always reminded me of how effortless his throws came from behind home plate. Sure, the throw carried to second differently, but as a 16-year-old, I was like 'Big deal!' Pudge couldn't be better than guys like Bob Boone, Bruce Benedict or Jody Davis (notable major league catchers of the 1980s). And he wasn’t at that time. But dad would always remind me that what Pudge owned behind the plate can’t be taught. And he was right!\"\n\nAt the time, Brian Rushing wasn't the only one who thought other Gastonia Rangers' players were better than Rodriguez.\n\nAfter going 92-48 to set a Gastonia professional record for wins in a season while winning the first- and second-half titles of the South Atlantic League North Division, four Rangers players were given postseason honors.\n\nNone of them was Rodriguez for a team that would eventual lose the SAL playoff championship series three games to one to the Augusta Pirates.\n\nEventual major leaguers Jeff Frye (second baseman) and Kevin Belcher (outfielder) were named all-league in addition to two players who never played in the majors - designated hitter Trey McCoy and first baseman Doug Cronk.\n\nRodriguez wasn't alone on the team in failing to be recognized before enjoying future greatness.\n\nFuture major league All-Stars Jose Hernandez (infielder) and Robb Nen (relief pitcher) also were members of the 1989 Rangers, as was 16-year veteran pitcher Darren Oliver.\n\nAnd, as it turned out, Rodriguez's .238 batting average that season proved to be the lowest of his 23-year professional career and he was promoted to the major leagues for the first time in 1991 - or less than two years after leaving Gastonia.\n\nRodriguez would go on to play in the most major league games of any former Gastonia minor leaguer (2,543) over a 21-year career with the Texas Rangers, Florida Marlins, Detroit Tigers, New York Yankees, Houston Astros and Washington Nationals.\n\nRodriguez will join a pair of teammates on Gastonia's first-ever professional team in the Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Gastonia-Loray Tigers of 1915, who moved from Newnan, Ga., in July of that year, featured eventual Hall of Famers Bill Terry and Chief Bender.\n\nTerry was a 16-year-old outfielder in his first professional season when he helped Gastonia win the Western Carolina League title. He later would play 1,721 major league games mostly at first base for the old New York Giants, hitting .401 in 1930 (still the last National Leaguer to hit .400) and winning a 1933 World Series title before being inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1954.\n\nBender pitched three times for the Gastonia in the playoffs after he'd been released by the Baltimore franchise of the short-lived Federal League late in the 1915 season. Already a 12-year major league pitching veteran and winner of three World Series with the old Philadelphia Athletics by the time he pitched for Gastonia, Bender was a 1953 Hall of Fame inductee.\n\nRichard Walker: 704-869-1841; twitter.com/jrwalk22"
