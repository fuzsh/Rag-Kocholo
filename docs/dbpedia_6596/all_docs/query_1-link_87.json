Because we are Trapani Shark… where dreams come true! Welcome, Tibor!

During the 2015/16 season, he played 10 games, averaging 2.4 points and 1.5 rebounds per game, also spending time in the D-League with the Idaho Stampede.\n\nAfter his overseas experience, Pleiss returned to Europe, signing with Galatasaray in Turkey for the 2016/17 season. He continued his European career with Valencia Basket (2017-2018) and finally with Anadolu Efes, where he has been playing since 2018.

I believe and hope that an announcement can be made tomorrow (today, ed). We have made a very important offer to Tibor Pleiss, an exceptional player, a great champion who will change the balance of our team and, I believe, of the LBA. Having a player like him would give us the decisive piece to make an assault on the Scudetto.\n\n“Of course, as a newly promoted player, this almost sounds like blasphemy, but I’m used to not setting myself any limits and I believe that the team we’re building has nothing to fear from Milan and Bologna.\n\nON JASMIN REPESA\n\n“We negotiate together. He helps me convince players like Galloway, Robinson, Petrucelli and Yeboah to come and join the Trapani project. The team needed to improve, it needed to make a leap in quality, but I think what we are doing is there for all to see. With Pleiss, we would be in the top three for the Scudetto, also because you know me, if we need an addition during the season to win the Scudetto, we will be ready.\n\nAccording to BeBasket, experienced guard Yakuba Ouattara will leave AS Monaco to sign with Paris Basketball.\n\nThe 32-year-old has spent 8 of the last 9 seasons with the Principality’s team, but has reportedly decided to move to another team in order to have a bigger role.\n\nLast year Ouattara averaged 4.2 points per game in Euroleague and 6 in BetClic Elite.\n\nD’Moi Hodge is a new player of Aris, as announced by the Greek team.\n\nThe guard spent his rookie season as a Two-Way Player for the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nAfter parting ways with the Lakers, Hodge played 28 games in the G League with the Rip City Remix (13.5 points, 4.8 rebounds and 2.2 steals)."
