        "text": "Two names on this list to keep an eye on in save-only leagues are Justin Martinez and Lucas Erceg, as either one (or both) may be on that other list come Tuesday. Martinez now has two saves this past week with Arizona, although I am a bit skeptical to believe he is the guy they want in the role the next two months. Certainly, the swing-and-miss ability and velo scream “potential future closer” but the walk rate just feels like it would be too big of an issue. Either way, the ceiling Martinez possesses is too exciting, especially in holds leagues, and is worth a look if he’s still on the wire in your league.\n\nErceg may not have the same long-term ceiling as Martinez, but he’s also a guy who can touch triple digits and also benefits from having lighter competition at the back end with Kansas City. Over his past 7.0 IP, Erceg has allowed just one baserunner while striking out eight. The team may prefer having him available before the ninth innings, which is fine for the sake of this article, but Erceg is currently my favorite RP option the Royals have and it’s not even that close anymore.\n\nNotes\n\nMichael Kopech has allowed just 1 hit and 0 walks since joining the Dodgers and already has 2 holds with his new team. He had actually started pitching better prior to being traded and now holds a 40.6% K-BB and 1.24 SIERA over his past 9.2 IP. He should continue seeing high-leverage work, and could very well work his way into save chances.\n\nFernando Cruz has been struggling since June and despite plenty of opportunity in that bullpen, it’s probably time to move on until he can regain his early-season form again. Over his past 16.1 IP he has a 8.8% K-BB, 27.8% CSW, and 4.51 SIERA all while posting an 8.27 ERA. Colin Holderman has also seen his season turn upside over his past 16.1 IP, as holds nearly identical numbers to Cruz with an 8.6% K-BB, 25.3% CSW, and 4.55 SIERA (with a 7.16 ERA). There’s still a lot of upside in these NL Central relievers, but the volatility has been rearing its ugly head recently. (EDIT: Holderman was placed on the IL today)\n\nAnthony Bender’s velocity has been much better over his past 15 outings, and the results approve. Over this stretch, Bender holds a 30.4% K-BB, 36% CSW, and 1.82 SIERA while allowing just one earned run. Not only is he pitching better, but he’s now a top 3 reliever in this Marlins bullpen after the trade deadline, and may be the most trustworthy option there.\n\nSpeaking of velocity improvements, Drew Rasmussen debuted yesterday and was able to sit at 98 mph over two innings of work, which is certainly interesting for a guy coming back from Tommy John surgery who was sitting at 95.5 mph in 2022-23. Obviously shorter outings out of the bullpen are a factor in the velo uptick, but that shouldn’t matter to us as it looks like Rasmussen could be a huge help in holds leagues down the stretch.\n\nIf you would like more daily reliever updates, please check out our Reliever Ranks series."
