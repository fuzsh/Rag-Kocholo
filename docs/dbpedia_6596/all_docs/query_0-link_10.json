        "text": "Celebrating their 25th anniversary, members of the 1989–1990 Missouri Valley Conference Tournament-champion Illinois State men’s basketball team gathered for a Redbird for Life (RB4L) reunion September 6 at Redbird Arena.\n\nThe team, which was 6-9 at midseason, won nine of its final 12 regular-season games to tie for second place in the Missouri Valley Conference. Illinois State then beat Southern Illinois in front of a record crowd at Redbird Arena to win the last-ever on-campus Valley Tournament championship. The Redbirds went on to meet defending-champion Michigan in the NCAA Tournament.\n\n“That whole year was nothing but great memories. These players were incredible,” said former men’s basketball head coach Bob Bender. “Looking at them now, it is amazing to think that when I came in, a lot of them were seniors in college. Now, seeing them with their families, and seeing the success they’ve had and where they are in their lives, it’s not surprising.”\n\nPlayers, coaches, managers, and staff from the 1989–1990 team gathered for a social in the Redbird Arena Legends Room before taking a tour of the Richard and Fran Owen Strength and Conditioning Center and the Franke Family Illinois State Basketball Locker Room. The group also attended Redbird football’s home game against Mississippi Valley State."
