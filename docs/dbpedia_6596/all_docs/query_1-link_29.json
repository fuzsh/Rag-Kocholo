        "text": "An extremely gifted, versatile performer adept at both comedy and drama, actress/singer Katey Sagal became a household name in the late 1980s as the fabulously brazen, undomesticated Peg Bundy on the enduring Fox series Eine schrecklich nette Familie (1987). During its lengthy run she received three Golden Globe and two American Comedy Award nominations. As popular and identifiable as her Peg Bundy persona was, Katey assertively moved on after the show went off the air, not only starring in other sitcoms and television movies, but portraying characters that were polar opposites of the outrageous role that first earned her nationwide attention. For example, in 2008 she took on the role of Gemma Teller Morrow, the matriarch of a Hell's- Angels-esque California biker gang, on the series Sons of Anarchy (2008), and in 2011 her portrayal earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress in the Television Series--Drama.\n\nCatherine Louise Sagal was born on January 19, 1954, to director and singer Sara Zwilling and noted television and film director Boris Sagal. The Los Angeles native began performing at age 5 and studied voice and acting at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, California.\n\nA singing waitress during her \"salad\" years, she started performing with the band \"The Group With No Name,\" then caught a break after hooking up with Gene Simmons and his 1970s rock band KISS. In the meantime, she gained valuable experience as a backup recording singer for Simmons and other established stars like Bob Dylan, Olivia Newton-John, Etta James, and Tanya Tucker. She was also dynamic performing live with diva Bette Midler as one of her \"Harlettes\" in Bette's wildly avant-garde stage shows during the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nIn 1985, while performing on stage in a musical, she was spotted by talent agents who subsequently cast her as Mary Tyler Moore's feisty co-worker Jo Tucker in Mary (1985), a short-lived comedy series. From that point on she focused on film and television. In 1987 she won the role of voluptuous \"housewife\" Peg Bundy in the irreverent comedy Eine schrecklich nette Familie (1987), and the rest is history.\n\nIn addition to her busy on-camera scheduling, Katey has retraced her steps to her first love: singing and songwriting. With the support of her record label Valley Entertainment, she released the album \"Room\" in 2004 that combined classics like \"Feel a Whole Lot Better\" and \"(For the Love of) Money\" with original songs she penned, including \"Life Goes Round,\" \"Daddy's Girl,\" and \"Wish I Were a Kid.\" \"Room\" is her first CD since her 1994 debut \"Well.\"\n\nIn her post-Bundy career, Katey has continued to demonstrate a strong range, playing a much more responsible parent in the popular sitcom Meine wilden Töchter (2002), co-starring the late John Ritter and valiantly moving to single-household-head after Ritter's sudden passing in 2003 with highly successful results.\n\nShe has earned earned equally-fine kudos for her television movies like Eine betrügerische Hochzeit (1998), a charming romantic comedy that also co-starred John Ritter, God's New Plan (1999), a tearjerker in which she played a dying mother, and the Disney offerings Das Haus der Zukunft (1999) and Herr Schulleiterin (1998). The voice of Turanga Leela, the beautiful one-eyed sewer mutant in the animated series Futurama (1999), she has also guested on Ghost Whisperer - Stimmen aus dem Jenseits (2005), Lost (2004), Boston Legal (2004), CSI: Vegas (2000), and Eli Stone (2008). Feature films have included Traumfrau vom Dienst (1987), Der Preis der Gefühle (1988), the Sundance Film Festival favorite Dropping Out (2000), Following Tildy (2002), and the indie I'm Reed Fish (2006).\n\nPlaying Jack's mother in a live-action/adventure retelling of Jack and the Beanstalk (2009) that also featured the talents of Christopher Lloyd, James Earl Jones, and Chevy Chase, Katey's more recent efforts include recurring role on TV's Lost (2004), a role in the mini-series The Bastard Executioner (2015) and a regular role in the series Superior Donuts (2017). She would also join the cast of the sitcom Die Conners (2018) as a love interest to widower Dan John Goodman.\n\nFollowing brief marriages to musician Freddie Beckmeier, Fred Lombardo, and former Steppenwolf drummer and \"Mighty Ducks\" hockey film advisor Jack White, Katey resides in the Los Angeles area with fourth husband writer/producer/director/creator Kurt Sutter, whose acclaimed work includes The Shield: Gesetz der Gewalt (2002) and the offbeat Sons of Anarchy (2008), which Sutter created. She had three children by White: Ruby (died at birth), Sarah, and Jackson; and one daughter by Sutter, Esme Louise.\n\nLauren Tom is an Obie Award-winning actress, known for her roles as a dutiful daughter in the film The Joy Luck Club, as Ross's girlfriend, Julie, on the classic NBC sitcom Friends, and most recently as Mrs. Tran on Supernatural. Lauren also lent her voice talents on the animated series Futurama as the much loved character of Amy.\n\nRecently, Lauren starred as a series regular in Andi Mack on The Disney Channel from 2016-2019. She also can be seen in the series, Guillermo Del Toro's Trollhunters and 3Below.\n\nNext up, Lauren can be seen in a recurring role in the Amazon series, Goliath, alongside Billy Bob Thornton.\n\nShe has also appeared in the films, Grandma with Lily Tomlin, Bad Santa, In Good Company, When a Man Loves a Woman, Mr. Jones, With Friends Like These, Catfish in Black Bean Sauce, and Manhood.\n\nOn television, Lauren was a series regular as Mai on the ABC series Men in Trees, NBC's DAG as Delta Burke's secretary, Ginger Chin and on ABC's Grace Under Fire with Brett Butler. She also did a recurring stint on Showtime's series Barbershop.\n\nOn Broadway, she has appeared in A Chorus Line, Hurlyburly and Doonesbury, and has worked with directors such as Peter Sellars and Joanne Akalaitis at the Goodman and Guthrie Theaters, the La Jolla Playhouse and the Kennedy Center.\n\nHer one-woman show, 25 Psychics, an engaging, humorous look at her quest for inner peace premiered at HBO'S U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen. The show received Dramalogue Awards for Best Performance and Best Direction.\n\nLauren's other voice work can be heard in the animated series King of the Hill, Codename: Kids Next Door, Teacher's Pet, Rocket Power, Max Steel, Batman, Superman, Kim Possible, Baby Clifford, American Dragon and the animated home video Mulan II...\n\nShe has also published personal essays in Brain, Child Magazine, East West Woman, Strut, Freshyarn.com, and is currently writing a book based on these essays."
