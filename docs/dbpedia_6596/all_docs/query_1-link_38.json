        "text": "nducted into the Keene State Alumni Athletic Hall of Fame in 2004 as a member of the 1989-90 women’s basketball team, Renee Bernier has the distinction of being an individual inductee this year.\n\n“To be inducted as an individual and a team member is super. It just shows how special our team was,” Bernier said. “I don’t think I’d be going in individually if we didn’t have such an amazing team.”\n\nGreat teams are made up of great players, and Renee Bernier was certainly one of those during her outstanding three-year (1987-90) Keene State career. Joining the Owls after playing a season at the University of New Hampshire, Bernier was the sparkplug and emotional leader of a KSC team that captured a pair of ECAC championships and earned the program’s lone NCAA berth in her final season.\n\nAlong the way, the 5’-4” guard filled up the Keene State record book. Despite playing just three seasons, the Londonderry native still ranks third in scoring (1,325 points), second in steals (209) and sixth in assists (304) on KSC’s all-time career lists.\n\nBut any one who saw Bernier play realized there was more to her game than just numbers. “Renee was such a competitor for her size,” said current KSC Coach Keith Boucher, who had the opportunity to coach Bernier in her last season. “She’d get hammered sometimes going to the basket and be the first one off the floor.”\n\n“I was just a feisty player that never gave up,” said Bernier, who credits former Owl coach John Lemieux for pushing her to become a better player. “I never wanted to be out of a game.”\n\nCompeting with talented players like Michelle Zeigler ’91 and Hall of Fame guard Tina Gonyea ‘90 also brought out the best in Bernier. Ironically, Bernier missed seven games her senior season with a broken finger after running into a pick set in practice by Zeigler.\n\nReturning to the team for the semifinals of the New England Collegiate tournament, Bernier, using her left hand, still managed to finish the game with 13 points in a win over Bridgeport that catapulted the Owls into the finals. Although KSC lost in the championship, it was still rewarded with an at-large berth to the NCAA tournament.\n\n“Going to the NCAAs was our goal,” said Bernier, a three-time All-NECC guard. “You’ve couldn’t ask for a better way to end a career.”\n\nLiving in Wolfeboro with her husband Peter and children Renee and Michael James, Bernier has continued to be involved in the sport. She served as an assistant and head coach at Kingswood High, and most recently joined the staff at Brewster Academy."
