        "text": "Men's Basketball Travels to Great Eight Classic\n\nHuskies face top-ranked Connecticut in the first round.\n\nNovember 30, 1998\n\nTue.- Wed.\n\nDec. 1 & 2\n\nUW at Great Eight Classic\n\nUnited Center (19,200)\n\nChicago, Ill.\n\nTues., Dec. 1\n\nUW vs. Connecticut\n\n6:30 p.m. CST (4:30 p.m. PST)\n\nThe 14th-ranked Washington Huskies (4-0) won three games in three days to win the Big Island Invitational, capped by a 76-60 championship game victory over Georgia Tech on Sunday. They survived a 4,299-mile flight from Hilo to Chicago. Now they face their most daunting task, playing top-ranked Connecticut (4-0) in the Great Eight Classic on Tuesday, Dec. 1 at the United Center in Chicago, Ill.\n\nWashington has beaten a No. 1 team only once in 22 tries, defeating UCLA 69-68 on Feb. 22, 1979 in Seattle. The UW is in the midst of a treacherous six-game road trip that covers 7,000 air miles during a two-week span. In Chicago, Washington seeks to avenge a 75-74 loss to Connecticut in the East Regional semifinal that ended its season.\n\nThe UW posted a 20-10 record in 1998, earning its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 1986. The Hukies advanced to the Sweet 16 with victories over Xavier (69-68) and Richmond (81-66).\n\nFrequent Flyers: The Huskies will rack up over 7,000 air miles during a two-week span, beginning with a flight to Hawai'i via Los Angeles on Monday, Nov. 23. Following the three-game Big Island Invitational, the Huskies endured a 4,299-mile trip to Chicago via Los Angeles.\n\nWashington departed Hilo on Sunday evening at 12:10 a.m. Central Time and arrived in the Windy City on Monday, Nov. 30 at 12:52 p.m. Central Time. That is not the ideal situation to prepare for an encounter with the nation's No. 1 team. But adrenaline and the desire for revenge should fuel Washington against UConn.\n\nThe Huskies return to Seattle on Wednesday, Dec. 2, completing a 6,971-mile journey. They then set out on a much shorter trip, visiting Boise, Idaho on Dec. 5 and Spokane, Wash. on Dec. 8 to play Gonzaga.\n\n32 Days Between Home Dates: Washington won its home opener, posting a 70-63 victory against UNC Wilmington on Nov. 16. The Huskies don't return home to Edmundson Pavilion until Dec. 19 when they host New Mexico State.\n\nVarying Venues: The Huskies face a drastically different setting when they visit Chicago. After playing three games in Hilo's humble 3,000-seat Afook-Chinen Civic Auditorium they meet top-ranked Connecticut in the spacious, 19-200-seat United Center which houses the six-time NBA champion Chicago Bulls.\n\nTV/Radio: The Great Eight matchup with Connecticut marks Washington's debut on ESPN, Tuesday, Dec. 1 at 6:30 p.m. Central Time (4:30 p.m. PST). All UW men's basketball games are broadcast live on KOMO Radio (AM 1000) and its affiliates by play-by-play announcer Bob Rondeau. Every radio broadcast can be accessed via the internet at: http://www.broadcast.com/sports/ncaa/washington/\n\nProbable Husky Starting Lineup:\n\nWashington Huskies\n\n(4-0, 0-0 in Pacific-10 Conference)\n\nPos.-No. Name Hgt.

The UW lost 87-61 on Jan. 3, 1989 in Seattle.\n\nWashington's 1999 schedule features 14 games against 1998 postseason competitors. Included are games against competitors from the 1998 Final Four (Stanford), Elite Eight (Arizona, UConn) and Sweet 16 (UCLA) along with NCAA teams New Mexico and Saint Louis.\n\nPoll Patter: The Washington men's basketball is ranked 16th in the ESPN/USA Today poll released Monday. The UW was No. 16 in last week's Associated Press poll. The Huskies opened the season in the No. 14 spot of both the Associated Press and ESPN/USA Today polls, their first preseason ranking in 14 years. The last time a Washington team received preseason mention in the AP media poll was a No. 8 ranking on Nov. 27, 1984.\n\nThis is the first time the Huskies have been recognized by the AP at any juncture of the season since Dec. 30, 1984 when they were No. 15. That Marv Harshman-coached Washington team featured Detlef Schrempf and was coming off a Sweet 16 appearance in the 1984 NCAA Tournament. The Huskies were not listed in the final 1998 AP poll, but concluded the season ranked No. 24 in the ESPN/USA Today coaches' poll.\n\nWashington is scheduled to play five teams in the top-25, including two of the top three. Connecticut, which defeated the UW 75-74 in the NCAA Tournament, is ranked No. 2 by the AP and No. 3 by ESPN/USA Today. Washington has a rematch against Connecticut on Dec. 1 at the Great Eight Classic in Chicago, Ill.\n\nStanford, a Final Four qualifier with all five starters returning, is No. 3 in the AP poll and No. 2 in the ESPN/USA Today rankings. Washington meets the Cardinal on Jan. 23 at Maples Pavilion and again on Feb. 18 in Seattle. The Huskies have eight games scheduled against teams ranked in both Top-25 polls. Numerous periodicals have also projected Washington in their preseason rankings.\n\nPublication UW No. 1 Other Pac-10 Athlon's Elite 8 Stanford UCLA (round of 32) Basketball News 9th Duke Stanford (3), Arizona (18), Cal (20) Blue Ribbon 13th Duke Stanford (3), Arizona (14), UCLA (17) Lindy's 7th Stanford None Preview Sports 18th Duke Stanford (2), Arizona (8), UCLA (10) Sport 18th Duke Stanford (4), Arizona (9), UCLA (13) Sports Illust. 8th Stanford UCLA (11) The Sporting News 27th Conn.

Stanford (3), Arizona (15), UCLA (18)\n\nHigh-Ranking Foes: Washington has a 1-21 all-time record against No. 1-ranked opponents. The lone UW win was a 69-68 upset of UCLA on Feb. 22, 1979 in Seattle. The last time the Huskies played a top-ranked team was on Jan. 3, 1989 when they lost 87-61 to Duke in Seattle. That Duke team had current UW head coach Bob Bender on its staff as an assistant coach. Washington has a 56-159 record in all-time meetings with ranked opponents, including a 12-44 mark during the 1990s. The Huskies are 23-92 all-time against Top-10 foes and 3-19 in the '90s.\n\nThe Connecticut Series:\n\nConnecticut won the only meeting with Washington, a last-second, 75-74 decision on March 19, 1998 at the East Regional semifinal in Greensboro.\n\nWashington has an 8-3 all-time record against Big East Conference members, having played Connecticut (0-1), Miami (3-0), Pittsburgh (2-0), Providence (1-0), West Virginia (1-0), Notre Dame (1-1) and Villanova (0-1).\n\n13th-year Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun his 1-0 against Washington while sixth-year Coach Bob Bender is 0-1 against UConn and Calhoun.\n\nThe UWmen seek to avoid the fate of the Washington women's team which suffered a 101-81 loss to the No. 1 UConn women, Saturday in Connecticut.\n\nDog Fight: Last spring's meeting marked the first time that Washington played against a similarly nicknamed opponent. Washington has never played the Huskies of Northeastern or Northern Illinios. Making its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 1986, Washington was a veritable mutt compared with the postseason pedigree of Connecutict which made its fifth trip to the Sweet 16 during the 1990s. Connecticut had been to the NCAAs six times since the previous UW berth in 1986. Washington competed in the round of 16 for the first time since 1984, its fifth Sweet 16 berth overall.\n\nThe Last Meeting-Connecticut 75, Washington 74 (NCAA East Regional Semifinal, March 19, 1998; Greensboro, N.C.): Richard Hamilton scored 22 points, including a put-back basket as time expired that lifted sixth-ranked Connecticut to a 75-74 win in an NCAA Tournament East Regional semifinal contest at the Greensboro Coliseum. Washington, playing in the Sweet 16 for the first time since 1984, concluded the season with a 20-10 record. UConn advanced to the regional finals, losing 75-64 to North Carolina.\n\nDonald Watts tallied 22 points for Washington and gave his team a 74-73 lead on a long 3-pointer with 33 seconds remaining. Connecticut took possession and missed two shots inside the final eight seconds. Jake Voskuhl missed a short shot in the lane that Hamilton rebounded and shot. That shot also missed, but the rebound settled back into Hamilton's hands. He quickly released a fade-away shot from the middle of the lane for the game winner. Hamilton scored 18 points in the second half.\n\nKhalid El-Amin added 19 points for UConn which led 47-39 at halftime. The lead was 64-55 with 10:16 to play before the UW rallied. Todd MacCulloch registered his Pac-10 leading 15th double-double of the season for the UW, amassing 18 points and 10 rebounds. Deon Luton had 17 points for Washington.\n\nHigh Hopes: The 14th-ranked Huskies return four starters and nine letterman from a team that came within one second of the Elite Eight and was ranked No. 24 in the final ESPN/USA Today poll. Returning talent represents 85-percent of the points from the 1998 team that averaged 78.7 points per game, the highest figure since 1976. The high-scoring trio of seniors Todd MacCulloch (18.6) and Donald Watts (16.9) along with junior Deon Luton (15.4) returns after combining for 50.8 points per outing last season. MacCulloch, a first-team All-Pac-10 center, led the nation in field goal shooting the last two years (67.6% in 1997, 65.0% in 1998) and is a two-time Playboy All-American. Watts and Luton were both 1998 honorable mention All-Pac-10 selections. Numerous publications have included Washington in their preseason polls, some of them projecting the Huskies as a Top-10 team.\n\nSweet Season: \"Sweet.\" How better to describe a 1998 season during which Washington returned to the NCAA Tournament after a 12-year absence, advancing to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 1984? The Huskies completed the campaign with a 20-10 record, their first 20-win season since 1987. They finished fourth in the Pac-10 with an 11-7 mark. Washington garnered its first NCAA Tournament invitation since 1986 and proceeded to defeat Xavier and Richmond before a last-second loss to Connecticut.\n\nThe UW improved its record during each of Coach Bob Bender's first five seasons. His inaugural team in 1994 had a 5-22 record followed by a 10-17 mark in 1995, 16-12 in 1996, 17-11 in 1997 and 20-10 last year. The improvement has been difficult due to the parellel rise of the Pacific-10 Conference which produced two of the last four NCAA champions and advanced four teams to the Sweet 16 each of the last two seasons.\n\nReturning Talent: Four starters and nine lettermen from last year's NCAA Tournament team return. Joining that group is 6-6 sophomore forward Greg Clark who red-shirted his first year at Washington after transferring from Long Beach State. Clark was one of the West's most-recruited athletes as a player at Grossmont High School in San Diego, Calif. The Huskies boast a terrific trio of 7-foot senior center Todd MacCulloch, senior guard Donald Watts and junior guard Deon Luton.\n\nA two-time Playboy All-American, MacCulloch led the nation in field goal shooting each of the last two years (67.6% in 1997, 65.0% in 1998). He was a first-team All-Pac-10 selection while Watts and Luton received honorable mention conference acclaim. Last year's team was the highest scoring Husky outfit since 1976, averaging 78.7 points per contest. MacCulloch (18.6), Watts (16.9) and Luton (15.4) combined to average 50.8 points an outing, making them the second-highest scoring trio in Husky history behind only the 1972 group of Steve Hawes (21.7), Charles Dudley (16.5) and Louie Nelson (15.1) who averaged 53.3 points. Those three all eventually played in the NBA.\n\nSophomore forward Thalo Green sparked a late-season surge after his insertion into the starting lineup. He replaced Patrick Femerling for the final three regular-season games and the Tournament. The Huskies responded with a 5-1 record in his starts, during which Green averaged 8.7 points and 2.7 assists. Junior Chris Walcott, a 6-8 forward, also emerged at the end of last season. He scored a career-high 14 points in the critical upset of No. 18 UCLA. Sophomore guards Dan Dickau, Michael Johnson and Bryan Brown return with a year of collegiate experience under their belts. Dickau will likely assume the starting point guard position vacated by Jan Wooten. Junior walk-on Andrew Moritz provides depth for the guard corps.\n\nDepartures: Only three players from last year's team will not return, including starting point guard Jan Wooten who averaged 5.7 points and 2.7 assists per game in 1998. Another point guard, Chris Thompson, has used up his eligibility and will join the Husky staff as a student assistant coach. Patrick Femerling, a 7-1 center averaged 5.7 points and ranked second on the team with 6.1 rebounds per game. He decided to forego his senior season and signed in July with a team from Berling of the professional league in his native Germany.\n\nNewcomers: The Washington roster is bolstered by the addition of three scholarship freshman recruits and two invited walk-ons. The Huskies signed one player at each position, inking 6-3 guard Senque Carey and 6-5 forward Grant Leep in the early period last November and 6-9 center Marlon Shelton during June. A native of East Palo Alto, Calif., Carey prepped at St. Francis High School. He averaged nearly 25 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists as a senior, helping the team to a 25-8 record and a runner-up finish in the Northern California championships. He was named the 1998 regional Player of the Year and was twice voted MVP of the West Catholic Athletic League.\n\nCarey was rated 15th in the Long Beach Press Best in the West poll. Leep hails from the same Mount Vernon (Wash.) High School that produced Mark Hendrickson, a two-time All-Pac-10 performer from Washington State. Leep averaged 17.3 points as a senior and earned all-state accolades. He led his team to the state semifinals each of his final two years. Shelton is the son of former NBA and Oregon State standout Lonnie Shelton. Marlon posted 12-point, 11-rebound and 4-blocked shot per game averages as a senior at Rochester (Mich.) High School. He has an 88-inch (7-4) wingspan and will fill the backup center role vacated by Patrick Femerling. Joining the team as an invited walk-on is freshman Michael Westphal, the son of current Seattle Sonic coach and former NBA all-star Paul Westphal.\n\nMichael totalled 15 points and six rebounds per game at Chaparral High School in Scottsdale, Ariz. Freshman Brian Kovacevich, a 6-10 center from Fife (Wash.) High School, also joined the team as an invited walk-on. A field of 16 Husky hopefuls (15 legitimate contenders plus local KING TV sportscaster Gaard Swanson) participated in the sixth-annual Washington walk-on tryouts on Oct. 22 at Edmundson Pavilion. Two players earned roster spots with their performances during the open tryouts, sophomore Jajuan Winesbury, a 6-7 forward from Steilacoom (Wash.) High School and freshman Travis Duty, a 6-4 guard from Seattle's O'Dea High School.\n\nShootin' Luton: Junior Deon Luton was voted MVP of the Big Island Invitational after scoring 41 points on 55-percent shooting 916-29), including 46-percent 3-point accuracy (6-13). Luton was a 1998 honorable mention All-Pac-10 selection. Last year he accounted for over half (75-of-147) of Washington's 3-pointers. Luton converted 5-of-7 treys in the NCAA second-round win over Richmond.\n\nHe had three 3-pointers and hit a 17-foot jumper with 11 seconds remaining that proved to be the game-winning basket in the first-round against Xavier. Luton hit a school single-game record seven 3-pointers at USC on Jan. 29. He became the school single-season leader with 75 treys last year. Luton ranks second among all-time Huskies with 109 career 3-pointers. The school career record is 119 set by Eldridge Recasner (1987-90).\n\nWonderful Watts: Senior Donald Watts drastically raised his level of play last year, earning honorable mention All-Pac-10 acclaim in the process. He ranked second on the team with 16.9 points per game. That figure nearly doubled his sophomore season's average of 8.9 points. Watts reached the 20-point plateau on 13 occasions after entering the 1998 season with a career-high of 19 points. Watts shot 47.6 percent from the field (156-328) after hitting 22- and 36-percent, respectively during his first two years. Watts led the team with 107 assists and twice tallied a career-high 28 points, against Arizona and California. His 506 total points were 182 more than the 324 he scored in his first two seasons combined. He is the son of former NBA standout Don \"Slick\" Watts.\n\nSonics & Sons: Four former Seattle SuperSonics have soncs on the 1999 Washington basketball roster. The list of former NBA players (and sons) includes, Fred Brown (Bryan), Lonnie Shelton (Marlon), Slick Watts (Donald) and Paul Westphal (Michael). Fred Brown is the Sonics' all-time leading scorer with 14,018 points. Paul Westphal played during the 1980-81 season in Seattle and returned this summer as head coach. Slick Watts led the NBA in assist and steals in 1976. Notable: Washington became the second straight Pacific-10 Conference member to capture the Big Island Invitational (Hilo, Hi.) championship, following Stanford which parlayed a 1997 Invitational championship into a 1998 Final Four run . . . Washington possesses a much deeper bench this season with the reservers accounting for 42-percent (125-of- 296) of the team's scoring. Last season's squad got only 20percent of its points 469-of-2359 from reserves . . . Sixth-year Coach Bob Bender evened his record at Washington with the victory over Georgia Tech on Sunday. Bender, who opened his Husky coaching career with a 15-39 mark after two seasons, has a 57-33 record over his last four seasons . . . The Huskies are 3-0 this season when outshooting their opponents to continue a trend. Washington has won the last 21 games when its field goal percentage was superior to its opponent, including a perfect 18-0 mark last season . The last team to defeat the Huskies despite a lower shooting figure was Nebraska, a 67-63 NIT first-round winner on March 13, 1997.\n\nLast Game: Washington 76, Georgia Tech 60 (Nov. 29, 1998; Hilo, Hi.) - Tournament MVP Deon Luton scored 14 of his team-high 16 points in the first half as 16th-ranked Washington took control early during a 76-60 victory over previously-undefeated Georgia Tech in the championship game of the Big Island Invitational. The Huskies led by as many as 19 points in the first half en route to a 40-28 halftime advantage. The Yellow Jackets never drew closer than nine points in the second half. Washington's stingy defense forced 17 turnovers and limited Tech to 37-percent shooting (19-51). Jason Floyd scored 22 points to lead the Yellow jackets who also got 13 from Tony Akins. Donald Watts totalled 15 points for the Huskies. Alll-tournament selection Todd MacCulloch posted his entire 13-point output in the second half.\n\nRoad Accomodations: Washington Media Relations assistant Dan Lepse will travel with the team and be available to handle any media requests. Upon their arrival in Chicago, Ill. at 2 p.m. CST on Monday, Nov. 30, the Huskies will stay at the Hyatt Regency O'Hare-Phone: (847) 696-1234 Fax: (847) 698-0139. Messages can also be left on Lepse's office voice mail: (206) 685-3120.\n\nSigned, Sealed, Delivered: Following are summaries of the two players who signed letters of intent to attend Washington during the early signing period in November.

On Feb. 5 at Arizona, he scored his 1,000th point to become the 25th player in Washington history to reach the 1,000-point plateau. No. 15 on the UW list is Andra Griffin (1978-81) with 1,294 points.\n\nPac-10 Pride: In each of the last two seasons the Pacific-10 Conference advanced four teams to the Sweet 16, more than any other league. Arizona, Stanford and UCLA, which reached the last two rounds of 16, were joined last spring by Washington and by California in 1997. Two of the last four national champions came from the Pac-10 (UCLA in 1995, Arizona in 1997).\n\nHusky Talk: Tune in to KOMO (1000 AM) every Tuesday night at 6 p.m. for \"Husky Talk,\" a half-hour call-in and interview show featuring head coach Bob Bender and KOMO's Bob Rondeau.\n\nPractice Policy: Washington conducts daily practices that are open to the media and the public.

Fifth-year Coach Bob Bender ranks fourth among all-time Washington coaches with 68 victories. On Feb. 12 he posted his 62nd win and moved past Andy Russo (1986-89) into the No. 4 spot. Bender's overall Husky record is 67-71. He will be in the No. 4 spot for a long time as the third position is held by Tippy Dye (1951-59) who recorded 156 victories.\n\nNotable: MacCulloch (18.6), Donald Watts (16.7) and Deon Luton (15.3) account for 64-percent (50.6) of the team's offense (78.8) and are the second-highest scoring trio in Husky history, trailing only the 1972 group of Steve Hawes (21.7), Charles Dudley (16.5) and Louie Nelson (15.1) who averaged 53.3 points . . . Washington's current 78.8-point scoring pace is the school's highest since the 1976 squad averaged 80.2 points per game . . . Deon Luton has accounted for over half of the team's 3-pointers, hitting 74 of Washington's 145 treys.\n\nUW in the NCAA: In its ninth NCAA Tournament, Washington has a 10-9 all-time record in tourney play. The Huskies' previous two trips to the Tournament resulted in quick, first-round exits. They lost 72-70 to Michigan State on Mar. 13, 1986 in Dayton, Ohio and 66-58 to Kentucky on Mar. 14, 1985 in Salt Lake City Utah. The last extended run into the NCAA Tournament was in 1984 when the Huskies defeated Nevada-Reno and Duke before losing to Dayton in the Sweet 16. The UW reached the final eight four times (1943, 1948, 1951, 1953), finishing third in 1953 in its only Final Four berth.\n\nClimbing the Charts: Todd MacCulloch recorded his sixth career 30-point game in the second-round NCAA Tournament game on March 14 with 31 points against Richmond. Only two other players have had as many as six 30-point performances during a Washington career. All-Time Washington 30-Point Game Leaders: 1-Bob Houbregs (1951-53) 13. 2 (tie)-Todd MacCulloch and Steve Hawes (1970-72) 6.\n\nNotable: MacCulloch (18.6), Donald Watts (16.7) and Deon Luton (15.3) account for 64-percent (50.6) of the team's offense (78.8) and are the second-highest scoring trio in Husky history, trailing only the 1972 group of Steve Hawes (21.7), Charles Dudley (16.5) and Louie Nelson (15.1) who averaged 53.3 points . . . Washington's current 78.8-point scoring pace is the school's highest since the 1976 squad averaged 80.2 points per game . . . Deon Luton has accounted for over half of the team's 3-pointers, hitting 74 of Washington's 145 treys.\n\nProvincial Playboy: A native of Winnipeg, Manitoba in Canada, Todd MacCulloch probably never dreamed his travels in the United States would take him to Playboy magazine headquarters in Chicago. He was selected as a 1998 Playboy All-American and joined nine other players and Coach Lute Olson in a photo shoot for the December 1997 issue. The other Playboy All-Americans are: Mike Bibby (Arizona), Zendon Hamilton (St. John's), Drew Hansen (Utah, scholar/athlete), Raef LaFrentz (Kansas), B.J. McKie (South Carolina), Paul Pierce (Kansas), Miles Simon (Arizona), Kenny Thomas (New Mexico) and Robert Traylor (Michigan). \"It's kind of scary. You don't buy that magazine to look at someone like me,\" MacCulloch exclaimed of his apperance in Playboy. Featured on the cover was another Canuck, the 1995 Miss Canada.\n\nBig Mac: Junior 7-foot center Todd MacCulloch was named to the first-team All-Pac-10 squad, ranking sixth among Pac-10 scorers (18.6 ppg) and second in rebounding (9.7 rpg). He currently has 539 points this season and is the 19th player in Washington history to reach the 500-point plateau in a single season. MacCulloch led the nation in field goal shooting last season at 67.6 percent (163-241). He currently ranks first again, shooting 65.3 percent (218-of-334) from the field.\n\nMacCulloch outplayed 7-foot-3 Brad \"Big Continent\" Millard of Saint Mary's in the season opener, amassing 20 points and 14 rebounds to 11 points and six boards for Millard. MacCulloch amassed 31 points and 18 rebounds in an NCAA second-round game against Richmond on March 14. That was MacCulloch's fourth 30-point outing this season, the sixth of his career. He had a career-best 38 points last year at James Madison, the eighth-highest scoring game in Husky history and the most since Chris Welp had 40 against UCLA in 1986.\n\nMacCulloch hit the game-winning layup as time expired at Portland this year (Dec. 3) to cap a 33-point performance. Against Arizona State on Jan. 8, MacCulloch amassed 30 points and a career-high 21 rebounds. He is one of only three players to register two 20-rebound performances during a Washington career. MacCulloch had 31 points and 15 rebounds at Oregon. He has 23career double-doubles with 14 of them coming this season.\n\nMacCulloch was named the Pac-10 Player of the Week on Dec. 1 and Jan. 19. He is the fourth Husky to earn multiple Pac-10 weekly honors. MacCulloch joins Chris Welp as the only Huskies honored twice in the same season by the conference. Welp, who garnered three career Pac-10 weekly awards, won twice in 1986.\n\nDan the Man: Beginning in February, honorable mention All-Pac-10 Freshman point guard Dan Dickau has seen more playing time. He averages over 11 minutes per game during the last 12 outings after playing just 6.9 minutes the first 17 games of the season. Dickau responded to the increased minutes by hitting 13-of-20 shots (65%) from 3-point range over the last 12 games.\n\nDickau tallied 56 of his 105 points during the last 12 games, including 10 at eighth-ranked UCLA and a career-high 12 at No. 4 Arizona. He had 11 points in the Huskies' first meeting with Arizona. All three of Dickau's double-figure scoring games came against top-10 ranked opponents. He hit 4-of-6 shots from 3-point range Feb. 5 at Arizona after entering the game shooting 5-of-12 on treys. He averaged 4.8 points on 48-percent shooting in conference play, improving from 2.2 points on 36-percent shooting in non-conference games. Dickau is an avid fan of former NBA standout \"Pistol\" Pete Maravich. He owns every Maravich basketball card.\n\nHusky Tickets: Good seats are available for all Washington home games on a season and invidual game basis.

Bender, 41, has a six-year record of 72-72 at Washington, including a 20-10 record in 1998 that marked the school's finest winning percentage since 1985. Among the 1998 Husky highlights were their first 20-win season since 1987, their first NCAA berth since 1986 and their first Sweet 16 appearance since 1984.\n\nThe 1997 UW team posted a 17-11 record, capped by the Huskies' second straight National Invitation Tournament appearance.

The UW was 5-22 in 1994 and 10-17 in 1995. His 72 victories rank fourth among all-time Washington coaches. Bender, who began his career with a four-year stint at Illinois State (1990-93), has a 10-year career record of 132-129. His Illinois State squads were 60-57, earning two Missouri Valley Conference championships, one conference tournament title and an NCAA Tournament berth in 1990.\n\nPrior to his inaugural head coaching assignment at ISU, Bender served as an assistant on Mike Krzyzewski's Duke staff from 1983 through 1989. The Blue Devils qualified for the NCAA Tournament in each of Bender's six seasons on the staff, including four trips to the Final Four.
