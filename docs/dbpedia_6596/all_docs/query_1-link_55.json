        "text": "34 years ago today (July 7th 1989), on Ringo Starr's birthday, we began rehearsals at SIR soundstage in Hollywood, CA for the inaugural run of the Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band tour. We did 32 dates in the USA and Canada starting on July 27th after 2+ weeks of rehearsals including a few days of rehearsal in Dallas Texas prior to our first show. The lineup consisted of Ringo, Joe Walsh, Nils Lofgren, Clarence Clemons, Levon Helm, Rick Danko, Dr. John, Billy Preston, and Jim Keltner. Mason Ruffner was our opening act on the tour. This picture was actually taken September 1st of that year at Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View California before our performance there. By that point, we were pretty much a well oiled machine, although on that particular date, Dr John was unable to participate due to health reasons (his Zydeco hat can be seen propped up on a microphone stand in the back row). This photo is of band, management, and crew. Special guests who appeared on the show (depending on which market we were in), included: John Candy (Comedian)... He did a short skit between the show and encore. Chevy Chase (Actor)... He played tambourine and sang vocals on the last song of the show Brad Delp (singer of Boston) Garth Hudson (The Band) Max Weinberg (Bruce Springsteen's drummer) Paul Shaffer (David Letterman's Late Night Band) Bruce Springsteen and Zack Starkey (Ringo's son) There were a few others, but I don't remember after all these years. We started the tour in Dallas TX, and finished up at the Greek Theater in Hollywood, CA on Labor Day Weekend. Here's a \"Where's Waldo\" question. Which one is me?"
