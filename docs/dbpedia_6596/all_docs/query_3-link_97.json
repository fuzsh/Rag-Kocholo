Networks like ESPN and Fox Sports devote time and money to produce high school football broadcasts just as they would for college football games.\n\nWith high school football's profile being raised, so has scouting, and college recruiters now spend as much time breaking down prospects as NFL teams do for college players. But which high schools are \"football factories\" like major college programs such as Alabama, Ohio State and USC? They often get those TV slots since their players will be playing in the NFL in a few years.\n\nThese high schools have produced the most NFL players.\n\n30. DeSoto High School (DeSoto, Texas) — 21 Players (Tie)\n\nThere has been some amazing talent to come out of DeSoto High, and none better than two-time Super Bowl winner, Super Bowl 50 Most Valuable Player and seven-time NFL All-Pro Von Miller.\n\nWhile Miller has been dominant on every level, he never won a state championship. DeSoto got its one and only state title in 2016, when it won the Class 6A Division II state title with a team that included four future NFL players.\n\nNFL Players Who Attended DeSoto\n\nName (Years in NFL)\n\nA.J.

Kiski School (Saltsburg, Pennsylvania) — 21 Players (Tie)\n\nFounded in 1888 just outside of Pittsburgh, The Kiski School is the oldest non-military, all-male boarding school in the country.\n\nAll 210 of their students are required to participate in athletics, though in this day and age, it’s hard to field a competitive football team with that small of a pool of players.\n\nFor that reason, 21 of the 23 Kiski Cougars who made the NFL played before World War II.

Miami Southridge High School (Miami, Florida) — 21 Players (Tie)\n\nLooking at the long list of Miami Southridge players who made it to the NFL, what stands out the most are the great running backs.\n\nThree All-American running backs seem to stand at the head of the pack who also made it to the NFL with Troy Davis (Iowa State), Kevin Smith (Central Florida) and Sedrick Irvin (Michigan State).\n\nNFL Players Who Attended Miami Southridge\n\nDicaprio Bootle (2021-present)\n\nJustin McCray (2017-present)\n\nShawn Davis (2021)\n\nJeremiah McKinnon (2018)\n\nBranden Oliver (2014-17)\n\nKevin Smith (2008-12)\n\nJameel Cook (2001-08)\n\nMark Word (1999-2003)\n\nCourtland Bullard (2002-03)\n\nRobert Bailey (1991-2001)\n\nSedrick Irvin (1999-2000)\n\nSteve Everitt (1993-2000)\n\nLamont Green (1999)\n\nTim Lester (1992-99)\n\nTroy Davis (1997-99)\n\nShevin Smith (1998-99)\n\nSteve Grant (1992-97)\n\nWinston Moss (1987-97)\n\nAlberto White (1994-96)\n\nWillie Peguese (1990-93)\n\nLenny Taylor (1984-87)\n\n27. Waco High (Waco, Texas) — 22 Players (Tie)\n\nLocated between Dallas and Austin, Waco is home to Baylor University, which is just a stone’s throw away from Waco High School. It is the city’s preeminent school for prospective football players as all other high schools in the city have produced just 18 NFL players.\n\nWaco High alums populated the NFL in the pre-merger days, but just four have played since the 2000 season, most notably longtime Chiefs linebacker Derrick Johnson.\n\nWaco High may have the edge in the quantity of NFL players from the city, but it loses the battle in quality as the city’s most famous football player, LaDainian Tomlinson, spurned Waco High for University High.\n\nNFL Players Who Attended Waco\n\nBruce Alford (1946-51)\n\nAndrew Billings (2017-present)\n\nBenny Boynton (1921-24)\n\nCloyce Box (1949-54)\n\nMarv Brown (1957)\n\nKen Casner (1952)\n\nKwame Cavil (2000)\n\nPaul Dickson (1959-71)\n\nLin Elliott (1992-95)\n\nLes Gatewood (1946-47)\n\nAubrey Goodman (1927)\n\nDerrick Johnson (2005-18)\n\nDwight Johnson (2000-02)\n\nLaCurtis Jones (1996)\n\nTex Leyendecker (1933)\n\nClint McClain (1941)\n\nBrian Mitchell (1991-93)\n\nBeasley Reece (1976-84)\n\nJohn Reynolds (1937)\n\nMartin Ruby (1946-50)\n\nGeorge Sauer (1965-70)\n\nCop Weathers (1926)\n\n27. Warren G. Harding (Warren, Ohio) — 22 Players (Tie)\n\nLocated about halfway between Cleveland and Pittsburgh, Harding High has a monopoly on the area since it’s the only high school in the Warren City School District. One-fifth of Harding's NFL players come from the same family as the four Browner brothers (Jim, Joey, Keith, Ross) help boost the ranking of the Harding Raiders.\n\nThe school’s best player is Hall of Fame receiver Paul Warfield while the most notable player from Harding never actually played in the NFL. Former Ohio State star Maurice Clarett was a USA Today High School All-American at Harding before winning a national championship with the Buckeyes.\n\nHe then sued to enter the NFL early and ended up being a third-round draft pick by the Broncos, but was cut in the preseason and never appeared in an NFL game.\n\nNFL Players Who Attended Warren G.

Dillard (Fort Lauderdale, Florida) — 22 Players (Tie)\n\nDillard alum Isaac Bruce was chosen for the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2020. When Bruce retired in 2009, he ranked second all-time in receiving yards, and he also has given back to the school that helped make him an NFL star by serving as both a volunteer and an assistant coach at Dillard.\n\nNFL Players Who Attended Dillard\n\nEarnest Adams (1987)\n\nMatthias Askew (2004-05)\n\nJames Bostic (1998-99)\n\nIsaac Bruce (1994-2009)\n\nLorenzo Davis (1990)\n\nCharles Goodrum (1973-79)\n\nQuinn Gray (2005-08)\n\nPercy Howard (1975)\n\nCalvin Jackson (1994-99)\n\nTron LaFavor (2003)\n\nLeonard Myers (2001-03)\n\nJim Osbourne (1972-84)\n\nFrank Sanders (1995-2003)\n\nJosh Shaw (2002-08)\n\nHerman Smith (1995-96)\n\nPat Sims (2008-17)\n\nBrian Tyms (2012-14)\n\nLorenzo White (1988-95)\n\n24. Compton (Compton, California) — 23 Players (Tie)\n\nCompton High’s most famous alum is someone who is as important as anyone mentioned on this list — even though he never played a snap. Former NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle graduated from Compton High in 1944, long before the city became associated with hip-hop mogul Dr. Dre (who attended Centennial and then Fremont across town).\n\nThe most notable player from Compton High is Marv Fleming, who won five NFL championships (four of which were Super Bowls) while playing for the Green Bay Packers and Miami Dolphins in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe city of Compton had a demographic shift over the last 20 years, and the pipeline to the NFL has all but dried up. Only one player from Compton High has been drafted since 1992: Datone Jones. The Packers selected the defensive end in the first round of the 2013 draft out of UCLA, and he retired in 2018.\n\nNFL Players Who Attended Compton\n\nLeFrancis Arnold (1974)\n\nRod Barksdale (1986-87)\n\nVictor Burnett (1987)\n\nCedrick Brown (1987)\n\nJoe Cain (1989-97)\n\nRobin Cole (1977-88)\n\nAaron Craver (1991-99)\n\nDavid Croudip (1984-88)\n\nMarv Fleming (1963-74)\n\nDanny Greene (1985)\n\nTim Harris (1983)\n\nEric Hurt (1980)\n\nRoy Jefferson (1965-76)\n\nRex Johnston (1960)\n\nDatone Jones (2013-20)\n\nDon Klosterman (1952)\n\nDerrick Martin (1987)\n\nJohn Morton (1953)\n\nMike Richardson (1983-89)\n\nWalter Roberts (1964-70)\n\nBobby Smith (1962-66)\n\nRicky Turner (1988)\n\nBev Wallace (1947-51)\n\n24. Glades Central (Belle Glade, Florida) — 23 Players (Tie)\n\nIn the early 2000s, Glades Central had the honor of having the most active players in the NFL. Now, it will have to settle for 11th place with their four NFL players.\n\nThat number still is equal to the total from some FBS schools, including Syracuse and East Carolina.\n\nGlades Central's best player is former Pro Bowl running back Fred Taylor, but this school specializes in sending wide receivers to the NFL. Santonio Holmes, Jessie Hester, Deonte Thompson, Kelvin Benjamin and Travis Benjamin (no relation) also have gone from Glades to the NFL, and many of them were teammates in high school.\n\nNFL Players Who Attended Glades Central\n\nReidel Anthony (1997-2001)\n\nKelvin Benjamin (2014-18)\n\nTravis Benjamin (2012-21)\n\nRoosevelt Blackmon (1998-99)\n\nJatavis Brown (2016-19)\n\nJohn Ford (1989)\n\nJessie Hester (1985-95)\n\nSantonio Holmes (2006-14)\n\nJames Jackson (2001-05)\n\nWillie Jones (2001-02)\n\nCre'von LeBlanc (2016-20)\n\nJames Lee (2008-11)\n\nRay McDonald (2007-14)\n\nRobert Newkirk (1999-2001)\n\nLouis Oliver (1989-96)\n\nRandy Phillips (2010)\n\nJohnny Rutledge (1999-2003)\n\nJimmy Spencer (1992-2003)\n\nFred Taylor (1998-2010)\n\nSantonio Thomas (2007-08)\n\nDeonte Thompson (2012-18)\n\nClive Walford (2015-19)\n\nRhondy Weston (1989)\n\n24. Jack Yates (Houston, Texas) — 23 Players (Tie)\n\nYates was once one of the biggest high schools in Houston with over 3,600 students in the mid-1980s. The 1985 Yates team won the Texas state title and is considered one of the best high school football teams of all time.\n\nBut now the school has fewer than 1,000 students, and that decrease in enrollment also has impacted the football program. The number of Yates alums to go to the NFL gradually has decreased since the 1990s, and just three have played in the league in the last 20 years.\n\nDexter Manley is the school’s most famous graduate, and his NFL career mirrors that of Yates’ football program. Manley had a great run with the Redskins, won two Super Bowls in the 1980s and is the team’s all-time leader in sacks. But he fizzled out in later years and was banned for life in 1991 after failing his fourth drug test.\n\nNFL Players Who Attended Yates\n\nHarold Bailey (1981-82)\n\nJohnny Bailey (1990-95)\n\nAubrey Beavers (1994-96)\n\nGrady Cavness (1969-70)\n\nAl Dotson (1965-70)\n\nSantana Dotson (1992-2001)\n\nBo Farrington (1960-63)\n\nAlbert Fontenot (1993-2001)\n\nJerrell Franklin (1987)\n\nDoug Greene (1978-80)\n\nPhillip James (1987)\n\nMike Lewis (1971-80)\n\nDexter Manley (1981-91)\n\nRobert Miller (1975-80)\n\nJerald Moore (1996-2000)\n\nElvis Patterson (1984-93)\n\nReggie Phillips (1985-88)\n\nJohn Roper (1989-93)\n\nEric Smith (1987)\n\nQuintin Smith (1990)\n\nDamion Square (2013-21)\n\nSammie Taylor (1965)\n\n19. William Raines (Jacksonville, Florida) — 24 Players (Tie)\n\nJacksonville is the biggest city in the lower 48 and is well represented with 11active NFL players who were born in the city.\n\nThat’s nine more than the number of Raines High graduates who were teammates on the Philadelphia Eagles for nearly a decade. Hall of Fame safety Brian Dawkins and All-Pro cornerback Lito Sheppard patrolled the defensive backfield for the Raines Vikings before doing the same for the Eagles.\n\nAnother Viking-turned-Eagle was 6-foot-8-inch receiver Harold Carmichael who, unsurprisingly, also played basketball at Raines and, surprisingly, played clarinet in the school band.\n\nNFL Players Who Attended Raines\n\nDerrick Alexander (1995-99)\n\nLewis Bennett (1987)\n\nLarry Brown (1978-79)\n\nKen Burrough (1970-81)\n\nHarold Carmichael (1971-84)\n\nThornton Chandler (1986-89)\n\nGreg Coleman (1977-88)\n\nDarrel Crutchfield (2001)\n\nBrian Dawkins (1996-2011)\n\nDerrick Gaffney (1978-87)\n\nJabar Gaffney (2002-12)\n\nRod Gardner (2001-06)\n\nShawn Jefferson (1991-2003)\n\nTerry LeCount (1978-87)\n\nRon Lewis (1990-94)\n\nAnthone Lott (1997)\n\nCalvin Muhammad (1982-87)\n\nLouis Nix (2014-15)\n\nDominique Ross (1995-96)\n\nPatrick Sapp (1996-99)\n\nLito Sheppard (2002-11)\n\nKion Wilson (2010-14)\n\nKevin Youngblood (2006)\n\n19. Junipero Serra (Gardena, California) — 24 Players (Tie)\n\nNot to be confused with the Junipero Serra High School in Northern California that produced Tom Brady, this Junipero Serra High School is in Southern California. It has no Tom Brady, but it has plenty of players at the position that Brady likes throwing to.\n\nAt one point, the school had Robert Woods, Marqise Lee and Paul Richardson all at wideout on the same team. As you would expect, that team dominated its competition to the tune of a 15-0 record and the school’s first football state championship.\n\nNFL Players Who Attended Junipero Serra\n\nBene Benwikere (2014-present)\n\nJoe Cormier (1987)\n\nMatt Dickerson (2018-present)\n\nGeorge Farmer (2016)\n\nDeon Figures (1993-98)\n\nRasheem Green (2018-present)\n\nDaJohn Harris (2012)\n\nAdoree' Jackson (2017-present)\n\nCarl Ihenacho (2012)\n\nDuke Ihenacho (2012-16)\n\nMarqise Lee (2014-17)\n\nKache Palacio (2017)\n\nJemeel Powell (2003)\n\nGene Profit (1986-88)\n\nKris Richard (2002-05)\n\nPaul Richardson (2014-19)\n\nPhil Smith (1983-87)\n\nJashon Sykes (2003-04)\n\nTheophile Viltz (1966)\n\nDavid Williams (1986-87)\n\nOliver Williams (1985-87)\n\nEssop Winston (2021)\n\nRobert Woods (2013-present)\n\n19. Massillon Washington (Massillon, Ohio) — 24 Players (Tie)\n\nYou always have to take high school national championships with a grain of salt since many of them are self-claimed. But it says something that Massillon Washington High School has more \"mythical\" national titles than any other school.\n\nMassillon won nine national championships with all of them coming between 1939 and 1961. Paul Brown won four of those titles as head coach before he went on to found both the Browns and the Bengals in the state of Ohio.\n\nMost of the Massillon players played during the pre-merger era of the NFL with just five alums being drafted in the last 40 years. Pro Bowl linebacker Chris Spielman is the most prominent of that bunch, and Raiders cornerback Gareon Conley is the only active player from Massillon.\n\nNFL Players Who Attended Massillon Washington\n\nAndy Alleman (2008-09)\n\nGerry Allen (1966-69)\n\nCharlie Brown (1966-68)\n\nFred Cardinal (1947)\n\nGareon Conley (2017-19)\n\nShawn Crable (2010)\n\nWill Foster (1973-74)\n\nDennis Franklin (1975-76)\n\nTom Hannon (1977-84)\n\nJim Houston (1960-72)\n\nHorace Gillom (1947-56)\n\nLin Houston (1946-53)\n\nWalt Houston (1955)\n\nTommy James (1947-56)\n\nSteve Luke (1975-80)\n\nThayer Munford (2022-present)\n\nDon Nelson (1926)\n\nDave Reese (1920-23)\n\nBen Roderick (1923-27)\n\nDevin Smith (2015-21)\n\nWillie Spencer (1976-78)\n\nChris Spielman (1988-97)\n\nHarry Stuhldreher (1926)\n\nBob Vogel (1963-72)\n\n19. John Tyler (Tyler, Texas) — 24 Players (Tie)\n\nJohn Tyler High has had at least one player in the NFL every year since Earl Campbell made his debut in 1978. Campbell was nicknamed \"The Tyler Rose,\" and he led his high school to their first state championship in 1973 en route to being named Mr. Football USA.\n\nOutside of Campbell, Tyler’s NFL products lean heavily on the defensive side of the ball, including Super Bowl-winning defensive backs Aaron Ross (New York Giants) and Jeremy Lane (Seattle Seahawks).\n\nThe current NFL players from Tyler High are Tyus Bowser of the Baltimore Ravens, who likely would make anyone’s \"All-Name Team,\" and Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Greg Ward.\n\nNFL Players Who Attended John Tyler\n\nGary Baxter (2001-06)\n\nTyus Bowser (2017-21)\n\nEarl Campbell (1978-85)\n\nChris Carter (1997-2002)\n\nTim Crowder (2007-11)\n\nDon Flynn (1960-61)\n\nKeith Guthrie (1984)\n\nKendall Hunter (2011-15)\n\nBill Johnson (1948-56)\n\nGil Johnson (1949)\n\nGary Jones (1990-96)\n\nJeremy Lane (2012-17)\n\nRonnie Lee (1979-92)\n\nAndrew Melontree (1980)\n\nCharlie Milstead (1960-61)\n\nTony Newsom (1987)\n\nHowie Parker (1948)\n\nTerrence Robinson (2003)\n\nAaron Ross (2007-14)\n\nQuincy Stewart (2001-03)\n\nLarry Strickland (1954-59)\n\nGreg Ward (2019-21)\n\nTeddy Williams (2012-16)\n\nDoug Wyatt (1970-74)\n\n19. Miami Carol City (Miami Gardens, Florida) — 24 Players (Tie)\n\nMiami is known for its huge influence on both sports and music, and Miami Carol City Senior High has produced notable alums in both.\n\nLongtime Redskins receiver Santana Moss played football there, although he was more known for his accomplishments in track and field. Moss won two state titles in the triple jump and another one in the long jump while just being third-team all-state in football.\n\nOn the musical side of the school is Flo Rida, who was a football teammate of Moss in the late 1990s. Additionally, Rick Ross played football at the school and was even good enough to be awarded a scholarship to Albany State.\n\nNFL Players Who Attended Miami Carol City\n\nStedman Bailey (2013-15)\n\nKantroy Barber (1999)\n\nDelvin Brown (2001)\n\nAllen Hurns (2014-19)\n\nRashad Fenton (2019-present)\n\nRicky Jean-Francois (2009-18)\n\nRashad Jeanty (2006-09)\n\nDwayne Joseph (1995)\n\nSantana Moss (2001-14)\n\nGodfrey Myles (1991-96)\n\nFred Nixon (1980-81)\n\nKenny Phillips (2008-15)\n\nWilliam Roberts (1984-97)\n\nRobert Sands (2011-12)\n\nKevin Simons (1989)\n\nKhreem Smith (2006-07)\n\nSimeon Thomas (2019)\n\nDel Speer (1993-94)\n\nJohn Swain (1981-87)\n\nLester Williams (1982-87)\n\nRandy Young (1976)\n\n13. Crenshaw (Los Angeles, California) — 25 Players (Tie)\n\nLos Angeles is the only city with two top 20 schools on this list, and Crenshaw High gives L.A. its first entry. Pro Bowlers Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila and Wendell Tyler are the most famous Crenshaw graduates while the Chiefs’ De’Anthony Thomas tops among active players.\n\nThe school also has produced some pretty good athletes in other sports, including Darryl Strawberry in Major League Baseball and Marques Johnson of the NBA and \"White Men Can’t Jump\" fame.\n\nCrenshaw’s football team has won six state titles, with five of those coming since the 2005 season. Legendary coach Robert Garrett, who started coaching at Crenshaw in 1987, is a big reason why.\n\n\"He’s served the community very well,\" Los Angeles Chargers defensive lineman Brandon Mebane, one of Garrett's former players in the NFL, told the Los Angeles Times. \"He’s helped a lot of kids become great men.\"\n\nNFL Players Who Attended Crenshaw\n\nAlbert Bell (1988)\n\nJerome Boyd (1983)\n\nJames Davis (1982-87)\n\nCharles DeJurnett (1976-86)\n\nGreg Ducre (2014-15)\n\nDuane Galloway (1985-87)\n\nAkbar Gbaja-Biamila (2003-07)\n\nKabeer Gbaja-Biamila (2000-08)\n\nDon Goodman (1987)\n\nDominique Hatfield (2017-18)\n\nDante Hughes (2007-11)\n\nKerry Justin (1978-87)\n\nSid Justin (1979-82)\n\nReggie Lewis (1982-84)\n\nCharles Lockett (1987-88)\n\nJim Looney (1981)\n\nMarcus Martin (2014-20)\n\nBrandon Mebane (2007-19)\n\nBrian Price (2010-12)\n\nHayes Pullard (2015-18)\n\nClint Sampson (1983-86)\n\nDe'Anthony Thomas (2014-19)\n\nWendell Tyler (1977-86)\n\nMichael Williams (1995)\n\nEric Yarber (1986-87)\n\n13. Evanston Township (Evanston, Illinois) — 25 Players (Tie)\n\nWith over 3,300 students, Evanston Township High School is one of the largest high schools in the United States, and it leverages its enrollment. The school currently has over 1,000 students that participate in sports, and just by happenstance, some of those are going to make their way to the NFL, although none recently.\n\nEleven of the school's 24 NFL players joined the league within its first five years of existence in the 1920s, including Hall of Famer Paddy Driscoll. Another noteworthy player is offensive tackle Mike Kenn, who made five Pro Bowls for the Atlanta Falcons in the 1980s and '90s.\n\nThe last NFL player from Evanston Township was Cecil Martin. He played five seasons and retired in 2003, and the school hasn’t had any players drafted in this millennium.\n\nNFL Players Who Attended Evanston Township\n\nAlex Agase (1947-53)\n\nJohn Bosdett (1920)\n\nChuck Carney (1922)\n\nPaddy Driscoll (1920-29)\n\nDick Falcon (1920)\n\nGuil Falcon (1920-25)\n\nHal Faverty (1952)\n\nBob Hoel (1935-38)\n\nRed Jackson (1921)\n\nDamon Jones (1997-2001)\n\nNaquan Jones (2021-present)\n\nYonel Jourdain (1994-95)\n\nMike Kenn (1978-94)\n\nCharlie Knight (1920-21)\n\nRube Marquardt (1921)\n\nCecil Martin (1999-2003)\n\nBill McElwain (1924-26)\n\nEmery Moorehead (1977-88)\n\nSteve Parker (1983-84)\n\nBob Pickens (1967-69)\n\nJim Purnell (1964-72)\n\nJoe Stewart (1978-79)\n\nJim Turner (1923-23)\n\nLaurie Walquist (1922-31)\n\nTrevor Wilmot (1995)\n\n13. South Oak Cliff (Dallas, Texas) — 25 Players (Tie)\n\nAn article about high school football wouldn’t be complete without mentioning Texas and South Oak Cliff (SOC). However, SOC’s placement comes with a bit of a caveat. That’s because 25 percent of its NFL alumni were \"scab players,\" who only participated during the 1987 strike. Those six players combined to play just 20 NFL games and were never heard from again.\n\nApart from those players, the school has a handful of notable names, the best player being former Cowboy Harvey Martin, who won the Super Bowl XII MVP award and was a four-time Pro Bowler.\n\nSouth Oak also produced one Hall of Famer, but it comes in another sport, basketball, as Dennis Rodman wormed his way through school halls.\n\nNFL Players Who Attended South Oak Cliff (Years in League)\n\nLendy Holmes (2009)\n\nLaTarence Dunbar (2003)\n\nJa'Marcus Ingram (2022-present)\n\nRod Jones (1986-96)\n\nJoe King (1991-95)\n\nMichael Downs (1981-89)\n\nIra Albright (1987)\n\nEgypt Allen (1987)\n\nMarvin Ayers (1987)\n\nCornelius Dozier (1987)\n\nJohn Preston (1987)\n\nDurwood Roquemore (1982-87)\n\nGary Spann (1987)\n\nJoe Hayes (1984)\n\nWayne Morris (1976-84)\n\nTim Collier (1976-83)\n\nHarvey Martin (1973-83)\n\nMike Livingston (1968-79)\n\nOscar Roan (1975-78)\n\nRicky Wesson (1977)\n\nDanny Colbert (1974-76)\n\nJackie Allen (1969-72)\n\nKarl Sweetan (1966-70)\n\nMalcolm Walker (1966-70)\n\nGuy Reese (1962-66)\n\n13. Ball (Galveston, Texas) — 25 Players (Tie)\n\nNamed after local businessman George Ball, Ball High has been around since 1884. The famous graduates of Ball come in different sizes and shapes, such as the long and lean Mike Evans and the short and stout Casey Hampton.\n\nEvans is the only Ball graduate to make the NFL over the last dozen years because rising real estate costs in Galveston have forced many families to move out of the area. Since Ball High School is the only public high school in the city, it’s either Ball High or relocate, and many have chosen the latter option.\n\nNFL Players Who Attended Ball\n\nPatrise Alexander (1996-98)\n\nKimble Anders (1991-2000)\n\nCharles Alexander (1979-85)\n\nRodney Artmore (1999)\n\nPatrick Bates (1993-96)\n\nThomas Brown (1980-83)\n\nVince Courville (1987)\n\nTim Denton (1998-2000)\n\nMike Evans (2014-present)\n\nCasey Hampton (2001-12)\n\nEric Hill (1989-99)\n\nCarl Hilton (1986-89)\n\nMike Holmes (1974-76)\n\nTerry Irving (1994-98)\n\nJoe Magliolo (1948)\n\nGeorge McCullough (1997-2001)\n\nHarold Paul (1974)\n\nWhitney Paul (1976-86)\n\nAnthony Phillips (1994-98)\n\nDerrick Pope (2004-07)\n\nKen Pope (1974)\n\nTodd Scott (1991-97)\n\nBilly Stevens (1968-69)\n\nRobert Williams (1987-93)\n\n13. Longview (Longview, Texas) — 25 Players (Tie)\n\nDespite being the 45th biggest city in Texas, Longview pops out future NFL pros like a Pez dispenser.\n\nThe city of Longview has produced 28 NFL players with 23 coming from the school of Longview. At least one of those players has been on a team every year since 1995, and three are currently in the league with linebackers Travin Howard, Pete Robertson and Pro Bowl offensive tackle Trent Williams.\n\nThe school also produced quarterback Jeb Blount, who played in the 1970s and finished his career with no touchdowns and seven interceptions. Surprisingly, that is not the record for most interceptions without a touchdown pass as Jim Musick posted a 0:15 ratio in the 1930s.\n\nNFL Players Who Attended Longview\n\nWillie Andrews (2006-07)\n\nDon Barton (1953)\n\nJeb Blount (1977)\n\nShawn Byrdsong (2002-02)\n\nMike Clark (1963-73)\n\nBobby Collier (1951)\n\nChubby Grigg (1946-52)\n\nJamycal Hasty (2020-present0\n\nRobert Henson (2009)\n\nTravin Howard (2019-21)\n\nEarnest Hunter (1995-96)\n\nGaylon Hyder (1999-2000)\n\nChris Ivory (2010-18)\n\nMalcolm Kelly (2008-09)\n\nDon Menasco (1952-54)\n\nMike Mock (1978)\n\nLoyd Phillips (1967-69)\n\nPete Robertson (2017-19)\n\nJosh Scobee (2004-15)\n\nBobby Taylor (1995-2004)\n\nHosea Taylor (1981-83)\n\nBroderick Washington Jr. (2020-present)\n\nRickey Watts (1979-83)\n\nEugene Williams (1982-83)\n\nTrent Williams (2010-present)\n\n13. Abraham Lincoln (San Diego, California) — 25 Players (Tie)\n\nLincoln High has not had an active NFL player since 2007, but the star power of their alumni may be unmatched. They’ve had not one, but two Hall of Fame running backs: Marcus Allen and Terrell Davis.\n\nAdditionally, Marcus’ brother Damon became a Canadian Football Hall of Famer due to his exploits in the CFL. Six-time Pro Bowl defensive back Dave Grayson also came from Lincoln as did notorious bust Akili Smith.\n\nWhy hasn't the school had any NFL players in over a decade? You can likely point to stricter academic requirements that went into place in the 2007-08 school year.\n\nNFL Players Who Attended Abraham Lincoln\n\nMarcus Allen (1982-97)\n\nLew Barnes (1986-89)\n\nLen Burnett (1961)\n\nScott Byers (1984)\n\nKern Carson (1965)\n\nTerrell Davis (1995-2001)\n\nWillie Franklin (1972)\n\nDave Grayson (1961-70)\n\nDavid Grayson (1987-91)\n\nJimmy Gunn (1970-76)\n\nLuther Hayes (1961)\n\nWally Henry (1977-82)\n\nDoug Jones (1973-79)\n\nMike Lee (1974)\n\nDave Lewis (1977-83)\n\nSaladin Martin (1980-81)\n\nMartin Moss (1982-85)\n\nPat Newman (1991-94)\n\nSteve Pierce (1987)\n\nDoug Reed (1984-90)\n\nPatrick Rowe (1993)\n\nNate Shaw (1969-70)\n\nAkili Smith (1999-2002)\n\nRobert West (1972-74)\n\nDwayne Wright (2007)\n\n11. Miami Central (Miami, Florida) — 27 Players (Tie)\n\nMany different colleges have the rightful claim to \"Running Back U,\" but the moniker of \"Running Back High\" resides with the Miami Central Rockets. Willis McGahee, Devonta Freeman, Dalvin Cook, Najeh Davenport and Travaris Cadet are some of the backs who’ve made their way from Central to the NFL.\n\nHowever, it seems as though Miami Central put all its eggs into the running back basket as the school hasn’t produced many quality players at any other position.\n\nThe one exception is former lineman Bruce Armstrong, who made six Pro Bowls for the New England Patriots in the 1990s.\n\nNFL Players Who Attended Miami Central\n\nBruce Armstrong (1987-2000)\n\nAntonio Brown (2003-05)\n\nReggie Brown (1993-94)\n\nTravaris Cadet (2012-present)\n\nDalvin Cook (2017-present)\n\nJames Cook (2022-present)\n\nIvory Curry (1987)\n\nNajeh Davenport(2002-08)\n\nDwight Drane (1986-91)\n\nDevonta Freeman (2014-21)\n\nCharles Gaines (2015)\n\nAli Highsmith (2008-09)\n\nRod Issac (2011)\n\nStanley Jean-Baptiste (2014-17)\n\nDarnell Jenkins (2008)\n\nCedric Killings (2000-07)\n\nEmanuel Martin (1993-99)\n\nWillis McGahee (2004-13)\n\nJohn Miller (2015-21)\n\nDeatrick Nichols (2018)\n\nKevin Pamphile (2014-18)\n\nElvis Peacock (1979-81)\n\nCarroll Phillips (2017-19)\n\nAl Richardson (1980-85)\n\nAhmad Thomas (2018-19)\n\nKeir Thomas (2022-present)\n\nAnthony Toribio(2009-13)\n\n11. Glenville (Cleveland, Ohio) — 27 Players (Tie)\n\nThis list of alums from Glenville High School reads just like the list of alums from Ohio State University. Heisman winner Troy Smith, Cardale Jones, Marshon Lattimore and Ted Ginn Jr. all took the path from Glenville to Columbus to the NFL.\n\nGinn’s father, Ted Sr., is the longtime football and track coach at Glenville, and because of his success, Cleveland has named a local street after him. Ted Ginn Sr. Avenue is just a short distance from Steve Harvey Way, which is named after the actor and TV host who attended Glenville at the same time that Ginn Sr. did.\n\nNFL Players Who Attended Glenville\n\nRichard Bishop (1976-83)\n\nBryant Browning (2011-12)\n\nC.B.

Male (Louisville, Kentucky) — 29 Players\n\nFounded in 1856, Male Traditional High School is the oldest school on this list and the first high school established west of the Allegheny Mountains. Thus, there is a lot of history with this school, and 15 of its 28 alumni played during the first four years of the NFL’s existence (1920-23).\n\nThe school produced only a handful of players over the rest of the century before experiencing a renaissance in the 2000s, with players such as Chris Redman and Michael Bush making it to the NFL.\n\nEntering the 2018 season, Male had the third-winningest high school football program in the nation, trailing only Valdosta (Georgia) and Highlands (Kentucky).\n\nNFL Players Who Attended Male\n\nAbe Addams (1949)\n\nChris Barclay (2007)\n\nChase Boldt (1921-23)\n\nMichael Bush (2008-14)\n\nHarper Card (1921-22)\n\nChris Demaree (2002)\n\nTony Driver (2001-02)\n\nJoe Engelhard (1921-22)\n\nAl Espie (1923)\n\nSalem Ford (1922-23)\n\nDick Gibson (1922-23)\n\nPatsy Giugliano (1923)\n\nJustin Green (2013-14)\n\nMarcus Green (2006)\n\nHerb Gruber (1921-23)\n\nNate Hobbs (2021-present)\n\nRashad Holman (2001-03)\n\nD.J.

Hargrave Military Academy (Chatham, Virginia) — 32 Players (Tie)\n\nOne of two military academies on this list, Hargrave started a post-graduate football program in the 1990s, but shut it down in 2013, and now only has a varsity team.\n\nSeven-time Pro Bowler Torry Holt was this school’s most famous NFL alum, but defense has been the calling card at Hargrave as 24 of its 32 NFL players have come from that side of the ball.\n\nThe last 15 players from Hargrave are defenders, including current linebackers Leonard Floyd and Zach Brown.\n\nNFL Players Who Attended Hargrave Military Academy\n\nBrandon Anderson (2009)\n\nJohn Atkins (2018-19)\n\nZach Brown (2012-19)\n\nQuinton Coples (2012-15)\n\nAnthony Davis (2004-08)\n\nKevin Dodd (2016-17)\n\nRas-I Dowling (2011-14)\n\nEgo Ferguson (2014-15)\n\nLeonard Floyd (2016-present)\n\nClifton Geathers (2010-14)\n\nCharles Grant (2002-09)\n\nJermaine Hardy (2005)\n\nMarcus Harrison (2008-10)\n\nMario Harvey (2012-14)\n\nAnthony Hill (2009-11)\n\nTorry Holt (1999-2009)\n\nPeria Jerry (2009-13)\n\nCarlos King (1998)\n\nShaq Lawson (2016-present)\n\nBobby Massie (2012-21)\n\nOnterio McCalebb (2014)\n\nJonathan Meeks (2013-16)\n\nSolomon Page (1999-2003)\n\nLeonard Pope (2006-12)\n\nJerrell Powe (2011-14)\n\nKevin Reddick (2013-15)\n\nJarran Reed (2016-present)\n\nCarlos Rogers (2005-14)\n\nTony Scott (2000-01)\n\nJohnathan Sullivan (2003-05)\n\nCordrea Tankersley (2017-20)\n\nDanny Ware (2007-12)\n\nKeiland Williams (2010-12)\n\n7. DeMatha Catholic (Hyattsville, Maryland) — 32 Players (Tie)\n\nDeMatha is one of those rare schools that would place in the top 10 for most players in the NFL and the NBA. In addition to NFL players like Brian Westbrook and Cameron Wake coming from DeMatha, NBA stars such as Victor Oladipo, Markelle Fultz and Adrian Dantley also have walked the halls.\n\nThe first former DeMatha students to make it to the NFL were Garrett Ford and Brendan McCarthy in 1968, so much of the school's success is rather recent. Student-athletes in Prince George’s County, Maryland, know that DeMatha is the best path to the NFL since it has produced twice as many NFL players as any other Maryland high school.\n\nNFL Players Who Attended DeMatha\n\nRogers Alexander (1986-87)\n\nJacob Bender (2007)\n\nJa'Whaun Bentley (2018-present)\n\nJ.B.

McKinley (Canton, Ohio) — 32 Players (Tie)\n\nOhio is the home of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and the Buckeye State has a long tradition of high school football excellence. Canton McKinley High School plays its home games at the stadium that hosts the NFL's Hall of Fame game, so these students get to pass by the Hall every time they take the seven-minute bus ride from their school to the stadium.\n\nNo active NFL players from McKinley High are in the NFL. The last played in 2015. But the school has produced Hall of Fame running back Marion Motley, current Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, and entering play in 2018, McKinley ranked 10th in the nation in all-time football wins.\n\nNFL Players Who Attended McKinley\n\nHal Broda (1927)\n\nReggie Corner (2008-11)\n\nJamal Davis (2019)\n\nMike Doss (2003-08)\n\nJack Dugger (1946-49)\n\nTyler Everett (2006)\n\nRay Ellis (1981-87)\n\nRalph Fife (1942-46)\n\nWayne Fontes (1962)\n\nButch Gibson (1930-34)\n\nWayne Gift (1937)\n\nEd Grimsley (1987)\n\nJohn Grimsley (1984-93)\n\nTed Hopkins (1921-22)\n\nJohn Kompara (1960)\n\nSid Lewis (1987)\n\nJamar Martin (2003-06)\n\nJoe Morgan (2012-15)\n\nMarion Motley (1946-55)\n\nMike Obrovac (1981-83)\n\nKenny Peterson (2003-09)\n\nEli Popa (1952)\n\nEd Rate (1923)\n\nGarland Rivers (1987)\n\nDominique Robinson (2022-present)\n\nNick Roman (1970-74)\n\nRobert Sedlock (1960)\n\nMarv Smith (1921)\n\nPercy Snow (1990-93)\n\nDutch Speck (1920-26)\n\nDutch Strassner (1925)\n\nHarold Zerbe (1926)\n\n6. St. Augustine (New Orleans, Louisiana) — 34 Players\n\nLouisiana makes its second appearance on this list with the all-boys private high school known as St. Aug. The school starts at eighth grade to give students an extra year of high school life, and with its close proximity to LSU, many St. Augustine football players matriculate to Tiger Stadium.\n\nPlayers such as Leonard Fournette and Tyrann Matheiu have worn the purple and gold of both St. Aug and LSU, while alums such as BenJarvus Green-Ellis headed off to other colleges.\n\nSt. Aug was one of many New Orleans high schools that temporarily shut down after Hurricane Katrina, but it reopened and has reclaimed its status as a football powerhouse.\n\nNFL Players Who Attended St. Augustine\n\nLouis Age (1992)\n\nGlenn Alexander (1970)\n\nSidney Brown (1978)\n\nSelvish Capers (2012)\n\nOliver Celestin (2004-08)\n\nNat Dorsey (2004-07)\n\nLorenzo Doss (2015-18)\n\nLeonard Fournette (2017-present)\n\nBenJarvus Green-Ellis (2008-13)\n\nJames Hall (2000-11)\n\nCortez Hankton (2003-06)\n\nLeroy Hoard (1990-99)\n\nSam Holden (1971)\n\nTyrone Hughes (1993-98)\n\nPaul Irons (2005)\n\nAl Jenkins (1969-73)\n\nRishaw Johnson (2012-14)\n\nCharles Jones (2019)\n\nLonnie Marts (1991-2000)\n\nTyrann Mathieu (2013-present)\n\nStanley Morgan Jr. (2019-present)\n\nLouis Oubre (1982-87)\n\nMarcus Quinn (1987)\n\nJerry Reese (1979-80)\n\nDerrick Rodgers (1997-2004)\n\nMalcolm Scott (1983-87)\n\nTreg Songy (1987)\n\nBrian Taylor (1989-91)\n\nRaynoch Thompson (2000-04)\n\nPatrick Trahan (2011-12)\n\nTrai Turner (2014-present)\n\nJackie Wallace (1974-79)\n\nDavid White (1993-96)\n\nJason Wiltz (1999-2000)\n\nNFL Players Who Attended Dorsey\n\nKarim Abdul-Jabbar (1996-2000)\n\nBilly Anderson (1953-54)\n\nJerome Boyd (2009-11)\n\nKeith Browner (2012-14)\n\nBeno Bryant (1994)\n\nFrank Buncom (1962-68)\n\nAntonio Chatman (2003-08)\n\nAaron Cox (1988-93)\n\nRon Copeland (1969)\n\nNa'il Diggs (2000-11)\n\nJohnathan Franklin (2013)\n\nDavid Gettis (2010-12)\n\nMarvin Hall (2017-21)\n\nJeremy Harris (2014-15)\n\nRobert Herron (2014)\n\nBernard Jackson (1972-80)\n\nButch Johnson (1976-85)\n\nHolbert Johnson (1987)\n\nJeremiah Johnson (2011-12)\n\nJerome Johnson (2010)\n\nKeyshawn Johnson (1996-2006)\n\nJack Kirby (1949)\n\nDaryl Knox (1987)\n\nRon Lewis (1995)\n\nChris Matthews (2014-17)\n\nJaydon Mickens (2017-21)\n\nChris Mims (1992-99)\n\nCharles Mincy (1991-99)\n\nRahim Moore (2011-15)\n\nReynaud Moore (1971)\n\nJack Nix (1950)\n\nDennis Northcutt (2000-09)\n\nChris Owens (2009-15)\n\nEdell Shepherd (2003-06)\n\nKayvon Thibodeaux (2022-present)\n\nLamont Warren (1994-2002)\n\n4. Miami Northwestern (Miami, Florida) — 37 Players\n\nAnyone who follows the NFL knows that Miami is a hotbed for players. Miami Northwestern Senior High School has produced not just NFL players, but Pro Bowl players such as Amari Cooper and Lavonte David.\n\nThrow in recent first-round picks Teddy Bridgewater and Artie Burns, and you can see why Miami Northwestern is one of three South Florida high schools to be named national champion over the last decade.\n\nBut Miami Northwestern is not without controversy. In 2006, the school's football head coach and his entire staff were among those fired for covering up a sex scandal involving their star running back. Even though 98 percent of the players had nothing to do with it, the entire team was placed on probation for one year as a result of the cover-up.\n\nNFL Players Who Attended Miami Northwestern (Years in League)\n\nTutu Atwell (2021-present)\n\nDeandre Baker (2019-21)\n\nMel Bratton (1989-90)\n\nTeddy Bridgewater (2014-present)\n\nLarry Brinson (1977-80)\n\nArtie Burns (2016-present)\n\nAntonio Bryant (2002-09)\n\nVernon Carey (2004-11)\n\nAmari Cooper (2015-present)\n\nTorrie Cox (2004-09)\n\nLavonte David (2012-present)\n\nOnzy Elam (1987-89)\n\nBobby Felts (1965-67)\n\nTrevor Ford (2009)\n\nMarcus Forston (2012-13)\n\nAnthony Gaitor (2011-14)\n\nLonnie Hepburn (1971-74)\n\nDon Holmes (1986-90)\n\nMark Irvin (1987)\n\nMarvin Jones (1993-2003)\n\nDonnell Johnson (1993)\n\nOlrick Johnson (1999-2000)\n\nDave McDaniels (1968)\n\nSnoop Minnis (2001-02)\n\nDerrell Mitchell (1994)\n\nVernand Morency (2005-07)\n\nBrett Perriman (1988-97)\n\nEli Rogers (2016-present)\n\nBuster Rhymes (1985-86)\n\nSean Spence (2012-17)\n\nTommy Streeter (2012-14)\n\nKenbrell Thompkins (2013-15)\n\nTray Walker (2015)\n\nBrandon Washington (2012-14)\n\nDick Washington (1968)\n\nNate Webster (2000-08)\n\nRachad Wildgoose (2021-present)\n\n3.

It is the largest Catholic high school in the country by enrollment, and a who’s who of South Florida residents have made it from this school to the NFL.\n\nMichael Irvin, Geno Atkins, Joey Bosa and Nick Bosa have played at Thomas Aquinas, which has won 11 state titles and three high school national championships.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas has had an exceptional run of producing NFL players lately, with 15 players currently in the NFL, the most of any high school in the United States.\n\nIn fact, Thomas Aquinas has more current NFL players than many colleges in Power 5 conferences such as Washington State (14), Kansas State (12), Kentucky (12) and Purdue (11).\n\nNFL Players Who Attended St. Thomas Aquinas\n\nDamon Arnette (2020-21)\n\nGeno Atkins (2010-20)\n\nGiovani Bernard (2013-present)\n\nJoey Bosa (2016-present)\n\nNick Bosa (2019-present)\n\nKen Bowen (1987)\n\nBobby Brown (2000)\n\nJeremy Cain (2004-14)\n\nBarry Cantrell (2000)\n\nBryan Cox Jr. (2017-20)\n\nJames Crawford (2018-19)\n\nPhillip Dorsett (2015-present)\n\nMarcus Gilbert (2011-18)\n\nTavares Gooden (2008-13)\n\nRichard Goodman (2010-12)\n\nRashad Greene (2015-18)\n\nLeonard Hankerson (2011-15)\n\nBobby Hart (2015-present)\n\nGabe Holmes (2017-18)\n\nStefan Humphries (1984-88)\n\nMichael Irvin (1988-99)\n\nLamarcus Joyner (2014-present)\n\nBrandon Linder (2014-21)\n\nElijah Moore (2021-present)\n\nMichael Palardy (2014-21)\n\nSterling Palmer (1993-96)\n\nJosh Palmer (2021-present)\n\nBrian Piccolo (1966-69)\n\nDaryl Porter (1997-2001)\n\nWyatt Ray (2020-present)\n\nCody Riggs (2015-16)\n\nMarcus Roberson (2014-16)\n\nJake Rudock (2017)\n\nTwan Russell (1997-2003)\n\nNate Salley (2006-08)\n\nAsante Samuel Jr. (2021-present)\n\nJordan Scarlett (2019-21)\n\nDezmen Southward (2014-17)\n\nChristian Thompson (2012)\n\nJamaal Westerman (2009-13)\n\nJames White (2014-21)\n\nMajor Wright (2010-16)\n\nSam Young (2010-20)\n\n2. Long Beach Poly (Long Beach, California) — 59 Players\n\nSports Illustrated labeled Long Beach Poly \"Sports School of the Century\" — and for good reason. It’s one thing to have run-of-the-mill players come from your school, but it’s another to have star NFL players come from your school.\n\nDeSean Jackson, JuJu Smith-Schuster and Willie McGinest are just some of the NFL players who have contributed to the 19 CIF-Southern Section championships for the Jackrabbits. The school even has surpassed numerous FBS programs in terms of NFL players produced, including South Florida (56) and Central Michigan (49).\n\nEqually as impressive as the NFL players Long Beach Poly has produced are the non-football players who have come from the school. Hall of Famers Tony Gwynn and Billie Jean King came from Long Beach Poly as did actress Cameron Diaz and rapper Snoop Dogg.\n\nNFL Players Who Attended Long Beach Poly (Years in League)\n\nMarques Anderson (2002-05)\n\nCorrie Artman (1931-33)\n\nTerrence Austin (2010-11)\n\nBullet Baker (1927-31)\n\nDarnell Bing (2008-09)\n\nJayon Brown (2017-present)\n\nWillie Brown (1964-66)\n\nJames Burton (1994-97)\n\nMark Carrier (1990-2000)\n\nJurrell Casey (2011-20)\n\nRoyal Cathcart (1950)\n\nSam Cathcart (1949-52)\n\nKaelin Clay (2015-18)\n\nCharles Clinton (1987)\n\nLarry Croom (2004)\n\nJack Evans (1929)\n\nRed Franklin (1935-37)\n\nIsaiah Green (2012-13)\n\nDon Hill (1929)\n\nTony Hill (1977-86)\n\nDavid Howard (1985-92)\n\nDeSean Jackson (2008-21)\n\nBill Jessup (1951-60)\n\nKirk Jones (1987)\n\nJack Jones (2022-present)\n\nWinston Justice (2007-13)\n\nMike Kellogg (1966-67)\n\nQuentin Klenk (1946)\n\nJim Lawson (1927)\n\nMarcedes Lewis (2006-present)\n\nEarl McCullouch (1968-74)\n\nJames McDonald (1983-87)\n\nGerry McDougall (1962-64)\n\nWillie McGinest (1994-2008)\n\nChuckie Miller (1988-88)\n\nKelly Moan (1939)\n\nJohnny Morris (1958-67)\n\nRandall Morris (1984-88)\n\nJamize Olawale (2012-19)\n\nStephone Paige (1983-91)\n\nSamie Parker (2004-07)\n\nMarquez Pope (1992-2001)\n\nDennis Price (1988-92)\n\nKen-Yon Rambo (2001-02)\n\nLeonard Russell (1991-96)\n\nDon Sasa (1995-98)\n\nJeff Smith (1966)\n\nJuJu Smith-Schuster (2017-present)\n\nOmar Stoutmire (1997-2007)\n\nPago Togafau (2007-09)\n\nAndre Tyler (1983)\n\nHenry Wallace (1960)\n\nGene Washington (1969-79)\n\nMark Washington (2007)\n\nCarl Weathers (1970-71)\n\nBrandon Whiting (1998-2004)\n\nAl Williams (1987)\n\nKendall Williams (1983)\n\nManuel Wright (2005-07)\n\n1. Fork Union Military Academy (Fork Union, Virginia) — 67 Players\n\nFork Union deserves somewhat of an asterisk. Not only is it a high school, but it is also a post-graduate school that many kids go to before heading off to college.\n\nHeisman winners like Vinny Testaverde and Eddie George went this route and spent, in essence, five years in high school before heading to their respective colleges.\n\nPro Bowl receivers Plaxico Burress and Michael Thomas called FUMA home, and the discipline that a military academy installs in students carries over from the classroom to the football field.\n\nFork Union is first on this list, and their 13 active players are second for the most active players in the NFL."
