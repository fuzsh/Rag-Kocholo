        "text": "Bob Uecker was an average baseball player who became famous for his work as a broadcaster actor and television and radio personality.\n\nAccording to his Sabr bio, his career stat line was a .200 batting average in 297 games (217 starts) to go with 146 hits, 14 home runs, and 74 runs scored.\n\nUecker’s best-known role was his portrayal of Harry Doyle in the Major League series about the hapless turned successful Cleveland Indians baseball team.\n\nThe always colorful Doyle had the famous “Juusssst a bit outside” quote about the erratic Ricky Vaughn (played by Charlie Sheen) who couldn’t throw a strike over the plate.\n\nThe first Major League came out in 1989 and by that time Bob Uecker had a well-established career. He also acted in television and radio ads and was part of the sitcom Mr. Belvedere as the goofy sportswriting dad, George Owens.\n\nHe worked as a broadcaster for the Milwaukee Brewers since 1971 and made numerous appearances in the WWE and on the Johnny Carson show, with the Tonight Show host declaring him “Mr. Baseball”.\n\nHere are the best Bob Uecker quotes – sourced from his on-air broadcasts, film appearances, interviews, and more.\n\nThe Best Quotes From Bob Uecker\n\n1.) “When I asked MLB writers why they haven’t selected me for the Hall of Fame, they said they thought I was still playing.” – Bob Uecker\n\n2.) “In 1962 I was named Minor League Player of the Year. It was my second season in the bigs.” – Bob Uecker\n\n3.) “My rookie year, they told me, ‘In the big leagues, most of us wear our jockstrap on the inside of the uniform.’” – Bob Uecker\n\n4.) “Anybody with ability can play in the big leagues…But to be able to trick people year in and year out the way I did, I think that was a much greater feat.” – Bob Uecker\n\n5.) “I remember one time I’m batting against the Dodgers in Milwaukee. They lead, 2 – 1, it’s the bottom of the ninth, bases loaded, two out, and the pitcher has a full count on me. I look over to the Dodger dugout and they’re all in street clothes.” – Bob Uecker\n\n6.) “They said I was such a great prospect that they were sending me to a winter league to sharpen up. When I stepped off the plane, I was in Greenland.” – Bob Uecker\n\n7.) “After my interview with Johnny Carson ended, I heard him ask Ed McMahon, ‘Did that guy really play baseball?’” – Bob Uecker\n\n8.) “I knew when my career was over. In 1965 my baseball card came out with no picture.” – Bob Uecker\n\n9.) “I hit a homer off Gaylord Perry, and he said it was the worst day of his life. Not his baseball life, but his whole life.” – Bob Uecker\n\n10.) “Coach told me to use a lighter bat. Not to get around on fastballs, but so it wouldn’t be as heavy when I carried it back to the dugout.” – Bob Uecker\n\n11.) “When I played, they didn’t use fancy words like “emotionally distressed.” They just said I couldn’t hit.” – Bob Uecker\n\n12.) “The way to catch a knuckleball is to wait until it stops rolling and then pick it up.” – Bob Uecker\n\n13.) “People don’t know this, but I helped the Cardinals win the pennant. I came down with hepatitis. The trainer injected me with it!” – Bob Uecker\n\n14.) “Curveball ..or a bender. I don’t know much about curveballs, but I’ve sure had experience with benders.” – Bob Uecker\n\n15.) “I’d take the kids to my game. Then after, they’d want to ride home with a different player.” – Bob Uecker\n\n16.) “My managers didn’t want me in the game. Heck, they didn’t want me on the bench. Kids ask which club I played for. Nobody, but I sat for a lot.” – Bob Uecker\n\n17.) “I had everything to learn and I spent ten years learning it…I didn’t try to wisecrack my way through it.” – Bob Uecker on becoming a play-by-play announcer\n\n18.) “You paint a picture in the mind. It’s a kick to make baseball come alive to a guy hundreds of miles away who’s never seen your home park.” – Bob Uecker on preferring radio over television\n\n19.) “Wherever I am, dig me up. Bring me back here. A couple times around the warning track and take me back to the hole where you picked me up.” – Bob Uecker on wanting to announce Brewers games forever\n\n20.) “With Philadelphia, I’d be sitting on the bench and (manager) Gene Mauch would holler down ‘grab a bat, Bob, and stop this rally.'” – Bob Uecker\n\n21.) “Get up! Get up! Get outta here! Gone!” – Bob Uecker\n\nIs there a Bob Uecker quote that we missed?
