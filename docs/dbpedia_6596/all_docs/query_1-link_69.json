        "text": "It is with great sadness that we mark the passing of Professor John W. “Jack” Bender. Born on October 22, 1951, in Pittsburgh, PA, Jack died on September 14, 2019.\n\n…\n\nIn epistemology, Jack’s work focused on defending foundationalism and critically engaging the influential coherence theories advanced in the 1980s. Some of this work grew out of an NEH summer seminar directed by Keith Lehrer and Alvin Goldman. Keith Lehrer recalled:\n\nHis participation was invaluable and led to his editing a book, The Current State of the Coherence Theory: Critical Essays on the Epistemic Theories of Keith Lehrer and Laurence Bonjour, with Replies in 1989, which was a critical study with essays by multiple authors. It was a volume that involved us in collaboration. I recall the episode with pleasure and as the beginning of a valuable ongoing philosophical relationship with Jack. As I was replying to my critics, Jack reminded me to express my gratitude to the authors engaging critically with my work.\n\nAmong Jack’s contributions to this debate were the following articles he co-authored with Wayne Davis: “Coherence Is Insufficient for Epistemic Justification” (Proceedings of the Ohio Philosophical Association, 1988, 1–12); “Fundamental Troubles with Coherence” (in The Current State of the Coherence Theory, Philosophical Studies Series 1989, 52–68), and “Technical Flaws in the Coherence Theory” (Synthese, 79, 1989, 257–78).\n\nJack’s research also included significant contributions in aesthetics.
