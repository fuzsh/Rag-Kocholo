        "text": "John E. List, who escaped his drab existence as a failed New Jersey accountant by killing his family in 1971, disappearing and building a new life far away until a true-crime show on television led to his capture almost 18 years later, died on Friday. He was 82.\n\nMr. List died at St. Francis Medical Center in Trenton four days after being taken there from the New Jersey State Prison, officials told The Associated Press. The cause was complications of pneumonia.\n\nThe larger world had never heard of John Emil List until his neighbors began to wonder why the lights in his family’s house in Westfield, N.J., were going out one by one in the fall of 1971, weeks after anyone had been seen entering or leaving. And the high school drama coach of Mr. List’s daughter had begun to worry about her absence.\n\nWhen police officers entered the home on Dec. 7, 1971, they heard organ music on an intercom system and found the bodies of Mr. List’s wife, Helen, 46; his daughter, Patricia, 16; his sons John, 15, and Frederick, 13, and his mother, Alma, 85. All had been shot to death.\n\nThe police also found a note from Mr. List to his pastor at a Lutheran church where Mr. List sometimes taught Sunday school. Over five pages, Mr. List wrote that he saw too much evil in the world and that he had ended the lives of his wife, mother and children to save their souls.\n\nMr. List, at 46, had trouble holding a job, was strapped by a mortgage and was apparently taking money from his mother’s account, investigators found.\n\nHis car was discovered in a parking lot at Kennedy International Airport not long after the corpses were found, but dozens of F.B.I. agents and investigators from Union County, N.J., found no trace of Mr. List in the United States or overseas.\n\nIn 1989, Union County prosecutors asked the producers of the Fox program “America’s Most Wanted” to look at the case. To help, the producers brought in Frank Bender, a forensic sculptor, and Richard Walter, a criminal psychologist.\n\nStudying photographs of Mr. List when he was in his mid-40s, Mr. Bender imagined how he might look in 1989, his face sagging with time. Mr. Walter theorized that Mr. List would still be wearing horn-rimmed glasses, to make him appear successful.\n\nOn May 21, 1989, Fox televised the segment and displayed a bust of an older John List. The network estimated that 22 million people saw it. One was a woman in a suburb of Richmond, Va., who thought the bust looked like a neighbor, Robert Clark, a churchgoing accountant who wore horn-rimmed glasses.\n\nAgents went to the home of “Robert Clark,” confronted his stunned wife, whom he had met at a church social, then obtained her help in filling in blanks from the past. They arrested him at his office on June 1. Fingerprints confirmed that he was John List, although he had denied it. As a fugitive, he had lived quietly in Virginia and in the Denver area.\n\nAt Mr. List’s trial in 1990, a psychiatrist for the prosecution testified that Mr. List had been suffering only from a “midlife crisis” when he slaughtered his family and that he had enjoyed life in the years afterward.\n\nMr. List was convicted of murder and sentenced to five life terms in prison. He appealed, unsuccessfully, on grounds that his judgment had been impaired by post-traumatic stress disorder from military service in World War II and Korea and that his letter to the pastor should have been kept confidential.\n\nIn a 2002 television interview on ABC with Connie Chung, Mr. List was asked why he did not take his own life if he felt so overwhelmed. Mr. List said that he thought suicide would have barred him from heaven and that he had hoped to be reunited there with his family."
