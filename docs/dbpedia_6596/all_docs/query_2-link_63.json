We went 10-0 to start the season,” recalls Chibbs, now the head coach at Fisk University. “Then we had a little dip. Dennis Scott was a junior, thinking about turning pro. Brian Oliver was a senior who had to turn pro. Coach [Bobby] Cremins called me in the office and spoke to me about how to handle the different personalities, and we got it together. Got on a roll for the tournament, and that’s when ‘Lethal Weapon 3’ really took over…Unfortunately, we ran into UNLV in the Final Four, and they were just awesome.

The year 1985 though? That was Big Apple Dreams. Chris Mullin, Brooklyn native and soon-to-be-No. 7 Draft pick, was the leading scorer. Walter “The Truth” Berry, Manhattan native and future 14th pick in the draft, was No. 2. Mike Moses, from the Bronx, was the starting PG. The 6th man on this 31-4 powerhouse? Brooklyn’s own Mark Jackson, who would only go on to win NBA ROY and finish his career second all-time in assists. The misfortune of running into an equally elite Georgetown team in the Final Four may have kept this squad from true immortality, but it will always live on in the hearts of college hoopheads.\n\nRoster · Bob Antonelli · Walter Berry · Terry Bross · Rob Cornegy · Willie Glass · John Hempel · Mark Jackson · Shelton Jones · Mike Moses · Chris Mullin · Ron Rowan · Steve Shurina · Ron Stewart · Bill Wennington ·\n\nVersatility Index: 85\n\n↪ Back\n\n28\n\n28 Houston1968\n\nRecord 31-2 Coach Guy Lewis\n\nIt was known as “The Game of the Century,” and for college basketball fans, it was definitely that. For the Houston Cougars, it was even more important. UH’s 71-69 victory over defending national champion UCLA not only snapped the Bruins’ 47-game winning streak; it also avenged the Cougars’ 15-point loss to John Wooden’s eventual national champions in the 1967 national semifinal. The Guy Lewis-coached Cougars were led by All-America center Elvin Hayes, who averaged 36.8 ppg and 18.9 rpg. Houston finished the regular season 28-0 and was ranked first in the polls. Hayes had plenty of help, including Ken Spain (14.2 ppg, 12.8 rpg), Theodis Lee (13.9, 7.9) and Don Chaney (13.0, 5.8). The Cougars thrashed Loyola-Chicago, Louisville and TCU in their first three tourney games to reach their rematch with the Bruins in the L.A. Sports Arena. Houston limited Lou Alcindor to 19 points, but Mike Lynn and Lucius Allen also had 19 in a 101-69 UCLA victory that ended a historic Cougar season.\n\nRoster · Billy Bane · Carlos Bell · Don Chaney · Larry Cooper · Tom Gribben · Niemer Hamood · Elvin Hayes · Theodis Lee · Vern Lewis · George Reynolds · Ken Spain · Kent Taylor ·\n\nVersatility Index: 73\n\n↪ Back\n\n18\n\n18 UConn1999\n\nRecord 34-2 Coach Jim Calhoun Champ Yes\n\nIf the ’99 UConn team was around today, or even 10 years ago, it would have been the resounding favorite every day of the season. The Huskies were led by all-time college greats Rip Hamilton and Khalid El-Amin and went deep with athletes such as Kevin Freeman, Ricky Moore, Albert Mouring, Edmund Saunders and Jake Voskuhl. But it was a program that had never previously been to a Final Four and went into the championship against Duke as a 9.5-point (!) underdog. The Huskies may have been 33-2, but they still had doubters, while their opponent was 37-1 (19-0 in the epic ACC, including the conference tourney)...and already Duke. Far from a blowout, however, fans got a nail-biter of a championship as Rip scored 27 points to lead the Huskies to a 77-74 upset. From there, UConn’s legend (and title counting) only grew.\n\nRoster · Khalid El-Amin · Kevin Freeman · Richard Hamilton · EJ Harrison · Rashamel Jones · Antric Klaiber · Richard Moore · Ricky Moore · Albert Mouring · Stanley Ocitti · Edmund Saunders · Ed Tonella · Jake Voskuhl · Souleymane Wane ·\n\nVersatility Index: 74\n\n↪ Back\n\n48\n\n48 LMU1990\n\nRecord 26-6 Coach Paul Westhead\n\nThe high-flying Lions set an NCAA record with 122.4 ppg but were hit hard by tragedy when second-team All-America forward Hank Gathers collapsed and died during a West Coast Conference tournament semifinal against Portland. LMU somehow regrouped and made a run to the Elite Eight on the strength of guard Bo Kimble, himself a second-team All-American, and long-range marksman Jeff Fryer. Included in the tourney success was a 149-115 dismantling of defending national champ Michigan.\n\nRoster · Jeff Fryer · Hank Gathers · Bo Kimble · Chris Knight · Marcellus Lee · Terrell Lowery · John O’Connell · Tom Peabody · Jeff Roscoe · Christian Scott · Marcus Slater · Per Stumer · Greg Walker · Tony Walker ·\n\nVersatility Index: 81\n\n↪ Back\n\n47\n\n47 Illinois2005\n\nRecord 37-2 Coach Bruce Weber\n\nIt’s a shame these guys had to face a UNC powerhouse in the ’05 title game, because this was a regular-season team for the ages. I did a SLAM feature on them during the season and got to attend their late-January home game against Iowa. The Illini won in OT to move to 19-0, and the school’s since-retired “War Chant” is still ringing in my head. Bruce Weber’s bunch, featuring Dee (Brown), Deron (Williams) and Luther (Head), would reach 29-0 before losing the last game of the regular season. They then rolled to a B1G title and reached the Final Four thanks to a miraculous Elite 8 comeback over Arizona. The loss to UNC in the Championship did little to diminish the memories of this team, which was equally rich in talent and personality.\n\nRoster · James Augustine · Dee Brown · Warren Carter · Luther Head · Jack Ingram · Rich McBride · Fred Nkemdi · Roger Powell · Shaun Pruitt · Nick Smith · Deron Williams ·\n\nVersatility Index: 82\n\n↪ Back\n\n46\n\n46 North Carolina1993\n\nRecord 34-4 Coach Dean Smith Champ Yes\n\nDean Smith’s second national championship squad lacked the star power of some its predecessors but worked extremely well together and featured an eight-man rotation that was clearly better than the sum of its parts. Center Eric Montross, forward George Lynch and guard Donald Williams led the way for the Heels, who won the ACC regular-season crown, outlasted Cincinnati in a classic overtime regional final battle, and then knocked off Michigan’s “Fab Five” to take the national title.\n\nRoster · Dante Calabria · Scott Cherry · Larry Davis · Ed Geth · Pearce Landry · George Lynch · Eric Montross · Derrick Phelps · Henrik Rodl · Brian Reese · Kevin Salvadori · Travis Stephenson · Pat Sullivan · Matt Wenstrom · Donald Williams ·\n\nVersatility Index: 51\n\n↪ Back\n\n45\n\n45 Kansas1997\n\nRecord 34-2 Coach Roy Williams\n\nBecause it had a deep rotation that included five double-figure scorers, including forwards Raef LaFrentz (18.5 ppg, 9.3 rpg) and Paul Pierce (16.3, 6.8), some think Kansas underachieved by losing to eventual national champion Arizona in the Southeast Regional semifinal. The Jayhawks dropped only one contest all season before the tourney defeat, a double-OT thriller at Missouri. Kansas sat atop the AP rankings for much of the season and won the Big 12 regular-season and tournament titles.\n\nRoster · Nick Bradford · Joel Branstrom · Jerod Haase · Raef LaFrentz · CB McGrath · Terry Nooner · Paul Pierce · Scot Pollard · TJ Pugh · Steve Ransom · Ryan Robertson · Billy Thomas · Jacque VaughnBJ Williams ·\n\nVersatility Index: 71\n\n↪ Back\n\n44\n\n44 DePaul1980\n\nRecord 26-2 Coach Ray Meyer\n\nThe Blue Demons entered the ’80 NCAA tournament with a 26-1 record, the top ranking in the AP poll and a No. 1 seed in the West Region. DePaul dropped its second-round contest to UCLA, but it still had a formidable roster that featured sophomore forward Mark Aguirre (26.8 ppg, 7.6 rpg) and freshman Terry Cummings (14.2 ppg, 9.4 rpg), both future top-two NBA draft choices.

Memphis won its first 26 games before falling to Tennessee, and captured the Conference USA regular-season and tournament titles. Led by all-America wing Chris Douglas-Roberts (18.1 ppg, 4.1 rpg) and outstanding freshman point guard Derrick Rose (14.9 ppg, 4.7 apg), the Tigers reached the NCAA tournament championship game but fell in overtime to Kansas.\n\nRoster · Andre Allen · Antonio Anderson · Hashim Bailey · Joey Dorsey · Chris Douglas-Roberts · Robert Dozier · Willie Kemp · Doneal Mack · Chance McGrady · Pierre Niles · Jeff Robinson · Derrick Rose · Shawn Taggart ·\n\nVersatility Index: 72\n\n↪ Back\n\n42\n\n42 Michigan State2000\n\nRecord 32-7 Coach Tom Izzo Champ Yes\n\nThe Spartans weren’t pristine during the regular season but closed the year with 11 straight wins to take the Big Ten tourney crown and NCAA Tournament championship. Nicknamed “The Flintstones,” due to several players on the roster from Flint, MSU won each of its NCAA games by double digits, including the national final over Florida, and was led by charismatic point guard Mateen Cleaves and versatile forward Morris Peterson (16.8 ppg, 6.0 rpg).\n\nRoster · Aloysius Anagonye · Adam Ballinger · Charlie Bell · Mike Chappell · Steve Cherry · Mateen Cleaves · AJ Granger · Andre Hutson · Mat Ishbia · Morris Peterson · Jason Richardson · Brandon Smith · David Thomas ·\n\nVersatility Index: 75\n\n↪ Back\n\n41\n\n41 Notre Dame1974\n\nRecord 26-3 Coach Digger Phelps\n\nEven though the Fighting Irish lost in the NCAA regional semifinal, they made history during the regular season by bumping off UCLA, 71-70, in South Bend to snap the Bruins’ 88-game winning streak. Led by forwards John Shumate (24.2 ppg, 11.0 rpg) and Adrian Dantley (18.3 ppg, 9.1 rpg), ND went 24-2 in the regular season, but after ripping Austin Peay in its NCAA tourney opener, the Irish lost to Michigan in the next round.\n\nRoster · Roger Anderson · Gary Brokaw · Dwight Clay · Peter Crotty · Adrian Dantley · Bill Drew · Thomas Hansen · Toby Knight · Dave Kuzmicz · Gary Novak · Ray Martin · Bill Paterno · Greg Schmelzer · Myron Schuckman · John Shumate · Chris Stevens · Ken Wolbeck · Tom Varga ·\n\nVersatility Index: 68\n\n↪ Back\n\n40\n\n40 Villanova2018\n\nRecord 36-4 Coach Jay Wright Champ Yes\n\nVillanova won its second NCAA title in three years with a team that led the nation in scoring, with 86.6 ppg. The 36-4 Wildcats had six players average double figures in points, topped by guard Jalen Brunson (18.9 ppg) and forward Mikal Bridges (17.7). ’Nova’s smallest margin of victory during the NCAA tournament was 12 points, and it routed Michigan in the final, 79-62 to cap a dominant run.

Smart hit a pair of big jumpers, the last with five seconds remaining, to propel IU to a 74-73 national title win over Syracuse, giving coach Bob Knight his third and final NCAA championship.\n\nRoster · Steve Alford · Rick Calloway · Steve Eyl · Tony Freeman · Dean Garrett · Joe Hillman · Todd Meier · Dave Minor · Jeff Oliphant · Magnus Pelkowski · Brian Sloan · Keith Smart · Kreigh Smith · Daryl Thomas ·\n\nVersatility Index: 42\n\n↪ Back\n\n37\n\n37 UCLA1964\n\nRecord 30-0 Coach John Wooden Champ Yes\n\nThe first of John Wooden’s 10 national title teams rolled to a 30-0 record and jetted past rivals with an offense that scored 88.9 ppg. UCLA was powered by the lethal guard tandem of Gail Goodrich (21.5 ppg) and Walt Hazzard (18.6), while Jack Hirsch and Keith Erickson handled things up front.

UC lost two games early but ripped off 18 straight to close the year, including a Missouri Valley Conference tiebreaker over Bradley to reach the NCAA tournament. Cincinnati was led by 6-9 senior center Paul Hogue (16.8 ppg, 12.4 rpg) and sophomore forward Ron Bonham (14.3, 5.0).

Syracuse fell in the Big East Tournament semifinals but regrouped to go on an NCAA run that ended with an 81-78 victory over Kansas highlighted by Anthony’s 20 points and 10 boards and Hakim Warrick’s block of a Jayhawk three-pointer with 0.7 seconds left.\n\nRoster · Tyrone Albright · Carmelo Anthony · Josh Brooks · Kueth Duany · Billy Edelin · Craig Forth · Xzavier Gaines · Matt Gorman · Gary Hall · Ronneil Herron · Andrew Kouwe · Gerry McNamara · Jeremy McNeil · Josh Pace · Hakim Warrick ·\n\nVersatility Index: 65\n\n↪ Back\n\n32\n\n32 North Carolina2005\n\nRecord 33-4 Coach Roy Williams Champ Yes\n\nTheir foil in the national title game, Illinois, had the once-in-a-lifetime season, the rabid fans and the one-name starters. UNC’s ’05 squad just happened to have the ballers. Marvin Williams, Raymond Felton, Sean May and Rashad McCants all came to Chapel Hill as top-10 recruits. More remarkably, they all left the legendary campus after the ’05 season as top-14 picks in the draft. Dripping with all this talent, it was little shock that they built up through a 26-3 regular season and then jelled even more in the tourney.

The ’Cats ripped through the year with a 30-2 record, thanks to a lineup that featured high-scoring Givens, star point guard Kyle Macy and the bruising interior duo of Rick Robey and Mike Phillips.\n\nRoster · Chuck Aleksinas · Dwane Casey · Truman Claytor · Scott Courts · Fred Cowan · Jack Givens · Chris Gettelfinger · James Lee · Kyle Macy · Mike Phillips · Rick Robey · Jay Shidler · Tim Stephens · LaVon Williams ·\n\nVersatility Index: 74\n\n↪ Back\n\n25\n\n25 Louisville1980\n\nRecord 33-3 Coach Denny Crum Champ Yes\n\nWhen high-flying guard Darrell Griffith chose to play for his hometown Cardinals, he promised a national title. His senior year, he delivered. The “Doctors of Dunk” ripped through the Metro Conference with a deep roster that included Griffith (22.9 ppg), guard Derek Smith (14.8 ppg, 8.3 rpg) and forward Wiley Brown (10.4, 5.6). When the Cards knocked off UCLA, 59-54, in the NCAA title game, U of L coach Denny Crum had his first national championship.\n\nRoster · Tony Branch · Wiley Brown · Roger Burkman · Steve Clark · Daryl Cleveland · Greg Deuser · Jerry Eaves · Darrell Griffith · Rodney McCray · Scooter McCray · Marty Pulliam · Derek Smith · Poncho Wright ·\n\nVersatility Index: 74\n\n↪ Back\n\n24\n\n24 Kansas2008\n\nRecord 37-3 Coach Bill Self Champ Yes\n\nWhile the Jayhawks lacked true star power, seven players ended up on NBA rosters. Kansas won 37 games with balanced scoring and nasty defense. Junior guard Mario Chalmers (12.8 ppg, 4.3 apg) led the way, while guard Brandon Rush (13.3 ppg, 5.1 rpg) and forward Darrell Arthur (12.8, 6.3) were other stalwarts.

The Huskies were led by all-time college greats Rip Hamilton and Khalid El-Amin and went deep with athletes such as Kevin Freeman, Ricky Moore, Albert Mouring, Edmund Saunders and Jake Voskuhl. But it was a program that had never previously been to a Final Four and went into the championship against Duke as a 9.5-point (!) underdog. The Huskies may have been 33-2, but they still had doubters, while their opponent was 37-1 (19-0 in the epic ACC, including the conference tourney)...and already Duke. Far from a blowout, however, fans got a nail-biter of a championship as Rip scored 27 points to lead the Huskies to a 77-74 upset.

But when the two teams met in the Final Four, UCLA spanked the Cougars, 101-69, and then walloped North Carolina, 78-55, to win it all.

Rugged forward Corliss Williamson (20.4 ppg, 7.7 rpg) led the way, supported by smooth wing Scotty Thurman (15.9 ppg) and a deep bench. In the Final Four, Arkansas bumped off Arizona.
