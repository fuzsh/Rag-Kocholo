        "text": "Episode\n\nReferences\n\nAppearances\n\nTranscript\n\nGoofs\n\nGallery\n\n“ 'Phillip Fry: The Original Martian.' It's all lies! Every word of it! He wasn't original, he wasn't a Martian, he wasn't Philip Fry, and since when is he a 'The'? ”\n\n–Fry\n\nOpening Sequence[]\n\nFuturama logo with subtitle, Alienese and (often), cartoon.\n\nPlot[]\n\nIn Old New York, 1974, a young Yancy is jealous of his newborn brother Fry and copies him in almost any way he can.\n\nBack in the year 3002, Fry is getting fed up with his bad luck. In the final blow, he loses nearly all of his money at the racecourse, nearly violently electrocuted trying to hold on to his final dollar and landing in a steel garbage can with leftover hors d'oeuvre being tipped on him.\n\nIn 2 1988-1989 flashbacks, Philip discovers a seven leaf clover, which grants him extraordinary luck and allows him to beat his brother in any contest, from basketball to breakdancing with beats provided by The Noticeably F.A.T.. Fry sets off, with Leela and Bender, to find his clover in the ruins of Old New York and makes his way to his old house, which looks the same outside back then and now.\n\nBack in 1989, a teenage Fry hides the seven-leaf clover inside his Ronco record vault. In the year 3002, Bender opens the record vault, but Philip discovers that the clover is missing, concluding that Yancy must have stolen it. They happen across a statue of Yancy, with the seven-leaf clover in his lapel. The inscription: “Philip J. Fry - First person on Mars” angers Philip because he believes Yancy stole his name and his dream.\n\nProfessor Farnsworth pulls up a biographical movie about “Philip J. Fry”, where the crew learns that he was a millionaire rock star astronaut and is now buried in Orbiting Meadows National Cemetery with the seven-leaf clover. A furious Fry sets off to rob the grave and recover the clover, while Bender gets his grave robbing kit.\n\nThe story jumps back to the early 21st century, where an adult Yancy is rummaging through his missing brother’s music to find something to play at his upcoming wedding. Yancy discovers the seven-leaf clover in Philip's copy of The Breakfast Club soundtrack and takes it.\n\nFry, Leela and Bender reach the grave site in the World Heroes section and start digging. But Fry knocks loose some moss that is covering part of the inscription and begins to read. The story jumps back to Yancy, who is discussing naming his newborn son with his wife. Yancy didn't steal Philip's clover: instead, he had given it to his newborn son and named him Philip J. Fry II in memory of his brother. The inscription on the tomb reads \"Here Lies Philip J. Fry, named for his uncle, to carry on his spirit\". Realizing that Yancy had loved and missed him, Philip I returns the clover to his nephew's grave. And the song \"Don't You (Forget About Me)\" by Simple Minds plays during the ending.\n\nAlienese[]\n\nAt 2:09 sign on the side of the racetrack - \"Not Without My Egg Case: Tonight on Lifetime\".\n\nOngoing Themes[]\n\nFry and Leela[]\n\nFry asks Leela for a good-luck kiss at the racetrack. She obliges by kissing him on the cheek. He indicates that he wanted to make out with her, but she doesn't respond, and he doesn't pursue the matter. It seems that the feelings he expressed in \"Parasites Lost\" have disappeared entirely, and his attraction to her is based primarily on her beauty. It also seems that Leela feels particular sadness toward Fry when he finds out about his nephew's grave, so she tells Bender that Fry needs some time alone.\n\nList of Futurama Episodes in Broadcast Order\n\nSeason 1 Space Pilot 3000 - The Series Has Landed - I, Roommate - Love's Labours Lost in Space - Fear of a Bot Planet - A Fishful of Dollars - My Three Suns - A Big Piece of Garbage - Hell is Other Robots Season 2 A Flight to Remember - Mars University - When Aliens Attack - Fry & the Slurm Factory - I Second That Emotion - Brannigan Begin Again - A Head in the Polls - Xmas Story - Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love? - Put Your Head on My Shoulder - Lesser of Two Evils - Raging Bender - A Bicyclops Built for Two - How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back - A Clone of My Own - The Deep South - Bender Gets Made - The Problem with Popplers - Mother's Day - Anthology of Interest I Season 3 The Honking - War is the H-Word - The Cryonic Woman - Parasites Lost - Amazon Women in the Mood - Bendless Love - The Day the Earth Stood Stupid - That's Lobstertainment! - The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz - The Luck of the Fryrish - The Cyber House Rules - Insane in the Mainframe - Bendin' in the Wind - Time Keeps on Slippin' - I Dated a Robot Season 4 Roswell that Ends Well - A Tale of Two Santas - Anthology of Interest II - Love and Rocket - Leela's Homeworld - Where the Buggalo Roam - A Pharaoh to Remember - Godfellas - Future Stock - A Leela of Her Own - The 30% Iron Chef - Where No Fan Has Gone Before Season 5 Crimes of the Hot -Jurassic Bark - The Route of All Evil - A Taste of Freedom - Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch - Less than Hero - Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles - The Why of Fry - The Sting - The Farnsworth Parabox - Three Hundred Big Boys - Spanish Fry - Bend Her - Obsoletely Fabulous - Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television - The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings Season 6 Bender's Big Score - The Beast with a Billion Backs - Bender's Game - Into the Wild Green Yonder Season 7 Rebirth - In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela - Attack of the Killer App - Proposition Infinity - The Duh-Vinci Code - Lethal Inspection - The Late Philip J.
