        "text": "As originally posted by Tony Miller:\n\n1989-1990 is the first of a dozen years or so where we already have nearly complete data on the boards. That season saw Turner’s national coverage shift from TBS to TNT with Doug Collins joining the fold. TBS still had the Hawks local package, which we do not track in these threads; their announcers, Ron Thulin and Kevin Loughery, also worked TNT games during the playoffs.\n\nNo existing teams moved. The Minnesota Timberwolves and Orlando Magic brought NBA membership to 27 playing in the Metrodome and Orlando Arena respectively; the former joined the Midwest Division while the latter played in the Central.\n\nIn CBS’s final season, the Finals crew remained the same; with Musburger fired and Raftery assigned (almost) exclusively to college, Verne Lundquist and Len Elmore handled the conference finals. Gumbel, Buckner, and Heinsohn returned; James Brown replaced Tim Brant as the fourth PBP announcer. After 17 years and about 800 games, the NBA left CBS on June 14, 1990.\n\nData transcribed from ”’NBA on CBS’ Regular Season Schedules” and ”NBA on CBS Playoff Games”. Additional listings and significant clarifications on which games have been confirmed came from jtgrace1 and Jeff79.\n\nFor the numerous games that are not confirmed, the initials of jtgrace1's guesses are given in parentheses.

Ted Davis calls the games.\n\nHornets: WBT-AM leads a thirty-six-station network that will carry every game, including pre- and postseason. Steve Martin and Gil McGregor return as your announcers. Major sponsors include Anheuser-Busch and First Union Bank.\n\nNuggets: KOA-AM will broadcast all eighty-two regular season games and four preseason games as the head of a twenty-station network in Colorado, Kansas, and Wyoming. Jeff Kingery and Bob Martin will call the action.\n\nRockets: KTRH-AM is the flagship of a nineteen-station network. It will carry games until the start of Houston Astros baseball season, At this time, it hasn't decided whether to put individual conflicting games on another station or offer the rest of the schedule to another station in its entirety. Last year's \"other station\" was KKZR-AM. Gene Peterson will call the play-by-play, with Rockets director of communications Jim Foley handling color.\n\nSpanish-language broadcasts will be available on KXYZ-AM. Rolando Becerra and Alex Lopez-Magrete will describe the action.\n\nSpurs: WOAI-AM is the flagship of a four-station network. The station will broadcast all games; it's a 50,000-watt clear channel that reaches thirty-eight states. Jay Howard will call the action; Andy Everett is the studio host.\n\n(Broadcasting makes two major mistakes here. First, it refers to Jay Howard as both the play-by-play man and the color commentator. If he's calling games by himself, he's the play-by-play guy and there js no color commentator.\n\nSecond, it refers to WOAI-FM as a 50,000-watt, clear-channel station when there's no such thing on the FM band. That's why I have the station listed as an AM. If the Spurs really were on FM in 1989, let me know and I'll make the change.\n\nTimberwolves: WDGY-AM will broadcast all regular season games plus five exhibition games. The station has a three-year contract which can be extended for one, two, or three additional years at the team's option. One of the major radio sponsors is a sports medicine clinic. WDGY is using the start of the Y-Wolves' season to launch its new sports talk show, Sports Line, which will air the day after the team's first game. Kevin Harlan will call the action on both radio and TV (presumably through a simulcast).\n\nJazz: KISN-AM is the head of a network that numbers between ten and twelve stations. This is the final year of their contract, but they hope to renew. All eight preseason games will be carried, along with all regular season and postseason games. Rod Hundley apparently calls radio-only games by himself; his partner from last season, Dave Blackwell, has been demoted to co-hosting the pre- and postgame shows, both of which will be an hour long.\n\nClippers: KRTH-AM will broadcast the team's entire schedule. Ralph Lawler will call the games alone after working with Hubie Brown last year. All of last year's major advertisers will return this year, including Subaru, Goodyear, Arco, and American Airlines.\n\nLakers: KLAC-AM is in the last year of a five-year contract. Negotiations are underway for a new contract. Major advertisers on one or more media include Toyota. Miller Beer, Coors Beer, Great Western Bank, and the California Lottery.\n\nKings: KFBK-AM will air four preseason games, all eighty-two regular season games, and all postseason games. They will also produce pre- and postgame shows. Gary Gerould will call the play-by-play; no color commentator was mentioned in the article. Makor sponsors include BMW. Suburban Ford, and Foster Farms Chicken.\n\nSuperSonics: KJR-AM, which is owned by the team, will carry all eighty-two regular season games. Thirty simulcasts will feature the television call of Kevin Calabro and Rick Barry; for the fifty-two radio-only games, Calabro will be joined by Jim Marsh.\n\nWarriors: The team has signed a three-year contract to buy time for all eighty-two regular season games on KNBR-AM San Francisco. Steve Physioc will call the play-by-play; no color commentator was mentioned in the article. Major sponsors are Budweiser, Coca-Cola, Chevron, Farmers Insurance, Frito-Lay, Foot Locker, the local Acura Dealers, the California Lottery, and Pacific Gas and Electric.\n\nSuns: KTAR-AM heads an eight-station Arizona network that will carry all preseason and regular season games. Director of broadcasting Al McCoy will work radio-only games alone; for games televised on KUTP-TV, his call with Dick Van Arsdale will be simulcast. Major sponsors include Anheuser-Busch, Dial Corporation, and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Arizona.\n\nTrail Blazers: The team has a new five-year contract with KEX-AM to broadcast all games. KEX will head a twenty-eight-station, thirty-market network. The team also owns its own satellite downlink with which it controls distribution of the games. Bill Schonley and Geoff Petrie will call the action. Major sponsors include the Oregon Lottery, Jeep-Eagle, Texaco, Anheuser-Busch. and Farmers Insurance.\n\nNow let's look at radio in the Atlantic:\n\nCeltics: WEEI-AM will head a fifty-five-station network; this is the third year of a seven-year contract. Longtime play-by-play man Johnny Most is out indefinitely due to triple-bypass heart surgery, so last year's color commentator, Glenn Ordway, will call the action until Most returns. Doug Brown will provide color commentary.\n\nThe Celtics reached an agreement to purchase WEEI last month (September 1989), but the deal had yet to be approved by the FCC at press time.\n\nBullets: WWDC-AM is the flagship of a six-station network. One or two more stations may join as the season progresses. This is the final year of the station's contract. Seventy-eight games will air, including two exhibition games (forty-one home, thirty-seven road). Charlie Slowes will call the play-by-play.\n\n(If you take away the two exhibition games, that leaves seventy-six regular season games on WWDC. What happened to the other six? Were there conflicts with Georgetown basketball or the Capitals? If so, where did the Bullets end up, since they obviously got the short end of the stick?)\n\nNets: The team has bought time on WNEW-AM to broadcast eighty-five games (presumably, three exhibition games plus all eighty-two regular season games. Howard David, Jim Spanarkel, and Mike O'Koren will call the action. O'Koren will also provide features at various times throughout the broadcasts.\n\nHeat: WQAM-AM is the head of a five-station Florida network that will carry all but the first preseason game (a total of seven) and every regular season and playoff game as well as the All-Star Game. The regular season games will also be broadcast in Spanish on WAQI-AM. Announcers have noy been named for either broadcast team at press time.\n\nKnicks: WFAN-AM is in the third year of a ten-year contract. It will broadcast a total of eighty-three games. There is only one conflict with the Rangers this year; on that day. the Knicks will be carried by WPAT-AM. Jim Karvellas and Walt \"Clyde\" Frazier are your announcers.\n\n76ers: WIP-AM is the head of an eighteen-station network in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware. and Maryland. Jon Gurevitch will call the play-by-play; TV play-by-play man Neil Funk will provide color commentary for home games. A road color commentator had not been named at press time. Major sponsors are Meridian Bank, Gatorade, and American Airlines.\n\nThere are seventeen dates when 76ers basketball games and Philadelphia Flyers hockey games conflict. Since the Flyers own WIP, they take priority. On those days, the 76ers will be heard on WHAT-AM.\n\nNow let's look at radio in the Central for 1989-90:\n\nMagic: WWNZ-AM will broadcast every scheduled exhibition and regular season game. David Steele will call the action. Major sponsors include Pepsi, Oldsmobile, Anheuser-Busch, and Olive Garden Restaurants.\n\nHawks: WGST-AM has signed a new three-year contract to broadcast all scheduled games, including playoff games. Steve Holman is your announcer. Sponsors include Anheuser-Busch, Chevron, McDonalds. and Goodyear Auto Service.\n\nBulls: WLUP-AM will broadcast all scheduled games, including playoff games.
