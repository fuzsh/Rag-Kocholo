        "text": "One of the narratives I keep hearing about Coach Crean and the state of the IU basketball program is this idea that there's a standard that was upheld in the past that's somehow not important to the coaches or players anymore. All this transferring. All these poor decisions by the players who should know better. All this waffling from the coaches over when and how to suspend or dismiss players. There's a vibe that this isn't what Indiana stands for or has stood for in the past.\n\nNow, admittedly, I've only been a fan of Indiana basketball in the post-Knight era. I didn't grow up watching IU basketball and don't have the reverence for Coach Knight that other fans have. I don't have an agenda against the guy, either. I just couldn't shake the feeling that the issues we're seeing now must have come up in the past, and I was curious how they were handled. So I did a little digging.\n\nWhat I found are several examples where Coach Knight handled similar issues in similar ways to Coach Crean, if not less severely than Coach Crean. Let's look at these and see if we can't get some perspective on our current situation and our program's history.\n\nJay Edwards\n\nAfter earning Indiana's Mr. Basketball in 1987 and Big Ten Freshman of the Year in 1988, Jay Edwards was unstoppable in 1989 on his way to being named an All-American and Big Ten Player of the Year. He left for the NBA after two years at IU. This article from his last month as a Hoosier praises Coach Knight's patience with the team in general, but it goes into particular detail on Edwards.\n\nWhile his jump shot has always been a straight arrow, Edwards' personal life hasn't. He is only a sophomore, yet he has spent considerable time on Knight's bad side. In December 1987, Edwards was suspended for five games for academic deficiencies. Last summer, continued academic troubles temporarily cost him his scholarship. Then, as practice opened this season, he failed a drug test administered by the school. Sports Illustrated reported that Edwards tested positive for marijuana, as well as alcohol.\n\nGiven Knight's adamant stance on drugs...he might have chosen expulsion over compassion when it came to Edwards' transgression. But he decided to give him a second chance.\n\n\"I think kids deserve a second chance,\" he said yesterday. \"I've done that in the past with kids.\"\n\nKnight goes on in the article to defend his decision-making from the cynics who would say he only kept Edwards because of his star player status. But can we just review this...\n\nOne suspension for academic reasons in December of his 1st year\n\nOne temporarily-lost scholarship for academic issues between 1st and 2nd year\n\nA drug test that was positive for marijuana and alcohol at start of 2nd year\n\nImagine the optics! Pick any player on today's roster and tell me they would still be on the team after those three offenses. Does anyone remember what the fanbase was saying then? Was there clamoring for Knight to do more? Was there a standard to uphold? Is there context that I'm missing here?\n\nThe 1978 Dismissals\n\nIn 1978, Coach Knight dismissed three players involved in drug use. He also suspended five others. In his autobiography, he talks about returning home from a tournament in Alaska having lost the first two games:\n\nThat season started badly...Two weeks after we returned home, that Alaska trip came back to hit me as hard as anything ever has in coaching.\n\nI don't know how much it had been used before. I don't know how much losing those games had to do with it, or how much using it had to do with losing those games. But in Alaska, somebody got some marijuana and one night seven of our players sat around a room smoking it.\n\nIn some cases, at least according to them, that was the only time it ever happened. And there were some awfully good kids involved, some of the best kids I ever had. There's no player I've ever had that I liked or enjoyed more than Mike Woodson, and he was involved. That was very tough to handle.\n\nMaybe the most difficult thing in that for me was personal. It was hard for me to believe that--as opposed to the whole drug situation as I was--I was a coach who had seven players involved in using marijuana...\n\n...But in this situation I knew I had to do some things. I dropped three players and put the others on probation...I had to make some hard decisions fast...I think I handled it the best way I could have.\n\nThe shock, the disappointment, the care and concern for his players not only as players but as young men, the way in which he took it personally, and the way in which he doled out discipline in a case-by-case basis, some dismissals and some suspensions. So much of this reminds me of Coach Crean, the way he talks about these situations, and the way he makes decisions on how to handle each situation accordingly.\n\nWas the fanbase okay with this? Can you imagine the outcry if seven players at one time were caught using marijuana on today's team? Can you imagine if that team didn't make the NCAA tournament (which the 1978-79 did not, although they did win the NIT)? I can only imagine what today's headlines would say and what today's columnists would be calling for.\n\nThe Late '70s Creaning\n\nMost IU fans know that Larry Bird was at Indiana University and planned to play for Coach Knight but decided to transfer to Indiana State before the season began, citing that Indiana was too big for him.\n\nBut did you know that Bird's transfer was just one of many transfers over a two-year period?\n\nDerek Holcomb, a 6-11 center, transferred to Illinois and helped them to a #2 national ranking. He blocked 62 shots in their first 15 games.\n\nMark Haymore, played two years at Indiana, then transferred to the University of Massachusetts, where he led the team in scoring (17 ppg) and rebounds (10 rpg).\n\nRich Valavicius, played on the '76 Indiana team, then transferred to Auburn, where he averaged 15 ppg and was their lockdown defender.\n\nBob Bender, also played on the '76 Indiana team, then transferred to Duke, where he contributed 6 ppg, 4 apg, and averaged over 50% from the field.\n\nThis article goes into more depth about these players and their potential as a unit if they had stayed together. But it ends with a sort of oh-well that today's columnists would easily scream over:\n\nIf [Knight] ever pondered over the team that could have been, he'd probably be hitting himself right now. It is always fun to wonder what could have been--hasn't Michigan been doing that for years?\n\nHaha. Michigan dig. Knight should ponder. It's fun. Fun to wonder. It's all fun. Not in today's world. Nope. In today's world, this pattern of transfers is a full-on indictment of the coach.\n\nSo when you think back fondly on the hardline disicipline, the lineup stability, the lack of poor teenage decision-making--and especially when you use those memories to further criticize your current coach's decisions as if he was unable to uphold yesterday's standards---just try to remind yourself that you're not actually remembering the past. You're romanticizing it."
