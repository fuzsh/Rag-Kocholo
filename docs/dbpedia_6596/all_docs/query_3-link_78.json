        "text": "Michael Ayala retired from the California Highway Patrol in 2009 after putting in 30 years. But he never really stopped working. He just shifted his focus to his church and local civic groups around his Sonora home, filling needs, lending his time, getting things done.\n\nâHe had the heart and the talent and the personality to meet just about any demand,â said his daughter Erin Natter. âHis life was defined by service. He was so charismatic that people just gravitated toward him. And he embraced that.â\n\nBorn in Burlingame and raised in San Bruno, Ayala married his high school sweetheart Nancy in 1974 in Long Beach and joined the Highway Patrol five years later. Though that choice of vocation was made with an eye toward stability, Ayala soon realized that law enforcement was a good fit for his leadership and problem-solving skills. During his career, he served as a patrolman and sergeant, retiring as a lieutenant commander in Sonora.\n\nAyala then shifted gears, stepping in to be the executive director of the Tuolumne County Chamber of Commerce for three years when the organization was struggling. Ayala also was active with the Kiwanis Club and Sierra Bible Church in Sonora. Possessing a personality as big as his heart, he was known and liked by just about everyone in the small community.\n\nâIf someone needed help with bills, heâd throw a dinner,â Natter said. âIf a fundraiser came along, heâd organize it. He was a high-energy guy and loved diving in to help out.â\n\nBeing a huge San Francisco Giants fan â he and Nancy and their two daughters, Erin and Heather, would drive from Modesto to Candlestick Park when they held season tickets â Ayala was thrilled to celebrate the teamâs three championships during the past decade, sharing that delight with his family.\n\nâHe was a very present father,â Natter said.\n\nAyala was hospitalized and diagnosed with COVID-19 shortly after Thanksgiving. He died in Sonora on Dec. 6. He was 66.\n\nIn addition to his wife and daughters, he is survived by his mother, Mary; a sister, Lisa; and four grandchildren.\n\nThe deadliest American epidemic of the 1950s was polio, which killed thousands of children and paralyzed tens of thousands more.\n\nA Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., first-grader named Penelope A. Miller, better known in her grown-up years as Penny Foreman of Clovis, was part of the effort that defeated the disease.\n\nAs researchers searched for weapons against the virus in 1954, 6-year-old Penny and her 8-year-old brother Jim joined thousands of boys and girls in an 11-state medical trial, receiving an injection that included either the new vaccine or a placebo.\n\nJim stayed healthy. Penny didn't.\n\nBy April 1955, when Jonas Salk's approved polio vaccine was shipped nationwide, Penny had lost use of her legs, with both arms severely weakened. Their father later told the children that she had received the placebo.\n\nBut she retained determination, wit and patience enough to earn a college degree, marry, raise children and work 35 years for Fresno County and Fresno's Community Regional Medical Center, helping connect people with services.\n\nShe was \"incredibly resilient,\" said Jim Miller, of Fresno.\n\nIn all, three of the seven Miller children would contract polio, posing steep challenges for their parents, a newspaperman and a nurse. Penny's case was the most severe, requiring long hospital stays, several surgeries and the implantation of steel rods to keep her spine straight.\n\nAt 6, \"she spent three months in this iron lung, looking out at the world from a tilted mirror that was just above her face,\" Jim Miller said.\n\nA few years later, after the family had moved to California's San Joaquin Valley, her younger brother Erick said, \"she spent a year in a full body cast in our living room.\"\n\nBut she emerged strong enough to attend school alongside Erick, a year younger. From seventh grade to the end of 12th grade at Hoover High School in Fresno, he pushed her wheelchair from class to class. Both earned top marks.\n\n\"She definitely knew what she needed and she was not shy about speaking up,\" said Erick Miller.\n\nHer sister Joanna Miller Hoffman of Simi Valley remembers Penny braving risky rides at the Fresno County Fair, sneaking out for a midnight swim at a community pool, and bucking her father's wishes in order to attend rock concerts with a boyfriend.\n\nAfter high school, Foreman went on to Cal State Fresno, where she earned an English degree and teaching credential. Soon after, she married and gave birth to a son, Josh Coddington.\n\nShe also learned to drive a specially outfitted van; campaigned for the rights of people with disabilities; and began work for Fresno County, first in social services, later helping hospital patients get help and handle paperwork.\n\nHer first marriage didn't last long. After it dissolved, her sister Joanna recalled, \"she was a single working mother with a baby. And yet I'd go to see her at her house, and her house was cleaner than I was keeping my apartment.\"\n\nWhen her son complained about one small thing or another, he remembers her telling him: \"If you have something thatâs a challenge, figure out a way through it. Thereâs always a solution.â\n\nIn 1986, Josh's mother married Robert Foreman, gave birth to a daughter and became stepmother to six children from her husband's previous marriage. And she continued working. The family home in Clovis was busy.\n\n\"It was a family of 10 in the house for a long time,\" her daughter, Holly Foreman, said.\n\nStill, on many weekends and holidays Foreman steered her van toward Yosemite, Lake Tahoe, Disneyland or the Ventura County coast, a couple of kids aboard. Later, she'd often join one or two sisters for museum exhibits, theater or concerts in Los Angeles.\n\nFamily members said Foreman worked into the early 2000s, when weakening muscles and lung problems forced her to retire. Her husband died in 2016.\n\nForeman spent the last 3 1/2 years at Pacifica Hospital of the Valley in Sun Valley. She was dependent on a ventilator but remained in touch (and frequent âWords with Friendsâ competition) with loved ones, using her iPad as a window to the world. She was there when the COVID-19 pandemic erupted in March.\n\n\"We knew if COVID got anywhere near her, she had no defense,\" said Hoffman.\n\nAbout a week before Christmas â a few days after the first COVID vaccinations in the U.S., but before any vaccine could reach her â Foreman tested positive. Once again, a notorious virus had reached her just ahead of a new vaccine. On Dec. 29, Foreman died, age 73, her death attributed to pneumonia and COVID.\n\nBesides her lifelong tenacity, family members said, they would remember her excitement and laughter at a family Christmas party 10 days before her death.\n\nGathering by Zoom, two dozen relatives from three generations sang and rang chimes through three carols.\n\nâShe was someone who really took life and made the best of it,â said Josh Coddington.\n\nForeman is survived by daughter Holly Foreman of Fresno, son Josh Coddington of Phoenix, granddaughter Quinn Coddington; stepchildren Erik, Joel, Jacob, Michael and Paul Foreman and Amber Benoy; and siblings Jim Miller, Erick Miller, Alan Miller, Matt Miller, Laurie Mobley and Joanna Miller Hoffman.\n\nThe Rev. Frederick K.C. Price, a televangelist who founded the Crenshaw Christian Center, a South Los Angeles megachurch with a 10,000-seat sanctuary, died Friday from COVID-19. He was 89. His family said he had been in the hospital suffering from the virus infection for the last five weeks.\n\nOpened in 1989 on the former site of Pepperdine University, Priceâs South Vermont Avenue church was topped by a massive aluminum sphere known as the FaithDome, 320 feet in diameter and 63 feet high. At the time, newspapers proclaimed it the largest geodesic church structure in the world, and it remains a landmark visible to air travelers arriving at Los Angeles International Airport.\n\nâHe chose to build the FaithDome in the inner city, as opposed to doing it in the suburbs, because he wanted to minister to the disenfranchised,â said Angela Evans, his daughter and the church president. âHe had a heart for his own people, people of color. He wanted to lift them out of their ills and raise their hopes, that in God they could be something, do something, raise their children well.â\n\nThe Crenshaw Christian Center has served as a coronavirus testing site since early in the pandemic, and recently as a vaccination site. In a statement, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti described Price as âa towering giant of our faith community in Los Angeles and an inspiring force for justice worldwide,â and added: âHis ministry had local roots, but a global impact â providing care, resources, and a helping hand to the most vulnerable in our city and far beyond our borders.â\n\nA Santa Monica native, Price met his future wife, Betty, in the early 1950s when they were both students at Dorsey High School. Priceâs family says his religious awakening began when he followed her to a Christian tent revival service. He joined her at a Baptist church, and preached for years while making a living at other jobs, such as driving a truck for Coca-Cola.\n\nâHe was the consummate family man, and thatâs one of the hallmarks of his ministry and his life,â Evans said. âThatâs why his children are so devastated. He was everything.â\n\nShe said her father wrote more than 50 books on religious themes. Price and his wife were married for 67 years. They lost an 8-year-old son when a car struck him in 1962.\n\nâHe was generous to his children,â said Evans. âIf they needed something, he didnât say, âYou know, I pulled myself up by my bootstraps, you do the same.ââ\n\nPrice founded the Crenshaw Christian Center in Inglewood in 1973, and his popularity was hugely boosted by his appearance on television and radio, including a show called âEver Increasing Faith.â\n\nPrice was a preacher in the charismatic tradition, with a belief in miraculous healing. He also preached what some described as the âprosperity gospel,â or the idea that God rewards faith with abundance, material and otherwise.\n\nAs crowds multiplied, Price dreamed of assembling his congregation in one room. Frederick Price Jr., who took over his fatherâs pulpit in 2009, said his father got the idea for the FaithDome after walking into the geodesic dome that used to house the Spruce Goose seaplane in Long Beach.\n\nâHe realized we needed another building. âHow can we get everyone in the same building? How can we get a good seat for everyone in the house?ââ he said. âThe geodesic dome can be pillarless. He said, âYeah, this is it.ââ\n\nThe geodesic dome was also much cheaper than traditional architecture would have been for a sanctuary of its size. When the FaithDome opened in 1989, The Times called it âthe nationâs largest house of worship,â with a 16,000-member congregation that made it the largest Protestant church in Southern California.\n\nâWeâre located where we are, where others might not want to come in and help,â said Price Jr. âIt was important to him to be that oasis in the desert, so to speak.â\n\nThe church has a school and a youth center, hosts food and blood drives, and does prison outreach. It employs about 150 people. At times, the church has boasted membership of 28,000, a number the family says encompasses parishioners throughout its history.\n\nPrice Jr. said that before the pandemic, the church had a congregation of roughly 6,000 people, a number that he estimates has grown massively during COVID-19 lockdown, with online videos reaching 20,000 to 30,000 viewers.\n\nBesides his widow, Price Jr. and Evans, Price is survived by daughters Stephanie Buchanan and Cheryl Price, as well as 10 grandchildren.\n\nWhen Taurino and Silvia Rivera were laid to rest beneath a California pepper tree on a Friday morning, their white caskets were surrounded by their three sons and daughters-in-law and\n\nseven grandchildren, members of the church they founded in San Diego and pastors who had grown close to them during their years of ministry.\n\nThe couple, who had grown up together in a small town in Oaxaca and had been inseparable since, were buried together after dying weeks apart from COVID-19. Taurinoâs casket was lowered first, and then his wifeâs on top of his.\n\nMissing from the scene was their fourth son, Ismael Rivera, who watched the final moments of the ceremony on his phone while standing outside a restaurant in Tijuana. Jesimiel Rivera, the third son, held his phone over the grave as his brother sobbed on the other end of the Zoom call.\n\nâIn that moment, thousands of thoughts just raced through my head, with one question lingering â why?â said Ismael Rivera, who prefers the name Isaac.\n\nThe second of the four siblings, Isaac, had not been able to see his parents for almost a decade. He had been counting down to the summer of 2021 when he would no longer be banned from the United States and could request a visa to visit his family. His parents were not legally in the U.S. and could not cross south to see him.\n\nAt the funeral, the oldest son, Joel, read a letter from Silviaâs father in Oaxaca, who hadnât seen his daughter since she left roughly 30 years ago. His hands shook as he held the piece of notebook paper.\n\nâI love you forever,â he read in Spanish. âI will carry you in my heart.â\n\nThe Rivera family immigrated to the United States in the early 1990s when the four brothers were young children. They made City Heights in San Diego their new home.\n\nSilvia and Taurino began working at a McDonaldâs together, rising as early as 3:30 a.m. to arrive on time for their morning shifts.\n\nThe family didnât have much money, but the sons said their parents always found a way to celebrate birthdays and take care of them. And even before the parents shifted to working full time as pastors, faith was a big part of family life.\n\nJesimiel, remembered sitting on the floor as a child and watching his father play worship songs on a guitar.\n\nâJust seeing dad so big and the song and his voice, and then everybody around, the adults were just clapping and singing â everything was so joyful,â Jesimiel said. âI remember feeling in a magical place at that moment.â\n\nHe remembered, too, going as a teen with his father to minister at a rehabilitation center, and the way his fatherâs words would ease the people there.\n\nTaurino took Daniel Rivera, the youngest of the four sons, to piano classes as a child, and they would play together. Daniel eventually became a pastor as well.\n\nThe family home would fill with people who needed help â a couch to sleep on, some food from the refrigerator.\n\nâThey left a big legacy for me and my brothers to follow,â Isaac said.\n\nIn recalling their mother, each son remembered intimate moments when they were alone with her, and the safety and love they felt in her presence.\n\nEven after Jesimiel became an adult, she could always sense when something was bothering him.\n\nâI could hide things from Dad, but never from Mom,â he said.\n\nAnd, of course, they remembered her food â her chilaquiles, her atole, her spicy chicken soup and her mole.\n\nThe brothers cannot cross the border to console with Isaac without also becoming stuck outside of the U.S., though the three are protected for now by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which grants work permits and temporary protection from deportation to undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children.\n\nIn 2011, the year before the program was created, Isaac was stopped at one of the Border Patrol checkpoints that are scattered across the southwestern United States and ended up voluntarily returning to Mexico. Because of U.S. immigration laws, he was barred from coming back for at least 10 years.\n\nâWhat hurts me a lot is that for the last 10 years, I wasnât over there to tell them how much I love them, how much they meant to me, hugging them really tight and telling them, âI love you, Dad. I love you, Mom,â and being there on Motherâs Day and Fatherâs Day and their wedding anniversary and birthdays,â Isaac said. âAnd now that will never happen.â\n\nOne of the things that brings him comfort now is that even in death, his parents are still together.\n\nâThey were two human beings glued together everywhere they went,â Isaac said. âNow theyâre in heaven together forever and thatâs what makes me happy. Thatâs the only thing that makes me happy.â\n\nIn 2011, Taurino and Silvia started a church called Fe Esperanza y Amor â faith, hope and love â and, according to the church members they left behind, they embodied those values in their work.\n\nAfter the holidays, Daniel was the first in the Rivera family to show COVID-19 symptoms. He was hospitalized, followed by his mother Silvia and then his father Taurino.\n\nThough Daniel recovered, Silvia and Taurino remained on ventilators. Early in the morning, on Feb. 1, Taurino died, and the family began to grieve and to plan for his burial.\n\nSilvia seemed to improve. Doctors took her off the ventilator and moved her to a rehabilitation center.\n\nNo one told Silvia about Taurinoâs death, but many believe that she figured it out on her own and followed after him.\n\nâI think in a way she did know because my parentsâ bond was so strong,â Daniel said.\n\nEarly on Feb. 19, Isaac got a call from his brothers across the border.\n\nHis mother, too, was now dead from the virus. He sat in his car and wept.\n\nâI was barely dealing with the situation with my dad,â Isaac said. âDeep inside Iâm hurting, deep inside Iâm broken in so many pieces. I donât know how Iâm going to get myself back together.â\n\nDaniel is now pastor at Fe Esperanza y Amor in addition to his own church in San Marcos. On his first Sunday preaching there after his fatherâs death, he told the church they would follow the guidance that his father had given them â to serve God and to live in peace.\n\nHe urged them to find solace in one of Taurinoâs most common refrains. âGod is good, all the time.â\n\nAt 5 feet 11 and just 150 pounds, Vidal Garay looked like he was all muscle when he was young.\n\nâTo me, he was like a superhero,â said Richard Garay, Vidalâs second son. He remembered his father telling him and his brothers never to be scared of chasing their dreams.\n\nâYou guys are American citizens,â Richard recalls him saying. âYou guys can get your education and ... do whatever you want to do.â\n\nBorn in the town of El Nayar in Mexicoâs Nayarit state, Vidal grew up poor on a ranch. He began working at age 5 or 6, collecting water from the river, grabbing satchels of corn and grinding it to make tortillas for dinner.\n\nVidal immigrated to the United States when he was 14. He worked the fields, climbed power poles to fix cables, and finally arrived at QueensCare Health Centers in East Los Angeles as a security officer.\n\nRichard remembered his father leaving in the morning before the sun was up. But he said Vidal rarely spoke about how hard he worked.\n\nAfter the family had dinner together, Vidal would take a shower and grab his favorite Spanish language newspaper, La OpiniÃ³n. On his days off, Vidal would kick his feet up, sitting on the porch with coffee and cigarette, and spend hours poring over the newspaper.\n\nFor English reading, he loved nonfiction, such as David Bellaviaâs âHouse to House,â about the Iraq war, and Marcus Luttrellâs âLone Survivor,â about Navy SEALs in Afghanistan.\n\nVidal was known as a âcool dad,â Richard said. He was lively, savoring Spanish corridos, and largely left the teenagers alone. But he would sometimes come in and offer, âDo you guys want to hear a joke?â\n\nâMy dad was strict, donât get me wrong,â said Richard. âBut he never judged us. He never got mad when we did something bad. He just guided us.â\n\nâWe were always able to communicate anything and everything to my dad,â Richard said. Vidal always told him and his brothers that he wanted to be their best friend first and their dad second.\n\nIn his free time, fishing was Vidalâs favorite hobby. The family spent a lot of time fishing at the Redondo Beach Pier. Vidal was also a good cook. Besides fish, he was known for his pork riblets in red salsa.\n\nA romantic, Vidal was vocal about emotions, writing letters to Norma, his wife of 34 years, and was never ashamed of hugging or kissing her in front of their children.\n\nOn May 29, Richard felt mild symptoms of COVID-19, with a headache and a runny nose. He self-quarantined for four days at home and got a positive test result on June 4. On the same day, Vidal also tested positive, after losing his sense of smell and taste.\n\nThe two spent days quarantining in the same room and briefly spoke about dying together. âIf you go, then Iâll go,â Richard said his father told him.\n\nRichard had mild asthma but hadnât used an inhaler for more than 12 years. Vidal suffered from sideroblastic anemia, a very rare form characterized by fatigue, shortness of breath and feelings of weakness.\n\nOn the eighth day, Richard woke up gasping for air. It felt, he said, as if âsomebody pulled a bag over your head.â\n\nRichard was taken to the hospital. âThe last words I told my father was, âDad, I donât think Iâm going to make it.â And that was the last time my dad saw me.â\n\nRichard recovered. Vidal died June 20 at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. He was 60.\n\nRichard said 28 extended family members, including him and his father, have tested positive for COVID-19, most recovering at home, but they donât know how they contracted the virus.\n\nVidal is survived by his wife, Norma; sons Juan, Richard and Benjamin; multiple siblings (his son isnât sure how many), and three grandchildren. Another granddaughter is expected to be born soon.\n\nAfter she tested positive for coronavirus in March, nurse Brittany Bruner-Ringo quarantined herself in a Torrance hotel room, but she never stopped taking care of people.\n\nThe first employee infected in an outbreak at a dementia care facility in West Los Angeles, Bruner-Ringo called and texted colleagues that subsequently fell ill, encouraging them daily to keep a good attitude and reassuring them that they were all going to be OK.\n\nâBrittany was our cheerleader,â one recalled.\n\nThe hopeful messages stopped in early April when a clerk at the hotelâs front desk summoned an ambulance for Bruner-Ringo. She was taken to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where she died in the intensive-care unit 19 days later. She was 32.\n\nGrowing up in Oklahoma, Bruner-Ringo saw a nursing career as a kind of birthright. Her mother and grandmother were nurses, and her personality was a natural fit for the field: Upbeat, empathetic and helpful.\n\nâHelping others made our sister happy. She was so compassionate,â her sisters Breanna and Marriana Hurd wrote in an email to The Times.\n\nAfter getting her degree as a licensed vocational nurse, she worked in Ohio and then a position as a traveling nurse brought her to L.A. She signed on full-time in 2019 with the Silverado Beverly Place, which specializes in treating Alzheimerâs and other types of dementia, and worked often with third floor patients with the mildest cases.\n\nShe loved sunflowers and coworkers described her as sharing the flowerâs warm toughness. At staff meetings, she was known to speak up about residents she felt needed more attention.\n\nâShe was just kind-hearted. I donât think she really thought of it as a job,â Breanna recalled in an interview. âShe never complained about her job, even once, as much as we talked.â\n\nBruner-Ringo was in her near constant contact with family members back in Oklahoma. She and her sisters kept video chats open as they went through their days.\n\nâWhen we werenât on the phone, we would spend time texting and sending funny memes/videos in our group chat. Brittany was the funniest person weâve ever known,â her sisters recalled.\n\nWhen Silverado allowed a new patient from New York to move into the residence March 19, she called her mother, a veteran nurse in Oklahoma City, for advice.\n\nKim Bruner-Ringo told The Times her daughter said the man arrived with symptoms of COVID-19, including fever and coughing. The Silverado has denied this and provided medical records indicating he was asymptomatic when Bruner-Ringo initially examined him.\n\nIn any case, he was so sick the next day that an ambulance rushed him to Cedars-Sinai where he was diagnosed with COVID-19. In the weeks and months that followed, 89 other residents and staff contracted the disease. Thirteen would die.\n\nYoung and healthy, Bruner-Ringo seemed sure to beat the virus. Even after she was placed on a ventilator, she remained in good spirits.\n\nThe hospital nurses told her family âshe would smile and her eyes were open most of the time. She was able to nod, follow commands,â her mother said.\n\nHer vital signs were so strong that doctors discussed taking her off the ventilator, but the virus ultimately proved too strong.\n\nShe was buried May 1 in Oklahoma City. Her grave was covered with baskets of roses, zinnias, carnations, lilies. Her coworkers sent sunflowers.\n\nRead the full obituary\n\nOn Wednesday evenings in retirement, Richard (Dick) Rutledge would put on a bright purple dress shirt, a floral-print tie, white jeans and cowboy boots. With his wife, Norma, who wore a flared skirt that matched his tie, he was off to their weekly square dancing class, âSkirts and Flirts.â\n\nIn more ways than one, Rutledge and his wife were the perfect match. While their children remember their mother as the energetic, strict one in the house, Rutledge was the calm, steady presence who kept the family in balance.\n\nâHe kept us centered; he never got flustered,â his eldest son, Bill, remembered. âEverything was under control when he was around.â\n\nWhen Norma died five years ago, Rutledge moved from their San Leandro home, eventually landing at Oakmont Senior Living in Folsom, where he contracted COVID-19. In mid-April, after the first case erupted at the home, almost all residents were tested. Rutledge, along with 17 other residents and three staff members, tested positive.\n\nTwo weeks went by without any symptoms, but suddenly his fever spiked and his breathing became troubled.\n\nâIt happened very quickly,â Bill said. âHe just crashed.â\n\nRutledge died on May 6 at the nursing home with a hospice nurse by his side. His family, unable to enter due to COVID-19 restrictions, said their farewells the night before, through the window by his bed.\n\nThe 87-year-old was a rare third-generation San Franciscan, born into a small home in the Noe Valley district, and remained a Bay Area resident for most of his life. He attended Notre Dame University and went on to serve five years as a lieutenant in the U.S Air Force Reserve, after which he went back to school at UC Berkeley to earn an MBA. But soon after, with the early realization that computers would be the wave of the future, he enrolled at Holy Names College in Oakland to study mathematics and computer science, and then began his long career as a computer systems analyst for various companies.\n\nHis career, while successful, was more about pragmatism than passion. More than anything, he saw it as a reliable way to support his family, according to Bill. His children describe him as the ultimate family man, and a real people person.\n\nâIt sounds cheap to say, but itâs true: Everyone liked him,â Bill recalled.\n\nBill remembered a story that captures his fatherâs charm: Rutledge and his wife first met on a blind date in 1960. When he asked her, \"Do you like chicken?\" Norma said she did. Offering his arm, Rutledge said, \"Grab a wing.\" A month later, they were engaged.\n\nSurvivors include his six children, Bill, Mary, Joyce, Robert, Stephen and Susan, and eight grandchildren. Due to restrictions on public gatherings, no funeral service is currently scheduled.\n\n\"Where's my doughnut?\"\n\nIt was always one of the first questions Raul J. Arce would ask his daughter when she visited him. So she made certain before the three-hour drives from her home in Tustin to his El Centro nursing home to stop at the doughnut shop to pick up a couple of glazed pastries.\n\n\"He loved his sweets,\" recalled Adela Arroyo, Arce's only child.\n\n\"He had diabetes, but even when I took him to the doctor, I'd make sure he had some Mexican lollipops to entertain him. The nurses would still ask him: 'Mr. Arce, do you want a lollipop?' I'd be, like, 'I already gave him two!'\"\n\nArroyo's mother, Guadalupe â who was married to Arce for 58 years until her death in 2017 â would bake him pineapple cakes and take tamales or plantains to him at work.\n\nArce was born in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, and met his wife at a nightclub near the border in Mexicali. She was dancing with another man, but Arce managed to charm her nonetheless, and a month later they wed. They moved to Calexico after obtaining U.S. citizenship.\n\nAt first, Arce made ends meet by working in the fields harvesting lettuce, traveling throughout California to find the best crops.\n\nLater, he became a school custodian, a job he held for two decades before retiring.\n\nA devout Jehovah's Witness, he spent most of his free time at church, and enjoyed attending celebrations for those in the community.\n\n\"Whenever there was a wedding, he was always the first one dancing,\" said Arroyo.\n\nArce was also passionate about table games, particularly dominoes. He and his daughter would spend most of their visits playing with the tiles, the games sometimes stretching on for hours. Sometimes, the \"other grandpas and grandmas would join,\" Arroyo said, because her father had a reputation for being one of the most social residents.\n\nAfter two employees at his nursing home contracted COVID-19 in March, the disease spread through the facility. Two weeks after contracting the illness, he died on July 9 at age 87.\n\n\"He had survived so much -- collapsing twice from diabetes and having to be airlifted to a hospital,\" Arroyo said.\n\n\"The last time I saw him was in February, because then they closed and said we could only see him at the window,\" she said. \"He was just a simple man who liked to play his board games. And who loved his sweets â always.\"\n\nArce is survived by his daughter and two granddaughters, Ariana and Alyssa Arroyo.\n\nThirty years ago, Desanka Mitrovich called her doctor to tell him she wasnât feeling well. He urged her to call a cab and come to his office immediately, but Mitrovich, ever elegant, ever forceful, dolled herself up and waited for the bus. Only after arriving at the doctorâs office across town did she learn she was having a heart attack.\n\nâDesa was formidable,â said her niece, Milica Mitrovich, âand the doctor still tells that story.â\n\nA fighter to the end, Mitrovich died in San Diego on May 23 due to complications of lymphoma and COVID-19. She was 95.\n\nBorn in 1924 in Sveti Stefan, Montenegro (then part of Yugoslavia), Mitrovich was full of fire, grace and wit from the start. As a young woman, she worked as a school teacher in a small mountain village, and later became the mistress of a one-room schoolhouse. She approached her work with a strong sense of duty, and was revered for her firm-but-fair approach to education.\n\nMany of her former students, now adults, still tell stories about how she was a âmean and wonderfulâ teacher, her niece said, noting that she was just as likely to bring cookies as she was to make them wash behind their ears in the nearby stream.\n\nMitrovich fought fervently against the Axisâ occupation of Yugoslavia during World War II, and in 1960, moved to San Diego to begin a new chapter of her life. She attended San Diego State University and was the first member of her family to graduate from college. She went on to enjoy a decades-long career at the universityâs library, where she worked in the acquisitions department until retirement.\n\nâShe was forged in that crucible where women didnât go off and have their own careers,â her niece said. âThe path that she took, being a school teacher and then moving across the world and going to college, required a great deal of backbone.â\n\nAlthough Mitrovich never married (she said the suitors werenât up to her standards), she was a loyal friend who made it her âjob on the weekendsâ to call relatives around the world and check in. She was so devoted to her family that when her niece graduated from law school on the East Coast, Mitrovich spent nearly three days on a Greyhound bus to be there.\n\nâIf she had to hitchhike or to walk, she would have found a way to do it,â Milica said.\n\nIn addition to the friends, relatives and students whose lives she touched, family members said theyâd remember her for her poise, charisma, dark sense of humor and beautiful singing voice.\n\nâShe was an extraordinary woman,â her niece said. âIt was not a conventional life, but it was a life lived as much on her own terms, as much as she possibly could.â\n\nMitrovich is survived by her sister Beba and four nieces and nephews.\n\nMiljenko âMikeâ Gotovac knew a thing or two about Los Angeles. As a bartender at West Hollywoodâs iconic restaurant Dan Tanaâs for more than 50 years, he was the one constant amid an ever-changing sea of actors, rock stars, barflies and dreamers.\n\nUntil his hospitalization on March 16, he remained one of the oldest working bartenders in L.A. He died due to complications of COVID-19 on May 14 at the age of 76.\n\nâMike was a piece of iron in this city,â said Craig Susser, owner of Craigâs restaurant and Gotovacâs longtime friend. âNo matter what happened in your life or what happened in the world, Monday through Friday, he was there.â\n\nGotovac was born in the village of LeÄevica, Croatia, in 1943. As a young man, he joined a wave of Croatians who traveled to Germany to escape the poor economy of what was then Yugoslavia. He landed in L.A. in 1967, where he quickly became part of the cityâs tight-knit Croatian community. He became the bartender and resident curmudgeon at Dan Tanaâs a year later, but despite his position at the center of the star-studded restaurant, his sons said he couldnât tell a movie star from a customer off the street.\n\nâHe liked old cowboy westerns and he enjoyed sports, so what did he care if youâre an actor or actress in the highest grossing movie of the year?â said his son Domagoj. âThat was one of the reasons a lot of these famous people really liked him, because it was really the only time they got treated normal.â\n\nSo many customers relied on Gotovacâs steadfast presence that toward the end of his career, he showed up as much for them as he did for himself, his sons said. It wasnât uncommon for him to bring some of the barâs customers home for the holidays because they had nowhere else to go.\n\nâThere were a lot of lonely people in L.A., and he did have a soft spot,â his son Matija said.\n\nWhen Gotovac wasnât at Dan Tanaâs, he was the consummate family man. He was a parishioner at St. Anthony Croatian Catholic Church, an avid soccer player and longtime president of San Pedro Croat Soccer Club. His idea of a good time was dinner and dancing with his wife, or doting on his granddaughters, Emelia, Iva and Beatrix, who became his greatest joy.\n\nâHe took care of people like nobody else,â said Christian Kneedler, manager of Dan Tanaâs. âHe really was one of a kind.â\n\nRead the full obituary\n\nWell into his 80s, Ralph Duprey could be found biking around his Long Beach neighborhood. Snaking through the streets he had called home for over 70 years on two wheels was calming. It was Duprey's time to collect his thoughts and relax at the end of a long day.\n\nBut biking hadnât always been a peaceful practice for Duprey. As a teenager, he would bike down the Steep Shell Hill in Long Beach.\n\nâI remember him telling me that his bike didnât have very good brakes,â said Dupreyâs son, Mark, âhe would get to the top of the hill and it had a pretty good grade.â\n\nâYes!â chimed in Markâs sister Karen, âHe talked about sticking his foot out and rubbing it against the front tire to slow the bike down. Even at that age, he realized that it wasnât the brightest idea.â\n\nDupreyâs life began far from the hills and sunny shores of Long Beach. He was born in Canada in 1922 to Thomas and Amada Duprey, the sixth of seven children. Early in his life, his parents decided to head west and landed in California, a place Duprey would come to love.\n\nThe family settled in Long Beach and lived in a small three-bedroom house. Duprey ended his days just a few blocks from that house â at St. Maryâs Hospital, Long Beach where he died on April 18 from complications related to Covid-19. He was 98.\n\nDuprey celebrated his birthday just three weeks before his death. While his children were unable to be in the same room due to coronavirus restrictions, they improvised and found a creative way to share their love.\n\nThe three children, Mark, Karen and Arlene stood outside his assisted living facility in front of a big window that faces the street. Karen brought along a chalkboard.\n\nâWe were writing messages and wearing crazy hats,â said Mark, âwe looked like idiots but dad got a big kick out of it, he was laughing and smiling.â\n\nThe separation instigated by coronavirus was particularly difficult for the family, who loved spending time together with their father. âMark and I would split the timeâ said Karen, âbetween us we were usually there six nights a week.â\n\nThey would bring their dad his favorite food ... chocolate. âWe would take him chocolate malts, or Hershey bars.â said Mark, âbut he just really loved any chocolate, and I mean, he loved chocolate.â\n\nNurses at Dupreyâs assisted living facility encouraged the children to bring their father healthier treats, for fear of the almost 100 year old man developing diabetes. But, he was fit and trim until the end.\n\nDupreyâs confidence in his own physical ability was built on years of working in plumbing and construction, skills he began to develop during WWII. After graduating from Long Beach Polytechnic in 1941, Duprey joined the Coast Guard and served as a motor machinist mate during the war.\n\nUpon returning home, he became a union plumber, working on new buildings in and around Long Beach. He was also comfortable with most parts of construction work and put his skills to good use around the family home.\n\nâHe was fixing things like the furnace under the house well into his 80s,â said Karen, âwe practically had to drag him out of there!â\n\nâHe just never moved like an old manâ said Karen, âNo, he was spry and gracefulâ added Arlene.\n\nDupreyâs physical grace was also apparent when he danced. âWe would have parties at the house,â said Karen, âthere was usually dancing, and mom and dad would also go out on dates to go dancing.â\n\nDuprey met his wife, Mary Lee Smith after WWII and the couple married in 1948 and the couple were together until her death in 1987 at the age of 60. âIt was a pretty tough time for about a year,â said Mark, âbut dad came out on the other side.â\n\nThe children knew Duprey was beginning to heal when he got back on his bike. âI remember him riding along Newport Ave. he actually rode the bike half the length of the block backwards,â said Mark, âhe wanted to prove to himself that he could still do it â and he was satisfied.â\n\nRalph Duprey is survived by his three children, eight grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.\n\nEven while suffering from fever and body aches, Ever A. Linares kept working by phone the week before Thanksgiving to connect needy families with turkeys for the holiday.\n\nBy Nov. 30, Linares, a 45-year-old gang intervention worker who quelled violence in different parts of the city for more than a decade, was dead from complications of COVID-19, his wife Andrea said.\n\nThe co-founder of Resilient, a nonprofit organization that works with at-risk and gang-involved youth, Linares was known locally for working to reduce violence. In addition to running his own agency, he worked with the Mayorâs Office of Gang Intervention and Youth Development program to train intervention workers and police officers. He also traveled the nation to train community workers with the Urban Peace Institute, a group that works to reduce street violence.\n\nâIt was his mission to show young people across the city the power of faith, of hope and of love in the face of violence and poverty,â L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti said.\n\nBorn and raised in Los Angelesâ Pico-Union neighborhood, Linares got involved in gangs by the time he was 13, his wife said. When he reached his 20s and had his first daughter, he began transitioning away from gangs and toward church.\n\nâHe mentioned that he wanted something different, a different life for his daughter,â his wife said.\n\nHe became involved in Victory Outreach Ministries and eventually began working with different gang intervention agencies across the city.\n\nâPeople would just gravitate toward him,â said Fernando RejÃ³n, the executive director of the Urban Peace Institute.\n\nThis year, amid the pandemic and a rising homicide rate, Linares kept working to help families. His organization handed out personal protective equipment in the South Park neighborhood where the agency is based and held weekly food drives.\n\nSometimes, his devotion to his work would wear on his wife. One night years ago, Linares was eating dinner with his family when his phone rang. Andrea said she shot him a look, annoyed that their meal was going to be interrupted yet again.\n\nIt was a person in crisis. Linares told him: âDo not make a permanent decision based off a temporary feeling.â Andrea said that encounter helped her better understand her husbandâs work.\n\nâWhat if he didnât pick up the phone call?\" she said. âHe prevented somebody from probably going to jail.â\n\nLinares said her husband was a patient man. If a person needed a job and didnât know how to fill out the application, he would sit and walk them through the process. In addition, he would take the time to tell those he helped what it means to be presentable and what employers want to see.\n\nLike many of the cityâs intervention workers, Linares wanted to contribute to making peace on the streets. Even as a youth leader in church, he connected with others who were in need, recalled longtime friend and co-founder of Resilient, Michael Guedel.\n\nGuedel said he came to see Linares as a mentor over the years.\n\nâHe would always tell me never to be paralyzed by fear but to keep moving,â Guedel said.\n\nLinares is survived by his wife, seven children and one grandchild.\n\nBarbara Johnson Hopper was known for giving friends and family plum jam made with fruit picked from her yard.\n\nHer garden â full of lemons, vegetables, and flowers â offered her a refuge when she was worried and needed to pray to God, said her daughter, Adriane Hopper Williams.\n\nâThatâs what she would always say, âIâve got to go to the Earth,ââ Hopper Williams said. âThat was her way of just getting centered.â\n\nHopper, 81, died of the effects of COVID-19 on March 26 after spending five days in the hospital. Hopper Williams said her family closely follows the news, and she remembered discussing the coronavirus outbreak with her mother, thinking it wouldnât hit as close to home as it did.\n\nâWeâre still, every night, watching this news and sheâs now one of those numbers,â Hopper Williams said.\n\nHopper was funny, gregarious, and âthe ultimate producer,â her daughter said.\n\nâSheâs the one that brought people together and knew how to inspire people toward a purpose,â Hopper Williams said. âShe just knew how to talk to people and to get them back on track to what really matters.â\n\nHopper was born in Milwaukee and studied social work at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. In 1960 she met her husband, Dr. Cornelius Hopper, while he was completing his residency at Milwaukee County Hospital. Cornelius fell in love with Barbara, as well as his future mother-in-lawâs soul food cooking. Barbara and Cornelius wed in 1964.\n\nWhen the family moved to Alabama in 1971 for her husbandâs new position as medical director of the John Andrew Hospital at Tuskegee Institute, Hopper started the Tuskegee Laboratory and Learning Center, an alternative school, as well as a real estate business.\n\nIn 1979 the family moved to the Bay Area and settled in Oakland, where she continued to work as a real estate agent while also founding and participating in community groups, and serving on scholarship boards for medical students. At Church by the Side of the Road, which she attended with her family, she led a yearlong reading of the Bible that ended with a trip to Jerusalem.\n\nShe is survived by her husband of 55 years, Cornelius, her two sons Michael and Brian, her daughter, Adriane, and two grandchildren.\n\nâI know weâre all biased, but for me personally, when I think about a woman of character, integrity, strength, beauty, grace, wisdom, and charity, that is who I think of,â Hopper Williams said. âShe is my role model.â\n\nJennifer Gibbs, 67, said she met Hopper through a mutual friend 13 years ago. Whenever Gibbs was sick, Hopper would bring her chicken soup. When Gibbs drove to Ohio to pack up her 93-year-old mother to move in with her in the Bay Area, Hopper told her sheâd have dinner waiting for them when they arrived.\n\nOne of the bridge groups Hopper organized had a Zoom meeting to share how they felt about her after they learned of her death, Gibbs said. âShe was the one,â Gibbs said, âthat brought us all together and kind of was the glue.â\n\nRonda Felder gave her life to people in need, always doing whatever it took to make room in her home, her heart and her family for anyone who was hurting, lost or abandoned.\n\nA social worker for the County of San Diego, Felder died Aug. 3 at Kaiser Permanente San Diego Medical Center, where she had been battling COVID-19 for a month. She was 60.\n\nOne of Felderâs two daughters, Treasure Felder, said her mother leaves behind a legacy of love and service, something she showed not just to her own daughters, Treasure Felder and Chomedy Curry but to the dozens of foster children she helped raise, her church family at New Creation Church of San Diego, her relatives, the children she watched over as a social worker and anyone else in need.\n\nâShe was all about her family, those related to her by blood and those related to her by love,â said Treasure.\n\nWhen Treasure was in middle school, her mom would take in her classmates and friends âwhose moms werenât doing OK,â sharing with them her familyâs modest home and resources.\n\nâEven though we didnât have a lot she always made space,â Treasure said. âSometimes we were all sleeping on top of each other, but we had a home.â\n\nFelder was constantly on the move, always working to improve life for others, never slowing down, rarely getting exhausted, almost never getting sick, Treasure said. As a single mother, she worked full time after the family moved from New York to San Diego in 1998. She began pursuing a college education in 2003, graduating from San Diego State University with a degree in social work.\n\nRonda Felder graduated from San Diego State University in 2009 with a bachelorâs degree in social work.\n\nâSheâd go to work at 5 a.m., work eight hours, come home, make sure we had what we needed and then she would go to school,â Treasure said. âSheâd come home late and do it all over again, every day for years.â\n\nOnce Ronda Felder graduated from college at the age of 50, she did not slow down, Treasure said. She got a job as a social worker for the county, and worked tirelessly for the children on her list, even after the pandemic descended on California. First she visited them on video chat services, then, when the county directed social workers to resume visiting children, in person.\n\nTreasure said her mother felt her work was a calling, and she answered the call even though she knew she was putting her life in danger with every in-person visit amid the pandemic.\n\nâShe knew the risk, but in many ways, she thought she was protected by God because she was doing Godâs work,â Treasure said.\n\nShe is survived by her mother, sister, children and grandchildren.\n\nGeorge Chiu was a craftsman with an eye for detail and a passion for problem solving. He carried both traits with him throughout his life.\n\nChiu, a San Francisco Bay Area native with a bachelorâs degree in chemical engineering from San Jose State, began his career at Fairchild Semiconductor. In 1968 he followed Fairchild colleagues Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore to a start-up the two had founded in the semiconductor chip industry.\n\nThe 39th employee at Intel Corp., Chiu spent most of his career designing and assembling âpackagingâ that would seal off semiconductor chips from moisture and other contaminants while still allowing the transmission of electronic signals.\n\nâHe was always a real hands-on engineer,â said his daughter Jenny Sears. âThey just had to be inventive back then â there was no class in semiconductor chip packaging. Theyâd be testing materials all the time. People would say, âWell, your dad knew more about materials than some people with doctorates.ââ\n\nIn a company publication celebrating Intelâs 25th anniversary, Chiu reflected on his career: âI was the first engineer doing package development at Intel. Iâm still doing basically the same thing and I love it,â he said. âI can hold a product in my hand and see my contribution to it; my identityâs in that package. I was supposed to retire almost 10 years ago, but when thereâs so much going on here, who wants to retire?â\n\nIn the 1990s Chiu also worked on a technology, widely used today, known as âC4â processing that enabled chips to simultaneously make hundreds, and eventually thousands, of electrical connections.\n\nCraig Noke, a former carpool mate and jogging partner, said Chiu loved to solve problems.\n\nâThat was his life,â Noke said. âYou had some problem at work, and try and find out what the solution is â that was his satisfaction.â\n\nChiu had an eye for handiwork as well. When he had his house remodeled, he came home every day and inspected the work, asking the contractor to straighten something out â1/16th of an inchâ even if functionally it was perfect, said Noke, who used the same contractor.\n\nChiu had a lighter side, too. Colleagues and his daughter recalled his penchant for rock concerts at the Fillmore in the 1960s, where he would stand next to speakers to immerse himself in the music â a habit that may have contributed to his severe hearing loss.\n\nâHe was like this old hippie,â Sears said.\n\nChiu had a plethora of hobbies â travel, photography, jewelry making, collecting tools. He liked cars, buying a Porsche Boxster after he retired.\n\nMost of all, though, he loved to eat â Chinese food, especially.\n\nPaul Engel, a colleague and best friend of 40 years, spent months with Chiu in Penang, Malaysia, where Intel had package assembly plants. The two would go on culinary adventures, often seeking out char quay teow, a Chinese noodle-and-seafood dish.\n\nâWe couldnât get enough of that,â Engel said.\n\nEngel later left the company but continued to meet Chiu every week for years.\n\nâWeâd go to lunch and eat like pigs â and heâd go home that evening and right away ask, âWhatâs for dinner, Florence?ââ Engel said, referring to Chiuâs wife, who died in 2011.\n\nWhen Chiu died, friends joked that he went to heaven, found Florence and immediately asked, âWhatâs for dinner?â\n\nLate in life, Chiu developed Alzheimerâs disease. He continued to live alone at his Palo Alto home, assisted by round-the-clock caregivers. By late last year much of his memory was failing, but Engel said âhe could still talk about Penang and the food there.â\n\nItâs not clear how Chiu contracted COVID-19, but his daughter said it could have been from a recent hospital stay or possibly from one of his caregivers, although they were extremely careful. He died Dec. 31.\n\nIf you were fortunate enough to meet Ronald Harris in the late 1970s, you likely had to answer two questions: What would you like to drink, and where you would like to go?\n\nThe larger-than-life luxury travel agent, renowned as much for his charisma as for his eye-popping global excursions, died Aug. 5 from complications of COVID-19. He was 82.\n\nHarris was born in Los Angeles in 1938. His mother was an aspiring vaudeville singer, and his father a pioneer of the tourism industry who traveled on steamships. Harris had a happy childhood of surfing, skiing and outdoor adventures, and he graduated from Loyola High School.\n\nAfter his father died, Harris took over the family business and eventually went on to co-found Hemphill Harris Travel, a premiere travel agency. His passion, his family said, was Travel with a capital âT.â\n\nTo him, there was no limit between cultures and countries,â said his son-in-law, Daniel Franco. âThere were no boundaries. Anything was possible.â\n\nHarrisâs custom tours â fantasias of elephants and exotic dancers, flashy sports cars and French river boats, African trains and jumbo jets reimagined as flying piano bars â were enough to garner a 1986 write-up in the Los Angeles Times, which dubbed them a âfirst-class spectacleâ designed for âthe rich and the restless.â A single ticket could cost upwards of $23,000.\n\nThe trips were incredible feats of resourcefulness in a pre-Internet era, his children said, and were often only feasible because Harris himself had done them first.\n\nâHe was definitely a visionary,â said his daughter Marissa. âHe had this drive to make things different, fun and exciting.â\n\nAnd although the agency commanded much of Harrisâs energy, he also made time for his family. He enjoyed taking his children camping (or âglamping,â Marissa said) and pushed them to try new foods and experiences. He also encouraged them to take an interest in the travel business.\n\nâI felt so fortunate that he exposed me to different things,â said his son, Marc, who worked with his father for several years. âTo go to Africa on safari when I was 10 years old was just mind blowing.â\n\nA longtime member of the Travelerâs Century Club â a club for people who have been to at least 100 countries â Harris also kept a baby crocodile and a pet piranha in his office that were meant to encourage visitors to âdream more,â his children said.\n\nâHe would always say, âIf the why is important enough, youâll figure out the how,ââ Franco said. âHis âwhyâ was to make it incredible. He wanted to outdo what anyone else had experienced in the world.â\n\nAnd although Hemphill Harris folded after a disastrous sale to Weststar, Inc., in 1989, it wasnât enough to dampen Harrisâs spirit. He went on to found another travel agency with his second wife, Sylvia, and also made time for two of his other passions: fishing and golf.\n\nHarris maintained his sharp mind and sense of adventure to the end. Once, his son-in-law remarked that he was like those explorers who had flown around the world in a hot air balloon.\n\nâYes,â Harris replied, âbut thatâs way too slow.â\n\nRonald Harris is survived by his wife Sylvia, children Marc and Marrisa, and brothers Tim and Tony. He was previously married to Lily Harris.\n\nIn 1980, Sister Paulita Bernuy posed a question to a group of eight nuns who had just moved into the convent at Holy Name Parish in South-Central Los Angeles.\n\nAs part of her ministryâs work with refugees from El Salvador, Bernuy encountered a young mother, her two young daughters and her paraplegic husband all living together in a garage.\n\nBernuy asked if the sisters would consider having the family live with them at the convent until they could find a home of their own.\n\nâIt wasnât easy, but we came to the decision that we would give it a try,â Sister Rochelle Mitchell recalled. âThus began two years of having our hearts stretched and sometimes broken, our schedules routinely interrupted, the greatest joy in watching the girls grow and the incredible pain as dad headed deep into a world of depression.â\n\nThe family eventually found a home in Echo Park, but their connection to Bernuy and the other sisters persisted. When Bernuy died from COVID-19 on Nov. 24 at age 91, the two daughters were pallbearers at her funeral.\n\nBernuyâs remarkable life unfolded as a series of chapters, said Sister Patricia McGowan.\n\nâShe did one thing for a while, and when it was appropriate she moved on to another chapter,â she said.\n\nBorn Jan. 20, 1929 into a large French Canadian family in Quebec, Bernuy was 21 when she joined the Sisters of Social Service, an order of religious women committed to helping those on the margins of society and changing the societal structures that push people to those margins.\n\nIn her early years as a nun, Bernuy served in several parishes on the West Coast and took on leadership roles within Sisters of Social Service. She received a masterâs degree in social work from San Diego State University in 1974 and worked for several years as a therapist at Holy Family parish in Glendale.\n\nAs an activist, Bernuy and four other nuns were handcuffed and arrested in 1981 after blocking the driveway to the Federal Building in downtown L.A in protest of the deportation of Salvadoran refugees.\n\nâTheyâre sending these people to their death and weâre willing to put our bodies on the line,â she told the Los Angeles Herald Examiner at the time. âIt means that much to us.â\n\nIn the last years of her active service, Bernuy switched her focus again, this time working as a doula working with infant children in Seattle, which gave her great delight.\n\nâAs a leader of our community and as an activist, she did have a kind of stern countenance, but that just melted away when she did her final act of ministry,â said Sister Maribeth Larkin, general director of the Sisters of Social Service.\n\nBernuy was living in Encino at a home the Sisters of Social Service operate for their aging members when she contracted the virus.\n\nWhen Elishia and Bobby Breed were walking home from summer school one day, their mother surprised the two by pulling up in her car and asking, âHow would you guys like to go to Magic Mountain?â\n\nPatti Breed-Rabitoy had left work early to be with her children.\n\nâThat was the kind of person she was,â Elishia Breed said with a laugh. âShe was really trying to spend quality time with us.â\n\nBreed-Rabitoy, who had lived in Reseda since 1982, died of COVID-19 complications on May 10. She was 69.\n\nA lifelong Southern California resident, Breed-Rabitoy worked 36 years as a human resources manager at UCLAâs administrative information system department. When her health declined, her children encouraged her to retire.\n\nâIt literally took 3 people to fill her position when she retired,â Breed said. âEverybody relied on Patti.â\n\nBreed-Rabitoy made some of her best friends at work. She, Mabel Lai and Dolores Cook would occasionally eat at the now-closed Normâs in Westwood and chat for hours. After they all retired, the trio continued to meet a few times a year. Cook died in 2010.\n\nâI miss those times,â Lai said. âNow that Patti is gone, Iâm all by myself.â\n\nLai, who is from Hong Kong, said the two became friends after Breed-Rabitoy offered to help with her writing because English isnât Laiâs first language.\n\nâShe had a heart for everyone,â Lai said.\n\nBreed-Rabitoy loved nature and spent years as a troop mom for both the Boy and Girl Scouts. She and her husband Dan loved taking road trips to Oregon and Las Vegas. They also loved The Eagles.\n\nâIf she was a part of something, you just knew it was going to be fun and joyous and just full of love,â Breed said. âAnd thatâs what weâre missing right now.â\n\nBreed-Rabitoy suffered from various ailments, including renal disease. She first experienced coronavirus-related symptoms on April 27 when she came down with a high fever after her thrice-a-week dialysis treatment. She was immediately hospitalized and tested positive for COVID-19 the following day at Northridge Hospital Medical Center. She was then transferred to UCLA Medical Center, where her family decided to take her off a ventilator on Motherâs Day.\n\nâWe knew she was so sick and so fragile, but every time she went into the hospital, she would always come home,â Breed said. âAnd this time, she didn't.â\n\nBreed-Rabitoy is survived by her husband Dan Rabitoy, children Bobby Breed, Elishia Breed and Keith Rabitoy, along with 11 grandchildren and five siblings.\n\nâNothing mattered more to Patti than showing love,â Elishia said Dan told her after her motherâs death. âI feel like I was married to and living with a real life angel for 32 years.â\n\nThere werenât many things Mark Appelbaum wasnât good at.\n\nAs a kid growing up in Canton, Ohio, he conducted experiments in a lab he built in the basement of his parentsâ home. In college he fell in love with another kind of science, earning a doctorate in quantitative psychology and going on to edit two respected psychology journals.\n\nAs an academic, he participated in numerous groundbreaking studies and continued to contribute to the educational mission at UC San Diego long after he retired from the faculty in 2011. And away from the classroom he loved to cook and took up acting.\n\nâSome people can be remarkably single-minded and discipline-specific,â said Steven Adler, professor emeritus,\n\nin the department of theatre and dance at UCSD. âMark wasnât. He cast his net much farther afield both on campus as well as off-campus.â\n\nBut being a renaissance man doesnât always make you popular in your own home.\n\nâWhen I was a teenager, having a father who was a statistician wasnât nearly as cool as having a father who was a businessman or an NBA player,â said Greg, the eldest of Appelbaumâs two sons. âAs I grew up, I realized just how fortunate I was.â\n\nGreg now has an uncool job of his own as an associate professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke. He will soon be following his fatherâs footsteps to UCSD as well.\n\nâHe almost never expressed regrets,â Greg said of his father, who died Dec. 21, two days after being hospitalized because of COVID-19. âHe was both an optimistic person and also, I think, he did what he wanted to and made a lot of right decisions.\"\n\nAppelbaumâs 79 years of life were more than rich in other ways.\n\nAs a child he was fascinated with chemistry, mixing dangerous chemicals in his tiny lab and sometimes pouring them into his brotherâs hands to see what would happen. At Carnegie Mellon, he switched to psychology, a career track that led him to teaching positions â and faculty leadership roles â at North Carolina, Vanderbilt and UCSD.\n\nHis research focused on quantitative and data analytic methods and their applications to human development, which led to a wide array of studies involving non-maternal child care, health and human behavior, HIV transmission in at-risk populations, and educational policies and outcomes. He was also a member of the SAT Committee of the College Board and worked on the Head Start program.\n\nFrom a laypersonâs perspective, he was perhaps best known for chairing a task force that sought to determine the link between violent video games and aggression in children. There was a link, the 2015 study found, but the evidence was insufficient to show it led to criminal violence or delinquency.\n\nRetirement gave Appelbaum a chance to explore other interests â and they were plentiful as well. He joined the board of the La Jolla Symphony and Chorus, refined his skills as a chef and, at age 70, started acting.\n\nâThe\n\nacting came out of left field,â his son said. âHe just wanted to do it. And he\n\nwouldnât let any of his family see him.â\n\nThatâs too bad, because Appelbaum was very talented, said Ilene Hubbs, who directed him in several productions, including a demanding two-person play. With a warm, welcoming face frequently creased by a smile,\n\nshort, trim eyebrows and bald pate framed by a shock of white hair, he could\n\nplay a range of roles â and Hubbs cast him in many.\n\nâHe was a very good actor. Thatâs why I kept casting him,â she said âHe was a brilliant man. Very confident. I think he could have done anything he set his mind to.\n\nâActing gave him a chance to be a really different kind of a guy. And he got into it.â\n\nMaybe that was the point. Mark Appelbaum the academic was a humble man of unparalleled accomplishment, one trailed by a long line of awards, successes, friendships and changed lives. But Mark Appelbaum the actor was free to try out roles he didnât get to play in everyday life.\n\nIn the classroom, Appelbaum would have called it releasing the psychology of expectations. In the theater, he just called it fun.\n\nâHe had a light, humorous side,â Adler said. âHe loved a good story. He loved telling a good story and hearing a good story.â\n\nAppelbaum is survived by his wife, Suzanne, sons Greg and Jonathan, two grandchildren and two brothers, Frederick and Jeffrey.\n\nIt was close to midnight when Danielle Enriquez got a call from her grandmother, Rose Cadena Lord.\n\nâDanielle, what size shoes do you wear?â Danielle recalled her asking.\n\nLord had been watching QVC, the TV shopping channel, and saw a pair of boots she wanted to buy Danielle. It was her favorite TV channel and she loved its advertised lotions and jewelry, but that night, it was just another opportunity to care for her family.\n\nâShe would spend her last dime on her family. If you needed help, you just had to tell her,â said Enriquez.\n\nOn March 31, Lordâs family found out she had tested positive for coronavirus, part of a cluster of cases at Cedar Mountain Post Acute Care in Yucaipa, where the 83-year-old lived. She developed a lung infection and the sodium level in her blood began to spike. By April 11, she was hospitalized and unconscious, though her breathing was strong enough that a respirator was not needed.\n\nOn the afternoon of April 15, Lordâs family saw her for the last time, on a video call. One by one, they said goodbye and told her they loved her.\n\nNot a half hour after they hung up, Lord died, almost as if sheâd been waiting.\n\nLordâs life revolved around her three sons, Ernie, Jimmy and Gilbert Enriquez. After a divorce, she began working at a local boat motor factory to support them. Ernie went to work with her when he was 15.\n\nâI was amazed at her work ethic,â he said. When the factory closed, she became a caregiver and worked another decade until retirement.\n\nLord was strong-willed and meticulous. She kept things spotlessly clean and loved to decorate her home with handmade bouquets. Her opinions were especially strong on matters of style. If she didnât like your shirt, or shoes or makeup, sheâd tell you.\n\nâYou know, you donât look good in that. I wouldnât wear it,â Ernie recalled her saying.\n\nLater in life, Lord developed dementia. Her family cared for her, with Danielle acting as her main caregiver, but when it became too difficult, she moved into Cedar Mountain.\n\nEven as her health deteriorated, Lord remained a big personality. She made fast friends with her roommate and several staff members. She hated the food in the care facility, so Ernie and Danielle regularly delivered some of her favorite foods: fast food tacos, sopita, pan dulce, tamales. Sheâd dig into her meal with a grin and a throaty alto laugh, joy evident in her face.\n\nLord is survived by her sons; eight grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.\n\nCarlos Oropeza Canez was 22 years into a 30 year prison sentence when COVID-19 began to spread through his correctional facility.\n\nBy June 2020, more than 900 people at Avenal State Prison were infected with the deadly virus. Canez phoned his sister-in-law, Sandra, to tell her heâd been written up for refusing an assignment in the prisonâs kitchen. It was, he told her, where many people were getting sick.\n\nâThen he called back and said, âI prayed last night, and I told God that if itâs meant for me, then itâs meant for me,â Sandra said. âAnd he went to work in the kitchen.â\n\nOn June 20, Canez became the first inmate at Avenal to die from complications of COVID-19. He was 60.\n\nCanez was born in Bakersfield in 1959, the youngest of 11 children. His father died when he was just an infant, and for many years, his family lived below the poverty line. Canez was full of charm and charisma; a bright and curious child who would grow into a smooth-talking Cassanova with confidence and style. He loved baseball, Soul Train and disco dancing, and in 1977, he was voted âBest Dressedâ senior at Arvin High School.\n\nâHe had such a beautiful smile, and he was good looking,â said Sandra, who married into the family when Carlos was in fourth grade. âHe was a kind guy, and he could talk to anybody. My husband used to call him âsilver-tongue.ââ\n\nBut life in his Lamont neighborhood outside Bakersfield was full of temptation. While working as a janitor, Canez got involved with the local drug scene and began using heroin. It was an addiction that would plague him for much of his life, even as he fell in love, got married and became a father.\n\nIn 1998, Canez made a decision that would change his life and the lives of others. High on drugs, he got behind the wheel of a car and got into an accident that killed two people: Ruben Pinon, a passenger in his car, and Virginia Adams, a passenger in another. Canez was convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to back-to-back 15-year sentences.\n\nâHe made some bad choices,â said his son, Xavier.\n\nIt took Canez a long time to process what had happened. For years, he was full of anger and frustration, and the family didnât have the resources to pursue an appeal.\n\nMore than a decade into his sentence, Canez apologized to the victimsâ families, his sister-in-law said.\n\nWhile in prison, Canez reconnected with Angie Jimenez, a childhood flame who visited him regularly, and they married in 2011. He checked in with his children weekly, and in the year before his death, he made it a point to reconnect with many of his siblings.\n\nHe also began studying psychology and mentoring younger inmates in need of guidance.\n\nâHe said, âI take them aside, I talk to them,â â Sandra recalled, noting that Canez had plans to become a counselor upon his release.\n\nLast year, Canez graduated from the Avenal education program. It was one of the proudest moments of his life, Sandra said.\n\nToday, Canezâs family doesnât sugar-coat what happened, but they also recognize the demons he battled, the goodness he had within him and the lessons his life provided.\n\nâHis decisions in his life have given me the ability to have an open heart and open mind, and to see people for who they are versus what theyâve done,â said his son, Carlos Jr.\n\nXavier said he thought about his father when he taught his own son to play baseball. Sandra said sheâll never forget how her brother-in-law used to fill the house with music and dance. Jimenez said she will miss her best friend whose smile could âlight up a dim room.â\n\nBut it was Carlos Jr. who seemed most openly moved by his fatherâs story.\n\nâA strength I took from him was never judging anyone,â he said. âLove people for who they are, and forgive people.â\n\nCarlos Canez is survived by his wife Angie; children Xavier, Carlos Jr., Samantha, Emanuel and Adriana; grandchildren Gabrielle, Xander and Grace and siblings Connie, Jane and Raymond.\n\nBirthdays and Christmas were special to Emma PatiÃ±o, who would craft handmade blankets and pillows for her many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She'd add superheroes or cartoon characters or other interests from their lives.\n\nOne year, Emma made her grandson Jaime PatiÃ±o an Elvis Presley blanket â both of them were fans.\n\nâShe didn't have much money, but she had time and she knew how to sew,â he said. âThose meant more than any gifts you could buy at a store because they were made by her. She took the time because she cared.â\n\nEmma, 84, died of complications from COVID-19 on April 13 at Kaiser Permanente in San Leandro. Sheâs survived by her three children, five grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.\n\nThe daughter of a sheepherder, Emma grew up in a large, close knit family in Del Rio, Texas. When she was 20, she married Ricardo PatiÃ±o, who grew up in the same town.\n\nEmma worked different jobs in Del Rio, and her husband took up seasonal work in the East Bay at the old Huntâs fruit packing cannery. When the cannery offered Ricardo a full-time job, Emma agreed to relocate their family of five to Union City in 1960.\n\nâShe said, âYes, weâre poor here in Del Rio, at least weâll have a chance over there,ââ said Jaime PatiÃ±o, a city councilmember in Union City. Though neither Emma nor Ricardo finished high school, they watched the next generations graduate college and earn advanced degrees. The couple divorced years before Ricardo's death in 2004, but remained on good terms, Jaime said.\n\nEmma was a soft-spoken woman who enjoyed visits from her loved ones â when she'd insist they sit and eat something even if they werenât hungry â and her 'novelas. âWeâd be talking on the phone: âOh, oh, I gotta go, my showâs coming on,'â said Jaime.\n\nIn October 2018, Emma moved into the Gateway Care and Rehabilitation Center in Hayward. She had been diagnosed with dementia, but still remembered her relatives and details about her family, and she seemed to be happy there, Jaime said.\n\nFive days before she died, Jaime went to see his grandmother after receiving a news alert that there was a COVID-19 outbreak at the facility. They communicated silently through the window of her room; Emma waved at him to come inside, unaware of the halt on visits. A few hours later he went to see her again through the window, this time with his daughter.\n\nâJust within two or three hours, she started having a cough,â he said. She became the 10th resident of the Gateway Center to die of complications from the coronavirus, in an outbreak that killed at least 18 others.\n\nShe died less than two weeks before what would have been her 85th birthday. To celebrate her birthday last year, the family took her out to lunch at a Mexican restaurant in Fremont. It was the last time the entire family was able to gather around to see her. In one of the pictures from that day, sheâs surrounded by her great-grandchildren.\n\nâShe loved that,â Jaime said. âAnd for her to pass away just shy of a year later, when she was so full of life, even the last time I got to see her, she got up out of bed and walked over to the window so I could say hi to her. Itâs just weird â five days later she passed away.â\n\nThey met at the Silhouette Club in Oakland in 1954. Costell Akrie was 23 and stationed at the Air Force base in nearby Pleasanton. Dianne Swanigan was 19 and an EKG technician at a local hospital.\n\nOn a break from his gig as a stand-up bass player with the jazz band performing that night, Akrie went to Dianneâs table and asked for a cigarette, even though he didnât smoke. They chatted. He got her phone number.\n\nâWhen I got home from the dance, I woke my parents up and said, âI have met the man Iâm going to marry.â I just knew it,â Dianne said. âTwo weeks later he proposed, and I accepted. We were married a year later.â\n\nCostell and Dianne Akrie would have celebrated their 65th anniversary on May 1 if Akrie had not died from complications of COVID-19 at the Gateway Care & Rehabilitation Center in Hayward on April 4. He was 88.\n\nâHe was the best person I ever met, and Iâm not exaggerating,â Dianne said. âHe was a wonderful father, a devoted husband. He made friends with anybody. He did so many things for so many people and never talked about it.â\n\nCostell Akrie was born in Pittsburgh in 1931 and lived in an orphanage from age 9 to 16. He moved in with a sister and worked his way through high school as a busboy.\n\nHe entered the Air Force and was stationed in Korea before returning to the U.S. After marrying Dianne in 1955, Akrie earned a bachelorâs degree in political science and a masterâs degree in public administration from Cal State Hayward.\n\nHe worked three jobs â musician, package deliveryman and Lever soap company salesman â while supporting his wife and two kids.\n\nAkrie went on to become chief of veterans affairs for the Bay Area Urban League, procuring millions of dollars in grants for veterans looking to reenter the workforce, and one of the first African American managers for United Airlines, running maintenance bays at the Oakland and San Francisco airports.\n\nWhile his jobs varied, one constant was Akrieâs devotion to community service. He spearheaded fundraisers to purchase the land and playground equipment for Tassafaronga Park in East Oakland in 1964.\n\nHe helped start a program called Bikes Unlimited, which lent bicycles to children who couldnât afford them. He was an active participant in city council meetings.\n\nâPeople used to call him âSt. Costellâ because he was so kind and compassionate,â said Scott Akrie, his son. âHe was the least pretentious man you could meet. He didnât care who you were, what you did, if you were seeking advice or help to better yourself, his door was open to you.â\n\nAkrie retired in 1996. He loved to read and was an avid chess player, collecting more than 50 chess sets from around the world. He designed and built the coupleâs retirement home in Rumsey, north of Sacramento.\n\nHe was hospitalized twice, once in February and again in early March, for problems related to his diabetes medication. He was sent to Gateway for physical rehabilitation on March 5 and diagnosed with a low-grade fever on March 28.\n\nHe tested positive for the coronavirus on March 31 and died four days later, one of at least 13 patients who have died at the facility from COVID-19.\n\nIn addition to his wife and son, Akrie is survived by a daughter, Dawn Edwards, four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. With Gateway on lockdown, family members could not visit Akrie in his final days.\n\nâAll he wanted was to get home and have a cup of my coffee,â Dianne said. âItâs hard when you canât see your loved one and you know theyâre going to die.â\n\nWith no children of his own, Tommy Macias spent most weekends with his two sisters and their children.\n\nThe big rig driver had a âbig, booming laughâ that brought a smile to those around him, said his 28-year-old niece, Danielle Lopez. For her entire life, she was the butt of jokes Macias would make, and the constant teasing had left a soft spot in her heart for her uncle, who showed his love through laughter.\n\nAn average weekend for Macias included barbecuing or cruising in a boat on Lake Elsinore with his mother, sisters and nieces.\n\nIt was at a barbecue with friends that he contracted the coronavirus, apparently from a guest who had tested positive for COVID-19 but was asymptomatic. Macias died June 21 of complications from the virus. He was 51.\n\nLopez said that a day on Lake Elsinore with her uncle was âone of the best days everâ â even though she didnât share his love of the water. She felt at peace, a feeling she often experienced in her uncleâs presence.\n\nGustavo Lopez, Danielleâs father and Maciasâ brother-in-law, cherished the relationship Macias had with Lopezâs daughters.\n\nâHe was there for every holiday, and he actually checked in with his extended family on a weekly basis,â Lopez said. âIn these last couple of days, many family members have reached out to make sure he was taken care of, because he would have done the same for them.â\n\nAnd this year, Lopez and his family were excited to move from Mission Viejo to Lake Elsinore and Wildomar to be closer to Macias. They had already made plans for him to help unpack their moving boxes.\n\nMaciasâ 53-year-old sister, Norma Macias Norris, was heartbroken that her brother would not be around to see their family come together a year after their father passed away.\n\nMacias Norris, who lived five minutes away from her brother, often ran into him around town, and âeverywhere he went, he would make friends.â Even from an early age he would strive to make people laugh and never wanted to make anyone angry.\n\nThis held true to the very end.\n\nA day before his death, Macias posted a warning on Facebook, urging people to wear a mask and practice social distancing. His final message was one of regret.\n\nâMy brother didnât blame anybody, he took full responsibility,â Macias Norris said. âI know my brother, and in the end all he wanted to do was take care of his family.â\n\nIn addition to Macias Norris, Macias is survived by his mother, Hilda Martinez; another sister, Veronica Lopez; and four nieces.\n\nRead the full obituary\n\nMichael Cook spent much of his life studying to deepen his knowledge of Christ.\n\nAfter being ordained as a priest in 1966, he continued his theological studies, focusing on Christology, a topic he wrote about extensively in several books, including âChristology as Narrative Questâ and âResponses to 101 Questions About Jesus.â\n\nâHe spoke in paragraphs if not volumes,â his niece, Colleen Cook, said with a laugh. âAn intellect on another level.â\n\nA longtime professor of religious studies at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Wash., Cook spent the final years of his life at Sacred Heart Jesuit Center in Los Gatos, Calif., where he contracted coronavirus and died of complications of COVID-19 on Dec. 17.\n\nHe was 84.\n\nSeveral other priests at the center also died of COVID-19 around the same time.\n\nBorn in Wolf Point, Mont., Cook and his family relocated to Seattle when he was around 5, but he and his older brother â Colleenâs father â briefly returned to Montana at the start of World War II, motivated by fears that the naval base near the familyâs home in Seattle could be bombed.\n\nHe attended a Jesuit-run high school in Seattle and sometimes helped out at a string of foundering ice cream parlors and doughnut shops that his father had purchased in the area. Years later, Colleen recalled, her uncle â \"Mike\" to everyone in the family â entertained her with a story about how he spent long hours scooping ice cream while her father was out chasing girls. Colleenâs father, however, recalled it differently: While he scooped ice cream, his brother was holed up somewhere with his nose in a book reciting prayers.\n\nCook entered the Jesuit novitiate at 17 and continued to study throughout his life, including a few years in Rome, as well as earning a doctorate from the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley. He spoke seven languages, his niece said, including Greek, Latin, Spanish, Italian and German, and he did teaching stints at Catholic University of Chile in Santiago and Hekima College in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nDespite his intellectual zeal for theology, Cook's faith was also deeply personal, his niece said, recalling that when he spoke about God, he used the term âabba,â a term for \"father\" in Aramaic.\n\nâIt was like that personal relationship,â she said, âof a child calling Dad 'Papa'.â\n\nAfter Colleenâs daughter, Claire Bartlett, was born, Cook baptized her at Lake Goodwin outside Seattle. And every year, on the anniversary of the baptism, Bartlett recalled, her great uncle, who was also her godfather, sent her a card commemorating the important day.\n\nHe was also well known, Colleen said, for his detailed Christmas letters. The most recent note, which arrived a few days before he died, she said, focused on the strength of women told through the story of Mary.\n\nJoyce Marie Pierce Johnson had one of the meanest Mardi Gras spreads in Houma, La. Fried turkey, Cajun dirty rice, gumbo, Johnsonâs special potato salad; itâs the place people wanted to be.\n\nâWhen she was there, the party was on,â said her daughter, Monique Washington.\n\nBut this year, for the first time her children can remember, she missed Mardi Gras. Instead of being at home in Houma, Johnson was in Atlanta, nursing Washington back to health from a double mastectomy.\n\nEven at 71, Johnson was a force to be reckoned with, lifting her daughterâs full weight to help her around the house or to use the restroom. âThat kind of strength,â said Washington.\n\nItâs why, two months later, it was so jarring to hear her voice over the phone from the hospital. Gone was the âstrong, joyfulâ voice that was the center of every party; in its place, âa whisper.â\n\nâShe cared for me, and all of us [children],â said Washington. âWe could not be there one second to help take care of her.â\n\nIn late March, Johnson and her 10-year-old granddaughter were on vacation visiting her son and his family in Hemet when she began to have diarrhea and nausea. She went to the doctor and tested positive for COVID-19, and then on April 1, as her condition worsened, was admitted to a hospital.\n\nEven from her hospital bed, Johnson was confident she would recover. She called her granddaughter, who had flown back to Louisiana, on April 4. Her voice was weak, but she was convinced the hospital wouldnât hold her long.\n\nâHer last words to us were that she loved us and that she couldnât wait to come see us,â said Kristie Johnson, the girlâs mother and Johnsonâs daughter.\n\nOn April 15, Johnson died of COVID-19.\n\nA year earlier, Johnson had retired after 25 years as a grocery store cashier. Her daughters say everybody knew her, that she would make peopleâs day with her banter.\n\nJohnson dedicated her retirement to making sure her children were taken care of, whether it was nursing through recovery from a surgery, helping with a home purchase or just paying a visit.\n\nWashington said Johnson was the person people would go to for confidence or inspiration. In the middle of Washingtonâs battle with breast cancer, Johnson spray-painted her hair pink to show support. She taught her children to stick together and to be honest.\n\nâShe made me the woman I am,â said Washington. âThe ugly truth and the sweet truth. Whatever it was, she told it.â\n\nJohnson is survived by her children, Monique Washington, Trisha Brownlee, Kristie Johnson, Terrence Johnson and Frank Johnson Jr.; stepchildren Gregory Wallace and Ivy Wallace; 31 grandchildren; 17 great-grandchildren; and several nieces and nephews. Her son Corey Johnson died in 2010.\n\nThe first time someone met Bishop Anthony Pigee Sr., they might notice his âever-glowingâ smile or his laugh âlike a lion in the jungle.â Maybe heâd pay for their meal or fill up their gas tank. But if they asked him what he did for a living, said his son and successor Elder Anthony Pigee Jr., all heâd say was that he was âin the business of changing lives.â\n\nBishop Pigee was a powerful preacher who traveled around the United States and the world to preach, but who also went out of his way to care for his community and the Life of Faith Community Center, the nondenominational church he founded in Long Beach 15 years ago.\n\nâIf you needed it, he had it. If you didnât need it, heâd give it. He just wanted to be a blessing,â said his wife, LaVicia Pigee.\n\nPigee was so well known in the community that when LaVicia called a friend to tell him of her husbandâs passing, the friend already knew: Someone at the corner convenience store Pigee frequented had heard it and shared it with the group that hung out outside.\n\nIt may have been Pigeeâs care for those around him that led to his contracting the coronavirus in late March. With stay-at-home orders about to go into effect, Pigee was driving around town stocking up on staples. âHe was the epitome of a provider,â said Anthony Jr.\n\nOn March 28, with Pigeeâs breathing becoming more and more labored, LaVicia drove him to Kaiser in West LA. He tested positive for COVID-19, and doctors told him that the breathing problems heâd had for three months werenât from allergies after all. They were from pneumonia. Eleven days later, on April 8, Pigee died. He was 49.\n\nHis family and friends remember a man who, when he wasnât preaching from the pulpit, was constantly cracking jokes. He had a deep, joyful belly laugh and a beaming smile that could turn a bad day to a good one in a moment, said longtime friend Bishop Sherman Gordon of Family of Faith Christian Center in Long Beach.\n\nPigee loved to embarrass LaVicia with compliments. Once when they were out to dinner, he explained to the waiter that the couple was on a date, then suddenly burst into a song about how beautiful she was, made up on the spot.\n\nPigee had a few different catchphrases that heâd return to from time to time. These days, one stands out:\n\nâThe best time you have is the time you have.â\n\nIn addition to his wife and son Anthony Jr., Pigee is survived by another son, Darius; daughters Sandrika, Adrina, Camran, Laniya and Lanicia; daughter-in-law Tineisha Pigee and sons-in-law Albert Parish and Anthony Arzu.\n\nAn earlier version of this obituary contained errors. It described the Life of Faith Community Center as affiliated with the Church of God in Christ; it is nondenominational. It also said Pigee had founded the church in South Los Angeles a decade ago; it was founded in Long Beach 15 years ago.\n\nAt home, Oscar Rosa was a quiet boy. At school, he was the star debater, and later, a star coach.\n\nâOscar helped many students grow into the people they are,â said Samantha Rosas, the current debate team captain at Rosaâs alma mater. âHe consoled me as I cried after losing in debate and he never failed to make all of us laugh.â\n\nRosa put Cudahyâs Elizabeth Learning Center debate team on the map, Rosaâs sister Irma said.\n\nAfter graduating from ELC, where he was debate captain, he returned to the school to help coach the team. At competitions, heâd even lend a hand to students from opposing teams.\n\nHe taught âour team everything we know,â students wrote on a GoFundMe page that has raised more than $17,000 for his family. âHe always listened and provided the best advice anyone could hope for.â\n\nOscar Leonel Rosa died of COVID-19 complications on June 26 at St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood. He was 25.\n\nRosa always found time to help others. Although he commuted to Cal State Fullerton from his familyâs Bell Gardens home, heâd use his business smarts to help his dad with the paperwork and payroll at his mechanic shop in Commerce.\n\nâSomehow, this kid was getting his major, his minor, helping my dad with his job and would go back to Cudahy from Fullerton to coach the kids twice a week,â Irma said. âItâs so strange to explain how he found the time to do everything.â\n\nIt was just who Rosa was, his mother Sonia said. He always made time for those he loved.\n\nOne time, after going to the bank, he spotted a woman selling Salvadoran quesadillas, a sweet cheese pound cake. He approached her and bought all of the slices she had left and even gave her some extra money.\n\nâHe was just like that,â Sonia said. âHe did so many good deeds and heâd never say a word about them.â\n\nA few months ago, Rosa bought his two younger siblings their own cars so they could commute to their classes at Cal State Northridge. He was paying the cars off and told them not to worry about the payments. He wanted his siblings to focus on school and have a future, like the one he was building for himself.\n\nâHe always would tell them to echarle muchas ganasâ, his mom said. Put in your best effort.\n\nAfter Rosa died, his sister called the dealership to see when the next payments were due for both cars. Rosa had them paid off until October.\n\nâOscar left but he blasted a lot of love into the universe,â Irma said. âHe was always planning ahead.â\n\nRosa started running a fever on June 11, a few days after using a rental car. Three days later, he tested positive for COVID-19. His family tried to keep him in isolation as his symptoms worsened.\n\nHe was taken to the hospital on June 15 as he started having trouble breathing and his body began to ache. He died 11 days later.\n\nRosa is survived by his parents Sonia and Oscar, siblings Irma, Eduardo and NoÃ© and nieces Amarey and Adalie, who was born just after his death.\n\nâIt feels as if they cut off my right arm,â his mother said. âHe was everything to us.â\n\nMargaret Romero was the picture of grace and elegance.\n\nâEvery morning at work before Iâd see her, Iâd wonder, âWhat kind of gorgeous outfit is she going to be wearing today?â â said Earleen Williams, a friend of 40 years who worked with Romero at a health center.\n\nMost who knew her can call up an image of Romero flashing a warm smile in her flowing homemade dresses adorned with the patterns of her beloved Big Pine Paiute Tribe, her look completed by matching native jewelry sheâd picked up at local shops. Even in retirement, when they mostly saw each other occasionally at the grocery store, Romero never failed to look immaculate, Williams said.\n\nOn Dec. 26, Romero went into the Northern Inyo Hospital in Bishop with COVID-19. She died 13 days later, at age 73.\n\nRomero was as beautiful in her character as in her appearance, friends said. Her poise and benevolence aided her in a lifelong commitment to the wellness of the Paiute people in the Owens Valley.\n\nBorn Oct. 27, 1947, in Schurz, Nev., to two members of the Big Pine Paiute Tribe, Romero grew up in a tiny house in Big Pine, where she lived until the 1970s, when she left to study in North Hollywood. There, she met Andrew Romero, a member of the Taos Pueblo tribe in New Mexico. They married and together had two daughters, Shawna and Shannon.\n\nIn 1979, she moved back to Big Pine with her young family, where they filled a new house on the reservation and welcomed their third child, son Sage.\n\nRomeroâs return to the reservation helped spark a revival of a cultural identity that had been fading among Owens Valley Paiute people, Sage said. Romero spent hours interviewing elders, who taught her traditional songs and dances and described the clothing worn for performances. In 1998, she formed the TovowahamatÃ¼ Singers and Dancers, a group of young girls who perform traditional dances and songs at community events throughout the year. She directed practices in her backyard and used her skills as a seamstress to craft traditional dresses for the group.\n\nâAll those girls that were part of the original group are mothers with their own children,â Sage said. âTheyâve kept their children involved with the learning and have kept the songs and dances going.â\n\nRomeroâs devotion to young people was also a theme in her professional life. For years, she served as the director of family services at the Toiyabe Indian Health Project, a healthcare provider for Indigenous people in the Owens Valley. In that role, she created a number of wellness programs focused on combating addiction and lifting the self-esteem of children. These programs were particularly important in communities beset by substance abuse, Sage said.\n\nAfter her time at the health center, Romero worked for the neighboring Bishop Paiute Tribe as an Indian Child Welfare Act liaison, helping reconnect neglected native children with their roots.\n\nRomero inspired Sage to become a cultural bearer in his own right. An accomplished hoop dancer, Sage has spent the better part of his life sharing his Paiute and Taos Pueblo culture through dance and art. For the last few years, Sage had been building a studio in Big Pine for the community to practice Paiute songs, dances and other arts.\n\nThe Margaret Lucille Romero Memorial studio will open its doors this spring for the first time and continue its namesakeâs legacy.\n\nFor Andy Marin, weekends were for barbecues and family.\n\nBlasting his âlowrider oldiesâ playlist, Marin would spend the weekend cooking up tri-tip and ribs for his family and neighbors. After he was done, heâd sit back and watch with a smile on his face as his wife and children ate his delectable meals.\n\nâIt didnât matter how long he was away from home, heâd spend his weekends barbecuing,â his wife Krystal Magno said. âThat was how he unwinded.â\n\nAndres âAndyâ Marin III died on July 1 of COVID-19 complications at Sierra View Medical Center in Porterville. He was 38.\n\nFrom tacos on his flat-top grill to Filipino lumpias and pancet, Marin always knew the way to peopleâs hearts: his cooking. When Magno took lunch breaks during her 12-hour shifts at the Sierra View emergency room where she worked, heâd feed everyone there, she said.\n\nâWhatâs our husband bringing us for dinner today?â her coworkers would ask jokingly.\n\nThis year, Marin began living his dream of being a long-haul truck driver. After working with truck drivers for much of his life at a shipping and receiving company, he took on this new challenge to help his family. He wanted his wife to focus on nursing school.\n\nMarin loved being on the road and taking in the scenery. One of his first road trips on the job took him across the country to Florida. He came back inspired (and with some trinkets).\n\nâHe wanted to see and absorb as much as he could,â Magno said.\n\nMarin started developing COVID symptoms during a two-week work trip in early June, when he started having headaches and a light cough.\n\nâWe were always afraid it would be me who would get it,â Magno said, referring to her job at a hospital emergency room. âI had seen so many people recover from it; I never thought it would kill one of us.â\n\nMarin later went on a second trip and cut it short after experiencing body aches, nausea and vomiting. On June 15, his oxygen levels dropped, and he was admitted to the hospital. He died 16 days later, after being diagnosed with both bacterial and viral pneumonia. He spent his last days intubated.\n\nâIt was a roller coaster ride from the day he was admitted to the day he passed,â Krystal said.\n\nMarin is survived by his wife, Krystal, children Karrie, Andres IV and Alyssa, his parents Maribel and Andres II, his grandmothers, Jovita Marin and Graciela Mercado, and his sister, Lorraine.\n\nâI cry tears of happiness because so many people made it and with them, a little bit of Andy [does] too,â Magno said. âOne victory is a victory for all of us.â\n\nIn the days since Michelle and Christine Caley lost their father, Ken, to the novel coronavirus, theyâve been consoled by being able to break through the fog of sadness and share a laugh.\n\nâItâs funny; he was very much a âGirl Dad,ââ said Michelle, using the phrase made famous after Kobe Bryantâs death in January. âHe didnât have boys, but he taught us all the skills he would have taught a boy. How to throw a spiral, how to bait a hook. We still hold that we caught bigger fish than he ever did, much to his dismay.â\n\nThereâs proof, too.
