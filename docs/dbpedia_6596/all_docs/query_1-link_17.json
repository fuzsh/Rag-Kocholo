        "text": "NORMAL, Ill. -- Bob Bender, an assistant at Duke for the past six years, has been chosen the new head coach at Illinois State, UPI has learned.\n\nBender, 31, will be officially announced at a Friday press conference at the Missouri Valley Conference school.\n\nThe job is a homecoming for Bender, who was a prep All-America in 1975 at nearby Bloomington High School.\n\nFollowing high school, Bender signed with Indiana University and as a freshman played for the Hoosiers' 1976 unbeaten national championship team. He then transferred to Duke for his final three college seasons, and played a key role on the 1978 Blue Devils squad that lost to Kentucky in the NCAA title game.\n\nBender, a 1980 Duke graduate, is the only player in history to play in NCAA championship games for two different schools. He since has been an assistant on three Duke teams that reached the Final Four.\n\nBender replaces Bob Donewald, who was fired after a 13-17 season, the Redbirds' first losing record in 19 years and Donewald's first in 11 seasons."
