        "text": "TELL CITY, Ind. – Norman Vincent Peale has nothing on Kent Benson, who also preaches the power of positive thinking.\n\nBenson, who helped spark Indiana University to the 1976 NCAA men’s basketball championship, will speak during Schweizer Fest at 6 p.m. on Sunday at the Tell City gazebo.\n\n“I’m going to talk about excellence. What excellence is,” he said.\n\nBenson experienced excellence first-hand - that ’76 IU team remains the last undefeated NCAA Division I basketball team standing.\n\n“You have to be at your very best in everything you do and the way you do it,” said Benson, who parlayed his sweet hook shot into a 11-year NBA career after his glory days at IU.\n\nA religious man, Benson referred to Ecclesiastes 9:10. The International Standard Version states:\n\nWhatever the activity in which you engage, do it with all your ability, because there is no work, no planning, no learning, and no wisdom in the next world where you're going.\n\nBenson refers to the six d’s: desire, determination, dedication, discipline, direction and decision.\n\nSlogans aside, he played an integral role on IU’s national championship team. While Evansville native Bob Griese made no bones about celebrating with his 1972 Miami Dolphins’ teammates when the 16-0 New England Patriots lost to the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII in February 2008, hoisting a glass of champagne and maybe smoking a cigar. That '72 Dolphins team remains the last unbeaten NFL champion.\n\nFor his part, Benson didn't revel in the fact that Kentucky's 2015 men's basketball team went down in the NCAA Final Four, saying records are made to be...\n\n\"They were 38 and Wisconsin,\" Benson said.\n\nSheer depth and all-around excellence were the hallmarks of the ’76 IU team. The entire starting five was drafted into the NBA.\n\nQuinn Buckner, a senior, was the undisputed leader at the point. Scott May, another senior, was the standout power forward and National Player of the Year. Benson, a junior who was MVP of the Final Four, was the burly man in the middle. Senior starters Bobby Wilkerson and Tom Abernethy were also NBA draftees. Reserves Wayne Radford, then a sophomore, and Bob Bender, then a freshman, swelled the eventual list of NBA draftees to seven.\n\n“We complemented one another and pursued and accomplished our goals,” Benson said. “Each and every one of us played to our God-given talent and abilities.”\n\nCerebral Jim Crews, who guided the University of Evansville to NCAA tournament berths in 1989, '92, ’93 and ’99, also came off the bench.\n\nBenson confirmed that coach Bob Knight, who guided that 1976 team, plus the ’81 and ’87 teams to NCAA titles, is not in good health. Knight was still regarded as witty, but struggled with his memory during a speaking engagement in April at Center Grove.\n\n“He moved back to Bloomington to be closer to his doctors,” Benson said.\n\nBenson, who is chairman/founder of the Indiana Class Basketball All-Star Classic, has heard about Reitz High School junior Khristian Lander, arguably the most highly-regarded prospect out of Evansville since Calbert Cheaney and Walter McCarty.\n\n“He’s got a long way to go to be in the same category as Calbert Cheaney, the Big Ten’s all-time leading scorer,” Benson said.\n\nNot a fan of Tom Crean, Benson thinks coach Archie Miller will bring the Cream and Crimson back to national prominence. He said Miller has a legacy of experience and knowledge from which to draw, from his father, John, and brother, Sean, current Arizona head coach.\n\n“(Archie) is far more qualified to coach (IU) than Tom Crean,” Benson said.\n\nThrough it all, it all comes back to that 1976 NCAA championship team and that’s just fine with Benson.\n\n“We were named the best team in NCAA history,” he said.\n\nWhile NCAA.com, the United States Basketball Writers Association and sports information directors named the '76 IU team the best single-season team in NCAA history, some Hoosier aficionados regard the '75 team as even better. Those Hoosiers were undefeated until May broke his arm late in the season. Without him, No. 1 IU lost to No. 2 Kentucky 92-90 in a regional final. Indiana players of that era are split on which team was better. Knight said the '76 was better because most of the players were a year older.\n\nIf May had been healthy...well, we'll never know for sure.\n\nContact Gordon Engelhardt at Gordon.engelhardt@courierpress.com or on Twitter @EngGordon\n\nKENT BENSON\n\nWhere: Tell City gazebo, Schweizer Fest\n\nWhen: 6 p.m. CDT Sunday\n\nAdmission: free.
