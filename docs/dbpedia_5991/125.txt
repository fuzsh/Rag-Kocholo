Thai BL films and series are going strong, despite facing political and economic challenges. Earlier this month at Cannes, Man Suang became one of the first Thai BL films to be premiered on the international stage. Now, award-winning director Tanwarin Sukkhapisit is taking their own BL film, Moments of Love, beyond Thailand to screen at Love is Love! A 3-day film festival that’s happening during the Helsinki Pride in Finland (June 26-28). The screening is supported by the Thai Embassy, and another of their film It Gets Better will also be shown at the event.

Moments of Love explores a variety of BL romances through four mini-films: “My Lovely Tutor” tells of the complicated relationship between a student and a private tutor; “My Ex-Boyfriend” reveals how a relationship changes between two boys; “My Heartless Boy” sees the complex relationship between an aspiring actor and his friend; and “My Crazy Romance” tells the story of two boys who met and bonded during turning points in lives.

Tanwarin Sukkhapisit, who proudly identifies as LGBTQ+, is an award-winning film director, screenwriter, and actor known for the infamous film and social commentary Insects in the Backyard. They were the first publicly-open LGBTQ+ MP in the history of the House of Representatives before being expelled in 2020 due to owning stocks in media (which is illegal in Thailand).

The movie, which features Thai actors Thitipong Sangngey and Saranvut Nittayasuthi (My Heartless Boy); Chisanupong Puangmanee and Pongsapak Rachaporn (My Crazy Romance); Ratchanon Kanphiang and Kashane Pichetsopon (My Ex-Boyfriend); and Sorawut Arunwattananunt and Napat Praphakamol (My Lovely Tutor), has not been scheduled for a Thai release.
