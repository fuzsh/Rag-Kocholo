        "text": "We also included a few tips and tricks for making a video ad of your own.\n\nBut that’s not all. As a bonus, we threw in two editable commercial video templates at the end of this article. Use them as a starting point for your own. (Or better yet, start your free trial of Biteable for access to hundreds of brandable templates and scenes, plus over 24 million video clips, pictures, and animations.)\n\nSince the very first television commercial ran — for $9 — more than 75 years ago, TV advertising has grown into a $75 billion/year industry. Though TV’s market share has dropped as many viewers cut the cord, internet advertising has ensured video ads are more popular than ever.\n\nSo what does it take to make a good ad? As you’ll see in the commercial examples below, there are a few common traits the best commercials all share:\n\nA good commercial is memorable.\n\nFrom “Wassup!” to “Where’s the Beef?” the most successful commercial ads have a way of ingraining themselves in your memory (whether you want them to or not!) Today’s average urbanite sees some 5,000 commercial messages in a single day. Your job, as an advertiser, is to cut through the noise and stand out with a message that’s relevant, different, and effectively represents your brand.\n\nA good commercial is shareworthy.\n\nFor maximum exposure, your ad should make people want to talk about it with other people, both in real life and on social media. Usually, the ads that inspire that kind of dialogue have elicited some kind of emotional reaction: they’re funny, shocking, weird, or emotionally touching.\n\nIt communicates the brand’s values.\n\nThe best ads capture a brand’s voice and identity, and communicate the ethos behind the company. Your audience should watch your ad and think, “this brand is for people like me.”\n\nIt includes a call-to-action.\n\nLastly, an effective commercial ad makes clear what it wants viewers to do next, whether it’s visit a website, lease a car, or buy some candy. While some advertisers skip this step, incorporating the brand more subtly or focusing on awareness, you can really only get away with this if you’re already a household name like Nike or Apple.\n\nAnd now, without further ado, here are our top 20 all-time favorite commercial examples:\n\nLet’s get this out of the way: humor is hard. What’s hilarious to one person might be downright annoying to another. When it’s effective, a funny ad grabs attention and inspires positive feelings for a brand. But a joke that falls flat can do the opposite, or even inspire a negative backlash.\n\nMoreover, experts are split on whether even a hilarious, popular commercial ad will actually translate to increased revenue and awareness. In some cases, a funny ad causes a so-called “vampire effect” in which viewers remember the ad, but not the product or company it’s associated with.\n\nThe key, it seems, is to strike just the right balance between being funny, relevant, and informative.\n\nHere are some of the most effective, and funniest, examples of commercials we’ve seen yet:\n\nNext up on our list of fave commercial examples: animation.\n\nAnimated television commercials are nothing new. They’ve been a mainstay of advertising since at least 1941, when the first animated commercial aired, and they’ve grown in popularity in the decades that followed.\n\nAt first, animated ads relied on hand-drawn cel animation which made them far more expensive than the live-action ads that dominated. Thanks to advancements in technology, high-end animated adverts eventually became cheaper to produce than their live action counterparts. But that’s not the only reason advertisers like them.\n\nAs you’ll see in our picks for the best animated commercials, animated characters are endearing and relatable, appealing to people of all ages, and they’re capable of performing actions that would be impossible to film with real-life actors (human or animal)."
