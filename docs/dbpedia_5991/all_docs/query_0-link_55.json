        "text": "Pimchanok Luevisadpaibul as Nam, a 7th grade girl with a dark skin, thick glasses, and a school-conformed haircut. She lives with her mother and a younger sister, and helps her mother manage a B&B while her father is working in the States as a Thai cook to support their family. Nam hangs out with three close friends; they are often considered as an unattractive girl group in the school. Nam places average in her class rank; the only subject she is good at is English.\n\nMario Maurer as Shone, a 10th grade boy who is a star of the school. He is a son of a retired soccer player of the town who missed his penalty shot which costs the team their national champion title. From that incident, Shone is frequently teased as “The boy whose father missed the penalty shot”. Shone nevertheless plays soccer at school although he refuses to shoot any penalty shot and thus is not part of the school team despite his high skills. Shone’s other interest is photography; he is good enough to win a contest.\n\nSudarat Budtporm as Teacher Inn, an English teacher in Nam’s class who is fighting with Teacher Orn for the heart of Teacher Pon. She is also a caretaker of the school’s English drama club, albeit its low popularity among students. She seems to be close to the superintendent that he tasked her to find a replacement drum major, where she chooses Nam. She eventually found love at the end of the story with the new P.E. teacher after Teacher Pon left the school.\n\nTangi namonto as Teacher Pon, a P.E. teacher and the coach of the school’s soccer team. He is pursued by both Teacher Inn and Teacher Orn, although he seems to show no preference between the two.\n\nPijitra Siriwerapan as Teacher Orn, a caretaker of the school’s Thai dance club, which is very popular among female students and is believed to be the pool of all pretty girls in school. She, like Teacher Inn, seems to be flirting with Teacher Pon although she chooses a more subtle way.\n\nAcharanat Ariyaritwikol as Top, a new student who enters the school midyear of the 11th grade. He is a childhood friend of Shone. Top instantly replaces Shone as the new star of the school from his good look. He is attracted to Nam and decides to ask her out. After Nam breaks up with him, he makes Shone promise not to pursue her.\n\nKachamat Pormsaka Na-Sakonnakorn as Pin, Shone’s female classmate and in the same circle of friends. She is appointed as a makeup artist for the English drama club, where she successfully beautify Nam for the school play, Snow White. She once helps prevent Nam from Faye’s fish sauce-infused Coca cola trap. Pin remains close friend with Shone after high school: he helps her take care of her baby boy.\n\nYanika Thongprayoon as Faye, Nam’s archenemy. She considered herself a pretty girl and is also pursuing Shone based on the fact that he is a star of the school. However, Pin told Shone about her scheme on Nam and she later pursues Top instead."
