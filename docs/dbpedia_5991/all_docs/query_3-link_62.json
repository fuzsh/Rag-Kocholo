        "text": "More of a reflection. Contains spoilers.\n\nIt is a love story like any other. Yet one told so pointedly and poignantly.\n\nFirst Love (2022) is a story of Noguchi Yae (played by Mitsushima Hikari and Yagi Rikako [young]) and Namiki Harumichi (played by Satoh Takeru and Kido Taisei [young]) who loved each other in high school. Together, they grew, they dreamt and supported each other in pursuing these dreams. But life happened. They fall short of their dreams. They part. Over 10 years later, they meet again. Can they finally fulfill their first love this time?\n\nThe nine-episode Netflix series anchors itself on two things to capture its audience: (1) the idea of fate and (2) the feelings that come with the arrival, departure, and potential return of a first love. These are the typical strings to pull when trying to tell a first love story because people always get soft on these stories, especially the ones that end happy. It works because (1) somehow, it confirms that there is someone “meant to be” for each of us and (2) it brings us back to the time, to the thrill, when we had our own first loves. The series recognizes the levers it has with this genre and effectively uses it – but not quickly out of the box. It tailors it to fit the message it seeks to deliver and the audience it seeks to cater to.\n\nANCHORING ON FATE\n\nMeeting your first love from decades ago does feel like a fateful encounter. And many times, the drama actually verbalized the idea of fate. Is it indeed fate? But what is fate?\n\nAt the very start of episode one, Yae quotes that life is like a jigsaw puzzle.\n\nIf fate dictates life and life is a jigsaw puzzle, is it one that has been pre-designed and all we have to do is to piece it together? Or is it a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces we create ourselves?\n\nI am more than inclined to say it is the latter. And this is what I also gathered from this drama.\n\nFate is made up of our decisions and indecision, our actions and non-action, in response to the circumstances that we find ourselves in. It is made up of our choices to make the left turn or right, or go straight, just keep going around the roundabout. Certainly, there will be bumpy, unpaved roads, exhausting traffic, tires running flat, and many times, we will get lost – but what matters is how we react to it. Amid all these, how do we get to the place we want to go?\n\nWe saw this in the story of Yae and Harumichi. It was about two people navigating life, set on their respective destinations, yet life gave them sharp curves and detours that forced them apart. Life did shape many of their decisions. Yet ultimately, it was their decisions that soon shaped their lives. They may have been each other’s first loves but had they not chosen each other in the end, their “happily ever after” would not have happened. Had they not chosen to exit the roundabout and take the road towards their long-dreamed destination, despite the decade-long delay, they would not have arrived.\n\n“Planes have a speed that’s called V1. A speed that can split fate. Whenever you’re still below this speed, you can cancel your take-off. But the second you go over V1, you have to fly no matter what happens.\n\nLife presents us with few of these exceptionally very unique moments.\n\nWhat do you want? [Are you willing to] face all the unpredictable rough winds out there?\n\nOr do you just want to fly and glide?”\n\nNamiki Harumichi\n\nANCHORING ON EMOTIONS\n\nFirst Love is one poignant series – driven mainly by its masterful story-weaving intensified by its sounds and its silence.\n\nEmotions hit you as early as episode one as Utada Hikaru’s First Love (1999) plays and both you and the character get suddenly caught in a wave of nostalgia, forgotten wounds suddenly reopened. This is more so for the members of the audience (like me) who know the song from our childhood – and likely much more so for the Japanese community. And nostalgia is the core feeling that the drama anchors itself to to capture its audience. A reminiscence of the late 90’s. A reminiscence of our own first loves, first hopes, and first dreams.\n\nBeyond music, First Love also leverages the quiet in igniting emotions. I observe that this is quite common among Japanese dramas and films. There is something about them that expertly captures the human emotion without the need to be overt about it. They are able to richly grasp happiness, hopefulness, despair, agony, and even the pretense of contentment with just going around the roundabout – in the unspoken. They seem to find comfort in discomfort. And that is what makes it so poignant. Because the emotions it ignites in us, the audience, get to simmer in that silence.\n\nOverall, First Love is a love story, like the thousands we’ve already read and seen. And like any other first love drama, it anchors on the idea of fate and the feelings that come with first loves, yet knowingly tailors these to its purpose.\n\nIt uses the concept of fate to denounce the thought that it is pre-determined; rather, it is mostly in our hands, a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces we ourselves create, to eventually put together and find meaning in. It brings out the emotions – the nostalgia, the thrill, the heartache, and the happiness – with the arrival, departure, and return of first loves but in its own nuanced way most fitting to its culture and its intended audience.\n\nIt may seem like any other first love story but it is its own. And this is what makes otherwise common dramas remarkable.\n\n/20221127"
