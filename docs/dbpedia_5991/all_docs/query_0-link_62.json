        "text": "Last updated: Oct 13, 2017\n\nISSUE\n\nCustom form script is now disabled by default and requires setting registry keys to re-enable it.\n\nThe new registry key has a default value of 1, which indicates form script should not run.\n\nFirst create this key:\n\n32 bit Office on 64 bit Windows\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Outlook\\Security\n\n32 bit Office on 32 bit Windows or 64 bit Office on 64 bit Windows\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Outlook\\Security\n\nThen create DWORD (32-bit) Value 0 and set the name to DisableCustomFormItemScript to enable custom form scripts.\n\nOnce custom form scripts have been enabled at all, they must then be enabled per form message class. For instance, if you have a form with the message class IPM.Note.Custom, we must register “IPM.Note.Custom” as a trusted form message class. To do this, first create this key:\n\n32 bit Office on 64 bit Windows\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Outlook\\Forms\\TrustedFormScriptList\n\n32 bit Office on 32 bit Windows or 64 bit Office on 64 bit Windows\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Outlook\\Forms\\TrustedFormScriptList\n\nThen, create REG_SZ values in this key for each form you wish to allow scripts to run. In the above example, you would create a REG_SZ value named “IPM.Note.Custom” with empty data.\n\nWhen designing a form, Run This Form will run a form using the message class of the base form. So if you started designing an IPM.Note form and want to Run This Form, you will need to have IPM.Note registered. After you publish, the published message class is what will be checked. Once you have finished designing your form and published it to a custom form name, remove the standard “IPM.Note” from the trusted list.\n\nNotes:\n\nYou need to restart Outlook after setting the TrustedFormScriptList key.\n\nThe example registry keys use 16.0 for Outlook 2016. Use 15.0 for Outlook 2013, 14.0 for Outlook 2010 and 12.0 for Outlook 2007.\n\nAfter making the above changes the registry keys will look like the following:\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Outlook\\Security]\n\nDisableCustomFormItemScript\"=dword:00000000\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Outlook\\Forms\\TrustedFormScriptList]\n\n\"IPM.Note.Custom\"=\"\"\n\n\"IPM.Note\"=\"\"\n\nNOTE: In some cases forms in secondary mailboxes and Public folders still don't work after the registry key settings. To fix this, enable scripts in the Trust Center:\n\nClick File > Options. Then select Trust Center > Trust Center Settings > Email Security.\n\nUnder the Script in Folders section, click the checkbox for Allow script in shared folders and Allow script in Public folders and click OK and OK again to close out the windows.\n\nSTATUS\n\nThe change was first introduced in the September 12th, 2017 Outlook Public Updates and is included in the following MSI updates which now require the registry keys.\n\nOutlook 2007\n\nOutlook 2010\n\nOutlook 2013\n\nOutlook 2016\n\nClick to Run status is as follows:\n\nMonthly Channel (Current Channel) will start supporting the registry keys in the update scheduled for September 18th release build 16.0.8431.2079.\n\nSemi-Annual Channel (FRDC) supports the registry keys with build 16.0.8431.2079.\n\nDeferred Channel supports the registry keys with build 16.0.8201.2193.\n\nDeferred Extended status is TBD.\n\nInsider Fast status is TBD.\n\nInsider Slow supports the registry keys with build 16.0.8431.2079.\n\nISSUE\n\nAfter adding an email account to Outlook for Windows (Outlook 2016, 2013, 2010 versions) you may experience the following:\n\nYour email account name shows up as outlook_[long series of letters and numbers]@outlook.com in the Folder Pane and when composing emails using Outlook for Windows.\n\nRecipients will also receive the email from the sender with the outlook_[long series of letters and numbers]@outlook.com format.\n\nWhen recipients reply to the email, the email bounces and you may receive the message “Undeliverable message when you send Internet mail in Outlook.”\n\nThis issue can occur when you register a 3rd party email address (e.g., an email address that is not Outlook.com or Hotmail.com) for your Microsoft Account and don't use Outlook.com for sending and receiving email.\n\nIf you typically use an Outlook.com account for email, this issue can occur if there are multiple aliases on the account and the 3rd party email address is the primary alias. Please see the ALTERNATIVE WORKAROUND section below.\n\nWORKAROUND\n\nSet up your account manually as an IMAP or POP account in Outlook.\n\nClose Outlook\n\nUse Windows Key + R then type “outlook /profiles” (omitting the quotes) in the Run window and hit “OK” Note: There is a space between outlook and the forward slash (/)\n\nIn the launched “Choose Profile” box, select Options > New\n\nType a new, unique profile name and select OK\n\nChoose Advanced options > Let me set up my account manually.\n\nEnter your account password, then choose Connect.\n\nIf setup fails, select Change Account Settings. Update the account information with the one you received from your email provider or from the POP and IMAP server name reference topic. Choose Connect then then select Done.\n\nIn the Choose Profile window, select Set as default profile and select OK.\n\nALTERNATIVE WORKAROUND\n\nSwitch your alias to an Outlook.com or Hotmail.com account.\n\nNote: If you do not have another alias, select the link on the page to create one. Choose Add email and a new alias and then choose the option Create a new email address and add it as an alias.\n\nGo to https://account.live.com/names/Manage and sign in to your Outlook.com account.\n\nSet your Outlook.com email as the primary alias.\n\nIn Outlook for Windows, remove and re-add the account. See the steps in this article: Add your Outlook.com account in Outlook for Windows\n\nLast updated: February 8, 2017\n\nISSUE\n\nIf Outlook is connected to a primary Outlook.com account that is also connected to other secondary non-Microsoft accounts (such as Gmail, Yahoo, etc.), when sending an email in Outlook, you are not able to choose the other secondary connected account as the \"From\" sending account.\n\nIf you manually type in the secondary connected account email address in the \"From\" field, the email is sent as \"On behalf of\" your primary Outlook.com account.\n\nSTATUS: WORKAROUND\n\nOutlook supports sending from a secondary connected account for Microsoft owned domains such as @outlook.com, @live.com, @hotmail.com but has not implemented this functionality for third-party domains.\n\nThe Outlook team is listening to your feedback and investigating adding this functionality to future updates. To learn more about how to provide feedback, see How do I give feedback on Microsoft Office. In the meantime, please use the following workaround:\n\nWORKAROUND\n\nYou can also add the secondary connected accounts (Gmail, Yahoo, etc.) in Outlook.com as additional accounts in the Outlook profile.\n\nIn Outlook, choose the File tab.\n\nUnder Account Information, choose Add Account.\n\nOn the Auto Account Setup page, enter your name, email address, and password, and then choose Next.\n\nNote: If you receive an error message after choosing Next, double check your email address and password. If both are correct, see the next section.\n\nChoose Finish.\n\nFor more information, please see Outlook email setup.\n\nISSUE\n\nLast updated: August 3, 2017\n\nThis issue affects all Outlook versions on Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10.\n\nWhen searching in Outlook, you get this error: “Something went wrong and your search couldn’t be completed.”, or \"Search results may be incomplete because items are still being indexed\".\n\nAnd you'll see this Event Log warning:\n\nSTATUS: FIXED\n\nWindows has released fixes via Windows Updates to address a reliability issue in Windows Search. Below are the relevant KB updates for each version:\n\nWindows 7 - July 11, 2017 update\n\nWindows 8.1 - July 11, 2017 update\n\nWindows 10 Version 1703 - KB 4025342\n\nWindows 10 Version 1607 - KB4025334\n\nWindows 10 Version 1511 - KB4025344\n\nWindows 10 - KB4025338\n\nNote: The fix for this issue has been released on June 27, 2017. If you implemented the workaround to disable Windows Desktop Search Service, you can now set the PreventIndexingOutlook registry key to DWORD: 0 to go back to using Windows Search.\n\nWORKAROUND\n\nIf the issue is not resolved after installing the updates, please use the workaround below:\n\nIf search is not working for Exchange accounts, delete the OST files which will cause a re-sync and re-index of the account:\n\nOST files are typically stored at C:\\Users\\<your username>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Outlook.\n\nTo find the name and location of the OST file, click File, Account Settings, Account Settings, Data Files. Locate the correct email address, click on the name, and click Open File Location.\n\nBefore you can delete the OST file, you need to close Outlook so the process will release the file.\n\nAfter deleting the file, restart Outlook and let the email sync again.\n\nAnother workaround is to Create a new Outlook profile, and add your accounts to the new profile. We recommend keeping the old profile until you know you have moved over any local data or PST files.\n\nUntil you can install the Windows Update fix release, you can set a registry key that will cause Outlook to stop using the local Windows Search service. When this registry key is set, Outlook will use its own built-in search engine. The built-in search will display the message below to indicate it is not using the Windows Search service.\n\nDisable Windows Desktop Search Service for Outlook:\n\nNote: The following steps show you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Please make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, see this article.\n\nOpen Registry Editor.\n\nGo to: Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Windows Search\n\nPreventIndexingOutlook\n\nSet DWORD: 1\n\nDetailed Instructions:\n\nClick Start, click Run, type regedit in the Open box, and then click OK.\n\nLocate and then click the following subkey in the registry:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\n\nOn the Edit menu, point to New, and then click New Key and name the key Windows Search.\n\nClick on the new key Windows Search.\n\nOn the Edit menu, point to New, and then click DWORD Value.\n\nType PreventIndexingOutlook for the name of the DWORD, and then press Enter.\n\nRight-click PreventIndexingOutlook, and then click Modify.\n\nIn the Value data box, type 1 to enable the registry entry, and then click OK.\n\nNote to disable the PreventIndexingOutlook setting, type 0 (zero), and then click OK.\n\nExit Registry Editor, and then restart Outlook.\n\nISSUE\n\niCloud fails to load properly in Outlook 2007, Outlook 2010, Outlook 2013 and Outlook 2016.\n\nWhen accessing Calendar, Contacts, or Tasks, you get the following error:\n\nThe set of folders cannot be opened. MAPI was unable to load the information service C:\\PROGRA~2\\COMMON~1\\Apple\\Internet Services\\APLZOD.dll. Be sure the service is correctly installed and configured.\"\n\nSTATUS: WORKAROUND\n\nThe loading of unregistered MAPI services has been disabled by default to make Outlook more secure.\n\nIf you're using Outlook 2010, Outlook 2013 or Outlook 2016, uninstall and re-install iCloud to resolve this issue. For more information, see this page.\n\nFor Outlook 2007, use the workaround below:\n\nWarning: This workaround may make your computer or your network more vulnerable to attack by malicious users or by malicious software such as viruses. Microsoft does not recommend this workaround but is providing this information so that you can choose to implement this workaround at your own discretion. Use this workaround at your own risk.\n\nIf you have trusted applications that depend on being loaded in this manner, you can re-enable those applications by setting the following registry key:\n\nREG_DWORD HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\12.0\\Outlook\\Security\\AllowUnregisteredMapiServices\n\nYou can use the following registry subkey to apply the registry setting as a domain policy:\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Office\\12.0\\Outlook\\Security\\AllowUnregisteredMapiServices\n\nValue 0 (default): Block loading of unregistered MAPI services. This is the recommended setting to avoid unexpected execution of unknown code.\n\nValue 1: Enable loading of unregistered MAPI services.\n\nImportant: The following steps show you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Please make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, see this article.\n\nTo make these registry changes, follow these steps:\n\nClick Start, click Run, type regedit in the Open box, and then click OK.\n\nLocate and then click the following subkey in the registry:\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\12.0\\Outlook\\Security\\\n\nOn the Edit menu, point to New, and then click DWORD Value.\n\nType AllowUnregisteredMapiServices for the name of the DWORD, and then press Enter.\n\nRight-click AllowUnregisteredMapiServices, and then click Modify.\n\nIn the Value data box, type 1 to enable the registry entry, and then click OK.\n\nNote: To disable the AllowUnregisteredMapiServices setting, type 0 (zero), and then click OK.\n\nExit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.\n\nVulnerability information (applies to all versions)\n\nMAPI does not validate that a provider’s DLL that it is requested to load is registered correctly in MapiSVC.inf or even that it comes from the local machine. This can be exploited by creating a file together with an OLE object in such a way to cause MAPI to load a DLL from a network share when the OLE object is activated. This can allow arbitrary code execution to occur.\n\nLast Updated: March 9, 2018\n\nISSUE\n\nWhen you try to configure a secondary account from the same Microsoft 365 tenant in Outlook 2016 (Current Channel) with ADAL enabled, you receive the following error: \"An encrypted connection to your mail server is not available. Click Next to attempt using an unencrypted connection.\"\n\nSTATUS: FIXED\n\nThis issue is fixed in Office Insider Build 16.0.9124.2004 and higher. The fix will be available for Monthly Channel versions later in March.\n\nThe fix is currently only available in Insider build 16.0.9124.2004 and higher. It will eventually be made available to Monthly Channel versions later in March. For Semi-Annual Channel and Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted) versions, please disable ADAL on the client as a workaround. To do this, see Enable Modern Authentication for Office 2013 on Windows devices.\n\nYou can also start Outlook using the /profiles switch and create the profile. To do this:\n\nRight-click the Windows Start menu and choose Run.\n\nType Outlook.exe /profiles and press OK.\n\nWhen Outlook starts, click New in the Choose Profile window to create a new profile.\n\nLast updated: June, 5 2017\n\nISSUE\n\nYou may notice that All, Unread , Mentioned and other sort and filtering options, such as By date, and Newest are missing in Outlook above your email list.\n\nIf your Outlook version is 1703 (Build 7967.2161) or higher, the filters and sort options were moved under the All drop down menu, to accommodate space for the new Focused inbox.\n\nNote: If you don't know your Outlook version, go to File > Office Account to check your Outlook version.\n\nHow to filter and sort your mail\n\nTo sort your emails by Unread, Mentioned or use other filters, select the All button and choose one of the options.
