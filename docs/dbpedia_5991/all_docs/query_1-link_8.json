        "text": "It's been a while since I blogged, the truth to the matter is, i would not be here if not for this awesome movie. This started my whole THAI PHASE.\n\nNow, i need to vent all my fangirling thoughts. 450 character limit for FB is not enough besides, my FB frends has had enough its time to venture into more greener pastures. *winkuu*\n\nSynopsis:\n\nNam (Pimchanok Luevisetpaibool) is a bespectacled and dark-skinned 14-year-old ugly duckling secretly in love with Chon (Mario Maurer), her high school senior who also happens to be its most popular student. Over one summer, she ditches the spectacles and has her skin lightened. She is cast as Snow White in the school play and lands a spot as the leggy drum majorette leading the marching band.\n\nShe sets hearts aflutter, but not Chon’s. Or at least that’s what she thinks…\n\nDirected by: Putthiphong Promsakha & Wasin Pokpong\n\nCast: Mario Maurer, Pimchanok Luevisetpaibool, Sudarat Butrprom\n\nTrailer:\n\nWatch Online:\n\nPart 1 ll Part 2 ll Part 3 ll Part 4 ll Part 5 ll Part 6 ll Part 7 ll Part 8\n\nDownload Link:\n\nMovie with english subtitle\n\nMovie soundtrack --- Not the original OST. I couldn't find it no matter how hard i look. I've only compiled all the songs I know was used in the movie. The tracks include;\n\nเพราะใจ (Because Of My Heart)\n\nสักวันหนึ่ง (Someday)\n\nสิ่งเล็กๆที่เรียกว่ารัก (Little Thing Called Love)\n\nสักวันฉันจะดีพอ (Someday I'll Be Good Enough)\n\nวันเ เดือน ปี (Day/Month/Year)\n\n...ดาวดวงนั้น (The Star)\n\nMy thoughts\n\nThis is one of the best movies I've seen so far. The simplicity and truthfulness of the story is what sets it apart from the rest. It calls to you, its a reminder of memories past and a reflection of the hidden truth in our hearts -- in short its OUR story.\n\nBe honest, there was a time you were like NAM...\n\n“All of us have someone who is hidden at the bottom of our heart. When we think of them, we will feel like ummm… always feel a little pain inside, but we still want to keep him. Even though I don’t know where he is today, what he is doing, but he is the one that makes me know this - a little thing called love.”\n\nbecause I was, a very long time ago. The only difference is she got the guy at the end while I got my heart broken. Unrequited love will always remain unrequited, it will never have a happy ending! ( well, that's why this is a movie --- for things like this never happen in real life, oh how I wish it does)\n\nAnyway kudos to the scriptwriter, who ever you are. You manage to poke the hearts and stab it at times. Also, to the casting director ---- thank you for introducing to me, the most handsome thailand hottie next to Nickhun *appluase* Mario Maurer and thank you to this movie because it pave the way to my newest fixation thus i started blogging.\n\nNext post, i shall introduce THAI POPand other amazing thai movies.\n\nPS. Sorry about all the typos and grammatical error, its been a while since i tried this whole blogging thing."
