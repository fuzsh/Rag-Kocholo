        "text": "The very first time I watched this movie was in my high school days. Before this, I haven't watched any romantic Thai movie. And this movie \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" is an absolute delight to watch. It was Thai romantic comedy film, directed by Puttipong Pormsaka Na-Sakonnakorn and Wasin Pokpong, starred by lead actor and lead actress called Mario Maurer and Baifern Pimchanok Luevisadpaibul, who are now big stars in the world of Thailand's films. The plot is not anything special or out of the blue, it follows usual rom-com setting, that is a girl called Nam, who is shy and ordinary high school girl who has a secret crush on the most popular boy in school, Shone. Wanting to get attention from Shone, Nam tried various ways to get close with him. This movie beautifully exposes the innocence and awkwardness of unrequited love, while also exploring themes of self-discovery and personal growth. I think every girls could related the feelings and emotions of the characters as it captures from the awkward encounter in school corridors to the nervous flutter of first love. I can't help but reminisce about my own teenage years and also it brings the rollercoaster of emotions that come with it like fluttering, happiness or sadness. And the protagonists did very well to portray their own characters without over acting. They simply described the life and the experience of high school girl and boy in order that everyone could relate with them. Besides, the characters of Nam and her girl friends are also the highlight of this film. They are always there for her, whether she needs a pep talk or a shoulder to cry on. It show the importance of friendship as well as navigates the highs and lows of adolescence with humor, grace, and unwavering support for one another.\n\nAlthough this movie is a great one for me, I don't think everyone will like it or not. I would recommend to whoever likes to watch the genre of high schools, romantic-comedy, relaxed one, it is a must-watch movie. Anyway, this movie is pure gem for me and it is addicting to watch over and over again. Timeless. It is a kind of movie that just makes you feel good inside. It's like a warm blanket on a chilly day or your favorite comfort food. Whenever I rewatch it, I still feel butterflies in my stomach due to Nam and Shone's love story. Everything in the movie seems so beautiful and realistic. Even the dialogue is also great and as for the humor, it describes prone jokes in schools as well as the funny stories between teachers and students. And Nam's awkward encounters with Shone or her hilarious antics with her friends, are also parts of realistic humor.\n\nTo be concluded, if you find a feel-good movie that leaves you with a smile on your face and a warm fuzzy feeling in your heart, 'crazy little thing called first love' would be a good option to try. So, grab some popcorn and get ready to fall in love with Nam and her crazy little world."
