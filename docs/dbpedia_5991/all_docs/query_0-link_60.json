        "text": "This article may contain affiliate/compensated links. For full information, please see our Disclaimer here.\n\nAs an avid traveler AND cinephile, I’m constantly on the hunt to find and watch all the best travel movies like it was my job (and often instead of doing my job). That’s especially true right now, as we quarantine ourselves at home with less work or outside activities to occupy and entertain us. As a result, I’ve admittedly been filling an inordinate amount of my daily time with TV shows and movies.\n\nIf you’re doing the same, I thought I’d do my part to feed that guilty pleasure and offer my 18 best travel movies with strong female leads. I love to watch these when I need a little boost of inspiration, motivation, or just to live vicariously through another woman’s adventures.\n\nThere’s something on this list for everyone: bonding road movies, feel-good dramas, pensive introspective dramas, ridiculous comedies, swooning romantic dramas, swashbuckling adventures, adrenaline-packed actioners, blood-pumping thrillers, old fashion classics… whatever you’re in the mood for. Think of these as your ghosts of travel past, present, and future.\n\n1. Nomadland\n\nThis critically acclaimed Oscar winner masterpiece of a film is one of the best female-driven travel movies to date. It’s an amazing compilation of Frances McDormand’s powerful performance, Chloé Zhao’s deft directing, and then equally impressive performances from the predominantly non-actor cast who played mirrored versions their own real lives. If you see one movie this year, you cannot go wrong with this hauntingly beautiful and poetic homage to the van-living nomadic life within America. It’s based on this book Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century by Jessica Bruder, which is also a highly recommended read.\n\n2. Thelma & Louise\n\nMy next top travel movie is one of the classics, both in the strong female lead and travel road movie categories. Whether you’re more of a Thelma or a Louise, a Geena Davis or a Susan Sarandon, chances are you’ve related to this movie at one time in your life or another. Who doesn’t dream of leaving it all behind and hitting the road with their best gal pal? Since you can’t exactly go do that right now, at least you can watch this movie and imagine you are right there riding alongside these two badass female icons. “Well darlin’, look out ’cause my hair is comin’ down!”\n\n3. Eat Pray Love\n\nEat Pray Love is probably my second favorite travel story to watch over and over again. It’s both a book and a movie, and the book is also an absolute must read. It was truly life-changing for me. And the movie is truly one of the best travel movies that reminds me of those amazing life lessons every time I rewatch it. It’s also based on a true story, on Elizabeth Gilbert’s autobiographical journey across Italy, India and Indonesia. If any of those destinations sound appealing to you, then get this movie and let Julia Roberts take you on a journey. “Attraversiamo!”\n\n4. Wild\n\nWild is also based on an autobiographical book, this time by equally renowned author Cheryl Strayed and her memoir about her journey of self-discovery and healing as she hiked the Pacific Crest Trail. The book is also an incredible must read. But you won’t miss out if you start with the movie, which is truly excellent in its own right. Reese Witherspoon gives a powerful performance as the fictional depiction of Strayed, huffing and puffing her way through brutal breakdowns, deep soul searching, and beautifully therapeutic discoveries. Like Eat Pray Love, it’s also both a physical and emotional journey that will leave you examining your own personal journey and itching to hit a trail of your own.\n\n5. Under The Tuscan Sun\n\nIf you love Eat Pray Love, you’re bound to love Under The Tuscan Sun too. It’s a curiously similar story based on the writer’s memoirs (this time Frances Mayes) in which her marriage and life falls apart and she travels abroad to Italy for new unexpected adventures that help her find herself again. So if you resonated with Julia Roberts, maybe you’ll respond to Diane Lane too. I personally love them both, and consider them equally as top notch best travel movies guaranteed to give you a deep yearning for the idle Italian life. “Never lose your childish innocence. It is the most important thing.”\n\n6. Where’d You Go, Bernadette\n\nYou might think a travel movie about Antarctica wouldn’t be your bag, but trust me, this film is amazing. It’s funny, and snarky, and incredibly inspiring. And of course it is. Because it’s Cate Blanchett. And she is all those things. She plays Bernadette Fox, a mother, wife, and brilliant award-winning architect who’s lost her spark, her drive, and become complacent in life. So she takes off for Antarctica to find herself, without telling her family where she went. It’s also based on a book, albeit a fictional one, that’s packed with adventure, mystery, and valuable life lessons about reconnecting with yourself. “Step aside, because I am about to kick the hell out of life.”\n\n7. Tammy\n\nIf you want to see Susan Sarandon on another epic road movie, this time traveling alongside the sensational Melissa McCarthy, you have to watch Tammy. These two are nearly as dynamic a duo as Sarandon and Davis. And this one’s a comedy. So you’ll be rolling over with laughter while getting fired up to tackle the world with the same nonstop energy as these badass ladies. If only all grandmother-granddaughter relationships could be this hilarious and moving. “Look out, I’m comin’ in hot!”\n\n8. Little Miss Sunshine\n\nSpeaking of road comedies, Little Miss Sunshine is another winner, this time with an ensemble cast that features both strong female and male characters of all ages. So this one’s got something for everyone. But perhaps my favorite character is Abigail Breslin’s Olive Hoover, who truly beats to her own drum. While you may not be able to hop in your own VW bus and hit the road right now, you can certainly get your funky, weird ass dance moves on and create your own Little Miss Sunshine contest from the comfort of your home. Who’s gonna judge you? “You do what you love, and fuck the rest.”\n\n9. Tracks\n\nOne of my favorite best travel movies on this list is also one you’ve probably never heard of. Tracks is a powerful (and also true) story of one young woman’s nine-month solo trek across Australia’s sprawling desert, accompanied only by her faithful dog and four camels. And of course all the amazing discoveries she makes along the way. Mia Wasikowska truly shines in this role and dominates the screen in one of her best performances ever. It’s seriously a movie you have to see at some point in your life, especially as a fellow female traveler. So why not watch it now, while you have all this time on your hands?\n\n10. Whale Rider\n\nAnother lesser well-known, but equally amazing girl power movie I love is Whale Rider. It’s a moving New Zealand coming-of-age drama about a twelve-year-old Māori girl’s ambition to claim her birthright and become the first female chief of her tribe. It’s not a travel movie per se, but it sure will inspire you to plan your next trip to New Zealand. And ride a whale when you get there… though that part’s much less likely. But either way, this film is bound to leave you feeling inspired.\n\n11. Almost Famous\n\nCombining the coming-of-age and road movie themes, you get Almost Famous, a funny and poignant tale of 15-year-old William who finds an adventure following around the up-and-coming band Stillwater as a young Rolling Stone writer. Now the main protagonist is technically male. But my favorite character, who feels just as paramount, is Kate Hudson’s Penny Lane. We can all dream of being that free, that carpe diem, that truly present in the moment, appreciating everything happening around you… though perhaps without all the quaaludes. “It’s all happening.”\n\n12. Lost In Translation\n\nOnce again, this travel movie is also not technically female-led as Bill Murray is the co-protagonist. But Scarlet Johansson is the other half of that leading duo and, quite honestly, the more resonating character of the two. No hate on Murray of course. The man is brilliant. But as a woman who has found herself a little lost after following around a man, I can relate to where Johansson’s character finds herself and where it takes her in this film. “I just don’t know what I’m supposed to be.” Boy does that sound familiar. For example, right now I’m supposed to be quarantining here at home, but I want to be wandering the streets of Tokyo like these two. So why not have both?\n\n13. Before Sunrise\n\nLet’s talk about romance. What would a list of best travel movies be without a few love stories? Before Sunrise is perhaps one of the best known travel romance films that takes you on a journey of both mind and heart. Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke make another compelling leading duo, whisking you away to the unabashedly romantic streets of Vienna. It’s a beautiful story that just might restore your belief in soulmates. “If there’s any kind of magic in this world…it must be in the attempt of understanding someone.” And after you’ve enjoyed this one, you’ll want to continue the saga with its two equally moving sequels, “Before Sunset” and “Before Midnight.”\n\n14. Out Of Africa\n\nAnother epic romance that’ll give you the travel vibes came a good decade earlier. Out Of Africa came out back in 1985 and remains a wonderfully acclaimed film to this day. A chief reason being the leading lady, none other than the queen of the screen Meryl Streep herself. But her co-star Robert Redford sure adds some nice eye candy as well. Talk about a killer duo. Their chemistry and adventures will send you on an intense, emotional rollercoaster, without ever leaving your couch. “If we’re tested at all, it’s for patience, for doing without, for how well we can endure loneliness.”\n\n15. Roman Holiday\n\nOne of the best travel movies, not to mention romances, of all time was made way back in the early days of motion pictures. I’m talking the good ol’ black and white days. The days of the iconic and elegant Audrey Hepburn, and the tall dark and handsome Gregory Peck. It doesn’t get more classy or classic than those two in Roman Holiday. Sure it’s a bittersweet ending (sorry for the spoiler), but it’s still one of the most beautiful romances of all time. So curl up and get swept off to dreamy, unforgettable Rome from the comfort of your home.\n\n16. Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\n\nWhether you’re more of an Angelina or an Alicia, you can’t go wrong following the travels of the legendary adventuress Lara Croft. Technically this is two best travel movie recommendations, so I’m cheating a bit here. But they’re both uniquely excellent and worth a watch. So just carve out a little extra time one of these nights and make it a double feature. First you’ll travel to London, Cambodia, and Siberia with Angelina Jolie, and then venture to Hong Kong, the fictional island of Yamatai, and then back to London with Alicia Vikander. That’ll make for one hell of an adventurous night.\n\n17. Kill Bill Vol 1 & 2\n\nWhile we’re on the subject of badass female action heroes, there’s no female lead more badass or action-y than The Bride herself, Beatrix Kiddo. Watch her kick ass in Vol 1 in fast action-packed bloody fashion that will no doubt inspire your own trip to Tokyo, Japan. Or watch her complete her quest in Vol 2 for more slow, intense drama that will inspire a road trip from El Paso, Texas (or Lancaster, CA where it was actually filmed) on down to Mexico. Again, these are technically two movie recommendations. But then again, Tarantino considers them two parts of one movie himself. And he would know. He made them. So I’m just gonna go ahead and consider them one movie too. One very long and intense movie.\n\n18. Brokedown Palace\n\nI saved the best, or at least the darkest, for last. This powerful drama is the quintessential Tough Cookie tale of travel dangers based on a true story about two young women who travel to Thailand and find themselves scammed and wrongfully imprisoned for drug smuggling. They get through it with each other’s support and a lot of smarts, but not without a good deal of struggle. It’s the ultimate cautionary tale for female travelers, and will hopefully teach you how to be more careful with your bags and who you trust on your own future trip to Thailand, or anywhere else.\n\nWanna Learn How To Fight Back Like These Heroines?\n\nJoin my Tough Cookie Travel Self Defense Course, the first truly comprehensive women’s self defense online course that’s designed FOR women like you BY a woman who’s been through it too.
