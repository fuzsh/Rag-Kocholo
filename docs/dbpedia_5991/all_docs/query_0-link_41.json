        "text": "The films of Thai New Wave auteur Apichatpong Weerasethakul have cut across continents and language barriers, hovered through international festival circuits and, now, streaming platforms (albeit still notoriously difficult to find), to transfix viewers with their hypnotic rhythms and experimental narrative structures. Drawing from phenomenological frameworks, I approach two of Weerasethakul’s works — first the more active, effervescent body of film in his debut feature Mysterious Object at Noon (2000), then the somnambulist body which guides Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (2010) — through a sensuous reading that foregrounds these films as ghostly entities. I explore the notion of the film’s body and the viewer’s body sharing a partial, ephemeral touch as a kind of limit test for theorizations of film phenomenology. Focusing on the motif of the journey, and the films’ concerns of memory, loss, and retrieval, I suggest that the viewer’s and the film’s perceptions and expressions co-constitute an alternative, embodied experience of time.\n\nCommentary on Apichatpong Weerasethakul's work to date leaves much to be desired. At best, it affords a survey of his feature filmography in terms of Western art cinema aesthetics, and sometimes of a ‘New Asian Cinema’; at worst, it descends into exoticism. Despite his experimental leanings, and constant appearance in galleries and biennials, engagements from the side of contemporary art have done little to deepen the ahistorical contemplation of his work. This article seeks to contextualise Apichatpong's practice with reference to Thai political and cultural histories, as well as some touchstones in Western modernism. Taking as a starting point his first feature-length film (Mysterious Object at Noon, 2000), the author begins by establishing an ethno-political background for his practice, and follows this with two detours: the first, art historical, explores Apichatpong's putative alignment with a certain Surrealism; the second is psycho-geographic, and brings into relief a poetics of itinerancy in his work. At issue is the question of the moving image's amplitude as a social historical channel; and of what critical purchase an ‘itinerant cinema’ may have on Thailand's fractious political present.\n\nThis article studies about the Thai social context in Apichatpong Weerasethakul 's films. Apichatpong Weerasethakul is a Thai filmmaker who won the highest prize in Cannes Film Festival 2010. He has generated acclaim on the film festival circuit ever since his 2002 debut \"Blissfully Yours,\" which he followed up with \"Tropical Malady\" and \"Syndromes and a Century.\" Apichatpong Weerasethakul is a Thai independent filmmaker who combine between film and art. Hhis works were shown at the museums and theaters all over the world. The story telling in his films sitting in his home town Khon Kaen, a province in the northeastern part of Thailand. His film criticizes melodramas in TV, radio and Thai social context with non professional actor, narrative style and symbolics about dreams, nature, sexuality (including his own homosexuality). There are many years Apichartpong 's films has been well received in many countries that they were released. But in Thailand, some of his works were banned and unreleased such as Syndromes and a Century (2006). Although this film was the first Thai film accepted in competition of the 63rd Venice Film Festival, it is interesting to study his film with the Thai social context of what he conveyed in his works and why the filmmaker who succeed on the world stage, but for his country, he has not been widely recognized.\n\nAbstract: This article argues that the work of Thai filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul offers conceptual and methodological tools that may contribute to the re-imagination of ethnographic cinema beyond representation. Weerasethakul’s films emerge out of a para-ethnographic engagement with people and places, rely on participatory methods and operate as hosting devices for a multiplicity of subaltern beings and stories. They enact an inventive and often animistic “performative realism” (Ingawanij 2013a) which can be understood as political in the sense that it creates new conditions of possibility and room for alter-ontologies. The article conceptualizes this orientation in relation to the production of “assemblages of collective enunciation” (Deleuze and Guattari 1986) as well as to Eduardo Viveiros de Castro’s (2010) idea of “taking seriously” the ontology of others, that is, the other worlds that they experience.

Políticas y estéticas de la no representación: re-imaginar el cine etnográfico con Apichatpong Weerasethakul Resumen: El artículo argumenta que el trabajo del cineasta tailandés Apichatpong Weerasethakul proporciona herramientas conceptuales y metodológicas que pueden contribuir a re-pensar el cine etnográfico más allá de la representación. Las películas de Weerasethakul emergen de una vinculación para-etnográfica con personas y lugares, dependen de métodos participativos, y operan como dispositivos de acogida para una multiplicidad de seres e historias subalternas. Estos films proponen un \"realismo performativo\" (Ingawanij 2013) —inventivo y a menudo animista— que puede entenderse como político en el sentido de que crea nuevas condiciones de posibilidad y espacio para múltiples ontologías. El artículo conceptualiza esta orientación en relación a la producción de \"ensamblajes de enunciación colectiva\" (Deleuze y Guattari 1986); así como la idea de Eduardo Viveiros de Castro (2010) de \"tomar en serio\" la ontología de otros, es decir, de los otros mundos que ellos experimentan.

O artigo conceitua essa orientação a respeito da produção de “assemblages de enunciação coletiva” (Deleuze e Guattari 1986) bem como da ideia de Eduardo Viveiros de Castro (2010) de “levar a sério” a ontologia de outros, isto é, os outros mundos que eles experenciam.

Apichatpong's practice operates in the space between transnational art cinema and contemporary art and draws from a wide range of creative and conceptual influences from Theravada Buddhism to postwar American experimental filmmaking and contemporary 'slow cinema,' often diverging from conventional expectations of narrative cinema to dwell in moments of emptiness, contemplation and dead time. In this thesis, I trace these influences through Apichatpong's feature films, short films and installations the formal appearances of stillness, silence and extended duration, and reflect upon the broader political and phenomenological implications of these empty moments. Rather than understand emptiness as an incidental feature of his creative practice, I argue that emptiness is integral to Apichatpong's understanding of film form and the world. Through this investigation, I argue that Apichatpong's idiosyncratic film practice challenges many of the basic structures of conventional film form and spectatorship by orienting away from narrative logics of cinematic meaning to instead sensitise spectators to other ways of being in and experiencing the world.\n\nThis essay examines Nang Nak's (Nonzee Nimibutr, 1999) rendering of the temporal incongruities of haunting in relation to struggles over Thai sexual contemporaneity in the late 1990s and 2000s. Specifically, it concentrates on anachronisms that cultural and social policy makers aimed to install at the core of new bourgeois conceptions of Thai sexualities. Nang Nak can be understood as a strong example of Buddhist-nationalist cultural recovery in the domain of sexuality. The film achieves this by producing a historically inaccurate relation between the story’s setting in the nineteenth century and an ideal of femininity in the present. At the same time, however, Nang Nak also makes the temporal incongruity of desire that is highlighted in Nonzee's Buddhist framing of the legend available to a feminist perspective on the ghost’s longing.\n\nIn the middle of the Asian crisis in the late 1990s, ghost-movies became major box-office hits. The emergence of the phenomenally popular ‘J-Horror’ genre inspired ghost-movie productions in Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Singapore in unprecedented ways. Most often located in contemporary urban settings, these films feature frenzy, ghastly homicides, terror attacks, communication with the unredeemed (un)dead, and vengeful (female) ghosts with a terrifying grip on the living: features that have since became part of the mainstream television and film entertainment narrative pool. Southeast Asian ghost movies reflect upon the identity crises and trauma of the living as well as of the dead. Since these movies explore and depict forms of postmortem existence in various ways, they fit in a very literal sense to the label ‘post-mortem cinema’ (Elsaesser & Hagener). Ghost movies are embedded and reflected in national as well as transnational cultures and politics, in narrative traditions, in the social worlds of the audience, and in the perceptual experience of each individual. As products of popular culture, ghost movies unfold affection and attraction in the border zone between amusement and thrill, secular and religious worldviews, trivial and meaningful questions, angst and existential dread. This makes the genre interesting not only for sociologists, anthropologists, media and film scholars, but also for scholars of religion."
