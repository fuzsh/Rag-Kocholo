        "text": "I’m telling on myself with this one.\n\nIt’s been a long week, I have a chronic illness that makes me unusually fatigued, and I’ve just finished up at a very taxing medical appointment. As I’m leaving the doctor’s office, I spot a coffee shop across the street and suddenly remember I had gotten a promotional email from that shop that morning for a one-day, buy-one-get-one deal. Since it’s been such a long day, I decide to treat myself and grab a drink for my roommate while I’m at it. I text my roommate for their order and head into the shop.\n\nAs I’m waiting in line, I look in my app for this shop so I can pull up the deal. I don’t see it, which confuses me, and I double check the email to make sure I have the right date. Yep, right weekday and date. I even click the link for it to pull up my app account, but I don’t see the offer. Weird. I guess I’ll just ask the cashier.\n\nIt’s my turn and I step up to the register, where a nice young lady smiles at me and asks for my order.\n\nMe: “I wonder if you can help me out here. I got an email about a BOGO deal, but it’s not in my app.”\n\nI show her my phone screen.\n\nCashier: “Hmm, can you try logging out and back in?”\n\nI do so. Still nothing.\n\nCashier: “Here, scan your rewards screen and I’ll check on my end.”\n\nHer manager is working next to her and looks over to check behind her. They both still look confused, and the cashier almost looks like she’s anticipating I might yell at her about it. I’ve done plenty of time in customer service myself, and my parents raised me better than to hassle cashiers, but I also know she doesn’t know that – and I’ve got the experience myself to know she’s probably had rude customers already that day.\n\nCashier: “Hmm, I still don’t see anything. Can I see the email? Maybe there’s a barcode I can scan there.”\n\nMe: “Sure, here you go. I didn’t see a code but—”\n\nAnd then I suddenly realize something. I guess reading the date upside down makes something click in my brain.\n\nMe: “Oh! It’s Wednesday today, isn’t it?”\n\nThe cashier and I look at each other and then back at the email on my phone, which clearly states “Thursday, [date].”\n\nCashier: “…Yes, it’s Wednesday.”\n\nMe: “I’m so sorry! I’m that customer this time! I really thought today was Thursday.”\n\nI’m sure I’m blushing but I’m also laughing at myself. It’s a little mortifying, but what else is there to do? Thankfully it seems to set the employees at ease too.\n\nThe cashier was very nice about it and assured me not to worry about it, but I felt ridiculous. Especially since I’d just come from a doctor’s appointment that I’d spent all week telling myself was Wednesday.\n\nI still bought the two drinks because I was there anyway and wanted mine, plus I’d promised my roommate, and I apologized again to the cashier on my way out. Hopefully the experience will help me remember to check dates more closely in the future!"
