        "text": "Romance is one of our favorite film genres. What we love even more is Romances that involve people falling in love for the very first time. In the official trailer for ‘First Love’ starring Hero Fiennes Tiffin and Sydney Park, that’s just what their characters Jim and Ann are doing.\n\nJim (Fiennes Tiffin), a senior in high school, experiences the highs and lows of his first love with Ann (Park) as they navigate their pending departure to college. At the same time, Jim’s parents are dealing with the familial fallout of a financial crisis.\n\nA poignant look at a young man’s difficult entry into adulthood.\n\n[kofi]\n\nFirst off, do you know how long we’ve been waiting for this trailer? Seriously, we’ve literally been searching ‘First Love’ movie almost weekly for any news and now we have something to hold onto. This film already looks like one we’re going to love. We are happy to see our favorite Hero Fiennes Tiffin onscreen again. We’re also loving his chemistry with Sydney Park. These two are definitely giving us all the feels.\n\nLet me just tell you, and I have no shame in saying this but, I am looking forward to this because we rarely get any Romance films involving interracial couples or black girls for that matter. Sure, we’ve been seeing an increase in Romance films thanks to streaming outlets like Passionflix but, there is still a tremendous lack of diversity onscreen and that is upsetting.\n\nWhat we are loving most about the trailer for ‘First Love’ is that it’s going to be another Romance that isn’t sealed into a neat and tidy bow. While it’s amazing and beautiful watching Jim and Ann experience their first love with each other, it’s also a real story showcasing the downs of their relationship as well. Jim and Ann are both going through different things in their lives that will send them down different paths.\n\nOne of those different paths for them is college. That’s something that threatens to split them up and it’s a very real thing that couples do experience. Going off to different colleges can place challenges on a relationship especially when it leads to a long distance one. Looking at the trailer for ‘First Love’ makes me think of one of my personal favorite Romance flicks ‘Down To You.’ That’s another film about a young couple falling in love and dealing with a lot of highs and lows.\n\nAnd before you pass judgment on this movie and say it looks too similar to this movie or that movie, that’s what Romance films do. They basically all seem to follow a similar pattern especially as it pertains to the various tropes within the Romance genre. Let us live okay? because there is nothing wrong with that.\n\nEvery single Romance has pulled some inspiration from another Romance flick and that’s just a fact. As my mom always taught me “Nothing is new under the sun.” That being said, we don’t know about you, but we’re excited to see this film and we are counting down the days till ‘First Love’ releases.\n\n‘First Love’ also stars Diane Kruger, Sharon Leal, and Jeffrey Donovan."
