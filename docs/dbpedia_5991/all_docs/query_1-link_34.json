        "text": "I don’t normally watch Thai movies (not because I don’t like them but because most Thai movies I know are horror movies and I’m too chicken to watch them) but a friend on Plurk showed me this trailer about a month ago, and I knew I had to get my hands on the movie to see it:\n\nIt’s your typical highschool feel-good love story. It’s about a freshman named Nam who falls for a sophomore named Shone. As if it’s not enough that she chose to like someone older than her (that’s such a big thing in high school for some reason), Shone happens to be the typical jock/campus hearthrob that every girl wants. She ends up doing a lot of crazy things to try to get him to notice her.\n\nThe main character, Nam, is played by Baifern Pimchanok. She’s so pretty (she looks a bit like Kim Chiu in some angles), but they intentionally made her look ugly in the beginning of the movie. They gave her a dark, uneven complexion, a terrible haircut, glasses and braces. (Writing that description of her made me realize that those same words could be used to describe my highschool/middle school self, LOL.)\n\nShone’s character is played by Mario Maurer. Just from the way he looks in this picture you probably know why he was chosen to play the campus hearthrob. I love how the producers didn’t make him into one of those broody, mysterious guys that girls usually chase after. He’s cheerful, kind and approachable. Mario’s a bit too young for me to fangirl over, but you can’t deny that he’s cute.\n\nAnyway, the two of them look really cute together 🙂\n\nThe other characters in the movie played their parts really well too. I loved Nam’s homeroom teacher. All she had to do was appear on screen and I would start laughing like crazy, she’s hilarious! And Nam’s friends are awesome. They’re extremely supportive and remind me of my own beloved group of friends (not in terms of appearance of course XD).\n\n(I did find it a bit unfair, however, that Nam turned out gorgeous by the end of the movie but her friends looked the same. Friends normally share beauty secrets with each other, right?)\n\nThe plot is very simple, common and predictable. It’s probably every girl’s dream to change from an ugly duckling into a beautiful swan and discover that the guy you’ve been crushing on feels the same way about you, even before your transformation. Now don’t get me wrong, I loved the movie. The plot might be a bit overused, but the movie’s still definitely worth watching. The producers and director did a great job on making it enjoyable. There was great balance between the comedic and emotional scenes. I laughed like crazy watching it, and even cried during a few parts. Girls would probably appreciate the movie more, but I know a couple of guys who have seen it and ended up liking it. I watched it with my boyfriend and he seemed to like it as much – if not more – than I did. I had to pause the movie a few times because he was laughing too hard at some scenes. (And he kept asking me if I did all the crazy stuff Nam did back in highschool XD)\n\nI can relate to the story very well. Just like most girls, I’ve been through a fair share of crushes and have done a few stupid things to try to get a guy’s attention. I know that rush of excitement you get when you see the person you like, even from afar. I know what it’s like to zone out during random times of the day because your mind is too occupied by that one person. And like most girls, I know that feeling of frustration you get when you know you’re doing everything you can think of, and yet he still fails to acknowledge your existence. The trailer tells us that this movie is “based on the true story of everyone” and I couldn’t agree more."
