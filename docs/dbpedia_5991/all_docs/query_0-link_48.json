        "text": "Bonjour Tristesse, 1958\n\nOtto Preminger\n\nBased on Françoise Sagan’s novel, Bonjour Tristesse follows the temperamental Cecile (played by the divine Jean Seberg) and her wealthy father (played by David Niven) and his girlfriend (played by Deborah Kerr) on holiday at a villa on the French Riviera. The film is ripe with fashionable moments (Seberg in a red one-piece bathing suit bobbing in the sea) and wanderlust-inducing vistas of the Mediterranean.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire, 2019\n\nCéline Sciamma\n\nIn the late 18th century on an island in Brittany, a painter (Marianne) and her unknowing subject (Héloïse) spend hours in the windswept beaches of Northern France. Marianne is commissioned with the wedding portrait of Héloïse, a reluctant bride whose feelings really lie with Marianne. There’s much to behold in this film of forbidden love.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nMonsieur Hulot’s Holiday, 1953\n\nJacques Tati\n\nIn Monsieur Hulot’s Holiday, Tati introduces the lovable, bumbling character of Mr. Hulot (played by Tati himself). The film is a quiet commentary on the new holidaying class that emerged after WWII, but it’s also delightfully funny and scenic. See Mr. Hulot disrupting the peace at the beaches of St.-Marc-sur-Mer, raising eyebrows at the tennis courts, and unintentionally making a fool of himself at every turn.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nThe Intouchables, 2011\n\nOlivier Nakace and Éric Toledano\n\nIn this heart-warming tale—inspired by a true story—of unexpected friendship, François Cluzet plays Philippe, a wealthy quadriplegic who enlists Driss, played by Omar Sy, as his caretaker. Though the film mainly plays out in Phillippe's stately Parisian hôtel particulier, the two do go on a wild adventure that sees them paragliding near Mont Bisanne in the French Alps.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nAnd God Created Woman, 1956\n\nRoger Vadim\n\nPierrot le Fou, 1965\n\nJean-Luc Godard\n\nSeeking excitement and whimsy, the unhappily married Ferdinand, a.k.a. “Pierrot,” (Jean-Paul Belmondo) flees Paris with his ex-girlfriend Marianne (Anna Karina). They hijack a car and head south to Toulon, committing petty crimes and causing ruckus along the way. Things take a turn for the odd at the end, but all the while there are sweeping scenes along the French Riviera, and Karina is lovely to watch.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nReal-life sisters Catherine Deneuve and Françoise Dorléac play Delphine and Solange, twins who are longing for love—and Paris. But in the meantime, they operate a dance school in the beachside town of Rochefort. In the musical, the costumes are color-splashed, the music is peppy, and there’s really nothing not to like.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nLa Collectionneuse, 1967\n\nÉric Rohmer\n\nIn Rohmer’s third film in his Six Moral Tales series—and his first in color—La Collectionneuse follows three friends—Daniel, Haydée, and Adrien—who are spending their summer holiday in a estate near St. Tropez. Based on her ability to collect men, Haydée is dubbed La Collectionneuse—and it’s not hard to see why. Throughout the film she struts about in a teeny bikini, exuding a certain je ne sais quoi.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nTwo for the Road, 1967\n\nStanley Donen\n\nAudrey Hepburn and Albert Finney star in this British romantic comedy about a couple embarking on a road trip through Southern France and reflecting on their relationship through a series of flashbacks along the way. The scenic landscapes and slick ’60s outfits compete for the viewer’s attention—especially the chain mail dress by Paco Rabanne worn by Hepburn near the end of the film before they cross the border to Italy.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nLa Piscine, 1969\n\nJacques Deray\n\nPrepare yourself for an overdose of beauty; there’s Alain Delon, there’s Romy Schneider (unfortunately no longer a real-life couple but their love scenes perhaps do justice to what once was), and then, of course, there’s Jane Birkin. It’s a film cast with humans blessed by the heavens, plus the unpretentious charm of the setting: a villa near the Côte d’Azur perched above the sapphire Mediterranean. Things go terribly wrong toward the end of the movie, but you’d be forgiven if you only remembered the film’s scantily-clad bodies lounging poolside.\n\nThe Green Ray, 1986\n\nÉric Rohmer\n\nThough the main character, Delphine, is quite blue throughout much of the film, The Green Ray delivers solid holiday inspiration. It begins with Delphine in dire straits when her travel companion cancels two weeks before their much-anticipated trip. Not willing to travel solo, she visits a friend in Cherbourg, then the Alps, then Biarritz, where she longingly locks eyes with a man at the train station and follows him to St.-Jean-de-Luz.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nOctave Mirbeau’s 1900 novel Diary of a Chambermaid has been adapted to film on three occasions: in 1946 by Jean Renoir, in 1964 by Luis Buñuel, and in 2015 by Benoît Jacquot. All stand out in their own right, but the most recent remake—the only in color—really does justice to the story’s idyllic setting of Provence.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nSwimming Pool, 2003\n\nFrançois Ozon\n\nAt an old home in Luberon in Provence belonging to her publisher, Charlotte Rampling’s character, Sarah, a murder-mystery writer, secludes herself to finish her next book. Her writer’s retreat is interrupted with the arrival of the homeowner’s young, pleasure-seeking daughter, who disturbs the quiet. Things take a suspenseful twist when Sarah finds herself in the middle of an actual murder.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nPriceless 2006\n\nPierre Salvadori\n\nL’Arnacoeur, 2010\n\nPascal Chaumeil\n\nOpening in Morocco and ending up in the French Riviera and Monaco, Romain Duris stars as a professional break-up artist hired by the father of a bride-to-be (played by Vanessa Paradis), whose marriage to a charming Englishman is just 10 days away. Duris is tasked with derailing the wedding, despite his personal objections because the couple is really quite perfect for one another. In the end, Duris succeeds and Paradis finds herself a runaway bride.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nSummer Hours, 2008\n\nOlivier Assayas\n\nSet in a charming estate crawling with vines about an hour outside of Paris, this film sees a family gather together over the summer prompted by its matriarch’s failing health. The family comes together to decide the future of the home and its contents—an incredible art collection and antiques—enjoying alfresco meals and wine bottles brought up from the cellar. It’s bittersweet but enchants with its scenes of country life.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nGoing Away, 2013\n\nNicole Garcia\n\nBaptiste is a solitary type. A teacher in southern France, he never stays more than three weeks in the same job. One Friday, he finds himself in charge of Mathias, one of his pupils, who hasn’t been picked up after school. Mathias takes the boy to his mother, Sandra. She’s a beautiful woman who has led a bit of a wild life and who now works on a beach near Montpellier. Within a day, the trio have formed a bond, like the beginnings of a family for these three people who don’t have one. But the magic doesn’t last. Sandra owes money, and if she doesn’t pay up, something dire could happen. She must hit the road. To help Sandra, Baptiste must take a look back at the origins of his own life, at the most painful and secret parts of himself.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nTo Catch a Thief, 1955\n\nAlfred Hitchcock\n\nAlfred Hitchcock’s romantic thriller starring Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, set in the French Riviera, is what cinematic dreams are made of—despite the rumors of a mega jewel heist in the works. Whether winding along the Mediterranean coast in a blue sports car en route to a picnic overlooking the Bay of Cannes, sunbathing at the iconic beach at the Carlton Hotel, strolling down the Promenade de la Croisette, or dancing through the stone halls of the Château de la Croix des Gardes, the glamourous onscreen couple and the splendor of Southern France are on full display. In true fairy-tale fashion, Grace Kelly went on to meet her future husband, Rainier III, at the Prince’s Palace of Monaco the same year.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nIf You Don’t, I Will, 2014\n\nSophie Fillières\n\nA husband and wife at a crossroads in their marriage and in life embark on a hike in the Chamoiselle forest near Lyon. They bicker each step of their journey, and ultimately, she decides to stay in the woods and abandon her old life, whereas he returns home. A love story this is not, but the surrounding forest is something to marvel.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nFrench Kiss, 1995\n\nLawrence Kasdan\n\nMeg Ryan loses her fiancé to a bombshell French girl and sets off to France to win him back despite her fear of flying. Along the way, she meets a charming though crooked Frenchman (played by Kevin Kline) who offers to help her—with strings attached. They journey from Paris to vineyards in Provence and end up in Cannes. Perhaps it was the overwhelming romance of the settings, but in the end, Ryan falls for Kline.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nWhen you buy something through our retail links, we earn an affiliate commission."
