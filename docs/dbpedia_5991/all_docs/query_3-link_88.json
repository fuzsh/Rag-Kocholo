        "text": "This article is about a film in Avataro Sentai Donbrothers.\n\nAvataro Sentai Donbrothers The Movie: New First Love Hero (暴太郎戦隊ドンブラザーズ THE MOVIE 新・初恋ヒーロー, Abatarō Sentai Donburazāzu Za Mūbī: Shin Hatsukoi Hīrō)[2] is a Japanese superhero film that serves as the summer movie adaptation of Avataro Sentai Donbrothers, double-billed with Kamen Rider Revice: Battle Familia.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nto be added\n\nPlot[]\n\nThe movie opens with Haruka in a white dress walking up the stairs to an awards ceremony with the paparazzi surrounding her. She narrates that she was born to be an actress as she goes to the podium to accept her award as best new actress. Haruka is interviewed by the press as the first young actress to win the award in their first movie. Haruka narrates that she went from manga artist to hero to an actress.\n\nAs for how all this happened…..\n\nA flashback reveals that Sononi is playing a high school girl with Sonoi playing another student, they do a scene together but the director Kuroiwa cuts because their acting is too perfect to the point that it comes off as unrealistic. Producer Saegusa is frustrated because of the director’s obsession for realism but decides to scout for new lead actors, Sonoi pleads for another chance as both he and Sononi are willing to take on any role she asks for in the film.\n\nSonoza is observing this from Ideon and believes that they are disgracing the Noto by taking part in a human made movie. Sonoi defends his decision by stating film is a form of art and by understanding art, he can understand humanity. Sononi finds being an actress interesting and tries to encourage Sonoza to join them, but the monitor picks up a Hitotsuki racing around town and he declines the offer to go hunting.\n\nThe Hurricaneger Hitotsuki, Ninpuki, terrorizes innocent people inside a building and then uses Super Ninja Art: Shadow Dance to quickly absorb them into his body when they run outside.\n\nThe Donbrothers arrive, with Tsubasa waking from a nap and Tsuyoshi in an awkward pose because he was on a train when he was teleported. Ninpūki materializes Anoni to fight the team while he engages Taro one on one, with Tsubasa riding on Tsuyoshi’s back to do aerial shots on their opponents. Sonoza arrives armored up and interrupts Taro while Ninpuki tries to slip away, Taro uses the ZanglaSword to execute the Decisive Peach Slash to push away Sonoza as Ninpuki escapes while the others have finished destroying the Anoni.\n\nContinuity and Placement[]\n\nThis movie takes place after the events of episode 20, which features a short scene tying into the movie's events.\n\nCharacters[]\n\nRangers[]\n\nDonbrothers[]\n\nDon Momotaro Taro Momoi Saru Brother Shinichi Saruhara Oni Sister Haruka Kitou Inu Brother Tsubasa Inuzuka Kiji Brother Tsuyoshi Kijino Don Doragoku Jiro Momotani Don Torabolt Dangerous Jiro\n\nOther Rangers[]\n\nZenkaizer Black Kaito Goshikida Zenkai Juran Juran (Cameo) Zenkai Gaon Gaon (Cameo) Zenkai Magine Magine (Cameo) Zenkai Vroon Vroon (Cameo)\n\nAllies[]\n\nReiko Mieda\n\nNaoki Shiina\n\nVillains[]\n\nNoto\n\nGenerals\n\nSonoi\n\nSononi\n\nSonoza\n\nHitotsuki\n\nKuroiwa/Ninpuki\n\nGrunts\n\nAnoni\n\nCast[]\n\nTaro Momoi (桃井 タロウ, Momoi Tarō): Kouhei Higuchi (樋口 幸平, Higuchi Kōhei)\n\nShinichi Saruhara (猿原 真一, Saruhara Shin'ichi): Yuuki Beppu (別府 由来, Beppu Yūki)\n\nHaruka Kitou (鬼頭 はるか, Kitō Haruka): Kohaku Shida (志田 こはく, Shida Kohaku)\n\nTsubasa Inuzuka (犬塚 翼, Inudzuka Tsubasa): Totaro (柊太朗, Tōtarou)\n\nTsuyoshi Kijino (雉野 つよし, Kijino Tsuyoshi): Hirofumi Suzuki (鈴木 浩文, Suzuki Hirofumi)\n\nJiro Momotani (桃谷 ジロウ, Momotani Jirō), Dangerous Jiro (危ないジロウ, Abunai Jirō): Raizou Ishikawa (石川 雷蔵, Ishikawa Raizō)\n\nKaito Goshikida (五色田 介人, Goshikida Kaito): Kiita Komagine (駒木根 葵汰, Komagine Kiita)\n\nSonoi (ソノイ, Sonoi): Yuya Tominaga (富永 勇也, Tominaga Yūya)\n\nSononi (ソノニ, Sononi): Amisa Miyazaki (宮崎 あみさ, Miyazaki Amisa)\n\nSonoza (ソノザ, Sonoza): Shinnosuke Takahashi (タカハシ シンノスケ, Takahashi Shin'nosuke)\n\nDonBlaster Voice: Daiki Hamano (濱野 大輝, Hamano Daiki)\n\nRyuko no Geki Voice: Romi Park (朴 璐美, Paku Romi)\n\nGuest Cast[]\n\nReiko Mieda (三枝 玲子, Mieda Reiko): Wakako Shimazaki (島崎 和歌子, Shimazaki Wakako)\n\nKuroiwa (黒岩, Kuroiwa)/Ninpuki (忍風鬼, Ninpūki): Nobuo Kyo (姜 暢雄, Kyō Nobuo)\n\nCustomer: Rika Kishida (岸田 里佳, Kishida Rika)\n\nReporter: Kota Goto (後藤 公太, Goto Kota)\n\nTeacher: Hiroyuki Muraoka (村岡 弘之, Muraoka Hiroyuki)\n\nFemale Student: Nagisa Tabata (田畑 渚, Tabata Nagisa)\n\nTennin: Nozomi Watanabe (渡辺 望, Watanabe Nozomi), Ayaka Ida (井田 彩花, Ida Ayaka), Kotone Kawakita (河北 琴音, Kawakita Kotone)\n\nSuit Actors[3][]\n\nDon Momotaro: Kosuke Asai (浅井 宏輔, Asai Kōsuke)\n\nSaru Brother: Yasuhiro Takeuchi (竹内 康博, Takeuchi Yasuhiro)\n\nOni Sister: Ayumi Shimozono (下園 愛弓, Shimozono Ayumi)\n\nInu Brother: Kazuya Okada (岡田 和也, Okada Kazuya)\n\nKiji Brother, Zenkaizer Black: Masashi Takada (高田 将司, Takada Masashi)\n\nDon Doragoku, Don Torabolt: Shigeki Ito (伊藤 茂騎, Itō Shigeki)\n\nTransformed Sonoi: Hirotsugu Mori (森 博嗣, Mori Hirotsugu)\n\nTransformed Sonoza: Riichi Seike (清家 利一, Seike Riichi)\n\nNinpuki: Kenya Saitou (齊藤 謙也, Saitō Kenya)\n\nForm Changes and Collectibles Used[]\n\nAvataro Gears[]\n\nDon Momotaro - Don Robotaro\n\nSaru Brother - Saru Brother Robotaro\n\nOni Sister - Oni Sister Robotaro\n\nInu Brother - Inu Brother Robotaro\n\nKiji Brother - Kiji Brother Robotaro\n\nDon Doragoku - N/A\n\nDon Torabolt - N/A\n\nAvatar Changes[]\n\nAvatar Changes in Avataro Sentai Donbrothers The Movie: New First Love Hero:\n\nDon Momotaro - Don Robotaro\n\nSaru Brother - Saru Brother Robotaro\n\nOni Sister - Oni Sister Robotaro\n\nInu Brother - Inu Brother Robotaro\n\nKiji Brother - Kiji Brother Robotaro\n\nDon Doragoku - N/A\n\nDon Torabolt - N/A\n\nSentai Gears[]\n\nZenkaizer Black - N/A\n\nPromotional CM[]\n\nIn episodes 6-8 of Don-chan, the Donbrothers cast members made a promotional CM for this movie.[4] In episode 6, they held an audition to select the actors appearing in the CM.
