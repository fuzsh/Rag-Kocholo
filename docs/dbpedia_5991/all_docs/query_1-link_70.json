        "text": "Are you living this teenage dream? Yes, great! No? Don’t you worry, these romantic movies will bring back those wonderful days of young romance like no other thing.\n\n1. The Classic (2001)\n\nThis South Korean film tells the parallel love stories of a mother and daughter in the most beautiful way. The girl, Ji-hye, finds a box of old letters while cleaning up her house. As she starts reading it, the story of her mother’s romance during a visit to the countryside as a student, is told in flashbacks. The sequences, however, are also intertwined with daughter’s own love story in which she falls for a fellow student, Sang-min (Jo In-sung) who is part of the school theatre.\n\n2. Edge Of Seventeen (2016)\n\nWhat if your best friend falls in love with your brother? Well, this coming-of-age comedy-drama deals with exactly the same concept. Nadine, a 17-year-old girl, already has a problem with her family and on top of it, her high-school life gets even more unbearable when her best friend, Krista, starts dating her older brother.
