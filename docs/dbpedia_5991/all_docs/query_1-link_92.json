About this list: list made january 22, 2023 12:50 AM been thinking of making a list that centers on one of my most favorite genres of film. iâ€™ve always been a sucker for coming-of-age films in general, most especially the east asian ones iâ€™ve been so eager to explore over the last few years. thereâ€™s just something about the magic of young love that is so innocent and pureâ€”learning how to love as one immerses themselves in the process of self-discovery. i decided to compile mostly east asian films, some southeast asian films (and some from my home country ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­) for i believe they all share the same atmosphere, and similarity in culture. i also made a twitter thread featuring some of the films (& shows) from this list! note: there have been people saying that i say â€˜asianâ€™ but itâ€™s mostly just east asian films. i apologize for this is only as far as my knowledge in asian cinema could go! iâ€™m still learning, and iâ€™m very open to film recommendations from other regions in asia if you have some. please comment them down, thanks!",
