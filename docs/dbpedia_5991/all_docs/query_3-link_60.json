        "text": "After’s Hero Fiennes Tiffin and Moxie’s Sydney Park are officially starring in a new movie together.\n\nAs reported by Deadline on May 26, the two actors are set to appear in First Love, an upcoming romance drama penned by A.J. Edwards. Diane Kruger and Jeffrey Donovan have also been tapped to star in the film.\n\nAccording to the synopsis, First Love will follow a young man called Jim, played by Hero, as he takes his first steps into adulthood. A senior in high school, we’ll see Jim dealing with the “highs and lows” of his first love. And who is that first love? None other than Ann, played by Sydney.\n\nDiane and Jeffrey, who previously worked together on The Better Angels, are set to play Jim’s parents, who are “dealing with the familial fallout spurred by the financial crisis of 2008.” Does that mean we’ll be going back to the 2010s, at least for a moment? We’ll have to wait and see, but it sure looks like it.\n\n“I’m thrilled that Fortitude is not only backing A.J.’s poignant and insightful vision of love and the American family, but also to be working with such an international ensemble of great talent, led by Diane Kruger, Hero Fiennes Tiffin, Sydney Park, and Jeffrey Donovan,” Nadine de Barros, a producer on the film, who is also said to be fully financing the project, told Deadline. “I can’t wait for you guys to see this one!” Sydney wrote on her Instagram account after the movie was announced.\n\nThough no tentative release date has yet been disclosed, Deadline reported that production for the film was already underway in Los Angeles and, thanks to some sneaky Instagram stories courtesy of Sydney, we know it has already wrapped.\n\nOn May 26, Sydney posted two stories to her account that showed her receiving a gift from Hero. “Das a wraaapp,” she wrote in the video, alongside a smiling face with hearts emoji. In the video, we see the costars sharing a hug. “We did it,” Hero proclaims. “that’s a wrap,” he later adds, to which Sydney responds, “First Love, b*tch.” This is our first peek at their chemistry together, and it’s safe to say we’re already sold."
