        "text": "The critic and columnist Alan Brien once told me about a friend consulting him about an autobiography he'd been asked to write. It was the mid-1950s when angry young men were all the rage, the friend was about 30 and clearly the publishers expected him to deliver something socially significant. \"In 1939,\" he asked, referring to his sixth-form days, \"whom should I have been reading and what should I have been thinking?\" Somewhat mischievously Brien suggested he should have discovered Orwell, become disillusioned with Auden and Isherwood, had a sceptical approach to the Popular Front but a high regard for John Strachey, and so on. When I checked out the eventual book these were precisely the attitudes expressed, though whether these aspects of the author's intellectual development all came from Brien's tuition I can't be sure.\n\nThis story came to my mind while contemplating Mia Hansen-Løve's exceptional semi-autobiographical movie Goodbye First Love (aka Un amour de jeunesse), which covers a decade in the life of a middle-class Parisienne, Camille Schaeffer (Lola Créton), starting in 1999, when she's a 15-year-old schoolgirl, and continuing through her years as an architecture student. Surprisingly there are no references to any political events of the sort that have become customary in French autobiographical movies, where the bright heroes and heroines revolt against their bourgeois families, discuss Sartre and Baudrillard, throw stones at the oppressive police and generally become part of the cultural warp and weft of the times. I initially thought this a fault but now see it as part of the film's honesty. Hansen-Løve is trying to see what is essential to her heroine's emotional and intellectual development, not to puff her up or put her down.\n\nThe 31-year-old Hansen-Løve has spent most of her life involved in films, as a critic for the magazine Cahiers du Cinéma, an actress in the films of her partner, the critic and film-maker Olivier Assayas (some 26 years her senior and most recently the director of an epic movie on the terrorist Carlos the Jackal), and now the writer-director of three feature films. Her last film was the semi-biographical Father of My Children, inspired by the career of Humbert Balsan (producer of Hansen-Løve's first film, Tout est pardonné), who committed suicide after a hectic career of wheeling and dealing in the international film industry. It's one of the most convincing pictures ever made about the complex, fascinating and addictive world of film-making, worthy of a place beside Godard's Le Mépris and Truffaut's Day for Night. One guesses that she has substituted architecture for film-making in Goodbye First Love as a way of giving Camille a profession as creative and collaborative but less exotic and histrionic.\n\nThe movie begins just as Camille's first love is about to end. Her good-looking boyfriend, Sullivan, announces that he's dropping out of school to spend a year travelling in Latin America with a couple of friends. His aim is self-discovery and maturity, and he exhibits that splendidly French way of believing he can convince himself and others of the rightness of his every action. His name, Sullivan, is probably a reference to the naive film-maker in Preston Sturges's Sullivan's Travels, who abandons Hollywood and takes to the road to learn about life.\n\nWhen Sullivan comes into Camille's bedroom via the window she calls him her Romeo, and she's only half joking. A farewell holiday follows at her parents' beautiful country house in the Ardèche, though the idyll has seismic tremors. This episode is set up to be recapitulated at the end of the film. Particular emphasis is given to a straw hat by using a device popular in the silent cinema, the \"iris-in\" and \"iris-out\", by which the eye is forced to zero in on one part of an image by fading the rest to black.\n\nThe heartbroken Camille traces Sullivan's journey with pins in a map, but eventually the traveller disappears and with him the map. Time passes through casual references: an English teacher puts a date on a blackboard, an item in a newspaper mentions the year. As if sifting memories, Camille moves on in the kind of dream that is time itself. Her parents' marriage breaks up. She goes to university, with a new, insignificant boyfriend but no close female companions. Her development is subtly commented on and defined, not through anything she tells us, but through her attitude to architecture. A teacher praises her design for a new university annexe but sees the students' rooms as monastically cramped; she lacks a larger social sense. Another teacher, Lorenz, a charismatic Norwegian 20 years her senior and on the point of getting a divorce, becomes her mentor and lover. He is introduced through a riveting classroom discussion of the meaning of the term \"a glimmer\".\n\nIn a superbly flowing couple of sequences, Lorenz takes the class on a bus tour of Germany (visiting the Bauhaus building in Dessau) and Denmark, where his lessons on architecture and environment continue on a sunny day at a newly designed beach resort outside Copenhagen. A map accompanies these travels, echoing the one of Sullivan's more seemingly adventurous trips in South America. By chance, Camille and Sullivan meet again and part, an occasion on which they visit the cinema and have a crucial exchange on the way French films shape, romanticise and distort life.\n\nWe do not see Camille change, she tells us little, but Lola Créton and Hansen-Løve make us experience the movements of her mind, her growing sense of responsibility, her enlarged emotional understanding of the world. This is a splendid, understated film, unsentimental and wholly without that kind of cynicism that passes for worldly wisdom. It's as precise and ultimately as undefined as life itself."
