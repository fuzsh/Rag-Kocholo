Origin, Meaning, And History Of Keegan,

Keegan originated from an anglicized and shortened version of Mac Aodhagáin. Mac Aodhagáin means a son or descendant of Aodhagán, a double diminutive of the Irish personal name Aodh. Aodh is derived from an Old Irish word Áed, which means ‘fiery, flaming or ardent.’ The name Keegan implies ‘son of Aodh or son of fire.’ Aodh is the name of the Celtic God of the fiery underworld.

Keegan is also a surname derived from the anglicization of the Irish Gaelic clan named Mac Aodhagáin. The people of this clan provided hereditary legal to the Burkes of Clanricarde and the Conchobhair Kings of Connacht.

Hundreds of years ago, the Keegan family in Ireland went by the Gaelic name Mac Aodhagain, typically Anglicized as Hugh. The family asserts that they are descended from Saint and Bishop Eoghan, ‘of Ardsratha, now Ardstraw, in the county of Tyrone and the diocese of Derry. He was related to the Leinster chieftains since he descended from Ugaine Mor on his father’s side, and he claimed kinship with the Ulster families via his mother, Muindech.

In Celtic origin, the name means ‘Son of Egan.’ In Gaelic, the name refers to ‘Small and fiery.’ In American and Irish origins, the name means ‘A thinker, fiery, or a Form of Hugh.’

According to a different account, the name is derived from ‘the cineal Eoghain. They were the ‘genus’ or progeny of Eoghan, a famous Irish chief contemporary with St. Patrick. Owen and Eugene are the anglicized versions of the moniker.

The surname Keegan was first found in the 13th century in County Tipperary in South-central Ireland, where they held the family seat from ancient times.

KEE-gahn is the common pronunciation of the name. There are several other spellings for Egan, Eagan, MacEgan, Kegan, and Kegan are the few spelling variations of the name. Keegie, Kee, and Key are some cute nicknames for the name.

The fictional world has seen the appearance of the name a few times. For example, a fictional character named Keegan Butcher-Baker appears in the BBC soap opera EastEnders. He is Tiffany Butcher Baker’s husband.
